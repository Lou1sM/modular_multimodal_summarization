Liam suddenly heard Bill calling out to him from inside the house. Liam entered, and Bill wondered if Liam had talked to Hope. Liam said that he had, and he had told her all about Quinn. Bill said that Brooke had been confident that Liam and Hope would be back together. \"So where's Hope?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nLiam admitted that Hope had returned to Wyatt. Bill wondered if Hope would leave Wyatt. \"It's too late for that,\" Liam said. \"Because they're married?\" asked Bill. Liam answered that Hope and Wyatt had been married for a while -- building it on a lie -- but they'd moved on. \"I thought Hope and I could turn back the clock. I really did, but I was wrong,\" Liam said.\n\n\nBill sympathized with Liam, but Liam was convinced that Bill was pretending. Bill told Liam that Wyatt wasn't happy because Liam had been unhappy. Bill promised that Quinn would never mess with Liam again. Liam said that there was nothing left for Quinn to take from him.\n\n\n\"So what now?\" Bill asked. Liam answered that he wanted to focus on work and asked Bill to teach him to rock climb. Bill offered to call his boxing trainer. Liam said he'd had one gut punch already. Bill reminded Liam that he had not been hit with anything new. Liam agreed. He thought it would make a difference that he had uncovered what Quinn had done, but it hadn't. \"Right now, I don't know what to believe,\" Liam said. Bill hugged Liam.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Hope entered, and Wyatt said that he had tried not to call or text her. \"I've been pacing a groove in the floor,\" he said. Wyatt admitted that his mother had gone to a whole new level of crazy. Hope said she had gone to Liam's. Wyatt noted that she had returned, and he hoped that it was very good news. \"Or you're here to get your stuff,\" he said. \n\n\nWyatt shared that his mother had returned and actually made sense. He acknowledged that she had been despicable and disgusting, but it hadn't changed the reason they had been married. Wyatt justified that Hope would not have married him because Liam hadn't shown up. She'd married him because they were in love and he made her happy. \"It had nothing to do with my mother or Liam,\" Wyatt said. He reminded Hope that they had taken a leap of faith, and no one had forced or pushed her to do that.\n\n\nHope made Wyatt promise that his mother's involvement would stop and could never ever happen again. Hope acknowledged that she had put herself in the middle of everything by dating both Liam and Wyatt. Wyatt didn't want to relive the past. He said he looked forward to adventure with her. \"I don't need to know what's in our future. I know that I want to share it with you. Where do we go from here\"? Wyatt asked.\n\n\nWyatt suggested that they get away and stop worrying about the past or the future. Hope laughed and said that she loved that Wyatt had one surprise after another for her. \"That's what life is going to be like with you,\" she said. Wyatt kissed her and noted that she'd made it sound like they had a future together.\n\n\nWyatt wanted them to be as successful as Eric and Stephanie. Hope said she had always been a planner and wanted to slow down. She added, \"You are my husband, and I love you, and I'm committed to our future and our family. This is where I need to be.\" \n\n\nWyatt promised to make Hope happy and begin their life together, and maybe start a family of their own. \"Yes, we will,\" Hope said. They hugged. Wyatt smiled gratefully, and Hoped looked scared.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Aly and Ivy discussed what would happen when Hope learned that Quinn had pushed Ivy into the Seine. Aly said that Hope and Liam had a deep connection, and she said Hope would leave Wyatt. But Ivy said that Hope had married Wyatt, and the news about Quinn changed nothing -- Hope had chosen Wyatt.\n\n\nIvy said that she had heard Logan women never let go of any man they wanted. It appeared that Hope was a lot like her mother. Ivy and Aly worried about Liam. Aly suggested that Ivy call Liam, but Ivy refused. \n\n\nAly decided to call Liam, and Liam answered. He said he had to call her back because he and his dad had been talking. Aly asked if Hope had been there, and Liam said that she had returned to Wyatt. Aly thought that Hope would end her marriage, but Liam said that wouldn't happen.\n\n\n\"I understand,\" Aly said. Aly shared with Ivy that Hope had honored her commitment to Wyatt. Aly felt that Bill would be glad to have Hope away from Liam. Ivy disagreed. \n\n\nAly told Ivy to visit Liam, but Ivy said he was heartbroken. She hoped that Hope would let Liam get on with his life. \"He's such a wonderful guy. He deserves to be happy,\" Ivy said. She hoped he discovered life after Hope.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Bill had left, and Liam sat outside his home and flashed back to meeting with Hope when she had said, \"I will love your forever.\"\n\n\n",

Wyatt makes an emotional plea to Hope as to why she should remain in their marriage despite Quinn\u2019s part in pushing them together.

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam relives the moment when Hope tells him she is pregnant. Then he realizes that Bill is hollering at him from the front door. Bill says he just saw Brooke and she is pretty confident he and Hope are going to get back together. Hope arrives home. Wyatt seems surprised that she came home. She asks if he has been waiting. He says not all night. He hasn't been texting, he hasn't been calling her but he has worn a groove in the floor over there. She says she is sorry she left. She should not have done that. He says no, he understood. She was overwhelmed by what his mother did following Liam to Paris and pushing Ivy into the Seine, a whole new kind of crazy. She says she went to Liam's. He says he figured that out but now she is here. He asks if it is very good news or is she here to get her stuff. At Forrester, Ivy asks Aly how does she think Hope will re-act. Aly says they all thought it was an accident but when Hope finds out Quinn pushed her, she will not go back to Wyatt. She knows she likes Liam and this is not what she wants to hear. But Hope and Liam have a history. Ivy says but Hope and Wyatt made a commitment. Aly says yes but under false pretenses so it doesn't count. Ivy says it's okay; she knew what she was getting into. Hope is a Logan so maybe it's true what they say. They can have any man they want and then just never let go. Liam tells Bill that Hope left and she is not coming back. And it's too late for her to come back. He says they have been married for a while now even though it is built on a lie but they have moved on. He agonizes that he really thought they could turn back the clock but he was wrong. Wyatt tells Hope before she says any more, he needs to tell her something. He locks the door. He says when she left his mother showed up. And he told her if Hope did not come back that he would blame Quinn. It was very upsetting to her but right in the middle she said something that actually made sense. He says what she did was disgusting and despicable but that doesn't change how they felt when they said their vows and all the amazing days they have had since then. He says Hope did not marry him because Liam did not show up on time. That is not how she makes decisions. They are together for a reason and it has nothing to do with his mother or Liam. Whatever manipulations she and Liam had in the past, she chose a future now with him. She says he has to admit what his mom did was wrong. He says yes, of course but they aren't wrong. He asks if he has ever made her unhappy and she says no; also no to not making her satisfied as a husband. He says he promises he never will either. She says he also has to promise that nothing like this will ever happen again. She realizes she put herself in this by dating two brothers and then accepting the diamond from Wyatt and then Liam's ultimatum but it can not be like that any more. He says he doesn't have to know what's in their future. He just knows that he wants to share it with her. That is what a leap of faith is. Aly wants Ivy to call Liam and when she doesn't then Aly calls him. She hears just enough to know that Hope is not there and she has returned to Wyatt and the marriage. Ivy says as bad as she feels for Liam she is glad that Hope is sticking to her commitment. Maybe knowing what Quinn did didn't matter as much as they thought it would. Bill tells Liam that he is sorry. Liam says he doesn't have to pretend this is so bad. Bill says if it hurts Liam then it hurts him too. And Wyatt can't be happy with his mother's behavior just like they rest of them he is disgusted by her. Liam chuckles when Bill says she will never mess with him again. Liam says that is because there is nothing left for her to do. Any chance he had with Hope was gone long before Charlie showed him that video. Bill asks Liam what is next. Liam says focus on work, go rock climbing, skydiving whatever it is that keeps Bill's mind off of Brooke. Bill quips drinking. Liam says no not that. He really thought what was fair and right would win out in the end. Now he isn't sure what to believe. Bill gives him a big hug. Wyatt tells Hope that he loves her and he believes in them and wants kids and a family and a partnership as successful as Eric and Stephanie's. That is everything; their life now. She says he knows that she has always been a planner. He says fine, make a list. They can slow down. Just get away from his mother and Liam, just the two of them on some adventure. She knows what his mother did and how Liam feels but he needs to know where she stands. Aly tells Ivy that Liam is heartbroken. She can hear it in his voice. Ivy needs to go be with him. Ivy says she will be there for him again if he needs her but she doesn't want him to think that she wants something from him. Aly says Ivy is his friend so it wouldn't be like that. Ivy says if Hope will let him go for good, then she will listen to him just like she did on their ride back from Paris. He's such a wonderful guy. He deserves to be happy. And he will be once he has worked through this and realizes there is life after Hope. Wyatt says perhaps they should just not think about it .no more promises or vows. They will just figure it out and go for it. She says he is so confident and that is what life is going to be like with him, one surprise after another. He asks if that is such a bad thing. He asks if she is staying and she says yes. He grabs her and kisses her. She says she loves him. He's her husband and she is committed to this marriage, their future, their family. This is where she needs to be. He says good, someday they will have a family all of their own. She agrees, yes they will.",
