Phoebe is shocked, but she still tries to defend him. Then Shane grabs the rap sheet from Hector. He explains the robbery charge by telling Phoebe that he stole a sandwich when he first moved to LA and was broke.  Hector demands to know why he failed to appear in court.  Shane says he did go to court that day but had to leave at 1pm because he had a job interview, since he left before he had been seen they considered it a failure to appear in court.  Still not satisfied Hector asks him about the restraining order.  Shane swiftly replies that he got that when he quit his job as a security guard at a bank,   adding that it was standard procedure for that bank to do this to security guards once they quit their position there. Shane then angrily leaves, heading to his room.  Phoebe follows him upstairs and assures him that she believes his story and doesn't care much for Hector's opinion.  Shane tells her he paid for the sandwich as soon as he got his first check but admits there may still be a warrant for his arrest.   Phoebe tells him she knows he isn't a criminal.  Attempting to get closer to her, Shane gets her to change his bandages.  While she is doing this, Shane watches her,  and realizes that he might be able to get more than a million dollars out of this deal.  Acting like he just wants to thank her, Shane asks Phoebe to come out to dinner with him when he gets his next check and she accepts.  Hector eavesdrops outside the door.  Not trusting this guy at all,  Hector decides to make another call to his friend to checkout Shane's story.\n\n\n",

Brooke tells her that is no disgrace and she is relieved and she is sure Nick will be too. When Bridget tries to explain more, Brooke will not listen and tells her she loves her and she knows she does not have designs on her husband. Not knowing Bridget is there, Nick arranges for the minister to come and they will renew their wedding vows. Brooke is delighted with such a romantic gesture. Bridget sticks around and watch.

Later he plays coy getting Phoebe to attend to his injured arm. He hopes she doesn't hold what Hector said against him, and she doesn't. She KNOWS he's not a criminal.
