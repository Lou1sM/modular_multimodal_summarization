Brooke expressed surprise, and in a rush of emotion, Hope suddenly hugged her mother.\n\n\nHope remarked upon the random sequence of events that had upended her life. Brooke called Quinn's actions unfortunate, but Brooke believed that Hope could change things back. Hope stated that she and Liam couldn't be together, and Brooke asked why. \"Because I'm pregnant,\" Hope revealed.\n\n\nBrooke was overwhelmed with emotion about the unexpected news. She asked if Hope was sure, and Hope said she was definitely pregnant. Hope stated that she'd begun to notice that her period had been late, and she'd had a feeling that she'd needed to take a test before reuniting with Liam.\n\n\nBrooke assumed the test had been positive. Nodding, Hope tearfully explained that instead of having a reunion with Liam, she'd had to end it with him. She said Liam had offered to raise the baby as his own. \"That's a solution!\" Brooke exclaimed. Hope shot it down as being unfair to anyone involved. Brooke guessed that Wyatt was thrilled, but Hope asked if she was awful for not telling him yet.\n\n\nBrooke said it was okay for Hope to get used to it first. Hope relayed that it was complicated, but Brooke reasoned that it was \"never not a miracle.\" Hope said she'd always wanted to be a mother, but she wasn't announcing it yet. Hope bade Brooke permission to tell Deacon, but no one else.\n\n\n\"This baby was supposed to be Liam's,\" Hope sadly said. She believed that it would have been Liam's if Quinn hadn't pushed Ivy. Brooke asked what Hope would do. Hope relayed that she'd remain married, and she'd watch Wyatt's face light up when she told him that she was pregnant.\n\n\n\"Because he's a really amazing person, and he loves me so much. And he's going to be the best dad ever,\" Hope added. Hope vowed to go on her leap of faith and be the wife Wyatt deserved. She'd love the child, be a good mother, and spend her life being grateful for her family.\n\n\n\"And Liam?\" Brooke asked. Hope whimpered, and tears glazed her eyes. \"I'm going to forget about Liam -- somehow -- because I have to,\" Hope said and mirthlessly chuckled as her eyes welled with tears. Brooke scooped Hope into her arms and held her.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Liam set down files and thought of Hope's pregnancy announcement. Wyatt entered and said he was probably the last person Liam wanted to see. Liam murmured that it hadn't taken Wyatt that long to show up to gloat. Wyatt replied that he was there to apologize for his mother.\n\n\nWyatt said it had been far from the first time he'd had to do it, but before, it had been easier to forgive Quinn and believe she wouldn't do it again. Wyatt didn't think he could look the other way anymore because he had a wife and family to protect. Liam guessed Wyatt was looking forward to that.\n\n\nLiam revealed that it was hard for him, and Wyatt stated that he wasn't there to rub it in Liam's face. Wyatt said that he, Hope, and Liam were family. \"Wyatt, you basically walked off with my life, and now I get to sit here and watch you live it,\" Liam resentfully replied. Wyatt asked if Liam could find forgiveness by the time Wyatt and Hope got pregnant.\n\n\nLiam's brow creased as he silently realized that Hope hadn't told Wyatt about the pregnancy. Liam asked if Wyatt had discussed starting a family with Hope. Wyatt said Hope wasn't ready, but he wanted to have a kid as soon as he could \"bring her around.\"\n\n\nLiam seemed to retreat into his thoughts as Wyatt promoted being friends if not brothers. \"Maybe,\" Liam replied. Wyatt was sorry for Liam's pain but insisted they could only go forward, not back. Wyatt hoped Liam could take part in Wyatt's family because it was happening as they spoke.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Carter arrived and feigned surprise to see Maya sitting in there, waiting for Rick. Carter claimed to hate interrupting her bid for Rick's attention, but he had a meeting with Rick. Maya touted that she wasn't bothered because she could have Rick's attention anytime she wanted.\n\n\nRick arrived and said that Caroline was working with Ridge. Maya remarked that Caroline and Ridge's design partnership had happened out of nowhere, but Rick contended that Ridge had been exposed to Caroline's designs since after Paris. Carter wondered why Maya even cared.\n\n\nKatie arrived. She said she was waiting to see Ridge. Rick and Carter decided to do their conference call in Carter's office, so that Katie could wait for Ridge in Rick's office. After the men departed, Maya noted that Katie had been \"orphaned\" by Caroline and Ridge, too.\n\n\nKatie looked quizzically at Maya, who elaborated that Caroline and Ridge spending all that time together had left Rick and Katie alone. Katie wasn't bothered by it because it went along with creating and designing. Maya wondered why Ridge would suddenly single Caroline out for specialized attention. \"They work together. It's fine,\" Katie insisted. Maya questioned it being fine for Katie.\n\n\nKatie sensed that Maya wanted to say something. Maya asserted that Katie should know what Maya had seen between Ridge and Caroline. \"It was a lot more than designing,\" Maya said and claimed to have seen Caroline looking very comfortable in Ridge's arms.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Caroline asked Ridge if he'd reconsider letting her tell Rick what was going on with the designing. \"Absolutely not,\" Ridge replied. She explained that it was hard for her to keep quiet, and Ridge suggested that they stop doing it if it was that much of a burden. Caroline figured that Ridge wouldn't need her for that much longer, so she'd continue to keep the secret.\n\n\nRidge conveyed that Rick was breathing behind his throat, and Ridge and Caroline needed to get to work. While reviewing their progress on some gowns, Ridge remarked that, by the end of it, Caroline would have something she could be proud of. To Caroline, working with him was an actualized fantasy, and if his ability returned that very day, she'd walk away with no regrets.\n\n\nRidge said that Caroline wasn't going anywhere, and he liked working with her. It reminded him of his beginnings, when designing had been new and learning had been a revelation. He'd been on top for a long time, and suddenly, he was a novice again. Caroline said he'd never be that. To her, he was still the brilliant Ridge Forrester, and it would never change. \"See what I mean? You do me good,\" he replied.\n\n\nRidge knew that he was asking a lot of Caroline to keep his secret from Rick, and Ridge was grateful that she was doing it. Caroline said it was her privilege to help him in any way she could. Ridge warned that he'd take her up on it because he needed her. \"This experience and everything that you've given me -- I need you, too,\" Caroline replied with emotion.\n\n\nCaroline grabbed a pencil but hesitated to mark on the sketchpad before her. She was nervous and didn't want to do anything wrong. Ridge explained that nothing would be wrong because it was a process that they were working through together.\n\n\nRidge instructed Caroline to start with the back, but Caroline had never done that before. He explained that one started with what he saw most clearly; it would become the inspiration point. \"Come on. Low and draped,\" Ridge prodded. She asked him to take her hand and show her what he saw.\n\n\nAs Ridge did so, Caroline continuously gazed back at Ridge, whose face hovered just over her shoulder. He seemed engrossed in the process, but she paid little attention to the movements of their hands. Graceful music played as the drawing continued. Ridge leaned closer to her. She turned her face from his as it loomed mere breaths from hers. She stole another look at him, and he glanced back. She caught her breath and looked as if she might kiss him. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt is probably the last person Liam expected to see. He thinks Wyatt came to gloat.. Wyatt says actually he came to apologize. He is apologizing for his mother. It's been easy in the past but he can't do that anymore. He has a wife now to protect; a family. Liam says this is hard for him to hear about this family they are starting. Wyatt basically walked off with his life and now he has to sit here and watch him enjoy it. Wyatt says it is not that way. He and Hope want to start their life and he hopes she will be pregnant soon. Light bulb goes off for Liam. He asks Wyatt if he has spoken to Hope about this. Wyatt says she is not quite ready yet. But he is ready as soon as she comes around. Brooke and Hope bring food home to Wyatt's for them to eat and catch up. Brooke assumes Hope will be moving out and is surprised when Hope tells her to wait. Plans have changed and she is not moving out. She is staying with Wyatt. Brooke is stunned and says there are other options. Hope says no ..she is pregnant. She says she took a pregnancy test so she would not freak out like she did last time. So she had to tell Liam first that she was not coming back to him. And she has not told Wyatt yet. Caroline asks Ridge if she can tell Rick as it is so hard for her to keep things from him, and especially this big secret. Ridge says no way. Caroline tells him even if he could draw again she could walk out that door with no regrets. He says she is going nowhere. She says okay, this is just temporary and he is still the great Ridge Forrester. She says she has to respect that he needs more time and that he needs her for now. Rick, Maya and Carter discuss Caroline helping Ridge. Katie walks in but Rick and Carter have a meeting and they leave. Maya and Katie make small talk until Maya implies that Caroline and Ridge are spending a lot of time together. He has hand selected her. Katie says she obviously has something to say so go ahead and say it. Maya does. She says she has seen them and what they do are a lot more than creating. Meanwhile Caroline and Ridge are huddled closely and she is trying to follow Ridge's hands and design and she looks toward him for guidance. Maya tells Katie that she has had personal experiences with Caroline and how she operates. She walked in on them and it looked like she was very much at home in Ridge's arms. Wyatt tells Liam that if it is too soon to be brothers then perhaps they can just be friends. There is no going back only forward and he hopes Liam can do that. He wants Liam to be part of his family. It's happening as they speak. Brooke tells Hope that it is okay that she sit with this for now and think about it. It's complicated, but never not a miracle. Hope says she wanted to be a mom all her life but she is not ready to make an announcement yet. It was supposed to be Liam's. That's the way she planned it and it would have been if it had not been for Quinn. But now she will stay with her husband and tell him and watch his face light up. He loves her and will make the best daddy ever. She is going to embrace the leap of faith that they took. She will love this child and be a really good mom and so grateful for her family. And Liam .she is going to forget abut him somehow ..she has to.",
