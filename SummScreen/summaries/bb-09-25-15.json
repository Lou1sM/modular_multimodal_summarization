She implored Dr. Li to say there was some way to know or take a paternity test to figure it out before she left the office. Dr. Li considered the fact that Caroline had had a period, even though it had been light, and asked if Caroline had really had no idea that she could be pregnant.\n\n\nCaroline exclaimed that she'd been on the pill. Dr. Li said no contraception was one-hundred-percent effective, especially if doses were missed. Caroline was upset that she \"could be carrying...\" The doctor said that Caroline had had a period, and the pregnancy could have happened after. For the time being, there was no reason to believe it wasn't her husband's child.\n\n\nDr. Li offered to do more tests when the time was right, but she had a good feeling about it. She decided to start Caroline on prenatal vitamins. Clasping her stomach, Caroline said it was \"our first baby.\" She couldn't wait to tell Ridge.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Brooke suggested that Ridge see a fertility expert. Ridge said his doctor was an expert, and the results would still be the same. She believed this his wife loved him and would eventually accept the news, but he had to be honest and stop holding it back. Ridge felt that he was taking Caroline's dream away. Brooke said he'd done all he could, but it wasn't possible.\n\n\nRidge insisted that Caroline wanted to carry his child, and as long as she was with him, carrying a child would never happen. Brooke guessed he didn't want her around when Caroline returned but repeated that there were other ways to have a child.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, which had a new plaque to indicate \"design office\" on the door, Steffy arrived upset, claiming that Quinn's designs were all wrong. Thomas asked what was wrong, and Steffy stated that the designs were nothing like Quinn had pitched. He asked if Steffy meant they weren't as Ivy and Quinn had pitched. He wondered if Steffy had second thoughts about Ivy's firing.\n\n\nSteffy wondered why she'd have second thoughts when she couldn't trust Ivy. She'd thought Thomas was on her side. Thomas said he was -- except for when he wasn't. She warned him not to get on the boss's bad side. He said there wasn't a chance, and even though he and Ridge had started out rocky, Ridge was responding well to the designs.\n\n\nSteffy asked how it was to work closely with the couple due to Thomas' history with Caroline. Thomas was tired of everyone thinking there was something going on. He admitted to being worried that Ridge would let Caroline down, but Ridge was giving her the family of her dreams.\n\n\nLater, Thomas took a sketch into the CEO's office. He showed it to Brooke, who was impressed. He asked where his father was. Brooke replied that Ridge had gone home to be with Caroline and talk about something in private. Thomas figured it would be an afternoon of romance that would lead to a baby within nine months. Brooke pursed her lips but said nothing.\n\n\nAt the loft, Caroline arrived, noted that Ridge was drinking scotch, and asked what had happened at work. Ridge just stared at her. She decided she needed to tell him her news, but he asked if he could go first. Upon seeing the seriousness in his eyes, she agreed to let him speak first.\n\n\nRidge wanted to talk about Paris. He said he'd been at a crossroads in his life. His children had been doing great, and the idea of having another family had seemed like a lot of work. Ridge stated that if he'd known that Caroline was on the way into his life -- but he hadn't known, so he'd had a vasectomy to make sure he wouldn't have any more kids.\n\n\n\"What...?\" Caroline said with a withering expression. Ridge said it had been why he'd said he couldn't give her children. He explained that when he'd decided to marry her, he'd intended to get the vasectomy reversed. Caroline looked hopeful until he added that the doctor had run tests and discovered that nothing was viable. Ridge was sorry that he couldn't be the father to her kid.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt was trying to work from home rather than go into the office and see Liam's face. Ivy prepared to leave, but he said she'd just gotten there. Wyatt was still upset that Bill had shot down his idea for the fashion house. Ivy understood that Bill hadn't wanted to pit the brothers against each other, and she loved Wyatt for trying to make it happen.\n\n\nIvy was frustrated because, though she hadn't been right to use the video as she had, Steffy had been wrong to fire Ivy and have her tossed out of the building. Ivy believed it was her family business, too. Ivy declared that she wouldn't be kept away, and Steffy couldn't get away with it.\n\n\nWyatt wanted Ivy to slow down and think about it. He said Steffy hadn't told anyone about the video, but \"if you push her...\"\n\n\nJust then, Quinn entered the house, asking who'd be pushed and what was happening. She assumed that Ivy and Wyatt were plotting to get Ivy's job back. Ivy said they weren't plotting. Ivy planned to go to Forrester and hopefully get through to Steffy. Quinn relayed that Steffy never backed down on anything and asked why Ivy thought she would that time.\n\n\nIvy felt that she had to try, and Quinn guessed it was because Ivy missed working with Quinn. Ivy said she missed it all, even Pam's lemon bars. \"Eww!\" Quinn exclaimed. Quinn felt that it was possible with Wyatt in Ivy's corner, and Ivy could count upon him in ways she never could with Liam. Ivy knew it and said Wyatt had proved it in a way Ivy would never forget.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to know what way that was, but Wyatt asked if Quinn had to know everything. Quinn asked if they had to be cryptic. Ivy returned the subject to her hope of getting through to Steffy, and Quinn asked what would happen if Ivy couldn't do it.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt guessed Ivy should be at Forrester by then. Quinn guessed he was worried about Ivy and added that it was all up to Steffy. Wyatt declared that if Liam was a good guy, he'd stand up to his girlfriend about it. Quinn replied that Liam's track record with women was sickening, but he was still the fair-haired wonder boy. Wyatt griped that it was especially true in Bill's eyes.\n\n\nQuinn asked what that meant, but Wyatt dismissed it and went on to say that he'd thought Quinn had seen grand opportunity in the firing. Quinn asked if she couldn't change her mind. She said she could see how Wyatt and Ivy felt about each other, and their situations were similar. Wyatt stated that Liam and Steffy had disrespected the pair. Wyatt hoped it would change -- at least for Ivy.\n\n\nQuinn asked why Wyatt wasn't fighting Steffy and her lap dog. Quinn believed that her son was a natural-born leader. She felt that he should be running Forrester and Spencer or creating his own company to go head-to-head with them. Wyatt asked who'd said he hadn't tried.\n\n\nBack in the design office, Steffy was working when Ivy entered and said she'd slipped by security. Steffy asked what Ivy wanted. Ivy said she'd been punished enough, and she asked if Steffy thought it was time for Ivy to get back to the office and do some work.\n\n\nIvy knew that Steffy felt justified in the firing. Steffy said blackmail was justification enough. Ivy stated that she hadn't been dealing with Aly's death well. Steffy claimed that they all missed Aly, but what Ivy had done had been wrong. Ivy said she'd been torn by what she'd seen on the video, but she should have dealt with her own guilt instead of using the video as she had.\n\n\nIvy understood why Steffy didn't want Ivy as the face of Forrester, but Ivy believed that they'd had time to cool off. Ivy said she was a Forrester, too, and had made a valuable contribution to the business. Ivy believed she could again. She stated that they were family and should be able to put their differences aside.\n\n\nIvy claimed to respect Steffy's position in the business and said she could prove herself as a loyal and trustworthy employee. She asked Steffy to please find it in her heart to let Ivy return to the business. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline tells her doctor that she can not leave here today until she knows who the father is. There must be some test. Ridge also tells Brooke that he's had tests and he could have a thousand more and it will not change things. Brooke again advises him to tell Caroline. He says Caroline has wanted this for so long and now he finds out he is sterile and it is not possible so he can not tell her now. Thomas asks Steffy if she had had second thoughts in letting Ivy go if she is not that pleased with Quinn's designs. Wyatt kisses Ivy and tells her he is going to work from home today as he can not go in and see that smug face of Liam. And now his dad has shot down his own fashion house. Ivy tells Wyatt that she has as much right to be at FC as Steffy so she will not stand for this. Quinn walks in and wonders if they are plotting a way to get her back into FC. Ivy says they are not plotting but she is going to see Steffy and talk to her again. Wyatt has done all he can and Quinn thinks they are being awfully cryptic. The doctor tells Caroline there is no test immediately to give her the answer but she'd like to find out more about this period that Caroline had around the time she had sex with the other guy and is wondering if he could be the father. The doctor says based on everything she has said she has no doubts this is her husband's child and she sees no problems. They will get her started on vitamins right away. Caroline is optimistically happy and can't wait to tell Ridge. Ridge tells Brooke that he wants to be alone when Caroline comes back so he'd like her to leave. She says again that he needs to tell Caroline and face the future. There are other ways to have a baby. Ridge won't hear of that since Caroline wants his baby. Quinn tells Wyatt that Liam's track record with women is sickening. He will not stand up for Ivy against Steffy. They were both disrespected but he hopes that will change today. Ivy slips in past the guards and tells Steffy that she thinks it is about time she came back to work. Thomas wants to show his dad some designs but runs into Brooke instead. She thinks it is brilliant and adding him to the design team has added a plus. She says Ridge went home as he needed to talk to Caroline, something in private. Caroline is not expecting him at home but can not wait to tell him her news. She starts to gush it out but he stops her and says there is something he needs to tell her first. He starts by saying there is something he needs to tell her about Paris. He was living at a crossroad then and trying to decide what to do with his life. His children were all grown except RJ who was turning into a fine young man. Having another family did not cross his mind so he took steps to make sure he never had any more....he had a vasectomy. So when he had earlier told her he could not give her kids that is what he meant. But then she seemed so broken and cried over the phone and no one to lean on and he knew he had lost her and he would be lost too. So he decided that he would go and have the vasectomy reversed. They can have one kid or ten kids. So he went to the doctor today and he ran tests and Ridge says he is sorry but nothing is viable. He is sorry but he can not be the father to her child.",
