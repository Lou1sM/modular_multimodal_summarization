Ridge thanked her for stepping up in Quinn's absence. Ivy left, and Ridge and Steffy discussed that Brooke had left Bill.\n\n\nRidge was glad that Brooke had walked out on Bill, but Steffy kind of rolled her eyes. She believed Brooke would be back, but Ridge said that Brooke had removed her rings and told Bill they were done. Steffy noted that it could be temporary.\n\n\nRidge wondered why Steffy was so sympathetic to Bill. Steffy said she was trying to hold her family together. Ridge felt Bill had done something pretty bad to lose Brooke. Steffy refused to discuss it with him. She left.\n\n\nAt Spencer, an employee thanked Liam for his new benefit plan and said it had made the difference between night and day for her family. Liam was happy to hear it. Bill listened outside the door and entered when the employee left.\n\n\nBill surprised Liam and closed the door. Liam asked his father what he could do for him. \"Get your ass out of my chair. This ends today, son. I've had enough,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill reminded Liam of who owned the company. \"My office. My company. I will not be blackmailed,\" Bill said. He wanted Liam out of his office, effective immediately. Bill added that \"playtime is over.\" Liam laughed and said that they were not playing chicken. Liam argued that Bill shouldn't consider it blackmail but rather karma -- something that had never really caught up to him in the past.\n\n\nBill changed his tune and said he would not be held hostage. Liam said he wished he had a father who wouldn't destroy people's lives. Bill countered that he wondered how long Liam believed that Bill would put up with his abuse. \"I've apologized over and over again,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill added that he had learned his lesson, and he knew he had to change. He wanted to move forward. \"This is my company. It was my firstborn child,\" Bill said. He felt he had nurtured and protected it and turned it into the powerhouse it had become. He would not allow Liam to run it into the ground.\n\n\nLiam nodded. He reminded Bill that he could call the police. \"Really, son?\" Bill asked. He doubted that his son would turn in his own father. \"How dare you?\" Bill said. Liam answered that he had always respected his father, though he had rarely agreed with him. Liam felt they'd had enough space between them at work that they could remain in the business together. \"But then you crossed the line,\" Liam said. \"Liam Spencer -- judge, jury, and executioner,\" Bill said.\n\n\nLiam countered that he had done wonderful things in Bill's absence. He had improved benefits, provided parental leave, and made the company better. Bill lectured Liam and suggested that Liam should light money on fire. Liam stopped him. \"I'm not the arsonist,\" Liam said. Bill was suddenly silent.\n\n\nBill and Liam argued more, and Bill refused to lose his company. Liam reminded him that he had risked lives. Liam added that he had given Sally the property where Bill had wanted to build Spencer Tower. \"Don't you think I know that?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nBill berated Liam for making bad business decisions and being in over his head. He informed Liam that Spencer Tower would have made a lot of money. Liam told his father that he had given the property to Sally as restitution for what Bill had done. He added that Sally would pay him back.\n\n\nBill laughed and angrily shouted at Liam that he was going to take control immediately. He picked up the phone and stuck it into Liam's face. \"Do it. Call the police. I dare you,\" Bill said. Liam tensed and looked determined.\n\n\nLiam warned Bill not to push him. Steffy entered and broke up the argument. She said that Liam would not turn his father in. \"Right, Liam?\" she asked. Liam looked angry, but he received a text message from Sally, who asked him to meet her. Liam said he had to leave. Liam glared at Bill and advised his father that if Bill ever threatened him again, he would have security remove Bill. Liam walked out of the office. Bill angrily tried to go after him, but Steffy held him back. Bill slammed the door.\n\n\nBill lamented that he had screwed up. \"This is what I deserve,\" he said. Steffy disagreed. She said he had been wrong on many levels. He worried because Brooke had walked out on him. Steffy comforted him and rubbed his shoulders and neck. She promised that he was not alone, and she hugged him.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Maya and Rick told Brooke they were glad she was home. They wanted to know what Bill had done, but Brooke didn't want to discuss it. Katie showed up, and Maya and Rick left. Katie wondered what had happened. She noticed that Brooke was no longer wearing her rings. Katie hugged her. \"What did he do?\" Katie asked. Brooke looked away several times, and Katie continued to ask the question.\n\n\nBrooke talked about how she had loved Bill and seen the best in him. Brooke didn't want to tell Katie what had happened, but Katie pressed for information because she and Bill shared a son that she wanted to protect. \"Brooke, I have a stake in this. I have a right to know,\" Katie said. Brooke flashed back to her encounter with Bill when he had admitted he had committed arson. She started to cry.\n\n\nBrooke looked at Katie. Brooke babbled that it had been a tragedy that had happened at Spectra. Katie wondered what that had to do with anything. \"Oh, my God,\" Katie shouted. She realized that Bill had been responsible for the Spectra fire.\n\n\nBrooke and Katie discussed that people could have been killed and that Sally had been hospitalized. Brooke admitted that Bill's actions scared her -- terrified her because of the things he would do in order to get what he wanted. Katie and Brooke tearfully hugged. Katie said that Bill had \"a way of making you believe in him, even when you shouldn't.\"\n\n\n\n\n",

Katie walks in and realizes too that Brooke is not wearing her ring. They all want to know what Bill did to cause this. Ridge and Steffy tell Ivy that they and Quinn appreciate her stepping up. Both are happy to hear that Eric has forgiven Quinn and himself as well. And both wonder how this leaves him with Brooke. He says her break with Bill is not temporary. She has taken off her rings and is not going back. But they both wonder what he could have done to make Brooke leave him so soon. Alone Katie tells Brooke that she can see she is in pain. Whatever it is she can tell her. Bill is the father of her child so she has a right to know what he did. She begs Brooke to tell her.

Liam says at least he is not the arsonist. Bill says he is not an unreasonable man. He is willing to meet Liam in the middle for the changes he wants to make. Liam confides in him that he bought the Spectra building and then gave it back to Sally. Bill about busts a gut and says oh he feels so much better now. Sally will never be able to pay him back. Liam says it was for restitution. Bill says enough is enough; he is taking the company back. Liam looks him squarely in the eye and says that is not Bill's call, it is his and he will call the police before he turns the company back to Bill. Bill picks up the phone and dares him to do that. Liam yells at him not to force him. Steffy bursts in and tells Liam that he is going off the rails and has to stop this. Liam starts to leave and tells Bill to go or he will call security.
