    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy hugs Bill. He says he hates anyone to see him this way. She reminds him he is human and okay to be vulnerable. He thanks her for listening. She says anything she can do just ask and she will do it. Sally grabs Liam's arm and shows him some of her improvements. She says it is all because of him and he thinks it is incredible. She says again it is all because of him and she cannot thank him enough. He wonders what else does she need. She replies an architect and a builder. Katie tells Wyatt that Brooke just took her rings off. He says wow, he feels like they just got married and he cannot believe he cheated on her so he'd like to know what Brooke said. He knows that when Bill wants something he will stop at nothing to get it. And now has this whole Liam power trip on with Bill away and it makes no sense. He mentions the word fire and sees the reaction on Katie's face and asks if there is a connection. He says he thought they were close enough that she could tell him anything. She says normally yes, but this she cannot. He badgers her and says she does not have to tell him; he knows his dad must have had something to do with the fire. Steffy is glad that Bill is on the same page as Liam on some things but this one is not going to be easy. Bill says Liam is one lucky person to have such an incredible woman as she. He appreciates the support. She says the pleasure is hers. He says she is wonderful and not bad to look at. He does not know what he will do without her. Liam tells Sally that he thinks he knows a way to help her. She wants to hear all about it. He tells her that his dad still has his architects on contract and this would be nothing for them compared to what they did for Sky. She is ecstatic and hugs him, agreeing again to pay him back. Wyatt goes straight to Bill and accuses him of burning down Spectra. He does not even have to deny it as he figured it out all by himself. The only thing he did not see is that Liam forced Bill out and blackmailed him for CEO. Wyatt cannot believe Bill is letting him do this. Bill says he is not, but Liam recorded his confession when he had no idea he was being recorded. He realizes he should not have had the fire set but does he deserve to lose all of this and his wife too. There is no changing it. But a son stabbing his father in the back - that is unforgivable. He gave him everything and this is the way that Liam repays him. He will hit him so hard that he won't know what struck him. Bill says Liam does not care if he calls the police and Bill goes away for years. He wants the rooftop for his Brussels sprouts and kale instead of Bill's helicopter landing. Steffy asks Liam if he cannot just sit down and speak with Bill as he regrets what he has done and is willing to work it out. Liam says Bill will not change and talking will do no good. Bill calls and says they can work together if he can just quit this blackmail. They can go back to being a family. Liam puts the recording up to the phone and lets Bill listen to it one more time. Bill tells him okay, take the company in a new direction but he has to destroy the recording and do it NOW.",
