She tells him that she would like to know when she is going to wake up and realize that she has forgotten about him.  \n\n\nTaylor tells Gaby that she will never have her son.  \n\n\nRidge has paid his Mother a visit up at Big Bear, where she has been doing some soul searching of her own.  She informs him that she has been volunteering her time at a homeless shelter.   She thought it might be a good idea since she also feels homeless and adrift at times, especially without her family.  She claims that she is through brow-beating the people that she loves, because she has come to realize that you can't live your children's lives, that you just have to get on with your own.\n\n\nNick and Brooke tell each other that they will never stop loving each other.  She tells him that the thing she loves best about him is the fact that he is loving her daughter, Bridget, too much to betray her.\n\n\nGaby tells Taylor that no matter what she thinks, she is legally married to Thomas, and she is his wife.  Thomas and his Father made an agreement, why can't she just accept it.  She tells Gaby that what she doesn't want for her son, is a teenage marriage. \n\n\nStephanie tells Ridge that when she called the house, she found out that you weren't living there now.  She tells him that she had a long conversation with Steffy, and she told her that Brooke is now dating Dante.\n\n\nNick tells Brooke that Bridget is happy and that most times he is all right, but when he is alone, he starts thinking about her again.  He can't get her out of his mind.  He thinks about the night that she told him she still loved him and she says that she thinks about that also.  The night of the storm and how happy they both were.  She tells him that she never meant to break that promise that they made.\n\n\nSteffy and Phoebe are in the middle of a huge argument when Taylor walks in.  Phoebe tells her Mother that Steffy stole $50.00 from her and that she is doing things behind your back.  Phoebe tells her that all Steffy wants to do is be more like you.  She is doing things to be more popular.  The kids at school think that Mom is \"hot\" and Steffy wants them thinking the same about her.  \n\n\nStephanie tells Ridge that he was right, she can't blame all her problems on Brooke.  She tells him that she learned that one must grow up and lose the fear of losing.  When she was talking with Steffy, she learned that Nick and Bridget got married.  She is wondering if Ridge will email her some pictures, and he says that he will.\n\n\nBrooke tells Nick that they have to learn not to give in to each other.  From a cabin above, Stephanie walks out on the terrace to enjoy the view and her new outlook on life.  She looks out and sees two people that look familiar to her, so she gets her binoculars and looks up close.  She realizes that it is Nick and Brooke.  Brooke tells Nick that their love for each other will always be there, just not the way they hoped.  She leaves and Nick remains seated on the bench.\n\n\nRidge goes to see Taylor, but she is not in a very good mood.  She tells him that she is doing the best that she can.  He tells her that he saw his Mother, and she told him that she finally got Brooke out of her system.  Ridge asks Taylor, if she thinks that a marriage counselor could do the same for them.\n\n\nNick arrives home as Bridget is making dinner.  He is in a bewildered sort of mood.  He becomes overly passionate with Bridget, again trying to erase Brooke from his mind.\n\n\nStephanie turns up at Brooke's office.  She tells Brooke that she is not there to bother her.  She wants her to know that she feels she can be of more use to the next generation.  She tells her that she was up at Big Bear, and guess what she saw?  She saw lover, liars, cheats!!!  Stephanie tells her that she is not going to let her do this to Bridget again.\n\n\n",
