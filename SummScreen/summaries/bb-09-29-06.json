    "tvmega_recap": "Nick reaches Bridget at the hospital and learns she is having a blood test and insists on being there. He also wants to tell Brooke, he can't spend another night like this. Brooke remarks she'd like to renew her vows every single day but now she has to get to work. The lab tech, Jerry, draws blood from Bridget and she asks him to keep this just between the two of them. Nosy Felicia pops in and says she is worried what happened yesterday. Did Bridget tell her mother? She is also curious how Nick took it since he always wanted to be a father. Eric and Brooke trade banter about her being CEO at Forrester and there while Ridge is on another continent. While Felicia and Eric gang up on her and spout her safety with Nick, she informs them she did renew her wedding vows, does that tell them anything? He tells her how dear she is to them and the company, but everyone makes mistakes. What will happen when Nick makes his? She states that Nick would never hurt her. While waiting for the test results, Nick and Bridget reminisce about losing Nicole. He won't hear the word miscarry for this baby. It is HIS and will be born healthy and strong. Rock-bottom line is that life trumps everything and life has chosen them to make new life. He refuses to see this as anything but a blessing and they hug and cling to each other. She confides in him that she loved him because he made her a better person, turned her into feeling beautiful inside. It happened again just now. Jerry gives them the results - positive, baby healthy and developing well. She remarks when God answers your prayers, best not to just complain. Looks like they are having a baby. Neither know whether to be happy or sad.",
