Deacon believed that she could forgive him, just as she'd forgiven Bill, and implored her to give him a chance. The men bickered more with each other until Brooke stopped them.\n\n\nBrooke lauded Deacon for being in Hope's life and being a help to her and to Hope. Deacon wanted to be more if Brooke would let him, but she asserted that Bill was the man in her life. Deacon was sure Bill would disappoint her again but figured that she had to learn it for herself. \"I can wait,\" Deacon said. As Deacon left, Bill murmured that Deacon would be waiting a long time.\n\n\nOnce alone with Brooke, Bill asked if he could take what she'd told Deacon as a yes. Brooke claimed not to want to rush into anything, but she promised to answer Bill soon.\n\n\nLater, Bill was in his office when Katie arrived with Will for a visit. Katie called Bill evil for a squeaky toy that he'd gotten for Will. When Bill remarked that she was saying that to make him feel better, Katie asked what was wrong. She assumed it had to be Brooke, but Bill claimed that he and Brooke were fine and happy to hear that Ridge was designing again.\n\n\nBill sensed that Katie had been surprised that he knew. Katie asked if the news had made a difference to Brooke. He replied that Brooke could agree to marry him soon, and Katie noted that her sister wasn't being impulsive, which was good for Brooke.\n\n\nBill asked if Katie was happy about Ridge's improvement. Katie said she was glad about the progression, and when a person loved someone, that person signed up for whatever happened. \"Until you don't,\" Bill concluded, and in answer, Katie repeated him.\n\n\nKatie assumed that Bill thought she hated him, but she didn't. Bill asked if she was saying that there were times when she missed him. She said that she might be saying it, and he admitted that he missed her, too, at times. Katie asserted that he just missed that only meal she knew how to make, but she could teach Brooke to make it. Katie said Brooke could learn if he gave her time. \"I'm going to give her a lifetime,\" Bill declared and turned his attention to Will. Katie seemed to become sad.\n\n\nAs Bill played with the child, Katie took a call from Dani and apologized for being unable to meet up. Katie promised to meet the next time Dani was in town. Katie ended the call and looked reticently at Bill and Will.\n\n\nAt the loft, Wyatt arrived in a joking mood, and Quinn guessed that things were good for him. Quinn claimed that she'd been trying to take Wyatt's advice about concentrating on herself, but she didn't feel that she was as interesting as her son. Wyatt announced that Hope had decided to remain with her husband. Quinn squealed and hugged him.\n\n\nQuinn assumed that Hope disliked her. Wyatt said he was the one in a relationship with Hope, not Quinn. Quinn contended that she was Hope's mother-in-law, and she had a relationship with Hope. Wyatt stated that he was there to tell Quinn that her fixation with Hope had to end.\n\n\nQuinn said Wyatt didn't have to protect Hope from her, but upon Quinn accomplishing her goal, Hope had reminded Quinn of how starchy and self-righteous Hope could be. Wyatt warned Quinn not to talk about his wife that way, but Quinn questioned his right to treat her like a naughty child.\n\n\nQuinn believed she'd gotten Wyatt a wife and had spared him any blame for her actions. She said it was good to have big shoulders, and he'd learn that \"now that\" he was on his own. She offered to let Hope have her space, as long as Wyatt visited Quinn from time to time. \"Because I'm not going to let anyone forbid me from seeing my son,\" Quinn asserted.\n\n\nLater, Deacon arrived and saw Quinn putting away dishes. He asked if she planned on having VIP company. The only VIP Quinn claimed to care about was herself, and she said it was why Deacon needed to stop treating her place like a suitcase. Deacon guessed that meant Wyatt and Hope hadn't invited Quinn to live with them. Quinn sniped that her relationship with Wyatt was fine at the time.\n\n\nQuinn also relayed that Hope and Wyatt were remaining together, and Deacon said that Brooke had told him the news. Asking why Quinn had summoned him, Deacon reminded her that he wasn't a psychiatrist and didn't vacuum. Quinn asked what more Brooke had told him.\n\n\n\"She's marrying the man of your dreams -- or your nightmares,\" Deacon responded. Quinn gasped incredulously. Deacon said Brooke hadn't answered Bill, but Bill had proposed to Brooke -- again.\n\n\nDeacon noticed that something was wrong with the sink. Quinn said she'd broken it, like everything else. She asked why every man wanted to marry Brooke. He concluded that Quinn was a witch, but Brooke wasn't.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Quinn had thought Bill would do an about-face and get serious about her. Quinn questioned if Deacon had thought Brooke would suddenly become gaga over him. He contended that he and Brooke had a child together, but Quinn replied that she had the same with Bill. Deacon added that Bill had another child that Quinn had tried to kill.\n\n\nLowering her chin to her hands, Quinn revealed that she'd thought Hope would leave Wyatt, and he'd return to his mother. Quinn had cooked Wyatt an entire meal, including his favorite dessert. Deacon offered to eat the meal but realized that she'd put the whole thing down the garbage disposal. She replied that she had, and it was why the sink was clogged.\n\n\nDeacon deduced that the sink had been the reason Quinn had contacted him. \"Figured you could earn your keep,\" she responded. He asked if she wanted to cry or lean on his shoulder. Quinn shrank back with a displeased glare and said she didn't go for that kind of thing.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Quinn wanted to hear that he was lonely, too. Giving him a little constructive criticism, Quinn advised him to talk less. He stared into her eyes, and touching her arm, he uttered that he'd heard that before.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Donna told Eric about Luca's death. Eric wanted the contact information for Luca's fianc\u00e9e. Eric also asked Donna to call Thorne, so that Eric could get an update on International.\n\n\nLater, Brooke arrived at the office as Eric was concluding a phone call with Thorne and ordering Donna to get the financials for their Milan office. After Donna had left, Eric revealed to Brooke that Luca Comino was dead. \"What?\" Brooke exclaimed. Eric corrected himself and said \"presumed\" dead after Luca's boat had washed up on shore without him.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Eric had called the second in command in Milan. Eric replied that she was missing, too, and there were rumors of financial improprieties. Brooke gleaned that Eric believed the two had embezzled from Forrester and had taken off together.\n\n\nEric changed the subject to ask why Brooke had wanted to see him. She didn't think it was the right time to talk, and he joked that she wanted to block off honeymoon time. Giggling, Brooke revealed that she'd gotten two proposals that morning. Eric didn't think even that was a record for her, but he reminded her that she didn't have to marry anyone.\n\n\nBrooke claimed that the next natural step was for her to marry Bill. Eric asked what was stopping her. He noted that one didn't fall in love with another's good qualities, but one found the other's qualities good because one had fallen in love with the other. He figured that, in time, one wised up, and because of the love for the other, hoped the other would change.\n\n\nEric asked if Brooke wanted to marry Bill. Brooke did want to, but she asked if Eric always did what he wanted to do. \"No,\" Eric knowingly responded. Brooke remarked that other things factored in. He asked if it had to do with Ridge, who was the love of her life. \"Which life was that?\" she asked.\n\n\nEric remarked that people lived their lives in the same place and with the same people but would occasionally awaken and wonder who they were and how they'd gotten there. He assumed that Bill was what Brooke wanted. \"And you have him, right?\" Eric asked.\n\n\nBrooke mirthlessly smiled and said that Bill had a child with her sister. She asked if she'd be Will's aunt or stepmother. \"This isn't appalling to you, Eric? It is to everyone else,\" Brooke remarked. Eric responded that it wasn't.\n\n\nEric stated that even though he and Brooke dressed well, paid their taxes, and did everything the right way, they were unconventional people. Love and lust mattered to them, and they had little voices inside that said they wouldn't live forever. \"And every time you deny an experience that draws you so powerfully, you die a little inside,\" he stated.\n\n\nBrooke felt that Eric understood her well. Eric said he'd studied her for a long time. She'd been one of those experiences that he hadn't been able to deny himself. Brooke said he'd been that for her, too, and she kept going to him whenever she'd lost her way. He was glad for it; however, he felt that she hadn't lost her way, and she knew what she wanted.\n\n\nBrooke admitted that she had a different yearning that was at odds with her desire. Eric asked if she really worried about what people thought, and she said she feared that the people might be right. Each time she thought of having a life with Bill, she felt that it might be a mistake. \"Because of this person that I just can't -- I can't forget about,\" she said.\n\n\nEric asked if Brooke meant Ridge or Deacon, but Brooke dismissed the guesses. Eric asked who it could be. \"Well, haven't we been talking about it?\" she asked.\n\n\n\"You don't mean me?\" Eric responded. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "With Deacon looking on, Bill holds Brooke's face in his hands and says Ridge can draw again so there is no reason they can't get on with their lives. Deacon speaks up and says he has known and loved her longer and he'd like that same consideration. Gently she tells Deacon that Bill is the man in her life now. Quietly he walks out with Bill making a snide remark that he could help with some bus money. He tells Brooke he gathers that he can take that as a yes. Will she marry him? She says she does not want to rush into anything. She will give him an answer soon. Wyatt drops by Quinn's and says he came to tell her that Hope was home and that is where she is going to stay. Quinn is thrilled. He tells her this fixation with Hope has got to end so he wants her to stay away from their doorsteps. She says she does not dislike Hope and she has no fear from Quinn. She is not upset. If Hope needs her space that will be okay as long as Wyatt visits her every now and then. She will not let anyone keep her from seeing her son. Donna asks Eric is she can talk to him a bit Brooke. She is not crazy about Bill, no one is, but she wonders how long they can keep putting off getting back together. Katie brings Will to see Bill and he says he has heard the good news about the dressmaker designing again. She says she doesn't hate him and in time she could teach Brooke how to make his favorite foods. Eric has problems with the International office in Milan and tells Brooke, then asks what is her next plans. She says she had two proposals this morning and she is considering the next step by marrying Bill. Eric says she ought to just go do it. Bill is no one's favorite and we don't fall in love with people because of their good qualities, we just do. Ridge was the love of her life, her words, but every few years we wake up and ask who am I and how did I get here. She needs to do that with Bill. If Bill is who she wants though, she has him. Deacon goes back to Quinn's loft and she tells him her son was just here. Things are good and Hope is staying. She wants to know what Brooke said. He tells her Brooke did not say yes yet but Bill asked her again to marry. She wonders why every man wants to marry Brooke and yet burn her at the stake. He says she is a witch and Brooke is not. She laments she thought Hope was gonna kick Wyatt to the curb so she made him his favorite dinner complete with rotisserie chicken and pumpkin pie. She was so sure he would come home to her. Deacon says he will eat her pie and the chicken too. She explains he can't as she threw it away down the disposal so that is why it is broke and needs cleaning out. Maybe he can earn his keep. He offers his shoulder to cry on as he is lonely too. She says she is not into that kind of thing. She explains a little constructive criticism .. he needs to talk a little less. He puts his hand on hers. Eric tells Brooke that he is not appalled. They dress well, they pay their taxes, they use their turn signals when driving so they always do the right thing. But what most do not see is they are very unconventional people. Love matters to them, even lust. And they both have this little voice inside that says they aren't going to live forever. And every time she denies herself that she will die a little inside. She says he knows her so well. He says she was one of those experiences that he could not deny himself. She knows what she wants. He asks if she is worried about what other people will think. She says she is afraid they will be right. When she thinks about loving Bill she thinks it will be a terrible mistake. And then there is one she can not even think about. He asks if it is Ridge .or Deacon. She says no, hasn't he heard the talk. Then he guesses it might be him.",
