Brooke entered and wanted to find Ridge and Caroline. Thomas said they had gone for the day.\n\n\nAt the loft, Ridge apologized for the fact that his vasectomy could not be reversed. He told Caroline that he had really wanted a family with her. He wanted to watch his baby grow inside her. Ridge hugged her and said he loved her and didn't want her to sacrifice her dreams for him.\n\n\nRidge said the situation had him \"torn up.\" \"Please stop,\" Caroline said. \"You lost something too.\" Ridge didn't know what to say. Caroline said she had to process everything. She hugged Ridge and left.\n\n\nOutside the loft, Caroline called Thomas. He answered the phone half naked. Caroline said she was on her way over to see him. He told her it was not a good time, but Caroline insisted she had to see him.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Caroline made her way up to Thomas' bedroom, and she knocked. He refused to open the door, and Caroline said it was important. She begged him to open the door. Thomas complied, but he only opened it slightly, and he again advised Caroline that it was not a good time. Caroline maintained that she couldn't wait.\n\n\nThomas worried that something had happened with Ridge. A woman's voice called out to Thomas. Caroline pushed the door open and saw a woman in bed. \"Mrs. Forrester!\" Charlotte said. \"Charlotte? The intern?\" Caroline asked of Thomas. She advised Thomas that she had something to tell him, and she refused to leave until they had spoken privately.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's house, Bill had been looking for Wyatt, but he encountered Quinn instead. Quinn reminded Bill that Liam was not his only grown son. Bill scoffed that Quinn could not give him parenting lessons.\n\n\nQuinn worried that Liam had been given two titles: the vice president at Forrester and president at Spencer. Quinn wondered why Liam should have the cushy title at Forrester when Wyatt had worked there all along.\n\n\nBill reminded Quinn that Ridge had chosen Liam as the vice president. Quinn continued her rant. \"Whatever Liam wants, Liam gets,\" she dished. Quinn worried that Bill hated Wyatt because Quinn was his mother. She reasoned that Wyatt was strong and confident, ate red meat, and drank scotch -- just like Bill.\n\n\nBill argued that he loved all his boys equally, but when it came to business, Liam was the better leader. Quinn defended Wyatt and said he had been running her jewelry company since he was a teenager. Bill countered that Spencer was not a rinky-dink jewelry company. It was a major global conglomerate.\n\n\nQuinn insisted Wyatt could run either company and Bill had no faith in Wyatt because he was her son. Bill agreed her DNA was not reliable. \"Wyatt's reckless, impulsive, emotional, and he's just not as bright as Liam,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill shared that Liam would be his successor and had been appointed executor of his estate. \"Wyatt will always have a black mark against him because he has your genes. Fortunately, my other son does not,\" Bill said. He left.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Liam looked over a folder, and Steffy leaned over his shoulder. Liam worried about letting Ivy go. Steffy said that Liam was a sweet and caring guy and had a soft spot for Ivy. Liam said the downside to firing Ivy was that Ivy was a buffer between them and Quinn. \"Now we have to deal with Quinn directly, and I'm not happy about that,\" Liam said.\n\n\nSteffy thought that things were good with Quinn, but Liam scoffed and said Quinn hated him and was dangerous. He reminded Steffy how out of control Quinn could be. \"You have to keep your guard up,\" he said.\n\n\nLiam wondered where Ridge and Caroline were. Steffy didn't know, and Liam noted that she'd had reservations about Ridge and Caroline's marriage. Steffy joked that she had actively objected, but she noted that Caroline made her dad \"genuinely happy in a way I haven't seen in a long time.\"\n\n\nSteffy wanted Liam to go home with her, but Liam said he had work to do for Spencer. He promised to see her at home. Steffy left, and Quinn entered. Quinn launched into a tirade that Liam had everything. He got the girl and had a great life while his brother had been repeatedly overlooked.\n\n\nLiam countered that Wyatt had a good job and made nice money. Liam encouraged Quinn to let Wyatt's life play out on its own. \"Stop micromanaging,\" Liam advised. Quinn complained that Liam had helped anyone in distress but hadn't bothered to help and support Wyatt -- and be a brother to him. She begged Liam to rescue Wyatt from \"injustice.\" Liam looked confused.\n\n\nAt Bill and Katie's home, Bill entered and hugged Katie. He called her the best part of his day. Katie wondered why Bill was tense. He explained that he'd had an encounter with Quinn. Bill said that he told her things just to get under her skin.\n\n\nKatie had a disapproving look. She advised Bill that Quinn had a point. Liam had two very important positions, and Wyatt did not. Bill balked, but Katie quickly said she knew he loved all his sons, but she understood how Quinn might not think so.\n\n\nKatie worried that Bill had not given Wyatt the green light for a fashion house. Bill refused to pit his sons against each other in the fashion world. Katie agreed, but she pointed out that Wyatt would become more resentful.\n\n\nBill noted that the design house was the project idea she had been looking for. Bill warned that if it had happened, it would only be a matter of time before Quinn would be involved. \"I don't want her in the building,\" Katie said. She noted that Quinn was capable of anything.\n\n\nAt the loft, Ridge sat alone, and Brooke showed up. She could tell by the look on his face that he had told Caroline that he couldn't have children. Ridge admitted he had. He said he hadn't known what to say to her afterward, and Caroline had left to get some air. \"We're fine. Nothing will come between us,\" he said.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline cries with Ridge holding her and saying it is all his fault. Bill tells Quinn that he has no interest in listening to one of her grand schemes. She tells him it is always Liam. He would be moving everything he could if Liam came to him but Liam is not his only son and he needs to acknowledge Wyatt more. She is not attacking him but just making him more aware. Bill says he does not run things at FC, Ridge does, so he had nothing to do with Liam getting the position there. Quinn says she knows he is always going to hold it against Wyatt that Quinn is his mother. She can not do anything about Wyatt's genes coming from her but he has Bill's genes too so he can admire that side. Bill explains that Wyatt will never have some things because he has Quinn's DNA. But also the rinky dinky little jewelry company they ran just isn't as bright as Liam's expertise. And yes Wyatt will always have that instability because of Quinn's genes which his other son does not possess. Brooke comes in on a meeting between Thomas and Othello who are working on shots for the next showing. Brooke asks about Caroline and Ridge but Thomas thinks they have left for the day. Steffy tells Liam that she realizes that Caroline makes her father genuinely happy so she approves of their union. Caroline wipes away her tears and tells Ridge that he lost something too in the process. She leaves and immediately calls Thomas. She finds out that he is home and wants to see him right away. Thomas shakes her off and says now is not a good time. She says he will have to make it a good time, this is too important. Liam tells Steffy that Ivy is not irreplaceable but she was a buffer to Quinn and now they will have to deal with her directly. She has no working sense of right and wrong and he doesn't believe that will change. He does not trust her. Steffy will have to keep her guard up. Bill tells Katie that he never saw Wyatt. Quinn went off on him how he always favors Liam over Wyatt and he said some things to get under her skin. Katie points out that Liam does have two important positions with both companies and Wyatt is just an employee so she can understand how Quinn feels. And he repeats again that there is enough animosity between his boys without competing for titles or jobs. She says that will only mean that Wyatt will naturally feel he is always going to favor Liam. With Steffy going out, Quinn slips in and up on Liam and asks if he can be nice. She points out that there he sits yet his brother has nothing and it is not fair. Liam says Wyatt has a nice job and he has Ivy so Quinn does not have to micromanage everything in his life. She says again that he needs to support Wyatt. He rescues Ivy and stray puppies so surely he can support his own brother. Brooke drops in on Ridge and guesses that he told Caroline that he can not have children. She is sorry it went so badly. He says nothing will ever come between them but Caroline left to get some air. Meanwhile Caroline shows up to find Thomas at Eric's house. She goes upstairs and knocks on his door. He ignores her for a few minutes but finally lets her into the room where she finds a girl in his bed. He says he told her it was not a good time. She says she has something urgent to tell him.",
