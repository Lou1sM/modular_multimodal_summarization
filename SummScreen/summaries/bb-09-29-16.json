Ridge, Thorne, Rick, Steffy and Quinn keep vigil in front of Eric's hospital room. It is not until long that fingers are pointed at who is to blame for Eric's health crisis while the doctor checks up on Eric. Ridge is still adamant in his pursuit of protecting his family from Quinn and orders her to go away. Quinn ignores all of his remarks and lays down the law that as Eric's wife she has every right to stand by her husband. After being stopped by an orderly at first, Quinn storms to Eric's bedside and Dr. Andrews informs the entire family that Eric has suffered from brain hemorrhage, but is now in a stable condition. Quinn implores Eric to open his eyes. He remains unresponsive, though.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn and Wyatt rush into the room and find the Forresters bent over Eric who is lying unconscious on the floor. She pushes them aside and kneels while calling out his name. Maya calls the paramedics while Thorne listens for his breathing. Thomas says he is strong and will be all right. Quinn continues to ask what happened and tells Eric to please hang in there as help in on the way. Ridge tells the paramedics that Eric has no allergies or medications but Quinn corrects him and says he is taking blood pressure pills and a blood thinner. At the hospital the doctor looks over the chart of information and tells the family to stay put; he will give them an update as it becomes available. Wyatt wants to know what happened. Pam and Maya explain that Eric has never been this upset before but he was really hurt at all of them boycotting the wedding. He knew Ridge was behind it and really lit into him. It was an act of betrayal for Eric. Maya agrees that it was inexcusable as Eric is one of the kindest, most generous men she knows and they should have done better than this. Zende agrees that they are family and they all let him down. Both Rick and Thorne are so ashamed of themselves. Wyatt tells them that when no one showed up at the wedding Quinn even gave Eric an out, saying he did not have to marry her. She did not want him to lose his family. He would not hear of that. Now he feels like he should have been there. Maya says he was in a rough spot, caught between his wife and mother. Thomas assures Wyatt that they all are at fault. They literally broke Eric's heart and now he is fighting for his life. Steffy wipes her tears and tells Ridge that she wishes they could go back and do it over again. She knows they were doing it for Eric's own good but now he is lying in the hospital and they do not know what happened. Frantically Quinn arrives at the hospital and demands to know how her husband is. Ridge tries to hold her back and says Eric is still unconscious and there is no change. Ridge says he knows of no medical condition that could have caused this. Thorne says there was no pre-existing condition. It was just that they all hurt Eric in a place so deep that his body could not take it anymore. Ridge tells Steffy that they did not cause this; they were only trying to protect Eric and he will be okay now. Quinn asks more questions and Ridge pointblank tells her this is all her fault they are in this situation. He blocks Quinn from going into the room when the doctor says keep it to a small number. Quinn cannot believe Ridge is serious when he says he forbids it. Wyatt says he likes the sounds of that \u0096 when Eric gets better. They need to focus all their energy on willing him back to good health. Maya leads them in prayer and begs God not to take him away; they all need him. Thorne tells Eric that what they did was inexcusable and he has every right to be upset with them. He can take it; just please come back to them. Fight like the warrior that he knows he is. Quinn is finally able to barge in and says she will not be kept away from her husband. Ridge says they are going to handle this like a family. Quinn retorts like it or not she is his wife thus family. Ridge repeats again to an orderly to get that woman out of this room. With Quinn bucking that the orderly tells her that he has seen families before like this and perhaps it would be better for her to wait. Dr. Andrews tell them that Eric had a brain hemorrhage so none of them caused this. It was a weakened blood vessel and there is no way to make predictions yet. Thorne doesn't like the sound of that. Ridge bellows again to keep this woman out of the room. She replies that they cannot keep her away from her husband. She rushes to him and touches his face, lays her on his chest and begs him to talk to her and be okay. She tells the others that he was just fine this morning so what has happened to him since then.",
