    "soap_central": "\n\nBrooke had lemonade in her living room and thanked Ridge for helping her move. Ridge suggested that it might help to talk about things. She replied that she'd already talked and talked and talked. He clarified that he'd meant talk to a friend, not to the screwup. Brooke believed that she still needed to process it so she could make the right decision. Ridge said he'd support any decision that would lead her home.\n\n\nRidge said that all the room Brooke had at the house reminded him of how small his loft was. Brooke thought the loft was good for a bachelor. The commute from the beach to Beverly Hills was getting to him. He said that if she knew anyone who was renting a room, she could recommend him. \"I'm very tidy. Very clean,\" he told her. Brooke said it was too soon for that.\n\n\nRidge asked what Brooke was saying or implying. Brooke replied that she knew exactly what he was implying. \"You're saying I should move in with you, but it's too soon for that,\" Ridge responded. He said he probably would visit all the time, even though he'd see her at work. He wanted her to know that he was the person she could lean on.\n\n\nBrooke appreciated it and said they'd see each other at the house because she wanted to cut her hours at work. Ridge exclaimed that the best thing for her to do was to throw herself into work. He said she wasn't a part-timer; she was a full-time Forrester, and she always would be. Brooke said he made it sound so easy to just work the troubles away. He replied that it had worked for him each time he'd lost her.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Forrester really needed her with all the young blood there. Ridge stated that the company existed because of four people: his father, his mother, him, and Brooke. He believed that the younger people knew they had their jobs because of \"us,\" and he asked where any of them would be without the BeLieF formula, Brooke's Bedroom, or the Men's Line.\n\n\nRidge declared that Brooke was Forrester Creations, and she belonged with them. He didn't know a better place for her to be if she was feeling sad than at a place where people supported her. Ridge didn't care what Bill had done. It was enough to know that Bill had gotten an amazing gift -- Brooke -- but Bill had thrown her away. Ridge was grateful that Bill had shown his true colors before she'd gotten caught in his selfish web.\n\n\nRidge said he and Brooke had shared a lot, and their worlds were the same. They shared the love of design and the thrill of the line on the runway. He told her that she was Forrester Creations, and she shouldn't ever forget it. Brooke grinned and rubbed his chin.\n\n\nConvinced that work was the key, Brooke asked what she should focus on. Ridge suggested lingerie, but Brooke replied that Steffy was doing well with the Intimates line. He was sure that Steffy would be happy if Brooke took over because Steffy was busy being co-CEO. Squeamishly, Brooke asked if there wasn't anyone else who could do it.\n\n\nRidge said there was no one else, and the Logan he remembered liked being in the limelight. Ridge believed Bill had taken it away from her because Bill's personality sucked the life out of a room. Ridge wanted her to find her space again. \"And it would be kind of nice to see you walking around in lingerie every day,\" he added.\n\n\nBrooke announced that the truth was finally out. Ridge joked that she was making it ugly, but it inspired him. She said he didn't have to see her half-naked every day to be inspired. Agreeing, he said he just wanted her around, fully clothed or not. He wanted to be around her passion and determination -- and not just at the office.\n\n\nBrooke replied that she needed time. Ridge knew it. He just felt he'd wasted a lot of time in being foolish and reckless. He'd learned his lesson, and he wanted her back home. He'd always figured it would be the two of them at the end.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Bill asked if Steffy had really meant it about being his friend. Steffy affirmed it, and he decided he'd need to keep her around. Patting his shoulder, she noted that he hadn't been so bad out on the bike. He replied that \"Motorcycle Mama\" hadn't been so bad, either.\n\n\nBill fetched some beers from the kitchen. Steffy asked if they were drinking casually or getting drunk. He replied that he could only speak for himself. It was strange to Bill that he'd taken an afternoon ride because he was supposed to be at work, making money. She knew it was hard, but she said it wouldn't be for long. She believed Liam and Bill would work it out.\n\n\nBill asked how Steffy could be so confident, and she asked if there was any other way to be. She asked if she and \"Slick\" would go riding again the next day. Impressed that he'd earned a nickname, Bill pretended to check his schedule, which was wide open for him to ride again with Motorcycle Mama. Steffy said she didn't know if that was the best nickname for her.\n\n\nApologizing, Bill realized that he'd been insensitive. Steffy said it was okay, and she and Liam had been trying to get pregnant. \"Obviously, no luck,\" she added, turning up her drink. Bill asked where her confidence was and said it wasn't just for other people.\n\n\nBill hoped he'd get to see the kid, and Steffy stated that he and Liam would be made up by then.\n\n\nBill had imagined that he'd do the grandparent thing with Brooke. Steffy believed Brooke would be crazy not to return, and if it didn't happen, there would be another woman who'd make him forget that Brooke Logan had ever existed.\n\n\nBill asked how forgiveness was so easy for Steffy. He said she'd surpassed forgiveness to go to bat for him. Steffy replied that she wouldn't do it for just anyone. Bill guessed he was special. She repeated the word, and he sensed she wanted to say \"special kind of jerk.\"\n\n\nSteffy replied that Bill was rough around the edges, but she knew he was just a teddy bear. Bill balked at the comparison, and she changed it to grizzly bear. Steffy said the Spencers wouldn't be a family without his leadership, and she knew it because she was a Spencer. She was grateful to be one and wouldn't let the family implode.\n\n\nBill decided that he was the grateful one to have a woman as smart and beautiful as she was in his family and on his side. Steffy grasped his hand, and a strange look washed over him. Steffy stood as if preparing to go. She believed a woman was out there for Bill. In her view, it was Brooke, but if that didn't work out, Steffy was sure someone would cross Bill's path.\n\n\nAt Spencer with Wyatt, Liam asked if Wyatt wanted to do what was right instead of looking the other way and pretending that Bill was someone to emulate. Liam planned to do good things, and he asked if Wyatt wanted to be his right-hand man. \"What do you say? Shall we do this?\" Liam asked. Wyatt asked if Liam was serious.\n\n\nLiam envisioned the Spencer brothers running the place and said Wyatt's strengths made up for Liam's weaknesses. Wyatt quipped that Liam had admitted he had weaknesses. Liam said he was going in blind and could use Wyatt's help. Wyatt was leery about screwing over their father. Liam claimed it wasn't about Bill; it was about running the company with decency. Liam claimed that it was a new era, he and Wyatt were at the top, and nothing was stopping them.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Liam had really thought through running Bill's empire. \"Our empire,\" Liam corrected. Wyatt didn't want Liam to fool himself, because it was Bill's world. Wyatt said that Bill had groomed them, but they weren't even close to ready. \"Speak for yourself,\" Liam quipped.\n\n\nWyatt didn't believe he and Liam had enough experience. Disagreeing, Liam said they did, and they'd figure out what they didn't know as they went. Wyatt retorted that it wasn't a high school club; it was a multi-billion-dollar corporation, and there would be serious consequences if it failed. Liam asserted that Spencer wouldn't fail.\n\n\nDue to Liam's decisions as CEO, Wyatt wasn't so sure. Liam claimed his choices had been cost-effective. \"Dude, I've run the numbers,\" Liam said. Wyatt asked if Liam had run the numbers on buying Spectra and gifting it back to Sally. Liam believed that some gambles were worth taking for a good cause. \"Sally is not a cause,\" Wyatt replied.\n\n\nLiam maintained that Sally was a good person who'd gotten run over by their father, and good people deserved to have good things happen to them. Wyatt asked what naive people who betrayed their vengeful fathers deserved. Wyatt assumed it would be payback, and he didn't want to be Liam's right-hand man in that gamble. Wyatt's money was on Bill, who always got his revenge. Wyatt had a feeling that payback would be a \"bitch.\"\n\n\nLiam asserted that Wyatt couldn't go through life, worrying about Bill's revenge. Agreeing, Wyatt said he couldn't, and he wouldn't. As long as Wyatt didn't approve of Liam's little coup, Wyatt wouldn't be the one Bill lashed out at. Liam stated that it was Wyatt's chance to do the right thing. Wyatt, however, didn't believe blackmail was the right thing.\n\n\nWyatt believed that Bill had also been wrong, but Wyatt felt that Bill at least regretted it. \"Sure,\" Liam sardonically quipped. Wyatt insisted that Bill did and said it would be nice to hear some regret from Liam. Chuckling, Liam exclaimed that he didn't regret taking the reins from Bill. Wyatt was sure Liam would regret it because Wyatt had never seen their father so furious. Wyatt was positive Bill would get back at Liam and hurt Liam in ways Liam had never imagined.\n\n\nLiam claimed he could handle whatever Bill would throw at him. Wyatt expressed worry about Liam, who was in a fantasyland and wasn't making any sense. Wyatt insisted that Bill would never be happy about \"this,\" and Bill would never be proud of Liam for blackmailing himself into control and giving away all of Bill's money.\n\n\nWyatt implored Liam to listen to Wyatt and Steffy, who cared about Liam. \"What you're doing right now is wrong. So, please, back down. Find a way to make things right with Dad because you do not want to make him your enemy,\" Wyatt warned.\n\n\nLiam appreciated the concern, but he wanted Wyatt to calm down. Liam said that Bill could make Liam into an enemy, but there was nothing left for \"that man\" to do to Liam.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to Liam, Steffy was at Bill's house. Bill took her hand and smiled. He cupped her face with his free hand. He thanked her and said the day had been just what he'd needed.\n\n\n",
