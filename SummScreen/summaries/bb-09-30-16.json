Maya laments that it would not have it they had just gone to the wedding. Carter finds out from Pam that it wasn't a meeting but where Eric lectured them on boycotting the wedding. The doctor tells Quinn that if she is looking for something positive it is a good thing they got him to the hospital when they did and the procedures and scans have begun. They all agree that it came on very suddenly. It could be stress as he was very upset when he collapsed. The doctor says he will order another test but absolutely Eric is to have no more stress. Out of the room Steffy tells Quinn that what more could she expect. She had told everyone something bad would happen when she came into her grandfather's life. Tragedy always follows her. This was the plan. She accuses Quinn of poisoning Eric. She even barks at a nurse to be sure and test every medication or anything that Eric touched. She does not trust this woman.

And that man in there who brought so much goodness in all of their lives and gave them a safe place to grow and thrive \u0096 they shut him out of their lives completely. They were married in an empty room. A part of Eric died that day. It was cruel, insensitive and just wrong. She may not be a saint but if Eric leaves them today it is their fault, not hers. At Eric's house Carter finds an envelope with papers and remembers telling Eric about the POA. Ridge starts to leave the hospital room and says he wants to talk with Steffy and she is outside with Quinn. Thorne tells him to hold on a minute and repeat that again.

Ridge comes out and says Eric is awake. Quinn starts to go but Steffy tells her no, stay put. Ridge does say that Eric is saying Quinn's name so she does rush in. She bends over Eric and starts telling him about the beautiful wedding and they should be on their honeymoon now. She does not think this is what he had in mind.
