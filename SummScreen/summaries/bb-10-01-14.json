Brooke entered, and Katie shouted at her to call 9-1-1. Brooke pulled out her phone. Bill used the Heimlich maneuver on Will to dislodge what had clogged his airway. A coin popped out of Will's mouth, and Katie and Bill embraced Will.\n\n\nLater at Katie's home, a doctor stopped by and told Katie, Bill, and Brooke that Will was fine. After the doctor had left, they discussed how lucky they had been. Katie blamed herself for not watching Will closely enough, but Bill said it had been his fault because he had left the coins on his desk. They agreed it had been an accident.\n\n\nBrooke watched Bill and Katie interact, and she said that an accident had put things in perspective. Brooke noted that they'd had some long, complicated years, and divorce had been hard on all of them. Katie said that she hadn't always agreed with Bill's choices, but she didn't know what she would have done without him when Will had started choking.\n\n\nBill was grateful that Katie believed in him as a father. He added that it was his greatest role in life. Katie teasingly asked if it was better than being CEO. Bill laughed and agreed it had been by a long shot. Katie smiled, and Brooke looked pensive.\n\n\nLater, Bill left, and Brooke advised Katie that she planned to accept a position at Forrester in Milan. Katie was stunned and asked if Bill knew. Brooke said that she had not yet told Bill. Brooke apologized for hurting Katie. Katie noted that they had all moved on.\n\n\nBrooke maintained that Katie and Bill still had a powerful bond over Will. Brooke said she had witnessed it. Brooke urged Katie to reconsider her relationship with Bill. Brooke said she was leaving town so that Katie and Bill could have time without her in the picture. Katie looked skeptical.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy flashed back to her passionate kiss with Liam. Aly entered and asked if Ivy had heard from Liam. Ivy had not heard from him, and Aly and Ivy agreed that it was a shock that Hope hadn't returned to Liam. Aly suggested that Liam needed support. Ivy wondered why Hope had stayed with Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam entered for an appointment to write a story on some jewelry pieces. Aly and Ivy asked how Liam had been doing. Liam said the reality that he would never get Hope back had set in. Aly left. Liam said Hope and Wyatt would be attached forever. Ivy didn't understand why Liam seemed so certain that Hope would never leave Wyatt. \"Is there something more to this story?\" Ivy asked.\n\n\nIvy wondered if Quinn had threatened Hope, but Liam said Quinn had not bothered Hope. Eric texted and requested a meeting with Ivy, and Ivy left some pieces of jewelry for Liam to review. Liam sat down and flashed back to when Hope had told him she would love him forever, and no one would ever take their memories.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's beach house, Hope flashed back to her conversation with Liam about her pregnancy. Wyatt entered, and Hope thanked him for returning home when she had asked. She said someone else was moving in. Wyatt seemed surprised and added that they did not have room for Deacon. Hope said it was a little person who would arrive in about nine months.\n\n\nWyatt was thrilled, and they embraced. Hope said she was excited. Wyatt was excited that they had created a life. Wyatt thanked Hope for the best news he'd ever heard. They kissed.\n\n\nWyatt said the baby created a deeper connection for them. Wyatt reminded her that they had been worried days earlier that his mother could have torn them apart. They kissed, and Hope cried.\n\n\nWyatt left the room, and Hope received a call from Liam. Hope said that she'd told Wyatt she was pregnant. She added that she planned to stay with Wyatt. Liam said he couldn't stop loving her.\n\n\nWyatt called out to Hope from another room, and Hope told Liam that she had to let him go. Hope hung up, and Wyatt returned. Wyatt reveled in the fact that they would be a family. He wanted to turn a small office into a nursery. \"Full steam ahead,\" he said.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Fearing the worst about the current status of his marriage, Wyatt is rocked by Hope\u2019s news that will change their lives forever. Having almost experienced a great loss, Bill and Katie make an agreement to get along for the sake of their child. Brooke makes a life-changing decision about her future that affects many others.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Katie is hysterical as Bill tries to hit on Will's back and get him to cough up the coin that he swallowed. Brooke rushes in and Katie tells her to call 911 quickly. Bill continues to do his best Heimlich maneuver and finally the coin dislodges. Katie takes Will in her arms and both she and Bill are relieved. Brooke sees how they are bonding again as a family should. Ivy sits at her desk thinking about her kiss with Liam. Aly comes in and they discuss Liam with Aly saying right now he needs support and understanding. Neither can think what could have happened to make Hope go back to Wyatt. They are interrupted by Liam who asks Aly is she wants to talk about that piece for Eye On Fashion. Aly says yes but casts a look at Ivy and says she just realized this might not be the best time considering. He nervously chuckles and says reality is beginning to set in and he realizes he is not going to get Hope back. They don't understand why she can't break this hold from Wyatt. Liam says he thinks eventually they will all realize why. He thought it was their time but she made a commitment to Wyatt and now she has to honor that and there is nothing he can do. With Aly gone now he tells Ivy there is a lot more going on inside Hope than he was prepared for. There's an attachment to Wyatt that is bigger than Liam. Those two are going to be linked to forever. Ivy still is not sure why Liam is so sure. Hope is home in a reflective mood. Wyatt comes in and says he rushed home as soon as he got her message. He wonders if anything is wrong. He asks if it is Bu because he can stay. He actually likes that cat now. He's ecstatic when she tells him she is pregnant. He keeps asking if this is for real. She says yes she knew she was late but she took a test and it came up positive. They both are concerned that the other will be happy over this news. Hope says yes she is excited. He says this is the best news she could ever have told him and the greatest gift. There is no one he'd rather share this with but her. And this after just the other day he thought she was going back to Liam and he would have respected that decision. But that wasn't Hope. She believes in their relationship and their marriage. This baby changes everything. It makes a deeper connection between the two of them forever. He kisses her and wipes a tear from her eye. Katie tells Brooke and especially Bill that the last few months haven't been easy but today put it all in prospective. They need to remember what is important. They need to get along for their children. Brooke tells her they have come a long way. She's very proud of her. Bill tells Katie that he is proud of her too. She says she has not always agreed with his choices but he has been an amazing father to Will and that is all that is important to her now. He says that means a lot to him. Being a great father is his greatest goal. It's even better than being CEO, by a long shot. Back at Katie's Brooke tells her that she has done a lot of soul searching lately. She has talked to Eric and there is a high level opening in Milan and she thinks she is going to take it. Katie is shocked that she would move and wonders if Bill knows. Brooke says no; she has not told him yet. Brooke says she needs to get away and regroup. She's done some things in her life, very selfish things she is not proud of. She is sorry she let Katie down. Katie says she is past all of that. Brooke says she stole her husband. That was wrong and she is going to try to make it up to her somehow. She comments there is still a lot of love between Katie and Bill. She saw it today in the office when they bonded again over Will. But there could be more. Brooke says she is leaving town so she is taking herself out of the equation. They are a family so she just wants her to consider that. When Ivy has to go meet Eric and leaves Liam alone in the office he calls Hope. He asks if she can talk now. She says briefly. She just told Wyatt about being pregnant. Liam says she knows that he can not stop loving her. Wyatt returns to the room so Hope tells Liam that she has to go. Wyatt tells Hope full steam ahead, no turning back.",
