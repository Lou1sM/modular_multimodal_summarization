He tried to reassure her that she had nothing to worry about and that he wouldn't say anything about the accident. Phoebe was still uneasy and didn't understand why he had pretended to be the gardener to get to know her. He explained that he'd just wanted to get to know her first and become friends before he told her. Phoebe still didn't trust him completely and thought he'd chosen a bizarre way to become friends. After she left, Shane fantasized about the two of them becoming a couple.\n\n\nIn Taylor's house, Hector urged Taylor not to trust Shane. Stephanie dropped in to help plan Phoebe's 18th birthday party and wasn't happy to see that Hector was still living there. She told him that he needed to be moving out, since Taylor and Thorne were together. Hector told Stephanie that she needed to be more concerned about Shane messing things up for Taylor and Thorne.

Concerned about her mother's reaction, Bridget hoped that Nick would be able to convince Brooke that it was not the end of the world.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Jackie dropped in to see Brooke and said she couldn't believe that Brooke and Nick had renewed their wedding vows so soon. Brooke explained that they had faced some challenges with Ridge and wanted to make a fresh start. Jackie was happy for Brooke and said that she was looking forward to being a grandmother. Brooke said that she and Nick had agreed not to have children. Jackie thought Brooke should reconsider, since having a child had always been Nick's dream.\n\n\nUnconvinced, Brooke told Jackie that raising Hope would help fulfill that need for Nick. Nick overheard Brooke telling Jackie that the last thing she needed in her life right then was another child. He walked in and interrupted their conversation. He told his mother that he needed to speak to Brooke alone. After Jackie left, he prepared to break the news to Brooke. Nick began by telling her that sometimes bad news could be considered good news if one looked at in the right way.
