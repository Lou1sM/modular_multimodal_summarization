    "tvmega_recap": "Felicia joins Bridget who tells her the good news. She is pregnant and Nick is giving the news to Brooke as they speak. Stephanie and Shane continue to converse why he's staying on there and wanting nothing in return. Stephanie grills him on that night and discounts almost every detail as him concocting a story. She figures he wants money for this, and reminds him it is a crime to withhold evidence. She scares him when she says he is an accomplice after the fact. Brooke is mystified with Nick's behavior and this is going to take longer than she has, so they agree for her to come to The Marlin after her meeting. Donna barges in and essentially she wants Brooke's advice on clothes and such to help her with Ridge. Brooke is indignant that Donna expects her to help seduce Ridge and wants to be left out of it. Nick asks Harry to leave the Marlin so he can have some privacy and fills him in that he is going to tell Brooke the truth and oh yeah, Bridget is pregnant. Harry says that he's a good man who's made a mistake. He just has to hope Brooke sees it that way. Brooke comes aboard and Nick is very mysterious by casting off and she doesn't know where they are going. When he does stop, he slowly tries to tell her that he's done something he is not proud of, he's not the man he wanted to be. He needs her to dig deep inside her and find that miracle again. Thorne stops by to give Taylor flowers and Stephanie dismisses him so she can get back to Shane. He assures her he won't say a word and not interfere with Taylor and Thorne. She warns him that Phoebe is a sweet, innocent girl and he is to stay away from her or he'll never know what hit him. He vows to himself that he won't lay a hand on her precious Phoebe, but he will do a good bit more than that.",
