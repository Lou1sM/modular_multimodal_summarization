Steffy was surprised that Brooke would leave Bill and return to Ridge.\n\n\nBrooke said that Steffy had to know that she had left Bill because of what Bill had done to Spectra. \"Just to build a skyscraper,\" Brooke said. Steffy agreed it was crazy, but she wondered if Brooke was really going to return to her dad.\n\n\nSteffy noticed that Brooke wasn't wearing her rings. Brooke said she had returned them to Bill. Brooke added that Ridge had promised not to pressure her. Steffy confided that Brooke should seriously consider her choices. Brooke agreed and said she loved Bill. Steffy wondered if Brooke was truly ready to end her marriage to him.\n\n\nBrooke responded that she thought Bill was a good man. Steffy pointed out that good men made mistakes too. She asked if Brooke could think of one person she knew who hadn't made mistakes. Steffy urged Brooke to consider that if she left Bill, she could lose him forever. Steffy left.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Bill barged into Ridge's office, and Pam apologized that he had gotten past her. Bill rudely told Pam there was no need for lemon bars. Ridge told Pam he could handle it. Bill said that he wanted Ridge to respect his marriage -- and he and Brooke were working on some problems.\n\n\nRidge scoffed and said he respected Brooke. \"What did you do to push her away?\" Ridge asked. He added that Brooke had removed \"that hideous ring off her finger.\" They exchanged some more insults, and Bill said that Brooke needed a man who would fight for her. Bill vowed that he would show everyone \"what true devotion looks like.\" He said that he and Brooke would get through their problems like they always had in the past. He wouldn't allow Ridge to get in the way.\n\n\nLater Ridge showed up at Brooke's and offered to have food delivered, but she said it was unnecessary. Brooke and Ridge discussed that Steffy had been there earlier. Ridge promised to support Brooke, no matter what she decided.\n\n\n\"I'll be right here,\" Ridge said. He promised never to let her down again. Brooke looked skeptical, but Ridge claimed that life without her was miserable. Brooke smiled. Ridge added that he'd learned his lesson. Ridge joked about how they would grow old together. Brooke said she would lose her memory, and Ridge said that would be a good thing because she would forget all the bad times.\n\n\nBrooke and Ridge laughed together. Ridge promised he would take care of her when they were sitting on the porch in their golden years -- he pictured them on a porch. He added that lingerie entered the picture. Brooke was flattered. Brooke said some things never changed.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Sally and Shirley discussed that they were tired of trying to figure out what to repair first because they had to rip things up to find out what had been damaged in the fire. Liam entered and asked if Sally could join him for a business trip to San Francisco so she could meet the contractors and architects who had been placed on retainer to build Bill's dream skyscraper.  Sally's was shocked. Shirley started to comment, but Sally sent her out of the office.\n\n\nLiam explained that he had to meet the architecture firm to discuss that the tower would not be built. However, they had already been placed on a non-refundable retainer. Liam felt Sally could find a way to use their services for her renovation.\n\n\nSally was grateful. She promised to brush up on her \"architecture lingo.\" Liam added that they would dine in the best places. She said that Liam made the trip sound like fun. She thanked him for all he had done and promised to repay him. Liam smiled.\n\n\nLater, Sally told her grandmother that she was going to San Francisco with Liam. Shirley said Liam was \"handsome, extremely wealthy, and powerful.\" Sally worried what Steffy would think.\n\n\nShirley said that Steffy wanted them to be out of business. She noted that Sally seemed to \"light up around him.\" Sally said that Liam had been generous. Shirley said he was unlike his despicable father. Shirley felt Liam had feelings for Sally. \"Liam is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart. He feels something for you, too. ... Take the first steps. He's the one for you, Sally girl. I'm sure of it,\" Shirley said.\n\n\nLater, Steffy and Liam discussed that Steffy had visited Brooke. Liam wondered what her motivation had been. Steffy said she wanted Brooke to understand that if she left Bill, she might never get him back. Liam was uninterested, and Steffy promised to change the subject. She wished she could go with him on his trip to San Francisco. He wished she would accompany him, also, but he said she wouldn't like the company. He admitted that he'd asked Sally to go with him. Steffy was angry.\n\n\nLiam reminded Steffy that the architect and others were on non-refundable retainers, and Sally needed the help. Steffy fumed. She wondered why Liam felt he had to do more for Sally even after he had already given Sally a building.\n\n\n\"Why does it have to come from you? Explain that to me,\" Steffy said. She reminded Liam that he had already done way more than Sally Spectra deserved. Steffy was clearly angry.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy asks Brooke if she has decided what she is going to do. Ridge is more confident now that she left Bill because he wanted to build his Sky so badly. Now both men want her. Bill bursts in on Ridge and says he and Brooke are still married and he expects Ridge to respect that. She just needed some space and he is giving her that. He is not going to slink away like Ridge does. Grams grouses to Sally that everything is wrong. Just name it right down to the plumbing. Liam walks in and says this may be a bad time but he is going to San Francisco soon and Sally should come with him. Sally dismisses Grams so she can continue talking to Liam about her investment. Ridge tells Bill he must have screwed up royally for Brooke to dump him so quickly. Brooke tells Steffy that Bill could have built that skyscraper anywhere but he could not be beat so he had to oust Sally. She believes he is sincere that he is sorry. Steffy tells her to hold him accountable; that's the least she can do. Liam says this is not charity. He has to go see the contractors and he thinks Sally should go with him. When she is hesitant he says she can count on Grams and Saul only so much then she is going to need more help and this is where the contractors will come in. And FYI just get ready for some of the best food and scenery around. She says this is sounding more and more not like a business trip. And she still doesn't understand why he wants her to succeed so badly. He could have given her the money and then just rode off without another look. But she appreciates his passion and there are no words to thank him for going above and beyond. Ridge drops in on Brooke and says he is going to call RJ and get him to come over as Brooke is under stress. He can even call her boss and get her more time off. Gram scolds Sally if she is going to San Francisco with Liam. There are contractors and architectures in Los Angeles so no need to go all the way to San Francisco. Sally thinks it is sweet. Grams says yes it is. Liam is scrumptious and here she is going away with him. It can't get better than that. Steffy talks to Liam and he says he wants to give Brooke a chance; and it just depends on who she wants \u0096 his dad or hers. She is shocked when she brings up his trip and finds out that although she cannot go now he has invited Sally Spectra. She says he already signed over the building to her so he does not have to worry about the contractors too. He says she does; he owes it to his father to see this gets done. Ridge tells Brooke that he has learned his lesson and he does not intend to let her down again so just let him know when she is ready. She says she is flattered but he is not going to see her in her lingerie again. Sally explains to Grams that she doesn't want to get on Steffy's bad side so she does care what she thinks. Liam is a prince but a married prince. Grams says she has seen the way Sally looks at him; she lights up so if she wants him them go after him. He may not admit it himself but he wants something more out of this and Sally will have to take the first step. Steffy tells Liam that he has already done far more than he has to for Sally; far more than she deserves.",
