Nick married Bridget and it is all over with Nick and Brooke.  What they did, was to make a mistake that they rectified  with a great deal of thought.  Eric tells her that there is no shoe to be dropped anymore.  Stephanie tells him that Brooke's pantyhose is what usually follows that kind of reasoning.  \n\n\nBridget is posing for Dante, and she tells him that Stephanie is running around crying wolf.  It seems that she has something else to try to interfere with now.  Dante tells Bridget that he went to see Nick, and besides the fact that Nick considers him a pest, he believes that Bridget is right to believe in her husband and to trust him.  \"However,\" says Nick, if things start to go wrong, he wants to be the first one to be called.  Bridget tells Dante that she isn't worried about anything; ater all Nick married her, they are having a baby and looking for a house.  She tells him that no one is going to put her back on the see-saw she was on before, the one that almost made her emotionally unstable.  Dante comments that Stephanie is wrong with her accusations.  He is a man that wants to be with her and not her Mother.  Bridget comments that that makes two men, him and Nick.  \n\n\nNick and Brooke talk.  She is remembering the night on the boat.  She tells him that that memory keeps her strong.  They realize that it will be always a private moment for the two of them to share.  Brooke tries to reassure Nick that it is good that only the right people know the truth.  \n\n\nEric tells Stephanie that he was a fool for believing that she could possibly understand what happened.  Eric reminds her that she promised him she wouldn't say anything, and she darts back with the comment that he also promised to love her until death due them part.  Stephanie tells him that she is not going to allow Brooke to railroad his daughter into the same kind of life that Stephanie believes she had, like sleeping with a man who dreamed about being in another woman's bed.\n\n\nNick tells Brooke that he's given Bridget no reason not to trust him.  In fact, he keeps finding reasons for buying things for the new baby.  Jackie walks into her son's office.  They tell her to close the door and stay, because they would like to talk with her.  Brooke tells her that she knows Eric told her the truth about the night on the boat.  Brooke admits that they were going to be together, and when something happened to change all that, and then, they each took different roads.  Brooke asks Jackie if she told anybody about that night?  Jackie tells her there would be no reason for anyone to even ask, and Nick tells her that Stephanie found a crowbar to do more harm with, if allowed.\n\n\nEric tells Stephanie that Bridget is not her daughter, and she has no right to say anything.  He asks her how she would have like hearing the truth everyday, and Stephanie, who is bitter, comments that it couldn't be any worse  than thinking you loved me and then pushing me aside to sleep with a slut.  Eric comments that, yes, Brooke might have been better in bed, but what surprised him, was that she was a better mother.  Somehow, Brooke managed  to learn to put her children first, where they were more important to her than to keep her life focused on herself.  She let her children lead their own lives and they turned out wonderfully.  She is the only one that can cause a problem to Bridget.  Stephanie cannot believe that Eric doesn't see anything wrong with the fact that his daughter's mother is in love with her husband.  Eric tells her that marriage is more than love, it combines a lot of different factors like plans for the future.  \"Trust, belongs in there too,\" says Stephanie, \"along with being faithful, and it seems to me that your lusting after Brooke has made you believe that what she did was not wrong.\"  Eric starts to believe that what Stephanie is doing, is not trying to protect Bridget but getting even with Brooke.\n\n\nNick, still in his office tells his Mother that Stephanie is out to ruin his marriage.  Jackie tells them that Stephanie won't come to her, but Brooke and Nick think she might, because Jackie wanted to see Brooke and Nick together.  Brooke tells her that Bridget is better for Nick than she could ever be.  Jackie comments that Nick loves Bridget also.  She agrees that they all had to get through a lot of tough issues and she respects her for that.  She knows that Brooke will always be a part of Nick's life because she is part of their family.  Jackie vows that Stephanie won't get any information from her.  She leaves Nick's office and is on the way to drop off the wedding pictures to Bridget.  Before she leaves, Brooke warns her that Stephanie might be lurking somewhere.  Jackie tells them that she will be Bridget's dragon slayer.\n\n\nEric is after Stephanie, with horns a blazing now, because he believes that Stephanie is after Brooke for exposing her fake heart attack.  \"What about the fact that Nick is betraying Bridget, emotionally if not otherwise,\" says Stephanie.  Eric reminds her that Nick tried to marry her 3 times.  Yes, Nick and Brooke admitted their feelings but he went back to Bridget and that is where he will stay if you will just leave them alone.  Stephanie becomes irate and tells Eric, that he will be responsible for letting his daughter be in a marriage, without love, just so he can get his hands inside of Brooke's blouse again.  He warns her for the last time not to say anything or he will hate her for the rest of his life.\n\n\nBridget and Brooke find themselves alone, and Bridget tells her mother that she wants to have an honest talk with her.  She tells her mother that when she sees Nick and her together, she can tell that she still has feelings for him.  She realizes that she sees what Stephanie is talking about.  Brooke tells her daughter, that yes, she does love Nick, but for being the kind of person that he is.  Bridget tells her that every marriage is based on trust and that means that she has to put her trust into her mother also.\n\n\nJackie is leaving a note for Bridget, when Stephanie walks in.  She walks over to it, and reads it.  She realizes that there re wedding pictures in the album that Jackie brought with her.  As she looks at them, she starts to rip the pictures out, telling Jackie that this wedding should never have happened.    Jackie calls Stephanie vindictive and pitiful.  Stephanie tells her that she and Brooke deserve each other.  She probably knew about them all the time.  Jackie tells her that nothing has happened between Nick and Brooke.  She stands up for her son and Brooke, much to Stephanie's chagrin.  Jackie vows that Stephanie will not take Bridget or the baby to live with her because it is now, her family, and her grandchild.\n\n\n",
