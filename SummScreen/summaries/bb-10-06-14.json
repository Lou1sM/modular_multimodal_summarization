    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach house, Quinn chuckled, finding it crazy for Hope to think that Quinn would ever hurt her grandchild. Showing Quinn to the door, Hope said that she and Wyatt couldn't trust Quinn, who was no longer welcome in their home. \"Like hell I'm not,\" Quinn retorted.\n\n\nQuinn warned Hope to change her tune before things got ugly. Hope leaned back as Quinn leaned forward, pointing her finger, and commanding Hope to take back her filthy words. Quinn raged that Hope didn't want to know what would happen if she tried to ostracize Quinn from the family.\n\n\n\"Hey! What the hell is going on here?\" Wyatt asked as he strode up to the porch. Quinn smiled and claimed to be congratulating Hope on the baby. Quinn claimed not to blame them for still being upset with her. As Quinn spoke, Hope interrupted to tell Wyatt that Quinn had threatened her.\n\n\nQuinn denied it, but Hope insisted that it had happened. Quinn claimed that she'd been trying to say that the understood Hope's feelings and would give the couple some space. \"What? She's lying!\" Hope yelled. Wyatt said he was glad that his mother understood that Hope and the baby needed a calm and peaceful environment \"right about now.\"\n\n\nFlabbergasted, Hope stuttered as she asked if Quinn was pretending that she hadn't warned Hope that things were going to get ugly or that Hope would regret keeping Quinn away.\n\n\n\"Are you kidding me right now?\" Wyatt asked. Quinn claimed that Wyatt was the most important person in the world to her, and her grandchild would become that important, too. She said they were everything she had, and it had been extremely painful to hear that Wyatt didn't want her around. She claimed to have been begging Hope, but Hope denied that Quinn had done any begging.\n\n\nWyatt agreed to hear Quinn out, but he said that she had to respect Hope no matter what. Quinn began talking, but handing her purse to her, Wyatt said they'd discuss it later. Quinn told him and Hope to have a nice evening, and Wyatt closed the door practically in Quinn's face.\n\n\nWyatt hugged the speechless Hope and said he was sorry. It seemed to him as if he was always apologizing for his mother. Hope said it wasn't his fault; however, her pregnancy had changed things, and Quinn terrified her. He vowed not to let anything happen to Hope and the baby, but Hope felt that he could only protect them so much. \"Your mother is unhinged,\" Hope explained.\n\n\nHope appreciated all Wyatt had gone through to put up with his mother, but after what Quinn had done that evening, she couldn't be involved in Hope and Wyatt's lives. He knew that his mother could go to extremes, but he believed she'd always supported them. He asked if Hope really thought Quinn could hurt her, and Hope admitted that she did believe that it could happen.\n\n\nHope thought she'd feel safer if Quinn wasn't in the city, but Wyatt doubted Quinn would leave. Hope refused to back down, and he decided to tell his mother to stay away from them for a while. Hope didn't like cutting Wyatt off from his mother, but Hope couldn't have Quinn anywhere near the baby.\n\n\nAt the loft, Deacon lit candles and set some wine and a rose on a table set for two. Quinn stormed in, slammed her purse down, and rasped that she wasn't in the mood. Deacon asked what was wrong, and she claimed that his daughter was trying to kick Quinn out of Quinn's family.\n\n\nDeacon asked Quinn to relax, but blowing out the candles, Quinn complained that Hope was trying to get between Quinn and her family without bothering to acknowledge how hard Quinn had fought to give Hope everything Hope wanted. Deacon told Quinn that she needed to chill.\n\n\nQuinn looked around at the romantic setting and said she didn't know what was going on there. Deacon told her that living for her son and an unborn child was beyond obsessive, and he'd set up the evening because Quinn needed to shift her focus and let things work themselves out.\n\n\nQuinn scoffed at the idea of letting her son slip away. \"In case you haven't noticed, there's another guy here, trying to get your attention,\" Deacon replied. He said Quinn needed to get out of psycho-mommy mode and into dating mode. Quinn suppressed a laugh. She asked if he was saying that the right man was the answer to her troubles. \"Sometimes two wrongs make a right,\" he told her.\n\n\nQuinn figured that Deacon's words could be true -- if he agreed to help her. Deacon exclaimed that he was staying out of it. She reminded him that he knew how it felt to be denied seeing his child, but he replied that her situation wasn't like his had been. Quinn told him that he could keep things from getting worse by talking sense into Hope. Deacon asked if Quinn would actually harm Hope.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that she'd never lay a hand on Hope. Deacon agreed to try with Hope but made no promises about the outcome. She thanked him, and they kissed. He insisted that whatever they had between them had to stay secret because Hope wouldn't forgive him if she found out. Quinn replied that it would be their secret, and he kissed her more deeply.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Liam was worried about Hope's \"monster-in-law,\" but Ivy doubted Quinn would hurt Hope and the baby. Liam said the pregnancy meant that Hope was stuck with Quinn forever, and he hoped that getting her way thus far would make Quinn see no point in hurting Hope.\n\n\nAly watched Ivy and Liam on the terrace, and Oliver called Aly's matchmaking cute. John asked Pam, Eric, Oliver, and Aly how serious things were with \"Prince William\" and Ivy. Eric said the pair was just beginning, and Oliver added that it seemed to be going well.\n\n\nEveryone sat in the living room, and John urged \"Ricky boy\" to let the kids handle Forrester Creations while he traveled with John. Eric said he couldn't to do that. John insisted that Eric make it Down Under for a visit, and Eric said he'd like to do that.\n\n\nAs Liam listened to the men, he smiled. Ivy said it was nice to see a smile on his face. Liam stated that he was having a good time, and he loved meeting her father. \"Never a dull moment,\" Ivy replied.\n\n\nJohn flirted with Pam. Eric warned his brother to cool it. Charlie was steamed as John said he couldn't help it, and it had taken several marriages for him to learn that he could look but not touch. \"John, you're touching,\" Charlie said. John laughed naughtily and moved his hand off Pam's hand. Charlie rolled his eyes.\n\n\nLater, John noted that the eyes on Stephanie's portrait seemed to follow him. Handing a martini to John, Eric said he'd been drinking two of them a night, but he'd decided to give Stephanie's to John. John asked if she'd mind, and Eric replied that she'd let them know if she did. John doubted the portrait helped Eric in the ladies department. Eric said each time he'd kissed a woman in front of \"her,\" the portrait had crashed to the floor. John thought it was a good joke, but Eric said he was serious.\n\n\nJohn moved on to talk to Liam. Handing Liam some Russian vodka, John began to describe the kind of man he wanted for his daughter. Liam assumed John would want a man like himself, but John disagreed and said that she should not have a rogue like he was.\n\n\nAcross the room, Ivy was worried about Liam and her father's conversation. Aly prodded Ivy to listen in, and she did so as Liam was relaying that he'd just gotten out of a serious relationship that had ended with his love marrying his brother. John slapped Liam's arm and called it a tough break.\n\n\nLiam said Ivy was helping him through it, and there was something about Ivy that put people at ease. He felt that Ivy had been supportive of him, but he'd only been able to offer her a friendship. Things were changing for Liam, and he believed that he'd be lucky if Ivy was still interested in him.\n\n\nLiam recalled Ivy kissing him on the cheek when they'd been on the bank of the Seine, and since then, he'd had a feeling about her. Liam turned to thank John for raising one of the finest women Liam had ever met, but Liam stopped talking when he saw John slumbering on the sofa. Ivy, who'd heard Liam's words, smiled to herself. \n\n\n",

Having to shift the focus of his affection, Deacon makes his move on an unsuspecting target. Charlie is less than thrilled when he senses that he has competition for Pam\u2019s attention. Liam is put in an uncomfortable position when John asks about his intentions towards Ivy.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hope repeats again to Quinn that she is protecting her child and she wants Quinn to have nothing to do with the baby. Quinn acts shocked and says the baby is blood kin and she would never harm it. Hope tells her that she does not trust her and neither does Wyatt. She opens the door and says she is only going to say it one more time. She is not welcome here. Quinn tells her like hell she isn't. She says Hope can not keep her from her son or grandchild and so if she doesn't change her tune quickly things will get ugly around here. She knows her son would never say those things. Hope says they need to curb this to another time. Quinn says no, they will settle it right now and she will not leave until Hope takes back every filthy, disgusting word she said. This is not a game and she can not shun her from her family. And Hope won't want to know what will happen if she tries. Wyatt comes home and immediately wants to know what is going on. He asks Hope if she is okay and then his mom what is she doing. Quinn immediately goes into her mode of just coming over to congratulate Hope. Wyatt says he and Hope need some time alone. Hope tells Wyatt that she explained to his mother that she was uncomfortable around her and then Quinn threatened her. Quinn denies it and says Hope did not let her finish. They argue and poor Wyatt is caught in the middle. Quinn says what Hope said was very hurtful but out of respect she will back off. Hope tells Wyatt Quinn is lying again right now. Quinn tells Wyatt that he is the most important person to her and she was just begging Hope to not cut her out of their lives. Wyatt tells her that he will hear her out, but she has to understand that Hope is having his baby and she has to respect her. Wyatt shows her the door and says they will discuss it later. John tells Eric that the fashion industry is exciting, but there is a whole other world out there. Eric has more money than Trump and he can travel anywhere he wants, they can go together. He could come down to Australia and do some catching up. Eric says he would like that. Liam tells Ivy that he has enjoyed being here and meeting her dad. He is the life of the party. Charlie brings out more lemon bars. John says they are the cat's pajamas and he will take a dozen to go. He says he has to get his order in before she goes global. He flirts outrageously with Pam while Charlie glares at him. Pam tells Charlie not to be jealous. He says he can't help it. John likes her \"cupcakes\" too much. Ivy and Liam discuss the situation of the mother-in-law from hell that Hope has now. But Ivy doesn't think Quinn will really harm Hope as Wyatt would never forgive his mother. Oliver thinks it is cute that Aly is playing cute little matchmaker for Ivy and Liam. John calls Liam Prince William when he spies him on the terrace with his daughter. He asks Aly if he should hide his wallet. Weddings aren't cheap. John whisks Liam away and pours him some fine Russian vodka. He tells him to sit down. He says that daughter of his is his pride and joy and he just wants to make sure she ends up with a good guy. Liam says he understands, one like good old dad. John says good lord no, he's a bon vivant and Liam strikes him oddly as a genuine type fellow in this spray- tanned city. Quinn comes home and finds candles, wine and a single rose. It takes her a minute to figure it out but she tells Deacon she is not in the mood. She tells him that his sweet little daughter is trying to kick her out of the family. Wyatt laments to Hope that it seems he is always apologizing for his mother. She says she knows and it is really not his fault what his mother does. But she frightens her and does not know what to expect of her next. She knows Wyatt would never let his mother harm them but says his mother is unhinged and that is putting it nicely. She says Wyatt is wonderful putting up with Quinn's behavior. But after what happened tonight she just can not be a part of their lives. She will not back down on this. Wyatt says he will speak to his mother again and tell her to give them some space. Deacon tells Quinn just to sit down and relax, chill out. She rants that she did all she did to get Hope and Wyatt together and she doesn't get it. Deacon says her living her life for her son and unborn grandchild is a little obsessive. If she would just give Wyatt and Hope some space this will all work out. And in case she hasn't noticed there is another guy who is trying to get her attention. If she would just look around and get out of the psycho-mommy mode and into the dating mode. She asks if this is a date and if having the right man around is the answer to all her problems. He says two wrongs might make a right. She says two wrongs can make a right if he will help her. He's Hope's father so perhaps he can get through to her. He wants to stay out of it. She reminds him there was a time he wasn't freely allowed to see Hope so he knows how it is to be kept from his family. He finally says if she will not hurt Hope or the baby he will try, but no promises. He kisses her and says whatever this is must stay between the two of them. If Hope knew she would never speak to him again. She coos that it will be their little secret. He kisses her again. Ivy thinks her dad and Liam have been outside a long time. Aly convinces her to walk over behind a plant and listen. Ivy hears Liam tell John that it has been a real pleasure getting to know his daughter. He explains that he just got out of a very serious relationship but Hope ended up marrying his brother. John says she jilted him, that's a tough break Romeo. Liam goes on and on about how Ivy has been there for him. She's easy to be around and puts him at ease. He felt it when she gave him a little kiss in Paris. He realized them just how special she is. She's kind and bright and funny and he wants to thank John for raising one of the finest women he has ever met. He looks around and John is snoring on the couch.",
