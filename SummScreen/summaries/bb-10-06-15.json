He had tears in his eyes. Caroline said she had hoped that she could forget all about that night with Thomas like it had never happened because she couldn't remember it. \"But now you're pregnant,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nRidge asked if Thomas knew, and Caroline said that only Ridge knew. Ridge asked again about the night with Thomas. \"Tell me what he did to you,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nCaroline recounted her memory of the evening. She said that Thomas had called her after she'd left Ridge, and she had been hysterical. Thomas had been concerned about her and visited her. Ridge understood that she thought of him as a friend who had wanted to help her. Ridge noted that everything had been good and right between them, and everything had gone wrong.\n\n\nCaroline defended Thomas. He didn't know that she had taken pills, and she had followed it up with a lot of wine. And Thomas had been drinking, as well.\n\n\nRidge told her to stop defending Thomas. \"Look at me,\" Ridge said. He added that Thomas had said horrible things to him. He knew that Thomas wanted to hurt him. \"He slept with you because he wanted to hurt me. He did. He broke my heart,\" Ridge said.\n\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Caroline asked. Caroline said she would go away. Ridge refused to lose her because he had almost lost her once, and he couldn't do it again. \"We can figure this out. You shouldn't have to go through this,\" he said. He asked what she wanted to do because they did have options.\n\n\nCaroline wanted to keep the baby because many people tried for years and never had children. She worried that it might be her only chance. Ridge agreed. \"We're having a baby,\" he said. He added that they would raise it as their own.\n\n\nCaroline marveled that Ridge would do that. Ridge said he wanted something good to be the result of the situation. He promised they would be okay. Caroline agreed. Ridge smiled. Caroline wondered how they would tell Thomas.\n\n\n\"He's never gonna know about this baby,\" Ridge said. Caroline argued that they couldn't keep that kind of news from him. Ridge disagreed. He said that he had married her and promised to take care of her. \"You're my wife, and that's our child,\" he said.\n\n\nRidge said that Thomas was incapable of being a father. He stressed that the night that Thomas had been a \"friend\" to her, he had taken advantage of her. Thomas used women and interns and hit his father. \"He's a child himself,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nRidge understood that it was not the perfect dream for either of them, and he didn't want to raise his grandchild. \"But I'll do it for you. I'll do it for us,\" he promised. He added that he would love the baby with everything he had.\n\n\nRidge sat down and cuddled Caroline. He promised fairy tale possibilities, and he insisted that Thomas would not be a part of that life. \"Or anywhere near you,\" Ridge said. He reminded her it was \"our child now, our secret. Say yes,\" Ridge said. Caroline looked at Ridge and agreed. \"This is our baby. Thomas will never know,\" she said. They hugged.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Charlotte and Thomas kissed in an office. Charlotte worried about how embarrassed she would be the next time she saw his dad because she had seen Ridge at the Forrester mansion when she had been with Thomas and shouldn't have been. Thomas told her not to worry.\n\n\nCharlotte suggested their next meeting should occur at her place. Thomas agreed and held her hand. She turned to leave, but Steffy entered and overheard some of the conversation. Steffy advised Charlotte that she shouldn't be there with Thomas. Charlotte told Thomas she would call him later, and she left.\n\n\nSteffy chastised Thomas for creating a war with their father over an intern. Steffy advised Thomas not to answer if Charlotte called because it was inappropriate. She wondered what was wrong with him that he was hooking up with interns and punching their father. Thomas advised Steffy not to worry about him.\n\n\nMonica entered and delivered fabric samples. She said that she was glad to have both of them back from Paris and working together. She knew their father was proud of them. She left, and Steffy told Thomas she understood that it was hard to get past old wounds, but they were both lucky.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that Thomas had to apologize. She reminded him that they had both been extremely vocal about their father's romance with a woman half his age, but Caroline and Ridge were clearly happy and ready to start a family. Thomas agreed, and he said he wanted to be a part of Ridge's new family. Thomas said he originally had worried that Ridge would string Caroline along and then leave her, but he was glad he had been wrong. Steffy advised Thomas to apologize and stay away from interns.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Eric met with Wyatt and Ivy. Eric wondered what had happened between Ivy and Steffy. Ivy explained that Steffy and Ivy had become enemies the night that Aly had died. Eric couldn't understand why, and Ivy explained that they had argued.\n\n\nIvy didn't tell Eric the truth about everything that had happened. Instead, she insisted that they were cousins and family, and she wanted to remain a part of Forrester Creations. \"My last name is Forrester, too,\" Ivy said. She admitted that she had lost Steffy's trust but wanted to regain it.\n\n\nIvy was upset that she had been kicked out of her own family's company. Eric understood that she wanted him to intervene and go over Steffy's head. He told her that he no longer had a position at the company, but Wyatt argued that he was the company. Eric agreed he would speak to Steffy. Ivy hugged him, and Wyatt smiled.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells Ivy that Aly's death was an accident so how does Steffy fit in on this. Ivy fills him in. She knows Ivy had some trouble in the past and she and Steffy were not getting along. They could have done things very differently. They were family and she tried but Steffy will not hear of it. Her last name is Forrester too but Steffy seems to forget that and won't budge. Eric asks if she wants him to go over Steffy's head. Steffy catches Thomas kissing the intern and chastises him for doing something inappropriate and then punching his dad in the face. She does not know why he is acting like this. Thomas says he wants to focus on now and not his entitled dad telling him what to do. Ridge is floored that his beautiful wife is pregnant by his son. He asks two questions \u0096 does Thomas know? And tell him about that night again and make him understand. He figures Thomas slept with her, because he knew it would hurt Ridge. Eric says he does not hold the title anymore. Wyatt reminds him that he is the title above all else. Ivy says her dad spoke of him often and showed him pictures of all of Eric's accomplishments, so moving to L.A. was her ultimate. And she hates to put this all on Eric but he needs to know how much this means to her. Steffy suggests to Thomas that he go to his dad tomorrow and apologize. So stop hooking up with interns and punching Ridge in the face and he will come around. Ridge laments to Caroline that they are married and having a baby so they can raise it as their own. She gladly agrees but then wonders about Thomas. Ridge says he never has to know. Eric tells Ivy that she is his niece and a Forrester so while he does not understand it all he will talk with Steffy. Steffy tells Thomas that she thought their dad was through raising a family but now he is married to a girl half his age so this is what happens. Caroline says they can not do that, keep Thomas from knowing about it. Ridge says he married her and told her he would take care of her and that means a kid, even Thomas's. She is his wife and that is their child. She needed a shoulder to cry on yet Thomas came over and gave her more than that using women as usual like interns and models. Thomas is not able to be faithful and must never know of this. It is not either of their dreams but he will do it for her ..for them. Thomas will not be part of this life. It is their child now. All she has to do is say yes. She nods yes, Thomas will never know. She cradles herself in his arms.",
