    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the loft, Ridge and Caroline got ready for work, and Ridge reminded Caroline that Thomas could never know about the baby. Caroline didn't want to go to work. She felt they could work from home and give themselves time to process everything that had happened. Ridge refused. He wanted everything to seem normal.\n\n\nRidge told Caroline he wanted to make everything right \"for that innocent little baby inside you.\" He encouraged her to \"stick to the plan.\" They embraced.\n\n\nOn the rooftop at Forrester, Liam sat at a table. Quinn entered and sat across from him. He encouraged her to sit at another table, but she refused and said if she sat at another table, he would accuse her of stalking.\n\n\nQuinn told Liam that she missed Ivy. Liam was surprised, but Quinn explained that Ivy was an artist, and she and Ivy had learned to respect each other. They had bounced ideas off each other. Liam wondered why she couldn't bounce ideas off Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn launched into her tirade of how Wyatt should be busy with a leadership role at Spencer or Forrester and have more pressing matters than making jewelry. Liam rolled his eyes, and Wyatt showed up. Wyatt asked what they were talking about, and Quinn quickly responded it was Ivy.\n\n\nWyatt told Quinn and Liam that Ivy was downstairs, working on getting her job back. Quinn was pleased, and Liam was surprised. Liam felt Ivy would never return.\n\n\nQuinn noted that Steffy and Ivy could learn to get along again just as Ivy and Quinn had. \"I pushed Ivy off a bridge. She hated me for very good reason, but we learned to respect each other as artists,\" Quinn said. She noted that Ivy was looking for a second chance. Quinn left.\n\n\nWyatt dished that Ivy and Eric were there to visit Steffy. Liam presumed Wyatt and Ivy had encouraged Eric to visit Steffy on Ivy's behalf, but Ridge was the CEO, and Steffy was the president. Wyatt reminded Liam that Eric had founded Forrester Creations. \"He still has influence,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nLiam countered that Steffy would never trust Ivy again. Liam guessed that Ivy had not told Eric the whole story about blackmailing Steffy. Wyatt grew quiet. Liam added that Eric would never side with Ivy over Steffy.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Thomas worked hard on the new lingerie line designs, and Steffy entered. She ignored Thomas, and he said he would apologize to their dad. He promised that Ridge would get over their argument. Steffy told him not to waste time waiting to apologize.\n\n\nEric entered with Ivy, and Eric asked Thomas to leave. Thomas complied. Eric told Steffy he did not understand why Ivy was no longer working at Forrester. Steffy refused to discuss Ivy's employment, and Steffy assumed that Ivy had begged Eric to intervene on her behalf. Eric reminded Steffy that Ivy was family, and he had promised her parents that he would take care of her. Steffy refused to rehire Ivy.\n\n\nIvy begged Steffy to allow her to return and prove that things could be different. Steffy refused and told Eric that the situation was more complicated than he realized. Steffy told her grandfather that Ivy had blackmailed her. Eric looked surprised. Steffy and Ivy stammered about the evening that Aly had died.\n\n\nSteffy explained that Aly had tried to hit Steffy with a tire iron and had then tried to kill her with a rock. Steffy had hit Aly with the tire iron in self-defense, but Ivy had had a video that had not shown that Aly had attacked Steffy after trying to run Steffy over with her car.\n\n\nSteffy dished that Ivy had blackmailed Steffy and had said she would go to the police with the video. Eric asked about the video, and Ivy admitted she had deleted it. Eric wondered why Steffy hadn't told the police, and Steffy said she had been freaked out the night Aly had died and realized that if she changed her story, no one would believe her.\n\n\nIvy interrupted that she had overreacted, but Aly had been her best friend. Arguing ensued between Ivy and Steffy. Eric told them to stop. \"This is inappropriate and disturbing. You both need to let this go and move on,\" he said. He added that they had to rebuild trust, and it would take time, but Aly loved the company and her family. Eric ordered Steffy to allow Ivy to return to the company.\n\n\nSteffy hesitated, but she acknowledged that Eric had the ultimate voice. Ivy promised to respect Steffy's authority. Ivy thanked Eric, and he insisted that they would get along and move forward. Eric left.\n\n\nIvy thanked Steffy and said she knew she had a lot to do to earn Steffy's trust. Steffy said she was glad to hear it. Steffy eyed lingerie designs on the drawing board and said she had an idea for how Ivy could prove herself.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Thomas sat and scanned the room. He looked at photos of Caroline and briefly recalled their romantic tryst. Caroline and Ridge entered. Caroline stopped. \"Thomas!\" she proclaimed, stating that it wasn't a good time. Ridge, with a banged-up eye from when Thomas had hit him, glared at Thomas.\n\n\nThomas noted that Ridge's eye looked bad, and he stammered apologies. Caroline told him it was not the best time to apologize. \"I know you're angry,\" Thomas said. Ridge was clearly beyond angry. He told Thomas that what he had done \"would not go away with a couple of 'I'm sorry's.\"\n\n\nThomas admitted that he'd lost control and lost his temper. He added that things had been building up for a long time, but he had hoped to reconnect with his father the way that Steffy had. Thomas reminded Ridge that he had been hurt many times as a child, and he had pulled it all up at once and overreacted by hitting his father. Thomas recalled that Ridge had destroyed his first designs when he had returned to Los Angeles.\n\n\nRidge mocked him. \"What I did hurt your feelings?\" Ridge asked. Thomas said he would take responsibility, and he had overstepped. \"You stepped way out of bounds,\" Ridge said. Caroline tried to tell Thomas to stop and return at another time, but he continued.\n\n\nThomas said that Ridge was looking at him the same way he always did when he was angry. He wanted to take it all back. Ridge agreed he should be ashamed of himself. Thomas begged Ridge to get past it. He didn't want them to harbor resentment any longer.\n\n\nThomas asked for Ridge's forgiveness. Ridge glared at him. \"I don't even know who you are anymore,\" Ridge said. \"I am your son,\" Thomas said emotionally. Ridge noted that Thomas had wanted to join the design team in Los Angeles, but plans had changed. Thomas was needed in Paris.\n\n\nThomas was confused. He had worked hard on the collection and wanted to finish it. \"My wife and I will finish the collection,\" Ridge said coldly. He told Thomas to pack his bags because he would be on a plane that day.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "It's a little frosty in the office and Thomas asks Steffy if this is the way it is going to be now. She is not sure; depends on if he has apologized to his dad. He says not yet but he's been working on the new line and that is why he is letting her present it to Ridge and not him. She says his problem with their dad has nothing to do with the collection so meet up with him today, apologize and get past it. He says his own dad has made more than his share of mistakes. And he did not pink slip Thomas or disown him, so he will get over this. Caroline tells Ridge all she wants is him and to have a family. He says that is just what they will do then .everything he promised her but Thomas can not know about this baby. Eric tells Ivy that surely she did not think he would march in and tell Steffy to give her job back. He wants to broker a truce and have them both in the room at the same time. Ivy says Eric said he would plead her case and she can not ask for more than that. Thomas excuses himself when Eric walks in and tells Steffy they need to talk. He still does not understand why Ivy is no longer working at FC. On the Sky Lounge Quinn sits down with Liam. He motions there are other seats besides these. She says she did not want others as he might think she was stalking him and go whine to his girlfriend. She is confident of her designs but she misses Ivy's creative input. Wyatt walks out and hears his name and comes over. He tells them that Ivy is with Eric as they speak getting her job back. Quinn says she knows she pushed Ivy off the bridge and she hated her for a long while. But now Ivy trusts her and they work well together. Now Ivy is on the other side and looking for a second chance. Liam reminds them that Eric is practically retired so do not look for too much help there. Wyatt says Eric still has a lot of influence around here. Liam doesn't think Ivy has much a chance once Eric knows what Ivy did for Steffy to fire her. Eric, Ivy and Steffy all have their say but Steffy says Ivy does not have to apologize to her, the answer is still no. She can not work with Ivy. Eric says but Ivy thinks she can. Steffy says no because Ivy was blackmailing her. In her defense, Ivy says she was just trying to get justice for Aly. Steffy tells her version how that night Aly tried to run her down with her car, then attacked her with the tire iron and they fought over it. Then Aly picked up a rock and was going to hit her over the head with it. She fell at this point and Steffy said she freaked out and swung at her with the tire iron. It happened so quickly but she never meant to hurt her. And Ivy recorded all of this on her cell phone. And she threatened to go to the police if Steffy did not do as she said. Eric asks about the video and Ivy says she deleted it. She knows she took this too far, but Steffy wasn't the only one traumatized. Aly was her best friend. The real tragedy is Aly's death not this rift and she is now trying to fix it. All Steffy needs to do is give her another chance. Eric hears enough and says this is ending. What happened was inappropriate and disturbing but they need to stop now and get past this. He knows it is hard to build trust, it will take time but he wants them to let this go right now. Aly was family and this is what she would want. He orders Steffy to give Ivy her job back. Thomas tries to apologize to Ridge but Ridge says that a couple of I'm sorry's is not going to do the trick. Thomas tells Ridge that he lost control. This has been building up for a while and he could not hold back. Ridge says he knows; Thomas wanted his shot and he got it. He finally got his attention. Thomas says things were said and old wounds opened up. But that is no excuse and he was disrespectful and he is sorry for that. Caroline says perhaps he should come back later. Thomas says no, he does not want to drag this out. He reacted in anger and his emotions took over and he is ashamed of that. He overstepped and now he wants to apologize. Ridge says they have had their father and son problems but he does not even know him anymore. And he is needed elsewhere \u0096 Paris. Thomas is shocked that this is coming out of the blue and they have never talked about it. Ridge says he and Caroline can finish the collection so Thomas needs to go home and pack and leave for Paris today. Steffy tells Ivy that Eric has spoken and she will do as he says as long as Ivy respects her authority. Eric tells her that he is proud of her. Sincerely Ivy says she will not take this for granted. She will respect Steffy's position. She knows she has to prove herself so she will do whatever Steffy wants her to. She is willing to do anything to make FC as successful as it can be. Steffy says she is glad to hear that. She thinks she knows exactly what Ivy can do.",
