He saw no reason to return to Paris at that point. \"You're the reason!\" Ridge bellowed.\n\n\nRidge seethed that the reason was Thomas' total disregard for anyone but himself. Thomas had a sinking feeling it was about more than the punch. He asked if it had to do with the intern. Ridge figured that Thomas had so little respect for women that he wasn't ashamed of the intern incident. Thomas stated that it hadn't been his smartest move, but he was sure there wouldn't be a lawsuit.\n\n\nRidge asked if Thomas would smile his way out of it. He said that actions had consequences, and it was time Thomas learned it. He was done with Thomas wreaking havoc on the company and people he cared for. Ridge was done with Thomas hitting Ridge for saying something he didn't like.\n\n\nThomas wanted to make up for it, but he felt he couldn't do it from Paris. He said their work and their teamwork was only the beginning. Ridge replied that they couldn't work together anymore. Thomas asked if it was the punch or sex with the intern. Ridge stated that sex was just another thing Thomas took. Thomas asked where Ridge's rage stemmed from and said the punishment didn't fit the crime.\n\n\nRidge agreed that it didn't, but to him, it was a start. Ridge declared that what Thomas had done would have a lasting effect, and Thomas needed to leave. Thomas guessed Ridge was right. Thomas wanted to be there, but \"if my own father doesn't want me here...\" Thomas asked Caroline, who'd been skulking in the corner by the sofa, to weigh in, but she cut her eyes away.\n\n\nRidge left to check on the jet, and Thomas told Caroline that it was crazy. In a hushed tone, he asked if she could change Ridge's mind. \"No,\" Caroline quietly bit out. From the aloof way she was acting, Thomas sensed that something else was going on. He asked if Caroline had told Ridge about the night Thomas and Caroline had been together.\n\n\nCaroline said that Thomas had hit Ridge. Thomas wished he could take it back. He said Ridge couldn't know about the night that hadn't been supposed to happen. He asked Caroline not to leave him hanging and wondered how he could persuade Ridge. She told Thomas to stop fighting the inevitable. She stated that Ridge didn't want Thomas there, so he should do as Ridge said and leave.\n\n\nThomas left the office. Standing by the elevator, Ridge said the jet would be ready. Thomas apologized and conveyed that he should never have swung at Ridge. Ridge stated that it had been just one thing Thomas shouldn't have done. Thomas added that he'd been wrong about the intern.\n\n\nThomas believed that Ridge was right, and Thomas needed time to reflect and reevaluate. He offered to return whenever Ridge wanted because he believed he belonged on the design team. He knew it couldn't happen then, but he'd be ready when Ridge was. Ridge said Thomas should pack.\n\n\nThomas held the elevator for Ridge, but Ridge stated that he'd wait. Ridge studied his phone as Thomas said that was it. \"That's it,\" Ridge repeated without looking up.\n\n\nCaroline approached as the elevator doors closed, and she walked back to the office with Ridge. Ridge said he hadn't planned on doing what he'd done, but he hadn't been able to look at Thomas. It had been hard not to throttle Thomas. Caroline said it was probably for the best.\n\n\nRidge emphasized that it was for the best because Thomas had taken advantage of the compromised Caroline. Ridge couldn't forgive Thomas. \"It's my son, you know...My boy. I can't even look at him,\" Ridge sadly said. Caroline hugged Ridge from behind.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Liam and Wyatt pondered whether Steffy would give Ivy back her job. Liam noted that Wyatt was protective of Ivy. Wyatt stated that someone had to be, and Liam still had the power to hurt her. Wyatt didn't want Liam giving Ivy any trouble about the video and ordered Liam to be nice, something Liam was supposed to be good at.\n\n\nEric arrived and announced that Steffy had rehired Ivy. He assumed the men knew about the issues with the video, Aly's death, and the blackmail. He said it was a shame that no one had told him any of it because they could have nipped it in the bud sooner. Liam asked if Steffy had been upset that Ivy had gone over her head. Eric said it had been that way at first, but she'd respected his wishes.\n\n\nEric felt that Ivy belonged at the business, and Liam agreed. Wyatt asked if Liam meant it. Liam replied that Ivy was a great person who'd gotten lost for a minute, which could happen to anyone.\n\n\nEric felt that they needed to practice forgiveness and compassion. He wanted Aly's death to be a reminder that anyone could be taken at any time without a chance for a fresh start. Liam hoped it was the chance for them to perform as a cohesive Forrester team.\n\n\nEric left, and Wyatt asked if Liam was surprised that Steffy had forgiven Ivy. Liam claimed to be proud and said that given enough time, the sometimes hotheaded Steffy would let go. Wyatt didn't think Steffy was the type to forget. Liam replied that forgetting and forgiving were two different things, and Wyatt, who didn't know Steffy, couldn't accurately assess how she acted when she had a grudge.\n\n\nWyatt relayed that Ivy had dealt with enough. Liam was sorry that he'd hurt Ivy, and he was glad Wyatt had softened the blow. Wyatt said that it only mattered that things had worked out. In his view, Ivy deserved her place there, and he hoped Steffy didn't make Ivy jump through hoops to keep it.\n\n\nLiam believed Wyatt liked painting himself and Ivy as victims. Wyatt didn't think Liam wanted to go there and reminded Liam about the Forrester \"kumbaya\" they'd agreed to have. Liam asked why Wyatt had to assume the worst about Steffy. Wyatt asserted that it was not farfetched to think that Steffy would put Ivy through the paces; it was the fundamentals of payback. Liam stated that Steffy wasn't like that. \"Yeah. Okay,\" Wyatt quipped.\n\n\nIn the design room, Steffy asked if Ivy was ready to jump in and prove herself. Ivy was eager to do so. Steffy showed Ivy a lingerie sketch. Ivy loved it but didn't think the opinion of a jewelry designer mattered. Steffy hoped she hadn't led Ivy to believe her opinion didn't matter, and she said it would be preferable if Ivy actually liked the product.\n\n\nIvy assumed Steffy wanted jewelry accessories for the lingerie line, and Ivy made some suggestions. Liking the ideas, Steffy said she'd pass them on to Quinn because Ivy would be busy with a new assignment -- if Ivy was willing to be a team player.\n\n\nSteffy wanted Ivy to be a new face of Forrester -- for the lingerie line. Ivy wasn't excited about the idea, and Steffy stated that Ivy had wanted to be the Face of Forrester. Ivy said she'd imagined herself doing it in clothes. Steffy claimed that lingerie was clothing. Ivy had thought Steffy was \"repping\" the bedroom line. Steffy said she was too busy and had a corporate image to uphold.\n\n\nSteffy called it a tremendous opportunity and called Ivy her natural successor. Ivy said the job didn't feel like her. Steffy apologized, stating that she'd misunderstood Ivy's desire to prove herself and do anything that Steffy asked. Steffy said Ivy was acting as if Steffy had asked Ivy to take off her clothes and dance on a pole, but Steffy was actually offering a high-profile, respectable proposition.\n\n\nSteffy thought it was weird because Ivy had been acting as if she was grateful to have her job back. Ivy claimed to be. Steffy stated that the first time she asked Ivy to do something, Ivy was turning her boss down. Steffy said Ivy was either a part of the team, or she wasn't. Ivy wondered if it was a real opportunity for Ivy or just a chance for Steffy to have fun at Ivy's expense.\n\n\nSteffy asked why she'd do that. Ivy replied that Steffy wanted some kicks, but Steffy told Ivy to be more confident. She was sure Wyatt told Ivy that she had a great body all the time. Ivy said it wasn't about body image, and she didn't see parading around in underwear as a character-building activity.\n\n\nSteffy claimed models would jump at the opportunity that Steffy was gifting Ivy. Ivy asked if Steffy really wanted Ivy to rep the line. Steffy claimed she did. Ivy asserted that she'd be happy to do it and asked when she'd start.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas does not understand why his dad wants to send him back to Paris. He does not belong there. He gets that his dad is angry but he needs to forgive him for that and move on. Wyatt tells Liam that unfortunately he still has the power to hurt Ivy but he is trying to bypass that before it happens. Eric comes out and says all is well, Steffy has agreed to take Ivy back, no animosity. Wyatt thanks him for stepping in. Eric said if either of them had told him the circumstances he could have nipped it in the bud. This is better for the company and the family, more practice for the compassion and forgiveness that could lead them all. Ivy thanks Steffy for taking her back and is willing to be a team player. But she is thrown asunder when Steffy tells her that she will be the new face of Forrester and wants her to be head model for the lingerie line. When Ivy objects, Steffy says she is turning down a very lucrative, rewarding job so either she is accepting this or not .turning her down on her very first assignment. That is not a team player. Thomas tells his dad that sleeping with the intern wasn't his smartest move but he has never seen his father like this. Ridge says he is tired of seeing the havoc that Thomas has created in this company. Thomas keeps reminding him of the team they are and they are not finished with that. Ridge says they can not work together anymore. Thomas does not think this is just about an intern so what else is involved. He feels like he is being banished from his dad's life. Ridge leaves to get the jet ready. Thomas tells Caroline this is crazy; he wants to stay here. He laments to her this is an overreaction and there must be something else. He wants to know if Caroline told Ridge about their night together. Steffy tells Ivy either she is part of the Forrester team or not, she can not have it both ways. Ivy says she does not like parading around in her underwear but when does she start. Caroline tells Thomas that Ridge does not want him here so do as Ridge says and go. He will not change his mind no matter what Thomas says. On his way out he runs into Ridge and says he will go for a while but will come back whenever Ridge says ok. Somber, Caroline greets Ridge and asks if he is all right. She says now he does not have to look Thomas in the face and that is probably for the best. Ridge says he can not forgive his own son .can't even look at him.",
