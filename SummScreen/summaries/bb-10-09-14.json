    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's office, Caroline stared at a collaborated design and flashed back to her dream about Ridge. With a disturbed look, she shook off her musing. Rick entered and remarked that Caroline had done most of the work on it. \"No, we did this. Ridge and I,\" she replied, staring at the sketch.\n\n\nRick said it was obviously not Ridge's work. Caroline asked Rick to keep quiet about it because Ridge wasn't ready to reveal his issue. \"Neither were you. Even to your own husband,\" Rick responded.\n\n\nCaroline left, and Eric arrived to say that they were two weeks behind in production. Eric thought it was great of Ridge to mentor Caroline, but Ridge needed to concentrate on his own work. Eric asked to see what Ridge had turned in so far, and upon reviewing the boards Rick presented, Eric commented that Ridge continued to grow and change.\n\n\nEric remarked that the lines on the gowns were beautiful, and with pride, Rick agreed. Eric wanted more designs, but Rick said it might be a problem because the designs were Caroline's, not Ridge's. Eric rendered a quizzical stare at Rick, who said Ridge hadn't produced a thing since Abu Dhabi. Rick felt that Ridge's loss was tragic, but there was no place for Ridge there.\n\n\nEric was visibly affected by the news about Ridge. Rick claimed that Ridge, who had Marone blood in him, had always pushed the envelope and had even tried to take the company from Eric. Rick didn't want to pay Ridge to do nothing. Instead, Rick wanted Ridge go to Paris while Caroline and Rick ran the company. \"We're the future, Dad, and the future's already begun,\" Rick asserted.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge froze while working on a rudimentary sketch of a gown. After thinking of guiding Caroline's hand, he slowly continued. Katie entered and was surprised to hear that he'd been working on his own sketch. She said it was good, but Ridge bashfully replied that it was just a start.\n\n\nKatie believed that Ridge's talent was returning to him. Ridge said he didn't know how to repay Caroline for the help. Katie hoped that the development would improve things between Rick and Ridge. Ridge said the issue wasn't the designs; it was Rick being president.\n\n\nKatie replied that it was merely a title, but Ridge stated that the title allowed Rick to make notes on Ridge's designs when Rick didn't know the first thing about designing. She suggested that Ridge talk to his father about it, but Ridge decided that his father was the root of the problem.\n\n\nKatie assumed Ridge was alluding to the fact that Massimo, not Eric, was his biological father. Ridge said Eric had made Rick president because Rick was Eric's blood. Katie thought that the notion was ridiculous. Katie voiced Rick's concern about not spending enough time with his wife, and she felt that Rick and Ridge's issues would subside if Ridge stopped working with Caroline.\n\n\nLater, Katie had gone, and Caroline was apologizing to Ridge for revealing the secret. Ridge wasn't concerned about it and said they should get to work. Caroline readily hopped on a stool at the drafting table and began to describe and draw out her ideas. Ridge liked what she was drawing. He placed his hand over hers, and the fine hairs on Caroline's arms rose.\n\n\nRidge noticed that Caroline's hand was shaking. Caroline acted as if nothing was wrong, but to her, it was getting hot in there. He didn't feel hot and wondered if she might be sick. Caroline stammered as she revealed that she was feeling something. She declared that she loved her husband, but \"this\" was so different. Ridge knew she loved Rick and agreed that it was different.\n\n\nCaroline asked if Ridge felt it, too. Ridge asked how he could not feel it and remarked that two artists were working together. Caroline realized that he'd probably felt it thousands of times before with other artists. Ridge remarked that he'd always worked alone, so it was new for him, too. She relayed that when he drew with her hand, it was as if she felt what he felt.\n\n\nRidge explained that they were designing and creating things together. Caroline asserted that she wanted to keep working with him, and she thought about it all the time. She added that she dreamed about it. Touching her arm, Ridge said there was no reason to stop. She conveyed that they had to stop because it was blowing her mind. \"These feelings are taking over me,\" Caroline confessed.\n\n\n\"Listen to me,\" Ridge responded. He believed that becoming emotionally caught up meant that they were designing something remarkable, and that was the way it should be. Caroline stated that she was discussing something more, something physical and intimate, and it was freaking her out.\n\n\nJust then, Eric entered with Rick, and Caroline and Ridge peeled away from their close conversation. Eric said he knew that Ridge couldn't draw. Eric hugged Ridge, who responded that he hadn't wanted anyone to know. \"Anyone? I'm your father,\" Eric replied. Ridge guessed that Rick had told Eric, and Eric replied that it should have been Ridge.\n\n\nRick asked about the production schedule, and Ridge replied that they were behind. Rick handed Ridge a folder with notes on the designs and requested the rest of the collection by week's end. Ridge questioned Rick's right to notate the designs, and Rick replied that he was the president.\n\n\nRidge asked if Eric had seen the notes. Rick suggested that Ridge show the notes to Caroline, who was doing the heavy lifting. Caroline said she and Ridge were a team. Rick contended that if Ridge and Caroline were an official design team, then Forrester should change the label or rebrand the line.\n\n\nClaiming not to want to be heavy-handed, Rick said they needed a collection, and Caroline could deliver it. Caroline added that it would be with Ridge's help, and Eric asked how Ridge was helping. She said that Ridge just was. Rick challenged Ridge to draw something, and Ridge asked if it had really gotten down to that. Rick said he needed to know if Ridge could perform his duties as head designer.\n\n\nCaroline called it unfair. Rick insisted that he had to do what was best for Forrester. She declared that Ridge was best for Forrester. Rick said it had been that way when Ridge had been healthy. Rick asserted to Eric that they needed to make a decision, and it was time for a change.\n\n\nEric stated that Ridge hadn't confided in him. Ridge replied that he'd thought it would pass. Eric said he would have helped Ridge, but Ridge exclaimed that he hadn't needed help. \"No, you don't need anything from me anymore,\" Eric replied. Eric decided that it was indeed time for a change.\n\n\nStanding behind his chair, Eric announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Ridge and Rick grew upset, but Eric said it was going to happen. Eric proclaimed that either Ridge or Rick would succeed Eric as the CEO of Forrester Creations.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Bill carried Will around as he barked out orders to Justin. Alison noted that Bill had been a grouch since Brooke's departure. Alison left with Will, and Justin suggested that Bill get away for a while. Bill said he'd been thinking about it, and Justin warned Bill not to follow Brooke to Milan.\n\n\nKatie arrived, and she and Justin curtly acknowledged each other as Justin exited. Katie and Bill discussed Will's choking incident, and she remarked that he'd saved their son. She noted that Bill didn't look so good. Katie was sorry about Brooke leaving for Italy and understood his pain.\n\n\nBill claimed that Brooke had blindsided him, and he'd only wanted to help her with her pain. Katie asked if Bill would have asked for help.\n\n\nInstead of answering, Bill changed the subject to how Ridge was doing. Katie remarked that Ridge was struggling, but Bill said he'd heard that Ridge had improved and was working with Caroline. Katie replied that Ridge was relying on Caroline too much, and Rick was uncomfortable with the time the pair spent designing together. \"And you?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nKatie shrugged, looking away, and Bill asked if Katie was jealous of Caroline. Bill decided that it was true, but Katie denied it. She added that, even if she was, Ridge would never cross the line. Bill concluded that Rick was jealous of Ridge. Katie declared that no one was jealous of anyone, but Rick wasn't okay with the time Ridge and Caroline were spending together.\n\n\nBill asked how Katie felt, and Katie admitted that she'd like more time with her fianc\u00e9. Bill asserted that Ridge was a well-documented playboy, and Bill's niece was smoking hot. \"Need I say more?\" Bill asked. \n\n\n",

Rick comes in and thinks her design is fine but throws it up again that she could not have done this without Ridge and his little secret. Ridge too is trying to design but thinking about Caroline and her closeness. Katie comes in but Ridge can't have lunch with her. She sees one of his sketches and thinks it is great and has potential. He says it is a start and Caroline has helped. She is sure his talent is coming back. They bicker about Rick wanting to be in control and perhaps Ridge needs to talk to Eric about this. Bill holds Will but barks at Justin and Alison about things not going right. Alison says he has been a big grouch ever since Brooke left.

He guides her hand until she can not continue. She asks if they can take some time off. It's really hot in here. He questions her if she is all right. She says no, she is feeling something she does not think she should be feeling. Rick shows Eric some designs from Ridge. They are two weeks behind and need much more designs. Eric continues to praise Ridge for his line. Rick finally says they are not Ridge's, they are Caroline's. Ridge has not designed anything since Abu Dubai. He says he feels for Ridge but that is the reason they are behind. Ridge has Marrone blood running through him. He thinks Ridge should go to Paris and work with Thorne, and Rick and Caroline can run FC. Eric says he needs to talk to Ridge first. Katie stops in on Bill and they discuss Ridge. He wants to know if she is jealous of Caroline. Caroline tells Ridge he is the great Ridge Forrester so he's probably had these flattering mentions before but it is new to her. She thinks about him guiding her hand all the time and she even dreams about him. They are taking over. He says that is good. It means they are designing something and that is good. She says but she needs more ..something physical. Eric and Rick come in and interrupt. Eric says he knows and he is sorry. He's his father and he should have come to him. They hug. Katie says she is not jealous. And even if she were, Ridge would ever cross that line. They just speak the same language. She would like more time with her fiance. Bill says he understands. In case she did not know, her fiance is a renowned playboy and his niece is smoking hot. Rick tells Eric to ask Ridge how he is coming up with the designs. It is Caroline and maybe they should just let the line be hers. It's time for a change so Eric needs to make a decision. Eric tells Ridge that he needed help but did not come to him. Rick is right. It's time for a change. He tells them he is stepping down. He doesn't know how the company will run but one of them will be CEO of FC.",
