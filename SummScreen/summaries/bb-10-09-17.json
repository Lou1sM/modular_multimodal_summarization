    "soap_central": "\n\nIn flight on the Spencer jet, Sally expressed that the new information Liam had given her about the fire had made it fine with her to use Whitman and Associates to revamp Spectra. Liam thought she eventually would have figured out Bill's hand in the fire.\n\n\nSally couldn't thank Liam enough for the lengths he'd gone to for her, and she let him know that the kiss on the cheek had been platonic. Liam conveyed that he already knew it. He assumed that he and Sally would be longtime friends, and he and Steffy would be married forever.\n\n\nLater, Liam told Sally that they'd land at any moment, and Sally cooed that the architects meeting them on the plane was VIP treatment. Liam replied that Steffy hadn't been thrilled about the trip, so he'd decided that an onboard meeting would speed things up. Sally understood about keeping it professional and hoped Steffy knew she was lucky to have a husband like him.\n\n\nLater, the jet had landed, and the meeting was underway with three other people. Liam loved the plans and wanted some outdoor space. He asked Sally's opinion. Sally loved everything Liam was saying. Liam asked that the building be as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible, and one of the associates said it wouldn't be a problem.\n\n\nLiam apologized to the associates for the change in plan about Spencer Tower. The female associate said it had been quite the project, and Liam's father had had a very specific vision. Liam replied that Bill could dream a little too big at times, and he thanked the associates for being flexible. The meeting concluded, and the associates left.\n\n\nSally asked Liam to pinch her, and Liam replied that the meeting had gone well. She couldn't believe it was happening. She said she was getting emotional, and everything was due to him. Sally thought Liam had acted like a pro in the meeting, and she felt lucky to have him on her team. They clinked their champagne glasses. Liam was happy to help and thought it would be wrong if he hadn't.\n\n\n\"I have never had a man treat me the way that you do,\" Sally said. Liam frowned, and she told him that her words had come out totally wrong. She respected him and Steffy. Liam frowned again, and she said, \"Maybe not Steffy.\" Sally respected Liam's marriage and figured Steffy had done something right to get Liam. Liam replied that he was far from perfect.\n\n\nSally believed that Liam was a catch and a prince among men; however, there was only one of him, and he was taken. \"But if you weren't, I could -- you know -- maybe see the potential for more,\" she added. Liam's brows rose, and he bashfully blinked. She quickly added that she'd never push for more or do anything to make him uncomfortable.\n\n\nSally insisted that Liam didn't have to worry about her trying to seduce him. It wasn't who she was. She understood that he was completely faithful to his wife and said Steffy would be an utter fool not to be the same to him.\n\n\nAfter a while, Liam said they'd land soon. Sally joked about telling the pilot to swing down to \"Cabo\" for margaritas. Liam wishfully replied that it would be nice. She still couldn't believe what he'd done for her and was excited to see what the future held for them. Liam agreed. He said he had a company to run and a marriage to get back on track. It had been a long road for him and Steffy, and he needed to make sure nothing got between them again.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Bill vowed to make sure Liam's world would crash if Liam didn't snap out of it. Steffy understood that Bill was hurting and worried that he'd lose Brooke. Bill said that if he lost Brooke, Steffy could tell Liam that, \"I'm coming. And hell's coming with me.\"\n\n\nBill said Steffy could admit that she wanted to see her father happy, and Ridge would be happy to have his precious Logan back. Steffy always wanted to see her father happy; however, it was Brooke's decision, and Steffy didn't know what Brooke would do. Bill said he'd had to tell Brooke, who'd seen right through his leave-of-absence excuse.\n\n\nBill blamed it all on Liam's blackmail. Bill roared that his self-righteous son might ruin Bill's life, and Bill said Liam had better pray it didn't go that way. Bill ranted about all the opportunities he'd given Liam. Steffy tried to say Liam knew, but Bill talked over her in a whiny voice, saying, \"A little computer geek!\" Bill said Liam had been a nothing and a nobody, who'd have nothing without Bill -- including Steffy.\n\n\nBill complained that Liam had repaid Bill with betrayal. Bill believed his son talked a good game about virtue but was a hypocrite. Bill didn't know how Steffy put up with Liam. Steffy said to stop because she loved her husband. Bill retorted that flying off with another woman was a funny way for Liam to show that he loved Steffy, and Sally was leading Liam around on a leash.\n\n\nBill asked if that was how Liam would treat his wife. Steffy frowned, looking away. Bill asserted that Liam didn't respect Steffy, not the way she deserved. Steffy admitted that she didn't like Liam flying around with Sally or trying to rescue Sally. Bill said his son justified it with a savior routine, and Bill had put up with Liam's kind for Bill's entire life.\n\n\nPeople like Liam, in Bill's view, didn't know what it took to make the world a better place. Bill asserted that it took money and leadership, and one could forget all the \"kumbaya BS.\" \"You don't fix the world by doing yoga and eating quinoa. You don't do a warrior pose. Be a warrior!\" Bill said. Liam's inability to do it would be the demise of Bill's family and company.\n\n\nBill said it had already been the destruction of his greatest gift to Los Angeles -- his skyscraper. It emphasized that it hadn't been for himself, \"contrary to popular belief.\" The building would have employed thousands in construction, and generated millions in city revenue for materials -- plus, it would have employed people in the available office spaces. \"Thanks to Liam, poof! It's all ruined,\" Bill concluded.\n\n\nIn Bill's view, Liam just wanted to hand money to people. Bill didn't believe people wanted handouts; they wanted to feel empowered and valued. People wanted to earn their living and have growth and progress. Bill didn't think Liam was helping Spencer employees. Instead, Liam was ruining them. Bill believed they'd lose their jobs because of Liam. Bill said he'd lose his own job, too, but he'd better not lose his wife.\n\n\nSteffy tried to calm Bill down and said she was sure he and Liam would fix it. Bill said it was on Liam, and Bill had been nothing but patient. Bill claimed he'd even tried to forgive the blackmail, but if Brooke didn't return, it would be the last straw. Steffy noted that Liam hadn't told Brooke anything, and it had been Brooke's choice to leave.\n\n\nBill insisted that it wouldn't have happened if Liam hadn't backed Bill into a corner. Bill planned to make Liam pay dearly if Bill's marriage didn't survive. Bill threatened to rain pain down on Liam that Bill wouldn't wish on his worst enemy.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Eric and Rick chatted, wondering what Brooke's situation with Bill could mean for Ridge and the family. Nicole popped open the front door, exclaiming, \"Bonjour!\" She'd made a quick trip in from Paris to visit her parents and conveyed that she and Zende loved Paris.\n\n\nNicole asked where everyone was, and Eric said Quinn was taking a steam upstairs after hurting her back. Eric was sure Quinn would rebound in a few days. He just wanted to make sure his wife got all the help she needed.\n\n\nLater, Nicole decided it was time to meet up with Maya and Lizzie. Rick was headed home and offered to drive Nicole. Eric and Nicole hugged and kissed each other's cheeks, and Eric asked her to give Zende his best regards. Nicole asked him to do the same for her with Quinn about the ailing back. Rick jokingly harassed Eric about taking take care of his wife, and Nicole and Rick exited.\n\n\nUpstairs, Quinn strode around in a towel and was surprised when Mateo entered her bedroom. He was there to fix the steam, and Quinn guessed she had to take a bath, since the steam was broken. The two discussed her hurt back, and Mateo relayed that it was the number one complaint of his clients. Mateo added that he happened to also be a massage therapist.\n\n\nQuinn recalled that Mateo had mentioned being newly licensed when she and Eric had conducted Mateo's interview. Mateo asked if she'd been to a doctor. Quinn had gotten an exam and a muscle relaxant. He thought it would only exacerbate the problem, and Quinn readily agreed.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Mateo would mind. He stammered, and she said she just didn't want to live with the pain. He asked if she happened to have a massage table, and she asked if the bed would do. \"Sure,\" he responded, looking a little stressed. Quinn called him a godsend.\n\n\nQuinn stretched out across the bed, and Mateo massaged her through the towel. He said he normally used oil, but Quinn said it was fine and to go for it. They discussed the pressure, and Quinn couldn't really feel anything. Mateo couldn't get deep because of the towel, and she told him to just move it. He did so and applied his hands to her bare back.\n\n\nQuinn said that was it, and Mateo had a conspicuous look on his face as he massaged her. As Quinn praised his work on her back, Mateo flashed back to receiving the money from Sheila. Quinn said his clients probably told him he was worth every penny. Mateo grimaced.\n\n\nLater, Eric arrived in the bedroom, and Quinn was on the bed in a robe. Quinn noticed he'd gotten a haircut, and he said Tobias had just left. She explained why she hadn't taken a steam and that Mateo had gotten his elbow into where she hurt. Eric asked if Mateo had massaged her, and she reminded Eric that Mateo had mentioned his license in his interview.\n\n\nQuinn wanted to find out how much Mateo charged. Eric didn't know how he felt about their estate manager massaging her. She told Eric not to be silly and suggested he try it. \"A Mateo massage?\" Eric asked. Giggling, Quinn suggested getting a massage table and asked if it wouldn't be great to have the talent there in the house.\n\n\nIn her hotel room, the restless Sheila tossed a book on the bed. She stared at her portrait and flashed back to trying to convince Mateo to romance Quinn. Stroking the hair drawn on her portrait, she said the painting would soon replace Quinn's portrait and Sheila would take her place in Eric's life.\n\n\nLater, Mateo arrived and told Sheila about the massage for Quinn. \"Right there on her marital bed,\" Sheila said. Mateo replied that there had been no other place. She asked if it meant he was considering her job offer, but Mateo was uneasy about it. He didn't think he could break up a marriage. Yet Quinn was attractive to him, and he said the extra money would help his family.\n\n\nSheila offered to double her offer but said Mateo wouldn't get the money until she was Eric's wife again. Mateo decided to make the deal. Sheila told Mateo to get Quinn to cross the line, and he would be rewarded very handsomely.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "On the jet while she designs, Sally tells Liam that she is totally okay with using these contactors now that she knows his dad started the fire at Spectra and is just doing what he can to help her out. She also tells him that the little kiss on the cheek was totally innocent. He says he knows. He is sure they will be friends for a long time but he is very committed to Steffy and they will be together forever. He warns her that the contractors will be coming on the plane. He admits Steffy wasn't exactly thrilled over this trip so he wants to keep it very professional. She says she understands and hopes that Steffy knows how lucky she is. Bill states to Steffy that Liam's world is going to come crashing down if he doesn't wake up. He says if he loses Brooke then tell Liam that he is coming for him and Hell is coming with him. He also knows she would like her father happy with Brooke too. Steffy says of course but it is Brooke's decision and neither of them know what she might do. Bill said he had to tell Brooke about the fire as she would not believe a leave of absence from his company and she saw right through that. And then only his self-righteous boy scout of a son could ruin his life by blackmailing him. He better pray it doesn't come to that. Nicole surprises Eric and Rick by walking on in and said she just came home for a little visit. Zende couldn't come; he is very busy designing at International and she thanks them again for this opportunity they gave him. Quinn has only a towel wrapped around her and Mateo doesn't know she is home. She says she is okay but her back is out and she was going to take a steam bath. He says one of his many talents is a massage therapist. She says she got a muscle relaxer from her own doctor but she is still in some pain .would he mind. He asks if she has a massage table he could use. She thinks but says no, not that she knows of but how about the bed, that could do. The contractor meeting goes well and Liam says sometimes his father dreams a little too big and he thanks them for working with him now. When they leave, Sally tells Liam that he needs to pinch her to believe this is all coming true. She is getting emotional and it is all because of him. No man has ever treated her like this before. She apologizes for how that sounds and then adds she respects him and Steffy so much ..well maybe not totally Steffy but she does respect their marriage. She would never cross that line. He is a prince among men, a noble friend. But there is only one of him and he is taken so she would never go there and he does not have to worry about her feelings. He does not have to feel uncomfortable about her trying to seduce him. That is not who she is or what she does. She says she knows he is totally in love with Steffy and she would be a total fool to ever be unfaithful to him. Liam grins but laps it up. He tells her that he and Steffy have often had a rocky road and he needs to make sure they stay on track now and nothing comes between them. Bill mocks Liam and says he was nothing but a little computer geek and he would still have nothing if it were not for Bill. And that includes her. But his thanks is a big betrayal .what a hypocrite. He does not know how she puts up with this. She tells him to stop. He's her husband and she loves him. Bill snorts back that he sure has a funny way of showing he loves her. Here he is flying around with Sally Spectra and letting her lead him around on a leash and that is the way he loves his wife! He does not respect Steffy the way she deserves. He has been around his kind all his life with their hypocrisy and they do not have a clue what it takes to make the world a better place. It takes money and leadership. Forget all this Kumbaya B.S. You don't fix the world by doing yoga and eating quinoa. But little Liam doesn't know how to do that. And it will be the demise of his family and the company. He's already scrapped his skyscraper and it is now poof. And he just wants to hand money out but people don't want handouts. They want to feel empowered and valued. They want to earn it. So Bill will lose his company and his employees but what he better not lose is his wife. Steffy says she gets it; he is upset with Liam right now but they will get through this. After all, they are father and son. Bill says he has been patient and was even willing to forgive him for blackmail but if Brooke does not come home that will be the final straw. Liam will pay dearly. He will bring down such pain on Liam that he would not wish on his worst enemy. Quinn is enjoying her massage until Mateo says he usually works with oil and she says he will just have to go for it. He massages more then says he can't do more as the towel is in the way. She gives him permission to move it a little and he does and gives her a deeper massage. She lets out moans of pleasure and says he is really good at this. He says he has been told his hands are like eyes and he sees the pain and releases it. Later she tells Eric that she forgot Mateo just got his massage license but he is really good. She thinks Eric ought to try it and even get a massage table. It would be nice to have it right there for both of them in the house. Mateo reports to Sheila how it became so easy with Quinn. Sheila thinks him using the bed was perfect so she hopes he will accept her little proposition. He says he is still not sure he can do it .breaking up a marriage. Sheila says she can double what she offered as long as he realizes he won't get it all until she is Mrs. Eric Forrester. They need to shake on that. She tells him to get Quinn to cross that line, Mr. Fix-It and he will be rewarded very nicely.",
