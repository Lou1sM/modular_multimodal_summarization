Katie asked if he was planning to finish puberty any time soon. She quipped that she knew him too well to assume he wasn't purposely being offensive.\n\n\nBill claimed to know Katie, too. In his view, she cared about time and attention, and she was worried about all the time that \"Mr. Upstanding\" was spending with Caroline. Bill theorized that the time was probably innocent, but nonetheless, Katie couldn't help but wonder.\n\n\nKatie asked Bill not to peg her as insecure. Bill noted that Ridge was a cold fish, and it was hard to tell where one stood with Ridge. Katie disagreed, but Bill advised her to ask Brooke. Empathizing with Katie, Bill said that an engagement to Ridge would leave Bill unable to sleep at night, too.\n\n\nDeciding not to touch that statement, Katie claimed not to lose sleep over Ridge working with Caroline or to be talking herself into thinking something was brewing between the two. Katie said Caroline was helping Ridge and giving him something Katie couldn't at the time; however, it might not be for much longer, and Katie trusted Ridge.\n\n\n\"No, you don't, and that's my fault,\" Bill said. He recalled that Katie had been loving and trusting when they'd married; however, he'd hurt her more than once, and he'd never forgive himself for it.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Maya nagged Carter into spotting her while she bench-pressed five-pound weights on a bar. He ditched her the moment he saw Ivy and claimed that his date was there. Maya became shocked, but Carter admitted to joking so he could watch Maya salivate over new gossip.\n\n\nIvy was curious about what was going on in Eric's office and figured that Carter, an executive, would know why Eric, Ridge, Rick, and Caroline had decided to meet behind closed doors. Maya quipped that she might be a low-level employee, but it was no mystery to her.\n\n\nMaya conveyed her theory about Ridge and Caroline, but Ivy didn't buy it. Maya called Caroline unbalanced; however, Carter contended that Maya, not Caroline, had gone loopy after Rick's marriage.\n\n\nIvy doubted Eric had called a meeting about Maya's assertions. Maya agreed but explained that allegiances were shifting. She reasoned that Ridge had become a god to Caroline, and he held the key to Caroline's dreams. \"And Caroline doesn't want to be merely someone's wife,\" Maya concluded.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office at Forrester, Ridge noted that Eric always said he was retiring but never did. Eric stated that he hadn't said he was retiring; he'd said he was stepping down.\n\n\nEric hadn't minded being chained to his desk while he'd coped with Stephanie's death, but upon hearing about John's carefree lifestyle, Eric had pondered having a life like that for himself. With that in mind, he'd decided to leave Forrester to one of his sons to run. Caroline cited that Eric hadn't said which son would take over, and Eric asked her who he thought he should choose.\n\n\nRick wondered if Eric was sure about his choice. Eric said it had been brewing for a long time, and he wouldn't favor or punish anyone by his choice. Eric felt that Ridge, Rick, Caroline, Brooke, and Hope were integral to the company's success. Eric needed strong designs and leadership in his stead. Eric said that he'd talk to some people, but he wouldn't keep everyone awaiting his answer for long.\n\n\nEric left, but Rick soon found him in Rick's office. Rick wanted to know if someone was forcing Eric into the decision. Assuming Rick was referring to Ridge, Eric indicated that no one had, and Ridge had been focused on designing. Rick replied that Caroline had been designing for Ridge, who had to feel as if his chance at the CEO position was slipping away.\n\n\nRick said that Eric knew how Ridge could get, and Eric responded that he knew how they each could get. Rick, who was older and wiser than he'd been the last time that Eric had contemplated leaving, didn't look at Eric's departure as an opportunity. Instead, it was a great loss.\n\n\nRick felt that he'd been born and groomed to fill Eric's shoes, and \"I look at it as coming into myself.\" Rick vowed that he and Caroline would be right there, maintaining the Forrester tradition.\n\n\nLater, Eric arrived at the sky lounge to meet with Ivy, who wanted his approval on some jewelry designs. Eric asked if Rick had seen them. She said Rick had, and Eric decided that he didn't need to see them, because second-guessing Rick's work would be insulting. Ivy asked if there was a situation, and Eric replied that the situation was him.\n\n\nEric had never been jealous of his brother, but he'd started to wonder what life would be like if he didn't have to be at the office every day, and instead, he could be at the pool or travel. Ivy assumed that Eric wanted to retire. He quickly banned the use of the word. He said he'd be the CEO Emeritus and finally have his own office that he didn't have to share with everyone else in the building.\n\n\nIvy asked who'd take over. Eric stated that Thorne had lost the ambition, and for all of Felicia's assets, she wasn't a good manager. Eric figured that it would be Rick or Ridge. To Eric, Rick was more settled and had Caroline, who was invaluable. Ivy questioned if Caroline was as indispensible as Eric's sons. Eric doubted Ivy remembered Rick in his youth. Rick had been a completely different person back then, but Caroline's love and support had made all the difference.\n\n\nIvy noticed that Eric carried his heavy burden of leadership lightly. Eric admitted that it was an isolating position. He hadn't known what he would have done without Stephanie, who'd made his ambitions hers and had stood by him. Eric believed Rick had that same type of partner in Caroline.\n\n\nBack in Rick's office, Maya arrived to hear how Rick had swooped in to save the day, regarding the crisis she'd heard about. Rick didn't see the day's events that way but revealed that an opportunity had arisen. He confided in her that his father was considering stepping down, and Rick was second in command. Maya asked about Ridge, and Rick figured Ridge would have reduced responsibilities.\n\n\nMaya wondered what Caroline, who'd been working closely with Ridge, would think about it. Rick dismissively said Caroline and Ridge's collaboration was a temporary experiment. \"Caroline and I are the team, not Caroline and Ridge,\" Rick declared. Maya asked if he was sure about it.\n\n\nMaya tried to broach the topic of there being something between Caroline and Ridge. Rick stopped Maya from talking. He said he and Maya had been building a friendship, but badmouthing and planting doubtful seeds about his wife wasn't the friendly thing to do. Maya agreed and apologized.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Ridge questioned Caroline about her and Rick's knowledge of Eric's plans. Caroline claimed that it was the first she and Rick had heard of it. Ridge found it suspicious that it would happen at a time Ridge couldn't draw. \"About earlier...\" Ridge said, shifting topics.\n\n\nCaroline exclaimed that she and Ridge would not talk about it, and she'd already made a fool of herself with a schoolgirl crush. Ridge asked if he could say something, and he revealed that he'd developed a little crush on her, too.\n\n\nCaroline jumped with a start and asserted that she and Ridge shouldn't be talking that way. Ridge didn't think they should ignore it, and he said he needed her. \"Well, that need will go away,\" Caroline declared. He asked her about the rest of it, but she said it had been her being stupid. Ridge revealed that she instilled confidence in him that he hadn't felt before.\n\n\nCaroline tried to rationalize what was happening, but Ridge said they were creating things, which was what the business was about. Ridge claimed that the last time the business had been run by someone who hadn't been a designer, it had been a disaster. Caroline defended her husband's leadership. Ridge agreed that Rick was good at numbers and facts, but not art, design, and fashion.\n\n\nRidge had found it strange before when Eric has asked Caroline's opinion of who should lead the company, but Ridge discovered that it had actually been a pertinent question. Ridge felt that Eric was asking if Caroline wanted to be a great designer or an ornamental wife.\n\n\nRidge said he wanted Caroline to thrive. \"And my husband doesn't?\" Caroline defensively asked. He asked her to answer her own question, but she refused to participate. She admitted feelings and thoughts, but when the sun rose, they evaporated, leaving her with the life she'd built with Rick.\n\n\nRidge said that Rick wasn't worthy of Caroline, but she replied that it was the other way around. Ridge didn't want to see Caroline's greatness disappear behind a good administrator who couldn't discern original ideas. Caroline loved her husband and wanted him to have what made him happy. Ridge asked why she'd push Rick into a job that would make him miserable.\n\n\nCaroline accused Ridge of asking her to turn her back on every promise she'd made to Rick. Ridge asserted that he was asking her to be true to herself. He brushed her hair aside and said he was asking her to be true to what was inside her. He recalled that their first time drawing hand-to-hand had been incredible. She asked if he was saying he'd leave Katie for her.\n\n\n\"I'm saying -- \" Ridge started to say, and he swept Caroline into a kiss. \n\n\n",

But he sees how fun and happy go lucky his brother is, and he'd like to turn over the company to one of his own sons for a while. Caroline asks which one. Eric says they have all known this was coming for a while. This is not something they are being punished for. He will sort out his feelings and let them know very soon. Bill tells Katie than one thing a man can do is smell jealousy. And he can smell jealousy all over her about Mr. Upstanding spending time with his niece. That is time he is not spending with her and she is beginning to wonder. He says if he was engaged to Ridge he'd be lying awake at nights too. He's a cold fish. Katie says she is not a brat. Caroline is helping Ridge right now where she can't. Maya tells Ivy that allegiances are shifting. Caroline does not just want to be someone's wife, so the meeting with Eric is crucial and the reason they aren't in this meeting. It's more personal. Rick follows Eric and asks if anyone is forcing him to step down or forcing his hand. Eric says no. Rick says he doesn't look at this as an opportunity for him but a big loss in losing Eric. Ridge tells Caroline that it is a little suspicious that all of this came up now that he can't draw and Rick is on his tail. She tells him that need of his for her to help will go away. He says when he is with her there is a confidence that he has not felt before. Caroline says Rick is great. Ridge says yes with numbers but not so much for running the company. And he does not want to keep Caroline back and just settle for being the wife. Eric confides in Ivy that he is jealous of her dad and what fun it would be to lounge around the pool and not have to come in to work ever day. He is not retiring, that is a dirty word, but he would like to step aside and let one of his sons take over for a while with him keeping the title CEO Emeritus and have an office somewhere that he doesn't have to share with everyone in the building. Thorne has taken himself out of the running long ago and he doesn't blame him. So it will be between Rick or Ridge. Maya seeks out Rick to question him about the meeting. He tells her in confidence that his dad might step down. He and Caroline might end up running the company. Maya is not so sure about that. Bill tells Katie that he hurt her more than once. He will never forgive himself for that. She was loving and trusting when he married her. Caroline confesses to Ridge that she has had thoughts and feelings but they quickly go away and her life is with Rick. She says she loves her husband and he makes her happy. He asks her to be true to herself. He felt it the first time he touched her hand. She wants to know if he is saying he will leave Katie for her. He doesn't answer but he kisses her passionately.",
