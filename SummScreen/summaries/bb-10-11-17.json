Quinn wished she'd known about Mateo's skills a few weeks back. She'd needed help relaxing when they'd had a certain houseguest.\n\n\nMateo asked Quinn to flip over. Deciding that it was hot in there, he removed his shirt. Quinn complimented him and couldn't believe he didn't have a girlfriend. She felt that they could go on for hours with hands like his. Mateo hovered over Quinn. She said she was all his.\n\n\n\"Right there, Mateo,\" Quinn said. Mateo snapped out of his fantasy and realized that he was still only platonically massaging Quinn.\n\n\nIn the living room, Eric, Rick, and Maya discussed Brooke's ambiguous breakup with Bill. Rick was torn about whether Brooke should continue her marriage or return to Ridge.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Quinn's back, and Eric said Quinn would still be in pain if it weren't for Mateo and his magic hands. When Maya heard about Mateo's skills, she said she'd keep them in mind for her neck. Rick quipped that the only massage therapist she needed was her husband.\n\n\nEric said he'd surprised himself by arranging for a young man to touch his wife's half-naked body upstairs in his own house. \"Not that I don't trust Quinn,\" Eric added. Maya was sure Quinn had had massages before, and Rick asked if Eric didn't trust Mateo. Eric admitted to having a subtle but firm talk with Mateo about loyalty.\n\n\nIn his bedroom later, Eric watched Quinn spin around in a robe. Feeling no pain, Quinn was impressed that she was recovering without medication. Eric thought he should have his head examined for letting a younger, attractive man massage her, let alone putting hands all over her. Quinn dismissed the thought and said Eric was the only man she wanted.\n\n\nQuinn did feel they owed Mateo gratitude because she was ready for all sorts of activities. \"Really?\" Eric asked, and they kissed.\n\n\nAt Sheila's hotel, Sheila returned to her room and saw that Charlie had unveiled her portrait. She asked if he thought it was beautiful. \"If you like mug shots,\" he quipped. Sheila asserted that her portrait would hang in the house of the man she loved. Charlie believed that Sheila was setting herself up for heartbreak.\n\n\nSheila theorized that she would have a chance if Eric could see Quinn for the immoral person Quinn was. Charlie said he knew Sheila was banking on a Quinn and Ridge merger, but the \"Ridgester\" was spending time with Lady Logan after splitting from \"a Buck and a quarter Bill.\" Sheila said to consider whom they were discussing. She was sure someone else would get their hands on Quinn.\n\n\nLater, Sheila received an update call from Mateo, who'd given Quinn another massage. He believed she'd enjoyed it, but things took time and couldn't be rushed. He told Sheila not to worry because he knew what he was doing.\n\n\nIn the design office, Katie and Brooke worked, and Brooke teased Katie about her incessant smile. Brooke guessed there was a man in Katie's life. Katie deflected, saying that if Brooke wanted to talk about men, they could discuss where things stood with Brooke and Bill.\n\n\nBrooke didn't know where things stood. It wasn't fair to herself, her son, Ridge, or Bill, and she felt she needed to clarify things. Brooke pulled out her phone to message Bill.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, R.J. tried to convince Ridge to hire more interns for the holidays, but Ridge was preoccupied with something. R.J. asked if his mother was on Ridge's mind. Ridge didn't reply. R.J. asked if the problem of the past still stood between Brooke and Ridge and if Brooke was worried that Ridge would disappoint her again. Ridge asserted that he wouldn't. He said Brooke needed their support, and she'd always have it.\n\n\nKatie entered, and Ridge said they'd just been discussing her sister. R.J. asked if Katie knew where Brooke stood. Katie, who'd just talked to Brooke, believed Brooke had made a decision.\n\n\nR.J. took off, and Katie hoped she hadn't run the teen off. Ridge asked Katie what Brooke would do, but Katie had no idea.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Justin tried to get Bill to go to lunch, but all Bill did was gripe about losing his company and wife. Bill would change Brooke's mind for her if she let him, and he was worried that the longer they were apart, the more it began to seem permanent. Justin wondered if Ridge was respecting the marriage or in hot pursuit of Brooke.\n\n\nBecause Bill didn't want to do lunch, Justin figured they'd at least have fun for Thursday night's game night with pizza and wings. Bill said it might be the only thing to get his mind off his world exploding. Retrieving Brooke's ring from a cabinet, Bill remembered how Brooke had looked at him when she'd removed it. He refused to give up on her.\n\n\nWhile ranting about Liam ruining Bill's marriage, Bill got a message from Brooke that she was on the way over. Justin assumed it meant he'd be alone on game night. Bill said his wife would be back with him, but Justin advised Bill to give it more time. Bill claimed he'd done that, and Brooke had used the time.\n\n\nJustin started to doubt it meant what Bill thought, but Justin decided that Bill could be right in thinking Brooke saw Bill as a chastened man who wouldn't commit the same wrongs. Bill asserted that if he and Brooke broke up, he would strike his turncoat son \"so hard.\" Liam had better pray for a reconciliation or feel unimaginable pain.\n\n\nLater, Brooke arrived. Bill had hoped her arrival meant what he thought it meant. Brooke said he'd been reaching out to talk, and keeping them in limbo wasn't fair for either of them.\n\n\nBill said he'd never loved a woman the way he loved Brooke, and they'd made it to the altar, despite the obstacles. He stated that marriages got tested, and they'd reached the biggest test they'd ever face. He knew that he'd compromised her trust in him. Bill was angry at himself, Liam, and the world because Bill didn't know how to fix it -- or if she wanted him to.\n\n\nBill felt that he was losing himself, and he needed Brooke. He'd lost his head and judgment, but he'd never do anything like his transgression again. He swore to be a good role model and husband. Bill took her ring out of his pocket and asked to put it back on her finger. He asked Brooke to return to him as his wife and partner.\n\n\n",

And if she does not come back to him then his turncoat son will feel the wrath of pain like he cannot imagine. RJ catches his dad with his mind on Brooke and can't get an answer out of him if she has made it official that she is leaving Spencer.

She sits up and says he is so handsome; she cannot believe he does not have a girlfriend to which he replies he just has not found the right woman yet.

Because of him she can now walk and hike and do all sorts of activities. Sheila calls Mateo to get a check up on his activities. He says he just finished with another session with Mrs. Forrester and she enjoyed it. Sheila says of course she did; she cannot resist temptation.
