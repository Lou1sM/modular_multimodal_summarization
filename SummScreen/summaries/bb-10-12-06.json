Nick said that he knew that she would forgive him and he was not going to give up on her. Stephanie was still at Brooke's house after Brooke's repeated attempts to get her to leave.  Stephanie tried to convince Brooke of the impact of what Nick had done by sleeping with Bridget, and that she should return to Ridge for RJ's sake. Nick visited Ridge at his Forrester office to tell him to allow Brooke the space she needed to make her decision. Brooke grew more and more frustrated with Stephanie because she wanted some time alone to think and to make the decision herself. Jackie walked in the front door clapping at the convincing speech that Stephanie delivered to Brooke. Jackie made a case for Nick when she stated how much he loved her and how sorry he was for violating their marriage, but that he was totally committed to Brooke and their family. Brooke told both Stephanie and Jackie that she was not going to be the battleground for their fight, and excused herself upstairs and told Stephanie and Jackie to see themselves out when they were finished arguing. \n\n\nThorne presented Taylor with a closed jewelry box and she started, as she has many times before, to break down and tell Thorne the truth about what really happened the night Darla was killed.  Thorne reassured her over and over, then he asked her to open the box.  Taylor said she could not open the box, so Thorne did and asked Taylor to marry him. He told her about how much she had done for him and Allie since Darla's death, and how she was the only woman that could have made such an impact in his life.  Taylor cried and was visibly shaky while she told him that he did not know the whole truth.  Taylor told Thorne that she should not have been driving that night because she had been drinking.  He said this was understandable because of how worried about Phoebe that she was, and Thorne asked her how she could possibly hold herself responsible for Darla's death.  She reiterated and apologized again about how much this information was going to hurt Thorne, and then Taylor finally admitted that she was the driver of the car that hit and killed Darla as Thorne looked at her in total shock and disbelief. \n\n\n",
