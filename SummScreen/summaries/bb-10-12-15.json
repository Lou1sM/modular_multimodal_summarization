    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Pam and Charlie advised Zende to take Nicole to a romantic movie. Zende didn't have a movie in mind, and Pam decided that she had a wardrobe for Zende to be a knight in shining armor. Zende revealed that his plan was a private dinner. Pam figured out that Zende was cooking dinner and said that he had two culinary experts at his service.\n\n\nCharlie offered to let Zende copy the dinner Charlie was making Pam that night -- fresh tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. Pam was surprised Charlie had gotten fresh tomatoes. \"Bought the cans this morning,\" Charlie replied. Charlie explained that Zende needed to use aged gruyere to make an aphrodisiac, and cutting the sandwich into triangles would make for romantic sopping of the soup.\n\n\n\"You sopped soup with someone before me?\" Pam asked. Charlie claimed that sopping had been as far as it had gone. Zende stated that he was making a Forrester pepper steak recipe. Pam said it was Ridge's favorite and asked if Zende wanted her to make lemon bars for dessert. Zende said he had it covered. He left to get cooking, and Pam began grilling Charlie about his past \"sopping.\"\n\n\nAt the mansion, the shocked Nicole asked what Maya had just requested. Maya and Rick knew that surrogacy was a lot to ask of Nicole, and they conveyed that they had other options; however, the baby would feel more like Maya's if Nicole would carry it. Maya said they'd all live together and experience the pregnancy together every step of the way.\n\n\nNicole was caught off guard and asked if Rick and Maya were serious. Realizing that they were serious, Nicole stated that she'd thought the favor had been to go to the store or pick up laundry. Maya knew that surrogacy was a lot to ask. Nicole said they'd done a lot for her, but Rick replied that Nicole didn't owe them anything. Maya conveyed that Nicole didn't have to answer at that moment.\n\n\nRick changed the subject to Zende, and Nicole said Zende was making her dinner that night. \"When a boy makes you dinner...\" Maya hinted, grinning. Nicole acknowledged that she and Zende were getting really close, and he might be the one. \"So maybe not the time to have your sister's baby,\" Maya remarked. Just then, Zende arrived.\n\n\nLater, Rick and Maya were upstairs. Maya stated that they'd dropped a bomb on Nicole, and Maya didn't know if she'd had the right to ask. Rick said Nicole might have been disappointed if they hadn't asked. Maya claimed she'd love any baby regardless of the genes, and she hoped she hadn't freaked Nicole out. Rick thought Nicole had been touched and flattered.\n\n\nMaya admitted that she hadn't thought of Zende, but she should have. She wondered how Zende would feel about it and hoped she didn't ruin the other couple's night by mentioning it. Rick said it was okay, and Nicole and Zende would talk things through. Maya realized it was a big sacrifice. Rick believed Nicole would need time, and he said they all needed to talk it through.\n\n\nRick reminded Maya that there were other options. Maya knew but asked him to imagine having a child who had their genes. Rick believed they'd be the coolest parents on the block, and he was up for the challenge. Maya said she'd cherish the child no matter how it were born, but having one that was part Rick and part Maya was in Nicole's hands.\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Zende prepared food and told Nicole about Charlie's dinner suggestions. Zende said it was the first time he'd made the steak, but he had a backup salad \"just in case.\" Nicole seemed zoned out, and he asked if she was okay. She said she was, and a man cooking for her was a first for her.\n\n\nLater, Zende and Nicole sat to eat dinner at the kitchen island. He noted that she'd been distracted ever since he'd arrived. Nicole stated that he'd been good to her, and she hadn't been very happy before. She recalled that she'd been unhinged when she'd first arrived in the city. Computer programming at UCLA hadn't been for her, but then her whole world had changed by reconnecting with Maya and meeting the Forresters. She felt that all of it was due to Maya.\n\n\nNicole stated that Maya had asked her to do something. Zende believed that Maya had done a lot for Nicole, so Nicole should do whatever it was. Nicole revealed that Maya and Rick wanted her to be their surrogate. Zende asked her to repeat herself.\n\n\nNicole repeated what Maya and Rick had asked her to do, and Zende asked what she'd told them. Nicole said she hadn't answered, and she asked him if she should do it.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Katie and Bill arrived for dinner. Steffy, who hadn't had time to cook, pulled take-out boxes from a bag. Liam told Bill that his steak was on the grill. Katie said it was okay because she was sure Steffy was busy at work. Bill championed Liam, who was helping Steffy and Katie in his two executive positions. Katie mumbled that it was too bad the same couldn't be said for Wyatt.\n\n\nKatie guessed she'd said something wrong, and Liam figured she thought Wyatt was being short-changed. Steffy stated that Liam clearly had more executive experience. Katie remarked that Wyatt might get some if he got an opportunity. \"So let him go find one,\" Bill quipped.\n\n\nKatie added that Wyatt felt as if Ivy was being treated unfairly. Steffy said she'd fixed it and had rehired Ivy after Ivy had gone over her head to Eric. Bill said Eric couldn't force Steffy to do it. Steffy stated that it had all worked out, and she'd given Ivy the job of modeling the bedroom line.\n\n\nKatie didn't think it was Ivy's thing, but Bill called the move brilliant. Katie glared at Bill when he said \"well done\" to Steffy. He asked how Ivy had reacted, and Liam asked to change the subject. Bill asked when the \"coming out\" party was and said it was one show he didn't want to miss.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt and Ivy kissed. He said she seemed more comfortable in the lingerie. Ivy relayed that it was because she wasn't modeling it. She was sure she'd be horrible, but he said she was killing it. Ivy said Wyatt was making it more \"palatable,\" but she wasn't ready to strut her stuff in designer underwear. She felt that Steffy was very transparent with her so-called opportunity.\n\n\nIvy ordered a pizza and decided to change. Wyatt grabbed her by her waist. Pizza and lingerie was a dream of his, and he begged her not to ruin it. She replied that if she had to walk around \"naked...\" She pointed to his pants, which he readily removed.\n\n\nThe couple stood in their underwear, and Wyatt wanted to take it to the next level. Ivy decided that he'd be first, but he replied that he was a good enough guy to help her out of hers first.\n\n\nBefore Wyatt could unlace the back of Ivy's corset, the doorbell rang. Wyatt gave Ivy money and told her to answer the door. Ivy didn't want to do it in her underwear, but he said to get used to it. Ivy snatched the money and opened the door. \"Oh, my lanta!\" the pizza man exclaimed upon seeing Ivy.\n\n\nIvy exchanged the money for the box and said he could keep the change. The pizza man replied that she already had the tip covered, and he offered to return with a pizza the next night. Ivy closed the door on him, and Wyatt laughed about how awesome it had been.\n\n\nWyatt believed that Forrester would sell lingerie faster than they could sew it, and they'd get free pizza for a year. Ivy thought Wyatt was getting a real kick out of it. He replied that she was getting more and more confident, and she could probably pump gas in the outfit. He considered that she'd create long lines, and Ivy tempted him with pizza to get him off the topic.\n\n\n",

Maya laments they both want this so now it's just a matter of how. Zende has something special planned for Nicole tonight but takes a few hints from Charlie and Pam. When they hear that he is going to make a special dinner all by himself and not at a restaurant they offer their culinary services. Katie and Bill have dinner at Liam's. Steffy says she did not have time to cook so they are having takeout of steak and tofu. Bill has brought red and white wine so all can choose. He reminds them that Liam is so busy with two executive positions and Katie chimes in too bad that Wyatt doesn't. Liam realizes she thinks Wyatt is being short changed. Meanwhile Wyatt kisses Ivy who he is trying to convince will be more comfortable and be able to rock this modeling the lingerie for Steffy. Ivy wants to go change since the pizza will soon be here. Wyatt says it is his dream so he wants her to keep the lingerie on. She says if she does, then he has to drop his pants too so he laughs and does. Maya and Nicole are still discussing the details and Nicole admits that she is getting closer and closer to Zende. He might just be the one. Maya is not sure Nicole would even want to consider having a baby right now then. Zende walks in and wonders what is going on. Bill is shocked but thinks the idea brilliant that Ivy will be the new lingerie model. He wants to be there for a front row seat at the coming out showing. Katie thinks she was coerced into it and does not sound like Ivy's thing. The pizza guy gets a huge thrill when Ivy opens the door and gives him $20 and he gets to keep the change. Looking at her he does not even need a tip. Maya hopes she has not ruined the night for Nicole with Zende, bad timing. Nicole picks at her food but finally answers Zende that all she has is because of Maya. And now Maya needs one little favor from her. He agrees that whatever it is then she would do it. Then she drops the surrogate bomb on him.",
