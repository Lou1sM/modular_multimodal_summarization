Thorne begged Taylor for this not to be the truth.  Taylor said that the lie was the life that she was living right now.  Thorne said that he could not believe that the woman who explained to Allie what happened to her mother, and counseled both of them was the killer.  He could not believe that he asked Taylor to marry him being that she was the person who killed Darla. Taylor continued to apologize and tell Thorne that she really loved him and that was the truth. \n\n\nStephanie arrived at Taylor's house and Phoebe told her that Taylor was confessing to Thorne at that moment.  Stephanie was of course horrified by the thought of her confession and what it would do to Thorne.  She demanded Phoebe to tell her where Taylor and Thorne were.  Phoebe hesitated at first, but then Stephanie asked her again more emphatically, and Phoebe said that they were at Big Bear.  Hector walked in and said he knew that would happen because Taylor could not live with the guilt being so close to Thorne.  At that time, Lieutenant Baker walked in the front door saying that he was tired of all of their lies and that he knew that Taylor was driving the car that killed Darla.  He said that had she come forward sooner, he would have been more lenient, but now he was ready to prosecute Taylor to the fullest extent of the law.  \n\n\nTaylor told Thorne that she was ready to confess and pay her debt to society which would allow Thorne to have closure.  She further said that she would never be free from the daily hell that she lived in with Darla's memory haunting her day and night, not allowing her to eat or sleep or ever really be free from it.  Taylor called Lieutenant Baker on his cell phone and confessed that she was the person driving the car that killed Darla.  He asked her to repeat herself on speaker phone, and this allowed Phoebe, Stephanie, and Hector to hear her confession.  Lieutenant Baker called for the Big Bear police to arrest Taylor on charges of Gross Vehicular Homicide, Obstruction of Justice, Driving under the Influence, and Leaving the Scene of an Accident.  Thorne walked outside and Taylor waited inside for the police to arrest her. \n\n\n",
