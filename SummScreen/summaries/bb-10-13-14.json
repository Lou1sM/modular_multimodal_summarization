Disconcerted, Caroline said they didn't even know if Eric would really step down. Ridge was sure it would happen, and her vote for leadership counted. Ridge insisted that, after working with her and experiencing their intimacy, it had to be him and Caroline.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Eric and Ivy arrived as Rick was ending a call with Brooke. Rick said that Brooke was handling the Milan issue, but it was a mess. Eric expressed confidence that Brooke could clear it up, especially with Rick's support team backing her. Rick pulled Ivy aside, and Eric received a text message from Ridge to meet in Eric's office. Eric seemed torn as he glanced at Rick before leaving.\n\n\nCaroline entered next. With one hug of his wife, Rick asked, \"You are all right?\" To him, she seemed on edge, and he noticed that she was shaking. Caroline told him that she'd had to block someone for making rude comments on a breakfast selfie she'd posted earlier.\n\n\nRick left to take care of something, and Ivy asked Caroline what was going on. Caroline looked as frightened as a cat on a ledge, but she said nothing. Ivy flashed a knowing stare, and Caroline realized she needed to talk to someone. Ivy guessed that Caroline's issue involved working with Ridge.\n\n\nCaroline said she had to be careful because of Ridge and Rick's relationship, and things were awkward. Ivy assumed that Caroline felt trapped in the middle of Rick and Ridge's contentious relationship. Caroline replied that it was exactly how she felt.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was in the CEO's office, pinning a white gown that a model was wearing. Eric arrived and complimented the gown, and the model exited. Ridge said he knew what Eric was thinking -- it was that Eric was a businessman and a designer, and he wanted the next generation to lead with the perfect balance of each. \"Rick doesn't have what it takes,\" Ridge concluded.\n\n\nEric said that Rick was the president, and Ridge would respect it if Eric named Rick as the successor. Ridge said he'd try to respect it, but he hated to see Eric hand what they'd built over to a kid. Eric asserted that Rick wasn't a kid; he was an adult who had married a talented designer. Ridge asked if Rick would be promoted because of his wife.\n\n\nEric replied that the promotion would be due to Rick's loyalty, skill, and talent. Eric believed that Rick had stepped up when Ridge had left them without any idea of when he'd return. Ridge asked why Rick's time in Paris had bettered him, but Ridge's time there had signified running away. Eric insisted that Ridge had run away, and it had been over troubles with Brooke.\n\n\nEric didn't fault Ridge for doing what he'd had to do, but Rick had filled the void in Ridge's absence. Ridge announced that he was back, but Eric added that Ridge couldn't draw. Ridge claimed that his talent was returning, and Eric eagerly asked to see.\n\n\nRidge grabbed a pencil, but under the pressure, he couldn't draw anything. He exclaimed that it was returning, and he implored Eric not to make a decision based upon it. Eric said that no matter what, Rick and Ridge would be important to the company. Ridge vowed that he'd draw again, and even if he never picked up another pencil, he knew what design was all about, what it meant to design.\n\n\nRidge stated that his knowledge was why things worked with Caroline, and he believed that she had a big future ahead of her. Eric noted that she was young, talented, and Rick's wife. Rick and Caroline reminded Eric of himself and Stephanie at the onset of the business, and that impressed Eric. Eric remarked that Rick was his son. \"Yeah, and I'm not!\" Ridge exclaimed.\n\n\nEric claimed that he hadn't been saying that. Ridge asked Eric not to make him pay for a cruel trick Stephanie had played upon Eric. Eric believed it was about loyalty and taking the company into the future. Eric was convinced that Rick could do it with Caroline at his side. Ridge asked if she was really that important. \"Yes, she is,\" Eric answered.\n\n\nAgreeing with Eric about Caroline, Ridge proposed that Eric make Ridge CEO, and Ridge would mold her into the designer she could be. Eric recalled putting Ridge in control before, and at that time, Ridge hadn't played well with others. Eric said Ridge only wanted things his way. Ridge responded that he'd changed, and he asked if Eric wanted a lapdog CEO once Eric was gone.\n\n\nEric asserted that he wasn't leaving. He was passing off some responsibility so that he could be free to travel. He declared that he wasn't dead and still owned the business. Eric wanted a CEO that would respect him, not the tyrant Ridge had been in the past. Ridge thought Eric's words were harsh. \"You wanted me gone. Rick didn't do that. Rick respected me,\" Eric stated.\n\n\nRidge insisted that he could do it, but Eric liked the idea of having a new power couple at the helm. He felt that they needed a team, and Ridge exclaimed that he and Caroline were a team. Eric said that the two were just collaborating, but Eric wanted a partnership that transcended home and work.\n\n\nEric felt that Caroline would never have the kind of commitment to Ridge that she had with Rick. Eric hadn't made his decision yet, but he wanted Ridge to understand the reasons that Eric would choose Rick. Eric said he'd make his decision soon.\n\n\nRidge left, and as Eric worked, Rick arrived. He'd seen the dress the model had been wearing earlier, and Eric remarked that they'd have their collection. \"Thanks to Caroline,\" Rick added.\n\n\nRick envisioned a new team that would keep Eric completely involved with every single sketch. Rick believed that, just like Eric had had Stephanie in the beginning, Rick had Caroline, and with Caroline by Rick's side, there was nothing Rick couldn't do for the company.\n\n\nBack in Rick's office, Caroline was alone, pacing the floor and flashing back to Ridge's kiss. Ridge entered, and she asked him why he was looking at her a certain way. He remarked that she reminded him of Caroline Senior. Caroline said she wasn't her aunt, and she was committed to her marriage.\n\n\n\"About the kiss,\" Ridge uttered, nearing her. Caroline stated that it never should have happened, and it never would again. His face hovered closer to hers. Her lips quavered, and she said that she loved her husband. Ridge wondered why, of all the men in the world, Caroline had chosen Rick.\n\n\nCaroline asked Ridge to stop. She said that Rick cared as much about the business as she and Ridge did. Ridge felt that it wasn't the same because, with Rick, it was all about numbers. Ridge said that he and Caroline had found something incredible between them, and she shouldn't deny it.\n\n\nCaroline asked what Ridge meant. Ridge said he knew she didn't want to hurt Rick, but she and Ridge had to live life with no regrets. \"This is it. This is our life. No regrets,\" Ridge said and swept her into long kiss.\n\n\nSuddenly, someone grabbed Carolne's arm from behind. Startled from her reverie, she turned around. It was Ridge, and he asked her what she was doing. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline pulls away from Ridge's kiss. He says they are the future of FC and she knows that. He needs to know who she wants to run it, him or Rick. This intimacy they have, it has to be them. Rick tells his Dad that Brooke is handling things in Milan but what a mess. Ridge calls his dad to his office and Eric likes what he sees on the model. He says Rick does not have what it takes but he does. Caroline interrupts Rick and Ivy but he gives Caroline a kiss and a hug and asks if all is all right. He says she seems on edge. She stammers that she had to block someone on her internet account with her cute omelet breakfast. Later she tells Ivy that she has to tell someone. Ivy says she is all ears. Ridge continues with his dad and Eric sees he still has problems with Rick running the company. Ridge points out that he went to Paris just like Rick did. Eric says no there was a difference. Ridge left because of problems with Brooke. He did not work at FI, he just ran away. Rick has earned his stripes. He is not a 20 year old kid anymore. This is about loyalty and taking this company into the future with his beautiful wife right by his side. Ridge tells Eric okay, let's work with this. Make him CEO and give him Caroline to help mold her into the great designer he knows she can be. Eric says he is not dead. He just wants to pass off the company for a while so he can travel. He does not want a tyrant from the past. Ridge wanted him gone once. Ridge says he is different now. Eric says Rick and Caroline remind him of him and Ridge's mother in the early years, a team....a relationship deeper and more permanent. His working with Caroline is just designing. She will never commit to him. So he wants Ridge to understand he has not made his decision but if he leans toward Rick he wants him to know why. Caroline tells Ivy that it has been a great collaboration with Ridge so far and it is awkward because Rick and Ridge do not get along. Ivy sees where Caroline would be caught in the middle. Rick talks to his father and says he saw the newest model design and it's great, thanks to Caroline. Ridge finds Caroline and she asks why is he staring at her. He says it has been a while but she reminds him so much of his Caroline. She says but she is not and she is committed to her marriage. He says about the kiss .she interrupts and says it is not going to happen again. She loves her husband. Rick says he knows his dad is going to step down but he will always be 100% involved. He and Stephanie ran this for years and now it has come full circle \u0096 Rick and Caroline. With her by his side he is sure there is nothing he can't do for this company. Ridge tells Caroline that it would be a sin not to fulfill her potential so it's not the same as the two of them. She can not deny that something happened between them. He says it is okay to live life. He kisses her and she returns it. But then Ridge speaks and brings her out of the foggy fantasy.",
