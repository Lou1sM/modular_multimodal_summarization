That way, the baby would have Rick and Maya's DNA. Zende was surprised that Nicole had considered Maya's offer, but Nicole explained that Maya had changed her life and helped her in Los Angeles.\n\n\nNicole explained to Zende that she'd been lost when she'd first arrived in Los Angeles, and she was glad that Zende hadn't met her when she'd first arrived. Zende listened intently, but he discouraged Nicole from becoming a surrogate mom for her sister. Nicole remarked that it was a year of her life, and Zende agreed. He suggested that she might want to do something else with her body.\n\n\nThe discussion turned to what surrogacy involved. Nicole knew it required a medical procedure and carrying a baby for nine months. Zende wondered if she was doing it to return the favor her sister had done for her. Nicole said that was what she was thinking.\n\n\nZende noted that he had a selfish concern. \"What about us?\" he asked. Nicole looked thoughtful. She wondered if being a surrogate ruled out a future with Zende. Then, she paused and suggested that Zende not answer.\n\n\nNicole and Zende became less serious and confided that they were very interested in one another. Zende said he thought about Nicole all the time. They kissed, and Nicole teased that she hoped she didn't faint. Zende stopped and said he would clean up dinner.\n\n\nIn the living room at the Forrester mansion, Maya and Rick revisited their discussion with Nicole about surrogacy. Maya confessed to Rick that she felt they had lost perspective when they had asked Nicole to be a surrogate. Rick maintained that they had not pressured Nicole, but Maya said that by asking her, they had unwittingly encouraged her to put pressure on herself.\n\n\nMaya noted that Nicole had acclimated to Los Angeles and to Forrester and had met someone she really cared about: Zende. Maya said that she did want a baby, but involving Nicole might not be the best idea. Rick questioned if Zende and Nicole were in love, and Maya said they needed the chance to find out. Rick said that one way or another, he and Maya would have a little person or two in their lives one day.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Ivy and Wyatt discussed that Steffy had offered Ivy the job as the Intimates line model because she'd known it would make Ivy uncomfortable. Ivy noted that \"Steffy always gets what she wants.\" Wyatt agreed. He said Ivy could fake that she loved getting undressed and wearing her lingerie.\n\n\nWyatt suggested that Ivy try out the words, and Ivy pretended that she was talking to Steffy and maintained that she had gone home, stripped off her clothes, tried on the lingerie, and looked fabulous. She loved it and couldn't wait to model it on the runway and march around Forrester in it. Wyatt and Ivy laughed. Ivy maintained that Steffy would never believe it. Wyatt said it didn't matter. Steffy would be frustrated that Ivy was happy.\n\n\nIvy and Wyatt made out and made love. After, Wyatt reminded Ivy that he was the stronger, smarter, and better Spencer. He worried that Ivy was a million miles away, thinking about Liam. Ivy admitted that she often thought about her past, but she added that she had been stupid when she'd wasted time with Liam. She was happy to be with Wyatt. \"I have everything I want,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Bill, Katie, Liam, and Steffy shared dinner, and Steffy shared that Ivy would be the new face of the Forrester's Intimates line. Bill laughed hysterically. Steffy also laughed. Katie and Liam did not find it funny, but Katie said that Steffy was creative in her management style.\n\n\nThe conversation turned to Steffy's position as president -- making the decision, and Liam's role as vice president -- someone who could have prevented the offer. \"I thought it was very nice of me to offer,\" Steffy said of her willingness to rehire Ivy. Liam was upset.\n\n\nKatie and Bill wondered if Liam still had feelings for Ivy. Liam grew quiet and said that he thought they should all realize that not everyone wanted to strip and parade around in lingerie.\n\n\nBill didn't agree, but Liam quickly wondered if Katie would be interested in doing it. Liam asked Bill how he would feel about it if Katie were a lingerie model. Katie agreed, but Bill stood up ready to strip. They all laughed. Bill and Katie left. Liam and Steffy kissed, but Liam looked troubled.\n\n\nSteffy wondered why Liam was unhappy with her. She guessed that it was his concern for Ivy. Steffy insisted that they would not discuss work issues at home. Liam agreed, but he said her decision-making was affecting all aspects of her life. She reminded Liam that Ivy had said she would do anything to get her job back.\n\n\nLiam said that Steffy's condescending attitude toward women who preferred privacy and modesty was an issue. He felt that Steffy had bullied Ivy into taking a position she didn't want. Steffy argued that it was a smart decision. Steffy said she could not be the face of Forrester, since she had become the president. Liam suggested Maya, but Steffy argued that Maya had to remain the couture model only. Liam said Steffy did not consider other people's feelings like Ivy's -- and Aly's, he said coolly. Steffy grew quiet.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Maya left Rick in the living room and interrupted Zende and Nicole. Zende said that Maya and Nicole needed to talk. He left. Maya said that her earlier offer to Nicole to become a surrogate had sounded like a great idea but might be disaster.\n\n\nNicole said that it wasn't a disaster, and it was important and beautiful. The sisters agreed that they had helped one another. They were grateful to have each other. Maya said she didn't want to damage their relationship, but Nicole said that Maya had not ruined anything. Nicole said she would still consider it. Maya wanted Nicole to be happy. They embraced.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Nicole says she owes Maya so much so she should do anything she says. But Zende says she does not owe her life to her so she can say no to having Maya's baby. Wyatt tells Ivy that she has been so good parading around in her underwear he will now wait on her hand and foot. Steffy is just trying to get under her skin so just tell Steffy that she enjoys this and has no problem. Bill about busts a gut in laughing when he hears Ivy can have her job back but she has to leave her clothes at the door. Liam says Ivy did not discuss it with him but she will be good at any job they give her. Maya tells Rick that Nicole is making dinner for Zende tonight and now she does not think it is right for her to forgo any future she might have with Zende by asking her to have their baby. Liam chastises his dad for making fun and giggling at Ivy for not wanting to take off her clothes. Katie and Bill thank them for the takeout and leave fairly soon. Ivy tries to convince Wyatt that she can convince Steffy that she will truly love this job. She likes looking at herself in this lingerie. It is such a turn-on. Rick tells Maya that they will have a family; she will be a mother, he can guarantee that. And they won't have to wait out this first love of Nicole's. Liam tells Steffy that he is not unhappy but he does have misgivings about Ivy. He thinks this is a mistake by Steffy. She asks him not to bring his work home. But she does wonder what the terrible idea is that she had. He spouts modesty, sexuality, etc. for people that do not feel as she does. Nicole tells Zende that he cooked so she will clean up. She does not want him to tell anyone else what Maya asked her. She's an international star now but this is one thing she can not do. Zende is still leaning toward no. Maybe there is something else she will want to do with her body in the next year. Maya interrupts so Zende leaves. Nicole reveals how Zende thinks and laments that she is beginning to feel that way too. Wyatt tells Ivy that he wishes it were not true but sometimes he thinks she is thinking about Liam. She says yes sometimes she remembers how stupid she was but then she remembers what she has now and how happy she is, so Liam it out of her thoughts. Steffy wonders why Liam is making this a big deal. He tells her that Steffy is better at the lingerie so just call Ivy and tell her. Steffy says who else at FC can fill the bill. Steffy says Ivy said she would do anything and this is anything .and if Steffy is enjoying it then it is poetic justice. Maya tells Nicole that she and Rick did not think it over before asking her. Nicole is beautiful and important to her and Nicole has made her who she is when she was not strong enough. Nicole tells her do not take anything back. She is not saying no just yet. She says yes it is a lot to consider and she can not say yes just now but she also can not say no. She is just grateful that she can do something for Maya, she loves her so much.",
