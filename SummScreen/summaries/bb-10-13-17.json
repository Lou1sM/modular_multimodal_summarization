Ridge replied that Brooke and Bill's interactions weren't a measure of Bill's character. She replied that it was why she couldn't go back.\n\n\nR.J. arrived and noted there was something different. Ridge said Brooke had something to talk to their son about, but it would be at another time. R.J. asked if Brooke would return to Bill's house. Brooke replied that she didn't know what the future held, but she'd had to end her marriage to Bill.\n\n\nR.J. said he'd tried to like Bill. Bill had been fun, but he'd made R.J. think of an alien pretending to be human. Ridge didn't think it was the time for him and his son to talk about their feelings about Bill. Ridge explained that trusting someone was a gamble that could sometimes lead to wondering why one had trusted another in the first place. Ridge owned up to failing Brooke, and he took no pleasure in seeing her go through it again.\n\n\nR.J. had heard Bill say he was best at getting even, and R.J. felt that Brooke was safer with him and Ridge. Brooke assured R.J. she was okay. She just wasn't up for talking much about it. R.J. said he'd forgotten why he'd entered the office, but he'd tell Pam that Brooke and Ridge were in an important meeting.\n\n\nAfter R.J. had left, Ridge said R.J. was quite a kid Brooke had raised with little help from Ridge. Brooke said their son was her greatest accomplishment. Ridge told her that everyone loved her and was there for her. Brooke leaned on his shoulder. He said they were like friends who could pick up where they left off after years apart, and leaning on him was like going back to the old days when they'd been in love, and nothing would change. \"Ridge...\" Brooke said.\n\n\nShaking his head, Ridge said he hadn't meant she'd lean on him that way. Brooke told him that she couldn't, and he added \"yet\" to it. He knew Bill wouldn't let go without a fight. She was adamant that there would be no fight. He asked what had happened, and Brooke said she'd had to get clear about what she could live with.\n\n\nRidge recalled that Brooke had been able to live with Bill tossing Ridge from a helicopter. Brooke responded that Bill had told her that he'd changed. Ridge said that one could believe in promises they couldn't keep when they were faced with losing the one thing they loved.\n\n\nRidge felt that he had to ask if Bill had ever hit Brooke. She replied that he hadn't, but he'd knocked Liam to the ground. Guessing he shouldn't be surprised, Ridge asked what had set Bill off. Brooke wasn't ready to discuss it. Ridge said he wasn't really asking. He just wanted her to know she could lean on him.\n\n\nRidge thought they needed to watch out for their son, who had high hopes. Ridge added that Brooke knew how Ridge got. Brooke said that when they weren't together, he wanted to be, and when they were together, he wasn't sure about it. \"Ouch,\" he replied. He said people changed, and she might give him another chance, though he didn't know what number it would be.\n\n\nBrooke said Ridge's name, and Ridge claimed to be happy to have a small chance to have Logan back in his life. She stated that people thought they'd grown apart. Ridge replied that they could agree it wasn't true. Agreeing, she said it had been that way even when he'd been overseas and they'd talked on the phone about the family.\n\n\nBrooke recalled feeling Ridge's presence in the house during that time. She'd check every room because she knew he liked to surprise people. The surprise had been that he was still gone. Ridge responded that he'd hurt her a great deal. He was sorry and said someone as special as Brooke shouldn't know what heartache felt like. He wanted to make it up to her, if she'd let him.\n\n\nAt Eric's mansion, Eric and Mateo discussed getting an electrician, but Mateo, who said he was well versed in circuitry, offered to look at the problem. Quinn said she and Eric were impressed at Mateo's ability to fix anything. Mateo asked how her back was, and she said it was almost perfect. Eric thanked Mateo for taking care of Eric's wife.\n\n\nAfter Mateo had gone, Eric expressed a desire to keep a handy person like Mateo happy. Quinn wondered how they'd know Mateo was happy, and Eric guessed they didn't know much about the man. Quinn relayed what she knew so far, which was that he had family and was single and eco-conscious. The topic turned to Quinn's single son, and she wished Wyatt would find someone.\n\n\nAs Eric and Quinn worked on the sofa, Quinn thought of women Wyatt could date. She mentioned Charlotte, who always seemed to perk up when Wyatt was around. Not surprised, Eric said Ridge had spoken to Charlotte about \"office romances.\" Quinn wanted to encourage it because Wyatt didn't work at Forrester, but Eric asked if parental matchmaking ever worked.\n\n\nQuinn said Wyatt wasn't even dating, and a man like Wyatt shouldn't make his life about work. Eric reasoned that Wyatt probably had other interests that he kept to himself. \"Maybe they're athletic,\" Quinn replied, and Eric sheepishly put his glasses on.\n\n\nLater, Quinn was placing a big bouquet of flowers on the table behind the sofa when Mateo swooped in to stop her from twisting her back. Quinn asked for an update about the electrical issue. Mateo thought there might have been a short in the box, and they could have had a fire. He asked her to tell Eric and her son to stay away from it until Mateo got back.\n\n\nQuinn replied that her son no longer lived there. Mateo guessed that Mr. Spencer was just visiting because Mateo had seen Wyatt next door. Quinn was surprised to hear it when Mateo said he'd seen Wyatt driving through the neighbor's gate. Quinn assumed Wyatt might be dropping off something for Will and asked how long it had been since Mateo had seen the car. Mateo relayed that it had been a couple of hours.\n\n\nLater, Eric entered the living room, where Mateo was, and he asked if Mateo had seen Quinn. Mateo indicated that she'd gone next door. Eric believed that Mateo was mistaken because Katie and Quinn didn't get along. Mateo figured it would be fine because Wyatt was there.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Wyatt and Katie had lunch that he'd gotten from a food truck. Katie needed to get back to work, but Wyatt wasn't ready to end their time together. He wanted to open the patio, but she said Quinn might see him out there. He asked if Katie really had to get back to work, and they kissed.\n\n\nKatie called Forrester to say she'd be working from home. She told Wyatt that it gave them some time. Wyatt wondered how much time they really had because of Eric. She was sure Eric wouldn't tell anyone about them, but Wyatt said Brooke could walk in. Katie conveyed that she'd already seen Brooke that day. Wyatt didn't think Brooke would break up with Bill, but Katie said other men wound up being a footnote in the saga of Brooke and Ridge.\n\n\nKatie and Wyatt wondered what they'd do with their day together, and she suggested playing a card game. He asked if she knew of any nonverbal games they could play upstairs. Katie said she could think of four, and the two kissed their way up to the bedroom.\n\n\nDownstairs, Quinn knocked and called for Katie. Entering the house, Quinn said the door was unlocked. Quinn called for her son. When she heard nothing, she figured that Mateo had been mistaken. Quinn turned to leave, but she heard a noise and decided to ascend the stairs.\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Wyatt and Katie were beneath the covers. Quinn opened the door, and Katie shrieked, covering up Wyatt. Quinn asked who was in the bed with Katie. Katie yelled at Quinn to get out of her house, but Quinn demanded to know who was in bed with Katie. Katie asked if it was Quinn's business. \"I don't know, Katie, is it?\" Quinn asked.\n\n\nWyatt pulled the covers off his head, and Quinn screamed, \"No, no, no!\"\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke runs into Ridge at Forrester's and says she just could not go home now. He says she brought out the best in Bill but even that was not good enough so he understands. RJ walks in and says looks like something has changed. Brooke says she does not know what the future will be but she is not going back home to Bill. Ridge says they were just now discussing it so they will tell RJ more later. RJ says he will leave them alone for now so they can get back to their discussion. Brooke leans her head on Ridge's shoulder. He tells her it is like old times when they were younger and he is going to hang on to those words \"not yet\". He says he has made promises he could not keep and he is not going to ask her to do that. Slowly she tells him about Bill knocking his own son to the ground but she is not ready to tell him why. He says he knows he has hurt her in the past and he is sorry. He wants to make up for that. Eric needs another electrical outlet. Mateo even offers to do it himself; another one of his talents. Eric says he does enough so that is not necessary; just call an electrician. He tells Quinn that she better keep Mateo happy as he is a man of many talents. Then she switches over to Wyatt and perhaps fixing him up with Charlotte at the office. She seems to perk up when Wyatt is around. Eric chides her for being the ultimate matchmaker. Wyatt talks Katie into taking the day off at work and just working at home. Mateo lets slip to Quinn that he saw her son at Katie's this morning and he's been there a couple of hours. She's curious. There is a knock at Katie's door but no answer. Quinn walks on in calling out Katie and Wyatt's name. She thinks she must be wrong until she hears a big thump upstairs and calls out if everything is all right. She walks on into the bedroom and Katie shrieks; Wyatt dives under the covers. Quinn demands to know who that is and finally Wyatt pokes his head out. Quinn screams NO!",
