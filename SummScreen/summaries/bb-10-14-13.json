    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Katie and Bill butted heads over how Katie had conducted the business meeting, and Katie stated that she wouldn't tolerate Bill's disrespect. He claimed he hadn't disrespect her, but she said his words belied his actions. She wondered how things had become that way.\n\n\nBill predicted that Katie would ruin the company. He said that he cared about her, but Katie replied that he didn't have faith in her. He stated that faith could only go so far. She reasoned that she could learn quickly what she didn't know in business; however, she guessed she hadn't learned quickly enough personally to hold on to him.  Bill said that holding on to him was another matter.\n\n\nKatie conveyed that she wanted and needed Bill at the company. Bill was aware of that, but he believed that it wouldn't work because their styles were too different. He said that, while he couldn't go along with her style, she fit perfectly into his. She replied that the company belonged to her, and she'd run it and prove him wrong. Bill wished her luck, and as he left, he added that she'd need it.\n\n\nLater, Dani arrived with Will. Dani remarked that everyone loved Katie for the daycare center, and Katie quipped that it was too bad the fans hadn't been in the board meeting. Dani said even though Bill was mean, Katie had the respect of everyone at the business.\n\n\nKatie lamented the way things had become in Will's life. She'd never imagined he'd have a broken home, shared visitation, and lonely nights. \"I asked Bill how it had come to this -- but I know who's to blame,\" Katie bitterly stated. Dani said that Katie was surrounded with support, but Katie noted that Bill hadn't even asked about Will.\n\n\nDani reasoned that Bill had been dealing with a lot during the meeting, and Katie guessed she'd been tough on him. Dani felt that Katie had needed to do that because Bill had been out of control. Katie replied that he'd been fighting for his life and company. Dani advised Katie not to feel sorry for Bill. Katie claimed that she wasn't doing that, but each time she looked at Will, she realized what she'd lost.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke suspected that the Steffy tribute held significance for Liam, but Liam replied that it really didn't. To him, it was a final farewell to Steffy. He insisted that Steffy was his past, and Hope was his future, but Brooke questioned what the video had meant to Steffy.\n\n\nLiam assumed that it had represented what everyone should know -- that his marriage to Steffy had meant something. Brooke contended that Steffy hadn't needed a personal tribute to understand that the marriage had been meaningful. Liam asserted that Steffy had been through a lot with the loss of the baby. He felt that the video had let Steffy know that he'd cared, and it had freed her from guilt.\n\n\nLiam felt that he and Hope could work things out because she was still wearing his ring. Brooke advised him to step back and let Hope figure out whom she'd spend her life with. \"No, no, no! No. That decision has already been made. We're getting married. Nothing has changed,\" Liam responded.\n\n\nAt that moment, Bill arrived and asked if Liam had spoken to Hope. Liam replied that he was waiting for Brooke to reveal where Hope was. Bill and Brooke expressed their opinions about the situation, but Liam asserted that he knew what Hope needed. He said that she needed to know that he belonged only to her, and in his mind, that was true.\n\n\nLiam again asked where Hope was. Brooke reluctantly revealed that Hope was at the cabin on the estate, but as Liam started to head out, Brooke said there was something more. She revealed that Wyatt was with Hope. Liam thought that it was no surprise, since Wyatt had sent the video to Hope.\n\n\nBill doubted Wyatt would have gotten access to it, but without a response, the heated Liam rushed out of the door in search of Hope. Brooke suggested that Bill regulate things between his sons, but Bill reasoned that the best way for Hope to make a decision was to have both men in her face.\n\n\nBrooke asked how the board meeting had gone, and Bill explained that he'd been ejected from the meeting for voicing his opinions about Katie selling the yacht and retreat to spend money on frivolous nonsense for the employees. Brooke said she was sorry, but Bill claimed not to care if Katie ran the business into the ground.\n\n\nBill changed the subject to a surprise activity he had in store that evening. As Brooke tried to guess what they'd do, Bill seemed distracted. Brooke offered to do the activity later, but Bill said it was one of his passions, but he hadn't had the time to put his feet into it for a while. Bill told Brooke to close her eyes; to be sure they were closed, he made her put a pillow over her face until he returned.\n\n\nWhen Bill returned, he carried mountain-climbing gear in his arms.  \"Wow! What is that?\" Brooke exclaimed. Bill replied that it was their new hobby, and he asked what she thought of it.\n\n\nIn Brooke's cabin on the estate, Wyatt kissed Hope and said that there would be no Steffy or any other woman for him. Hope took out her ring and stared at it. Wyatt said he'd get her another ring without baggage attached to it, and she'd begin a new life with someone who loved only her.\n\n\nWyatt asked Hope to say that she understood that he'd always be there for her. Hope responded with a kiss. He uttered that she'd be okay, but she replied, \"I am okay.\" They kissed again.\n\n\nHope pulled away and said she needed to talk to Liam. Wyatt replied that she'd heard Liam's excuses far too many times. The kissing continued, and Liam opened the front door. Shocked, he stared at Wyatt and Hope. When they saw Liam, Wyatt grinned, and Hope gasped.\n\n\nLiam told Wyatt to leave, but Wyatt refused. Liam was prepared to force Wyatt to leave, but Hope intervened to say it wouldn't go down that way. Liam noticed that she wasn't wearing the engagement ring, and she said she'd taken it off. \"You're not doing this again,\" Liam said with a groan. Wyatt retorted that she'd already done it, but Liam ordered Wyatt to stay out of it.\n\n\nHope stated that Liam had done something unforgivable by reaching out to Steffy, and he'd made a video to express how much Steffy had meant to him. Liam replied that Steffy had meant a lot to him, and Hope already knew that. He insisted that it was over, and the video had been a farewell.\n\n\nWyatt said that, if he were Steffy, he wouldn't have seen the video as a farewell.  Liam assumed that meant that Wyatt had seen it, but Wyatt claimed that Hope had filled him in about it. Liam said Steffy hadn't sent the video, and feeling accused, Wyatt declared that he hadn't sent it, either. Hope said it didn't matter who'd sent it because she'd needed to see it.\n\n\nHope had felt that she and Liam could get through anything, but she couldn't deal with him reconnecting with Steffy. Liam asserted that he wasn't doing that, and there was no Steffy in his life. He declared that the ring belonged on Hope's finger, and he and Hope deserved to be married. \"No exceptions. No more waiting. I'm not gonna let him or anyone get between us!\" he vowed. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope takes the ring that Wyatt just took off of her finger and slips it in her pocket. She looks up at Wyatt and he leans down and kisses her. He tells her there is only her. There will never be anyone else in his life ..no Steffy ..just her. Liam pleads with Brooke that she must know where Hope is so just please tell him. Brooke points out to him that he took the time to make the video for Steffy. That was not on impulse; that took time and planning. He says it really wasn't. The whole point was that it was the final goodbye to Steffy. Brooke replies that he knew it would hurt Hope so she doesn't see why he did it. He counters with that Hope is his future and Steffy is his past, so if Brooke will just tell him where Hope is they can work this out. He says that Hope is making way too much of this video and now so is Brooke. She says he had to know that it would have a major impact on Steffy. Liam says but at least she knows now that their marriage meant something. Brooke retorts that she didn't need her own personal tribute to know that. Liam chastises her by saying she is wrong. Look at all the terrible things that Steffy went through with the loss of the baby and all so she needed this video to prove that their marriage was real and that he did care for her. Once again he begs Brooke to tell him where Hope is. After all, she still has his engagement ring on her finger. Hope holds up the ring and Wyatt tells her that he will get her another ..one that doesn't have a lot of baggage attached to it. This feels so right. He says this time she is starting a new life with someone who loves only her. Bill and Katie continue their little debate on who should be running the company. She says she takes full responsibility of the company with new leadership. He mocks that if the board meeting was any indication of her leadership, then She says he was treating her with zero respect and bullying her and she is not going to take that from him anymore. He tells her she does not have the experience and despite what she thinks, he does still care about her and doesn't want to see her and the company go thru what is probably gonna happen. She says she does want him there. She needs him. He says there isn't any way that would work. Her method of working is different than hers. He says he'd have to run the company. She says then it is hers to run. He says good luck and she is going to need a lot of it. Dani brings little Will in to see Katie. She tells hr that she held her own today at the meeting and she is very proud of her. Katie says that seems to be her life now, Will and running the company but at least she is no longer in the perpetual shadow of the great Bill Spencer. And she realizes now just how much she has lost. Brooke tells Liam that she thinks he really just needs to step back and leave Hope alone for a bit and let her make some decisions. Liam doesn't think she needs to make any decisions. Brooke says yes she does; like who she is going to spend the rest of her life with. Liam is incensed and says no. That has been settled. It is with him. Bill walks in and wonders why Liam is hanging around there and not with Hope. Liam says a certain someone won't tell him where Hope is. He says he knows what Hope wants to hear that she is his one and only. And he is not going to stand around here debating them so Brooke just needs to tell him where Hope is. She hesitates a moment and then says Hope is at the cabin. He turns to leave and she stops him by saying there is more he needs to know. Wyatt tells Hope that he's there for her. He will always be there and he needs to know that she knows that. She puts her arms around his neck and passionately kisses him. Afterwards he asks if she is all right. She says she is. He quips how could she not be, and then kisses her again. Brooke tells Liam that Hope is not alone; she is with Wyatt. He says of course; he should have guessed that. After all he is the one who sent her the video. He goes storming out and Brooke tells him to cool off. He grumbles that he will show her cooling off. Brooke asks Bill to do something but he says it will be okay. His sons will handle this. Mainly Hope just needs to choose since they are both in love with her. He tells her about Katie and the board meeting. And now he is out of it and doesn't care if Katie runs the company into the ground. He's going to find a new passion that will include Brooke. He makes her close her eyes while he runs outside to bring in something to show her. When she is allowed to open her eyes, there Bill stands with both hands and arms and waist all draped with equipment, and a pick axe and rope like for mountain climbing. Wyatt and Hope kiss several more times until she finally pulls away and says they have to stop this. She needs to talk to Liam first. Too late Liam opens the door. He doesn't charge in though. He remains silent at the door drinking it all in. Wyatt turns around and sees Liam. Liam tells Wyatt that he can leave now. Wyatt responds that no, he's afraid he can't do that. A little tougher, Liam says he could come over there and make him leave. Hope sees the danger and jumps in between them. She says this is not going down like this. Liam asks her if she will tell Wyatt to leave. Then he notices and asks Hope where her ring is. She says she took it off. Bewildered, he says oh, she's not doing this again. Wyatt utters that she already has. Liam tells him to stay out of this. Hope tells Liam that he did something unforgivable. He reached out to Steffy. Still unable to admit he did anything wrong, Liam says he did not reach out to Steffy. She asked him for the video and he made it. Hope says to prove to Steffy how much she meant to him. Hope already knew that otherwise he would have never married Steffy. He says that is all over now and the whole point was just to say goodbye. Wyatt says if he were Steffy and he saw the video that he would not think it was to say goodbye. Liam sarcastically says thanks, now he knows Wyatt saw the video. Wyatt says actually no. He did not send the video to Hope but she told him about it. Hope tells Liam there is no need to get all bothered about this. It doesn't matter who sent it, she needed to see it. She says they could have gotten through anything ..anything at all but not him re-connecting with Steffy again. Liam says there is no Steffy in his life. And he's not going to accept this. They deserve to be married and he's not going to let \"him\" or anyone else come between them.",
