Caroline said there was no way she would collaborate with him any longer. \"I am married,\" she said. Ridge quizzed her about why she was so flustered every time they were together. \"We are a team, and I'm not gonna let that go,\" Ridge said. Ridge eyed Caroline. \"Quit looking at me like that with those eyes. It's confusing,\" Caroline said.\n\n\nRidge countered that they had something very special that only happened once in a lifetime. Caroline argued that Ridge wanted her on his team because he wanted to be the top dog at Forrester. She added that they had kissed each other, and it was not okay. \"I'm incredibly disappointed in myself,\" she said. Ridge encouraged her to stop overthinking it.\n\n\nCaroline countered that Ridge had given her all the attention he had in order to use her. She admitted she had feelings she couldn't explain, and she worried about them. She reminded Ridge that he had been engaged to Katie. He advised her that they had a passion for work. \"You keep your hands to yourself, and I need to keep my lips to myself, and that is just the way it has to be,\" Caroline said as she turned away. She walked away. \n\n\nRidge smiled. \"I am married to Rick, and what about Katie?\" Caroline said. Ridge told her she had married the wrong man. \"He's not on your level, and he never will be,\" Ridge said. He added that they both had passion for the company, and he wanted Caroline to run the company with him as CEO and her as his partner.\n\n\nCaroline refused to side with Ridge over her husband. Ridge noted that Rick didn't know how to fulfill Caroline. \"You can do better,\" he said. Ridge told her that they were the future of Forrester. Caroline accused him of being a cold liar. \"How dare you?\" she said.\n\n\n\"I don't lie,\" Ridge answered. Ridge grabbed Caroline and kissed her again. She prepared to slap him, but Ridge grabbed her hand. Caroline grabbed Ridge and kissed him passionately then ran away. Ridge looked surprised and shaken.\n\n\nOn the Forrester rooftop, Ivy and Liam had lunch, and Liam teased that he had no intention of taking his shirt off and pumping iron like the rest of the people exercising on the roof. Ivy giggled that she hadn't expected him to remove his shirt, but she liked the idea.\n\n\nIvy said she liked getting fresh air on the rooftop because it kept her away from the drama. Liam said that he had enjoyed time with Ivy and the Forresters at dinner. He laughed as he said that he'd had a great time talking to her dad. They discussed that Hope was pregnant, and Wyatt would probably claim that the Hope for the Future diamond had created a human. They laughed. Liam invited Ivy to dinner at his house. She agreed to meet him later.\n\n\nIn Hope's office, Hope set a book down on her desk, and Aly interrupted. Aly pointed out that Wyatt's mother had manipulated Liam and Hope again. Aly told Hope that if Hope was never going to return to Liam, Aly wanted Ivy and Liam to get together. Hope didn't know why Aly insisted on telling Hope about Liam.\n\n\n\"Why are you with Wyatt?\" Aly exclaimed. Hope turned away, and Aly saw the book When You're Expecting on Hope's desk. Aly asked if the book belonged to Hope. \"Yep. I'm pregnant,\" Hope replied.\n\n\nAly and Hope discussed that Wyatt, Liam, and Quinn knew about the pregnancy. Aly surmised that Hope had stayed with Wyatt because of the baby. \"I'm in love with Wyatt,\" Hope said. Aly wished that Liam and Hope could have been together.\n\n\nHope maintained that she had a life with Wyatt. She wanted Aly to stop talking about Liam. Aly reported that Liam had spent a lot of time with Ivy, and she knew they would fall in love. Aly left.\n\n\nLiam entered. Hope asked if Liam had spent a lot of time with Ivy. Liam agreed he and Ivy had spent time together, and he had met Ivy's father. \"I just want you to be happy,\" Hope said, but she was frustrated. \"We almost made it. We almost got our life back. God, what happened to us?\" she exclaimed. Liam patted Hope on the back, and Hope threw her arms around Liam.\n\n\nLater Ivy and Aly discussed that Hope was pregnant, and Aly was convinced that it was the only reason Hope had stayed with Wyatt. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Ridge encourages a flustered Caroline to not fight her feelings for him and to not settle for a life with Rick. Caroline refuses to put her marriage on the line by continuing to work on the collection with Ridge. Aly questions Hope\u2019s reasoning for remaining in her marriage to Wyatt after learning that she is pregnant. Feeling the need to move on from Hope, Liam asks Ivy out on another date. Hope and Liam come face-to-face for the first time since she chose Wyatt over him.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline rushes away from Ridge. He follows and she says she needed a moment. He says he is flattered that she is flustered every time she is around him and he will let it go. She asks him to stop looking at her like that with those eyes. It is getting hot in here. She is not going to risk her marriage to Rick by being a team with Ridge. She just can't. Ridge is mentoring her and giving her all this attention but she has a husband that she loves. She needs to be happy with what she has. So maybe they are confusing their passion for work for passion with each other. He needs to keep his hands to himself and she will keep her lips to herself. That is just the way it has to be. Aly seeks out Hope and says she has not had much time to talk to her. She thought for sure she would go back to Liam once she knew the truth. She says she and Ivy have become close and if Hope isn't going to be with Liam then she'd like Ivy to be. So Hope needs to stake her claim now if she intends to. She still has time to change her mind. Hope says no, there is no chance. She is not going to change her mind. She confirms that she is pregnant. She had a feeling all day so just went ahead and took the test. Aly understands now. Hope was going back to Liam but knowing she was pregnant changed everything. Ivy and Liam have lunch at the commons on the rooftop. He says he is enjoying getting out of his office and being with her, but no way is he going to take off his shirt and pump iron. He asks if her father is still here or gone back to Australia. She says he has, probably having lunch with the Prime Minister. He tells her that he had a really good time at her party that night, the best one he has had in a really long time. She confides in him that Caroline should be happy while collaborating with Ridge but she seems a little frazzled. Liam asks if she has seen Wyatt lately. He is sure that he will be making the big announcement about the baby soon. He probably will even have a gigantic press conference and say look what the diamond did. Liam says he has a plan and she needs to come to his house tonight and he will explain it all to her. He's mysterious but she says ok. Hope tells Aly that she is in love with Wyatt, there is no going back to Liam. Aly says she understands but she knows she was right that Hope intended to go back to Liam. Hope says she is married to Wyatt and she is expecting his child. She is sorry that this hurts Aly, but tells her to quit saying she is in love with Liam as it makes her sad, so do not bring it up again. Caroline tells Ridge that he will be okay soon and not need her at all. She is just going to pretend none of this is happening. He says the possibilities are endless. She gets it, he wants to be CEO and will do anything to get her to side with him so he can be top dog. She says she is not stupid. Ridge says everybody is replaceable. Rick does not have the passion to run the company and he doesn't even know how to satisfy her. She can do better. He says he does want to be CEO and he wants to run the company with her. She says he is trying to take advantage of her. How dare he. He kisses her passionately and says he does not lie. She grabs him and kisses him passionately but then runs out. Aly catches up with Ivy and says she has been talking to Hope. All makes sense now as Hope is pregnant with Wyatt's child. Hope runs into Liam before he leaves. She tells him that Aly was just here and she knows now. She also states that he was spending a lot of time with Ivy so she assumes they are dating. He stammers and she says she just wants him to be happy. She asks what happened to them. They almost made it. She leans her head on his shoulders and then gives him a hug.",
