    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Hope's office at Forrester, Hope met with Liam, and she repeatedly lamented that she and Liam had been so close to having a life together many times. Hope wondered how it had happened, and they discussed that they had been manipulated, but they had also allowed it to happen. Liam asked how Hope felt.\n\n\nLiam said that he'd done some reading on pregnancy symptoms, nausea, and morning sickness. Hope thanked him for worrying about her. They both grew teary eyed. \"Liam, I love you so much for caring,\" she said. \n\n\nLiam worried about Quinn, but Hope maintained that she and Wyatt had discussed that Quinn was not allowed anywhere near Hope or the baby. Liam advised a new security system. Hope promised to be a mother lion where her baby was concerned. Liam warned that she would always be looking over her shoulder.\n\n\n\"I know what she's capable of,\" Liam said. Liam received a text message, and said he had to leave. Hope inquired if it was about work, but he said that it had been from Ivy. Hope looked despondent and admitted that she was jealous. Liam hugged her, and Hope left.\n\n\nAt Hope and Wyatt's, Wyatt entered, and Quinn walked out of another room. Wyatt advised her that she was not permitted to be there, but Quinn argued that she was his mother. Wyatt reminded her that she had threatened his wife. Quinn refused to be the exiled grandmother. \n\n\nQuinn insisted that she had apologized and expected to be forgiven. She maintained that she was not a controlling bitch of a parent, but Wyatt scoffed. Quinn insisted she would be part of Wyatt's family. Wyatt disagreed. \"Hope and I are having a baby, and whatever Hope wants, she gets. She doesn't want you to be a part of our life,\" he said. Quinn looked hurt.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Ivy and Aly talked on the rooftop. They agreed that Hope had stayed with Wyatt only because of the baby. They worried about Wyatt's mother. \"Poor Liam,\" Aly said, but Ivy wondered if Hope and Liam had really been meant to be together if they had tried and failed so many times. \n\n\n\"Hope and Wyatt made that baby themselves,\" Ivy pointed out. Aly agreed, and she said it opened the door for Ivy and Liam. Ivy smiled and shared that Liam had told her father how she was sophisticated and had been the only reason Liam had survived the entire Hope situation. \"I'm so happy for you,\" Aly said. Ivy said that Liam had invited her to dinner. Aly was convinced that Liam and Ivy were going to be good together.\n\n\nAt Hope and Wyatt's place, Hope arrived and asked about Wyatt's day. She apologized for her position on his mother. Quinn came out of another room and said she was glad she had caught Hope at home. Hope coldly told Quinn that she had nothing to say to her. Quinn started to argue, but Hope interrupted and advised Quinn that she was not invited back into Hope and Wyatt's home. \n\n\nQuinn whined that Wyatt was the only family she had. \"I am not accountable for that,\" Hope said. Quinn begged Hope to forgive her. Quinn reminded Hope that her mother was also going to be a grandmother and would be crushed if Hope had turned her away. \"Imagine the pain that she would feel if she could never be a part of your baby's life,\" Quinn said. Quinn continued that babies should draw families together, but Hope stared at her coldly and did not respond.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Ivy arrived, and she was impressed that Liam had lit candles and started a fire in the fireplace. Liam opened wine and poured it. They agreed they had each saved one another's lives in one way or another. Ivy teased that Liam had endured a grilling by her dad, but Liam said he had done all the talking. \"So what are we drinking to?\" Ivy asked. \"New beginnings,\" Liam responded, and they toasted. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Quinn shows up unannounced for a visit with Wyatt and attempts to convince her son into allowing her into his family\u2019s world. Wyatt puts Quinn in her place about the new order of priorities in his life. Hope and Liam share an emotional moment as they discuss her marriage and pregnancy.

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope and Liam look at each other and wonder how it all came to this. They were so close but let it slip away. He says once again they were manipulated by others, but Hope says yes but the truth is in some way they let it happen to them. He is concerned for her and asks how she is feeling ..any morning sickness, or how she feels about Quinn being still in the picture. Hope says she and Wyatt have discussed it and she doesn't care if Quinn accepts it or not but she is not to be close to Hope or the baby. He asks if she has been to a doctor but she manages to avoid that question. He says he knows Wyatt will protect her but she really should check on getting a new security system. Quinn will be circling the house like a vulture. Hope is to call him if he can help in any way with Quinn. She thanks him but says this is not his problem. She is going to be the best mother she can be, like a mama lion. He gets a text and must go to Ivy. Hope says sure he must go. He says Ivy is just a friend. Hope says but she wants to be more. Hope is jealous of them. She tells Liam that she is going home to her husband and has some baby books to read. Wyatt comes home to find Quinn there. He tells her she is not supposed to be here. Hope sets the rules and Quinn is not welcome there any more. Quinn explains how terrible it is to be forbidden to come there and later to see her own grandchild. He needs to be a man and he needs to set the rules. He tells her she did all of this on her own. She claims she has apologized and made atonement. She admits to making some mistakes and she probably will again but she intends to be the best grandmother ever. She tells him that he has to talk to his wife and get through to her. She will not be an exiled grandmother. He says that is what scares him and Hope to death. She makes all these apologizes and promises and then breaks all of them. She needs to take up crochet and knit a blanket and then maybe things will change for her. He laments that he loves this woman and he is going to protect her no matter what. If Hope finds Quinn threatening and doesn't want her around then so be it. He says she did the best she could when he was growing up but he wants more than that for his son or daughter. He knows he is her priority but she is going to have to accept it, she is not his anymore. Liam is no longer an issue. Quinn is the issue. Whatever Hope wants, Hope gets and she does not want Quinn to be a part of her life. Ivy and Aly discuss the situation. Aly tells her that she knows Ivy likes Liam and if he is not going to end up with Hope then she hopes it will be Ivy. They will be good for each other. Ivy says if Liam ever gets over Hope she thinks Aly is right. Hope surprises Wyatt and Quinn and she tells Quinn she is not supposed to be there, so what does she want? Quinn goes into her poor grandma routine again .that she has apologized, had tons of therapy and it is not fair for her to be purged from her family. She just wants to be invited back into her family. Hope is adamant and says Quinn knows how Hope feels about that so there is nothing more to discuss. She will not forgive her. There are consequences for her actions and that price now is expulsion. Quinn begs more. They are family and she is trying to improve. Throwing her out is not the answer. Babies are supposed to bring people together. She wants Hope to look into her heart and forgive her. Ivy shows up at Liam's. She says it is beautiful and she is impressed with his barbecuing skills. He pours her some wine and she tells him that anything he needs she will be there for him. He says he knows and he appreciates her. They drink to new beginnings.",
