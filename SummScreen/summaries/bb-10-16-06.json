Sensing that she is upset, he thinks she is angry with him, but she assures him that she is not upset about the divorce.  Since she isn't mad at him, Ridge doesn't understand why she never responded to any of his emails or calls while he was away.  Phoebe explains that she was lying to so many people and she didn't want to add him to the list.  Concerned, he asks her if she is in some kind of trouble.  She confesses that Taylor is the one who hit Darla.  Ridge can't believe it and demands to know why she didn't tell him sooner.  Phoebe tells Ridge that he was the reason Taylor was drinking that night, but no one blames him. She goes on to tell him that it was an accident and  drinking wouldn't have made a difference because anyone could have hit Darla that foggy night.  Ridge admits that he knew Taylor was in trouble and feels bad that he never tried to help her. He now understands how guilty Taylor must have felt and why she took Hector in and was so kind to Thorne.  Phoebe agrees that guilt was the reason  why Taylor reached out to Thorne in the beginning, but  says now Taylor has truly fallen in love with him.

She tells him how angry she was  the night she found out, which was the same night that Hector's house burned down.
