Ridge claimed it was nothing more than him needing Thomas in Paris. Steffy asked why, and Caroline claimed it was to up the momentum of their new line in international markets.\n\n\nSteffy said Hope and Thorne were already in place overseas. Steffy asserted that, as president, she'd deserved a heads-up. Ridge apologized, but she felt there more was going on. She added that Ridge and Thomas were partners. Pointing at himself and Caroline, Ridge said they were the partners.\n\n\nSteffy assumed that Ridge was really angry about the punch and said Thomas had apologized. Ridge responded that Thomas had been out of line, and sometimes, apologies weren't enough. Ridge said he hadn't enjoyed a punch from his son, but Thomas had gone where he was needed.\n\n\nSteffy asked how her brother could work on the line and assist the design team from another continent. She said it wasn't fair, and Thomas had proven his loyalty. Caroline said that Thomas could still be successful, and at an international design house, the staff was sometimes required elsewhere. Steffy yelled that Thomas was family, not staff.\n\n\nSteffy believed that Thomas was good at his job and had been learning from Ridge. Ridge stated that Thomas would remain in Paris, and the case was closed. He handed Steffy the proofs of Thomas and Caroline and said it was the wrong direction, and he'd let Steffy know when he had another one. She said it felt as if he'd banished her brother. Ridge asserted that it wasn't about feelings; it was business.\n\n\nSteffy offered to mediate between father and son. Caroline said to let it go. \"Ridge made his decision,\" Caroline snippily said. Steffy glared at Caroline and walked out.\n\n\nCaroline told Ridge to breathe before he imploded. Ridge murmured that Steffy could be relentless. Caroline said Steffy was his daughter, but the punch was a valid reason. Ridge felt it would only work for so long. Ridge's phone rang, and he groaned, answering it.\n\n\nThomas was on the line. He'd expected to hear from Ridge by then. Thomas said he'd gotten to Paris safely, but he didn't know why he was there. He apologized again for the punch. \"Can't talk,\" Ridge replied and clicked off the line.\n\n\nRidge told Caroline that Thomas wanted to know why he was in Paris and why his father was angry with him. Ridge said Thomas couldn't have the answers; no one could. Caroline looked upset. Ridge said it was their baby, and no one could know the truth, especially not Thomas. Caroline stated that it \"is\" the truth; it was their truth and their baby.\n\n\nRidge said Caroline might be tempted to tell someone, but she disagreed. Caroline wanted their family. She said they were in it together, and she'd do whatever it took. They hugged.\n\n\nIn the design office, Zende and Nicole kissed more and made a pact to always put honesty first. Zende didn't want to seem demanding, and he knew that she wanted to give a great gift to her sister. Nicole said she'd be changing Maya's life, just as Maya had changed Nicole's life. He pointed out that Nicole would put her life on hold for a year, and there was no way it wouldn't affect their relationship.\n\n\nNicole stated that she knew a baby would crimp their style, but she asked, \"How do I say no?\" Zende told her to say that she'd like to help, but it was too much. Nicole said her sister would never have a baby with Maya's DNA without Nicole. He loved how eager she was to help Maya. Nicole said Maya had changed her life, and maybe Nicole was meant to return the favor.\n\n\n\"Not this way,\" Zende said. He reasoned that even without Nicole's involvement, Maya and Rick could still adopt and have a strong family foundation. Zende could attest to it. Nicole agreed that it could happen, but there was a possibility that Maya could have a child with her own genes. He replied that Nicole's life would stop, and Nicole asked if their relationship would stop.\n\n\nZende insisted that it wouldn't be the same. On his phone, he got a message telling him to visit Carter. Before going, Zende said he and Nicole had their future before them. They could do anything and go anywhere. He didn't want to pressure her; he just hoped she made them the priority.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Maya conveyed that having more education about the procedures made her more comfortable about asking Nicole to carry a child. Rick and Maya agreed to control their reactions and never make Nicole feel guilty if she turned them down. Maya asked if Rick had any reservations or worries, but he said she could count him all the way in.\n\n\nThe couple discussed informing Nicole of how long and involved the process was. They wanted to make sure she knew everything because at some point in it, there would be no turning back. The couple agreed upon getting the best care for Nicole. Rick didn't want them to set themselves up for disappointment and reminded Maya that Nicole hadn't agreed yet.\n\n\nMaya didn't want Nicole to feel obligated to fulfill Maya's needs and wondered if it was too much to ask. Ridge said one had to ask to get. Maya stated that it was a Forrester mindset, but \"we\" were taught to be grateful and not greedy. Maya wanted the baby, but Nicole would be the one making the sacrifice. \"And the call,\" Rick added.\n\n\nNicole arrived and guessed she should have knocked. Rick said that if she still felt like a guest there, he'd failed her miserably. Nicole asked to speak to Maya, and Rick left them to talk alone.\n\n\nNervously, Nicole said she'd known Maya wanted Nicole to take time to think about things. Maya said it was no pressure for the enormous decisions. Nicole said it was the biggest she'd ever made. Maya assumed \"made\" meant there was an answer.\n\n\nNicole tearfully said she loved Maya and never wanted to disappoint her; however, Nicole had to think of her own life. Maya said she understood. Nicole said she and Zende had feelings for each other, and they wanted to see where it would go. Maya didn't want Nicole to sacrifice her happiness for Maya. Nicole wasn't sure if that would happen or not, and accepting that it could had led her to the only decision she could make.\n\n\nNicole admired her sister. Nicole said Maya and Rick would have a \"kick-ass\" life and be great parents -- except it was the one thing Maya couldn't do. Maya said Nicole was the best little sister, who deserved a glorious life of love, adventure, and fun. Maya didn't want to be the reason Nicole didn't have it. Maya insisted there was no pressure, and she understood if it was too much of a sacrifice.\n\n\nNicole thanked Maya for feeling that way. Nicole said that Maya had given Nicole the world. Maya was the reason for where Nicole lived and worked and whom she dated. Nicole called Maya her best friend and said the bigger sacrifice would be to miss out on the chance to give Maya someone no one else could. \"I'd be honored to be your surrogate,\" Nicole announced.\n\n\nMaya grew tearful and asked about Zende. Nicole stated that they'd work it out, but nothing was more important than helping Maya. Maya said she and Rick had talked to a specialist, and they could get someone else to carry Nicole's egg. Nicole said she knew Maya wanted Nicole to carry it. Maya said that it was only if that was okay with Nicole, and there was no pressure.\n\n\nNicole said the sisters had spent too much time apart, and she told Maya to imagine the connection the pregnancy would create. Nicole announced that she wanted to be the surrogate and to carry the baby. The sisters hugged.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Maya tells Rick that if he has any reservations he needs to say so now. All three of them need to be on the same page. At the end there will be no going back. But Nicole has not agreed to anything yet so they do not need to set themselves up for disappointment. Zende kisses Nicole and says he wants to be honest with her. She says she is not good at guessing so please speak his mind. He has an opinion and this will affect him as well. This will be a decision that can change all of their lives, it is a huge sacrifice. She says Maya has changed her life so she does not know how she can even say no. Zende reminds her that he is adopted so there are other options. But she has to do what she feels is right. They have a great future between them and he just hopes that she will make them the priority. Ridge tries to answer Steffy's accusations of why he sent Thomas to Paris. She is President yet he did not give her a heads-up and she is not buying this excuse from him. He is holding something back. What they are telling him makes no sense. Thomas's apology was not enough so he is now banished to another continent. Ridge tells her she is too protective of her brother. She reminds him that Thomas is more than staff, he is family. Ridge ends by saying the subject is closed; Thomas is staying in Paris. Caroline tells her to accept Ridge's decision. Ridge tells Caroline that Steffy can be relentless. Just then Thomas calls and he lets his dad know that he made it to Paris safely. He wants to apologize again but Ridge says he can not talk and hangs up. He tells Caroline this is their baby and their secret and no one, especially Thomas, can know. She assures him that she wants a baby with him and she will do all she can do to keep it that way. Nicole tells Maya that she needs to talk to her alone. She knows she is waiting on an answer and this is the biggest decision she has ever made. She does not want to let Maya down but Zende is part of this too. They feel the same about each other so this will be a ride together. Maya says she does not want her to sacrifice her life for them. Nicole says Maya inspires her and she knows they will be great parents and yet that is the one thing Maya can not do. Maya says there is no pressure intended, she just had to ask. Nicole says everything she has she owes to Maya. The bigger sacrifice would be missing out on this opportunity that no one else could give her so she would be honored to be her surrogate. Nothing is more important than doing this for her, even if it involves Zende. She wants to do this. Not just as an egg donor but to carry the baby. They hug.",
