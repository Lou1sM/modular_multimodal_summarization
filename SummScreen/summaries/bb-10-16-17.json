Brooke said she had a lot to work through. Rick hoped Ridge wasn't pushing. Brooke replied that Ridge wasn't, and she wanted to make sure she was of aware of what she was doing and how it would affect the family.\n\n\nBrooke wondered how it was affecting Katie and remarked that there was \"a lot there\" that Katie wasn't talking about. Rick and Maya remarked that Katie seemed fine at work. Brooke didn't want the end of her marriage to cause problems with her and her sister. She said there was a lot going on in the lives of the sisters, and she wanted them to be able to share everything.\n\n\nThe topic turned to Brooke's marriage breakup. Brooke said she hadn't stopped loving Bill; she just couldn't agree with some of his choices. In a pouty voice, Brooke stated that she couldn't forget that her involvement with Bill had broken up Katie's marriage. The trio wondered if Katie could be lonely, and Brooke said she'd feel guilty if Katie was.\n\n\nHaving seen a glow about Katie recently, Brooke said Katie might be seeing a man -- or Katie could be excited about her new campaign. If Katie was seeing someone, Brooke wouldn't feel so bad about how things had turned out. Brooke asked if they thought Katie was seeing someone.\n\n\nMaya asked if the sisters didn't talk about Katie's relationships. Brooke didn't know how many Katie had had after Bill. Rick said even that one had been back and forth. Rick and Maya hadn't heard Katie speak of anyone, and Rick added that Katie had her work. Brooke thought there was more to life than work. Maya stated that Katie had Will.\n\n\nBrooke acknowledged Katie's mothering skills and hoped her decision wouldn't affect Katie and Bill's relationship regarding Will. Rick didn't think Bill would let anything affect his relationship with his son, and Rick added that Katie wouldn't, either. Maya suggested that Brooke ask Katie if she was seeing someone. Maya couldn't imagine Katie wouldn't share it with Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke stated that she and Katie could talk about anything -- except their romantic relationships. Maya asked if it had to be that way if the sisters were well intentioned. Brooke remarked that she and Katie were used to managing their way around the topic of Bill. Rick felt that Katie had hit her stride since Monaco.\n\n\nAgreeing, Brooke wondered if she was just projecting and thinking the big decision in her life impacted everyone. Rick said it impacted everyone who cared about Brooke. Maya thought Brooke's care for her sister was endearing. Brooke thanked them for the talk and decided Katie would be just fine. Brooke was sure nothing would stop Katie from getting what she wanted.\n\n\nAt Eric's house, Eric learned from Mateo that Mateo had told Quinn that he'd seen Wyatt's car arrive at Katie's house hours earlier. Eric regretted not telling Quinn the moment he'd found out. Mateo asked what Eric was talking about. Eric explained that Quinn didn't know that Wyatt and Katie were in a relationship. Mateo assumed Wyatt had kept it a secret from Quinn.\n\n\nEric said that Katie and Wyatt hadn't had good track records with relationships, but they deserved to be as happy as Eric and Quinn. Mateo assumed that Quinn didn't agree. Eric replied that it could be anyone but Katie, and he regretted not telling Quinn when he'd found out.\n\n\nMateo said Eric hadn't wanted to upset Quinn, and Eric concluded that it would happen if Quinn saw Wyatt and Katie together. Eric figured he'd have to go over there if Quinn wasn't back soon.\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Quinn screamed in horror because her son was in the bed with Katie. Quinn ordered Wyatt out of the bed, but he said he really couldn't get out right then. The implication sickened Quinn, who snatched the underwear-clad Katie out of the bed and ordered her to keep her hands off Quinn's boy. Quinn vowed to tear Katie apart if she looked at Wyatt again.\n\n\nKatie gave Wyatt an anxious, imploring glare. Wyatt quickly slipped on some pants as Quinn berated Katie for luring him over there. He tossed a robe around Katie. Quinn shouted that she knew Wyatt had been lonely, but not desperate. \"Hey!\" Wyatt and Katie yelled back, and Katie ordered Quinn out of the house.\n\n\nQuinn accused Katie of taking advantage of Wyatt. Quinn had imagined him being alone, not with \"this!\" Katie asked Wyatt to get Quinn out of there. Wyatt told Quinn she was out of her mind for attacking Katie, and he noted that Eric hadn't reacted that way. Quinn asked if Eric already knew about it. Wyatt and Katie didn't answer. They just insisted that Quinn leave.\n\n\nQuinn declared the relationship over, but Wyatt said Quinn didn't call the shots. He said he would be where he wanted to be. Quinn shouted that she'd only tell Katie one more time to \"stay the hell away\" from Quinn's son.\n\n\nLater, Quinn had gone, and Katie was ranting about people just showing up in her house. She was upset about how crazy Quinn had acted and said that Quinn had attacked her. In Katie's view, Quinn had acted like an animal. Katie said she and Wyatt were adults. Wyatt replied that he would make it very clear to Quinn.\n\n\nKatie rubbed her wrist, smarting from Quinn dragging her out of bed. Wyatt said he should have jumped up and dragged Quinn out of there. Katie believed Quinn would have gone more crazy.\n\n\nWyatt apologized for not protecting Katie, but she said he hadn't known Quinn would attack. Wyatt thought it shouldn't have to be the way it was. He said he should have told Quinn. He hadn't wanted to hide his feelings for Katie, but he hadn't wanted anything to get in the way, either. Wyatt stated that Quinn had a way of complicating things for him.\n\n\nKatie thought it was an overstatement and worried that it was the old Quinn surfacing. Katie said Quinn had totally lost control, and Wyatt hugged Katie.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Mateo was working on the switch at the top of the stairs when Quinn charged into the house and asked Eric how he could keep the Wyatt and Katie relationship from Quinn. Eric said he'd been trying to give Wyatt the chance to tell Quinn himself. Quinn said they weren't supposed to keep secrets, and Wyatt was her child, her son. Apologizing, Eric said he thought it would be better if Wyatt had revealed it.\n\n\nEric claimed he'd been just as shocked about it, but Quinn doubted it. Eric asked if they'd all had a chance to talk. Quinn replied that they hadn't because Quinn had walked in on the two in bed together, and Katie had been all over Wyatt. \"And he couldn't get out of bed because he was -- oh, God, it made me sick!\" Quinn exclaimed.\n\n\nAs Mateo sent off a text message, which said the Forresters were having a big argument, Eric tried to get Quinn to calm down. She said she'd been talking about finding Wyatt a date earlier, and Eric had said nothing to her. Eric believed that he should have, but he said Quinn was overreacting about Wyatt and Katie, who were grown adults. Quinn asked how she was supposed to act after finding her son with Katie and discovering that Eric had been lying to her.\n\n\nEric reminded Quinn that Katie had saved her life, but Quinn wouldn't take that as a reason to accept the depravity. Eric thought Katie was a terrific person, and Quinn should be happy. Quinn stated that Katie had tried to destroy their marriage, and when it hadn't worked, she'd moved on to Quinn's son. Eric said it hadn't happened that way.\n\n\nQuinn quipped that Eric should explain how it had happened because he'd known about it for so long. He replied that it hadn't been that long. Quinn volleyed between blaming Eric for keeping a secret and her outrage toward Katie, whom Quinn believed was just trying to get back at Quinn. Eric said Katie appreciated Wyatt, and Quinn retorted that Katie should be with someone her own age. Eric replied that people said the same about him and Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn disagreed and said she wasn't in her marriage for revenge or perverted thrills. Quinn began raging about Katie possibly getting pregnant with Quinn's grandchild. Eric said it was getting ridiculous, and Quinn accused him of taking Katie's side. Eric said he was trying to be reasonable. He believed he should have told her about it, but he said not doing so didn't mean she could go totally out of control.\n\n\nQuinn yelled that Wyatt was her son. Eric yelled back that Wyatt had chosen to be with Katie. Eric decided to leave the house before they said regretful things.\n\n\nAs Quinn stood alone by the fireplace, Mateo approached, touched her shoulder, and said he'd heard. Quinn was upset that Eric had walked out and asked what would happen if Eric didn't return. Quinn didn't want to be alone again. Mateo said she wasn't alone, and she had him. He hugged her.\n\n\n",
