Ridge has hired a lawyer for Taylor but feels that she will not stay out of prison without the help of Thorne. Ridge rushes to Taylor to tell her to keep quiet, but he is too late. Taylor learns that Phoebe and Hector could be charged with obstruction of justice for keeping her secret. LT. Baker convinces Taylor to explain their part in her crime and she admits that Stephanie knew about the accident as well. Phoebe explains the accident to Thorne, but he refuses to listen.

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge and Stephanie are trying to keep the media at bay. He berates his mother for as horrific as this is that Taylor hit Darla, how could Taylor have convinced his mother to keep quiet about it? He tells her once again her meddling has made things worse. She thinks he's a little late and doesn't appreciate the criticism. He informs her that he's called Storm Logan, the best there is, and he's going to represent Taylor, but it's going to be darn impossible without Thorne's cooperation. Taylor calls a scared Phoebe and tells her what has happened. Lt. Baker also tells Taylor that as sad as it is, he is afraid both Hector and Phoebe may be charged with obstruction of justice. And then there is Stephanie who knows more than she lets on. Phoebe tries to explain to an unreceptive Thorne how it WAS an accident. No matter that Taylor had been drinking, Darla did fall back into her path, Taylor did not swerve. Thorne rails that there was no excuse for keeping this secret. His daughter is now suffering and will more because Phoebe nor her mother will ever step foot in his house again. Ridge tells his mother he's going to see Taylor and tell her to shut up, stop digging herself a grave any further. He steps in and tells Baker that this interrogation is over. She bemoans that she hates herself and why did she drag Phoebe into this? Her kids are going to lose her all over again. He says no, they just need to get to his brother and convince him that justice and closure are not the same thing. Phoebe tells Thorne that Taylor put his needs above her own; he needed someone to talk to. She cries that if he can't forgive her, at least someday forgive her mother. Taylor is led to and locked into her cell. Thorne goes to the Darla shrine/table and picks up the photo of Taylor and carefully handles it before squashing it in his hands with tears in his eyes.",
