Quinn worried that she'd had a blowup with Eric and that Eric had known about Wyatt being in a relationship with Katie Logan. Mateo maintained that he couldn't believe Eric or any man would be mad at Quinn for long.\n\n\nQuinn added that she had aggravated her back sprain. Quinn lamented that she couldn't unsee her son in Katie's bed. Mateo offered a massage, and Quinn agreed. While Mateo massaged her body, Quinn shared that she didn't like or trust Katie. Quinn was angry that Eric had known about Katie and Wyatt but hadn't told her. Mateo was understanding of Quinn's anger, but he agreed that Eric had wanted Wyatt to tell his mother about his own relationship.\n\n\nMateo encouraged Quinn to concentrate on breathing and releasing tension. Quinn wondered if Mateo felt she had overreacted. Mateo understood that Quinn wanted to protect her son. \"I'm here for you, whatever you need,\" Mateo said. Mateo continued to massage Quinn. Mateo wanted her to relax, but Quinn had a hard time clearing her mind and focusing on her breath. After Mateo had helped Quinn, Mateo asked how she felt. Quinn said Mateo's hands were \"a natural treasure.\"\n\n\nAt Katie's, Eric and Katie discussed what had happened when Quinn had invaded Katie's home and attacked her. Eric noticed Katie had a bruised arm. Katie angrily told Eric that his wife had barged into her home, uninvited, and \"went berserk.\" Katie told Eric that he had clearly married a crazy person.\n\n\nKatie shared that Quinn had threatened her and yanked her out of her own bed. Katie added that she knew Eric wanted to defend and believe in Quinn, but he had forgiven her for many evil things, and she was still violent. Katie reminded Eric that Quinn had attacked Sheila and given her a concussion. \"Is this the woman you really want to spend the rest of your life with?\" Katie asked.\n\n\nEric admitted that Quinn's behavior had upset him. \"There is zero justification,\" Katie said. Katie asked what would happen when Quinn did something that Eric couldn't fix. Katie said there had to be \"someone else out there\" for Eric.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Charlie and Pam looked at menus for lunch, and Pam noticed that Sheila was working as a waitress. Sheila stopped at the table, and Pam and Charlie noted that Sheila worked at the restaurant closest to Forrester. Sheila said it was a \"happy coincidence.\" She added that she was \"trying really hard to jumpstart a new life.\" Both Pam and Charlie looked skeptical.\n\n\nCharlie received a text message that he had to return to Forrester, and Pam promised to get him takeout. Charlie left, and Sheila sat down with Pam. Sheila noted that Pam had doubts about Sheila, but Sheila said all of her problems were in the past. She had been rehabilitated. She added that Eric recognized she had changed. Pam agreed.\n\n\nSheila said she loved Los Angeles, and it was her home. She loved the Forresters, as well. She reminded Pam that not all of her history was bad. Sheila said that everyone who'd known Stephanie had loved and feared her. Pam said she missed her sister.\n\n\nSheila said that no one could believe that Stephanie would approve of Quinn. Pam agreed, but she added that Sheila would not be approved either. Sheila maintained that she wanted to protect Eric just like Pam did.\n\n\nPam and Sheila bonded, and Sheila said she enjoyed girl time with Pam. Sheila offered to get together with Pam again. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" Sheila said.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Eric returned from Katie's house, and he was angry. He barged in on Quinn's massage. \"What's going on with you? What's wrong with you?\" Eric shouted. Eric dismissed Mateo, but Mateo listened outside the door. \"I can't keep defending you. I'm so disappointed in you,\" Eric shouted.\n\n\nAfter Sheila left Pam at the restaurant, Sheila received a call from Mateo. He reported that Quinn had caught her son in bed with Katie, and Quinn had dragged Katie out of bed in a fit of anger. Sheila laughed at the thought of it. Mateo said Quinn had angered Eric with her violent tendencies.\n\n\nSheila thanked Mateo, and he said it hardly felt like work. He added that Eric was angrier than Mateo had ever seen him. Sheila asked him to keep her posted. She hung up and smiled. She flashed back to happier times with Eric kissing her. She recalled her wedding with Eric. \"We will be together again, Eric,\" she said.\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric is almost in disbelief when Katie shows him her arm where Quinn attacked her after coming into her home uninvited. Quinn tells Mateo she is okay, just a little physical pain but more emotional as she has to get Katie away from her son. Pam and Charlie have lunch at Il Guardino and she is surprised to see Sheila there as their server. So convenient, Pam says, right next door almost to Forrester. Charlie gets a call that he must go and Sheila says she can send takeout for him and keep Pam company in the meantime. When she sits down Sheila says she knows Pam has reservations about her, things that she did in the past but she is the best she has ever been. She can even ask Eric. They both have that in common. They both want what is best for Eric. Katie tells Eric his wife is clearly as unhinged as she has ever been. He has married a crazy person. She and Wyatt were upstairs spending some private time and Quinn came bounding in when she clearly was not invited and proceeded to scold them and ordered her out of her own bed. Eric has done everything for Quinn and she promised she had changed but she has not. There has to be someone else out for him. Sheila tells Pam that she loves Eric and she considers this her home now. She cannot believe Stephanie would approve of Quinn. Quinn has put a blight on Stephanie's memory. Quinn gets another treatment from Mateo and starts talking about the cougar after her son. He works his magic with his fingers and tells her to just relax and think as she slowly breathes in and out. Mateo tells her that he is there for her no matter what she needs. Pam accuses Sheila of wanting Eric for herself. She says no, she just wants his happiness. Pam says he practically divorced his family when they tried to shy him away from Quinn so she does not think he will listen now. Sheila says she has enjoyed this conversation so much and if Pam ever wants to talk she knows where to find her. Quinn tells Mateo this feels so good; he sure knows his stuff. She says maybe she did over-react when she found Katie and Wyatt. She and Eric rarely disagree much less fight. He says it is because she is such a passionate person; so is he. He says massage is such a dialogue. Eric bursts in and he berates her for attacking Katie. He asks Mateo to leave them alone. He listens on the other side of the door. Eric says he is so disappointed in her and he cannot keep defending her. Mateo wastes no time in calling Sheila and telling her about Katie and Wyatt and Quinn finding them. And then Eric rushed home and laid into Quinn right then and there. Sheila is happy for the information and wants to be kept posted. Mateo is to keep doing his thing. She tells herself she and Eric will be together; together at last.",
