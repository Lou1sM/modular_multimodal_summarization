    "tvmega_recap": "Pam tells Eric that their prayers were answered and it is good to have him back. Ridge says RJ is there and they all love Eric and he also is glad he is back. Quinn tells Wyatt that Eric is better but the family is still treating her like a piranha. She just wishes they could see how much they love each other. Steffy and Liam hug and he asks if he can't convince her that last night was the last night they will be apart. She says in deference to Wyatt she thinks they have to do this. She just wishes all would see how dangerous Quinn is \u0096 dangerous enough that she ended her marriage because of her. She stayed in it as long as she could. She does feel guilty though for giving up. Liam says she had to do this to be safe. And Wyatt knows what Quinn is capable of yet it is his choice to support her and not Steffy. Quinn tells Wyatt that she cannot believe she has control over everything. Wyatt warns her not to lord that over everyone. Brooke tells Eric that it is good to see his eyes open again and it will soon be like old times. Ridge agrees; he is the glue that holds this family together. RJ tells his granddad he has moved back to L.A. so hurry up and get better so they can go surfing. Pam says they prayed everyday and Brooke says they are so grateful that he fought to come back to them. They leave his bedside while the nurse comes in. But Eric tells Ridge to stay. Ridge sits on his bed and says he does not know what Quinn told him but he did what he did to protect him and he hopes Eric knows that. Wyatt tells Quinn that Steffy left him so excuse him for not exactly listening to her little \"family does not like me\" problems now. So what is good for her now with Eric sucks for him now. She says it breaks her heart that Steffy won't accept their marriage but Wyatt does not have to let her walk away. Steffy tells Liam that she just wishes the circumstances were different, so do not leave anything for her in the fridge as she does not know how long this divorce will take but she wants to do this the proper way and not spend the night here until it is over. He says he knows she has a history with Wyatt but all things within reason. They have waited so long that all he wants to do is but he gives in and says this will give them something else to look forward to. Ridge laments to Eric that he just naturally thought Eric would name him POA and he panicked when he realized he didn't and it was Quinn. He says he is just glad that Eric is back and putting words together so they can talk about this another time. Quinn says she is being optimistic here. Steffy has not tried to get to know her, her actions are pure. Life is precious and that is what she is doing. She is never going to let anything or anyone come between her and her husband again. As Ridge tries to speak he tells Eric that this is not probably the best time but Eric seems to want to talk. He has drawn up new papers naming him as POA; this is all to protect him and the family's legacy. No matter how Eric feels about Quinn, she cannot handle that. It has to be Ridge.",
