    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Katie's house, Wyatt and Katie kissed and discussed what had happened with Quinn. Wyatt was sorry Quinn had bruised Katie's arm. Wyatt was more worried about how his father would react. Katie thought Bill had enough on his hands with Brooke leaving him. Wyatt felt that the couple would reunite, but Katie revealed that Brooke was filing for divorce.\n\n\nWyatt hated seeing his father \"this way.\"  Katie said that Brooke had thought she'd known Bill and had understood what she'd been getting into. \"Apparently, she didn't,\" Katie added with satisfaction. Wyatt stated, \"For better or for worse.\" Katie repeated the phrase but reasoned that Bill could have killed someone. Wyatt replied that Bill had covered his bases.\n\n\nKatie wondered if Wyatt was defending Bill. Stammering, Wyatt said it sounded like it, but he wasn't. Sighing, Wyatt acknowledged that he had dysfunctional parents and a dysfunctional brother. He asked how he'd wound up normal. They laughed at the thought of Wyatt being normal, and they kissed.\n\n\nKatie considered that Bill might have learned his lesson after suffering repercussions from the fire. Wyatt replied that Bill never learned lessons; Bill got even, and a ton of repercussions would be headed Liam's way. Katie asked if Bill had threatened Liam. Affirming it, Wyatt said Bill would probably start acting on the threats.\n\n\nKatie felt that someone needed to stop Bill. Wyatt replied that he'd tried, and he wasn't doing it again. He figured Steffy was still trying, but a betrayed Bill would get his payday. She asked if Liam was as concerned as Wyatt was. Wyatt quipped that Liam would be an idiot not to be.\n\n\nKatie noted that there was a lot of chaos around them. Wyatt asked if they were good. She replied that they were better than good, and they kissed.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam and Justin debated Liam's decision to stop buying materials in a country where the workers were underpaid. Justin said a lot of families depended on the jobs. Liam said it wasn't an excuse for \"those conditions.\" Liam insisted that Justin deliver Liam's message.\n\n\n\"Yeah, all right, all right,\" Justin said in a blas\u00e9 tone. Liam noted that Justin was typically contrary to Liam, and Justin's opinions were sounding a lot like Bill's. \"Oh, they are?\" Justin asked in the same monotone. Liam revealed that his father had been there the other day and had a plan to hurt Liam. Justin asked if Liam wanted Justin to call security.\n\n\nLiam said he needed to know he could trust Justin, who was the only link Bill had to get into Spencer. Justin claimed to be loyal to the company and his paycheck. Liam said Justin had to convince Liam of it, or Justin had to go. Liam was worried about his father seeking revenge on him for the failed marriage with Brooke. Liam had to know Justin would speak up if he learned of anything Bill could be up to. Justin asked if Liam thought Justin wouldn't speak up.\n\n\nClaiming that he was taking Justin at his word, Liam said that if he got a hint that Justin was still working with Bill, Justin would be out of the company immediately. Justin asked why Liam was being skeptical of Justin. Liam noted that Justin took business calls on his private phone, Justin constantly questioned Liam's actions, and Bill hadn't reacted to Justin's shift in loyalties.\n\n\nJustin advised that paranoia was a dangerous trait, and it caused people to make rash judgments. Liam preferred being rash to being wrong. Justin emphasized that he wasn't Liam's enemy. Liam said it was wise because Bill wouldn't be the only one to go down for the fire. \"I wasn't involved, so...\" Justin replied with a smirk.\n\n\nContending that Bill had indicated otherwise in the recorded statement, Liam said that if Bill attacked Liam at all, Liam would go to the authorities. Liam asked if Justin got him. Huffing, Justin stood. He said he didn't know if it was being in that office or what; however, Liam was becoming more like Bill every day. Justin quietly exited.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Steffy said that if Bill was serious about how he felt, she'd help him heal things with Liam. Bill wanted it, but he didn't know if Liam did. \"Just no more threats against your son,\" she said. They hugged, and over her shoulder, Bill rendered a telling expression.\n\n\nSteffy suggested that Bill see Liam again, but Bill said she'd already seen that his visits weren't productive. She told him to write a letter, but Bill replied that he wasn't the letter-writing type. Steffy agreed to speak to Liam again on Bill's behalf. Bill replied that time was running out, and \"if you don't get through to him -- \"\n\n\nSteffy cut in, asking what Bill would do if she didn't. She didn't like Liam's blackmail or Bill's threats. Bill said there was a simple answer: Steffy needed to get Liam to delete the recording.\n\n\nOutside, Justin walked onto the balcony. Before he could enter the house through one of the open French doors, he saw Bill and Steffy inside. Justin moved out of sight and listened in.\n\n\nBack inside, Steffy told Bill that she'd get Liam to cooperate. Bill appreciated Steffy's resolve, but in his view, not every problem could be solved. Bill wasn't beyond forcing his way back into Spencer, and if he did, there wouldn't be a place for Liam in Spencer or in Bill's life. Steffy urged Bill to focus on what he'd said about loving Liam. Bill loved his son but said it couldn't all be on Bill.\n\n\nBill needed Liam to meet him halfway. Steffy believed she could reason with her husband, but she said Bill needed to show some leadership in the meantime by rising above it. She asked him to do it for the family -- and for her. Bill was willing to try one more peaceable attempt, but time was running out.\n\n\nSteffy promised to do the best she could, and Bill said he didn't know how he'd get through it without her. Steffy grabbed her purse and left out the front door.\n\n\nJustin readily slipped into the living room via the slightly open French door and startled Bill. Justin said he'd arrived through the back just in case Liam had eyes on the place, and he hadn't been able to help overhearing. \"You want to make amends with Liam after all the things he's done to you?\" Justin asked.\n\n\nLater, Bill and Justin watched a computer hacker named Ken click away on a laptop. Ken was searching for a backdoor that could be hidden in all of \"his\" devices. Ken was on a brute force attack and was conducting an automated search for passwords. \"You marry it to a clone fish, and it gets interesting,\" Ken explained.\n\n\nKen decided to go to the \"workroom,\" and he talked about having his tea. Bill asked if Ken wanted lemon, and Ken said it would be nice. Bill roared that it would be nice if Ken found the file. Bill said he was paying Ken the gross national product of a small country, and he ordered Ken to get it done.\n\n\nKen left, and Bill ranted about him to Justin. Justin said \"Kenny\" was highly recommended. Bill asked by whom, but Justin said not to worry. Bill complained about Ken's room full of gizmos. It looked like NASA to Bill. Justin said it was a hacker's paradise. Bill asked if Ken had any idea.\n\n\n\"What? That the file that he could find could put you in prison?\" Justin asked. Bill replied, \"Us, Justin. Us.\" Justin said Ken didn't have any idea about what the file meant and added that people like Ken only asked one question, which was, \"How much?\" Bill was anxious for Ken to locate the file of the recording and delete it. It was the only way Bill could neutralize his son.\n\n\nJustin said it couldn't happen soon enough because Liam was getting squirrely, questioning Justin's loyalty, and threatening to fire Justin. Bill took satisfaction in Liam's paranoia. Bill felt Liam should feel that way because Bill would cut Liam off at the knees.\n\n\nJustin wondered again about Bill's talk with Steffy and repeated his earlier question about Bill wanting a peaceful resolution despite what Liam had done to Bill. Bill said Liam couldn't care less about what Bill wanted. Bill wished the whole thing had never happened. Bill asserted that Liam had cost Bill his company and his marriage. Bill wouldn't give up on Brooke, and he would have Spencer back, whatever it took.\n\n\nTime dragged on, and Bill grew impatient about destroying the file. Justin told Bill to calm down because they needed to be careful not to let Liam, who had an IT background, figure out what they were up to. Bill yelled that he wanted the file deleted from Liam's phone, computer, and cloud. \"I don't even care if he has it stuck up his -- wherever the hell it is, it needs to be eliminated forever!\" Bill bellowed.\n\n\nBill didn't know what would happen between him and Liam after it was done; however, Bill wanted his company back, and he ordered Justin to find the recording.\n\n\nBack at Spencer, Alex, the head of security, questioned Liam's instruction to ban Bill from the building. Liam said he had to take threats from Bill seriously, and it was Alex's job to do so, too. Alex agreed to it. \"Thank you. I know I can count on you. Now go,\" Liam dismissed and wiped his hand over his face as Alex left.\n\n\nSteffy entered, and Liam said she was the one person he'd needed to see more than anyone. He kissed her cheek. Steffy uttered that she'd talked to Bill, who wanted a reconciliation. Chuckling, Liam asked if it would be before or after Liam handed over the keys to the kingdom.\n\n\nSteffy believed that Bill meant it. Liam asked why she'd gone to Bill. Steffy wanted the war to end and would do something about it if Liam wouldn't. She insisted that Bill wasn't plotting and wanted peace, just like she did. Liam said Bill had stood in that office, vowing revenge.\n\n\nSteffy defended Bill, who loved Liam. Liam said he loved Bill; he just didn't like Bill anymore. She pointed out that Liam had done questionable things, too, and asked if Liam really wanted to be at odds with Bill. Watching it was torture for Steffy. She asked Liam to do it for her before things got really serious.\n\n\nLiam asked if Steffy didn't think it was already serious. Pointing to himself, Liam said his father should be in prison, but Liam had stopped it. Liam claimed to have given Bill an out, but Steffy quipped that he'd forced Bill out. Liam thought it was better than prison time.\n\n\nSteffy acknowledged that Liam had a powerful point. She said he'd made it, and it was time to make peace. Scoffing, Liam said he wouldn't know where to start. She suggested he start by deleting the audio file. Refusing, Liam said it was his only bargaining chip, and without it, there was no proof of Bill's wrongdoing. Steffy replied that it would be a show of faith.\n\n\nLiam told Steffy that it would be an invitation to let Bill resume the bully pulpit, and Liam would regret it for the rest of his life. Steffy said Bill felt horrible. Liam responded that Bill didn't know how to feel horrible, and Bill only knew how to attack. Liam could sense Bill doing it and said peace wasn't possible at that moment.\n\n\nAsking when peace would be possible, Steffy asserted that Bill was in pain from losing Liam, the company, and Brooke. Steffy begged Liam to delete the recording and end the feud. Liam couldn't do it. He said it was the only protection he had against a man who'd vowed to take him down.\n\n\n",
    "yt": "\n\nSteffy approached Bill with the sole intention of making peace between him and his estranged son, Liam.  Bill gives into Steffy\u2019s prodding by admitting that he is partially responsible for his argument with Liam.  Ridge makes an appearance at Spencer Publications in hopes of finding out from the source how and why Liam ousted Bill from the company.  Liam turns the tables on Ridge by asking about a possible reunion between him and Brooke now that she left Bill.  Even though the topic is an uncomfortable one for the sisters, Brooke tells Katie more about her and Bill\u2019s relationship.   When Bill tells Steffy that he wants to reconcile with his son, she agrees to make it happen.",

    "tvmega_recap": "At work Katie agonizes over what she just went through with Quinn. Brooke is concerned and asks if she can help .or at least talk about it. Katie says she is fine and doesn't want to talk about it. She asks if Brooke has made a decision about Bill yet. Brooke says yes; she ended her marriage. She had to. She had no other choice. Katie says she is sorry but she always thought that she and Ridge would get back together. Now maybe they will. Brooke confides that would be so easy to go back to Ridge but she needs time to process all of this. She still loves Bill but he crossed the line and this was not the first incident. She admits she always knew that Bill was a controversial figure, he pushes the boundaries but she always thought she was the woman who could understand and stand by him. But she can't; that is not who she is. She wonders if Bill will ever meet his match. Ridge drops in at Spencer's and tells Liam that Bill is a lot of things but not a quitter so tell him the real story. Liam says sorry he will have to get that from Bill himself. But he does appreciate Ridge stopping by as he could use all the support he can get. Ridge says he will do fine; he has always wanted him to do well his favorite son-in- law Liam points out the only son-in-law. He also tells Ridge that he heard that Brooke ended it with Bill so can they congratulate Ridge instead. Ridge says he wishes he were so lucky. He's just giving her space right now. He doesn't want to pressure her into anything. She's been through a lot and she has to heal now and he doesn't want to talk about it. And besides Liam would probably be pulling for his dad, not Ridge. Then he mentions Bill punched him. He'd like to know more about that. Liam declines but says all he can say is that Bill brought it on himself. Ridge says he would like to know why as he lost his temper, his company and now his wife. Bill and Steffy talk but they never get beyond the same old, same old. Steffy wants to get him and Liam back together the way they used to be. Bill reminds her that he is willing to meet Liam half way and all he needs to do is call off the blackmail and give him his company back but Liam will not hear of that. He continues to squeeze him and that is not how a family behaves. He is cozying himself up to all his employees and enjoying himself in his daddy's chair. Steffy says he probably would do the same thing. Bill says no, not with his boys. He has tried to build them both up from the day they came to town and has given them everything to build them up but Liam just wants to tear him down and make him suffer so now they will see just who suffers. Steffy says she is not going to let that happen; him taking revenge on his own son. She will do everything in her power to see that the Spencer's do not destroy each other. Bill tells her that the first time he laid eyes on her he knew she was something special. A lot of water has crossed under that bridge and he has always been a champion for her and Liam's relationship. Liam should be so lucky to have her and treat her with more respect. Instead what does he do; he goes running off with Sally Spectra meanwhile degrading his own family. Steffy tells him to stop. She admits running off with Sally did not help. He says he is hurt now with Brooke even though he has tried to take responsibility but Liam has to accept responsibility too. He wants his son back but he's not sure they can get there. It may be too far apart and too far gone. She puts her hand on his knee and says no it is not. She's not going to let him give up. He says again that he wants Liam as a son again but he does not know how to make that happen but she is right he will have to try. She says she meant it when she said she would help. She is there for the family but she is also there for Bill. He says good but the time is ticking. He is going to get his company back one way or the other. He will not live with blackmail the rest of his life. Katie tells Brooke that she will always be there for her. Happiness can find her even if it takes her a week or even a year, but she will be happy again and it might be with Ridge. Liam tells Ridge that he really likes this job and he is trying in his own little way to steer the company into a more responsible, compassionate direction. And as long as he has Steffy by his side, that is all that matters. Bill can vow all the revenge he wants but he has the upper hand now and Bill knows that.",
