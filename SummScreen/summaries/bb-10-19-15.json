Steffy claimed that Ivy had said she'd do anything. Caroline replied that Steffy was putting it to the test. Steffy said it wasn't as if she was making Ivy undress for the camera, but Caroline jokingly said it was exactly what Steffy was asking. Chuckling, Steffy was sure Ivy would be fine.\n\n\nNearby, Ivy was a bundle of nerves, but Wyatt kept assuring her that she was smoking hot and would do fine. Steffy approached to initiate the shoot, and Ivy asked why Caroline was present. Steffy said it was to see how the initial designs photographed. \"You mean she wants to see how I photograph,\" Ivy replied. Wyatt said that everyone was pulling for Ivy -- including Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy said it was magic time. Music played, and Ivy stripped off her purple robe and revealed a purple bra and panty set. Steffy and Caroline grimaced at Ivy's stiff, embarrassed poses. Steffy said to loosen up because photographers like Sean weren't cheap. Liam arrived and grimaced at the scene.\n\n\nSteffy instructed Ivy to imagine modeling for Wyatt in private. Liam studied the looks on Ivy's face, and after a few more moments, he declared that it was enough. He decided the shoot was over.\n\n\nSteffy asked him what he thought he was doing. Liam asked the photography staff to leave and told Steffy that he wouldn't let it go on any longer. \"The photo shoot?\" she asked. Liam clarified that he was stopping the photo shoot, Ivy modeling the bedroom line, and the rivalry between the cousins.\n\n\nSteffy didn't understand why Liam was acting as he was. Liam said Steffy couldn't make the uncomfortable Ivy parade around in her underwear. He said Steffy knew it wasn't Ivy's thing, which was why Steffy hadn't been able to resist. \"Whoa...why are you calling me out?\" Steffy asked.\n\n\nLiam said he wasn't calling Steffy out. Instead, he was trying to get her to see where it all stemmed from. He stated that Ivy had been wrong and hurtful to use the video, but what Steffy was doing was also wrong and hurtful. He didn't think the actions were like either of them, and he believed the women were better than all the feuding. He asked them to remember the Forrester women before them, and he challenged them to be the royalty they were meant to be for both of their sakes.\n\n\nLiam asked if the women wanted to remain bitter and vengeful. Ivy said she didn't. Steffy didn't answer, and Liam told Steffy that she knew it wasn't her. Ivy said she'd apologized for everything, and she wasn't just going through the motions -- if that was what Steffy thought. Steffy asked if Ivy really wasn't going through the motions and saying all the right things to get her job back.\n\n\nSteffy said she and Ivy each felt as if they'd failed Aly. Liam stated that everyone felt that way. Steffy grumbled that they all hadn't blackmailed. Exasperated, Ivy said she'd apologized. Steffy responded that Ivy had gone over Steffy's head to pressure Eric to rehire her. Steffy asked how she was supposed to let it go. Ivy figured Steffy was admitting that the lingerie shoot was revenge.\n\n\nSteffy stated that it was, and it wasn't; however, it was a good opportunity that most women would jump at. Ivy replied that Steffy knew Ivy wasn't one of those women. Liam decided that they were making progress and talking about the real issues. He asked the women to imagine how much they could accomplish at work, in the family, and in their personal lives if they put their differences aside.\n\n\nLiam saw it as a chance for the women to rise to the occasion and turn from hurtful choices. He said they were exceptional women and cousins. He asked them to be such and more.\n\n\nLater, Liam and Caroline had left, and Steffy asked if Wyatt planned to read her and Ivy the riot act, too. Wyatt replied that he wasn't angling for sainthood, but Liam was right about the women making peace. Wyatt apologized to Ivy for pushing her. She said he'd just been trying to help her. He kissed her and left her and Steffy alone to talk.\n\n\nOnce Wyatt was gone, Steffy asked if she and Ivy were really making peace or just pretending as a way to make the men happy. Ivy apologized for ruining the photo shoot. Steffy said Ivy shouldn't be sorry. \"I went too far,\" Steffy admitted. Ivy replied that she'd also gone too far with the video. Steffy and Ivy agreed to never mention the video again.\n\n\nSteffy was amazed by Liam's strong stance. Ivy said it had been about helping Steffy. Steffy asked if he ever got tired of being right. Ivy said it was sickening, and the women laughed.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge fitted Christine, a model, who was saying that the models missed Thomas. Katie arrived as Christine exited and asked what Christine had meant. Ridge explained that the models were missing Thomas while he was in Paris. Katie wasn't surprised because Thomas was just as handsome and charming as his father. Ridge quipped that Thomas was nothing like him.\n\n\nKatie said that Forrester men were all alike and could have any woman they wanted. Ridge replied that some lines shouldn't be crossed. She asked what Thomas was doing in Paris. Ridge stated that Thomas was designing, observing, and contemplating things he'd done in his life -- hopefully.\n\n\nKatie asked if Ridge was angry at Thomas. Ridge shrugged it off, and Katie said Ridge and Thomas had issues with the past. She said parents weren't perfect, but with Caroline, Ridge had a chance to have other children and make a whole new set of mistakes or better choices. Katie concluded that he got to start over with Caroline without baggage.\n\n\nRidge questioned whether there could really be a fresh start and if that was what Katie believed she and Bill had. Katie asked if Ridge was wondering if the past ever reared its head, but then she told him that he didn't have to worry about that with Caroline, because nothing would get between the couple. Ridge replied that he wouldn't let it.\n\n\n\"So boy or girl?\" Katie asked. Ridge squirmed with the question. She was sure a boy would be handsome and have a way with the ladies. She guessed that she was getting ahead of herself because Caroline wasn't even pregnant. \"Right?\" Katie asked.\n\n\nRidge stated that he'd promised to give his wife a baby. Katie responded that Ridge Forrester always kept his promises. Ridge corrected that he always \"tried\" to keep them. She said that a baby would strengthen the bond between two people, and she wondered how Thomas felt about it. She guessed Thomas was in Paris because he couldn't handle all that Ridge's new marriage entailed.\n\n\nRidge reverted back to the question about the sex of the baby. He said it didn't matter, as long as it was healthy. He stated that soon, he and Caroline would announce that they were expecting.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Pam and Charlie were curious about Thomas' sudden Paris trip. She couldn't get answers from Ridge, so she decided to send Thomas a text message.\n\n\nLater, in the design room, Pam and Charlie hailed Liam as the great negotiator. Liam was bashful about it, but Caroline agreed. As she tried to explain what he'd done with Steffy and Ivy, Caroline got nauseous and rushed out of the room. Liam wondered what that was about.\n\n\nPam's thoughts silently turned as Charlie explained that Caroline had been running for the bathroom a lot. The men asked Pam if a stomach bug was going around. Pam said to hold the thought, and she dragged Charlie out of the room.\n\n\nAfter a while, Pam and Charlie returned with a bag. Liam asked where they'd been. Charlie stated that Pam suspected that Caroline was pregnant. Pam added that all of the bouts of nausea called for a home pregnancy test. Pam held up the bag, but Liam pushed it down, saying it wasn't their business. Pam exclaimed how great it would be.\n\n\nCaroline entered and asked how great what would be. She then noted how they were looking at her. Pam stated that Liam wanted to ask Caroline something. Liam asked how she was feeling. Caroline claimed to have eaten something funky for breakfast. Charlie wondered if that could be all it was and noted that Caroline looked pale. Caroline insisted she was fine and just needed to fix her makeup.\n\n\nLiam offered to get her water, but Pam said lemon balm tea was good for \"women who are -- \" Liam interrupted, stating, \"queasy.\" Caroline said she wasn't queasy. Charlie remarked that he and Pam had gone to the drug store. Caroline fiddled with her makeup, and Charlie asked if she wanted to know why they'd gone. Guessing it was for medication, Caroline thanked them but said she didn't need it.\n\n\nLiam said that it wasn't medicine. Pam beamed and said, \"It's a home pregnancy test!\" Caroline was startled to see the pregnancy test Pam held up. Pam said the possible food poisoning might be morning sickness, and Charlie asked the \"little potential mama-to-be\" if she really wanted to know. Caroline said it was crazy, but Charlie replied that the tests were accurate.\n\n\nLiam asked if there was a reason Caroline wouldn't want to know. Pam asked if Caroline was still on birth control. Caroline's eyebrows hiked up. Liam readily explained that none of it had been his idea, but he asked if it wouldn't be fun to end the suspense and find out with them if she was carrying Ridge's baby. Caroline stated that there was no suspense, and she didn't need to take the test.\n\n\nPam asked why. \"Because I don't, Pam!\" Caroline shrieked. She apologized for yelling and said it was a giant waste of time. Liam decided it was because Caroline knew already, and he asked if she was pregnant.\n\n\nJust then, Ridge entered and asked what was going on. Liam said he believed they'd figured out the secret, and Caroline was pregnant. Ridge stared at the mortified Caroline.\n\n\n",
