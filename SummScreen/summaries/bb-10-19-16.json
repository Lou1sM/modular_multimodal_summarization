    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge shows his dad the documents. It has his name on it as POA and all Eric has to do is sign it. He's not happy with Quinn being here but they will talk about that later. Right now they just need to talk about her not being POA and trying to take care of this house and the company. It can't be Quinn; it has to be Ridge. Quinn tells Pam once again that she loves Eric and she will be here all the time to take care of him. Liam tells Steffy that having her here in his arms in their house where all their memories are, he needs her here now. He says she does not have to bring everything over but just the essentials. He does not want her to leave. They can be discreet. He does realize she is trying to be sensitive to Wyatt. She says yes and that is why she would like to keep this just between them for now. She cannot move in now but she is ready to move forward. Without saying a word, he takes her hand and guides her to the bedroom. RJ tells Brooke that he is not that insecure little boy who wants his parents back together. But he knows how much they truly love each other and his dad is more than Bill will ever be to her. Rick walks in and tells Brooke that he would like an answer to what she and RJ were talking about. He realizes that she does not want to discuss her love life with her son. She reminds him that RJ does not like Bill anyway so she does not want Rick to add to that by talking badly about him too. They need Bill's shares. Rick says so far all of Ridge's ideas have been bad. Ridge keeps on about the POA until he upsets Eric and he calls out Quinn's name and finally manages to get to the panic button to get Quinn. She rushes in and Eric barks at Ridge to just go home. Steffy and Liam start to disrobe each other and he carries her to the bed. Afterwards he muses that everyone told him just to move on but he couldn't. She was always in his heart. She says even when things got rough she never stopped loving him either. Ridge tells Quinn that she has manipulated her way into a pretty nice situation. She says what situation she would like is that they get along. She is Eric's POA. Ridge tells her that he is going to continue to run the company and she will stay out of his way and he will give her a little office for her jewelry business. He will run the business and she can handle his father. He will check with the nurses and if she does one thing wrong she will be out of here as fast as she moved in. Eric has always let women snow him when they get their claws in him. None of them are here. She may have wrapped Eric around her little finger for now but it will fall to pieces and he will forget her. And make no mistake, her time is over here and Ridge will get rid of her.",
