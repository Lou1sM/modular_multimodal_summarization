    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Bill's house, Justin arrived, and Bill hailed the return of \"Sleeping Beauty.\" Bill had thought Justin would stay up with him all night to fix the mess. Justin touted that he was as fresh as a daisy, unlike Bill, who'd been dozing off the previous night. Justin revealed that he'd snooped around Liam's office. Bill corrected that it was Bill's office.\n\n\n\"I found this,\" Justin said, handing Bill a thumb drive.  Bill sat down to put it in his laptop to see what was on it. Justin had already checked it and said it was a copy of the audio file that Liam was using to blackmail Bill. Bill asserted that they'd wipe out all traces of it that very day.\n\n\nKen entered, and Bill exploded about how Ken wouldn't get any more tea or honey until the job was done. To Bill's surprise, Ken had completed the task. Ken said it hadn't been easy because that kid of Bill's really knew his stuff. Ken stated that he'd erased the file from all of Liam's devices and emails. The only thing Bill had to worry about was a physical backup of some kind.\n\n\nBill asked if Ken meant something like the thumb drive Justin had found. Affirming it, Ken said Bill was all set. Bill asked if Ken was sure, and Ken insisted that he was. Justin stated that it had become Bill's word against Liam's. Bill thanked Ken for his work and said, \"Let's do this.\"\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt sneaked up behind Katie to surprise her. She'd thought he'd been on his way to work. Wyatt said his car had a mind of its own and had taken Wyatt to Forrester because it had known he'd rather kiss a beautiful woman than suffer under his brother's coup.\n\n\nKatie thought Wyatt's support of Bill might ease tensions for when Bill learned about Katie and Wyatt's relationship. Wyatt doubted it. He didn't condone the actions of his brother or father. He thought the men were feeding off each other, and it would only be worse when Bill struck back.\n\n\nKatie thought it was what Wyatt would want because Wyatt wanted to be in charge. Wyatt said he didn't want Liam to be in charge, but he didn't want him hurt, either. \"Maimed. Lose a finger maybe, but that's about it,\" Wyatt joked. Wyatt knew Bill would be harsh in his revenge and quietly said it would be bad for Liam.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt was ending a call with Alison. He couldn't believe what she was saying and asked her to call him if Liam or Bill left the building. After the call, Wyatt told Katie that Bill had declared himself CEO of Spencer again. Katie asked if Liam would go to the police with the recording. Wyatt replied that Bill could have gotten rid of it somehow.\n\n\nKatie urged Wyatt to go to Spencer, but believing that Bill was in the middle of getting his revenge, Wyatt didn't want to get in the middle of it. Katie pondered whether Bill had gotten rid of the evidence. Wyatt replied that if Bill had, he could do whatever he wanted to Liam.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam reached for things around his desk and was puzzled when his penholder and trash can weren't in their usual spots. He called Alison to ask if they had hired a new cleaning service. When she said they hadn't, Liam murmured that it was really weird.\n\n\nAlison announced that Steffy was on her way in, and Steffy entered the office. Steffy was there to talk to Liam again about meeting Bill halfway and deleting the recording. Liam refused to rid himself of the only leverage he had against Bill. Liam believed Bill saw Liam as an enemy and wanted Steffy to stop defending Bill over her husband.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that she was trying to heal the family. Liam cited that Bill talked about him in the same tone as about Sally, and Bill had burned her building down. It made Liam wonder what Bill would do to Liam. Because Bill was out to get Liam, Liam had to keep the recording. Steffy wanted him to talk to his dad and said it could all go away if the men had a conversation.\n\n\nJust then, the door opened with a clang against the doorstop. The smug Justin and Bill arrived. \"When opportunity knocks...\" Steffy quipped. Bill replied that \"they say\" to walk softly but carry a big stick. Liam asked her if she'd invited Bill. Steffy hadn't. Liam asked Justin if he'd done it and said he'd thought Justin had been listening during the loyalty talk.\n\n\nJustin replied that he had been listening, and he was very loyal -- to one man, Dollar Bill Spencer, the CEO of that company. Liam declared himself the CEO, but Bill stated it wasn't so any longer. Placing a large framed photo of himself on the desk, Bill announced that he was reinstating himself. \"That's cute. But we both know you can't do that,\" Liam replied.\n\n\n\"Because of your little recording. Now that's cute,\" Bill retorted. Liam asked if Bill really wanted Liam to go to the police. Bill pretended to think about it and gave Liam the go-ahead. Puzzled, Liam said Bill really didn't want to call Liam's bluff.\n\n\nWith balled fists, Bill anxiously hopped up and down and said he really, really did want to. Bill suggested that Liam get Lieutenant Baker over there at that moment because Bill would take pleasure in watching Baker chew on Liam's \"ass\" for wasting Baker's time.\n\n\nLiam asked Bill what he'd done. Frowning, Bill replied that he hadn't done anything and had never broken a law in his life. Liam said Bill had confessed to arson. Bill believed Liam was mistaking Bill for someone else. Liam stated that he had it on tape. Bill gave Liam a haughty glare. Liam checked his phone and uttered, \"Gone...\"\n\n\nBill slipped up behind Liam faster than a vampire and asked, \"What's that?\" Liam stated that Bill had wiped it. Justin suggested that Liam check his digital backup and said it could be there. Liam replied that it wasn't. Liam asked how Bill had done it. Bill replied that there were computer nerds out there even more clever than Liam.\n\n\nLiam triumphantly said it was great, but Bill's computer nerd couldn't delete everything, \"because I happen to have -- \" Liam sat down and reached under his desk but grasped air. Bill held up the thumb drive. \"This?\" Bill asked and broke it in two.\n\n\nBill said Liam had to have known that Bill would work on it from the moment it had started. He declared that it was over and ordered Liam to get out of his chair.\n\n\nSteffy asked Bill what he was doing. Nose flaring, Bill said he was taking back what Liam had stolen. She asked about Bill's promise of peace. Bill replied that he'd been serious about it, but Liam hadn't been smart enough to cooperate. Liam grabbed the phone and dialed Alison. He urged her to pick up the phone.\n\n\n\"Alison, Alison, pick up the phone,\" Bill mocked. He said Alison didn't answer to Liam. Liam decided to go to security himself. Before he opened the office door, Justin stated that security didn't answer to Liam, either.\n\n\nBill stated that he'd expressed his regret for what had happened at Spectra again and again, \"But what did you do?\" he asked. Bill said Liam had used Bill's apology against him and backed Bill, Liam's own father, into a corner. It had been a stupid mistake.\n\n\nLiam said that standing up for what was right wasn't a stupid mistake. Bill told Liam that he could stand up for truth all day long, but it didn't come first. Neither did the law or Liam's \"feelings.\" Bill said only one thing was first for Spencers, and it was family. Bill asserted that family was above everything. \"Like me or not, agree with me or not, I am still your father!\" Bill declared. \"And that should have mattered!\"\n\n\nAdmitting that he'd made a mistake, Bill conveyed that his apology should have mattered, too, but it hadn't because Liam had been too power-hungry to care. \"Now you will pay. You think that matters? You think you care now?\" Bill exclaimed. Something told Bill that Liam did care, and Liam had to know there would be consequences.\n\n\nSteffy warned Bill not to do anything foolish. \"Like torch the Spectra building?\" Bill asked. He said he hadn't had anything to do with it, and though there was no evidence to the contrary, Liam could call the police if he thought his word was enough. Steffy said no one was doing that. Bill replied that they were no fun, and he suggested calling Baker over for a hot dog picnic.\n\n\nOrdering Bill to stop it, Steffy said that Bill knew what he'd done, regardless of having proof. In her view, Liam and Bill had each crossed the line, and she asked how they'd forgotten that they were father and son. Gesturing to Liam, Bill replied that Liam was the one who wouldn't compromise. Steffy accused Bill of starting it with his Spectra obsession and revenge threats.\n\n\nSteffy claimed that all Liam wanted was to be proud of the family, company, and Bill. To Liam, she said Bill wanted Liam to thrive and have the business someday. She advised that Liam let Bill help him. She said Liam could make Spencer into what he wanted it to be through collaboration, not because he'd stolen it from Bill. Refusing to let the family fall apart, Steffy urged the men to find a way that very day because the company belonged to them both.\n\n\nLiam told Bill that recording Bill hadn't been Liam's best moment, but Bill had hit Liam. \"You deserved it,\" Bill replied. Steffy called Bill's name, and Bill added, \"But it was a mistake.\" Bill knew that he should have done some things differently, but he was a man of his word. Liam recalled that Bill had vowed to get back at Liam, and Liam assumed Bill still intended to.\n\n\nBill asked if Liam knew how betrayed Bill had felt. Liam quipped that his bruised face had given it away. Bill stated that he'd punched more guys than he could even remember, and he was talking about the anger he'd felt sitting at home while Liam was sitting at Bill's desk. Bill had wondered what his father would have done if Bill had hurt him that way.\n\n\n\"Assault me? Kill me?\" Bill pondered. Liam looked surprised. Bill told Liam not to be shocked. It was the Spencer way to eliminate the enemy. Bill said Liam could thank Steffy, who had a way of calming Bill. Steffy had been Bill's voice of reason and had become his confidante. Steffy had made Bill realize that there was only one thing Bill wanted, and Liam would give it to him.\n\n\n\"Your forgiveness,\" Bill uttered. He wanted his family back and his son back. Bill had decided that if Liam would forgive Bill, Bill would forgive Liam. Bill said that he loved Liam and hugged him. Steffy sobbed, and Justin patted Liam's back. Hugging Bill back, Liam that he loved Bill, too. Bill shed a tear as he held Liam.\n\n\n",

He doesn't know what he would do without her. She wonders what he will do if she cannot change Liam's mind. Liam tells Justin that his dad was just in here the other day telling him that he had revenge plans for him. And he knows Justin is Bill's only link to the office now and he needs to know he can trust him 100% or otherwise he has to go.

Steffy tells Liam that this has gone on long enough so they need to end it. She knows Bill was out of control but he loves Liam and wants to end this. She says she is sorry but watching him and his father go at it is pure torture so please do this for her. He reminds her that he gave his dad an option otherwise he would be in prison. She asks him for the confession. Liam says he cannot do that. That is his only bargaining power. He can feel his dad doing something as they speak. It is his only recourse to keep his dad in line. She begs again for him to end this feud.
