He said he did not know what was more difficult, dealing with the loss of Darla or dealing with Taylor hurting Alexandria by counseling her about the death of her mommy, while being her mommy's killer. Taylor continued to apologize to Thorne, while continuing to not blame Darla in her defense. \n\n\nRidge and Brooke comforted Thomas as he found out about his mother's deception and confession while Phoebe explained that Taylor lied and covered up what happened to protect her. While Taylor waited for sentencing, Storm visited Brooke and told her that there was really nothing he could do since this was Taylor's wish. Ridge brought Thomas and Phoebe to visit Taylor in her jail cell before sentencing. Stephanie continued to persuade Shane to tell the judge what he saw, despite repeated protests from Shane who claimed that Stephanie told him that no judge would believe him and to stay away from the courtroom. Shane asked Stephanie how telling what happened would benefit him. Stephanie asked what he wanted, and he said there was something that he wanted very much. She said fine, \"whatever it is is yours\" and they proceeded to Taylor's sentencing hearing. \n\n\nAs everyone was waiting for the hearing to begin, Sally was harassed by reports, and she told Eric that she wanted to be there for Thorne and make sure Darla got justice. Bridget comforted Phoebe, then Eric asked Bridget if she had told Dante and Felicia who the father of the baby was. Bridget said no, not yet. Stephanie took Shane to the courtroom as Shane was nervously looking around asking why there were so many police in the building. Stephanie told him not to worry, just to tell the judge what he saw. \n\n\nThe judge sentenced Taylor to 60 days for Driving with a Suspended License, 1 year for Obstruction of Justice, and 10 years for Vehicular Manslaughter. Taylor broke down and hugged Thomas and Phoebe who pleaded with Thorne as to why Storm was not doing anything. Ridge said Taylor wanted it to be this way. As the judge was about to adjourn the hearing, Stephanie walked in with Shane begging the judge not to close the hearing. The judge asked the guard to contain that woman. Stephanie continued talking saying that Shane witnessed the accident that killed Darla on Pacific Coast Highway. The judge asked Shane if that was true and he said yes. Thorne emphatically asked Shane if Darla really fell into Taylor's car, and the show ended without Shane giving his answer. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Thomas demands answers from Phoebe, Ridge and Brooke and is shocked to learn what is happening with his mother. They head down to the jail to spend a few minutes with Taylor as they wait for court to resume. Stephanie is at the mansion trying desperately to convince Shane to testify on Taylor's behalf, but he reminds her of all the times she warned him that he had better keep his mouth shut. Court begins with Brooke, Ridge, Phoebe, Bridget and Thomas sitting with Taylor, and Eric, Sally and Thorne on the opposite side of the courtroom. The judge begins his sentencing, giving Taylor sixty days in jail for driving without a license, one year for obstruction of justice, and ten years in maximum security for vehicular manslaughter. Stephanie bursts in with Shane and announces what he saw, so Thorne demands to know if his mother is telling the truth.\r\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Thorne visits Taylor in her cell, finding it hard to believe that she cherishes him. Time won't heal this wound but she exclaims that she will pay for what she did when she is sentenced. Somehow he doesn't think ten years is going to explain that to little Alexandria. She says she is sorry and he has every right to hate her. It's little comfort to him that the person responsible is the same person who has become the most important woman in his life and he even thought Darla approved of that. Now they are all looking at her like some ding-bat which she is not. Taylor agrees, she was a SAINT, not a fool. Thomas joins in with Ridge and Phoebe and Brooke. Shane plays cat and mouse with Stephanie taunting her if he should offer his testimony or just keep his mouth shut. Is she trying to buy his testimony? She cuts to the chase and asks what does he want \u0096 it's his. With Thorne hidden and watching nearby, Taylor has a tearful reunion with Thomas and Phoebe and Ridge. Sally wants to support Thorne and get Darla justice so she sits on the prosecution side. The judge hands down the sentence and Stephanie breaks into court spouting that this man saw it all, it was not vehicular manslaughter and Taylor needs to change her plea. Assistant attorney Tartaro objects, but Thorne rises and face to face with Shane asks if this is true? Did his wife fall into the path of Taylor's car?",
