    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the beach house, Hope declared that she'd never been so adamant in all her life as she was that Quinn would be nowhere near Hope's family, which included Deacon. Deacon thought Hope was being a little harsh, but she contended that she was showing enormous restraint. Quinn murmured to Wyatt to use his influence. \"Hope feels how she feels, Mom,\" Wyatt responded.\n\n\nQuinn said Hope needed to understand Quinn, who wasn't manor-born like Hope. Hope seethed that Quinn was no mystery. \"You're a conniving, scheming, dangerous woman with no moral center or regard for human life. You play your son shamelessly and tell him it's love,\" Hope asserted.\n\n\nQuinn replied that Hope couldn't keep Quinn's son from Quinn. Hope quipped that she wouldn't be so sure about that. \"And what the hell is this?\" Hope asked, waving her fingers between Deacon and Quinn. Deacon said that he and Quinn had been living together for quite some time.\n\n\nHope recalled that Deacon had been extremely vague about his living arrangements, and she asked if Quinn had targeted him. Deacon contended that it hadn't been like that, but Hope asked how he knew for sure, because Quinn was a master deceiver. Quinn resented the statement. \"I wouldn't if I were you. You earned this,\" Wyatt interjected.\n\n\nHope believed that Quinn had charmed Deacon to use him as the father card in her back pocket to get back into Hope's life. Quinn didn't know whether to be insulted or flattered by the credit Hope had given her. Hope asked Deacon how he could feel anything for Quinn after what she'd done to Hope.\n\n\nQuinn asked what was so wrong with Hope's life and noted that Hope was happily married and pregnant with a doting family around her. Quinn merely wanted her rightful place in it. \"No,\" Hope replied. Deacon sided with Quinn, who was Wyatt's mother, a part of the family and \"with me now.\" Deacon appealed to Hope's forgiving side and reminded her that she'd forgiven him for his interference with her and Liam. Deacon asked why Hope couldn't do the same with Quinn.\n\n\nHope conveyed that she'd forgiven Quinn more times than Quinn had deserved, but Quinn never stopped. Forgiveness was pointless with Quinn, and Hope refused to keep looking over her shoulder for the next thing her crazy mother-in-law chose to do. \"And if you were smart, you'd walk away right now -- before she pulls a sword on you while you sleep,\" Hope told her father.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that she'd appalled herself by the act with Liam, and it had been why she'd gotten treatment. Deacon said they had a shot at being a real family through the child that connected them. He asked Hope to give Quinn another chance for his sake and reminded Hope of the togetherness the family had experienced at the wedding party at Brooke's house. Deacon saw no reason that it couldn't be like that all the time. \"Quinn is the reason!\" Hope replied.\n\n\nIt really worried Hope that Deacon was blind to Quinn. Hope figured he was frustrated about not being with her mother, but she implored him to find anyone else but Quinn. Deacon declared that Quinn had issues. \"Hell, she's got volumes!\" he exclaimed, but he added that Quinn was working on it.\n\n\nQuinn said Deacon deserved props for keeping her centered. Hope asked Deacon not to believe Quinn's act. Haggard and upset, Hope stated that the woman had tried to kill Liam and had pushed Ivy into a river. Hope didn't know how he could present Quinn and expect the women to hug it out.\n\n\nQuinn asked Wyatt to defend his mother. Wyatt said Quinn made it hard due to the things she'd done. \"For you!\" Quinn replied. Hope told Quinn not to put her crazy onto Hope's husband. Quinn claimed she'd never hurt Hope. Quinn said that they were family, and Hope couldn't wish it away.\n\n\nHope asserted that nothing Quinn said mattered, and Hope would never change her mind. \"I will always feel this way. I don't want you around my child!\" Hope declared.\n\n\nTo Deacon, Hope said she loved the closeness they'd gained. She loved him and wanted him in her life, but her responsibility was to her child and husband. Hope stated that he had to choose. \"If she's going to be a part of your life, then you can't be a part of mine. It's either her or me,\" Hope said.\n\n\nIn Rick's office with Ivy, Caroline was riddled with guilt over being attracted to Ridge while married to the love of her life. Caroline wondered what was wrong with herself.\n\n\nIn Katie's bedroom, Ridge abruptly pulled away from Katie upon imagining that he was kissing Caroline. Katie asked what was wrong. He decided that Katie was right, and he wasn't a user like Bill. Ridge stated that he'd design the last dress with Caroline and then end the collaboration and remove all temptation. Katie called it a wise choice and left to check on Will.\n\n\nRidge called Caroline to arrange a time to finish the collection. Caroline told him that she was at Forrester, but he wanted to meet at the cabin on Brooke's property because it was more private.\n\n\nLater, Katie arrived in Rick's office, where Ivy was fretting over whether her jewelry was right for the couture collection. Ivy noted that Caroline and Ridge were working together well and sensed that it was the beginning of a long collaboration. Katie doubted that. \"In fact, I know it's not,\" Katie added.\n\n\nIvy asked if there was a problem. Katie said there wasn't; however, the collaboration was ending, and Katie was in the building to talk to Rick about it. Ivy asked if Ridge was unhappy with Caroline's work, and Katie said she believed Ridge thought Caroline was a talented designer.\n\n\nIvy asked why they'd stop working together, and Katie noted that the line was almost finished. Ivy asked if Caroline knew that it was ending. Katie said Ridge intended to tell Caroline that very day.\n\n\nAt the cabin, Caroline arrived and asked why she and Ridge were meeting there instead of the office. Ridge said it afforded them privacy and less interruptions. He was eager to finish the last design and end the collaboration, because it was not right. Caroline asked if he was feeling something, too.\n\n\nRidge couldn't lie. He thought about Caroline all the time. \"I have crazy thoughts. But I love Katie. I really do,\" he added. He planned to marry Katie, and he couldn't let the collaboration derail things. He felt that he and Caroline were on dangerous ground, and it was his fault. Caroline said she'd been there, too. Ridge stated that the fight was between him and Rick.\n\n\nCaroline conveyed that she couldn't go against her husband no matter how much she liked and respected Ridge. Ridge replied that he shouldn't have asked. Smiling, she said he'd been being himself by single-mindedly going after something he wanted. \"And now I'm single-mindedly stepping away from it,\" he told her. He turned away, and darting her eyes to the floor, she agreed that it was best.\n\n\nRidge whipped around, and as he neared her, he heartily revealed that he'd enjoyed the connection they'd had and how unselfish she'd been with him. He appeared to move in to kiss her. She braced herself, but he moved past her to pick up a sketchpad.\n\n\n\"Ta-da!\" Ridge exclaimed, showing her a drawing he'd done himself.\n\n\nCaroline said the design was wonderful. Ridge disagreed; however, he felt it was a start, and he had to find his way back. She remarked that she'd known that one day he wouldn't need her anymore. He asked her not to say that because it sounded as if he'd used her and was discarding her, which wasn't the case. She dismissed the notion and said she'd leave the cabin a better designer than she'd believed she ever could be. Thanking him, she said he'd rock his own designs, and she'd rock hers.\n\n\n\"When we kissed,\" Ridge said. Caroline waved her hand and said no one else needed to know. He believed it was for the best. She remarked she'd miss \"us -- \" what they'd created together. Caressing her shoulders, he stated that she'd taught him things he hadn't known about himself and had made him see things through someone else's eyes.\n\n\nCaroline revealed that he had changed her perspective as a designer and a woman. She'd always treasure their time together. Ridge felt the same and hoped Rick knew what he had in her, but if Rick ever forgot, Ridge said that she could call him. They agreed to get to work for one last time.\n\n\nCaroline grabbed a pencil and stood before an easel. Ridge slipped up behind her and placed his hand over hers. As they formed lines on the paper, she leaned back into him, and he nuzzled his nose in her hair. A woman in a gown took form on the pad, and Ridge and Caroline teetered on the verge of abandon. His face rolled against her hair. Tossing the pencil across the room, he gathered her in his arms and locked his mouth into her quavering lips. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Feeling immense guilt about what has recently transpired with Caroline, Ridge calls her to meet him to discuss their partnership. Deacon drops a bombshell about him and Quinn during a visit with Hope and Wyatt. While at Brooke\u2019s cabin, Ridge and Caroline partake in a passionate designing session. Hope gives Deacon an ultimatum in regards to his relationships with her and Quinn.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hope repeats it again. She meant it when she said she did not want Quinn anywhere near her family and that includes Deacon too. She will never change her mind on that. Quinn is not welcome in this family. Wyatt tells them that Hope has a right to her feelings. Quinn gives her side that maybe Hope needs to understand her more before she judges her. Hope says Quinn has no moral center for any life and she wants no part of her. She is shocked also that Deacon is now into it. He tells Hope that it may come as a surprise but they have been living together for some time now. Hope can't figure how Deacon could have anything to do with this woman after all she has done to her. Quinn says all she wants is her rightful place in her new grandchild's life. Hope again says no. Deacon tries again to beg Hope to just forgive Quinn. Hope says she has, more times than she deserves and it just keeps happening. She is not going to live like that looking out for her crazy MIL. And if Deacon is smart he would walk away right now before she pulls a sword on him too. Deacon begs again that please for him, do not shut Quinn out. He admits that Quinn has issues but she is working on it. Hope says she can not believe he is so blind toward Quinn. She tried to kill Liam and pushed Ivy in the Seine. Quinn tells Wyatt to defend her, he should defend his mother. He says that makes it hard with all the things she does. Quinn says she knows she has gone too far but she never would hurt Hope or her family. She can not wish that away now that they are family. Hope says she will always feel this way. She cares about Deacon and that he is in her life and that is something she always wanted but her loyalty is to her husband and her child. So it's Deacon's decision. If Quinn is going to be part of his life, then he can not be part of her life. It is either Quinn or her. Caroline laments to Ivy that she loves her husband and she should not be having these feelings for Ridge. She should be kissing the ground that Rick walks on and not thinking of Ridge. What is wrong with her? Ridge pulls away from his kiss with Kate and she notices and asks what is wrong. He tells Katie that he only has one more design with Caroline and then he will be finished, no more working together. Ridge calls Caroline and says he wants to work today and finish things ..but not at the office. They need more privacy so he suggests the cabin on Brooke's place. He explains there that he doesn't want interruptions like Rick popping in every five minutes. Brooke is not here now so no interruptions. They can finish their collaboration as it is not right to continue to lean on her. Katie tells Ivy that Ridge is telling Caroline today that their working has come to an end. Ridge tells Caroline that he loves Katie and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. This is dangerous ground they are on and he has leaned on her too much. This divides him and Rick and he should not have asked her to do this. He says he enjoyed what they had together and what they produced and he does not know how to thank her for that. He says he needs to find his way back and he knows that sounds like he is throwing her aside, but he just thinks it is time. She says she will always be grateful for working with him. He has changed her as a designer and as a woman. Ridge tells her that Rick is lucky to have her and he hopes he knows that. She says okay; she is ready for one last time. He takes the pencil and puts it in her hands with his guiding hers. He leans closer and smells her hair from behind. Finally he grabs the pencil and tosses it away and kisses her again and again and she responds despite her resolve.",
