To prove his point, Ridge pulls Brooke into a passionate kiss!",
    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn sits with Eric and when he asks she says Ridge can be a little intimidating but she can handle him. Eric asks if he threatened her. She says no, but she has changed the security guards so Ridge cannot move her out in the middle of the night. They will only be loyal to them, not Ridge. Later Wyatt comes over and says he is not in the best mood today. She says he does not have to lose Steffy. He can fight, that is the way she raised him. She explains to him the new security team and she will not jeopardize her husband's health even if it is to keep his own son away. As they look in on Eric he says that Quinn needs her son so he wants Wyatt to move in. Donna comes home and stops by Bill's to find out about the wedding. He says they cannot wait any longer for a teenage boy to come around. Ridge and Brooke discuss her needing to marry Bill to get the shares when Brooke tells him that RJ has not come around yet. He still believes she and Ridge ought to be together. Ridge says he thinks that way too. She asks outright if he has feelings for her. He jokes that of course he does. Brooke tells Ridge that Eric will eventually realize what he has done and kick Quinn out. Ridge says they do not have that long; they need to get rid of her now. Bill tells Donna that once before Ridge stopped him from marrying Brooke but what he cannot stop is their love. Brooke tells Ridge one more time that she is a big girl and she can take care of herself. She's told him before that she would never marry Bill or anyone just to make a business transaction. He tells her there is something about her, his Logan, and he just wants her to be happy. Maybe it is all this talk about memories from RJ but he is thinking about them too. Wyatt is shocked. He says he had his reservations about them as a married couple but this is a lot to think about to actually move in with them. Quinn keeps babbling and trying to get him to say yes. He says he does not hate the idea but he thinks they need a private moment. Carter comes in with a copy of the unsigned marriage license and says they need to take care of that. Wyatt wants to leave but Eric reminds him no one in the family was there for the wedding; he wants him to stay now. Ridge tells Brooke that Bill should not even be allowed to look at her much less to marry her. Bill calls Brooke and says the journey is theirs now so they need to get it done. He will not go back on his word and she can have the shares and hand them over to Ridge if she wants to. She tells Ridge and says that is what she wants. Then he kisses her. Quinn signs the license and then Eric does. He wants Carter to say it \u0096 \"I now pronounce you man and wife and you may kiss the bride.\" Carter says it is official so his work is done. Wyatt says now he knows they need some alone time. Eric tells him stay once again. He wants to even call him son. Wyatt says he is very honored if they both want this. He will move in. Eric thanks him. He says he is sorry Wyatt lost Steffy. He is not as pretty as her but Wyatt has him now.",
