    "imdb": "Steffy makes another attempt to get Liam to drop the blackmail against Bill and to get rid of the evidence proving his father's guilt. Meanwhile, Bill is having a field day when Justin informs him that he found a flash-drive containing a copy of the incriminating confession in Liam's office. Bill is even more pleased when Ken, the savvy computer tech, announces that he managed to wipe Liam's computer and cellphone files. Wyatt surprises Katie at work and they further discuss the power play for Spencer Publications between Bill and Liam. Having everything that he needs to regain his company, Bill enters his former office ready for a showdown with his son. He urges Liam to call the police as he will no longer be blackmailed - and instead resume the reigns over the company. When they find out that Bill managed to delete all evidence, Steffy warns her father-in-law to be reasonable and Liam begins to feel the heat. Bill then stuns everyone by announcing, that Liam should thank his wife, because she made him realize that there is only one thing he wants: he wants to make peace with his son.",
    "tvmega_recap": "In his office Liam seems concerned. He asks Alison if they have hired new cleaning crew; she says no. Then he is distracted when Steffy walks in. She tells him again that he has to meet Bill half way but do away with the blackmail. He tells her to quit siding with Bill like he is the victum. She says she is not; she is only trying to get the family back together. He tells her that he has to be ready as Bill already torched Spectra so no telling what he would do to him. Justin shows up at Bill's to show him what he was doing while Bill was snoozing. Supposingly it is a tape of the confession by Bill so this is a start of his comeback to life. The computer wiz comes in and says it is done. He has deleted all on the harddrive so he is all set unless Liam had backup copies somewhere else. Bill thanks him and says he was worth every penny he paid him. Steffy tells Liam that all of this will go away if he just has a normal conversation. Bill and Justin walk in. Liam smells something. Justin says he was listening to what Liam said about loyalty and his only loyalty is to Dollar Bill Spencer. Liam tells Bill he should not be here and he can call the police if he doesn't. Bill smiles and says go ahead. Liam is bumfuzzled. Bill explains to him that there are nerds out there nerdier than him when it comes to computers and Liam no longer has the taped confession he thought he had. Surely he knew as long as Bill was alive he would find that tape somehow. With Liam crushed and dismayed Bill snaps the tape in half and destroys it, even asking if he had any backup tapes no, he didn't think so. So go ahead and call the police and let them chew his ass out for calling them in for nothing. Alison calls Wyatt and tells him that his dad is at Spencer and says he is now CEO again. Maybe he should come over. Bill tells Liam that he has apologized over and over but Liam backed him into a corner and that was a mistake. There is only one thing when your last name is Spencer and that is loyalty. He is still his father and make no mistake about that, but perhaps Liam is too power hungry to care. Katie suggests that Wyatt needs to go over to Spencer. He says he will when the dust settles or they get rid of the bodies. Bill says there is no evidence that he set the fire but if Liam thinks his word is that good then go for it. Steffy jumps in and rails at Bill that he started this, but she tells Liam that his father wants him to have Spencer Publications some day. This company belongs to both of them so start acting that way and learn to get along. Bill says there are a lot of things he would have done differently. Liam does not know how he made him feel especially when he lost Brooke. Spencer's eliminate their enemies so what will Liam do now, kill him? Liam looks shocked. Bill walks to him but with fists tightened and Liam is standing there waiting for his punishment. Instead Bill has tears in his eyes when he says he loves Liam and wants him as his son so he will apologize if Liam will. He gives Liam a big old bear hug. Liam tells him he loves him too.",
