    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the cabin, Ridge and Caroline made out. Ridge said he was going to miss their collaboration. Caroline said Ridge didn't need her anymore. Caroline walked over to the sketchpad and held up the pencil. \"Go ahead. You can do it. Take the big bad pencil. Don't be afraid. Show me what you got. Do it, Ridge,\" Caroline said.\n\n\nRidge took the pencil and started to sketch, and Caroline watched. Ridge finished a sketch, and set the pencil down. Caroline and Ridge smiled at one another.\n\n\nRidge said the sketch was a little rough, but Caroline disagreed. She noted that they had shared some incredible creativity in design. She said she could only imagine what else they could have done. \"I guess we'll never know,\" she said. \"No,\" Ridge answered. She moved in closer to Ridge and said goodbye. Caroline left, and Ridge watched through the window as she walked away.\n\n\nAt Forrester, in Rick's office, Rick checked out a dress that a model was wearing. He pulled some accents off of it, and the model seemed shocked. Rick noted that he couldn't tell if the one item had been a bow or a dead bird. He said he didn't mind Ridge and Caroline taking risks, but he didn't like the look.\n\n\nMaya walked in, and Rick dismissed the model. Maya asked if Rick had become a designer. He responded that he was the president and future CEO, and he didn't like the design that Caroline and Ridge had produced.\n\n\nMaya mocked Caroline and Ridge as \"the happy little design team.\" \"Where are they right now, anyway?\" asked Maya. Rick coldly replied that he didn't care where they were as long as they had created more award-winning designs. Maya noted that Ridge and Caroline had not been in the office, and their cars had not been in the parking lot.\n\n\nRick tired of her insinuations, but Maya interrupted that she had seen Caroline in Ridge's arms. Rick advised her that they could have embraced for any reason. Rick said he had often embraced people during the day, but it didn't mean he wanted to jump in the sack with them. Rick refused to accept Maya's attacks on his wife.\n\n\n\"Be careful and be aware,\" Maya said. Rick called her bluff and said that she had clearly wanted to drive a wedge between Rick and Caroline ever since Maya and Carter had broken up. Maya ranted that Caroline didn't appreciate the life that Rick had given to her. Maya walked out, and Rick looked angry.\n\n\nAt Hope and Wyatt's, Hope tried to convince her father that Quinn was no good. Hope had given Deacon an ultimatum that it was Quinn or her. Hope maintained that she intended to keep Quinn far away from her family. Hope advised Deacon that Quinn had been using him. Deacon tried to persuade Hope to give Quinn a chance, but Hope refused. Quinn tried to interrupt, but Wyatt told both Quinn and Deacon to leave.\n\n\nQuinn agreed they should leave to let Hope cool off. Deacon and Quinn exited, and Hope hugged Wyatt. She admitted that she loved her dad, but she refused to see him with Quinn. Wyatt worried that Quinn and Deacon were stressing Hope, and he didn't want any stress on her or the baby. Wyatt said that it might be good that Quinn had something to focus on other than Hope and Wyatt, but Hope disagreed. She knew that Quinn would try to worm her way back into their lives.\n\n\nHope acknowledged that Brooke had hurt her dad, and she understood that Deacon had enjoyed the attention from Quinn. Wyatt kissed her to stop her from talking. \"We can't worry about what our parents do,\" he said. He wanted them to worry about their own family. \"We'll be the parents we never had,\" Wyatt said. He and Hope kissed.\n\n\nAt Quinn's, Deacon tried to comfort Quinn, who angrily said that Hope had rejected her. \"Granny does have a history,\" Deacon noted about Quinn. Quinn insisted that Hope had to give her a chance, but Deacon defended Hope. Quinn said she had wanted to instill peace and harmony in her family. Deacon wondered if Quinn had been using him. Quinn scoffed and said that Hope had thrown huge temper tantrums.\n\n\nDeacon countered that he barely knew Quinn. He agreed that Quinn had used him in the beginning, and Quinn admitted it, but she said they had done much more than share a few beers, a few laughs, and more. Deacon was despondent. \"I think I've overstayed my welcome. Nobody cons me. Not even you. I'm outta here,\" he said. Deacon opened the door to leave.\n\n\n\"You're not going anywhere,\" Quinn ordered, and she took off her coat. Quinn insisted that he had to experience a little bit more of what she had to offer. They kissed passionately, and Quinn pushed Deacon down on the couch. She placed her stiletto heel on his chest and inquired what his safe word was. \"Diamonds,\" Deacon replied, and he smiled. Quinn jumped on top of him. \n\n\n",

While playing on Rick\u2019s insecurities concerning his marriage, Maya lets him know that she will be there for him no matter what. Having considered Hope\u2019s viewpoint, Deacon confronts Quinn about her intentions towards him. Ridge makes great strides in the drawing of his and Caroline\u2019s latest design.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Rick is not happy with the latest design. Maya walks in and questions it and wonders why neither Ridge or Caroline's car is in the parking lot. She wonders where they are. Rick says it makes no difference as long as they are designing more lovely pieces. Ridge and Caroline continue the kiss but then she gets another pencil and gives it to him and says he can do it. Deacon asks Hope if she is giving him an ultimatum. She opines that she has good reason to keep Quinn from her family and if Deacon chooses Quinn then he needs to know he will be out of Hope's life. Quinn manipulates people to get what she want. Right now she is using him. Hope tells Deacon that he is smarter than that. He should see through this con. Deacon and Quinn leave and Wyatt holds Hope. He brings her some herbal tea. He hates to see her stressed out. He says he knows she does not like his mom and her dad together, but maybe that is a good thing to keep her away from them. Quinn tells Deacon that she is only trying to bring peace and love into this family. She should be knitting, picking out names or helping with the nursery but this is the way that Hope treats her. She is being completely unreasonable throwing these temper tantrums. Maya tells Rick that the pairing of Caroline and Ridge goes way beyond the sketch pad. Rick tells Maya that this is enough. If she has something to say then just spit it out. She says she just wants him to open his eyes and be aware. She has not said anything specific until now, but she caught them in each other's arms. They were not designing. Ridge takes the pencil and finishes the sketch all by himself. Wyatt asks Hope if she meant it when she said Deacon had to chose. She says she hopes by saying that he will take another look and realize what this will cost him. Wyatt agrees that his mom is using Deacon as much as he is using her. They simply can not worry about what their parents do. The baby is all that matters, keeping her or him happy and safe. They just need to live their lives and let their parents lead theirs. Quinn comes on to Deacon and says Hope does not realize what they have, how they touch. He is Hope's father and can be useful but they have gotten past that. He will just be letting Hope get away with this by being paranoid and letting Hope inside his head. He starts to leave and she says wait, he is not going anywhere. She starts peeling off her clothes. She tells him to close the door. He's staying and she is not going to stop until he sees exactly what else she has to offer. It doesn't take any encouragement; he follows her to the couch and she pushes him back on it with her stilettos on his chest. Maya puts more seeds of doubt in Rick's mind about Caroline and Rick. Caroline is happy to see that Ridge is getting his groove back. She comes to him and is \"thisclose\" to his lips but then says goodbye and leaves.",
