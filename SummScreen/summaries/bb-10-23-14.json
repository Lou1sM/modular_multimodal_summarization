Maya stated that she was excited to see Rick achieve his goals because he'd wanted the position for a long time. Carter was confident that Eric would pick Ridge, not Rick, but Carter could see it on Maya's face that she'd stir up trouble for Caroline and Ridge if Rick didn't get the job. \n\n\nMaya asserted that she knew for certain that Ridge and Caroline were involved. Carter said that Maya was blowing up an innocent sign of affection, but she insisted that the hug she'd seen hadn't been innocent. She was glad she'd told Rick about it, so he wouldn't be blindsided. \n\n\nCarter remarked that Maya never stopped digging, and Maya asked how he could know her but still term her a gold-digger. \"By your actions now, not then,\" he responded. Carter didn't know if the Maya of the past had been real. She guessed she was learning how much she'd hurt him, and he replied that it had been better to break things off before one of them had been unable to keep her vows.\n\n\nMaya claimed that she'd really wanted to marry Carter. She'd really thought she'd been over Rick and moving on with the wonderful Carter; however, while planning the wedding, she'd begun to discover what she really wanted, and it hadn't had to do with Rick's money.\n\n\nMaya doubted that ignoring her heart so would have been good for either of them. Being with Carter hadn't been a mistake for Maya. Instead, her time with him had been sweet. Carter agreed, and she asked him to try to remember that whenever he thought the worst of her. She wanted him to be her friend. Carter replied that it was a tall order, and she said she could wait. \n\n\nAfter some time in silence, Maya began to speak. \"So, friend, have you heard? The dream team split up,\" she said. Maya was sure that the pair was running from their attraction. Carter displayed concern about Maya, who was making something out of nothing and becoming crazy in her obsession. \n\n\nMaya insisted that the designers were having an affair -- an emotional one if not a physical one. Because she refused to let Caroline make a fool of Rick, Maya was tempted to call Caroline out at the meeting that day. Carter warned against making baseless accusations. Maya stated that she knew what she'd seen, and Rick and Katie deserved to know about Ridge and Caroline's involvement. \n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie noted that it was a big day for Ridge, who'd take his rightful place as the CEO of Forrester. Ridge admired her confidence. She said his design skills had returned, and though the collaboration had been good, it was time to move on with their lives. He tonelessly agreed. \n\n\nFor luck, Katie fastened a leather strap on Ridge's wrist. She believed that he'd get the job because he was the designer, and Rick would just have to deal with that. Katie asked if Rick had picked up on Caroline's crush on Ridge. Ridge said there was nothing to pick up on or discuss, and it was time to move on. Katie added that they'd move on to bigger and better things. In her view, Eric had made the right choice in Ridge as the CEO. \n\n\nLater, Katie was working on colors for the guest bedroom when Donna arrived. Pam had told Donna to take a long lunch, and Donna guessed Pam had her ear pressed to the door of the CEO's office. Donna remarked that once Ridge became CEO, Katie would see a lot less of him. \"If you think Caroline monopolized his time, just wait and see what this job does,\" Donna said.\n\n\nKatie became hesitant but then admitted that Caroline had developed a \"bit of a crush\" on Ridge. Donna asked if it was serious. Katie called it \"moderate-to-mild.\" Katie conveyed that Ridge had talked to Caroline, and the feelings had ended along with the collaboration. Katie said Rick didn't know about it, and she thanked God that he didn't have to. \n\n\nIn Rick's office, Caroline thought of Ridge. Rick entered and announced that it was the day that everything changed. \"Will it be me, or will it be Ridge?\" Rick asked. He felt that it was a real turning point for him and Caroline, who were in it together like Stephanie and Eric. \n\n\nRick asked if Caroline was up for it. As they held each other's hands against their chests, she affirmed that it was their dream. She never wanted Rick to doubt that he could always count upon her. He asked why he'd doubt her. She claimed to be flighty but said her feet were planted firmly by his side. \"Nothing and no one could ever change that,\" she added, and as Caroline and Rick kissed, Ridge observed them from outside the door. \n\n\nWhen Ridge entered, Rick joked that Ridge was there to concede. Ridge quipped that it was the only way Rick would get the job. Caroline and Ridge exchanged curt greetings, and Rick stated that he was glad Ridge's skills had returned because Rick would need Caroline's full support as soon as Eric named Rick CEO. Ridge thought Rick should brace himself for disappointment.\n\n\nRick didn't believe he'd need to. Ridge said he'd always valued Rick's talents, and there was no reason they couldn't work together. Rick thought it was big of Ridge to say, but Ridge needed to reverse the scenario. Rick said he had Caroline, his partner for life, and they were a team just like Eric and Stephanie. Serious that time, Rick advised Ridge to concede. \n\n\nIn Eric's office, Eric stared at family pictures as Hope talked about getting HFTF's summer line together. She noticed his distraction and assured him that he'd made the right decision. Eric stated that one of his sons would be happy, and the other would be incredibly disappointed. \n\n\nHope believed that, after a while, the son not chosen would make peace with the decision. Eric wanted a strategy in place to deal with rumors and the press. Hope agreed, saying that they needed to take any opportunity to preempt gossip. \n\n\nAs Hope took a call, Ivy arrived to see how Eric was feeling about the day's announcement. Eric was still concerned about the son not chosen, but Ivy said it was a business decision based upon Eric looking out for the business. Hope cut an icy look at Ivy as Eric chuckled about Ivy being practical. \n\n\nIvy felt that Eric was the fairest person she knew, and his decision was the way forward. Ivy hugged Eric and asked if he was ready. \"Yes, Miss Forrester,\" Eric replied, and Hope looked at them again. Smiling, Eric added, \"Let's do this.\"\n\n\nLater, employees gathered in the CEO's office. Maya let Rick know that she was on his team. She said he was the best man for the job and the best man she'd ever known. Caroline's Maya radar popped up, and Caroline rejoined her husband to ask what the conversation with Maya was about. \n\n\nRick said Maya was lending her support to them, and Maya corrected that she supported Rick. Maya asked who Caroline supported, Rick or -- \"what is Ridge to you these days, anyways?\" Maya asked.\n\n\nEric called the meeting to order. Caroline squeezed Rick's hand but also stole a glance at Ridge. Eric announced that he planned to follow his brother's lead and find a balance in life. Eric wanted to get out and do things, or sometimes he'd do nothing at all. He wasn't stepping down. He'd still be designing, mentoring, and watching over them all; however, he was ready to hand Forrester over to its future. \n\n\nIt hadn't been an easy choice for Eric, who'd sought advice from people within the company and from people outside of it. Eric said that Ridge had given his talent and dedication for years and years. Eric believed that Ridge was the best designer in the world, as proven by the collaboration with Caroline, whose real partner was Rick.\n\n\nEric believed that Rick had grown by leaps and bounds, and Forrester had benefited from the expertise Rick had gained from Forrester International. Eric said that Rick had had the good sense to marry a wonderful woman who complimented him on every level. \n\n\nEric was proud of both of his sons, who were each qualified and gifted. Those very things made Eric's choice difficult, but he vowed to make certain that Rick and Ridge functioned as partners and brothers. \"Now, having said that, the new CEO of Forrester Creations is...\" Eric began to announce. \n\n\n",

Now able to draw again, Ridge is confident that he will be the one chosen to run the company. Rick is convinced that, with Caroline by his side, he and his wife have the ability to be the next Eric and Stephanie Forrester in the fashion industry.",

    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline looks at the sketches and is pleased but she can not stop thinking about Ridge guiding her hand and the kiss. Rick walks in and says his dad has made his decision on who will be CEO, him or Ridge. Maya speaks with Carter and says today is the day. She is sure Rick will win the job he has always wanted, being CEO. She is sure that Caroline and Ridge are involved and this will not bode well with him. Eric is distracted while talking to Hope but he says he has made his decision ..one will be very happy and the other disappointed. That comes with the territory of being in a family business. She agrees they need to get out there and precede any gossip to the press. Maya tells Carter that what she saw was not blown out of proposition and Rick will understand that when he hears. She tells Carter that she really wanted to marry him and it was not about money or bling that she wanted Rick. She had just ignored her heart for a while and the closer she got to her wedding date with Carter she knew she could not go through with it. Caroline tells Rick that he can always count on her. Her feet are firmly planted on the ground by his side and no one can change that. Katie feels all things are going well. Ridge will be named CEO and she will be by his side. Curiously she asks if Rick knows that Caroline has had a crush on Ridge. He's a very perceptive guy so he might have picked up on that. Ridge says that is in the past so there is nothing for him to pick up on. Hope tells Eric whatever decision he has made will be the right one. Eric tells Ivy that he hopes whichever son he doesn't pick will take it well. But they have not always gotten along so this might just add fuel to the fire. Maya can't wait to tell Carter that Caroline and Ridge have ended their collaboration. She thinks they are now running from each other. Sometimes emotional affairs are worse than physical ones. Caroline is making a fool of Rick and she is not going to let her get away with it. Carter tells her she is the one making a fool of herself. He can see that fevered little brain of hers working overtime. She says she knows what she saw and Rick and Katie deserve to know even if she has to call Caroline out in the meeting. Ridge spies Caroline kissing Rick. Rick says he has heard that Ridge's drawing skills have come back and things will be back to normal around here once Rick is CEO. Donna drops by on Katie and asks if she is nervous. After all, it will mean her seeing less of Ridge when he is CEO. Maya catches Rick and tells him big day and she is definitely Team Rick. Caroline walks up and Maya asks Caroline if she is Team Rick or Ridge, whatever he is to her. Eric conducts the meeting and says he is not going away, just stepping down and taking his brother's advice to get out and see the world. He will leave the company in their good hands and one of his sons will lead the company as CEO. He praises Ridge first as the best designer in the world and helped by Caroline. But Caroline's partner is her real life husband, Rick, and he's had international experience and he is very proud of him, he is proud of them both. Both of them are highly qualified and both gifted but one of them is going to be deeply disappointed. But he wants to see them as partners and brothers. He will have it no other way.
