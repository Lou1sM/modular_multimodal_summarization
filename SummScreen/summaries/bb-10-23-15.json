Julius asked what was wrong with him wanting to see his daughters. Rick said the last visit hadn't ended on a positive note.\n\n\nJulius wasn't proud to admit that it had taken time for him to change his mind, but he was there because he was ready to try to accept all of it. Maya replied that they'd heard it before. Julius knew that, but he meant it and planned to prove it to Nicole and Maya.\n\n\nZende decided to take off. Julius said when he'd last been there, he'd done what some would deem as making a fool of himself -- and on Maya's wedding day. Maya said he'd apologized already. He vowed to accept Maya and embrace all of it. Julius was proud to call Maya Mrs. Eric Forrester Jr.\n\n\nNicole asked if it was because the Forresters were rich. Julius asked his daughter not to exacerbate things, because he was already eating humble pie, apologizing, and asking for forgiveness. Maya stated that he'd said it before, and she didn't know how she could believe it that time.\n\n\nMaya asked if it was all Julius had arrived to say. Julius stated that there was more. Vivienne said she hadn't wanted to spring the news on their daughters in that way. Nicole asked what was happening, and Julius announced that he and Vivienne were getting a Los Angeles apartment.\n\n\nMaya said they couldn't do it, but Julius replied that it was done. The Avants had packed up and sold all their belongings in Chicago. Vivienne said they hadn't had much to get rid of. Julius gleefully announced that there were no more winters for them, and in L.A., he could play golf year-round. He looked forward to teaching Eric the patented Avant putt.\n\n\nMaya asked why her parents had done it without discussing it with their daughters. Rick said it was a big decision, and Nicole added that it was one that she and Maya should have been a part of. Julius encouraged Maya to give it a chance, saying that they'd all be one big happy family.\n\n\nVivienne said it would be great to be closer to them. Agreeing, Julius said their youngest was growing up fast and had a boyfriend. He liked Zende and was very excited about the move. Upset, Maya asked to talk to her mother and abruptly strode into the foyer. Vivienne followed.\n\n\nVivienne was apologetic. Maya said her mother was always welcome there. \"And your father?\" Vivienne asked. Maya said it wasn't a good idea. Vivienne relayed that she'd warned him. Maya asked if Julius meant any of what he was saying. Vivienne hoped so.\n\n\nJulius approached and asked what Maya had to say about the news. Maya responded that he wasn't the only one with news. Standing between the foyer and living room, she announced that she and Nicole were doing to something to bond the family.\n\n\nJulius thought it was wonderful and asked what it was. Rick said they were planning a family. Julius assumed they'd adopt, but Maya said they wanted a Forrester-Avant baby. Julius was confused about how it could be possible. \"Nicole,\" Maya responded.\n\n\nEnraged, Julius yelled, \"Wait a minute! You got together with your sister's husband!\" Rick quickly corrected Julius and said something like that would never happen. Nicole asked why Julius would even go there. Julius demanded that someone start explaining something, and they'd better do it quickly. \"We're gonna take Nicole's egg and Rick's sperm and put it in -- \" Maya said.\n\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa,\" Julius interrupted. Maya claimed it was a common procedure. Julius said that it might be in the warped world that Maya lived in, but he wouldn't let Nicole to do it. He said they could adopt. Vivienne told him to let Maya finish talking, but Julius refused to allow it.\n\n\nMaya said Julius had forgotten where he was -- the Forrester house, her house -- and he didn't get to tell them what to do. She claimed she and Rick wouldn't force Nicole into anything she didn't want to do. Julius said Maya had manipulated Nicole into madness. Maya said that the three of them had agreed, and Nicole would give Maya the greatest gift imaginable. \"Oh, no, she's not!\" Julius decreed.\n\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am,\" Nicole asserted.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Zende arrived to work out. Carter had been wondering when the \"lazy\" Zende would get there. Carter was impressed by Zende's press kit and urged him to show it to Ridge. Carter asked what Nicole had decided about the surrogacy, and Zende began hitting a punching bag.\n\n\nCarter urged Zende to talk about it. Zende grumbled that Nicole wanted to do it. Carter asked how Zende felt. Zende said it wasn't up to him, and they'd already started the process. Carter hoped that Rick and Maya weren't pressuring Nicole. Zende didn't think so. He said it was important to Nicole, who felt it was the right time to do it before she got older and wrapped up in her own life.\n\n\n \nZende loved Nicole, and all he could do was be supportive. He remarked upon her parents arriving in town, too. Carter was proud of Zende and said a lot of men wouldn't have the strength or patience to endure it. Zende wondered how Julius would react.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Ridge was dreading talking to \"Uncle Bill\" about the baby that day and suggested that they do a conference call or video chat. Caroline joked that \"someone\" really wasn't looking forward to it. Admitting that he wasn't, Ridge added that Bill didn't want them together and probably wouldn't react well about the baby. Caroline reasoned that, because Pam was telling everyone about the baby, Caroline wanted to announce it to her uncle and aunt before the press found out.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Katie and Bill arrived, and Pam asked if Katie had thought more about \"that double date.\" Katie hesitantly responded that costumes weren't her and Bill's thing, but maybe they'd do dinner instead. Bill looked annoyed as Charlie raved about Pam's cooking skills. Katie said Caroline wanted to see her and Bill. Grinning, Pam relayed that she could bet she knew why.\n\n\nKatie and Bill went into the office, and Bill asked if the big news was that the Forresters were getting divorced already. Caroline wished her aunt and uncle could be the first to know her news, but Pam was already announcing it around. Caroline revealed that she was pregnant, and the grimacing Bill put his hand over his face. \"You are telling me that you're having a kid with this clown?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nBill ranted that he'd always questioned Caroline's relationship \"with -- this --\" and would always be a doubting Thomas about it. Katie said it was a great thing, and some people would need time to warm up to it. Ridge was sure Bill would be okay by the high school graduation.\n\n\nBill asked how Steffy and Thomas felt about it. Caroline explained that Steffy wanted them to be happy. Ridge interjected that Steffy and Thomas knew how he felt about Caroline, the marriage, and their child. Bill guessed it was the part where he was supposed to say he was happy for them.\n\n\nBill didn't doubt Caroline would be a good mother, but he asserted that a baby would tie her to \"this clown\" for the rest of her days. Caroline said she was counting on it. Bill raged that Ridge was too old for her and certainly too old to have a baby with her. Ridge said it wasn't age; Bill just didn't like him.\n\n\nBill admitted that he didn't. Bill stated that Ridge had left every woman he'd been with and asked how they'd know that someone other than Ridge wouldn't raise the kid. Katie ordered them to put their differences on the shelf. Bill told Caroline that he'd never imagined her with the dressmaker -- or Rick, either. Ridge asked if Bill liked any Forrester man. \"Not particularly,\" Bill responded; however, if he'd had to pick one of them, he'd prefer Thomas.\n\n\nCharlie and Pam entered with a pink and blue batch of \"Ridge and Caroline are pregnant\" lemon bars. Caroline and Ridge thought it was sweet, but they said they wanted to keep it low-key \"So I really wish you would stop telling people,\" Caroline said in a non-offensive tone. Pam said she was sorry that she'd kind of spoiled the surprise, and Charlie said they were just very excited.\n\n\nKatie noted that people liked to wait until after the first trimester to announce. Pam asked how far along Caroline was. Ridge said it was a private matter, and they wanted to keep it that way. Pam said Ridge was totally right, and the only thing that mattered was that the couple had made a baby.\n\n\nThomas entered. Caroline asked what he was doing there. Thomas said he'd left suddenly, but he still had a thousand things left to do there. Ridge glared at his son, who asked what was happening. Pam said that the reason it was so \"hush-hush\" around there was because Caroline didn't really want anyone else to know, \"but heck, you're totally immediate family. You're about to have a little baby brother -- or a little baby sister -- because Carline is pregnant!\"\n\n\nCaroline's face blanched, and Ridge scowled.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Vivienne says she told Julius that he should have called first but he insisted on doing it in person. He says he admits it took time for him to come around but he means it this time and he will prove it. He and Vivienne desperately want to be in Maya's life so he will accept all of her. Caroline tells Ridge that everybody knows about her pregnancy thanks to Pam so she'd like to tell Bill and Katie before they hear it elsewhere. Pam says Charlie has a gun, so there is nothing Bill can do to him. Bill was hoping for a divorce from this clown so is aghast when Caroline tells him that she is pregnant. He says he will always be a doubting Thomas. First the marriage and now this! He needs a strong drink. Ridge says Bill will be all right by time of high school graduation. And Thomas and Steffy are okay with this. Bill laments that he knows she has always wanted a baby and she will be an exceptional mom but Ridge is too old to be having a baby. Katie tells him they all need to be positive because this is happening. Bill says he would stay away from the entire Forrester family but if he had to drink a poison he would much rather it be Thomas. Zende and Carter work out and Carter asks how it went with Nicole and the surrogacy news. Nicole says what everybody else is thinking. Julius changed his mind and is eating humble pie because the Forrester's are rich. Maya says he said that exact thing last time that he would try to accept her. Then he ran off on her wedding day. So how can she believe him now. He says one little change. This time he does mean it and he is backing it up with getting an apartment and they are moving to Los Angeles. He is tired of the snow shoveling so he is looking forward to playing golf every day .perhaps even with Eric. Rick says he hopes this works out but Nicole says he should have at least told them and not just sprung it on them. He tells Nicole he is excited about all of this. He even likes the young man who is her boyfriend. Maya tells both of them that he is not the only one with news. She has news of her own. She and Rick are going to start a family and they want it to be a Forrester/Avant baby, not adoption. Pam brings in a plate of half pink and half blue \"Caroline is Pregnant\" lemon bars. Katie plays it down but Pam can't keep her mouth shut and asks Caroline just how far along is she. Thomas walks in and Caroline questions why he is here. Again Pam can not shut her trap and she tells him that he is going to have a little baby brother or sister as Caroline is pregnant. Julius does not understand how this can be both a Forrester and Avant baby. Maya says simple, Rick will be the biological father. Julius jumps to conclusion that Nicole and Rick got together and that is sick. Maya says no, it will be Rick's sperm and Nicole's egg. Again Julius goes off the radar that will never happen, he will not allow it. Both Maya and Nicole say they have given this a lot of thought and yes it is going to happen. He is standing in a Forrester house now and has no say so in what Maya or Nicole does.",
