    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, an alarm sounded throughout the house. Mateo, sweaty in a half-unbuttoned shirt, rushed into the living room and asked Quinn what was going on. Quinn didn't think there was a fire because she didn't smell smoke. She couldn't shut off the alarm via the app, and all the staff and Eric were gone for the day. She asked if Mateo could manually shut it off, and he sprang into action, promising to take care of her.\n\n\nLater, the house was quiet again. Mateo set down a ladder and advised Quinn to have the alarm looked at. As he buttoned his shirt, he apologized for his appearance. He'd been overseeing the gardener with the sprinkler systems when she'd messaged him. He asked if he could help with anything else. There wasn't anything else she needed.\n\n\nQuinn remarked that she'd been about to take a nap. She hadn't been sleeping well because all she could think of was \"that cougar\" with her hands on Quinn's son. Mateo said she was getting worked up again and offered her a massage before her nap. She hesitated, and he apologized for being presumptuous. He just saw how tense and worried she was about her son.\n\n\nThanking Mateo, Quinn decided to go upstairs and lie down. Mateo asked her to remember that he was always at her service.\n\n\nAfter Quinn had gone upstairs, Mateo called Sheila. She was upset that Mateo wasn't keeping her posted. He claimed he'd been busy, and Sheila hoped it was with seducing Quinn. Mateo relayed that Quinn was upstairs, alone in her bedroom, and hadn't been sleeping well due to her upset about her son and Katie.\n\n\nSheila replied that Quinn was confiding in Mateo and instructed him to go upstairs and join Quinn. Mateo was unsure about it and didn't want to push. Sheila claimed to be paying him and ordered him to stop making excuses and get it done.\n\n\nMateo went upstairs and knocked on Quinn's bedroom door. He opened the door, and Quinn, who was sitting at the head of the bed, pulled the covers over her camisole. He was sorry to disturb her, but he wanted to check the alarm control panel in her closet. She said it was okay because she hadn't gotten comfortable yet. He told her that she wouldn't until she got rid of the tension with a massage. Quinn agreed and thanked him. He left to retrieve his table.\n\n\nLater, Mateo had set the massage table up at the foot of the bed, and Quinn lay beneath a sheet draped from her hips downward. Mateo massaged her upper back. His hand slipped beneath the sheet at the small of Quinn's back. Quickly, Quinn lifted her head and said the way he was touching her was very inappropriate. He asked if it felt good or if she wanted him to stop.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt worried about what was going on at Spencer. Katie said that Bill wasn't one to turn the other cheek. Wyatt had no idea how Bill had gotten his CEO seat back, but Wyatt doubted Bill would let Liam off the hook for blackmail. Wyatt contemplated going to Spencer.\n\n\nKatie reasoned that Bill might not react as she and Wyatt predicted. She wondered if it was too much to think Bill had learned something and that the situation had changed him  -- just a little bit. Wyatt wondered if Bill and Liam could rebound from the incident. Katie said she was proof that it could happen if they worked their way back to each other.\n\n\nWyatt assumed Katie was referring to her and Brooke. Katie said people probably thought she was crazy for wanting anything to do with her sister after what Brooke had done to Katie's marriage. Katie had gone through a period where she hadn't wanted anything to do with Brooke, but Katie loved her sister and didn't want to live her life in anger.\n\n\nKatie had made a deal with herself not to live with resentment. She hoped Liam and Bill would do the same. Wyatt feared that family might not win in the end, and Bill and Liam might not be able to get beyond it. Katie believed that was where Wyatt stepped in to help the men.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill wanted to reconcile with Liam. While speaking about his wrongs, Bill drifted to the topic of Liam's wrongs, and Steffy uttered, \"Bill...Bill...\" Bill wanted to use the situation to be better, more like Liam. Bill claimed that he wanted to be kinder and gentler. His bullheadedness had amassed him a fortune, but he'd lost his wife, son, and company in the process. Bill wanted his son back, and Liam said he wanted Bill back, too.\n\n\nBill asked if Liam meant it and would be Bill's son again. Liam replied that he'd never not been, and being a Spencer would never change for Liam. Agreeing, Bill said they were family and shouldn't be at war. The men agreed not to go to war again. Bill believed that the strong-willed men might bump heads, but if they had a disagreement, they'd choose to channel it toward the betterment of the company and their relationship.\n\n\nLiam was surprised that Bill hadn't charged in there, kicked Liam to the curb, destroyed Liam's life, and vowed to never speak to Liam again. Bill replied that it had been tempting. He hadn't done it because of Steffy, who'd made him realize what he'd be doing by going after Liam. Bill said it would have torn the family apart, and he'd always be grateful to Steffy for that.\n\n\nLiam said he would, too, and Bill asked for a fresh start. He asked if Liam would do him the honor of staying on as his right-hand man. Bill admitted that he'd resented Liam and had probably felt toward Liam the same way Liam's grandfather had felt toward Bill at times. It had taken Steffy to help Bill see what he was doing and realize that they could get through their differences if they remembered the love and ties that bound them as Spencers.\n\n\nBill appreciated who Liam was and said that some of Liam's compassion and sense of right and wrong could rub off on him if Liam helped him. Liam conceded that he could be self-righteous at times. \"I hadn't noticed,\" Bill replied, and Steffy joked that she hadn't, either. Liam said the humanity hadn't been what he'd expected, and he'd only seen Bill as a corrupt, narcissistic man.\n\n\nBill replied that he was all those things, but he'd work on himself. Liam hadn't believed Bill at first, but Liam could see at that point that Bill wanted to make amends. Liam said that he believed Bill, and Liam was sorry. The men hugged.\n\n\nBill and Liam attributed the reconciliation to Steffy. Steffy said she'd kept pushing, but she hadn't been sure it would happen at times. Steffy said Bill had been wrong, but he'd offered healing. She was glad that Liam had seen it was wrong to sentence Bill to a life without his company. Liam said he hadn't wanted to be at odds with Bill, but Liam had gotten carried away with crusading for the right thing no matter the cost, the relationship with his father \"be damned.\"\n\n\nLiam said Steffy hadn't given up on Liam and Bill. Bill added that she hadn't given up on the father and son relationship, and it had made the difference; she'd made the difference.\n\n\nJust then, Wyatt arrived. He asked if everything was okay in there. Liam said it was, and their dad had forgiven him. Bill stated that they'd forgiven each other. Wyatt was surprised there had been no retribution or bloodshed, and Bill was letting Liam off free. Bill reminded Wyatt that Bill wanted to run the company with both of his sons.\n\n\nBill said everyone knew Liam could be annoying, but Bill could be worse on his opposite end of the spectrum. The men had forgiven each other, and Bill would get Brooke to forgive him, too. He refused to lose Brooke to the poser. Steffy said she was staying out of that one.\n\n\nWyatt couldn't believe it, but at the risk of putting turmoil in the middle of goodwill, Wyatt wanted to know what they'd do about all the changes Liam had made. Liam said the changes were making a big difference in the lives of the employees. Bill said he'd review them with an open mind soon. Liam said he hadn't wanted Bill back because he hadn't thought the three men could work together or that \"this\" could happen.\n\n\nLiam said he'd underestimated Bill. Liam joked that he'd still harass Bill about changing his ways. Bill wanted Liam to. Bill said Liam would do something else for Bill, which was to treat Steffy like the extraordinary woman she was. Bill felt that she'd pulled them from the brink, and they owed her tremendous gratitude. Bill planned to go after Liam if he messed up with Steffy.\n\n\nLiam promised not to mess up or take her for granted. He said it went for his relationship with Bill, too. Liam enjoyed not being at odds with Bill and wanted to keep it that way. Bill exclaimed that the Spencers were back; it was Spencers 2.0, and they were going to burn the house down.\n\n\n\"No! No, no!\" Wyatt and Liam quickly said, and all three men began speaking at once about the use of Bill's phrase. Steffy smiled, watching the men.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill hugs Liam and says he is a father and he is supposed to lead by example. But Liam was wrong too in blackmailing him and yet he wants to use this as an opportunity. His stubbornness has made him wealthy but he has lost his family, his company and his wife and he wants them all back. Liam states he wants that too. Bill says he knows they are both strong willed and they will be butting heads but he thinks they can work through that. Liam is surprised now that Bill is back in charge he could have bulldozed himself in here and thrown Liam to the curb. Instead Bill is now standing there and says they owe it all to Steffy and he even wants to name Liam as his right hand man. Bill realizes now he was acting just like his own father did whenever Bill did just about anything. Maybe Liam's sense of right and wrong will rub off on him now with him being at his side. Liam says again this was the last thing he expected when Bill walked in. But he can see these are not words; that he really means them and he forgives him .and he is sorry too. They hug. Strange alarms start going off at the Forrester's and Quinn begs Mateo to please find out what is wrong and shut it off. He manages to shut it down. He asks if there is anymore he can do. She says no; she was just going to take a nap. He suggests a massage first. She declines and he says he is always at her service; she just needs to say the word. Sheila thinks back to what she said to Mateo that he would be paid off handsomely. He calls Sheila and she chides him for not doing more. If Quinn is in her bedroom, then go join her. Do it now. Katie tells Wyatt that she made a pact with herself a long time ago that she will not live with resentment. She could not forgive her sister for a long time but she has now. He should do the same with his father and brother. On some pretence, Mateo knocks on Quinn's door and she tells him she cannot get comfortable. He says she won't until she rids herself of that tension. They end up agreeing to her having another massage. He will go get the table to do it right there in her bedroom. Soon she tells him that he is touching her inappropriately. He asks if she wants him to stop. As Wyatt walks in, Bill tells Steffy that she made the difference. Liam says they both forgave each other so all is okay now. Wyatt is surprised there was no bloodshed. Bill says it was that simple, they both forgave each other. Now the only other thing that matters is that Brooke forgives him. Wyatt says now with all this good will he wonders how this will affect a lot of the changes Liam made. Liam says they did so much good and he would hate to see that go. Bill says he will take each and every one into consideration. Bill tells Liam that Steffy is the one who brought them back from the brink and he wants Liam to treat her like the treasure that she is or he is coming after him. He joins his two sons besides him and says they are going to burn the place down now ..well poor choice of words but they are going to be a force to reckon with.",
