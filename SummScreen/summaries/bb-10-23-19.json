    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy's at work and Ridge shows her Thomas's designs. She thinks not bad. He says a compliment from her would mean the world to Thomas. She says she cannot just forgive him like that for what he did. He says the same old; they are family and it is not easy but necessary. She says Thomas uses people and he uses his own son too. He says he is happy to see her working but it should be with her brother too. She tells him that Hope was way out of line and she has no business dictating who will raise Douglas. She's not even blood kin. He tells her he moved out of Brooke's so he could be closer to her and to Thomas. She reminds him not to wreck his marriage. He says he knows he and Brooke are on opposite sides of the fence. She says and if Brooke talks Thomas into letting go of Douglas then there are going to be many more rough days ahead. Thomas tells Brooke that she wants him to give away his son; he is not going to sign over his son. Hope wants to talk to Thomas alone. Brooke does not agree but gives in and says she will be right up the hill. Liam is not happy to hear that Hope is alone with Thomas. Brooke tells Liam that he needs to speak up if there is any chance they can get Douglas. Thomas tells Hope that hurting her is the biggest regret of his life. He's not used to rejection and it threw him a little when he knew she did not want him. He was too stubborn to admit it and he was ashamed. And letting Douglas stay with her does not mean he does not love his son. He would only sign those papers for Hope. He lost his way but he has been trying to better himself. If he cannot have that life with Hope then maybe Douglas still can. She reminds him that he wanted her to be Douglas's mother. So she begs him to sign the papers and let her and Liam have him permanently. She just wants to give him all the love and support that he wanted. If Thomas wants to make up to her for what he did then sign these papers. Liam is not against Douglas; he likes the little boy a lot. Brooke says this is the way it has to be. Thomas could snap at any time. Hope continues to beg, she loves Douglas and she can be his mother. That is what she wants. Thomas says he made decisions that he cannot justify but he never meant to hurt her or Douglas. She says Douglas needs this security and only Thomas can make that happen. He says he is confused. He needs to think. She sees this as a good sign and tells him to think seriously. He zooms in on her lips, then her eyes and how she drives him insane and gets to him. Hope is still talking about him signing the adoption papers and he says he will seriously consider it. He opines for what it is worth he lays awake at night thinking of the things he did wrong. He is sorry for what he did to her and he will spend the rest of his life proving how much he cares about her and can win her trust. They both look at each other like they have different agendas in mind.",
