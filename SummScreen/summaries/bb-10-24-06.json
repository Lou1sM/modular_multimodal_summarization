Nicke's dinner invitation from Brooke starts with an exchange of reproaches and mistrust, then prime demand for a make-up: respect. Ridge and Stefanie give Jackie a cold reception, after he leaves a brutal confrontation.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Stephanie agrees with Ridge that all Taylor needed was permission from Thorne to fight. She's glad that Ridge is going to move back into the house. She also thinks it's over for Nick, and Ridge and Brooke will have smooth sailing. Nick joins Brooke at a fancy restaurant. She didn't trust herself that she'd be able to say the things she needed to say to him alone. Bridget assures Eric that she will be able to handle Felicia when she tells her about the baby being Dante's. Jackie takes delight in telling Ridge that if it weren't for him moving out on his wife in the first place and pursuing Brooke, none of this might have happened. He too takes pride in telling her that he doesn't think her little Nicky is going to hear good news tonight with Brooke. Nick and Brooke end up politely arguing and she twists the knife by reminding him that he slept with her daughter and where his loyalty must lie. She also points out that he's rough with her at times. And he raises his voice when he doesn't have to and has the infuriating habit of running off to his boat and distancing himself emotionally. And if they are going to even try and save their marriage, she needs one thing from him \u0096 respect. Silence falls over the entire room as Bridget tells Felicia and Dante that the baby is his. Stephanie takes exception to Jackie telling Ridge how to conduct his life. And how would Nicky know right from wrong when he was raised by trash like Jackie? They trade barbs until it gets out of hand and Stephanie slaps her when Jackie dares suggest that Stephanie can fantasize about Ridge making love to her. Brooke leaves Nick speechless as she leaves and nothing seems to have been settled. She just said what she had to say. He follows her and says despite the fact that he was quite contented before they married, he doesn't want to go back to that life. He wants to come back home with her tonight.",

He then kisses her and the two leave the restaurant together for the first time since they met at the beginning of the year.\n"
