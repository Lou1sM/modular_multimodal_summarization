    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells the group that he thought they were going to be civil about this and give Thomas time and support him until he gets back on his feet. Brooke counters with and who is going to care for his son while he does this. Thomas says he has been struggling ever since Caroline died but this is his son and he is not ready to give him up. He won't be signing the papers. Liam jumps in and tells Ridge to put the custody aside for now as this is where Douglas wants to be and feels safe. Ridge understands but says they are taking Douglas now. Brooke gets more forceful and says that Douglas is thriving here with Hope and Liam and NO one is going to take him away from that. They argue more but in the end Ridge points at Brooke and Hope and says they are not the parents, Thomas is and he is trying his best. He is getting help but refuses to say what when Brooke asks. Surely hanging out with Vinny is not helping matters. Ridge tells Hope that if Thomas needs help then he can call on her but he will be taking Douglas home with him. Ridge reminds her that this is much like when she got Beth back. She went into Steffy's house and took Beth. Ridge did not like that and Steffy did not like that either but she had every right to take her and now like Thomas deserves his son.

Thomas pulls back and reminds Brooke what happened the last time she pushed him. She and Ridge get into it again about the Forrester's. She knows he does not think of her as a Forrester despite that she is his wife. He thinks of her as a Logan. She can see it in his eyes and is channeling Stephanie now so he might as well say it and call her the slut from the valley and not worthy of raising a Forrester. Thomas does meet Douglas and both are happy to see each other. Thomas tells him the good news that they will be living together soon. Thomas says Hope and Liam have done a great job taking care of him but now it is time for Douglas to live with him. He is going to prove to him that he can trust him and he is not mad at him. Douglas hugs him and says he has missed him. Thomas says he was wrong to keep Beth's secret but he is going to be the daddy now that Douglas needs him to be. Douglas hugs his dad again. Ridge tells Brooke that she is wrong. This is not Logan's against Forrester's. Hope adds that Douglas is here right where he wants to be.

Liam jumps in and says he knows they are frustrated and Ridge's son messed up and he is trying to get him back on the path of redemption but forcing Douglas back with him is not going to do that. Brooke breaks it up by saying if he lets Thomas walk out of here with Douglas Ridge asks yes, what will she do. She says she has tried over and over to be patient and Ridge says he will get Thomas help but he has not done that. Thomas is sick and needs some serious help.
