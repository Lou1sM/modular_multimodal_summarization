Ridge and Brooke shared a moment as Brooke came down the stairs. Ridge told Brooke how much he had looked forward to her decision to come back to him. Just then, Nick walked in and Ridge asked what he was doing there. Brooke demanded that Ridge and Nick learn to find common ground and get along for Hope and R.J.'s sake. She told both of them what they meant to her, and how difficult the decision was for her to make. \n\n\nStephanie asked Hope and R.J. to make a birthday card for their sister Phoebe's upcoming 18th birthday. While at Stephanie's, Donna asked questions about whether she knew anything about Brooke's choice. Stephanie said it was obvious who Brooke was going to choose, and the Donna had no chance to be with Ridge. \n\n\nAs Nick prepared to go to Brooke's, he serenaded Jackie with a song that he wrote for her and told her not to worry about Brooke's decision. Jackie was very upset about Stephanie's overwhelming influence on Brooke. Jackie showed up unannounced at Stephanie's telling her to back off. As the disagreement heated up, Donna decided to take Hope and R.J. for ice cream. When she went back to ask Jackie to move her car, she saw Jackie follow Stephanie up the stairs and the fight got more intense.

Brooke tells both of them that she has made up her mind on what she is going to do. Stephanie learns that Ridge has been invited over by Brooke and is thrilled, as is Jackie when she learns that Brooke has invited Nick over. Donna questions Brooke on what she has decided but she refuses to say anything. Stephanie asks Donna to bring the children over for a visit. Nick and Ridge are both surprised to discover the other has been invited over by Brooke. They begin making harsh comments to one another and Brooke orders them to find some common ground. Jackie arrives at Stephanie's to hurl some more abuse. The two go at it over Brooke and their sons. During a scuffle on the stairs, Stephanie pushes Jackie away and she falls over the railing to the floor below as Donna watches through the window.\r\n",

Nick tells Jackie that Brooke has invited him over and Jackie is sure this means that Brooke has picked a future with Nick. Stephanie tries to convince Brooke be with Ridge. Ridge and Stephanie are convinced Brooke is going to pick a future with Ridge because she has invited him over. Stephanie tells Donna that Brooke and Ridge are getting back together. Stephanie and Jackie argue over who Brooke is going to choose. The argument comes to blows upstairs in the Forrester house and Stephanie pushes Jackie away from her causing Jackie to lose her footing and fall over the banister. Donna sees Jackie land hard on the marble floor from outside on the terrace. Ridge and Nick both arrive at Brooke\u2019s house and argue over who she will choose.

    "imdb": "\nEveryone is on tenterhooks waiting for the decision between Ridge and Nick. Brooke refuses to be influenced or give a hint. Only Stephanie acts confident, but an escalating argument with Jacqueline gets physical, causing a terrible fall. The contenders promise winner and visiting loser will behave with the kids.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells his mother she doesn't have to promote his cause with Brooke, she's made up her mind and he'll find out tonight. Stephanie is confident this means good news. Jackie calls Brooke and is informed of the same. She is ecstatic for Nicky as she assumes he will be Brooke's choice. Donna also finds out from Brooke that she's made her decision and she'll be having a talk with the children. Brooke does tell them things will be better now, but stops short of giving them any details. This irks Donna who thinks this decision affects her as well. Brooke is sorry that Donna put herself in that position and says she doesn't want her to be hurt. Both men arrive within minutes of each other and wonder what the other is doing there? Ridge goes so far to want to un- invite Nick. Brooke makes them behave while they try to find a common ground. She can't be a ping pong ball going back and forth between the two of them. She can't be with both, but hopefully this will work out for all of them. Jackie drops in unannounced to Stephanie's to gloat about Nicky returning home to Brooke. Stephanie takes offense to this and declares Jackie delusional. Donna has brought the kids over to see Stephanie, but sees a nasty brawl a'brewing and whisks them out and puts them in the car. She has to return to get Jackie to move her car and is looking in through the glass door when she spots Jackie arguing with Stephanie at the top of the stairs. Stephanie told Jackie to leave and headed up to the bedroom but Jackie followed and continued provoking her. Her hands were all over her, in her face, spouting her rhetoric. Stephanie defends by warning her and then pushing her off of her and Jackie literally flies over the railing and splats on the marble below. Both Donna and Stephanie are aghast.",
