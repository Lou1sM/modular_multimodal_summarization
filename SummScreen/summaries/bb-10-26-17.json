    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Quinn ordered Sheila out of the house. Sheila asked Eric to say something. Just then, Mateo entered the living room. Relieved, Sheila implored Mateo to tell Eric how Mrs. Forrester had been inappropriate and had crossed the line. Mateo said nothing, and Sheila yelled at him to tell the truth.\n\n\nMateo yelled back that he'd already told the truth, which was that Sheila had paid him to try to entice Quinn into an affair. Sheila pretended not to know what he was talking about. To Eric, Mateo apologized and said he shouldn't have agreed to it. Asserting that Mateo was lying to keep his job, Sheila insisted that he'd said that he and Quinn had been intimate with each other.\n\n\nQuinn stated that she'd told Mateo to say it; however, it hadn't happened, and she and Mateo would never cross the line. Quinn added that Sheila had thought she'd played Quinn, but Sheila was the one who'd gotten played.\n\n\nSheila quickly deduced that Eric had been playing her, too. Sheila remarked upon Eric leading her on and putting the portrait on the wall. Eric said he'd had to get through to her, and having her drag the portrait over there had been the best way to do it.  She replied that he'd tricked her.\n\n\nEric asked how it felt. He couldn't believe Sheila had devised such a plan utilizing Mateo. Sheila said she'd wanted Eric to see what Quinn was capable of. He asked if Sheila had really believed it would work and that he'd leave his wife. He declared that he was more in love with Quinn than he had ever been with any other woman in his life.\n\n\nEric didn't believe Sheila had changed one bit from her old-school ways. Sheila claimed that she'd been worried about Eric. As she spoke, Eric interrupted, saying he wanted Sheila out of his life and his house. With his arm around Quinn, he said \"this\" was Mrs. Eric Forrester, someone Sheila never again would be.\n\n\nQuinn told Sheila that Quinn would never hurt Eric in the manner Sheila had set up for Quinn, but Sheila said Quinn already had with Eric's own son. Eric said it was enough. Sheila didn't want him to look over his shoulder for the rest of his life. Eric was livid that Sheila had set it in motion and dragged Mateo into it.\n\n\nMateo apologized again to Eric and asked forgiveness. Mateo believed he should have known better. He cared for the family and didn't want to lose his job. Eric replied that he'd let his wife decide. Mateo apologized to Quinn, and Quinn told Sheila that Mateo showed real regret.\n\n\nQuinn told Mateo that she would think about it. Eric said that was all for Mateo, but Eric wanted Mateo to return in a short while to help put Quinn's portrait back where it belonged.\n\n\nAfter Mateo had exited, Sheila apologized to Eric for the mistakes she'd made but insisted she'd only been looking out for his best interest. Eric felt that he'd given her chances, but she'd let him down every time. He believed she was the same person she'd always been.\n\n\nSheila denied it, but Quinn said the ready-made portrait proved that psycho Sheila had been planning it all along. Sheila kept denying it, but Quinn insisted that Sheila had been trying to get rid of Quinn the whole time. Eric said Quinn was his wife, and that fact wouldn't change. Eric wanted Sheila out of his life and for her to leave immediately.\n\n\nSheila tried to explain that she'd only had Eric's best interests at heart, and Quinn had proven Sheila wrong. Quinn told Sheila to stop pretending that she knew Quinn, because Sheila didn't know the first thing about Quinn or Quinn's feelings for Eric. Agreeing, Sheila said she'd been wrong, and she was working on herself.\n\n\nQuinn didn't care about Sheila's excuses and was sick of hearing them. Quinn wanted Sheila to leave and never return. Sheila asked to speak to Eric alone. Quinn couldn't believe Sheila's nerve to ask, but Sheila asked Eric for one last time to be alone. Eric agreed. Quinn objected, but he said his eyes were wide open. He kissed Quinn's forehead, and Quinn left.\n\n\nSheila told Eric that Quinn had passed the tests. Eric replied that Sheila had failed. Sheila stated that Quinn was the better woman. Ashamed of her despicable actions, Sheila didn't think she could apologize enough. She just wanted him to know that the relationship they'd been building had meant a lot to her, and she'd been hoping to be part of the family.\n\n\nEric reminded Sheila that she had once been in the family. She believed it had been the best time in her life, but she'd acted shamefully. She said she'd done it again, but she was working on it. She'd traveled to Los Angeles to tell him that she loved him. She'd been hoping for his forgiveness. She hadn't known that upon returning, she'd get arrested for shooting at Quinn.\n\n\nSheila recalled that Eric had stood by her.  She believed that his family had been pretty \"brutal on\" her, but she understood and probably deserved it.  Spending time with him that day had reminded her of what a wonderful man he was. She said that Quinn might deserve to be with him, and he deserved the best.\n\n\nThough she knew it was silly to say, Sheila still hoped to be a part of the Forrester family. She realized it might not happen, but she said a girl could dream. Eric advised her to let that dream go and to move on with her life. He apologized for being blunt, but he didn't think she should do it in Los Angeles.\n\n\nSheila appreciated Eric's honesty and compassion, but she wasn't ready to let Eric out of her heart. \"Because it's all I have,\" she said. \"This fantasy, this hopefulness, every time I see you. Every time that we talk,\" she added.\n\n\nEric just stared in response. Sheila relayed that she'd commissioned the portrait, hoping that it would one day hang in Eric's house, but she'd realized that the circumstances were all wrong. She understood that it meant nothing to him, but it meant everything for her. He started to speak, but she asked him not to.\n\n\nSheila planned to always cherish the thought of her and Eric. She said, even with her shortcomings, a part of him still found her fascinating. And that would have to be enough for her \"for now.\" She decided she had to get going, but she uttered, \"I'm going to miss you, my husband.\" Eric tilted his head, and she added, \"My ex-husband.\"\n\n\nSheila silently strode out the door. On the stoop, she touched the lion head door knocker. When she turned to leave, she jumped with a start because Quinn was staring at her. Quinn told Sheila to get off Quinn's property. Quinn asserted that Sheila would never be a Forrester, and Quinn never wanted to see Sheila's face again.\n\n\n\"Goodbye forever,\" Quinn said and strode into the house. Sheila turned to face the camera and chuckled.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Wyatt told Katie about his talk with Quinn. Katie was glad that he'd talked to his mother, but she didn't hold out for Quinn to support the relationship. Wyatt replied that Katie didn't need to worry because Quinn had someone else on her radar at the time -- Sheila, who, instead of leaving town, was trying to pose a threat to Quinn's marriage.\n\n\nLater, Katie was commenting on how insane it was that Sheila had set Quinn up. Enthralled by the idea that the estate manager was a masseur, Katie decided she needed to get herself one. Wyatt said that she had him, and he was free. On that note, Katie was ready to stop talking, and the two kissed their way upstairs.\n\n\nLater, Katie was in the bathroom. Wyatt sat on the bed, talking to her through the door about what had happened at the office with Liam and Bill. Wyatt guessed they were all a family again, but he didn't know what his position would be with Liam back. Wyatt's phone chimed, and as he read it, he told Katie that Bill had called a meeting for that afternoon.\n\n\nExiting the bathroom in heels and purple lingerie, Katie said, \"First things first.\" She took off Wyatt's shirt, and they began making out.\n\n\nAfter having sex, Katie and Wyatt canoodled in bed. He didn't want to leave, but he had to go to the meeting. Katie suggested he return to her house later. Agreeing, he said there was no place he'd rather be than there.\n\n\n",

Sheila begs Eric to say something .tell Quinn that he knows about the affair with Mateo. Then Mateo walks in and Sheila asks him to tell them what he did. He says yes he told the truth. He was wrong to accept Sheila's offer and he is sorry. He told Quinn and Eric the truth. Quinn smirks at Sheila and says this time she is the one who was played. Sheila turns on Eric that he came up with this plan when she thought they were planning a future together. Eric says it is true that Sheila has never changed. He wants her out of his life and out of his house. As he puts his arms about Quinn, he says this is Mrs. Forrester. Wyatt explains to Katie that Sheila did not leave town and is after Eric for her husband. Katie kids that she needs to get her one of those masseurs. Then she comes out of the room dressed in just sexy bra and panties. Wyatt says his dad can wait for him to come back to the office. Eric berates Sheila for coming up with this plan and then even dragging Mateo into it. Mateo apologizes and says he does not want to lose his job. Eric tells Mateo to come back later as he wants him to take Sheila's portrait down and put Quinn's back up. Eric tells Sheila that he has given her chance after chance but she has not changed at all. She is still the devious person she was years ago. Quinn says she knows she has been trying to get her from the day she came to town. Eric says again she is the same person and he wants her out of his life immediately. Quinn chimes in and says yes it is time for Sheila to leave. She is sick and demented. Sheila has the nerve to ask Eric if she can have one last moment alone with him. He finally agrees. Sheila says she put Quinn to the test and she passed. She is a better woman than she is and now she wishes them all the best of happiness. She is ashamed of herself; she knows she screwed up. Their relationship meant a lot to her. He is an incredible man. His family, the Forrester family, she was just hoping she could be part of that. She came to L.A. to tell him that she loved him and she was hoping he could forgive her for her past. She never would have been caught up in trying to shoot at his wife and yet Eric stood by her and she appreciates him. And now spending this time with him she is honored. He deserves the best. She realizes she probably will never be part of his family again but that is what she is hoping for. He says she needs to let go of that dream as it is not going to happen. She says she commissioned that portrait but she realizes now the circumstances were all wrong. It meant nothing to him but for her it meant something. She is not ready to let him out of her heart and she knows somewhere he still finds her fascinating. So for now that will have to be enough. She is going to miss him .her ex-husband. She leaves and outside takes one more look back at the door. When she turns around there is Quinn face to face. She tells Sheila she never wants to see her face again. Get off her property. This is goodbye. When Quinn goes inside, Sheila lets out that gutty guttural laugh. All she needs is a jack-o-lantern in hand.",
