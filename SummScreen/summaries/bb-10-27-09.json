A reporter asked if she could get a statement from the new CEO. Katie entered almost on cue to applause. Bill greeted her with a kiss. One of the reporters asked if Katie and Bill had set a wedding date, and Bill responded, \"The sooner, the better.\" Katie smiled. Bill announced that there would be a new Royalty photo shoot, and he invited the media to stay for it.\n\n\nA reporter asked how Katie's sisters felt about her promotion, and Katie suggested that they ask her sisters, who had just entered. Brooke said that she was confident that Katie would retain the company's creative integrity and be a great leader. She added that Katie had their full support. A reporter asked why Eric and Ridge were not in attendance, and Bill interrupted. He said that Ridge's designs would speak for him. He added that the Logan sisters would have a greater role in Forrester. He praised the creativity of the Forresters and all the talented employees, and added that he was thrilled to have Eric and Ridge on-board.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Taylor entered and remarked that an entire sea of media had descended on the building. Ridge lamented to Taylor that Bill had flown in international media for the day. Ridge said that it was difficult to accept that Katie had the job that he had expected would belong to him. Taylor told him that she knew he had been prepared to take the lead at Forrester.  Ridge said that he was glad his mother had joined Jackie M, because he was convinced it would have broken her heart to see Bill's takeover at Forreste r. \n\n\n Thomas and Steffy entered and told their dad that he had their support. Thomas noted that he knew Ridge was staying to protect the family's legacy.  Thomas didn't understand how Katie had become the CEO. Ridge agreed, but he added that he hoped Katie would be good for the company. Taylor wondered if Katie would appoint Ridge as company president, but Ridge admitted that he was not sure of anything anymore.\n\n\nRocco entered and announced that a new Royalty photo shoot was taking place. He wondered if Ridge would join the shoot, but Ridge declined. Taylor was surprised that Brooke and Donna supported the takeover, and Ridge said that they had to support it. Everyone had to support it because Bill had bankrolled Forrester. Ridge lamented that he should have fought harder to keep the company financially independent, but he didn't know what to do.  Thomas and Steffy agreed that it was unfair that Ridge was not appointed CEO. Taylor whined that Katie had taken his place. Ridge said that no one would take away the kids' birthright to the company.\n\n\nBill greeted Stephen and Beth and thanked them for attending the media day he had scheduled. Stephen was impressed and Beth smiled. Bill told them that Katie had taken his breath away, and he couldn't wait to marry her. The Logan girls prepared for their fashion shoot for the Royalty campaign. They returned to the room in stunning gowns to applause from the media. Katie and Donna flanked Brooke as the photographer started shooting, but Bill interrupted and moved Katie to the front and center pushing Donna and Brooke to the sides behind Katie. As Katie moved into position, Bill gently placed a tiara upon her head to the applause of the media.\n\n\nWhile the photo shoot continued, Justin entered and found Marcus in the crowd. Marcus reminded Justin that Forrester was a family-owned company and the family had done a good job in the past. Marcus hoped that Forrester could retain its status as a family-run company. Justin said that he knew where Marcus was coming from. He and Marcus agreed that Donna looked like a beautiful queen. As the photographers flashed pictures, Justin remembered his senior prom when Donna was named prom queen. He had kissed her, and he smiled as he recalled Donna hugging him and telling him how happy she was. \n\n\nJustin asked his son if they still had a lunch date, and Marcus agreed. The shoot went well, with everyone admiring the Logan girls' dresses. The photographer said that it was a wrap. Bill gazed lovingly at Katie and she returned the same gaze. Bill thanked the crowd, and Brooke thanked Ridge and Eric for creating the gowns that had made all of them look so beautiful.\n\n\nKatie was surprised that her parents were in the room, and quickly greeted them with hugs and kisses. Stephen said that Bill had invited them to visit so that they could share in Katie's proud moment. Beth said that seeing her daughters looking so beautiful in a photo shoot was something that she hoped she would never forget. Katie changed back into her business suit and Bill and Katie made out. \n\n\nBill told her that he had something to show her. He took her outside for some fresh air. As they looked up, Bill pointed to a new sign on the Forrester building. It sported the Forrester Creations logo with the addition of a line that said it was a division of Spencer Publications. Bill smiled and kissed Katie.\n\n\nBackstage, Justin greeted Donna and told her that she looked beautiful. He said that watching her during the photo shoot brought back memories of their prom when she was crowned prom queen. They smiled and recalled good times together. Justin said that he wanted to get to know the girl that he had missed for decades. Donna suggested that they needed to leave those years in the past. She said that their lives had taken different turns.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Brooke comforted Ridge while he was sulking. Ridge commented that Brooke was the beautiful distraction that he needed. Brooke apologized for participating in the photo shoot, but acknowledged that they didn't have much choice. Ridge said that he wasn't sure that he could work for Bill Spencer or Katie, and Brooke hugged him.  She begged him not to let Katie's appointment as CEO drive a wedge between them. \n\n\nRidge said that it was wrong that Katie had moved into Eric's office. He held up a notepad and moaned that Bill Spencer had branded everything with an FC logo and an additional line that it was a division of Spencer Publications. Brooke encouraged Ridge to design. He said that he wasn't sure that he could stay, because he felt like he was dead inside.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "It's a feeding frenzy and the reporters hound Katie about her wedding day. Bill wants it to be as soon as possible. Brooke is asked about the transition and she gives the typical statement that she supports her sister all the way. Bill assures them that both Donna and Brooke will play a bigger role; he has expanded the Royalty line. And he's happy to still have Eric and Ridge on board. Ridge grouses to Taylor that Bill owns them now, but this was the only way to keep the company afloat. Rocco invites Ridge to the shooting of the Royalty line, but he passes. Steffy and Thomas tell Ridge they understand why he had to accept what happened and it will affect all of them. Bill explains to Katie's parents, Stephen and Beth, that this was a sudden engagement, but they can blame it on Katie; she took his breath away. Justin slips up and calls Marcus son, but Marcus says it's cool. He just wants to remind him this is a family business. Stephen explains to Donna that her mom has good days and bad ones, but today is a good one. Justin tells Donna that the shoot took him back to when she was the Homecoming Queen. He felt like he lost something precious that night, but now he has some of it back. She tells him they are leading different lives now and they have to leave the past alone. Ridge assures Steffy and Thomas that the company is their birthright and Bill Spencer will not take that away from them. He can't design though and feels like he is sinking. Brooke apologizes but says she had to do the Royalty line otherwise it would have made her sister look bad on her first day with reporters around. He admits he is not sure he can work for Katie and Bill. It's wrong the way Katie has moved into Eric's office. He doesn't want to speak ill of her, but it feels like she has stabbed them in the back. Eric won't even come to the office. Brooke tries to soothe him; she doesn't want to lose him again. She begs him to design his heart out, but hang in there. It is for their future, their family. Bill whisks Katie away and takes her outside for a surprise \u0096 new logo for the buildings that says Forrester Creation, a division of Spencer Publications.",
