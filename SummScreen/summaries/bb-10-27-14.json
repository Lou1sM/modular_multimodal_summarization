    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Caroline was sobbing, but Ridge told everyone that Maya had made a big deal over nothing. He insisted that it merely had been two people working, and he asked if Maya had followed him and Caroline to Brooke's cabin. Tears and mascara streamed down Caroline's face as she told Rick that she'd just gotten caught up in the moment, and it had been just a few kisses.\n\n\n\"You're a married woman. I can't believe this!\" Hope exclaimed, leaving the room. Ivy strode out, too. Rick asked how long it had been going on, but Caroline continued to cry. Maya said she'd tried to warn Rick, and Carter told Maya that they didn't belong there.\n\n\nCarter prodded Maya to leave, but she wouldn't budge. Carter asserted that they all knew why Maya was really doing it. Maya claimed that it was because she cared, but Ridge retorted that her agenda was showing. Carter exited, and Rick bitterly said he didn't give a \"damn\" about any of them.\n\n\nEric began to berate Ridge, and Rick turned to leave. Caroline wanted to go with him, but Maya shouted that Caroline had done enough. Caroline told Rick that she and Ridge had done some foolish things, but that had been the end of it. \"No, Caroline, this is the end of it,\" Rick said.\n\n\nGrabbing Rick's arm as he retreated, Caroline begged everyone to give her and Rick a moment alone. Rick felt that they'd already been humiliated enough. He roared that Eric's big buildup had been a bunch of theatrics. Rick wondered why he'd fallen for it.\n\n\nSobbing, Rick said he'd actually believed that for once, his hard work and ambition would pay off, but in reality, Eric always chose \"the anointed one.\" Eric tried to defend his decision, but Rick didn't want to hear excuses from the man who always seemed to say the right words.\n\n\nRick just wanted to know if Eric's choice was out of loyalty to Stephanie to select her son over his own blood relation, or if Eric was too ashamed of the second family he'd formed with a woman he'd shared with Ridge. Rick asked if he was still a little boy to Eric, and Ridge asked if Rick thought their father didn't think Rick was good enough. Rick retorted that Eric wasn't Ridge's father.\n\n\nRidge rolled his eyes. Rick had thought that Eric had wanted a son that he could count on, not one who'd say \"to hell with it\" and go to Paris for a year. \"And I certainly think you'd want one you could trust,\" Rick bit out. Ridge told Rick to grow up.\n\n\nEric silence Ridge, who Eric felt needed to hang on to some dignity after what he'd done. Ridge wondered how he'd do that when one of his daughters was dead because of Rick and the other daughter couldn't stand the sight of Rick. Rick retorted that it wouldn't be by sleeping with Rick's wife.\n\n\nCaroline screamed at the men to stop it. She said it wasn't about every skeleton of the past. It was about a betrayal, one that she begged Rick to forgive her and Ridge for. She insisted that Maya had blown it out of proportion for her own gain. Maya quipped that it wasn't about her that time.\n\n\nCaroline invited Rick to go home, and he asked whose home. He told her to go to the cabin with Ridge, and she declared that she'd never do anything like that again. Rick bellowed that she shouldn't have been there to begin with. He asked if Ridge had invited her to the cabin and if she'd asked him why that place. Frazzled, Caroline said the call had been short. Rick asked her what she'd thought about it.\n\n\nCaroline replied that she'd assumed that Brooke allowed Ridge to use the place. Rick asked if she'd thought of all the guilty kisses she'd share with Ridge or about adding a bed into the mix. \"Did you think about me? Did you think about coming home to me? Did you think about touching me with the hands you touched him with, kissing me with the lips you kissed him with?\" Rick asked.\n\n\nRick had believed that the day would be his big day, and he'd receive his award after being sent away for years. He'd believed that his father's office would be his, and his beautiful, talented wife would be there to carry on the tradition with him. Eric said that it could still happen.\n\n\n\"No. You two made your choice,\" Rick stated, turning to Eric. Eric declared that there had been no family conspiracy against Rick. A conspiracy wasn't necessary to Rick, who felt that the family was like a pack of wolves who all knew when to turn at the same time. \"And you certainly knew your target,\" Rick concluded and turned to leave.\n\n\nCaroline tried to go with Rick, but he refused to let her. As Rick left, Caroline cried out that she loved him, and Maya tried to suppress her grin.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Hope entered and saw Ivy there. Hope expected Rick to retreat to his office at some point. Ivy thought that Maya had struck to inflict maximum damage when there was really nothing going on with Ridge and Caroline.\n\n\nCarter entered, and the three wondered what Eric would do. Hope figured that the odds that Rick would work beneath Ridge had gotten worse. Carter said the problem had to be resolved because Rick and Caroline were too valuable to lose. \"The question is -- is Ridge?\" Ivy asked.\n\n\nThe trio wondered if they should get to work, but they weren't sure what to work on or who they'd be working for. Ivy wondered if Maya would have a job. Hope replied that Maya couldn't get fired for telling the truth. \"But she didn't,\" Carter responded. Hope figured that telling a version of the truth was better than not saying anything. \"Is it?\" Carter questioned.\n\n\nCarter labeled the incident an unnecessary crisis. It sounded to him like Caroline had corrected her course before it had been too late. Hope replied that it was what Caroline had said, but Hope had been around people who'd earnestly sworn not to do something again -- only to do it again.\n\n\nIvy asked how Carter could work daily with a former lover whom he obviously still had feelings for. Shrugging, he said Maya's honesty had improved things between them. Hope noted that Carter appreciated Maya's honesty, the very thing Maya was being condemned for. He asserted that it was about Maya's motivation, and he didn't like her hurting people to get her way.\n\n\nDay turned to night, and Hope noted that Eric's door was still closed. As a newcomer, Ivy didn't feel entitled to take sides in the matter. Hope believed it was pretty clear-cut, but Ivy replied that it was what they kept telling themselves.\n\n\nBack in Eric's office, Eric sent Maya out so that he could speak to Caroline and Ridge alone. Ridge said Eric couldn't have expected the day to be easy because Rick had predicted that Eric would hand it all over to him. Eric didn't think the idea had been unrealistic, and he decided to retain the right to change his mind. \"Can I please just go?\" the exasperated and crying Caroline asked.\n\n\nEric refused to release Caroline. He grimaced. He'd known the day would be hard, but he'd never expected to hear what he'd heard about Ridge and Caroline. Ridge asserted that it had been a whole lot of nothing, and Maya was a drama queen.\n\n\nEric sensed that the whole thing with Caroline had been some sort of seduction. He theorized that Ridge had wanted to sell Eric on a design team because of Ridge's impairment, and the added bonus was sending Rick into a tailspin. \"You think I'm that calculating?\" Ridge quipped. Eric stated that he knew how calculating Ridge could be.\n\n\nRidge figured that Eric remembered what it was like with designers working closely for long hours. Ridge claimed that his lapse in judgment was over, and he and Caroline knew what kind of team they could be and what kind they could not be. He was sure Rick would get over it and decide against throwing away his wedding vows over a foolish infatuation. Eric asked Caroline if Rick would get over it.\n\n\nAt Brooke's cabin, Rick arrived without turning on the lights. He flashed back to the very first day he'd seen Caroline and to moments in their relationship and marriage. He recalled the first time they'd said they loved each other and when he'd proposed to her. He looked at a design that was on an easel. Beside it, a vision of Ridge staring at Rick while kissing Caroline appeared.\n\n\nRick hurled an object at the vision, and the object smashed through the cabin windows. He smashed item after item against the walls and windows and kicked the easel.\n\n\nRick's phone rang. Caroline was on the line. \"We were just newlyweds,\" he despondently murmured. She implored him to listen, but he said she had let \"him\" run all over them.\n\n\nCaroline asked Rick not to hang up on her, but he threw the phone across the room. He sank to his knees and sobbed. Behind him, the door opened, and Maya cautiously entered the cabin. Rick looked up at her, but then he hopelessly looked down and sobbed.\n\n\n",

Given the recent developments, everyone at Forrester Creations wonders where their jobs stand within the company. Eric questions Ridge on whether or not his actions towards Caroline were intentionally done as a means to getting the upper hand in the race for the CEO position.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline bares her soul and says they were caught up in the moment. Ridge says they did nothing wrong. Maya tells Rick she is so sorry; she tried to warn him. Carter tells Maya they do not belong here, she has an agenda. Rick tells a crying Caroline to get out. Ivy tells Hope that she doesn't think there is anything serious between Ridge and Caroline and maybe Rick over-reacted. Caroline stays and begs forgiveness from Rick. Rick bemoans that he thought all his hard work would pay off and all along Eric knew who he was going to pick. He even faces Eric and accuses him of having more love for his non biological son. He tells Ridge face to face that he is NOT Eric's son. Caroline says this is not about old battles, this is about betrayal right now. She begs Rick to forgive them. She says Maya has blown this way out of proportion. She will never do anything like this again. Rick says she should not have been in the cabin in the first place with Ridge. He can not go home now, not with her. Not seeing her hands or feelings her hands that she has had on Ridge. Rick is the one to leave despite Caroline trying to hold him back. Maya has a gloating look on her face. Carter tells Hope and Ivy that Caroline and Ridge are too valuable to lose so they have to settle this. Hope takes Maya's side by saying she only spoke the truth so that is no reason to fire her. Carter is not so sure since she had an agenda by wanting Rick for herself, always to be a Forrester. Ivy says she can not take sides. She is too new here and it still feel like a booby trap every place she looks. Eric closes the door and says he has things to say and did not want to say in front of Rick. He knows how calculating Ridge can be. Ridge says they had a lapse in judgment but that is all. Rick will be fine in time. It was just a foolish infatuation. Eric asks Caroline if Rick is going to get over this. Rick goes home and sees Caroline everywhere and remembers their very first eye to eye and when he gave her the engagement ring. But then he sees Caroline and Ridge kissing and loses it. He throws glasses, vases of flowers and more at the window and breaks glass. Caroline calls and he throws the phone at the window too and falls to the floor. Enter Maya who sees his hurt.",
