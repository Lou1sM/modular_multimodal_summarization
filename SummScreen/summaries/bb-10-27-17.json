    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Steffy and Ridge worked and discussed Bill and Liam's reconciliation. Ridge couldn't believe Bill had punched Liam. Steffy said Ridge knew how families were. Ridge claimed he'd taught his kids to use their words and asked why the men had been fighting.\n\n\nSteffy asked how many R's were in \"embarrassment,\" and Ridge asked her why she was typing that word into a quarterly report. Ridge quibbled over how Steffy was wording the CEO's preface to the report and said she sounded like her in-laws. She retorted that, though people didn't call her Mrs. Spencer, it was who she was.\n\n\nRidge quipped that people were embarrassed -- \"with two R's\" to call Steffy that. Steffy said that, regardless, she'd helped Bill and Liam reconcile, and they were back to working together. Ridge replied that it was good for Bill, not Liam.\n\n\nRidge compared Forrester to Spencer and noted that there weren't happy employees at Spencer. Steffy said Bill would tell people to stop whining and do their jobs, but Liam would give everyone raises and more benefits. To Ridge, she was talking about Liam like Bill did. Steffy contended that there were two sides to Bill and two sides to Liam, too.\n\n\nRidge asked to hear about the other side of Liam. Steffy described Liam as stubborn like his father. Liam thought he was right when he wasn't -- like his father -- and like Bill, Liam was extravagant. Ridge added the Liam was a good person, unlike Liam's father, and Liam gave to causes. Steffy replied that Liam could give too much, and Ridge wouldn't believe what Liam had given Sally Spectra.\n\n\nLater, Ridge exclaimed in shock about Liam giving Sally a multi-million-dollar building. Steffy said Liam had been righting Bill's wrongs. Ridge assumed she meant the article Bill had published. Steffy listed off other things Liam had done for Sally, like flying her to San Francisco and giving her an architect, and wondered when it would finally be even.\n\n\nRidge asked what he was missing and if Liam had a thing for Sally. Steffy wasn't concerned about that and said Liam wasn't the unfaithful type. \"All men are the unfaithful type,\" Ridge quipped. Steffy retorted that it would be that way if all men were like Ridge. Ridge told her that was nice to say. She didn't want to be morally superior, but she believed Liam was a good guy.\n\n\nRidge read some reports and complained about how the CFO of International submitted things. Steffy agreed that it was weird, and he said he'd discussed it with the CFO before. Steffy offered to do it again, but Ridge said it was his job.\n\n\nRidge stated that Steffy had a habit of getting in the middle and being the peacemaker; she'd done it with her siblings and with the Spencer \"boys.\" Steffy asked if it was wrong. Ridge replied that it could be, because peacemakers made great targets.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam and Wyatt watched Bill fiddle with his chair after he suspected that Liam had adjusted it. Liam said it kept rearing back like a bull. Bill leaned back in the chair with ease and said the chair knew its owner.\n\n\nBill presented Liam with his sword necklace. Bill was sorry he'd ripped it off of Liam and wanted Liam to put it back on. \"Hello, old friend,\" Liam said and happily clasped it around his neck.\n\n\nHanding out copies of an agreement, Bill said the documents made them equals at Spencer. The three men would run the company together, but his sons had to get their own chairs.\n\n\nLiam and Wyatt signed the contracts, and Liam was happy about the moment. He wanted to discuss the things he'd put in place in Bill's absence. Bill said the three of them would review them with fresh eyes; they'd keep what worked and trash what didn't.\n\n\nLiam thanked Bill and said he liked looking up to Bill. The men hugged. Liam decided to go. He swiped a yoga statue off the desk and exited. \"Sorry to see that little trinket go,\" Bill quipped.\n\n\nWyatt apologized to Bill for being testy back when Wyatt had thought he'd been shut out. Bill replied that he'd be leaning on Wyatt more than Wyatt knew. Wyatt said he wasn't trying to upstage Liam. \"As of today, we don't have to worry about your brother anymore,\" Bill responded. Wyatt looked puzzled.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley handed Sally mail from the title company that read \"refinance now.\" Sally said they'd just gotten their loans by using Spectra as collateral. Shirley figured that Sally had gotten the building from C.J. or Liam, and C.J. had denied giving it. \"Not that I disapprove. I think Liam is perfect for you,\" Shirley stated. Sally asked what Liam would be perfect for.\n\n\nShirley asked Sally not to make Shirley get graphic. Shirley hoped Liam had at least exchanged a buck for it, so it wouldn't be a gift. Sally said she didn't have a sugar daddy, and Liam was married. Shirley quipped that when a person was married to someone awful, it was called \"not yet divorced.\" Shirley asked if Liam would get a piece of the business.\n\n\nSally didn't answer. Shirley ordered Sally to be honest about it because Shirley wasn't too dumb to figure out who'd helped with the building. Sally acknowledged that Liam had been good to them, but she said that was it. Shirley guessed Sally didn't think as highly of him as Shirley had thought. Sally described Liam as the most amazing man she'd ever met, but she could appreciate someone without wanting something from them. Shirley said Sally could keep telling herself that.\n\n\nLiam arrived, and Shirley pretended she had to get back to doing all the things Sally had ordered her to do. Once Shirley was gone, Sally told him not to believe Shirley. Liam claimed that his flaw was believing everyone. Sally disagreed that he had any flaws and said he wasn't allowed to get off the pedestal. Liam was sure he'd fall off it later.\n\n\nLiam had arrived to tell Sally that Bill was back at Spencer. Sally assumed Bill was gunning for her. Disagreeing, Liam explained that Bill had acknowledged his wrongs and agreed to run Spencer equally with his sons. Liam assured her that the building and property belonged to her, and in theory, she had nothing to worry about from Bill.\n\n\nSally began pacing, and Liam suspected that she wasn't reassured. He wanted her to trust that she was golden and would pay back the banks for the remodel once she was on her feet. Sally replied that he was one of the few she knew who she did trust and who had cash, not cobwebs, in his wallet. Liam opened his empty wallet, and she joked that it was his first flaw. He promised she'd be big once she opened the doors again.\n\n\nBack at Spencer, Wyatt said he'd thought Bill had said the three of them would run the place. Bill replied that it was true. Bill became pensive about the time he'd spent alone at his house while Liam had been behind the desk and Wyatt had been God knew where. Wyatt said he hadn't been hiding; he'd just thought Bill had wanted time to himself.\n\n\nTime to himself had been Bill's life before he'd gotten married and had found Liam and Wyatt.  Bill didn't want it anymore, and he couldn't go back. Bill had meant that the three would run the company together, per the document, but he asked how much Wyatt had enjoyed taking orders from Liam. Wyatt said he'd take a bullet for his brother, but Liam hadn't been right for the job.\n\n\nBill stated that they'd seen another side to Liam, who'd been, \"pigheaded, self-righteous, and above all else, self-righteous.\" Bill added that Liam had been power-hungry, too. Bill reasoned that those qualities had gotten Bill to where he was that day, but there was only one Bill. Bill said Liam thought he could cure the world by handing everyone a thousand dollars and an issue of the \"Soybean Chronicles,\" but things didn't work that way.\n\n\nPointing at the contract, Bill said it was a system of checks and balances. He asked what the majority of three was. \"Two,\" Wyatt replied. Bill called Wyatt smart, despite what anyone in the building said. Bill announced that he and Wyatt were the two. Bill deemed himself \"the checks\" and said Wyatt was \"the balances.\"\n\n\n\"As long as I can count on you to vote with me,\" Bill added. Wyatt believed he and Bill agreed on most things, except Quinn. \"But you put yourself back in charge,\" Wyatt stated. Bill responded that it had been in the nick of time because they were about to have a tall problem.\n\n\nSomeone knocked on the door, and it opened. \"Did somebody order a skyscraper?\" Justin asked as he and Alison wheeled \"Sky\" into the office. Wyatt looked worried as Bill walked over to the skyscraper model and welcomed it home.\n\n\nAs Bill polished the statue, Wyatt said he'd thought they'd gotten rid of that thing. \"Alison to the rescue,\" Bill replied. Alison said she hadn't sent it to the house, as Liam had requested, but had kept it safe. Bill stated that she was untrustworthy as the day was long, except with him. As she turned to leave, Bill instructed her to get all the \"crap\" out of his office. She nodded and exited.\n\n\nWyatt assumed that the building was the tall problem. He said it had been a bone of contention. Bill told his son to call her \"Sky,\" not a bone.  Assuming Bill still planned to build it, Wyatt asked where it would go. \"Where do you think?\" Justin asked.\n\n\n\"Not the Spectra site, I know that,\" Wyatt said with a huff. Bill retorted, \"Then you don't know much.\" Wyatt pointed out that Liam had paid out the wazoo for the property. Bill replied that it had been for Spencer Publications, but Wyatt explained that Liam had signed it over to Sally. Deciding to let Justin earn his money, Bill deferred to his lawyer to speak.\n\n\nJustin explained that all properties belonging to Spencer were held in a trust. Whether it was a parking space or a strip mall, anything they acquired went automatically into a trust for which Bill was the trustee. Bill was the only person authorized to sign off on any transfers. Bill stated that Liam's gift to Sally was invalid without Bill's signature.\n\n\nJustin further stated that the county had kicked it back to the title company, who, in turn, had kicked it back to Justin. Wyatt assumed the deed had looked real because Sally had borrowed against it. Bill replied that it wasn't their problem, and thanks to Liam, Bill could finally give \"Sky\" the home she deserved.\n\n\nWyatt decided that Bill had suckered Liam and had used Wyatt to do it. Bill didn't think it was a nice thing to say, and his feelings were hurt. Wyatt insisted that it was what Bill had done. Bill explained that it was legit. Liam had made the purchase, but because he couldn't legally do anything with it, it was still Spencer's.\n\n\nBill asked if Wyatt thought they should honor Liam's generous impulse and flush a fifty-million-dollar purchase down the drain. Wyatt readily disagreed with the suggestion, and Bill said that they were in agreement.\n\n\nWyatt said Liam didn't understand that the agreement they'd just signed was to keep him in line. Bill reasoned that it kept everyone in line, working together, thinking together, and achieving together. Bill claimed he'd meant everything he'd said to his sons, and if Bill could count on Wyatt to give Bill a reliable and consistent majority on matters, they'd have a bright future. Gesturing to the model, Bill said the sky would be the limit.\n\n\nWhile Bill believed that Liam was smart, Bill didn't believe Liam had a mind for business. Bill figured that, together, he and Wyatt could save Wyatt and Liam's inheritance and build the most beautiful skyscraper and everlasting legacy to the Spencer name. Bill asked if Wyatt was with him. With a chuckle, Wyatt said, \"Hell, yeah. I'm in.\"\n\n\nBill said that he appreciated many of Liam's qualities, but when it came to \"Sky,\" Liam would just have to deal. The majority would carry the motion, and Spectra would have a date with the wrecking ball.\n\n\nJust then, Liam rushed back in, apologizing for leaving on the errand. \"What up?\" he said when he saw the building model. Bill joked that the sky was up. Liam stammered that he recognized it. Bill corrected that Liam recognized \"her.\" Liam stammered more, and Bill said Liam had thought she was gone, but she wasn't. Liam asked why that was. Bill asked if it was or wasn't his office.\n\n\n\"Why is Wyatt looking at the floor?\" Liam asked. Bill replied that Liam knew his brother, who was a floor-looker. Wyatt stared around, avoiding Liam's gaze, and Liam asked \"what the hell\" was going on.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Bill tries out his chair and it feels like the perfect fit although Liam says he always felt like he was on a mechanical bull. Bill hands him and Wyatt papers and says they will all be working together and running the company. Liam says he never thought he would see this day. When he leaves Wyatt apologizes for saying anything earlier when he felt he was being left out with Liam running the company. Bill says it is forgotten and he will be leaning more and more on Wyatt and not to worry about Liam, he has plans for him. Steffy discusses the situation with Ridge. She says Liam is stubborn like his father but he gives too much. Ridge will not believe what he has given Sally Spectra. He is a good guy, perhaps too good but she is not worried about him and Sally personally. He is not the unfaithful type. Sally and Grams have a little talk and Grams cannot convince her that Liam is perfect for her and it matters not that he is married. With two completely different people that only means temporary until a divorce. Sally says she does not need a sugar daddy. She will be just fine. Liam visits Sally and tells her there will be three of them running the company but her deal is still solid so she will have no problem with Bill. This place is going to be big; he has that feeling. Bill continues to talk to Wyatt and says Liam goes too far and needs checks and balances. Wyatt will be the check and Bill will be the balance as long as he can count on Wyatt. Justin brings the prototype of Skye back in where she belongs. Wyatt says he knows this is his bone of contention. Bill says do not call her a bone; she is Skye. Then he wants Justin to look into the papers as he did not sign any papers so the Spectra building is technically still theirs. Wyatt says Bill suckered Liam and used him to do it. Bill says he is hurt and he is not going to throw all of this down the drain. Working together, thinking together will keep them all together if Wyatt will keep him to a joint majority of two when it comes to voting. You might say the sky is the limit. Together they can save Liam's inheritance with this everlasting legacy. Bill says when it comes to Skye he does not trust Liam but he will just have to accept this. Liam rushes back in and says he recognizes Skye....and that look on Wyatt's face; so what the hell is going on here.",
