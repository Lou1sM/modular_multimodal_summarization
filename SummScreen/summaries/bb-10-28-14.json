    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Eric chastised Ridge and Caroline for their dalliance. Caroline said she had to find Rick, but Eric advised her to leave Rick alone. Eric turned his attention to Ridge. \"She's your brother's wife,\" Eric shouted at Ridge. Eric calmed down and told Ridge that Rick thought Ridge was trying to take everything away from him. \"Were you that afraid that I would choose him as the CEO? Did you plan this?\" Eric asked.\n\n\nRidge tried to explain that he had never planned to hurt anyone. He defended his and Caroline's actions as those of two passionate people -- two artists. \"One thing led to one another,\" Ridge said. Eric angrily disagreed. \"You should have had the maturity to walk away. Not another word,\" Eric ordered.\n\n\nEric again chastised Caroline and Ridge for betraying Rick. Eric said that at least Caroline had the decency to feel horrible. Eric noted that they had spent hours together, supposedly for the company, and had instead betrayed Rick. \"He's my flesh and blood,\" Eric said.\n\n\nRidge furiously said that Eric was pulling the bloodline card, but Eric dismissed his concern and said that Rick had been suffering, and that meant that Eric suffered. Ridge angrily said that neither Eric nor Rick had suffered. Ridge asked if Rick had died in his arms. Eric paused. \"Little Ricky will be just fine if he chooses to be,\" Ridge sneered.\n\n\nRidge wondered what Eric wanted. He asked if Eric wanted him to apologize and to admit that he had been wrong. \"Well I can do that,\" Ridge said. Ridge explained that he had been lost after the accident and had lost his ability to draw -- he'd lost his career until he started to work with Caroline. \"She helped me,\" he said.\n\n\n\"We helped each other,\" Caroline said. Eric said they both were responsible for their feelings. He told them they should have stopped or asked for help. He blamed himself for not stepping in. \"The two of you have given me a lot to think about,\" Eric said, and he left.\n\n\nRidge worried that Eric had changed his mind about the CEO's position, but Caroline was discouraged that her marriage was in trouble. Ridge shushed her. He asked her why she had confessed in front of everyone. Caroline said that Maya had laid it all out there. \"You confirmed it,\" Ridge said. Caroline insisted that she'd had to tell the truth.\n\n\nCaroline realized that Ridge only cared about the CEO position. \"Rick thinks that you're conning me. Is that true? Were you just playing me?\" Caroline asked. Ridge replied that he hadn't meant to hurt her. He added they had been a great team and had created something amazing.\n\n\nCaroline angrily suggested that Ridge had known what he had done. She guessed that their partnership had been a joke. She wondered if he had gone home to Katie each night and laughed about the girl with the crush. \"Na\u00efve Caroline making a big fool of herself,\" Caroline said.\n\n\nRidge argued that Caroline had never been a joke to him. He added that after he had left a session with Caroline, he'd always had memories of her -- even when he'd gotten into his car. \"I couldn't get the smell of your hair out of my head,\" he said.\n\n\nCaroline worried that she had lost her husband, but Ridge said that Rick would return to her because he knew better than to leave. \"What he knows is that I've been kissing you,\" she said. Ridge countered that Rick had always been a hothead, but he would blow off some steam. \"He knows what he has in you. Little Ricky is a lot of things, but he's not stupid,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nCaroline wondered how Rick would stay if he had to wonder what was going on every time Ridge and Caroline were alone. Ridge said that they would no longer be together, but they agreed that what they'd had had been \"pretty amazing.\"\n\n\n\"We got carried away, and the lines got blurred. For the record, the times we spent together were some of the most magical moments in my life. And I didn't mean to hurt you. It wasn't my intention,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nIn Hope's office, she looked at sketches, and she sent a text to Rick. Carter entered, and Hope said she had been worried about Rick. Carter said that he was convinced that Maya had gone after Rick. Hope lamented that Caroline had been so foolish and had done something with Ridge, of all people. Carter said that Maya had never given up on Rick. Carter said he should have seen it coming with the \"millions of ways she avoided planning the wedding. She was just waiting for Caroline and Rick to implode,\" Carter said.\n\n\nCarter wondered if the Forresters would have fired Maya if she had been wrong. Hope said that people in love often did crazy things and took big risks. Carter and Hope agreed it had all paid off for Maya because she had gotten exactly what she'd wanted. Carter wished it hadn't been at the expense of Rick and Caroline.\n\n\nAt the cabin, Rick had been drinking whiskey and had trashed the place, and Maya tried to calm him down. She guessed that he had returned to the \"scene of the crime.\" \"I keep picturing their hands, their lips,\" Rick said. Maya nodded and said that she wouldn't leave him alone. Rick shook his head and gulped more whiskey. He lamented that he and Caroline had been newlyweds. \"This is where my marriage ended,\" Rick said emotionally. Maya looked concerned but smug.\n\n\nRick's phone rang, and it was Caroline. He told her to stop calling him. Caroline begged him to meet her at home, but he refused. She asked if he had been drinking, and she offered to pick him up, but he refused. \"I'll be fine,\" Rick said coldly. Caroline begged him not to hang up on her, but he did.\n\n\nMaya moved closer to Rick. Rick poured another glass of whiskey. He thanked Maya for standing up and telling the truth. Rick guessed that Caroline would have continued lying and playing him if Maya hadn't called her out. \"She would have never confessed,\" Rick said.\n\n\n\"Stop torturing yourself,\" Maya said. Rick shook his head. \"I should have never married her,\" Rick said. Maya said that she understood Caroline had been beautiful and in the right place at the right time. Rick added that it had been a Forrester-Spencer merger and had seemed right.\n\n\nRick took off his wedding ring. \"Thank God we didn't have a child. My marriage is over,\" Rick said. He lamented that he had never mattered to Caroline, and he gulped more whiskey.\n\n\nMaya sympathized with Rick. \"I never stopped caring about you -- even when it seemed like I should give up. I love you,\" she said. She kissed him and reminded him that she had loved him ever since the first day they'd met at Dayzee's. Maya reminded Rick that Caroline had disappointed him then, and he had turned to Maya then. \"Turn to me now,\" Maya said, and she kissed him passionately. They made out on the couch. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Maya uses Rick\u2019s sadness, anger and vulnerability to her advantage as she gives him a supportive shoulder to cry on. Ridge and Caroline defend themselves to Eric who hints that he may rethink his decision about who will replace him as CEO. Caroline confronts Ridge about whether or not he was using her to advance his career. Hope\u2019s opinion about Caroline changes as she takes Rick\u2019s side.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick rises from the floor amid the broken glass mess and asks Maya if she is following him. She laments that she is not letting him go through this alone and thought he would be here. Caroline tells Ridge and Eric they need to find Rick. He does not need to be alone. Eric says it should not surprise her. Eric tells Ridge this is his brother's wife and he should have had the maturity to walk away and not give in to his passion. He does not want to hear another word. He says at least Caroline has the good sense to feel awful. But Ridge has betrayed all of them. Ridge accuses him it is back to that. Rick is the real son and Ridge isn't. He says little Ricky is embarrassed and hurt but he will be just fine. Eric says he hopes so for both of their sake. Hope tells Carter that she wants to be with Rick but she also understands that he wants to be alone. Carter tells her that Maya also has left the building. One guess where she is. She is with Rick. She would not miss that opportunity. Hope says she understands when a person feels like they should be with another, you do crazy things. Hope can't believe Caroline did this and with Ridge of all people. Ridge tells his dad that he could apologize and make them feel better but he is not. He lost who he was and Caroline helped him. Eric says he can not blame this all on work. Either one of them could have stopped the kissing. Caroline calls Rick. He tells her to stop calling. He does not want to talk to her or hear what happened. She asks if he is home. He looks at Maya and says no. Then she asks if he will meet her there and again he says no. Ridge tells her Rick needs time. Eric says he is not sure even time will do it. He sure knows that he may need more than time. They have given him a lot more to think about now. Caroline rails at Ridge for only worrying about the CEO position and here her marriage is falling apart. He tells her none of this would have happened if she did not confirm Maya's suspicions. Caroline asks Ridge if he was playing her. Was he just using her for his designs so he could be CEO. He admits yes he thought he could benefit. But he did not go home and brag or laugh about it to Katie. He says it is not a joke. He could not get the smell of her hair out of his head, but he should have stopped it and so could have she. But he hopes he has not messed it up for her. Rick knows what he has in Caroline. Little Ricky may be hurt right now but he is not stupid. What they had was pretty amazing. But the lines got blurred. And for the record the time they spent together was some of the most magical times of his life and he is sorry if he hurt her. Rick tells Maya that he should thank her for standing up for him and telling the truth. Caroline could have kept on lying and playing him for a fool. Maya said he had a right to know. With Caroline she is first and everyone else is an afterthought. Rick takes off his ring and says his marriage is over. Thank God he does not have a child. He pours himself a drink. Maya watches and moves closer and says she never stopped thinking of him not even when she was with Carter. She kisses him and says she loves him. She keeps kissing him as he guides her to the couch. She pulls him closer.",
