    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the motel, Vivienne and Julius chatted in the morning, and Julius maintained that what Maya had asked Nicole -- to be a surrogate -- was unnatural. Julius maintained that Nicole should never have agreed. He was convinced that Maya was poised to make the biggest mistake of her life.\n\n\nVivienne argued that they could not dictate to Maya. Julius agreed, but he felt that Zende Forrester could have an impact on the situation. Julius left to see Zende.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Zende and Nicole were kissing, and Nicole worried that someone might walk in. Zende said he would use the excuse that Nicole had been lightheaded, and he'd had to give her mouth-to-mouth. Nicole lamented that Zende had not been able to protect her from her dad the previous day because he had been giving her a hard time. She acknowledged that it was hard on him. Nicole worried that her decision was too hard on Zende too. \"Am I asking too much of you? Of us?\" Nicole wondered aloud.\n\n\nZende advised Nicole to stop worrying, but she admitted she didn't want to lose him. They made out, but Nicole had to leave because she had promised Maya she'd stop by. She apologized that she had to leave.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's place, Wyatt had just finished a swim when Quinn and Deacon showed up. Quinn encouraged Wyatt to notice that she had knocked and not barged into his house. \"Where's Ivy?\" Quinn asked. She said that Ivy and Wyatt had been practically living together, but Wyatt corrected her that they were dating but not living together.\n\n\nQuinn noted that Wyatt and Ivy had been close, and Quinn and Deacon added that it was the first time he had been close to someone since Hope. Wyatt reminded Deacon and Quinn that it was his love life, and he wanted to keep it private. He added that Ivy was nothing like Hope, who'd had \"divided loyalties.\" Deacon and Quinn were silenced.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Charlotte asked to have dinner with Thomas, but he turned her down. Charlotte acknowledged that she was just an intern. Thomas said it wasn't good timing. Charlotte left, and Ivy entered. Ivy greeted Thomas and said Charlotte's crush was cute.\n\n\nThomas said it had become a big deal when his dad had found out and told him he had crossed the line. He explained that he and Ridge had gotten into an argument that had escalated to a physical altercation. Ivy was concerned, but she was sure they would get past it.\n\n\nThomas teased Ivy about her modeling gig, and he asked her to model one of his designs. Ivy laughed and related what had happened with her discomfort at modeling lingerie. She admitted that the photo shoot had been a disaster. Thomas congratulated Ivy because she had been a lady, not self-obsessed with showing off her body. Ivy was grateful for the flattery.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Vivienne visited Maya, and she apologized for Julius. She reminded Maya that Julius had a strict sense of right and wrong. Nicole showed up, and Vivienne apologized to both of them. She added that surrogacy and Nicole's involvement were a lot for Julius and Vivienne to accept. She acknowledged that Nicole was a grown woman.\n\n\nNicole admitted that it was not where she had seen herself, but she wanted to help her sister. Vivienne reminded Nicole she had a boyfriend, and it was a sacrifice. Nicole said it was worth it. Vivienne and Maya reminded Nicole that she should not jeopardize her happiness for Maya and Rick. Nicole left.\n\n\nJulius entered Zende's office. Julius teased that with Zende's good looks and intellect, he should be running Forester. Zende smiled. \"Don't let Ridge hear you say that,\" Zende advised. Julius wondered if Zende supported the idea of Nicole carrying Rick Forrester's baby.\n\n\nZende said he supported Nicole's decision. Julius asked if Zende was sure, and Zende asked if Nicole had said something. Julius explained that it was \"more what she didn't say.\"\n\n\n\"I need you to help me stop this,\" Julius said. Zende respectfully disagreed with \"Mr. Avant.\" Julius said that he sensed Zende had reservations. Zende asked Julius not to put words in his mouth, but Zende acknowledged it was a big step.\n\n\n\"I adore your daughter,\" Zende said, and he added that Julius was not giving Nicole enough credit. Julius smiled and said that Nicole had a blind spot when it came to her sister. Julius warned that the truth was that Nicole would be fat and pregnant and carrying her sister's husband's child. He wondered if Zende would be okay with that.\n\n\nJulius stated that Zende would not be doing Nicole any favors if he lied to her about how he would feel if he wasn't sure. He added that it would be a complication to their relationship. Julius left.\n\n\nIn his office, Zende paced. Nicole showed up, and she noticed that he seemed distant. Zende explained that Julius had been there. Nicole wondered if Julius had convinced him to change his mind about supporting her decision. Zende paced again. \"If I carry Rick and Maya's baby, are we over?\" Nicole asked.\n\n\nLater, Julius entered the Forrester mansion, and he ordered Maya to stop pressuring Nicole.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "In their motel room, Julius screams at the mirror. He tossed and turned all night and got no sleep. What Nicole is going to do is unnatural. Vivienne says Nicole is an adult and he can not dictate to her. Julius says there is one person out there who might side with him; he is going to see Zende. At the office Zende and Nicole kiss and she says she knows this is going to be hard on him putting their relationship on hold for a year. She hopes that is not asking too much. He jokes that he is not going anywhere. She needs to go meet Maya so they kiss goodbye. Quinn actually knocks on Wyatt's door first and is surprised that Ivy is not there as she thought they practically lived together. He tells her and Deacon they have gotten very close but not living together. He asks Deacon what he has done with his mostly lovable but crazy mother ..falling in love did this? Deacon says leave her alone for a few minutes and she turns into Carol Brady. Quinn says yes she is in love and she can tell it is happening to Wyatt too. He politely warns her that his love life is his love life, she has no say in it. He likes Ivy a lot. He has not felt about anybody like this since Hope. Ivy has no divided loyalties. She is totally into him. Ivy and Thomas have a mild flirtation at the office. Ridge had given them the whole don't cross the line speech and she knows now that one of them will be spending the night alone and it isn't her. Vivienne goes to the Forrester mansion and apologizes to Maya for what Julius said yesterday. She is happy to hear Nicole is coming over so she can say the same to her. Julius tells Zende that he knows this decision has to upset him too and they can't let Nicole do this. Zende could make her stop this. Thomas tells Ivy that his latest addition to the bedroom line needs a model and wonders if she is interested. She thinks he is being funny. He isn't. He's heard all about how Steffy tried to manipulate her for being in front of the camera, no thank you. Thomas says this would not be in front of a camera but he admires how she stays true to herself, a real lady. She smiles but wonders where all these compliments are coming from. Vivienne apologizes to Nicole but says Julius is right in one thing. There is Zende to consider and Nicole may not want to make that sacrifice. Zende admits to Julius that he is not totally wrong but it makes no difference as Nicole has made up her mind. He admires her even more for it. Julius realizes that Zende is not saying much, he has too much class. But he is doing no one a favor by not telling them the entire truth of how he feels. It is either Maya's child or Zende. He goes back to the Forrester's but misses Nicole. He tells Maya that he wants her to back off. Nicole has found Zende now and does not need this pressure from Maya. Nicole meets up with Zende at the office and he tells her he just saw Julius who thinks her decision is a deal breaker. She asks is it ..will they be over?",
