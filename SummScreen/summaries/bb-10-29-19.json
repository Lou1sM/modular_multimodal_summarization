    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke tells Hope that this whole night seems like a nightmare but she should be at the cabin with Liam and Beth. Brooke says she did not want to take off her rings but Ridge gave her no choice. Ridge is embraced in a lip lock with Shauna both finding themselves in the Forrester guest house. Thomas thanks Eric for letting him stay there. Eric says he and Douglas are family so they are welcome here any time. Eric says Douglas is an exceptional little boy and Eric's only concerns is how Thomas was acting. Thomas interrupts and says he only did those things out of love. He still loves Hope. Shauna apologizes for the way she looks in the mask which some pieces are still attached and her old pajamas, she is going to burn. And then she will kill Quinn for not telling her about others on the premises. She is so embarrassed for standing there in front of him of all people. Ridge says Quinn did not know. She asks why he moved out of his house to here. He tells her about the adoption papers and she is sorry. He says he wants his marriage and his wife but not at the expense of his son. Thomas explains to Eric that he wanted a mother for Douglas and Hope was that mother he wanted. He still does. Hope gets a call from Douglas who wants to tell her good night. He'd like to come home but his dad says he can't. He misses her and she repeats it to him. She says if he ever feels alone or scared he can touch his heart and know she will always be there. They both say they love each other. She then tells Brooke this boy is like her son so she has to get custody of him. She thinks it over and tells Brooke perhaps there is some way to protect Douglas and get custody like she wants. Shauna tells Ridge that she and Brooke are not that different. They both came from homes with no money. Shauna says she had a tiny little boutique in a casino and Brooke took shortcuts too when she married Ridge. Hope tells her mom that she might think this is crazy but she knows how much Thomas still loves her and if she is careful and pretends this might work out. He might sign the adoption papers. Douglas is vulnerable but worth the effort. She loves Liam and Beth of course, but she has to do this for Douglas. Brooke is more skeptical since Hope can barely stand to even talk to Thomas now, much less be around him. Ridge tells Shauna not to take this the wrong way but Brooke used to have this mischievous twinkle in her eye but he has not seen that in a long time. She asks which one is going to leave. He replies no one. She wonders if he wants a redo of the Bikini night. He says no, he did not even remember that. What he needs now is a friend. She says she can be his friend if that is what he wants. But she has been told she has assets that might distract one and then there is her sexy pajamas. He quips that he will take his chances. Hope reminds Brooke once again that Thomas is not fit to be a parent and she has to keep Douglas out of harm's way. Thomas thinks of his wedding to Hope and calls her on the pretext of letting her know that Douglas is settled in and in bed already. He makes it quick and says good night. She is delighted and tells Brooke that she is positive that Thomas still loves her and she can tap into those emotions and try to change his mind and he will sign the adoption papers. It's a risk but she can be careful and not even let Liam or Steffy know. It's a huge secret but Douglas is worth it. It will work, it has to work!",
