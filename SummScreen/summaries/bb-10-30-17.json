    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley entered Sally's office with a handful of invoices, and Sally said to pay them. Shirley asked where Sally's \"boy\" was. Sally replied that Liam wasn't her boy, and he'd stopped by to tell her that Bill was back at Spencer. Worried, Shirley dropped her stack of invoices.\n\n\nCleaning up the papers, Sally asserted that they owned the building, and Bill couldn't hurt them. \"Says who? The boyfriend?\" Shirley quipped. Sally corrected that Liam was the benefactor, not boyfriend. Shirley saw it written all over Sally's face that Sally was crushing on Liam Spencer, and Shirley wondered how much longer Liam would be married.\n\n\nSally denied having a crush on Liam, who'd merely helped her through rough times. Shirley stated that Sally needed the man. \"We all do,\" Shirley said. She believed Steffy would eventually bounce back. Sally insisted that she wasn't a homewrecker, but Shirley said that Sally needed to start seeing Steffy for who Steffy was -- Sally's number one rival.\n\n\nLater, Shirley pinned a photo printout of Liam on the wall. She said he deserved a spot on the wall of fame after what he'd done for them. Sally said they had no wall of fame and told Shirley to take the photo down. Shirley replied that they were alone, and Sally could be honest.\n\n\nSally confided in Shirley that Liam was the greatest man she'd ever met, and he'd turned her life around. Shirley replied that Sally had been let down many times, but she'd finally met a man who treated her with respect, which was a rarity. Sally stated that he was helping to make her dreams happen, and Spectra was back all due to Liam.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke and Steffy checked out Zende's sketches. They were impressed with his growth and the European flare in his work. Brooke remarked that Zende and Nicole were enjoying Paris. Assuming it was quiet at Brooke's house, Steffy asked how Brooke was doing.\n\n\n Brooke said leaving Bill and filing for a divorce was difficult. Steffy reminded Brooke that she had two men who loved her. \"Almost as much as they love themselves,\" Brooke rejoined. Steffy said that, being a Spencer, she could see that Bill was hurting. Brooke asked what Steffy saw as Ridge's daughter, and Steffy admitted that she'd like to see Brooke and Ridge back together.\n\n\nSteffy noted that Brooke hadn't filed for divorce yet and asked if Brooke had made a decision. Brooke hadn't. Steffy wondered if it would help to know that Liam and Bill had forgiven each other. Steffy retold the intense moments at Spencer when Bill had arrived to reclaim his business. Steffy hadn't known what Bill would do, but Steffy said it had been beautiful when the men had hugged and reconciled.\n\n\nBrooke was surprised to hear that Bill had agreed to run the company with his sons. Steffy believed that the number one thing Bill wanted -- besides Brooke -- was peace in the family. Thoughtfully, Brooke repeated the words.\n\n\nBrooke was impressed and grateful that Steffy had helped the Spencer men reconcile. Steffy said that Bill loved his family, and someone had needed to step in. Brooke admitted that she should have been the one to do it because she'd been married to him. Steffy corrected that Brooke still was married to Bill and would be until she filed the divorce papers.\n\n\nBrooke expressed that there was a gentle side to Bill. Steffy replied that he wasn't the same man Brooke had walked out on. Though Brooke was grateful for it, she still knew there was a very aggressive and stubborn side to Bill. Steffy believed that Bill had learned his lesson. Brooke hoped so because she wanted the father and son truce to last.\n\n\nBrooke inquired about things between Steffy and Liam. Steffy said they had their challenges. Brooke assumed that Steffy meant Sally and said Sally hadn't torched a building. Steffy replied that Liam hadn't had to ride to the rescue, either. Brooke said Liam loved to cheer for the underdog, and she hoped the couple was working things out.\n\n\nSteffy believed the situation had worked itself out, and there wasn't any place for Sally, whose influence over Liam was finally over.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam wanted to know what was going on with the skyscraper. He had thought that he, Wyatt, and Bill were supposed to be equals, but Liam felt out of the loop. Bill replied that Liam had left and returned, so he was still in the loop. The only thing that had happened in Liam's absence was that Bill had announced that the skyscraper would go up.\n\n\nBill said it would be a landmark moment for the Spencer family. Liam figured that they should find some land for it, and he suggested building in Anaheim. Citing that they already had a building there, Bill declared that \"Sky\" would be built on the Spectra lot, and he wanted Liam to be on board with it. Liam said the property belonged to Sally, but Bill explained that it belonged to the Spencer trust, like everything else in the company.\n\n\nLiam agreed that it had been the case before he'd signed it over to Sally. Justin stated that no one could sign over anything from the trust without the trustee's signature. Bill added that Spencer publications owned the building, not Sally.\n\n\nLiam asked if Bill planned to go back on his word about the three Spencer men running the business. Bill replied that he'd meant every word and didn't intend to change it. Bill even intended to keep a lot of the programs that Liam had implemented in Bill's stead; however, Bill would not give in on \"Sky.\" Wyatt said it was a good compromise -- Liam got his programs, and Bill got his building. \"Our building,\" Bill corrected.\n\n\nLiam assumed that Spectra would just get the wrecking ball. Bill suggested that Sally relocate. Agreeing, Wyatt said it wasn't like it was the end of Sally's business. Liam asked how Wyatt could be okay with it after all Bill had done to Sally and asked if anyone cared about honor, fairness, and decency. Bill asserted that they all did, including him.\n\n\nBill said he was working on himself, but he had a problem with gifting a prime piece of Los Angeles real estate to someone who hadn't earned it. Liam accused Bill of being so frightened by Sally's success that he'd torched her building to ruin her momentum. To Liam, it translated into Bill's confidence that Sally had earned the building.\n\n\nLiam said that Bill was proud of the way he'd built Spencer himself, but if someone had sabotaged him as he'd sabotaged Sally, none of them would be where they were. Liam believed that Bill owed it to Sally, and Liam didn't intend to let Bill take the building from her.\n\n\nLater, Bill closed the door after Justin had left, and Liam said he knew he shouldn't have trusted that guy. Bill replied that Justin wasn't the problem. Family was important, and Bill wanted them to stick together on issues \"like this.\" Assuming Bill meant the building, Liam said it had become an obsession to Bill, who'd even given it a name and talked to it like a girlfriend.\n\n\nAs Bill polished the model, Liam stated that it was weird. Wyatt agreed. Bill was okay with being a little weird, and he liked to fly his freak flag. Bill believed the building would make them a major real estate player. They'd employ thousands and increase the value of the surrounding property. Bill said they'd contribute to the growth of downtown Los Angeles, and he asked what was wrong with that.\n\n\nLiam quipped that it wasn't good for the person who owned it. Bill replied that it was great for the owners, because they owned it, not Sally. Liam said it would be Sally's if Bill signed and notarized the agreement, like Bill knew he should.\n\n\nThat wasn't happening as far as Bill was concerned. He offered to set aside funds to relocate Sally. Liam huffed, and Bill said Liam needed to meet Bill in the middle. Liam replied that Bill could build the thing elsewhere. Liam and Wyatt threw out names of other cities, but Bill roared that he'd had enough.\n\n\nBill had looked at it from every angle, and the Spectra spot was the perfect place. Bill knew that it was upsetting to Liam, but he assured Liam that years from then, Liam would see the Spencer name on the building and beam with pride -- as would Liam's wife and children. Liam doubted it because he wouldn't let Bill put the building on the Spectra lot.\n\n\nBill insisted that the Spectra building was going down, and he and Wyatt were standing firm on it. Liam asked Wyatt if it was true. Wyatt said that he agreed with some changes that Liam had made, but Bill was right. Liam huffed. Wyatt agreed with Bill that the gift had been way too much. Wyatt also reminded Liam that he knew how his wife felt about Sally.\n\n\n\"Dude, I'll handle my marriage,\" Liam replied. Liam asked if Wyatt was just going to be Bill's butt-kissing yes-man. Wyatt claimed that he'd disagree whenever he needed to, but that time, he agreed with Bill. Wyatt believed the skyscraper would be their Spencer legacy, and it should be impressive. Liam replied that it was about ethics.\n\n\nWyatt replied that they ran an international corporation, not a charity shop. Looking helplessly back and forth between Wyatt and Bill, Liam asked if majority ruled. Bill affirmed it. Liam decided he didn't care about majority. Liam refused to let Bill tear down Spectra Fashions.\n\n\nBill wanted their fighting days to be over and said it was time for respect. Liam asked if the respect was for just Bill. Wyatt reminded Liam that they were keeping some of Liam's programs and asked if that was respect enough. Bill said he and Wyatt had compromised, and it was time for Liam to do the same.\n\n\nBill declared that he was Liam's father, and the company was Bill's life's work. Bill knew what was best for it and for the family. Liam said Bill had admitted that he'd ruined Sally and asked if it meant that Bill owed her. Bill believed Sally would succeed wherever she landed. Liam contended that Sally wanted to stay where she'd been before Bill had burned it down.\n\n\nBill said Liam was fighting against his own father for a woman he barely knew. Wyatt added that it was a family project, and they'd pledged to put family first. Bill argued that Liam was standing in the way of the most significant project for a generation of Spencers because he was enamored with a pretty little redhead.\n\n\nLiam advised his father to stop it with the \"pretty little redhead\" routine. To Liam, Sally was a human being whom Bill had treated unfairly and disrespectfully. Bill said the point was taken. He claimed that he was learning from Liam and had even offered to relocate Sally. Bill believed there were limits, and he asked about Liam's loyalty to the family, the company, and the employees.\n\n\nBill decided that he was demanding that Liam learn from Bill, too. \"Sky\" would go up on the Spectra property, and Bill wanted Liam to accept it. Even more, Bill wanted Liam to be a part of the greatest chapter in the family's history. Bill didn't want to go back to warring. He wanted Liam to accept what was happening.\n\n\nIn Bill's mind, Liam had to accept it. Bill asked that Liam be smart and stop with the defense of Sally and Spectra. \"Be one of us. Be a Spencer,\" Bill proposed to Liam.\n\n\n",
