    "tvmega_recap": "Rick can't thank Nicole enough for her agreeing again to be their surrogate. They hug. She confides in him that Zende walked out and it was her fault. She had agreed with him she would not do this again but she changed her mind. She loves Zende and she knows he is upset right now. He loves her too and the woman he loves has to do this. He just needs to blow off some steam and he will return. Zende comes on strong to Sasha but she pulls away and says she cannot do this to her sister. He says Nicole does not care. Not only did she do this one time, but twice. He cannot keep waiting around for her to have kids for Rick and Maya. He is tired. It is time for him to be a man, a Forrester man. He makes a quick phone call and then tells Sasha that they are going to Hawaii. Eric is well enough to come downstairs and sits at the piano and starts tickling the keys. She tells him she knows he is going to come all the way back. Wyatt comes in and tells them there was no wedding. Eric says he knew Ridge was still in love with Brooke. Wyatt says there is more. He is not sure Eric should hear this but Eric insists. Wyatt says Ridge was planning a coup to take over FC. He fills them in on the plan with Bill giving Brooke his shares. Eric is livid that Ridge begged to be POA all the while knowing he was going to do this. Quinn says Ridge failed but maybe he learned something so Eric needs to take a breath. She says this is his CEO talking. She and Wyatt will handle this and Eric does not have to worry about it. Rick and Nicole hug again and she says she is sure Zende will stay mad for a while, but he will come back to her. Sasha tells Zende that he knows how she feels about him, but she cannot be his rebound again. She cannot do this to her sister again. He says this time he is breaking up with Nicole, so it won't be the same. Maybe Nicole is too serious for him. With Sasha there is no complications and all he is asking her to do is fly off to Hawaii with him, they can have fun. Quinn tells Wyatt they have a lot of work to do with a big fashion show coming up. Eric says he knows they can handle it. He is very grateful that Wyatt is here now. He needs him. Wyatt says for now he will stay and they will see how that goes. Eric tells Quinn that he knows Ridge will not stop and will keep trying this so Eric has to come back strong now and keep the company. Quinn says she is so looking forward to her husband doing just that. Sasha cannot get over that here she is on a jet, more than that a private Forrester jet. Nicole calls Zende and says she is home now and would like to talk. He says there is no reason. She is having another baby. She says they can work this out. He admits he loves her but hangs up. At the last minute Sasha says perhaps they should not go, it is not too late for him to go home and work this out. It is his decision as to what he wants to do.",
