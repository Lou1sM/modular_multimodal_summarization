He said he wasn't having fun running his company because of Liam. Steffy wanted an explanation, but she saw the statue of Sky in the room and asked why it was there. Bill explained that he was going ahead with his project. Bill said he would be building on the Spectra site as soon as he could, with demolition crews ready to go. Steffy argued that Liam had given the Spectra building to Sally.\n\n\nBill explained that the sale had not been authorized, so Liam did not have the power to sell the property. Steffy was surprised, and she was upset that Bill and Liam were fighting again.\n\n\nBill maintained that he owned the property, but Steffy said that Sally knew Bill had been behind the fire. Bill didn't care because there was no evidence. Bill complained that Liam wanted to give Spectra a year to move. \"Liam isn't like you and me,\" Bill said. He worried that Liam didn't appreciate the jobs and development his skyscraper would bring to the area. Bill joked that the mayor might give him a key to the city. Or Bill might even become mayor.\n\n\nSteffy wanted to know what had happened to the breakthrough Liam and Bill had achieved. Bill said Liam had lectured him on the Spectra building's legacy and that Liam had defended Spectra needing its building even though Bill had offered a compromise -- to find another building and help Spectra relocate immediately. \"I'm trying to be fair and decent,\" Bill said of the compromise he had suggested to Liam.\n\n\nBill was angry that Liam had become too involved in the success of Spectra. Bill concluded that Spectra was too important to Liam, and Bill questioned why Liam was so interested in Sally. \"What exactly are you implying?\" Steffy asked. Bill wondered if there was another reason for Liam's interest in Sally. Steffy said that her husband was trying to help Sally. Bill and Steffy agreed that Sally was getting too attached to Liam. Steffy explained that she had already visited Sally to discuss that. Bill decided that Sally had caused too many problems for his family, and he wanted to get rid of Spectra.\n\n\nAt Spectra, Shirley admired designs that Sally had done and claimed they were better than anything in the previous collection. Shirley said Liam had helped to ensure the future of Spectra, and the collection would turn the business around. Sally and Shirley agreed they had a lot riding on the new collection.\n\n\nSally reviewed designs. Liam entered and broke the news that his dad had retaken ownership of the building. Sally argued that she had already hired more employees, and she'd promised to repay every penny of the loan. Sally didn't understand how it had happened. She was worried that the building was her Aunt Sally's legacy. Sally said she couldn't take it anymore. She blamed Bill for all his lies, bad reviews, and the fire. \"I just can't keep doing this -- fighting and losing,\" she said. Sally wondered why Bill hated her so much.\n\n\nLiam said that Bill had nothing against Sally. Bill was obsessed with his building. Sally said she kept getting so close, but something always prevented her from succeeding.\n\n\nShirley, Darlita, and Saul entered and announced that Spectra had a call for an interview and preview of the new line, but Sally and Liam shared the bad news about the building. Shirley, Darlita, Sally, and Saul agreed they couldn't relocate before the new line was out. There just wasn't time.\n\n\n\"This building is my sister's' legacy,\" Shirley said. She refused to leave. Liam noted that it might work. They could stage a peaceful protest -- a sit-in. Liam said that Bill wouldn't listen to him anymore, but if they all participated, it might work.\n\n\nShirley, Darlita, Sally, and Saul agreed to protest and not let Bill take down the building. Darlita and Saul left, and Liam left. Sally worried to Shirley that it was dangerous, and she worried they were all risking their lives.\n\n\nSally couldn't believe Liam was so committed. She noted that he always fought for what was right. Sally added that Liam had nothing to gain and would put his job and his relationship with his father in jeopardy. Shirley said that Liam was doing it for Sally.\n\n\nAt home, Liam walked into the bedroom, and Steffy cooed that he had just missed a chance to take a shower with her. They kissed and discussed Bill's most recent takeback of the Spectra property. Liam claimed his dad had played him and tricked him into backing down to what Bill called a compromise. Liam said he'd had to break the news to the Spectra team, and they were \"shellshocked.\"\n\n\nSteffy argued that Bill had offered to relocate Spectra and move it to a newer facility that didn't need to be updated. She put a positive spin on the news because Bill wasn't trying to put Spectra out of business.\n\n\nLiam countered that Spectra was in the middle of production on a new line with new employees. Moving would mean losing time and money that would mean missed deadlines on a line that had a lot of potential. Liam believed Spectra needed to stay put and plan a long-term move. He told Steffy about the sit-in that would prevent Bill from destroying the building. Liam planned to pack and camp out with the Spectra team to prevent Bill from tearing down the building.\n\n\nSteffy told Liam to stop. Liam defended Spectra's attachment to the building as a family legacy. Steffy was angry. Liam said his defense of Spectra was about fairness and doing the right thing. Steffy refused to allow Liam to risk lives -- especially his own -- for Spectra because Bill planned to dynamite the building. \"I'm not gonna let you do that,\" Steffy shouted. Liam glared at her.\n\n\n",

Liam is forced to tell Sally in person that their plan to rebuild and relaunch Spectra Fashions will not happen.  When learning from Steffy that Liam told Sally about him being responsible for the fire, Bill becomes concerned about what lengths his son will take to help save Spectra.  Liam makes a promise to Sally and her employees that he will save the company and offers a solution for them all to fight Bill: a sit-in.

    "imdb": "With reconstruction ahead of schedule, Sally and Shirley settle in their new old office and debate some designs. Liam arrives and sadly informs Sally in person that their plan to rebuild Spectra Fashions will not happen. As they are talking, Saul, Shirley and Darlita enter, enthusing about the new collection. Sally announces that she does not own the building and that Bill wants to demolish it this week. Shirley urges her niece to fight - and suggest classic peace protests as a means to stop Bill from tearing down the building. To everyone's surprise, Liam immediately signs up to join the Spectras for their \"sit-in\". Steffy learns from Bill that all of her efforts to reunite him with Liam were in vain, because once again, they are at war. Bill grouses that Liam has no understanding as to why that location is so important for his skyscraper, and complains that he is siding with that redhead again over his family. Bill fears that Liam is attached to Sally in a way he should not be.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy drops in on Bill. He tells her that he is going ahead with his plan to erect Skye and on the Spectra lot. Seems even though Liam was CEO he did not have the authority to give it to Sally. Spectra Fashion is finally coming down. She sees that means they are fighting again. And the worst part even though Bill confessed there is no recording left of that so Liam cannot prove it. Liam has to be the bearer of bad tidings and tells Sally that his dad is taking the Spectra site back. It's not about the money but the land and his dad won't change his mind this time. He still wants to figure something out but he cannot override or outvote his father. Sally says this is her Aunt Sally's legacy and he said he would help. She can't keep fighting and losing in the end. Bill said he would help her move. She says she is not leaving. She tells the others that she does not own this building; Bill Spencer still does. Bill tells Steffy that he has offered to move Sally, even give her money and relocate in a new better building but she won't budge so he can be fair and decent and maybe even be Mayor Dollar Bill Spencer. But Liam is too involved and is seeing things through ginger colored glasses. He says he is not making this up. Liam is too involved with Sally. Just give him one reasonable explanation; he has done way too much for her. It is time to stamp out Spectra Fashions and for her husband to let go too. Shirley tells Liam that she even put his picture on their wall. Liam says he is sorry but this is his dad's doing. Shirley says this belongs to her sister Sally and this is not going to go. She does not care what Bill says no one is tearing this building down or they will have to go through her. Liam gets an idea. When people believe in something they have a non-violent protest and the wrecking ball can't do its thing. Sally says she can do it but she cannot answer for everyone else. The others say they are in. Liam says he is in too, he will stand up to the bully even if it is his father. This is the right thing to do. Shirley says he sure is earning his place on their wall. Sally says she is fighting for Spectra because this is her home but Liam has nothing to gain from this. He can lose his father and his place at Spencer Publications. He's doing this because he is a really great guy. Steffy and Liam discuss it and Steffy says the building is old so maybe relocating is not a bad thing. Liam says he will not let his dad do that and he thinks he has come up with a way \u0096 a nice little protest and he is going to help them. He stood up to his father once before and he tricked him and he will not do that again. Steffy argues and why is he so attached to Sally and this project. A sit-in; she will not let him do that.",
