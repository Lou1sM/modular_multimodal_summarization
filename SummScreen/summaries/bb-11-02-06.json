Brooke asked Donna if she could really be sure of what she saw and begged her not to make the situation between Nick and The Forrester's more volatile. Donna wondered why Brooke was suddenly so tolerant of Stephanie after all she had put the Logan's through. Then Donna asked Brooke to tell her whether she had chosen Nick or Ridge because it affected her life too. Donna left as Nick walked in wanting answers from Brooke. \n\n\nAt Forrester, Ridge told Stephanie that Brooke told him that she was going to follow her heart, and that meant that she was going to leave Nick and return to Ridge.

Donna is so furious that she decides to leave Nick a voicemail telling him that Jackie\u2019s fall was not an accident.  Brooke tells Nick their marriage is over and that he and Ridge should move on with their lives, but Nick insists that she will soon realize that he is the only man for her.

    "tvmega_recap": "Donna continues with her assessment that Stephanie did indeed push Jackie over the banister, it was NO accident. She and Brooke are interrupted by Nick who thinks if Brooke can confide this in Donna, she can at least tell him where he stands in the marriage. Ridge gloats to Stephanie that the Nick/Brooke marriage is dead, dead, dead. She will never love anyone like she does him, and she said she was going to be true to herself, so that means she is definitely coming back to him. Nick won't let Brooke off the hook and insists she tell him her feelings. She doesn't feel like she can love anyone right now. She needs to be strong to be able to love anyone. In closing she tearfully tells him she never had so much fun, felt so secure, and how he'd touched R.J. and Hope's lives. Just look around, it may be over, but it will never end. With bittersweet memories floating around in his head, Nick shoves a few clothes in his briefcase and prepares to leave. They have one last goodbye and he turns and comes back, slowly takes his ring off to hand to her, but slips it into his jacket pocket. Donna shows up at Forrester and trades barbs with Stephanie who calls her nothing more than a high-school dropout. Donna laments to Ridge what might have been, but she never had a chance. He confesses in another lifetime he would have loved it. She finds Stephanie has packed up her belongings and is asking her to get out of there as far away as possible \u0096 her services are no longer needed. To herself, Donna vows that Stephanie will live to regret this decision. Ridge visits Brooke and she opines how much she hated hurting Nick. Assuming she is coming back to him, he can't quite understand she needs alone time, but gives it to her. Donna calls Brooke and tells her that Stephanie fired her and she's going to make damn sure she pays for this. She calls Nick and leaves a message that this is about his mother and Stephanie \u0096 it was NO accident.",
