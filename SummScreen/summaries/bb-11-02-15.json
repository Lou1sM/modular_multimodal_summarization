She had left him abruptly the day before, but she said she just couldn't because of the surrogacy. He wasn't upset about the day before. He admired her for her choice, but because they were a couple, he wanted her all to himself.\n\n\nNicole claimed that Zende did have her all to himself. Zende told her that he could already feel the decision separating them, and it didn't seem to change her mind. Nicole was sorry she'd disappointed him, but she'd promised her sister. She didn't want to go back on her word, but she didn't want to lose Zende either. He apologized for putting more pressure on her.\n\n\nNicole claimed that Zende got to have a voice, but as he'd said, it was her decision. She reasoned that it didn't have to matter between them, but he asked how it wouldn't matter. They had something amazing that Zende didn't want to lose. \"So we won't!\" Nicole asserted.\n\n\nNicole suggested that she and Zende go through it together and take care not to let the process swallow them. She asked if he'd meant it when he'd said the baby wouldn't be a deal-breaker. Zende said he'd promised to try to hang in there, but she'd be pregnant with another man's child. She claimed to understand that there was only so far their relationship could go due to a decision he was against. She knew it wasn't fair to do or to ask him to wait.\n\n\nZende said that he wouldn't go anywhere, and they'd figure it out. Nicole asked him to promise to tell her if it got hard or if he needed space to wrap his mind around the changes. She asked if they'd be okay, and he said they would. Nicole told him that she had to go to another appointment because the time was right with her cycle. \"Wait a minute. You can get pregnant today?\" Zende asked.\n\n\nNicole claimed it took more time than that, but they were starting that day. Zende asked if she was really sure about it. She said that having the baby for her sister was a gift to herself, too. Zende realized that she was really doing it, and she said she wanted to have their baby. He told her that she was crazy, and he might have to get a little crazy, too. The two hugged.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Rick and Maya's parents sat with the couple and discussed the surrogacy situation. Julius felt that someone had to take Nicole into consideration. Rick replied that he and Maya had, but Julius didn't think so. Julius told Maya that she'd weathered the hard times, but Nicole was just starting out and needed protection. \"From me,\" Maya assumed.\n\n\nVivienne said Julius wasn't saying such, but Rick and Maya were asking a lot of Nicole. Julius said the couple should tell Nicole they'd find another surrogate.\n\n\nBrooke ascertained from Rick and Maya that the tests were done and Nicole was onboard. Brooke and Eric understood the Avants' concerns about Nicole's age and relationship. Rick and Maya insisted that they hadn't pressured Nicole. Vivienne reasoned that Nicole felt beholden to the couple. Vivienne stated that Julius wasn't eloquent; however, she didn't disagree with him about the surrogacy.\n\n\nJulius asserted that it had been selfish of them to even ask. Maya asked if Vivienne felt that way. Vivienne believed Maya was only seeing it from her own viewpoint, and having the child would stop Nicole's life for a year. Vivienne said Nicole could lose Zende, and broken hearts could last a lifetime.\n\n\nRick relayed that it was Nicole's decision, and no one should pressure her. Julius stated that he'd say what he wanted to his daughter. Julius was certain that no man would hang around while his woman blew up with another man's child. He believed that, as soon as the word got out that Nicole was out of commission, girls would crawl all over Zende, and Nicole would be lucky if he remembered her name.\n\n\nVivienne stopped Julius so she could have her say. Vivienne explained that, in her generation, women weren't taught to find their authentic selves. They were taught to marry a strong, God-fearing man to lead their families. She said she'd done it, and she'd let Julius lead her family -- to the detriment of Maya. Vivienne had found her voice, and she was determined to fight for her other daughter, Nicole.\n\n\nVivienne admitted that she was worried because no one but Nicole had to sacrifice. She said that pregnancy didn't happen in a vacuum, and mothers loved the babies before the babies were born. Brooke agreed, saying that Nicole might become attached and begin thinking of the baby as her own.\n\n\nVivienne added that gestation was a physical and emotional strain, and she wondered what would happen if they learned it was the only baby Nicole could ever have. \"Oh, I think you're asking too much,\" Vivienne said in a sad and grave tone. Julius told them to mark his words that nothing good would result from it.\n\n\nJulius said Maya had always been self-centered. Maya groaned, but he told her to wait a minute because he wasn't calling her out or judging her. He said he was only making a comparison. He noted that Maya did what she had to do to be comfortable in her skin and without concern for consequences. He discerned that Nicole wasn't like that; she was softer and a giver.\n\n\nVivienne added that it was the reason that Nicole wouldn't say no to Maya. Julius felt that Maya was taking advantage of Nicole's qualities. Maya shook her head. He relayed that Maya might not be aware of it; but she was doing it, nonetheless. Vivienne thought it was natural for Nicole to feel beholden to Maya for what Maya had given her. \"But to give you her body?\" Vivienne asked.\n\n\nJulius said Maya couldn't ask Nicole to do it; it was outrageous. Rick asked his parents to weigh in. Brooke said she would do anything for her sisters, including carrying a child, and the young Nicole was old enough to make her own decisions. Brooke approved and lent her support.\n\n\nEric said no one could predict how it would alter Nicole's life; however, she was well beyond the age of consent, and no one could stop her from doing what she wanted to do. Eric agreed to be there for Nicole and the couple no matter how it turned out.\n\n\nMaya told Julius that his concerns were valid, and she promised that they'd thought about them all. She insisted that she and Rick hadn't pressured Nicole. Maya was grateful to live as her authentic self and that Nicole would help her have a child with her genes. It was the greatest gift, and she felt they'd be crazy to turn it down. Maya hoped Julius still wanted the family to be whole, even in light of their expanding family. Maya left the room before he could answer.\n\n\nLater, Vivienne and Julius were alone. Julius called her his number-one girl. She said he hadn't said that in a long time. She didn't know what to do because they couldn't get their babies to do what they wanted them to do, and the girls weren't babies anymore. Maturity was just a number to Julius, and to him, Nicole would always be his little girl.\n\n\nWith Nicole in Los Angeles, it was harder to protect her, in Julius' view. He felt that Maya should protect her little sister, not take advantage of her. Vivienne didn't see Maya as taking advantage. Julius wasn't shocked that none of his \"girls\" agreed with him. He believed that he could still get Zende to help him stop the foolishness.\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, Rick asked if Maya was okay. Maya said she hadn't realized how strongly her mother felt about the procedure, but unless Nicole backed out, they'd go ahead. Maya was surprised that her mother had been so expressive and assertive and believed Vivienne was changing.\n\n\nMaya said her parents thought she and Rick were being selfish and unfair. Rick said it had been tough to hear. Maya understood it and reasoned that they were asking a lot.\n\n\nDr. March and Nicole arrived. Maya and Rick made sure Nicole knew she didn't have to do it if she wasn't ready. Maya said she didn't want to cost Nicole her first relationship. Rick added that they were grateful that she'd even considered it. Nicole stated that Zende was on board.\n\n\nZende arrived. Nicole was surprised. He said she was going through a big change, and he needed to be there for her. Nicole conveyed that his support meant everything to her. \"Let's make a baby!\" she said to everyone. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells Julius that his move to LA is a very big decision. Julius tells Maya that she is asking her sister for a lot, too much. She needs to find someone else to be the surrogate. As a parent, Eric understands his concerns. Vivienne says Nicole is beholden to her sister and Julius can be harsh, but she does not believe he is wrong in this. Nicole could lose a lot in a year's time including Zende. That is a lot to ask. Nicole tells Zende that she does not want to lose him but she gave her word to Maya and she can not go back on that either. This does not have to matter to the two of them. She hopes he will not walk out on her. But if it gets too hard, just tell her at any time. He says he is not going anywhere. Julius claims that Zende is quite a catch and once words gets out that Nicole is pregnant the girls will be coming out of the woodwork. Vivienne says Nicole will love that baby before birth and there will be physical and emotional stress. This might be the only baby Nicole can have and Maya is asking too much of her. Brooke says she understands. Nicole is young but she is capable of making her own decisions. Eric says there is no way of predicting how taking a year out of Nicole's life will affect her, but he agrees with Brooke. Maya laments to Julius that he has valid concerns but they have given them all consideration and they would be crazy to turn Nicole down. Nicole tells Zende that the procedure is today so she could get pregnant today. Zende tells her she is a little crazy but then it must mean that he is a little crazy too. Julius tells Vivienne that Nicole is out here now living in the fast lane and his daughters do not agree with him, but he still thinks he can get Zende to stop this foolishness. Nicole shows up late at the doctor's office but says all is fine and she is ready. Again both Maya and Rick say she can back out even now if she has any doubts. Zende surprises them. He says there is no stopping this, so he is ready. Nicole says, \"Let's make a baby.\"",
