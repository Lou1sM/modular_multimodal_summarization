    "imdb": "Eric summons Ridge, Steffy, Brooke and Pam to confront them about their attempted takeover of Forrester Creations. The family is shocked when Eric makes it clear that Quinn will run the company in his name for the time being. Later, Steffy and Wyatt come face-to-face for the first time since their breakup. Wyatt promises not to delay a divorce if it is Steffy's wish. Quinn and Eric have another argument. Rick and Maya encourage Nicole to talk things through with Zende. In Hawaii, Sasha awakens a hungover Zende. She realizes that his thoughts and heart are still with Nicole. A phone call with Nicole causes the adverse effect, though: Nicole is disappointed that Zende ran off with Sasha - even though they did not sleep together - and therefore decides to stick with the plan to give Rick, Maya and Lizzie a little baby sister.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Pam serves coffee to Steffy and Ridge when Quinn and Wyatt lead Eric down the stairs. Steffy says she knew he was making progress but she was not expecting this. Ridge wants to help but Eric says he can manage. Pam says with him up on his feet and Thanksgiving just right around the corner makes them even more thankful this year. Steffy speaks up and asks why did Eric want them here. Slowly he says they boycotted the wedding and now this latest insult to stage a takeover, a coup, and they have to ask? Nicole tells Maya and Rick that she knows how badly they want to give Lizzy a little brother or sister and she has already had the paperwork once so there is no reason now to delay. They want to make sure she has told Zende now that she has made this decision. She nods yes for all the good it did. But that was last night. Maybe he will feel differently today. Sasha tries to get Mr. Rise and Shine to get up but he does not even know where he is. She makes light of it that maybe it was all the mai tais they had on the plane or even those shots of tequila that he had. She laughs and asks how does he say hung over in Hawaiian. Then she addresses him as Dracula and says she knows vampires do not dig sunlight but they are in Hawaii and she wants to take advantage of it. He apologizes and says he knows he promised her a good time with a lot of partying but he just is not in the mood. Disappointed, she says she gets it. He is still thinking about Nic and her decision to be a surrogate again. And frankly she does not blame him for feeling this way. Quinn tells Eric maybe this is not the time to be doing this. Wyatt says just maybe it is. Ridge wants to know why Wyatt is even there and speaking. Eric says Wyatt is part of the family now and is moving in with his blessing as he thinks of him as another son. They still do not accept how Quinn makes him feel and Wyatt has. He is capable and supportive. And he is loyal unlike Ridge. Ridge says he is sorry that his dad is questioning his loyalty. Quinn says it is hard not to with what he has been planning on doing behind his father's back, not once but twice. Ridge says and yes Wyatt felt like he had to bring that to Eric's attention. Wyatt says yes it needed to be said. Ridge says leave Brooke out of this. But Eric says she was just as involved as they all were to get those shares from Bill. And he thought he used to be able to count on Pam but even she turned against him on this while she was not personally involved and .Ridge and Steffy were the ringleaders in manipulating everyone to think it was a good idea to boycott the wedding. They came up with this scheme to steal the company and then lied to everybody about his POA. So do they think he should forgive them, Brooke, Thomas, Maya, Rick, Pam and Zende for having no respect for him. What do they expect from him, his own family. He mentions the fashion show is coming up and Quinn is in charge of everything. Quinn is the one he trusts. He is not asking this of them; he expects it of them for everyone to trust and accept. It will be Quinn and Wyatt. The fashion show is very important. Ridge says he knows. He has poured his heart and soul into the showstopper but Eric says he has made his intentions clear. This is not a game they are playing. He dismisses them all but when Ridge starts to leave Eric says not him; there is more he wants to say to him. Maya suggests that Nicole call Zende again and Rick agrees, they do not want to jeopardize what she and Zende have. Sasha tells Zende that any woman who would not listen to her man in a situation as important as this, she does not think he would want to be in that relationship. Eric tells Ridge that his coup failed and his threats to Quinn were empty. It is now time for him to get on board with the way things are now. Eric puts his arms around Quinn and looks at Ridge and says he loves her. She has changed his life. So Ridge needs to turn the page now and accept who is head of this family. Steffy catches up with Wyatt and says she did not know that he was living here now. He says he assumed she did but then she had been awfully busy with his brother, pretty much out of touch. She sighs and asks if he is doing this because of her ..because she ended their marriage. He replies no and wrong for her to even think that. She says she does not know what to think now. She accuses him of telling her that his mom would not be in their lives but she is constantly front and center. He claims he tried his damnest to stop her but she and Eric cannot be stopped. They love each other and Wyatt says he did everything he could for him and Steffy. He says he followed all of her demands, even asked his mom to move away and he did not even go to her wedding in respect for Steffy and her position. He did that for Steffy because he loves her. Now shock of all shocks, his mom fell in love with Eric so he is doing this for them now. Steffy argues that Quinn took advantage of Eric's vulnerabilities and made a fool of Wyatt in thinking she could change. She says Wyatt really let her down. He charges back that she let him down. She walked away from him. She is the one who walked away from their marriage. He did nothing wrong there. She argues back that the marriage was doomed from the start because of his mom. Now just look at all the devastation she has caused. Sasha tells Zende that she would love to be doing more than just talking right now but she gets it; he is a deep guy and wants to do more than just jump in the sack with her. His phone rings and it is Nicole. Sasha tells him he should get that. Nicole tells Zende that she needs to talk to him about this. He says he is not in LA so now is not a good time. She asks him where he is and is surprised when he says in Hawaii. He just got drunk and took off. She asks who he is with. Again a surprise when he says Sasha but if Nicole has changed his mind he will come straight home .otherwise all bets are off. She curtly tells him bye. Then tells Maya that Zende made his decision and she made hers. She still wants to be the surrogate. And she wants to do it right away. Wyatt tells Steffy that he is here for one reason only and maybe she thinks he is an idiot but he sees what she won't allow herself to see ..they are good together and make each other happy. He would do anything he could to get their marriage back, her back. He meant every word of his vows and despite Quinn he believes Steffy did too. But he will give her the divorce as long as she knows that he will always love her. Quinn asks Ridge if he needs help in finding his way out. He says no he is just peachy. She says he is a great liar. He retorts that she is a greater liar and that is why Eric is where he is now. His dad doesn't see a lot of things like how Quinn really is. He tells her do not take this wrong but how does this miserable, horrible person just breeze in here and take over and know all the right things to do when apparently the rest of the family does not know how to. She thinks for a minute and says in the past she might have used a lot of four letter words but she will just use one now \u0096 love. She says she finally found love. He says that makes him want to throw up in his mouth. She says as corny as that may sound she will do anything for their love and to protect Eric. He claims that she is keeping Eric away from his family. Quinn says family \u0096 ah there it is. But his mother is gone and she is sorry about that but it is the truth and Ridge needs to accept that she is now the Forrester matriarch. They are having a big fashion show and Eric wants her and Ridge and all of them to work together. And she intends to meet Ridge half way for the sake of the family now, her family now. She just needs to know he will do the same.",
