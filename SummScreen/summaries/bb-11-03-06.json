Brooke assures her she needs time alone to heal first, but there are plenty of eligible men in L.A. for her. Donna keeps lamenting that Stephanie pushed Jackie and should pay for her crimes.

Ridge is content for now that Brooke will be coming back to the office and they will be working together.

Glaring at Stephanie he tells her he knows what she did. She firmly but politely tells him to leave otherwise she will call he police. That does not deter him; he moves even closer until finally she goes up those stairs again and he follows, grabbing her by the scruff of her jacket and has her head like a dangling participle over the railing until her face turns red. He is like a madman wanting her to admit her guilty all the while with her hollering no, she will admit nothing.",
