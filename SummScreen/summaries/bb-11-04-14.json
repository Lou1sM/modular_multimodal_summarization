Hope changed the subject and explained that there was a lot of drama at Forrester over the CEO position. Hope said a meeting had already started, and Liam said he didn't want to hold her up. Wyatt entered and interrupted.\n\n\nWyatt said that he and Hope had to attend their first appointment where they would have an ultrasound and find out if they were having a \"bambino or bambina.\" Wyatt noted that he had seen Ivy in the hall. Wyatt told Liam that he was glad to see Liam interested in Ivy because she was talented and pretty. Hope looked disappointed. She said they had to leave, and they left. Liam looked thoughtful.\n\n\nEric met with Caroline, and she worried about what had happened to her marriage. Rick and Maya entered, and Eric advised Rick to get along with everyone. Ridge entered but turned around to leave. Eric insisted that Ridge meet with the family to discuss the future of Forrester. Ridge refused, but Eric commanded Ridge to be seated. Eric, Caroline, Rick, Ridge, Carter, and Maya sat down, and Eric told them that Rick would be CEO, and Ridge would remain a designer. Ridge was quiet.\n\n\nOutside the meeting, Ivy saw her dad, John Forrester, and she sat and talked to him. John explained that he and Eric had a fishing trip planned in Oregon, but Eric had a meeting and had problems to contend with before they could leave. John quizzed Ivy about Liam, and he said that Liam had made quite an impression on Ivy.\n\n\nJohn asked where Ivy would take her jewelry line next, and she said it would be rolling out in Amsterdam. John teased that there were plenty of bridges there, and she might need Liam to protect her. They laughed, and John volunteered to chaperone, but Ivy said she would be fine. \"With Liam, I think you will,\" John said.\n\n\nJohn tired of waiting for Eric and decided to interrupt the meeting. John entered and congratulated Rick as the new CEO. John insisted that he and Eric had to leave in order to get to Oregon before sundown.  Eric disagreed, but Rick advised that Eric should take time off. \"We'll be fine. We'll work it out,\" Rick said. Eric and John left.\n\n\nIn the meeting, Rick asked if anyone else need a little break away from Forrester because he would not make it easy on them, since he felt everyone but Maya had betrayed him. Rick looked at Ridge and told him he could hold Caroline's hand all he wanted as long as he produced designs. Ridge reminded Rick that Ridge had been wrong to kiss Caroline, and he knew it, but Ridge didn't understand why Rick had decided to punish Caroline.\n\n\nRick looked coldly at Caroline and said, \"You, you'll be hearing from my attorney.\" Carter said that \"as an attorney,\" he suggested a cooling-off period, but Rick warned that Carter had better change if he wanted to stay at Forrester. Carter said that Maya had been \"a  money-grubbing -- \" but Rick interrupted that if Carter or anyone insulted Maya, they would be gone because Maya had been the only one who had been loyal to him.\n\n\nMaya smiled. Caroline looked sad, and Ridge looked disgusted. Ridge wondered why Rick had to throw his weight around. Caroline begged Rick to talk to her privately, but Rick refused.\n\n\nRick announced that Maya was the lead model. \"Oh God,\" Ridge said. Rick ordered Caroline to create a showstopper dress for Maya, but Ridge said they had already designed a showstopper. Rick insisted that Caroline had to do a new one. Caroline refused and said that Maya and Rick were rubbing her face in a few kisses with Ridge.\n\n\n\"You are seriously losing it attaching yourself to Maya. I know you're angry and this is no way to handle it,\" Caroline said. She refused to give up on their marriage. Rick stood up and said the meeting was over. Ridge, Carter, and Caroline left.\n\n\nMaya whispered that she was proud of Rick because he had stood up to all of them. Rick said he was the CEO, and he would demand their respect. He told Maya that he needed a moment alone. Maya left him alone.\n\n\nAfter the meeting, Ridge found Caroline in her office and said that he had wished Rick would see his mistake for leaving her. \"Thank you for sticking up for me in there,\" Caroline said. \"It's my fault,\" Ridge answered.\n\n\nCaroline disagreed. \"It's both our faults, I just got caught up in ... you ... designing, and now he's leaving me, hooking up with Maya. What am I supposed to do?\" Caroline asked sadly. She and Ridge looked at each other, and Ridge moved closer, but Caroline walked away.\n\n\nAt Quinn's house, Deacon sat without his shirt on, and Quinn wondered why he hadn't been dressed. Deacon said that he had seen no need to get dressed because Quinn kept ripping his clothes off. She smiled and said that was part of the fun. Deacon playfully said that some of his favorite clothes were in tatters.\n\n\nQuinn said she had other things on her mind. She explained that there had been a shakeup at Forrester, and she was worried about what it meant to both Hope and Wyatt.  Deacon said they would be fine because both Ridge and Rick were smart guys who understood that Forrester needed the Hope for the Future line.\n\n\nQuinn said she had to leave because she needed to crash Hope's doctor's appointment. \"You gotta be kidding me,\" Deacon said. Quinn said that she refused to miss out on her grandchild's life. Deacon reminded Quinn that she had not been invited, and it would not end well. \"Wish me luck,\" she said. \"You're gonna need it,\" Deacon said. Quinn left.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam looked at his phone and read a text message from Ivy, who was looking for him, but Liam prepared to send a text to Hope that asked how her ultrasound had gone, but he didn't send it. He thought about Hope.\n\n\nWyatt and Hope entered the doctor's office, and the physician explained that they would not see much on the ultrasound because it was so early in her pregnancy, but they would hear the heartbeat. The doctor also explained that Wyatt and Hope needed to decide if they wanted to know the baby's gender at the next appointment. If they didn't want to know, the doctor would make sure everything was a surprise. Hope caressed Wyatt's face and said they hadn't discussed it. After the ultrasound was underway, Wyatt and Hope grew very emotional. They saw the ultrasound and heard the baby's heartbeat.\n\n\nWyatt and Hope cuddled, laughed, and kissed. They tearfully smiled as they watched the ultrasound screen. In the doorway, unseen by Wyatt, Hope, or the doctor, Quinn stood dressed in surgical garb with a mask and surgical cap disguise. She watched the ultrasound screen.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Maya returned to Rick's office with a huge bag. Maya wanted to celebrate. She had Champagne and caviar in the bag and noted that the lead model and CEO needed to celebrate. Rick opened the Champagne. He still looked somewhat sad, and Maya told him that he would forget \"her\" in time. \"Focus on us,\" Maya advised. She kissed Rick, and he poured the Champagne. They toasted. \"To us,\" Rick said.\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Eric calls an impromptu company meeting to officially introduce Rick as Forrester Creations\u2019 new CEO. Knowing that Hope and Wyatt have an ultrasound appointment that afternoon, Quinn makes it a point not to miss it. As his first order of business as head honcho, Rick makes drastic personnel changes. Despite carrying mixed emotions about Ridge, Caroline plans to fight to get her marriage back on track.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Deacon tries to get amorous but Quinn says not now, she has other things on her mind. Their children are working at FC and they need to make sure that continues to go well. There is a new CEO shakeup. She has missed out on several things, like today is Wyatt and Hope's first ultrasound. She starts to head out and Deacon says he can't believe she is going to crash Hope's appointment. Quinn says she can not miss out despite what Hope says. He wishes her luck and says she is going to need it. Eric calls another meeting and tells them this is really, really important. Liam stops by just before Hope is going to her ultrasound. She only mentions that she is not going to the meeting because she has her own appointment. It is when Wyatt comes in that he mentions the ultrasound. He tells Liam that Ivy is pretty and very talented so he's happy for the both of them. Ivy talks to her dad about going on another fishing trip and he wishes her well with her showing of jewelry in Amsterdam. He questions her about how many dates she has had with Liam. Then he interrupts the meeting and practically drags Eric out to go to Oregon and catch their supper. Rick takes over and asks if anyone else needs a break as he won't judge them. Things could get a little difficult around here. He reminds them that they all betrayed him but they are going to carry on. He tells Ridge that if he needs Caroline's hand to guide him, he does not care. He tells Caroline that his attorney will be in touch with her. Carter tells Rick to be careful what he says now. He needs a little more cooling off period. Rick tells him to be careful also as he knows he is loyal to Ridge. Carter says he is loyal to FC and says Maya is a money hungry Rick stops him and says one more word and he will be gone. He says she is the only one who told him the truth and anybody who has a problem with Rick or Maya can get the hell out. Ridge asks if this is the way he is going to throw his weight around. Rick says if Ridge doesn't like it don't let the door hit him. Rick says he doesn't care what anybody thinks except for his lead model. He asks Caroline to design another piece for Maya despite the fact that they already have a show stopper. He wants one that really showcases her beauty. Caroline glares at him then refuses. She says she is not giving up on their marriage but Rick is trying to rub her face in this newest decision and make it as painful as possible. Rick calls a halt to the meeting and tells them to get out. Maya stays and Rick tells her that he is CEO and they will have to learn to respect that. She says she is proud of him. Maya leaves for a little while but comes back with champagne and caviar since they have not celebrated. In time he will forget all this ugliness. He toasts \"to us\". Ridge asks Caroline if she is okay. She thanks him for taking up for her when it looks like Rick is punishing her. She says Rick is leaving her and taking up with Maya. What is she supposed to do? The doctor tells Wyatt and Hope there is not much to see at this stage. They will not be able to tell if it is a boy or a girl and when it is time they will need to let her know if they want to know or keep it a secret. Holding Hope's hand, Wyatt kisses her a few times and looks on in wonder at the picture before then, like a kid on Christmas morning. Liam can't concentrate on work and he texts Hope of how did it go.",
