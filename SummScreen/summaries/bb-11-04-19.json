    "tvmega_recap": "Liam puts the girls to bed and then realizes how late it is. Steffy tells him the girls are out so he can stay as late as he wants. He can only think about that he is surprised that Hope has not called the whole night. She is with Thomas and that does not bode well. Hope is with Thomas who has made the proposal he will give her custody of Douglas if she will give him what he wants. When she has this deer in the headlights look he says or they can forget this. Perhaps she is not as committed to Douglas as he thought she was. He opines she wants to be Douglas's mother and he is his father so it only makes sense that they .Ridge is pacing the floor when Shauna walks in and wants to know what he is doing. He says just waiting for Thomas who is upstairs with Hope still. Liam confides in Steffy that his dad has laid down hints and he thinks he wants him to come back to Spencer Publications. She says that is his birthright and she thinks he really should forgive his father and join him again at work. Hope feigns a sore back and Thomas guides her to the couch and starts massaging her neck. He says he never thought they would be like this and not in his bedroom. She makes specific mention that others are in this house and it is better than staying at Vinny's. Here he has Ridge, Eric, Quinn all watching out for Douglas. As he eases up she says the soreness is a little further over convincing him to keep massaging. Ridge calls Brooke and says the party has been over for a while but Hope is still here and in fact up in Thomas's room. He just hopes she is not trying to push the adoption papers on him again. Brooke says oh no, she is sure she is not. She says Donna is there so she better go. But she misses him. He tells her please do not let their children divide them again. Steffy thanks Liam for bringing Beth over and for the hundredth time he reminds her that he will always be in her life. She gets a phone call and puts it down right away but Liam realizes it must be a dating site. She covers by saying she might not need a man in her life but sometimes she does need a man. Thomas finishes his massage and asks Hope if that is easing her tension. Then he wants to get right back to the thought at hand. He puts himself closer to her as Hope has moved away a little. He tells her that her skin is so soft and leans in to kiss her neck. She pulls away and he says he must have been getting mixed signals. Hope says no she did not mean to. She does want to help raise Douglas but she and Liam will eventually get married and she has Beth with him and will live with them and co-parent Douglas with Thomas. No he wants more. He wants to be the man in her life. She has what she wants, he will have what he wants. They can be adults about this and even seal the deal tonight. Liam is besides himself if there is a whole new person in Steffy's life. And if it is not the first date there will be another. Any man on the planet would want her. She says she will not be with anyone who does not understand how important Liam is to her. Shauna tells Ridge that she wishes he did not have these issues with Brooke. She would be on her side if it were her in those overpriced shoes. She tells Ridge goodnight. Thomas repeats to Hope they can make everything right tonight. She interrupts and says she wants to help raise Douglas with him but anything else is not an option. He says he is on to her. He knows why she came tonight. And anything less than her is no option for him either. So she can go now. It was fun and perhaps they can do it again another time with Douglas. Bring the papers. She looks hopeful but then he asks for one last hug. He won't bite her ..unless she wants him to. He hugs her and whispers again that they can both have what they want tonight.",
