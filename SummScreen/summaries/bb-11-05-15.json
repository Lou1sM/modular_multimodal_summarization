    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Spencer house, Katie prepared for work, but the shirtless Bill didn't think they needed to rush off to work so fast. After joking that he'd get her in trouble with the boss, Katie said it was nice to have extra time with him and Will. Bill replied that when everyone at Spencer did their jobs, he didn't have to spend as much time doing his job.\n\n\nBill felt that if he'd changed his attitude about work sooner, his niece wouldn't be married to and knocked up by Forrester, a man who'd made his daughter the president but made his son beg to be on the design team. Bill wondered how Thomas had gotten on his father's bad side.\n\n\nKatie felt that people might wonder the same about Bill and Wyatt. Claiming it was a different situation, Bill said Wyatt was where he should be -- keeping one eye on his father's investment and the other on his crazy mother.\n\n\nBill planned to be vigilant as long as his family was mixed up with the Forresters. Katie thought Bill's feelings were admirable and sexy, but she was sure everyone was well. Bill insisted that he'd always be leery of dealings with Forrester, and it was his duty to look out for his family.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office at the onset of a meeting, Steffy couldn't believe that Caroline's baby bump had just popped out of nowhere. Steffy wondered why Maya and Rick weren't there. Ivy said they and Nicole would be at home that day, and Wyatt figured they wouldn't see Nicole until the baby arrived.\n\n\nCaroline thought it was wonderful of Nicole to be the surrogate. \"Kid sister carries brother-in-law's baby. How heartwarming,\" Quinn bit out. Ridge said that the story, in the wrong hands, could be trouble. Wyatt stated that if Bill chose the story, he'd want an exclusive. Ridge said Bill wouldn't get it.\n\n\nLiam noted that a spotlight on Maya was a spotlight on Forrester. Ridge said it was a distraction. Quinn assumed that meant Ridge and Caroline wouldn't be talking bout their baby. Steffy stated that there was nothing controversial about their baby. Ridge said they wouldn't talk about it because it was a family matter. Liam pressed the issue because highlighting the family was good for business.\n\n\nThomas asserted that his father had asked them to drop it. Wyatt countered that it made sense from a promotional standpoint. Thomas snapped that Wyatt was getting the Forrester family mixed up with the Spencer family. Ridge told everyone to move on, and he asked the group about the lingerie line.\n\n\nWyatt conveyed that Ivy was no longer modeling. The team decided that they had enough pieces for a showing. According to Caroline, couture was almost complete. Quinn's department was almost done, too, and she attributed it to Ivy's return. Ivy remarked that it would have been a short-lived return if Thomas hadn't saved her on Halloween. Wyatt scowled.\n\n\nRidge said that lingerie, couture, and jewelry were what the new line would be about, and that was all he wanted to see in the press. \"Do I make myself clear?\" he asked. Liam asked if they really wanted to repeat a transgender misconception by asking Maya not to publish her story.\n\n\nRidge felt that Liam had a point. Thomas asked if Wyatt had already leaked it to Bill. Wyatt told Thomas not to drag him into it. Liam felt that it was worth considering, and Thomas countered that it was if they were selling magazines. Liam said he was thinking of Forrester, not magazines. \"While still being a Spencer,\" Thomas concluded.\n\n\nAfter the meeting, some of the staff exited, and Caroline reminded Thomas that she was a Spencer, too. Steffy asked why he'd gone after the Spencers, and Ridge insisted that everyone working there was a part of the \"Forrester family.\" Thomas clarified that not every employee was an actual Forrester -- something Liam and Wyatt seemed to have forgotten.\n\n\nThomas wondered who \"he\" thought he was to question Ridge. Ridge replied that \"he\" was their vice president, who did everything Ridge asked him to do. Thomas believed Liam was working an angle to further Bill's empire and added that the brothers were Spencers.\n\n\n\"Okay. Again -- I'm right here,\" Caroline exclaimed in defense of Spencers. Thomas said she was different because she was married to Ridge and had a Forrester growing inside her. Ridge and Caroline exchanged looks, and Ridge said that he and Caroline had an appointment to go to regarding the baby.\n\n\nSteffy told the couple not to let her brother's bad attitude run them off. She reminded Thomas that the families were already entangled --especially due to the new baby. Thomas claimed he didn't have a problem with the Spencers, but \"the boys\" had gotten too comfortable at Forrester. Thomas said the company was a Forrester legacy, and they had a duty to protect it, unlike the Spencers.\n\n\nThomas felt it was his and Steffy's job to make their father and grandfather proud. He claimed that he'd lost sight of it and had made mistakes; however, he'd moved past them. Thomas wanted to make sure the company's future was in the right hands. Caroline said it was a good idea to leave all the negativity in the past and move forward.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline left. Thomas daydreamed about Ivy. Noting his look, Steffy asked who the girl was. She warned that it had better not be Charlotte. Thomas said he'd learned his lesson and wouldn't be with a girl whom Ridge didn't approve of.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that she knew when her brother was involved with someone. Ivy arrived to thank Thomas again for saving her. Steffy's glance shifted between Thomas and Ivy.\n\n\nIn the design room, Liam and Quinn listened to Wyatt mimic Thomas and complain about Thomas taking shots at the Spencer brothers. Quinn agreed that the boss's son had taken shots at them. Liam concluded that Thomas was frustrated about feeling wedged out. As evidence, Liam cited that Ridge and Caroline were having a baby, Ridge had made Liam vice president, and Liam was dating Steffy.\n\n\n\"Of course you're going to make it about you!\" Wyatt replied. Liam smugly asked if Wyatt thought it was about him. Wyatt was certain of it, and Liam reasoned that Thomas probably did have an issue with both of them. Quinn could see why and wondered what Thomas did besides sharpen his father's pencils. Wyatt felt the vendetta against him was personal.\n\n\nQuinn asked what Wyatt had done to Thomas. Wyatt said it was whom he had in his life. \"Ivy?\" the quizzical Liam and Quinn asked in unison. Wyatt asked them if they knew what had happened at the Halloween party.\n\n\nQuinn said Charlie had strung the lights with gum and shoestrings. Wyatt added that one of those lights had almost fallen on Ivy, and Thomas had been there to save her. Wyatt said Thomas had been eyeing Ivy. Quinn asked what Ivy had to say. Wyatt said Ivy was grateful, and he admitted that he was, too, because Ivy could have been hurt.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Wyatt would have preferred if Charlie had saved her. Wyatt said it would have been better. He claimed not to be jealous, but to him, it felt like Thomas was just always there a lot for Ivy. Looking up from his phone, Liam asked if they were still on the Ivy and Thomas thing.\n\n\nWyatt insisted that he had a feeling. Wyatt said he trusted Ivy, and Liam stated that Wyatt just didn't trust Thomas. Agreeing, Wyatt said he was trying to figure out what Thomas was up to.\n\n\n\"He's a Forrester. Yuck! It doesn't even make any sense,\" Wyatt complained. Wyatt said that there was no line or boundary Thomas wouldn't cross, especially when he saw something he wanted. Wyatt claimed that Thomas just took things, but Wyatt wouldn't let it happen. Glaring at Wyatt, Liam stated that he hated people like that. \"Shut up,\" Wyatt replied.\n\n\nAt the loft, Caroline rubbed her belly and asked why they'd stopped off there. Ridge asked her to take note of the tranquility. He said he'd taken her to their quiet place to reset and breathe. \"We're going to see our baby,\" he said, and they kissed.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline agreed that the doctor's appointment was important. Ridge promised to be there for all of it, and he said they and the baby were a family. Caroline began to say things hadn't happened the way they'd planned, but Ridge stopped her. He said things rarely did, but they were there and would always be there. He stated that he'd be with her in good times and bad and in sickness and in health.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline kissed. Ridge put his mouth near Caroline's stomach. He told the baby about a princess who'd lived on an island in the east. She'd moved west and met an old, broken knight who hadn't been able to do his job anymore. The princess had fixed the knight, and the knight had vowed to take care of her. \"And that's what he did,\" Ridge concluded, and the song lyric, \"love's masterpiece,\" played.\n\n\n",

That segues way to Nicole, Maya and Rick not being there as they are trying to get pregnant. Quinn quips that sounds so heartwarming.

Steffy laments that Ivy is not going to do the modeling but they still have the lingerie line and ready to go. Ridge wants an update on the jewelry line. Thomas jumps in when Liam wants to consider another idea. Thomas seems to be saying that Liam is a Forrester but he is still a Spencer and thinking of selling magazines too.
