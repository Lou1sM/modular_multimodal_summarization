The women tensely smiled and agreed to do all they could to drive the event's success.\n\n\nIvy received a message and left to deal with something at the sky lounge. Caroline and Ridge arrived to sit in on the meeting. Rick asked if someone had copied them on the memo. No one had, so Rick told them that their presence wasn't necessary. Ridge asserted that he still wanted to know the plans, and Caroline said she'd heard that Rick wouldn't be going to Amsterdam.\n\n\nRick stated that Hope would be handling the photo shoot, and that was all they needed to know. Carter offered to fill the designers in, but Rick found it unnecessary. Caroline asked Hope about a jewelry piece that should go on the trip. Hope said it wasn't going, and Rick loudly interjected that everything had already been approved and packed for the trip. \"Approved by you?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nRick stated that he was the CEO, but Ridge contended that he was the designer and should be consulted on creative aspects. Rick replied that Ridge would be -- if needed. \"You're not,\" Rick stated. Caroline asked Rick not to be that way because they had to work together. Rick said that were working together, but he needed Caroline and Ridge to leave so that he could finish his meeting.\n\n\nLater, the meeting ended, and aside, Maya accused Carter of telling Ridge about the meeting. Carter replied that the photo shoot wasn't a secret, and the whole company knew about it.\n\n\nNearby, Rick was confident that Wyatt and Hope could handle the photo shoot. Hope stated that Caroline had had a point earlier, but Rick assured his sister that \"it\" wouldn't be a distraction.\n\n\nEveryone left Rick's office but Maya, who asked Rick not to let Caroline and Ridge get to him. Rick said Ridge couldn't barge into Rick's office at will. Maya stated that Caroline wasn't welcome either.\n\n\nMaya tried to sell Rick on the idea of getting away to Amsterdam, but Rick said he had to stay home and work. Maya contended that it would be work, and they could also visit Brooke in Milan. Maya figured it was the beauty of having a private jet, but Rick replied that, even though he'd love to travel with Maya, it was more important for him to stake his claim at Forrester.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Caroline paced, explaining why the jewelry piece that Hope had said wasn't going on the trip was so important for a particular design. Ridge replied that a designer would know that. Caroline stated that Rick couldn't shut them out because he needed them.\n\n\nRidge concluded that Rick wanted Caroline to pay at home and at the office. She asked if Ridge and Katie were okay. \"She'll be okay,\" Ridge responded. Caroline couldn't believe Rick was leaving her for a gold-digging opportunist.\n\n\nLater, Carter was working in Rick's old office alone when Maya entered. She said that she needed his help in getting Rick and Caroline's marriage annulled that very day.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Rick saw a white handkerchief slip between his doors. Caroline entered. He asked if she thought it was funny because he didn't. She said it had gotten her in the room. Rick asked what she wanted. Caroline wanted another chance but would settle for the answer to one question. \"How did we get here?\" she asked. He figured she could answer that question on her own.\n\n\nCaroline asked if what they'd had was worth saving or if it had ever meant anything to Rick. She didn't know how he could be so cold to her. Rick said he had to work with her, but he didn't have to like it. She couldn't stand to face each day without seeing him. Rick suggested that she work from home, but she told him that he wouldn't be so upset if he didn't care. She was sorry she'd messed up, but she stated that she wasn't the one who'd walked away.\n\n\nCaroline was furious that she'd made just one mistake, and Rick had let Maya pounce. Caroline told him to let go of whatever he had with Maya, and he and his wife would work it out. Caroline loved him and implored him to return to home. Rick's eyes reddened with tears, but his jawline was still rigid.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Liam was awaiting Ivy, who he assumed couldn't leave on her trip without a goodbye to him. Ivy replied that she actually wanted him to rush home, pack, and go with her. Liam said she'd be very busy launching her line. She replied that having him in Amsterdam would put her at ease.\n\n\nUnder Liam's questioning, Ivy revealed that Wyatt and Hope would be going, but Rick had to remain in town. Liam said that he loved the idea of traveling with Ivy, but he wasn't up for a big Dutch adventure with Hope and Wyatt. Ivy promoted the idea of Liam covering the event for Spencer and bragged that she could get him an interview with the head jewelry designer.\n\n\nLiam cringed while thinking of being stuck in a jet with Hope and Wyatt, but Ivy said it didn't have to be awkward. Ivy claimed that she and Hope had talked, and Hope didn't want to cause problems for Liam and Ivy. Instead, Hope was focused on her future with Wyatt. Liam said that Ivy made it hard to decline, and she suggested that he make it easy on himself by giving in. Liam gasped and agreed to go.\n\n\nLater, Ivy was heading toward the exit when Hope arrived. Hope believed that the trip could be a step forward for her and Ivy. Hope felt that the jewelry line deserved the best attention they could get it. Ivy, too, looked forward to the trip and said the four of them would have fun. Hope replied that it would be three, not four.\n\n\nIvy explained that she hadn't wanted to be a third wheel around Hope and Wyatt, so she'd invited someone. Hope braced herself and hoped the person was John. Ivy replied that Liam would be meeting her at the jet, and Hope asked if Liam understood that Hope and Wyatt would be there.\n\n\nIvy said Liam hadn't liked the idea at first, but he'd changed his mind. Hope asked if Ivy had changed it. Ivy said she'd told Liam about her talk with Hope, and Ivy reminded Hope that they'd just said it was a good time to move forward. Hope asked Ivy if she thought that the four of them on a jet would be hard. Ivy figured Liam wouldn't have agreed if he'd felt that way.\n\n\nIvy told Hope to let Liam move on and accept that he was headed into a relationship with Ivy. Hope stated that Ivy hadn't said anything about the new couple taking a trip together, and Hope wasn't comfortable with it. Ivy said that they all needed to find a way to move beyond it like Rick had said. Hope corrected that Rick had meant work and doing what was best for the line.\n\n\nIvy asserted that Hope was married and expecting a child, and Ivy was starting a new relationship with Liam. It was an exciting time for them all, and Ivy felt that they should be able to be happy for each other. Ivy really thought they could get along. Hope said they'd find out.\n\n\nOn the jet later, the pilot was holding up the flight for a last-minute passenger, but Wyatt confirmed that everyone was there. As the pilot tried to explain the last-minute addition to the manifest, Liam hurriedly arrived, and the pilot left to prepare for takeoff.\n\n\nWyatt's nostrils flared, but he smiled and asked why Liam was there. Liam said he was going to Amsterdam with Ivy. Wyatt and Hope exchanged frowns as Ivy and Liam greeted each other.\n\n\nThe plane took off, and Wyatt complained about Hope not telling him that Liam would be on the trip. Hope claimed that there hadn't been time to talk about it. Wyatt asked if she was okay with it, and she said Rick had told them to get along as a team.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that Liam wasn't a part of the team and was just on vacation. Liam chimed in to say that he was there to make sure Ivy got the coverage she deserved. Wyatt claimed that it was his job as the marketer to do that. Hope decided that Wyatt needed to go to bed and ushered him into the back sleeping compartment. She stared at Liam before joining Wyatt. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Rick tells the group that nothing changes, he will not be with them this time like in Paris but Amsterdam will be looking forward to them. He wants no tension between Ivy and Hope; Ivy says no problem. Rick does not invite Ridge or Caroline and they walk in wanting to know why they were excluded. Rick says Ridge is not needed, Rick is CEO now and he made the decisions. He says they have to finish their meeting so he needs them to leave. Ivy slips off and asks Liam if he will come with her. Liam says this is not just a photo shoot but the launching of her new line so she will be super busy. Also Wyatt and Hope, he and Ivy, he doesn't think this is a super idea. She says he could make an exclusive interview out of this. This does not have to be awkward. She had a chat with Hope and she is busy with her future with Wyatt so it won't be awkward. He says she makes it hard to say no. He finally says yes, Amsterdam here they come. Hope catches up with Ivy and says there is so much tension in the office but she thinks this trip will be good for the three of them. Ivy says four, she has invited Liam. Hope does not have a smile on her face. She simply says she was surprised by this. She thinks Ivy talked him into it. Ivy says she thought this was a chance for the four of them to move on. They have talked about this and they agreed Liam needs to move on. Hope says she is not exactly comfortable with this. Ivy says this is an exciting time for all of them and surely they can all get along on a plane for a few hours. She really thinks they can do this. Hope says she guesses they will find out. Maya tells Rick not to let Caroline and Ridge bother him. And if he needs to go to Amsterdam then he should; she could go too. Take the jet, give good press and just hop around. He informs her that he is not leaving L.A. The most important thing he can do now is stay here and stake his claim. Wyatt is the last one to know that Liam is coming along when he comes onboard. Wyatt tells Hope that he wishes she could have given him advance notice. Yes he was on phone the entire time but she could have pantomimed it to him. Maya seeks out Carter and tells him they have to get Caroline and Rick's marriage over today. Caroline goes to see Rick and says she just has one question. How did they get here? She knows she hurt him and she is sorry but he won't listen to that. Surely what they had means something to him. He says they have to work together but he doesn't have to like it. She laments she can hear the distain in his voice. She wants him back. He does care too otherwise he would not be acting like this. She is furious. She made one mistake and they are going to work this out so he better get Maya out of their lives. She wants him to come home.",
