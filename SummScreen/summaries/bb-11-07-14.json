Quinn claimed to have a busy day ahead, and he asked if she had grand theft or larceny on the agenda. She asked him if he'd ever been to Amsterdam, and he hoped she wasn't really thinking of going there. Quinn was tempted but said she didn't have to go when she had \"this\" to fawn over.\n\n\nQuinn handed Deacon a sonogram photo and told him to take a look at his grandchild. He assumed that she'd crashed the sonogram, and she admitted that she'd gotten busted posing as a nurse in scrubs. Quinn said Hope had been angry, but she couldn't keep Quinn away from her granddaughter. He asked if the baby was a girl. Quinn didn't know, but she had a feeling that it was.\n\n\nQuinn relayed that she'd spoken to Wyatt, and he'd realized that Hope couldn't keep Quinn away from her grandchild. Quinn thought of sending Liam the sonogram as a reminder to stay away from Hope. Deacon guessed Quinn hadn't heard that Ivy had taken a friend with her on the Amsterdam trip. Chuckling, he asked Quinn to imagine Hope, Wyatt, Ivy, and Liam together on the jet.\n\n\nIn Quinn's view, Liam and Ivy together was exactly what Hope needed to see. Deacon hoped that Quinn wasn't going to fly over there to push Ivy into a canal. Quinn dismissed the idea but decided that Wyatt, on the other hand, needed to take action to ensure that Liam moved on with Ivy.\n\n\nOn the jet, Liam and Ivy were having coffee when Hope and Wyatt emerged from their compartment. The foursome exchanged forced polite greetings, and Hope looked away when Liam saw her staring at him. As Hope and Ivy discussed work, Wyatt received a text message from Quinn.\n\n\nLiam rolled his eyes as he listened to Wyatt ask Hope if they were being realistic. Hope insisted that Quinn wouldn't be anywhere near them. \"I freaking hope not,\" Liam uttered, and Wyatt scowled.\n\n\nWyatt discussed the location and studio shots they'd do. Liam said he'd been getting messages from Spencer that the shoot was creating buzz. Wyatt anticipated it would be greater when the diamond appeared in the boutique as a tie-in with Ivy's line. Wyatt said that his mom was good, but Ivy's designs were holding their own.\n\n\nDuring the conversation, Wyatt kept making references to the last shoot in Paris. Liam sat with Wyatt to review the itinerary, and Ivy asked if Hope was okay with all the talk of Paris. Hope frowned, and Ivy stated that she wanted everyone to get along with no jealousy or drama. Hope agreed, saying work was her main focus. Hope hopped from her seat, and Ivy studied Hope as she stared into space.\n\n\nDutch music played as a montage of Amsterdam appeared on the screen. At the Dam Square, a Mercedes pulled up, and out of it popped Wyatt, Hope, Liam, and Ivy. They met with Lars, the coordinator, and Liam noted that the square had once been a dam. Lars elaborated that, once, it had dammed the Amsteel River, and from that was born the city's name of Amsterdam.\n\n\nWyatt noted that the dam was Lars's location for the photo shoot. Lars offered to show everyone around the city. Each with an arm around the other, Ivy and Liam followed Lars, and Hope observed their closeness. Wyatt smiled uneasily at Hope when she turned her eyes from the couple to him.\n\n\nLater, the group reached the Amsteel River. Hope exclaimed that she saw why the city had been dubbed the Venice of the North. Lars remarked that the city had over 100 kilometers of canals, and over ninety islands linked by twelve hundred bridges. As the trio neared Ivy and Liam, who were waiting on a bridge, Ivy said that the last thing they needed was more bridges.\n\n\nHope caught Liam's stare. He glanced away, and she did too. Wyatt's phone rang. He stepped off to the side and answered a call from Quinn, who wanted to know how Hope felt about Liam's presence. Wyatt relayed that Hope wasn't thrilled. Quinn advised him to do something about it. He got upset, but she ordered him to ensure that Liam hooked up with Ivy and left Hope and Wyatt alone.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Wyatt wanted her to fly there and show him what to do. He didn't want that. She said the last string between Hope and Liam had to be cut, and Wyatt shouldn't be afraid to make waves.\n\n\nWyatt curtly cut off the phone call in time to hear Ivy asking Liam how romantic a canal boat ride would be. \"Make some waves...\" Wyatt thought to himself and grinned. Wyatt strode over to Lars, who was waving at his boat captain as the boat cruised beneath the bridge.\n\n\nWyatt was surprised to hear that the boat belonged to Lars. Lars was proud of his circa 1930s boat and asked if Wyatt wanted to use it with Hope. Wyatt revealed that he wanted to set up a romantic outing for Liam and Ivy. \"Like a love boat,\" Lars replied, and Wyatt agreed, repeating the phrase.\n\n\nIn Rick's old office, Carter was talking to Caroline, but she wasn't listening. He asked if she'd talked to Rick. Caroline stated that she had, but Rick hadn't returned home the previous night. Caroline said that Rick was shacking up with Maya, and Caroline had played right into her foe's \"gold-digging hands.\" She asked Carter what to do. He didn't know, but he didn't expect her to let go.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Maya breezed in and greeted Rick with a kiss. At his lukewarm response, she guessed that he was still thinking about Caroline. Maya figured that his wife had pleaded her case about how much the marriage meant to her. Rick replied that it had meant a lot to both of them.\n\n\nMaya contended that it had only meant something to Rick. Rick relayed that, the previous day, Caroline had said she wanted to work it out, but Maya asked if \"it\" meant Caroline's infidelity and unfaithfulness. Rick didn't think things with Ridge had gone that far.\n\n\nMaya insisted that it would have if she hadn't spoken up. She asked Rick if he wanted a woman who he couldn't trust or one who loved and supported him. She said he couldn't go back, and he needed to officially end the marriage.\n\n\nLater, Maya went into Rick's old office to find out from Carter what Caroline wanted for a settlement. Carter said Caroline was entitled to half of everything Rick owned and asked how it would look to Maya if her married boyfriend lost half of everything -- and possibly half of Forrester.\n\n\nMaya didn't find it funny. Carter told her to relax because Caroline didn't want anything, and divorce \"never came up.\" Maya quipped that it had better \"come up\" because she'd told Carter that she wanted the marriage annulled that very day. Carter said he was a corporate attorney. Maya didn't care; she wanted it done. Carter told Maya that it wasn't like canceling a hair appointment.\n\n\nMaya warned that Carter shouldn't fight her on it, and Carter asked if that was a threat. \"From the future Mrs. Rick Forrester,\" she stated. Carter scoffed, and she said Rick depended upon her to get things done. \"Well, you did him in. There's no question about that,\" Carter quipped.\n\n\nMaya claimed that Rick needed to be free of Caroline, but Carter corrected that Maya needed Rick to be free of his spouse. Carter asserted that Rick's love for his wife scared Maya to death.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Caroline slipped in to place something on the desk. When she turned to slip back out of the room, Rick entered. Rick asked if she and Ridge were at it again. Caroline just stood, silently sulking. Rick apologized but said that whenever he saw her, he always thought of Ridge.\n\n\nCaroline stated that she'd tried to slip in and slip out so Rick didn't have to see her. She didn't want to cause him further grief. He appreciated that. She tearfully asked if he'd spent another night with Maya, and he indicated that Maya was helping him cope. \"I'm sure she's loving that,\" Caroline quipped.\n\n\nRick was thankful that Maya had his best interest at heart. \"No, Maya has Maya's best interest at heart,\" Caroline retorted. He contended that he could at least trust Maya, who hadn't stabbed him in the back like Caroline had.\n\n\nOutside the door, Maya listened in as Caroline expressed how deeply sorry she was for what she'd done. Caroline asked if they could chalk it up to a few bad days, but Rick replied that it wasn't that simple. She agreed, asserting that they each had to learn to forgive. \"Me and Ridge kissing and you and Maya -- she's just using you. She's an opportunist, and you're smart enough to see that!\" Caroline said. She declared that she loved Rick, and she knew that he loved her, too. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope, Wyatt, Ivy and Liam on the jet wake to small talk of how their sleep went and how exciting it is going to Amsterdam. Wyatt gets a text from his mom. He tells Ivy that his mom was good at her designs but Ivy's are definitely holding up. They have a smashing photo shoot on the streets which will be romantic and later in the studio. While Wyatt shows Liam the itinerary, Ivy asks Hope how she is feeling and she doesn't want this to remind her of Paris, no drama or angst. Hope says of course not; she is completely focused on this. Caroline confides in Carter that Rick did not come home again last night. He is shacking up with Maya and she has her money hungry claws in him and there is not much Caroline can do about it. Carter asks Maya what does she want to know. He tells her the lady has her rights and in California she could get half of what Rick has. Maya doesn't think this is a laughing matter, he can't let that happen. Carter says it won't happen as Caroline wants nothing; she does not want the divorce. Maya says he better make it happen. She wants that annulment today. She does not want him to fight her on this. She will be the future Mrs. Rick Forrester. Rick is in a lot of pain and he needs to be free of Caroline. He tells her she is the one in pain and it scares her to death. Quinn shows Deacon the pix of the ultrasound.

Wyatt talks to Lars and finds out he has a boat on the canal and wonders if he might use it as sort of a Love Boat for Ivy and Liam.",
