Bill and Steffy coughed as dust encircled them, and they heard a wall collapse nearby. Steffy stumbled, and Bill held her up. They continued to move ahead, but the building shook.\n\n\nSteffy stopped and gasped. She could see red hair sticking out from underneath a slab of fallen concrete. Steffy assumed it was Sally. She pointed in fear and begged Bill to help. \"Do something,\" Steffy cried. Bill moved concrete and cleared away debris to find it wasn't Sally. It was a mannequin. \"Oh, my God, we've got to find them,\" Steffy screamed. Bill and Steffy called out to Sally and Liam.\n\n\nIn another part of the partly demolished Spectra building, Sally and Liam were unconscious and nearly buried to their chests under the building debris with a huge slab of concrete on top of them. Sally started to cough, and it startled Liam awake.\n\n\nSally and Liam wondered if anyone knew they were there. Liam said that he was sure his father had seen them return to the building. They both started to call out for help. Sally stopped and told Liam that she had meant what she'd said earlier. \"I love you, Liam. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I don't regret any of it,\" she said. She started coughing again, and suddenly Liam and Sally could hear Bill and Steffy calling to them. Sally and Liam screamed for help, and Bill and Steffy followed the sounds of their voices.\n\n\nBill climbed over building debris and told Liam to keep yelling so they could follow the sound. However, the building was creaking, and Steffy and Bill had to dodge concrete dust and debris falling from above. They got closer to Liam and Sally, but they could only see their feet at first.\n\n\nBill wanted to see if Liam could move something, but Liam advised Bill to be careful. Neither he nor Sally could move their legs, and Liam warned Bill to avoid dislodging a beam above them because if it collapsed, they would all die. \"We can't move,\" Liam said. Liam and Sally both said they were in pain, but their legs were numb. Steffy cried, and Bill had a plan to get Sally out because she was easier to move.\n\n\n\"Everybody calm down,\" Bill ordered. He and Steffy lodged a beam under the concrete slab that covered Sally. Bill used the beam as a lever and pushed the concrete up high enough for Steffy to pull Sally to safety.\n\n\nBill and Steffy tried to do the same thing again on the slab that was on top of Liam, but Liam said it was too heavy for them. They needed to wait for backup. Bill agreed and called to tell rescuers he had found Liam and Sally. Bill worried that they couldn't wait long because the building was rapidly falling apart. Liam ordered his dad not to be a hero. He didn't want them all to die there. Bill refused to leave his son.\n\n\nFirefighters showed up, and with Steffy and Bill's assistance, they got Liam out from under the concrete slab. Bill pulled Liam to safety, and they embraced. Steffy was shaking and embraced Liam. The building shook, and everyone coughed. Steffy hugged Liam, and Sally watched. Liam and Sally locked eyes, and Bill looked at both of them. The firefighters warned that they had to get out of the building fast.\n\n\nOutside, Justin looked through binoculars to see if he could spot Bill or Steffy. Darlita, Saul, and Shirley were angry with Bill and Justin. The trio warned that Liam and Sally had better get out alive. \"You murdered them! How could you?\" Darlita screamed. She pounded on Justin's chest and arms, and Saul pulled her away. Shirley insisted they had to be positive, and she was sure Sally would get out.\n\n\nSaul wondered what they would do if Sally didn't make it out. Shirley refused to allow Saul or Darlita to think like that. Darlita agreed and claimed that Sally had nine lives. The trio again asked Justin for some word, but he had none.\n\n\nDarlita, Saul, and Shirley wondered why Sally and Liam had returned to the building, and Shirley said that she would make Bill Spencer pay if anything happened to Sally. A firefighter showed up and told Justin, Darlita, Saul, and Shirley that it was horrible inside the unstable building. He reported that they had pulled Sally out, and she had no broken bones.\n\n\nShirley hugged the fireman and asked about Liam, but the firefighter said rescuing Liam was more complicated because the building was going to cave in. They could only work so long without losing members of the rescue team and the victims.\n\n\nAt Spencer Publications, Wyatt and Katie wondered if there was any news about Liam and Sally, and they were both distraught. Wyatt called Justin, and Justin said he didn't have any news. Justin added that Steffy and Bill had gone in to look for Sally and Liam. Wyatt said he was going to join them, but Justin insisted that Wyatt had to stay in the office. Wyatt disagreed, but Justin explained that it was a dangerous situation, and if things turned out badly, someone had to be able to effectively communicate with the public. \"You have to listen to me, Wyatt,\" Justin said. He added that Bill would want Wyatt to stay put and handle things from Spencer.\n\n\nWyatt countered that he could do that from the Spectra site, but Justin explained that they couldn't even get close to the building. Wyatt wanted to know more, but Justin knew nothing. They hung up, and Wyatt bellowed at Alison to get the fire chief on the phone. He wanted to know what was happening.\n\n\nWyatt and Katie embraced, and Katie couldn't believe what Bill had done. Katie told Wyatt they had to have faith. Wyatt said he couldn't lose his brother, and he flashed back to the Spencer reunion in Bill's office when Bill had embraced his boys and said they were a new and better Spencer 2.0. Wyatt worried that Bill, Steffy, Liam, and Sally were all in danger.\n\n\n",

They keep looking and soon Steffy spots what she thinks is a body .it turns out to be a mannequin.

They are still trying to get them all out but they are trapped for now. Liam tells Bill to get Sally first. Bill and Steffy take a long plank to make leverage so a beam will move and allow her out. Then it's Liam's turn but his is a little more tricky without risking more falling on him. Wyatt tells Katie the rest may have to get out. The rubble will only hold up for so long. The crew tells Grams that too. It's only a matter of time before it all comes down with the weight. Bill tries again and makes a little headway pulling Liam free just in time for another beam to come crashing down. With a lot of fuss being made Liam looks toward Sally and locks eyes with hers.",
