    "imdb": "\nNick sticks to his outrageous demand that the family must sell control over Forester to him to keep Stefanie out of jail. Brooke warns him it won't work at any level. The lawyers speculate a trial by jury could go either way, but publicity might wreck the company anyhow. Jacqueline tells Bridget that's her revenge wish, stirring memories of her own brief affair with Nick.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nick holds firm and tells the Forrester's that his mother is lying in a hospital bed not knowing what tomorrow will bring and selling him Forrester Creations is a small price to pay for what Stephanie did. It might not seem so bad if she looks at him as the man that can keep her out of prison. Ridge tells Nick they have all listened to his ridiculous pitch, and the answer is no. Nick answers that this is NOT blackmail, it's a fair deal. He suggests Stephanie sit behind that desk and draw up a sale's contract. Otherwise the entire stake in her family's company is right there in his hands. Brooke finally speaks up and reminds him that she owns controlling interest in the company. He corrects that \u0096 she has the 50% Stephanie gave her, but the 2% from Taylor was bought in Marone Industry's name. As long as they are married, it's hers, but if that situation changes, he will keep it. Ridge assures Stephanie that every Forrester resource will be used to keep her from going to jail. Dr. Hillman tells Jackie he can prescribe her more pain killers. Bridget visits and Jackie tells her that Stephanie pushed her and even gloats that Nick is going to make sure she pays for it. Her headache gets worse and Bridget calls for more pain killers. She advises Jackie to let go of these other factors and just concentrate on recuperating. Bridget has bittersweet memories and wishes she and Nick could start over again. Stephanie visits Jackie in hopes that she will be more fair and reign in Nick. But, it is all too obvious that Jackie won't accept any apology when she calls Stephanie a bully and informs her she will never, ever forgive her for this. She steadfastly says she was pushed and she is going to make sure Stephanie is held accountable for it.",
