He wants to move forward and fly to Monte Carlo to get married. Brooke's reaction makes him question her lingering feelings for Ridge again. Meanwhile, Ridge has a heated argument with temporary CEO Quinn and her team of Wyatt and Ivy.

    "tvmega_recap": "Alison tells Bill that the silence is killing her. He should have heard from Brooke by now. He reminds her that it was he that left Brooke at the altar but she will eventually be his wife. Katie stops in on Brooke and she says she still wants Bill as her husband but RJ is standing in the way right now. She wants to right that first. Katie says there is no drama in her life and well ..some things never change. Brooke has two men fighting over her and she can pick who she chooses while Katie reads a book. Brooke laughs that she has always needed a man in her life but she has always wanted to be more like Katie so self sufficient. Katie says now she is back in the game. Bill walks in so Katie leaves. He tells her that he is still pretty pissed that Ridge interrupted their wedding. Brooke says she did not invite Ridge in to do that. It was Bill that left her at the altar. Quinn corrects Ridge. It is not Quinn Fuller .it is now Quinn Forrester. She informs them she wants to go over the fashion show. Ridge finds that hard to believe that she would know anything about fashion. And he points to Wyatt and says he knows nothing about this business so he does not know why he is even here. Quinn says again she thinks Ridge needs to hear her thoughts. She says she wants to highlight the jewelry again as its own commodity. It will be a small part of the show, not focusing on it. He thinks it is the worst idea he has heard. And no he is not going to design for it. Bill tells Brooke that while he left her at the altar, it was she that left him downstairs while he was cooling his jet. He has a plan now. No wedding ceremony. They will start over and he will fire up his jet and they will run off and get married. Quinn says then she wants to be sure they are on the same page. Is Ridge refusing to design for her. She calls for a vote and Wyatt makes it in her favor. Ridge finds that hilarious. He thinks it is asinine and will not be able to look at people and keep a straight face. She asks the others to leave and wants to speak to Ridge. She tells him she knows he does not like her here but he can hold his nose and go along. He tells her he appreciates her sitting in that chair and keeping it warm but he will be back in it soon. She soon will just be another bad chapter in his dad's life of failed relationships. There is only one love of his life and she is not here. Bill tells Brooke that he is only going to ask her one more time does she still have feelings for Ridge. She says her love for Bill has never wavered but she can't answer the question of how she feels about Ridge. Bill says they have waited long enough ..he has waited long enough so he leaves and Ridge just happens to walk into her office the next instant. She tells him Bill came to whisk her away and Ridge wants to know why then is she still here. She says they both left each other at the altar and it was Ridge's fault. He says he is not apologizing. And if Bill is pressuring her just let him know. Maybe that is why Bill just rushed out. Maybe she will change her mind and come back to him and RJ and they will be a family again. He informs her that RJ wants a steak tonight and since Quinn is still at the mansion he expects to do it in Brooke's kitchen, so be ready tonight. Quinn tells Wyatt that Ridge can be gruff at times but she too can be relentless so they should all hang in there. She practices her little speech which Wyatt tells her she must make .Ridge is spying behind the curtain.",
