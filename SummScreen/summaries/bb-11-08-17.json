They discussed how lucky they were to survive the demolition of Spectra. They both coughed and compared aches and pains.\n\n\nThe doctor entered and told Liam and Sally that they had both been \"insanely lucky\" to not have broken bones and to be alive. The doctor added that they would be coughing for a while because of the concrete dust they had inhaled. He added that they should return to the hospital if the coughing brought up blood.\n\n\nThe doctor shared that a crowd of family and friends had been waiting outside the room to see Liam and Sally. The doctor promised to share the good news of their diagnoses with the crowd. A few minutes later, Steffy entered and embraced Liam. She was glad to hear that he was all right. Steffy asked about Sally, and Sally answered that she had received the same good news that Liam had.\n\n\nSally was distraught, and Steffy told her not to worry. She was glad they were both alive.\n\n\nIn the waiting room, Coco, Saul, Darlita, Shirley, and Bill waited for news on Sally and Liam. Saul, Darlita, and Shirley told Bill that he was to blame for everything that had happened. Bill countered that he had never wanted to hurt Liam or Sally.\n\n\nShirley said Bill was a heartless killer. Bill tried to reason with her, but she wouldn't listen. Bill begged all of them to understand. He asked Coco to remember that she worked with Bill's wife Brooke at Forrester. He maintained that Coco had to know he wasn't a heartless killer, or Brooke wouldn't have stayed with him. Coco noted that she thought they were divorced.\n\n\nBill ignored her and promised to set Spectra up on the edge of the fashion district in a newer, \"more compact\" building. Saul countered that their former building had certainly been compacted, thanks to Bill. Bill promised to handle the move, a year's rent, and more. Shirley said they didn't want his help.\n\n\nAfter Bill had received news that Liam was all right, he left the waiting room and entered Liam's room. Liam glared at him.\n\n\nBill quietly said he'd heard the good news from the doctor but had wanted to see Liam for himself to be sure he was all right. \"None of this is all right,\" Liam said. He glared at his dad.\n\n\nBill advised Liam that he wasn't trying to win a popularity contest. Bill reminded Liam that he had seen Liam and Sally leave the building before they had detonated the explosives. Steffy tried to calm them both, but Liam was angry. Bill interrupted and said he wanted to help Sally and her team get back on their feet. He appreciated her pride and respected her talent.\n\n\nSally angrily countered that Bill had killed her past and her future. The Spectra building was where the family had been for generations. It was where they'd held family reunions. Her Aunt Sally had given inspirational speeches there and much more.\n\n\nSteffy and Bill tried to point out that Bill wanted to make amends, but Liam said he had fallen for Bill's tricks before. Liam said he was tired of his dad and his setting fires and blowing stuff up. He encouraged Bill to fire him because Bill had Wyatt, who would always agree with him. Bill wanted Liam to calm down, but Liam was livid. \"You almost killed us. Go home!\" Liam ordered. Bill said he hoped they could pick up the conversation at a later time when Liam had cooled down. Bill left.\n\n\nLater, Liam and Steffy left, and Coco, Saul, Darlita, and Shirley entered Sally's room and expressed how grateful they were that she was alive. They wanted to get her home. Shirley said that \"Mr. Spencer\" had paid Sally's bill.\n\n\nSally wanted to know if it was Liam, but Shirley said it didn't matter. They needed to leave and start over. Shirley encouraged everyone to wait outside for Sally to get dressed. Coco, Darlita, and Shirley left, and Saul stayed. He was emotional and told Sally that he should have been there with her. Sally argued that they could never have let him get hurt because she needed him. Saul kissed her on the head and left. Sally dressed herself but flashed back to kissing Liam.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Katie filled Brooke in on what had happened at Spectra. Brooke couldn't believe Bill had been so careless. Katie explained that Bill was devastated that his son could have died in the building. Brooke wondered how Katie had heard the news, and Katie explained that she had been at Spencer and in Bill's office. She added that Wyatt had told her what had happened.\n\n\nBrooke was glad that Wyatt and Katie had grown so close after the fashion challenge between Spectra and Forrester. Brooke wondered why Bill was so impatient. Katie said that Bill had been remorseful, and she wanted to encourage Bill to try to do the right things. She encouraged Brooke to do the same.\n\n\nAt home, Liam and Steffy snapped at each other over little things. Liam asked if Steffy was mad at him. Steffy said she was trying to be nice, but it had been a draining day. Liam had scared her, and it was all because of Sally.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy argued that Liam was trying help Sally, and his father continued to destroy her and her dream. Liam said that Sally had taken loans on the property to rebuild, and she was left with no way to repay the loans, no building, and no business. Liam felt responsible.\n\n\nSteffy maintained that Liam had gone too far. She said that people like Sally could stand on their own, and Steffy reminded Liam that Sally had stolen from her family's company. Liam started to argue, but Steffy said it had to stop. She called Sally a user. She didn't want to argue, but she wanted it all to end. She was relieved that Liam was all right because she'd thought he was dead. They embraced, and Liam flashed back to kissing Sally.\n\n\nAt home, Bill, still dressed in his tattered shirt and covered in dirt, poured himself a drink, but he was shaking too much to drink it. Brooke entered and asked if he was all right. Bill thanked her for visiting him and said that he and Liam had made peace at one time. Bill was devastated and emotional. Bill wondered if he and Brooke could start over.\n\n\nBrooke was shocked that Bill had not checked to see where Liam had been before he'd demolished Spectra. Bill explained that he had been told the building was empty. Bill blamed Liam for siding with the Spectras and not with his own family. Bill said that Liam had almost gotten himself killed.\n\n\nBrooke defended Liam. She said he was a gentle and compassionate young man, and Bill could have learned something from him. Bill tried to defend himself, but Brooke stopped him. \"Bill, you almost killed him,\" she said. She added that Liam was standing up for something that was honorable, \"not having a tantrum.\"\n\n\nBill said that he had accomplished extraordinary things on his own but had problems making the ordinary things work. Brooke blamed his violent behavior. Bill blamed accidents. Brooke shrugged. \"So many accident happen around you, Bill,\" she said.\n\n\nBrooke encouraged Bill to have more compassion. She said she had planned to honor her vows for the rest of her life. Bill said she still could, but Brooke disagreed. \"Goodbye, Bill,\" she said, and she walked out.\n\n\n",

He tries to explain he was told all had left the building and he will do all he can to get Sally back on her feet. Grams tells him do not think for a minute that they want his help now for his shriveled little conscious. Katie tells Brooke how she heard about the explosion while in Wyatt's office. Brooke does not understand why Bill is so impatient and wants everything right now. Bill goes into Sally's room where Liam is. Bill knows he would not win a popularity contest right now but swears that he thought everyone was out of the building before he pushed the button. Liam says he thought just the fact that they were still there that day might make him think twice and not blow the building. Now he almost killed them so just go home. Bill tells him they will talk again when he has cooled off. Liam says he is as cool as he ever will be. Saul tells Sally that he should have been there but he is glad somebody could be even if it was not him. Grams tells Sally that Bill paid the bill so she will be taking her home when the doctor says so. Steffy takes Liam home. He confides in her that he is Sally's problem as he told her the property was hers so he feels he owes her something besides telling her to get out. Steffy says she hopes he never has to see the pain and fear in Bill's eyes that she just saw before they found Liam. Brooke finds Bill drinking and he thanks her for coming. Things are not good. He explains to her also that he thought the building was vacant before it imploded. He tells her that he and Liam have a clean slate so he does not know why they cannot have one. She says he needs to work on how he treats other people. He fires back that she should hear how Liam talks and treats him. He should be by his side learning the business instead of running around after Sally and taking care of her problems. He tells her that this has been a day from hell and she has no idea how he feels thinking he might be responsible for his own son's death. She walks out and he is stunned. Liam says he does not understand why Steffy is mad at him. She says she is not but he scared her to death. Sally has been nothing but bad news for her family from the beginning and Liam is still trying to help that criminal. She does put her arms around him and says she is glad he is alive and well. All he thinks about is the kiss Sally gave him in the rubble.",
