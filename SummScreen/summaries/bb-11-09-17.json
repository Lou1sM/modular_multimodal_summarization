Steffy had told Wyatt that Liam was sore and coughing but would be okay physically. Wyatt asked how Bill was and how things were with Brooke. The monotone Bill replied that Brooke had written him off.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Brooke understood that what had happened hadn't been Bill's fault, and Bill hadn't known that Liam had run back into the building. Bill replied that she didn't want to understand it, and Liam was done with Bill also.\n\n\nWyatt asked what had happened between the men at the hospital, and Bill described how Liam had just gone on and on in defense of Sally. To Bill, it was like Sally had \"the hold\" on Liam. Wyatt wondered what that was. \"'The hold,' Wyatt,\" Bill repeated.\n\n\nWyatt repeated it, too, and Bill said Wyatt could see it in the decisions Liam had been making. Before the explosion, everything for Liam had been about propping up Sally and Spectra, and since Sally had lost the building, Bill could only imagine how insufferable Liam would be. Bill said that Sally had become even more pathetic than before.\n\n\nWyatt stated that he was there for Bill. Bill said Wyatt had been a more supportive son than Bill could have imagined. Wyatt felt proud to be Bill's son. Bill had given Wyatt many opportunities and great things in life, and running the company with Bill and Liam was like a dream to Wyatt.\n\n\nBill said that Liam had turned his back on it to continue to play the knight and shining idiot to Sally's damsel in distress. Bill was sure nothing good would result from it.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Liam flashed back to Sally kissing him. Steffy entered, saying that Ridge had messaged to check on Liam. She'd told her father that Liam was the luckiest man alive. Steffy hugged Liam tightly, and he assured her that he was okay. She asked if he really was after all he'd been through.\n\n\nCoughing, Liam complained about Bill leveling the building. Liam believed Bill never should have done it and hadn't considered Liam's compromises. Liam felt that it had been an obsession for Bill. Steffy asked about Liam's obsession with defending Sally at every turn.\n\n\nSteffy stated that Liam had staged a sit-in, something she'd known would end badly, and she could have lost him. \"And for what? For Sally Spectra?\" she asked.\n\n\nLater, Liam wished things could be different between Bill and him, but they wouldn't be after what had happened. Steffy stated that emotions had run high, and Liam needed to return to the place of forgiveness he'd been in with Bill a few days prior. Liam couldn't do that because he no longer trusted Bill, who'd almost killed Liam and Sally.\n\n\nLiam believed it had all been preventable, but Dollar Bill couldn't cave in to a sit-it and had to win at all costs. Bill would get to build his skyscraper and bask in his ego, but Liam didn't want any part of it -- especially if it went against what Liam stood for, which was righting wrongs like that. \"Wrongs done to Sally Spectra in particular?\" Steffy asked.\n\n\nSteffy said that Sally was a woman Steffy had strong feelings about, a woman who'd crossed many lines and would do so again. Steffy asserted that Liam didn't trust Bill, and she didn't trust Sally. Steffy understood that Liam had gone through something intense with Sally. Steffy was glad that Sally was okay, but Steffy didn't want him to feel like he had to keep helping Sally.\n\n\nSteffy understood that Liam had been a friend to Sally --- a really good friend -- but Steffy thought it was time to kiss Sally goodbye. Liam stared around awkwardly and decided that he needed to leave.\n\n\nLater, Steffy arrived at Bill's house and said Alison had told her that he'd left for the day. Bill said he hadn't been getting a lot done. He'd thought she'd be with her husband. Steffy said Liam had gone out, so she'd decided to check on Bill. Bill stated that he was fine and dandy. He poured himself a drink, but he caught a glimpse of a photo of Liam and slammed the drink down.\n\n\nSteffy said she was trying to get through to Liam because the Spencer family had to heal. \"What's left of it,\" Bill quipped. He told Steffy that Brooke had been there to let him have it for almost blowing up Liam and Liam's favorite redhead. Steffy asked if he'd explained that it had been an accident. Bill said it hadn't made a difference, and he and Brooke were finally over.\n\n\nBill pulled off his wedding band and tossed it on a table. Steffy said she was sorry. Bill was, too. He was sorry that Brooke couldn't be more understanding like Steffy. Steffy said she and Brooke were very different, but Brooke loved him despite everything. Bill thought Steffy could be right, but he said Brooke hadn't been able to be there for him when he'd needed her support; however, Steffy had.\n\n\nSteffy believed it might be because Brooke hadn't seen what Bill had gone through firsthand the way Steffy had. She said Brooke had walked away before it had all happened. He remarked that Steffy was incredible; she didn't judge and tried to see all sides. Steffy just wanted peace in the family. She felt that the Spencer men needed to value and appreciate their differences instead of using them against each other.\n\n\nSteffy conveyed that Bill was a renegade, but Liam was sensitive. She loved Liam for being committed, especially to their marriage. Bill asked how she could be so wise. She said she had a marriage with a strong foundation. Because of Liam, she could see the goodness in people. He'd opened her eyes to the importance of devotion and trust in a relationship, especially a marriage. She believed that Bill and Liam would get their loyalty and trust back.\n\n\nAt Sally and Coco's place, Sally flashed back on telling Liam that she loved him. Coco entered with a tray of Sally's favorites for breakfast. Coco was relieved that she hadn't lost her sister, best friend, and roommate, but she'd never forgive Bill for the loss of Spectra.\n\n\nThe sisters discussed borrowing some jelly from the lady across the hall who had six cats, all named Zoe, and Coco suggested that they get a pet from the shelter. Coco asked if Liam was still involved with the shelter. Sally wondered how her sister knew that, and Coco replied that Steffy had to have mentioned it -- or R.J. Coco said it was another wonderful cause that Liam championed besides Spectra -- and Sally.\n\n\nSally revealed that she'd been afraid she'd die after the explosion, and she'd said what she'd had to say to Liam in case those trapped moments had been her last. Coco had read that people in life-threatening situations sometimes shared things they normally wouldn't. Coco asked if that was what had happened between Sally and Liam.\n\n\nJust then, Liam knocked on the door. Coco answered the door and took off to see if the cat lady had any jam. Once alone with Liam, Sally assumed he was there about the kiss. She claimed to get it and said it had never happened.\n\n\nLiam said Sally's name, but Sally cut him off to express that the circumstances had been crazy and frightening. She said young people didn't think of dying and took risks. Liam took full responsibility for the sit-in because it had been his idea. Sally didn't blame Liam, who'd been in her corner the way no one ever had before.\n\n\nLiam was sorry he hadn't been able to stop Bill. Sally was, too, but she said they'd given it their all and then some. Liam remarked that the building was gone, but the talent behind it wasn't. He believed she could find a way back from it. Sally doubted it would be in Los Angeles. Liam asked why it wouldn't. Sally said she'd told him she loved him. She recalled that she'd said a lot of things, and though she'd meant them, Steffy didn't need to know.\n\n\nLiam thought Steffy did need to know, and he said he had to be honest with his wife. Sally didn't want him to, but he said he couldn't keep secrets from his wife. Sally believed that Steffy would go nuts if she learned that Liam had kissed Sally.\n\n\nLiam said he'd make Steffy see that it hadn't been Sally's fault, and it had been due to a life-threatening situation. Sally said it was true, but Steffy wouldn't believe that was as far as it had gone. Liam felt he couldn't \"not\" tell Steffy. He stated that he'd already broken the loyalty vow. He wasn't going to break the honesty one, too. \"Even if it will tear your marriage apart?\" Sally asked.\n\n\nLiam didn't believe it would go that way -- at least he hoped it wouldn't. Sally didn't know why he'd take the chance. She said that people had their secrets, and she promised not to breathe a word of it to anyone. She didn't expect anything from Liam and felt only gratitude and respect for him. Liam appreciated it, but he said it wasn't about her.\n\n\nLiam said it was about his principles and the vows he'd made to Steffy. He hadn't been able to sleep the night before. Sally was sorry. She'd never meant to hurt or haunt him. She wanted for him what he wanted -- which was Steffy. Sally just didn't have a good feeling about it and implored him not to tell Steffy.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam thinks about the Sally kiss in the rubble. She is thinking about it too. Coco makes her some lunch for the most important person in her life. Bill asks Wyatt if he has talked to his brother this morning. Wyatt says he was in the shower so he missed the call. Surely Bill knows it was not Liam's and Sally's fault but neither was it Bill's as he thought they had left the building. Bill says Sally is more pathetic than she was before she lost the building. And Liam is right there in his feeling beholden to her. Sally tells Coco that she was really afraid she was not going to make it out of that hole alive and never see Coco again. But Liam is her guardian angel and she had to tell him how she felt. Liam talks about Bill's obsession and Steffy reminds him that he has one too over Sally. She almost lost him because of it. He says he wishes things could be better with his dad over this but he does not see it. She tells him just to go back to his trust and understanding the way he was a few days ago.

She has never had anyone do what he did before in trying to save her. He tells her the building may be gone but the talent is still there. She says maybe but she doubts it will be here in L.A. She says she told him she loved him and said too much and she will keep her mouth shut. Steffy shows up at Bill's and said Liam ran out on her so she thought she would check up on him. He gives his account of Brooke being there and what he said made no difference. This time they are finally over. He takes off his wedding ring and throws it on the table. Steffy says she is sorry. He wishes Brooke could be as understanding as Steffy. He says he will always love her but she could not give him her love and support when he needed it like Steffy does. She does not jump to conclusions like others do. She tells him he is a leader and a renegade but Liam is sensitive and that's why she loves him. Bill wonders how she can be so wise. Liam tells Sally that she will make it absolutely clear to Steffy that none of this was Sally's fault but he can't not tell her. He has broken his loyalty vow and he cannot break this one too. She wonders why he would take that chance. She can take this to her grave. She does not expect anything from him. He is a wonderful man and she wants to do what he wants. But she does not have a good feeling about this \u0096 do not tell Steffy.",
