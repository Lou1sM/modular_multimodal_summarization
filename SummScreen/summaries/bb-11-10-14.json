Quinn hoped the pair could at least get past the hand-holding stage of their relationship. With a kiss, Deacon prodded Quinn to focus on other things.\n\n\nQuinn suggested that she and Deacon take a trip. Deacon told her to stay away from the kids and decided to give her a reminder about behaving. He handed her the sonogram photo, and she grinned at her \"grandbaby.\" He felt that she was her own worst enemy, and she'd ruin Wyatt's marriage by going to Amsterdam.\n\n\nQuinn said that Liam just needed to pull the trigger. Though Deacon didn't think Quinn was wrong, he said she was pushing too hard. He conveyed that giving the kids space didn't mean they would stop being there when the kids needed them. Deacon pleaded with Quinn not to give the kids a reason to shut her out and told her to stay away from Liam and Ivy.\n\n\nDeacon made Quinn promise not to do anything impulsive. She agreed not to go to Amsterdam. He insisted that Wyatt was grown enough to handle it, and she'd score more points by letting him.\n\n\nWhile Deacon was in the shower later, Quinn called the hotel where Liam, Ivy, Hope, and Wyatt were staying in Amsterdam. Upon learning that Ivy and Liam had separate rooms, Quinn claimed it was a mistake. She asked if she could change it to one room for them, but the hotel refused to allow her to.\n\n\nAt the bridge with Lars in Amsterdam, Wyatt set up a romantic boat ride for Liam and Ivy. Hope observed Liam rubbing Ivy's back to keep her warm but cut her eyes away when Ivy caught her staring. Wyatt asked Lars to tell Ivy that it was his idea to give Ivy and her line the boat ride as a Dutch welcome. Lars walked off, and to himself, Wyatt figured the boat ride would do the trick.\n\n\nLiam, Ivy, Wyatt, and Hope strode to the Forrester boutique, where Yvette, the publicist they'd had in Paris, awaited them. Wyatt introduced Yvette to Liam and Ivy, but their reputations had preceded them with Yvette. Yvette wondered why Hope and Wyatt hadn't said they'd planned to marry in Monte Carlo. Hope called it spur-of-the-moment, and the group shared an awkwardly silent moment.\n\n\nYvette said the buzz from the Paris shoot had reached Amsterdam. Wyatt explained that the shoot would be about glamour, beauty, sophistication, and everything Hope, the lead model, represented. \"And Ivy,\" Yvette added, and Wyatt looked puzzled.\n\n\nYvette said that everyone wanted to know who Ivy Forrester was, and it was time for Ivy to put herself in front of the camera. Hope asked if Yvette was suggesting that Ivy model, too. \"Absolutely,\" Yvette replied, and Hope rendered a stiff smile.\n\n\nYvette explained that a mystery surrounded Ivy, who'd avoided the spotlight in the past, and they needed to show a Logan and a Forrester working together. Liam believed that Spencer Publications would love to promote it. Yvette stared expectantly at the hesitant Hope and Wyatt. Wyatt said they'd get back to Yvette on it, and Hope quickly nodded in agreement.\n\n\nYvette left to see to the diamond's arrival, and Liam and Ivy discussed the jewelry on display. Wyatt pulled Hope aside to guess at why she was so quiet. Hope stated that she didn't want Ivy modeling. Even if it was good for the business, Hope didn't want Ivy moving in on her life any more.\n\n\nWyatt's face flattened, and Hope glared at Liam and Ivy as they talked nearby. Hope insisted that Ivy had to stop stepping into Hope's life. Wyatt asked what that even meant. He asked if she meant at work or if they were talking about Liam, too.\n\n\nAcross the room, Ivy observed Wyatt and Hope's intense conversation and told Liam that she knew what it was about. Ivy was sure that Hope didn't want Ivy modeling, and Ivy said Hope might be right. Ivy had never modeled before, and she asked who'd choose to learn at the biggest shoot of the year. Liam said Ivy was fantastic at everything she did.\n\n\nIvy flashed a skeptical look, and Liam took her to a mirror. He said that in the mirror, he saw beauty, poise, and class. He insisted that Ivy had those qualities and \"so much more.\" Ivy doubted Hope would agree. Liam shrugged. Ivy said that she and Hope had discussed removing the tension between them, and it seemed that Hope was having a tough time seeing Liam with Ivy.\n\n\nJust then, Liam's phone chimed, and Liam remembered that he had to take a conference call soon. Ivy suggested that he take it at the hotel, and she'd meet up with him later.\n\n\nOnce the diamond was in its case, Hope stared at it. She flashed back to Liam warning her that Wyatt had given it to her because it had a hold on her. She recalled the Paris shoot, returning the diamond to Wyatt, walking away when Liam hadn't shown up, and seeing Ivy holding on to Liam.\n\n\n\"They shouldn't even be in Amsterdam together,\" Hope told Wyatt. Wyatt figured that it really got to her. He said it was okay, and it had been how he'd felt to see Hope with Liam. Hope tried to apologize, but Wyatt claimed that he wasn't jealous.\n\n\nWyatt and Hope hugged, and he asked her what she wanted to do about Ivy and the photo shoot. Hope figured she would look spiteful if she turned it down. Ivy interrupted to get Hope to join a talk with Yvette. Wyatt decided to go back to the hotel, and after he left, Ivy told Hope that they each knew why Hope was upset. \"You still can't let go of Liam, can you,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nHope claimed not to want to \"go there\" again. Ivy said she had eyes and could see Hope struggling with it. Hope denied it, saying Ivy could be more considerate. Ivy asked how. She didn't feel like she was flaunting her relationship in front of Hope, who'd said from the very beginning that it was too early for Liam to be in a relationship. Ivy asked how much longer before Hope let Liam go.\n\n\nHope claimed to be doing it. She said she was married and pregnant. Ivy asserted that it still bothered Hope to see Ivy with Liam, and that led Ivy to believe Hope still had feelings for him. \"Of course I do!\" Hope yelled. Hope admitted that it hurt to see Ivy and Liam together. Hope wanted Liam to be happy, but it took time. Hope claimed that it would take time to get over what she'd had with Liam, and it was \"too damned bad\" if she wasn't doing it fast enough for Ivy.\n\n\nAt the waterfront hotel, Liam stopped the bellhop as he was taking Ivy's bags into Liam's room. Wyatt arrived in time to observe Liam directing the bellhop take the bags to Ivy's room. Once the bellhop had left, Wyatt asked if Liam wondered if fate was trying to tell him something. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt urges Lars to set up a romantic trip down the canal but not to tell Hope. Just let Liam and Ivy think it is a special Dutch welcome. Quinn confides in Deacon that if Wyatt can set something up maybe it will speed things along from just the handholding stage with Ivy and Liam. She even proposes a trip to Amsterdam for her and Deacon. He shows her a pix of the sonogram of her grandson and how this would be a terrible idea to interfere more. She is her own worst enemy. She will screw up Wyatt's relationship behind the scenes. He says it makes sense to get Ivy and Liam together but she is pushing too hard. She says she can not stand around and do nothing. He says they will always be there for them when they need them, but Wyatt and Hope need space. Let Hope come to her. Eva says Ivy is the mystery behind the jewelry and she should be in front of the camera too. Hope and Wyatt are not exactly for that but say they will get back to her. Hope tells Wyatt that enough is enough and she does not want Ivy moving in on her life anymore. That includes modeling and being with Liam too. She says she is sorry. Wyatt says he is not jealous. She says it's not like she can say no so she will deal with it. Ivy tells Liam that Hope does not want her modeling and to tell the truth she thinks Hope is having a tough time seeing them together. He gets a call that he must go take so he says he will meet up with her later. Quinn agrees with Deacon and says she will not go to Amsterdam. But she does call to make sure that Wyatt and Hope have checked into their rooms.....and then manages to ask if Ivy and Liam have checked in. She is not happy at all to find they have separate rooms and tries to change it for a room together. When Wyatt leaves, Ivy tells Hope that she knows she is still upset that she is along on the trip with Liam as she is not over him yet. Hope says she really does not want to go there again and does not want to hear Ivy's accusations. She just thinks Ivy ought to be a little more concerned. Ivy says from the start Hope said they should give Liam more time to get into a relationship, but how long is that going to take. Hope rails at her that yes it hurts. Yes she still has feelings for Liam and if that bothers Ivy then it's too damn bad. It's going to take more time.",
