Wyatt encouraged Liam to move on, and Liam said he had been working on it. Wyatt noted that Liam and Ivy's luggage had all been delivered to one room, and Wyatt suggested that Liam take that as a sign that he was meant to be with Ivy.\n\n\nWyatt recommended that Liam make a move on Ivy. Liam replied that Wyatt wanted Liam to behave like a caveman. Liam accused Wyatt of trying to be as manipulative as his mother had been. Liam knew Wyatt wanted Liam with Ivy to keep him away from Hope.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that he was worried about Hope. Wyatt knew that Hope hated seeing Liam with Ivy, but Liam had to stop exchanging glances with Hope. \"Leave my wife alone. Respect my marriage,\" Wyatt said. He demanded that Liam do it for the baby.\n\n\nWyatt and Liam discussed that Liam and Hope would always have a connection, but they all knew that their relationship was over. Liam said they'd all had to make serious adjustments in warp time and tried to move forward. Wyatt suggested that Ivy deserved more than Liam had given her, and she needed his attention. Wyatt wanted Liam to focus more on Ivy and less on Hope. \"Keep your eyes off my wife,\" Wyatt commanded.\n\n\nLiam said that he had never intentionally disrespected Ivy, but he realized that he had been making Ivy unhappy in Amsterdam. Wyatt suggested that Liam be more romantic because Amsterdam was one of the most romantic cities in the world. \"Go for it. Make it happen,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\nIn another hotel room in Amsterdam, Ivy and Hope had a similar conversation about Hope and Liam. Ivy said that Hope clearly would not let Liam go. \"Logan women,\" Ivy said coldly. Hope demanded to know what Ivy meant. Ivy explained that Hope and her female family members acted as if they were entitled.\n\n\nIvy said that Hope was a lot like her mother. Hope defended Brooke as an incredible woman, but Ivy suggested that Hope needed to show some strength of her own and let Liam go. Ivy reminded Hope that she was married to a great guy who loved her.\n\n\nHope argued that she was committed to her marriage. Ivy advised her to stop the \"long lingering looks to Liam.\" Hope defended herself and said that she and Liam would always be connected and had been in love for a very long time.\n\n\nIvy challenged that Hope was supposed to be in love with her husband. Hope agreed that she was in love with Wyatt. Hope suggested that Ivy had never been in love -- and that was why Ivy couldn't understand her connection to Liam. \"You just don't turn that off,\" Hope said tearfully.\n\n\nHope gently explained that she was not a threat to Ivy's relationship with Liam. She knew that if it wasn't Ivy that Liam was involved with, it would be someone else. Hope realized she had to get used to it. \"I'm married and pregnant, and grateful for my family,\" Hope said.\n\n\nHope emotionally begged Ivy to understand how Hope felt. She asked for \"a shred of compassion\" because it hurt to see Liam and Ivy together. \"Why the hell did you bring him here, Ivy?\" she asked. Hope explained that Liam was her first love and meant everything to her. \"Liam and I will always be connected. I come with the package. You have to get used to it,\" Hope advised.\n\n\nIvy recommended that Hope needed to think about Wyatt's feelings. She reminded Hope that Hope had made vows. Hope countered that just because she had gotten married didn't mean that she no longer cared about Liam. \"It's hard for me to see him with you, but I promise I am doing everything I can the best way I know how,\" Hope said.\n\n\nHope added that it would take time for her to get over it, and she would, but it had to be in her time -- not on Ivy's timetable. \"So stop being so judgmental,\" Hope said through tears.\n\n\nAt Spencer Publications, Quinn barged into Bill's office, and Bill bellowed at Alison that Quinn was not supposed to be allowed in his office. Quinn noted that Alison was not at her desk. Quinn insisted that Bill needed to help their son maintain his relationship with Hope. Bill refused.\n\n\nQuinn whined that Ivy and Liam had shown up in Amsterdam, and Hope had a hard time getting over Liam. Quinn demanded that Bill help. Bill told Quinn she had to butt out of Wyatt's relationship and get a life.\n\n\nBill softened slightly, and he told Quinn that she had done a great job raising Wyatt. Bill told her it was time to stop trying to manipulate Wyatt's life. He had grown into a wonderful man, and Quinn had to stop her interference.\n\n\nQuinn thanked Bill and reminded him that they would be grandparents together. She wished she hadn't kept Wyatt from Bill, but it had all turned out fine. Quinn worried that Hope had decided to keep Quinn out of her son's life.\n\n\nBill suggested that Quinn had to chill out and leave the kids alone. Bill added that seeing Liam move on with Ivy had to be difficult for Hope. Quinn said that was what had her worried, and they had to help.\n\n\nBill teased that he could buy out a restaurant for a romantic dinner for Liam and Ivy -- all alone. Quinn was elated that he would do that, but Bill said it was never going to happen because they had to leave Wyatt, Liam, Ivy, and Hope alone. Quinn objected, but Bill reminded her that Quinn had destroyed her credibility with Hope. \"It's not okay. She doesn't trust you, and she's afraid of you,\" Bill said.\n\n\nQuinn said she'd had some lapses in judgment, but it was no reason to shut her out of her son's life. She worried that Hope had convinced Wyatt to ignore her. She angrily expressed concern that she would be missing out on milestones in her grandchild's life. \"It's unfair, and it's unacceptable,\" Quinn said.\n\n\nBill rolled his eyes. Bill reminded Quinn of her past transgressions, but she refused to be eliminated from the gene pool. \"You don't listen. Let Hope recover from your latest lapse in judgment,\" Bill commanded.\n\n\nQuinn hadn't been listening. She fantasized about watching Hope deliver a baby. She watched the happy faces of Wyatt and Hope after a nurse placed the baby in Hope's arms. The camera closed in on the face of the baby, and it was Quinn. Hope screamed. Bill shouted at Quinn, because he knew she had not been listening. Quinn insisted she would not be pushed out of her son and grandchild's lives.\n\n\nQuinn left Bill's office, and she called Wyatt. Wyatt told his mother that Liam had been pining after Hope. Quinn vowed to get on a plane and travel to Amsterdam to help him. Wyatt refused her offer. He said that he had rented a boat for Liam and Ivy -- a romantic boat ride. He had to leave, and he hung up on her.\n\n\nWyatt was at the boat, and he spoke to the boat captain about how the evening boat ride should include a lot of romantic interest, and he wanted Liam and Ivy to remain on the boat the entire night. The captain agreed.\n\n\nIn another part of Amsterdam, Liam stood on a bridge and looked over the water. He flashed back to when he'd stood on another bridge in Paris and tried to get to Hope, but she'd left with Wyatt. Hope noticed Liam on the bridge, and she guessed that he'd been thinking about Paris. They discussed that they would never forget each other, but they had to move on and accept life the way it was. They agreed it was difficult.\n\n\n\"It's really hard,\" Hope said, and she cried. They embraced, but Liam broke away and sighed. Hope walked away, and Liam's eyes filled with tears. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Well aware of Hope\u2019s lingering feelings for Liam, Ivy advises her to get over it because he is moving on with his life. Wanting Liam out of Hope\u2019s life and heart, Wyatt quietly assists his brother in refocusing his attention towards Ivy. Despite her track record with getting assistance in the past, Quinn turns to Bill to help her with a new plan to ensure that Wyatt\u2019s marriage remains intact. Bill finds amusement in Quinn\u2019s news that she and Deacon are now a couple.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy tells Hope that she has to stop looking back. She is married to Wyatt and having his baby so she needs to let Liam go completely. Hope says she is but just on her own timetable, not Ivy's. Wyatt tells Liam the same thing. Ivy is a great gal and she is into him so he needs to focus on that. Bill is agitated that Quinn just walks into his office. He tells her to get a life and find something besides Wyatt to focus on. She tells him their son is in Amsterdam and he needs to do something. She says he needs to give Liam a little push toward Ivy. He ought to be good at something like that. He makes suggestions and then says not a chance. They are not interfering. She may be a pain and a lunatic but Wyatt turned out to be a pretty good kid and she can be proud of that. She says at times she regrets keeping Wyatt from Bill but she made the best decisions she could make at the time. He reminds her that Hope is afraid of her and for good reason so best to leave her alone and not obsess over the upcoming grandchild. Quinn says it is unfair, cruel and unacceptable. Liam asks Wyatt what he means by staking a claim. Maybe he can grab Ivy by the hair and drag her back to his cave. Wyatt says he is not threatened by Liam but he finds it tiresome. He is tired of the lovesick eyes Liam has for Hope for something he will never have. Ivy tells Hope that she is much more like her mother than she realizes. Just let Liam go. She is married to his brother. Hope wants to know if she has ever been in love. She is guessing the answer is no as you can not just turn love off. Liam tells Wyatt that he is shoving him into Ivy. Wyatt says he knows Hope is struggling too. He knows his wife. He knows what she is feeling and when she is hurting. Hope and Liam, all one word is over and the sooner that people can accept that the better they will be. It's annoying but his focus is Hope looking forward to the future. He'd like Liam to respect his marriage and leave his wife alone. If not for Wyatt, then do it for the niece and nephew that is coming. Ivy tells Hope not to think about her, but think about Wyatt. He is a great guy who adores her. Hope says she is not perfect but she is working on this as best as she can. If she is not processing this as fast as Ivy wants, then she is sorry. Just don't be so judgmental. Liam was her first love and has been for a very long time so it's not easy to just let go. Quinn wants to know how she can overlook all of this. Hope wants to push her out of the gene pool although her genes are as strong as Brooke's or Deacon's or even Bill's. Quinn has this flash of Hope giving birth and there is Quinn's big face on the baby. Ivy says she is sorry if Hope feels she is judging her. Hope says she understands. If it is not Ivy it will be someone else. Ivy says then Hope needs to concentrate more on Wyatt and not what she and Liam are doing. Hope says she and Liam are a package always connected and Ivy will just have to accept that. Wyatt tells Liam that it disrespects Ivy every time he can't keep his eyes off his wife. Just let it go. Hope is not a choice anymore. Ivy is ready so go for it right here in Amsterdam. Lars tells Wyatt that the romantic boat is all set with flowers, private quarters, all the lovers will need. Liam thinks back on what Wyatt just said, then the moment that Hope left him alone in Paris. Hope is across the way and sees him on the bridge. She approaches and says hi and she knows what he is thinking. It is hard for her too. They embrace and then she walks away. Quinn calls and asks how things are going. Wyatt says okay but he wishes Liam was not here. She asks if he needs her to come there. He says not at all. He has a plan in motion involving a boat for Liam and Ivy that should do the trick.",
