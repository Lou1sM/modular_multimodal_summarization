Caroline was uncomfortable, and Liam acknowledged that she was offended that he had learned about Ridge's vasectomy. Liam reiterated that it was a small miracle that she was pregnant. \"Am I crossing some kind of line?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"Ridge and I are not hiding anything,\" Caroline said. She added that it was personal. Ridge had gotten a vasectomy, it had been reversed, and they were happy to be having a baby. Liam noted that Ridge had never told her that he'd had the vasectomy. Caroline nodded, but she said it hadn't been an issue. \"Until he realized it was so important for you to have a family,\" Liam added. Caroline agreed.\n\n\nCaroline flashed back to bad memories of Thomas in her bed and Ridge's announcement that he couldn't be a father because he'd had a vasectomy. Caroline admitted it was not something she'd expected to hear. Liam noted that Ridge had gotten it reversed -- a common procedure -- and it had all worked out for the best. \"Sure did,\" Caroline said. Liam told Caroline she would be a great mom. They embraced.\n\n\nThomas worked on a design in the design office, and Ridge entered. \"Dad, good -- glad you're here,\" Thomas said. He asked his father about the bodice on a dress. He couldn't seem to make it work with the skirt he had selected. Ridge suggested it was too much fabric and needed to \"lose the pleats.\"\n\n\nThomas agreed. He promised to revise it. Thomas added that there had been a lot of tension between them. \"You're still really angry with me,\" he said. Thomas apologized for interrupting a private moment during Caroline's sonogram. Ridge dismissed it as a mistake. Thomas had already explained that he had been in the same hallway for another appointment. Thomas realized he had seen what would one day \"be my little brother or sister.\"\n\n\nBrooke entered and interrupted Thomas and Ridge. She was curious that Thomas had seen a sonogram. \"My wife had a sonogram,\" Ridge explained. Thomas added that he had been getting a physical on the same floor, and he had interrupted a private moment. Brooke said something about it being a surprise to everyone that Caroline was pregnant. Ridge was irritated.\n\n\nThomas noted that it wasn't a shock to him because he had known how much Caroline wanted a baby. Ridge asked to see some of Thomas' other designs, and Ridge said that Thomas was on the right track. Ridge left. Thomas told Brooke that he had interrupted a private moment between parents, and he was sorry he had been in the same place.\n\n\nIn the Forrester studio, Zende and Nicole were making out and professing their love for each other. Nicole said they had to stop because they were going to get into trouble. Zende said he wanted a normal relationship like any normal couple. \"Nothing about this is normal, but it will be after I have the baby,\" Nicole said. She said it was worth it.\n\n\nZende acknowledge he wanted more, but he admired Nicole for what she planned to do for her sister. Maya entered and proclaimed she had not been eavesdropping, but she had overheard the sacrifice that Nicole had been willing to make. \"I appreciate every word more than you know,\" she said.\n\n\nNicole smiled, and Maya said that Zende was a good guy. Maya said that she prayed it all happened soon, but she didn't want a baby at the expense of her sister's happiness. \"I love you guys and don't want you to give away your happiness for us,\" Maya said.\n\n\nZende said he would give Maya and Nicole some sister time, and he left. Maya said they were a cute couple, and Nicole asked how much Maya had overheard. Maya said they had no reason to be ashamed because they were clearly very attracted to one another and wanted to take their relationship to the next level.\n\n\nNicole said that Maya would make a great mom because she was behaving like one. They agreed that it would not be the way their mom would behave. Maya laughed and said that Nicole would be off to the convent.\n\n\nLiam entered the office where Thomas had been designing, and Brooke left. Liam wanted to talk to Thomas about his attitude toward Liam and Wyatt because they were Spencers. Thomas basically told him to stop whining about it. Liam reminded Thomas that his sister was dating a Spencer, and his dad was married to one. Thomas defended Caroline as different from Bill Spencer and his sons.\n\n\nThomas warned Liam not to get too comfortable at Forrester because it was clear that he had \"one foot over here and one foot at Spencer.\" Liam wondered if Thomas defended Caroline because he had dated her at one time. He speculated that was why Thomas and Ridge butted heads. Thomas grew quiet.\n\n\nCaroline paced in Ridge's office. Ridge entered. \"There's the beautiful mother of my unborn child,\" Ridge said. He sensed that something was troubling Caroline. \"What's wrong?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\n\"Liam knows,\" Caroline answered. She said that Liam had somehow learned about the vasectomy. Caroline knew Brooke had to have told him. \"Who else would have told him?\" Caroline asked. She worried that there had been too many bad signs. Ridge encouraged her to take a breath. \"Everything's gonna be okay. We've got this. Our secret is safe,\" he claimed. Caroline left, and Ridge summoned Brooke.\n\n\nBrooke entered, and Ridge asked why she would share something so private with Liam. \"You broke my trust,\" Ridge said. Brooke tried to explain it away with the fact that Liam had been fixing her computer and had noted that she had researched vasectomies.\n\n\nRidge wondered why Brooke would do that. Brooke professed that she cared about Ridge. He asked why she would tell Liam because it was something personal. Brooke grew irritated and said that it had all ended well, and she didn't feel she had to lie about it. Ridge maintained it was a private matter. Brooke grew impatient, and Ridge refused to talk to her.\n\n\nLiam entered and interrupted. Ridge asked Brooke to leave and stop sharing his secret. Liam realized he had interrupted something. Ridge told Liam that Brooke should not have shared anything with him.\n\n\nRidge maintained that his life was private and none of Brooke's business -- or anyone's. Ridge added that Steffy and Thomas had not known about the vasectomy, and he would tell them. It was no one's business to tell them. Liam promised to keep the secret. Liam left, and Ridge paced and was irritated.\n\n\nIn the design office, Thomas was at work. Caroline entered and asked about a purple dress he had worked on. \"Send it over when it's done,\" she said. Thomas asked to speak to her. He apologized and said he felt horrible that he had interrupted her sonogram and felt he had ruined a special moment. She told him not to give it another thought. Thomas said he felt there was still great tension between him and his father.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam keeps hammering Caroline that he is not trying to pry but something is up with Ridge. He knows he is right. She is not sure what he wants her to say and thinks it weird that he is even asking. Liam excuses it by saying they are family, they tell each other everything. He knows Ridge had a vasectomy and a condition and now a baby coming so it's like a small miracle. Caroline says she and Ridge are not hiding anything and the vasectomy is personal and nobody else's business. Liam reiterates again that Ridge did not tell Caroline at the time so he knows it must have been a shock to learn that. Ridge drops in on Thomas and Thomas asks for his help with a design. Ridge tells him to just lose the pleat. Thomas says he sees it is pretty obvious that Ridge is still angry with him. He says he is sorry that he might have ruined the moment when he saw them at Caroline's first ultrasound. Curtly, Ridge says he explained himself already the way he always does. Brooke walks in and realizes Thomas saw the ultrasound. She says it is amazing that there is a baby on the way as it took them all by surprise. Ridge quickly changes the subject back to the designs. Liam tells Caroline that he is probably making this out to be more than it is. Everything turned out all right so all is good. He's happy for her and knows she will make a great mom. Nicole and Zende slip off to themselves in the photo shoot room and exchange kisses. Maya spies them and finally comes out of the shadows. She addresses Zende and says what a good guy he is and though Nicole is trying to give them a baby it should not come at the expense of their relationship. She wants everyone to be okay with this. Nicole says Zende knows how special he is to her. Caroline confides in Ridge that Liam knows about his vasectomy so he should be freaking about now. Ridge says unless he knows about that night then he knows nothing so Caroline just needs to calm down. Caroline says Brooke must have told him so Ridge says he will text her. Their secret is safe. Brooke goes to Ridge's office and he tells her to close the door. He thought he made it clear that his procedures were nobody else's business and to be kept private. It wasn't up to her to share it with anybody. Nicole tells Maya that she doesn't have to keep thanking her for this precious gift. They hug and say they love each other. Maya says that will be even if they do not get the answer they want with this.",
