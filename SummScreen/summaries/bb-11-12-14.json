He asked how Ivy had slept, and she answered that she was fine because she had known that he'd been next door all night. Ivy was excited, and she said she couldn't believe she was going to model. She wished that she and Hope could get along.\n\n\nIvy and Liam discussed that her problems with Hope went far beyond modeling. Ivy said that Hope was married to Wyatt and about to have his baby. She had to eventually get over Liam, Ivy insisted.\n\n\nIn another area of Amsterdam, Hope, Wyatt, and the Forrester photography team had been preparing for the photo shoot, and Hope told Wyatt that she was worried because Ivy was not a professional model. \"I can't stand by and coach her through the entire thing,\" Hope complained.\n\n\nWyatt advised her to be focused. \"And you have to let Liam move on with his life,\" Wyatt said. Hope smiled weakly and said she was not interfering in their relationship. She apologized for being preoccupied. Wyatt kissed her.\n\n\nHope assured Wyatt that she loved him, but she needed a little bit of time and understanding. She added that she had almost married Liam. Liam and Ivy entered, and they all greeted one another. Ivy admitted she was nervous. Hope called Ivy over to look at some of the gowns they would be modeling.\n\n\nHope reminded Ivy that the jewelry was important, but they still had to remember Forrester was all about the clothes. Hope suggested that Ivy add a little bit of flair and style to show off the dresses and accessories.\n\n\nHope explained that every first-time model was nervous and usually moved too fast. \"Move slower than you think. Pause and take a breath between shots,\" Hope advised. Hope and Ivy looked over the accessories. Ivy thanked Hope for the tips.\n\n\nWyatt and Liam noted that it appeared Hope and Ivy had been getting along. Wyatt reminded Liam to enjoy the romantic ambience of Amsterdam. Wyatt said they needed to get to Dam Square for the photo shoot. Wyatt asked everyone on the team to listen up, and he announced that they had a tight schedule and a lot to do. Wyatt asked if everyone was psyched. Hope and Ivy agreed they were.\n\n\nAt Dam Square, Liam cuddled with Ivy and asked if she was ready. She smiled but looked nervous. Liam told her that she would be fine, and the camera was going to love her. Ivy worried that she would mess up, but Liam said she should just be herself and act natural. \n\n\n\"You're a Forrester, and you belong here. People want you to be here,\" Liam told Ivy. He added that her jewelry was beautiful. Liam tenderly caressed Ivy's face, and Hope watched as Liam hugged Ivy. Hope couldn't take her eyes off of Liam and Ivy. Wyatt tried to get Hope's attention.\n\n\nThe photographer told them it was time to start, and Hope told Ivy that she didn't have to try modeling if she was nervous. Ivy felt that Hope was trying to squeeze her out of the event. \"Let's see what you've got,\" Hope countered. Wyatt and Liam tried to calm both Hope and Ivy.\n\n\n\"Let's do this,\" Hope said. Hope modeled a stunning red and black dress with a gorgeous statement necklace, but she continued to look at Liam. Wyatt watched Hope look at Liam, but Hope turned and smiled at Wyatt. She modeled another dress, but she carefully watched Liam and Ivy. Ivy smiled but looked nervous.\n\n\nHope's session was done. \"You're on, Forrester,\" Hope said to Ivy. Ivy stood in front of the camera. She took a deep breath and adjusted the dress but looked uncomfortable. Hope looked worried. Ivy relaxed, posed, and looked great. Liam gave her a thumbs-up. Ivy smiled and laughed, and Hope looked hurt. Wyatt was called away.\n\n\nHope looked sad, and Liam walked over to her. \"Hey, so you okay with all of this?\" Liam asked. \"I'm not okay with any of this,\" Hope answered., Hope looked like she wanted to say more.\n\n\nIn Los Angeles at Eric's home, Eric talked to Rick on the phone about Ivy modeling jewelry with Hope. \"Her father would be so proud,\" Eric said. Taylor entered and interrupted. Eric hung up with Rick and called Taylor a beautiful mirage. They embraced, and Eric wondered how long Taylor would stay in Los Angeles. She answered that she hadn't decided. She did have patients, and her kids were old enough that they really didn't need her in Paris.\n\n\nEric asked about Steffy and Thomas, and Taylor shared that Thomas was dating, but Steffy had a hard time and dated very little. Taylor added that she and Thorne had issues but had remained friends. Eric told her that she would always be family.\n\n\nEric wondered if she'd heard that he was no longer CEO. \"Did you choose Rick to take your place?\" she asked. \"Not at first,\" Eric admitted. He said they could discuss it later.\n\n\nEric caught Taylor up on the new campaign and photography shoot in Amsterdam. Taylor had been surprised that Hope had married Wyatt and not Liam. Eric agreed he'd been surprised as well. He said they all had to learn to get along.\n\n\nEric welcomed Taylor home, and he made his traditional martinis -- one for him and one for Stephanie. He filled a martini glass with water for Taylor. They smiled and toasted. Taylor said that she had made a lot of mistakes.\n\n\nEric told Taylor that Stephanie had always loved Taylor. Taylor replied that she had not been loveable at the end of Stephanie's life.\n\n\nTaylor apologized for announcing Brooke and Bill's affair at Katie's party. She admitted that she had been jealous and vengeful. Eric said that it was all in the past. She thanked him for his forgiveness. Eric advised that she had to learn to forgive herself. He reminded her that he had needed a lot of forgiveness in his life.\n\n\n\"I miss times like this,\" Taylor said. She grabbed his hand. Eric hugged her, and Taylor warned that they had to watch out because someone -- meaning Stephanie -- was always watching. Eric laughed and said that he and Stephanie had an agreement. They laughed, and Eric kissed her on the cheek before she left.\n\n\nEric returned to the living room. \"Snuck one over on you, didn't I?\" he asked the portrait of Stephanie. Suddenly, the portrait fell off the wall, and the fireplace grate fell over. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope agrees with Wyatt that she is making this a little personal, but she knows Ivy is not a model, and she can't coach her on everything. He tries to convince her all will be all right. He tells her to stay focused as the International press is everywhere. He also suggests that she let Liam move on with his life. Liam knocks on Ivy's door and presents her a huge yellow tulip. She says they must be in Holland. They mention Hope and Ivy says that Hope is married to Wyatt and expecting his child so she has to let go of Liam eventually. Hope gives Ivy some tips that it is okay to be nervous, but just give the clothes some flair as they are as important as the jewelry too. Meanwhile Wyatt tries to tell Liam how lucky he is ..and if he finds himself in a romantic ambiance then take advantage of it. Eric is on the phone when Taylor slips into his house. He is very glad to see her and she catches him up on Thomas is dating but nothing serious. And Steffy well not so much. She was surprised and disappointed to hear that Hope married Wyatt and not Liam. Eric asks about Thorne and she says they have had some issues but are trying to work it out. He pours them three martinis as he always pours one for Stephanie. He mentioned how much she loved Taylor. She says maybe but not at the very end when she was so ugly to Brooke at her birthday party. Eric says she just had things to say and thought all needed to hear. And the first sign of forgiveness is to forgive yourself. She is family and always welcome here. She can talk to him about anything any time. As Taylor leaves, Eric returns before the portrait and tells Stephanie that he pulled one over on her. Promptly as always, the portrait falls to the floor. Eric is speechless. Before they leave for Dam Square, Hope tells Wyatt that she loves him and glad she is married to him. But it wasn't that long ago that she was going to marry Liam and she thinks she just needs a little more patience. Wyatt gives a little pep talk that they are all a team and they need to be psyched for this shoot. Liam also tells Ivy that she is a Forrester. These people want her here. She deserves to be here so just be herself and act naturally. He gives her a hug and Hope can't help but notice. And Wyatt can't but notice Hope noticing. Hope is first to model two gowns and she keeps glancing at Liam. Then Ivy's turn and she is quite good. Liam buoys her with high signs. But the minute Wyatt is called aside, Liam makes his way to Hope and asks if she is okay with this. She hesitates but says no, she is not okay with any of this.",
