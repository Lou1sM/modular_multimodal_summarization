Ridge assured her that he'd taken care of it, and Liam wouldn't say anything to anyone.\n\n\nLiam arrived and said he'd thought there was a meeting. Ridge said he'd called Liam in early to make sure Liam understood what Ridge had told him the other day about Brooke's revelations. Ridge didn't want people or the press gossiping about it. Liam promised that he got it.\n\n\nIn the meeting later, Thomas was surprised to hear Ridge say that he'd revamped the schedule and was pulling some of Thomas' cocktail dresses. Thomas relayed that Caroline had said the dresses were good to go. \"Well, they're not,\" Ridge responded. Thomas wanted to know if Caroline knew about it, because she and Ridge had both signed off the designs. Ridge said he hadn't signed off anything.\n\n\nSteffy told Thomas to just fix the designs. She moved on to asking Liam about an article. Ridge asked what article, and Thomas and Steffy relayed that Eye on Fashion was running a piece about the Forrester pregnancy and how happy Caroline and Ridge were. Liam said it should post that day. \n\n\nFrom the article, Steffy read a quote from Ridge in which he indicated being thrilled. Ridge stated that he'd said it, but not to a reporter. Liam explained that it was in a press release on the Forrester website, where reporters could quote from it. Ridge asked if Liam knew about it, and Liam asked if it was a problem. Ridge didn't like people talking about him when he was unaware of it.\n\n\nThomas said it wasn't always possible to know about news reporting. He added that the pregnancy had caught a lot of people off guard. Steffy remarked that it mentioned how happy Ridge was to be a father. Ridge said that, at least, was the truth. \"So some of it's a lie?\" Thomas asked. \n\n\nLiam, Caroline, and Ridge glared at Thomas. Thomas asked them all to ease up and said he had to wonder where all the off-the-wall issues with his work emanated from. Ridge said it emanated from experience, and Thomas asked if Ridge was sure about it. Caroline slammed down her pen, saying that Ridge just wanted Thomas to make some changes to the designs. She ordered Thomas to do it, adding that Ridge did it to her all the time.\n\n\nThomas asked Caroline to calm down. He said he'd make the changes. He quipped that they all might not know how to get along, but Ridge sure knew how to crank out babies.\n\n\nAfter the meeting had ended, Thomas remained behind with Caroline and Ridge to apologize for giving Ridge a hard time in the meeting. Ridge replied that he could take a punch, as Thomas already knew. Thomas lingered, and annoyed, Ridge asked if there was anything else. Thomas said there wasn't.\n\n\nTurning on his heel, Thomas decided that there was something else. He wanted to address and resolve the residual anger. He'd disrespected Ridge, and he felt bad about it. Caroline said Ridge didn't want to talk about it anymore. Thomas insisted, and Ridge asked what Thomas had to say.\n\n\nThomas wanted them to be a family, not adversaries. He was happy about what Ridge was able to give Caroline and happy to have a little sibling on the way. Thomas wanted to show the child the ropes, but he felt he couldn't do it if he and Ridge were at odds.  Thomas pledged to do his part. He said the baby and his father's happiness meant a lot to him, and he wanted peace. \"That's all I have to say,\" Thomas concluded, and he left.\n\n\nIn the design office later, Liam and Steffy discussed the meeting and Ridge's reaction to the piece in Eye on Fashion. Liam didn't know why it irked Ridge; it was a good article, and it wasn't like everyone in the world didn't know about the pregnancy. Steffy felt it had to do with having a child with someone young enough to be Ridge's daughter.\n\n\nSteffy claimed to see Liam's wheels turning. Liam remarked upon the tension between Ridge and Thomas. Steffy chalked it up to the pair having issues, as always, and she added that Thomas had also punched Ridge. Liam said he'd heard about it, but he wondered what else was going on.\n\n\nSteffy sat in Liam's lap and kissed him. She said Ridge and Thomas' story was nothing more than a clashing of titans, but she knew newsboys liked intrigue. Liam wouldn't call himself a newsboy -- or a journalist, really. She asked what he wanted to be called. Liam liked her word \"titan,\" and she promptly added that she was his Pandora.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy kissed, and Steffy said that Pandora had a meeting. Steffy left, and Liam flashed back on Caroline's awkwardness about revealing she was pregnant, Brooke relaying news of the vasectomy, and Ridge insisting to Liam that it was private.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Caroline asked if Thomas' words about the baby had gotten to Ridge. Ridge asked what she thought would happen if Thomas found out. Caroline replied that it would be a scandal. Ridge agreed and added that people would be hurt, including Thomas; however, the person to suffer most would be the baby, because the scandal would follow it everywhere.\n\n\nRidge said it was tough for her and for him, too, but they'd do their best to give the baby a normal life. He said to stop worrying about Thomas and to worry about the kid.\n\n\nRidge left for a meeting. Liam arrived. He asked if Caroline was okay. She said she had a lot on her mind from the meeting and asked what he needed. He asked if everything was all right with her.\n\n\nIn a hotel room, Vivienne noted that Julius hadn't slept well the previous night. The pair was worried about the surrogacy. Holding open the Bible he'd been reading, Julius said he had nothing against surrogacy, but it wasn't natural for Nicole, whose life would never be the same. Dealing with Maya's transition had been a lot, in his view, but what Maya was doing to Nicole was just wrong.\n\n\nVivienne remarked that the sisters were adults. Julius said Maya knew that Nicole would do anything for her. Julius had been praying. Vivienne had been, too; she'd prayed for Nicole to find the strength to get through it. Julius said he'd prayed that Nicole wouldn't get pregnant.\n\n\nDisillusioned, Julius said \"father knows best\" didn't work on Maya, but Nicole had listened to him in the past. He believed that he was looking out for both of his daughters, and the older, street-wise Maya ought to know that it wasn't right for Nicole. \"Honey, I don't think she does. Not the way these two feel about each other. They really believe they can conquer the world. I mean, there's nothing they can't do,\" Vivienne said in a sassy tone.\n\n\nVivienne explained that their girls didn't see limitations or boundaries; that was how much the girls loved each other -- as much as their parents loved them. Agreeing, Julius replied that the girls were their flesh and blood, and he and Vivienne had to love them. He vowed to look out for both of them.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Rick and Maya tried to wait on Nicole hand and foot. Maya looked for any signs that Nicole might be pregnant. Nicole joked about having a rocky road ice cream craving. Maya couldn't believe that they'd find out that day if it had worked. Nicole smiled, but her eyes bulged as she looked away.\n\n\nRick said he'd take their one-in-six odds. Nicole admitted to being unsure at first, but she was all in and wanted it for the couple. Maya had confirmed their appointment and said they'd know soon.\n\n\nLater, Nicole remarked upon the kale salad and yogurt Maya had fixed for her to eat. She asked if conception yoga or baby chanting was next. Maya's eyes lit up, and Nicole said she was joking.\n\n\nMaya called her parents to let them know that they were about to find out if Nicole was pregnant. Vivienne, who'd taken the call, wished she could share in the enthusiasm. She wanted the best for Maya but was uncertain of how it would affect Nicole. Maya said it was okay, and she'd let her mother know what happened.\n\n\nAs Vivienne and Julius fretted at the hotel, Maya, Nicole, and Rick arrived at Dr. March's office. Nicole told March that there hadn't been any pain or cramping, and Maya had been checking for symptoms every hour. Maya asked if she'd been that bad. \"Yes,\" Rick replied, chuckling.\n\n\nDr. March left to prepare the blood work. Nicole hoped the test was positive. Rick said that if it wasn't, they'd talk. She asked what there was to talk about. Maya stated that she and Rick knew it had to be emotionally exhausting for Nicole, who'd gone above and beyond to prove her love and loyalty. Maya said there was no pressure to do it again if it hadn't worked.\n\n\nNicole began to speak, but Maya said that no matter the outcome, Maya was grateful for Nicole's sacrifice and generosity. She loved Nicole and had never felt closer to her. Nicole said they should hope and pray that she was pregnant.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Before a meeting, Ridge tells a worried Caroline that he talked to Liam about his vasectomy and had it reversed .now a baby on way so no story. Liam comes in and sees they are alone. Ridge says yes he wanted to be sure that Liam understood what he said the other day. He doesn't want people to gossip or the press to hear about it just yet. Liam looks a bit puzzled but says he gets it, no more from him. Julius tells Vivienne that he tossed and turned all night and got no sleep. This is just not right if Nicole has Rick's baby in her belly. Father Knows Best never worked on Maya but it used to with Nicole. He's been praying that she is not pregnant while Vivienne says she prayed that Nicole will have the strength to get through this. He says she is right, they are their flesh and blood and they have to love them. He's going to look out for both of them. Rick offers Nicole herbal tea to calm her and Maya says the doctor confirmed their appointment. They may know today if she is pregnant or not. Steffy wonders why her dad is changing the subject of the meeting. He says the designs are not quite ready, he did not sign off on them. Liam surprises them by talking about an article on Eye On Fashion about Caroline and Ridge. Steffy says it is about him expecting a family and how he is looking forward to it. Ridge is not a happy camper and says it is a problem with the press since he did not know about it. Thomas speaks up and says it caught a lot off guard but it is news. He just wishes they would all ease up and he'd like to know more about his designs ..why Ridge is not okaying them. Okay he will make some changes but one thing for sure Ridge knows how to crank out babies. He stays behind after the meeting and tells Ridge that he will work on the designs but he'd like to say again that he is not sure where all this anger is coming from. He admits he messed up and disrespected Ridge and he is sorry for that. Caroline speaks up and says Ridge knows that and it does not have to be discussed again. Thomas adds that he wants to be family again and not adversaries. When that little baby comes into the world he wants to be part of that life. He wants peace between all of them. Steffy tells Liam there is nothing wrong between Ridge and Thomas other than a clash of the Titans. Ridge reminds Caroline that everyone wants peace so that is not unusual for Thomas. She wonders what would happen if Thomas knew the truth. Ridge says there would be a scandal. Thomas would suffer and the one the most would be the baby as his friends, family, playground, school would follow him or her everywhere. Nicole is nervous but Dr. March says they will put a rush on the blood work so it won't be long before they know the results. Nicole tells Maya that she hopes and prays that today is the start of making her baby.",
