    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the loft, Quinn was glad Wyatt had figured out that he needed to be proactive. Deacon didn't think Liam was a threat to Wyatt in light of the pregnancy. Quinn responded that Liam was making eyes at Hope and not interested in Ivy on the level that he should be, but Wyatt had organized a boat tour for Liam and Ivy to help the hapless Liam take his relationship to the next level.\n\n\nDeacon stated that Wyatt was just as meddlesome as his mother. Quinn remarked that Wyatt could have been more creative in his plan, but he knew what he was doing. Quinn believed that ensuring Hope and Wyatt's happiness without Liam threatening their marriage might help Quinn's cause with Hope. Quinn muttered that most women respected their mothers-in-law, but Deacon replied that most women didn't have to deal with Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn launched into a sob story about scrimping as a single mother while Brooke had married into the Forrester fortune and raised Hope with a team of nannies. Deacon called his daughter a hard worker. Quinn displayed her calluses from her hard work, but he chuckled. She claimed she adored Hope -- sometimes. \"But sometimes I just want to...\" Quinn said and slipped into a fantasy.\n\n\nIn Quinn's mind, the screen turned gray. Hope was tied to a chair in Quinn's loft. Large pictures of Quinn were in front of Hope, who struggled against her bindings. The leather-clad Quinn said that she loved Hope and the baby. Quinn tickled Hope with a feather wand and commanded her to say that she wanted Quinn to be in their lives.\n\n\nHope twitched and protested. \"I love you, Mama Quinn, and I want you to be a part of my family,'\" Quinn instructed Hope to repeat. Hope agonized beneath the tickling wand until she could take no more, and she said the words Quinn wanted her to say.\n\n\nBack in reality, Deacon asked Quinn why she had zoned out and what she'd been about to say. Quinn replied that she wanted Hope to know that having Quinn in Hope's life wasn't torture.\n\n\nAt the Amsterdam boutique, Ivy and Hope arrived in their gowns after the photo shoot. Wyatt and Liam followed them in. It was time for the indoor closeups of the jewelry, and Wyatt instructed the ladies to put on the sass and personality. \"You ready, Forrester?\" Hope asked, and Ivy quipped, \"All day, Logan.\"\n\n\nUpbeat music played as the photographer took headshots of Hope and Ivy, who wore the earrings, necklaces and bracelets from the outdoor shoot. Hope's experience helped her move effortlessly, and Ivy struggled at first to form natural poses. Hope seemed frustrated by Ivy, and Ivy seemed irritated that Hope was hogging the posing space in front of the camera.\n\n\nAfter a music and dress change, Hope modeled as if she was the only subject in the room. Ivy pushed her way to the forefront, and the women circled each other like waltzing sharks. When the shoot concluded, Liam and Wyatt congratulated the ladies on a real smackdown. Hope said it hadn't been a competition, and Ivy replied that she hadn't been competing.\n\n\nIvy went to help pack up the jewelry, and someone pulled Wyatt away, which left Hope and Liam standing together. Liam awkwardly murmured that he'd enjoyed the shoot. She was glad he'd gotten to see it. He stopped himself from speaking, and she asked what he'd been about to say. He said that they had Mexico, Italy, France, and the Netherlands. Hope joked that they got around.\n\n\nWyatt began listening in from nearby as Hope admitted that Ivy had done well that day. Liam thanked Hope for helping Ivy. \"Is that what I was doing?\" Hope asked. She assumed that they were all in it together, and he said it seemed that way. She stated that everywhere she went, there Liam was.\n\n\nWyatt received a call from Lars. Hope neared Wyatt and overheard him telling Lars to make it the most romantic boat ride ever. Hope smiled as she listened.\n\n\nLater, Hope approached Wyatt. She was glad that work had ended, and she said that, knowing her husband, he probably had something planned for their evening. Wyatt stated that he had something special in mind.\n\n\nAcross the room, Ivy and Liam were discussing what they should do with their evening. Liam received a call from Lars, who invited Liam and Ivy to take him up on a mystery reservation.\n\n\nAt the dock later, Liam and Ivy arrived to meet Lars and noted that they were by the boat they'd seen the other day. Lars stated that it was his boat, and someone had told him that the couple was fond of it. Lars had arranged for a romantic ride and said he'd show them how to operate the boat. He made them promise to make it really romantic, and Ivy and Liam seemed amazed at their fortune.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Hope was ready to relax for the rest of the day. Wyatt said that she'd been an inspiration earlier and had put away the drama as if there had never been any issues. Hope seemed to hear his sarcasm as he added, \"Except for that smackdown diva fest you guys had out there.\" Hope guessed diva action was natural for Forresters.\n\n\nWyatt reminded Hope that it had been the baby's first modeling gig, and the baby had done a good job of remaining hidden from the press. Hope remarked that Liam had had a good time.\n\n\nWyatt tensed, saying that Liam and Ivy were having a good time together. Wyatt wanted to stop focusing on others, and Hope excitedly asked what their plans were for the evening. She asked if she'd need a jacket, if they'd go out, and if they'd eat with Liam and Ivy. Wyatt figured that those two already had plans, and Hope stiffly said she wondered what they were up to.\n\n\nWyatt hoped that Liam and Ivy were moving forward, full steam ahead. Hope decided to retrieve items from the mini bar, and Wyatt opened the windows and used binoculars to stare at the canal. He grinned when saw Ivy and Liam piloting Lars's boat through the water.\n\n\nDutch music played as Liam and Ivy stood closely together at the helm of the boat. Liam steered the vessel, and the pair took in the sights. Ivy gazed lovingly at Liam. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ivy admits for the first shooting she was nervous but the jewelry looked amazing. They are all proud of themselves. Now it's time to bring the sass and personality for their close up jewelry shots inside. They have fun with it. Wyatt points out this is not a competition, they need to work together. They thank Eva for her help and she says she will share the proofs with them later. Liam thanks Hope for helping Ivy and she admits she did okay. Quinn tells Deacon she is sure she has not heard from Wyatt since he is probably putting his plan in action. He needs to be proactive and not just do nothing. Deacon says he does not think Liam is a problem now. She says Wyatt is planning to help Liam by helping him move on from Hope. It will be a boat trip through the city. This could be just what he needs to take his relationship to the next level. Without Liam threatening their marriage, she thinks she has a chance of changing Hope's mind and being a part of the baby's life. She grouses on how hard she had it raising Wyatt while Hope was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She has a flash of Hope tied up and strapped to a chair and her tickling her with feathers and torturing her by demanding that she says she loves Mother Quinn and wants her to be a part of the baby's life. She tells Deacon she hopes Hope knows that having Quinn in her life is not torture. Hope overhears Wyatt on the phone that this has to be the most romantic boat ride of the century. He tells Hope that he is proud of her for helping Ivy. She is so glad it is over. She advises they melt down now so where should they go. Does he have something special planned? They can totally relax now. Liam gets a phone call from Lars and tells Ivy that he has some mystery reservation for him and Ivy, so he says yes. He doesn't know what he is getting himself into. Lars shows them his boat and wants them to make it their home for a few hours and have a very romantic ride. While Hope is grilling Wyatt about what they are going to do tonight, he slips away to look through the binoculars and is pleased to see Liam piloting the boat with Ivy on the Canal.",
