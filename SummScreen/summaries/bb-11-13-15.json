    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the mansion, Rick and Maya's parents gathered with Zende in the living room. Eric said it wouldn't be long before they found out if Rick and Maya were having a baby. \"You mean, Rick and Nicole,\" Julius corrected. Zende stated that the baby wouldn't be Nicole's. Julius figured that they should all pretend, even though they knew the truth.\n\n\nVivienne agreed that it would biologically be Nicole's baby. Brooke added that Nicole would carry it for Maya. Julius reminded them that Nicole would give up her body to, in the end, be forced to give her child up to her brother. Vivienne rendered him a stern look. \"Her sister,\" he corrected.\n\n\nEric said Nicole knew what she'd signed up for, but Julius didn't know how Nicole could know what it was to birth a child only walk away. Julius admitted that he was praying that it failed, but his wife said to pray for understanding no matter how it turned out.\n\n\nEric imagined that the conflicted feelings were difficult for the Avants. Vivienne said they were glad that Maya would get the chance at motherhood and that Maya being transgender didn't prevent it; however, it was confusing, and if Nicole became pregnant, they had to figure out how to deal with it.\n\n\nJulius asked Zende to be honest about how Nicole carrying Rick's would make him feel. Eric didn't think it was fair to ask Zende to feel one certain way. Eric was proud of Zende for giving his full support in an uncertain situation.\n\n\nBrooke hopped to attention when her phone beeped. She told Eric that it wasn't their son, but she was eager. She couldn't wait to be a grandmother again.\n\n\nAside with Zende, Brooke asked him to tell her how he really felt. Zende wanted to believe he'd be excited for Nicole, but part of him wondered how much he was really giving up. He asked how he was supposed to react when Nicole told him that she was pregnant.\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, everyone was nervous about the blood test. Maya was humbled to be Nicole's sister. Dr. March sent Nicole to have her blood drawn. Maya offered to accompany Nicole, but Nicole felt she would be okay. Dr. March told Rick and Maya that it wouldn't be long.\n\n\nLater, Nicole returned, and Rick helped her have a seat. Nicole said all she'd gotten was blood drawn. Rick replied that if she was carrying his baby, he'd be bubble-wrapping her for the next nine months. Nicole wished she had symptoms to make her believe she was pregnant. Maya said Nicole probably wasn't because the chances were low, but Maya chose to think positively.\n\n\nNicole didn't know if it would be harder to tell their parents it had worked or it hadn't worked. The sisters figured the Avants would be disappointed if it did and would express obvious relief if it didn't. Rick said that no matter the reaction, the Avants were concerned parents.\n\n\nMaya didn't know why her parents had to be so concerned and negative, believing the worst. Nicole said they couldn't let it affect them. Maya decided that the Avants could believe that the pregnancy would destroy Nicole, their relationship, and Nicole's shot with Zende, but Maya and Nicole knew better. Maya felt that as tough as it might be at times, it would only strengthen their bond.\n\n\nDr. March returned with the pregnancy test results. She congratulated them and said they were having a baby. Maya was excited, and Nicole was in shock and awe. Nicole had a zillion questions but couldn't think of any. Maya told the doctor that they'd take care of Nicole and not leave her side.\n\n\nDr. March left, and Maya tearfully thanked Nicole, who said she hadn't done much yet. \"My sister is giving me a baby!\" Maya said. She was awed by how far they'd gone. Maya hadn't known if she'd ever see Nicole again, but not only was Nicole back in her life, she was giving Maya a life.\n\n\n\"We're having a baby!\" Maya exclaimed, hugging Rick. Tears streamed down Rick's face. He and Nicole exchanged emotional looks, and Nicole nodded.\n\n\nIn the design office, Steffy wondered if Thomas needed help running revisions by Quinn. Thomas felt he was a big enough boy to handle Quinn, but Steffy said it might be nice to have Ridge for backup against the sometimes intense Quinn. Thomas replied that he was on the design team and didn't need Ridge to run notes by Quinn. Steffy noted that Thomas was more tense than usual when Ridge's name was mentioned, and she asked what was going on.\n\n\nRidge poked his head in the door and asked what he'd missed. Thomas said he'd apologized to Ridge, and he was trying to earn Ridge's respect back. Steffy was sure he would. She said it had been wrong to punch Ridge and wrong to be cavalier about the intern. She assumed those things were what the main issue. Ridge was silent.\n\n\n\"Dad, you will forgive him -- because that's what the company needs. That's what our family needs. Can you do that?\" Steffy asked. Ridge stated that he was working on it. Steffy needed her father to do more than that. She said Thomas had made bad decisions, and he knew it. Thomas added that he'd take them back if he could. Ridge quipped that there were some things one could never take back.\n\n\n\"Even if it's your own child?\" Steffy asked. She asked if Ridge would spend \"all this time\" holding a grudge, and she reminded Ridge that, with a baby on the way, his wife needed him to be happy and stress-free. She asked Ridge to think about his wife and unborn child. She believed that the anger and tension wasn't Ridge or who Ridge wanted to be, so she advised him to forgive and move on.\n\n\nRidge agreed that his priorities had to be his wife and unborn kid, and anger didn't help anyone. He asked if Thomas thought he liked being at odds with Thomas. Thomas tried to address Ridge being worried that Thomas would make the same mistakes -- but Ridge cut him off, saying Ridge wouldn't give Thomas the opportunity to make them again.\n\n\nSteffy understood that bad feelings didn't go away overnight, but family was too important to let bad feelings get in the way. \"Yeah,\" Ridge murmured and left. Steffy told Thomas that it was all because of a stupid punch. \"I bet you wish you could take that back,\" she concluded.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Liam pressed Caroline about whether she was all right. Caroline didn't even know why he kept asking her. He claimed to know her and to see with his own eyes that something was wrong. She felt that the millions of cells multiplying in her body allowed for her to be a bit off. \"So that's what this is? You're just pregnant?\" he asked.\n\n\nCaroline asked if Liam had any idea about the emotional roller coaster pregnancy was. Liam claimed that he did, and he'd been watching her, how she was with Ridge and Thomas, and the tension between the men. Liam noted that Ridge didn't want the press involved, and there was secrecy around the pregnancy. Liam wanted to know why, but Caroline just fidgeted.\n\n\nLiam stated that he was Caroline's family, and she could talk to him. Caroline revealed that Ridge and Thomas were going through a difficult time after some things had happened that shouldn't have happened, and it didn't matter because they were trying to put it all behind them.\n\n\nLiam felt it did matter because Caroline had to take it easy. He asked if Ridge was stressing her out. Caroline abruptly dismissed the idea, saying that Ridge was her rock. Liam decided that if it wasn't Ridge, it was Thomas. She claimed not to know what he was talking about. Liam said the more she tried to convince him she was okay, the less he believed her. She didn't know why Liam was so insistent.\n\n\nLiam said he didn't mean to pressure Caroline. He wanted to believe that she was fine, but he questioned the way she and Ridge had behaved from the beginning. Caroline asked if the beginning was when Pam and Charlie had ambushed her into revealing her pregnancy.\n\n\nLiam mentioned the vasectomy, but Caroline didn't know why it mattered when Ridge had reversed it. Gesturing to her belly, she said it obviously wasn't an issue. Liam asked Caroline to see his view of how strange it was, and he added the weird tension between Ridge and Thomas to it.\n\n\nCaroline asked Liam to excuse her lack of enthusiasm after being forced to reveal her pregnancy before she'd wanted to. She asserted that the vasectomy thing was personal and no one else's business. She appreciated the concern, but with a \"back off\" hand gesture, she insisted that she was fine.\n\n\nLater, Liam entered the design office, and Steffy plied him with kisses. He barely responded, and she asked what was wrong. Liam relayed his concern for Caroline. Steffy said that Caroline was in a minefield of pregnancy hormones. Steffy was sure Caroline was fine, and Liam had nothing to worry about. He said Steffy was probably right, but she corrected that she always was.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Ridge noted that Caroline was tense. Caroline relayed that Liam was picking up on things, and she could see his wheels turning. She thought she could convince Liam not to worry, but she needed Ridge to help by relaxing around Thomas. Ridge stiffly said he was trying, but all he could see was Thomas' hands on her.\n\n\nKeeping secrets was stressful for Caroline. Ridge said that maybe it wasn't a secret; it was the truth that they were having a baby. Caroline asked if they could really just not tell anyone. Ridge said that they could. \"We're starting a family. Thomas will never know,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nIn the cracked doorway, Thomas listened and frowned. \n\n\n",

Why all the tension between Thomas and Ridge .and why Ridge wants no one in the press to know any details of the pregnancy. All await the blood test for Nicole to see if she is pregnant. Julius and Vivienne go to the Forresters and hope they are not butting in, but they could not stay in the empty hotel room any longer. Julius has a few more crude remarks to make about Rick and Nicole's baby but then hand it over to Maya. Steffy asks her dad to do more than think about it. Thomas made some mistakes and he has apologized for it so she and the company need Ridge to ease the anger and tension. That is not who he is. He needs to move on and forgive. Caroline tells Liam that it does not matter. Ridge is her rock and Liam does not need to worry about him causing her stress. Yes he and Thomas have issues but they will work it out. Liam still persists that something is wrong and she needs to come clean and tell him. Ridge says he is not worried about Thomas making the same mistake. He will not give him that opportunity. Steffy tells Thomas all this over a stupid punch doesn't seem right, she bets he would like to take that back. Caroline tells Liam all of this does not matter but he keeps saying it all seems a little strange. She says only because she got forced to tell all she was pregnant way before she wanted to. She loves him and she is fine, so let it drop. The vasectomy is nobody's concern. Eric tells Zende with Julius there that he is proud of Zende and he owes no one an answer how he will feel if and when Nicole becomes pregnant. He has always been behind her 100%.
