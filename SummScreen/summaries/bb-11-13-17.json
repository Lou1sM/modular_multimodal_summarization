    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Sally's house, Coco was amazed that Sally had professed love to Liam when the two had been trapped in the rubble. Sally knew it had been a crazy thing to do, and she said that if Liam was anything other than loyal, they could just forget about it. However, Liam had to be honest with his wife, and Sally feared it would end badly for Liam and Steffy.\n\n\nCoco assumed that Sally's feelings hadn't happened overnight. Agreeing, Sally said Coco had no idea of how supportive Liam had been, and it had started when Liam had gifted the building to Sally. Sally had been attracted by his goodness and said she'd never met a man like Liam.\n\n\nCoco was shocked by Liam's generosity. She said Liam cared about people, unlike his father. Sally added that he cared about animals and the universe. \"And you,\" Coco stated. Sally replied that Liam was an amazing friend. Coco said Sally didn't have to pretend. Coco could hear in Sally's voice and see in her face when she talked about Liam that Sally was in love with him.\n\n\nCoco figured that being trapped had been a horrific experience and asked if Sally wanted to talk about it. Sally remembered that the explosion had knocked her out, and she'd awakened when Liam had called to her. It had been dark. She could still hear the water dripping and taste the dust and smoke. Sally said she'd died and gone \"to hell,\" but looking over at Liam had made her realize that she'd been alive.\n\n\nLiam had talked Sally down from her fears, despite her physical pain. He'd told her wonderful things about her talent and fighting spirit. That had been when Sally had told him that she loved him. Coco asked what he'd said. Sally replied that Liam hadn't responded with words, and that had been when she'd kissed him. Liam had kissed her back, and she'd forgotten about dying.\n\n\nSally said that she and Liam had been in a moment, but they'd returned to reality. She just wanted Liam and Steffy to get beyond it. Coco asked if Sally really wanted things to work out with the marriage. Coco was sure Steffy wouldn't let Sally near Liam, and Sally might never see him again.\n\n\nSally said that Coco was probably right about it, and if it happened, Sally would miss him and long for another moment between them. Sally knew it would never happen because Liam wanted Steffy. It didn't seem right to Coco that Sally took the blame for it all. Sally said it was the price she was willing to pay for Liam's happiness.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Wyatt and Liam had coffee and discussed Steffy's resolve and belief in healing the family. When Bill had seen the conviction in Steffy's eyes, it had made him a believer, too. Wyatt remarked that the two had settled their differences for a moment the last time, but Wyatt couldn't see Liam and Bill hugging it out anytime soon. Bill replied that they wouldn't have had that prior moment without Steffy.\n\n\nWyatt countered that it had been okay, but Bill had then blown up the Spectra building with Liam in it. Bill complained that Wyatt was super negative. Bill shifted the blame to Liam, who'd staged the sit-in. \"Who does that? Your neo-hippy brother, that's who!\" Bill rasped. Bill said Liam should have stayed out of it instead of getting caught up with Sally Spectra.\n\n\nBill believed that the best shot Liam had at getting his marriage on track would be if Sally left town. Wyatt asked about Bill and Liam. Bill replied that Steffy believed she could salvage the relationship between the men again, and he recalled how he and Liam had hugged it out right there in that office. Wyatt was glad he'd been there to witness it. Bill grumbled that Liam had thrown it all away on Sally Spectra.\n\n\nBill was still shaken by what he referred to as the worst moment of his life. He hadn't known what he would have done if Liam had died in the demolition. Wyatt said not to go there because Liam was fine. Bill had thought the incident would make him and Liam closer, but Liam was angrier than ever. Wyatt considered that Bill might want too much too soon.\n\n\nRecalling that Steffy had said the same thing, Bill said Steffy had advised him to be patient and kind, and she hadn't been wrong yet. Bill was amazed by the lengths Steffy would go to save the father and son relationship. He thought she was incredible.\n\n\nWyatt replied that Bill didn't have to tell Wyatt how amazing Steffy was. Wyatt already knew. Bill didn't understand why Liam wasn't being more considerate of his wife and why Liam was giving his attention to Sally Spectra instead of his wife.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Steffy didn't understand why Liam and Sally had been in a life-threatening situation, and instead of screaming out for help, they'd started making out. Liam said he deserved for Steffy to be upset with him, but the act had had nothing to do with his feelings for her. He begged her to forgive him.\n\n\nRecalling that Liam had said that Sally loved him, Steffy asked if he loved Sally, too. Liam claimed to love only Steffy. \"But you didn't tell her that. You didn't even mention my name because, if I've got the timing right, that's when you started kissing her,\" Steffy replied.\n\n\nLiam responded that Sally had kissed him, but it was true that he'd kissed her back. Steffy asked how he could do it. He stated that it had only been a moment, but Steffy had to believe that he'd never stopped loving Steffy. Steffy didn't know what to believe. She was sure he loved her, but he apparently had feelings for Sally, too.\n\n\nLiam asserted that he'd made a mistake, but he only had feeling for Steffy. Steffy roared that he'd kissed Sally. Liam admitted to letting Steffy and himself down. Steffy murmured that she couldn't get the image out of her mind, and he claimed it had been a life-or-death moment. Steffy asked if that was supposed to be make it okay, because it didn't.\n\n\nLiam said that it wasn't an excuse; it was what had happened. Liam claimed that Bill was the reason that he and Sally had been under the rubble, and he'd seen it as a way to comfort Sally before they'd died. \"Unbelievable!\" Steffy exclaimed. \"In your last moments on earth, all you cared about was comforting Sally? Well, what about me? What about your wife? Did you even spare a thought for me?\"\n\n\nThough he figured he wasn't explaining it right, Liam wasn't sure he could even give a logical explanation. He only knew that he loved Steffy, and he only wanted a future and family with Steffy, if it were even possible. If it wasn't, he'd be happy to just be with her. Steffy said she'd always counted on him to be loyal and never betray her.\n\n\nLiam claimed that Steffy had his loyalty. Disagreeing, Steffy cited that he'd put the family, his father, the company, and even his wife second. \"To her! Sally Spectra, my worst enemy!\" Steffy screamed.\n\n\nLiam told Steffy that she was second to none. \"Oh, my God, where have I heard that before?\" Steffy quipped. Steffy remembered competing with Hope and said that nothing Steffy had ever done had been good enough. He replied that it wasn't true, but Steffy believed that it was and said Hope had won every time. \"Up until she left for Paris,\" Steffy said.\n\n\nSteffy claimed she'd been able to deal with it because Hope had at least been a decent human being, unlike Sally. Steffy claimed that Sally was a liar, a user, and a thief who'd used Steffy. Steffy asked if it had occurred to him that fighting Sally's battles would upset Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy remembered telling him that again and again, but she concluded that her feelings didn't compare to Sally's pain and constant victimization. \"But, Steffy, she was victimized,\" Liam replied. \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Even now, you can't stop yourself from defending her!\" Steffy complained.\n\n\nSteffy guessed that the entire time that she'd been trying to heal the damage Liam had caused in Sally's name, he and Sally had been flirting with each other. He claimed it wasn't so. Steffy assumed that losing all the power Liam had accumulated had something to do with his actions. She was sure it had been a big letdown, but at least he'd had Sally.\n\n\nLiam said Steffy was making it sound as if he'd had an affair. Steffy quipped that he'd used the first excuse he'd gotten to kiss Sally. He yelled that he and Sally had thought they'd been about to die. Steffy asked if that made it okay to be unfaithful.\n\n\nSteffy asked how long Liam had been unhappy with her. Liam said he wasn't, but she figured that he had to be to make out with Sally. Liam claimed he'd let one moment get away from him, but she said he was in denial and wouldn't have gotten so involved with Sally unless he'd had feelings for her. Steffy wanted to know if he'd buy Sally another building and help her recreate Spectra yet again.\n\n\nLiam pledged to put an end to it. Steffy advised him to think long and hard about it because Sally had been his passion and cause. Steffy said he might realize he wanted to be with Sally. Liam called it ridiculous, and he wanted his life to be there with Steffy. Steffy asked why. She stated that she wasn't an underdog, and she didn't need rescuing like the dazed, confused Sally.\n\n\nLiam uttered that he'd gone too far and had gotten too involved. Steffy said the man she'd married would be screaming her name, not kissing another woman, if he'd thought he was dying. Steffy was disgusted that he'd touched another woman and had been tender with her. \"That should be me, your wife!\" Steffy said, sobbing. \"How dare you cheapen what we have?\"\n\n\nLiam reached for Steffy, but she flinched and told him not to. Liam understood that he'd screwed up, and he wanted to fix it. He felt that he could change. She replied that there would be many changes. Liam would have to put his father first -- his brother and his wife, too. \"And until I believe you're ready to do that, I need time,\" Steffy decided.\n\n\nLiam asked what Steffy meant. Steffy said she loved him, but she didn't deserve what he'd done. She'd been loyal and supportive, even when she'd believed he'd been dead wrong, but he'd gone and done something like what he'd done. Steffy needed time to think about whether he was the man she wanted to be with, and she figured that he needed time, too.\n\n\nShocked, Liam replied that he didn't need time or to think. He wanted to work through it. Steffy had never thought she'd say it, but he disgusted her. He called her name, but Steffy grabbed her purse and charged out the front door.\n\n\n",

But this has nothing to do with his feelings for Steffy and he is asking her to please forgive him. He never stopped loving her and he wants her to believe that. Wyatt tells Bill that he doesn't want to be negative but he doesn't see him and Liam singing Kumbaya. They have been at odds for months and only back together like one second. Bill says Liam should have just stayed focused on his marriage and not hook up with Sally. Coco listens as Sally explains how she came to own the Spectra building and then found out later Bill still owned it. She has never known a man like Liam. Bill tells Wyatt they did go from all out war to hugging right here in the office but Liam threw that all away because of Sally Spectra. Coco tells Sally that Liam is nothing like his father as he does care about people, animals, just about everything. She does not have to pretend with her; she sees Sally is in love with Liam. Liam says he only loves Steffy and he made a mistake. It was a life or death moment. She says that does not make it okay. He knows it is no excuse but it is what happened. He saw it as a way they could cope before they died. She cries that he could not even spare a thought for her in that moment. He keeps repeating that he loves only her and wants a future with only her. Wyatt tells Bill that he is expecting too much too soon with Liam. Nothing happened so do not keep going back there. Sally tells Coco that Liam was so strong even under the fear of death, telling her things she wanted to hear and she found herself telling him that she loved him and kissed him. He kissed her back and they both forgot Steffy in that moment. She hopes he can get past that now. Coco says if that happens she probably will never see Liam again. Sally says she knows that is right although that kiss will never happen again. If she is the cause of his unhappiness now then she is willing to pay. Steffy starts in on Sally. Things have never been the same since Hope left for Paris, but at least she was decent. Sally is not so all of Steffy's peacemaking has been for naught. He gave up the CEO of Spencer all for his caring more for Sally. He says it sounds like she is saying he had an affair and that is not what happened. She says maybe he should just go and be with her; they think alike and have the same causes. Steffy tells Liam that Sally is the one who needs his help. Steffy is not the underdog and she does not need his help and what he did disgusts her. That should have been her that he thought about. She starts to leave and he comes nearer and she says no. He says he can change if she will let him. She says she does not deserve this and until he puts his father, his brother and her first then he needs more time. He says he needs no more time. He wants to work through this. She says again that he disgusts her and walks out.",
