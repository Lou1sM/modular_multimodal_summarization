She informed him that she had promised Shane that she would celebrate with him after the trial was over.\n\n\nBridget went to see Dante with some bad news about their baby. She told Dante that she had been bleeding earlier and had lost the baby she was carrying. Bridget thought perhaps the miscarriage happened for the best since Dante is married to Felicia. Dante pointed out that Bridget was wrong; he told Bridget that he really wanted their baby. Dante explained that he and Felicia both wanted Bridget's baby. Bridget questioned whether she was meant to be a mother after having lost two babies now. Dante tried to encourage Bridget explaining that many women have multiple miscarriages before they give birth.\n\n\nAt court, Storm made a great opening argument to the jury.

    "tvdb": "Bridget stops Dante on his way out to Taylor's trial. Bridget informs him that she found some bleeding and that after a visit with the doctor she has learnt that she has had a miscarriage. Dante comforts her when she sobs that she may never have a baby. Eric and Stephanie arrive at the courthouse, hoping that Shane will come through for Taylor. Hector and Harry are concerned that Shane still hasn't arrived. Phoebe finds Shane and promises him a celebration between them that evening after he testifies, hoping that she will no longer have to keep him around to stick to it. The court begins and things go badly when Jennifer Tartaro paints a bad picture of Taylor to the jury, although Storm manages to improve things by throwing out Lieutenant Baker's case that Taylor was over the alcohol limit. Shane begins to testify but the court is called to recess until the following day when Judge Owens has to be called away. Phoebe worries that she will have to stick to her plans with Shane.\r\n",
    "yt": "\n\nShane shows up late to the courtroom to testify.  He tells Phoebe all he can think about is them celebrating after the trial and he goes in to kiss her.  She pulls away saying that if someone sees it will make his testimony look like a lie.  Shane\u2019s testimony is cut short by the Judge, leaving Phoebe nervous about celebrating with him tonight.  Lt. Baker states that though he smelled alcohol on Taylor\u2019s breath the night of the accident, there was no breathalyzer test to prove her blood alcohol level was over the legal limit.  Dante tells Bridget that they can find a way for Felicia, Bridget and him to raise the baby together, but Bridget reveals that she lost the baby. Dante comforts Bridget as she tells him that she feels like a failure for losing two babies.",
    "imdb": "\nThe family worries why Shane is late, but he's just enjoying Phoebe's company innocently and arrives just in time. Bridget tells Dante their embryo just died. He comforts her, assuring she'll probably still have a child later. The prosecutor tries to discredit Shane, but a mysterious urgent note make the judge suspend the court session.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Storm, Phoebe and the others are worried about Shane not showing up for court. But, he finally does and she lets him know she'll feel better after he testifies. Court is in session and the jury is brought in. The prosecutor paints it pretty black. Taylor Hayes lied to everyone including her family and the police. Is this the actions of an innocent person? Assistant D.A. Tartaro presents Taylor's signed confession admitting drinking, driving and killing her sister-in-law. Storm delivers his defense and his star witness \u0096 Shane. A dejected Bridget catches Dante at home and tells him she has some news for him. She cries that she lost their baby. She feels like a failure, and although he is awfully disappointed, he tells her it's not her fault. She will have other children. Tartaro pokes huge holes in all of Shane's testimony of what he saw on that dark, foggy, unlighted night while hidden in the bushes, perhaps too far away to see really good. And she crucifies him when it's established that he has been living with Taylor and her family the last few months and would probably say anything in her favor as a loyal employee. Storm starts to make some good inroads in his defense, but the Judge calls time out as he has an emergency so court will resume tomorrow morning. The family rallies around an angry Taylor. She wanted this over with today. Shane pressures Phoebe to not let this deter her. He will get her mom off tomorrow; tonight is their night.",
