    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Amsterdam, Ivy and Liam had a romantic time, drinking champagne and cruising down the canals in Lars's boat. Ivy suspected that Liam had arranged the boat ride, but he insisted that he hadn't. She wondered how he just happened to know how and where to steer them. He attributed the boating skill to his Spencer genes but was surprised she hadn't noticed that he'd been driving in circles.\n\n\nIvy decided that whoever had set it up for them had known exactly what to do. Gazing at Liam, she remarked that she'd never been happier. Liam told her that she deserved it. Ivy couldn't believe they were there or that she had a job at Forrester with her own jewelry line. She decided that she was living the American dream. \"We're living the Dutch dream,\" Liam corrected.\n\n\nThe song \"Follow Me Home\" played over scenes of Ivy and Liam taking in the sights. They sneaked gazes at each other as they stood with their arms linked, and Liam kissed her cheek. While steering, he slowly leaned into her and nuzzled his nose against her cheek before kissing it again. She sneaked a look at him, and when he looked back, she glanced off. Liam gazed at Ivy with admiration, and the gravity of a familiar emotion hit him. He grinned, savoring the moment.\n\n\nIn the hotel, Hope was anxious to get to the special event Wyatt had planned for them. Wyatt said he'd rather take advantage of the alone time he had with his wife in the hotel. She liked the sound of it but wondered if it was too late to cancel the boat.\n\n\nWyatt looked surprised, and Hope said she'd heard him booking a boat with Lars. Wyatt offered to do the ride the next day, but she said the reservation was for that day. Clearing his throat, Wyatt admitted that the reservation hadn't been for them; it had been a surprise for Ivy and Liam.\n\n\nHope asked why Wyatt would make such a gesture. Wyatt replied that it was a great way to see the city. She wondered if Liam and Ivy had thought that his gesture was strange. Wyatt admitted that they didn't know he'd done it. He said Liam probably wouldn't have accepted if he had known. \"Exactly, because it's weird,\" Hope replied.\n\n\nHope asserted that Liam and Ivy could have set up their own ride if they'd wanted one. Wyatt stated that he'd seen an opportunity, and Hope responded that he'd just had to take advantage. She declared that he was \"so [his] mother right now.\" Frustrated, he asked what she was talking about. Hope accused Wyatt of manipulating the pair, but he exclaimed that it had been a simple boat ride.\n\n\nWyatt guessed that he should have told Hope about it, but he'd been trying to help Liam. \"When have you ever done anything to help Liam?\" Hope asked. She accused Wyatt of trying to force the relationship. Wyatt admitted that he might be doing that. He said that he might want his brother to be happy and asked what was wrong with it.\n\n\nHope replied that Wyatt knew how she felt about lies and manipulation. \"More importantly, how you feel about Liam,\" Wyatt added. He said Hope had to let Liam go and move on with Ivy if he wanted to. Hope replied that it was Liam's decision, not Wyatt's. Wyatt told her to let Liam go, and she replied that she had. \"And yet the idea of him with Ivy upsets you,\" Wyatt stated.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that his actions hadn't hurt anyone, but Hope exclaimed that she'd been hurt by it. She claimed that Wyatt was spending too much time focusing on Liam, which put Wyatt and Hope on the backburner. Wyatt asked if Hope wanted Liam to pine away for her all of his life. She claimed she didn't. Wyatt didn't want it, either. He said that Liam being with Ivy shouldn't affect Wyatt and Hope.\n\n\nAgain, Wyatt claimed that he'd wanted to do something special for his brother. Hope said she might feel differently if he'd been upfront and asked Liam before acting. To her, Wyatt's methods were underhanded. Wyatt replied that he could see her view. She said she felt like she couldn't trust him.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Hope might be overreacting. \"No. You know what? You can't have us both. You married me. You chose me. Liam has to move on with his life, and you have to let him. \" Wyatt decided.\n\n\nHope contended that Wyatt didn't even know if Liam wanted to be with Ivy. Wyatt said he'd observed how they were together, and Ivy made his brother smile. \"Not if you are the one orchestrating things. Not if you're the one forcing the relationship!\" Hope exclaimed. He contended that all he'd done was set up a fun boat ride, and it wouldn't make or break a relationship. He didn't know why Hope was emotionally invested or why she couldn't be happy for Liam, who had a nice girl.\n\n\nHope yelled that Wyatt should have been upfront about it. Wyatt agreed, but he said it had to stop. All the looks back and forth had to stop; they were annoying. He stated that the sooner she saw Liam move on, the sooner it would stop. \"It needs to stop. It's wrong. We are married, and we are expecting a child. That is what we need to be focused on right now, not Ivy and Liam,\" Wyatt argued.\n\n\nHope frowned and decided that she needed some air. She grabbed a jacket and walked onto their balcony. On the canal, Ivy and Liam's boat floated into Hope's view, and Hope watched them.\n\n\nOn the antique boat, Ivy guessed that her and Liam's ride was over, but he said it wasn't if they didn't want it to be. \"I love you,\" Ivy blurted out. Liam was surprised, and his gaze shied away from her. She apologized, but he cut her off, saying, \"I love you, too.\"\n\n\nLiam swept Ivy into a kiss, and on Hope's balcony, Hope gasped, and tears welled in her eyes.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Rick gave Maya a bangle bracelet. Maya loved it and said he had great instincts. He replied that it was in jewelry, not women. She decided not to be insulted. \"Until now, of course,\" he added. Slipping her arms around him, she relayed that he had a woman who appreciated him, and they'd accomplish much as the CEO and the model by his side.\n\n\nFrom the doorway, Caroline quipped that Maya had a great career as Rick's arm candy, but if she ever wanted to act again, she'd make a great Lady Macbeth. \"Out, damn Caroline. Out, I say,\" Maya retorted. Caroline refused to leave, but Rick said she could make an appointment. Caroline called it ridiculous to make an appointment with her husband, whom she wanted back.\n\n\nRick claimed not to have time for it, and as he answered a call, Maya told Caroline to get a clue. Flashing her bracelet, Maya asked if Rick would be lavishing her with gifts if he wanted to be in his marriage. Caroline believed it would happen if he was confused and taken advantage of. Maya said that Rick had someone new, and Caroline needed to take her alimony and move on.\n\n\nIn the Forrester corridor, Ridge asked Pam for his messages. Pam replied that Katie hadn't called -- if that was what he'd been asking her. Ridge replied that Pam seemed to be the one asking something. Pam wanted to know if Ridge and Katie were together. He said he was working on it, and Pam said that if Katie decided to take him back, he needed to ditch the ribbon and buy Katie an actual ring.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Caroline tried to convince Rick that taking up with Maya wasn't in his best interest. Caroline said that he was lashing out, and he wasn't himself; however, they were still married and could work it out. Rick was still bitter that she'd turned to Ridge, whom he'd watched hurt his mother over and over again. \"You turn to him? You kiss him?\" Rick raged.\n\n\nAs he entered the room, Ridge told Rick that it was enough, and if Rick wanted to go after someone, Rick could go after him. Ridge wouldn't stand for Rick attacking Caroline. Ridge called Rick an idiot for sleeping with the first woman who'd walked through his door. Rick told Ridge to give Rick a reason to fire him and stated that he'd already warned them about attacking Maya.\n\n\nRick recalled that he'd consoled his mother after she'd picked up the pieces from Ridge. Rick asserted that he didn't have to do it any longer, not for his mother or for Caroline. Rick didn't \"give a damn anymore\" and ordered Ridge and Caroline out of the office.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline retreated to Rick's old office. Caroline didn't believe that Rick was himself and said she'd never seen him that way before. Ridge figured that she'd just never seen that side of Rick. Ridge had known Rick longer and had observed Rick lash out and retaliate when he felt he'd been wronged. Ridge didn't want that treatment for Caroline.\n\n\nCaroline said Rick might have accepted the kiss being anyone but Ridge. Ridge stated that there were two sides to every story, and while Rick wanted Ridge to be the bad guy, it wasn't so clear-cut. Caroline uttered that nothing ever was. Ridge hugged her and said she didn't deserve Rick's treatment. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam pilots the boat carrying him and Ivy down the Amstel flowing through the center of Amsterdam. He pours some champagne and their faces glow as they celebrate. He admits he did not set this up. She says somebody sure did with all the champagne, hors d'oeuvres and special food. She has never been happier. He says she deserves it. Hope hugs Wyatt and says she overheard him talking to Lars on the phone and it sounded like he was planning something really romantic. He stammers a bit and says they can do it tomorrow but this was a surprise for Ivy and Liam. She thinks that is a little strange for him to do that. He says he did it as a surprise because Liam would not have gotten on the boat if he knew it was him that set it up. Hope counters that if Ivy and Liam wanted a romantic boat ride they would have set it up themselves, so Wyatt seemed to take the opportunity and advantage. He is so like his mother in manipulating. He doesn't understand her over-reacting to this. It's a simple boat ride and he just wanted to help Liam. They go back and forth. She says this is so self serving. He is trying to force their relationship. He says he wants his brother to be happy and doesn't know why that is a problem. Ridge checks with Pam to see if he has any messages. She says no, and especially not from Katie if he is asking. And if they are still together after this whole Caroline thing, do her a favor and have her take off that stupid red ribbon and buy her a real ring. Rick presents Maya with a gorgeous bracelet that she slips on. She tells him he has great taste. He says in jewelry only. She says she will not let that remark get to her. She mentions the CEO and his model just as Caroline walks in. She mocks that Maya has a great future being Rick's arm candy. Maya puts on her best Lady MacBeth act and says out damn Caroline. Caroline announces that she is not leaving. Rick says if it is about design she can make an appointment. Caroline pushes past Maya and says this is ridiculous. This is about them and she is not going to make an appointment to speak with her husband. She says she cares about him and wants him back, but he doesn't want to get into this now. While Rick takes a phone call, Maya tells Caroline to get a clue. It is over. She shows Caroline the bracelet. She says Rick has someone now who supports him and won't betray him. So Caroline can take all the alimony she can get and just move on. Caroline tells Rick that he is hurting but turning to Maya is not going to help. He can come home to her and they can still work this out. Rick says she turned to Ridge of all people. He has seen his own mother hurt by this man and never in a million years did he think it would affect his own wife. Ridge walks in and says that is enough. He goes right to Caroline and puts his arm around her slightly. He tells Rick that he can go after him but leave Caroline alone. Rick wants both of them out of the office and since he is CEO he can throw them out. Ridge tells him that he is being an idiot. He slept with the first woman that walked through his door. Rick says as far as he is concerned, Caroline no longer matters to him so get out. Hope says she doesn't see how Wyatt can say that when she knows how she feels about lies and manipulations. He counters with it is also how she feels about Liam. She needs to let him go. If he wants to move on with Ivy, then let him. She says that is the whole point ..IF it is Liam's decision but not Wyatt's. He says he rented a boat, got some champagne and flowers, no one is being hurt here. Hope says she is. He is spending so much time focusing on them and it's like Wyatt has put them on the backburner. He reminds her she is expecting his baby so what Liam does with Ivy or whomever does not affect them. She claims that he is being sneaky and did this behind her back and she can not trust him now. He says she can't have both. She chose him and Liam is moving on with his life. And she needs to let him. She says he can't if Wyatt is orchestrating everything. He should have been upfront about this. He says actually this has to stop ..the longing looks at each other. It's wrong and the sooner that Liam moves on with Ivy then it will stop. They need to be focusing on themselves not Ivy and Liam. Hope says she needs air and walks out on the balcony. Liam's boat approaches. Ivy suddenly blurts out to Liam that she loves him. He hesitates one second and says he loves her too and gives her a big kiss that Hope sees. She has tears in her eyes, inhales a big breath and can hardly breathe.",
