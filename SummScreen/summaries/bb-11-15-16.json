Rick assists Katie in creating a life for herself and Will following her divorce as they jointly go house-hunting on the internet. Quinn gives Katie a call.

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke looks up and there stands Ridge in her kitchen. He wants to tempt her. Turns out he has a pint of ice creme in his hand and they sit and share it. He can't help but say this is the worst most successful showing they have ever had. And Quinn will get all the credit. She tries to assure him all will work out okay. He stares at her and says yes he knows he has more important things to think about. Quinn holds the champagne glass where she notices a big red lipstick print. She questions Eric later about it. He tells her Katie dropped by and watched the fashion show with him. She digs it out of him that she has stopped in several times lately. He was so excited about the show that he forgot to mention it. She mentions that she saw the glasses downstairs so that explains it. Eric says he worked too hard on his recovery so he did not drink any but they opened the bottle and Katie had a small sip. He hopes that Quinn does not mind. He should have cleaned it up. She says she trusts him completely so she is only disappointed in that Eric could not be with her at the showing but he was sharing it with another woman. Eric apologizes and says Katie is an old friend and she did not come over here to criticize Quinn. She has a Logan on her side. Katie drops in on Rick and tells him she was impressed by the show and thought it was a big success. Rick knows his dad will give Quinn credit and he just cannot stand that. She tells him that Eric helped her with Will so that is one other thing that she now has off her plate. Now she needs to find an agent and get another house. He says he can help her. They look online and he finds one right next door to Eric's and says he knows the place well and it is ideal and she will love it. They make plans to see it tomorrow. Ridge asks Brooke about Bill and she shows him that she still has his ring, but says he is still upset with her. Ridge says they can take care of that ring situation very quickly. She says she knows they have all put their lives on hold. Ridge says he will always be right there and Spencer is right, she cannot have two men in her life so when she chooses Ridge it will have to be Spencerless. Quinn contemplates it and then calls Katie. She says she is really glad Eric had company to watch the show but she did not think it was appropriate while she was away. She is glad Eric could help her get her son into school and she is not concerned but it doesn't look good. She says she admires Katie and would like to know her better herself so next time call with a heads up so she can be there as well.",
