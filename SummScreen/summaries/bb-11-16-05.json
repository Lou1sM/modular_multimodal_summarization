Unimpressed, Nick sternly advises him that Bridget's future lies with him, not Dante. Though Nick finally storms out, he slips into her bedroom from the outside door and takes a moment to have a chat with their unborn baby. While Eric complains to Taylor about Stephanie's actions, she assures him she feels for him and adds that they are all under a lot of stress. However, Taylor claims that she and Ridge are in a better place now especially since she doesn't have to worry about Brooke anymore. Admitting he's feeling paranoid lately, Eric hints that his relationship with Brooke is very fragile right now and can't let anyone interfere with it. Stephanie asks Ridge if he's willing to end his marriage in order to start a rival company. He demands that he be put in charge today or he will leave and form the new company. Guessing they haven't, Stephanie pointedly asks them if they've discussed this with their spouses. She confirms that as long as he's with Brooke, he'll never be CEO. She also explains that she's selling the BeLief patent to pay for her expenses and growth at Forrester and sends them packing. Eric is next to see Stephanie and after she insults his wife, Stephanie leaks Ridge and Brooke's news about Destiny Designs. Brooke admits to Ridge that she doesn't know if she can start this company with him. As she points out how busy she is, Brooke collapses into his arms just as Eric enters.\n\n\n",
