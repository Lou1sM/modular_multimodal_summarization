Steffy guessed that Ivy had taken Wyatt with her for backup in case Steffy hadn't. Wyatt replied that he was just a cheerleader. Steffy noted that Ivy and Wyatt were getting serious. Ivy asked Wyatt to fill Steffy in on the marketing because Ivy had to get to a fitting.\n\n\nSteffy stated that Ivy wasn't a model. Ivy conveyed that she was doing Thomas a favor. Wyatt quizzically said Thomas had a line of models at his door. Steffy quipped that her brother liked to play hard-to-get. Wyatt said he didn't condone it. Ivy claimed it was just a fitting, and she scampered off.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Wyatt had a problem with Ivy and Thomas working together. Wyatt didn't, but he doubted that work was on Thomas' mind. Steffy felt that if she could put away her differences with Ivy, then Wyatt could do it with Thomas. Wyatt remarked on the fun of watching the cousins spar.\n\n\nSteffy asked if his relationship with Ivy was fun. Wyatt asked what Steffy's interest was in Ivy and Wyatt's relationship. Steffy said things seemed really good between the two, and Wyatt deserved someone who was fully committed to him. Wyatt believed he had it, but there was just one problem. \"Your stupid brother,\" Wyatt quipped.\n\n\nSteffy guessed that Thomas was rubbing people the wrong way, and Wyatt assumed that she'd talked to Liam. Wyatt had been irritated since the last meeting and said Thomas was trying to ensure that the Spencers knew he had it out for them. Steffy suggested that Wyatt not react to it. Wyatt replied that if he ignored it, then guys like Thomas would think they could get away with anything.\n\n\nSteffy asked what Thomas was trying to get away with. \"Being a jerk for starters,\" Wyatt responded. She said she'd called Thomas out on how he'd been in the meeting. Wyatt indicated that he wouldn't have a problem with it -- if that was where it stopped.\n\n\nWyatt accepted instances of conflict in business, but Wyatt didn't like Thomas getting personal. Wyatt relayed that Thomas wasn't even being subtle anymore, but if Thomas thought the Spencers were too comfortable in his family business, then Wyatt believed Thomas was getting too comfortable with Wyatt's girlfriend.\n\n\nWyatt was sick of Thomas thinking he could hit on every woman in the building and acting as if he was the playboy heir to the throne. Steffy said it wasn't always a game for Thomas. Wyatt suggested that she tell Thomas to find someone serious else to be with and someone to teach him respect. \"He doesn't want to learn that lesson from me,\" Wyatt concluded.\n\n\nIn the corridor, people strode by, and Thomas pretended not to be listening at the door of the CEO's office. Michelle, a model, called his name, and he told her that he'd been meaning to message her back. He asked her to text him after her fitting, and they might meet up later.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Caroline didn't think she and Ridge should discuss the topic at the office. Ridge said they shouldn't discuss it at all anymore. She was frustrated because Ridge kept telling her not to stress, \"but you...\" she began. Ridge agreed that he needed to focus on their little family, not the past.\n\n\nIn the hall, Thomas peeked back into the CEO's office. Caroline said Thomas wanted a relationship with Ridge, but Ridge insisted that Thomas would never know.\n\n\nThomas entered. He said the door had been open, and he'd heard his name. Ridge replied that it had been nothing. It hadn't seemed like nothing to Thomas, who stated that he was a big boy and could take whatever they had to say to him.\n\n\nRidge quipped that there were a lot of conversations in the CEO's office, and a lot of names got mentioned. He stated that it had nothing to do with Thomas, who needed to let it go. Thomas had overheard Ridge say that Thomas would never know, and Thomas asked what it was he'd never know.\n\n\nRidge pretended that Caroline had wanted Thomas to know that she thought he could handle more design responsibility and a bigger workload. \"Seriously?\" Thomas asked. Ridge said that he and Caroline were about to have a family and raise a kid, so there would be more on Thomas' plate. Thomas claimed to be ready for it, but Ridge said he hadn't seen the evidence of it.\n\n\nThomas stated that Ridge would. Thomas understood that he still needed to prove himself. Ridge said it was what designers did with every season and every collection. Thomas believed that he could handle it if that was what it took to rid them of the tension between them.\n\n\nThomas left for a fitting. \"That was too close,\" Caroline told Ridge. She was on edge, worrying that Thomas might be outside the door. Ridge tried to calm her down, but she was antsy about how weird it was that Thomas kept walking in on them. Ridge didn't think it was a concern because they wouldn't discuss the issue anymore. Caroline noted that they weren't the only ones discussing it.\n\n\nCaroline griped about Pam, Liam, and Brooke. Caroline was sure someone would put it together. Ridge told her to take a breath, but she retorted that she'd do it when he started treating his son like a trusted team member. Ridge roared that he didn't trust Thomas, and Caroline said to pretend before it blew up in their faces. Hugging her, Ridge promised it would be okay.\n\n\nRidge and Caroline sat on the sofa. As Caroline tried to calm down, she felt the baby move. She put Ridge's hand over her stomach, and he grinned, saying he could feel something. He decided that \"this\" was their truth. He said they'd love each other and be there for the baby always. The couple kissed.\n\n\nIn the design room, Ivy stood on a pedestal in a blue dress. Thomas circled her, and she noted that he was staring at her. He claimed to be taking it all in and asked if he was making her uncomfortable. He wasn't, but she was surprised that he wasn't being flirty. She said she'd been warned about him. He replied that she'd been misinformed, and he had more than corny lines to make a woman feel beautiful.\n\n\nIvy noted that she, Steffy, and Wyatt were curious as to why Ivy was the model. Ivy asked if the fit models had gone on strike. Thomas stated that he'd wanted to see Ivy in the dress because she'd inspired it. Thomas ran his hands along the lines of the gown, strumming her hips and stomach. She was surprised she'd been the inspiration, and he replied that she'd been on his mind a lot.\n\n\nIvy thought it was hard not to think of the person whose life one had saved, but Thomas would have saved anyone from the falling light. Thomas replied that it was true, but he wouldn't have had as much fun. She guessed he was having plenty of fun with the dress. He claimed that the dress represented everything he admired about her, but he also wanted it to capture her unpredictability and sexiness.\n\n\nClearing her throat as he ran his hands up her arms, Ivy admitted that the dress was sexier than she was. Thomas hoped she didn't mind that he'd been fantasizing while designing, and Ivy replied that she couldn't control his imagination. He joked that he couldn't, either, but she told him to try.\n\n\nThomas claimed to be working on it. He said he'd imagined that exact scenario many times. He'd imagined the anticipation of her appointment to try the dress and that it would be just business at first. Once he saw each line that he'd drawn wrapped around her body, he wouldn't be able to help himself.\n\n\nThomas moved in to kiss her. \"Thomas!\" Ivy exclaimed, pulling away.\n\n\nIvy asked what Thomas thought he was doing. Thomas called it kissing. She replied that he couldn't do that, and there was a line. He asked where the line was, and she insisted that it was where she said it was. He asked if she'd liked it. Ivy replied that she had a boyfriend and was trying to keep things professional. Thomas said he didn't see a ring on her finger.\n\n\nIvy asked if any woman without a fianc\u00e9 was fair game. Thomas stated that he was interested in her, not just any woman. Ivy said they'd harmlessly flirted, but a kiss was completely different. He believed it was so because she'd felt something. Ivy claimed to be with Wyatt and said they were very happy. Thomas moved in to kiss her again. She pulled back but then allowed him to kiss her.\n\n\n",
