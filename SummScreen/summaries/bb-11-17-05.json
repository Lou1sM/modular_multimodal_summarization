Then he walks in on them and finds them in each other's arms.  What is he to think?  Brooke tries to explain that she is not involved with Ridge; it is just the stress of all that is happening.  Eric is angry, and tells her that she can't be involved with Ridge, because she loves Nick, but the one thing that he is certain of, is that she isn't in love with him.    \n\n\nBridget laughs as Nick tells the baby what he would do if the baby decided to make an appearance when they were together.  Bridget explains to Nick what a water birth is, and he comically tells her that he will just throw her overboard then.  She tells him that \"they are having their baby in a hospital.\"  He reminds her what she just told him, \"we\" are having the baby.  \n\n\nStephanie tells Thorne that she couldn't talk Ridge into joining them.  She says \"Ridge doesn't want the company for Eric, either, but for himself.\"  She comments that Eric is on the way down to make sure that that Brooke and Ridge working together, doesn't happen.  \n\n\nNick tells Bridget, that the two of them compliment each other and therefore should be together.  He reminds her that way back in the beginning he kept telling her that she deserved better, and she wouldn't take him seriously.  He wants to be back with her and he will do whatever is necessary to make that happen.  She is becoming tired and Nick says that he will leave.  On his way out, he tells her that he loves her.\n\n\nRidge and Brooke both tell Eric that the whole thing they presented to Stephanie was a bluff.  Ridge wanted Forrester Creations, not to start up his own company, but since that can't be, the idea is suddenly becoming more appealing.  They want Eric to work with them, and Ridge wants him especially to know, that he would never stab him in the back.\n\n\nDante enters the bedroom where Bridget is, after returning from a walk on the beach.  He tells her that Nick was there earlier and asked him to leave.  Dante tells her that Nick is no good for her, and she needs to get rid of him.  They (Dante and her) are getting closer, and it is a good thing, so she needs to get Nick out of her mind.\n\n\nStephanie goes to see Ridge.  He tells her that Eric is in a paranoid frenzy.  He also tells her that he and Brooke are still going to start up a new company.  Stephanie tells him that he could eventually have Forrester Creations, but, it is never going to happen and he will never run things around there as long as Brooke is involved.\n\n\nEric tells Brooke at home, that he isn't sure he can go on like this much longer.  He is disappointed that their marriage isn't working.  She tells him that he is concerned about the \"sex.\"  He feels that he has given her the time she asked for, but nothing has changed.  She tells him that she knows that she is letting him down and he is right.  He suggests going away with her, but she says that too much is going on, right now.  She tells him that he is right about it being too long though, and if \"sex\" is what he wants, then they should do it.  She cozies up to him and he backs off, telling her that he wants her to love him.\n\n\nStephanie warns Ridge to be considerate of Taylor.  He better think twice about what this will do to her and as far as Eric goes, she doesn't care, he is a lost cause as far as she is concerned.\n\n\n",
