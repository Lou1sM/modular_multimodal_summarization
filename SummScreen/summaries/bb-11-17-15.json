She walked behind the screen to change out of the blue dress that Thomas had designed for her. When she returned, she advised Thomas that she and Wyatt were a couple.\n\n\nThomas was unconvinced that Wyatt and Ivy belonged together. Thomas maintained that Wyatt had been a familiar shoulder to cry on after Liam had dumped Ivy. He had been convenient, and he had prevented Ivy from moving forward and dating again.\n\n\nIvy argued that Thomas was after every woman at Forrester. Thomas said that Ivy was special. She dazzled whenever she entered a room. Ivy wondered what made her so interesting to Thomas. Thomas said she had class, and even on her worst day, she outclassed everyone in a room at Forrester. Ivy said they were cousins, and he knew nothing about her.\n\n\nThomas noted that they were not blood relatives, and he agreed that they had only seen one another a few times until Ivy had started working at Forrester. Thomas said he wanted to kiss her again, and he grabbed her shoulder, but she pushed him away. Ivy left.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Liam prepared flowers in a vase, and Bill and Katie barged in. Bill advised Liam to pack his bags for Greece. Liam said he couldn't go, but Bill said it was nonnegotiable. Liam said he had plans, and Bill told him he could take Steffy with him. Liam balked, and Katie figured out that Liam was about to propose to Steffy.\n\n\nLiam admitted Katie had guessed right, and Katie arranged the flowers. Bill joked that he felt Liam and Steffy already acted like they were married. Liam pointed out that was why he wanted to do something big and romantic. He noted that when Steffy had first returned, he'd felt they would never get back together again. He didn't want anything to be routine.\n\n\nBill joked that he would hire a skywriter. Bill asked if Liam had a ring. Liam said he was prepared, but he had not yet figured out what to say. Bill said Liam would figure it, and Bill hugged his son.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Wyatt told Steffy that Thomas needed to stop insulting the Spencers. Steffy said that she had spoken to Thomas. Wyatt added that Thomas was romantically in pursuit of Ivy. Steffy doubted that Thomas was after Ivy, but Wyatt said that Thomas was after every woman.\n\n\nWyatt wondered what might have happened if Steffy and Wyatt had connected. Wyatt said that Steffy had given up her life as a party girl in Paris to return to a boring life with Liam. Steffy argued that life with Liam wasn't boring because she had found the man she wanted to be with.\n\n\nWyatt hoped that Liam appreciated Steffy. Steffy said that he did, and she appreciated Wyatt's comments. She liked consistency in men. They agreed they would have been a good couple together.\n\n\nWyatt laughed and said it would have been a daily \"duel to the death.\" Steffy said there was \"no such thing as one perfect match.\" She was happy to return home to Liam every night. Wyatt left.\n\n\nLater, Thomas showed up in Steffy's office, and Steffy wondered what his relationship was with Ivy. Thomas said he had kissed her. Steffy told him to stop because Ivy and Wyatt were a good couple. Thomas was unconvinced. He said that Ivy had kissed him back. Steffy was disgusted.\n\n\nSteffy advised Thomas to stop regressing to high school tactics. Thomas felt he could end up with Ivy or at least have an affair with her. Steffy was disgusted and rolled her eyes.\n\n\nIn Thomas' office at Forrester, Ivy entered to retrieve her purse. She looked at the blue dress that Thomas had designed for her, and she flashed back to Thomas' hands on her body. Wyatt interrupted and asked how the fitting had gone. Ivy replied that it had been fine. Wyatt admired the blue dress that Thomas had designed.\n\n\nWyatt asked to see the dress on Ivy, but Ivy said she didn't want to model it. Wyatt wondered if Thomas had behaved himself, and she said he had. She disclosed that Thomas had designed the dress with her in mind. It had made her uncomfortable.\n\n\nWyatt said that Ivy should not be uncomfortable because she was one of the most beautiful people in the building. Ivy said she wanted to be a good girlfriend. Ivy asked Wyatt to kiss her. He did, and they made out. \n\n\n",

Wyatt reminds her that she used to be someone else until she got hooked up with Liam again.
