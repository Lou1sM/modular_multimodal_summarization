    "tvmega_recap": "Bill works out hard in the office then tells RJ it is his turn. Brooke tells Ridge not to encourage it but RJ did go with Bill but gave him a hard time. Ridge is not sure that it is a good idea for her to punish him by being with Lucifer; they have nothing in common. Ridge tells her that their good times were better than the bad times that she calls wounds. She wonders what it will take for him to find someone prettier or younger ..what it will take for him to walk away. He asks Brooke to trust him; he has something to show her. Bill tells RJ that he is a businessman, not a babysitter, but this is what his mother wanted so go ahead and accept it. Rick is ecstatic that Katie dropped by and tells him that she made a bid on the house so she is now waiting to hear.

She throws off her robe and says she wanted to be a temporary model for their new lingerie line. He says he likes the way she thinks. Katie tells Rick that she really likes the house and a plus being next door to Eric, but one downside \u0096 there is Quinn. Quinn tells Eric that she wakes up every single day grateful for what he has given her. Bill straps the gloves on RJ and shows him a few moves on the bag. It is not a bag; it is the enemy ..the kid who tries to take his lunch money or his girl, so you knock his head off. He wants to see his jab. He wants to see what he has. He wants to see his feet too, any rhythm. He then shows him his sitting room, very few people have ever seen. He shows him money. He has enough stash to last him two lifetimes. He wants him to smell it; take a whiff. Lying in bed, Eric tells Quinn that she completely changed his life and he wants to spend the rest of his life like this. Rick tells Katie that if she gets the house he will get her a pair of binoculars so she can keep an eye on Quinn. Katie laughs and says she is trying to keep good thoughts but she cannot see how Eric could end up with Quinn. Quinn is disarmed when Eric tells her that he got out of the house today to go next door .and that Katie is thinking of buying it. Brooke asks Ridge why he brought her to this spot, Stephanie's grave. Ridge explains to Brooke that he comes here often and feels closer to his mother. And he is glad that his mother told Brooke finally that she loved her ..he loves her too, always has.",
