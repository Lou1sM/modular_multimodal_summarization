Thomas wanted to make a bet that he could do it, but Steffy refused. Thomas dared her to call his bluff, but Steffy told him to stop.\n\n\nSteffy called Thomas childish, but he said they had made similar bets in past years as adults. Steffy said it was wrong. She said that Ivy and Wyatt seemed like a good and happy couple. Steffy accused Thomas of targeting Wyatt. She felt he had issues with anyone named Spencer. Steffy maintained that Wyatt didn't deserve Thomas' wrath, and she believed Ivy was committed to Wyatt and wouldn't cheat on him.\n\n\nThomas countered that Ivy had dated Wyatt on the rebound after a failed relationship with Liam. Steffy said it was a not a game. Thomas said he was going to get her away from Wyatt. Steffy ordered Thomas to get out of her office. Thomas took that as a dare.\n\n\nIn the jewelry office at Forrester, Wyatt and Ivy talked about how much they cared for each other. Wyatt kissed her and said he had to leave on a business trip to San Francisco. He had to meet his mother on the jet. They would be gone overnight. Ivy was disappointed that she would be alone that night.\n\n\nWyatt tried to talk her into joining him and making it a long weekend. He encouraged her to pack a bag and meet them at the jet. Ivy said that Ridge wanted some new designs on his desk the next day, so she couldn't leave.\n\n\nIvy kissed Wyatt and thanked him for being so good to her. \"While I'm gone, keep a safe distance from Thomas,\" Wyatt suggested. Wyatt said he would miss her, and he had visions of her on her side of the bed all alone. Ivy confessed that she didn't want to stay at his house alone because it creeped her out. She said she would stay at the Forrester mansion and spend some time with her Uncle Eric. They kissed. \"Hurry back,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nIn Steffy's office, Wyatt stopped in to pick up some things before he left for San Francisco. Steffy asked Wyatt if things were going well with Ivy, and he said they were. Wyatt said that Liam seemed happy with Steffy. She said they had waited a long time, and she fell more in love with him every day. Steffy was glad they could all get along.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Bill and Katie were happy for Liam because he had decided to ask Steffy to marry him. Liam said he didn't want to live without her. Liam admitted that he was nervous. Katie and Bill assured him that Steffy would never refuse his proposal. Lim agreed, but he said she was mysterious. They all agreed that Steffy and Liam belonged together. \"Don't screw it up,\" Bill ordered.\n\n\nBill and Katie hoped that Wyatt could also find the right woman. Liam said he felt that Wyatt and Ivy were going strong. Bill hugged Liam, and then Katie hugged him too. Liam thanked them for their support.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Thomas was on the phone. He told someone that she looked amazing in a dress, and he promised to call later, but when Ivy entered, he said he had to leave.\n\n\nThomas greeted Ivy and called her \"the most beautiful hallucination.\" Ivy said that she planned to stay at the mansion because Quinn and Wyatt had to fly to San Francisco. She admitted it made her uncomfortable to stay at the beach house by herself. She planned to change her clothes and make some soup. Ivy went upstairs and Thomas looked thoughtful.\n\n\nLater, Ivy entered the kitchen and found Thomas had set a table for them, and he had wine ready. He told her that he had ordered dinner from her favorite restaurant. She thanked him for his thoughtfulness. He toasted to their success and their endeavors and to the elegance and grace of Ivy.\n\n\nIvy laughed uncomfortably. She recalled that he'd been on the phone earlier, making plans with someone. Thomas admitted that he had changed his plans after Ivy entered. He said he couldn't stop thinking about her. \"That kiss meant something -- to both of us,\" he said. He promised they would have a night to remember. Ivy smiled nervously.\n\n\nAt Liam's, Liam had lit candles, and Steffy entered and found roses and romance. She thanked him and kissed him. Liam said they had been so busy that they needed to take time for themselves. \"It would be nice to return the focus to us,\" he said. They sat down on the couch, and Liam noted that Steffy was distracted.\n\n\nLiam wanted Steffy's undivided attention. He poured wine and told her to leave the workday behind. She said she had let go of the past and moved forward. Steffy said it was because of Liam.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy discussed that Wyatt and Ivy really cared about one another too. Steffy wondered if Ivy was serious about Wyatt. Liam said he felt Wyatt and Ivy had a shot at happiness. Steffy looked worried.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Thomas won't let up. He keeps badgering Steffy to bet with him that he can be successful in taking Ivy away from Wyatt. Quinn and Wyatt have an overnight business trip and he kisses Ivy and says he needs a few more of those to tide him over. He wishes she could go along but she laments she has designs due on Ridge's desk tomorrow morning, so no can do. He does warn her to stay clear of Thomas as much as she can while he is gone. She even says she will not spend the night in the beach house as being alone there would creep her out. She will stay with Uncle Eric at his house. Katie congratulates Liam, and Bill is happy. He always said that Steffy was the woman for him and now he is going to do something about it. So don't screw this up. He just hopes Wyatt will be as smart in finding his woman. Katie says perhaps he already has. Steffy won't make the bet with Thomas, not for money, dinner, nothing. She sees how happy Wyatt and Ivy are and thinks this is wrong. He takes that as a challenge. Besides Wyatt has not put a ring on her finger so Thomas feels justified in going after anyone he wants. Steffy tells him this is not a game. She sees Wyatt before he leaves for San Francisco and asks about him and Ivy. He wishes she were going with him but can't this time. Thomas hangs up from talking to a late night booty call when Ivy walks into the house. Steffy walks into the cliff house with lighted candles everywhere and dozens of roses. She thanks Liam while kissing him, then goes to change into something more comfortable. Liam can tell her mind is still at the office and he wants all of her. She mentions Wyatt and Ivy and he sees she cares about them too. Liam laments he thinks they are good together also. Wyatt is a good guy even though he is misguided at times. Ivy comes downstairs to find that Thomas wanted to share a special meal with her since it is her first time back in a while. He has ordered her favorite meal from a restaurant and pours drinks and wants to offer a toast. She asks about the phone call she heard him hang up on. He wonders if she is jealous. He says he cancelled those plans the second he saw her walk through the door. He can not stop thinking about their kiss and here they are alone in this big old house and it could be a night to remember.",
