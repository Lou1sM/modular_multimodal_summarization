    "soap_central": "\n\n\nBehind the scenes of the fashion show at Forrester, Ridge and Caroline discussed Rick's vendetta against them. Ridge said that Caroline's debut as a couture designer would be a big hit.\n\n\nRidge added that Rick's reaction was because of Ridge, but Caroline argued that they both shared the blame. Ridge received a text message, and he announced that Rick had another change. Caroline told him to leave. Ridge said things always had a way of working themselves out. Ridge left, and Caroline fixed her hair in a mirror. She saw her Uncle Bill behind her. \"I thought you might need me,\" Bill said. He hugged her.\n\n\nBill told Caroline that she should be happy because her debut was going to be incredible, but Caroline was sad. \"Rick and I are not in a good place,\" she said. \"Because of Ridge,\" Bill observed.\n\n\nCaroline tried to explain that she and Ridge had experienced something very rare. Bill worried that Caroline had allowed herself to fall for \"Forrester.\" Caroline shook her head. She said it had been a creative rush, excitement, and the honor of being with Ridge. She claimed they were \"creative souls melded together.\" Bill covered his eyes.\n\n\n\"It was really powerful,\" Caroline said. Bill credited Ridge. \"He's got game,\" Bill said. Bill maintained that Ridge had dazzled Caroline, who had been sucked into hero worship. \"We were just working,\" she said. She added that it might have been a crush or something more.\n\n\nBill asked if Caroline had been unhappy in her marriage. Caroline had not been unhappy. She said Rick's resulting reaction had been stupid and incomprehensible.\n\n\nBill worried that Ridge had used Caroline's feelings to strengthen his bid for CEO. Caroline looked unhappy. Bill felt she had confirmed his assumptions. Caroline said that the feelings weren't one-sided. \"It's too hard to explain,\" Caroline said.\n\n\nCaroline maintained that it was over, and her only focus was to get her husband back if it was possible. Bill insisted that Ridge had been older and should have known better. Bill reminded Caroline that she had married Rick, and she was a Spencer. \"Forrester does not get a pass on this one,\" Bill said.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Maya and Rick discussed the big fashion event had no room for failure on any level. Rick had changed the lineup again. Maya said that she was nervous because she had never modeled couture before. Rick said she would be fine, and Maya cooed that it had been sexy to watch Rick work. Rick teased that Maya had been distracting him. Maya curled herself around Rick and whispered that it was a preview of what would happen later that evening.\n\n\nRidge entered and asked what Rick had wanted. Rick noted that Ridge seemed irritated. Ridge agreed. Rick said that he had tweaked the lineup again. Ridge worried that Rick had made too many changes to things that were not his expertise.\n\n\nRick said that he was CEO and would change whatever he wanted. Maya piped up and told Ridge to show more respect. Ridge told her to stop. She argued, but he shushed her.\n\n\nRidge warned that Rick had sabotaged the company and it would affect his position. Maya tried to say something, but Ridge ignored her. Maya said she had every right to be there. She snarked that Ridge had no right to try to kick her out of the office, but Rick told her to get ready for the show. Maya left, and Ridge advised Rick that he would sink Forrester and lose Caroline for good if he didn't get past his vengeance. Rick looked uncomfortable.\n\n\nRidge knew that Rick had a vendetta against Ridge, but he worried that Rick would hurt everyone. Maya headed toward the door, and Ridge stopped her. \"Break a leg,\" Ridge told her sarcastically.\n\n\nRidge reminded Rick that everyone knew that Rick had been angry, but Ridge added that Rick should have taken it out on Ridge -- not the company or Caroline.\n\n\n\"Stop making stupid choices,\" Ridge commanded. Ridge advised that Rick needed to dump Maya and return to his beautiful and talented wife. Rick taunted that Ridge had forgotten to mention what a good kisser Caroline had been.\n\n\nRidge argued that Ridge and Caroline were artists, and their feelings had been innocent. Ridge begged Rick to give Caroline a few minutes alone later that evening. \"Don't punish her anymore,\" he said.\n\n\nRidge encouraged Rick to rebuild his relationship with Caroline. Ridge added that it would kill him to think Rick had let the best thing in his life get away because of something Ridge had done. Ridge walked out. Rick looked thoughtful.\n\n\nMaya returned and asked if Rick was okay. \"How's it feel out there?\" Rick asked about the showroom. Maya answered that there was a lot of energy and anticipation. She added the dresses were beautiful. Maya worried that Rick seemed distant, but he said he had a million things on his mind.\n\n\nMaya had promised to make Rick proud when she walked down the runway in her first couture gown. Rick was called to the showroom.\n\n\nLater, Maya encountered Caroline, and they argued. \"Rick still loves me,\" Caroline said. Maya advised Caroline to let Rick go, but Caroline vowed to never give up on Rick. Caroline said Maya wanted all the Forrester perks and privileges, and Rick was the vehicle. Maya admitted that she would take care of Rick and his wealth.\n\n\nCaroline said that Rick would see through Maya at some point. Maya maintained that Rick knew Maya -- there were no surprises. In contrast, Maya accused Caroline of running around with Ridge behind Rick's back. Caroline warned that Maya had started a fire she might not be able to put out. Maya looked defiant.\n\n\nOn the rooftop, Ridge looked out over the side of the building, and Bill joined him. \"We've got some business,\" Bill said. Bill accused Ridge of preying on and discarding women. Bill promised to keep Ridge away from both Caroline and Katie. \"You mess with Spencer women, expect me to be in your face,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill reminded Ridge that he had been in love with Katie -- the woman with the red string around her finger. \"Remember her, Mr. Poetry?\" Bill asked. \"I do love her,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nBill accused Ridge of using Caroline, but Ridge said Bill hadn't been there. \"You didn't see what happened,\" Ridge said. He tried to explain that it was two artists, and Bill said that he had heard all of it from Caroline.\n\n\n\"Now it's done,\" Ridge said. Ridge and Bill argued about Bill being self-righteous. Ridge reminded Bill that he had thrown Ridge out of a helicopter. Bill told him to stop crying about it.\n\n\nBill accused Ridge of seducing his niece and leaving casualties in his wake -- including both Caroline and Katie. Bill vowed to defend the Spencer women, and he punched Ridge in the face. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Maya tells Madison that this is the first showing with Rick as CEO so everything must be perfect and failing is not an option. Maya tells Rick that she is a little nervous as she has never walked couture before. But mostly she is excited as it is a big day for Forrester ..and for Rick. She says he is very sexy as she watches him work. He's a great CEO. Ridge interrupts and asks what does Rick want now. Rick says he is sorry if he drug him away from Caroline. Ridge retorts that he's not going to get into this with Rick today. If he wants to help him put on this show, fine, if not, that's okay too. Maya pipes up that Ridge is so disrespectful. Rick is his boss and CEO of this company and he should not be talking to him like this. Ridge asks again what does Rick want. He answers that he has tweaked the lineup a little. Ridge says he has already done that. Rick says and he will continue until he is satisfied. Ridge looks at it and tells Rick that he is the designer, not Rick, so this is his job. Rick says he listened to his comments but he has final decision and it stands. And he makes decisions as he sees fit and if Ridge doesn't like it, then move on and take his girlfriend, Caroline, with him. Maya says sounds like a great idea to her. Ridge barks that she is not in this conversation. Ridge says that is rich, having his model girlfriend make decisions for the company. He better get it together or he is going to sink this company and lose Caroline for good. Yes he kissed his wife. That is on him. He should not put this on the company or Caroline. Stop being so stupid. He should blame Ridge not Caroline. He gets it. Rick doesn't tolerate disloyalty but don't make Caroline suffer anymore. The trust has been broken but they can fix that so don' throw it all away with this beautiful, smart, amazing woman. Dump Maya and go back to his beautiful wife. He says they are brothers and have not always got along but it would kill him to think that Rick would throw away the best thing in his life for something Ridge should not have done. So just do him a favor and after the showing tonight give Caroline five minutes and let her have her say. He owes it to Caroline and to himself. Bill hugs Caroline and congratulates her on her first showing for couture, yet says she looks so sad. She admits that she and Rick are not in a good place. Bill says he knows .because of Ridge. Katie told him. She walked out on Ridge but she is back now. He really wants to know with everything Caroline had at sake why this happened. He will not judge her. He just wants to understand .when she had her career, her family, her marriage and yet allowed herself to fall for Forrester. She tries to explain her crazy connection with Ridge while they were designing together .this creative rush and excitement, nothing like she had ever felt before. It's like their creative souls melded together. Bill says she must have had a little crush on him. She says she doesn't know, it was all so stupid now. Bill adds and Ridge used that to strengthen his bid for CEO. He takes her silence as a yes. She asks him not to blame Ridge as she was involved as well. Bill steams and says he sure as hell does blame Ridge as he is older and knows better. He does not get a pass on this one. Bill finds Ridge on The Rooftop and sidles up to him and says they have some business. Maya tells Rick that today she will be walking for him. As he leaves Caroline comes back stage and Maya corners her and says Rick is busy and besides does not want to see her. Caroline says she knows they aren't really friends but she thought now they were cool. Maya answers that she could not sit by and watch while she and Ridge carried on behind Rick's back. Caroline threatens that Maya should ease up some and better not start a fire she can not put out. Ridge asks Bill what does he possibly want with him ..and he has no time for this, the fashion show. Bill says he is not giving him a choice. That is his niece, young, impressionable and easily swayed by a predator like Ridge. He says Ridge collects women and then discards them when another looks his way. He wants to tell him something. He will do everything in his power to keep her from being his next victim. If he messes with Spencer women he will be in his face and that is a promise. And that means Katie as well. Surely Mr. Poetry remembers her with the little red string on her finger. Ridge says yes and he loves her. But Bill wasn't there when two artists worked and it came off the page and now it is done. Perhaps his throwing Ridge out the helicopter had something to do with it. Bill is incensed and tells him to lay off and stop freaking crying about that or is he going to play the victim forever. Ridge started that party and Bill finished it yet now is trying to blame all of this on Bill. That works as long as he gets what he wants. Ridge Forrester, Mr. Designer Extraordinaire, Mr. Entitled, Mr. Untouchable. Maybe he does not think anyone will stand up to him against those women. Well there was only one miscalculation, and that would be him. He hauls off and sucker punches Ridge.",
