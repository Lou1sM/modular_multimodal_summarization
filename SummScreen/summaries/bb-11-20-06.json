He told her he missed her and admitted that he'd had to tell the truth when he had been on the stand because he knew that she had loved Darla and had never wanted to hurt her. Storm walked in and informed them that it was time to go to court. Even though Taylor thought she was going to prison, she told Thorne she could deal with it, since she had his support. Thorne told Taylor he didn't want to lose her too. \n\n\nAt the courthouse, everyone fearfully awaited Taylor's verdict. Taylor was found not guilty of vehicular manslaughter, and with Storm's expertise, all the other charges were dropped. Taylor only had to serve six months probation and community service. After leaving the courthouse, everyone headed to Taylor's to celebrate. Felicia commended Storm on his excellent defense.\n\n\nRidge thanked Thorne again for aiding Taylor. Thorne asked Ridge's permission to pursue Taylor romantically. Ridge said he was cool with it as long as Thorne didn't call her \"Doc.\" Taylor made a speech telling everyone that she had learned that alcohol never solved problems. She thanked Storm for all his help and promised to honor Darla by trying to live an exemplary life from that moment on.\n\n\nTaylor was excited to see Aly, and they shared a tender moment. The little girl asked Taylor about her trip to London, and Taylor promised to tell her all about it one day. Later when they were alone, Thorne carried Taylor's baggage up to her room.

He wanted her to be ready to help when it was time for him to start running Forrester. Realizing the truth in his words, Jackie decided to rest.\n\n\nWhen they were alone, Donna questioned Nick about what he'd meant when he'd said he would be running Forrester. Nick explained that he had given the Forresters a choice: either sell the company or take the chance that Stephanie might end up in jail. Donna thought he was being a little harsh, knocking all the Forresters out of their company. Nick felt justified after what Stephanie had done to his mom. He also thought Brooke would get over Ridge if Ridge didn't have a job at Forrester. Donna didn't think it would be that easy to keep Ridge and Brooke apart.\n\n\n",
