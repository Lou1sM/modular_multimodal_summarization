Thomas hadn't responded to her yet. Liam remarked upon the intensifying storm and how good it was for the drought. He suggested that they sleep in and celebrate. Steffy didn't react to the word \"celebrate.\"\n\n\nLiam went upstairs to close windows, and Steffy called Wyatt to see if he was ready for the meeting and if he'd called to wish Ivy goodnight. She hinted that he should do it and score some points. When Liam returned, she ended the call. Liam wondered if she was nervous for Wyatt and his meeting. Steffy said she'd just wanted all to make sure everything was okay.\n\n\nThe thunder startled Steffy, and she suggested that she and Liam return to cuddling. Her phone sounded, receiving the bet comment from Thomas. She frowned. Liam noticed, and she said it was her brother being himself. Liam decided that he wanted to unplug from the devices and have her to himself.\n\n\nSteffy liked unplugging and wanted to do it more often. She never wanted to be \"that couple.\" She didn't want to be at a restaurant together but completely into their phones. She knew women who'd been \"so in love,\" but then their relationships had eventually taken a back seat to other things.\n\n\nLiam said he wasn't worried about their connection, and after the honeymoon, kids, and jobs, they'd still find times for rainy nights. Steffy started prattling in agreement but stopped short, realizing that Liam had said honeymoon. She asked what he was saying.\n\n\nLiam said that when Steffy had been in Paris, he'd missed the quiet moments just as much as the wild ones. Steffy had energized him and made him take chances that he wouldn't have otherwise -- like the one he was about to take right then.\n\n\nLiam knelt before Steffy and said she inspired him to hold her but also to dance, laugh, and scream in the rain. She was the only woman to draw out both instincts with him. He thought they'd be great parents and balance quiet moments with stormy ones. He wanted to spend his life with her, if she'd let him, and he wanted to keep making more history with her.\n\n\nLiam opened a ring box and asked Steffy to marry him. The glassy-eyed Steffy exclaimed that she would. A montage of their relationship played. He placed the ring on her finger, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn San Francisco, Quinn tried to assess Wyatt's anxiety about Thomas and Ivy being at the house together. Wyatt wasn't worried about them living together; he just didn't like Thomas' flirting. The house was enormous, and he figured that they weren't even in the same wing and didn't cross paths.\n\n\nQuinn, who'd been drinking from a mini bottle, was sleepy and decided to head to her room. Wyatt told her not to stay up sexting Deacon. She said the same went for Wyatt and Ivy. Quinn burst into laughter and said to never mind. Wyatt told her that she was rude and hurtful.\n\n\nQuinn didn't see Ivy as a sexter and asked if Ivy didn't remind him of the goody-two-shoes Hope. Wyatt asked how being moral and good was bad. Quinn asked how things had turned out with Hope. He asserted that it wouldn't mean that he and Ivy wouldn't turn out well, and he wanted Quinn to stop making him get into his head about it. He was with a loyal, trusting woman, and he liked it.\n\n\nQuinn wanted Wyatt to be happy, but she wondered if Ivy's pollyanna persona would hold his attention -- especially when another woman had been on his mind a short time back. Assuming she meant Steffy, Wyatt said there had never been a chance; Steffy had been on a mission to get Liam, whom she had gotten, and there was no way Wyatt could have changed her mind.\n\n\nQuinn was annoyed that a woman would waste her time on a \"twit\" like Liam. Wyatt hoped Quinn's comments didn't mean she was about to do anything weird again. Quinn denied she would. He said he just had to \"check in\" on it occasionally. He didn't want her thinking that he was upset about things not working out with Steffy. He had no reason to be because he was with Ivy, and he loved Ivy.\n\n\nIn the Forrester kitchen, Thomas said he'd been unable to sleep while wondering if Ivy was also thinking there was something better to do with the person across the hallway. Ivy walked around the island to separate them. She asked if he'd been imagining them playing bridge, but he replied that it was a four-person game. He was thinking of chess. She claimed to be a good player and quipped that people didn't last very long with her.\n\n\nThomas rounded the island, and when thunder and lightning startled Ivy, she bumped into his chest. He figured that she was scared, and chess might be a good idea. Placing his hands on her waist, he asked if it would be her room or his. Ivy removed his hands and said he was really something, but one thing she knew for sure was that playing chess wouldn't help either of them sleep.\n\n\nAs Ivy hurried out, Thomas was saying, \"If you change your mind...\" He meandered into the foyer, where Ivy was headed up the staircase. She told him she'd see him in the morning. After she'd gone, he checked his phone and sent Steffy a reply, telling her she'd seriously lose the bet.\n\n\nIn her room, Ivy muted her phone ringer. There was a knock at the door, and she said, \"Come in.\" Thomas opened the door and stood on the threshold, staring at her. She asked if he needed anything, and he replied that they both did. Ivy stated that she was with Wyatt. Thomas replied that Wyatt was in a different city, but she said that didn't matter.\n\n\nThomas asked if Wyatt appreciated her and told her how brilliant and sexy she was. Ivy said Wyatt did. Thomas didn't think a guy like Wyatt could possibly appreciate her the way that Thomas did. He pulled her in for a kiss. Ivy pulled back, saying his name like a curse word. She said she'd told him that she wasn't interested in that -- or him -- not like that.\n\n\nThomas asked if Ivy didn't feel what he was feeling. She exclaimed that she was with Wyatt. Thomas persisted, saying they were young, and it was the time of their lives to be wild, do something daring, and do something crazy. He asked her to be a little crazy with him.\n\n\nThomas kissed Ivy, and Ivy gave in. As they fell onto the bed together, Wyatt called her. She couldn't hear the phone ringer because she'd turned it off.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt tells his mom that it does not bother him that Ivy and Thomas are staying under the same roof. The house is so big there is no reason for them to even cross paths. Now Thomas flirting with Ivy does bother him. Liam pours wine and says looks like a lot of rain is on the way. Thomas tells Ivy that he could not sleep and he was wondering if she was lying awake too thinking what he was. There must be more to do than just sleeping across the hall from each other. Steffy calls Wyatt to make sure everything is okay. He says they are coming back right after the meeting and he will fill her in then. He just wishes Ivy were here. Ivy tells Thomas perhaps they can play a card game .but bridge takes four, something like chess maybe with just two. People rarely beat her. The lightening scares Ivy and she lands in Thomas's waiting arms. She says playing games is not going to help either of them. She goes upstairs to bed. Thomas says he is going to make a snack but he doesn't. He texts Steffy that she is going to lose the bet. Steffy clears the text when Liam says he wants all of her, no more messaging. She laments that she never wants him to underestimate his importance in her life. He says she energizes him like no one else does. He wants to hold her tight and hold her safe. That is the only woman he can say that about. He wants to spend the rest of his life with her if she will let him. Suddenly he pulls out a box with a huge ring and asks if she will marry him. She says yes as she kisses him. He slips the ring on her finger and she kisses him again. Wyatt debunks Quinn's idea that Ivy, sweet Ivy, is a lot like his former goody two shoes Hope. He sees nothing wrong with that. Quinn just wants him to be happy and if that is Ivy then she is okay with that. He says Steffy came back to town with one thing on her mind \u0096 Liam, so he never had a chance with her. He is with Ivy and he is committed to her now. Thomas knocks on Ivy's door and without covering up she tells him to come in. He comes closer and asks her if Wyatt appreciates her the way he does. She lets him kiss her and returns the kiss. But she tells Thomas she can not do this. She is with Wyatt. He tells her to be a little crazy, be crazy with him. He kisses her again and she returns it. He lays her back on the bed while nuzzling her neck. Wyatt is on the phone texting her but she is paying no attention to the phone.",
