    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Rick's office, Rick slammed down some receipts and asked Maya how it was possible. An assistant dropped off more dress orders, and the stunned Maya guessed that Rick's lead model knew how to strut her stuff. Rick said she'd done well, but Ridge and Caroline were the successes. Maya contended that the success belonged to the CEO, who'd get rich off the collection.\n\n\nWith the sweep of Rick's hand, receipts flew off the desk. Rick detested the idea of profiting off his wife's cheating, and in his view, the line should have sucked. \"These prices --they're laughable. I hate this!\" Rick roared.\n\n\nLooking up, Rick saw Eric grimacing in the doorway. Maya tried to talk up the showing to Eric, but he demanded that she let him talk to his son alone. At Rick's nod, Maya left.\n\n\nMaya returned to the showroom to talk to the remaining guests, but they barely paid attention to her as they chatted together on their way out. Carter chuckled, saying it was as if people had no idea how big and important she was. She retorted that he seemed to be clueless, too. She touted the success of the line, but Carter hoped she knew it was due to the designs, not her runway sashay.\n\n\nMaya praised the CEO, who'd priced the gowns high. Carter wasn't convinced that profit had been Rick's motive. Maya admitted that Rick wasn't happy about Ridge and Caroline's partnership paying off but claimed Rick had seen the bigger picture, which was the fortune Forrester would make. Carter assumed she'd expect more overpriced jewelry. \"Maybe Rick's shopping right now,\" she replied.\n\n\nCarter conveyed that breakups weren't always permanent. Maya said he was great, but she didn't feel for him anymore. Scoffing, Carter said he meant Rick and Caroline. Maya believed that she and Rick were solid, and the CEO and his model had made a fairytale romance. Carter said she thought she was Cinderella at the ball, but she might be a stepsister cramming her foot into Caroline's shoe.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Eric was outraged that Rick had set Caroline and Ridge up to fail. Rick stated that either the pair would flop or Forrester would win, and Forrester was getting orders for record-setting prices. Eric argued that a temporary boost in sales meant nothing if the CEO was acting like a petulant child. Disgusted by Rick for flaunting his affair with Maya, Eric said Rick was so determined to take Caroline down that he'd sink the line and humiliate himself and Forrester. \"You're CEO now. Act like it!\" Eric roared.\n\n\nRick didn't think his personal life had any bearing on his job, but Eric contended that Rick was married to a designer, sleeping with a model, and trying to kill Caroline's line. Rick asked why Forrester should profit off something as dirty as what Ridge and Caroline had done. \"The great partnership that ended my marriage. Why would I want her to succeed?\" Rick asked.\n\n\n\"Because it's your job,\" Eric countered, grasping his son's shoulders. He believed that Rick was lashing out because he loved Caroline. The anguish had led Rick to make terrible decisions for the company and for himself as a man. Eric insisted that Maya was using Rick, but Rick disagreed and asserted that, if anything, he was using Maya. \"For what? To try to forget Caroline?\" Eric replied.\n\n\nRick stated that Caroline had sneaked off with Ridge. Dismissing the notion, Eric relayed that she'd made a mistake and had asked for forgiveness. Eric suggested that Rick give it to her. Rick asked what would happen if he didn't. Eric replied that he'd fire Rick as CEO if he didn't reconcile with his wife.\n\n\nRick asserted that Eric couldn't fire Rick over that, but Eric said he'd fire Rick for not working toward Forrester's best interests. Rick claimed to want to be with Maya. \"Oh, stop it,\" Eric replied, \"a few kisses between Ridge and Caroline, and you want to move another woman into your mother's house?\" Eric felt that Rick should be grateful that Caroline would still entertain him after that.\n\n\nRick uttered that Caroline had betrayed him, but Eric thought it was nonsense. Eric admitted that she'd gotten out of hand; however, Rick's behavior had been much worse. Eric saw Caroline as the future of Forrester and believed that Ridge could mentor her into being a future lead designer. Rick didn't disagree with that but said he didn't have to be married to the woman for it to happen.\n\n\n\"You promised me!\" Eric yelled. Eric recalled that Rick had promised to run the company fairly, and Eric was deeply disappointed in Rick. Eric turned his back on Rick, whose eyes watered with tears. Rick said Eric didn't understand what it had done to him. \"Ridge of all people!\" Rick yelled, wiping hot tears on his cheeks.\n\n\nEric insisted that Rick had to be a man. Eric knew that Rick was hurt and embarrassed, but Eric couldn't depend upon Rick if Rick kept making bitter decisions. Rick asked if Eric would really push him out. \"Absolutely,\" Eric replied. He advised Rick to show Eric the kind of dedicated, disciplined man that Rick was. Eric wanted to see Rick as the kind of man who'd bounce back from adversity better than before, because if Rick didn't stop the foolishness, he was done.\n\n\nRick didn't recall Eric serving out his years as CEO in marital bliss. He remembered that Eric had been with other women and models. Rick accused Eric of trying to hold his son to a standard that he hadn't lived up to himself. Eric admitted that it was exactly what he was doing.\n\n\nEric explained that marriage was hard, and bad things happened. Eric hadn't developed a real appreciation for Stephanie until the very end. To him, it was clear that Caroline loved Rick, and Eric didn't want Rick to wait as long as Eric had with Stephanie to tell Caroline what Rick felt. Rick claimed it was different, but Eric said to do it or be done. \"Man up, Rick. Man up,\" Eric said and left.\n\n\nBackstage, Caroline iced Ridge's jaw and said she'd never forget the success they'd had that day. She was upset that Bill had fought Ridge. Ridge replied that Bill had been defending her honor. She couldn't believe that her loved ones were hurt due to her falling for Ridge. Ridge figured that she was being emotional; however, Caroline affirmed that it was true; she'd fallen for Ridge.\n\n\nCaroline figured that Rick might be acting out because he sensed her feelings. She agonized over causing Rick and Ridge pain, but Ridge tried to get her to stop putting all the blame upon herself. Caroline said that if she hadn't been in Los Angeles, none of it would have happened. He added that they wouldn't have had the line, but she rationalized that he would have reached out to Eric for help.\n\n\nRidge didn't believe it would have worked. \"There's something about you. Man...there's something about you, the way we connect -- and it's -- and it's something,\" Ridge told her. The frantic Caroline said the connection had pushed Rick away from her and would probably push Katie away from Ridge. Caroline decided that she had to go back to New York and get away from \"all you people.\" Ridge tried to stop her, but insisting she had to go, Caroline fled the room.\n\n\nRidge pursued Caroline to the sky lounge. He jokingly thanked her for meeting him up there to clean up. Caroline gasped at the disaster that Bill and Ridge had made of the place and said it was the precise reason she had to leave. Ridge said leaving wouldn't make things better for anyone; however, Caroline replied that Rick wouldn't have to see her, and she wouldn't have to see Ridge.\n\n\nRidge said to forget about him, but Caroline insisted that she couldn't. Calming her down, he said she had to get it together because freaking out and running away wouldn't solve things. He advised her to stay put, work through it, and make Rick see that he was holding up the marriage.\n\n\nCaroline asked what of her and Ridge. She realized that he no longer needed her to design and had probably never needed her to begin with. \"I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,\" he said, hugging her.\n\n\nCaroline and Ridge went to Rick's old office to continue talking. She complained that she'd begged Rick. She'd even been willing to forgive his indiscretions with Maya, but it just kept going on and on. Caroline wondered if she should let it drive her from her job and Ridge. She said she might be glad that Rick had showed that side of himself, and it might mean that she shouldn't return to Rick.\n\n\nWhen designing with Ridge, Caroline had experienced an intimacy she hadn't deemed possible. She hadn't allowed herself to admit it, but in a bizarre way, it seemed that Caroline Spencer and Ridge Forrester were \"coming full circle.\" Ridge stepped closer, but a knock at the door repelled him from her.\n\n\nRick entered, and Ridge assumed he was about to get beaten up again. Rick wanted to talk to Caroline about \"us,\" but Caroline said Rick had made it apparent that there was no \"us.\" Rick asked Ridge to give them a moment, but Caroline tugged Ridge's arm and said he wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\nRick decided that he'd speak in front of Ridge. Rick told Caroline that he'd made a mistake. He'd overreacted because he'd been filled with hurt and jealousy, but he didn't want their marriage to end. Caroline stared coldly at her husband but shed a tear when he said that losing her would be like losing everything in his life. \"I need you. Could you please forgive me?\" Rick asked. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Caroline helps Ridge clean up his bloodied and bruised face. He says Bill was defending her honor. She says Ridge is in a committed relationship and she is happily married and yet she fell for him. Now other people she cares about are suffering. He holds her hand tenderly. He says do not take all of this on herself. Rick is having a tantrum and that is different. She cries all of this is her fault and she has to get out of Los Angeles and go back to New York as she has caused too much damage. She brushes past and he can't stop her. When Rick is shown all the orders from the showing, Maya grabs them from his hand and toots her own horn by saying she guesses the lead model knew how to strut her stuff. He says they were Caroline's idea so she gets credit. Maya says but Rick is CEO and he is the one who will get filthy rich. He snaps yeah he will get filthy rich because his wife was unfaithful; he has the golden touch. He says he hates this. At these prices the whole line should have sunk. Eric walks in to hear that. Eric says he wants to talk to his son. Maya pipes up how great the showing was. Eric tells her to give them the room. She looks at Rick who gives her the okay nod to leave. Eric tells him to stop this foolishness now! He laments that Rick set them up to fail. Rick counters that it was a win/win. Either it would be a flop or FC would get rich. Eric gets in his face and tells Rick to knock that smug smile off his face. Those temporary sales won't mean a thing if the public finds out the CEO is acting like a petulant child. Eric points his finger at Rick and tells him to stop this foolishness right now ..shacking up with Maya and flaunting it in front of Caroline and everyone .and now to the point of sabotaging the whole collection. He barks at Rick that he is humiliating himself and the company and he is CEO so act like it. Rick glares at him and says his personal relationships has zero bearings to his capability to being CEO. Eric reminds him that he is married to the designer yet sleeping with the lead model so of course it has bearings. Rick says why should FC profit from something so tainted and dirty. Ridge and Caroline created that line so they can sink with it. He sees no reason that he should want her to succeed. Eric says Rick loves Caroline and that is why he is lashing out but he is making terrible decisions for the company and for himself as well. And Maya is using him. Rick says no, if anything he is using her. Eric tells him do not lose his marriage over this. Rick can't get past that Caroline lied to him. Eric says she made a mistake but she has apologized and he suggests that Rick accepts it and gives it to her. And if he doesn't reconcile Eric will fire him as CEO. Maya tries to get amongst the press and they all leave. Carter stands close by and laughs at Maya that they seem clueless just how important she is. She gloats to him that she and Rick are solid so there is no way he is going back to Caroline. The CEO and his lead model; it's a fairytale romance. Carter says be careful Cinderella; it might just be that she is the stepsister trying to cram her foot in Caroline's shoe. Rick tells his dad that he can't fire him over this with Caroline. Eric says but he can for not doing what is best for this company. A couple of kisses for Caroline and now Rick wants to move Maya into his mother's house! He should drop to his knees and be thankful that Caroline still wants to be married to him. She apologized for what she has done but what Rick has done is much worse. So he better honor his commitment to her or he will fire him. Caroline is a big part of this company and he won't be surprised if she is head designer one of these days. Shaking his finger again and in his face Eric tells Rick that he promised him that he would run this company fairly from the inside and he would not let his feelings for Caroline and Ridge get in the way and clearly that is not what happened. Rick's eyes tear up when Eric tells him that he is so disappointed in him. Rick says Eric still does not understand what this did to him ..Ridge of all people. Eric says he knows this was hard for him but be a man. He knows he was hurt but if he keeps making decisions like this he can not depend on him to run this company. Now go reunite with Caroline and show him what kind of man he is, disciplined and dedicated. Show him that he can bounce back stronger than before because if he doesn't, then he is done. Ridge catches up with Caroline on the Sky Lounge. He tells her running away is not going to make Bill a better man or change the way Rick feels right now. He tells her she is sort of freaking out and that isn't going to help either. Running away is not the answer; just stay here and work through it. He holds her and says he wouldn't be here now if it weren't for her. Rick throws it to his father that being CEO he has not spent entirely in marital bliss. He points out his mother and Donna and all the other flirtations in between for Eric. He wasn't sipping martinis with Stephanie all these years. He remembers it differently. Now he's trying to hold Rick up to standards that he could not live up to himself. Eric tells him that is exactly what he is doing. Marriage can be hard and things happen. That is what this has been with Caroline making a mistake. But Caroline loves him, that he knows. And he admits he did not have a real good appreciation of Stephanie until the end. He does not want Rick to wait that long. Do this now; man up and get it done. Rick says this is different and starts to speak, but Eric hushes him and then walks out. Rick finds Caroline with Ridge and says he needs to talk to her about \"us\". She says there is no us, he has made that painfully clear. There is just Maya now. Rick asks Ridge to give them a moment. Caroline grabs his arm and says Ridge is not going anywhere. Rick says that is fine. He will say it in front of everyone. He braces himself and admits to Caroline that he made a mistake. He over- reacted. He was filled with hurt and jealousy. He does not want to lose their marriage. That would be like losing everything he cares about in life. He says he needs her and he needs her to forgive him.",
