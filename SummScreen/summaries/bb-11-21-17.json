    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's, Liam asked Steffy if she was going to work, and Steffy said she planned to remain home with him. Liam appreciated her, and said he had been staring at her from another room and realized how close he had been to losing her. \"I don't know how I missed it,\" he said. He said he had almost lost \"something so precious.\" He called Steffy a wonderful woman. Steffy asked Liam to stop. She wanted to put it all behind them. \"I'm not that wonderful,\" she said.\n\n\nLiam wished he had listened to Steffy earlier and understood how important loyalty was to his family and being able to trust each other. Liam said he knew that his dad would never betray him the way he had betrayed his dad. Steffy looked sad. Liam said he had been confused and had lost his bearings. He lamented that he had even blackmailed his own father. Steffy reminded him it was all in the past.\n\n\nLiam said he and Steffy had made new vows and were moving forward. He wanted to do the same with his dad and rebuild his relationship. He was headed to see Bill and wanted her to accompany him. Steffy was uncomfortable and said her presence would just complicate things, but Liam insisted. He reminded Steffy that everything good that happened had been because of Steffy. She looked away.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill flashed back to making love to Steffy and remembered her recent visit in which she had warned him that she would not lose her marriage over their tryst. She had advised Bill not to \"breathe one word to Liam or anyone.\" Justin entered and wondered why Bill had not left for his trip. \"What happened?\" Justin asked. Bill was short with him. \"What I thought was happening isn't,\" Bill said. Bill added that he had done some things that were unforgivable. Justin wondered if Bill felt guilty about Spectra or about being at odds with Liam.\n\n\nBill again flashed back to making love with Steffy. Bill said he had ignored what people had told him and built an empire and hit his own son, then nearly killed him in an explosion. \"I've done terrible things. What father would do that to his own son? I don't deserve Liam's respect or his love,\" Bill said.\n\n\nJustin said Bill needed a night out, and Justin encouraged Bill to remember that his skyscraper would be going up soon. He reminded Bill that the model in his office would be a huge steel, concrete, and mirrored glass building. \"You will be able to see yourself everywhere,\" Justin said. Bill didn't want to look at himself. He shouted at Justin to make sure the trip was canceled. Justin left, and Bill gulped his glass of scotch.\n\n\nLiam entered, and Steffy followed him. Bill greeted them, and Steffy said Liam wanted to talk to Bill and wanted her there, as well. \"I know I said I'd never come back here,\" Liam started. He explained that he had planned to cut all ties with Bill and with Spencer, but he admitted he had been wrong \"a lot lately.\"\n\n\n\"I'd like to come back and work with you again if you'll have me,\" Liam said. Liam admitted that he had handled the situation badly and had been unwilling to listen. Liam apologized and said he had betrayed Bill. \"I'm sorry. Would you forgive me?\" Liam asked. Steffy was tearful, and Bill looked shocked.\n\n\nBill was surprised that Liam wanted his forgiveness. Steffy said no one had been blameless. They had all made mistakes. Liam promised to make his wife and father a priority. Bill got up to hug Liam, and Liam joked that Bill had given him an impressive shiner. Liam added that he knew Bill had never intended to hurt him when he'd demolished the Spectra building. \"I guess what I'm trying to say is I love you, dad,\" Liam said. Bill said he loved Liam. They embraced, and Bill glanced at Steffy.\n\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Rick and Maya were kissing, and they discussed how they wished they had mistletoe. Eric entered and said it wasn't even Thanksgiving yet. Eric and Quinn noted that Quinn was giving up her kitchen to Pam and Charlie, and she wasn't happy, but Eric reminded her that it was only one day, and it was all for family.\n\n\nPam and Charlie entered the house and argued about serving sizes the previous year. They greeted Eric, Quinn, Rick, and Maya, who all offered to help, but Pam and Charlie maintained that they had it under control. The group discussed that Zende would not return for Thanksgiving, but Nicole would. Maya was looking forward to seeing her sister.\n\n\nPam pointed out that the seating chart would be the most important part of the day, and Quinn said Steffy usually handled that, but Steffy had not returned Quinn's calls. Eric assured everyone that Steffy would handle it. Pam didn't know if anyone could pull off a miracle of everyone getting along for the meal.\n\n\nEric disagreed and said that Thanksgiving had always been a magical time of unity in the Forrester home. Quinn said that friends and family would always be welcome, but Sheila Carter would not be welcome. They didn't think she would try to crash the holiday.\n\n\nPam and Charlie sat down and planned how long it would take to do everything, and they agreed they needed to start immediately. Quinn told them they could start in the morning at 9:00, but Pam tried to negotiate an earlier start time. Quinn held firm at 9:00 a.m.\n\n\nLater, when Eric and Quinn were alone, they worried about finding Steffy's jewelry in the guesthouse. They hoped everything had been all right with Liam and Steffy. Quinn smiled and said she knew how much Eric loved having family in the house. Eric agreed, but he said he cherished his time alone with her. Quinn was grateful and proud to be Eric's wife, and she knew that it was an honor for her to have her portrait hanging above the fireplace. They kissed.\n\n\n",
