He told her he had no choice and couldn't ignore the fact that Stephanie had tried to kill his mother. Eric decided to sell Forrester, since saving Stephanie was more important than keeping the company. While Eric was signing Forrester over to Nick, the family sadly watched. He told Nick that he would never be able to run it successfully without the Forresters. The rest of the family had to sign the document as well.\n\n\nFelicia slapped Nick and told him he was not the man she'd thought he was. Thorne agreed with his sister. Ridge warned Nick that he would live to regret that day. Nick gave them 48 hours to clean out their desks and leave the building. Eric told Nick he would run the company into the ground and end up with nothing. After they left, Brooke glared at Nick and told him he was not the man she had fallen in love with, and she was going to sell her stock because she didn't want to work with him.\n\n\nNick thought Brooke was overreacting, but she told him she was heartbroken and couldn't believe he'd had to pull the family into it. He told her everything could have been different with their marriage if she could have left the family out of it. Before she left, she told him they were over, and she didn't want him around her children anymore because she didn't want them exposed to his hostility.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Bridget was surprised to find that Shane was her patient. After she dressed his wounds, she told him she would like to run a few more tests. Shane wanted Bridget to tell Phoebe he would never hurt her and that he was happy that Taylor had gotten released. He told Bridget that Phoebe was an angel and the best thing that had ever happened to him.\n\n\nAt Massimo's, Jackie told Stephanie her bullying techniques had cost her family their company. Stephanie retorted that she felt no guilt for any of her actions. Stephanie became irate when Jackie accused her again of deliberately pushing her. Before things got out of hand, Donna burst in and told Stephanie not to touch Jackie. Jackie was glad to see Donna and said if it weren't for her, Stephanie might have gotten away with it. Stephanie thought Donna was just trying to get back at her. Before Stephanie left, she told them that Nick would never get her company.\n\n\nIn Eric's office, Ridge reassured Eric that they were Forrester Creations, and they hugged. Brooke walked in and told them that she'd sold her shares to Nick. Eric thanked her and gave her a hug. She smiled at Ridge while they were hugging. After Brooke and Ridge left, Stephanie walked in and was horrified to learn that Eric had sold the company. He explained that he had done it to protect her, and the children agreed. Stephanie thought it was the stupidest thing he had ever done, and she was furious with him for being such an idiot.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Ridge's office, Brooke consoled Ridge and told him they could start another company. She felt something wonderful had resulted from the day because she'd finally realized she was a Forrester. As she moved closer to Ridge, she told him he was unforgettable, and she wanted to spend her life with him. Ridge was ecstatic, and they shared a passionate kiss.\n\n\nBack at Massimo's, when Nick got home, Donna told him that Stephanie had stopped by. He told her that he owned Forrester Creations. Donna thought it was great and couldn't believe that Brooke was siding with the Forresters. For Nick, it was a bittersweet victory, since it had cost him Brooke's love.\n\n\n",

Shane shocks Bridget by ending up at the hospital needing some medical help. She's scared but attends to his needs. He begs her to tell Phoebe that he's glad her mom got acquitted, and he would never hurt her. She's the best thing that has ever happened to him.
