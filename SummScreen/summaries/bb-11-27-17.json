Brooke asked if Ridge had put Eric up to it. Ridge hadn't, but he said he'd gladly spend his remaining days with her.\n\n\nJust then, Brooke gasped upon seeing Thorne enter the house. She rushed to greet him and said she couldn't believe he was there. \"Neither can I. Welcome home, little brother,\" Ridge said.\n\n\nEric was happy to see Thorne. Brooke beamed with joy, noting that Thorne was as handsome as ever. Eric asked why Thorne hadn't let anyone know he'd decided to travel there. Thorne had wanted to surprise them all. Brooke threw her arms around Thorne, happy that he was there.\n\n\nThorne gazed at Quinn's portrait and wondered if she were around. She wasn't there, but Eric was sure she'd be thrilled to see Thorne, just as Eric was. Thorne noted that Eric looked happy, and Eric said Quinn was the gift he'd never expected.\n\n\nBrooke asked Thorne how life in Paris was. Thorne replied that it was Paris and asked what else one could expect. He'd thrown himself into work after Ali had died. Eric, Brooke, and Ridge empathized with Thorne because they missed Ali, too. Thorne had realized that life had to go on, and he'd decided that it was time to move back to Los Angeles.\n\n\nBrooke and Eric erupted in happiness, but Ridge asked if it didn't seem a little sudden. Thorne said he had been deliberating it for a while. His family was in L.A., and he missed them all. He missed the company, and \"this\" was home. Eric was glad to welcome his son back and felt that they could use Thorne at Forrester. \"Right, Ridge?\" Eric asked. Ridge grunted.\n\n\nEric asked if Thorne wanted to move in, but Thorne said Eric and Quinn needed their space. The beaming Brooke asked where Thorne would stay, and Thorne assumed he'd get a room until he could figure it out.  She decided that the important thing was that Thorne was home. Eric hugged Thorne.\n\n\nThorne asked if his arrival had interrupted anything. Ridge replied that Brooke had just been saying that she wanted to spend her life with Ridge. Brooke glared at Ridge. Thorne said he'd heard that Brooke was divorcing Bill and asked if Brooke and Ridge were back on. Speaking in unison, Ridge affirmed it, but Brooke denied it.\n\n\nGlancing at Ridge again, Brooke said she didn't want to rush anything. Thorne thought that was wise, but Ridge asked his brother not to discourage Brooke. Thorne asked what had happened. Brooke replied that unlike Eric and Quinn, Brooke and Bill weren't a perfect match. Ridge interjected that he'd told Brooke that from the start.\n\n\nEric reasoned that the timeframe for the divorce would give Brooke a chance to work things out. \"And find her way home. Our home,\" Ridge added. Brooke said Ridge's name. Ridge said R.J. would be thrilled. Eric remarked that he would be, too. As Thorne observed Brooke and Ridge, Ridge said they'd make things right, the way they should have been from the beginning.\n\n\nAlone with Thorne later, Ridge poured coffee at the coffee table. Thorne said he couldn't help but notice that Ridge wasn't as happy as Eric and Brooke about Thorne's homecoming, and if Ridge had a problem, he should say it. Ridge asked if Thorne would then hop on a plane back to Paris. Thorne said he would not, but he'd know where he stood.\n\n\nBrooke walked up to the chair whose back faced the front door. Ridge said Thorne knew where he stood with family. Ridge had assumed Thorne liked Paris; however, if Thorne wanted to be home, \"you're always welcome here, little brother.\" Thorne asked if they could drop the \"little brother\" thing. Ridge asked if Thorne was kidding. Thorne said he wasn't.\n\n\nSurprised, Ridge said he hadn't meant to offend Thorne and asked when Thorne had become so sensitive. Thorne replied that he wasn't sensitive, but he was a grown man. Thorne felt that they were equals, and Ridge didn't need to call Thorne little anymore. Ridge referred to it as a term of endearment. Thorne felt it was condescending and said that if Ridge had to refer to Thorne as some type of brother, he could try \"half.\"\n\n\n\"Half? Really?\" Ridge asked. Thorne felt that half-brother more accurately described them and said he wasn't the one walking around with Marone DNA. Ridge asked if Thorne would say that to Ridge in the house in which Ridge had been raised. Thorne replied that no one should forget where they'd come from. Ridge told Thorne that it was a bad idea to have a chip on his shoulder and to antagonize Ridge. \"A really bad idea, little brother,\" Ridge concluded.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam found Steffy deep in thought. He said a lot had happened, and he hadn't been able to see a way back from what had happened with Spectra. The disconcerted Steffy claimed to be happy that Bill and Liam had made things right. Liam didn't think he would have done it without his wife, and he believed his father would agree that they were grateful to her.\n\n\nLiam thought he could have avoided a lot of heartache if he had listened to Steffy in the first place. Steffy said he probably wanted to keep that in mind. Liam was sorry for what he'd done and promised that he'd never betray her again.\n\n\nLiam asked Steffy to accompany him on his first day back at Spencer. Steffy thought the three Spencer men should bond together, without her. Liam said he had some things he needed to say to the family and needed her there for support.\n\n\nAt Bill's office, Bill flashed back to having sex with Steffy, professing love for her, and reuniting with Liam. \"Last to know, checking in!\" Wyatt announced as he entered. Bill asked what Wyatt was talking about, and Wyatt asked what was going on with their family. Wyatt wanted to know why no one told him anything and he always had to figure out what was going on.\n\n\nBill claimed that he informed Wyatt of all kinds of things. Disagreeing, Wyatt cited that he hadn't known that things had become hunky-dory between Liam and Bill until Thanksgiving, and Wyatt asked if the Spencers were making a fresh start. Bill replied that it was exactly what it was, and it was what Bill wanted. Bill asked what was with the cross-examination about it.\n\n\nWyatt sensed that there was a piece missing between \"I never want to see you again\" and \"Oh, can you please pass the gravy?\" Bill asked what difference it made, and Wyatt asked why the son who'd never betrayed Bill couldn't get a straight answer. Bill thought Wyatt was making a big deal over nothing, but Wyatt insisted upon knowing.\n\n\nBill relayed that Liam had come to terms with what the obsession with Sally had been costing him, namely his wife. Wyatt stated that Steffy had found a way to forgive Liam, even after he'd betrayed her with the worst possible enemy he could find. Remarking that the couple had even renewed their vows, Wyatt said it showed what kind of woman Steffy was. Bill quietly responded that Steffy was in a class by herself.\n\n\nWyatt found it unbelievable that Liam had spent what he'd believed to be the last moment of his life, making out with Sally Spectra. Bill said it hadn't been Liam's finest hour. Wyatt thought Liam ought to feel lucky that Steffy had taken him back, and Wyatt figured that Steffy walking out had gotten Liam to find his senses.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Bill knew how long Steffy had been gone or where she'd been. Bill flashed to kissing Steffy at the Forrester guesthouse. Wyatt guessed it didn't matter and said nothing would get between the couple again.\n\n\nJust then, Liam arrived. Steffy entered behind him. Bill welcomed Liam back. Wyatt said he was pleasantly surprised to see Steffy, and Liam replied that she'd accompanied him on his first day back. Steffy stated that she didn't have to stay, but Wyatt said they didn't mind having her around all day. She replied that Liam had insisted that she be there.\n\n\nLiam said Steffy had been the one to heal his relationship with his father, and she'd pounded into his head that family was first. He thanked her for not letting him throw it away.\n\n\nWyatt hated to do it, but he felt they needed to turn their attention to the plans to build, which were still on the table. Bill announced that he was fully committed to \"Sky,\" but he was equally committed to helping Spectra rebuild. He said they'd spare no expense.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Bill meant it. Bill believed it was the right thing to do, and Liam said he appreciated Bill extending a hand. Bill planned to see to it that the Spectras were made fully whole and relaunched in a good location. Wyatt asked if Steffy was good with it. \"Yeah. Whatever keeps the peace,\" she replied.\n\n\nBill wanted to get Sally's input on everything. He'd set it up with Alison, and that way, Liam didn't even have to be involved. Liam thanked Bill. Wyatt felt as if he were in a parallel universe and said all the cooperation was taking him by surprise. Liam attributed everything to Steffy.\n\n\nLiam had realized that he'd gone too far in his defense of Sally and her company. He felt there could have been a solution that didn't involve him destroying his own family relationships. Liam felt that he'd betrayed Bill and said it wouldn't happen again. Though Liam wouldn't always agree with Bill, Liam would respect Bill and be loyal, as Bill had always been with Liam. Bill and Steffy seemed to simultaneous flash back to their night together.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke, Ridge and Eric discuss this was the best Thanksgiving yet. Eric says he does not want to put words in their mouths but he would like to see them as happy as he and Quinn are. Surprise \u0096 Thorne walks in. Brooke gives him a hug and Ridge manages a \"welcome home little brother.\" He asks how has Paris been treating him. Eric wants to know why he did not let them know and get here in time for Thanksgiving. Thorne says it was more fun this way. Bill thinks back to Steffy telling him that she and Liam renewed their wedding vows. Wyatt walks in and says he has to know \u0096 now they are all one big happy family! Seems on Thanksgiving he and Liam were all hunky dory again, so he just wants to catch up on the situation. Liam asks Steffy what is on her mind; a penny for her thoughts but he would be selling her short. She says she was happy that he and his father made up. He says yes and he would not have done that except for his tenacious wife. He knows he can speak for his father too that they are both so grateful to her. He says he almost lost everything \u0096 his dad, his job, even Steffy and he is so sorry that he caused so much pain. It is his first day back in the office and he wants her to go with him. It is a big day, a new beginning with more male bonding and she is responsible for that. He asks her to please say she will come. Wyatt says he is the son who has never betrayed Bill so he'd like to get a straight answer. Steffy found a way to forgive Liam as she is like that. Bill agrees that she is in a class by herself. Wyatt says Liam is back now where he belongs. Thorne admires the portrait of Quinn who is not there at the moment but Eric tells him how happy he is with her. Thorne says after Aly died he had to get away; there is an emptiness inside that will never go away but he realizes now that it is time \u0096 time for him to move back to L.A. He misses all of them, his home and his job here in L.A. He tells Brooke that he heard she was divorcing Bill and asks if she and Ridge are back on. Ridge says yes about the same time that Brooke says not really. Ridge says they will make it right the way it should have been in the beginning. Liam walks in and then Steffy, saying she needed to be here on his first day back. Family comes first and there is nothing more important than that and he gets it now thanks to Steffy who never gave up. Bill says he is still committed to Spencer but also Skye too and to getting Sally in a new location. He'd like to sit down with Sally personally and get her thoughts. Liam does not even have to be involved. Liam says he knows he went too far with Sally so he is okay with Bill now taking over. He may not always agree with Bill but he will give him his respect. Thorne tells Ridge that he noticed he was not as enthusiastic about his return as the others, especially the little brother thing that he'd like to be dropped. Ridge says he is coming here with a big chip on his shoulder trying to antagonize him and that won't work. And he will not call Thorne half- brother as they all know he was raised in this same house and where they all came from.",
