    "tvmega_recap": "Bill holds a sprig over Brooke's head in the elevator and pulls her to him and gives her a big passionate kiss. She laughs that is not mistletoe. He says no, it is parsley. It was on his Thanksgiving plate. He tells her that he has everything arranged and all she has to do is show up. He gave her needed space for RJ and Ridge. It is their time now so he needs her to agree to that. Just call Ridge and tell him this time tomorrow she will be a Spencer. Ridge calls and says he needs her. He and RJ high-five. Bill says it is almost like Ridge read his mind. Zende thanks Nicole for meeting him. He was not sure she would. She asks curtly what he wants. He pulls out the ring again and says he knows he made mistakes but they both did and he'd like to move on with his life and with her.
