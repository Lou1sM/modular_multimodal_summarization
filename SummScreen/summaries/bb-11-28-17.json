Liam gave her all the credit for preserving the family.\n\n\nSteffy argued that it was Liam who had rebuilt his relationship with Bill. She reminded Liam that they had renewed their vows and started fresh with a blank slate. \"That's exactly what we're gonna do -- all of us,\" she said. Bill looked slyly at Steffy.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt and Liam were alone, and Liam argued that some of the plans Bill had made for the skyscraper had to be changed because Liam refused to back down on some of the environmental issues.\n\n\nWyatt was curious what was going on. Liam didn't understand what Wyatt meant. Wyatt explained that Bill and Liam had basically gone from blackmail and working against each other to a truce. Liam insisted that Wyatt should be grateful that he and his dad had finally worked everything out.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that their dad was letting things go for the first time ever. Liam agreed that Bill had finally put bad choices and the past behind them. Wyatt thought something was up. He added that he felt something was going on, and even Liam was unaware of what it was. Wyatt was convinced there was more to the truce.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, when they were alone, Bill told Steffy he was glad she had joined them for Liam's return to work. Bill was worried that Steffy had been upset. He didn't want things to be difficult for her. Steffy cried that their night together should never have happened. \"What can I do?\" Bill asked. Steffy said she could do nothing to erase the night that she had betrayed her husband and her vows.\n\n\nBill said they had both let Liam down. \"How could I do that to my boy?\" Bill asked.

She hated keeping the secret. Bill told her that night had reawakened feelings, and he had wanted to start a life together with Steffy.

Steffy looked conflicted.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, she welcomed Thorne back to the company and to Los Angeles. He complimented her on her new shorter haircut, and she said he was welcome to stay with her for as long as he needed to. She was concerned that Ridge and Thorne were at odds.\n\n\nThorne admitted that Ridge had rubbed him the wrong way. Ridge's comments about being the \"little brother\" were not so funny anymore. Brooke insisted it was a term of endearment, but Thorne shook his head. He attributed their differences to Ridge being in charge of the company. He understood that Ridge was charming to Brooke, and Brooke said they were both good-looking men with a lot of charm.\n\n\nThorne wondered why Brooke and Ridge had not married.

Quinn asked if Thorne was dating anyone. Ridge seemed irritated to discuss his brother, and Quinn noticed. She wondered if Thorne was as competitive as Ridge was. Quinn wondered if Ridge was worried that Thorne would take his job. Ridge maintained he was not worried about his little brother.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Sheila waited on Pam and scared her. \"I thought you left Los Angeles,\" Pam said. Sheila answered that she couldn't afford to lose her job. Pam hoped that Sheila had no plans to bother Eric. Sheila promised to stay away from Eric, but she admitted that she had no faith that Quinn would be a loyal wife.\n\n\nAfter lunch, Pam said she was in a hurry to visit Stephanie's grave, and Sheila felt it was sad that Pam was doing that alone. Sheila offered to accompany her and become her friend. Pam declined, but Sheila reminded her that she had heard all about Pam's reputation as the crazy sister. Sheila reminded Pam what she had done to Donna, and Pam flashed back to the incident where Pam had covered Donna in honey and lured a bear to the cabin.\n\n\nPam didn't want to discuss it, but Sheila promised not to judge because she had been called Crazy Sheila for years. Sheila again offered to be friends and have dinner or coffee with Pam, but she didn't want to interfere with Charlie.
