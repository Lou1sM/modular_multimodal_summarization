Stephanie just had to tell Eric that she wasn't happy that he sold Forrester out from under her, even though he had the best of intentions.  She told him that she honestly believed that she could win if they had gone to court.  Stephanie thought that Eric had caved in rather than putting up a fight.  Speaking before she thought again and once again hurting him, Eric stormed out the door in a huff.  Receiving a phone call from Ridge, who wanted his father to stop over to plan their strategy for the future, was not well received by an irate Eric, who just wanted to get away because Stephanie was driving him crazy, once again.\n\n\nAfter Eric left Taylor entered trying to help her friend.  Stephanie wanted to talk about saving her marriage but Taylor kept asking her questions about her childhood.  Stephanie told Taylor that she is afraid of her marriage ending and Taylor commented that it was a very good possibility if she didn't do something about it.  It was then that Stephanie sought Taylor's professional help, once again.  Upon returning to Taylor's office, the therapist took over and asked Stephanie to explain her feelings and Stephanie did so by using \"rage\" and \"anger.\"  She was then surprised at what she said about her past, remembering it as a normal one.  Her father ruled the home, he was the law and everything was black or white, no in between.  One either did and said the right thing or it was conceived as wrong and you knew when that happened.  Taylor wanted to know if Stephanie always obeyed her father.  She told Taylor about her younger sister, Pamela, who was the \"girly girl\" of the family and Stephanie described herself as her father's daughter.  She had been taught how to shoot pool, go fishing and so on.  Taylor then asked Stephanie about her mother but Stephanie shied away from revealing anything about her.  Stephanie told Taylor that her father was always very strict, as she remembered an incident where she once ripped the pool cloth on the pool table by mistake.  Her punishment was a beating with the belt that her father was wearing.  Coming back to the present, Stephanie wondered how a parent could hit their own child.\n\n\nRidge and Brooke cuddled and kissed, still in the throes of bliss at their reunion with each other.\n\n\nEric turned up at Jackie's home.  He told her how angry Stephanie was with him for selling the company.  Jackie remained aloof but sympathetic to Eric because of what he has had to put up with from Stephanie in the past.  Eric told Jackie that Stephanie is still being eaten alive by her anger and rage that she may never get over it until she seeks professional help.  He told Jackie that Stephanie was seeing Taylor professionally.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Stephanie and Eric take a leisurely moment at home with no more business to look after. She just wishes Eric would have taken Nick's bluff as she thinks a jury would have let her off as it being an accident. She knows his heart was in the right place, but he should have fought \u0096 it wasn't just a business, but their lives. They are fighting when Taylor walks in and Eric walks out. He goes directly to Jackie and unloads his anger about Stephanie on her. Stephanie follows Taylor to her office and Taylor wants to treat her professionally, not girlfriend talk. Taylor reminds her that people aren't born angry, so where does her rage come from? Did she feel she had ever done anything wrong as a little girl growing up? Ridge and Ridge languish in bed all day, she hasn't lost her touch. Reluctantly Stephanie shares childhood memories of her father; Pammy was the girlie-girl, Stephanie was her father' daughter, more of a tomboy. Her father's home was his castle. But, she rankles when Taylor wants to hear about her mother. Taylor digs further and Stephanie flinches when she remembers a really stupid little accident where she broke the fabric of the pool table and her father hit her. She was devastated then, and even now. How could a father do that to a little child?",
