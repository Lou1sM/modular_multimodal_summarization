    "tvmega_recap": "Liam and Steffy discuss Thanksgiving and how she can not wait until next year to get married, so get out that calendar and figure it out. She tells him that Thomas made his move but Ivy got away, so Wyatt has nothing to worry about. Liam says Ivy is committed to Ivy, so no harm. Steffy says she wonders if Thomas is being straight with her as she saw them, just a glimpse on Thanksgiving and there was a moment. Wyatt tells Ivy that she has been busy all morning and he thinks she needs to get recharged. He kisses her but she thinks of the one with Thomas, though she tells Wyatt this is exactly what she needs. Thomas walks in and sounds like he wants Wyatt to go out of town again, but Wyatt tells him if he does this time Ivy will go with him. Thomas touches on the night that Ivy spend the night in the Forrester house ..and how she came downstairs because of something she wanted.....something hot. Carter tells Thomas that he attracts women like a magnet but he is not even trying to connect with one. He must be interested in one that is not jealous. Steffy fills Liam in more, that she saw Thomas put his hand on Ivy's knee. She pulled away but it was almost like they did not want anyone else to see them. Liam says she has not liked Ivy in the past so this may be coloring her perspective. Wyatt has to leave to find Ivy's tablet and she dives into Thomas about trying to catch her in some game. He assures her this is no game. He wants more than just a few minutes with her. He wants to see where this goes. She tells him that night did not go that far and should have never happened. He says okay she can settle for Wyatt although he does not satisfy her. He knows she is attracted to him. She says he does not listen to her when she tells him she is committed to Wyatt. He says she is a gorgeous, exquisite women so he does not know why she is with someone like Wyatt. She says she loves him and what they have is incredible and she does not want to jeopardize that. Wyatt finds Ivy's tablet but Steffy suggests that he not look at it, she might have something private besides work in there. He says they have no secrets so that would not matter. Steffy starts to find Ivy and she overhears at the door that is ajar when Ivy says that night should never have happened and it will never happen again. Wyatt tells Liam that they are both acting real weird. Liam says it is not them, but Thomas. Wyatt says he knows. He can not stand to be around the guy. His last name suggests he can do whatever he wants, but Thomas can make a fool of himself as he is not going to be a Neanderthal man over this. Ivy comes in and Wyatt says he is not worried about Thomas. He trusts Ivy. She says she has felt in the middle but as far as Thomas is concerned she has made herself very clear and he is not going to be an issue. Steffy barges in and wants to talk to Thomas alone. She wants to hear it again that he spent the night with Ivy alone although he says nothing happened. She thinks he lied to her as she just overheard that Ivy is feeling guilty. She wants to know what he did that night. She wants to know or she will tell Wyatt. She is supposed to be with Wyatt and not cheating on him with Thomas. Ivy betrayed him and Wyatt needs to know.",
