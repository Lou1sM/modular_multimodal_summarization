Stating that it was no biggie, Sally said she intended to drop in on Liam to see how he was doing for herself. Liam didn't know that Sally would be there, but Sally said she'd make sure she didn't run into Steffy. Sally understood that the couple was moving on, and Sally didn't want to do anything to upset it.\n\n\nCoco asked about Sally. Sally flashed back to kissing Liam. She claimed she didn't want to create problems for Liam; she just wanted to speak to him. Coco concluded that Sally had really fallen for Liam.\n\n\nLater, Darlita arrived and asked where Sally was. Coco conveyed that her sister had gone to Liam's. Darlita asked why, and Coco said the two were friends. \"And possibly more?\" Darlita asked. Coco asked what made Darlita say that. Darlita claimed not to be as dim as people thought. Darlita could tell when a girl pretended not to like a guy in order to avoid trouble. \"Then she gets trapped in an explosion with that guy, and something happens,\" Darlita added.\n\n\nCoco asked if Darlita had put it together herself. Darlita said she and the women in her family were intuitive. They also read a lot of romance novels. Darlita suspected Sally had bared her soul to Liam while trapped in the rubble, but Darlita didn't think Liam would cross a line. Coco shifted nervously. \"Oh, my God, are you saying he and Sally did cross a line?\" Darlita asked.\n\n\nCoco hesitantly revealed that, thinking they'd die, Sally and Liam had shared a few kisses. Darlita giggled in delight, and Coco made her promise not to tell anyone. Darlita agreed to it. To her, it was romantic and scary at the same time. Coco said her sister had a lot to work through.\n\n\nDarlita was surprised when Coco said that Steffy knew about it all. Coco said Steffy had forgiven Liam and renewed their wedding vows. Darlita asked where that left Sally.\n\n\nIn the dining area at the cliff house, Liam felt blessed that he'd awakened to another day with his amazing wife. The reticent Steffy asked that he not put her on a pedestal because she wasn't perfect. They joked about their imperfections, and Steffy wished she hadn't walked out on Liam that night. She was glad that they'd renewed their vows, and she was happy to be Mrs. Liam Spencer. Steffy hugged him, but she wasn't smiling.\n\n\nOver breakfast, Steffy showed Liam some remote places for getaways. He was all for it, but he noted that the holidays were near. Because the family had reconciled, Liam looked forward to spending time with Bill. Liam asked if Steffy did, too. Agreeing, Steffy said they'd talk about it another time then.\n\n\nSteffy assumed Liam was going to work. He said he was working from home and would love it if she did, too. Steffy claimed to have a meeting to attend. She flashed to kissing Bill by the guesthouse window. Snapping out of it, she picked up her bags. Liam noticed that she was jittery, but she said it was just a chill. She seemed rattled, and he hugged her.\n\n\nLater, Liam was alone when Sally arrived. She'd called Spencer, and they'd told her that he was working from home. She admired the house and was awestruck by the view she saw through the window by the dining table. She said Steffy and Liam had seemed happy at Thanksgiving dinner. Agreeing, Liam said Steffy's understanding was surreal. Sally replied that Steffy loved him. He said he'd betrayed that love, but Steffy had thankfully forgiven him.\n\n\nOver coffee, Sally gave Steffy props for her Thanksgiving Day behavior. Sally was sure Steffy hadn't known Sally would be there beforehand because Steffy never would have allowed Sally to be invited. Liam said Sally had really expected Steffy to give it to her. Sally quipped that she'd expected Steffy to shove Sally's face into one of the dishes.\n\n\nSally hadn't let her guard down yet, and she expected to have something coming to her after what she'd done. Liam corrected that it was what \"we\" had done. Sally was sure Steffy understood that it had been more Sally, which was why Steffy had rebounded so quickly. Liam said Steffy had found peace practically overnight, and it had allowed them to renew their vows.\n\n\nSally said the couple could begin a new and exciting chapter in their lives. Hesitantly, Liam agreed. He said it was just that Steffy had left home as one woman and returned as another. Liam had feared that Steffy had left him for good. Sally replied that Steffy wouldn't do that -- no one would -- and Sally certainly wouldn't.\n\n\nLiam stared at Sally, and she apologized. She didn't want to make him uncomfortable. She felt she had to be honest and tell him that she couldn't stop thinking of what had happened between them. Sally recognized that he was where he belonged, and she was lucky to have help getting Spectra back together. \"Not as lucky as Steffy,\" Sally added. Sally claimed to be happy that Liam was happy and that he had a loyal, faithful wife in Steffy.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Bill was preoccupied with thoughts of what had happened with Steffy and the secret that he and Steffy had vowed to keep.\n\n\nLater, Steffy arrived in a huff. Slamming down her things, she cried that she couldn't keep the secret. Bill told her that she could. Steffy said it was wrong, and she wasn't being honest with her husband. Bill started saying, \"Normally, I would agree, but considering the circumstances -- \"\n\n\nCutting Bill off, Steffy said she'd overreacted that night, and Liam had been honest about him and Sally. Bill stated that it had been a few kisses, but his and Steffy's situation was totally different. Steffy couldn't take it that she had to lie to Liam over and over and over. It would haunt her for the rest of her life. Bill said it would be even worse if confessing cost her marriage. He asked if she was willing to take the risk.\n\n\nSteffy asked if she was supposed to pretend everything was wonderful with her husband. Bill replied that it could be if she'd just let it go. Steffy assumed she was supposed to keep lying to her husband. Bill considered the action to be protecting Liam and the family. Bill didn't want to lose his son. Steffy asked why they hadn't thought of others before they'd done what they'd done and why they hadn't stopped themselves.\n\n\nBill said he and Steffy hadn't set out to betray Liam. Bill had thought Steffy had left Liam, and Liam had given her good reason to go. Bill reminded her that Liam had shared a connection and kisses with a woman Steffy loathed. It had been a connection that Liam probably hadn't been ready to own up to until that precarious moment in the rubble.\n\n\nSteffy insisted that nothing excused what she and Bill had done. It had been a horrible lapse in judgment. Bill asked if she realized she'd be compounding it by telling Liam what had happened. Steffy replied that she needed to give Liam the same honesty and integrity that he had given to her. Bill quipped that she wouldn't have a marriage if she told Liam. Bill believed Liam would leave her, and she'd lose him forever. Bill asked if that was what Steffy wanted.\n\n\nBill warned Steffy not to open it up when they'd all started to heal. Bill asserted that Liam wouldn't care that Bill and Steffy had thought the marriage had ended; Liam would feel betrayed. Steffy replied that Liam had been betrayed. Bill stated that they hadn't intended to do it, and it hadn't been tawdry or dirty. Bill added that it hadn't been an accident, either.\n\n\nBill insisted that he and Steffy had made love, and they both had felt that way about it. Steffy urged Bill to stop, but he said he couldn't. Grasping her arms, he said he couldn't lock the feelings away again. He'd told her that he'd wanted to spend his life with her years back, and he'd said it again that night. Bill couldn't pretend that they weren't made for each other.\n\n\nBill said he and Steffy had always been connected, and he couldn't deny what he knew. \"You and I are meant to be,\" Bill told Steffy.\n\n\n",
