Nick decided to go back to the Shady Marlin to get some of his belongings, so he could move back into the beach house with Bridget.\n\n\nIn the basement of Forrester, Eric was showing Brooke the new samples that he had drawn up. She told him that they were the best that he had ever done. Thorne walked in and wanted to talk with Eric.\n\n\nFelicia was waiting for Nick as he went aboard the Shady Marlin. She said, \"Hello, sailor,\" and he turned around, completely surprised. They continued to talk as he told her that he'd tried to email her, but there was never any response. She told him that part of the reason that she'd returned had been to see whether or not the \"sailor\" would be interested in renewing old friendships.\n\n\nThorne talked about somehow reconciling the company as Brooke was focused on a picture of Bridget and Nick. After he and Eric talked, Thorne left, and Eric walked over to Brooke to tell her that he was glad to hear Thorne concerned about the family and company. Eric noticed that Brooke was looking at the picture and commented on the fact that she was still in love with Nick. Brooke told Eric that Nick and Bridget were finally back together. He commented that it was all her doing that had reunited them. Bridget arrived and was happy that both her mother and father were together. She told them both about her and Nick and the fact that she was having a daughter.\n\n\nFelicia told Nick that she'd been living in a farmhouse, with no telephone or computers. She'd become a very different person while she'd been away. The other reason that she was back was because Taylor had written to her with a job position. Felicia took Nick's hand and noticed that he was wearing a wedding band. He told her that he was married.\n\n\nEric told Bridget how wonderful it was that another baby girl would be arriving soon. She mentioned that \"the baby is technically a Marone.\" Eric called it a minor technical thing and relished the thought of a new addition to the family.\n\n\nFelicia commented that Brooke had finally gotten what she wanted. Nick interrupted her and told her that he hadn't married Brooke; he'd married Bridget. He told Felicia that it seemed that both she and he had moved on with their lives. Felicia was shocked, to say the least. He told her that he'd just gone to the boat to get some of his things to take to the beach house.\n\n\nFelicia commented that Bridget had even turned Nick into a land lover. Nick told her that he and Bridget were going to have a baby girl. She commented, \"That sucks, Marone!\" Commenting later, she clarified that she'd simply meant that he and Bridget would not have much time together before they had the baby.\n\n\nBridget told her mom that she was happy that Brooke was going to be the grandmother of her little girl. She knew that even if her mother had done things in the past, and walked down strange paths, that she had done it out of love.\n\n\nFelicia told Nick not to tell anyone she had been there. He told her that the boat would be empty if she wanted to stay there, but she told him that it held too many memories. Nick's phone rang, and when he went to answer it, Felicia tried to slip out the door, only to drop her purse, which spilled out the things inside of it, including a baby pacifier.\n\n\n",

Bridget thanks her mother for always being there for her. Nick is surprised to find Felicia waiting for him onboard the Shady Marlin and welcomes her back to Los Angeles. She wants to pick up where they left off, but he tells her that he is now married to her half-sister, Bridget.
