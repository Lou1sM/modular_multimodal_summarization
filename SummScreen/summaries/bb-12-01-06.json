Stephanie cut her out of her life thirty years ago and wants nothing to do with her. Nick lines up his staff and about half are loyal and will stay, the others bolt. Clarke is eager to come aboard and get this new opportunity in the inner sanctum. Jackie and Donna are also at his side ushering in a new era. Ridge and Thorne say Nick may have won the battle, but not the war. Eric tells the boys he is not throwing in the towel. He knows they have other lucrative offers and he won't influence their decision. They vow to rally around and stay with him, designing only a few quality pieces a year, quality, not quantity. Through more probing, Taylor finds out Pam did not cut her mother out of her life and she lives with her mother in Chicago. She advises Stephanie to confront her now if she wants to save her marriage. This is the root of all of it, the control. Stephanie balks, but finally makes the phone call when Taylor tells her she is lucky her mother is still alive. She wouldn't wait too long. It's short and sweet and she quickly ascertains that all is alright. Pam tells her mother that Stephanie called and even asked about her. Immediately Stephanie has regrets and tells Taylor this was a big mistake. But Taylor stands by her claims that she needs to confront her, get out of denial and the \"time has come.\"",
