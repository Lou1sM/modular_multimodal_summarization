He said he'd thought she'd needed the meal after their previous night, but she'd spoiled the fun of having the meal in bed. Quinn said it was nice. She hadn't imagined sharing her life with anyone after Wyatt had moved out. Deacon replied that they'd be a family from then on out.\n\n\n\"Not if your daughter has anything to say about it,\" Quinn griped. She complained about Hope not letting her see Wyatt on Thanksgiving. Deacon stated that Quinn had tried to crash the dinner, but she quipped that she should have been invited. He told her that she might be the next time if she stopped pushing, but she complained that Hope hadn't even let her drop off yams.\n\n\nQuinn brooded about Hope not telling Wyatt she had been there. Instead, Hope had been in the living room with Liam, admiring the new sword necklace. Quinn huffed that Ivy had made it to replace the old one. She asked how many family holidays she was supposed to miss while waiting on Hope.\n\n\nThe chuckling Deacon kissed Quinn's palm. She snatched it back, insisting that she was angry. He replied that she wasn't angry at him. \"Well, no -- not yet,\" she retorted. Quinn asserted that Hope didn't get to choose her family, but since she'd chosen Wyatt, Quinn was part of the deal. Deacon stated that, if it made Quinn feel better, Hope wasn't fond of Bill, either.\n\n\nDeacon received a call from Pam, who informed him of Hope's baby shower that day. He said it wasn't his thing, but he'd be there for Hope. Pam explained that it was only for women, and he asked why she'd called. \"You have a habit of showing up unannounced. I'd rather you didn't,\" Pam responded.\n\n\nAfter the call, Quinn asked if Hope was having a baby shower that afternoon. \"Don't even think about it!\" Deacon exclaimed, reminding her that she hadn't been invited. Snarling, Quinn asked if he really thought she'd subject herself to an afternoon of lemon bars and stupid party games.\n\n\nQuinn slammed her fork down and stormed into the bedroom. Deacon shook his head. In the bedroom, Quinn pulled out clothes, murmuring about what to wear to the baby shower.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Hope, Ivy, Pam, and Aly discussed how nice the speech game had been at Thanksgiving. Aly and Pam decided that they should have a game like that at Hope's baby shower. Eric interrupted to say how well Ivy and Hope had done in Amsterdam. Touching her stomach, Hope said that her modeling days were over, and the focus should be on Ivy's jewelry.\n\n\nAly figured Hope could have all the attention at the baby shower. Eric was excited about entertaining at the house. To him, it would be like old times when, some weeks, he and Stephanie had entertained almost every night. Pam told him that the party would be for women only.\n\n\nAs the ladies exited, Eric asked Hope to remain behind. He complimented her on how she'd handled herself with Ivy on the trip and hadn't let personal issues get in the way. He added that Rick had let personal issues cloud his judgment. Hope admitted that she didn't know how well she'd handled herself in Amsterdam. Seeing Liam and Ivy together had been difficult for Hope.\n\n\nHope explained that she and Ivy had done their best not to let it affect things. Hope understood that she was married, and she was head-over-heels in love with her baby. It was hard for her because, even though she and Wyatt couldn't wait to be parents, she'd been making the same plans with Liam a short time back. In Hope's view, Quinn had intervened and ruined everything.\n\n\n\"And it still just feels very unfair,\" Hope added. Eric guessed that Hope felt manipulated, and if Quinn hadn't interfered, Hope would still be with Liam. Hope stated that she was still trying to get past it. Eric asserted that she could, and she would, because she was a strong girl. Nodding, Hope replied that she wanted to be, and he thanked her for being honest with him.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Aly and Ivy helped Pam make a diaper cake, and the talk turned to the Amsterdam photo shoot. Ivy said she'd never been so nervous in her entire life, but Liam had helped her relax. Pam guessed that it was a good thing Ivy had invited him.\n\n\nPam left Ivy and Aly to finish the diaper cake. Ivy hoped that Hope felt Ivy's support. Ivy believed that Hope would be an amazing mother. Aly added that, with any luck, Ivy would be an amazing aunt.\n\n\nIvy flashed back to her and Liam expressing love for each other on the boat. Aly said it was good to see Ivy happy. Ivy felt foolish for smiling all the time, but Aly explained that Ivy was in love.\n\n\nIvy still couldn't believe the words had fallen from her lips. Aly believed that Ivy and Liam had been swept up in the moment. Ivy expressed that it had been everything one would want the moment to be, and she was on the most incredible ride of her life.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam looked at Hope's Amsterdam photo. His face dimmed as he recalled their sullen moments on the bridge. When he moved on to Ivy's photo, he grinned, remembering the boat ride. Wyatt entered the house to talk about the camaraderie at Thanksgiving the other day. They'd been like one big, happy family, and Wyatt asked if Liam and Ivy could continue after the baby was born.\n\n\nLiam couldn't believe Wyatt had driven out there to find out about his relationship with Ivy. Liam asked if Wyatt was supposed to be at a baby shower. Wyatt replied that it was ladies only and wondered if Liam had gotten the proofs. Liam excitedly relayed that he had, and Forrester would get a two-page spread. Wyatt believed the Amsterdam shoot deserved the cover.\n\n\nLiam believed that the campaign would be a huge success, and he admitted that the trip had been good. Wyatt nodded knowingly, and Liam asked what the gesture indicated. Wyatt asked if Liam and Ivy had enjoyed themselves after Hope and Wyatt had left.\n\n\nLiam seemed frustrated by Wyatt's persistence. Wyatt had noticed that Ivy had been into Liam, and the feeling had seemed mutual at Thanksgiving. \"Like something might have happened in Amsterdam...like maybe you took my advice. Did you?\" Wyatt asked. Liam called Wyatt subtle.\n\n\nWyatt claimed that Ivy and Liam were good together, and moving on didn't have to be a heavy burden. In Wyatt's view, it was already happening. Liam figured Wyatt thought Liam should just go with the current. Wyatt agreed. He said that Liam and Ivy could have a great life together, just like the one Wyatt and Hope had.\n\n\nLater, Liam was alone when Hope arrived. Liam asked if she should be at her baby shower. Hope was on the way there, but her talk with Eric had made her decide that she should be talking to Liam. Liam assumed it was about the photo proofs, but she said that it was about Amsterdam.\n\n\nLiam remarked that Hope and Wyatt had ended the trip early. Sighing, Hope stated that she'd seen Liam and Ivy on the boat, kissing. She stammered that it had been a fluke, and he said he and Ivy had noticed the hotel. He was sorry he hadn't seen Hope. She indicated that she hadn't expected him to.\n\n\nHope flashed back to witnessing the kiss, and Liam asked if it had been why she'd left. She said the flight over had been awkward enough. He remarked that things had seemed fine at Thanksgiving. Hope agreed, adding that Ivy seemed really happy and upbeat around the office. Grinning, Liam said it had been a good trip, and it had been topped off by a mystery boat ride.\n\n\nLiam remarked that he still didn't know who'd arranged the ride. \"I do,\" Hope bitterly murmured. He asked who it had been. \"Your brother,\" Hope replied. The answer settled over Liam. He smiled mirthlessly, saying that he should have known. Hope spoke as if Wyatt had innocuously been trying to do something good and had figured something would happen in a romantic setting.\n\n\nHope expressed that the ride had looked beautiful, and it wouldn't have been hard to get sucked up in it. Liam replied that Ivy had told him that she loved him. \"Wow,\" Hope responded. She asked what he'd said back. He gestured with his head, and she gleaned that he'd told Ivy the same thing.\n\n\nHope tried to seem cheerful, but her tearful expression revealed her true feelings as she asked why he wouldn't say it back. She said Ivy was a wonderful person and exactly the kind of woman she'd want for him. Ivy had been there for Liam, and the couple had been spending a lot of time together. Hope figured it had been just a matter of time, and she stated that she was happy for him. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Hope makes an emotional confession to Eric about how difficult it was for her to be in Amsterdam with Liam and Ivy. Under the ruse of brotherly bonding, Wyatt pays a visit to Liam to pry him for information about how it went with Ivy during the remainder of their trip. When Quinn learns about Hope\u2019s baby shower, she becomes determined to be a part of the festivities, invited or not.",
    "tvmega_recap": "While Pam, Ivy, & Aly start to discuss Hope's baby shower, Eric interrupts and says Rick has made some questionable things of late but sending Hope and Ivy to Amsterdam to model was a brilliant idea. Later he tells Hope that he appreciated the way she handled Amsterdam with Liam and Ivy. Hope admits it was pretty difficult. She loves her family and she loves her marriage but seeing Liam there was not easy. It wasn't that long ago that she and Liam were making wedding plans. She was manipulated by Quinn but she is trying hard to get past that. He tells her she will as she is a strong girl. He thanks her for being honest with him. Deacon tells Quinn that she ruined his surprise for breakfast in bed. She admits this is kind of good. With Wyatt, she never thought she would be sharing her house with another man. She grouses about not being invited to the Forrester Thanksgiving dinner and being asked to leave. They are treating the grandma worse than a stranger. Deacon warns her again just cool it and play it low key for now. She can not push Hope. She wonders how much time is she to give Hope or how many holidays she will have to miss. Wyatt drops in on Liam to see if all is okay. He hopes they managed to all get along at Thanksgiving. And it's girls only at the baby shower so he and Liam are all alone now. Liam admits it was a good trip to Amsterdam and he had a good time with Ivy after Hope and Wyatt left. Wyatt is not subtle. He says Liam and Ivy are good together. Everybody sees it so if he would relax and let go, they could have a great life together just like he and Hope have. Quinn overhears Deacon talking to Pam on the phone about Hope's baby shower. He knows he is not invited but Pam didn't want him just dropping by unannounced. Quinn's ears perk up. Deacon tells her do not dare; stay away from the shower as she is not invited. Before the baby shower, Hope stops by to see Liam. She admits she looked off her balcony and saw him and Ivy. He admits he got caught up in the moment and probably was insensitive since it was right outside her hotel. She tells him it was Wyatt that arranged that just trying to do something nice. He says Ivy told him she loved him. Hope asks what did he say? His face says it all, and she understands. She says Ivy is a wonderful girl and it was just a matter of time for them to get close and she wants him to be happy.",
