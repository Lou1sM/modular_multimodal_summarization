    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Thomas and Steffy debated whether Ivy had cheated on Wyatt with Thomas. Thomas maintained that they had kissed and made out, nothing more. Steffy insisted that if Ivy had been truly loyal to Wyatt, she would never have kissed Thomas.\n\n\nSteffy couldn't believe that Thomas had been so bold as to go after Ivy. Thomas said that Ivy had been a willing participant. Thomas advised Steffy to quit being so melodramatic. Thomas reminded his sister that he and Ivy had kissed, and it had stopped there. He added that they had done nothing Ivy deserved to be publicly shamed over.\n\n\nSteffy quizzed Thomas about why he had decided to go after Ivy. Steffy guessed that it was all to get back at the Spencers. Thomas agreed that it had been a challenge at first, but he genuinely cared about Ivy. He insisted that Ivy could \"do a hell of a lot better than a Spencer.\"\n\n\nSteffy countered that Wyatt could also do a lot better than Ivy. Thomas argued that Ivy was \"gorgeous, stunning, and different.\" He reminded Steffy that he had not crossed any major lines.\n\n\nSteffy disagreed. She said Ivy was supposed to be loyal to Wyatt, who deserved a loyal girlfriend. Thomas advised his sister to pretend she had seen nothing and let it go. \"I'm sorry. I don't think I can do that,\" she said. She left, and Thomas looked worried.\n\n\nIn another office, Ivy and Wyatt kissed and embraced. Ivy told Wyatt that she had already told Thomas that Wyatt was the only man in her life. Wyatt said he wished he could have seen Thomas' face. Ivy turned away and looked guilty. She said she had to tell him something, but Liam entered and interrupted.\n\n\nWyatt quizzed his brother about whether he and Steffy had made any wedding plans. Liam said they hadn't. Wyatt noted that it had to feel good to know that he and Steffy were finally going to be together \"after all this time.\" Liam said he had known they were meant to be together. Wyatt noted it was good to have a trusting relationship. Ivy looked guilty, and she left the brothers alone.\n\n\nAt the Spencer house, Bill admired Katie while she cooked pasta. \"You look hot,\" he said. She teased that it was because she was barefoot, in the kitchen, and ready to serve him. They both laughed, and Bill kissed her. He said that they were lucky. He was grateful for all they had. He wanted the same for his grown sons. Katie noted that Liam and Steffy were engaged, but she wasn't sure Steffy would give Liam much stability.\n\n\nBill wondered if Wyatt and Ivy were headed toward marriage as well -- \"a double wedding,\" Bill said. Bill was amorous. \"Just kiss me like you mean it,\" he said. Katie remarked that Bill was happy because he had just closed a big deal. He agreed, and after they ate pasta, Bill and Katie made out and removed their clothes. A shirtless Bill laid a half-naked Katie on the kitchen island and kissed her passionately.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt and Ivy made out in another office. Wyatt remarked that Ivy had brightened his life, warmed the cold spots, and provided charm and fun to everything. He was glad they had met and had become best friends first. Wyatt preached that they had learned to trust each other right off the bat. Ivy looked guilty. \"I want to deserve that. I will. I promise,\" she said.\n\n\nIvy told Wyatt how much she appreciated him and didn't want to lose him. They kissed some more. Thomas entered and demanded to speak to Ivy alone.\n\n\nIvy refused and said that he could say whatever he wanted to Wyatt and Ivy because they had no secrets. Thomas balked, but then Ivy refused to stay, and she left.\n\n\nWyatt warned Thomas to stay away from Ivy. Wyatt reminded Thomas that Ivy had already told him to leave her alone. \"Back off,\" Wyatt said. Wyatt added that she was not available and was committed to him. Liam listened at the door.\n\n\nLater in another office, Steffy told Liam that Thomas had confessed that he and Ivy and had been making out at the Forrester mansion when Wyatt had gone out of town. Liam argued that Thomas often embellished things.\n\n\nSteffy maintained that Ivy had cheated on Wyatt. Liam was unconvinced and believed the truth was somewhere between what Thomas had said and Ivy's version. He advised Steffy to stay out of it. He said it a half dozen times and encouraged Steffy to let Wyatt and Ivy work things out.\n\n\nSteffy sat in her office, and Ivy entered to tell her about a meeting. Steffy quizzed Ivy about spending a lot of time with Thomas. Ivy chalked it up to choosing jewelry to go with his dress designs, but Steffy eventually called her out. Steffy admitted that she had learned all about Ivy's encounter with Thomas while Wyatt had been out of town. Ivy dismissed the idea at first, but Steffy pressured her.\n\n\nIvy admitted that she and Thomas had kissed, but it would never happen again. Ivy added that it was none of Steffy's business. Steffy argued that Wyatt would soon be her brother-in-law, and he deserved a woman who would be loyal to him. She insisted that Ivy had to tell Wyatt what had happened -- or Steffy would. Ivy looked distraught.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy repeats again that Wyatt needs to know what Ivy did the minute he left town. Ivy tells Wyatt that Thomas was devastated of course but he accepted it that she is with Wyatt now. And she wants him right here. Bill tells Katie that she is totally hot in the kitchen and he kisses her right there. He can have his pasta and his wife. It's the greatest feeling in the world and he wants his grown sons to experience the same feeling. Maybe they will be throwing a double wedding before they know it. Wyatt tells Ivy that she is amazing and he knows what he has and he is not worried about Thomas. Liam interrupts before Ivy can say more that might have happened with Thomas. Steffy tells Thomas that he does not like Wyatt so that is why he is going after his girlfriend. Thomas laments nothing is happening anymore. She says but it did and that is cheating. If Ivy's feelings were real this would not have happened. She is supposed to be loyal to Wyatt and he deserves to know they both crossed the line. Thomas says he told her that in confidence and she can not betray that. It is nothing Ivy needs to be publicly shamed over. He says it started out one way but he really likes her. They made out a little bit but it stopped there so just let them go back to their lives. She says sorry, she can not do that. Bill thanks Katie for making him a better man, a man worthy of her. They start making out in the kitchen complete with baring all down to their bare essentials. Ivy drags Wyatt into the design room and plants kisses on him. She says she is so grateful for him and she wants him to know that. He says she is sexy and funny and entertaining .they were best friends first and they learned to trust each other right off the bat and he still does. She says she wants to deserve that and she will. She does not want to lose him. He kisses her and opines that he is going nowhere. Steffy's thoughts are on her face and Liam asks what is wrong. She tells him Ivy is wrong ..she has been cheating on Wyatt right under his nose. Ivy suggests to Wyatt they get away for a couple of days. He says yes, maybe a big old bed and not leave it. Thomas spies them kissing and says he hates to interrupt but he needs to see Ivy. Liam does not want to hear this about Ivy and he can not believe Thomas told Steffy that something almost happened. He says Thomas sees the world through his own ego so just stay out of this and let them work this out. She says Wyatt is a good guy and he deserves better than this. Liam says she does not know all the facts, they just have what Thomas said. He says even if it is true, Wyatt does not need their help. He says they are grownups and it is none of their business. He has to leave but the last words he says out the door is stay out of it! Ivy tells Thomas that whatever he needs he can say it in front of Wyatt. Thomas says no, not this time. She leaves, and Wyatt says again that there is no room in this equation in this for Thomas. Ivy is committed to him, period. Steffy calls Ivy into her office and reminds her that she is spending a lot of time with Thomas and it seems more personal than just the jewelry. She knows women are drawn to Thomas and she knows they kissed and had a private moment on Thanksgiving. She confronted Thomas and he said it was nothing, but then she heard Ivy say she felt guilty .so she knows when Wyatt was in San Francisco she made out with her brother. Ivy says this is not her business. Steffy says if Ivy does not tell Wyatt then she will.",
