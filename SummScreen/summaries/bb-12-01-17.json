    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam filled the silence between him and Sally by asking if he could get her anything. As he listed off drinks and snacks he had, she asked if he was being a good host or testing her for allergies. Liam said he didn't want to appear as if he was giving her the brush-off, so he was patiently waiting to learn the reason for her visit.\n\n\nSally realized that she was about to embarrass herself again. She said it was totally none of her business, but Liam and Steffy had seemed strangely happy at Thanksgiving. Sally said people sometimes put on fronts at the holidays, and she was wondering if things really were okay. She understood that the couple had renewed their vows, \"but it could have been -- \"\n\n\n\"Desperation,\" Liam concluded. Sally really hated when people broke things and then just walked away. She was happy to know she hadn't done that. Sally stood to leave, and he thanked her for the visit. She thanked him for not slamming the door in her face.\n\n\nSally thought it was a shame that she and Liam couldn't be friends. Liam didn't see why not. Sally reasoned that they wouldn't hang out together, and the Spencers wouldn't invite her over. She figured they'd be overly aware of who'd be watching if they encountered each other. Liam was sure it would be like that for a while, \"but in time...\"\n\n\nSally said that, in time, the things that had drawn Liam and her together would be gone. Liam gazed awkwardly at her. She said it was okay and had to be that way. She promised to be there for Liam if he needed her, and she didn't \"give a damn\" who knew it.\n\n\nAt Coco and Sally's, Darlita and Coco hung out together and played cards. Darlita recalled that Liam and Sally had had to go to the hospital for debris inhalation. Darlita thought it was poignant that Liam and Sally had Spectra stuck in their internal organs forever and said it was like a love story of its own.\n\n\nAs Coco and Darlita played, Darlita wondered how terrible it would be if Steffy were lost at sea in an accident. Giggling, Coco replied that they weren't wishing things like that on her boss. Agreeing, Darlita began talking about a television show during which a woman had fallen in love with an island boy who'd rescued her from being lost at sea. Coco didn't see Steffy with an island boy. Darlita said the point was that if Steffy were gone, Liam would be magnetically drawn to the woman who shared his demolition dust.\n\n\nCoco had a hard time concentrating on playing cards. Darlita did, too, and wondered if Sally would return home, brokenhearted. Coco didn't know how else it would go. Coco believed that Sally wanted Liam to have whatever he wanted, and in Sally's heart, Sally knew it wasn't her.\n\n\nLater, Coco was straightening up, and Sally, who'd just arrived, asked who'd been there. Coco said Darlita had stopped by, and Coco had \"kind of\" told Darlita some things she'd already guessed on her own. Sally said her life was an open book to only Coco. Coco was sorry about it, but she said Darlita wouldn't say anything.\n\n\nCoco asked how it had gone with Liam. Sally said he hadn't slammed the door in her face. Sally didn't know if Liam had been happy to see her; however, she'd gone there to see if he were really happy, and he was. Sally considered that he might be happier than he'd been before because it had sounded like a new-and-improved Steffy had emerged from the problems.\n\n\nSally wondered if life might be trying to give her a clue about her future. Coco asked if Sally meant something like a horoscope. Sally explained that she'd always known she hadn't needed a man to make her happy, but she'd been very torn up about Thomas and then Liam. She'd realized the kind of man she needed in her life if she ever let one in again.\n\n\nCoco replied that Sally had it really bad. Sally didn't see it that way. She felt that she had it great. Sally had seen things in Thomas that hadn't been there. It hadn't been Thomas' fault, but Sally didn't believe she'd make that mistake again because she knew what to look for. Because of Liam, she knew the type of woman she had to be to deserve the type of man she wanted.\n\n\nCoco believed Sally already was the type of person she needed to be. Sally wanted to be stronger and to never give up. Sally doubted Steffy would say, \"I can't be who you want me to be, so I'm just going to give up.\" Coco said Steffy might think that when no one was listening.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Steffy asserted that she and Bill were not meant to be. Bill said he was just telling her how he felt; however, he'd honor his commitment to his son because DNA was a bond that transcended time. He said he'd be a good and loyal father. Steffy replied that it would be that way if Liam allowed it.\n\n\nBill asked Steffy not to do what she was thinking of doing because nothing good would result. Steffy noted that he'd expected her to confess before. She asked what the difference was from back then. He replied that she was the difference. He began to remark upon their lovemaking, but Steffy asked him not to refer to it like that. Bill refused to lie to himself or her about what it had meant to finally be with her that night.\n\n\nSteffy decided that she shouldn't have visited. Bill claimed not to want anything from her, and her feelings were her business -- even if she didn't know what they were. He asked her to think carefully before doing to his son what she was thinking. She quipped that she was thinking of being an honest wife, and she asked Bill to get the thought of her running to him out of his head.\n\n\nBill warned that if she was too honest of a wife, Liam would leave her. Steffy refused to believe it. She said one mistake wouldn't end the marriage, but lying would. Bill asserted that lying was the price of happiness, and everyone willingly paid it. Steffy retorted that it might be like that for Bill.\n\n\nSteffy reminded Bill that he was her father-in-law, but Bill reminded her that there had been a time when he hadn't been. He didn't intend to fight Steffy on her choice to remain married, but he wouldn't let her act as if what had happened between them had been void of goodness, merit, or love.\n\n\nSteffy wished it had never happened. Bill replied that it was a wish they didn't share. He said he had a stake in it, too, and he could lose his son if she told Liam. \"And you deserve to!\" Steffy shot back. She insisted upon telling Liam. She didn't know how he'd react, so she warned Bill to be prepared for anything.\n\n\nLater, Steffy arrived home and found Liam working. Liam asked if she was okay and if something had happened at work. She said she hadn't been at work. He noticed that she didn't seem herself, and she replied that hypocrisy would do that to a person. Assuming she was referring to Sally, Liam said he'd had every intention of telling Steffy about Sally's visit.\n\n\nThe distracted Steffy said she wasn't worried about Sally. Liam asked what had made him a hypocrite. After answering that he wasn't, Steffy asked what Sally had wanted. Liam conveyed that Sally had expected some fallout at Thanksgiving and had felt uneasy because there hadn't been any. He said Steffy knew how it was when guilt made one feel the need to be punished or to maybe even insist upon it.\n\n\nSteffy stated that her brass knuckles were at the cleaners, so Sally was out of luck. Liam replied that the reprieve would probably elevate Steffy from princess to empress in Sally's mind. Steffy griped about people seeing her that way. He claimed it was Steffy's fault for being wonderful. He started talking about how he fell in love with her every time he saw her, but he stopped mid-sentence when he saw she was staring off, preoccupied.\n\n\nLiam concluded that his wife was really unhappy about something. Steffy uttered that it was crazy how just a few words could make everything go away. Liam asked who was gone and said he wasn't. He told her that she could tell him whatever it was, and it couldn't be that bad.\n\n\nLiam started to get up, but Steffy stopped him. She became upset and said she couldn't waste more time. She cried that she didn't want him to forget, and she wanted him to love her. Liam said that Steffy was scaring him. Steffy responded that she was scaring herself.\n\n\nLiam asked if Steffy was sick. Sobbing, Steffy said that she wasn't. He didn't understand why she was crying and trembling. She yelled that he wanted her to pretend, but she couldn't anymore. Liam thought it was his fault, and she'd felt trapped and forced into renewing their vows. He berated himself for it and said maybe she hadn't wanted to remain married.\n\n\nSteffy shouted over Liam that she did so want it. Liam and Steffy talked over each other. He kept apologizing to her, and she kept asking him to let her finish talking. She exclaimed that she couldn't let him forget. Liam asked what she wanted him to do. Steffy wanted him to just love her. Liam said she'd always have that, but he wanted to know how to make amends.\n\n\nSteffy said it wasn't about Liam. Refusing to watch her like that anymore, Liam insisted that she tell him what it was right that moment. \"It's about your father...\" Steffy sobbed.\n\n\nBack at Bill's house, Bill waited around for the fallout. He kept checking his phone and flashing back on snippets of his conversation with Steffy. His phone alerted him. He hurriedly checked it. It was Wyatt, asking why Bill and Liam were not at work and if something was going on.\n\n\n",

But he remembers the first time they got wrapped up in each other before bloodlines and relationships interfered. And he cannot lie to himself or to her about their times together. Liam tells Sally that she is taking this brush-off pretty well considering. Darlita tells Coco that it is sort of like a little love story on its own that now both Liam and Sally have the Spectra dust in their systems. If Steffy were gone he would be automatically drawn to that women who he shared so much with. Bill tells Steffy that he is not asking for anything. She can walk away as he understands this is killing her. But she needs to think twice about telling Liam. He is not going to let her paint what they had without goodness and caring. She says he deserves to lose his son. Liam deserves to know so just be prepared for anything. Sally says goodbye and thanks Liam for not slamming the door in her face. He says they are friends. She says she knows but she also knows they are not going to be hanging out together and that is okay. She does make this promise that if he needs her at all she will be there and she doesn't care who knows. Steffy goes home and Liam asks if she is okay. She says no. He says she is not acting like herself. She replies hypocrisy will do that. He tells her first about Sally coming over and now Steffy has been elevated from princess to Empress. But he can see that she is really unhappy about something so just tell him. Whatever it is she can tell him. It cannot be that bad. Sally tells Coco that Liam seems even happier than before. His wife came home and sounds like a new and improved wife. Sally says this time she knows what to look for. She learned her mistakes with Thomas and then Liam. She wants to be strong like Steffy and never give up. Bill cannot stop thinking about his night with Steffy and how they were meant to be. Liam reaches out to Steffy and she pushes him away and won't let him touch her. She cries that she cannot help herself. He asks if she is sick. She says no but she cannot pretend anymore. He thinks he knows that she must feel trapped. He put that whole renewal vows on her without giving her a chance to say no. She cries out that she cannot forget. He wants to know what she wants him to do. She replies just love her. He says he does. She cries out this has to do with his father.",
