    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's house, Hope and Liam discussed that they were glad they could be honest with each other. Hope said that she was happy Liam had met someone like Ivy because Ivy was good for him, and Hope knew that Ivy loved Liam. \"You can tell me anything,\" Hope said. She sniffed. \n\n\nHope and Liam agreed that it was comforting that they were both happy. Liam marveled that Hope was going to have a family and that it was really special. Hope giggled and said that she was excited about her future with Wyatt and their baby. \n\n\nLiam noted that someday they would understand why everything had happened the way it had. Liam added that Hope had been glowing, and that made him happy. He said that he'd seen the change in Hope, and he understood the connection she had to her baby. Hope described it as incredible feeling. \n\n\nHope had to leave to attend her baby shower, but Liam wanted assurance that Quinn would not be there. Hope assured him that Quinn was not permitted anywhere near her or the baby. Liam asked, awkwardly, if he could feel the baby. Hope smiled and agreed. Liam placed his hand on Hope's belly, and Hope placed her hand on top of Liam's hand. Liam sighed, and Hope smiled. Tears streamed down her cheeks. \n\n\nAt Quinn's place, Quinn tried to decide what to wear to Hope's baby shower. Deacon saw her put on makeup and asked where she was going. She teased that she'd known he had grown accustomed to seeing her without clothes, but she had plans. \n\n\nDeacon discouraged her from attending Hope's baby shower. Quinn said she understood that Hope did not want her there. Deacon insisted that Quinn needed to \"stay away from my daughter.\" Deacon encouraged Quinn to give Hope some space.\n\n\nQuinn said that she wanted to be involved in the baby's life. Deacon understood, but he reminded Quinn that she had to steer clear of Hope. Quinn smiled and asked Deacon to save her some whiskey. Quinn left, and Deacon shook his head. \n\n\nMinutes later, Liam arrived and wondered why Deacon was at Quinn's place. Suddenly Liam realized that Deacon had been staying with Quinn. \"Oh, God,\" Liam said. Liam reminded Deacon that Quinn had tried to kill him and that Quinn was dangerous. \n\n\nDeacon declared that Quinn had not hurt him or his daughter, and he did not condone anything that Quinn had done, but she had changed. He tried to explain his relationship with Quinn. Liam was shocked that it had become a relationship. Liam worried about where Quinn had gone, and Deacon admitted he had no idea. \n\n\nLiam advised Deacon to sleep with one eye open, and Deacon replied that he already did. He added that he was not stupid enough to try to control Quinn. \n\n\nAt Eric's house, Aly, Caroline, and Ivy marveled that Pam had pulled a baby shower together so quickly. Pam offered mimosas, and Pam told Caroline that she'd had to invite Maya. Caroline said she didn't care, but it might be awkward for Maya. Aly agreed because Rick had dumped Maya and returned to Caroline. \n\n\nIvy asked if Hope's \"monster-in-law\" had been invited, and Pam noted that Quinn was never to be invited and was shut out of their lives. Donna and Katie entered with a huge bag and gift. Donna added that she had gifts from Brooke and Bridgett as well. Donna and Katie wondered if the \"other grandmom\" had been invited. Everyone noted that Quinn was not welcome, and no one felt sorry for Quinn. Aly added that Quinn had caused people's dislike for her. \n\n\nMaya entered and apologized because she'd had a late fitting. Caroline rolled her eyes. Hope arrived and said that she'd talked to her mother and missed her, but Hope added that Brooke had sent her love to everyone. \n\n\nCaroline hugged Hope. Pam started games where guests had to guess the baby's gender and the date Hope would give birth. They all giggled and gave opinions on what Hope would have. \n\n\nOutside, Quinn stood at the door, but she decided to break in on the second floor. She did get in, and she hid behind a plant near the balcony that overlooked the living room where everyone had gathered. Quinn overheard Hope tell everyone that she'd felt a flutter recently and was excited. Katie advised her to savor it. They all agreed that Spencers made adorable children. Hope wondered if she would soon be an aunt to Caroline's baby, and Caroline said it wouldn't be far off. \n\n\nMaya interrupted, and Pam encouraged everyone to eat. The guests reviewed name ideas for boys and girls. Hope opened Pam's gift -- a homemade blanket with an owl on it. \n\n\nSuddenly, they all turned around and saw Quinn standing in the doorway. Donna reminded her she had not been invited. Quinn begged to be part of the experience and promised not to cause any trouble. Hope glared at Quinn, but Quinn reminded Hope that Quinn had raised Wyatt by herself. \n\n\nQuinn realized that she'd hurt everyone and threatened everyone, but she promised not to cause any harm because she had so much love to give, and she added that no child could ever have too much love. \n\n\nQuinn knelt down and begged Hope to let her into her life. Katie pulled Quinn to her feet and told her to leave. Quinn turned toward the door, but Hope stood up and said, \"Stay.\" Hope walked over to Quinn and called her \"Mom.\" They embraced. \n\n\n",
