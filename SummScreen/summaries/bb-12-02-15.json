Steffy insisted that Ivy had to tell Wyatt -- or Steffy would.\n\n\nIvy said it had all been a mistake. She couldn't believe she had done it, and she felt horrible about it. Steffy understood and maintained that she wasn't trying to attack Ivy, but she wanted to stand up for Wyatt.\n\n\n\"Wouldn't you want to know?\" Steffy asked. Ivy agreed she would, and Steffy added that it was only fair. Ivy said she had no excuse, but there was something about Thomas. \"But it doesn't change my feelings about Wyatt,\" she said.\n\n\nIvy promised to tell Wyatt. She did not want Steffy to tell him. Steffy agreed. Ivy said she would tell Wyatt immediately.\n\n\nIn the design office, Wyatt lectured Thomas on staying away from Ivy. Liam had been standing in the doorway and overheard the conversation. Thomas invited Liam in to make it a \"family affair.\" Wyatt continued to reiterate that Ivy was his girlfriend and uninterested in Thomas. \"So back off. Ivy is committed to me,\" Wyatt said. He declared Ivy was off-limits.\n\n\nLiam stepped in and said that Wyatt had made his point, and he was sure that Thomas would agree. Thomas said that he understood why Wyatt had been attracted to Ivy, and he wasn't trying to cause problems. \"But I don't get what she sees in you,\" Thomas said.\n\n\nLiam left, and Wyatt continued to badger Thomas. Ivy walked in, and Thomas left. Ivy looked upset. Wyatt said he felt he might have gotten through to Thomas. He noticed that Ivy was agitated, and he asked what was wrong. \"It's Thomas,\" Ivy answered.\n\n\nWyatt understood that Thomas had been making unwelcome advances, and he hoped it would end. He knew that it was all Thomas' fault, because he had become accustomed to \"the models drooling over him.\"\n\n\nWyatt wanted to stop talking about Thomas. He wanted Ivy to meet him for dinner and a jump in the ocean. Ivy said it sounded wonderful, but they had to talk. Wyatt agreed and said they could talk over dinner. They kissed, and Ivy told Wyatt what \"a wonderful, kind man\" he was. \"I appreciate you, and I'm so happy with you,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Katie and Bill were in bed, and they noted that the silence was nice because Will had been napping. Bill promised that Katie would not be getting any sleep because he had plans for more one-on-one time with his wife. They drank wine and made out. Katie said that she liked the new Bill.\n\n\nBill agreed he had wasted \"way too much time worrying about Liam and Wyatt.\" He felt they were getting their acts together. He added that Katie should admit that Steffy was the right woman for Liam. Katie grew cool. \"We were having such a nice time,\" she said.\n\n\nBill said that Steffy clearly loved Liam. Katie said she felt Wyatt and Liam should do whatever they wanted to do. Bill wondered if Steffy and Liam might want to marry at the Spencer house. Bill was happy that his boys appeared to be settling down, especially Liam. \"He deserves some happiness like this,\" Bill said.\n\n\nBill added that Hope had put Liam and Wyatt through the ringer. Katie cautioned Bill not to talk badly about her niece, but she understood that Wyatt and Liam had experienced a lot of drama. Bill and Katie made love.\n\n\nLater, Bill and Katie snuggled, and Bill said he wanted to \"do this more often.\" Katie said she loved that he appreciated her. They exchange I love you's, and Bill admitted that his new, improved version was \"just a byproduct of having such a phenomenal wife.\" \"It doesn't get any better than this,\" Katie said. \"No it doesn't,\" Bill agreed.\n\n\nLiam entered Steffy's office, and she reminded Liam that he loved her and had proposed to her. \"What did you do?\" he asked. She admitted that she had told Ivy she knew about Ivy kissing Thomas, and Ivy had to tell Wyatt or Steffy would.\n\n\n\"Oh, my God, Steffy,\" Liam shouted. \"I'm glad I did it,\" Steffy countered. Liam was exasperated. Steffy maintained that she was looking out for his brother. Liam replied that it was up to Ivy to tell Wyatt -- not Steffy. Steffy called Ivy untrustworthy, and Liam grew impatient. \"Let Ivy be the one. Promise me, Steffy,\" Liam pleaded.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's, Ivy lit candles and spread them around the room. Liam entered and said that he had received Ivy's text. Ivy started to explain, but Liam said Steffy had filled him in. Ivy said she planned to tell Wyatt that evening. She didn't have a reason for falling for Thomas' flirtations. Ivy worried that Steffy would tell Wyatt, but Liam promised that Steffy would not say anything. Ivy wondered if she would lose Wyatt. Liam said he had a right to know. Ivy wanted to get it over with.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Wyatt entered Steffy's office to deliver some papers. Steffy started a conversation about Ivy's commitment to Wyatt. Steffy hoped that Ivy appreciated him. Wyatt happily said she did. Steffy wondered if he knew his girlfriend as well as he thought he did.\n\n\nWyatt grew impatient because Steffy clearly had something she disliked about Ivy. Steffy said she was looking out for Wyatt. He thanked her but said there would be no issues if her brother Thomas, \"the resident playboy,\" hadn't been hitting on Ivy. Wyatt maintained that Ivy was loyal to him and would not betray him.\n\n\nSteffy wondered if Ivy had been so innocent. She suggested that Wyatt talk to Ivy. \"What are you implying? Tell me what you think you know,\" Wyatt ordered. \"She's been unfaithful. Ivy cheated on you with Thomas,\" Steffy announced.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy tells Ivy that she is busy and there are things she should be doing but Wyatt is her friend and she won't stand by while she is cheating on him. Ivy needs to tell Wyatt or she will. She admits what Steffy knows that she was alone in the house with Thomas. It was a mistake and will never happen again. She is not that kind of person; she does not cheat. In the end she agrees that she will tell Wyatt right now without Steffy being involved. Thomas plays coy and asks Wyatt if he is telling him to stay away from Ivy. Liam walks in and Thomas invites him to come in and make this a family affair. Wyatt repeats again that he needs to back off as Ivy is not available. They are practically living together so Thomas needs to go find another woman. Thomas makes a slam that he doesn't know what Ivy sees in Wyatt. Nowhere in there does Wyatt hear Thomas say he will back off and leave his girlfriend alone.

Wyatt hopes he got through to him and they can now move on with their lives. Ivy admits she has a problem with Thomas. Bill and Katie continue their love fest in bed. She is glad to hear that he thinks his sons are getting their lives together. She won't go as far as saying Steffy is the right woman for Liam but she does want him to be happy. Liam goes back to Ridge's office and is sorry to hear that Steffy confronted Ivy about Thomas. He had asked her repeatedly to stay out of their business. She hopes he is not too mad at her; Ivy came in and it just tumbled out of her mouth. But she agrees with Liam, even though Ivy is untrustworthy, she needs to be the one to tell Wyatt the truth.
