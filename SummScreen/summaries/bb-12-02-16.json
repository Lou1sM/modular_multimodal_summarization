    "tvmega_recap": "Quinn tells Eric this is her favorite time \u0096 those small, quiet moments they have together. He says no moment with her is small. She asks if it is not time for him to go back to work. He is not sure he wants to; he likes this peace and quiet. Wyatt walks in and says he cannot compete with them but he also cannot keep thinking about her. Quinn says she is sorry and wishes there was something she could do. Quinn tells Eric that he did nothing wrong but Steffy left Wyatt anyway. She has to do something. Eric says he likes Wyatt too so if there is anything he can do, do not be quiet. Meanwhile Steffy and Liam are cuddled in each other's arms on the couch exchanging passionate kisses. Before she leaves Bill ..a sullen Bill walks in and tells them that Brooke has gone back to Forrester. Ridge and Brooke go over the significance of Bridge and now they are on that bridge that is destiny. Steffy tells Bill that for whatever it is worth, she believes Brooke does love him. Bill says yes but Ridge and RJ just got in her head with the guilt. Liam says he will offer scotch and not a pep talk. He tells Bill that he knew Steffy was the one and he never gave up and neither should Bill. RJ welcomes Brooke back with a hug and she says she is back. Ridge adds they are back. RJ tells his mom that she made the right choice. Now they are a real family again .group hug. Ridge tells Brooke later that when he came back from Paris his first thought was to get back with Brooke but it just was not their time. Now is their time. Wyatt gives Eric Quinn's special ugly glass of special nutriments. He mentions Steffy and that Quinn wants her to be the CEO and Eric says he could be too if he wants it. While Quinn is alone Steffy stops by to see Eric but Quinn stops her and wants to talk to her first. She says she and Eric were talking and he is talking about not coming back to work as he is happy with his life right now. Steffy guesses that she is angling for herself to be CEO. Quinn replies no, she had Steffy in mind. Eric tells Wyatt not to give up on Steffy, he has to fight for her even over his brother Liam. He has nothing to lose. Bill asks about Liam and Steffy and says just because his relationship did not work out does not mean he is not interested in Liam's. Liam says nothing will stop them this time. They just need to get the divorce from Wyatt. Steffy feels like this is just a ploy of Quinn's to put Eric off track so that she can get control of the company. Quinn says no, Steffy is qualified and was once just a heartbeat away from being CEO when she was President. She is more than qualified. She does not think Eric will disagree with her. And all together they could take this company way into the future. This can all happen. Forrester needs new blood at the top if Eric does not come back and that is Steffy.",
