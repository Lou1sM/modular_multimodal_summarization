    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the design office, Quinn ran an idea past Thomas then asked to get personal with him. She said that she knew he had a thing for Ivy, her son's girlfriend. He figured she was fighting her son's battles. Quinn didn't know there was a battle for Ivy and quipped that Thomas was supposed to be irresistible to women. He asked if Quinn thought so. \"No, but you do,\" Quinn replied.\n\n\nThomas guessed that Quinn was an exception to the rule. Quinn said he couldn't handle a woman like her. He asked if it was a challenge. In a cutesy voice, she called him a charmer with an ego. Quinn said she wasn't defending her son's relationship. She just didn't want Wyatt to get hurt. Quinn had learned to like Ivy, but in Quinn's view, Wyatt was better suited for Steffy.\n\n\nQuinn knew that Thomas had no respect for Wyatt, which was the reason Thomas was going after Wyatt's girlfriend. She also didn't think Thomas would even be interested in syrupy Ivy if Ivy didn't belong to Wyatt. Thomas gleaned that Quinn had no respect for Ivy.\n\n\nQuinn said she liked Ivy; however, Steffy was a powerhouse, and Wyatt and Steffy had once shared an interest in each other. Thomas noted that the problem with Quinn's romance novel was that Steffy was in love with Liam. Quinn didn't get why Steffy was. Thomas assumed it was history. Quinn said Steffy hadn't learned from it, and Thomas quipped, \"And thus is doomed to repeat.\"\n\n\nQuinn remarked that Wyatt being with Steffy would open up the field for Thomas. Thomas noted that Quinn was calculating. Quinn claimed to just want her son to be happy. She hated to say it, but she felt Ivy was beneath Wyatt. \"But not beneath me?\" Thomas asked.\n\n\nShrugging, Quinn figured that, in Thomas' view, all women were beneath him. She noted that he treated them all the same, like pleasure pieces. He said it wasn't true, and she asked if he could be serious about a woman. He replied that it wouldn't be the first time. She asked if he could be serious about Ivy. He said an affirmative response would fit into Quinn's calculated puzzle.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Liam didn't understand why Ivy would cheat on Wyatt -- and with Thomas of all people. Liam had always known her to be a good person. Ivy replied that she was fallible. Liam asked how she could let it happen with Thomas. She replied that it had been a perfect storm; Thomas had saved her from the falling light, and they'd been alone in the house.\n\n\nLiam asked if Thomas had been aggressive with her. Ivy claimed that Thomas had been a gentleman. Liam quipped that gentlemen didn't make moves on unavailable women. She guessed that she hadn't resisted enough. Ivy claimed that Thomas had a swagger with women, and before she'd known it, they'd started kissing. She knew it sounded really bad.\n\n\nLiam stated that it hadn't been as bad as it could have been. Ivy replied that she wouldn't have gone all the way. Liam believed that Thomas would have, and it was the reason Liam felt that she had to stay away from Thomas. Liam didn't even think she should be in the same office with Thomas. Ivy declared that it wouldn't happen again, and she'd made it clear to Thomas.\n\n\nIvy figured that she'd put Liam in a tough position. Liam said that he and Wyatt had their differences, but he wanted what was best for Wyatt. Liam had thought it was Ivy. Ivy exclaimed that it was she, and Liam replied that he wasn't the one she had to convince. Ivy said she was human just like anyone else, and she couldn't lose Wyatt over something like \"this.\"\n\n\nLiam told Ivy to be as open and honest as she could be. Ivy asked what to do if it didn't work. Liam replied that she had to tell herself that it wasn't meant to be. Ivy bashed herself for hurting someone she loved \"so much.\" She stated that Wyatt had to forgive her. She was sure it would take time, but she said working through things was what she and Wyatt did together.\n\n\nLiam hugged Ivy and said to let him know if she needed a shoulder.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Wyatt was disappointed in Steffy for carrying on the vendetta against Ivy. He said that Steffy didn't really believe what she was saying, or Steffy was deluding herself if she did believe it because Ivy wouldn't cheat on him with Thomas or anyone else.\n\n\nWyatt felt that Ivy had been the most loyal woman he'd ever been close to. Steffy explained that, after she'd learned from Thomas that he'd kissed Ivy at the office, she'd told him to back off and respect the relationship Ivy had with Wyatt; however, Steffy had then overheard Ivy, who'd been emotional and guilt-ridden, telling Thomas that \"it\" would never happen again.\n\n\nStill in denial, Wyatt asked what it had been. Steffy said she'd gone to Thomas for an explanation, and though Thomas had denied it at first, he eventually admitted that something had happened. \"Did they...?\" Wyatt slowly asked. Steffy indicated that it wasn't what Wyatt was thinking, but she'd confronted Ivy, who then confessed to cheating on Wyatt with Thomas.\n\n\nSteffy relayed that after she'd confronted Ivy, Ivy had had no choice but to admit it. Steffy had told Ivy that Wyatt deserved to know. Even though Ivy had said she'd tell Wyatt, Steffy didn't know if Ivy would. Wyatt asked if Steffy was sure there hadn't been any sex. Steffy asked what the difference was and said kissing and making out was still cheating.\n\n\nSteffy was sorry about dumping it on Wyatt, but he'd deserved the truth. Wyatt felt like an idiot, but Steffy said Ivy was the idiot for turning her back on him. He guessed he needed to talk to Ivy. He thanked Steffy and walked out.\n\n\nLater, Liam arrived and told Steffy that Ivy had called him over to the beach house to talk about what she'd told Steffy. Steffy was sure Ivy wouldn't tell Wyatt the truth. Liam replied that Ivy would do just that, and it would blow Wyatt's mind. \"No, it won't. Wyatt knows. I told him,\" Steffy revealed.\n\n\nBack at the beach house, a solemn Wyatt arrived. Ivy offered him some wine and said that they really needed to talk. He noted her jitteriness, and she said something had been weighing on her. She asked Wyatt not to doubt how much she loved him. Wyatt's support and love meant everything to her. She said he'd been good to her and good for her.\n\n\nWyatt said they'd been good for each other, and they could take whatever the world threw at them. They'd had each other's backs through honesty and trust. Those things had been what their relationship had been based upon. Ivy replied that he'd once said he'd never give up on her or on them, and she needed to know he'd meant it.\n\n\nWyatt stated that he'd never go back on his word, not to someone he loved and trusted so deeply. He said they'd been through a lot of disappointments and rejection. It had supposedly been their fresh start. He recalled that he'd made light of Thomas flirting with Ivy.\n\n\nWyatt recalled that he had been flattered that someone had had the hots for his girl. He hadn't needed Ivy's reassurance because he'd had total faith in her. Ivy shed tears as he guessed it had been misplaced. He said he'd been so sure and so wrong. \"Thomas? Of all people, Thomas?\" Wyatt asked.\n\n\nIvy said that it had been stupid and a mistake. She didn't even know how it had happened. She asserted that she was \"so in love\" with Wyatt, and he was the only man she wanted to be with. Ivy reached for him, but he pulled back. She asked Wyatt not to give up on them.\n\n\n",

Het tells her to cut to the chase. He doesn't imagine much is awkward to her. She points out that Ivy is her son's girlfriend. Liam tells Ivy that he knows who she is, very loyal and he still thinks that. She says she has not changed for the worse but she does make mistakes. He asks if she still loves Wyatt and she replies yes. And she still does not know how this happened. She knows Wyatt will be devastated but she has to tell him. She says Thomas was a perfect storm. He saved her from that falling light and then Wyatt left town and left them alone together. She did not resist him the way she should. It started with kissing. Liam says she should not even be in the same office with him must less a house. Quinn tells Thomas that he is irresistible with women, well not all, she does not think so but Thomas believes it. It's his ego. But Wyatt is better suited to his sister so she will not fight for Ivy. Thomas tells her that her little romance novel has one glitz, Steffy is in love with Liam. She says it is still something to think about. Steffy fills Wyatt in with a few more details and Wyatt says Thomas would tell her anything to help break them up. She tells him what Ivy said in guilt, that it could never happen again and then Thomas admitted something happened. It was not the deed itself but nonetheless she cheated on him. Liam tells Ivy that all she can do is be open and honest. She says Wyatt has to forgive her. She can regain his trust. That is what they do. He hugs her and says he has a shoulder if she needs it. Steffy laments to Wyatt that she is sorry. She told Ivy that she had no choice but to come clean. She is surprised she has not told him yet. He seethes that Ivy has kept this from him all this time. She says again that she is sorry but now he knows the truth. He opines that he feels like such an idiot. Steffy says no, he is not the idiot. It is Ivy who turned her back on him. Quinn tells Thomas that she does not approve of what he is doing but she also does not really approve of Ivy either. She likes her but not as a girlfriend for her son. She is beneath him ..but not for Thomas as all women are beneath him. Liam returns and tells Steffy that he just came from seeing Ivy. He tried to be a friend as she is upset. Steffy says she ought to be upset, not for telling Steffy but from cheating on Wyatt and keeping it from him. Wyatt returns home on the down side. She hands him some wine and he remarks that she seems jittery. She wants to relax first and he says he is relaxed. So she starts that there is something she needs to tell him. She does not want him to doubt that she loves him. He comments they have had each other's backs. That is their strong suit, what their relationship is based on. He trusted her so deeply and they have been through so many disappointments and rejections. This was supposed to be their fresh start, at least he thought so. He knows he has made light of the whole Thomas situation and he did not need that assurance because he had total faith in her, but he guesses that was misplaced. He was so wrong. She cries that it was so wrong, a bad mistake and Wyatt is the only man she is in love with .so please do not give up on them.",
