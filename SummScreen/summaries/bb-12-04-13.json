Liam worried that Wyatt had some great idea about a photo shoot with new jewelry. Liam sarcastically wondered if Wyatt had become the head of PR at Forrester. Katie told Liam to stop worrying about Wyatt. Liam asked, \"Why do I feel like I am losing her.\"\n\n\nKatie noted that Liam had lost the old Hope but not to Wyatt. \"She's not the same,\" Katie said. Katie explained that Hope had lost Liam many times, and she had learned to cope. Katie added that Hope had experienced success with her clothing line followed by failure and success again. It had all forced Hope to grow up. \"You want it to be the way it used to be,\" Katie said.\n\n\nKatie warned that Hope needed time to enjoy success. Katie suggested that Liam needed to figure out what he needed. Liam said that he realized they had both grown older, but he said that Hope was still the same girl he had fallen in love with.\n\n\nKatie changed the subject and said that it was time for a review. Liam worried that every time his dad had given him his annual review, Bill had said that Liam \"sucked less this year than last year.\" Katie joked that Bill should have been a motivational speaker.\n\n\nKatie confided that she wanted Liam to give her a review. Katie asked if she had been a basket case at dinner on Thanksgiving. Liam responded that Katie had been more composed than Brooke or Bill. Katie quizzed Liam about Bill. She wondered if Bill had said anything about Katie. \n\n\nLiam was uncomfortable. Katie wondered if Bill and Brooke spent any time together at Liam's house, but Liam said that Brooke had never stopped over. Katie wondered if Hope had said anything about Bill and Brooke, but Liam said that Hope rarely talked about her mom to him.\n\n\nKatie worried that Bill was still lovesick over Brooke. Liam said that he knew nothing. Katie asked what Bill did all day, and Liam said that Bill awakened every day, ready to lead an army into battle, but there was no army. Katie worried that Bill still wanted Brooke, and Brooke had better watch out because Bill always won.\n\n\nAt a Hope for the Future photo shoot, Oliver photographed Hope in a black dress with jewelry while Wyatt watched. Maya, dressed in white, joined Hope in the photo shoot, and Wyatt encouraged them to behave like sisters and then like rivals. Next, he suggested they were best friends. Hope and Maya hammed it up for the camera. Wyatt teased that a catfight was on the way. Wyatt worked his way into the photo to break it up.\n\n\nHope liked the idea of Wyatt in the photo, and she encouraged Aly to ask Brooke or Thorne to find some wardrobe pieces for Wyatt because Wyatt had been wearing a plaid shirt and jeans and needed something more formal for the photos. Aly returned with wardrobe, and Wyatt posed with Maya and Hope. Oliver teased that Hope had discovered Wyatt, and Wyatt said that Hope had found him in the woods.\n\n\nHope and Wyatt got into some sexy shots, and Aly looked uncomfortable. Wyatt kissed Hope passionately. Aly was surprised. After the photo shoot, Aly said that she thought the shoot would have taken longer. Hope commented that they had a good team, and they knew what they wanted and worked well together. \n\n\nAly said that some of the shots with Wyatt were unusable. Hope noted that Wyatt had taken things a little too far, but Hope said that it was part of his charm. Aly disagreed and was surprised that Hope would have been charmed by Wyatt. Hope looked uncomfortable.\n\n\nHope advised that Wyatt wasn't taking advantage of Hope. Aly wondered what Liam would think. Aly said that it was unfair to Liam that Wyatt had clearly liked to upset Liam.\n\n\nHope explained that for a long time, Hope had constantly worried about Steffy ruining her relationship with Liam. Hope said that she had finally decided to concentrate on herself rather than her relationship with Liam. Aly wondered if Hope would choose a relationship with Liam once the line was successful. Hope answered with a quirky response that Liam had a cheerleader in Aly.\n\n\nAly, Oliver, Wyatt, and Hope all looked at the photos from the photo shoot. Hope enabled Aly's phone to access the Forrester server so that Aly could view the photos from her phone. Wyatt loved the photo of him passionately kissing Hope, but Hope skipped over it and claimed she had deleted it.\n\n\nLater, Aly was alone in the office and accessed the photo of Wyatt kissing Hope. She sent the photo to Liam. At Spencer, Liam picked up his phone and saw the photo of Hope and Liam. He grimaced.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke sat in an office, and Bill entered. Brooke wondered if Bill had arrived to see Rick or Eric. Bill ignored her. Brooke insisted that Bill leave the door open, but he closed it and locked it.\n\n\nBill said they had unfinished business in regard to Brooke's Bedroom. Brooke told Bill they would never again be in her bedroom. Bill insisted that the clock had been ticking on the relaunch of her line, which had been one of Forrester's most successful lines.\n\n\nBrooke said that her line had not been a priority. Brooke reminded Bill that Hope had resurrected Hope for the Future successfully -- twice -- from the grave. Bill recalled that Brooke had planned to relaunch Brooke's Bedroom, but Brooke reminded Bill that she had painfully had to withdraw as the spokesmodel because she had been pregnant with his child.\n\n\nBill admitted that he had screwed up, but he refused to crawl back to Brooke and beg for forgiveness. Bill said that he had missed Brooke. He touched her arm and gently held her hand. Brooke removed her hand and said she refused to allow herself to return to a relationship with him. Brooke emotionally begged Bill to leave.\n\n\nBill said there had to be a way to be in the same room together. Brooke reiterated that there had to be a way to get what he wanted was what he meant. Brooke reminded Bill that they had made a mistake. \"Now it's over,\" she said. Bill refused to believe that they would never be alone again and in bed again. Bill refused to accept that he would never touch Brooke again.\n\n\nBill asked Brooke what she thought of when she was alone at night, because Bill said that he thought of Brooke. Brooke turned to Bill and said \"Goodbye, Bill. That's what I tell myself.\" Bill exited, and Brooke closed her eyes and cried. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "There's a photo shoot. Oliver is snapping the photos of Hope in sexy, provocative poses. Wyatt is enjoying watching and of course shadow girl is taking notes and watching the expressions on everyone's face. Mostly doom and gloom in Liam's office, he's throwing paper airplanes around when Katie walks in. He tries to find out how her day is going but quickly it gets turned around that Hope had a thing today, one that he is not too happy about surmises Katie. He grumbles that suddenly it's like Wyatt is in charge of the entire PR department just because he offered some designs for Hope's line. He feels like he is losing her. Brooke is back at work and Bill suddenly strolls in. She tells him that he can not be here. He says he owns part of this company. He has every right to be here. He starts to close the door and she tells him to keep it open. He makes a point of closing it and locking it. She tells him this is not funny. He says it could even be hysterical if she calls security and tries to have him escorted out of here. She says it doesn't make any difference; he's gonna do what he wants to anyway. He tells her she can't pretend that she doesn't know him ..every part of him. That's why he is here. They have unfinished business in her bedroom. She says he is disgusting. He says Brooke's Bedroom .the biggest selling line in FC. My my, Brooke's mind tsk tsk! Katie tells Liam okay, here goes. He has lost Hope but not to Wyatt. It has to be obvious even to Liam that Hope is not that same uncertain young woman that he fell in love with. Hope's had success, she's had failure and then even greater success and more failure when she lost Liam. These had major impacts on her. They force you to grow up and be self reliant. She points out that Hope doesn't need him like she used to and that is not a bad thing. He wonders if that means he has nothing to offer Hope anymore. She says no, she just thinks he wants it the way it used to be; him and Hope against the world. And he's the dragon slayer. But the world is on Hope's side now and she can slay those dragons all by herself. So stop poking around in Hope's mind and poke around in his own. He needs to know what he needs. Then she asks him about Thanksgiving Day. She hopes she didn't come off acting like a basket case. She pries a bit if Bill has seen or talked about Brooke at home with him. He assures her that he hasn't. Katie asks if Brooke has come over to see Bill. Again Liam replies no. He's like a crazy person as he gets up every morning like he has am army to command but there is nothing for him to do or nowhere for him to go. Katie says the real kicker is those kind always win. If he's made a strategic target on Brooke then she better watch out. Oliver takes lots more shots of Hope then Wyatt calls in Maya and offers some suggestions to pose as best friends, as rivals, as sisters. Wyatt then says somebody needs to break this up and he joins the girls in the shoot and asks if anyone ordered a plumber. Aly looks uncomfortable. Against Wyatt's wishes, Oliver wants Wyatt to get made up and take a few more shots. Brooke tells Bill to just give it a rest. He says he only wants to talk business with her. She says FC is doing just fine so he just needs to collect his dividend check and be grateful. He tells her that HFTF surprised him and they are trending but it will have a short shelf life and then the public will be looking for the next big thing. Brooke says Hope has resurrected that line twice from the grave so she is not so worried about it. Someone knocks on the door so Bill has to unlock the door and let them in. It's Aly and she stammers that she is sorry that she interrupted. Brooke says great. It took months for people to stop talking about them and now they are going to be talking again. He's amused that she wants to live her life so nobody finds any fault with her. She says no that is not what matters. She doesn't want them to be right. He says she was all in favor of dusting off and rebooting the bedroom line when he first suggested it. She says they did but then it fizzled. He says that was because she could not be the lead model and had to back away. She says he does not have to bring that up now. She was pregnant with his child and that disqualified her as a model and as a sister and as a human being. She says she realizes he has a ton of time on his hands lately that he can waste, but she doesn't really have that so will he please go. He says there has to be a way that they can be in the same room. That is what he wants. She asks how that is working out for him. He says he screwed up. He knows it, Brooke knows it. Surely she doesn't want him to come crawling on his belly. That isn't going to happen. She says she just doesn't want him to keep making all these excuses to see her or talk to other people about her. It only makes things worse for her. She admits it hurts her when she has to push him away. He says then don't. He puts his hand out to cover hers and tells her just be herself. She says she can't. She won't be that person that she can't trust anymore. He reminds her that his niece is married now to her son. They are going to be in the same spaces. She says maybe but never again behind closed, locked doors. He says he can not accept that as to never touch her again or lie down next to her again or wake her up in the middle of the night. He touches her arm and she flinches and tries to hold it together. He says so he is supposed to tell himself that the best months of his life are now over. She says she can not help what stories he tells himself. He wants to know what she tells herself when she is alone each night. She says, \"goodnight, Bill, that what I tell myself.\" He walks out. She sighs heavily and the tears fall. Oliver takes a lot more shots of Wyatt and Hope, him behind her running his fingers over her necklace, touching her neck, he even dips her and kisses her. Again Aly looks mighty uncomfortable. Oliver says they have some great shots here. Hope tells Aly that was her first photo shoot and she hopes she liked it. Aly said it didn't take as long as she expected. Hope says she should have known Wyatt would be good at it since he is such a ham. Aly says some of those pictures Hope may not want to use since Wyatt kissed her. Hope responds that yeah, sometimes Wyatt takes things a little far but she thinks that is part of his charm. Aly says she is surprised that Hope would be charmed by that. Hope wants to know if Aly is worried about her. Aly says she knows that Hope knows what she is doing. Hope says she hopes Aly doesn't think that Wyatt will take advantage of her; she can manage him. Aly asks isn't Hope afraid of what Liam will think. Hope says it's true Liam and Wyatt don't like each other but there is nothing she can do about that. Aly says maybe Hope doesn't see it but on Thanksgiving she got the impression that Wyatt likes to upset Liam. Hope says she sees it too and she knows it looks strange to Aly. But she spent a very long time with Liam planning weddings and always afraid that Steffy would come back into his life. She is just now taking some time for herself to have fun and enjoy herself. Aly agrees that makes sense. But she needs to hear Hope says that once she gets her line re-established, she will be with Liam. Hope says Liam really doesn't know what a cheerleader he has in her. Wyatt, Oliver, Hope and Aly all gather their iPhones and make sure they have all the photos. Wyatt especially likes the kissing one and thinks the world wants to see that. Hope jokes around but ends up deleting it from the considerations. Wyatt tries to persuade Oliver to get it back. Alone Aly goes through all the pictures on her iPhone and stops on the kissing picture. She hesitates but ends up sending it in an e-mail to Liam and says she thought he should know.",

At the end of the day, Rick asked Rick to see Rick in an office, and Rick said that Rick would see him in the Bedroom, and he left the door open and locked it. The doorbell rang, but Rick ignored it and said he would see Rick when he got home from work, and the doorbell went off and Rick went to the office and opened the door to find Rick and Brooke in bed together.\n"
