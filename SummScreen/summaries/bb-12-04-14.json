    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the loft, Liam pressed Quinn to admit the truth about being at the baby shower. Quinn felt as if she were being maligned. He insisted that he was protecting Hope, but Quinn contended that Hope had a husband for that. Quinn claimed to have gotten the cake from a bakery, but Liam accused her of ignoring Hope's wishes, going to the party, and taking the cake as a memento.\n\n\nQuinn stood by her bakery story, but Liam asked for the name of the shop. She told him to lay off, but he refused to do so as long as she was stalking Hope. Quinn asked why she'd stalk her family. He replied that her exile was driving her crazy. Quinn said it was tearing her apart to be treated like a pariah instead of the doting grandmother-to-be she actually was.\n\n\nLiam hoped that Quinn wasn't blaming it on Hope after all she'd done to Hope. Quinn stated that she'd made it possible for Hope to marry a man who idolized her and wouldn't give another woman a second thought as Liam had with Steffy. Quinn said she might have been overzealous; however, the baby had secured Hope and Wyatt's marriage, and Quinn was no longer a threat.\n\n\nThe disbelieving Liam asked why Quinn was still showing up where she didn't belong and stalking Hope. He vowed that Quinn would never be rid of him as long as she was a threat to Hope.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Hope and Ivy packed up after the baby shower. Ivy asked what Hope and Wyatt would name the baby. Hope wanted to name a baby girl after her grandmother, Beth.\n\n\nHope recalled that Ivy had said that she accepted Hope being a part of Liam's life. Ivy noted that Liam and Hope shared a history and would be connected forever. Ivy loved how protective and loyal Liam was, and she wanted Hope's baby to get to know its uncle.\n\n\nHope conveyed that she'd visited Liam earlier to let him know she'd witnessed the boat kiss in Amsterdam. Hope said she knew that Liam and Ivy had expressed love for each other. Ivy acknowledged her love for Liam and that the baby had changed the course of Liam and Hope's lives. Hope said Quinn had done the course-changing by pushing Ivy into the river. Sighing, Hope decided that she had to stop the might-have-beens that lurked in her head.\n\n\nHope declared that she was committed to Wyatt and the child. Ivy believed that Hope would be a good mother. Hope said Liam had said the same thing. Ivy stated that it was because he knew Hope \"so well\" and cared about her. Hope replied that she cared about him, too.\n\n\nLater, Ivy was alone when Liam called to hear how the party had gone and if Quinn had been there. Ivy hadn't seen Quinn. He asked if they'd had vanilla cake with fresh berries at the party, and Ivy wondered how he'd known about the cake. He said he'd tell her later.\n\n\nBack at the loft after the call, Quinn claimed that it wasn't what Liam thought. Liam theorized that, like a creepy stalker, she'd crashed the party and lurked in the shadows. Unable to leave empty-handed, she'd swiped some cake on the way out. He began to guess what Hope would think, but Quinn yelled at him to stop running to Hope with negativity about Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn declared that she wasn't a threat; she was a mother and grandmother who didn't want to be ostracized from the family that meant everything to her. She asked if Liam could understand and have empathy. She wanted everyone to unite for everyone's sakes, but especially for Hope and the baby.\n\n\nLiam noted that Quinn almost sounded sincere. Quinn claimed to be such, but he figured she was back-pedaling after another deception. He didn't believe a word out of her mouth and felt that Hope didn't either. He believed Quinn would say or do anything to get her way. Quinn claimed to want to put her family together, but he said they were better off without her.\n\n\nQuinn told Liam that it wasn't true, but he insisted that it was. Liam noted that she had no impulse control or boundaries, and she didn't think about consequences. He felt sorry for Wyatt, but Quinn countered that Liam couldn't stay out of Wyatt's marriage or accept that Wyatt was married to Hope, who was having Wyatt's baby. Quinn asked why Liam couldn't move on like Wyatt and Hope had.\n\n\nLiam said that moving on didn't mean he didn't care about Hope or that she wouldn't be an important part of his life. Quinn said he'd always love Hope, and he agreed, adding that he'd be married to her if it hadn't been for Quinn. Quinn asked why he couldn't forgive her the way he'd forgiven Bill.\n\n\nLiam stated that Bill had learned from his meddling and had been genuinely sorry. Quinn, on the other hand, was only sorry when she got caught. Liam had always believed that Quinn was a danger to Hope, and he declared that she'd have to deal with him if she got near Hope again.\n\n\nLater, Liam was in his car, on the phone with Hope. He asked to meet with her about Quinn, and Hope agreed to meet him at Brooke's house.\n\n\nHope arrived at the house first, and when Liam got there, he said he couldn't stop worrying about Quinn. Hope was worried, too, but hated getting between a mother and son. He insisted that Hope was being a protective mother and looking out for her baby. Liam felt that Hope had every right to be worried about Quinn, and Hope asked if she had even more reason \"now.\"\n\n\nLiam explained that he'd found out that Quinn had crashed the baby shower. He told Hope about a piece of cake Quinn had that matched the cake at Hope's shower. Hope freaked out. Liam said he didn't know how Quinn had sneaked into Eric's house, but he'd put her on notice. He insisted that he had Hope's back, he'd never stop looking out for her, and he'd always be concerned about her.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Justin arrived to hear about the fight Bill had had with Ridge. Bill asserted that no one, including \"fashion boy,\" messed with his family and got away with it.\n\n\nWyatt arrived, and Justin exited. Bill poured Wyatt a drink and asked if things were okay with Hope and the baby. Wyatt told Bill about the baby shower, but Bill was sure Wyatt hadn't arrived to discuss that. Wyatt revealed that he was worried about his mother. Bill asked what it was that time.\n\n\nWyatt revealed that Quinn and Deacon were together, but Bill already knew that. Wyatt began talking about the strong stance Hope had taken about Quinn, but Bill already knew about that, too. Wyatt asked how his father knew, and Bill explained that Quinn had tried to get his support -- which he hadn't given. Bill believed that Hope had every reason to be wary of Quinn, and acknowledged that Wyatt was in a tough spot because he was in the middle.\n\n\nWyatt felt bad about cutting his mother off, but Hope was his wife. Bill advised Wyatt to tell Quinn to steer clear. Wyatt didn't think it would do any good. Bill advised Wyatt to show Quinn that he meant business with a restraining order. Bill believed that Quinn would keep badgering the couple, and it wasn't good for the mother-to-be. Wyatt sighed, and Bill buzzed Justin to return to the office.\n\n\nBill wanted Justin to initiate a restraining order against Quinn, but Justin said he needed Wyatt's permission. Wyatt was leery of doing it. Bill said the restraining order wasn't permanent, and it would give Quinn a chance to show that she could play by the rules. Figuring that he probably couldn't get through to Quinn any other way, Wyatt gave Justin permission to start the order immediately.\n\n\nWyatt flashed back on a conversation he'd had with Hope about keeping Quinn away. He looked worried and asked Bill what would happen if Quinn wouldn't stay away. Bill hoped that Quinn had learned more self-control than they gave her credit for. Wyatt said he was doing it for Hope and to be a good husband. Bill said that Wyatt was a good husband and son, and he hugged Wyatt. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam accuses Quinn of lying about being at the shower and he wants her to admit it. She says he is the one being relentless. He's like a dog with a bone. She's been treated like a pariah and not the doting grandmother that she really is. This baby changes everything. She will never be a threat again. Liam says yes she will as long as she insinuates herself where she is not wanted and Quinn will never be free of him protecting Hope. Justin advises Bill just to fly to Milan and drag Brooke home. Bill says he is not that kind of cave man. Wyatt interrupts. Bill pours him a drink and asks about Hope. Wyatt asks him about baby showers with girls only and men not allowed. Bill says that is not what he is there for. Wyatt admits it is about his mom. She is shacking up with Deacon for one thing. But he feels bad cutting her out of his life with his first child and all. He has taken steps but nothing ever works. Bill says he must take a stand as this kind of stress is not good for Hope or the baby either. He calls Justin. Hope tells Ivy that she knows her relationship has gotten a lot closer with Liam and they both have told each other they love each other. She says she is committed to her family and to Wyatt and this child, so all of these might have beens rolling around in her head don't help. Liam calls Ivy and checks about the cake and is certain that the one he is looking at is one Quinn lurked around at the party and then took as a souvenir. She vows again she just wants to be part of the family and nothing more. He says she almost sounds sincere but he knows it is only because she is caught. It won't change anything. She keeps stalking Hope. She keeps insinuating herself into Hope's life. Just know this as long as she is a threat to Hope's happiness that Quinn will never be free of Liam. He says and just wait until Hope hears about this. Quinn tells him to stop with all the negativity to Hope. She shouts that she is a mother and grandmother and does not want to be ostracized from the family that means the world to her. Can't they all just come together for everyone's sake? He says he and Hope do not believe one word that comes out of her mouth as she will say anything to get what she wants. She says all she wants is to put her family together. He says maybe but they would be better off without her as she has impulse issues and is unbalanced. He feels really sorry for her son. She says Hope and Wyatt have moved on but Liam can't or won't. He says moving on does not mean that he doesn't look out for Hope or care for her and yes even love her. If it weren't for Quinn he would be married to her right now. And yes Bill meddled with him and Hope but he learned from it. Quinn is not sorry until she gets caught. He threatens that he has always felt she was a danger to Hope and if she does it again she will have to deal with him. Wyatt is a little reluctant but finally comes around when Bill has Justin draw up a restraining order for Quinn. He agrees that is the only way as he can not get through to her. He says he is doing it for Hope as that is what a good husband does. Bill hugs him and says he is a good husband and son too. Liam calls Hope and asks her to meet him. It's about Quinn and important. Hope suggests Brooke's house since she is out of town. When he tells her that he has no proof but he went to Quinn's and she had a piece of cake just like Ivy said they had at the shower, Hope panics. Liam tells her she should not have to live her life looking over her shoulder and he wants her to know he will never stop caring about her.",
