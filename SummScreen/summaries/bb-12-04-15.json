    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the design room, Thomas noted that Quinn was pushing hard to match-make Wyatt and Steffy. Quinn disagreed and called herself an observant mother. Quinn thought the relationship Wyatt had with Ivy was tolerable, but Wyatt would be a better fit for Steffy.\n\n\nPam arrived, looking for Ridge or Steffy. Pam relayed that Jake had messaged her about the backstage electrical system being on fire. Just then, Pam received a message that Jake had reached Steffy, and Pam told Quinn and Thomas that they could carry on.\n\n\nPam left, and Thomas asked Quinn to say she hadn't started the electrical fire. Quinn grimaced, and he said he'd heard the stories. She replied that she was reformed, but Thomas said he'd heard the stories about Liam. Quinn stated that Liam was as annoying as hell, but she wasn't starting any fires around him. \"Stabbing attempts, though,\" Thomas said, and she guessed he'd done his homework.\n\n\nQuinn had no ill will toward the \"rescue ranger.\" In her view, Steffy wasn't one of those women who needed to be saved normally -- except from Liam. Thomas figured Quinn thought Wyatt was the man for the job, and if things didn't work out for Ivy and Wyatt, Quinn might get her wish.\n\n\nAt the CEO's office, Liam was upset that Steffy had told Wyatt about Thomas and Ivy. Steffy hadn't wanted to be the one to do it, but because she believed that Ivy wouldn't do it, Steffy had felt that she'd had no choice. Liam exclaimed that Steffy had known how important it was to him, she hadn't given Ivy the chance, and Steffy had done the opposite of what he'd told her to do.\n\n\nSteffy had thought Liam would trust her judgment. Liam countered that he'd thought she'd trust his. Liam had been with Ivy, who'd been preparing to confess. He was sure that Wyatt would go home and toss Ivy out, and it wasn't fair that Steffy had robbed Ivy of the chance to tell Wyatt gently and in her own way. \"Why did you have to interfere?\" Liam grumbled.\n\n\nBackstage later, Steffy and Liam had arrived to talk to Jake and the maintenance man as they descended the steps of a raised landing on which a tall bundle of sizzling wires sat. The maintenance man didn't know what the issue was, but while he and Jake went to switch off the main breaker, he asked Liam and Steffy to make sure no one got near the wiring.\n\n\nThe men left, and Steffy joked about her and Liam guarding the shorted-out electrical board. She said they had electricity between them even when he was mad at her.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy resumed arguing, but when the power went out for a moment, Steffy joked that it could have been their moment. Liam wanted Steffy to stop playing around. Steffy said that Ivy didn't need protecting, and Steffy had tried to avoid telling Wyatt, who'd managed to pull it out of her. The lights flickered again, and Steffy asked if it should have happened.\n\n\nLiam replied that none of it should have happened, and he'd thought Steffy had been done with all the animosity. Steffy replied that she was trying to be, and she'd only done what she'd thought was right. Liam stated that he knew it, and she asked if he'd forgive her. He said it wasn't he who needed to; it was Ivy and Wyatt. Liam asked Steffy to leave the situation alone and stay away from Ivy.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Ivy pleaded with Wyatt not to let the kisses with Thomas ruin their relationship. She said she hadn't given up on them, and the kisses hadn't even been about them. Wyatt replied that if she believed that, then he never even knew her. Ivy said she was freaking out, trying to figure out how to make it work. Wyatt asked her why she'd turned to Thomas.\n\n\nWyatt didn't know why Ivy would look twice at Thomas -- or any man -- if she loved Wyatt as she'd said she did. Ivy didn't know what to say. She admitted that there had been an attraction. Wyatt raged that Thomas was good-looking, as was any model around the job; however, Wyatt thought he'd been in a committed relationship, which meant that he didn't let attractions dictate his choices.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Ivy knew what he'd been saying to his mother while Ivy had been making out with \"Mr. Abs.\" He said he'd told his mother that he'd trusted the loyal and devoted Ivy, who'd been good to him. Ivy claimed to still be that person, but she'd just been a little lost.\n\n\nWyatt guessed that being lost wasn't hard for Ivy, who'd used that excuse for the blackmail after Aly's death. He figured that there was more, and Ivy admitted that there had been other kisses. The seething Wyatt asked if she really wanted to be with an entitled, spoiled brat who just wanted to sleep around and have one-night stands.\n\n\nIvy declared that she didn't want to be with Thomas. She said she was in love with Wyatt, and she needed to know what to do. She wanted him to trust that it wouldn't happen again, but Wyatt thought she'd used the wrong word choice. Ivy said she wanted to deserve his trust again.\n\n\nWyatt couldn't believe he'd been gone for one night, and Ivy had turned to Thomas. Wyatt said she was asking him to constantly worry that a man would say one nice thing to her, and it would get her into bed. Ivy objected, but he continued, saying he'd thought she'd wanted a relationship with honesty. He recalled that she'd laughed off his concern, as if she'd had no interest in Thomas.\n\n\nIvy claimed that she hadn't realized the appeal yet. Wyatt couldn't believe he'd had to find out from Steffy. Ivy became outraged because she'd told Steffy to stay out of it and not say anything. He asked if Ivy was seriously upset with Steffy. Ivy replied that it hadn't been Steffy's business, and he'd needed to hear it from Ivy first.\n\n\nWyatt asserted that Steffy was his friend, who'd been looking out for him. Ivy called Steffy's actions self-serving. Ivy believed that Steffy didn't like her and had told Wyatt to prevent Ivy from revealing the issue in the right way. Ivy asked him not to let Steffy win by ending things end because of her. Wyatt replied that Steffy wasn't the cause; Ivy was.\n\n\nWyatt refused to share Ivy with another man or to wonder who she'd be thinking about when she was with him. Ivy declared that it wouldn't happen. \"If you want Thomas, you got him!\" Wyatt concluded and stormed out of the house.\n\n\nSometime later, Wyatt returned to talk to Ivy more, but she wasn't there. He flashed back on their time together as he sat down to wait for her.\n\n\nAt Pam's desk later, Ivy asked where Steffy was. Pam stated that Steffy was backstage, dealing with an electrical malfunction. Ivy said that if anyone needed her, she'd be dealing with Steffy's personality malfunction.\n\n\nWhen Ivy arrived backstage, Steffy was text-messaging Liam about whether Jake had found the breaker. Ivy figured Steffy was plotting to break up someone else and said Steffy had only told Wyatt to hurt Ivy. Steffy said she'd only done what she'd thought was right, and she'd had to tell Wyatt the truth. Ivy argued that it had been Steffy's twisted version of it, and Wyatt had walked out on Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy said she was sorry, but the responsibility was on Ivy. Ivy figured Steffy hadn't been able to wait to blab to Wyatt. Steffy decided to leave, but Ivy continued to argue as they passed by the steps to the electrical landing. Steffy told Ivy that it was on her, and she couldn't blame Steffy.\n\n\nIvy grabbed Steffy's elbow. Snatching it back, Steffy instructed Ivy to unhand her. Steffy said that Ivy had done the cheating and needed to take responsibility. Steffy and Ivy talked over each other as Steffy checked her phone. Ivy grabbed it and tossed it through the rails guarding the tall bundle of popping wires. The phone slid beneath the wires on the landing.\n\n\nOutraged, Steffy climbed the steps to the landing and bent over to retrieve the phone from beneath the bundle of wires. Ivy followed and grabbed Steffy's arm. Steffy snatched herself away and inadvertently knocked Ivy into the sizzling wires. Horrified, Steffy watched Ivy get electrocuted for several moments. Motionless, Ivy slid down to the floor, and Steffy screamed for help.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam is devastated that Steffy told Wyatt. She said she had no intention but she had no choice. Liam said she did not give Ivy the chance to tell Wyatt on her own terms. It was Ivy's business to tell and now Wyatt is coming home and will probably toss her out on her ass. She had no right to interfere. Ivy tells Wyatt that Thomas had nothing to do with them. She is trying to find the right words to fix this but he won't let her try. He is important to her and she wants it to work. He still grills her why she turned to Thomas. They were in a committed relationship and he said he trusted Ivy and how devoted she was to him so he can not buy this that she was lost and could not fight the attraction. She cheated on him with Thomas. He goes berserk that she had more kisses with that spoiled little brat that hits on every female within sight. He does not have the answer to what Ivy can do now. Thomas tells Quinn that she is pushing hard being the matchmaker between Wyatt and Steffy. She says nothing against Liam but Wyatt would be a better fit. Pam rushes in and informs them there is an electrical fire backstage. She returns to her thoughts that Liam needs to be rescued from Steffy and Wyatt is just the man to do it. Jake goes with the repairman to look at the problem. Liam and Steffy happen along and they stay while Jake goes to show the repairman where the breakers are. Ivy says if she could take this back she would, but she can't. She says she hates that she hurt him and would do anything to make it right. She wants to deserve his trust. He says she should not even use the word trust around him. She always laughed it off about Thomas every time they talked. And he was only gone one night and she cheated on him. Ivy is disgusted that Steffy feels it was her duty to tell him. He tells her that if she wants Thomas, then she has him. He is not going to look over his shoulder and wonder about her every time Thomas or any new man comes into view. Steffy tells Liam that she just did what she thought was right. He is not asking for forgiveness; it is Ivy and Wyatt that is suffering. He wants her to do him a favor \u0096 just let the situation play out without doing or inciting the situation further. And in the meantime stay away from Ivy. Wyatt had taken a walk and finds Ivy gone when he gets home. Ivy makes a beeline to the office to have it out with Steffy. She hears about the electrical malfunction and heads there as the electricity zaps overhead. She finds Steffy and blasts her for telling Wyatt and twisting the truth and he has now walked out on her. Steffy tells her this is not about her; this is about Wyatt. Ivy betrayed him, not her. Steffy walks away and Ivy grabs her. Steffy shakes loose and tells her to get her hands off of her. Ivy takes Steffy's phone and throws it into the tangled wires. Steffy goes to retrieve it and Ivy is pushed and falls into it, electrocuted. Steffy cries for help.",
