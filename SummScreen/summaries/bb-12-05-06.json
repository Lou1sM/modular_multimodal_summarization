    "imdb": "\nThorne is happy to have Taylor back. He impresses her by generously, without any grudge, offering to Hector to look after his Malibu beach house. Eric and Stefanie arrive in Lake Forrest, where Ann acts all innocent, praising her late husband. Eric stops her from retiring for the night, insisting she must hear why Stefanie told the grandchildren she's dead.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tries to comfort a nervous Stephanie. She maintains again that she thought she had good reason to tell everyone her mother was dead. It hurt her as a child that her mother turned a deaf ear to her pleas for help with her abusive father. Taylor and Thorne kiss and can't keep their hands off each other. In Chicago, Ann fusses around the apartment trying to make everything just right for Stephanie's visit. She plays her favorite album with Doris Day's Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be). Stephanie remembers too her childhood, hearing that song constantly and remarks that her childhood wasn't that terrible. Her mother was always there and loved and treated both her and Pammie the same. And now she is an old woman, so what is there to be afraid of? Eric tries to be optimistic that maybe she has changed. Stephanie doubts it, she was always controlling and in control of her emotions. She's just afraid she is going to be so cheerful in that pathetic, vacant sort of way and just deny everything. Hector tells Taylor and Thorne that he is getting out of her life. He realizes he has caused her some real problems. Thorne offers his Malibu place for free. Hector will be doing him a favor by looking after a vacant place. The song is still playing when they arrive at the apartment and her mother welcomes her cheerfully. They spend the next few awkward moments with her mother chirping like a bird, extolling all the happy memories of her sweet little perfect family. She laments that it's funny they go thirty years without seeing each other and then pick right up where they left off. She serves the chocolate angel cake, ordering Pammie to go get honey for Stephanie's tea, although Stephanie says she doesn't want any. Then she remarks that she doesn't know why they want to live in L.A. where it is so hot and with actresses and actors and all those insincere people. She'd like to have some photos of her grandchildren and is shocked when Stephanie tells her that she told them her mother was dead. When she tries to tell her there are issues they need to discuss, her mother says she wouldn't know about that. Things are very simple around here. She says she tires much more than she used to and says it was good to see Stephanie but pretty much dismisses her daughter. Again, she sweetly asks Pammie to go turn on her electric blanket. .she likes it nice and cozy. Stephanie says she likes everything nice and cozy, but that isn't the way life is. Ann says life is what you make it. Stephanie says Que Sera Sera. Ann tells Eric it was good to see him and take care of her daughter. She starts to leave but he holds her back. He tells her that her daughter has something to say and she's going to hear her whether she wants to or not.",
