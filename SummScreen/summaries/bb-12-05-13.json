    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Spencer, Hope stopped by Liam's office and encountered Katie, who notified Hope that Liam had left for the day. Hope assumed that Liam wasn't too happy with her, and Katie replied that he was hanging in there but losing patience.\n\n\nHope claimed to not know what to do about it, and Katie noted that Hope had been spending a lot of time with Wyatt. Hope said it was just for work, and Liam understood that, after what he'd put her through with Steffy, Hope needed time for herself.\n\n\nKatie was proud of Hope's accomplishments and remarked that her line was number one in Hope's demographic. Hope conveyed that she liked where her life was, and though she loved Liam, she liked putting herself first. Hope credited Wyatt for some of her success and added that Aly was also on board, making it an exciting time at Forrester.\n\n\nHope praised Aly, whom Hope called her loyal shadow. After assuming that Aly hadn't done much dating, Hope said she looked forward to helping Aly out of her shell. Hope revealed that Aly could speak her mind and had expressed her concern that Hope was stringing Liam along. Hope stated that Aly had been cute about it but probably too young to understand what was going on.\n\n\nKatie, however, said that Aly just might have a point. Katie noted that Hope had wanted to marry Liam for a long time, and nothing was standing in their way. Hope remarked that Wyatt cared about her, and he was fun and gorgeous -- without the Steffy baggage. Hope wondered what was wrong with enjoying spending time with him. \"But do you love him?\" Katie asked.\n\n\nKatie wondered if Hope could see herself married to Wyatt. Hope was unsure that she wanted to marry anyone at the moment. Hope claimed that she wasn't out to punish Liam, but she didn't think that patience was too much to ask for. Katie said that it was about balance. Using herself as an example, Katie cited that, even though she had her career and son, she was lonely.\n\n\nKatie figured that it was easy to be drawn to the newness and excitement of Wyatt, but \"at what price?\" She relayed that Liam was struggling, and she didn't want to see Hope lose him. Taken aback, Hope doubted that it would get to that point. She reasoned that she and Liam might still get married, and he'd be okay with giving her the time she needed.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Liam looked at the picture that he'd received of Wyatt and Hope and flashed back to the troubles he'd had with Wyatt kissing her at other times. Aly arrived. She assumed that Liam had gotten the photo, and he replied that he'd been looking at it -- again.\n\n\nAly apologized for sending it. She felt that it had been wrong of her to get involved; however, Liam was a good guy who'd had a right to know. She asked if her concern weirded him out. He replied that the only person who did that was his brother. \"Half-brother,\" Aly corrected, and Liam chuckled.\n\n\nLiam said Hope had made it clear that she wasn't in a commitment, which meant that she could do what she wanted. He also noted that Wyatt had kissed Hope other times -- and even in Liam's house. Liam stated that Hope was enjoying the attention, but there was only so much a committed man could take. \"Something's gotta give, right?\" he asked.\n\n\nAly wasn't surprised that the men were fighting over Hope. She remarked that Hope had always been good to her, and Hope was a wonderful role model.\n\n\nAs Aly mentioned seeing pictures of the Italy wedding, Liam received a text message from a buddy of his who had to cancel on their tennis match that afternoon. Aly offered to hit with Liam, but he remarked that playing with a guy might be too intense for her. Unconcerned about that, Aly replied that she had workout clothes in the car, and Liam agreed to meet her on the court.\n\n\nWhen Liam and Aly met on the court later, Aly warned that she might be rusty. Liam served her the ball several times, but she missed them all. He suggested that she serve, and Aly began serving him balls that he couldn't hit back. Liam figured out that she'd hustled him about her ability, and he playfully declared that he quit.\n\n\nOn the overlook after the game, Aly apologized again for sending Liam the photo. She said that he was sweet and funny, and most guys weren't like him. \"If I was Hope...\" Aly started to say. Bashfully, she asked him to forget she'd said anything. Liam told her that it was forgotten, and she stared at him as he gazed out to the ocean.\n\n\nAt the sky lounge, Wyatt showed his mother the pictures from the photo shoot. Seeing the kiss photo, Quinn said Wyatt knew how to work it. She believed he was much better suited for Hope, and she urged him not to give up. Wyatt said Liam had to accept that Wyatt wouldn't go anywhere.\n\n\nQuinn remarked upon Bill and Liam's displeasure upon seeing her and Wyatt on Thanksgiving. Wyatt expressed his delight about seeing his parents sitting together at the table for the first time, but Quinn quipped that it wouldn't happen again. She remarked that Hope had thrown together a special holiday dinner, and Wyatt replied that everything Hope did was special.\n\n\nQuinn felt that the Forrester Thanksgiving had been a defining moment for her and Wyatt, and she said they couldn't lose their opportunity. Wyatt wondered how that would happen. He stated that they were only just beginning, and there was no limit to where they could go from there.\n\n\nQuinn said that Liam didn't see it that way, and Wyatt launched into a tirade about the way Liam \"saw\" things. Wyatt said Liam couldn't believe that Hope wasn't bending over backwards to marry him. Quinn and Wyatt agreed that Liam wasn't good for Hope, and Wyatt added that Hope would have already walked down the aisle if she'd thought otherwise.\n\n\nQuinn guessed that the Steffy video had put an end to the wedding plans. Wyatt felt strongly that Hope wasn't ready -- at least where Liam was concerned. Quinn complained about Liam's impatience. Wyatt said that Hope needed time, but he was beginning to think his decision to play it cool with Hope might be a mistake.\n\n\nWyatt flashed back on the times he'd shared with Hope. He decided that he needed to make a move, but he also wanted to respect Hope's feelings. Quinn replied that no one got anywhere without taking risks and being proactive.\n\n\nWyatt decided that he needed to plan something romantic and meaningful to show Hope how he felt about her. He recalled that she still talked about the Mexico trip, so he figured that he needed to do something just as big and memorable for him and Hope. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope drops in at Liam's office but only finds Katie. She says she thinks Liam left for the day. Aly drops by unannounced at Liam's Malibu house. He invites her in and she immediately apologizes for sending him the photo. She says she realized it was a big mistake the minute she sent it. It was so totally not her business. She just thinks he is such a good guy and knows how much he loves Hope and thought he should know. She hopes he is not too weirded out. He retorts that the only one he is weirded by is his brother. She corrects \u0096 half brother. Quinn and Wyatt are taking a break on the rooftop at FC. Wyatt is looking through the pictures from the photo shoot and commenting on how gorgeous Hope is. Quinn agrees and says he is so much better for Hope than Liam. Wyatt just needs to be patient and she will see this, so don't give up on Hope. Wyatt says Liam will just have to accept that he isn't going anywhere. Quinn replies that he certainly wasn't too pleased that they were invited to Thanksgiving dinner. And she adds neither was Bill for that matter. Wyatt says oh, he thought it kind of nice that he was seeing his parents at the same table for the first time. She says and that will be the first and last time. He is oddly okay with that. Quinn tells him that Hope created a very special evening. Wyatt comments that everything Hope does is special. Quinn says he feels good in the position they are in now. She feels they are in a unique place with their business expanding and their lives have changed. They can not lose this opportunity. Wyatt says why would they? They are just getting the ball rolling. There is no limit where the two of them can go from here. Katie tells Hope that she had a talk with Liam earlier and it seems he is getting a little impatient. Hope says she knows, she feels badly but she doesn't know what to do. Katie points out that she has been spending a lot of time with Wyatt. Hope puts that more in the work category. Katie says she thinks Liam sees if differently. Hope says she has been completely honest with Liam. She wants to focus on her work. She needs that time especially after all he put her through with Steffy. And she thinks that deep down Liam knows that too. With her line doing so well it would be foolish to give that up. She likes her life right now and thinking of herself first. She has to give some credit to Wyatt too and now Aly is on board, her little shadow who is so sweet. Hope says Aly is shy and she doesn't think she has dated much, so she'd like to show her around and have some fun and help bring her out of her shell. She does speak her mind though. She had told Hope that she thought she was stringing Liam along and knew that Wyatt was really into her. So just how long was she going to wait before marrying Liam. Hope says she tried to explain but she didn't think she was old enough or experienced enough to understand. Katie says don't get her wrong. She likes both Wyatt and Liam a lot, but she's been with Liam for so long and wanted to get married for a long time. Now she can; Steffy is gone. There is nothing standing in the way. Hope tells Katie that Wyatt cares about her. He's spontaneous and gorgeous and has no Steffy baggage. He's fun and she likes being with him so tell her what is wrong with that. Katie says nothing but does she love him or ever see herself married to him. Hope says she is not sure she wants to marry anyone right now. She was ready a few times and Liam wasn't. She's not trying to hurt him now or punish him, but she doesn't think it is asking too much to have a little patience. Katie responds that life is about balance. She has Will and this company but she is lonely. She knows it is exciting being with Wyatt but Liam is struggling and she doesn't want to see her lose him. Hope says she doesn't think it will come to that. Maybe they will get married but in the meanwhile Liam will be okay. She thinks he will understand and be willing to wait until she is ready. Liam confides in Aly that Hope has made it clear they are not in a committed relationship so she can pretty well do what she wants. She says when she saw Wyatt kissing Hope she over re-acted. Liam says please don't give it another thought. And that kiss wasn't the first one. Wyatt has done it a lot .once right there and he punched him. Aly says she is not surprised that they'd be fighting over Hope, she is amazing. He agrees and adds that he is 100% committed but there is only so much a guy can take and something has got to give. He gets a text that a buddy can't make it over to hit a few balls. He's been trying to improve his tennis game as it relieves a little stress. Aly volunteers that she can help hit him a few. He declines and says it really needs to be a guy hitting some pretty intense balls out there. She says she has clothes out in the car so they should go for it. He finally agrees and says he will meet her out on the court. Liam starts with some fairly easy lobs across the net. Aly misses a lot of them and he keeps saying it is okay. Then he lets her serve. Within a minute she is whizzing them past him. He goes to the net and says he is being hustled. He chuckles while throwing the racket down and says he is finished; he has been hustled. Wyatt tells Quinn that Liam is living up there in his big old mansion and he's used to getting everything that he wants. But Hope has said she is not ready so Wyatt is not being too pushy but he is starting to think that might be a big mistake. He needs to do something. He wants to be respectful of Hope's feelings but he can't just sit by and not do anything especially while Liam is pouting. Quinn says that Wyatt knows her motto. You don't get anywhere in life if you don't take risks or be proactive. You have to go after what you want. He says he wants Hope. There is nothing he is more sure of. He just has to figure it out. He needs to plan something special and romantic and memorable for Hope like when he took her to Mexico for the diamond. Aly brings up the picture again. She says Liam is so sweet and funny .most guys aren't like him. She starts to say if she were Hope .then she stops and says forget everything she said. Liam chuckles and says it is forgotten. He looks out over the water and she just stares at his profile.",
