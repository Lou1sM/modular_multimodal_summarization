She murmured that the picture was the closest she'd get to the child. He figured it was the closest anyone would get, since it hadn't been born yet.\n\n\nDeacon said Liam had been there, relaying his suspicion that Quinn had crashed Hope's shower. Quinn revealed that Liam had questioned her, too. Deacon asked if Liam had been right.\n\n\nDeacon assumed Quinn had been there, and Hope had thrown her out. Quinn asserted that Hope hadn't, but she kept evading the question of where she'd been. Deacon believed that she'd been there, looking through the windows or doing something else creepy.\n\n\nQuinn denied stooping so low. Deacon asked if she understood how counterproductive it was. She blamed her plight on Liam, the puppy dog who followed Hope around. Quinn wanted to wring Liam's neck. Deacon said that kind of talk would get her a \"fifty-one/fifty\" again. She pleaded with Deacon to talk to Hope again on her behalf, and he begrudgingly agreed.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Hope was disconcerted by Liam's suspicion that Quinn had been at the baby shower. Liam said he was considering hiring a bodyguard for Hope. Hope wanted Liam to be careful about going to Quinn's house because, out of everyone, Quinn hated him the most. Liam insisted that Hope was the one who had to be careful, and Hope thoughtfully touched his hand.\n\n\nDeacon called Hope, but Hope claimed not to have time to talk. He asked where she was. She said she was at her mother's house with Liam, but she'd try to call Deacon later that night.\n\n\nAfter the call, Liam warned Hope to be careful of what she told Deacon, who lived with Quinn. Liam stated that she couldn't take anything for granted. He advised her not to confront Quinn and to just leave Quinn to him. Hope decided that there was one thing she could take for granted, and it was Liam, who'd always be there for her. He added that he always had been.\n\n\nHope and Liam hugged, and Liam stated that the baby was all that mattered. He wanted Hope to take care of the baby while he took care of Quinn. Hope thanked him, and he left.\n\n\nBack at the loft, Quinn anxiously asked Deacon if he'd set up a meeting with Hope. Deacon said Hope hadn't been able to talk at the time. Quinn quizzed him on what Hope had been doing until she gleaned that Hope was at Brooke's house with Liam. Quinn went off about Liam, the snit, who was around whenever Wyatt turned his back.\n\n\nDeacon assured Quinn that he'd talk to Hope, and they had months until the child was born to work things out. Quinn figured that he was right, and she was overreacting. She decided that she'd continue to do nice things for Hope, but Deacon said Quinn was going to do nothing.\n\n\nDeacon asked if Quinn understood that Hope's biggest fear was Quinn stalking her. He wanted Quinn to show Hope that she'd respect Hope's privacy. Quinn agreed to do it, and he hugged her.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill told Wyatt that Justin was on his way back with the restraining order. Wyatt was antsy about it, but Bill said Wyatt had told Quinn a number of times to back off. Wyatt stated that his mother just wanted to be a part of the family. Bill asked if Wyatt could blame Hope for not wanting that.\n\n\nWyatt wished Quinn had just backed off for a while, because to him, the restraining order was extreme. Bill asked for a solution other than letting Hope live in extreme terror. Bill emphasized that Hope needed protection. \"Even if it is from my own mother. Great,\" Wyatt added.\n\n\nLater, Justin arrived with the month-long restraining order. He noted that it wouldn't take effect until Wyatt served it to Quinn. Wyatt said he'd do it right then. Bill advised Wyatt to serve Quinn and leave -- no discussion. Wyatt said he had to help Quinn digest the shock of it. \"No, you really don't,\" Bill replied and asked Wyatt to call if he needed moral support.\n\n\nDuring Wyatt's car ride, Wyatt stared at the papers beside him. He turned on the radio, and a song with the lyrics, \"H-O-T-T, hotter than that,\" played. He flashed back on all his times with Hope.\n\n\nWhen Wyatt arrived at the loft, Quinn wasn't there. Deacon said that Quinn had been in the warehouse, hammering out jewelry for Wyatt's wife, because Quinn wanted to play nice. Wyatt replied that it was too late for it, and Quinn couldn't get her way by harassing Hope. Deacon scoffed at the word \"harassing.\" Standing by it, Wyatt said Quinn needed to stay away from Hope -- \"at least for now.\"\n\n\nWyatt decided to go to the warehouse, but Deacon, who'd already checked, said Quinn wasn't there. He assumed that she'd gone out for coffee and asked why Wyatt wanted to talk to her. \"I don't suppose it has anything to do with the envelope in your hands, does it?\" Deacon asked.\n\n\nWyatt said that he was serving Quinn a restraining order to keep her away from Hope. Deacon asked if Wyatt was serious, and Wyatt insisted that Quinn didn't listen. \"So you went to a judge? Come on, man. It's your mother,\" Deacon replied.\n\n\nWyatt countered that Hope was his wife and Deacon's daughter, and Hope was also scared because Quinn wouldn't let up. Deacon said Quinn had promised to give Hope space and asked Wyatt to give him a little more time. \"For what? You don't even know where she is!\" Wyatt replied.\n\n\nLater, Liam rushed into Bill's office, and Bill wondered if Liam had been absent because of a holiday that Bill wasn't aware of. Liam apprised Bill of Liam's investigation into Quinn and the baby shower cake. \"What is this? Cakegate?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nLiam said he wanted Quinn out of Hope's life. Bill informed Liam that he was about to get his wish because Wyatt was on his way to hand Quinn a restraining order. Liam figured that it wouldn't be fun for Wyatt. Bill agreed but said Wyatt understood that it had to be done.\n\n\nAssuming that Liam had missed work because of Hope, Bill asked Liam how she was. Liam said she needed a lot of support, but Bill contended that she had a husband. Liam responded that, being her friend, he wouldn't abandon her as long as \"Eva Braun\" was on the loose.\n\n\nWyatt called Bill to say that Quinn wasn't at the warehouse. Bill told Wyatt to wait for Quinn and report how it went later.\n\n\nHaving overheard the call, Liam practically flew out of the office. From his car, Liam left Hope a voicemail to warn her that Quinn might be on her way there.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house later, Hope gasped upon seeing Quinn on the doorstep. Quinn wanted to talk, but Hope tried to close the door on her. Quinn made her way inside as Hope asked what Quinn didn't understand about staying away.\n\n\nQuinn knew that the problem was Liam, who hated her for the regrettable things she'd done. Hope asked if Liam was right about Quinn and the shower. Quinn hesitated, and Hope screamed, \"Oh, my God! How did you even get into Eric's house?\" Quinn admitted to sneaking in and watching the party from the staircase. Hope cringed, but Quinn asked how she could miss her first grandchild's shower.\n\n\nHope yelled that Quinn hadn't deserved to be there due to the things she'd done. Quinn quibbled that she'd just wanted to see the presents and said Hope had looked very happy. Hope ordered Quinn to stop it, but Quinn said she wanted to show that she had a heart and some restraint. Hope quipped that Quinn obviously had no restraint, but Quinn said it was exactly why she was there.\n\n\nHope declared that Quinn was a threat to Hope, her family, and her baby. Hope ordered Quinn out of her house. Quinn promised to leave after she said one last thing. \"No! Damn it!\" Hope roared.\n\n\n\"Please, please, please!\" Quinn persisted. Hope demanded that Quinn get off Hope's property. Quinn asked Hope to calm down and decided it would be better if they talked outside in the garden. Hope asked what Quinn was thinking, but Quinn had already pranced out the terrace doors. \"God!\" Hope screamed, storming after Quinn.\n\n\nPursuing Quinn down the outside stairs near the fountains, Hope threatened to call the police to report Quinn's trespassing. Quinn calmly said that she wanted to tell Hope that she wasn't going to bother Hope anymore. \"You came here to tell me that,\" Hope pointed out.\n\n\nClaiming to be sincere, Quinn said she'd promised Deacon. Hope reasoned that Quinn could have called or sent a message -- from a safe distance. Hope cut herself off and decided to just thank Quinn. \"I've heard you. Thank you very much. You can go now. You may leave. Please leave,\" Hope stated, making shooing motions with her hands.\n\n\nAs Quinn ascended the stairs, Hope sat on a concrete planter at the top of the long staircase with fountain tiers flowing down the middle of it. Hope sighed and stood up. Her high heel twisted, and she fell, tumbling down possibly twenty-five feet of concrete steps before her head slapped against a platform in the center of the staircase.\n\n\nQuinn heard Hope gasp. She rushed to the railing and saw Hope splayed out on the platform below. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Despite Hope knowing that Quinn was at the baby shower, Liam sits Hope down and says he is not going to let Quinn anywhere near her. She thinks that is so weird; where was Quinn? Liam says he is thinking about hiring someone, some security as he is not going to let Quinn stalk her and right now that is exactly what she is doing. Quinn is looking at the ultrasound and tells Deacon that is as close as she is going to get to that child. Deacon says Liam was here and accusing her of being at the shower. Quinn does not want to be questioned but she does beg Deacon to please talk to Hope. She just wants to be part of that family. Deacon says he will do what he can. Wyatt tells Bill that he wishes there was some other way than the restraining order for Quinn. Bill says she doesn't have to like it, but she does have to accept it. Patience is not her strong suit .nor Bill's. Wyatt says that must be where he gets his from. He just wants to fix this. He can't let his wife live in terror like this. Bill says no, it is not good for a pregnant woman or the baby either. Hope tells Liam that she appreciates his caring about her and wanting to help, but confronting Quinn at her place was not the smartest thing he might do. He says he knows but he does not want to see Hope hurt. Deacon calls but Hope says she is with Liam and can't talk now. Liam tells her that Deacon is living with Quinn so she can't tell him too much. He makes her promise that she won't try to confront Quinn by herself. Right now all that matters is that she is left alone and has a healthy baby. He will take care of Quinn. Quinn gets it out of Deacon that he called Hope but she had company and it probably was Liam. Deacon warns her to stay away from Hope until that baby is born. She has to show Hope she respects her privacy. Justin gives the restraining order to Wyatt, a 30 days one and it is not effective until he serves it to Quinn. Bill tells him to give it to her and leave, no discussion. Hope puts her jacket on, picks up her purse and is about to leave. At the front door stand Quinn with those big innocent eyes. Liam goes to Bill and complains about Quinn being at CakeGate. Bill informs him he just might get his wish as Justin has given papers to Wyatt and he is delivering them as they speak. Wyatt only finds Deacon at Quinn's. Deacon is evasive but finally admits that Quinn is not there. Wyatt explains that he will find out soon enough, but he is serving a restraining order on Quinn. Hope tries to close the door on Quinn, but Quinn begs her just for a minute for her to explain. She walks on in and says she knows it is Liam. She has done some very regrettable things. Hope is in an outrage when she realizes that Quinn was at the baby shower spying on them, after sneaking into Eric's house somehow. Quinn is frantic that Hope understands and will let her show her that she does have a heart and restraint. Hope gets more agitated that Quinn can even use that word restraint when she can not obey the simple fact that neither she nor Wyatt want to see her. Three times she asks Quinn to leave her house. Quinn still wants to explain and says perhaps they should go out in the garden and discuss this more. She heads that way and Hope follows. Wyatt calls Bill and says he tried to serve the papers but Quinn was not home. Bill tells him to wait for her. As soon as Liam hears Quinn is not at home, he makes a mad dash for the door. He tries to call Hope to warn her but just gets voicemail. He leaves a message to watch her back, Quinn may be coming. Hope follows Quinn and tells her to leave the property. Quinn says Hope needs to calm down so they can have a rational conversation. She just wants her to know she will not bother her anymore. Hope says she could have phoned that to her or e-mailed, but okay thank you, now she knows and can go. Quinn walks away, Hope sits down for about 20 seconds and gets up to go back in the house when her high heeled shoe sticks in a concrete crack and she tumbles all the way down a flight of concrete stairs and lands hitting her head at the bottom. She lays unconscious. Quinn turns around to see this and calls out Hope's name.",
