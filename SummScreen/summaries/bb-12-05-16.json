    "imdb": "Steffy is suspicious of the motive behind Quinn's request for her to serve as CEO of Forrester Creations. Quinn admits that she still wants Steffy and Wyatt together, yet claims that this has no bearing on the soundness of her idea. Quinn leaves to inform Eric of her suggestion. He agrees that Steffy running the company could have healthy effects on both business as well as her marriage to Wyatt. Downstairs, Wyatt encourages Steffy to not miss out on this amazing opportunity because of her personal feelings for his mother. Eric joins them and confirms that Quinn has no interest in being permanent CEO, and neither does he. They both believe Steffy is the right person to do it. Steffy is honored, but is worried about Ridge, Rick and Thorne. Eric reassures her. Zende stops by at the Cliff House and congratulates Liam on his getting back together with Steffy. Brooke arrives home to find Ridge holding a rose and petals all over the candlelit bedroom. After they make love, Brooke and Ridge make plans for their future.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke and Ridge kiss and he tells her that he missed her. He thinks they need to get out of here. She says he has work to do; he replies he certainly does. He needs her house key to give him a head start. Quinn tells a surprised Steffy that she is the only viable person to carry on her granddad's legacy and she should be CEO. Eric tells Wyatt do not give up on Steffy. Zende congratulates Liam for being back together with Steffy. He just wishes it were that easy with him and Nicole. Steffy stays and runs into Wyatt. She says Quinn is persistent if nothing else. He quips about her ring tattoo and says that he figured his would be faded and gone too after about 50 years of marriage. They talk about the office and Steffy tells him that she feels it is ridiculous what Quinn proposed and she is just dangling that in front of her to keep her with Wyatt. Quinn goes upstairs and tells Eric that her time with Steffy went well and she did something she hopes Eric will be okay with. She wants to keep Steffy with Wyatt and that is why she offered the CEO chair as a power house to FC. Steffy would be perfect for the job. She belongs strongly in this. Steffy is the one who can help heal and bring this family together. Wyatt tells Steffy that she sure has her blinders on tightly. Quinn does not want to be CEO so this is not a ploy for her to get Steffy on her side. Eric and Quinn walk downstairs and he wants to talk to Steffy alone. Eric repeats again that Quinn has changed. He would like not having to keep saying that. What Steffy fells is simply untrue. Wyatt has accepted the transformation and their marriage so who better to judge than her own son. Eric says Quinn has never hinted to him that she wants to run the company so who else besides Steffy. Brooke comes home to find rose petals strewn all over the floor up to the bedroom and in the bed. Ridge is inside and hands her a perfect rose with many candles aglow. She kicks off her heels, he unbuttons her blouse. She takes off his shirt and gets in the bed. Ridge starts by kissing her leg and works his way up. Steffy can not believe that Eric would even entertain the idea of what Quinn is offering. He assures her it is true and that Rick and Ridge and even Thorne will always have a place in the company but he agrees that Steffy should be the one. She cannot blame Quinn for marrying Wyatt or leaving him. He does not want to tell Steffy how to choose her life partner but her marriage to Wyatt is not over and she needs to give that more time before making a rash decision. She can be the next CEO of FC so just think it over. Afterwards, Ridge says he has never been happier. It does not matter how they drifted apart, only that they are back together now. It does not get more exciting than that. He loves this room, some things stay the same. She knows him better than anyone and this is their journey. He remembers the first time he saw her \u0096 his Logan.",
