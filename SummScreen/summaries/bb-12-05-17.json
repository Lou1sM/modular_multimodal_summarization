    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Ridge and Brooke discussed Thorne's return, and Ridge was upset that Thorne had been living at Brooke's house. Brooke was surprised because Ridge seemed suspicious of Thorne's motives. Brooke and Ridge argued about Thorne's spontaneous return. \"Why is he here?\" Ridge asked. Brooke wondered if Ridge had talked to Thorne about his work. Ridge had not.\n\n\nBrooke encouraged Ridge to show some interest in Thorne's work. Ridge was adamant that Thorne had an agenda. Brooke reminded Ridge that they were brothers and not children. They were both professionals in the fashion industry. She wanted Ridge to appreciate his brother's abilities.\n\n\n\"What does he expect? What are you not telling me?\" Ridge asked. \"Why can't you be happy that he's back?\" Brooke asked. She worried that Ridge had forgotten how much Thorne had lost in his life, including Aly. She added that Thorne might want to be more involved in the company and his family.\n\n\nRidge said that Thorne had been in the business side of International. Brooke countered that Thorne wanted to be with his family. Ridge felt they could dust off Thorne's desk in shipping. Brooke was surprised at Ridge's lack of compassion. Ridge was obsessed with finding out why Thorne had returned. He asked Brooke to accompany him to Forrester to find out what Thorne was up to.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Thorne talked to his father about Ridge. Thorne said he understood that Ridge had cheated on Brooke. Thorne said that Ridge had to prove he could have any woman. Thorne maintained that Brooke had told him it had just been a kiss that had broken up Ridge and Brooke before their wedding, but Thorne felt it had to be much more because Brooke was one of the \"most accomplished women in the world.\"\n\n\nEric looked suspicious. He told his son that it was no longer an issue. It had been dealt with. Thorne scoffed that Ridge had wanted everyone to forget, and they had. Eric reminded Thorne that it had been a painful time for everyone and that Brooke had moved on.\n\n\nEric understood that Thorne had had a rough time in life. He had lost Macy, Darla, and Aly. \"You've changed,\" Eric said. Thorne agreed. He said he wanted to return from Europe \"to be on equal footing\" with Ridge. Thorne refused to put up with Ridge's condescending \"little brother\" references and attitude any longer. Thorne handed his sketches to his father and asked his opinion. Eric was impressed. \"Ridge isn't your only son who designs,\" Thorne said.\n\n\nThorne explained that he'd had to lose himself in something after he'd lost his daughter, and he'd been trained by some of the best designers in Europe. He wanted to make Eric proud. Thorne said he had returned to be more involved with the whole family. \"You're with Quinn, and you seem really happy,\" Thorne said. He wished everyone else were doing as well. He noted that Brooke had married Bill because Ridge had let her down, and Brooke and was divorcing Bill.\n\n\nRidge and Brooke entered the office, and Ridge saw the designs. He wondered if they were Eric's, but Ridge said they didn't look like Forrester sketches. Eric said that Thorne had done them. \"Thorne's designing. Look at you, little brother,\" Ridge said. Thorne explained that he had worked with some acclaimed designers in Europe. Ridge said it was great that Thorne had a hobby and had been taking lessons.\n\n\nThorne said it was not a hobby. Ridge figured out that Thorne had shown the designs to Eric and Brooke first. Thorne countered that he would have shown them to Ridge if Ridge had shown an interest in what Thorne was doing. Thorne wanted to be a member of the design team, but Ridge said they weren't looking to expand the team. Thorne encouraged Ridge to offer his opinion on the designs.\n\n\nRidge said they were \"very interesting sketches.\" He added that Thorne had a great feel for fabric, but there was no theme, cohesion, or vision. Thorne explained that he had selected samples of his designs. It was not a collection. Brooke defended Thorne's designs as having potential. Ridge said they'd clearly been done by an inexperienced designer. Ridge was harsh in his critique. Thorne said that Eric still owned the company, and Ridge was the lead designer. Ridge asked to speak to Thorne alone. Eric wanted to stay, but Thorne said that he and Ridge needed to have a conversation alone.\n\n\nBrooke and Eric exited. Ridge noted that Thorne wanted to be a designer with a position at Forrester and had moved into Brooke's house. Ridge wondered what else Thorne wanted, and he called Thorne \"little brother.\"\n\n\nRidge softened slightly and told his brother that he understood Thorne had had a hard time, but he felt Paris had been good for Thorne. Ridge wanted Thorne to be happy. He added that while Thorne had been gone, things had not been standing still in Los Angeles. Thorne wanted to be a part of the future. He realized he was not a designer, but it was important to him. Thorne brought up Zende's designs, and Ridge defended Zende as a young, promising designer.\n\n\nRidge told Thorne that designers who had encouraged Thorne might have done so in order to help him, but they might not want to hurt his feelings. Thorne nodded, but he refused to allow Ridge to undermine his confidence or intimidate him. Thorne said he'd had enough.\n\n\nIn Quinn's office, she and Ivy discussed the designs that Ridge had liked, and they fit some necklaces on models. Quinn and Ivy thought they should show some of the designs to Thorne because he knew the European market. The models giggled, and Ivy explained that Thorne's return had created a buzz among the models. The models left. \"Thorne better watch out,\" Ivy said. She added that everyone was excited about Thorne's return.\n\n\nQuinn was surprised that Thorne didn't ever want to run the company. She and Ivy discussed that Thorne was very different from Ridge and had never been domineering. Ivy left, and Eric and Brooke entered.\n\n\nBrooke and Eric shared that Thorne had returned with designs and didn't hesitate to give his opinion. Brooke and Eric agreed the designs were promising. \"He's obviously been working very hard on this,\" Brooke said. It was clear that Thorne was ready to stand up to Ridge.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge tells Brooke that he is not upset. He is just curious. Thorne is up to something and is not staying with Brooke just because of family being around. Thorne tells his dad that he wonders who the other woman was and he is sure it was more than a kiss but he cannot imagine Ridge cheating on Brooke just before the wedding. Quinn and Ivy discuss the collections pieces and Quinn remembers how Ridge touched her when they discussed it too. Eric tells Thorne that Brooke and Ridge have worked through their problems and the other woman is out of the picture and they should just forget it. Thorne says he does not want to be Ridge's little brother anymore. It is condescending and he is not going to put up with it anymore. He has come back to be on equal footing. He shows his dad some designs which Eric thinks it terrific and asks who they belong to. Thorne says him. Ridge is not the only son who can design. Brooke tells Ridge that he has seen his brother. Does he really think he is different. Ridge says well he did not come home in time for Thanksgiving and yet he did not wait until Christmas so there has to be a reason why now. He will have to dust off his desk in shipping and receiving and make sure it is ready. Brooke says do not be surprised. She thinks he will want more than that. Eric tells Thorne he did not know he was a designer. Thorne says after Aly died he found her style and elegance and with encouragement he got started with kudos from Paris and Milan. This is one of the reasons he came back .that and Brooke and the whole family. He's heard so much but he wants to see it firsthand. He knows Brooke married Bill because Ridge let her down and now she is divorcing Bill so he knows Ridge will be after her again. Ridge walks in and sees the designs, He is totally surprised when he learns they are Thorne's. Ivy tells Quinn that when Ridge came back home there was a real shakeup but that won't happen with Thorne. Ridge tells Thorne that his designs are great and everybody should have a pretty hobby. Thorne remarks that it is more than a hobby. He wants to contribute. He welcomes Ridge's opinion and he is not afraid to ask for it. Ridge takes them and says they are good but there is no connection to the grouping. He has put a lot of work into it but it is not complete. And they do not just hand out designing jobs. Thorne says he would hope that his dad has the final say. Ridge says he knows what it takes to make it in this business and he has not been designing that long. Eric dismisses himself and says they will discuss this as a family. Ridge turns to Thorne and asks what is his little brother up to. Brooke tells Eric and Quinn that Thorne's work is promising and she hopes he will pursue it. Eric says the brothers have always approached things differently. He admires both of them; both are very confident but Ridge has always been dominate and now he thinks maybe Thorne wants to challenge him. Ridge tells Thorne that he wants him to be happy and everyone has a role to play for the future and he hopes Thorne will figure that out. Thorne says he went to Europe and he knows he is a novice and does not have the experience Ridge does but he wants to give it his all. Ridge says this is absurd. Thorne says enough of the little brother. They are not kids anymore. Maybe Ridge thinks he can intimidate him. He was treated like this his whole life but enough is enough.",
