    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Hope looked at pictures of herself with Wyatt and then with Liam. She reflected upon her romance with Liam, thought of the encounters she'd had with Wyatt, and sighed.\n\n\nAt the Forrester sky lounge, Quinn wondered what could be more romantic than the quest for Ricardo's diamond. Wyatt replied that Hope expected great things from him, and he'd deliver.\n\n\nQuinn and Wyatt agreed that he had to strike while Liam was showing his true colors by whining and pouting. Wyatt whipped out his phone to call Hope and invite her to dinner that evening at his place. Hope seemed hesitant, but when he claimed that he had a surprise, she agreed to meet him.\n\n\nAfter the call, Quinn was eager to help with the dinner, but Wyatt said he had it covered. She asked what he knew how to cook besides bacon, and she readily began making a grocery list. Snatching her pen away, Wyatt insisted that he had a plan, and though his mother being around wasn't involved, bacon actually was. He claimed that he had plenty of bacon available in case he was a good enough host to make Hope want to spend the night.\n\n\nQuinn figured that Hope would soon have her fill of Liam. Wyatt believed that Hope was ready to let go, but she needed a little more encouragement. Quinn argued that Hope and Liam weren't a good match, and Liam was holding the strong and confident Hope back.\n\n\nWyatt responded that Hope had outgrown Liam. Quinn figured that after Liam threw his temper tantrums, he'd concede that he and Hope hadn't been compatible, and he'd be free to return to Steffy. Wyatt joked that Steffy had gotten clean already, because he'd heard that it only took twenty-eight days to get Liam out of a woman's system.\n\n\nThe two realized they needed to get to a meeting, and Quinn was thankful that a little camping trip had led to them being at Forrester and had enabled them to hand out raises at their business. With their company succeeding and Wyatt about to get the girl, Quinn decided that the solar shower had been the best investment she'd ever made. \"You? I -- I bought it...\" The puzzled Wyatt replied as they exited.\n\n\nOutside at the cliff house, Liam stared at the ocean. Aly remarked that she understood why Hope was enjoying her time with Liam and Wyatt, but it still wasn't right. Liam became frustrated and walked off. Aly followed him and found him deep in thought in his living room.\n\n\nAly again apologized for sending Liam the picture. She figured that Hope would hate her for it, but Liam doubted that. Aly couldn't help wondering why Hope would put him through \"this.\" Liam replied that it was because he'd put her through a lot worse.\n\n\nFiguring that Liam meant an eye for an eye, Aly replied that it wasn't right, and it wasn't who Hope was. \"At least who she used to be. You deserve better,\" Aly concluded.\n\n\nLiam stated that Aly had been at school and hadn't seen what Hope had put up with. Assuming that he meant Steffy, Aly said she hadn't known what to think when she'd first learned about Hope's situation with Liam and Wyatt. It had seemed cool at first. \"But the more I thought about it...\" Aly said.\n\n\nLiam interjected that Hope had given him many chances, but he'd blown them. Though it was hard for him, he was trying to understand what it was like to be the unsure one in the relationship. Aly asked if being with someone was supposed to be about competition.\n\n\nThough she'd been young when her mother had died, Aly could still remember the love, loyalty, and devotion her parents had shared. Aly said she'd taken for granted that Liam and Hope had that kind of connection. Liam uttered that they did, but Aly replied that someone needed to tell Hope that.\n\n\nIn quiet revelation, Liam chuckled and agreed. He picked up the phone and called Hope to say that he needed to see her. Hope replied that she'd be at home from then until that evening.\n\n\nAfter the call, Aly asked what Liam would say to Hope, but Liam had no idea. \"I feel responsible,\" Aly bit out. He said that she wasn't, but he thanked her for reminding him that he was.\n\n\nLater, the somber Aly arrived at work, and Thorne assumed that something was bothering her. Her father prodded her, and she wondered how long she'd have to shadow Hope. Thorne asked if Aly wanted a new assignment. Aly replied that she'd been learning a lot from Hope, but Aly didn't know if she liked what Hope was teaching.\n\n\nThorne became concerned and said he'd thought Aly looked up to Hope. Aly claimed that she did; however, she was concerned about Hope's choices and how they affected people. Aly figured that Hope wanted what she wanted, even if it hurt someone else.\n\n\nThorne remarked that Hope was one of the nicest people he knew, and he asked what in specific Aly was talking about. Aly said it was hard to explain; however, Hope was different, and it hadn't been what Aly had expected or remembered about Hope.\n\n\nBack at Brooke's house, Liam arrived and asked how Hope's day had been. Hope explained that she'd had a photo shoot, and he asked if she'd done it alone. She revealed that Wyatt had jumped into a few photos and asked Liam not to be mad. \"What are we doing?\" Liam asked, and Hope sighed.\n\n\nLiam told Hope that he didn't want to live that way any longer, and Hope asked what he wanted. Liam acknowledged that Wyatt had happened along at a time when she'd felt the need to prove something to Liam, and she'd enjoyed having two guys chase her. Liam conveyed that he'd put her through things no one should have to endure, and he was lucky that she was still talking to him.\n\n\nLiam figured that Hope was still around because she loved him and wanted to marry him. He said he'd proven his loyalty, but she'd been playing games with him. He believed that they belonged together. \"So enough of this. No more Wyatt. Let's make this happen,\" Liam said.\n\n\nLiam led Hope outside, and he began to scout out locations. Hope wondered why he doing it. He responded that it could happen in the living room or the bathroom, but it was time that they exchanged vows. \"Oh...Liam...\" Hope gravely replied.\n\n\nLiam said Hope had asked him to give her time, and he'd done that. \"But time for what, exactly? To give Wyatt the wrong impression?\" Liam asked. He felt that he'd shown his commitment to Hope, and she needed to show him hers.\n\n\nHope murmured that she wasn't saying she and Liam wouldn't get married eventually. Liam replied that \"eventually\" was no longer enough. He felt that it was time they moved on and time that she cut ties with Wyatt and his company. Hope claimed that she couldn't make that decision, but Liam countered that it was her line and her call.\n\n\nLiam figured that he and Hope could do a low-key ceremony before the holiday with family and friends right on the spot where he'd proposed to her. He said it would be that easy with no more asking, heartache, or bended knees. \"I'm taking what I want, and I'm taking it now,\" Liam declared and swept Hope in for a deep kiss. Pulling back to gaze at her, he asked, \"Am I making myself clear?\" \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam makes an important decision; Wyatt comes up with a plan to make Hope his",
    "tvmega_recap": "Aly tells Liam that Hope is beautiful and famous .not that it matters to Liam, but she doesn't think it is right. He hesitates for a long time and finally says he does before walking off. Hope is home alone looking at the photos on her laptop. She smiles when she sees the ones of her and Wyatt. Her back stiffens and she is not smiling when she sees the one of her and Liam. She smiles again when she thinks back on first seeing Wyatt naked at Big Bear. Quinn asks Wyatt if he has something specific planned for him and Hope. He says maybe but it has to be special and romantic .even bigger than Mexico. He says Hope expects great things from him and he plans on delivering. He says if he is going to make a move, he needs to do it now. Liam is getting frustrated and now showing his true colors. Quinn mocks yes and he's whining and pouting. Wyatt says Hope needs to see that she has options. Quinn answers yes Steffy is out of town so \"I\" can be with you now, Wyatt starts calling someone and Quinn wants to know what he is thinking. It's Hope and Wyatt says he wants to see her. He asks if she has any plans for tonight and when she says no, he says she does now. He'd like to invite her to dinner at his place, he has something special, a surprise so he won't tell her. She agrees to come. Quinn asks Wyatt how she can help. She heard him say dinner. He tells her he has it covered. She says oh no, sweet boy, he doesn't know anything about cooking except bacon. He scoffs, well there is hotdogs and smores, anything around a campfire mostly. She says right .they better start making a list now. He takes the pen out of her hand and says no offense, but he has a plan and her being in the general vicinity wasn't exactly a part of it. And he doesn't need a list; he has plenty of bacon in the frij. She laughs at that being part of the plan. He says tomorrow morning it will be. Hope will want breakfast so he has to be a good host if she is going to spend the night. She chuckles at Mr. Romance. She says Hope is so much better off with Wyatt than Liam so he can just shove off and be with Steffy. Wyatt reminds her that Steffy is clean now. It's only takes 28 days to get Liam out of your system. Quinn says okay, then Liam can go lure another poor young girl to put up with him .anybody but Hope. Who knew that camping trip of his to Big Bear could lead to this. It totally changed their lives. It feels so good to be able to give pay raises to the people that work for them. Wyatt admits it feels good and he thinks about that trip every day. She says that solar-powered shower was the best investment she ever made. Wyatt says he bought it. Aly slowly follows Liam back into the house and apologizes (again) for saying something wrong. He says she didn't. She says again that she didn't really think it through about the picture, but it just seemed like he ought to know. Hope may never forgive her. Liam tells her not to think that way. She says it is not like she wants to hurt Hope, she really doesn't. Hope is lucky to have Liam; she needs to realize that and not put him through this. Liam says he has put Hope through a lot worse. Aly says an eye for an eye; that is not right either. That is not the Hope she used to know and Liam deserves better. He says Aly has been away at school and missed a lot, but Hope has put up with a lot. She mentions Steffy. He says yes. She starts blabbering on and on about what a nice guy Liam is. When she started at FC and she idolized Hope her whole life and saw these two hot guys fighting over her ..she didn't know what to think. Liam doesn't let her finish. He says so many times he could have been with Hope and he blew it. So he's now trying to understand what it feels like to be the one who wonders if they might not end up together. Aly says it should not be about competition. She was young but not that young. She can remember her mom and dad looking at each and she did not know what loyalty was but she could see it in their eyes. There was comfort, ease, attraction and you knew there was no one else they wanted to be with. She may be taking it for granted but she is guessing that he and Hope have that kind of connection. Liam says they do. Aly says well somebody needs to tell Hope. He says yeah somebody does. He picks up the phone and calls Hope. He says he needs to see her. She says okay, she will be home until tonight. Aly feels responsible. He says she is not but thanks her for reminding him of it. Aly goes back to FC and checks in with her dad who senses that she is distracted. He asks if she had rather go to lunch with Hope instead of him. She says no but he wonders what is really going on. She says she likes working here but wonders just how long she has to shadow Hope. She's learned a lot from her but she's not so sure she likes what Hope is teaching. Thorne is surprised to hear what Aly is saying or what she is not saying. He thought she looked up to Hope. Aly says she does. Hope is smart and beautiful and she wants to be just like her except she is now wondering about some of the decisions Hope makes and how they affect people. She wants what she wants and if anybody gets hurt it doesn't seem to matter. Thorne says Hope is one of the nicest people he knows so could Aly be more specific. Liam arrives at Hope's and asks about her day. She tells him the photo shoot went really well and Wyatt was in for a few. Don't be mad. Liam asks what they are doing. ..their relationship. He doesn't want to live this way anymore. She asks what does he want? He replies that Wyatt came along at a point when she needed to prove something to Liam and she enjoyed two guys chasing after her and he gets that. He knows he has put her through some things that nobody should be put through. And it might even be a miracle that she is speaking to him, but she is. She loves him and wants to marry him. He's proved his loyalty but Hope is still playing games with him. They belong together so enough of this. No more Wyatt, they just need to make it happen. He leads her outside and picks out a few spots and says they will be perfect but then so would her living room or the bathroom ..it's time they exchanged their vows. She asked him to give her time and he did. But time for what just to give Wyatt the wrong impression. He has shown his loyalty to her and now it is time for her to show it to him. She stammers that she is not saying they won't get married eventually. He says eventually used to be good enough but it's not any more. They need to move on and she needs to cut her ties with Wyatt and his company. She tells him she can not make that decision so it isn't her call. Liam says it is her line so it should be her call. And it doesn't have to be that big a deal. They can even do it before the holidays. They can grab a minister and their family ad get married right here where he proposed ..no more asking, no more heartaches, no more bended knee. \"I'm taking what I want. I am taking it now. Am I making myself clear?\"",
