    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Quinn, Eric, and Brooke agreed that it was wonderful to have Thorne home. They discussed that Thorne had some great designs and seemed to have a lot of talent. Quinn gushed that if he had half of Eric's talent, they would all be lucky. Eric admitted that his sons had always been competitive and had never gotten along very well. Brooke felt that Thorne wouldn't back down this time. She felt Thorne would stand up to Ridge.\n\n\nIn Ridge's office, Thorne and Ridge had an intense discussion. \"Stop patronizing me,\" Thorne said. Ridge ordered Thorne to respect his office. Thorne mocked Ridge and said he would bow down to Ridge to respect the office of their family business. Thorne refused to put up with Ridge's condescending attitude, but Ridge ordered Thorne to stop overreacting. \"Get it through your head: I'm not taking your crap anymore,\" Thorne advised.\n\n\nRidge and Thorne continued to argue until Brooke, Quinn, and Eric arrived. Eric insisted they stop. Ridge laughed and said that he and his little brother were fine. Eric and Brooke said they clearly were not fine. \"The two of you were fighting,\" Eric said. Eric asked Brooke to take Thorne to lunch. Brooke agreed. Thorne looked at Ridge and told him he was a bully. Thorne added that everyone was tired of Ridge mistreating people -- especially Brooke. Ridge glared at Thorne. Brooke and Thorne left.\n\n\n\"Stop giving Thorne a hard time,\" Eric ordered. Ridge gloated that he was just kidding around, but it was so easy because Thorne was so sensitive. Eric demanded that Ridge become more welcoming to Thorne. Ridge insisted he was doing his best. Eric ordered him to try harder. \"Lower your expectations,\" Ridge replied. Quinn told Ridge to stop being obstinate.\n\n\nRidge insisted something was strange about how Thorne had all of a sudden become a designer. Ridge didn't trust Thorne and figured something was up. Quinn and Eric wondered why Ridge was so upset with Thorne. Quinn wondered if it was because Thorne was staying at Brooke's house. Ridge said he thought it was odd that a grown man wouldn't get a hotel room. Ridge excused himself because he wanted to release Brooke from her baby-sitting duties with Thorne. Ridge left.\n\n\nEric worried to Quinn that his sons would have gotten into a fight if they had not interrupted. Quinn couldn't believe they would be so petty. Eric explained that there had always been issues and that Brooke had at one time been married to Thorne. \"She's back in the middle again,\" Eric said.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Sheila spied Brooke and Thorne at lunch, but she watched from a distance. Thorne told Brooke that he had known Ridge had been trying to upset him by acting superior. Thorne didn't understand why Brooke or anyone had put up with Ridge for so many years. Thorne added that Brooke had made the right decision in breaking it off with Ridge and with Bill.\n\n\nThorne suggested Brooke should be alone for a while and not allow a man to define her. He called her an amazing woman. Brooke and Thorne discussed that they had gone through some good and bad times together. Brooke said it was nice to see his handsome, smiling face. She admired his humility.\n\n\nThorne said he had thought about all the great women in his life: Macy, Darla, and his daughter. He added that he and Brooke had had a wonderful wedding in Venice. Brooke agreed. Ridge showed up and said Brooke had a meeting at Forrester. Brooke balked, but Ridge said it was important. Brooke left with Ridge, and Sheila stepped in to visit with Thorne.\n\n\nSheila said she had returned to Los Angeles to start over.  She had noticed that Thorne had had a great connection with Brooke, and it was too bad that Ridge had interrupted. Sheila said that Ridge felt he could have any woman he wanted no matter who she was with -- including his dad. Thorne wondered what she meant. Sheila said that she didn't want anyone to know that she had told him, but she had paid Mateo to seduce Quinn, and it had blown up in her face. Sheila explained that Quinn had cheated on Eric and had an affair with Ridge. Thorne looked skeptical.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Brooke wondered who was attending the meeting he had wanted her to return to. Ridge had set up two plates with lunch in his office, and he said it was just the two of them. She said Ridge had been rude to Thorne.\n\n\nAt Steffy's, she couldn't stop thinking about making love with Bill. Liam asked her questions, but she was distracted. Steffy recovered and said she was happy to be home with her husband. Liam kissed her and thanked her for helping him and his father repair their relationship. Liam was happy that Bill had even offered to help Sally.\n\n\nLiam quickly apologized for mentioning Sally. Steffy said it was fine. Liam apologized for \"breaking our vows.\" He thanked her for being so forgiving, but Steffy stopped him and started to panic. She turned away and tried to take deep breaths. Liam was dismayed that he had upset her.\n\n\nSteffy looked at Liam and said she wanted to completely put that night behind them and erase it. Liam agreed, but he questioned where she had gone and who she had been with because someone had convinced her to return to him.\n\n\nSteffy paused again. She said she had gone for a drive and then realized how lucky she was and returned home. She continued to have flashbacks of lovemaking with Bill. Steffy started to cry. Liam apologized and promised to never let her down again. Steffy begged him to stop because he hadn't let her down. They kissed.\n\n\nLiam returned to the kitchen, and Steffy walked away. She had trouble breathing, and she heard her own voice calling her a cheater and a liar. The voice got louder, and Steffy looked in the mirror and shook her head.\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Thorne and Ridge spar at each other and Thorne says he is just now getting back to town and already Ridge is on his case ..guess he is not bowing down far enough in his brother's office! Thorne says this is getting under his skin and he is definitely not going to keep this up any more. He is so tired of Ridge's condescending attitude. Ridge tells his \"little brother\" to stop over- reacting. Thorne points his finger in Ridge's face and tells him not to call him that again. And Ridge does not get to tell him what to do. Ridge reminds him that it is he who runs this company now. Quinn tells Brooke and Eric good for Thorne for branching out and becoming a designer while he was in Europe and Eric knew nothing about it. Eric says he likes what he has seen so far and is interested in just how far it will go. He knows Ridge and Thorne have always been competitive all their lives but somehow Ridge always ends up with the upper hand. But maybe Thorne will stand up to his brother this time. Steffy panics as she thinks again on the night she was with Bill and their night of passion. Liam cannot catch her attention and asks what is wrong. Thorne and Ridge are still squabbling when Quinn, Eric and Brooke come in and want to know what's the matter. Eric says he does not want them fighting in here and Brooke agrees they both need to calm down. Thorne tells Ridge that he is a bully and used to controlling everyone around him and that has to stop. Eric tells Brooke to please take Thorne to lunch and let them all cool off. Thorne points his finger again at Ridge and says he is tired of being mistreated and it has to stop, including his treatment of Brooke. Steffy says she was just thinking about something else; nothing is the matter. It's over now. She's just happy to be home with her husband and being made a homemade meal; it is all she ever wanted. They hug when he apologizes for bringing Sally and Bill's name up and for when he broke his vows. He will never be that insensitive again. Ridge tells his dad that Thorne breezed back into town and now he is a designer. He is up to something; what he does not know. And he is not upset but he does wonder why a grown man would come to Los Angeles and not get a hotel room for himself. He is staying at Brooke's. And now Ridge is going to find them and relieve Brooke of her babysitting duties. At Il Giardino, Sheila spies Brooke and Thorne at one of her tables. Brooke tells Thorne don't let Ridge get to him. Thorne says he tries not to but he always rattles his cage. He has had to put up with it all his life and now it is over. He does not appreciate Brooke trying to defend him and she was right to call off her wedding in Australia. He thinks she is an amazing woman and she does not need a man to define her. Sheila is planted behind a big bush taking all of this in. Brooke thanks Thorne and says he is nice and it is sweet of him to remind her. He reminds her that any man does not understand that is a fool. Instead of putting it all behind him Liam continues to want to re-live that night and when she came home he could not believe how lucky he was that she forgave him. It was like she was a different person and he never even asked her where she had been. Now he is curious where she went that night and what did she do. She thinks long and hard and finally says she never should have left and she drove around thinking of him and how she should have stayed. Thorne tells Brooke they have been through a lot together and she has always been there for him and he counts on her as someone he can always turn to. She says he is too humble .really she thinks he is the sweetest, kindest person she has ever met. Suddenly there is Ridge interrupting their talk. He says he called but it kept going to voice mail. They have a meeting and she is needed. He won't listen to Thorne's no she does not have to go. Ridge spirits her away and Sheila wastes no time in walking over and saying hello to Thorne and even invites herself to sit down as it is her break. He says he heard she was out of jail and back in town. She says she could not help but see he was with Brooke and it's too bad that Ridge came in and whisked her away. But then that is what Ridge does .he swoops in and takes the women away from his friends, his brother and even his dad. Brooke is surprised when she gets back to the office with Ridge and there is no meeting, just a lunch he has provided for the two of them. She says he was rude to Thorne. He says Thorne will get over it and they both need to stay away from the restaurant as Sheila works there. Sheila confesses to Thorne that she tried to sabotage Quinn and Eric but she was wrong and Quinn did not cheat on him after all. She had her reasons for thinking she would. She says he has been away from home for a long time so there is a lot he does not know. For instance she wonders if he ever thought why Brooke and Ridge did not get married in Australia. She admits she knows who Ridge was with just before the wedding but he cannot tell anyone that this came from her. Quinn cheated on Eric with Ridge. Liam keeps yammering away at Steffy how loyal she was and he knows she does not want to talk about this and put it all past her so he will never let her down again. Again all she sees are these images of her and Bill having sex and she finally shouts at Liam to stop. He leaves for a minute to go back to kitchen and she goes to the mirror and looks at herself and says she is a big cheat .a big liar, phony and a cheater. Guilty as charged!",
