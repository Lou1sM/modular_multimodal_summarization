Ivy grabbed Steffy's arm, and as Steffy yanked herself away, she inadvertently knocked Ivy into the bundle of live wires. Steffy gasped as Ivy got electrocuted.\n\n\nSteffy called for the paramedics. The emergency operator instructed Steffy to do chest compressions until the paramedics arrived.\n\n\nIn the CEO's office, Eric, Carter, and Thomas met to discuss accessories. Eric complimented Quinn's work, and Quinn's eyes glazed over when Thomas chimed in to say that Ivy deserved some credit. Eric believed that Wyatt deserved credit, too, and Ivy had been doing exceptional work since she and Wyatt had started seeing each other.\n\n\nPam hurried into the office and alerted everyone to an accident involving Ivy. Thomas and Eric rushed to the showroom and arrived backstage at the same time as the paramedics. Eric comforted the sobbing Steffy, who cried that Ivy had to live. Nothing seemed to be working. After several compressions and a shock from a defibrillator, the paramedics finally got a pulse and wheeled Ivy to the ambulance.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Wyatt stared at Ivy's photo. Liam arrived, and Wyatt guessed that his brother knew what had happened. Wyatt explained his feelings regarding his breakup with Ivy and his mistrust of her. Liam blamed himself for the way things had unfurled and said he'd told Steffy to let Ivy tell Wyatt herself. Wyatt believed he'd still be in the dark about it if Steffy hadn't told him.\n\n\nWyatt stated that Steffy hadn't taken pleasure in telling him. He believed that she'd been looking out for him, and he wanted to leave it at that. Liam doubted that Ivy would see the benevolence in Steffy's actions, and he urged Wyatt to call Ivy and keep the lines of communication open.\n\n\nQuinn called Wyatt to tell him that something terrible had happened to Ivy, and Ivy was at the hospital. \"It's Ivy,\" Wyatt told Liam, and the brothers rushed out of the house.\n\n\nBack in the CEO's office, Eric was trying to reach John on the phone. Carter informed Pam, Eric, and Quinn that Jake and the electrician had managed to shut off the breaker seconds after Ivy had made contact with the wires. Quinn didn't understand why Ivy had been anywhere near the sparking wires.\n\n\nEric was having a hard time reaching Ivy's parents. Pam hoped to have good news by the time he did. Eric was upset because he prided himself on always having a safe work environment. He recalled when his brother and wife had tried for a long time to have another child, and they'd almost given up when they'd finally conceived Ivy, their little miracle.\n\n\nEric didn't know what he'd say to John. Pam stated that he'd tell John that they were all praying for Ivy, and the power of prayer still worked miracles.\n\n\nAt the hospital, paramedics wheeled Ivy into a room. Steffy didn't want to leave Ivy alone, but the doctor asked her and Thomas to wait in the lobby during Ivy's examination. Thomas asked Steffy what had happened, but she said she didn't want to talk about it. He pressed to know what the women had been doing backstage and to know what Steffy wasn't telling him.\n\n\nSteffy felt as if Thomas was accusing her of something. Thomas wondered why she'd say such a thing. He just wanted to know what had happened. Hugging her, he decided that they didn't have to discuss it right then. Steffy sobbed that Ivy shouldn't have been backstage.\n\n\nSteffy revealed that Ivy had tripped, and it had been an accident. \"She tripped when I pushed her away,\" Steffy uttered. Thomas was shocked to hear Steffy had pushed Ivy.\n\n\nSteffy explained that she'd been waiting for an all clear regarding the electrical panel when Ivy had arrived and accused her of deliberately trying to break up Ivy and Wyatt. After Ivy had gotten in Steffy's face, Steffy had pushed Ivy away, and Ivy had fallen into the panel.\n\n\nJust then, Liam and Wyatt arrived, and Thomas and Steffy told them that Ivy had been electrocuted. The doctor emerged from Ivy's room, and Wyatt asked for Ivy's condition. The doctor asked if Wyatt was a relative. Wyatt cleared his throat, and Thomas asked what the doctor could tell them.\n\n\nThe doctor was still running tests. He was concerned about damage to the heart, muscles, and brain, which usually depended upon the current and duration of contact. Steffy said it had immediately lost power when Ivy had made contact with it.\n\n\nThe doctor relayed that Ivy had a relatively small percentage of surface burns, but healthy skin could be concealing damage. Infection could also be a concern, and Ivy was in critical condition.\n\n\nThe doctor bent the rules and let the four in to see Ivy. She was still unconscious, but the doctor said unconscious patients could sometimes hear various conversations.\n\n\nThe doctor left, and Wyatt spoke to Ivy, hoping that she could hear him. Taking her hand, he said he didn't care what had happened between them, and all that mattered was that she made it through. Liam patted Wyatt's shoulder, and Thomas walked up to the bed but said nothing.\n\n\nSteffy left the room to find out if the doctor had gotten any results, but he didn't have anything new to tell her.\n\n\nLiam exited Ivy's room, and Steffy hugged him. He didn't understand how it had happened. He asked if Steffy had been with Ivy. Steffy said she had been waiting for Jake and the electrician when Ivy had arrived and confronted her about Wyatt. Upset, Liam said it had been exactly what he'd been afraid of. \"If you just didn't meddle in their relationship!\" he said.\n\n\nSteffy claimed that she'd tried to avoid Ivy as Liam had asked. Liam's expression darkened. He asked Steffy to say she'd had nothing to do with it, and it had been a freak accident. He claimed to know that Steffy wouldn't hurt a fly, but he needed to know that the reason for Ivy being in the hospital bed had nothing to do with Steffy.\n\n\n",

He says he knows she would not hurt a fly but he needs her to look him in the eye and tell him that this was a freak accident and had nothing to do with her.",
