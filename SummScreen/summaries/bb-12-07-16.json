    "imdb": "Liam is stunned that Steffy did not immediately turn down Quinn's offer as he finds it evident that her only motivation is to stir Steffy back into Wyatt's arms. Steffy insists that Eric believes she is ready to lead the company. Liam angrily reiterates that Quinn is simply trying to manipulate her and implores Steffy to not fall for Quinn. At the Forrester Mansion, Quinn encourages Wyatt not to give up on his marriage. Meanwhile, Ridge visits his father to tell him that he and Brooke are back together. Ridge is stunned when Eric not only disagrees with his suggestion that it would be the perfect timing to let him and Brooke run Forrester Creations together, but also informs him that he has promised the CEO position to Steffy.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tries to point out to Steffy what Quinn is doing \u0096 she is trying to get Steffy on her side. He reminds her that is exactly what will happen as she is dangling this carrot in front of Steffy to become CEO and using her grandfather to do it. Steffy argues that her grandfather would never do that if he did not believe she was ready to lead FC. Liam says he knows she is ready and the company would flourish but that is not why Quinn is pushing this. She says there were a lot of hurt feelings but this being CEO is a way of them getting past all of that again. Over and over Liam says Quinn is manipulating the situation and Steffy cannot let her do that. He does not want Quinn getting into her head. She replies that her grandfather is the most important thing to her and he still has confidence in her despite months now of being at odds. He points out again that her grandfather is asking her to accept Quinn and totally disregard all she has done in the past. And Quinn wants her back with her son. Steffy says that is not going to happen. Liam retorts they may know that but you could chisel that in stone and Quinn will not accept it. She argues again that her grandfather's offer was sincere and this matchmaker thing is not going to work. And she cannot turn this offer down especially if Quinn ends up running the company if she doesn't. He could have asked Rick or Ridge or even Thorne but his confidence has been shaken and he asked her so how can she turn that down? Quinn tells Eric and Wyatt that things are looking good and she hopes to see both Steffy and Wyatt running the company as husband and wife. Eric tells Wyatt that his mother does not want to compromise his marriage over her own. Ridge walks in and wants to see his dad alone. He starts off that he has good news \u0096 he and Brooke are back together. Eric thinks that is good news. Ridge says that signals a new beginning for him and Eric and for the family. He thinks he and Brooke should lead the way for FC into the future. Quinn makes Wyatt a sandwich and says she would love to be a fly on the wall right now if Eric is telling Ridge that he picked Steffy for CEO and watch Ridge's head implode. Eric tells Ridge that a husband and wife team is a good thing for the company. Stephanie was more than a wife to him, she was a good partner for the company, but she is gone now and he has Quinn. But she is about to step aside. She knows how important it is that a Forrester sit in that CEO chair. Eric has chosen someone he knows and loves and has forgiven for recent events. Ridge thinks of course he is speaking about him and thanks him. Eric says no, is it not Ridge. He has picked Steffy. Quinn tries to get close enough to hear through the walls and wants to hear the explosion when the Prodigal son gets passed over in favor of his own daughter. Eric tells Ridge that Steffy has everything she needs to lead this company into the future and Ridge cannot expect him to brush aside all the differences and disrespect he has had for him recently. It was all very hurtful. And Ridge should know it was Quinn who suggested this and he knows Steffy has the business savvy and will make a great CEO if she accepts it. Liam recounts to Steffy that he is not against her grandfather but he wants her to remember Quinn and all her crimes and manipulations she has maneuvered. This is the way she conned her way into Eric's life. And he is worried that Quinn will do that or even worse if she takes the position. She replies that she shares his concerns and reservations and that is why she has not said yes yet. She wants Quinn gone but if she turns this down it will only solidify her position in the company and her grandfather's life. If it were just Quinn offering she would say no but it is her grandfather who tells her she is just like Stephanie and this is a wonderful opportunity. Liam argues that he knows that but it all comes back to Quinn and how she operates so do not let her do this and draw Steffy in. Quinn tells Wyatt that she does not believe whatever Liam says will sway Steffy. Steffy tells Liam that her eyes are wide open and she knows Quinn has ulterior motives and this is no exception. Liam still cannot believe that Quinn is in total control of the company now and is willing to give that up without something in return. She is brokering for Steffy and Wyatt to get back together. Steffy says maybe but that is not why Eric is doing it. Liam says she cannot know what Eric wants as he is still recovering. Eric told her exactly what Quinn wanted him to. She programmed Eric to believe that Steffy was just what the company was waiting for. She's hurt. She just had the most special moment with her grandfather and Liam is now saying they were just words that Quinn put in his mouth. But she will not let him degrade that. He rails at her that yes she deserves the job but not like this. Do not take the job. Ridge tells Eric that his daughter will know it is his time and hers will come later. He gets it \u0096 he has hurt his dad and all he can do now is try to be a better son and a better CEO just as Eric has groomed him for all these years. Now he is ready. He would like the chance to prove it with Brooke at his side. He outright asks his dad to appoint him CEO.",
