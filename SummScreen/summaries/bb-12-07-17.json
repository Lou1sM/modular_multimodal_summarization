She said she'd been enjoying her lunch with Thorne until Ridge had pulled her out for the so-called working lunch. Ridge felt he'd had to do it because Brooke saw Thorne enough at the house, and one could only take Thorne in small doses.\n\n\nRidge asked if she was done eating. He had another surprise for her. Following Ridge out of the office, Brooke mirthlessly replied that she couldn't wait to see it.\n\n\nLater, Brooke and Ridge strolled into the steam room, and Brooke stated that \"this\" was the surprise. Ridge thought it was about time, and she quipped that it depended upon what he had in mind. Ridge didn't think it was scandal because, if anyone walked in, they'd see him kissing his future wife. Ridge kissed Brooke lightly, and they grinned at each other.\n\n\nAs Brooke and Ridge relaxed in the steam, Ridge was sure it beat lunch with his little brother. Brooke reminded Ridge not to call Thorne that. Ridge griped about Thorne probably taking a long time to find somewhere else to live, and Ridge was sure that, in the meantime, Thorne would pressure her to say what had happened in Australia.\n\n\nBrooke said she hadn't told Thorne about Ridge and Quinn. Ridge said there was nothing to tell, and he asked if Brooke understood that it was in the past. Brooke did. She knew that Ridge was sorry and regretted it. She said spending time with him had been good for her and R.J. Brooke thanked Ridge for the space he'd given her and for reminding her of what they'd had together. Ridge said he'd keep reminding her, and he promised that they'd get there.\n\n\nAfter a while, Ridge wondered if Brooke was getting sleepy. He had some ideas on how to perk her up. In her silence, he guessed that she wanted to save it for the honeymoon. Brooke giggled, and he promised to keep giving her space. He believed that what they had was special, and he wouldn't let anyone get in the way of it.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Thorne was shocked to hear from Sheila that Ridge had had an affair with his father's wife. Sheila claimed that Quinn and Ridge had had an encounter on the day Ridge was supposed to have married Brooke, and it hadn't been the first time. Thorne was further surprised to hear that Eric had forgiven Ridge and Quinn for doing it.\n\n\nSheila told Thorne that Quinn wasn't a good person, and Sheila had stayed in the city to look out for Eric's best interests. Sheila hoped Thorne believed her. Thorne said he had to go, and she told him to remember that the information hadn't come from her.\n\n\nIn the design office at Forrester, Quinn and Eric talked about Ridge and Thorne, who'd each been married to Brooke. Quinn supposed that Brooke was unforgettable. Eric replied that \"Unforgettable\" had been Ridge and Brooke's theme song, and it described their on-again, off-again relationship.\n\n\nAs Quinn and Eric prepared to depart for lunch, Thorne arrived to speak to Eric privately. Quinn left to get takeout, and Eric asked Thorne what had happened to the lunch with Brooke. Thorne quipped that it had been what always happened when Ridge was around -- \"To hell with anyone's feelings, including yours,\" Thorne said.\n\n\nThorne revealed that he knew how Ridge had betrayed Eric with Quinn. Eric didn't want to talk about it. To him, it was over.  Thorne asked what was wrong with Ridge to do that to Eric again. Eric said he hadn't wanted Thorne to know it because of the very thing happening at that moment. It was putting Eric's sons at odds with each other.\n\n\nThorne stated that Ridge couldn't keep ruining people's lives. Eric replied that no one's lives had been ruined, and he'd forgiven Quinn. Thorne asked if Eric had forgiven Ridge. Eric explained that he hadn't, and at first, he'd renounced Ridge and thrown him out of the company. Thorne asked why Ridge was acting like top dog at the company and in the family.\n\n\nEric asserted that Eric was top dog at the company and in the family, and it would be that way until the day he died. Eric didn't want to hang onto the bad feelings. Thorne understood Eric's view, but Thorne didn't like Ridge feeling as if he could take and take. Thorne said he was there, and he'd put a stop to it.\n\n\nEric was adamant that Thorne not go after Ridge. Eric insisted that it was over, and he said he'd forgiven Quinn. Thorne was amazed that Eric had forgiven Ridge and had made him CEO. Eric corrected that it was co-CEO. Thorne didn't know why Ridge had gone after another of Eric's wives. Thorne had thought Ridge hadn't liked Quinn and recalled that Ridge had summoned Thorne there to stop Eric's wedding.\n\n\nEric said that Ridge had been wrong to do it, but things were more complicated. Agreeing, Thorne said it had begun with Stephanie's lie. The lie had caused Thorne to live in the shadow of a power-hungry Marone. Thorne said he, not Ridge, carried Eric's DNA, and that might be why it was so easy for Ridge to do the things he'd done to Eric.\n\n\nThorne moved on to Brooke, who deserved the best. He said Ridge thought it was he, but that wasn't true. \"Especially now that I know about him and Quinn,\" Thorne added. He felt that actions had consequences, and he asserted that Ridge would learn the hard way from Thorne.\n\n\nAt Il Giardino, Quinn cringed when Sheila approached to say the takeout order would be ready shortly. Sheila asked if Eric and Quinn were having a cozy lunch at the office, and Quinn told Sheila to buzz off. The women traded insults, and Quinn called Sheila a troublemaker. Sheila said she was a working stiff, something that Eric Forrester's wife wouldn't know about.\n\n\nQuinn couldn't believe Sheila was implying that Quinn had married Eric for money then Quinn asked herself why she was engaging with Sheila. Sheila ribbed Quinn about the perks of working closely with Ridge, but Quinn said the real perk was going home to her husband after work. Sheila asked about Ridge. Quinn hoped that Ridge and Brooke would be as happy as Quinn was with Eric.\n\n\nWhen Quinn's order was ready, Sheila said she'd put in a piece of tiramisu because it was Eric's favorite. Before taking the bag from another server, Quinn asked if Sheila had touched any of the food. She shook her head, and Sheila giggled as Quinn took the bag.\n\n\nQuinn ordered Sheila to stay away from the Forresters because her days of wreaking havoc had ended. After Quinn had gone, Sheila was happy that she could still get to Quinn.\n\n\nLater Quinn was eating alone in the CEO's office when Ridge arrived, fresh from the steam room. She asked if he'd proposed to Brooke in there. \"In the steam room?\" Ridge asked. Quinn said it had been their favorite place over the years.\n\n\nQuinn turned the topic to Sheila, who was looking for dirt, in Quinn's view. Ridge seemed distracted, and she asked what was wrong. He asked if Thorne had been in the building. Quinn affirmed it and said Thorne had been with Eric earlier. Ridge asked what Thorne had wanted.\n\n\nQuinn didn't know, but she remarked that Thorne was different. To her, he seemed more assertive. Ridge said it was as if Thorne was up to something, and Ridge planned to find out what it was.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke apologized to Thorne about lunch. Thorne was bitter about Ridge getting away with things. Brooke replied that it was just how Ridge was. Thorne called Ridge rude, arrogant, and self-centered. Touching her hand, Thorne said it was why he was worried about her. Brooke replied that he shouldn't be, and she could take care of herself.\n\n\nThorne said that he was sure his father had felt the same way. Thorne revealed that he knew who the other woman had been in Australia. He said it had been Quinn, and Brooke asked who had told him. Thorne didn't think it mattered and added that Eric had confirmed it. Thorne said Ridge couldn't keep getting away with lies and betrayals.\n\n\nThorne thought it was even worse because it had been Eric's wife. Thorne guessed Brooke had been horrified. Brooke replied that in some ways, she still was. Brooke started to make an excuse, but Thorne said there should be no more excuses. Thorne labeled Ridge as a perpetual cheater who had broken her heart countless times.\n\n\nThorne felt that Brooke deserved a man who'd be there completely, but Ridge was incapable of it. Thorne said it was probably difficult for her to hear, but she couldn't marry Ridge.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Thorne and Sheila finish their conversation when she says Eric forgave both Ridge and Quinn. Just remember he did not hear this from her. Thorne returns to the office and says Ridge had other ideas so his lunch with Brooke was cut short. Brooke and Ridge are in the steam room. Quinn pops over to Il Giardino to wait for takeout and cannot escape from Sheila who spots her and waltzes over asking how she is. Quinn says she does not have to play nice with Sheila since she is just a troublemaker. Sheila thinks it is too bad that Brooke was called away by Ridge. Quinn says no mind, Brooke and Ridge will be having fun in a moment and she hopes they are as happy as she and Eric are. She grabs her takeout, making sure Sheila never got her hands on it and tells the witch to leave Eric and her entire family alone. Sheila grins; she knows she still gets to Quinn. Eric tells Thorne this is why he did not want Thorne to know about Brooke and Ridge and the rough patch with Quinn. But he forgave her and all is well. He did tell Ridge he was no longer part of this family, this company and no longer his son, but in time he forgave him. Life is short and hanging onto animosity does no good. Thorne says he knows but Ridge takes and takes and he is going to stop that once and for all. Eric says he does not want him to fly off the handle and go after his brother; all has been forgotten. Thorne says Ridge is CEO well co- CEO but Eric knows all he has done in the past. Thorne says because of his mother's lie he spent his whole life in the shadows of a Marone, not a Forrester. Maybe that is why Ridge does what he does. He knows he is not worthy. Brooke is an extraordinary woman and she deserves the best. Actions deserve consequences and his brother is going to learn that the hard way. Brooke apologizes for being dragged away at lunch but says she can take care of herself. Thorne confides that he knows who the other woman was and why Brooke did not want him to know. She cannot let this go on, the lies and betrayal. With dad's wife, she must have been horrified. He says no more butts, no more excuses for his brother. Brooke should have been enough for any man but Ridge wanted more. She has to get out of this. He has broken her heart countless times and enough is enough. He will not let him do that again. Ridge is incapable of loving one woman; she cannot go back to him and marry him.",
