Nick looks confused, and Stephanie tells him to walk over to the beach house, if he doesn't believe her.  She tells him that there is a baby there.  Nick looks at Felicia and wants her to tell Stephanie that they don't have a child, but Felicia just stands there.  She finally starts to tell him that she doesn't know where Stephanie gets her ideas.  Stephanie blurts out to Nick, that Felicia is denying everything to protect his marriage to Bridget.  She tells Nick to do the math!!  Nick asks Felicia once again, if, Stephanie is telling the truth, but nothing comes out of her mouth.  Nick faces Felicia and asks her, how she does something like that?  You leave here for a whole year and you say nothing.  \"Yes,\" says Nick. \"I would have liked to have known that I have a son.\"  Nick and Felicia talk about what happened.  He thinks about Bridget, who has been through so much, all ready.  Felicia tells Nick that she came back, to see if they had a chance at a life together, but that was before she learned that he was all ready married.  She tells him that she is leaving that evening to go back to France. She starts to go when she is greeted at the door by Renee, holding the baby.  Nick asks if he can see the baby, and when he looks at the boy, he is now looking at him and knowing that the baby is his son.  Nick holds his son lovingly.  Felicia tells him that the baby is perfect.  Nick thinks that his son has his eyes.  He introduces himself to the baby, saying, \"I'm your old man and I'm right here.\"  Nick looks up and says, \"So, this is what it feels like.\n\n\nEric walks in and tells Brooke, that they have to do this little charade, until Stephanie gives him back the company.  It's the only way to make her believe anything.  Meanwhile, Darla, Thorne and Taylor think that maybe too much closeness in the basement, is wearing both Eric and Brooke thin.  Eric tells them all that he wants to review his designs with them before leaving for a wedding.  Eric announces that he is going for intelligence and elegance, the things that Forrester's has always stood for, but he is trying to incorporate what Stephanie wants to do also.  Brooke decides to go along with Eric, and comments that there is nothing like caving in to what Stephanie wants.  Brooke comments that his designs are too modest for her.  Brooke claims that it wouldn't be necessary, if Stephanie wasn't so hung up on sex.  Brooke tells him that his designs are safe and Eric walks out.  Brooke leaves shortly after that.  Thorne turns to Darla and Taylor and tells them that he believes that his dad is actually turning his back on Brooke.  Taylor, not believing what she has heard, places a call to Stephanie's voice mail.  She tells her that something just happened that she has waited for a long time.\n\n\nJackie pays a visit to Bridget.  After hearing the whole story, Jackie still wonders if Felicia is still enamored of Nick or is there possibly something else that is prompting her.  Bridget tells Jackie that she could see that there was still something that Felicia was feeling for Nick, but assumes that it was because he was there for her when she suffered with her cancer diagnosis.  Bridget comments that if it wasn't that, what could it possibly be?\n\n\n",
