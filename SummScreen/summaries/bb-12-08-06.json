    "yt": "\n\nTaylor insists that even though everyone gets frustrated with their children, there is no excuse for domestic violence.

Everyone is proud that Stephanie found the strength to say what she needed to say to her mother.

    "imdb": "\nAfter Chicago, Eric is back in Stefanie's good books. They both receive a warm, understanding welcome home. Only she still excuses her father's dreadful domineering as 'the norm back then'. Taylor convinces her to pretend her father is alive so she can 'confront' him to.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eric and Stephanie discuss what a big, emotional ordeal this has been with her mother. She lovingly thanks him for being with her and for his support. The children are gathered at the house and he tells her all will be fine. Brooke and Taylor bond over the situation and both find it hard to believe - this good father, the pillar of the community, yet he abused his own child. Taylor says Stephanie has acknowledged it now and her life will change dramatically. Felicia can't eat a thing, she is sick to her stomach. She laments she misses Dante in Italy and Dominick is sleeping through the night. Parents home, the children rally around and there is a regular Forrester lovefest. They love and appreciate their mother all the more knowing what she went through and why she was so protective and controlling all these years. Eric extols again what an amazing woman Stephanie is and she thanks him. The children join in and tell him their mother isn't the only one they are proud of today. Brooke seeks out Stephanie and also gives her support and understanding and Stephanie graciously accepts it. Taylor needs to speak to Stephanie privately. Stephanie explains how difficult it was to once again be turned aside by her mother, but she did feel it was cathartic. Taylor offers her to do the same for her father. Though he is dead and isn't there, she can still tell him how she feels. Stephanie has doubts but does tell her dad that she loved him, but was afraid of him and now she thinks he was a coward and just plain wrong. She feels better and Taylor tells her that see, she can protect herself.",
