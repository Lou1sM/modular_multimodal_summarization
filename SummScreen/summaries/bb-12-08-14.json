    "soap_central": "\n\nOn his drive to Brooke's house, Liam left a second message to let Hope know that he was on his way to see her because he was worried that Quinn could be headed in Hope's direction. Liam arrived at the house, saw the open terrace door, and went outside to the garden.\n\n\nIn the garden, Quinn rushed down the steps to the banged-up Hope. Hope was dazed as she rolled off her stomach and onto her side. Quinn tried to help Hope, but Hope ordered her to get away.\n\n\nLiam screamed Hope's name as he charged down the steps and shoved Quinn out of the way to get to Hope. He accused Quinn of pushing Hope, but Quinn denied doing it. Liam scooped Hope up in his arms and ran up the steps with her.\n\n\nAlone, Quinn stared at the platform where Hope had landed and flashed back to what had just occurred with Liam. Quinn remembered times in which she'd tried to get others to see how much she needed to be in the lives of her family members and, again, Liam running up the steps with Hope.\n\n\nAt the loft, Deacon pleaded with Wyatt to reconsider the restraining order, but Wyatt didn't believe that anyone could reason with Quinn. Wyatt didn't know why Quinn couldn't even use common sense about staying away until the situation improved. \"She showed up to her sonogram, dressed like a freaking nurse. A nurse! Enough is enough!\" Wyatt exclaimed.\n\n\nWyatt didn't know why he'd even want Quinn in his life at the rate she was going. Deacon said that once Wyatt held the baby for the first time, he'd understand why Quinn couldn't stay away. Wyatt disagreed. To Wyatt, Quinn took parenting to a whole other level, and he couldn't keep pretending that she was just another soccer mom in a minivan.\n\n\nWyatt believed that his mother was dangerous, and because Hope feared Quinn, he had to keep her away. Deacon felt that Hope would regret keeping her child's grandmother away, and he asked for another chance to talk to Quinn. Wyatt responded that talking wouldn't help and added that Deacon knew how dangerous Quinn was. Deacon said a restraining order was a bit much.\n\n\n\"She had a sword up to Liam's neck!\" Wyatt reminded Deacon. Wyatt was sure that Quinn would have killed Liam, and Wyatt recalled that she'd pushed Ivy off a bridge without a second thought. Wyatt was sure that Quinn would brood and throw around threats, but deep down, she'd know that it was best for him and Hope. He predicted that after a few months, everyone would cool off, and he hoped that circumstances might be different by the time the baby was born.\n\n\nWyatt asked Deacon to leave so that Wyatt could talk to Quinn alone. Deacon wasn't sure it was a good idea, but Wyatt asserted that it was between him and his mother. Deacon said it wasn't too late to rip up the papers. \"Your mother is a danger, but not to Hope -- and certainly not to your child,\" Deacon said and exited.\n\n\nAlone, Wyatt flashed back to Quinn dressing up as a nurse to get into the sonogram. He remembered Hope talking about a restraining order as he'd tried to mediate between the women.\n\n\nWyatt's phone rang. It was Liam. Wyatt didn't answer it because he didn't want to deal with Liam at that time. Quinn entered, looking spooked, and Wyatt stated that he'd been text-messaging her. She nodded absently, and he asked if she was upset. She nodded, and he asked who'd upset her. \"Me. I'm upset with myself,\" Quinn murmured.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Quinn had been with anyone -- Liam in particular. Quinn looked away, and Wyatt asked if it had been just Liam. \"Of course not,\" Wyatt cynically stated in Quinn's shaken silence. \"You went to go see Hope, didn't you?\" he asked.\n\n\nQuinn was staring in thought but not speaking, and it was freaking Wyatt out. He assumed she'd gone to the baby shower, and he demanded to know what had happened. Quinn said it had happened after the baby shower. Liam had gone to Hope to tattle on Quinn like he always did, but Quinn had just wanted Hope to know that she'd get the space she wanted, and Quinn was backing off.\n\n\n\"So you went to her to tell her that? Where?\" Wyatt asked. Quinn replied that they'd been in Brooke's backyard. Wyatt asked why it was so hard to stay away from Hope. He said Quinn's determination had made her a good mother; however, it was too much at times, and it was getting in the way of her being a grandmother to his child.\n\n\nQuinn was still eerily silent. Wyatt noted that he'd never seen her look so scared, and he demanded to know what had happened.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Liam carried Hope in, and even though he wasn't her husband, he insisted upon staying with Hope. The doctor allowed him to, and when she examined Hope later, Hope's neck was stiff. The doctor asked if she had abdominal pain. Hope did, but she added that she hurt all over. The doctor asked if Hope had been alone when she'd fallen.\n\n\nHope said she'd been with her mother-in-law, and Liam asked if Quinn had pushed Hope. Hope said it hadn't been that way. She explained that she and Quinn had been arguing, and after Quinn had gone, Hope had lost her balance on her high heel. The doctor concluded that Hope didn't have a concussion or broken bones.\n\n\nThe doctor left to set up an ultrasound, and Hope asked if Liam had called Wyatt. Liam said he'd left a voicemail because Wyatt hadn't picked up. Liam asked Hope to believe that the baby was fine and to keep up positive thoughts.\n\n\nThe doctor returned with the ultrasound equipment, and Hope noted that she'd heard the baby's heartbeat at the first ultrasound. Starting up the machine, the doctor decided it was time to hear it again. After a few seconds of looking at the projection screen, Hope wondered if they should be hearing something. She asked the doctor to keep searching and check higher on her belly.\n\n\nThe doctor said she was sorry; there was no heartbeat. Hope implored her to keep looking, but the doctor said that \"he\" was gone. The doctor expressed sympathies again, and she and her assistants left. Liam grabbed Hope's hand as Hope sobbed. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Even after Wyatt explains why he feels the need to serve Quinn with a restraining order, Deacon does his best to talk him out of it. Knowing what Quinn is capable of, but unsure of her intention, Liam frantically searches for Hope anticipating that he will find her first. Unaware of what is in store for her, Quinn has a difficult time telling Wyatt about her most recent interaction with Hope.",
    "tvmega_recap": "One of Hope's high heels gets caught in a crack and she tumbles over and over to the bottom of the concrete stairs outside. Quinn is still on the grounds and calls out her name. Liam is trying to call Hope but only gets a voicemail. Wyatt tells Deacon that he doesn't like this but he has no other way than giving Quinn the restraining order. He needs to stop his mom from seeing Hope, otherwise he does not know what will happen. She's not using common sense at all. She needs to stay away. Deacon tries to get him to wait a few months but Wyatt says no. She is not normal and Hope is scared of her and he has to protect Hope. Deacon argues and Wyatt says he knows his mother will be ticked off but it will keep her away and give everyone a chance to cool off. Perhaps after the baby is born, things will be different. Quinn gets to Hope who comes to and is bleeding from the mouth. Liam rushes to Brooke's to see if Hope is there. He rushes out on the balcony where the door is open. He spies Hope with Quinn bending over her. He pushes Quinn out of the way while accusing her of pushing Hope. He picks Hope up and slowly ascends the stairs back to the house. Then he whisks her to the hospital. Although he is not the husband or the baby's father he insists on being admitted to Hope's admitting room. She has a few scrapes and bruises but no concussion. And they think the baby is okay so Liam tells her to stay positive. She assures him that Quinn did not push her; it was an accident. Quinn goes home and Wyatt has a hard time getting all the facts out of her. She starts by telling him that she went to the baby shower to tell Hope she was backing off. He barks at her that she gets in the way. He tells her she looks scared and he needs to know what happened. Hope's doctor does an ultrasound but finds no heartbeat. Hope cries with Liam quietly standing by.",
