Thomas replied that until Ivy was conscious and talking, there was little the doctors could predict. Thomas suggested that Wyatt might not want to be there for that event.\n\n\nIn the hall outside Ivy's room, Steffy and Liam discussed Ivy's situation. Liam asked Steffy to tell him what had happened and not to shut him out. Steffy countered that she wasn't ready for an interrogation. Steffy said she was trying to deal with it. \n\n\nA doctor interrupted Steffy and Liam and said he had heard that other relatives were there. He wanted to talk to all of them together. The doctor, Steffy, and Liam joined Wyatt and Thomas in Ivy's hospital room. He shared that they had completed scans and x-rays on Ivy, and there were no broken bones, but a cardiologist and neurologist would have to make critical determinations about any other injuries and her prognosis.\n\n\nWyatt asked about a brain scan, but the doctor answered that there was nothing they could determine. It was normal for an unconscious patient to show no signs of trauma until they had awakened. The doctor told the group they needed to step outside to talk because it shouldn't be something that Ivy could hear.\n\n\nOutside Ivy's room, the doctor said that until she was awake and could respond to them, they could not rule out lasting consequences. He advised the group that other family members had been calling for information, but his staff was not permitted to give it. He asked them to share the information with family members and discourage them from calling.\n\n\nAt Forrester Creations, Zende, Maya, Pam, and Eric were in an office. Eric was frantically making phone calls, and Nicole, Maya, and Zende asked Pam who had called the EMTs for Ivy and if anyone had been in the ambulance with her. Pam said that Steffy and Thomas had followed the ambulance in another car. Zende sent messages to his parents, and he promised to go to the hospital to see if he could get any news.\n\n\nPam asked Zende to stay with Eric because Eric needed him. Eric said that he had left messages for everyone he could. He had been unable to reach his brother. Eric lamented that he couldn't reach John to tell him that his daughter had suffered a horrible accident. Pam said it might be best because when they did reach John, they might have better news for him.\n\n\nNicole called attention to the fact that no one had explained how Ivy had been electrocuted. Pam said they had all been wondering the same thing. Everyone wondered why she had been near electrical wires.\n\n\nEric explained that there had been a problem with an old electrical panel, and Steffy had been waiting at the panel for Jake when Ivy had shown up. \"Steffy was there?\" Maya asked. Pam said that it was a good thing because Steffy had been the one to call 9-1-1. Nicole, Maya, and Zende looked surprised. They left Pam and Eric alone.\n\n\nIn another office, Maya, Zende, and Nicole chatted about the incident. Nicole said she hated to suggest bad news, but she asked if Ivy could die. Maya regretted everything that she and Rick had done to Ivy and Aly. Aly had died, and they were all uncertain about what would happen to Ivy. Nicole pointed out that Ivy had forgiven Maya.\n\n\nMaya and Nicole's discussion turned to their mother. Nicole said that their mom had sent pictures off the Internet to her everyday. They laughed that she had sent cats and babies and other pictures.\n\n\nMaya said she hoped things had changed for their family. They had a better relationship with their parents. Nicole looked sick, and she ran out of the room. Zende wondered what was wrong. Maya explained it was morning sickness, and Zende asked how long morning sickness lasted. Later, Maya left, and Nicole apologized for her quick exit. \"I don't wanna be sick and all big and pregnant, but I am,\" she said.\n\n\nNicole said she couldn't go out with Zende that evening. He said it was fine because they could watch a movie at home, but Nicole responded that she planned to stay in her room with a bucket by her bed. She apologized for letting him down. Zende nodded.\n\n\nFrom the hospital, Liam called Pam to tell her there was no news, and Pam relayed the information to Eric, who frantically looked through a folder of papers that his brother John had given him for Ivy. Eric was distraught, but Pam reminded him that there was no alarming news so far. Eric sadly said that whenever something bad happened to someone, all they were left with was papers.\n\n\nEric remembered that had been what had happened when Stephanie had died. \"That's all I had. And in the end, that's all there is,\" he said. He tearfully looked away, and Pam took the folder away from him.\n\n\nAt the hospital, in the hall outside Ivy's room, Wyatt and Thomas asked Liam how Eric was, and he replied that Eric had been unable to reach Ivy's parents. Liam could sense the tension between Thomas and Wyatt. He wondered if they would be all right together. Thomas noted they were in a medical building in case one of them needed attention. Liam left.\n\n\nThomas blamed Wyatt for the incident because Wyatt had broken up with Ivy. Wyatt angrily stated that they had not broken up, and it was Thomas who had caused trouble in Wyatt and Ivy's relationship. Wyatt suggested that Thomas seemed to think he was irresistible.\n\n\nThomas refused to accept guilt for what had happened to Ivy. Wyatt noted that Thomas had no conscience. He accused Thomas of blaming Ivy, who had been injured. \"You're the reason why she's here. You feel good? All you gave her was misery. If she doesn't recover ...,\" Wyatt shook his finger at Thomas and walked away.\n\n\nIn Ivy's room, a nurse tended to Ivy, and Steffy entered. Steffy wondered if Ivy could hear her, and the nurse said it was surprising what some patients could hear and remember. The nurse exited, and Steffy told Ivy that she thought Ivy would be fine and wake up at any minute.\n\n\nSteffy tearfully wondered aloud why bad things continued to happen all around her. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do this to you,\" Steffy said. Liam stood in the doorway and overheard Steffy's statement. \"Mean to do what?\" Liam asked.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy left Ivy's room, and Liam quizzed Steffy about what had happened. Steffy explained that Ivy had been angry. Liam reminded her that Ivy had been angry because Steffy had told Wyatt about her encounter with Thomas instead of letting Ivy do it.\n\n\nSteffy reasoned Ivy should have told Wyatt right after it had happened. Liam argued that Steffy had never given her the chance. Liam shook his head. Steffy explained that she had been waiting for Jake near the electrical panels because Jake had told Steffy there was an electrical problem.\n\n\nIvy had followed Steffy to the panels, and Steffy claimed that Ivy had physically attacked her and grabbed her arm. Liam asked why it had never occurred to Steffy to walk away.\n\n\nSteffy said Ivy had been out of control. \"You know how she gets?\" Steffy asked. Steffy explained that Ivy had knocked Steffy's phone out of her hand, and when Steffy had reached for it, Ivy had grabbed her, and Steffy had shoved Ivy into the electrical panel. Liam was surprised. Steffy looked at Liam. \"Don't you believe me? Please believe me,\" Steffy said. Liam shook his head.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam says he will not let others blame Steffy if she just tells him that she had nothing to do with Ivy being in the hospital. He says he is not blaming her but she was the only witness and others will start talking. Wyatt asks what is the point of Thomas staying here in the room. He is not helping and they will not know what is wrong for a while yet. The doctor asks them to step outside; this information is not for Ivy if she is aware on some level. He says no broken bones but the heart and brain can take a hit so she is not out of the woods yet until neurological tests. Pam tells Zende and Maya to stick around for Eric who is frustrated that he can not get in touch with John. Both of them and Nicole are shocked to hear that Steffy and Ivy were in that room with malfunctioning equipment. No one is saying but she could die from this. Liam checks in and tells Pam to tell Eric there is no more news yet. No one knows what might happen when Ivy comes to. Eric looks through some immigration papers just in case they need it. In the end just as in Stephanie's death that is all there is, just a folder of papers. Steffy wants to see Ivy alone and tries to speak to her. She says Ivy looks fine and could wake up any moment. She cries so many things keep happening in her life and she wonders why .losing her baby, then Liam and Aly and now this is happening to Ivy. Liam walks back in to hear the last part. He asks for details. Nicole has some morning sickness which Zende wants to hear more about. She says she does not want to be sick around him but it comes on when least expected and not just early in morning. Wyatt tells Thomas that he can not stay here around him. Thomas says this is not some weird competition for Ivy. Wyatt says he does not mind what Thomas is doing to him but he sure as hell does mind what it is doing to Ivy, if she does not recover. Again Steffy does not want to talk about this and shrugs Liam off. He follows and asks if there is something she wants to tell him. She says Ivy was angry and confronted her there in the electrical panel room. Ivy attacked her by grabbing her arm and saying how upset she was about Wyatt knowing. In the melee Ivy was pushed to get her off Steffy. Liam can not believe this keeps happening. Steffy asks him to please believe her.",
