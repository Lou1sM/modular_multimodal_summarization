Satisfied that Wyatt had gotten notoriety for the stone, Ricardo announced that some of his contacts in India wanted to meet Hope and Wyatt immediately to discuss showcasing more pieces. Wyatt was delighted with the prospect of getting away with Hope.\n\n\nAfter Ricardo took off with the diamond, Wyatt remarked that he'd told Hope that he'd give her that diamond someday, but it had left the building. The talk with Ricardo had given Wyatt some ideas for his evening with Hope, and he was anxious to get to work on them.\n\n\nEric asked if things were going well with Hope. Wyatt believed they had a long way to go, but he had the incentive he needed through all he and Hope had accomplished. Wyatt said that, with Hope by his side, the sky was the limit. For Wyatt, it was more than chemistry; it was his future, and he planned to fight for it. \"There's no way I'm giving up the best thing that's ever happened to me,\" he concluded.\n\n\nWyatt left, and Eric wondered what was next. Quinn guessed that it was India for Hope and Wyatt. Eric asked what was next for Quinn, and Quinn showed him a small box. She opened it to reveal some gold-crafted cufflinks with his initials on them.\n\n\nAs Quinn fastened the jewelry to his cuffs, Eric asked if she was contemplating cufflinks for the men's line. She thought it was a possibility but said their partnership could go places that they hadn't even thought of yet. Eric said the cufflinks were stunning, but she'd thanked him enough. Quinn didn't think it was possible to thank Eric enough.\n\n\nEric said he'd given Quinn the chance, but she'd run with it. Quinn felt that she couldn't have gotten the international exposure on her own and said she'd finally replaced her gas-guzzling car with an electric car, thanks to Eric. Eric was glad to have helped the Fullers and the planet at the same time.\n\n\nQuinn said Eric had inspired her and Wyatt. She'd never seen her son so determined. She knew that Wyatt would do all he'd promised to do for Hope. Eric asked if Quinn were convinced that there was a future for those two. Quinn was, and she believed that Hope would be, too, by the night's end.\n\n\nIn Brooke's backyard, Liam declared that he was ready to make it official with Hope before anything else could get between them. He was over all the waiting, Wyatt's games, and Quinn's obsessions. Gasping, Hope said that Liam was giving her an ultimatum in which she'd either severe ties with Wyatt and marry Liam, or -- \"Or don't,\" Liam concluded with a simple tone.\n\n\nIn Brooke's living room later, Hope told Liam that she wanted very much to agree to his request. Liam asked her to give him a reason not to. She said she'd realized that she'd let the thing with Wyatt go on for too long; however, business was involved, and Quinn and Wyatt had worked very hard.\n\n\n\"Harder than us?\" Liam asked. Hope started to say that Quinn and Wyatt were finally in a place; however, Liam completed her sentence with, \"where they could have everything they've ever wanted in their lives...\" He asked if it sounded familiar to Hope. Liam was done waiting and felt that they either had to move forward, \"or...\" Sighing, Liam said she had to cut Wyatt out.\n\n\nHope decided that Liam was right, and there was no good reason that they couldn't get married. Listing Steffy, Bill, and Amber, Liam concluded that his and Hope's problems had ended, and he wanted to spend his life with only Hope. Liam felt that they had nothing to prove to each other anymore, and they just had to cut out the distractions and focus on each other.\n\n\nLiam said he was focused on Hope, which was all she'd ever wanted from him. Sighing, he decided that he'd asked her one more time. Before he could speak, Hope stated, \"Nothing. I'm not waiting for anything. So let's do it. Let's get married.\"\n\n\nLiam grinned and asked if Hope was sure. Smiling back, Hope asserted that she didn't want to wait any longer, and she wanted to marry him. Liam quickly swept her in for a kiss. Incredulously, he asked if there were really no reservations. \"Not about you, but...\" Hope replied.\n\n\nHope asked if breaking the contract with Quinn and Wyatt was really necessary. Liam replied that he wished he could trust the mother and son for Hope's sake, but he just didn't. Hope said that Wyatt had promised to respect her marriage. Liam responded that he was unsure about Quinn.\n\n\nHope admitted that Quinn had taken things a little far. Liam remarked that once Quinn heard about the wedding, she'd probably think she hadn't gone far enough. He also thought that Wyatt would go after Hope even harder. Hope offered to have Caroline become the liaison with Quinn's company, but Liam said that Caroline could also find another jewelry designer.\n\n\nHope was worried because the partnership had been huge for the Fullers, but Liam reasoned that it could be huge for someone else who deserved it. Hope added that Eric really liked working with Quinn. Liam remarked that Quinn probably had the same ideas about Eric as Wyatt had about Hope.\n\n\nLiam felt that something was wrong with Quinn and Wyatt, and cutting them out was the only way to keep them from harming Hope and Liam. Hope was still worried about the Fullers' business, but Liam figured that the business was going so well that Quinn and Wyatt didn't even need Forrester any longer. \"Not like I need you,\" Liam added.\n\n\n\"...Okay...\" Hope decided. Liam kissed her, and she said she'd talk to Wyatt that night when she saw him.  Liam stiffened, asking if she and Wyatt had plans. Hope said Wyatt had wanted to see her, and Liam asked if he should go with her to be the bad guy. Hope assured Liam that she could handle it. Liam asked Hope to \"come home\" afterward, where they'd celebrate and talk about the wedding.\n\n\nHope decided that Liam was right; everything had been dealt with, even Steffy. Hope didn't feel as if she was sharing him anymore, and she promised that he wouldn't have to share her, either.\n\n\nAt Wyatt's place, Wyatt busily decorated his living room with India-inspired d\u00e9cor. He also had Indian food, Bollywood movies, and India-themed music.\n\n\nWhen Hope arrived, she was amazed by Wyatt's elaborately decorated home. She called it exotic, but he said he'd been going for romantic. It looked like the Taj Mahal to her, and he asked if she wanted to go there. Wyatt excitedly revealed that they'd been invited to India, and he asked if she wanted to do another getaway with just the two of them.\n\n\nWyatt conveyed that Ricardo and his friends had been impressed by Wyatt and Hope. Wyatt imagined that it was just the beginning because jewel holders worldwide wanted to see them. There were many places he wanted to show Hope, and talking to Ricardo had filled Wyatt with possibilities.\n\n\nWyatt took Hope's hands and said they were at the beginning of something. Hope quietly slipped her hands away. He figured she was sad about having to return the diamond, but he assured her that there were other jewels for them to find. Hope replied that it wasn't about the diamond.\n\n\nHope relayed that she and Liam had talked earlier about their wedding, and he'd given her an ultimatum. Wyatt said that it sucked, and he was sorry. She replied that she was, too, but she had to end her relationship with Wyatt and his company. Wyatt said Liam had tried that before, but Hope insisted that she couldn't work with Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt got upset, saying he and Hope were a great team, and profits were good. Wyatt stated that Liam couldn't do it. \"I'm doing it. Not him. I'm doing it,\" Hope asserted.\n\n\nHope grew emotional and said everything that they'd done to that point had put things in motion business-wise. Wyatt insisted that it was the reason they had to keep going. Hope responded that he could keep going, but he and his mother didn't need Forrester anymore.\n\n\nWyatt asked about him and Hope. Hope wished that she and Wyatt could be friends, \"but Liam thinks -- \" Wyatt cut her off, saying he didn't care what Liam thought. Hope replied that she cared what Liam thought because he'd be her husband. She declared that she and Wyatt had to end it professionally and personally, and she couldn't see Wyatt anymore.\n\n\nWyatt stated that it was \"so wrong,\" but Hope responded that what she'd done to Liam had been wrong. Wyatt said that spending time with him had made her happy, but she replied that it hadn't been fair. Wyatt argued that \"this\" wasn't fair to her or to him.\n\n\nHope insisted that she and Wyatt couldn't see each other anymore, but Wyatt refused to accept it. He kissed her, and she kissed him back. When Hope pulled away, Wyatt declared, \"Not a chance.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Liam issues Hope and ultimatum about Wyatt; Quinn shows her appreciation toward Eric",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tells Hope that they have to move forward; they can't stand still. They have to do this. And he wants her to cut all ties with Wyatt and his mom at FC. She realizes he is giving her an ultimatum and doesn't feel right about it. He says they just got sidetracked. He loves her and he knows she loves him. He is so done with Wyatt and his games and Quinn and her obsession. There is not one single good reason they can't get married now. All those obstacles are out of the way. Steffy is gone, his dad is not interfering and remember Amber, well she is long gone too from causing problems. He only wants to focus on her. There is not one single reason they shouldn't get married. But there is Wyatt. She admits that she let that go too far for too long but he doesn't deserve to lose his job over this. Liam assures her that Wyatt and his mom have come a long way and they can do just about anything they want to now so they will be okay. He convinces Hope that they don't even need FC anymore. Wyatt and Quinn are bad for them and the only way to make sure they do no harm is to cut them out. She says she will talk to Wyatt tonight. He tells her to come home tonight and they can talk and celebrate. She says okay. Everything else has been dealt with, even Steffy, so she does not feel she has to share him anymore. And she promises that he will not have to share her. Ricardo meets with Eric and tells him how pleased he is with the fame of the diamond and how it has boosted sales. Now it is time for him to take it home. But this is not goodbye to Wyatt and Quinn. The diamond is wanted around the world and he'd like Wyatt to take it to India ..with Hope of course. Wyatt is blown away and of course Quinn looks very pleased. Wyatt says the diamond has left the building. Eric adds and it has done its job. Wyatt tells Quinn and Eric that he's not needed now and he has big plans tonight. Wyatt says that Ricardo gave him some ideas so he has other plans now that he needs to go take care of. Quinn fills Eric in that Wyatt is seeing Hope tonight. Eric is a little surprised they are getting that close. Wyatt says with the right motivation and incentive and Hope by his side, the sky is the limit. And that is more than good chemistry. That's his future and he's going to fight for it. No way is he going to give up the best thing that has ever happened to him. Quinn gives Eric a gift. It's her way of thanking him for all that he has brought into her life. It's a pair of stunning gold cufflinks E.F. and she puts it on his shirt and makes a remark that besides being for the men's line in the future, this partnership might go places they have not even thought of yet. Wyatt scrambles to make his place look romantic with a Bollywood theme, setting the mood with music and movies. Quinn shares with Eric that she could never thank him enough. He's given her and her son national exposure. She's even managed to buy a new car an electric one so she can get rid of that old gas guzzler and it's all because of him. He chuckles that he's very glad then. Not only is he helping her and her son but the entire planet. She says he has done more than help, he has inspired her and Wyatt. She has never seen such changes in him; he's so focused and determined. The way he talks about his future, it's music to a mother's ears. She does believe there is a future for him and Hope and she believes Hope will think so too by the end of the night. She makes a prediction. This could be a very big evening for those two. A nervous Hope says Wyatt's place is so exotic. He says he was shooting for romantic. She says it looks like the Taj Mahal. He says he has always wanted to go. She says her too. He tells her they have been invited. One of Ricardo's contacts wants to meet them as soon as possible. And there are other dealers all over the world. He's excited and says there are so many places he wants to take her and things he wants to show her. He's always had it in the back of his head but after talking to Ricardo today it really bought it out. He takes both of her hands in his and says this is the start of something. She unclasps her hands and he says he knows as he is very sad about the diamond going too but there are other jewels and they will find them. Hope finally says it is not about the diamond. She talked to Liam earlier today. They talked about their wedding and he gave her an ultimatum. Obviously Wyatt takes it the wrong way and says he is sorry. She says she is too. She needs to sever all ties with Quinn Artisian Jewelers and she has to end her relationship with Wyatt. He's in disbelief and says no. Liam has tried that before. Hope says again that she is sorry but she can't work with him. He wants to know why. They make a great team; the profits are out of sight. Liam can't do this. Hope says Liam is not doing this; she is doing this. They do make a great team. Everything they have done with the diamond and the collection has been fantastic. He says then they need to continue. She says he can. Him and his momma absolutely can. They don't even need Forrester any more. He asks what about them. She says she wishes she could say they could still be friends, but Liam thinks ..Wyatt is frustrated and blurts out that he doesn't care what Liam thinks. She says but she does. She cares because they are getting married. They have to end it .. all of it professionally and personally. She can not see him anymore. Deflated, Wyatt says this is so wrong. She says no, what is wrong is what she put Liam through. She dragged it out way too long and it wasn't fair. She admits they had some good times together and he adds it made her happy. She says over and over that she is sorry it has to end this way. He pleads with her to please do not do this. She says they can not see each other any more. He nixes that and says no and grabs her and kisses her, even a second time and she responds.",
