    "tvmega_recap": "Liam tells Quinn that most definitely Steffy deserves the CEO job but not if Quinn is part of that package. He can see that even if Steffy can't. She gets it, he is here now to plead his cause because he wants to puff up his chest and is afraid she will take the job even with his dire warnings. Eric welcomes Katie into his home and ends up telling her that he and Ridge have some trust issues to work on but he has named Steffy the CEO. He had some issues with Steffy too but she only did what her dad urged her to do. She has Stephanie's backing though and that means a lot. Quinn tells Liam that he is in her kitchen trying to bully her. And maybe that would be okay if she was the woman she used to be but that is not true anymore. Steffy tells Ridge that she will have to work with Quinn but not so much as she will be in charge of the jewelry line. Eric will finally see her for what she is and she will be right there to help push her out. Eric tells Katie that she is always welcome and he expected her to be popping in more than she has. And do not let Quinn scare her off. Liam tells Quinn that by dangling the CEO job in Steffy's face means she has not changed at all. She does not see what is so wrong in trying to solidify this family. He says the job is only the first step. The next thing is she will lock someone in a cabin or push them off a cliff. He says no one knows what she is up to until it is too late and he is not taking that risk. Eric is now just as much a hostage as he was. She asks him to go out the back door as she does not want Eric to see him and be upset. She says that Eric will never get rid of her. Liam says never say never. Steffy confirms to Ridge that there is a way to get Quinn out of the company and out of her grandfather's life too. He does not want her to owe the job to Quinn. Liam walks in and says he just came from seeing Quinn and she is just barely holding it together. She is dangerous and someday a gentle person is going to get on her bad side and there is no accounting for what she will do. Katie tells Eric that she is ready to move on and it no longer upsets her that Brooke and Bill are together. Her marriage to Bill was toxic. Quinn sees around the door and listens in as Katie confides in Eric. Alone Liam tells Steffy that she knows he supports her but not this with Quinn. She says she has thought about being CEO for years, not someday, but the offer is now. He says yes but from Quinn. It should be on her own terms but not from Quinn. Please say no, he does not want her anywhere near Quinn when she goes berserk again. Katie gives Eric a little kiss and thanks him for his friendship. She wants him to take care of himself and be his neighbor as long as possible. Eric goes upstairs as Katie retrieves her phone and when she turns around she is confronted by a very angry Quinn. They exchange words with Quinn accusing her of trying to steal her husband. Finally Katie can't take it anymore and says yes, Quinn does not deserve him. She is crazy. As she turns to leave, Quinn grabs a heavy silver candlestick and strikes her multiple times over the head and then panics when she sees her lying on the floor with the blood flowing.",
