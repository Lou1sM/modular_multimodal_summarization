Wyatt refused to believe that Hope could let everything they had go. Wyatt noted that he and Hope had had many happy months together.\n\n\nHope agreed, but she pointed out that she'd had happy years -- not months -- with Liam. Hope told Wyatt that Liam was going to make a great husband and father, and she loved him. Wyatt objected, but Hope said, \"I am ready for this.\"\n\n\nWyatt called Liam Yoga Boy, and Hope interrupted that Wyatt's disrespect for Liam wasn't funny. Wyatt begged Hope not to allow Liam to pressure Hope into marriage. Wyatt reminded Hope that Liam had always found a way to break his trust with Hope.\n\n\nHope told Wyatt that he was funny and handsome and easy to fall in love with. Wyatt refused to give up. He said that he knew they had something special. He could feel it every time they kissed. Hope agreed, but she announced that she was marrying Liam.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that their relationship was not over. It had only just begun, and he wanted to be closer to her. He had wanted to touch her, grab her, and he knew she wanted the same thing. Wyatt encouraged Hope to go with her feelings and not feel guilty because of Liam. Wyatt blamed Liam for stringing Hope along for years. Wyatt maintained that he had fallen in love with Hope with only one kiss. \"There will never be a Steffy with me,\" he said.\n\n\nHope advised that Steffy was no longer a threat to Hope. Wyatt reminded Hope what Liam had done to her, and Hope said that she had punished Liam for it, but she wanted that to end.\n\n\nWyatt maintained that he had wanted to travel with Hope and have fun. Hope said that Wyatt would be a wonderful catch for someone else. Wyatt insisted that they belonged together. He kissed her passionately, and they fell back on the couch, groping each other.\n\n\n\"This is wrong,\" Hope said, insisting, \"We have to stop.\" Wyatt argued, but Hope announced that she was marrying his brother.\n\n\nWyatt tried to persuade Hope that they needed to explore their relationship because of the feelings they had for each other. Hope said that Wyatt was special and wonderful. She regretted disappointing him, but she had made up her mind. Hope promised that Quinn and Wyatt would have other contracts. Wyatt argued that it wasn't the business he had been worried about.\n\n\nWyatt professed his love for Hope, and Hope admitted that she loved Wyatt. \"But I love your brother more,\" she said. \"I'm sorry. Goodbye, Wyatt,\" she insisted. Hope left and cried outside his apartment.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Bill and Liam discussed their living arrangements. Liam said that one of them would have to move out because Liam was getting married. Bill teased that he wondered where Liam would live. Liam explained that he had given Hope an ultimatum about marriage and booting Quinn and Liam out of Forrester.\n\n\nBill congratulated Liam for standing his ground. Liam noted that Wyatt was receiving the unhappy news while Bill and Liam were chatting. Bill warned that Wyatt would fight for his relationship with Hope. Liam said that it didn't matter because Hope was marrying Liam.\n\n\nBill questioned Liam's decision, and Liam noted that Bill had always maintained that Steffy was the whole package for Liam, but Liam said that Hope was the package he needed. Bill agreed to support Liam no matter who he chose to marry. Bill added that Liam should not underestimate Wyatt -- who would not give up without a fight.\n\n\nBill asked for help in sending an email with an animated stallion in it to Brooke. Liam said that it made him terribly uncomfortable, but Bill insisted that Liam had to help him. Liam refused after he had seen what Bill wanted. Bill was insistent, and Liam showed him how to send the animated horse, but Liam left the room and said he needed a shower. He warned Bill to take a cold shower and stop sending emails. \n\n\nBill sent the message with the animated stallion to Brooke. Bill laughed and was quite satisfied with himself.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Donna and Brooke looked at the stallion emails that Bill had sent recently when the new one showed up in Brooke's email files. Brooke told Donna that Bill had behaved like a teenager. Brooke maintained that it had to stop. Brooke called Bill via face chat and told him to stop. \n\n\nBill whinnied at Brooke. She wondered if it was some kind of courting ritual like a horse. Bill wondered if had worked, and Brooke laughed. \"Bill, what I am I going to do with you?\" she asked. Brooke hung up.\n\n\nBrooke talked to Donna about the emails, and Donna noted that Brooke had been flattered. Brooke agreed, but she said her relationship with Katie was more important. Donna left, and Brooke recalled Bill kissing her at Big Bear and Bill undressing her in Italy. Brooke smiled at the memories.\n\n\nBill also recalled times kissing Brooke. He smiled at the memories.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Wyatt tells Hope not to listen to Liam. Don't give up their relationship. Don't let Liam control hr. She says Liam is not controlling her. This is what she wants. He tells her they are a great team and after all they have gone through, he can't believe she is saying that. She says she is sorry, but this is the way it has to be. He doesn't know why. Wyatt says he can't accept this. He won't accept this. He says he loves her and he knows she feels the same way. Liam comes home to find Bill on the laptop messing around with a picture of a stallion. Liam tells him his day went fine, but it might not be for Bill. One of them is gonna have to move as he is getting married. Bill asks where he's going to live. Donna visits Brooke and tells her she sees Bill is still pursuing her. Brooke says yes but she makes it a point not to be alone with him in any room. But now he's bombarding her with e-mails. Bill asks Liam how did this happen. Liam says he gave Hope an ultimatum, him or Wyatt. He is probably receiving the news as they speak. Bill is proud and says good boy. Liam tells him he also told Hope she had to break all ties to Quinn Artesian. Bill asks if Hope is going to do that. Liam says she more or less has to, it was a deal breaker. Bill says he really is playing hardball now. Liam said he had to. He really doesn't trust them. Bill says well he knows Quinn does not have both oars in the water. Hope tells Wyatt that she knows it is hard for him. It is hard for her too. Wyatt says then don't do it. He doesn't think she has thought this through. It's only been a few months and look what they have accomplished in that short amount of time. She says exactly and she's had years with Liam. She says Liam is a good man. He's going to make a really great husband and she really loves him. She says she is ready for this. Wyatt says no, yoga boy is pressuring her again. She says that is another thing. The disrespect he shows Liam might have been funny at first but it's not anymore. Wyatt says come on, it was just a joke. She says no it wasn't and Liam doesn't deserve it. Wyatt says okay, he will call him His Royal Highness if that is what Hope wants. He says this is so out of the blue. She said she needed time so why is she ready now. He doesn't buy it. Hope tells him that he knew this was coming. He knew that she had a decision to make. Wyatt claims that Liam has been asking her for years but it never happened. She says yes and she has punished him for that. Wyatt says she is not punishing Liam for being with him. They have something and she knows that. She says he is funny, handsome and charismatic so it is easy he says to fall in love with him. He says he feels it, she feels it, every time they kiss. She looks into his eyes and says she is going through with this. He replies this is not something she should have to go through. She says it is what she wants and he has to accept it. He says sorry no can do. She tells him to listen. She is going to marry Liam and Wyatt is going to be her brother-in-law. They will still be close. He says he does not want to be close. He can not live with close. That is why it is so hard for him to even be here like this without wanting to hold her and touch her and even grab her right now. She says it can not be that way any more. He says yes it can. They are not finished. They will never be finished. Bill wants Liam to help him with a graphic on the laptop. He wants the stallion to be rising up on his hind legs. Liam says this is making him so uncomfortable; he won't do it. Bill cajoles him into it. Liam says he's gotta go take a shower. Perhaps Bill ought to take a cold one too. Bill sends the e-mail to Brooke. Donna makes her open it. Brooke looks annoyed and says this has got to stop now. Bill calls and even makes a whinny sound several times. She calls him immature and that this is not working. He does it again imitating the mating call of a stallion. He even manages to make Brooke laugh and ask what is she going to do with him. Hope tells Wyatt that she is not feeling guilty but this is the way it has to be. He says good, no guilt. The only person who should be guilty is Liam as he has been stringing her along and he would never do that to her. It only took one kiss for him to fall in love with Hope. Their first kiss in Big Bear and she had him. He only falls once, only once and there will never be a Steffy with him. She tells him Steffy is not an issue any more. She knows that now. She's gone and has her own life. Wyatt jumps in and says good, now they can have theirs. He wants to travel with her, find more jewels, have fun. That is why he invited her here tonight. He hates Indian food but he was doing it for her .and hoping they might do something they had not done before. Maybe that would change her mind. He leans in and kisses her ..several times and she responds. He unzips the blouse/sweater she has on and pulls her back to the couch. They kiss passionately many times until Hope pulls away and says they can not do this. Her blouse is open; his shirt is open to the waist and neither can keep their hands off each other. He kisses her again and says this is what they both want. She holds her head and says no, they have to stop. She does not want to lose Liam. Wyatt says this is not about Liam. It's what they have. She can't turn her back on this. She says see, this is why they can't even work together. He says that ought to tell her something. They are a powerhouse. She says it tells her that he is so special. He is so wonderful to her especially with everything that has been going on in her life. She is so deeply sorry that she is disappointing him. He only brings her smiles but she is bringing him pain. But he and his mother will be fine. They are the best and there are other contracts out there. He says he doesn't want other contracts. He says he doesn't care about the work. He cares about her. She says she loves him for that. He points out that she does love him. She starts to say no, then suddenly says yes she does but she loves his brother more. She says she is sorry. He's stunned, can not speak. She gets up and grabs her purse and goes out the door while he just slumps on the couch. Hope leans against the wall for a minute and stifles her tears.",
