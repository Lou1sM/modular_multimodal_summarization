Ivy asked where Wyatt was and grimaced when the doctor relayed that Wyatt was in the lobby with Thomas.\n\n\nIn the hospital lobby, Wyatt expressed that Thomas was ultimately responsible for Ivy being in the hospital. Thomas refused to accept the blame for an accident at the electrical panel. Wyatt argued that Ivy wouldn't have been near it if it hadn't been for Thomas.\n\n\nWyatt stated that Thomas hadn't thought of the consequences of his seductions. Thomas would do what he had even if Ivy had a boyfriend and if Steffy had told Thomas to stop. Wyatt claimed that Steffy had just started to trust Ivy, but Thomas had made Ivy look like a liar and a cheat.\n\n\nThomas accused Wyatt of learning about that night at the mansion and confronting Ivy. Wyatt replied that it was true, and Ivy had said the night had been a mistake. Wyatt stated that Ivy had told Thomas to stop, but he hadn't because he'd wanted another notch on his belt.\n\n\nThomas claimed that Wyatt was wrong, and Thomas cared about Ivy. Wyatt said that if it were true, Thomas would have listened, there wouldn't have been anything for Steffy to tell Wyatt, and Ivy wouldn't be in the hospital. Thomas denied that it was his fault.\n\n\nWyatt believed that Thomas had told Steffy about that night because he'd known it would get back to Wyatt. Wyatt guessed that Thomas wasn't sorry; however, Wyatt stated that Thomas would be sorry if he touched Ivy again.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Eric filled Ridge and Caroline in on Ivy's accident and discussed how hard it had been get regain Ivy's pulse. Ridge asked why Ivy had been in the showroom anyway. Eric relayed that Pam had stated that an upset Ivy had been looking for Steffy; however, Pam usually read too much into things. Caroline said it seemed that way at first, but Pam usually turned out to be right.\n\n\nCaroline wondered if the tension Pam had sensed had been about Wyatt. Claiming she didn't listen to gossip, Caroline revealed that she'd heard that another man was turning Ivy's head. It didn't sound like Ivy to Eric, who'd been around the couple enough to know that Ivy was completely devoted to Wyatt. \"Granddad's right,\" Thomas said, entering.\n\n\nEric and Ridge asked how Ivy was. Thomas relayed that she was recovering with her overprotective boyfriend by her side. Caroline guessed that took care of the rumors about trouble between the couple. Thomas instructed them not to believe any rumors about Ivy and Wyatt, who were \"on lock\" -- despite Wyatt being a joke in Thomas' eyes.\n\n\nEric left, and Thomas relayed that the doctor was cautiously optimistic about Ivy. Grimacing, he said that Wyatt had stayed, and Caroline hoped the men didn't get into it at the hospital. Thomas claimed he wouldn't do that to Ivy. \"Oh, good. So you can control yourself,\" Ridge quipped.\n\n\nThomas stated that the bottom line was that Ivy would pull through, and whatever had happened between the couple didn't matter. Caroline guessed that Thomas had heard the same rumors that she'd heard about another guy. \"You're right. It was me,\" Thomas replied. Ridge hung his head but looked up with a knowing expression.\n\n\nIn Ivy's hospital room, Ivy apologized to Wyatt about Thomas. Wyatt wanted her to relax, but she said she'd been weak and wrong, and she should have known Thomas had been playing her. Wyatt stated that Thomas had manipulated her. Wyatt relayed that the news about Ivy had scared him, and when she got out of the hospital, he wanted everything to return to the way it had been.\n\n\nWyatt felt that he never should have walked out on Ivy. Ivy said he couldn't have known what would happen, and he'd given her what she'd deserved. He didn't want to upset her by talking about it, but she said she was trying to apologize. She'd wanted to tell him first, but Steffy had beaten her to it. Ivy hadn't known what to say because she hadn't wanted him to feel different toward her.\n\n\nWyatt revealed that he did feel different. Seeing Ivy hospitalized and knowing he could have lost her had made him realize that the breakup shouldn't have been the last thing he'd said to her. Ivy said she'd realized how much she needed him, and she was grateful to have him by her side. They said that they loved each other, and Wyatt asked her to relax.\n\n\nIvy flashed back to the incident in the showroom. She couldn't get it out of her mind that Steffy had pushed her into the panel. \"She scares me. She's dangerous,\" Ivy said.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Steffy refused to take off her ring. She knew she'd messed up and made a mistake, but she told Liam that they couldn't let a horrible accident end their engagement. He said he'd warned Steffy not to get involved, but Steffy explained that Ivy had been the one to get in Steffy's face. She said she and Ivy hadn't fought, she hadn't attacked Ivy, and it wasn't Steffy's fault.\n\n\nLiam didn't want to hold things against Steffy, but he couldn't deny the pattern -- first Aly and then Ivy. Steffy didn't get it either, and she hadn't been looking for trouble or for Ivy to show up. Liam and Steffy agreed that she'd done everything she could to help Ivy. Steffy didn't want to be the source of conflict for Liam, but she said they were different people and handled things differently.\n\n\nSteffy hadn't thought it was a problem. Liam hadn't, either, but he guessed they needed to discuss it. She figured things were complicated, and they needed to simplify them. She decided to move out until they got married. Liam was disappointed.\n\n\nSteffy said she'd move back in after the wedding, but she'd heard from Liam that he needed time to think, to figure out who they were together, or where she fit in. Liam told her to hold on a second, but motioning as if to leave, she said it was best. Liam asked her not to go.\n\n\nLiam stated that he needed time to think, not time alone. He was concerned and confused about the constant conflicts. He was sorry that he hadn't conveyed that he believed Steffy. He said she usually acted on impulse and didn't always think things though; however, she always did what she thought was right, and she always told the truth -- even if it was bad and he'd be disappointed.\n\n\nLiam asked Steffy not to leave. He said it was their home, and they would solve their issues within it together. He felt that they could argue and support each other at the same time. He declared that he loved and trusted her, and they kissed.\n\n\nLater, Liam and Steffy cuddled on the sofa after sex. Liam didn't want Steffy to think he was judging her. \"Just my decisions,\" she uttered. He said he'd try not to hold them against her even in a disastrous aftermath. He joked that they'd \"leveled up\" that day.\n\n\nSteffy couldn't believe Liam had compared them to a video game. He said they'd survived. Steffy corrected that Ivy had survived; she and Liam had just gotten through it. Agreeing, Liam added that some couples fell apart during problems, but Liam and Steffy fought for what they had.\n\n\n\"What was it you said? 'I will never take off this ring!'\" Liam quoted in a defiant, girlie voice. Steffy chuckled, saying she never would. The two kissed.\n\n\n",

Caroline wonders if an argument ensued over Wyatt. The doctor tells Ivy that he is pleased with her progress. Wyatt tells Thomas that Steffy may feel guilty but this is all Thomas's fault for letting things get to this point and Ivy confronting Steffy in first place. Thomas says Wyatt can blame him for a lot of things but not this accident. Thomas says Wyatt is dead wrong; he cares about Ivy. Thomas says Wyatt is angry and he realizes he has to be the bad guy but he isn't. Wyatt says he knows he told his sister his dirty little secret and that is what this is all about. He ought to feel guilty for pouring on all this charm and this game he is playing with Ivy is over; Thomas will be sorry if not and Wyatt will make sure of it. Liam tells Steffy that he is not asking her to apologize but he did warn her not to get involved. She says they did not fight; she did not attack Ivy. She was not looking for trouble. He says he knows she did not want this to happen and she did right by calling the paramedics but these things keep happening on her watch.
