    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Eric walked into Brooke's office and noticed that she was hard at work. Brooke said that she knew that Hope's line had been front and center, but Brooke wanted to be prepared to shift focus in a different direction -- to the Brooke's Bedroom line -- at the right time. Brooke admitted that she loved basking in her daughter's success.\n\n\nEric agreed that Hope for the Future had been successful, and it was no wonder that Hope had two extraordinary young men fighting over her. Eric said that he understood that Wyatt had been making big moves to win Hope's heart away from Liam. Brooke looked curious and asked what moves Wyatt had made.\n\n\nEric explained that Quinn had said that Wyatt had planned a special evening for Hope the previous night. Eric admitted that he had always been impressed with Liam, but Eric added that Wyatt was a very special guy, and Wyatt had made a big contribution to Forrester. Brooke looked thoughtful.\n\n\nEric was convinced that Wyatt would go a long way in business. Eric and Brooke agreed that they had been very happy with the collaboration between Quinn Artisan Jewelers and Forrester. Eric suggested it could be a problem if Hope and Liam finally got married.\n\n\nAt Liam's place, Hope entered, and she said that she had passed his dad on the way. Liam asked how things had gone the previous night when Hope had needed to tell Wyatt that it was the end. Hope teased that Liam had gone all Neanderthal on her laying down conditions. Liam objected, but Hope teased that it had been a little bit of a turn on. They laughed and kissed. Hope said she was happy they were getting married before Christmas\n\n\nLiam wondered if Hope had completely cut ties with Wyatt and with Quinn and her company. Hope was evasive. Liam explained that Quinn had been a creepy mom who had tried more than once to mess with Hope and Liam's relationship. Hope agreed, and she admitted that it couldn't have gone on the way it had. \n\n\nHope acknowledged that Wyatt was delivering the bad news to his mom. Hope told Liam that Quinn would not go quietly. Liam announced that it was time for Quinn to stop interfering in their lives for good.\n\n\nLiam and Hope cuddled on the couch. Liam asked Hope if Wyatt had done everything in his power to change Hope's mind about ending it with Wyatt and the company. Hope flashed back to her passionate kisses with Wyatt. Liam said that he knew Hope had made it clear. He wondered if Wyatt's mother would let it end.\n\n\nLiam pulled Hope's engagement ring out of his pocket and asked if he could place it back on her finger. Hope smiled and sighed. She thanked him, and they kissed.\n\n\nIn Wyatt and Quinn's office at Forrester, Wyatt broke the bad news to Quinn of what had happened with Hope. Wyatt admitted that Liam had clearly grown a backbone and forced Hope to make a decision or end things for good between Liam and Hope. Wyatt told his mother that Hope also wanted to end the relationship between Quinn's company and Forrester Creations. Quinn refused to believe that Hope had made that decision on her own. Quinn hugged Wyatt, but she looked determined.\n\n\nQuinn advised Wyatt not to give up on Hope because they were in love. Wyatt said that Hope loved Liam more. Quinn insisted that Liam was forcing Hope to make changes because he knew that Wyatt had advanced his relationship with Hope. Wyatt agreed.\n\n\nQuinn said that Hope had to have been confused because Wyatt was everything Hope would have wanted in a man while Liam was weak and insecure. Quinn praised her son as handsome and a man of his word -- everything that Liam was not. Quinn reminded Wyatt not to give up because she knew that Wyatt had fallen in love with Hope the minute he had first seen her and kissed her at Big Bear. \n\n\nQuinn believed that Liam had let Hope down before, and he would do it again. Quinn said \"we\" could turn this around. Quinn wanted Wyatt to pursue Hope and maintain ties with the company \"for both of us,\" she said.\n\n\nWyatt apologized for losing business for the company, but Quinn said they would find a way to make it work. Wyatt wanted to maintain the business relationship because they had worked so hard to achieve success. He noted that they had been able to expand and give their employees things they had deserved in addition to not denying themselves as many things as they had in previous years. \n\n\nWyatt didn't want his mother to give up her new electric car. Wyatt angrily insisted that he would not allow Liam to screw with the business. He announced that he planned to visit with Liam, and he left.\n\n\nLater, at Forrester, Brooke visited Hope and asked about her evening with Wyatt. Hope shared what had happened and that she had ended it with Wyatt and his company. Brooke asked if Hope had been sure that it was what she wanted and that Hope hadn't made the decision because Liam had forced her into it.\n\n\nHope assured her mother that it was the right thing to do. Hope acknowledged that she didn't want Wyatt around Forrester because she had a strong attraction to him. Hope didn't want to be tempted because she loved Liam. Hope maintained that it was the best thing for everyone. Brooke wondered if it had all been Hope's decision or if Hope had bowed to what Liam had wanted, because it had sounded like Liam had given Hope an ultimatum.\n\n\nHope announced that she and Liam planned to get married at Brooke's house before Christmas. Brooke said that she was happy for Hope, but Brooke looked thoughtful.\n\n\nIn Eric's office, Quinn entered. Eric thanked her for the cufflinks she had made for him. Quinn gushed that she had been inspired. Eric asked about Hope's approval of the items that Quinn had designed for the spring line. Quinn grew serious and said that they had a problem.  Quinn announced that Hope and Liam were getting married right away. Eric was surprised. \n\n\nQuinn explained that Hope had broken all ties with Wyatt and the company the previous evening. Quinn knew that Hope had broken all ties with Wyatt and Quinn's company in order to appease Liam. Quinn added that the Hope's marriage was conditional on the premise that Wyatt and Quinn could no longer work at Forrester.\n\n\n\"You can imagine how heartsick my son is,\" Quinn said. She added that it was their chance to be successful. Quinn said that she understood that it was Hope's line, but she wanted to talk to Eric. She realized that she probably shouldn't have gone to Eric, but Eric interrupted. He said that he was glad that Quinn had informed him of what had happened. Eric promised to speak to Hope, and Quinn thanked Eric and hugged him.\n\n\nAt Liam's place, Wyatt showed up. Liam refused to listen to Wyatt, but Wyatt begged him for five minutes. \"I'm sorry,\" Wyatt said. Liam paused. Wyatt admitted that he had not respected Liam's relationship with Hope. Liam interrupted, and Wyatt apologized for his total disrespect.\n\n\nWyatt promised that he would no longer be a problem. Wyatt promised to respect Liam's marriage, and Wyatt begged Liam not to force Hope to cut ties to Quinn's company. Wyatt confessed that he was hurt that Hope had clearly chosen Liam over Wyatt, and Wyatt professed that he loved Hope.\n\n\n\"I am trying to tell you how it hurts like hell, and I can accept you are who she wants,\" Wyatt said, but added, \"I can't lose her and my job.\" Liam noted that it was all about Wyatt and his mother -- that was the real reason for Wyatt's sudden apology.  \"I am truly sorry,\" Wyatt said. Wyatt explained, \"We have employees. Please bro, don't do this to me. Let us keep our partnership. I will stay away from Hope.\" Wyatt extended his hand, but Liam looked suspicious.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam is trying to call Hope when she shows up at his cliff house. He says he did not hear from her last night and wonders how it went with Wyatt. He says he knows it could not have been easy on her but he hopes she gets now that it had to be done. She says yeah although he had to go and get Neanderthal on her and laid down conditions. He starts to deny it and she says it is okay; it was a little bit of a turn-on. He starts rattling off the check list. They are going to get married at her mom's house sometime before Christmas. And she has told Wyatt that he and his mom no longer are associated with FC. Hope doesn't answer right away. Then she says she is not sure he understands the importance of Quinn's line to her recent success. Liam says he does but he also realizes that Wyatt and his creepy mom have used that association to mess with their relationship. Hope says she knows, but what if they promise to keep it strictly professional. Liam replies that he doesn't think that is possible, at least not for Wyatt. He reminds her that Hope said herself that things couldn't go on as they were. She agrees. He says and Wyatt had to know that he would put his foot down eventually. So Hope did not say but he hopes Wyatt is telling his mother this morning and they are out at FC. Hope says yes although Quinn is not going to be very happy. Liam says well she can deal. The point is she is through messing with their lives for good. Wyatt tells his mom that he had this big romantic evening planned and instead Hope told him that she was marrying Liam. She's shocked. Wyatt says Liam must have sensed he was going to make a move and got to Hope first and laid it on the line. It was his idea. He finally grew a backbone. He told her how it was going to be or else he was gonna end things for good. And he tells his mom there is more \u0096 they are out at Forrester. Liam doesn't want them anywhere near Hope or HFTF. It's over. She gives Wyatt a big hug. Eric finds Brooke hard at work. She says Hope is not the only one around here with a clothing line. Eric says Hope has made them all proud and it's not surprising that she has two fine young men fighting over her and making big moves. At least that is what Wyatt is doing according to Quinn. He likes Liam but he has to say that he's very impressed with Wyatt. He's a very special guy and he really admires his focus and determination. He and his mother have made a very big contribution to this company and he hopes they have an association with them for a very long time. And there is no reason that it won't. Wyatt is certainly happy working with Hope and he only sees that as a problem if Liam and Hope finally get married. Quinn tells Wyatt that he loves Hope. He can not accept this. He says Hope has agreed to marry Liam even though he knows how she feels about him. Quinn says Liam has let her down so many times and he will again unless Wyatt turns it around unless they both do. Liam tells Hope maybe they should take the day off and celebrate as they didn't get to do that last night. He bets Wyatt did everything he could to change her mind. She thinks back on Wyatt's kisses and him trying to change her mind in not marrying Liam. Liam says at least now whatever future Wyatt was planning he knows that is over. Now Liam has this one little thing he'd like her to wear. He pulls out the ring from his pocket. He says it is shiny. She says it is beautiful and he slips it on her finger. She sighs and he kisses her. Wyatt tells his mom that he told Hope that he didn't accept this. They've been so good together and accomplished so much. But it's even more than that. She loves him. Quinn says and yet she is marrying Liam. Wyatt sighs and says she apparently loves Liam more. Quinn says no, Hope is confused. Liam is forcing her to do something she does not want to do or he's making her feel guilty for falling for Wyatt. Wyatt replies that Hope did say that he made it easy for her. Quinn says of course as he is everything she could want in a man. He's smart, he's funny and he's handsome .and he is a man of his word. Wyatt is everything that Liam is not. He is weak and insecure, everything she despises in a man and so should Hope. Wyatt doesn't understand then why doesn't she? He thought she needed time; that she was giving herself permission to look in other directions. Quinn agrees because the only other direction she has looked in is Wyatt's from the first time their lips touched in Big Bear. They were meant to be. He knew it would lead to something for the both of them. He knows she is worried about the company. She reminds him that he is her son and will always be her first concern. Almost defeated he says he knows, but before Hope brought them to Forrester they were struggling. After the re-launch that all changed. No more worries about payroll and denying themselves things like that electric car. She scoffs that is not important. She can return that. He says no. Liam can not screw with them this way or their employees. They have worked too hard. He starts to leave and she asks where he is going. He says he is going to talk to Liam. He's going to tell him that he can't do this any more. Brooke finds Hope and wants to know how last night with Wyatt went. Hope says it is more like what happened before she went to see Wyatt. She and Liam are going to be married and she holds up her ring finger. Brooke claims she is happy for her, but just a little confused. Hope says there is so much she needs to tell her .the biggest right now is that Liam is insisting that Wyatt and Quinn have to leave FC. Quinn finds Eric and he invites her into his office and thanks her again for his cufflinks. Then says Hope must be pleased with her newest designs. Quinn hesitates and then says they have an issue a problem really. Liam and Hope are getting married right away. This all happened right before Hope was to meet Wyatt last night. Obviously this was not what her son was hoping for. But Liam had shown up at Hope's and told her how it was going to be; that he was done waiting and they were going to get married now. And he also made the condition that she and Wyatt could not work at FC. She tells Eric that he can only imagine how heartsick her son is. Not only is he losing the woman he loves but a chance to build on a successful business collaboration. Eric wants to know if Hope agreed to this. Quinn answers yes. Eric says he is glad she came to him. He will talk to Hope and maybe there is something he can do. She throws her arms around his neck and thanks him and says she knew she could count on him. Hope tells her mother that at first she couldn't believe Liam was asking this of her .actually he wasn't asking. But it's Quinn and Wyatt go or she is risking losing everything she has with Liam. Brooke says this sounds an awfully lot like an ultimatum. Hope says she is not completely comfortable with his request but she does know where he is coming from. But the timing could not have been worse considering the evening Wyatt had planned for her. Brooke asks her if she is sure about all of this. Hope says yes, it is what she had to do for Liam ..and for herself. She doesn't want to be tempted at work. There is an attraction to Wyatt .a strong one and this will be best for everyone. Wyatt barges into Liam's house and grabs him by the arm and says they've got to talk. Liam says he is leaving. Wyatt says five minutes. That is all he is asking. Liam tells him to let him go. And he is pretty sure whatever he says is not going to change anything so he can save his breath. Wyatt says he is sorry. Liam is taken aback. Wyatt tells Liam that he has repeatedly asked him to respect his relationship with Hope and he didn't. He rubbed it in his face every minute he could. He says they are brothers .Liam says half-brothers. Wyatt say he loved Hope, still does. Liam says right there is the problem. Wyatt says it was a problem but not any more. Hope has agreed to marry Liam. She will be Liam's for the rest of his life. Liam is disbelieving. Wyatt tells him that he's trying to be as honest as he can. God this hurts like hell knowing that Hope will never be his, but somehow he will have to accept it as what Hope wants. Liam is what she wants. And to lose her and his job ..Liam says aha, so that is what it is, his association with Forrester. Wyatt says no. He meant what he said. He is truly sorry for causing problems with him and Hope. But forcing him and his mother out just when things are coming together for him and they have built up their business and trying to keep it afloat. They have families and employees that are depending on them. He pleads with him, bro, not to do this. Liam has got the girl; just let them keep their partnership at FC. He will respect his marriage and stay away from Hope. He holds out his hand to shake. He tells Liam come on, he can trust him.",
