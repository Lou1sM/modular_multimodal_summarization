Aly couldn't help thinking of Hope's predicament if Hope had only remained married to Wyatt for the baby. The women couldn't imagine remaining in a marriage because of a pregnancy, and Ivy figured that Hope was married because she wanted to be.\n\n\nAt the loft, Quinn noticed blankets and a pillow on her sofa. Liam entered, and she said Deacon always forgot to lock up. She assumed Deacon had slept on the sofa the previous night. It had occurred to Liam that no one had heard from Quinn since the incident. He asked if she wanted to know if Hope was okay. Quinn asked if Hope was indeed okay. He said Hope would be, but the baby was no more.\n\n\nThe morose Quinn said that the baby had been her family, but everyone liked to forget it. Liam replied that people wouldn't forget that she was the reason the baby wouldn't be born. Quinn asserted that she hadn't pushed Hope. Liam replied that Quinn hadn't pushed Hope or Ridge, but it didn't let her off the hook for the sequence of events or how things had turned out.\n\n\nQuinn told Liam to \"go to hell,\" but Liam retorted that he didn't believe in hell. She advised him to wait a few years. She said he circled like a vulture, but he asked her what other person had given a thought to her that day. She asked if she should feel grateful that he'd shown up to rub it in her face.\n\n\nLiam said that, whether Quinn believed it or not, he cared about his brother, who wasn't in a mindset to deal with Quinn. \"And you have got to admit that you need some kind of professional help,\" he added. He was sure she hadn't wanted to end a life. She asserted that she hadn't ended it. Liam added that she hadn't wanted to end Wyatt's marriage, either.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Hope had left Wyatt. Liam believed it was a matter of time. He added that when Hope did leave, it would be Quinn's fault, not Liam's. Quinn claimed that he didn't know anything, and the couple was probably bonding over the loss and strengthening their marriage. Liam doubted that Wyatt and Hope would just go on their merry way after the incident.\n\n\nQuinn shot back that Liam couldn't admit that Hope loved Wyatt. Liam admitted it but added that Hope would do anything to keep Quinn out of her life. Quinn murmured that she was thinking of moving away. Liam didn't think it mattered if Quinn moved to another planet because, after Hope had learned of Quinn's actions in Paris, the baby had been the only thing keeping her with Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn guessed Liam had arrived to say it was thanks to her, and she told him to get out. Liam asserted that he wasn't the one depriving Wyatt of what he wanted most in life.\n\n\nAt the beach house, Hope moped into the living room. She saw a table full of baby shower gifts. Wyatt offered to donate them to charity. Looking away, Hope asked if he should be at work. He replied that he was off that day. He offered to make her breakfast, but she didn't want anything to eat.\n\n\nWyatt thought it might make Hope feel better to sit in the sunny room, but Hope responded that she wasn't sick. He remarked that the doctor wanted her to rest. Hope replied that she was merely sore. He expressed that he was grateful because, \"if anything had happened to you...\" Hope replied that something had happened to her.\n\n\nWyatt believed that they'd have other children, but he understood if she didn't want to talk about it because it was too emotional. Hope replied that talking about it might be better because they might not talk themselves into accepting the unacceptable, like they usually did. He informed her that he'd gotten the restraining order the previous day, so Quinn couldn't be near Hope or the house.\n\n\nHope decided that it was best not to talk about things, after all, because the worst thing that could have happened had already happened. Looking frustrated, Wyatt responded that she'd said she didn't blame Quinn. Hope clarified that Quinn hadn't pushed her down the stairs, but if he'd kept Quinn away from Hope, then Hope wouldn't have been there in the first place.\n\n\nHope raged that Wyatt should have protected her. Wyatt gasped as she asserted that she'd asked him over and over again to keep Quinn away their family. \"And what did I get? I get a restraining order -- yesterday -- that nobody ever saw!\" Hope argued.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Hope saw that Quinn wasn't there. He declared that Quinn had seen it, and he'd served it to her. \"And where was I? In the hospital?\" Hope countered. Wyatt asked her to tell him that she wasn't trying to leave him. Hope didn't know what she was doing. Wyatt said he knew, but they'd recover from it and keep the promises that they'd made to each other.\n\n\nHope didn't know how Wyatt could talk about promises when he hadn't kept his promise to keep Quinn away. Wyatt declared that it wasn't fair, and he asked if he should have chained Quinn to a workbench. He thought he'd had it handled, but he reminded Hope that she knew Quinn.\n\n\nHope agreed to knowing Quinn and was astounded that Wyatt had turned out as well as he had. She said that he was strong, accomplished, loved, and respected. \"By you? Are you are talking in the past tense now?\" Wyatt cut her off to ask.\n\n\nHope asked Wyatt to be honest. She asked if he were tired of the sudden moments where he didn't know if she was being sincere or how she felt about him. \"Yes!\" he replied. She said the moments would keep happening because they both knew Quinn had engineered their marriage.\n\n\nWyatt disagreed. He decided that the reason they were together was the same reason she was thinking of leaving him. \"You always want what you don't have,\" he concluded with a sting in his tone. Hope felt the sting and silently retreated to the bedroom.\n\n\nLater, Hope returned fully dressed. Wyatt asked where she was going. \"Out,\" she replied. He reminded her that she was supposed to take it easy. He didn't think she was up to it. She screamed that she wasn't the one who'd died, and he yelled that it had been his baby, too.\n\n\nHope held in her sobs, and Wyatt said he knew she was trying to avoid the conversation. Hope clarified that she was trying to withdraw from a conversation that they weren't ready to have. \"No one made you marry me. Liam was late in Paris, and that was all the excuse that you needed. And now you're just looking for an excuse to turn around and undo it all?\" he asked.\n\n\nWyatt asked if Quinn had engineered the marriage and the baby, too. Hope wiped tears from her face. He acknowledged that Quinn had been a problem, and it was why he'd gotten the restraining order. He asked what Hope wanted from him. Hope closed her eyes, silently crying. Wyatt declared that he loved her. \"And this wouldn't be so difficult if I didn't love you, too,\" she responded.\n\n\nWyatt seemed taken aback by the words. Hope walked to the door but paused on the threshold. He seemed to hope she might turn around, but she closed the door without looking back.\n\n\nAt the loft later, Wyatt knocked on Quinn's door. She hesitated as she looked at it. She heard him on the other side, saying she'd better open the door if she ever expected to see him again.\n\n\nQuinn let Wyatt into the loft. He assumed that he didn't have to tell her anything, but he wanted to know what she had to say to him. Quinn stated that she'd been leaving, walking away from Hope. Quinn was sorry and said she shouldn't have been there.\n\n\nWyatt asked why Quinn had even had him and why she'd wanted to raise a baby alone. Quinn hadn't believed she'd be alone. She said she was too selfish for that, and she hadn't known that Wyatt would become the love of her life. Wyatt asked if she understood how unhealthy it sounded.\n\n\nQuinn asked if Hope was okay. Wyatt stated that Hope was physically okay, and Quinn asked why he was there. He opened his mouth to speak, but he hopelessly shut it and sat down. After a moment, he said that his and Quinn's relationship made them unfit for anyone's company but their own. Quinn insisted that people adored Wyatt, and he lit up every room he walked into.\n\n\nWyatt guessed Quinn thought it was the basis for self-esteem, but he felt that others found it obnoxious. Quinn said he should be home because his wife needed him more than ever. \"Yeah, I don't think I'm wanted at home right now,\" he replied.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Hope stood on the terrace and gazed down at the stairs. She recalled her fall and grasped her empty belly. She turned, and behind her stood Liam. He silently strode up to her and took her into his arms. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Despite her loving feelings for Liam, Ivy contemplates whether or not she sees a future for herself in Los Angeles. Fearing that her only friend may move back to Australia, Aly gives Ivy advice. Liam runs into Quinn and gloats about her being the reason why Hope and Wyatt\u2019s marriage may not last. Hope makes a brutally honest confession to Wyatt about her feelings towards him, their marriage, and Quinn.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Next morning Wyatt brings Hope tea in the sunny room hoping that will make her feel better. He walks on eggshells trying not to remind her what happened, but just grateful that she is all right. He says they are both emotional and they don't have to talk about it right now. But they can have other children. They will have other children. And he did get that restraining order against his mother so she won't be part of their life. She says his mother did not throw her down the stairs but if Wyatt had kept her away she would not have been there in the first place. He gets it; she is now blaming him for what happened. Liam walks into Quinn's who has spent a bad night and looks like death warmed over. He tells Quinn he doubts anyone has kept her aware but Hope lost the baby. She is remorseful while saying she did not push Hope. Liam reminds her that all her doings, stalking Hope, sending the selfie to Ridge, pushing Ivy into the Seine were all on her to manipulate things. It is surely time that she got professional help, like therapy, medication, whatever. She tells him to go to hell. Hope and Wyatt argue. She says he promised her over and over that he would keep his mother away and yet the restraining order only came yesterday while she was already in the hospital. She seems to be talking in the past tense and he senses she may be ready to leave him. She says she does not know what she is going to do. He has to know the only reason they are married now is because of his mother who orchestrated it all. Wyatt opines that Hope always wants something she does not have. She gets dressed and Wyatt reminds her she is supposed to be taking it easy. She says she is trying to avoid having a conversation that neither of them want to have. Wyatt says he lost a baby too. He loves her. She says this would not be so hard if she did not love him too. No choice, he lets her walk out. Aly and Ivy talk about Hope's first day home and hope she is better after a good night's sleep. And that being with Wyatt is just where she wants to call home. Wyatt goes to Quinn's who is hiding in the back. He tells her to open the door if she ever wants to see him again. He asks if there is anything she wants to say to him. She says she would never do anything to hurt Hope or the baby. She was trying to walk away and she is so sorry. He says Hope is physically okay. She wonders why he is here. She says he lights up the room anyplace he goes. His wife would want him to be home right now. He says no, not so much. Hope shows up at Brooke's and from the balcony re-lives the moment that she fell. She looks around and there is Liam. They look at each other longingly and embrace.",
