Steffy said it had better be, and an electrocution shouldn't have happened. The electrician claimed it was electrical shock, not an execution. Jake said they planned to go over the entire building to prevent further problems.\n\n\nThe men left, and Ridge questioned Steffy about what had happened to Ivy. Steffy admitted to accidentally pushing Ivy during a confrontation about Steffy telling Wyatt that Ivy and Thomas had exchanged kisses. Caroline and Ridge were shocked to hear about the kissing.\n\n\nCaroline reluctantly suggested that Steffy talk to Carter about the legal ramifications of the accident. Ridge agreed, but Steffy hoped it wouldn't get that far. She was on her way to see Ivy, apologize, and make sure that Ivy understood it hadn't been intentional.\n\n\nSteffy exited as Thomas walked up. \"So now you're kissing Ivy?\" Ridge asked. Ridge had thought Thomas had grown up and matured a little. Thomas stated that kissing Ivy hadn't been the end of the world, and he'd been honest about being the other guy. Ridge figured that single women threw themselves at Thomas, but the hunt was women who were committed to someone else.\n\n\nThomas said that Ivy wasn't married to Wyatt. \"Because that matters to you?\" Ridge quipped. Thomas claimed it did, and he and Ivy had bonded after the light fixture incident. He saw nothing wrong with expressing his interest. \"Of course she must be interested in you. How can she not be? It's you!\" Ridge said. Ridge was bothered that Thomas made plays for women involved with other men -- whether the women liked it or not -- but that habit was what would change.\n\n\nThomas didn't see what he needed to change or where Ridge got the idea that Thomas didn't care about a woman's wishes. Thomas repeated that there was no ring on Ivy's fingers, and he'd gone upon the signals he'd been getting. Ridge found it disrespectful to Wyatt to just go in and try to take Ivy. Thomas insisted that he liked Ivy, and if anything, he was helping Wyatt to step up his game.\n\n\nThomas figured Wyatt would consider taking Ivy with him out of town the next time. Caroline was shocked that Thomas had hit on Ivy while Wyatt had been out of town. \"What can I say? When opportunity strikes, a man's gotta act,\" Thomas quipped.\n\n\nAmused, Ridge said Thomas wasn't a man; he was a petulant little boy. Ridge stated that a woman was alone for one night, and Thomas had to move in. To Ridge, a man wouldn't do it.\n\n\nThomas decided that his father was unreasonably angry, and it wasn't about Ivy. He guessed it had to do with what had happened before and asked how many times he had to apologize for hitting his father. He didn't know why Ridge would let it keep him riled up when Ridge should be concentrating on Caroline and the baby. Thomas said his new little brother or sister should unite them as a family.\n\n\nThomas asked if he was right. \"No,\" Ridge replied. Thomas quizzically repeated the word, and Ridge asked if Thomas understood the meaning of it. Ridge roared that Thomas needed to work on himself and respecting women, and then he could work on uniting the family.\n\n\nThomas persisted in trying to understand where the anger emanated from, and Ridge asked if Thomas really wanted to know. Before Ridge could say more, Caroline yelled for the men to stop. Thomas refused because he was tired of the situation, but Caroline kept telling him to leave. Once again, Thomas said he didn't understand. In his view, families forgave each other, and fathers forgave sons.\n\n\nFinally, Thomas left. Caroline said it had been too close, and she warned Ridge about losing it on Thomas. Ridge asked how he could stop, and she said he needed to do what Thomas had said and focus on the baby. Caroline hugged Ridge, who maintained a stony expression.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor told Ivy that she wouldn't go home that day but would soon, as long as he knew that someone would be at home to care for her. Wyatt affirmed that he'd be there. The doctor left, and Ivy said it made a huge difference in her recovery to know that she'd be going home to Wyatt.\n\n\nLiam arrived and was relieved to hear about Ivy's prognosis. He asked how soon Ivy would be at work and joked that she only had so many sick days. Ivy revealed that she was worried about Steffy. \"First Aly. Now this,\" she said. Liam didn't think the two were comparable, but Wyatt noted that things kept happening. Liam asked what Ivy and Wyatt were trying to say.\n\n\nIvy stated that she was in a hospital bed. Liam replied that it had been due to an electric shock. \"Because I was pushed,\" Ivy added. He conveyed that it was one way to look at it. She said it was what had happened, but he asked if she'd been the one getting in Steffy's face. Ivy asked if he was implying that she'd been holding a rock over Steffy's head. Liam said Aly's death had nothing to do with it.\n\n\nIvy exclaimed that Liam could declare self-defense, but Steffy hadn't had to pick up the tire iron and hit Aly with it. Liam insisted that it had been self-defense. Wyatt reasoned that Steffy had a pattern and a knee-jerk reaction to push back hard. Ivy believed she was lucky to be alive.\n\n\nIvy said Steffy was supposed to have been keeping people away from the panel. She felt that Liam could go on defending Steffy if he wanted, but in Ivy's view, Steffy was dangerous. Liam felt that it had been an accident, and Steffy hadn't meant to cause Ivy harm. Ivy wished she could share his confidence.\n\n\nJust then, Steffy arrived. She said Ivy looked amazing. Ivy shrank back as Steffy neared the bed and told Steffy to stay away from her. \"Whoa, are you afraid of me?\" Steffy asked.\n\n\nIvy said she'd had too many visitors, but Steffy claimed she wouldn't be long. Steffy expressed how bad she felt about things and assured Ivy that she would never have to go through a terrible accident like it again because the whole system had been upgraded.\n\n\nLieutenant Baker arrived with a hot dog and retraining order in hand. He said that Ivy wouldn't have to go through it again. He presented a temporary restraining order that Ivy had filed against Steffy. Steffy couldn't believe Ivy had filed a restraining order after an accident. Lt. Baker corrected that it had been after an altercation at work that had caused life-threatening injuries.\n\n\nLiam was in disbelief, but Wyatt said Ivy deserved a chance to recover without wondering what Steffy would do next. Baker explained that it was a temporary civil harassment restraining order, and Steffy had to stay one hundred feet away from Ivy at all times. It included the workplace.\n\n\nSteffy couldn't believe what was happening after all Ivy's talk about wanting to be at Forrester and talking Eric into getting Steffy to rehire Ivy. Ivy said it had nothing to do with the job, but Steffy asked how Ivy was supposed to work. Baker stated that Ivy could go to Forrester, but Steffy couldn't.\n\n\nSteffy stared incredulously at Ivy. Wyatt suggested Steffy gather her things from the office to work at home. Steffy exclaimed that she was the president. Baker replied that the complaint was against Steffy, so Steffy had to stay away until the case was concluded. Steffy reminded Ivy that Steffy had administered CPR. Ivy just said she was sorry.\n\n\nSteffy didn't know how she was supposed to do her job without her office. Ivy yelled that she didn't want to be around Steffy. Steffy told Ivy to stay at home, and she could design anywhere. Wyatt told Steffy to calm down, but Steffy said she wasn't going to calm down. Baker grabbed her arm and said not to go any closer. Steffy looked at him as if he was crazy for touching her.\n\n\nSteffy suggested communicating through Liam and Quinn. Steffy wanted to figure out something because the restraining order wouldn't work. Ivy declared that it was happening. Liam said Ivy had been mistaken in the past, and she was mistaken in the new incidence. Steffy insisted that it had been an accident. Ivy asserted that Steffy had caused it -- again.\n\n\nSteffy claimed she'd be the first to welcome Ivy back if Ivy dropped the restraining order. Ivy stated that she couldn't return Aly from the dead, and Ivy had to protect herself from any little accident that might happen around Steffy again.\n\n\nSteffy said Ivy didn't have to have anything to do with Steffy, but if Ivy didn't want to, then Ivy should be the one to stay away from Forrester. Steffy asserted that it was her company, and Ivy couldn't ban her from it. \"I just did,\" Ivy quipped.\n\n\n",

Wyatt wants that to be him. Jake assures Steffy, Caroline and Ridge that the electrical panel is fixed and they will check out the entire building and make sure this never happens again. Ridge questions what did happen with Ivy and why Steffy has that tone to her voice. He says she can tell him anything. She admits she pushed Ivy into the panel but not on purpose. Ivy was angry and grabbed her arm so she pushed her. She was mad at Steffy for calling her out for kissing her brother. Thomas walks up and Ridge calls him on it for kissing Ivy. Thomas says yes and it is not the end of the world. She is not married to Wyatt. He expressed interest in her and there is nothing wrong with that. Ridge says yes it is, he pursues whether the girl is interested or not and that bothers him. Liam looks in on Ivy. Ivy tells him that she is worried about Steffy .first Aly and now this. Liam explains that it was just an accident and wonders what they are trying to tell him. Ivy says he can defend Steffy all he wants but Steffy is dangerous. Steffy walks in and Ivy cringes. Steffy says this won't take long. She just saw Jake and the panel has been fixed and this will not happen again. Lt. Baker comes in and gives Steffy a temporary restraining order compliments of Ivy Forrester. Wyatt says he thinks Steffy deserves the right to recuperate in private. Lt. Baker says it is only temporary but Steffy is not supposed to be within 100 yards of Ivy until the case is concluded. And it will be Steffy that has to stay away from work. Steffy says she will not calm down; Ivy is the one that can work from her home. Lt. Baker warns Steffy not to get any closer to Ivy right now and the complaint is against Steffy so she is the one who will have to stay away from work. Thomas does not get why he has to change. There is no ring on Ivy's finger so she is fair game and no disrespect to Wyatt. In fact he is helping him by making him step up his game. Ridge tells him he is not a man, a man would not do that, he's just a petulant little boy. Thomas wants to know why his dad is so unreasonably angry about this. This must be more than just Ivy. He says again that he is sorry that he hit his dad but he wants to get past that. This should be a happy time for Caroline so just focus on that and not this. Shouldn't they unite and be a family for the baby's sake. Ridge blasts at him to work on his behavior toward women and then focus on the family. They argue and Caroline tells them to stop and for Thomas to just leave. When he does Caroline tells Ridge that was too close. He needs to stop hounding on Thomas like that. Steffy says okay, but this ridiculous restraining order will not work so they can work out another arrangement. Lt. Baker says no she can not do that. Ivy says she needs to get on with her life. Steffy is dangerous and she will stick to the restraining order. Steffy says she can not do that. It is her company. Ivy reminds her that she just did.",
