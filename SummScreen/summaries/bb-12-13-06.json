She tells him that Shane would never hurt her and that Harry was the one who started the fight.  At first, Lt. Baker resists, saying that only the DA has the power to drop the charges.  However when Phoebe tells him she will refuse to testify against Shane, Lt. Baker admits that they have no case against Shane without her testimony.   He agrees to talk to the DA and get the charges dropped, but he doubts that her parents are going to be happy with her decision.\n\n\nAt the Forrester's, Ridge tells Thorne and Eric that he's concerned about Phoebe's infatuation with Shane.  He doesn't understand why Phoebe would be interested in a hoodlum like Shane when she has her pick of eligible suitors.   Thorne assures him that Shane won't be a problem once he goes to jail and adds that Phoebe is too smart to get involved with him.  Eric changes the subject by asking what they should use for their new company name.  Ridge is annoyed that they aren't allowed to use their family name.  Eric thinks maybe he can get  Jackie to convince Nick to let them use it.  Ridge doubts Nick will budge.  Thorne confesses that Taylor has a plan to get the company back for them.  He tells them about  her taking Nick on as a patient in order to get him to realize that running Forrester Creations won't make him happy.  Ridge and Eric think it's a ridiculous idea, but Thorne tells them not to underestimate Taylor and her plan, maintaining that it could be the answer to their prayers.  Before they can discuss it further, Ridge gets a call from Lt. Baker informing him that Phoebe had the charges against Shane dropped.\n\n\nMeanwhile at Forrester Creations, Taylor drops by for Nick's first therapy session.  She tells him once he becomes more aware of his subconscious thoughts he will make better choices and stop sabotaging his own happiness.  Nick is skeptical and doubts that subconsciously he wants to sell the Forresters back their company.  Taylor tells him he isn't happy and he is kidding himself if he thinks power and money can replace having love in his life.    She goes on to tell him he is now running a company that he doesn't care about, with employees that think of him as the enemy. Becoming annoyed, Nick tells her he doesn't consider preaching at him the best form of treatment.  He concedes that some of the things she said are true, but adds that he doesn't think he can put much value on her analysis of his life since she is obviously biased.  Beginning to feel like she's wasting her time, she accuses Nick of not having the guts to look inside himself.  Nick admits that he has had a lot of bad things happen to him but argues that's life and you have to roll with the punches.  Nick thinks he doesn't need therapy, but Taylor thinks he is just afraid to face it.  Finally she convinces him to open up to her and Nick begins to tell her about his childhood.  He tells her that his stepfather left Jackie with a ton of debt and she was always struggling to survive.  It bothered Nick because he couldn't help or contribute.  He tells her about how he felt good when he could help sometimes by bringing food home, that the sailors gave him.  Then, suddenly he remembers something disturbing and abruptly ends the session, refusing to tell Taylor what it was that upset him.  Taylor is still encouraged,  and before she leaves says she will see him tomorrow for his next session.  \n\n\nAt the beach house, Bridget makes breakfast for Shane and the two of them bond as she dresses his wounds.
