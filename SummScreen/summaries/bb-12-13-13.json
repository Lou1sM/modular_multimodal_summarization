    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Liam's house, Liam was working when Bill entered after a workout. Liam stated that Hope had been there to talk about Wyatt and Quinn. Liam thought it was a shame that Wyatt and Quinn had blown such a good partnership.\n\n\nBill was proud that Liam had handled things like a Spencer. Bill figured that after Hope and Liam were settled, Liam might be open to a relationship with Wyatt, and suspicion about Liam's feelings for Steffy would dissipate.\n\n\nLiam attempted to object, but Bill insisted that Liam would always have feelings for Steffy. Bill said that Liam had proven that his feelings for Hope were just as strong and worth fighting for. Bill reasoned that after the wedding, the concerns about Steffy would fade away.\n\n\nBill asked if Liam had spoken to Steffy. Liam stated that he couldn't have Steffy in his life while demanding that Hope remove Wyatt from hers. Liam understood that Steffy was a sore subject for Hope. There were too many bad experiences, and he refused to do that to Hope again.\n\n\nHope arrived at the mansion, and Eric assumed she wanted to talk about Quinn and Wyatt. Hope stated that the partnership dissolution hadn't been what she'd wanted, but they had to cut ties with Quinn Artisan Jewelers. Eric didn't understand it because HFTF had been doing very well.\n\n\nHope explained how Liam felt about her working with Wyatt, but Eric said Liam couldn't make choices about her line for personal reasons. Hope asserted if it was important to Liam, then it was important to her, and the Fullers had to go.\n\n\nEric asked how she felt about the Fullers and their business. Hope felt bad, but she was sure they'd be fine with the exposure they'd gotten. Eric reasoned that Wyatt didn't represent a threat if Liam and Hope were getting married, but she said they shouldn't ask for trouble. Hope admitted that she didn't want the temptation around, and she couldn't let anything interfere with her wedding.\n\n\nLater, Hope went to the cliff house, where Liam was alone. He asked how everything had gone and if Eric was onboard. Hope replied that Eric had reluctantly agreed to her decision, and they just had to clear up a few things with the legal department. Liam was glad that they could begin focusing on the wedding.  Hope said she and Liam had each proven that the relationship was their priority, and Steffy was finally no longer an issue.\n\n\nElsewhere, a tinted, silver Tesla with a Forrester custom license plate traversed the curvy Beverly Hills roads. The car rode through the Forrester mansion's gates, and a man in all black, seen only from the waist down, got out and strode over to the gate. Seen from behind, the dark-haired man touched the \"F\" design embedded in the iron gate.\n\n\nThe man strode into the courtyard where Liam and Steffy had been married and stared at an odd statue in the garden. Walking by the pool, he tossed a pair of black Speedos on the buttocks of a statue of a naked person lying on her stomach.\n\n\nInside the house, Eric poured two martinis and had a conversation with Stephanie's portrait. He said there was a lot of drama around there, and he wished Stephanie and he could enjoy it together. He remarked that it was quiet there without the kids -- and without her, too. Eric missed the old days and said the worst thing about it was drinking alone.\n\n\n\"I can help you with that,\" a male's voice replied. The shocked Eric turned and saw a man with his hand extended to Eric. \"Ridge,\" Eric stated. The men hugged, and Ridge looked sadly at the portrait.\n\n\nOn the jet, Quinn noted that she and Steffy were about to land but hadn't yet talked about Hope and Liam. Steffy said she didn't know Quinn or Wyatt, and Wyatt's crush didn't matter to Steffy. Quinn stated that Steffy wasn't a mother yet, but someday, Steffy would understand why Quinn was working so hard for her son to have a chance.\n\n\nSteffy theorized that if Quinn's plan worked, Hope would be with Wyatt, and Quinn's company would be in good shape again. Quinn insisted that Wyatt was her focus. Quinn was upset that Liam, who didn't even work at Forrester, could take away Wyatt's job, and she said Liam was doing it because he was threatened by Hope's connection to Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn knew that Steffy had a connection with Liam and still loved him. Quinn was sure Liam still loved Steffy and asserted that Steffy could go back. Steffy declared that she couldn't, and Liam was not hers. Steffy revealed that she'd lost him just like she'd lost their baby.\n\n\nQuinn said she was sorry because she hadn't known about the baby. During flashbacks, Steffy explained that she'd gotten pregnant, but she'd lost the baby when she'd chosen to ride her motorcycle. Steffy said that she was pregnant one day and then barren the next.\n\n\nSteffy explained that she'd left to give Liam a chance to have a family. She reasoned that Hope could give Liam what Steffy couldn't. Steffy asked if Quinn really thought Steffy wanted to fight for Liam when he was so close to getting what she couldn't give hm.\n\n\nLater, Quinn and Steffy arrived at Forrester International. Quinn felt bad because she hadn't known what Steffy had been through, and Steffy hoped it explained why she wasn't returning to Los Angeles. Quinn stated that it had made her even more convinced that Steffy should go. Steffy asked what it would accomplish when things were fine as they were.\n\n\nQuinn said that they weren't fine for Wyatt or for Steffy, who'd banished herself to another country. Steffy insisted that she wouldn't interfere; she'd done it before and felt terrible for it. Though Steffy believed Quinn that Wyatt might be better for Hope, Steffy had to do what was best for Liam. Quinn claimed to understand and decided to leave.\n\n\nSteffy received a call from Dr. Caspary, and when Quinn heard the call was from a doctor, she stayed to listen in. Dr. Caspary happily informed Steffy that the procedures had worked, and Steffy was able to conceive and carry a baby to term. Steffy began to cry, and she thanked the doctor. After the call, Quinn watched as Steffy allowed the news to sink in. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "While they are kissing, Liam takes issue with Hope that she has to go so soon. She reminds him that she is going to see Eric. He changes his mind and tells her to skedaddle. He says he knows this has not been easy on her but this too shall pass. After Quinn and Wyatt are gone, things will be easier. Steffy tells Quinn that she will help her set up some appointments if she will give her the hotel information. Quinn informs her that she'd hoped just to tag along with Steffy now to meet International people. Quinn tells Steffy that she'd still like to talk to her about Liam. She is the only one that can stop this wedding so please give her a chance to convince her to come home. Steffy says she doesn't know Quinn and she certainly doesn't know Wyatt. All she knows is Liam and Hope have been trying to get married for a very long time and Wyatt's crush on Hope doesn't concern her. Quinn says Liam has been trying and failing because he still has feelings for Steffy. And it's not a crush for Wyatt. Steffy will understand that when she is a mother. She's just doing everything she can to give her son a chance. And she's not giving up on Hope and Wyatt just yet. Liam tells Bill that Hope just left but she's on her way to talk to Eric about Quinn and Wyatt. He gave her an ultimatum. Bill says he is proud of his son. He handled it like a real pro, a real Spencer. Liam says it is a real shame as they contributed a lot to the HFTF line and gave it a big boost but then they blew it. Bill says he knows he means it now. But Wyatt is his brother and it may not happen right away but once he and Hope are married and settle down he is sure he will be open to have Wyatt around. Liam says he hopes Bill is right. Bill tells him that Wyatt said he'd respect his marriage. So once Liam has said his vows he is sure some of that suspicion will dissipate. Not just for Hope but for Wyatt as well. Liam doesn't know what suspicion Bill is talking about. He fills him in \u0096 still loving Steffy. Eric greets Hope at his home and says he knows why she is here. Hope apologizes and says it is not what she really wants but it is necessary. They have to cut ties with Quinn Artisan Jewelers. Eric doesn't understand since HFTF is doing better than it ever has. Hope says yeah she knows, but Liam does not want her working with Wyatt and she understands why. She respects Liam's position. Eric says he doesn't. Liam can not make decisions about her line based on his own personal reasons. Hope stammers that she doesn't have a choice. It's important to Liam so it's important to her. Quinn and Wyatt have to go. Steffy thinks she sees through Quinn's scheme. She will go back home to Liam leaving Hope for Wyatt and Quinn's little company will be just fine. Quinn tells her that her focus is on Wyatt. It is Liam who doesn't even work at FC that wants to take Wyatt's job and future away from him all because he is threatened about the connection between Hope and Wyatt. She can see where Liam might be missing Steffy. And she can have him back. Steffy blurts out that she left, she lost Liam just like she lost their baby. Eric asks Hope what about Quinn and Wyatt, and their business. Hope says she feels bad. She doesn't want to hurt anybody. They've given them a lot of exposure and she is sure they will be fine. Eric wonders what Liam is afraid of. Surely Wyatt doesn't pose any problem to him now. Hope says no, but why ask for trouble. Eric deduces that Hope herself does not trust herself with Wyatt. Hope admits that she doesn't want the temptation. Just seeing him every day at work .well this way is the best. She and Liam have waited a long time so she just can't let anything interfere. Bill says Liam still has feelings for Steffy and always will. But he's proven now that his feelings for Hope is just as strong and worth fighting for. He'll get married and these feelings for Steffy will fade. Liam says maybe. Bill wants to know if Liam has talked to Steffy. Liam replies that Bill knows he can not have Steffy in his life and then turn around and demand that Hope not have Wyatt in hers. Steffy is a soft spot for Hope .too many bad experiences and he is not going to let that happen again. Quinn apologizes and says she did not know that Steffy and Liam had a child. Steffy says she was pregnant, it wasn't planned and they had a few good months but she took it all away. She explains about the motorcycle accident. Liam did not leave her but there were complications and the next thing she knew she was barren. She wasn't in the frame of mind to think about adoption or other options. And she still can't. She just had to leave and give Liam a chance to have a family. Hope can do that so that is why she can't go back. Hope returns home and tells Liam that Eric reluctantly agreed to let Wyatt and Quinn go. Legal needs to look into a few things but that's all there is to it. She says they both have proven they are each other's #1 priority and Wyatt and Steffy are no longer an issue. At International Quinn says she feels awful. She did not know about the baby Steffy lost. But she is more convinced than ever that Liam belongs with Steffy. And it is not too late. Steffy says going back would not accomplish anything. Things are fine just the way they are. Quinn says not for Wyatt. Steffy replies that she has done that before and felt awful. She does believe Wyatt would probably be good for Hope but she has to do what is best for Liam. The phone rings and Quinn is about to leave when her ears perk up upon hearing that Steffy is speaking with a doctor. Dr. Caspary tells Steffy that the procedures worked and she has every right to think she can conceive and carry the baby to full term. Steffy blurts out she can have a baby. Quinn stops dead in her tracks. Eric stands before the portrait of Stephanie with martini in hand. He says it is a little early in the day but who the hell cares. There are hirings and firings, Wyatt and Liam, on and off again weddings .lots of drama in this old house on the hill. He only wishes she were there to share it with him. It's quiet up here without the kids. The old days, yeah, he misses them. And the worst part he has to drink alone. A voice behind him says he could help him with that. Eric turns around and Ridge holds out his hand to shake. Eric gives him a hug.",
