    "imdb": "Bill warns Wyatt not to get his hopes up about a reunion with Steffy. At the Cliff House, Steffy prepares to give Eric an answer regarding his offer to become CEO. Liam discourages her from taking the job. Ridge and Rick are both upset that Steffy was offered the position and feel that they should be given the opportunity to run the company again.

The staff meeting at Forrester Creations starts with a bang as Eric makes an announcement that even comes to a surprise to Quinn: he wants Wyatt to leave Spencer Publications and serve as head of public relations at his company! Rick and Ridge are outraged, but Eric reminds them that they are still head designer and in charge of Forrester International respectively. Quinn and Eric then make a heartfelt appeal to Steffy to accept their job offer.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam makes Steffy a smoothie and offers to take her to work. She needs this to make a good decision about running FC. He tells her not to forget who Quinn is or what she has done. Do not let her get into her head. Eric is excited about going into the office for his first day. He says it feels good to just be there and he does not have to make the big decisions any more as CEO. He has asked Rick and Ridge both to be there and he knows they are not that happy with him right now. Rick tells Ridge that Steffy does not have the qualifications. Ridge thinks she will do a good job but it is just not her time; he should be CEO. Wyatt tells Bill that Eric has requested he be over at FC for a meeting. Bill wants to know what is the catch that Quinn wants Steffy as CEO. He tells Wyatt that Steffy is ten times as smart as Ridge and he knows she can do the job but this is about matchmaking not just running the business. Quinn tells Eric that she is so in awe of him and she cannot wait to get to FC. Steffy says she has not forgotten what Quinn did. Liam says then she knows all of this is manipulation. He can go to his dad and get his shares and Steffy can get out of this altogether. They can start their own fashion house. She's stunned that he is asking her to leave FC. She reminds him how long it takes to even start a fashion house much less to get to the level that the Forrester's are. He says saying yes to this is saying yes to Quinn and she needs to protect herself and them \u0096 do not take the job. Bill tells Wyatt that Steffy has moved on and is even talking about marrying Liam so he does not want him to get his hopes up with her. Wyatt says he has no control over his mother so he will just let things play out. Pam tells Eric that she is go glad he is back and she tried to keep it low key but she did make a few lemon bars. They all gather in Eric's office but when Steffy comes in Quinn says they think it is time for a more feminine view and she hopes it will be Steffy's soon. Liam drops in on Bill who chides him for finally showing up for work. He had turned his office into a petting zoo for Will as it kept it busy at least. Liam chimes in that he gets more work done at home without having to listen to Bill yammer on and on. Steffy asks Eric if he is sure that he does not want to come back. Eric says no, he is fine doing some designing at home. He is behind Quinn 100% and wants Steffy to come onboard. When Wyatt joins them Rick is the first to ask why he is there. Eric says he wants Wyatt to join the Executive team. Both Ridge and Rick scoff that he has no qualifications and does not even look the part. Eric says he is impressed with him and thinks he will do fine as Head of Public Relations. And an added plus is that he trusts him. Quinn is elated. Eric says now all they need is for Steffy to say yes to being CEO. Liam whines to Bill that this is Quinn's latest efforts of buying Steffy for Wyatt. Bill says it is a wonderful job and it will be hard to turn her granddad down. Liam states that the job is enough but now they want to get Wyatt over there too; she cannot be more transparent. Is everyone blind to Quinn being pathological. Steffy has to say no to this. Rick asks Eric what does his other two sons get. Eric says quickly they get to keep their jobs. It has been decided. They betrayed him and let him down and he needs people he can trust. Wyatt qualifies. Rick will still be running International and Ridge can still design. Quinn says it breaks her hurt that Wyatt's marriage must be sacrificed but she had no idea that Eric was going to make this offer. He loves them all and just wants peace and harmony. She hopes they can put their feelings behind them. She tells Steffy that she has so much admiration for her and hopes she will give FC a chance. Eric tells her that she is so much like her namesake and she would be so happy today if Steffy would accept the offer and become the new CEO of FC.",
