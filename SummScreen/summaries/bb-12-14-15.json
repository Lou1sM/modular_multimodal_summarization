    "tvmega_recap": "Eric tells the group that all is well with Ivy, no complications. The panel was old and has been replaced. The fallout is that Ivy took out a restraining order on Steffy so that will present some complications. Julius tells Vivienne that he is not going to be Maya's charity case. They will find a place of their own soon. Then he is surprised when he learns that Sasha called and is in Los Angeles and is coming over today. He's not happy about that, her coming to the hotel room. He wants to know why she is coming. He just does not want a parade of people from back home coming because Maya now has money. Vivienne gives her a big welcome while Julius is cool. Vivienne says she has a job interview but Nicole will be right over. Nicole tells the group that Sasha is her best friend from back home. They have kept in touch through social media. Zende tells her to make this a drive by visit as tonight she is all his. Julius tells Sasha that he will ask them to take their reunion elsewhere as he is very busy. She mentions Julius abandoned Maya but look how she turned out married to a Forrester and is known around the world. He reminds her that this is not exactly living high on the hog. He wants to know why she is here. She says there is nothing wrong with grabbing the opportunity. She has kept his secret; now she wants something in return. She has been working fast food but she is capable of more than that. They are all out here, she wants to be out here too. She'd like to meet the Forrester's. He says no way, she is going back home. Sasha tells Mr. Avant that he does not get to dictate what she does or who she meets. She will survive until she finds something better. She will be careful and not drag inconvenient ghosts from his past. He says he has no cash to throw at her. She says she can make her own money and get her own place. She texted and e-mailed and no response, so she's had it with him. She is here and she is staying. He will just have to deal with it. Huff and puff all he wants but nothing will change her mind. He says okay but not one word to his family. Nicole comes in and they hug. Nicole realizes her dad seems upset.",
