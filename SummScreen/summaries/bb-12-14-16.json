When Steffy's doctor arrives for another skin laser treatment to remove the wedding band tattoo, Eric informs him that Steffy is busy to keep the appointment...

    "tvmega_recap": "Liam whines to his dad that Steffy has to turn down that job and not let Quinn manipulate her. When Quinn finds out that Steffy turned down the job she will go after her and all hell will break loose. Quinn is doing all of this to get Steffy back with Wyatt. Wyatt points out that Eric offered him the job as head of PR and he and his mother had nothing to do with that. Eric tells Steffy that he has trust in her otherwise he would have not offered her the job to take the company for the future. He needs her answer now. After very little hesitation she says yes. She gives Eric a hug and says she is so honored. Bill says this is a big opportunity and he does not see Steffy turning down this job. Liam replies that it is not an opportunity; it is a trap. Both Eric and Quinn welcome Steffy as CEO. She turns and tells Ridge she is sorry. Pam says Steffy better be careful or she will get burned. Steffy seems to think Quinn is doing better and all will be okay. Ridge says no, she has Eric under her thumb. Liam whines on that Quinn is not the kind to sit around eating bon bons and doting on her husband. She is cooking something up and with Wyatt in the picture they all know what it is. Rick and Pam have their say that this has always been a company run by family so why Quinn and Wyatt now? Steffy says enough, as CEO she wants them all to put their feelings behind them as she needs their help and support. Rick wants to know who will be President. Eric floors them when he says Quinn will be and Ridge will stay on as designer and Rick running International and they will share a VP chair. Both feel insulted but Eric says it is not open for discussion. Quinn assures them that she had no idea he was doing this. They bicker and Eric stops it and says it was his decision and his alone. She has proved that she can deliver and he cannot believe after the great way she has taken care of him that they would doubt her. They are a dream team. He tells Steffy that she and Quinn are going to work together and he knows he is asking a lot but he knows they can do it. This meeting is adjourned. Liam grouses that he cannot get hold or hear from Steffy. But he does not believe she will take the job. Bill says he cannot believe that she will not. Liam says maybe he believes too that Quinn has changed but he does know that his brother Wyatt has. He used to doubt some of Quinn's schemes but now he accepts and benefits from them so this works in his favor. Bill reminds him after all that Steffy is still his wife so of course he would be all for this. Liam accuses Bill of taking sides. Bill says no, but Liam could take a little of that caution himself. The marriage is in the process of being cancelled but it is not official yet. Removing the tattoo wedding band means nothing. Eric tells Quinn that he thinks maybe Steffy is beginning to think of her as the person she used to be and can be again .and so be it if it helps Wyatt too. Quinn says it means a lot to her. The tattoo doctor comes in and Eric tells him that Steffy is out for the moment so the appointment cannot be finished today. Wyatt and Steffy talk about her great opportunity and he assures her that Quinn has turned the corner and Quinn and Eric are good for each other. They are inspiring. The cocoon has turned into a butterfly or at least a moth. He takes her hand and says the band is fading but is still not entirely gone yet. Quinn could still be her mother-in-law.",
