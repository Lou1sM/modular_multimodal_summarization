Stephanie took it all in and made a few comments, but in the end, she told him just because she was having dinner with him didn't mean that she had all of a sudden become stupid.\n\n\nNick sat by a confused Bridget. He told her that he was sorry for all the pain that she was experiencing again. She asked him about his son, Dominick, the son that he shared with Felicia.\n\n\nFelicia spoke with the hospital while in a caf\u00e9. She told the person on the phone that she would be there after she packed. As she hung up the phone, she noticed someone looking at her and smiling. It was Dante. He approached her, asking if she was the one he had met in Cannes. She told him that she had never been there.\n\n\nBridget asked Nick why somebody always had to get there first, before her.\n\n\nDante started to tell Felicia that he remembered her dancing on the bar, and she told him that it had not been in Cannes, but rather in Nice. She asked why he was there, and he told her the story of how he had arrived in San Francisco. He was working for a company by the name of Forrester. She introduced herself as Felicia Forrester, and he suddenly realized that maybe they shouldn't have gone any further with their introductions.\n\n\nNick was at a loss as to what to do for Bridget. He told her that Felicia might have had other ideas when she'd returned, but he had told her the truth about being married and loving his wife.\n\n\nStephanie berated Eric. She told him that she was not fooled for one second and didn't believe his sudden change in attitude about Brooke. He said that he had told her what she had wanted to hear, and she commented that she couldn't understand how she could ever have fallen for someone so clueless about things. She told him that if she thought he would ever find out what she really needed, she would probably sign the company over to him. He asked her what it was that she wanted, and she told him that she had told him at least a hundred times in a hundred different ways.\n\n\nStephanie said she wanted Eric to become a father. She had waited years for that and was still waiting for it. She told him that even though their children were grown, they were still their children and would be until they took their last breath. She wanted to know when he would get that.\n\n\nStephanie started to fall apart then tried to tell Eric about Felicia, when Eric made a comment that hurt her to the core. He said that Felicia was not dying, and Stephanie looked at him with tears in her eyes. He stared at her, not believing what he had just heard and seen.\n\n\nDante asked Felicia if she had patched things up with the guy she had told him about, and she told him that it was all over.\n\n\nNick told Bridget that he was going to be a part of his son's life, and that meant that Bridget would be a part of it also. He had to know if she was okay with it or not.  She suggested that they talk with Felicia, and the two of them left to see her.\n\n\nFelicia was packing to leave for the hospital when Bridget and Nick walked in. Bridget made the first comment about Felicia leaving and possibly taking Nick's son without telling him. Felicia could see that Nick had told Bridget the story. Felicia told Bridget that she had not known that she was pregnant when she'd left before. She had been going through chemotherapy then, and after it had ended, she had gone to the doctor to find out about her missed cycles and when they would return to normal. That was when she had found out she was pregnant.\n\n\nThe baby started to cry, and Felicia asked Nick to get the bottle from the kitchen. Felicia went to get the baby, and Bridget saw Dominick for the first time. Nick walked in with the bottle, and Bridget stared at Nick's son while Felicia smiled at Dominick.\n\n\n",
