    "tvmega_recap": "Nicole feels a little tension but Julius denies that anything is wrong. Nicole shocks Sasha when she says she is pregnant. Nicole says it is a long story and no one outside the family knows yet. She is going to be a surrogate. Carter sees Zende take out all his frustrations about Nicole on the workout equipment. Wyatt wants to take care of Ivy and makes his place comfortable for her. She's back home and okay. She says yes as long as Steffy stays far far away. She is so dangerous and no telling what she might do. Wyatt does not want to go but says he will go to work just long enough to see that Steffy has moved out and then be right back. Steffy is still explaining to Liam that it was an accident and she needs him to believe her. He reminds her that the restraining order says she can not work here anymore. She says she knows but she is not going to be kicked out of her family's company. No judge will go along with that. She is not leaving this building. Ivy will not force her out! He says she does not have to like it but he also does not want her to get into more trouble. Steffy says it was not intentional that she pushed Ivy and she wishes she could talk to her and have her forgive her. Maybe Liam can talk to Wyatt and get thru to him. Nicole explains her carrying the baby for Rick and Maya. Sasha says that is awfully big of Nicole. Julius tries to rush Nicole back to work but Nicole invites Sasha along. Alone Julius tells Sasha not to get any ideas. She can stay here two or three days and then he wants her gone. Sasha is very impressed with FC but enough with the weather; she is excited to be there with Liam and Wyatt. And she wants to hear more about this boyfriend. Nicole needs to get something to Rick and leaves long enough for Sasha to glance around and spots a gorgeous dress she wants to wear. She hops behind the dressing panel and is changing when Zende walks in, assumes it is Nicole and peeks behind, both not knowing who each other is. Liam tells Wyatt that it must be good news to have Ivy come home today. Wyatt says yes they are lucky that she is even alive. He is sorry about the whole restraining order but Ivy did not want to take a chance and the only way she will be comfortable around Steffy. Liam says it was an accident and there must be a better way. He pleads with Wyatt to talk to her and get her to drop it. Wyatt says she is totally afraid of Steffy regardless of accident or not. Liam laments that Steffy does not need to suffer. Ask Ivy to reconsider. Steffy drops by Wyatt's. Ivy drags herself to the door but sees Steffy and says she is not supposed to be here. Steffy says she is here for one thing only. They are family and need to get along. Ivy turns to leave and Steffy barrels past her. She tells Ivy that she needs to tear up this restraining order. The next thing she knows Ivy has fallen and her head hit on the fireplace.",
