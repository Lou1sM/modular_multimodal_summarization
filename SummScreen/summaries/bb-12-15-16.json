    "imdb": "Steffy proudly welcomes Liam into her new office. He is taken aback when Steffy tells him that she accepted the CEO position and that Wyatt received a promotion. Steffy is hurt by Liam's lack of support as he attributes her new title solely to Quinn's meddling. In the photo studio, Rick rants to Nicole about Quinn influencing his father. Wyatt walks in and realizes that the new positions the Fullers hold in the company are not universally well-received. Quinn is surprised that Eric is willing to join her little manipulative maneuver that will hopefully change Steffy's mind about divorcing Wyatt. They receive an unannounced visit from Liam who is furious that Eric turned his back on him and is now actively pushing Wyatt towards Steffy. When Eric chides him for badmouthing Quinn, Liam reminds Eric that he also had the \"privilege\" to be Quinn's husband when she kept him at the cabin earlier this year. An angry Eric then accuses Liam of being unable to find his own happiness and announces that he no longer considers him a good fit for his granddaughter.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam barges in to see Steffy while Wyatt is there. Wyatt states that he will go out until the tide comes in. Liam knows what Steffy is going to say. Meanwhile Eric pays the tattoo doctor for wasting his time as Steffy cannot make it today. Rick bends Nicole's ear as he does not want to go home and get Maya riled up. He cannot blame Steffy but he does not like being passed over as CEO and she cannot see that Quinn is using her. Steffy asks if Liam is not going to congratulate her. She states that if she turned it down her granddad would let Quinn stay on so it still would not have been Ridge or Rick to get the CEO job. Liam only wants to know why Wyatt is there and involved. At home Quinn gets Eric settled and says he was quite the showman today. Eric replies that her son was quite the showman too. He likes him around. He trusts him and he is quite like his mother, the Madam President. She does not know where that came from but thanks him. Liam keeps on with Steffy. She tells him that her grandfather named Wyatt as head of Publicity. Liam laughs, sure that sounds about right as he loves to take pictures of Steffy and get on social media. She admits there might be some of that but where she lays her head at night is not in her job description so Liam need not blame Eric and Quinn. And Wyatt certainly did not ask for the job so he need not treat him this way either. Wyatt asks Nicole to be part of his team with social media and she is honored although Rick thinks Wyatt is throwing his weight around. Steffy asks Liam to stop asking her about this. Every male family member wanted this job and she was handpicked by Eric and it means a lot to her. Liam about crashes when he hears that Quinn is President. She and Steffy will be working closely together. She shows him her ring finger and says the fading tattoo is taking longer than she thought. Eric tells Quinn he might have made a mistake by sending the doctor away today as he is sure Steffy will hear and ask him about it. Wyatt tells Steffy that he is happy for her. He just wonders if Liam is. Steffy says he will come around. Eric tells Quinn that no one forced Steffy to marry Wyatt but they all want to blame he and Quinn for the failure of Wyatt's marriage to Steffy. She says Wyatt is over that now and she thinks Steffy will be soon too. When Quinn goes to the kitchen, Eric has to answer the door and it is Liam. Eric tells him this is not a good time but Liam puts his hand out and won't allow Eric to close the door. He charges on in and starts in on him for being brainwashed by Quinn. Says he has been there too. She was his wife as Eve first so he knows firsthand what she is capable of. Eric needs to remember his past and who he is and not let Quinn get her claws in him further. Quinn hears the loud noise and comes in. Liam accuses her too and warns Eric again. Eric says that is enough. This is his house and Liam cannot bully his way in. He tells Liam that he is happy and he is sorry that Liam is not capable of being happy and he cannot imagine wanting his granddaughter to be part of that.",
