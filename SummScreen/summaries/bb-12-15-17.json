    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Forrester mansion, Thorne and Eric discussed Thorne's feelings for Brooke. Thorne had intended to keep them to himself, but that had changed when he'd heard what Ridge had done with Eric's wife. Thorne said Ridge wasn't capable of committing to Brooke, but Thorne was.\n\n\nEric admitted that Thorne had gotten into Eric's head about Ridge and Brooke reuniting again. Eric had supported it, and he knew Brooke cared for Ridge. Eric just had to wonder if the reunion was wise. Thorne asserted that Ridge's latest thing with Quinn proved that Ridge wasn't good for Brooke, and Brooke need to be done with Ridge for good.\n\n\nEric believed that it wasn't up to them to decide what was best for Brooke, and if Brooke thought it was Ridge, Eric didn't think they could do anything about it. Thorne replied that they could set an example by showing Brooke that they wouldn't let Ridge walk all over them again. Eric stated that he stood up to Ridge all the time.\n\n\nThorne countered that Eric had made Ridge co-CEO. Eric stammered to explain it. Talking over Eric, Thorne said to fire Ridge. Eric saw firing as extreme, but Thorne said Eric could call it a leave of absence -- if calling it so would make Eric feel better. Thorne thought Ridge needed a time-out to think about his actions and how he treated people. Thorne felt that if Ridge couldn't change, Ridge needed to be gone from Brooke's life for good.\n\n\n\"Gone from Brooke's life?\" Quinn asked as she entered the room. She doubted it would happen because Ridge was probably proposing to Brooke as they spoke. Thorne asked what Quinn was talking about. Quinn didn't know it for sure, but because of the way Ridge had been acting, she wouldn't be surprised if Ridge did propose soon.\n\n\nOutside at a caterer's table on Brooke's estate, Brooke asked the kneeling Ridge if he was sure about it. Extending a ring box with a diamond ring nestled inside, Ridge affirmed it. He didn't have a big heart in the sand or on the Eiffel Tower, though, because he'd wanted to propose to her there, in the house where they'd dreamed of growing old together. \"You want to do that? You want to grow old with me?\" Ridge asked.\n\n\nBrooke said she'd never needed grand gestures. Through the years, the gestures had been nice, but she'd really only needed Ridge, his love, and his commitment. Ridge guessed that she wondered if he'd screw it up again, and she said she'd be a fool not to. He claimed that he'd be a fool to make a promise he couldn't keep. He could clearly see their future together.\n\n\nSmiling, Brooke said she could see the same future. Stroking Ridge's face, she stated, \"So, yes. Yes, I will be your wife again. Forever.\" Ridge took Brooke into his arms and kissed her. They expressed their love for each other and kissed again.\n\n\nRidge wanted to place the ring on Brooke's finger, but Brooke didn't want to officially wear it until her divorce was final. \"But there are certain things I do miss about our relationship,\" Brooke stated. With zest, Ridge said he did, too. Brooke said it was their long talks, but Ridge replied that he remembered other stuff.  Whispering into his ears, Brooke asked him to show her what that \"other stuff\" was.\n\n\nIn Brooke's bedroom, Brooke stared at her ring in its box. Ridge asked if she was sure she didn't want to put it on. She wanted to, but she also wanted to leave it there after she'd finally put it on. Ridge said once she did put it on, they'd have a lot of work to do, designing dresses and alerting the media. Looking around, he asked her why she'd taken him to the bedroom.\n\n\n\"I thought you brought me here,\" Brooke responded. Ridge said she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. The two began kissing. Music played as they underdressed each other and fell onto the bed together to consummate their engagement.\n\n\nLater, Ridge and Brooke were in bed together, and she giggled. Ridge said there was the giggle he loved so much. To him, it was life-affirming. Whenever he heard it, he knew he'd be okay -- they'd be okay. Brooke said that they were. Ridge said he was where he belonged, and he and his one-of-a-kind Logan had a future together. They kissed.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill was surprised to see Liam back at work. Liam said Steffy had had an appointment, so he'd decided to get some work done. Bill thought work was important, but he advised Liam not to forget what was first. \"Uh, money?\" Liam guessed. Bill said it was Steffy.\n\n\nLiam seemed as if he was about to say he'd guessed money because of whom he was talking to, but he cut himself off and instead said he knew. Liam planned to make sure Steffy knew it, too, but it might mean adjustments to his work schedule sometimes. Bill said he supported it.\n\n\nLiam remarked upon Steffy helping the men mend their relationship. Admitting that he'd been pointing out Bill's faults and enjoying it somewhat, Liam said that Steffy was the one who'd gotten Liam to see that he'd overlooked Bill's best quality. Bill believed it was his hair, but Liam said it was Bill's loyalty to his sons. Liam didn't plan to take it for granted anymore.\n\n\nLiam asked Bill about his evening plans, and Bill deterred Liam from inviting him over. Bill had no interest in being a third wheel. \"Oh, give me a break. Just come over. Let us feed you,\" Liam replied. Bill said Steffy and Liam didn't need \"daddy tagging along.\" Liam replied that his wife appreciated daddy as much as Liam did.\n\n\nBill took a stiff and silent sip of his drink in response. Liam decided that he was being insensitive to go on about how lucky he was to have someone. Liam knew it hurt Bill a lot, and Liam was sorry.\n\n\nBill expressed that, for a brief time, he'd had exactly who he'd wanted, but he'd never have her again. He'd had to come to terms with it. He didn't begrudge Liam's happiness, and he didn't want Liam to apologize for it. Bill advised Liam to go and be with Steffy.\n\n\nLiam thanked \"pop\" for always being there, and he left. Thoughts of sex with Steffy crept into Bill's mind.\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, Steffy's doctor greeted her and asked how she was doing. Steffy mentioned mild stress, but she assured the doctor it was under control. Dr. Campbell decided to take some samples and run some tests. They chatted about Steffy's health habits, and Dr. Campbell asked whether Steffy's stress was work-related or personal.\n\n\nSteffy claimed that it wasn't that serious. Dr. Campbell began to offer a way for Steffy to talk about it with someone, but Steffy insisted that she was fine. The doctor instructed Steffy to get dressed while the doctor checked on the tests. After the doctor had left the room, Steffy said to herself that she was not stressed anymore.\n\n\nAs Steffy waited, Liam entered her exam room. She expressed surprise and asked if he knew it was just a checkup. Though it might be weird, Liam just wanted her to know that he was there for her whenever.\n\n\nDr. Campbell returned with test results. Steffy introduced her to Liam, and Dr. Campbell asked if it was okay to discuss the results in front of him. It was, but Steffy asked what there was to discuss. Dr. Campbell said blood and urine tests had detected something. Liam asked if there was a problem. Dr. Campbell said it would only be a problem if they didn't want to be parents.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy expressed shock, surprise, and joy. Steffy had never thought it would happen after her history. Dr. Campbell said they'd monitor Steffy, but there was no reason she couldn't carry it to term. Liam thanked the doctor, but Dr. Campbell said they'd done all the work.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy hugged each other. Flashes of having sex with Bill flashed through her mind, and Steffy's smile faded.\n\n\n",
