    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Eric's house, Ridge was emotional as Eric remarked upon his son's return to town. Ridge stared at Stephanie's portrait and noted that her pose seemed cold and guarded. Eric replied that it had been one side of Stephanie that Ridge might not have seen very much.\n\n\nThe men discussed how quickly the death had happened after Stephanie had refused treatment. Ridge wondered why he hadn't been there. Eric doubted it would have made a difference because Stephanie had gone off on her own. Ridge was sure that wouldn't have happened if he'd been there.\n\n\nRidge wished he'd been there, but Eric replied that Stephanie had insisted that Ridge not be. Eric relayed that she'd changed and hadn't held any anger or resentment at the end. Eric said he'd forgotten any grudges between himself and Ridge. Eric loved Ridge and was happy to see him home.\n\n\nThe men conversed about Steffy's visit and Rick and Caroline's wedding. Ridge wondered how Rick would feel about Ridge being back. Eric asked if Ridge were really back, or if he would cut and run again. Eric had missed his son and was puzzled by why Ridge had been away for 15 months.\n\n\n\nRidge admitted that he'd snapped under the pressure of heading two families. He'd just wanted to whisk Brooke away and start anew. However, her past had found her on the honeymoon, and Ridge hadn't been able to deal with it. \"I wanted a new start, a new life,\" Ridge stated.\n\n\nRidge said that the present seemed to just go away, and the future disappeared one moment at a time. All that remained was the past, and his past was right there in Los Angeles.\n\n\nEric asked where Ridge would be staying. Ridge didn't know, so Eric offered his home. Ridge joked that Eric wanted someone to clean the pool, but Eric said he didn't -- unless Ridge had gotten better at it. Ridge agreed to stay at the mansion, and Eric asked if Ridge would be there awhile. Ridge indicated that he might, and Eric asked what had made Ridge return. \"Brooke,\" Ridge replied.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Brooke arrived to let Katie know that Liam and Hope's wedding was happening. Katie didn't think she was ready to watch Brooke and Bill being proud parents of the happy couple. Brooke said she was there to let her sister know that she didn't want to be around Bill, but she didn't see a way around it because of the wedding. Katie replied that Brooke wasn't on probation.\n\n\nKatie believed that Brooke had good intentions, but Brooke wouldn't know what she'd do until she did it. Katie remarked that none of them did, and everyone was a work in progress. Brooke sighed, recalling that she'd always thought she'd be with Ridge, and losing Stephanie had made Brooke feel as if she'd had nothing to hold onto.\n\n\nAs Brooke prepared to leave, Katie said Brooke's efforts in their relationship weren't unnoticed; it would just take time. Brooke stated that they'd be sisters for life, so they had the time.\n\n\nIn Rick's office, Wyatt was packing up samples. Hope arrived, and Wyatt told her that he didn't regret a thing. He wondered if the Paris office would want him and his mother. The saddened Hope let him know that Forrester had processed a check to buy out the contract. Wyatt claimed that several of the best things in his life had been because of Hope, and walking away with more seemed greedy.\n\n\nHope remarked that she wasn't the same girl that Wyatt had met in the woods. She claimed that she'd gained a new confidence, level of success, and faith in herself due to him. She said that she hadn't been able to feel Liam's love because she'd felt second best, but Wyatt had helped her see her self-worth. Wyatt replied that jewelers noticed things that shined.\n\n\nWyatt looked around, wondering what he was missing. Hope wished that he weren't going. He wondered what would have happened if he'd met her first. He said he'd never been in love before, and he wished that he'd been better at it.\n\n\nSomeone arrived with a jeweled headband for Hope's wedding. Wyatt asked to see it, and Hope was uncomfortable as he noted that the other jeweler had done good work. He asked to see it on Hope because he wouldn't be there for the wedding. Hope resisted but put it on. Pulling a velvet box out, Wyatt asked if the headband would go well with \"this.\"\n\n\nWyatt revealed a necklace and said he'd owed her a piece of jewelry. Hope refused the gift, and Wyatt guessed it wouldn't be good for her to marry his brother wearing his jewelry. He said that he kept forgetting that he wouldn't be the groom. \"I was so sure...\" he added.\n\n\nIn Paris, Quinn set her things down and asked if Steffy had received good news. The tearful Steffy stated that \"she'd\" forgiven her. Quinn asked who Steffy meant. Steffy said that \"her\" name would have been Aspen.\n\n\nSteffy's assistant, Sophie, entered, and Steffy asked Sophie to locate Ridge. Sophie said Ridge had gone to Los Angeles. Quinn guessed that Ridge and Steffy could have flown together if they'd known of each other's trips. Steffy disagreed, saying her trip had been personal -- and Ridge's could be, too.\n\n\nSteffy wrote out a check and asked Quinn to take it to a fertility clinic in Los Angeles. Quinn thought it was an enormous gift, but Steffy replied that it didn't compare to what the clinic had given her. Steffy began to worry about her father's trip, and Quinn offered to take Steffy back to L.A. with her. Steffy quipped that if Ridge had wanted company, he would have asked for it.\n\n\nSteffy had wanted to tell Ridge her news, but Quinn asked if there was anyone else whom Steffy wanted to tell it to. Quinn reasoned that Liam needed to heal, too. Steffy snapped that Quinn was in her personal business as if Quinn belonged there, and she warned Quinn not to say anything to Liam.\n\n\nQuinn claimed that she wouldn't do such a thing. Steffy said she was sorry about Wyatt, but Hope's blonde goddess thing was like a drug to some men. Quinn replied that she didn't think Liam was one of them, and Liam hadn't gotten over Steffy.\n\n\nSteffy doubted that Liam was telling Quinn his innermost feelings. Quinn claimed that she'd observed things, and she'd seen how cold, dismissive, and high-handed Liam was with Hope. Steffy said that Quinn had to be misinformed, and they weren't talking about the same man.\n\n\nQuinn stated that Liam had made Hope fire the Fullers, and Quinn thought Liam and Hope both felt trapped in their relationship. Steffy said it was sad, but it wasn't her business -- or Quinn's. Quinn stated that what she found sad was that there would be no wedding if Liam heard Steffy's news.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric hugs Ridge and says he's back. Ridge is looking over Eric's shoulder at his mother's portrait on the wall, says dominating the room as usual. Why this pose; she seems cold and guarded. Eric says that is one side they knew. Ridge says they shouldn't speak of the dead this way. Eric says perhaps it is a side Ridge never saw. He knows that she loved Ridge more than anything else in the world. And she didn't change much. Once she refused treatments, it all went pretty fast. And it wouldn't have mattered if Ridge was here or not. She went off alone. Ridge says she would not have been alone if he were here. Brooke drops in on Katie at the office and says she doesn't know if she has heard, but the wedding is back on. Hope and Liam are getting married. Katie says she is happy for them. Brooke says she's not sure when the invitations are going out but she hoped Katie would be there. Wyatt is packing up things from his office when Hope pops in. He wants to know if it is okay that he takes his samples back. She says yes, even the ones that didn't make it into a collection. No one is trying to take anything away from him and his mom to which they are entitled except she guesses they are since he's more than earned his place here. He asks if it would help if he said he has no regrets. His mother is pitching the International office right now. Maybe the Paris office will want them. Will she like him in a beret. She shrugs, it was never a question of not liking him. She offers there will be a check waiting for him in Accounting. He's surprised and she says yeah early termination will buy him out. He says no, they don't need to be paid for work not done. She says yes it is contract specifications. He says five or six of the best things that have ever happened to him came from meeting her. That's the bonus he is walking away with. Anything else would feel greedy. Hope says whether he moves to Paris or not she has to say this to him. She is not the same girl he met in the woods. He retorts that she looks a lot like her. She says seriously she has confidence that she never had before.....success and faith in her judgmemt. And all of that is because of Wyatt. She loves Liam but for a very long time she could not feel really loved by him. He returned to her like a default because she was there. But after seeing herself through Wyatt's eyes, she found her self-worth. She thanks him. He says it is what jewelers do; they see what shines. Steffy eases down into a chair. Quinn puts her bags down and comes back and says she is sorry but she couldn't help but overhear. It sounded like a doctor gave Steffy some good news. Steffy says at least she forgave her. Quinn asks who. Steffy said she never had a name but it would have been Aspen. She learns from her assistant that Ridge is not in the office but flew back to L.A. Steffy thinks that is odd since he hasn't been home in over a year. She writes a big check and gives it to Quinn and asks if she will take it back to L.A. Quinn sees it is a large check to the Fertility Clinic and tells Steffy that is very generous. Steffy says not half as much as they have done for her. She wishes she could tell her dad but not over the phone, but he's back home trying to find himself. Quinn says maybe Steffy wants to go back to L.A. to see him or someone else that she might want to share that good news with. Eric tells Ridge that he knows Stephanie told him not to come back because she was dying. She had changed some ..no resentments, no anger, she had forgiven everyone including Eric. He says he can't be to Ridge what she was but he is his father and any grudges they ever had between them he has forgotten. Eric says he has missed him, he loves him and is happy to see him home. He tells Ridge that Steffy was just here. Ridge says he knows. Kids want to be close but not too close. Eric says yeah he knows the syndrome. Ridge says there is not much to tell on his behalf so it's Eric's turn. What has he missed. He wonders what Rick will think when he knows he is back. Eric asks if he is really back or is he gonna cut and run again. Ridge asks if Eric is worried about his job. Eric says he missed his son and doesn't know what has been going on with him for the last 15 months. Ridge answers that he spent far too many years trying to raise two different families and one day something snapped. He thought he should just take Brooke and get away but how dumb was that. Eric says how many times he has done the exact same thing. Ridge says the past just reached out and grabbed him on his honeymoon and he could not have that again. So he just wanted to start a new life, something that Eric could have told him. Eric laughs that Ridge never asked him. Ridge says the present just goes away and the future disappears one moment at a time. And the only thing left is the past. He looks at his mom's portrait and says his past is right here. Katie tells Brooke that she is sorry but she thinks it is too soon. It may always be too soon. She doesn't think she can stand there and look at her and Bill be the proud parents of the happy couple. Brooke replies that she knew Katie might feel this way but she had to try. She does not want to spend any time with Bill. In fact she doesn't even want to be in the same room but with the wedding and all she doesn't know how they can avoid it. Katie thanks her for coming and telling her but she doesn't have to. Brooke is not on probation. Brooke says she just wanted things to be good between them. Katie says she knows but she also knows Brooke doesn't know what she is gonna do until she does it. But they are works in progress or a train wreck in progress. Quinn tells Steffy that Liam needs healing too. He also lost a child and his wife too. Steffy says Liam needs what Liam needs. And Quinn is wading into her business like she belongs there. She is not to say anything to Liam. Quinn says she never would. But she doesn't think that Liam every got over her. As he finishes, Wyatt asks what is he forgetting. Hope says she wishes he wasn't going. He asks her to tell him something. If they had met first what took them so long? She doesn't know. He admits he's never been in love before. He just wishes he had been better at it. Eric brings him and Ridge some sandwiches and fruit. He says they have Aly to thank for that. She's not exactly domestic but she has been taking care of Thorne. Eric asks Ridge to stay here with them; the house has so many rooms he needs a map to find some of them. Ridge says Eric just wants him to sweep the patio and clean the pool. Eric says no, not unless he is better at it than he used to be. Ridge says okay, he'll stay. Eric questions why now. Ridge says maybe because it's Christmas .but it's Brooke. Katie tells Brooke that she can see how hard she is trying and it hasn't gone unnoticed. It means a lot but it's just gonna take time. Brooke replies they are sisters for life and time they have. A young lady brings a wedding headpiece on a tray and says she was told Hope would want to see this right away. Hope asks her to take it to her mom's office. Wyatt says no, no, she should see it now. He asks if it is okay if he sees it. He handles it gingerly and says nice work. Then he asks Hope if he can see it on her. She doesn't want to try it on right now. He says he's not going to be at her wedding so he won't be able to see it later. Please, just for a minute. He puts it on her. Then says he wonders if it will go well with this. He pulls out a long jewel box from his pocket and opens it. It's a lovely one pearl necklace. She says she can't and even takes off the headpiece and says she just can't. He says he understands. Of course she can not wear a piece of his jewelry to marry his brother. He asks her to forgive him. She says no, there is nothing to forgive. Wyatt says he keeps forgetting that he is not the groom. He says he was so sure. Steffy tells Quinn that she is sure that Liam did not discuss his feeling with Quinn. She says no but she has seen the two of them on the internet and she can see. And she sees how he treats Hope. He's cold and dismissive and high handed with her. She has seen it herself. Liam made her fire her and Wyatt and she did it just to keep the peace. Quinn says she thinks Hope feels trapped and Liam does too. Steffy says that would be sad but it's none of her business or Quinn's either. Quinn says if Liam only knew what Steffy heard from her doctor today, she doesn't think there'd be a wedding.",
