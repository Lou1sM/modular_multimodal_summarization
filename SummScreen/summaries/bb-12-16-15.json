    "tvmega_recap": "Zende apologizes for thinking Sasha was Nicole and had peeked in on her. Sasha says she is not ashamed and doesn't mind that he did. They both admit they are not models but would like to be. She asks if all interns sneak up on their girlfriends. She is astonished to find out that he is Nicole's boyfriend, Zende. She tells him that Nicole is a lucky girl. Wyatt and Liam argue the facts about the restraining order. Wyatt says he does not believe Steffy did this on purpose but isn't it funny that bad things happen to Ivy when Steffy is around. Vivienne hopes Sasha will stay in town longer because of Nicole but Julius tells her not to encourage this. Sasha will not be staying in town. She thinks he sounds like he has something against Sasha and she does not know why. Ivy is out of it for a few minutes with Steffy hollering for her to wake up. When she does she tells Steffy she is okay but just leave this house. Ivy then calls Lt. Baker and tells him that Steffy was just here. She fell and hit her head and he must do something about this. He tells her to lock the doors and he will send a squad car over. Wyatt comes first and she fills him in on Steffy being here. A restraining order must mean nothing to Steffy as she would not leave before coming in. She did not come by just to see how she was. She wants to go back to work and kept brandishing the restraining order in her face. Steffy goes back to FC. Liam tells her to leave before Ivy might come and it will look bad. She admits she already has seen Ivy. She went to Wyatt's. He asks why she keeps doing this. She violated the restraining order. She says she wanted to explain. He says she has no choice. If she violates it she will be in big trouble. He is amazed that Ivy got hurt again with Steffy always the one to be there. Ivy tells Wyatt that she is not out to get Steffy but she wants her to leave her alone. Steffy tells Liam that Ivy is okay, she just has a little bump on her head. She wanted to take her to the hospital but she is fine. She says she knows it was dumb but she just wanted to talk it out. She understands Liam now that she can not even do that. Lt. Baker walks in and tells Steffy the second violation is no excuse. She is not supposed to be in this building. And he hears there is a second accident with Ivy; that is very serious. She realizes that was against the law. Liam says it will never happen again; Baker says you bet it won't, Steffy is under arrest.",
