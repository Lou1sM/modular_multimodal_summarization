    "tvmega_recap": "Liam stands there and berates Eric and does not want him to listen to Quinn any more. She did not even have to kidnap him or kill him. She has that place right here in his home. Do not listen to her. Eric tells Liam that he is biased. Everyone can change and he believes in Quinn. He listens to Liam rant on and on and he says that is enough. If Liam cannot be respectful, then just get out. He will not let him disrespect his wife this way in her own home. Katie is not mad at Brooke for turning down Bill and choosing Ridge. She too is doing what Brooke is doing, that is what is best for her even though that means living next door to Quinn; there is Eric. Katie explains that Quinn thinks she is behaving totally inappropriate and wants her to stay away from Eric. Katie denies to Brooke that she has feelings or a crush on him. It is just Quinn who is not quite right in the head and she is capable of doing terrible things. Liam says he is not being disrespectful to Eric but only loyal to Steffy. Eric says there is nothing he would not do for Steffy and that includes getting her back with Wyatt. Wyatt is loyal to his women, unlike Liam who waffles back and forth between his women. He only falls back on Steffy when Hope is out of the picture and then there is Ivy who he strung along so he goes from one to the other. Eric wonders if Liam had a granddaughter which son would he pick, Liam or Wyatt? Pam orchestrates with Nicole to have a big brass plaque for Steffy to display on her door \u0096 Steffy Forrester, CEO. Brooke does agree that everyone can change, even Quinn though that is a hard one to accept. Katie says Quinn hates her even though she tries to hide it. She cannot tell Eric as everyone in his family has and it did not do any good. Brooke advises her too anyway. Someday he will remember it. Wyatt asks for Steffy's hand and says the tattoo is fading but it is not gone, just like they are not. Maybe neither has to fade away as there is a waiting period for their divorce yet. Eric tells Liam that he thinks they all need to step back. Steffy is still married but is living with Liam. She has many followers on social media and thinks she may need to live somewhere else. He prefers her living there with them and Wyatt. Liam laughs at him for thinking Wyatt is the golden boy. Eric says at least he loved Steffy and supported her and still is. Eric says he picked Steffy to run this company and into the future and that is without Liam. When Liam wants to go on and on about the sword necklace to his neck and hopes it never happens to Eric, but it will, Eric tells Liam good night. He leaves and goes upstairs, leaving Liam to tell Quinn someday she will get hers. He opens the door and it is open wide, enough for Katie to be outside and hear their conversation. Quinn tells him that he showed her that she could do better than Bill and even Deacon and she found the best in Eric and she wants the same thing for her son. Wyatt is going to have Steffy and there is nothing he can do to stop it. Katie takes a picture from behind the bushes. Quinn tells him these days are going to be his last so he better enjoy them.",
