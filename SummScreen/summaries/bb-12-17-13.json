    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Eric's house, Eric wondered what had made Ridge return. Ridge told Eric that he'd missed Brooke. Eric stared at Ridge and caught himself staring. \"Seeing you in this living room again ...\" Eric paused with emotion.  Eric said that he understood that Stephanie had demanded that Ridge stay away, but Ridge said it didn't seem like a good enough reason anymore. He wanted to go back and start over.\n\n\nEric and Ridge hugged in an emotional embrace. Eric wondered what had caused the breakup with Brooke. \"I wasn't thinking straight,\" Ridge said.  Ridge babbled about Deacon and lies, and then he shook his head. Ridge admitted that he had snapped, and he shouldn't have.\n\n\n\"She lied to me, Dad,\" Ridge said about the text messages to Deacon. \"She lied to you because she loved you,\" Eric replied. Ridge said that he had snapped and grown tired of all the betrayals and family problems. Ridge said he had needed to find himself and be alone for a while. Ridge realized it didn't sound good, but he had needed to figure out who he was.\n\n\nRidge said that he'd discovered that he was a man who did not want to live the rest of his life without Brooke.  Ridge added that, before he tracked her down, he needed Eric to tell him what Brooke had been up to and what she had been doing.\n\n\nEric became thoughtful. He said that Brooke had been devastated by Ridge's rejection of her. Eric added that family and friends had helped her get through it.\n\n\nEric said that Brooke had tried to stay busy. She had relaunched Brooke's Bedroom. Ridge asked if Brooke had been angry or if she had missed Ridge or mentioned him. Eric said that Brooke had not talked about Ridge to Eric. Eric reminded Ridge that Ridge had been gone a very long time, and he needed to go to Brooke to fix things -- if he could.\n\n\nRidge promised that if he could repair his relationship with Brooke, he would never let her go. He kissed his dad on the cheek and left to find Brooke.\n\n\nAt Brooke's home, Brooke called Katie and left a message that begged Katie to attend Hope's wedding. Hope entered, and Brooke gushed that Hope was positively glowing. \"Could it be because Liam and I are finally getting married, and nothing is going to stop us?\" Hope asked with a laugh.\n\n\nBrooke pointedly asked about Hope's attraction to Wyatt. Hope admitted it had been nice that Wyatt wanted only Hope. It had been exciting, but Hope insisted that for her, Liam was \"it.\"\n\n\nHope added that if she had met Wyatt first, she might have ended up with him. Hope reasoned that Steffy had been the only thing that had kept Hope and Liam apart. \"She's out of the picture,\" Hope said.\n\n\nHope admitted that it had been very difficult for her to see Wyatt pack up his things at the office. Brooke noted that she hoped the break of the contract between Quinn Artisan Jewelers and Forrester didn't hurt Quinn's business.\n\n\nHope anticipated that Quinn would have the pick of many projects, but Brooke pointed out that the abrupt break in the contract might leave a bad perception in the business world. Hope panicked when she realized that people might think Quinn's work was unacceptable. Brooke added that it could appear that they didn't get along and had a personality conflict. Hope felt terrible.\n\n\nBrooke said it was unfortunate the way it had played out. Hope confided that she had to respect Liam's position. Brooke wondered if Hope was sure. Hope said that she was, and Brooke said that Hope had made the right decision if she felt it was the best thing for her relationship with Liam.\n\n\nBrooke and Hope decided to choose a spot outside for the wedding. Hope wanted to have the ceremony near the staircase because she felt it was romantic. Brooke agreed, and she explained to Hope how it had been the very spot where Ridge had returned to Brooke when Brooke had thought that Ridge was going to marry Taylor.\n\n\nBrooke remembered that she had been seated at the bottom of the waterfall and staircase, convinced that she had lost Ridge for good.  Suddenly rose petals had appeared in the waterfall. Brooke had looked up. \"And there he was, like he always had been ... until now,\" Brooke said. Hope reminded her mom that she had been through tough times. \"But you're okay now,\" Hope added. Hope left.\n\n\nBrooke descended the stairs and sat at the bottom of the waterfall. Suddenly, rose petals appeared in the water. She looked up in shock, and Ridge stood at the top of the fountain and staircase. They met at a landing on the staircase. Ridge handed her a rose. \"Logan,\" he said. He kissed her passionately.\n\n\nIn Paris, Quinn tried to convince Steffy to tell Liam that she was able to have a baby. Quinn pressured Steffy to tell Liam that things had changed before Liam married Hope. Quinn insisted that Liam had a right to know. Quinn warned Steffy that Hope had been very attracted to Wyatt, and Steffy needed to intervene to prevent Liam from marrying a woman whose heart partially belonged to another man.\n\n\nSteffy snarked that she knew Quinn had been working Steffy for one reason only -- to help Wyatt. Quinn admitted it. Two women entered the office, and Quinn displayed her designs. Steffy noted that the jewelry was exquisite. Steffy wondered how Eric could have allowed Hope to break the contract with Quinn and Wyatt.\n\n\nQuinn said that Eric allowed Hope to choose what went with line. Quinn noted that Hope and Wyatt had worked well together and were meant for each other in business and in their personal lives -- just as Liam and Steffy were meant to be together.\n\n\nSteffy admitted that Liam had been the only man she'd ever loved. Quinn begged Steffy to return to Los Angeles before she lost Liam forever. Steffy looked thoughtful. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Eric sits with Ridge and questions him about coming back to see Brooke. Ridge says yes he missed the family, the business, he even missed the traffic. Eric laughs that he will get over that soon enough. But most of all he missed Brooke. He doesn't know how he let her slip away. Eric asks if there has been any communication. Ridge says no, only thru R.J. But he has time now so Eric can fill him in. Eric tells him to be honest it was devastating to Brooke to lose Ridge at first but she adjusted. There were some distractions such as supporting Hope and Liam and the re-launch of Brooke's Bedroom. He says he is going to have to take some time to get used to Ridge being back. Ridge says it was unthinkable of him not being here when his mother died. Perhaps they can all start over. Eric grabs him and cradles his head toward him and gives him a hug. Brooke calls Katie to ask her again if she won't change her mind and come to the wedding. Hope walks in so Brooke says she will call her later. She tells Hope that she is absolutely glowing. Hope smiles and says perhaps it is because she is finally marrying Liam and this time nothing is going to stop them. Brooke says no one wants her to marry Liam more than she does, but she just wonders if Hope really wants to get married right now. And the attraction she has for Wyatt and certainly on his part that it doesn't seem it is going away. Hope admits that yes there is that attraction. He's easy to be with and has this energy about him and he only wants Hope. He's kind of like a wild child and exciting and anything could happen. And if she had met him first then maybe it could happen but she met Liam first. And he's always been it for her always. The only thing standing in their way was Steffy and now she isn't an issue. She's gone, out of the picture. So as of their wedding, it will only be Liam and Hope. Brooks asks if she knows what Quinn and Wyatt are gonna do now that they are out at FC. Hope says no, but they have given them so much exposure that she thinks they can have their pick of any project they want. Brooke says other houses may think they are a problem, not with designs but their personality. Hope says that makes her feel worse than she already does as that is a valid point. But she says they are so talented that she can't help but believe they will land somewhere else and be even more successful. She confides in Brooke that she just saw Wyatt while he was clearing out his office. He tired to put on a happy face but she could tell how devastated he was. But she has to respect Liam's position and he wanted her to cut all ties, even professionally. And it doesn't matter if there is an attraction to Wyatt. Attractions come and go but love is what sticks. And if it means this much to Liam, then she has to consider it. It is what she can do for him even at her own personal cost. In Paris Quinn tells Steffy that she is not seeing the big picture. She's isolated herself here and convinced herself that she has done the right thing by making a gift of Liam to Hope. Steffy says it was the right thing. Quinn says maybe at the time but her circumstances have vastly changed. She's had procedures since then so she can conceive. Steffy says she is not going to tell Liam that. Quinn keeps arguing and says that is why she does need to go back to Liam and tell him they have their miracle and let him decide what to do next. He can have that family with Steffy now. Marrying Hope isn't supposed to happen. Steffy replies Quinn could care less about any of this if she were not working an agenda for her son. Quinn holds up her hand and says guilty as charged. She wants to give her son whatever it takes to make him happy and that is Hope. She is attracted to him too so is that what Steffy wants for Liam .to marry a woman who has feelings for another man ..his own brother. Steffy and Quinn are interrupted by some of the International people who need to see Quinn's designs. Quinn tells Steffy that she really ought to come back to L.A. and see how well Hope and Wyatt work together. It's like she mentions something and poof he makes it happen. Surely Steffy does not want Lima to marry a woman who has feelings for another man, and they are not going away like that. She guarantees Liam is going to get hurt unless Steffy stops this wedding. So she needs to go back and claim Liam. This is her one shot or she will lose him to Hope forever. Eric has never interfered before but he says he only knows something about a text to Deacon. How could that be so upsetting that he would leave Brooke for that. Ridge tries to explain, but it came down to Brooke lied to him. She said there was no commutation with Deacon but there it was on her phone. Ridge says that he snapped. He realizes what he did now but at the time all he saw was betrayal. He saw a way to get away from her, the family, the city. He had not been alone for so long and he just wanted a way to meet himself again. And he knows what he's not. He's not a man that wants to spend the rest of his days without Brooke. So Eric needs to tell him what he needs to know before he tracks her down. Eric says he has said all he is going to. Brooke was hurt but with the help of family and friends she got through it and she is okay now. Ridge asks if she ever talks about him. Eric says no but that's because it probably is too painful. So just go to her and keep an open heart. Ridge admits he has made mistakes and now he is gonna try and fix them. And if he can win her back, he will never let her go. He gives his dad a big kiss on the cheek. Brooks walks around with Hope on the grounds and shows her where some of the flower arrangements will be. Hope comments that she loves the staircase, it is so romantic. Brooke says with the right man, she has no idea. Brooke convinces Hope to go on. She needs her beauty sleep. Brooke sits on a bench overlooking the cascading fountain. Suddenly she looks up and there are flower petals floating down toward her. She looks up as only one person could do that. She can't believe her eyes. It's Ridge and he's smiling and now walking down the steps toward her. She walks toward him. He has a pink rose in his hands and hands it to her. The only word he says is Logan and gives her a big, passionate kiss which she returns.",
