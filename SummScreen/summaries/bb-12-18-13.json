    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke and Ridge reunited. \"Did you miss me?\" Ridge asked, adding, \"I'm back.\" Brooke reminded Ridge that every time she had talked to him, he had been cold and distant. She wondered why he had never said anything about reuniting.\n\n\n\"I wanted to, but what I really wanted was to be here and hold you like this. It's been too long,\" Ridge said. Ridge understood that Brooke had many questions, and he promised to answer them. \"I'm sorry I hurt you,\" he said.\n\n\nBrooke walked away and paced. Then she hauled off and slapped Ridge. She screamed at him that he had left her on their honeymoon. \"I'm sorry for all of it,\" Ridge said. Ridge promised to make it all up to Brooke and promised it would never happen again. He wanted their family back together.\n\n\nBrooke turned away in disbelief because she had never thought that Ridge would return. \"I missed you,\" Ridge said. Brooke cried and threw her arms around him and tearfully admitted that she had missed him. Brooke explained that Hope was getting married at her house, and Brooke wanted to know if R.J. had returned with Ridge.\n\n\nRidge explained that R.J. had to finish the school term in Europe. Ridge had wanted to return to Los Angeles with R.J. to live. Brooke uncomfortably wondered where Ridge planned to stay. She reminded him of Hope's wedding at her home. Ridge planned to stay with Eric until they could sort things out.\n\n\nRidge said that he had enjoyed his time in Paris with Steffy and Thomas. Ridge added that he had rediscovered his passion as an artist and a designer, and he had realized that he could not live without Brooke. Ridge hugged Brooke, and he left. Brooke cried.\n\n\nAt Liam's house, Hope and Liam joked about preparations for their wedding. Hope teased that Liam needed to show up properly dressed -- a reference to one of the many failed weddings that Hope and Liam had attempted when Liam had shown up with a tattoo on his face and wild-colored hair.\n\n\nHope and Liam cuddled, and Hope said that she was nervous about everything, except Steffy showing up on their wedding day. \"Or any other day,\" Liam said. Liam added that they no longer had to worry about Steffy, Wyatt, Wyatt's crazy mom, or Liam's dad. \"No surprises,\" said Liam.\n\n\nLiam teased that saying Steffy's name didn't make her magically appear. They stopped and looked around the room and under pillows as if Steffy could be there. Hope admitted that she considered Steffy to be the boogeyman. Liam understood how sensitive Hope was about Steffy. Hope said she knew that Steffy was ancient history.\n\n\nAt Eric's house, Donna delivered papers for Eric to sign. Eric grabbed her hand and said that it was thoughtful of her to check on him. Donna admitted that she had been worried about him. Eric confessed that he had received a surprise earlier. Ridge had arrived and planned to stay.\n\n\nEric added that Ridge had planned to reconnect with Brooke. Donna wondered if Eric had told Ridge about Bill and Brooke, but Eric said that it was not his place. Donna said that Ridge had to have heard about Brooke and Bill, but Eric said that Ridge seemed completely unaware of the relationship. Ridge had headed over to Brooke's house.\n\n\nDonna wondered what Brooke would do because Bill wanted Brooke back, and Donna knew that Brooke was passionate about Bill. Donna added that Ridge had been the love of Brooke's life, but when Ridge found out about Brooke and Bill, it might be a deal breaker.\n\n\nIn Paris, Quinn continued to pressure Steffy to return to Los Angeles and stop Hope and Liam's wedding. Steffy refused because she had told Liam to be with Hope. Quinn argued that Steffy had to do it for Liam because Hope had been interested in Wyatt, and it was unfair to Liam. \"If a marriage starts out like that, what are the odds it's going to last?\" Quinn asked.\n\n\nQuinn insisted that Steffy had to wonder if Steffy's ability to have a baby would make a difference to Liam. Quinn maintained that if Steffy told Liam, it would give Liam a chance to make his mind up about whether to marry Hope or return to Steffy. Steffy agreed to return to Los Angeles with Quinn.\n\n\nOn the plane, Steffy nervously rethought her decision. Steffy recalled romantic times with Liam and their weddings. Steffy lamented that Hope had always maintained that Liam and Hope would have been happy together if Steffy hadn't been in the picture. Steffy reiterated that she had given up on Liam and given Hope and Liam her blessing because she had thought it was the right thing to do.\n\n\nQuinn noted that Steffy had made an incredibly unselfish decision. Quinn added that Liam needed to know that Steffy's secret treatments had worked. Steffy nervously tapped her fingers and hoped that they made it to the wedding before it started.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Ridge and Brooke kiss before the cascading fountain. Back at his cliff house, Liam asks Hope what took so long. She says weddings make her mom sentimental and she pulled out the baby pictures but started talking about Ridge which is something she had not done in a long time. He asks if she got everything done. She says yes right down to the last detail. Their wedding is a go. There's nothing for Liam to do but show up on time and properly dressed. He laughs that he can do that. She says it is almost mind blowing. The day before their wedding and nothing is in their way. She has so much nervous energy that she feels like she ought to be doing something. He says she has no reason to be nervous as Steffy is not an issue with them anymore. Neither is his dad or Wyatt or his crazy mom. He doesn't think they are gonna have any crazy surprises tomorrow. In Paris Quinn tells Steffy that if she wants to stop this wedding she must do it now. Steffy argues that she has already told Liam to get back with Hope. Quinn says she told Hope to give Liam what he wanted but that didn't happen. They did not get married. Steffy say things are back on track now. Quinn replies that is only because Liam was threatened by Wyatt and he panicked. And if a marriage starts out like that there is not much hope that it is going to last. She keeps encouraging Steffy to go back and just tell Liam the truth and see if he still wants to marry Hope. At least that way Steffy will know. Steffy finally gives in and says okay; she will go back with Quinn. Eric signs some papers for Donna and tells her that Ridge is home. She is shocked and wonders if Brooke knows. Eric says he is on the way to see her now. He did not tell Ridge about Bill. He did not think it was his place. Donna says she works at Forrester too and she knows how people gossip. Eric says Steffy and Thomas have been at International for months now and Bill and Brooke have kept it out of the press. So Ridge does not know. Ridge thinks Brooke is all alone. And he's going to win her back. Donna says likewise with Bill. He still thinks he has a chance with Brooke. Eric says oh my God; he doesn't think Bill is the kind of guy who shrinks at a little competition. Donna says Brooke is passionate about Bill but Ridge was the love of her life. Inside, Ridge tells Brooke that he knows she must have a lot of questions and he wants to answer all of them. He says he is sorry that he hurt her. A look of disgust comes over her face and she hauls off and hits him with a closed fist across his face. She barks at him ..he came him after all this time to tell her that he is sorry! He left her on their honeymoon and she had to come back here and deal with all this crap. He tells her that he is lost without her. He can not function without her. He thought he could come back and they could talk without hitting each other. She says they did talk but he was always so distant. He apologizes for that too. He says that is why he is here. He says he stood outside her door for hours and tried to think of what to say and how to make up for it, but he can't. There is nothing he can say except it won't happen again ever. She can't believe this is happening. They both admit they have missed each other. She throws her arms around his neck and tears fall. Ridge sees bottles of booze and asks if he drove Brooke to drink. She fills him in on the wedding tomorrow. She says Hope would have invited R. J. but she knew he needed to finish school. Ridge says yes that is why he came alone. He will get him when the term is finished. He enjoyed spending time in Paris and seeing Thomas and Steffy and it also gave him time to find himself as an artist and designer and find where his passion lies. And it reminded him what he can leave on the table and what he can't live without. Ridge tells Brooke that it is almost like he never left. He tells her that he wanted to talk to her so many times, but really what he wanted was to be here and hold her like this. He says it's been far too long. He grabs her and hugs her again. Quinn asks Steffy if Liam knew she was getting treatments. She replies that no as she did not know if they would work. Steffy says Quinn is right. If she is going to tell Liam she has to tell him before the wedding. Quinn says they need to get back to L. A. as fast as they can. Liam tells Hope that he just wants tomorrow to be just what she wants. And as long as he is there standing at the altar with her it will be perfect for him. She says she is sorry. She should not have brought up Steffy. He replies that just mentioning her name does not mean she will magically appear. Hope says once they are married she knows all of her issues with her will seem like ancient history. That doesn't have to be part of their vows and Steffy will be no part of their wedding. Hope asks Liam if Steffy knows they are getting married. He says no as he didn't tell her. And he doesn't feel badly for her. Tomorrow will be just another day for her. Hope says she knows Steffy meant a lot to him. They were going to have a baby and be a family. And the fact that Steffy gave all of that up so Hope could have him is something she will always be grateful for. Liam chimes in him too. But Hope says it is also why she hates her. Liam says all of that is in the past. Ridge tells Brooke that he's made a lot of wrong assumptions about her and he doesn't want to make another one. He hopes she knows why he is here. He wants to come home and be a family again and he hopes she feels the same way. She says it has been over a year. He says he knows and it is a lot to process. She says a lot has happened. He says but nothing has changed. It's always been just Brooke. He knows when they talked it was just a quick one or two word answers. Mostly it was about R.J. not their relationship. She agrees it was like that in the beginning but then things changed and she really had no hope for them. She did not know this day would be happening. She starts to say she has something to tell him. He interrupts and says he just wants to look at her like this. He knows she has a wedding to get ready for so he will stay with his Dad and he won't interrupt the wedding tomorrow but then they will celebrate afterwards. He says he is home. When he leaves, Brooke grabs her chest and cries.",
