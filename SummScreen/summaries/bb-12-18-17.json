Bill snapped at Wyatt, asking how many times he had to say he agreed. Wyatt said he'd pass it along to the reps, even though it was Liam's responsibility.\n\n\nWyatt mumbled that Liam was probably off with Steffy somewhere, and Bill's mind exploded in a saxophone-soundtrack flashback of him being in bed with Steffy. Wyatt snapped Bill out of it with a complaint that Bill wasn't listening. Bill yelled that he was listening, but Wyatt talked too much.\n\n\nWyatt figured he knew what Bill was thinking about and said that, at some point, one just had to move on. Figuring Bill was still obsessing over Brooke, Wyatt insisted that it would eventually stop, and he'd get tough with Bill if necessary. Chuckling, Bill quietly said he'd like to see it.\n\n\nWyatt said being with Brooke wasn't in the cards right then, and the sooner Bill accepted it, the sooner Bill could let it go. Bill uttered that he might not be thinking about what Wyatt thought Bill was thinking about. Wyatt sarcastically guessed Bill that if Bill wasn't thinking about Brooke, then he was thinking about the skyscraper or what to get Wyatt for Christmas.\n\n\n\"I've already got that covered. It's a gold-plated muzzle,\" Bill quipped. Wyatt apologetically replied that he was just saying he got it. Wyatt had been there, and he remarked that it had been hard for him when Steffy had gone back to Liam. It had hurt Wyat to lose an incredible woman. Bill said Steffy was one in a million, and Liam was \"damned\" lucky to have her.\n\n\nLater, Bill was alone, organizing his desk. He picked up a copy of Eye on Fashion. Steffy was on the cover. He grimaced and slapped the magazine facedown on the desk.\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, Dr. Campbell congratulated Steffy and Liam on the pregnancy and exited to give the couple time alone. Liam and Steffy chuckled in awe and amazement that that they'd made a baby -- a new little Spencer.\n\n\nLiam and Steffy discussed scheduling her next appointment. He asked if she'd gotten her prescription for prenatal vitamins. Steffy had never imagined that she'd be getting that type of prescription. Liam exclaimed that it was official, and they'd made a baby. They hugged, and with her face over his shoulder, Steffy looked upset.\n\n\nAt home later, Liam was excited and asked if it was too early to start planning the nursery. He wanted to use the corner guestroom to give the baby a view of the mountains. He was willing to give up his office. Chuckling, he realized he was getting ahead of himself. Steffy said it was really sweet.\n\n\nThe whole house was different to Liam. He said they'd be raising a child there and building castles on the beach. They'd play on the swing set he'd have to build. Steffy suspected they'd have a spoiled child. Liam replied that she had no idea. He didn't want to over-talk it because of their last experience, but he'd wanted to raise a family with her more than anything in his life.\n\n\nSteffy touched her belly and stared into the mirror. Liam handed her a drink and figured she was worried. He felt he'd been insensitive, but she said he wasn't the issue. Because of their previous loss, he felt it was understandable to fear they wouldn't have the child. Steffy asserted that the child would make it. It was their child, whom they'd wanted all their lives.\n\n\nSteffy became tearful. Liam stated that he and Steffy were both worried, but they wouldn't let it dampen what should be a happy time. Wiping away tears, Steffy replied that he was right; he was always right. She said it was their baby, a child they deserved to love and raise. She didn't believe life would be cruel and deny them.\n\n\nDeciding she'd eat healthy and be positive, Steffy said she'd give the baby everything it needed. She was happy to bring his child into the world, and she decided that her tears were tears of joy. She prayed things would go the way they were supposed to. Liam believed they would.\n\n\nSteffy giggled as Liam knelt to have a word with the baby. He touched her stomach and announced himself as the baby's dad. Liam gave a litany of other fatherly names he could go by. He said the child would have an amazing life, and it had already started with its amazing mother. Liam was looking forward to it.\n\n\nLiam almost couldn't believe it. He said they'd done it, and it was \"our\" baby in there. He hugged Steffy, and her face darkened as she hugged him back.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Thorne shared the news with Rick and Maya that Ridge was probably proposing to Brooke that day. The three remarked upon how it was always the same outcome, but Thorne said it wouldn't be that way if he could help it.\n\n\nThorne felt that he and Rick were in the same position because of Ridge. It was always Ridge's way, and Ridge and Steffy were at the top. Thorne said Ridge had always kept his brothers back. Rick asked if Thorne knew how long Rick had waited to hear someone else say that. As Rick complained about Eric being wrapped around Ridge's finger, Thorne closed the office door.\n\n\nThorne said he was Eric's firstborn, and Rick was Eric's namesake. In Thorne's view, it was time they stood up to Ridge -- and for Brooke to do it, too. In a resentful tone, Maya noted that Ridge had been on his best behavior. Rick added that Brooke and Ridge had seemingly gotten over whatever stumbling block they'd had previously.\n\n\nShocked, Thorne asked if Maya and Rick didn't know what it had been. \"You do?\" Maya asked. Thorne replied that Ridge had betrayed Brooke with Quinn. Rick and Maya were outraged, and Rick said it made Bill look like a saint. Rick didn't even know why Brooke would give Ridge a second chance. Maya figured Brooke wanted to have faith because of R.J.\n\n\nThorne asserted that Ridge was a cheater and asked Maya and Rick to imagine the mindset of a man who could do such a thing to his father and bride-to-be right before the wedding. Rick said that Ridge shouldn't be allowed to have another chance. Claiming to know what it felt like to be loved by Brooke, Thorne said one shouldn't take it for granted.\n\n\nIt was clear to Maya that Thorne still had feelings for Brooke. Thorne said he wouldn't deny it, and he'd finally told Brooke. He just hoped it wasn't too late. Rick thought his mother was rushing into things when she wasn't yet divorced. Thorne said they knew how Ridge was when he wanted something. Rick hoped Ridge wasn't pressuring Brooke.\n\n\nThorne was certain of it. Maya figured it was hard not to get swept away by the charm and history. Thorne wished Brooke could see in her what he did. Thorne figured a new relationship with Ridge would only last a year or two before Ridge broke Brooke's heart again, and that was why Thorne had to protect her. Rick and Maya said they were pulling for Thorne, who was a good man. Rick just hoped it wasn't too late.\n\n\nAt Brooke's house, Brooke and Ridge were in bed. Brooke admired her ring and asked Ridge to hold onto it for her until her divorce was final. Pushing it back in her direction, he said it was her responsibility at that point, and she'd have to keep it safe until he could put it on her finger. There, he said, it would stay forever.\n\n\nRidge suggested that Brooke wear it on a chain around her neck, just in case anyone forgot that she was engaged. Brooke replied that she wouldn't forget it. Her phone chimed, and he groaned, thinking that it had to be Bill, who had the worst timing. Brooke remarked that she hadn't really heard from Bill, and Ridge wondered what Bill could be up to.\n\n\nLater, Ridge tucked in his shirt as he exited the bathroom and approached Brooke, who was doing her makeup at her vanity. To her, something seemed to be on his mind. Ridge didn't want to keep talking about the guy, but it was odd to him that Spencer wasn't pursuing her. Brooke said Ridge should be happy about it.\n\n\nRidge thought Bill was up to something. Brooke replied that Ridge didn't know that for sure. \"There's only one way to find out,\" Ridge decided, heading toward the door. He halted when Brooke said to just leave Bill alone. Brooke didn't want to complicate things.\n\n\nRidge said he wouldn't. Ridge almost felt bad for Bill because Ridge knew what it felt like to almost lose the woman with whom one was supposed to be. Ridge kissed Brooke and left.\n\n\nLater, Brooke was downstairs in the living room with Thorne, who said he should have picked up dinner. Brooke informed him that it was fine, and there was plenty in the kitchen for him to warm up. She had something to tell Thorne. He asked if his brother was there. Brooke replied that Ridge had just left, but he'd been there with a ring and marriage proposal.\n\n\nGazing at her hands, Thorne noted that Brooke wasn't wearing a ring, and he was glad she'd declined. Brooke affirmed that she wasn't wearing the ring; however, she explained that she'd accepted the proposal, and she and Ridge were getting married.\n\n\nThorne groaned. Brooke continued, explaining that she had every intention of marrying Ridge, but she didn't want to wear the ring until after the divorce. Thorne said she didn't want to do it, and she was making a mistake. Brooke understood that Thorne cared and was only looking out for her, but she believed that Ridge had changed and learned his lesson.\n\n\nThorne argued the case that it hadn't been that long since Ridge had failed her by kissing Quinn. Brooke said that Ridge regretted it, and she and Ridge wished it hadn't happened. Brooke was trying to move on with her life. Thorne accepted it but noted that the divorce would take two or three more months. Thorne pledged to use the time to talk her out of it.\n\n\nBrooke sighed. Thorne hoped she wouldn't settle for Ridge. Thorne felt that she deserved the best, and Thorne wasn't afraid to say that he was the best. Thorne wanted to be with her more than anything.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Liam and Steffy hug as he says they are having a baby. He's amazed and she says she never thought they would ever be saying this. Bill is transfixed off in space and Wyatt cannot get his attention. This is Liam's job but as usual he is not around. Wyatt says it is like talking to a brick wall. Thorne tells Rick and Maya that Ridge is getting ready to make his move, but not this time if he can help it. Thorne says it is time they all stand up to him. It's a big surprise when Thorne tells them that Ridge betrayed Brooke with Quinn. He does not deny he still has deep feeling for Brooke and he told her and hopes it is not too late. Rick says for what it is worth, he is on Thorne's side and pulling for him. Meanwhile Ridge and Brooke are in bed with a satisfied look on their faces. He hands her the ring and says put it on her finger where it will stay forever. He wonders what Bill is up to since he is no longer reaching out to Brooke. He says he almost feels sorry for him as he knows how it feels to lose the woman you love and feel you should be with. Liam gloats again. It is official, they made a baby. While Wyatt it thinking Brooke, Bill is thinking Steffy when Wyatt says it is not in the cards now so he needs to completely let it go. Liam confides in Steffy that he does not want to dwell on it too much as he knows she had a previous bad experience but he's got it all planned out \u0096 where the nursery is going to be and a swing set on the beach \u0096 he is ready. Then he apologizes and says he is being insensitive. Steffy is not talking and he should let her have some alone time and space to think about this moment. Thorne stops by Brooke's and he notices the ring when Brooke quickly slips it off. She says she is not wearing it but she did say yes to Ridge. She does not want to put the ring on since she is still married to Bill but she would like to make it clear that she has every intention of marrying Ridge. She knows what Ridge did but she is just trying to get past that and get on with her life. He says well she has another three months or so and he will spend all that time trying to change her mind. Liam says he knows they are both worried but they should be happy right now and focusing on that. She cries that she will be happy and positive and make this baby the best time ever. She just hopes all goes the way it is supposed to. He bends down to the floor with his mouth by Steffy's stomach to talk to his baby about his amazing mother and life he will have. Again he beams to Steffy \"this is ours.\"",
