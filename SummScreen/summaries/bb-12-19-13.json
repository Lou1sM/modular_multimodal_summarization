Liam conveyed that he and Hope weren't taking a honeymoon. Bill stated that the past was gone, and though he'd thought his son would end up with Steffy, it was possible for him to be wrong at times.\n\n\nCaroline left, and Liam guessed that his father would give him some advice. Bill doubted he should dole out marriage advice. \"Happy wife, happy life?\" Bill told his son, and the men hugged. Bill said it had taken him a while to get there, but Liam and Hope had Bill's support. Liam thanked Bill, who added that Wyatt wouldn't be an issue.\n\n\nInside the main house, Pam and Charlie set out food, and guests began to arrive. Carter asked Rick and Caroline how the honeymoon had been and ribbed Rick for renting an entire island. \"It was two, but who's counting,\" Rick responded, chuckling.\n\n\nAside, Donna asked Eric if anyone else knew of Ridge's presence. Eric said no one knew but Brooke, and Ridge was laying low at the mansion until after the wedding. Donna wondered how Bill would feel to learn that Ridge was back in town.\n\n\nAs the guests chatted later, they learned that Charlie would officiate the wedding. Aside with Brooke, Bill remarked that it was an important day for their children. He stated that the next big day would be his wedding to Brooke. As she told him to stop, he insisted that he wasn't giving up.\n\n\nBill walked off, and Eric approached Brooke to ask if Bill and Ridge knew anything about her dealings with them. Brooke responded that she hadn't told either man anything yet.\n\n\nOn the jet, Quinn and Steffy prepared for landing. Quinn said that Steffy's news would be a game-changer for Liam. Quinn and Wyatt spoke by phone, and he told his mother to keep the engines going because Eric had agreed to let Quinn and Wyatt take the jet to Hawaii.\n\n\nQuinn said it wasn't a good time, but Wyatt insisted that he needed to get away, refocus, and move on. Quinn asked Wyatt not to give up on Hope and to text-message Quinn with Liam's whereabouts. Wyatt agreed to do it but insisted he'd leave town afterward.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt arrived at Brooke's house, looking for Hope. Oliver was surprised to see Wyatt but relayed that Hope was upstairs, and Liam was in the cabin. Wyatt sent his mother a message with Liam's location then went to Brooke's room, where Brooke and Hope were getting ready.\n\n\nWyatt promised not to cause a scene, and Brooke left the room. He admired how beautiful the surprised Hope looked, and he hoped her wedding was more magical than she'd ever imagined. He said he'd wanted to wish her well and let her know he was going out of town to clear his head.\n\n\nWyatt conveyed that, because of Hope, he was more humble and grateful. He'd been cocky and arrogant before because he hadn't ever felt that way about a woman. He felt that he'd grown up too late. Wyatt stated that Hope had changed him and his life, and he wished her nothing but the best.\n\n\nHope told Wyatt that it didn't have to be goodbye. However, Wyatt felt that he couldn't be just friends with her after he'd fallen in love with her. He looked into her eyes, sighed, and walked out. Hope fought back tears and uttered, \"Goodbye, Wyatt.\"\n\n\nHope went to the bathroom, and Quinn sneaked in to place a note on the vanity. As Quinn tiptoed out, Hope called her name, and Quinn returned to the room, pretending to be there to wish Hope luck before Quinn and Wyatt left town.\n\n\nDownstairs, Caroline offered to go upstairs to help Hope, but Brooke said Hope was doing fine. When Caroline walked off, Brooke whispered to Eric that she hadn't wanted to reveal that Wyatt was with Hope. Eric asked if Wyatt would be a problem. Brooke said Hope was committed to marrying Liam, and there wouldn't be any surprises that day.\n\n\nBrooke went upstairs, where Hope was laying her garment bag on the bed, and asked what Wyatt had wanted. Hope explained that he'd wished her well, but he still wasn't over her. Hope said she wasn't having second thoughts, and she and Liam had waited a long time for the wedding.\n\n\nBrooke discovered the note on the vanity and read it aloud. It said that Liam needed to see Hope, and it asked her to break tradition to meet him at the cabin. Brooke was against doing it, but unafraid of breaking tradition, Hope decided to slip out the back door to meet Liam.\n\n\nOutside, Steffy made her way across Brooke's estate. Upon seeing the wedding setup, she grimaced as if she were wondering what she was doing there. Steffy flashed back to having the sprinkler fight with Liam in that spot, and she smiled. When she made it to the cabin, she flashed back to being intimate with Liam inside of it.\n\n\nLiam looked out of the window and thought he saw Steffy. He went outside and called her name. Steffy turned, and Liam gasped. The two went into the cabin, and Steffy said that she'd traveled there at the spur of the moment. She stated that she knew what the day was for Liam. She didn't want to cause problems, but she'd wanted to see him.\n\n\nLiam asked how Paris was, and Steffy replied that things were good. She became emotional as she told him that she'd found out that she could have children again. She felt as if a dark cloud had been lifted from her. She said she'd left him because she hadn't been able to have children, but that problem was no longer an issue. \"Do you know what this means?\" she asked.\n\n\nOutside, Hope hurried down the flagstone steps and glanced at the cabin. She was shocked to see Steffy standing inside with Liam.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Hope and Brooke walk over the wedding location and Hope thanks her for making it so beautiful. It is just what she always imagined, simple and peaceful with just a few family and friends. In the cabin Caroline is helping Liam get ready with Bill looking on. He asks if Liam is gonna use his jet on his honeymoon. Liam corrects him and says he means Katie's jet. And no they aren't going on a honeymoon. They just want to stay home and be an old married couple. Caroline thinks that is sweet but she can hook him up with a good place. Speaking of hooking up, Bill pours a drink for them and says he can hook him up with a drink to calm his nerves. Liam holds out his hands that are steady and says he is not nervous .besides it is barely noon. Bill says okay cheers to him to calm his nerves. Caroline reminds him what happened last time with the crazy hair and henna tattoos and running around in his underwear. Liam tells them not to even go there. Bill adds that was in the past. Today he is marrying Hope although he thought Liam would end up with Steffy but he guesses even he can be wrong sometimes. Liam asks if this is where he is supposed to offer some profound fatherly wisdom. Bill answers that he is the last person that should be telling Liam how a marriage works. He doesn't need it; he's not worried. But all right, if he wants something \u0096 happy wife, happy life. That's what he's got. He hugs Liam and says he is proud of him. He says it took him a while to come around but he and Hope have his support. Liam thanks him for that and for having his back. Bill says that is not necessary and it's not a problem anymore as his brother is not going to be an issue anymore. Steffy tells Quinn that the pilot said they would be landing soon. Quinn says she is glad that Steffy came back with her. She found out she can have children and that is a game changer. She needs to tell Liam before he marries Hope. Wyatt talks to her on phone and says to keep the engines running. Eric was kind enough to loan them the jet and they are going to Hawaii. Quinn whispers that now is not a good time. Wyatt comments that he needs to wax a board and just get in the water and refocus, get on with his life. Quinn begs him not to give up on Hope just yet. Wyatt reminds her that Hope is getting married today. Quinn tells him to text her when he knows where Liam is. Wyatt says fine but he's leaving just after he talks to Hope. Donna tells Charlie and Pam those are cute matching aprons. Pam tells Charlie to grab his ear and follow as they have a cake to frost. Caroline kisses Rick and says she loves weddings, makes her want to marry him all over again. Oliver tells Carter and the others to get together as Hope wants lots of pictures. Donna asks Eric if anyone knows about Ridge. He says no and he is laying low at his house until after this wedding. Bill sidles up to Brooke and says it is a big day for their children. Then he whispers there will be another big wedding soon \u0096 theirs. He is not giving up. Caroline asks Carter if he and Maya have set a date yet. Charlie tells them that he is not a minister but a justice of peace if they need one. Eric sees Bill with Brooke and asks her later if she told him about Ridge. She says no, neither knows about the other yet. Oliver is surprised to see Wyatt in the doorway. Wyatt tells him that he needs to talk to Hope one last time. Oliver tells him that she is getting dressed upstairs and Liam is down at the cabin; good luck. Quinn tells Steffy that the wedding will be happening soon. She urges Steffy to get to Brooke's right away. Liam is in the cabin. She is meant to be with him and Hope is meant to be with Wyatt. As Brooke is helping Hope with her makeup Wyatt walks in. He says he is not there to create a scene. Hope says sure and asks Brooke if she minds giving them a few minutes. Wyatt tells Hope just look at her .exactly as he pictured her on her wedding day, absolutely beautiful. She asks why he is here. He says he only came to say that he hoped this day would be the best of her life. And he hopes her wedding will be more magical than she ever imagined it could be. He says he just wants to wish her all the happiness in the world and to tell her that he is leaving town for a while. She asks where he is going. He replies that Eric was kind enough to offer the jet so he and his mom are going to Hawaii to surf and clear his head a bit. She says sounds good and she understands that. He says he is so much better for knowing Hope. So just let him say this. It's true, because of Hope he is more humble and grateful. Before he had taken everything for granted. He admits he was cocky and arrogant as he didn't know how to act because he had never felt like this with a woman before. He feels like he grew up too late. She stands up facing him and says he is being too hard on himself right now. Wyatt says he is telling her this now as she changed him .she changed his life. He wishes her nothing but the best. And as for Liam, well he is all right. She's making a good choice. They both laugh. She tells him this doesn't have to be goodbye. They can still see each other. He says it's not the same. He wished he didn't feel this way but he can not be just friends with her, not after he has fallen in love with her and kissed those lips. He can't be around here. He leaves. She looks shocked and devastated. Finally she says \"Goodbye, Wyatt.\" Brooke tells Eric that she had not said anything before but Wyatt is up with Hope. He wonders if that is going to be an issue. Brooke says there have been some feelings there but Hope is definitely ready to marry Liam. There will be no surprises. As she comes out of the bathroom, Hope catches Quinn as she has just put a note on the table. Quinn says she wanted to quickly stop by and wish Hope all the best before she and Wyatt left town. A note seemed so impersonal. Hope tells her that she heard she was going to International and she hopes that works out for her. She and Wyatt are so talented that she has no doubt they will be successful. Quinn replies she is going to make sure of that. Steffy walks across the grounds with no one noticing. She remembers back to the time that she and Liam got caught in the sprinkler. She stops outside the cabin and sees Liam straightening his tie. She hesitates and turns away. He senses something and goes to the window and can't believe his eyes but mouths the word Steffy. He goes outside to her. She follows him into the cabin. He says this is such a surprise as he did not know she was in town. She says it was spur of the minute and no ones knows she is here. He says it's good to see her. She replies for her too. She knows what today is and she is not here to make trouble. She won't be here long. But she needed to see him. She says Paris is fine and she was just beginning to settle in and begin a new life. Now she has the most incredible news. Something unbelievable happened. She is now able to have children. Liam is shocked. Hope tells Brooke that she is almost ready. Brooke asks about Wyatt. Hope says he was just here to wish her well though he is not over her yet. Brooke asks about her. Hope says she is not having second thoughts if that is what Brooke means. She and Liam have waited a long time to make this day a reality and the only thing standing in their way was Steffy. Now she really is excited. She needs to go put on her gown. Brooke finds the note and reads it out loud to Hope. It says to break with tradition, he needs to see her at the cabin. Both think it is cute of Liam. Hope says she does not believe in bad luck. She will go and not be long. Steffy beams that she can get pregnant and carry a baby to term. She feels like a dark cloud has been lifted. They lost their baby but now she will be able to experience motherhood. That is the reason that she left him as she knew she could not give him a baby. She had to leave L.A. too. But that is not in the way anymore so surely he knows what this means. Hope is joyful until she stops and looks at the image in the window. She does a double take and her joy turns into a frown as she sees Liam put both of his hands on Steffy's shoulders.",
