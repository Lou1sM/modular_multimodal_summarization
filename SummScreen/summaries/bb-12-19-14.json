    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Maya's place, Maya anxiously opened the door for Othello, who said he was surprised she'd messaged him to visit. He liked her new place, and she replied that it would do until she got her own mansion. They discussed the place being a big step up from the coffeehouse room. \"All thanks to Rick,\" Maya added. Othello assumed she meant that Rick had given her the lead modeling job.\n\n\nOthello was surprised that Maya wasn't complaining about Rick going back to Caroline. Maya considered Othello to be a good friend and one of the very few to support her and Rick. She was dying to tell someone her news and asked if Othello could keep a secret.\n\n\nWhen Maya revealed that Rick was only pretending to reunite with Caroline, Othello became worried. Othello believed that Rick belonged with Maya but questioned if it was happening the right way. She responded that Rick was just waiting for the right time to announce the truth.\n\n\nOthello said it was cruel Caroline, but Maya called it karma for the way Caroline had treated Maya. Maya explained that her relationship with Rick had to remain a secret until the proper time. Othello assured her that his lips were sealed.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Carter found Ridge working and told him to go home. Ridge murmured that he didn't know where home was because Katie had broken it off with him. Carter asked why it had ended, and Ridge stated Caroline's name. Confused, Carter said Ridge didn't have feelings for Caroline.\n\n\nRidge shrugged, acknowledging that Katie could be right because a connection had sparked between the artists, and it had led to kissing. Carter cited that Ridge had made it sound innocent, and even if Maya had made a big deal out of it, Caroline was back with Rick, which should reassure Katie.\n\n\nRidge said Katie wasn't the kind of woman to let an attraction like he'd had for Caroline go. It was sad to Ridge because he'd never act on it -- not again. He confessed to being enthralled, and it had been as if Caroline Senior was back. He couldn't shake whatever it was about Caroline.\n\n\nCarter warned Ridge not to let his nostalgia take over. Ridge agreed but said that opening the door to the past just a little bit had allowed memories to flood in. Ridge had been captivated by the first Caroline Spencer. \"And now there's another just as captivating,\" Carter concluded.\n\n\nCarter wanted to know what Ridge would do about the issue. Ridge said he wouldn't do anything, and he wasn't a home wrecker. Carter asked if Caroline knew of Ridge's feelings and if she shared them. Ridge asserted that it didn't matter because Rick was trying to fix his family, and regardless of Ridge's philosophical captivations, nothing would happen again.\n\n\nLater, Ridge was alone when he imagined that Caroline had returned to the office to see what he was working on. She sat down to draw, and he put his hand over hers. Moments later, the designers became embroiled in a kiss. Ridge snapped out of it and discovered that he was alone.\n\n\nIn the guesthouse, Caroline drank wine and took selfies until she heard someone approaching the house. She quickly poured some wine in a second glass and opened the door. Aly gasped, surprised that the door had opened before she'd knocked. Aly had wanted to check on Caroline, but upon seeing two wine glasses in Caroline's hands, Aly said she didn't want to interrupt.\n\n\nInviting Aly inside, Caroline remarked that she'd thought Rick had made it home when Aly had arrived. Aly asked how things were going with the marriage. Caroline said things were turning around and asked about Aly and Oliver. Aly beamed that Oliver treated her well and was always loyal and honest. \"Yeah, like Rick,\" Caroline replied and took a nervous sip of wine.\n\n\nThe women discussed Rick's mean reaction to Caroline's indiscretion. Caroline felt she'd deserved it but wished all of Forrester hadn't had to witness it. Maya's way of outing Caroline had mortified Caroline. Caroline knew people were talking and having hushed conversations about her.\n\n\nAly told Caroline not to worry about it because it had been just a few kisses. Still, Caroline felt embarrassed. Aly bet plenty of women in the building would jump at the chance to kiss Ridge. Caroline said Ridge's charm was easy to fall for, and she was glad it hadn't gone any further. Growing tearful, Caroline said that she was very lucky to have a man like Rick.\n\n\nAly asked if Rick had taken Caroline's car back to work because she'd seen Rick's car in the driveway upon arriving home. Caroline shot up from her seat, peeked through the blinds, and saw Rick's car out front. Aly assumed he was at the main house, and Caroline said it was weird.\n\n\nAt the mansion, Ivy arrived in the kitchen, still upset by seeing Rick kissing Maya earlier. Rick entered, pretending to be raiding the refrigerator. She avoided his gaze, and he asked if something was wrong. Ivy told him that they needed to talk. Rick noticed that she was upset, and guessing that it was about her line, he offered to talk to her about anything on her mind.\n\n\n\"I know what you've been doing. I saw you tonight -- with Maya,\" Ivy stated. Rick tried to pretend that the sighting had been earlier at the office, but Ivy explained that she'd been looking for her friend's apartment when she'd stumbled upon Maya and Rick kissing. He attempted to lead Ivy to believe it had been a goodbye kiss, and he'd been slowly moving Maya toward accepting the breakup.\n\n\nIvy said it was a nice try, but there had been no way that Rick been ending things with the kiss she'd seen. Ivy said she thought he'd forgiven Caroline and reconciled. He said that was true, and Ivy asked why he'd been kissing Maya. He yelled that his wife had cheated on him. \"So you're cheating on her? Why? To get revenge or something?\" Ivy asked.\n\n\nRick ordered Ivy to forget what she'd seen. Ivy replied that she wouldn't do that. The house intercom buzzed, and Caroline's voice sounded through the air. She asked if Rick was there. He answered and claimed to have been getting some wine when he'd gotten caught up in something with Ivy. He said he'd be home once he made sure that he and Ivy saw eye-to-eye on things.\n\n\nBack at the guesthouse, Aly advised Caroline not to let Rick talk sketches when he got home. Caroline was amazed that Rick had given their marriage a chance and that he was also trusting her with couture again. Rick's trust meant a lot to her, and he'd proven how understanding and forgiving he was.\n\n\nAt the main house, Rick told Ivy that she wouldn't say a word to anyone. Ivy felt that Rick was hurt, not thinking clearly, and overreacting. Rick said that they might be family, but the conversation with her boss was inappropriate. Ivy gasped and disagreed. He accused her of living in his family's house and sticking her nose into other people's business.\n\n\nIvy stated that she was trying to help. Rick roared at her that if she wanted to help, she'd keep her mouth shut. Undaunted, Ivy asked if he'd tried \"talking to someone.\" Rick scoffed. He didn't need therapy. He needed a woman who could love him and stand by him. Rick said Ivy didn't know what it was like to have her wife cheat on him with a man who'd constantly left his mother on the floor in tears.\n\n\nRick couldn't believe Caroline wanted to be with Ridge. Ivy tried to correct Rick, but he interrupted, saying that he'd thought he'd finally found a woman he could trust. \"And he takes her, and he kisses her? He touches her?\" Rick stated. He ordered Ivy not to say anything about Maya. \"As long as you're living in this house, working for my company, your loyalties lie with me and not Caroline. Is that understood?\" Rick roared.\n\n\nJust then, Caroline entered the kitchen in her robe and asked if everything was okay. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "When Ivy confronts Rick about what she saw the night before, he angrily attempts to justify his actions and warns her not to tell anyone. Ridge reveals to Carter his theory about why feelings for Caroline suddenly sprung up for him. Feeling the need to tell someone, Maya confides in a friend. Caroline becomes worried about Rick\u2019s suspicious behavior and whereabouts.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Othello arrives at Maya's and says he is surprised when he got her text. He can't believe she got such great digs away from being over the coffee shop. She shrugs it off as temporary until she gets her own mansion. And she purposely tells him it is all due to Rick. She asks if he can keep a secret and then spills that Rick is only pretending. He is really not back with Caroline. Maya tells Othello not to take that tone. This is a good thing. They are just waiting for the right time to announce it. She says he is the only one that knows and it has to stay that way until it is time. He says his lips are sealed. Caroline pours some wine and is waiting for Rick but Aly shows up unexpectedly. Caroline invites her in and says Rick had to go back to work so she thought it was him returning. She describes how hard it has been with her and Rick trying to rekindle what they had. But it all blew up, their mistakes, in front of all of Forrester and she can see them staring in the hallways and hushed conversations when she walks by. Aly tells her do not worry about it; it was only a few kisses and everybody falls for that Forrester charm. Caroline agrees and says she is glad it did not go any further. She is lucky that Rick is giving their marriage another try. She is lucky to have a man like him. And not only is he trying with the marriage but he insists that she and Ridge work together again. He is so really forgiving and a good person. Rick walks into Eric's kitchen and finds Ivy who is thinking over what she just saw between Rick and Maya. She tells him they need to talk. He says she can tell him anything. She doesn't stutter. She says she knows what he has been doing. She saw him tonight with Maya ..kissing Maya. Rick blows it off as a goodbye kiss. He says Maya got a little too attached and she is not warming up to the fact that he went back to his wife. Ivy says nice try but that was no goodbye kiss that she saw. She knows he did not end it with Maya. Carter comes in looking for Rick but Ridge tells him that he has already left. Carter opines that it is nice to see Ridge sketching again but he looks sort of beat so maybe he ought to go home too. Ridge confides that he is not sure where home is anymore as Katie ended the engagement. Carter is surprised since Ridge's feelings for Caroline was a creative spark from artist to artist. Ridge isn't so sure. Carter says Maya made a big deal out of it but nothing happened and Ridge is not pursuing Caroline and she is back with Rick. Ridge says Katie knows but she is not the kind of woman just to dismiss this and it's sad as he would never act on those feelings. Ridge admits though that there is something alluring about it as he was married to her aunt and now it's like she is back. There is something about her spirit and her elegance. Carter tells him to be careful, nostalgia may take him too far. Ridge says he is not a home wrecker. Carter asks if Caroline knows how he feels. Ridge says it does not matter because he is not going to let it get that far. She is back with Rick over something that he did and it won't happen again. Ridge has a fantasy with Caroline coming back to the office and she begins to design. He watches for a minute then takes the pen from her and kisses her passionately. He's finally jerked back to his senses. Rick tells Ivy this is none of her business. She says she is only concerned. She thought he was back with Caroline and yet he is kissing Maya. He finally admits his wife cheated on her with Ridge. So she asks if he is out for revenge. She is not judging him but she'd like to understand. He tells her to forget it and she says she can't. Aly tells Caroline that she saw Rick's car when she came in. Caroline guesses he is at the main house and calls him. He says he was getting a bottle of wine but he got into something with Ivy so he will be home in a bit. He wants to make sure they see eye to eye on something. He turns to Ivy and says she is not going to say a word to anyone. She better understand. She tells him he is not thinking straight right now. He counters that this is inappropriate behavior to be talking to her boss this way. She is getting into some very dangerous territory and sticking her nose in other people's business. She says she only wants to help. He barks that if she really wants to help then keep her mouth shut. Don't say anything to anyone. She asks if he has thought about talking to someone. He scoffs that he does not need therapy. He just needs a woman he can trust and that will stand by him. All his life he has been lied to in all his relationships except for Maya. She is the only one who has been honest. He watched Ridge treat his mother like crap all his life and this is who Caroline wants to be with? He barks again that as long as Ivy is living in this house she will be loyal to him and the company and not say a word about Maya. He hopes he made that clear! Caroline walks in to see if Rick is ready to come home and she sees the tension between Ivy and Rick and asks what is going on.",
