She wants their Christmas to be very special. He says yes but he does not want her to go overboard. She has given him so much already. She says it is a secret, but she may shower him with gifts.

Ridge says she could have run away but she stood there bold and brazen. Katie says she cannot tell Eric what she has on her phone as Quinn will deny it and Eric will get more stressful. Katie says she will keep the phone photo and have it if they need it. She will just let Quinn think she is her champion. Eric tells Quinn that some people think he is too old for her. She needs someone more like Ridge's age. She says no, Ridge does have his assets but even on his best days it does not compare with Eric. She says some mornings when she wakes up she is afraid she will look over and he won't be there, it will all be a dream. He means everything to her and she hopes that is not too much. Katie says she will not let Quinn get her clutches further into Eric. They will just have to be smart in how they pry him away from her.",
