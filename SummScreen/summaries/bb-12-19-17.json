He had marveled that they had created the baby. Steffy was lost in thought.\n\n\nMaya and Nicole entered Steffy's office, and they chattered about reading Lizzy books every night. Nicole noted that it wouldn't be long before Lizzy would be reading books to her parents. Maya and Nicole paused when they noticed Steffy lost in thought. Maya apologized for barging in.\n\n\nMaya explained that they had been talking about Lizzy and her excitement over Christmas. She added that Lizzy's playgroup would be getting a Santa visit, and Rick was playing Santa. Maya and Nicole discussed that they hoped the same thing would happen for Nicole someday. Maya apologized about being insensitive because Steffy didn't have children.\n\n\nSteffy said she understood. Talk turned to business for a few minutes, but Steffy seemed distracted. Maya asked Steffy if she was all right, and Steffy said she was fine. She thanked Maya and Nicole for stopping in, and they left.\n\n\nSteffy started to daydream about giving birth. Liam was with her and coaching her. After the baby was born, Liam held it and looked disapprovingly at Steffy. She asked what was wrong, and Liam angrily pulled back the blanket on the baby to reveal it had Bill's face. Steffy screamed in her daydream, and begged Liam for a chance to explain. When Steffy returned to reality, she gasped.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Liam was clearly happy, and Wyatt said something about babies. Liam smiled, and Wyatt said his brother had had a goofy grin \"since you walked in.\" Liam smiled and agreed. He shared news that he and Steffy were going to have a baby. Wyatt smiled. Liam said they had just found out and wanted to keep it quiet because of Steffy's history. Liam said he hoped he hadn't upset Wyatt with the news.\n\n\nWyatt said it was fine, and he was happy for Liam and Steffy. He asked if Liam and Steffy had picked a name yet. Liam said they had just found out about the baby.\n\n\nWyatt asked about Steffy, and Liam said she was emotional. Wyatt said the baby would be lucky to have Steffy and Liam as parents. Wyatt added that their dad would be thrilled to be a grandfather. Liam said he was happy that things were better between him and his dad. Liam said that finding out about being a father was the \"greatest moment of my life.\" Later, Liam called Steffy and left a message that he wanted \"to make sure the mommy-to-be-is okay.\"\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Ridge showed up and announced to Bill that he and Broke were getting married. Bill noted that Ridge and his gloating were intolerable, but he didn't see the point of Ridge's visit. Ridge ordered Bill to sign the divorce papers and not drag out the divorce. Bill nodded. \"Does Brooke know you're doing this?\" Bill asked. Bill added that Ridge had done a number on Brooke and her heart with his lack of commitment.\n\n\nRidge countered that Bill had quite a record of his own indiscretions. Bill grew silent and flashed back to making love to Steffy. Bill encouraged Ridge to return to the \"dress farm.\" Ridge suggested that he and Bill could try to get along better for Steffy's sake.\n\n\nBill wanted Ridge to leave, but Ridge added that \"you can't always have the woman you want. Can you?\" Bill grimaced, but his phone rang, and it was on the coffee table. Steffy's picture showed up, and Bill quickly hid the phone so that Ridge couldn't see it. Bill said Ridge had \"overstayed your welcome.\" Ridge responded, \"Sign the papers.\"\n\n\nRidge left, and Bill took Steffy's call. She insisted she had to see him immediately. Bill wanted to meet at his office, but Steffy wanted to meet someplace private -- his house. She said she would be over.\n\n\nAt Katie's, Brooke visited. Katie wondered if Brooke had a special reason for the visit. Brooke announced that she was going to marry Ridge. Katie congratulated her sister and hugged her.\n\n\nBrooke wondered if Katie was surprised she was marrying Ridge. Katie said she'd always thought that Brooke and Ridge belonged together. Brooke and Katie were folding laundry, and Brooke noted that a man's shirt was certainly too large for Will.\n\n\nKatie agreed and said she had been seeing someone. She admitted it was Wyatt. Brooke smiled and was surprised. Katie explained that she and Wyatt had started seeing each other during the fashion challenge. She added that their success in Monte Carlo had drawn them together, and \"it just kind of happened.\" \"You and Wyatt?\" Brooke asked.\n\n\nKatie said she and Wyatt had been hesitant to get involved \"for a lot of reasons,\" but she added that it felt right to be with him. She explained that they had fun together, and \"he can't keep his hands off me.\" Katie said she didn't want to overthink it or plan too far ahead. She added that it felt good to tell someone she could trust. Brooke was worried that Bill would find out, and \"it could get ugly.\" Brooke and Katie agreed that neither of them had heard much from Bill, and they both thought it was odd.\n\n\nAt Bill's, Steffy showed up, and she informed Bill that she and Liam were happy and had put everything behind them. Steffy stuttered and stammered about a doctor's appointment. Bill worried that something was wrong. Steffy finally announced she'd gotten news that she had wanted for years. She was pregnant, and Liam had met her at the appointment.\n\n\nBill congratulated Steffy, and he repeated it. He acknowledged that he was going to be a grandfather. He hoped Liam and Steffy had a happy, healthy baby. Steffy said she hoped so too. She was tearful. Bill suddenly realized that the news meant he could be the father. He looked scared.\n\n\n",
