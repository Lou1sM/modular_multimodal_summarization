    "tvmega_recap": "Bill grouses to Liam that to not make him drive over here again for reports. Liam figures his lousy mood has to do with Brooke. Bill says yes they should be married and celebrating their first Christmas together. The subject gets around to Quinn and Liam says she has not changed and never will. He is not saying things are solid with him and Steffy but they are trying hard to work on it without more interference. Ridge, Steffy and Rick talk and Ridge tells them that Wyatt is the ultimate prize as Quinn wants him back with Steffy. She tells them she is on full alert and she is no longer worried about Quinn now that she is CEO and even working with Quinn won't bother her. A Quinn mine field, she will deal with it. Quinn tells Wyatt that Eric is on his side so she does not think after what Eric told Liam recently that he has a chance with Steffy. Wyatt tells Quinn not to get ahead of herself. Pretty much all Eric can do is cheerlead for him; Steffy is still going for the divorce. He says he appreciates them supporting him but there is a fine line between supporting and meddling and he'd like her to back off. He changes the subject and asks about her Christmas present to Eric. She thinks back to the shower scene with Ridge and says it is a present that just keeps on giving and will leave it at that. Bill tells Liam that Eric needs to stay out of this. He leaves just as Steffy returns to Liam's. He states to Steffy that now Eric is targeting their relationship. Liam fills her in on what Eric said about his waffling and it is just Quinn talking and putting ideas in his head. Rick laughs and says it sounds like Ridge has never seen a naked lady before. Ridge says yes, many \u0096 but he was not expecting this particular one. Wyatt calls Steffy and explains to her that he and Nicole have something exciting set up and he will get back to her later when she has more time to discuss it about social media. Liam reminds her that again this is Quinn making sure it remains that way that Wyatt and Steffy will always be working together. He sees her tattoo ring not faded yet and she says yes she has been so busy she missed her last meeting with the doctor. Liam rants on with his song and dance about Quinn pulling the strings and how Eric said Steffy's future does not include him. She tells him she does want to be with him and especially during this time of year. He says she knows how much he loves the holidays but he is so dreading the day at Eric's house with Quinn's photo over the fireplace and Eric's constant reminder they have no future. Quinn meets up with Ridge and gloats that she knows seeing her in the outdoor shower was the highlight of his day but she will not tell Brooke. Then she challenges him to compare her bod with all those models he has worked with in stages of undress over the years. He complies that she has a nice body so she should go home for Christmas and take care of it. She replies that he can be Grinch if he wants to but she will not let him take away her holiday spirit. This is her first Christmas as Mrs. Eric Forrester. Ridge adds .. and her last, count on it.",
