She says she is pregnant and even though she did not want it to change things, it has. Ivy comes in and tells Steffy she does not have to hide.

She can not bite her tongue even if it is more convenient. She only wants to tell the truth. So there could still be a chance for them before it is too late. Sasha tells Julius that he can not tell her what to do. He says if she stays it will only complicate matters. If she wants to come back, do not overstay her welcome. She says she knows she just got here but this is what she wants, to be part of this big city with his family. It is full of opportunities. Nicole could not even get a date back home and now she is dating a Forrester. Julius tells her to stay away from Zende.
