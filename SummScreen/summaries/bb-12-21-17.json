The doctor arrived, and Steffy explained that she wanted a paternity test because there had been another man. She said it had only happened once. Dr. Campbell replied that it only took one time.\n\n\nThe doctor knew it wasn't what Steffy wanted to hear. Steffy understood, but she said it needed to be her husband's baby. Dr. Campbell explained how the test worked, and Steffy expressed her eagerness to get it done. Campbell clarified that it could be too early to draw fetal cells. Steffy assumed that if it turned out to be too early, they'd have to wait a week or two to do it again. She still wanted to at least try because the uncertainty was weighing on her.\n\n\nSteffy handed Dr. Campbell some plastic bags with samples from the men in question. She had a toothbrush from Liam's travel kit and was confident no one else had used it. She'd only touched the holder. She also had hair from the other man and said he'd pulled them himself.\n\n\nDr. Campbell complimented Steffy for protecting the samples from contamination. Campbell just needed to confirm with the lab that they were viable before she started the process.\n\n\nIn Bill's office, Liam discussed employee bonuses. He wanted to give Roberta twenty thousand. \"Twenty thousand what?\" Bill asked. Liam indicated that he was talking dollars, and the figure was only a half percent of the profit she'd garnered for them. \"Okay,\" Bill replied.\n\n\nLiam was shocked, but Bill quickly dismissed the topic by leaning forward over his desk and noting that Liam looked different. Bill also recalled that Liam had gone to a doctor's appointment with Steffy the other day. He asked if Steffy had gotten a clean bill of health. Liam conspicuously fought off grins and replied that Bill could say that.\n\n\nLiam returned to discussing bonuses, and Bill asked about Liam's. Liam claimed he was taken care of, but Bill contemplated gifting Liam as starter yacht. Liam asked if he could tell Bill what he wanted. \"Happiness,\" Liam said. Bill noted that Santa didn't carry it in a sack.\n\n\nLiam didn't think people took stock of whether they were happy, so the next best thing to happiness was the knowledge of it. Liam asked for a reminder of his happiness if Bill ever saw Liam moping around, and Liam wanted Bill to remind him that Bill and Steffy were the reason for it. \"That is my Christmas bonus,\" Liam decided.\n\n\nLater, Liam asked why Wyatt couldn't get a yacht. Bill said to leave Wyatt to him. Bill intended to get each of his sons something epic. Liam quipped that it was too late because his wife had given him a gift that even Bill couldn't top. Bill asked what it could be, and Liam asked if it was okay to give Steffy a quick call. Bill assumed Steffy was at work, but Liam figured she was at home because he'd already checked for her at work.\n\n\nAs Bill tensed, Liam reached Steffy and asked if she'd taken care of that thing. Steffy asked if he meant her vitamins and guessed he wasn't alone. Liam gave her greetings from Bill and asked where she was. Steffy changed the subject, asking if the thing he'd meant had been the prenatal yoga class. She said she was checking it out, and it looked good. Liam wondered if that was where she was at that moment.\n\n\nSpeaking loud enough for Steffy to hear, Bill announced that time was money, and Liam needed to tell his wife that he had to go back to work because his dad was a tyrant. Liam complied and ended the call. Bill asked if everything was okay on the domestic front. Grinning, Liam replied that it couldn't be better. Bill sighed.\n\n\nLiam stepped out for a moment, and Bill slipped a text message to Steffy, asking her to let him know what was happening when she could. Another text visible on his phone was an earlier one in which he'd advised her to ask the doctor how far along she was.\n\n\nThe door opened. Liam returned with a gift bag and said Bill deserved a bonus, too. Bill mumbled that Liam wasn't allowed to buy him anything. Liam didn't know why not after Bill had given Liam a house, car, nice clothes, a career, and paternity leave. \"What?\" Bill asked.\n\n\nLiam reminded Bill that Liam had added paternity leave to their family leave package. Liam had feared Bill would roll it back, but Bill hadn't done it. Liam pushed the bag at Bill, who reluctantly accepted it. Inside, Bill found a gold statue award for the world's best dad. Bill quickly said he couldn't accept it, and Liam replied that it had been literally less than ten dollars.\n\n\nBill responded that he wasn't the world's best dad. Liam said that when he'd been growing up, people had said that family was first. Liam hadn't had a family, so it had sounded like lip service to him; however, when Bill said it, Liam knew Bill meant it. Liam stated that for the first time in his life, he meant it, too. He said that he loved Bill, and if Liam ever got to be a father, he wanted to be as giving, generous, loving, and forgiving as Bill had been to Liam.\n\n\nBack in Dr. Campbell's office, the doctor returned and said the samples were viable. She just needed to take blood from Steffy. Steffy asked that she do it in a discreet location on Steffy's body. Dr. Campbell said she'd be careful and also avoid bruising.\n\n\nLater, Dr. Campbell was surprised that Steffy was still there, waiting. Steffy asked if the test was done, but Dr. Campbell said she and Steffy had already been over the procedure. The test had to be done at an off-site lab to avoid cross-contamination. The results would take a few days.\n\n\nSteffy didn't know how she'd handle waiting, and Campbell suggested that Steffy start doing whatever it was she did to relax. Panic wouldn't help, and Steffy needed to keep telling herself what a miracle the child was. Steffy agreed with her doctor, but the moment Dr. Campbell left the room, Steffy's mind flooded with thoughts of sleeping with Bill, learning she was pregnant, and Liam announcing that it was their baby inside her.\n\n\nAt Katie's house, Katie was in her bedroom in a robe, peering through her telescope. Wyatt entered and exclaimed that she was a peeping Tom. She corrected that she was a peeping Katie and said someone had to make sure the neighbors had up tasteful decorations. He doubted that was what neighborhood watch meant.\n\n\nWyatt hoped Katie was still okay with him using the key she'd given him because he could possibly walk in on her with one of her other guys. Katie replied that she'd given Wyatt the key to use, and she'd gotten rid of the other guy hours earlier. She said she'd asked Wyatt there to tell him something that he might not like.\n\n\nChecking out Katie's robe, Wyatt guessed it was supposed to soften the blow. Katie asked if it was working, and then she revealed that she'd told Brooke about them. Wyatt replied that Brooke was still married to his father. \"Technically,\" Katie stated. Wyatt mimed making a noose and hanging himself. He fell out on the bed, and she told him to stop being dramatic.\n\n\nWyatt said that he was dead, and he wanted Katie to have his camper. Katie didn't know what she'd do with that thing, but she offered to take his grill. He didn't think she was understanding the seriousness of how dead he was; however, Katie replied that Bill had other things on his mind, and if he did hear about the relationship, it would go in one ear and out the other.\n\n\nKatie asked what had taken so long for Wyatt to get there. She'd been waiting at least an hour. Wyatt said Liam had been yakking. Katie wanted to know what about. Stammering, Wyatt said his brother was just happy. Katie asked if Liam was playing well with others. Wyatt replied that Liam hadn't blackmailed anyone else, to Wyatt's knowledge, or written any fat checks to the Tofu Tree Society.\n\n\nKatie announced that she had a Christmas present for Wyatt, and it was very good. She opened her robe to reveal a Santa bra and skirt lingerie set she was wearing with black fishnet thigh highs. Wyatt said he loved Christmas, and the two kissed.\n\n\nKatie wondered if she could say something crazy to Wyatt, and he asked if she hadn't done that already. The kind of crazy she meant was to suggest that they go to a movie or game. She'd never had a closed-door relationship before and was still trying to figure out what the rules were. Wyatt believed that the first rule should be to please themselves.\n\n\nWyatt thought Katie was wild, fun, and sexy, and he loved spending time with her. He just didn't think anyone else would believe they were a good idea. He didn't want to hear from those people. Katie didn't, either. He decided that they should keep doing \"this\" until they figured out something else they wanted to do. In his view, other people worried about the future so much that they forgot to have a present.\n\n\nKatie said that Wyatt was \"so sensible.\" Wyatt quipped that he'd thought that about her until he'd discovered her wild side. She ripped open his shirt, giggled, and said she'd always wanted to do that. Claiming to still be practical, she stated that she had a brand-new shirt for him in the closet.\n\n\nWyatt noted that his pants were unfortunately still on. Katie told him that she had a cure for that, too, and she kissed him.\n\n\nLater, Wyatt and Katie were lying in bed, and he said he'd gotten her something. He pulled a red jewelry box from his pants beside him on the floor. Katie opened the box and saw smoky stoned earrings. She said they were beautiful, but from her tone, he gleaned that she didn't like them. Kate replied that, in her experience, men gave jewelry because they felt guilty.\n\n\nWyatt didn't feel guilty. He knew that he'd see her at Eric's house for Christmas, but it wouldn't be \"the same.\" Katie agreed that it wouldn't be. Wyatt continued, saying he'd decided to give her something secret from him that she could wear, something that could touch her when he couldn't. Katie thanked him, and they kissed each other.\n\n\n",

He says his Christmas bonus will be Bill to tell him if he ever gets down or unhappy; just remind him how happy he is right now with Steffy and they will have a rich future together. Bill tries to get the convo around to the doctor visit but Liam is not talking. He tries to call Steffy who is at her doctor appointment and because Bill is listening he is pretty vague when he inquires what Steffy is doing or where she is. She tells him she is checking out the pre-natal classes and yes she did take her vitamins. After their moment in bed, Wyatt brings out a present for Katie since they will be with family later and he wants this to be a secret. It is a lovely pair of earrings. She says it has been her experience that men usually do that when they feel guilty but Wyatt assures him that this is the case here. He just wanted to give her something that she could wear and always think of him. Liam gives Bill an early gift and says he can only hope if he is fortunate enough to be a dad that he will be as generous and kind as Bill is. He loves him; they hug.
