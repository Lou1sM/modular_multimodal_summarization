    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Brooke's house, Liam stormed in. He hadn't slept all night, and he wanted to talk to Hope. Brooke argued against it, but he asked if Hope was at the office or upstairs. Brooke stated that she didn't know where Hope was, and Hope hadn't been home at all the previous night.\n\n\nBrooke asked what Hope had seen at the cabin. Liam claimed that nothing had happened, but Brooke doubted Hope would take off on her wedding day over nothing. Liam revealed that Steffy had visited to share the news with him that she could conceive again. Brooke said she was happy for Steffy. He replied that he was, too, and after he'd hugged Steffy, she'd left.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Steffy wanted Liam back. Liam said it had been pretty clear that it wouldn't happen, but Brooke concluded that Steffy probably did want him back. He wondered why it mattered -- as long as Hope didn't think Steffy did. Brooke reminded him that Steffy was a sensitive subject, and Hope was done with constantly worrying that something could happen.\n\n\nBrooke found it convenient that Steffy had popped up on Liam's wedding day and advised Liam to leave Hope alone and let her be with someone who made her happy. Assuming that Brooke meant Wyatt, the frustrated Liam said he thought that Wyatt had been good and gone.\n\n\nBrooke was upset because Liam should have known not to have Steffy there. Liam said he hadn't known Steffy would be there, and since the wedding hadn't been a secret, Steffy could have found out about it. He exclaimed that he'd told Steffy that he was committed to Hope. Brooke asked if Steffy had been okay with it. \"Yes, because she'd heard me say it a million times before!\" Liam replied.\n\n\nLiam wondered why Hope had even been at the cabin. Brooke replied that he'd written a note asking Hope to break tradition and meet him there. \"I asked her to come?\" Liam asked. He scoffed and stated that he hadn't written any note. Brooke figured that Steffy had done it. Realization washed over Liam. \"That damn woman,\" he said and concluded that Quinn had set him up again.\n\n\nBrooke asked if Liam really thought Quinn would write the note, and Liam declared that Quinn would do anything to put Hope and Wyatt together. Brooke didn't think it mattered because Hope was done after finding Liam in an intimate situation with Steffy right before the wedding.\n\n\nLiam said he wasn't going to accept that the incident had caused the end of him and Hope. He figured that Hope was hiding out at the moment, but he'd eventually be able to explain things to her. Liam decided that, in the meantime, he had something he needed to do -- have it out with Quinn.\n\n\nAt Forrester, Donna was dismayed to see Quinn in Eric's office with a glass of champagne. Donna was ready to call security; however, Quinn quipped that it would be foolish, and it would piss her off. Quinn relayed that Liam's wrong had been righted, and she was working with Forrester again.\n\n\nDonna assumed it had something to do with Hope's failed wedding. Quinn said it was Hope's story to tell, but Hope was away with Wyatt. Quinn was certain they'd return as an item, which would secure Quinn's position at Forrester. \"So you really don't want to get on my bad side,\" Quinn warned.\n\n\nPouring more champagne, Quinn relayed that she was in a celebratory mood due to the success of her and her son, but she doubted that Donna wanted to celebrate the return of \"the dreaded Quinn.\" Donna guessed \"this\" was about Eric. \"He likes me,\" Quinn smugly replied. Donna retorted that he didn't know Quinn.\n\n\nQuinn warned that it wouldn't be wise to sabotage her, but Donna replied that Quinn didn't need any help with that. Quinn said it wouldn't happen, and things were finally paying off for her and Wyatt. Donna cited that Liam and Hope had been down before, but they'd always wound up back together and stronger.\n\n\n\"Well, there is a last time for everything,\" Quinn quipped. She said that Hope and Wyatt were in Hawaii, and it was the perfect opportunity for her convincing son to get Hope to choose him. Donna said that Wyatt was funny and handsome, and one day, he'd make a young woman very lucky.\n\n\nQuinn declared that the woman would be Hope. Donna felt that Quinn was underestimating Hope and Liam's connection, and even the likes of Bill hadn't broken them up. Quinn insisted that Wyatt and Hope were at the beginning of their connection and starting the life they'd been prepping for personally and professionally. \"I'm a fact of your life, Donna. Deal with it,\" Quinn asserted.\n\n\nLater, Quinn was alone and still enjoying her champagne when Liam rushed in and accused her of writing the note that had been left for Hope. Quinn guessed that Liam was upset and looking for someone to blame for yet another derailed wedding. Though she looked more smug than afraid, she decided that Liam's look was threatening, and until he cooled off, she had no intention of talking to him.\n\n\nAs Quinn strode out, Liam told her that she wasn't getting away with it. Quinn passed Donna in the hallway, and as Donna glared at her, Quinn told Donna to shut up.\n\n\nDonna went into the CEO's office, where Liam filled her in on his suspicions about Quinn sending Hope to the cabin to see Steffy there. Donna said she wouldn't put it past that awful woman. \"Thank you!\" Liam exclaimed. Donna relayed that Quinn had been bragging about Hope and Wyatt going to Hawaii. \"I owe you one, Donna,\" Liam said and took off.\n\n\nIn Hawaii, Wyatt arrived at Hope's hotel room door with an orchid. Hope wasn't in the mood for breakfast, and Wyatt noted that she hadn't talked much the previous night. Shrugging, Hope conveyed that she'd found Steffy in Liam's arms, and Hope hadn't hung around to see the smug look on Steffy's face that would have said, \"'See? I can have him back whenever I want him.'\"\n\n\nWyatt asked what Liam and Steffy had been doing. Hope said it had been the same as always; they'd been locking eyes as if they were the only people on the planet. Wyatt asked why Hope had gone to see Liam, and she relayed that Liam had sent a note to meet him.\n\n\nWyatt didn't think it made sense for Liam to do that if he knew Steffy were there. Hope called it classic Steffy. Hope believed that Steffy had engineered it so that Hope could see that Steffy would always be in Liam's life, and Hope said she'd finally learned the lesson. She just wished she wasn't learning the same one again and again.\n\n\nWyatt thought that Liam was an idiot, and it was a good thing that Hope wasn't home, where Liam would be beating down her door, trying to explain. Hope said she'd heard of all the reasons that Liam would choose to be with Steffy before, and though Liam's explanations always seemed logical, \"to me, it will always be unacceptable,\" Hope concluded.\n\n\nHope called her mother to say that she was okay. Brooke said she knew about Steffy, and Hope guessed that her mother understood why she'd left. Brooke tried to tell Hope what had happened, but Hope was too exhausted with the whole matter to even talk about it.\n\n\nAfter the call, Wyatt proposed that he and Hope spend the holiday in Hawaii. Hope readily agreed. She said she should have known something was wrong when the wedding had been a part of an ultimatum, and Steffy in Liam's life would never be okay with Hope. Wyatt suggested that Hope put Liam in the past and let Wyatt make her happy.\n\n\nHope sighed, and Wyatt said he'd been patient. He loved Hope, and he asked what better place than Hawaii to start the rest of their lives together. He promised that, if she gave it a chance, she wouldn't regret it, and he kissed her deeply. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "At Brooke's Liam paces the floor and tells her that he's been up all night. He's been calling Hope, texting her and she is not answering or responding. Brooke says can he blame Hope \u0096 Steffy again. He says whoa; this is all just a big misunderstanding. Brooke says Hope did not come home last night and she does not know where she is. And Brooke probably wouldn't even tell him if she knew. He says okay, be mad at him but do it later. He needs to find Hope now. He knows he has screwed up royally. Brooke wants to know what Steffy said or that Hope could have seen. Liam says nothing happened. He did not know Steffy was coming but she had incredible news. She can now have a baby. She got emotional and he gave her a hug, Brooke scolds him for things like this always happening with Steffy. Liam just needs to let Hope go and let her go be with someone who makes her happy. It dawns on him that Brooke is talking about Wyatt. He thought he had left town. In Hawaii Hope is in her hotel room looking out over the blue ocean. There is a knock at the door and it's Wyatt. He is holding an orchid. He says he looked all over to find a flower that was worthy of her and this was the closest he could find. He wants to call room service for breakfast but Hope says she is good. Wyatt says okay then promise him she will have lunch with him. He doesn't want her to get all light headed on him. He says they did not really talk much last night. Is she ready to tell him what she saw at the cabin? She says she saw Steffy in Liam's arms. She doesn't know what happened after that; she didn't stick around. He says it's okay; she will be okay as she is with him now. She's safe. Hope says she didn't stick around to hear more justifications or excuses or even the smug look on Steffy's face ..you know the one that says see I can get him back anytime I want him. They were looking into each other's eyes like they were the only ones on the planet. Wyatt asks if she saw them in the cabin. She says yes as Liam was getting dressed there. Wyatt doesn't understand why Hope would be seeing Liam just before the wedding. She says it was Liam's idea. He sent her a note to meet him. Wyatt says that doesn't make sense since Steffy was there. Hope says Wyatt doesn't know Steffy and that's one of the things she likes about him. She says it's obvious; it's classic Steffy just wanting Hope to see them. She was letting Hope know that things haven't changed. She will always be part of his life. Hope says she thinks she is just now understanding that ..message delivered, message received. Donna is shocked to find Quinn sitting in Eric's office and sipping champagne. Donna says Quinn should be cleaning out her desk, not taking over Eric's office. Looking smug, Quinn says guess the word is not out yet but Hope hired them back. QAJ's is here to stay. Donna says she is calling security. Quinn says that would only accomplish two things. She would look incredibly foolish and she would piss Quinn off. Donna says then maybe Quinn can tell her what happened. Quinn says a terrible wrong was righted. Liam went on a power trip and Hope's personal life spilled over into her professional. But power is fleeting and Liam's is gone. Donna says this must have something to do with Hope walking out on the wedding. Quinn says Bingo. But it's Hope's story to tell. All she can tell Donna is that she does know where Hope is. She is with Wyatt and they are away and when they return they will be an item and will secure their position here. So Donna does not want to be on her bad side. Just be nice and respectful and everything will be fine. Cheers. Quinn pours herself another glass of bubbly and says life is fascinating. This time last year she and Wyatt were in their little warehouse, toiling away and struggling for survival. Now look at them. Partnering with FC on one of the hottest lines going; the possibilities are endless. But she guesses Donna would not feel like celebrating the return of the dreaded Quinn. Donna says she guesses that is in reference to Eric. Quinn admits that he likes her. Donna grins and says Eric doesn't really know Quinn. Donna has a clearer picture. Quinn says it would not pay for Donna to try and sabotage her. Donna replies she has a feeling Quinn will not need help on that one. Quinn says she has worked far too long and too hard and things are finally paying off for her and Wyatt. Donna warns Quinn a word of advice. Hope and Liam have been here before. They plan a wedding and something always happens with Steffy. But here's the thing; they always end up back together. Quinn gloats that there is always a last time for everything. Hope and Wyatt are on the beautiful island of Hawaii. It is the perfect opportunity for him to convince her to choose him. And her son can be very convincing. Brooke tells Liam that she can't believe he let this thing happen. Just seeing Steffy there would devastate Hope. He snaps that she is acting like he set this in motion. He didn't know Steffy was going to be there; she just showed up. He doesn't even know why Hope was at the cabin in the first place. Brooke says because of the note that Liam sent. He argues that he did not send a note. Brooke says maybe Steffy then. Then he blurts out \u0096 that damn woman, Quinn. She has set him up again. Hope is mad right now but she has to come home and he will explain all that is going on right now. For now he is going to have it out with Quinn. Quinn offers Donna champagne but she declines. She tells Quinn that she likes Wyatt. He's smart, funny, even handsome and some day he will make a lucky girl very happy. Quinn says that will be Hope; just look at how her eyes light up now that Liam is out of the picture. Donna says that is just it. He will be back in Hope's life soon. They've had years of obstacles in their way and only came out stronger. Not just Steffy but Bill as well. They have overcome them all. Quinn says Hope and Wyatt are just at the beginning of their connection and they finally have the chance to do what they have been prepping for both personally and professionally which means QAJ is here for the long haul. She says she is a fact of Donna's life so deal with it. Wyatt says he won't be a hypocrite. He's not sorry that she did not marry Liam, but he is sorry that he got hurt. She says you live and learn. She just wishes she weren't learning the same old thing over and over and over. Wyatt says Liam is the idiot. He treats her badly, always letting her down, betraying her trust and then takes her for granted that she will always be there. She shouldn't have to put up with that. She agrees. Wyatt says it is a good thing she is not home as Liam would be there beating down the door trying to explain again. She says she knows. His explanations are always logical and innocent but to her they will always be unacceptable. Quinn pours another glass and Liam comes bounding in and says she set him up. He won't even bother to explain it as she knows it all. She wrote the note. She says she knows he is upset over another derailed wedding to Hope and is looking for someone to blame. She adds but until he cools off she has absolutely no intentions of talking to him. He tells her she is not getting away with this. Quinn walks right past Donna and tells her to shut up. Brooke is happy to hear from Hope and that she is all right but Hope doesn't want to say where she is. Brooke tells her Liam was just there so she knows all about Steffy, but there is something Hope should know. Hope doesn't want to hear it now. She says she is exhausted and it always comes back to the same old thing \u0096 Steffy. Hope is just done. Wyatt says he has a great idea. How about they spend their holidays in Hawaii. Hope does not hesitate for a second and says yes. Liam talks to Donna and says he can't prove it but his gut is screaming that Quinn sent the note. Donna says she wouldn't put it past her as she was in here sitting in Eric's office like she owned it drinking his champagne and bragging how Hope and Wyatt were in Hawaii. Liam bolts and tells Donna that he owes her one. Hope says she wanted to be so sure of Liam this time but she knows it is so wrong to get married as the result of an ultimatum. She says she tried to tell herself she was okay with Steffy but it will never be ok. Wyatt says then let Liam go in the past where he belongs. Wyatt can make her happy and she knows that. He says he has been patient and he was gracious in defeat, but Liam messed up again. Let this be the last time. He tells her that he loves her .more than he ever thought he could love someone. They are in Hawaii together now. There is no better place to start their lives. Just give them a chance; she won't regret it. He kisses her and then two or three more. When she puts her arm around his neck there is no engagement ring on her finger.",
