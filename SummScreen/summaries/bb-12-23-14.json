    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Forrester, Maya, Rick, Pam, and Ivy met. Rick and Pam shared stories about Forrester Christmases. Pam turned on a carousel that had been in the family for years. She also made everyone giggle when she showed off her illuminated holiday necklace.\n\n\nIvy teased that they needed to add illuminated jewelry to the upcoming couture line. They discussed the Christmas festivities at Eric's, and Rick added that everyone volunteered at the mission prior to attending the dinner party at Eric's.\n\n\nIvy agreed that it was a great idea, and Maya insisted that she wanted to help, and she promised to take mashed potatoes to dinner. Pam reminded that it would be awkward to have Maya volunteer at the mission or to attend the open house at Eric's. Ivy agreed. Maya wanted an invitation.\n\n\nPam left, and Maya confronted Ivy for trying to keep Maya away from the Forresters. Rick tried to stop Maya, but Maya dished that Ivy had confronted her the previous day at her condo about her relationship with Rick. Rick reminded Ivy that he'd told her to forget that she'd seen Rick and Maya together.\n\n\nIvy insisted that Rick still loved Caroline -- it had been obvious. Rick disagreed. Maya hissed that Ivy had threatened her to end things with Rick. Ivy defended herself and said that she was concerned about Rick losing both his job and his wife. Maya angrily told Ivy that she'd made a big deal about one little kiss, but Ivy said she'd known it was much more than that.\n\n\nRick threatened Ivy's job at Forrester and her stay in the United States. \"You like your job, right? Then pretend you know nothing about us,\" he ordered. Maya smirked, and Ivy sneered at Maya.\n\n\nIvy attempted to leave, but Maya stopped her and warned that Maya and Rick had a long history as a serious couple \"before Caroline's claws came out.\" Ivy wondered again if they were both willing to risk everything. Rick dismissed Ivy, and Maya smiled. Rick worried that Ivy would say something, but Maya confidently predicted Ivy would say nothing. Rick worried that he had to get his father's signature quickly.\n\n\nMaya purred that she hoped Rick would leave the Christmas dinner at Eric's and join her at the luxury condo. Rick asked if she liked her new home, and she replied that she loved it, but she would love it more when he was there full-time. Maya wondered if Rick was being intimate with Caroline, and he said he had not. Maya kissed him passionately.\n\n\nRick advised Maya to stop because someone could walk in. He added that she had to remember he had tried to fire her in front of everyone at a recent meeting in order to convince the Forrester team that he had renewed his marriage with Caroline. Caroline remembered that it had been \"the performance of lifetime\" for her. Rick promised that they would spend the next Christmas together. Later, at the mission, Rick entered with Maya, and he announced that they would be there for Christmas. \"Wow,\" she said.\n\n\nOn the rooftop, Ivy's father, John, shared with Jared that he felt bad that Pam had been mourning the loss of her dog for years. He had wanted to get her something special, and he set up a fashion show with dogs from a shelter for Pam to choose a new dog.\n\n\nInside at Forrester, Wyatt sat restlessly at his desk. Pam entered and tried to cheer him up with her Christmas sweater and her illuminated necklace. Wyatt couldn't muster a smile. Pam asked how he'd been doing and if he'd talked to Hope. Wyatt answered that he'd spoken to Hope the previous night \"for five seconds.\"\n\n\nWyatt added that Hope would stay in Italy for Christmas. Pam guessed that Hope didn't want to leave her mom alone, but Wyatt was convinced she didn't want to return to him. Pam and Wyatt walked out to her desk in the reception area, and Wyatt looked at the photo of Pam's dog, Tiny, who had passed away years earlier. Pam lamented that everyone at Forrester had known how much Tiny had meant to her. Wyatt said Tiny looked like a friendly fellow.\n\n\nPam encouraged Wyatt to attend the Forrester Open House at Eric's for Christmas. Wyatt thanked her, but he declined and left. Pam flashed back to happier times with Tiny.\n\n\nJohn showed up and interrupted Pam's daydream about Tiny. John begged for a hug. John teased that Chuck, meaning Charlie, hadn't been hanging around her. Pam laughed and said that it was Charlie's day off. John invited Pam up to the sky lounge.\n\n\nIn Wyatt's office, Wyatt moped alone, and Ivy entered. Wyatt shared that Hope would not return home. Wyatt feared that Hope continued to push him away. Ivy said she felt sorry for Hope, but she added that they had both lost a baby and should be grieving and healing together.\n\n\nWyatt agreed with Ivy, but he felt Hope had decided to move on without him. Ivy tried to comfort Wyatt. Ivy noted that Hope loved Wyatt, and she encouraged him to have faith. Wyatt asked about Ivy's plans because it was \"the most wonderful time of the year,\" he said, mocking the song. Ivy said she would spend Christmas with Liam.\n\n\nWyatt was surprised, He said that he'd thought that Liam would have been in Italy with Hope. Ivy looked uncomfortable. Wyatt asked if Hope and Liam had been talking. Ivy admitted that she had not asked, and Liam had not said anything. Wyatt cautioned Ivy about making plans, and Ivy looked away.\n\n\nOn the rooftop sky lounge at Forrester, John and Jared surprised Pam with a parade of dogs, and they hoped that Pam would choose a new dog. The dogs included Bernie, a tiny lapdog; Brando, a bulldog; Diablo, a miniature collie; and Pixie, a larger dog. Pam insisted that she could never choose one.\n\n\nPam thanked Jared and John, and she said she needed another year to decide what she wanted. Jared understood. He said that Forrester employees had already expressed interest in most of the dogs if Pam hadn't wanted them. Pam thanked Jared and John for the effort. John pulled out some mistletoe and asked for a kiss, and Pam obliged. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "With the holiday just around the corner, Wyatt is beside himself unaware of the current status of his marriage or what his future holds. Knowing that Pam misses a particular loved one around the holidays, John surprises her by making her the guest of honor at the best show in town. Out of fear that Ivy may become a hindrance, Rick fells anxious to get Eric to sign the legal documents as soon as possible.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Pam shows Ivy and Maya a musical miniature carousel in Rick's office. She says it has been in the Forrester family for years. Maya is delighted to hear there will be an open house at Eric's on Christmas Day and hopes she is invited. Both Pam and Ivy scoff at the idea as being too awkward. Rick assures her Eric said all are welcome but they pay the price of admission by helping out at the mission and feeding the homeless. Maya calls out Ivy about being so bright and cheerful after what she did last night. Rick wants to know what's the matter. Maya promptly tells him that Ivy came by to see her last night and it wasn't to bring her a housewarming gift. She confronted her about their kiss. Rick glares at Ivy and then tells her she is not to mention that again if she enjoys working here. He hopes she understands that. Ivy says she is concerned about him and Caroline. She knows he still loves Caroline and that is why he is lashing out. He tells her that he told her to drop this. John tells Jarrett that it's been too long since Pam lost her little dog and it's time to put a smile on that face again. He says his own tail is wagging just thinking about this. Pam will love it. Pam finds a morose Wyatt who is trying to work but not making much progress. She asks about Hope and he says yeah he talked to her last night for about five seconds. She is not coming home for Christmas. Pam tries to cheer him by saying perhaps she did not want her mom to spend it alone. She shows him a photo of Tiny, her best friend, who passed away several years ago. She tells Wyatt that Eric is having an open house on Christmas and he really should come and not be alone that day. He thanks her but says he thinks he will just lay low. John pops in to surprise Pam and asks what does a man have to do to get a hug around here, so she obliges. He asks is Chuck here and she says no Charlie is not working today. John says great then his wish has been granted, now to Pam's wish. Rick tells Maya that he doesn't like it that Ivy knows. Maya says it will be okay, she won't say anything. She wants to protect Caroline and she likes her job here too much. He tells Maya that he needs to get his dad to sign those papers as soon as possible to secure his position as CEO. Ivy tries to draw Wyatt into a conversation while working but he's off in a distance. She says she is sorry he is hurting with Hope gone. He says and she is not coming home any time soon. He gets that she is heartbroken but they both lost that child. They should be healing together and supporting each other. He does not know now where he stands with his wife. She tells him Hope loves him and this is just her way of dealing with things and it is only temporary. He just has to have a little faith and she will return. He asks her what her plans are for the holiday and she replies to spend it with Liam. He is surprised and she asks why. Wyatt says he thought Liam might be in Italy and perhaps they had talked about it. Ivy says no. Wyatt suggests that it might be a good idea to find out. Maya wants to pin Rick down about spending more time with her after his Christmas dinner at Eric's. Then she gets off on the subject of spending the night and gets him to answer that he is not with Caroline in that way. She kisses him and he gently pushes her away and warns her that he is supposed to be mad at her and fired her so they can't be seen doing this. John leads Pam out to the Sky Lounge and prepares her for her surprise. Jarrett pulls back the blue curtain and out comes Bernie, a cute little dog. John says is just one of many in the poochie parade and she gets to choose which one she likes best, his gift to her. John gives the commentary as they parade around. Pam says they are all beautiful and she could never pick just one and it is just a little too soon, maybe next year. She tells John she can never thank him enough, this was so special. He says he knows a way. He pulls out some mistletoe out of his pocket and puckers up. She gives him a kiss. Down at the shelter Rick shows Maya around. He says this is the mission of miracles and tomorrow she will be part of it all.",
