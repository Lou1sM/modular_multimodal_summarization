    "tvmega_recap": "Jackie fusses with some models and carps to Nicky that the designs are not special enough to start over Forrester Creations. He's only half listening as memories of Jerry Kramer keep cropping up. He calls Taylor and wants to see her immediately despite Jackie telling him that this was a man they hardly knew so why worry about it? Taylor agrees to meet him, he wants it to be the boat. Stephanie stops by and remarks that there is a world of difference between being a shop girl and a fashion house owner. If she releases these things, she will be the laughing stock of the business. She shares her opinion of Taylor but repeats she doesn't think Taylor can do him any good. Stephanie calls her a fraud and maybe Taylor will figure that out too. Taylor delves into Nick's mind about why he did like but suddenly didn't want Kramer in their lives. Concentrating, he grimaces as he remembers being a little boy and they are coming and going at all hours, someone is behind her door hurting her but damn it, he can't remember the details. She asks him to close his eyes, breath deep and focus and think again. Could they have been making love? What was it about the ship's horn? He finally remembers it was Kramer's boat horn that he always blew when he got close to their apartment. He recalls looking through the keyhole and seeing strange men with his mother and always giving her money. Then profusely sweating and almost choking on his words, he states that it was sex and money - his mother was a WHORE.",
