The doctor told her that she hadn't heard anything yet but promised Steffy that she would have the results by the end of the day.\n\n\nSteffy hung up and flashed back to happy times with Liam: their first wedding, making love, their recent engagement, and the news that they were expecting a baby. Liam entered the house after a run. Steffy asked about his run, and he said it was a perfect day with weather, waves, and his \"beautiful wife carrying my child.\" They embraced, and Steffy looked concerned.\n\n\nLiam felt Steffy's tummy and said he felt movement. Steffy laughed and said it was way too early. Steffy said she hoped the baby was just like him. \"That's what I'm hoping and praying for,\" she said.\n\n\nLater, Liam prepared for work and said he was looking forward to work -- something he hadn't thought would happen a short time before when his father had vowed revenge against him. Steffy didn't want to think about it. Liam agreed. They needed to have only positive thoughts for the baby. They hugged and said they loved each other. Steffy smiled. After Liam left, Steffy worried that Bill had vowed revenge. She flashed back to Bill's statements about vowing revenge against Liam. She picked up her phone and left.\n\n\nAt Brooke's, Brooke and Thorne discussed that Brooke was engaged, and it was time for Thorne to move out. Thorne insisted she should not be engaged to his brother. Later, Thorne had his bags packed. Brooke said it was best for everyone. Thorne promised that no matter what happened, he would always be around. He kissed her on the forehead and left. Brooke looked concerned.\n\n\nAt Katie's, Katie was dressed in lingerie, and someone knocked on the door. She asked who it was, and Wyatt said it was the plumber to fix the water heater. She opened the door, and Wyatt was dressed as a plumber with a fake moustache. They role-played a distressed woman and a plumber, but Wyatt said he had to leave because he was going to miss a meeting. He promised to return as soon as he could. Katie teased that she had needs. Wyatt left.\n\n\nA short time later, someone knocked on Katie's door again, and she assumed Wyatt had returned. She ran to the door -- still in her lingerie -- and opened it to find Thorne. They were both embarrassed, but she invited Thorne inside. Katie asked what he wanted.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Bill flashed back to when Steffy had shared that she had happy news and was pregnant. \"There is a possibility that child is mine,\" Bill had said. Justin entered and noticed Bill deep in thought. \"Santa wasn't good to you? Want to talk about it?\" Justin offered. Bill seemed interested, but he received a text message and said he had to leave for a meeting. Justin sensed something was wrong but said he wouldn't pry.\n\n\nLater at Spencer, Wyatt and Liam were waiting for Bill for a meeting. Liam explained that Justin had told him that Bill had left the building for a meeting. Wyatt was upset because he'd had something going on. Liam quizzed him and assumed it was a woman, but Wyatt covered.\n\n\nWyatt turned the conversation to how Bill would react to the news that he was about to have his first grandchild. \"Imagine him as a grandpa,\" Wyatt said. He and Liam laughed about what Bill would be like. Liam and Wyatt discussed how Grandpa Dollar Bill would get along with the baby. Wyatt noted that Bill got along really well with Steffy. Wyatt said the baby would draw the family even closer together. Wyatt and Liam said that Bill would \"spoil that kid rotten.\"\n\n\nAt Bill's house, Bill met with Steffy, and she apologized for the urgency, but she had to ask him something. \"You can't lie to me, Bill,\" she said. Bill agreed and said he was concerned about Steffy and the baby.\n\n\nSteffy asked if Bill was concerned about her marriage. Bill agreed he was. Steffy asked if Bill had used her at the guesthouse in order to get revenge on Liam. Bill was shocked.\n\n\nSteffy reminded Bill that he had said more than once that he would get revenge on Liam. Bill countered that he and Liam had made peace. \"My God, I would never. That night was about us -- nothing else,\" Bill said. He added that he and Steffy had a history, and he had wanted to take away the pain that Steffy had suffered over Liam's involvement with Sally.\n\n\nBill claimed that he and Steffy had been there for each other. He called it love and not lust. \"I believe you,\" Steffy said. Bill apologized for putting her in the situation. Steffy said she had a meeting with her doctor. Bill offered to take her. \"No, this is my journey,\" she said and added that she wanted to make sure the baby she was carrying was her husband's. She left, and Bill looked worried.\n\n\nAt the doctor's office, Steffy paced while she waited for the doctor. The doctor entered, and Steffy blurted out how stressed she was. The doctor tried to calm her and encouraged her to stop stressing and to breathe. \"Doctor, I need to know!\" Steffy begged.\n\n\n",
