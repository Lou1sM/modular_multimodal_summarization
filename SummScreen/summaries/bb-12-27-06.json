Once Stephanie realizes that she has hit a nerve she runs with it,  asking Jackie if she is worried that Nick will find out what a slut she is. Jackie can't believe how close Stephanie is to the truth.  Frantically she lunges at Stephanie trying to slap her, but Stephanie holds her off effortlessly. \n\n\nOn the Shady Marlin, Nick is horrified when he remembers that Jackie was a paid prostitute to all of the sailors including Captain Kramer.  Nick doesn't understand why he is just remembering this now.  Taylor explains that he held the memory in because  he adored his mother and would never have wanted to shame her when he found out; he only wanted to make her life better.  Nick says he remembers pretending he didn't know what was going on and Taylor feels that is probably the most loving thing he could have done at the time.  Nick said he used to hide and be very quiet until Jackie was paid and the men left.  He angrily tells Taylor that he knows the difference between right and wrong and his mother could have found a respectable way to earn money if she had tried.  Taylor suggests that is why right and wrong is such a high priority in Nick's life and why he holds himself and others to such high standards.  She thinks when people violate Nick's standards he doesn't give them a second chance.  Nick says that is why he left home at 16 on the first ship that would have him.  He says Jackie was upset  when he told her that he wanted to be a sailor, but that was the quickest route to get him the furthest away from her life.  He didn't want to be like the sailors who used his mother, but he was determined to be giving them orders one day, so he worked his way up to the top.  Even though Nick sent money to his mother, he tells Taylor he didn't go back to visit anymore for a long time.  Nick doesn't understand how remembering this awful thing about his mother can possibly help him now. Taylor thinks his new awareness will affect his life positively. Before he faced the truth, Taylor said he responded  to humiliation by trying to overcome those who caused it.  She feels it also it made him overprotective of the women in his life because he couldn't do that for his mother.  She hopes this memory will help him to see himself in a new light.  Nick thanks her for caring so much about him.  After Taylor leaves, Jackie walks in to find Nick brooding.  Fearing what Nick might have recalled in his session with Taylor, Jackie nervously blathers on about Clark's inadequacies as a designer.    Sensing that her son is not himself, Jackie encourages him to stop therapy and get  back to work.  Nick brings up their past when they had no money.  Jackie says at least they always had their pride, but Nick disagrees.  He questions her again about the pearls he gave her from Kramer and she admits that she sold them.  Nick wishes he could have given  her more to pawn.  Not liking the direction their conversation is heading, Jackie attempts to leave for Forrester.  Nick stops her, demanding for her to tell him the truth about how she supported them while he was a child.  He stresses that nothing she could tell him would be any worse than what he already thinks.\n\n\nMeanwhile, back in Taylor's office, she records her thoughts about Nick's session.  She fears it may have been his last session due to his negative feelings toward therapy.  Stephanie drops by and overhears her saying that Jackie had been a prostitute.   \n\n\n",

Taylor realises how Nick blocked the memories from his mind and replaced them with false memories that the sailors were his friends. Stephanie is stunned how badly Jackie reacts when she accuses her of being a slut. Jackie later visits Nick and questions him on his mood. Nick tries to make Jackie admit to their past, but she refuses to face what really happened. Taylor returns to her office and makes audio records of her session with Nick.
