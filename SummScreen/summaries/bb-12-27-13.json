Brooke abruptly said they weren't, and Ridge figured that he hadn't interrupted anything. Bill grimaced, and Ridge asked why Bill was there. \"Why are you here?\" Bill shot back.\n\n\nRidge explained that he was there for a surprise lunch. Bill said Ridge had risked that Brooke might be unavailable, and it had turned out that she was. Brooke interjected that she and Ridge had things to discuss. Because he had another appointment, Bill relented, but he said he'd see her again.\n\n\nLater, Ridge and Brooke sat down to a candlelit lunch with food from the new Caf\u00e9 Russe. Ridge made a toast to new beginnings, but Brooke said that they needed to discuss Bill. Ridge replied that Steffy had told him that Katie and Bill had gotten a divorce, and Ridge had assumed that it had been because Bill had found another woman.\n\n\nBrooke said there had been another woman, and Ridge asked if the other woman had known all that Katie had gone through to give birth to Will. Brooke stated that the woman had known it all, and Ridge asked if anyone had confronted the woman. Brooke replied that people had, and she'd done it herself many times. Ridge asked what the woman had said for herself.\n\n\nBrooke sadly replied that the woman had said something about being lonely and something about love. Scoffing, Ridge replied that love didn't take what it wanted while destroying everyone else. Tears rolled down Brooke's face, and she quietly revealed she'd been the woman.\n\n\nBrooke explained to Ridge how things had been when Katie had pushed Bill and Brooke together. Brooke had never thought she'd feel for anyone after Ridge had left, but \"suddenly, this man...\" Ridge asserted that the man had been her sister's husband. Brooke said she'd tried to make excuses for herself, but she shouldn't have been in the situation.\n\n\nBrooke recalled that Katie had had it all, but she'd been morose and mishandling things with Bill. Ridge uttered that it was what people did when they were in love; they mishandled things. Brooke said she'd never stopped loving Ridge, but she'd also never thought they could have a chance again. She asked if that had been why he'd returned -- to reunite their family. Ridge just silently stared at her.\n\n\nAt Spencer, Katie busily worked and fed Will, who was dressed up to spend time with his father. Katie asked Adele to get Bill's favorite coffee ready, and Adele expressed surprise that Bill would have Will's visitation at the office. Katie replied that it was just for the time being because Bill's last address had been unsuitable.\n\n\nLater, Bill arrived and expressed an interest in taking Will to the park. Katie said it wasn't a problem to stay there because she'd cleared her schedule. Bill promised he wouldn't take the boy to Brooke's, and Katie figured that Brooke wouldn't let Bill in even if he tried. He revealed that he'd just been at Brooke's, but she'd put him out. He said there was a new situation, and its name was Ridge.\n\n\nKatie played with Will on a palette, and Bill smiled as he flashed back on times with Katie and the baby. Katie asked how Ridge had responded to Bill and Brooke's affair. Bill doubted Ridge knew about it, and Katie replied that Brooke never learned.\n\n\nBill was sure that once Ridge figured out that Brooke hadn't been sitting around waiting for him, he'd go someplace else. \"What if he doesn't? If he wants my sister, he'll have her. That's the way it's always been,\" Katie replied.\n\n\nIn Eric's office, Donna organized the desk, and Quinn entered, looking for Eric. Donna asked if it was okay that Eric had taken the jet to San Francisco -- since Wyatt hadn't needed it. Quinn warned Donna about how she treated Quinn, but unworried, Donna said that Quinn didn't understand loyalty.\n\n\nAs Quinn turned to leave, Donna asked if, during Quinn's call to Wyatt earlier, Wyatt had mentioned Liam's arrival in Hawaii. The shocked Quinn accused Donna of giving employee information to an outsider. Scoffing, Donna said Liam wasn't an outsider, and he'd been in love with Hope for years.\n\n\nDonna asked if Wyatt knew how Quinn operated or if he actually thought he'd won fairly. \"Or if he even cares?\" Donna pondered. Quinn decided to give Donna a pass because Donna hadn't done much damage, and Liam wouldn't be able to figure out where Wyatt and Hope were staying. Donna, however, remarked that Liam had put a clever app on Hope's phone that would tell him where Hope was at all times. Donna's guess was that he'd already found Hope by then.\n\n\nIn Hawaii, Liam explained to Hope how nonsensical it would be for him to have walked all the way to the house in the middle of getting dressed just to leave her a note asking her to walk all the way to the cabin to see him. Hope said no one cared about the note because the bottom line was that he'd been with Steffy.\n\n\nLiam asserted that Quinn had been the only one who'd known Steffy had been in town, and Hope asked how that could be. He explained that it was because Quinn had flown Steffy back from Paris to cause Hope to wind up with Wyatt. \"Congratulations,\" Liam mirthlessly told Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt saw nothing wrong with Quinn and Steffy flying together, but Liam asked how Steffy could have known exactly where Liam would be and when. Hope recalled seeing Quinn in Brooke's bedroom on the wedding day, and Liam asked if Hope had told Quinn where he'd been.\n\n\nWyatt admitted that he'd told Quinn; however, he hadn't known that she'd been with Steffy or about any note. Wyatt was sick of Liam playing Sherlock Holmes, but Liam wondered if Quinn thought marrying Wyatt off to Hope would create job security.\n\n\nWyatt was willing to suppose his mother had done it, but he said the solution would have been for Liam to send Steffy away. Liam told Hope that he'd be happy to explain why it hadn't been that way, but he wanted to do it in private, so Wyatt wouldn't report it back to his mother to use against them.\n\n\nHope asked for a moment alone with Liam. Wyatt said that it was her call if she thought Liam was worth one more moment of her time. Wyatt left, and Liam explained to Hope that Steffy probably would have talked to him at some point, but the choreography of their wedding day had been all Quinn.\n\n\nLiam explained to Hope that Steffy had gotten the news that she could conceive and take a child to term. Because the barrenness had been the reason that his marriage to Steffy had ended, she'd wanted to tell him about the reversal of her condition. He said it had liberated them both from past regrets. Hope flatly said it was great, and she understood it.\n\n\nLiam asked why Hope had run instead of joining him and Steffy and finding out what they'd been discussing at the time. Hope figured that she should have done that, but the bad and familiar feelings had been overwhelming.\n\n\nLiam was surprised that, after all they'd been through, it had only taken one look to cause her to throw away their future and run to Wyatt. Hope explained that she hadn't heard the conversation, but she'd seen things that he hadn't. Liam said it had been simple; he'd congratulated Steffy, hugged her, and kicked her out.\n\n\nHope thought it was apparent that Steffy wanted to have kids with Liam. Liam agreed that it had probably been in the back of Steffy's mind that he'd leave the wedding to start over with her; however, it had become evident that it wouldn't happen, and Steffy had accepted it.\n\n\nWyatt returned to the room. He'd decided that he'd let Liam trash-talk his mother and him enough, and Wyatt wouldn't let Liam put Hope through any more agony.\n\n\n\"Hope, marry me. Come with me. Marry me,\" Liam said, ignoring Wyatt.\n\n\nWyatt couldn't believe that Liam didn't know when to stop. Still looking at Hope, Liam said they could find a justice of the peace and do it right then. He didn't care how it happened, as long as it happened \"now.\" He said she knew he loved her, and she loved him. He asked her to take his hand and make it right for once and for all. \n\n\n",

Ridge wins out and Bill says he has another appointment so Bon appetite. Katie is at the office feeding Will. She has to cancel some appointments before Bill arrives. He's happy to stay there and play with Will and assures Katie that he is not taking Will to Brooke's. He was just there and she asked him to leave. There's a little situation \u0096 Ridge. Donna and Quinn have an edgy conversation about Donna blabbing the whereabouts of two employees to an outsider. She wonders if Quinn's son knows how she operates. Does he think he won Hope fair and square or does he even care. Quinn says she is going to let this pass one time since Donna hasn't done much damage. Hawaii is much bigger than it looks so Liam can island hop until his beard grows in and he won't find Hope. Donna is only too happy to gloat that Liam has one of those little app devices. It puts a mark on the map right where she is. He's probably already there now. Liam asks Hope if she hears what he is saying. Wyatt quips that yeah, Liam's lack of integrity is somehow his mother's fault. Liam starts to explain all over again how he was in the cabin and Steffy showed up. Hope says it does not matter who sent the note; it was that Steffy was there. Liam tells her that is exactly what she was supposed to see. Quinn was the only one who knew Steffy was in L.A. Quinn brought Steffy back from Paris and she wanted Hope here with Wyatt. Wyatt is surprised at this statement. He declares it's possible they met at International. Liam tells Hope go ahead and call Donna and she will find out that Quinn and Steffy shared the jet from Paris. Wyatt says so what if Steffy hitched a ride. Liam shoots that no one else knew she was here. They have been set up again and Wyatt is the reason why. Hope adds that Quinn was at the house to see her for a while but she did not tell her where Liam was. Wyatt admits that he did but he's not sure how it came up and he did not know anything about a note or his mother coming back with Steffy. He's tired of Liam acting like Sherlock Holmes. Liam isn't sure this is some sort of revenge against Bill where Quinn pushes her son toward Hope while Liam is kicked to the curb....or marrying Wyatt off to Hope for Quinn's job security. Wyatt plays the scenario with Quinn being this scheming. When Steffy knocked on the door all Liam had to say was that he was getting married today, she had to leave and then shut the door. Liam is the problem. His first loyalty wasn't to Hope. Liam tells Hope that he will tell her why it didn't go down that way but not in front of Wyatt. He'll report back to Quinn. Hope asks Wyatt for a minute alone with Liam. He shrugs and says if she thinks Liam deserves one more minute of her time, that's her call. She tells Liam that he was on one side of the window, she on the other. He said things, but she saw things. He tells Hope that he was happy for Steffy that she could have babies, he gave her a hug and kicked her out. Hope says and now that Steffy can conceive she probably will want kids with him. He says that isn't why she told him, but yes it might have been in the back of her mind. But he put an end to that and Steffy accepted it. Wyatt comes back into the room and says enough is enough. He's not trashing him or his mother any more. He's not letting Liam put Hope through any more of this either right now. Liam quickly asks Hope to marry him, come with him and marry him. They could find a justice of the peace anywhere. He loves her and he knows that she loves him so they need to make it right for once. Brooke is impressed that Ridge got pepper steaks from the new Cafe Russe. Brooke is uncomfortable but says they need to talk. She starts off with if he knows the problems Katie and Bill have had this year. She ends up saying that other woman was her. Brooke tells Ridge that she tried to make excuses but she knew she was wrong. And she confesses that she never stopped loving Ridge. She certainly never thought she'd be sitting across the table from him or have the chance for them to be a family again. She guesses that is what he wants.",
