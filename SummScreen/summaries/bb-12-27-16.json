    "imdb": "Brooke tries to clarify that her future is with Ridge, but lets it slip that they could not agree on a wedding date yet. Bill then assures Brooke he is not getting back with Katie and that they will be together eventually. At Forrester Creations, Ridge gets Quinn to model a dress for him since the other models are unavailable. When Quinn twists her ankle while posing, Ridge offers some soothing.

Liam and Wyatt disagree on the way Steffy should be portrayed in the media as Forrester Creation's CEO when Pam shows them the new web hit video \"Sexy CEO\". Steffy is taken aback that Wyatt did not run it by her before posting it online, yet cannot share Liam's vehement criticism. Katie sneaks in a quick visit with her neighbor Eric before Quinn returns home. Later, Eric is delighted to hear that Ridge starts to soften towards his wife.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Brooke reminds Bill that she is marrying Ridge. Is Bill ever unsure of himself? Bill says Ridge will break her heart and that is something he will not do. He laughs and says that gives them all the time in the world when she says the timeline now is to wait and get Quinn out of their lives. Ridge tells Quinn as long as she is in his office she can make herself useful. He needs a model for a certain red dress. She says yes King Ridge. Wyatt tells Steffy that he lets her be herself, not like his old stick-in-the-mud brother. He says the world cannot get enough of her. She is an influencer now and now is not the time to diminish that. Liam comes back and he accuses Wyatt of having little respect for Steffy as this is not the real her. This new social media is an insult. Pam comes in and says Wyatt is doing a bang up job. She tells Liam that she really liked the video. Liam grouses again that they do not need a sexy CEO and it is an insult, no one can take her seriously like this. Wyatt tells him to dial that back as the old prude that he is. Bill tells Brooke that it is not fair as Ridge will let her down again, whereas he will be here and they can get on with their life together. She will be his. It is only a matter of time. She is only sacrificing her own happiness for RJ. He's not going anywhere. Katie is getting on with her life and they will co-parent so Will is okay. Katie drops in on Eric (wonder if she checked with Quinn first). She asks about Quinn and says she might not like finding her here. Eric says she is at the office. Quinn tries on the red dress with a long slit. Ridge drops to his knees and starts fiddling with the hem. Quinn looks uncomfortable but she tells Ridge he is really good at this. She gets around to the subject of Brooke and when they are going to get married. He tells her that is none of her business. He is concentrating on the company right now. In twirling around with the new length Quinn falls down with a sprained ankle. Ridge rushes to her and puts his hands on her around the waist and then the leg and then goes to get ice. He puts her foot in his hands and she quips she never thought she would see the day of him taking care of her. She says since he has to keep the ice on her foot they could just chat to get to know each other a little better. She wonders if he is just a little bit upset that his father gave Steffy the CEO job. He says he is doing what is best for the company. He says make no mistake he still despises Quinn despite helping her. She says it is mutual; she still despises him too. But now she will hobble out to the parking lot and go home to her husband. Wyatt tells Steffy and Liam that this is huge, she has another 100,000 followers since last night. Steffy finds it fascinating. Quinn tells Eric all she had to do was almost break her ankle to get Ridge to warm up to her. He is being supportive of Steffy though and he used one of Quinn's designs in the jewelry line. Eric tells her there is only three things he demands of her \u0096 her love, her loyalty and her love yes he said it twice as he wants a double dipping. Liam tells Ridge that it drives him nuts to see Steffy fall more and more into Wyatt's clutches. They have to get rid of Quinn. He wants to know more about this flirting she did to come on to Ridge. Ridge replies whatever it takes to bring down Quinn Fuller he has to take it.",
