Nick is stunned to learn that Jerry pimped Jackie and sent the other sailors around. Jackie stresses that they needed the money, but Nick snaps that she needed the money as she couldn't handle being poor. Stephanie is thrilled at what she has learned, yet Taylor is horrified that Stephanie listened in and plans to use the information to blackmail Jackie into giving the company back to them. Taylor orders Stephanie to secrecy. Jackie later bumps into Stephanie, and Stephanie hints that she knows Jackie's secret. Taylor drops by to see Nick.

Nick remembers bringing Captain Kramer around and hoping that Jackie would like him and that they would fall in love. Nick is angry with Jackie and tells her that he doesn\u2019t know her anymore.  Stephanie tells Taylor that with this information about Jackie, Taylor has now found a way to get the Forresters their company back. Taylor tells Stephanie that if she says anything about Jackie and Captain Kramer, she will not lift a finger to help her get the company back and that any relationship they ever had will be over. Later, Nick blames himself for Jackie\u2019s past and he tells Taylor that it is too late to rescue him. He tells Taylor that he wants her to leave, but she embraces him instead.",
    "imdb": "\nAfter Nick forces his ma to admit her whoring past, she explains how it started as rebelling against her unpractical British upbringing. She got stranded in Seattle, becoming dependent on 4 captains, of which Kramer became her pimp. He scolds her lack of pride and cancels his promise to help her whenever she needs it. Taylor is shocked Stefanie overheard her notes, worse when she intends to use it as pressure to get the company back and even wants her help.    ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sadly Jackie reveals that she did sleep with Kramer, Mays, and a few more \u0096 no first mates for her, just Captains. She admits she was a very sheltered, spoiled, English girl who rebelled. She married a man whom her parents didn't approve. When he died, she had Nick but absolutely no idea how to get on in this world. So yes, she slept with those men for the money. They'd said buy something for the boy, and it didn't seem so wrong. He rails into her for taking the easy way out. Kramer pimped her. Nick states that she didn't just sell herself, she sold him too. And this isn't about forgiveness, he sees her for what she is. He made a promise long ago that he would always love her and be there for her, but that was to someone that no longer exists. Jackie leaves with a broken heart. Taylor jumps all over Stephanie because she is so thrilled to learn that Jackie was sleeping with the entire Navy. And she heard all of this eavesdropping at her door. This is a way to get the company back! What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Nevermind, Taylor says that she could lose her license. Stephanie can NOT use this information to blackmail Nick. Stephanie still feels this is an eye for an eye. Taylor says if she reveals this, their relationship is over. Taylor visits Nick on the boat to see how he is and hopes he won't engage his mother about the circumstances. Too late, she just left. Smugly he says he has no children, no lover and no parents. He's just a stray heap of DNA. But one thing he has - at least he has his pride. He advises her to go, go help someone who has something that deserves to be saved. She doesn't. She hugs him instead and this helps him break down in tears. Jackie drops in on Taylor but only finds Stephanie who needles her about her sordid past.",
