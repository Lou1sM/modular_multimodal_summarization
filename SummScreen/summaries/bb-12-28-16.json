Quinn's foot is better and she tells Eric that she needs to go back to the office. She feels badly for Wyatt and knows it is hard for him to see his wife go home to another man. She says again how kind it was of Ridge to help her with her foot and so quickly that now it is better. When Quinn leaves Eric calls Steffy to come over. She leaves Nicole and Wyatt alone working on some of the PR. Even when Wyatt tells her it is not appropriate to talk about him and Steffy at the office Nicole keeps going back to it. Eric is direct with Steffy. He asks what would she think if she knew someone well that was shacking up when they were a married person. She stammers to find words but he finishes the sentence by saying she would think it was shameful. He says he did not bring it up before only because the whole family was estranged against him. She wonders if this is coming from him or from Quinn. He says he is saying this to her now from him. He would like to see her have a second chance but it is not right to be living with Liam. It is unfair now of Liam to be coming around and throwing these choices around. It is not too late. He wants her to move out of Liam's tonight. It is never too late to realign your choices with what is proper and right. Quinn walks in as Liam and Ridge are putting their heads together in how to oust Quinn.

Ridge is surprised she is back and she says his dad is the best doctor there is and she is all better. But maybe she should put a sock over her Ace bandage. Ridge quips that he can help her with that. He is pretty good helping a woman all the way down to her feet. He tries to start and she says no he's done enough and she did not mean to run Liam off. Liam says he is sure Ridge will fill him in later. Nicole has one more thing to say to Wyatt. When he thinks it is all over, perhaps it is just another chapter in his life. Eric says he believes in marriage and he even believes in divorce as he had had enough of his own, but he does not think it is right for Steffy to be married in limbo and go home to another man. Do not make a show of being with another man while she is married to another .move out tonight. He tells her he realizes she is not drawing a paycheck and that is not right. He is offering her $1M a year and that is as it should be. If she does not fully appreciate herself then no one else will. Quinn keeps on at Ridge and asks if he cannot see how she has some redeeming qualities and is very good for his father. The next thing you know she is talking about Ridge's hair and he knows she is just dying to run her fingers through it. She remarks that there is not enough hand sanitizers in the building for that. Wyatt walks in and finds Eric alone who asks about his work. Then he tells him that he told Steffy that her living with Liam has to stop. At home Steffy has the place all fixed up, special dinner, music, candlelight and wine. He knows it is not his birthday so what is the occasion. He asks if he did something good and she says yes. He is loyal and loving and he never gave up on her. She needed that more than he will ever know. She knows she will have to be a better person to keep him. He asks if there is a surprise. She takes a deep breath.",
