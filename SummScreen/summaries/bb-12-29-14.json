    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Maya's place, Maya was worried about what Rick and Caroline had discussed but decided that she and Rick being together was all that mattered. Maya hugged Rick, and upon receiving an icy response, she concluded, \"But not for much longer.\"\n\n\nRick told Maya that everything was the same, but he was under tremendous pressure. He didn't know how long he could keep it up. Maya urged him to stick to the plan. He wanted to, but he said that Caroline was talking about having a family.\n\n\nAstonished by what she'd heard, Maya asked if Rick had slept with Caroline. Rick denied it, and Maya asked if he wanted to. Rick stated that he wanted to get control of the business before he and Maya were found out. Maya guessed that he was worried about Ivy talking.\n\n\nRick figured that once the silence damming Ivy's mouth broke, all hell would break loose. He was sure he'd lose his position and wouldn't ever be president again. He decided to go to Forrester and get his father's signature on the papers right away. Maya kissed him and wished him luck.\n\n\nAt Forrester with Ridge, Eric discussed a lecture series Eric planned to do at design schools. John would join Eric on the trip to hunt out more adventures for them. Eric felt that Rick was in a better place, so it was a good time for Eric to leave. Ridge claimed that the problems were long behind everyone, and Eric said he was sorry for how things had gone with Ridge and Katie.\n\n\nCaroline stopped on the office threshold as Eric asked if there was still a chance for Ridge and Katie. Ridge said that there wasn't, and Caroline told the men that she could return later. Eric indicated that he was the one leaving because the designers had work to do.\n\n\nAfter Eric had gone, Caroline asked if the breakup had been because of her. Ridge replied that the relationship had simply run its course, but he was happy for Rick and Caroline. She asked if Ridge meant it. Ridge did and stopped himself short of saying he'd take action if Rick misbehaved.\n\n\nCaroline said Rick was busy with work and didn't want to disappoint Eric. Ridge said it was the quickest way to lose the job. He concluded that Rick was doing well at work and at home.\n\n\nRidge asked if she and Rick were planning to have kids. Caroline looked startled by the mention of it. Ridge hadn't wanted to put her on the spot, but he'd recalled that she wanted to start a family. He believed that the beautiful, talented Caroline would be a good mother.\n\n\nLater, Caroline was designing alone in Rick's old office when Maya arrived. Caroline tersely asked what Maya wanted, and Maya claimed to have heard that big things were happening at work. Without glancing up, Caroline asked how Maya knew that. Maya responded that being discarded by Rick didn't mean that what happened at Forrester didn't happen to her, too. Caroline declared that nothing big was happening at Forrester, or Rick would have told her.\n\n\nMaya smiled and walked over to the desk. Caroline asked what else Maya wanted. Maya said that she wasn't with Rick, but she was still happy that he was CEO. Though Rick wasn't wowing people on the runway like Ridge, Rick knew exactly what he was doing.\n\n\nOutside the CEO's office, Rick recalled Eric threatening to fire Rick if Rick didn't reconcile with Caroline. Rick entered the office and engaged in a talk with Eric about Eric's upcoming trip. Rick thought it was a great time for Eric to go away -- unless Eric was worried about how Rick would handle things in Eric's stead. Eric expressed that he and everyone had confidence in Rick's leadership skills.\n\n\n\"Everyone except for Ridge,\" Rick stated. Eric asked if Ridge was being supportive. Rick said it was what Ridge wanted everyone to believe, but Ridge was biding his time. Rick believed that Ridge would wait for Eric to leave before undermining Rick. Eric disagreed, but Rick was certain that Ridge would turn the place into chaos.\n\n\nRick also believed that Ridge would fill Eric's head with garbage upon Eric's return. Eric objected, and Rick said he knew that Eric didn't play favorites and believed in the brothers equally. Eric said it was true, and Rick asked Eric to prove it. Pulling out his contract, Rick said it was his security, and he asked Eric to make it so that Rick could choose when he'd step down as CEO. Rick urged Eric to sign the papers and show Rick that Eric cared about the brothers equally.\n\n\nAt the loft, Deacon and Quinn urged Wyatt to be with Hope in Italy. Wyatt replied that each time Hope saw him, she saw what his mother had done. It was paramount to Deacon that Wyatt help Hope heal, and Quinn said Wyatt needed to do it before Liam beat Wyatt to it. Deacon chastised her for the statement, but she stated that she didn't want Liam to get there first.\n\n\nWyatt agreed with the idea that he and Hope needed to heal, but heading for the door, he asserted that there was something he had to do first.\n\n\nSometime after Wyatt had left, Quinn whipped out her phone. Deacon asked her not to call Wyatt and to be okay with him finally speaking to her again. Quinn was concerned that she could lose Wyatt for good if he lost Hope. \"If my daughter and your son are meant to be -- \" Deacon said.\n\n\nQuinn cut Deacon off to insist that the couple was meant to be, and losing the child didn't change it. She wanted the couple to recover from the loss and eventually have another child. Quinn put down the phone, and Deacon said he was proud of her for giving her son advice and then stepping back. He joked that she might become the most reformed mother of the year.\n\n\nAt the cliff house, Ivy filled Liam in on her confrontation with Rick about kissing Maya. Ivy sensed that it was more about lashing out at Caroline than true feelings for Maya, but when Ivy had confronted Maya, it had been apparent that Maya wouldn't back down.\n\n\nLiam stated that his cousin had no idea of what was happening behind her back. Ivy explained that Rick was severely bitter that the indiscretion had been with Ridge, and Caroline would already have Rick's forgiveness if it had been any other man.\n\n\nLiam understood Rick's pain, but he didn't like that Rick was playing vengeance games with Caroline. Ivy could see that it was taking tremendous restraint for Liam to stop himself from going to Caroline, but Ivy said that she could lose her job if Rick found out she'd told Liam. Liam seriously doubted it, and Ivy asked him to think of how devastated Caroline would be. Ivy hoped Rick would ultimately do the right thing, and if he did, they could spare Caroline the pain of knowing about the kiss.\n\n\nIvy believed in the power of people to turn stupid choices around and fix them for the people that they hurt. Liam said she understood what love and forgiveness were about. Liam pulled her in for a kiss, but Wyatt entered the house and announced that he needed to talk to Liam about Hope.\n\n\nIvy took off, and Wyatt asked if Liam had heard from Hope. Liam hadn't and asked what the issue was. Wyatt said he felt that, with each day, he and Hope were drifting further apart, and he couldn't let it happen. Wyatt announced that he was going to Italy immediately.\n\n\nLiam began to speak, but in a tidal wave of words, Wyatt said he'd made up his mind. Wyatt felt that he and Hope couldn't rebound from the miscarriage while apart. He believed that they needed to say things to each other and heal, and he refused to let it be the end of his marriage.\n\n\nLiam said he knew what it was like to lose a child, and Wyatt and Hope had Liam's support for whatever they needed to do to heal. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Maya is not happy to hear that Rick talked to Caroline. Then she says she does not want to know but she hopes it won't be much longer. Eric tells Ridge that he thinks this is a pretty good time for him to be gone since Rick is settling in on the CEO job and back with Caroline. He's going to go globetrotting with his brother John. Ivy confides in Liam that she saw Rick kissing Maya but he lied and said it was a goodbye kiss and to forget what she saw. But she confronted Maya and she did not back down. She went on and on how they were going to run the company. Quinn repeats to Wyatt that he needs to go see Hope and they need to grieve together. Deacon agrees and says he needs to do all he can to help Hope heal and himself as well, so go to her. And Quinn does not want Liam to get to her before Wyatt does. Wyatt says he will think about it but first he has something else he needs to do. Rick confesses to Maya that nothing has changed. He is still waiting for his dad to sign those papers but he doesn't know how much longer he can keep all of this up. Liam asks Ivy if there is any way they could be wrong about this. Caroline does not deserve this by Rick playing her. Ivy says he needs also to think how devastated Caroline will be if she knows. Caroline pretends to Ridge that all is good with her marriage. It's just that Rick is much busier now in his role of CEO. Ridge says he is glad she is happy. Maya tells Rick that she knows how hard it is for him to keep up the charade but he has to stick to the plan. Rick says Caroline senses something is off and now is asking that they start a family. As Liam kisses Ivy Wyatt waltzes in and says he needs to talk to Liam about Hope. Quinn tells Deacon that Hope and Wyatt are meant to be together. She is the love of his life. And Quinn too might lose Wyatt if he loses Hope so he needs to go and talk this out with her. Deacon tells her how proud he is of her, giving Wyatt advise and then stepping away. She might even get the reformed mother of the year award. Wyatt tells Liam that he has not heard from Hope, no phone calls, no e-mails but every day is getting harder. He can't let her go like this so he is going to Italy right now. Liam tries to talk him out of it but Wyatt says no, he needs to say some things to her and let them both heal. He won't let this be the end of his marriage. Liam says he knows they have been at each other's throats but he has been there with losing a child too, so he has his support. He will have his support, both he and Hope. Ridge asks Caroline if she is still wanting to have kids as she has told him before. He thinks she will make a terrific mother. Maya comes in sniffing around to see if Caroline knows any Forrester news. She misses Rick a lot but she is happy he is CEO now. Rick talks to his dad and is happy to hear about Eric's plans to go snowboarding or just holding that cup of hot toddy and a snow bunny. Rick says he is sure Ridge is just biding his time and he will soon sabotage his decisions as if Rick is over his head. If his dad believes in him as much as he says he does, then prove it. He shows him the papers again and asks his dad to care about him as much as he does Ridge .and please sign the papers.",
