Rick wanted Eric to sign them before Eric left for a vacation with John. Eric balked, but Rick said he needed the vote of confidence from his father.\n\n\nRick reminded Eric that Eric had originally chosen Ridge over Rick many times before -- most recently as CEO. Eric apologized, but Rick worried that Ridge would undermine his leadership at every opportunity in Eric's absence.\n\n\nEric stated that the CEO position had never been a dictatorship. Rick maintained that he could feel Ridge breathing down his neck. Rick predicted that Ridge would find fault in everything he did. He knew that Ridge would exaggerate every error. \"It happened in the past, and it will happen again,\" Rick said. He said that he'd been forced to live in Ridge's shadow his entire life.\n\n\nRick pressured Eric to trust him. \"I have big plans for this company,\" Rick declared. He added that he and Caroline had been functioning as a team. \"So for me, sign the papers,\" Rick commanded. Rick added that Eric needed to revisit Ridge's history -- he had pushed Eric out once before, and he had pushed Thorne into the basement. Rick vowed that would not happen to him.\n\n\nEric took the papers and paused. Eric promised to think about it, but he vowed that he would never sign the company over to anyone in perpetuity. He might agree to one year, \"and that would be non-negotiable. What you're asking is unprecedented,\" Eric bellowed. \"Dad I need this,\" Rick replied.\n\n\nOn the rooftop lounge, Carter worked out, and Ridge entered to meet with him. Carter had been surprised that Rick had agreed to allow Caroline and Ridge to team up again. Carter suggested that Ridge was single again, and should enjoy it.\n\n\nCarter wondered if Ridge had been pining away for Katie -- or if it was Caroline he wanted. Ridge was evasive. He said he felt like a struggling artist and had been sleeping at Forrester. He recalled that he and Katie had been on a fast track to get married. \"I'm not sure what happened. I guess I wasn't paying attention,\" Ridge confessed.\n\n\nIn another office at Forrester, Maya and Caroline argued. Caroline encouraged Maya to get a life because she had been rejected and humiliated after Rick had broken up with her. Her gold-digging schemes had blown up in her face.\n\n\nMaya replied that she had an insatiable thirst and an eye on the bigger prize. Maya stated that she had a permanent position at Forrester, but Caroline laughed that Eric had saved Maya's position because Rick had intended to fire her. \"I'll take my chances,\" Maya spat back.\n\n\nMaya encouraged Caroline to return to New York, but Caroline sneered at Maya, who said they were cosmically connected. \"Why don't we just stay out of each other's way,\" Caroline suggested.\n\n\nMaya reminded Caroline that her liplock with Ridge was what had sent Rick into Maya's arms. Maya noted that Ridge and Caroline were once again working behind closed doors, \"furiously fighting that wild, crazy attraction,\" Maya said. Maya suggested that Caroline stop fighting her attraction to Ridge. Maya left, and Caroline rolled her eyes.\n\n\nLater Caroline continued to work on a design, and Ridge entered. He wondered why she was working so late. She replied that she wanted to finish the design so she wouldn't have work on her mind when she arrived at home. She wanted to concentrate on her husband.\n\n\nRidge made some suggestions for the design and gently guided Caroline's pencil as she revised the design. She stopped and told him they couldn't do that. Ridge understood. Caroline took a deep breath. Ridge said he'd never meant to hurt her and he was glad that she'd worked things out with Rick. \n\n\nCaroline confided that she wanted to have a baby, but Rick had been distant and they had not been intimate. Caroline wondered if Rick's loving actions at work were all an act. She worried that she had lost him, and she wanted to hold her husband again.\n\n\nAt home, Eric welcomed Carter into the house and asked Carter to review some papers that Rick had drawn up. Carter said that it was clear Rick wanted to run the company and could run it into the ground if Eric signed the papers. \"And no one could stop him,\" Carter noted. Ridge defended Rick and said that he didn't think the request was outlandish. Eric admitted he would consider a year.\n\n\nAt Maya's, Maya greeted Rick and wondered if he had good news. Rick noted that his father had not signed the papers, but he was close to striking a deal for one year. Rick said that was plenty of time for them to build the company and be accepted as a couple. Later, Maya and Rick got into the bathtub, and they made out among the bubbles. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Feeling the pressure of the ticking clock, Rick pleads his case to Eric requesting that he sign the legal documents that would seal the deal of his Forrester Creations\u2019 take-over. Knowing that the tables may soon turn, Maya holds her tongue during a venomous confrontation with Caroline. Ridge has a candid conversation with Carter about his feelings for Caroline and what he plans to do about it. Caroline makes a confession to Ridge about intimate details of her marriage.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rick hands Eric the papers and says he NEEDS this confidence. Rick says he knows he is not going to be here and Ridge will undermine his position. Eric will try to rule him long distance but Ridge will always question his ability. He has in the past and he will again. It's always been a fact of his life living in Ridge's shadow and he always comes up short. His track record is impeccable and he and Caroline are working as a team, so for Eric just sign the papers. Maya walks in on Caroline and she asks her why she is always here. Maya says she knows Rick broke up with her but she still works here. Caroline says now she is just a sad cliche golddigger. She says the only reason Maya is still here is because of Eric. Next time she may not be so lucky. Maya says she will take her chances. Carter muses with Ridge that he is surprised that he and Caroline are back working together because Eric asked. But Caroline is back with Rick and Ridge lost Katie. Ridge says he is lucky to have this designing collaboration on his side. He distracted himself right out of a great relationship with Katie when he wasn't looking. Carter gets him to open up about Caroline. Maya says it looks like Caroline is stuck with her unless she goes back to New York. Caroline says they will just have to stay out of each other's way. Rick has forgiven her so Maya can take her insatiable thirst and move onward somewhere else. Maya counters with to get real with Ridge as she knows that is where her true feelings are. Eric says he does not remember it that way. Rick starts to rattle off the ways Ridge has done it in the past going behind each other's backs. Rick says he can not do his best work always looking over his shoulder for Ridge. If Eric believes in him then put it in writing like any other business deal. Eric says maybe he can cancel the trip for a while until the transition goes over smoothly. He says what Rick is asking is unprecedented and at best it could only be for a year. Rick still holds the papers and asks again to do this for him. Eric calls Carter to his house and bends his ear about favoring Ridge over Rick. He shows him the papers and says if that is Rick's perception it is not his intention. But Rick now wants him to sign these papers. Rick goes to Maya and gives her the bad news that Eric did not sign the papers but he feels it is only a matter of time. He kisses her and she says a good start but would he like to finish it in the tub. He says she read his mind. Caroline tries to finish up and tells Ridge she would like to so she can go home and have nothing but her husband on her mind. He makes a few suggestions. She recoils and he says he never meant to hurt her or jeopardize what she has with her husband. He is glad they worked it out. He's even happy that she is thinking about having a baby. But for that to happen she says certain things must happen. Carter is shocked that Rick is pushing for this, irrevocable control. He could even run the company into the ground if he wanted to. Eric says it would only be for one year and he thinks he has earned that right. Rick and Maya relax in their bubbles and he says his dad never makes sudden changes but he will come around when the time comes. Maya will get everything she wants. Ridge asks Caroline if she means this whole time she and Rick have not been intimate. She says yes. Despite all Rick's lovey-dovey, touchy feely actions at the office, at home it seems like an act. She would like to hold her husband again but he's just not there.",
