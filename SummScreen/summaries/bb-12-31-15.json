    "tvmega_recap": "Steffy overhears Ivy says that she is too in love with Liam to stay here; she is going home. Sadly Wyatt tells a thrilled Caroline that Ivy actually turned him down as she preferred a ring from Liam instead. Eric tells Katie that he is not sure he will like the company without Brooke, but this is very generous of Katie and he is impressed. This may be exactly what Brooke needs. Katie says she does not need to feel isolated again. Katie wants to get her house in order and it starts with this. Brooke laments that Bill is married to her sister and they have a child and that is exactly what she wanted for them, so leave and go to her. Caroline can not believe this is happening. Wyatt says they had to force it out of Ivy but she was planning on saying yes and settling. Maybe 20 or 30 years from now he can laugh about it. Liam tells Ivy to give it some time, do not do anything rash. Two weeks from now she will not feel this way. She says she has to; she is too in love with him. He hugs her and says okay, he will miss her. Steffy walks in and says good riddance, she heard. She thinks Liam was leading Ivy on and sending mixed signals, trying to come up with a Plan B. Telling Ivy how he feels only feeding her feelings when she just screwed over his brother. Bill tells Brooke that he had no idea she had these feelings still for him. She said she had put that behind him but she never forgot it. She has to force herself to forget but it is not easy, and he has to forget too. He says he will because he is married to her sister. Katie suddenly walks in and sees Brooke crying and wants to know why. She does not want her to feel pressured to take this job nor does she have to say so now. Katie proceeds and says Liam is not spending that much time at SP and they could use a new Editor and Brooke would be perfect. Brooke reconsiders and says yes and they hug. Ivy explains to Eric why she is having to leave .all because Steffy came back from Paris and interrupted all their lives, Liam, Wyatt and Aly. Steffy and Liam argue about Ivy. He thinks he should have spoken up sooner and Steffy says Ivy never really cared for Wyatt. She can not understand why he is being so nice to her. He says he knows she made mistakes but he does not think it wrong of him to tell her that he still cares so just let her leave the country peacefully. Steffy grumbles that she would be happy to help her pack. Liam tells her under no circumstances is she to go near her. Steffy heads straight to the Forrester manse. Eric tells Steffy that Ivy is upstairs packing. He can stay and referee. Steffy declines but says she just wanted to be sure Ivy was leaving. Eric leaves and Steffy goes up the stairs only to see Ivy on the top one heading down. They exchange words with Ivy reminding Steffy that she came home and targeted Liam who was with Ivy then. Steffy tells Ivy to leave and not come home. Do not call or text Liam, he is not interested. In leaving Ivy trips all by herself and falls down the stairs. Scared, Steffy screams Ivy's name as Liam comes barreling in the door only to see Ivy at the bottom of the stairs motionless and Steffy cringing at the top and calling out his name. He looks furious.",
