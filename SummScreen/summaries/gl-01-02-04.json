    "tvmega_recap": "Ed sees Marah, Michelle and Marina talking at the hospital -- and already frazzled, believes they are conspiring to ask him more questions about Maryanne Caruthers. When he attempts to put them off, he realizes their questions were just about Shayne. Later, he nearly gives Shayne the wrong medicine, and for Ed, it's the last straw. He goes to Company and tells Buzz, Billy and Josh he can't keep the secret any longer. Billy brings Alan into it but no one can talk sense into Ed, who tries to leave. It promises to get violent, quickly, when Ed charges out the door and Billy roughly pulls him back, insisting what they know stays in the room. But they're unaware that Michelle has \"had it\" as well, having witnessed Ed's medical blunder and knowing it's somehow tied to the stress he's feeling -- stress she now fears she put him under by bringing up Maryanne to begin with. She returns to the museum and angrily summons Carrie, demanding the whole story. Carrie is happy to oblige. Harley visits Phillip, and against her better judgment, questions him about things at Spaulding. Getting nothing, she assures him all his friends want him better, soon -- and leaves. She reports in to Jeffrey, who is aware of her visit and asks if she got anything. When Harley rails against the way this job is setting her up against the people she loves, Jeffrey is affected. After Harley goes, he picks up a message Marah had left for him, and he silently and sadly deletes it."
