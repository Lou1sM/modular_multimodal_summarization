Jeffrey says he and Shayne \"connect.\"  He had everything and suddenly it was taken away.  It's a reminder of how quickly things can change.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Reva refuses a nurse's suggestion that she go home and get some rest - not until Shayne can come with her.  When O'Neill arrives, Reva tells him the doctors are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to Shayne's recovery.  When Jeffrey comments on doctor's cautious attitudes, Reva suspiciously questions the lawyer on his view of \"caution.\"  Jeffrey vividly remembers his night with Marah and says, \"I've been known to bend a few rules.\"  Reva is appreciative of O'Neill's help with the acupuncturist and suggests a woman is the cause of his sudden \"heart.\"  Jeffrey looks uncomfortable and denies that his kindness of late means he is softening as a human being.  Reva mentions how nice it was of him to look over Marah's fashion contracts.  He thinks Reva's daughter is talented, yet naive which would make her easily taken advantage of.  Reva doesn't want that either.  Jeffrey retrieves the contracts from his briefcase (they sent him Marah's copies by mistake) and asks Reva to deliver them for him.  When she spots a rusty license plate in his briefcase, he places it in her hands.  Reva accuses him of pretending to be interested in her son's recovery in order to get her psychic input on a case.  He reassures her that he is genuinely concerned about Shayne but also hopes she can help him in some way.  Reva insists she doesn't read inanimate objects, she reads people. However she feels the plate is related to someone who was killed.  Jeffrey doesn't know.  Reva agrees to try. \n\n\nReva sits in the lobby, hands pressed against the license plate, eyes closed.  She sees a black and white vision of a man, arms flailing in the water.  She opens her eyes as Jeffrey asks what she saw.  She saw Shayne drowning but doesn't understand why.  Jeffrey tells her that the plate was found on a car pulled out of the river.  If it happened 25 years ago, then it wasn't Shayne, \"But who was it?,\" Reva asks.  Jeffrey is sorry he laid this on Reva.  She's going through enough.  He leaves without the plate.  When Reva picks it up, she sees another vision - the man in the water, now unconscious, is Josh.\n\n\nAt the museum, the girls press Carrie for more pieces to the puzzle.  They are worried about Josh, Buzz and Ed and demand to know who Maryanne Caruthers was and how she died.  They can't understand why there is no evidence, no record of Maryanne's death.  Carrie says the proof is in the reactions of their fathers/grandfather.  Michelle accuses Carrie of playing games with them.  Carrie reminds them that a woman is dead - it is no game.  She is afraid they are unprepared for the truth but gives them the rings and promises that after they hear the details of Maryanne's death, they'll be wary of what they wished for.  She begins her story with \"Oct. 17, 1977, the County Harvest Fair...\"  Alan Spaulding always played by his own rules - \"when he saw something, he just took it.\"  Then there was Josh, who couldn't even think of looking at a woman who wasn't Reva Shayne, but his \"big, bad brother\" Billy had a way of getting him into trouble.  Buzz, home on leave, unbeknownst to even his family, was \"no stranger to trouble.\"  Ed was one of Springfield's upstanding young doctors, even though he was well on his way to a serious drinking problem...  \n\n\nAt Company, an angry Ed insists that their secret must end.  A screaming match and  scuffle result in Buzz on the floor due to Billy's right hook that was intended for Ed's jaw.  Billy apologizes as Alan tries to calm everyone.  Buzz accuses him of pretending not to feel anything.  Ed blames Alan as the cause for their current situation.  Buzz starts to agree with Ed, but Alan reminds them of the alternative - once their loved ones learn the truth, they won't understand.  He suggests they keep things quiet just like they've been doing.  Buzz asks Alan if it was by mere coincidence that they all ended up at the Harvest fair.  Or did Alan purposefully reel them into his plan?  \n\n\nBlack and white flashback to 25 years ago - the much younger five at the fair.  Alan tells them all to be patient.  Being there makes Josh miss home (and Reva).  The young men had several pitchers of beer when Alan proposed a toast to a girl across the room - Maryanne Caruthers.  (She was wealthy, beautiful... and wanted nothing to do with Alan).  Alan insists that she's not his type - she's older and when she drinks, she makes a spectacle.  He offers them a show.  He holds up a vial (the drug Spaulding Pharmaceuticals made from ancient Egyptian white powder).  Buzz, Josh and Ed are skeptical - they want no part of it, so they leave.  Alan persuades Billy to talk to Maryanne, and invite her over for a beer.  Alan empties the vial into a pitcher just as Billy and Maryanne return.  He pours her a drink. After several, Maryanne leaves with her new friends...\n\n\nAt this point in the story, Marina, Marah and Michelle wish they hadn't heard what Carrie just told them.  But, they all agree that the ending needs to be told, so Carrie continues...\n\n\nBack at Company, they all take the blame for what happened that night.  They knew what was going to happen, but no one stopped it.  Ed angrily tells Alan that his \"harmless\" drug was approved by the FDA as an anesthetic, not a \"date drug.\"  Billy reminds Alan that he promised it would only be in Maryanne's drink, even though he put it in the pitcher so they were all affected by it.  Josh accuses his brother of knowing beforehand what Alan was planning to do.  Billy defends himself by saying he only agree to help Alan get Maryanne high, watch her make a scene and send her home with a headache.  Josh asks how Billy sleeps at night.  He is quick to remind his little brother that he saved his life that night.  Alan points out that Maryanne loved all the attention she was given and knew their intentions.  Josh denies his interest, but Ed says none of them were thinking clearly that night.\n\n\nFlashback again:  Alan presses the accelerator as he drives Maryanne and the four laughing, drinking men.  It is dark and rainy and Maryanne asks Alan to slow down.  When he doesn't, she asks to be taken home just before passing out.  Concerned, the others ask him to pull over saying Maryanne needs a doctor.  Alan speeds up near Cutter's Bridge.\n\n\nAll five men have differing views on what caused Alan to lose control of the car (a blown tire, a tree branch in the road, Maryanne may have grabbed the wheel).  No one knows what sent the car speeding off the bridge and into the water below.\n\n\nBuzz was able to open the passenger door and swim to the surface.  His military training taught him to \"leave no one behind,\" so he dove down and pulled Ed to safety.  Billy did the same for Josh.  Alan joins them onshore saying the current had carried the car downstream and deeper under water.  Buzz and Billy try anyway to look for Maryanne but it was hopeless.  \"It was like she just disappeared.\"  \n\n\nAt Company, Josh apologizes to Billy and thanks him for saving his life.  Alan wants them to keep quiet.  None of them understand who, if Maryanne has no family, is putting ideas in Michelle, Marina and Marah's heads.  Someone knows something.  Alan suggests they keep an eye on those three to find out who they are talking to.\n\n\nAt the museum, Carrie asks for the rings back but the girls are reluctant.  Marah asks how Carrie knows so much about what happened if Buzz, Ed, Josh, Billy and Alan were the only ones there.  Carrie explains that she was there that night and witnessed the accident from the riverbank, too scared to do anything.  She heard the five men agree on their story (Alan told police his car was stolen) and promise not to tell a soul.  \"We never knew anyone named Maryanne Caruthers.\"\n\n\nAt Company, the men agree to stay silent, placing their hands on top of one another, just like they did 25 years ago, they promise \"Till death do us part.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While Reva keeps vigil at the hospital, Jeffrey pays a visit. She is struck by his repeated kindness to her and her family and wonders if someone new in his life has made a difference. Jeffrey sidesteps any question that would lead to Marah and instead asks Reva to look at the license plate that came off the car they found at the river. Without knowing it belonged to Alan or even that it had been submerged, Reva surprises herself by \"reading\" the tag -- and seeing someone drowning. At first, she believes it's Shayne and fears for his recovery; but once she's reassured her son is all right, Reva sees the true face of the drowning man. The face belongs to Josh. Carrie gives Marah, Marina and Michelle her perspective on what happened to Maryanne Caruthers while Josh, Alan, Billy, Buzz and Ed are forced to look once more at the choices they made that fateful evening in 1977 when they met Maryanne at the county fair. Alan recalls slipping a drug into a pitcher of beer that he then distributes to Maryanne and the other guys. The men remember cramming into a car, drunk and reckless, only to crash into the river. Josh recalls his brush with death when Billy pulled his drowning brother from the river. But all the men recall that despite their searching, Maryanne never resurfaced. They made a pact on the riverbank to never speak of what had happened that night. By the end of the day, Josh, Alan, Billy, Buzz and Ed must reaffirm, once again, the solemn pact they made thirty years ago on a night they can, God help them, never forget.",
