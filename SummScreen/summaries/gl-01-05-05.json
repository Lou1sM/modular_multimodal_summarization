Reva enters and runs over, demanding to know what is wrong. Cassie attempts to explain she is afraid she cannot live up to Edmund's expectations. Cassie demands to know why Reva did not show the night before as promised. Reva explains that she was there, only did not want to interrupt when she saw the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. Reva reassures Cassie that everything will be fine, and neither Jonathan nor Dinah will attend the wedding. As Reva leaves the room to get Cassie a glass of wine, Jeffrey is standing at the back door watching. Reva returns to find the veil lying on the floor, and Cassie gone. \n\n\n",
