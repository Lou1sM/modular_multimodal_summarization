    "tvmega_recap": "Josh, Billy, Ed, Alan and Buzz have renewed their promise to keep quiet about the accident thirty years ago and their cover up of Maryanne Caruthers's death. As they separate, each man tries to get back to his life. Alan questions Gus about the investigation into his car they pulled from the river. Buzz begins to sweat when Frank explains that they still hope to find evidence in the sunken wreck. Josh and Ed appear on the verge of cracking. Ed is finding it harder to perform his duties as a doctor. Only Billy can stem Josh's urge to come clean with his family. Meanwhile, Michelle, Marah and Marina reel from Carrie's own retelling of the story. They don't want to believe their fathers capable of letting that young women die and then covering it up. They realize, though, that they have to confront the men. The three young women tell their fathers/grandfather/uncle what they've learned about Maryanne's death. The reactions of the men are very different. Buzz seems compassionate and understanding as he denies the story. Josh is silent, while Billy chastises Marah for her lack of trust. Michelle pushes Ed, digs at him with questions, and refuses to be rebuffed. Finally a desperate Ed slaps his daughter across the face. In the aftermath of the slap, he's shaken to the core, but still keeps his secret. The women hand over envelopes to Josh, Billy, Buzz and Ed. Alan finds one intended for him, too. The men read the notes from Carrie, and realize this is a long way from over.",
