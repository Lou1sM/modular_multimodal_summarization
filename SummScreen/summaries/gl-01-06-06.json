First, Mallet tells her the car that Gus was driving has finally turned on its GPS system and they're tracking its location as they speak. Secondly, Harley gets a call from the Medical Examiner, asking her to come in and see if she can identify a recently arrived body \u2013 as Gus. Harley, with Mallet in tow, heads for the morgue, but faints before going in. Mallet assures her she doesn't have to; he'll make the ID. However, at the last minute, Harley has to see for herself, and almost faints again, this time with relief, when she sees the body isn't Gus's. Afterwards, she and Mallet learn the location of Gus's car, it's apparent (to us) that it was driven off the road, with two still bodies lying inside it. Filling in for Harley at Spaulding, Alan-Michael is feeling on top of the world. Still, it doesn't help him feel any better about his brush-off of Marina on New Year's Eve, and he attempts to make amends with a bouquet of flowers and a vow to make her see that he is truly sorry for hurting her. Marina tries to play it off casually, but she is obviously charmed. Jonathan is forced to take an anger-management class as a condition of his bail, and he grudgingly attends, though it isn't long before his mind is filled with images of Tammy. Which are preferable to the ones of Sandy taunting that Jonathan will hurt the woman he loves the same way he's hurt everyone else in his life. Meanwhile, Sandy is telling Tammy that if she would only let him hold her again, she'd remember how great they were together, and take him back. Tammy resists and Sandy gets pushy \u2013 which is when Jonathan steps in and howls for Sandy to let go of Tammy, or he'll kill him!\n\n\n",

The episode ends on a cliffhanger, with two still bodies lying inside the car that was driven off the road with two bodies inside it.
