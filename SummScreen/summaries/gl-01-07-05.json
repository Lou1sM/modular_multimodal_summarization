When she gives it to him, she warns him that it could either kill him or cure him, he has to take his chances. He tells her he doesn't think so--he wants Danny to try it first. As Sebastian is holding a gun on Danny, demanding that he test the medicine, Holly tires to reason with Sebastian but to no avail Finally, Danny agrees to do it on one condition--Sebastian lets the women go. Although Sebastian agrees, Michelle refuses and downs the potion herself. She then promptly passes out. Holly then gets angry and slaps Sebastian for what's happened, but he gets defensive by saying that it's not his fault that Michelle drank it. Holly says it is his fault since they're all in this because of him. She then starts to berate him for unsettling her life. Holly tells him that she had a good life in Springfield; she'd finally put all the pain and drama behind her. She calls him a hypocrite since he keeps torturing her and then telling her how much he cares. Sebastian thinks Holly's the hypocrite thought since he doesn't think she can fathom returning to her life in Springfield. \n\n\nMeanwhile, after a few minutes, Danny is able to revive Michelle. She's groggy but alright. When Sebastian keeps asking for the medicine, a frustrated Danny gives it to him and then concentrates on his wife. Michelle tells Danny that while she was out, she had images of him. She tells him about a dream of them in a balloon, drinking champagne. Danny informs her that wasn't a dream--it was a memory. He asks if that's the first she's had of him and she shakes her head no. Just then, Tony bursts in to save Michelle. \n\n\nAt the Jessup farm, Josh is manhandling Jonathan, demanding to know what he did. Jonathan plays innocent stating that he's just having an innocent conversation with his mother, but Josh gets even angrier. Reva, watching the entire thing, breaks them up and walks away angry at Josh. Jonathan then goes inside the house where he instigates Sandy by making disparaging remarks about Cassie in front of Tammy. Jonathan just keeps egging Sandy on until Sandy's ready to punch him. Sandy then offers to take Tammy home, but Tammy asks for a word alone with Jonathan. Tammy tells Jonathan how pathetic he is, gloating about her mother. Jonathan thinks everyone should be happy that Cassie didn't marry \"Uncle Eddie\" and wonders what his father would think. Tammy tells him that he never knew his father and he asks whose fault is that. Tammy tries to explain that Edmund but changed, but Jonathan doesn't think just falling in love could do that to a person. After telling him that some things can't be changed, Tammy walks off. \n\n\nOutside, Cassie asks Edmund if he still wants to marry her. He tells her yes. Cassie tells him that there is something he needs to know, but he stops her and tells her she doesn't need to tell him anything. Cassie tells Edmund that she desperately wants to marry him today. Jeffrey, overhearing everything, offers to perform the ceremony. Cassie is shocked that he'd want to, considering their histories, but he tells her that's in the past. When he goes off to find a bible, Cassie apologizes for almost ruining the wedding. She starts to explain again what happened, but again Edmund won't let her tell him. He tells Cassie what's important is that she's here at all. Jeffrey then comes out with the bible (RJ's pop-up bible) to start the ceremony. He asks for rings and Edmund improvises by using garden hose stoppers. Jeffrey starts out by stating how everyone talks about love, honor, and cherishing in a marriage; though he feels forgiveness is important also. Just then Reva (who overheard Edmund and Cassie talking earlier) leads the rest of the guests to the couple. The couple then exchange impromptu vows. Edmund starts and thanks Cassie for saving him, for giving him his humanity and his life. He tells her that when she ran off, he wasn't really surprised; a small part of him was always waiting for her to leave him. He thanks her for coming back. Cassie apologizes for leaving because she wanted to be the one person who never let him down. She tells him that she never felt safe growing up, but he wraps his love around her, she feels safe. She wants to spend the rest of her life making him happy. After they exchange \"rings\", Jeffrey pronounces them husband and wife and the guests cheer. \n\n\nA little later, Reva and Josh discuss what Jeffrey was talking about earlier-- forgiveness. Reva tells Josh that she forgives him and wonders if he could extend that courtesy to Jonathan. Josh doesn't seem to willing to do that. He and RJ then give the bride and groom their actual wedding rings and Reva invites everyone to Towers for the reception. Before they leave, Cassie thanks Jeffrey and gives him a nice hug. He tells her that he meant what he said about forgiveness. \n\n\nUnbeknownst to everyone, Gus and Harley (just out on bail) were at the wedding but snuck out. Gus tells Harley he feels badly about that, but Harley states that it was the right think. If everyone knew she was out of jail, it would draw attention to her and take away from the bride. She starts talking about how a bride's day should never be ruined and Gus wonders if she isn't thinking of their own aborted wedding. Harley admits that she is a little. She acknowledges that he did hurt her, but admits that she's not any better since she may have killed her son's father. Gus tries to reassure Harley that she could very well be innocent. He then looks her in the eye and assures her that he's always been there for her and he will always be there for her. Touched, Harley kisses Gus. Gus then announces that he's going to be her lawyer, since he won't put her life into anyone else's hands. He then states that in order to prevent the prosecution from getting any ammunition against her, they need to keep their relationship strictly professional--- lawyer to client. Meanwhile, someone is watching them from the outside window. \n\n\nAt Towers, Reva makes a toast to the happy couple and happiness, a thing she says is so simple, yet difficult to find. She then admits, to a shocked Edmund, that he and Cassie are good together. When she's done, Sandy compliments her on her speech. He then thanks her for not pushing him away. He doesn't know what he did to deserve it, but she gave him a second chance and he's grateful. After she hugs him, Reva tells Sandy that she wants Tammy to go on with her life and tells him to take care of her. Looking at Tammy from across the room, Sandy says absolutely. \n\n\nAfter Cassie and Edmund secretly sneak out of Towers to share a private dance, Josh spots Jonathan entering Towers and demands to know what he's doing there. Josh then grabs Jonathan and starts shoving him up to the roof saying that he won't allow him to ruin anyone's good time. As Josh keeps shoving Jonathan up the steps, the pair argues, with Josh telling Jonathan that he wants him gone. During the argument, Jonathan, alone, sees Tammy entering the stairwell and starts arguing more with Josh then trying to walk past him down the steps. Josh then grabs him and turns him around. Jonathan, who's been holding on to Josh, suddenly lets go. Jonathan then falls down the steps and lands at a horrified Tammy's feet. \n\n\n\n\n",
