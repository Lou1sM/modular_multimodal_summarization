    "tvmega_recap": "Edmund forces Cassie to look backwards in time, to the night of the accident when she lost her baby. At first resistant to the memories flooding upon her, Cassie grows more emotional remembering against her will details of the frightening night she drove the car off the road. Edmund makes clear to her that he never meant to harm her. Cassie, to his growing horror, starts to blame herself, realizing that her own reckless driving and defiant attitude during a high-risk pregnancy were contributing causes. She asks his forgiveness for having been so sanctimonious in scapegoating him and Edmund freely gives it. After the talk they are more at peace, but Cassie asks Edmund if he was at the hospital the night the baby miscarried? He wonders why she's asking but she hides the hidden thought with \"no reason.\" Reva shows up at Josh's hotel room with a comfort basket of videos and movie snack food. Josh is surprised to see her and, out of loyalty to his men friends, resists her company. But she charms her way past his many defenses and is cuddling in his arms when she shares with him the vision she had recently of his drowning. Josh now remembers his need to keep her at a distance, and resists her attempted seduction. Reva exits with dignity, but it is only when alone in the hall do we see how devastated she is by this turn of events. Rick notices Michelle's bruise. She at first gives him a cover story, only telling him the truth when he wonders if Danny did this to her. Michelle tells him finally that it was Ed, and they share their mutual anxiety over his condition. Michelle tells him of the medical error concerning Shayne. Rick promises not to tell Danny and to keep an eye on Ed. Ed meanwhile freezes in the ER when confronted with a half-drowned woman who reminds him of Maryanne. Rick handles the medical crisis but strongly warns Ed he will not enable him in whatever's wrong. Ed denies he's drinking and freely offers to take a blood test. However, Rick is more worried about his dad than ever. Michelle meanwhile has sought the comfort of Danny's presence in Company, where he had watched Ross announce his bid for mayor. Bill and Danny discuss the upcoming fight. Neither Bill nor Danny will back down, and they agree to work on accomplishing great things together. When Michelle enters, she lies about the bruise. She voices to Danny her appreciation for the true security and love he's offered her. They go home, very much a team and in love.",
