    "tvmega_recap": "Shayne is going home from the hospital and Reva and Josh are determined to be encouraging and optimistic. But Shayne has become a fatalist about his recovery. He must be willing to accept the possibility that he'll never walk again, and he needs his parents to accept that, too. But even as Shayne prepares himself for disappointment, Marina is anxious to be with him when he walks -- yes, walks out of the hospital. Nico is a true friend, offering to overcome his aversion to hospitals to be with her today. But Marina's concern isn't limited to Shayne -- the story of Maryanne Caruthers has estranged her from Buzz and Marina fears the gap will only grow wider. Little does Marina know that Buzz is planning to leave town. Believing it's best for everyone, especially Marina, that he go far away and take his guilt and shame with him. Meanwhile, Harley is preparing to go out on the town with Brad Green -- as part of her undercover work for Jeffrey. Her plans are temporarily stopped when Gus assumes her sexy dress and high heels are meant for him. But Harley is able to make a getaway, and keeps her appointment with Brad. While she is flirting and fishing for information, Gus stops by Company -- only to sense that something is terribly wrong with Buzz. Gus sets out to find Harley to tell her about her dad -- not realizing he's about to find her with Brad. Jeffrey makes a point of tracking down Marah to tell her he knows she's upset that they were together the night Shayne went into the hospital. Sensitive to the kind of person she is, Jeffrey eventually gets her to admit she's been beating herself up for not being there for her brother. It isn't merely Jeffrey's words but the realization that he really does care that enables Marah to go off to join her family for Shayne's first step.",
