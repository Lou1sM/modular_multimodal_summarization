But Rick and Mel are having another argument about Beth, and Rick leaves in anger.  Marina tells Rick she must talk to him, but he declines and walks off.  Confused, Marina talks to Mel about Danny and Mel decides to go look for Rick and tell him the bad news in person.\n\n\nIn the airport near Sebastian's private island, Danny and Michelle -- who are very much alive -- talk about their relationship while they wait for Holly to join them.  Although Michelle remembers bits and pieces of their lives together, she does not remember her love for him and Danny admits to her that he knows he lost his wife a year ago in the explosion.  She tells him she is sorry for his loss and they embrace.  Tony, seeing this, assumes that the embrace means that the two are back together and he tries to leave gracefully so she can be with the one she loves.  Tony is thrilled when Michelle tells him \"I am with the man I love.\"  Meanwhile, it doesn't look like Holly will be joining the group any time soon.  It seems that Sebastian has stowed away on her airplane and he tries his best to convince her that her life is meaningless in Springfield and that she needs to go out into the world with him.  Hoping to persuade her to go with him, he opens the cabin door and threatens to jump if she will not join him.  \"I love you, we were meant to be together.\"  He kisses her and tries to get her to agree to go with him but loses his balance and falls out of the airplane.  Holly screams into the darkness!\n\n\nGus pulls Harley out of the restaurant so they can speak in private about her defense, but someone is watching and listening.... When Rick sees Beth eavesdropping on Harley and Gus, he asks her what she's doing, and she becomes very defensive and angry.  She is absolutely convinced Harley is guilty of murdering Phillip -- who Beth says was the love of her life.  When Harley and Gus hear the commotion, they enter the room and Beth is very ugly to Harley.  It seems that there is nothing Harley can do to make Beth happy, and when she is alone with Rick she slips and says \"Everything I did that night is all for.....\"  Rick is surprised: \"For what Beth, what did you do that night??\"  She rambles a little and then avoids the issue by kissing Rick on the lips.  He kisses her back -- just in time for Mel to walk in and see them.  Mel steps back long enough for the kiss to end, and when she takes Rick away telling him that she must talk to him, Mel looks back at Beth.  If looks could kill!\n\n\nGus later surprises Harley when she finds out that he bought the land on which her home stood before Phillip had it destroyed.  She is delighted, but even more so when he tells her that a contractor is going to rebuild her home, brick by brick, so that they can all be together in it when she is found not guilty.  She is afraid to hope for so much, but Gus is convinced she will be acquitted.\n\n\nBack at Cedars, Marina is outside by herself wishing upon a star.  Just as she breaks into tears, Danny finds her and holds her close.  Suddenly, it seems that perhaps it's not such a bad thing that Michelle doesn't remember him any more.\n\n\n",
