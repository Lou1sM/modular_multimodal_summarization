Reva thinks they should just wait and tell them in person, but Josh disagrees. After failing to find the right way to break the news, the pair decides to go out and record other people's thoughts. This doesn't go over too well though, since the first person they run into is Marina. She ends up going into her relationship with Danny in depressing detail. Finally Josh and Reva decided go separately to create the video message and then edit them together later. \n\n\nUnfortunately, things don't go well separately either. Josh wants to keep the news light and fun, but Hawk is bringing it down by talking about Jonathan and Tammy. Cassie's depressed for the same reason. On the other side of town, Tammy is happily talking about her and Jonathan's relationship, which makes Reva a little uncomfortable. When Jonathan starts joking around sarcastically, Reva gets upset because she wanted her kids to know there would be something good to come back to - not all of this bad stuff. Tammy realizes that Reva is ashamed of her and Jonathan. A chagrined Reva walks off for a bit, but tells Tammy that she intends to leave what she said in the video. With the camera, which has fallen on the ground, still running, Jonathan introduces himself to Marah and Shayne. He tells them how glad he is to be part of the party, mainly because of Reva's support. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Josh is still at Cassie's. She's confiding in him about Tammy. Finally she gets out of her funk and grabs Josh's camera. She turns the camera to herself and starts sincerely praising Josh and Reva. \n\n\nReva goes to Billy to record him and finds that he and his apartment are a wreck. After letting herself in, recorder in hand, Reva is horrified to find booze in Billy's place. He admits that he fell off the wagon over the holidays because he was all alone. This excuse doesn't sit well with Reva. She asks why he had to be alone - he could have gone to her place. Billy confesses he was alone because he wanted to be, because he needed a drink. After giving him a hug and dumping his booze down the sink, Reva starts talking about her \"addiction\" - Josh. Billy disagrees; he thinks Josh might just be the best thing that ever happened to her. But he warns her that she better make a decision fast, because Josh won't wait around forever and when he's gone, he's gone. \n\n\nLater that day, Josh and Reva meet at her place to compare notes. They review their recordings, and the result is pretty depressing. The only saving grace is Jonathan and Cassie's messages of praise. Finally they decide the best thing to do is just tell the kids the truth - not to try to hide it underneath false happiness. They begin again, this time with the truth. They tell kids that it has been a very difficult time for everyone this year, but state that everyone is trying to go forward with their lives. They tell them they are separated, but state that no matter what, they do love each other and they will always be a family. \n\n\n",
