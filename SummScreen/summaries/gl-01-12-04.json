He soon tires and sits, but Josh is quick to remind him how his son was never one for giving up. Shayne tries again with the help of Remy, Josh, Marah, Reva and Rick. This time he finds his balance and one by one they let go. Nico watches from the window as Shayne takes a single step and then another toward an elated Marina. When Ed joins him in the hallway, Nico says, \"Almost makes you believe in miracles.\" Unsmiling, Ed responds, \"Almost\" and walks away. \n\n\nBack in the room, Shayne can't wait to get home and start making more progress. Marina leaves to call Frank and Buzz, thanking Nico for all his help along the way. Reva cries at seeing hope in her son's eyes once again. Ed enters and congratulates his patient; he envies Shayne's courage. Josh shares Ed's sentiment. Both men look forlorn. Reva notices and reminds them it is a happy occasion. When Ed walks away, Reva asks Josh what that was all about. He is hesitant to answer, but when he speaks, he asks his wife if she believes in redemption. She wonders where this is coming from - he seems so far away. Isn't Shayne walking again redemption enough? Shayne can't wait to go home for his mom's home cooking. As they start to leave, he insists on walking out of his hospital room. His family helps him to his feet. \n\n\nOutside Shayne's room, Marina tells Marah she is thankful for the timing. She needed something uplifting right now in the midst of the Marianne Caruthers mess. She now admits her skepticism about the scarab rings is gone - her wish came true, and so did Michelle's (Danny's campaign for mayor is thriving). She asks Marah about her wish. Marah lies and says it was the same as Marina's, but if she had another one (vividly remembering her night of passion with Jeffrey), it would be for \"someone who gets me... who would love me for me.\" \n\n\nEden stands in her bathtub covered with suds and tells Tony to take one last look. He relishes in the fact he is able to get to her. She grabs a towel and asks him to leave. Their cell phones ring simultaneously and a recorded voice tells them both Bill and Danny are in danger. He wants to meet tonight at Towers parking garage and warns them to tell no one. Not keen on his idea of \"handling it,\" Eden won't let Tony go alone. \n\n\nIn the parking garage, Tony tries to persuade Eden to go back to the car as she's catching cold. She stifles her sneezing as he places his jacket around her shoulders. Suddenly, the lights go out and distant headlights blind them. A man in black stands in front of them and the same recorded voice tells them he'll do all the talking. He is dressed in a long black coat and refuses to come out of the darkness and show his face. He asks if they've told anyone about their last conversation. He assumes they have looked into who might be causing trouble for Danny and Bill. Laughing, he recalls the old radio show, \"The Shadow Knows.\" When he mentions Danny's campaign, Tony becomes defensive. Eden thought this was about Lewis Construction. The Shadow says they are connected and that certain people behind the scenes are using the campaign for their own \"corrupt purposes.\" He says Tony, especially, should know about whom he's talking. Tony swears the mob has nothing to do with his cousin's mayoral campaign; he's clean now. The Shadow laughs and says Danny did not bring the mob into Lewis... \"Bill did.\" \n\n\nBill comes home to an empty apartment, peeks at Eden's proofs from the Bad Girl photo shoot and calls his girlfriend's voice mail. He invites her to meet him at Olivia's for a drink as he stares at the photo of Eden scantily-clad on horseback. \n\n\nAt Olivia's bar, Harley chokes down oysters, refusing more, \"You know what they say about oysters.\" She implies Brad is trying to seduce her. Listening in from his office, Jeffrey O'Neill warns \"Terrier\" to be careful; Brad is the key to Spaulding. Harley admits her client is attractive, especially his position at such a powerful company. However, she is quick to mention Marie, Brad's wife. He promises their affair could be kept quiet. He spoons out another oyster to an unsuspecting Harley just as Gus surprises them. He thought she hated oysters. Brad says he just happened to run into Harley while she was waiting for her client and bought her a drink to thank her for all her help on the Lori Jensen case. As for the oysters, that was a bet. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a twenty for Harley just before excusing himself from the table. (Jeffrey is impressed by Brad's finesse). \nHarley removes her pin (the bug) and puts it in her purse, much to Jeffrey's dismay - she's still on the clock! Gus tells Harley he is concerned about Buzz. Gus saw him snap at Marina and now he's acting as if he were leaving town, even talked about changing Company's menu. Harley has a hard time believing that but suggests Alexandra may be the cause. When Gus mentions Spaulding Pharmaceuticals, Harley panics and leaves to see her dad. \n\n\nOn his way out, Gus meets Bill who is looking for Eden. Bill is hopeful his girlfriend and her brother can make amends and get along again. Gus insists he has tried. Bill offers to tell Eden he and Gus are working together. Once she discovers the two of them trusting each other she may see her brother in a new light. They get a drink to discuss it further. Bill proposes joint ventures between Spaulding and Lewis Construction. In the past, profits were lost simply because Josh and Alan didn't get along. He thinks he and Gus can change that situation. Gus reminds Bill that his stay at Spaulding is only temporary and he will be returning to the police force. Bill asks him to at least think about extending his stay. It'd be good for Spaulding, Lewis, and it may help Eden come to her senses about her brother, \"It's good for everyone.\" \n\n\nAt Company, Buzz receives a package - his plane ticket to Athens. He excuses himself to the cellar, returns with his army duffel bag and begins writing a goodbye letter. He is sad he will miss Harley's wedding, he wants the best for Frank and Darcy, and hopes one day Marina will be able to forgive him. Harley arrives, sees the bag and begs her father to talk to her - she can handle it. He suspects she's been talking to Marina. When Harley says she knows everything, Buzz says he just wanted to \"go quietly,\" and that everything is in the note. Harley wants to help and refuses to let him go. She promises she will get him the best doctors and treatments out there; she will not let him die! A confused Buzz assures her he is in perfect health. Relieved, Harley repeats what Gus told her about changing the menu and the possibility of leaving town. She was scared something was seriously wrong. They are interrupted by a waitress who hands Buzz the phone. On the other end, Marina cries happy tears and tells her grandpa how thrilled she is Shayne walked. Buzz says Shayne owes his progress to her because she stood by him through it all. He breaks off and covers his face with his hand. He says he is happy for them both and hangs up the phone. Harley sees Buzz's sad expression and asks what's wrong. He confesses he's felt useless lately and it gets him down. He tells Harley what Marina called about - Shayne is walking. Harley comments that both Shayne and Marina are two kids who never give up. She suggests Buzz stop moping and makes him promise not to change the menu. He agrees, and after she leaves, he rips up his goodbye letter. \n\nOutside Company, a concerned Harley calls Frank. She believes Buzz is keeping something from them. She thinks they should give him his space rather than risk losing him again. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Shayne's initial first step seems almost too good to be true. At first, he believes he had help. But when he tries it again, on his own, he and everyone else realize the miracle is real \u0096 Shayne can walk. Reva and Josh momentarily overcome the distance that's existed between them to revel in their son's recovery. Marah, too, is able to share in Shayne's moment. And most of all, Marina, his constant champion can hold him close and know their future is filled with possibility. But at that very moment, unknown to her, Buzz is preparing to leave town. At the same time, Gus seeks out Harley to tell her that he's worried about her father. But to Gus's surprise, he finds her with Brad. Harley is stuck for an explanation when Brad, of all people, bails her out. Later, when Gus tells her about Buzz, Harley has the sinking feeling that her father must be grievously ill. She goes to Buzz believing he \"won't be around\" much longer. In a case of comic misunderstanding, he tries to tell her goodbye, while she thinks he's headed for the grave. Thankfully, Marina calls Buzz to tell him the good news about Shayne. While praising his granddaughter for her unwavering courage and optimism, Buzz hears his own words and realizes he's running out on the people who need him most. By the end of the day, Buzz has a change of heart. Meanwhile, Gus encounters Bill, who is becoming more and more of a player in the political and business worlds of Springfield. Bill wants to include Gus in his plans for the future. While all this is going on, Tony and Eden's \"spa\" treatment is interrupted by a call from the informant with information that could save Bill and Danny. Tony and Eden go to a parking garage to meet the informant, who fancies himself \"The Shadow.\" And there they learn the name of the person who has brought the mob into Lewis Construction \u0096 and threatened Danny's campaign.",
