    "tvmega_recap": "Carrie gathers the three young women, wanting to know if their fathers and loved ones have demonstrated any regret or remorse, now that they've received the second letters. Marah and Marina reluctantly admit that the letters have only heightened the tension and the cover-up. Michelle is the last of the three to show up. She must first sneak out of the hospital to avoid Ed's suspicion. But Ed follows her, tormented by the thought that she could be with the person who had dredged up all the painful history of Maryanne Caruthers. At the same time, he hates himself for following his daughter as if she were his enemy. When he vents his rage at Buzz and Alan, they are less than sympathetic; and they insist Ed take them to where he last saw Michelle. But when they get there they are in for a surprise. Earlier, Alan and Alex discuss their concern with the \"right of succession\" at Spaulding, now that Phillip's mental health is an issue. Alan clearly sees Gus as his heir apparent much to Alex's dislike. And when Gus and Bill demonstrate a shared enthusiasm for a Spaulding/Lewis \"relationship,\" Alan seems to be getting his wish. However, Gus remains determined to return to the police force - where his natural curiosity causes him to doubt Alan's story about the stolen car. Alex, meanwhile, chastised by Gus for not keeping Brad Green on a tighter leash, seeks Brad out and warns him that his womanizing could very well cost them everything they've achieved even though what they've achieved has not been entirely by honest means. Their meeting with the Shadow does not convince Tony or Eden that Bill has done something corrupt. But it does tell Tony that if Eden truly loves Bill it's up to her to prove his innocence. Eden is appalled \u0096 Tony wants her to spy on her lover? But Tony points out it's the only way to clear Bill's name. And by the end of the evening, Eden is in Bill's arms, knowing that to help him, she must betray his trust.",
