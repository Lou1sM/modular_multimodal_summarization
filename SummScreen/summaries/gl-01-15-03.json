Marah couldn't understand why someone would do this.  Tony promised her that nobody was gong to hurt her or her family.  Marah was trying to convince Tony that she needed to drop out of school.  But he told her she couldn't drop out because he was also going to the University.  Tony found out that if a person had a type of equipment they could out in close to her house and make the calls.  \n\n\nAt the mental institution\n\nReva and Josh visited Annie's room.  It looked identical to the Lewis' study.  Annie appeared.   She ran to Josh and wanted to know how was his trip.  She continued to kiss him on the cheek.  She told him to not be afraid of the slut (referring to Reva).  Annie told her that Reva's obsession with Josh had gone on long enough.  Annie wanted to know why she was there bothering her and Josh.  Reva told Annie she had no hard feelings.  Annie said she had hard feelings even though she did win Josh.  Josh suggested to Annie they listen to what Reva had to say.  Reva wanted to know why she was bothering her by calling her.  Josh wanted to know if Annie had been calling.  Annie said, \"Busted.\"  Josh wanted to know why she had been calling Reva.  Annie told her she was a murderer.  Josh wanted to know why she was calling Reva.  She said since he had been out of town, she wanted to see if Reva had her hooks in Josh.  When Annie left the room to get some ice for the glass of water, Reva looked at the phone. Josh made the comment that there was no way Annie had been making the phone calls.  Reva couldn't think of anyone else that hated her enough to do this.  Annie enters.  Josh said he would walk Reva out.  He told Annie he had to go out of town again.  Josh and Reva exit.  Annie told Reva to come and see her and they would talk about the phone calls.\n\n\nAt the Beacon Hotel\n\nEdmund offered to buy Alex a sable coat if she would answer his question.  He wanted to know what was on her mind.  She replied that everything was going to blow up in her face.  When Alex answered her phone, it was Ray Baker.  He told her he was in the lobby and he was coming to her room.  Edmund offered to help, but she said it was business.  When a knock was heard at the door, Edmund introduced himself.  Edmund exits.  Baker told her they needed to renegotiate because of what he had that could destroy her precious family.  But she told him not to threaten her with blackmail.  But he said he would go to her brother or the press.  She warned him that if he does she would take him apart to where he would be poor and miserable.  He told her the clock was ticking.  Baker exits.\n\n\nAt the Spaulding mansion\n\nPhillip entered the study to find Alan.  Alan said he had messed up the best thing that ever happened to him.  Olivia entered.  He told her that he tricked her into signing the prenuptial.  He threw it into the fireplace.  He told her she was a free woman.  He said he would call the lawyers and release her bank account and her part of the Beacon.  He apologized for doubting her and apologized to Phillip.  He wanted them to give him a second chance.  Alan exits.  \n\n\nPhillip laughed and said Alan was good.  He asked her if she was buying the act.  He reminded her that this was not innocence from Alan.  But she wasn't convinced.  He also reminded her that he faked two heart attacks.  As she started to cry, Phillip apologized.  Phillip suggested she tell Alan that the marriage was over.  Olivia realized that Alan does love her.  He wanted to know when they made love; it was only payback to his father.  Olivia took Phillip's face in her hands and said that the night with him was wonderful.  But she pulled away.  Olivia exits.  Alex enters.  Phillip screamed at Alex and wanted to know if she was happy.  He told Alex he and Olivia were in love.  She told him to go ahead and tear the family apart.  Phillip exits.\n\n\nAt Harley's house\n\nBlake said she was out of the romance business.  She wanted to work with the big boys again.  Blake said Ross doesn't know about this idea. \n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Reva & Josh investigated the threatening phone calls by visiting Annie at the institution. She acted like she was married to Josh and lives in a room that looks just like his study. They thought she was completely loony and believed that she's not able to make the calls, which scared Reva more. Marah admired Tony for his life knowledge and said she wants to quit school, but he told her that he'd better not because he just started taking classed himself. He had a friend check into the calls and found out that they can be made to look like they're coming from anywhere in the world, as long as this little modem-like box is in the vicinity, so they planned to look for the box at Reva's home. Alexandra was distracted while Edmund chatted to her, worried about some big family secret and how Philip and Alan are fighting instead of getting along. She got a visit from a mysterious man who tried to blackmail her for more money. Alan told Olivia and Philip that he should have trusted and believed in them all along. He burned the prenuptial agreement and said that Olivia is free and will have all her money and accounts back. He left the room and Philip laughed that he was putting on a big act. Olivia was very confused and didn't know what to believe. After Philip pressured her to tell Alan about their night together, she fled the mansion. Harley and Blake shared some Oreos; Blake said she wanted to try being a businesswoman again.",

Alex said she wasn't happy and that she wanted to go back to the school she went to before she got married to Ross. Alan said he had messed up the best thing that ever happened to him. Olivia said he tricked her into signing the prenuptial.\n"
