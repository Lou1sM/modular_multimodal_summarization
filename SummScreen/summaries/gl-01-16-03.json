Rick Gardner enters. Harley introduced Gus.  Once they were seated, Rick said he had good and bad news.  He said the family court had assigned a court date.  The bad news was that Phillip charged that his son would be exposed to an unsavory environment.  Harley explained that Phillip thought that Gus would be a bad example.  Rick said to convince him that Mr. Spaulding was wrong.  Harley didn't feel as if she needed to defend Gus.  But Rick said the arbitrator didn't agree.  He reminded Gus the he committed a murder and burnt Eden with a cigarette.  But Gus said that his sister lied about everything.  He shared the information that Phillip tried to bribe Eden.  Gus said that Phillip obtained his records without Gus' knowledge.  Rick said that if Eden would swear that her previous testimony was false it would sway the decision.  Gus exits to find Eden.  Rick said if there was anything about Phillip she needed to bring it up.  He reminded her that she was going to need every weapon she could get her hands on.  \n\n\nGus enters.  He found Harley sitting beside the couch in the floor.  Harley said that Phillip was a jerk.  She told Gus that she was going to have to hit below the belt.  Gus told her that he couldn't depend on Eden.  Harley left to check on Jude.  Gus called his source about the information concerning Phillip.\n\n\nAt the Beacon Hotel\n\nAloud, Danny said this was no good.  Cassie enters.  She commented that he didn't need any more coffee.  Shaking his head, he said that all of his plans had been for Michelle and Robbie.  Cassie reminded him that he still had Robbie.  But he couldn't understand why Michelle was shacked up with Bill in a cabin.  He said, \"I would like to beat the hell out of him.\"  Danny said all the changes he wanted to make wouldn't be good since he couldn't share them with Michelle.  He thought that maybe Michelle would be better off with someone else.  Cassie said she knew what it was to lose someone.  Danny said he didn't know what will happen next.  Danny exits.  \n\n\nAt the Bauer cabin\n\nWearing pajamas and an old flannel robe, Michelle enters.  She told Bill good morning. She kicked off her house shoes.  She took off her robe. She walked in front of Bill and began to unbutton her pajama top.  Bill stood up and took off her pajama top.  He ran his fingers down her arm and across her stomach.  He then untied her pajama bottom...suddenly he realized he was dreaming.  He decided it was time to leave.  He said he felt guilty about being at the cabin when he had so much to do.  But Michelle didn't believe him.  He said he was leaving because of her.  As he was leaving, he said he was fine with taking things slow, but he couldn't hold up his end of the bargain.  She said it made her nervous when he spoke about how much he liked being with her.  He told her that he thought about coming to her bed the night before because he wanted to make love to her.  Michelle insisted he stay.  Bill decided it wouldn't be a good idea to leave her alone.  Michelle gave him a challenge for the slopes.  Buzz, Frank, Ben, and Marina enter.  Frank wanted to know where the chaperones were.  Bill said he had some jumper cables.  Ben, Frank, and Buzz exit.  \n\n\nMichelle told Marina to come back in her body.  But she said her family was wrecking her life.  Marina said she spent the night in a freezing car.  She said that Ben was so sweet to her.  Michelle wanted to know if Ben had been pressuring her.  Michelle told her she needed to be sure she is ready for this.  Michelle said a real relationship was based on respect, trust, and honesty.  She said she could tell that Ben cared about her.  Marina wanted to know if she was making a mistake with Bill.  Michelle said that was a good point.\n\n\nMichelle packed her suitcase and was ready to leave.  Bill asked her if she was going skiing.  Michelle suggested she go home.  She felt it wasn't good to be in such close quarters.  Frank told Marina that she lied again.  \n\n\nAt Company\n\nEden told Gus she was sorry that she ran out on him.  Gus explained the situation about Zach and that he wanted her to tell the truth about what happened on the roof.  But Eden didn't like to be pressured.  When she tried to stand up and leave, Gus pushed her down in her seat and said she was going in the courtroom and admit to what she did.  He told her if she didn't do this she wouldn't have a brother.  But she was worried about what she would say about their father since she was trying to protect both of them.  Gus reminded her to do the right thing.  He said what their father did had nothing to do with Harley.  He warned her to do the right thing or he would cut her loose.  But she said she couldn't.  He stood up and told her to take care of herself.  Gus exits.\n\n\nAt Inferno\n\nCassie enters with Robbie to see Danny.  Cassie said he could stay with him all morning.  Cassie said she wanted to remind him that his life could be as rich and wonderful as he wanted it to be.  Cassie watched as Danny played with Robbie.  \n\n\n",
