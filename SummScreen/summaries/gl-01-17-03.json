Bill was going to pick her up and take her to Towers.  \n\nFrank and Marina were fighting as Ben and Buzz look on.  Marina was pleading with her dad to trust her.  When Frank asked Buzz to explain why they couldn't trust her, he let it slip about the condoms he found in the car.  Frank was really hurt and demanded the kids return home that night and threatened to send Marina back to her mom.  Marina had never seen her dad that hurt.\n\n\nDanny returned Robbie to the Bauer's.  Ed was there and Danny told Ed he might as well have pushed Bill and Michelle into bed together since he encouraged Michelle to go to the cabin with him.  While they were talking, Michelle returned home.   Her and Danny talked a little while Michelle opened up some mail she received.  It was the final divorce papers.  Danny tried to tell her that they didn't have to sign them and that they could make a fresh start but he could tell by the look on Michelle face that she was serious about going through with the divorce.  Danny said what seemed to be his final good-bye to Michelle and when he left, she signed the papers.  \n\n\nBill went to see Beth to pick up some of the things he left there.  He could tell Beth had been crying and she explained to him that Lizzie wants to go away to boarding school.  Beth went to Phillip with Lizzie to try to explain the reason she wants to go to boarding school.  Lizzie can't handle all the difficulties in the Spaulding family.   She explained to her mom and dad that she knew Alan faked his heart attack.  She needs a break.  Bill suggested to not let her go but she explained that when someone wants to leave bad enough, you have to let them go.  When Beth started sobbing, Bill wrapped his arms around her.\n\n\nPhillip and Alan were arguing over Olivia and Alan figured out that Phillip is in love with her and suspects that they slept together while he was in the hospital.   Olivia sent a note to them through the Butler that she was leaving; she had to get away and clear her head.    Phillip and Alan agree to not talk to each other but Phillip had the last word by saying he would fight for Olivia and \"May the best man win.\"\n\n\n",
