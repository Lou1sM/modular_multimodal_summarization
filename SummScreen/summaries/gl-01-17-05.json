But, before she can say anything, Alan arrives. He uses a contrived excuse to get Beth away from Gus. He digs into Gus for trying to shift blame away from Harley by going after members of his own family. Gus stands his ground, prompting Alan to warn him not to make an enemy out of him. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Harley is grabbed from behind by a homeless woman, claiming dibs on the dress Beth had had placed in the donation bin. A struggle ensues and Harley finally convinces the woman to let her have it. Later, Harley and Gus examine the dress. They realize that any stain previously on the dress, has effectively been wiped out by an overlying bleach stain. \n\n\nJonathan encounters Edmund at the hospital and toys with him. Jonathan is on the verge of dropping the bombshell about spending the night with Cassie when Reva arrives. She gets rid of Edmund. Reva turns on Jonathan, asking that he not tell anyone what happened, especially Edmund. Jonathan, playing the guilt card, wonders why Reva thinks she owes Cassie any allegiance after the way she tried to set him up. Reva promises that she's still angry with Cassie but is asking him this as a personal favor. Jonathan agrees to back off. Later, Dinah questions Jonathan about the way he's obviously sitting on the bombshell. Jonathan casually tells her that messing with Cassie and Edmund, while fun, is not his main goal. \n\n\nBill and Olivia reel from the television stunt Alan pulled, which made them look complicit in Phillip's murder. Overcome, Olivia has to admit defeat and asks Bill to take back his offer to officially adopt Emma. Bill agrees to do whatever is best for Emma but then realizes that by keeping this information from Alan, they might be able to use it against him. \n\n\n",
