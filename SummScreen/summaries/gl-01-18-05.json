Jeffrey insists Frank must convince her to accept a plea, because, \"We both know she is guilty.\" Frank doesn't like what he hears, but he listens to the logic. But when Jeffrey talks to Gus, he gets an entirely different reaction. Gus refuses, and as he is about to tell Jeffrey exactly where he can take his offer, a deliveryman shows up with an envelope for him. Inside the envelope is Beth's dress, on which they ran forensic tests. When Gus reads the enclosed letter, he smiles and says, \"There will be no plea.\" \n\n\nMeanwhile, Harley has come so very close to getting Beth to talk to her about Phillip's death. Beth's behavior has been strange for some time now, and Harley and Gus both think she knows more than she is willing to say. Beth gets very angry, \"Alan warned me you'd try to get me to say something!\" Of course, that comment only made Harley more curious, \"What did you tell Alan about that night? Why are you so upset?\" And, of course, just as Beth is about to break down, both Rick and Lizzie show up and the moment of opportunity is gone. When Beth takes James and Lizzie home, Lizzie asks her why she is so upset, and tells her to, \"Chill out - it'll all be okay.\" But Beth looks anything except okay. When Lizzie takes James for a snack, Beth pours herself what looks to be a very stiff Scotch. \"Harley and Gus don't know anything,\" she says to herself. \"They are just fishing. They can't know anything.\" But she gasps and drops the Scotch when she sees the dress she wore the night Phillip was killed, the one which was just returned to Gus from the forensic lab, is hanging from the Spaulding mantelpiece. \n\n\nJonathan leaves the hospital, much to Josh's chagrin. Josh and Reva share a few barbs, and he retreats to Company for some hot chocolate. But it's no retreat, as he finds Sandy and Tammy there. Tammy is happy to see him and asks if Sandy can have a job at Lewis Oil. Before Josh can say no, Tammy leaves to talk with Reva. Josh and Sandy talk. It goes well; Josh even apologizes to Sandy for not listening to him when he talked about Jonathan. \"You were right about Jonathan,\" Josh said and offered Sandy his old job back. Sandy was very happy to accept the offer. \n\n\nTammy finds more than her Aunt Reva at their home, Jonathan is there as well. He is very angry and facetious, but then apologizes. However, when Reva joins Tammy outside, she tells her aunt exactly what she thinks of what Jonathan is doing to their family. \"Mom can't talk to you, Josh is miserable in his own home, and I don't feel welcome here any more.\" Reva is upset, but doesn't change her mind. However, Reva is very relieved when Josh later assures her they have weathered many storms in the past, and he will not let this be the last \"impossible situation\" in their marriage. \n\n\n",
