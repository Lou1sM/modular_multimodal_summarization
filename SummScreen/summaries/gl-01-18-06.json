    "soap_central": "\n\nDinah Marler is happy to be single. No, really. She is really, really happy to be single. In fact, being chained to a prison wall in solitary confinement is still preferable to being chained to a guy like A.C. Mallet. Whom she never thinks about anymore. And whom she is certainly not following around town. Or reading about in \"Love in the Lock Up.\" Or talking to on the cell phone and inadvertently accepting a date with. \n\n\nDinah is running frantically about her room, trying to get ready for dinner with Mallet, when Blake shows up. Dinah decides what she needs are some basic ground rules to keep her relationship with Mallet from ending...badly. Blake insists that Dinah needs a drink. They head downstairs, where Olivia provides some advice. Then, she and Blake take Dinah to a couple of male experts - Frank and Rick - to pick the perfect dress for her to wear. \n\n\nDinah and Mallet banter over dinner, with Dinah resolved not to fall for the banter. She falls for the banter. They're kissing when Mallet gets a call from Harley, needing him to come down to the courthouse. Mallet agrees and asks Dinah if she wants to come with him. Dinah reluctantly accepts. Unfortunately, listening to Mallet and Harley going over old times is enough to make Dinah beat a quick exit. She ends up at Alan-Michael's office, declaring she has no intention of putting all her eggs in one basket, and pulls him in for a kiss. Freaked out, Alan-Michael beats a hasty retreat. Which is when Dinah realizes her face is covered in hives, thanks to an allergic reaction. Mallet comes looking for her. Dinah is determined not to let him see her in such a state. But Mallet finally busts down the door and literally sweeps Dinah off her feet to take her to...the doctor. How can any girl resist that? \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "In a Dinah centric episode, we begin with a Dinah voice over telling us that she is beyond needing a man in her life. She can't help but still want Mallet after seeing him in Company and when he calls her and invites her to dinner after she dumps him she finally agrees. She is just about to call him and cancel when Blake shows up and after they talk, Blake decides to help her get ready. She calls Olivia into help, and after deciding they need a man's point of view call Rick and Frank over. Mallet picks her up for their date and kisses her in the hallway. He goes to kiss her again later but Dinah tells him that they went to fast before and should take it slower. Mallet gets a call from Harley needing help and he goes to help her but to her surprise invites Dinah along. Dinah is left out by their reminiscing and goes to Spaulding where she runs into and comes onto Alan-Michael. He is all for it until Dinah breaks out in hives from her dinner. Mallet finds her and calls Rick to her apartment to check her out. He then offers to stay with her until morning. In a final voice over Dinah says she still likes her independence but it is nice to have someone to be with, although she tells Mallet that there are some ground rules.",
