She also tells him what happened to Maryanne Caruthers. He listens intently to the pertinent information but gives little away. She tells him to follow the Spaulding line but she intends to deal with the men responsible for Maryanne's death herself. Lizzie has been pressing to visit Phillip and, despite Beth's misgivings, Christopher agrees that it's time to allow it. Beth and Christopher take her to Ravenwood and, when they go to the Nurse's station to check on Phillip, Lizzie meets Olivia who comes out of Phillip's room. Unaware that Olivia and Phillip have decided to marry, Lizzie cruelly reminds Olivia that she no longer has the baby to lure Phillip into marriage. Olivia and Phillip have agreed to keep their plans secret for the time being. Lizzie is stunned at Phillip's detached state, but she talks to him gently, reminding him of their family. She tells him that she and Beth want to take care of him. She is very moved by his embrace and his promise that she'll always be his baby.
