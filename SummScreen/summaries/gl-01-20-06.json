This news sends Tammy and Reva into an uproar. Reva knows Jeffrey made some kind of deal for Tammy and pleads with Jeffrey not to leave Jonathan hanging out to dry. Jeffrey steps out for a second to speak with Sandy. When court resumes, Wolfe calls Tammy on the stand to testify against Jonathan. Wolfe tries to badger Tammy into admitting that Jonathan started the fire. It becomes too much for Jonathan and he blurts out for her to leave Tammy alone--he started the fire by himself. As Jonathan demands to be allowed to testify, suddenly Sandy approaches the bench stating that he knows how the fire started. When he's on the stand, he testifies that he saw the pair running away from the house. When he entered, he saw the smoldering remnants of a fire. He threw the hot poker into the fireplace and stormed upstairs. When he came down, the rug had caught fire and it quickly spread. With Sandy's testimony, the judge dismisses the charges against Jonathan. Afterwards, Tammy thinks Sandy but he tells her he did it for her, not Jonathan. When Jonathan thanks him, Sandy whispers that he owes him. Meanwhile, Reva tells Jeffrey that she thinks that he got Sandy to lie on the stand. As it turns out, Jeffrey did suggest to Sandy that the best way to get Tammy back might be to be the hero. \n\n\nDinah and Harley have arrived at Harley and Mallet's old house in Florida. They start talking about Mallet, whom Harley insist is in her past; Gus is her future. After some talk, Harley starts to wonder if they're chasing a bogus lead--after all, Alan was seen injured up north. She then starts ranting at Gus for running off without telling her and putting her in this position. Dinah then veers the conversation back to Mallet. She confesses that she's afraid because Mallet did cheat on Harley, so he could do it again. Harley assures Dinah that they are all different people than they were years ago. Suddenly, a man comes to the door telling them he has information on Alan Spaulding. He tells them that Alan approached him, hurt and bloody, asking for money and a place to hide. The man states that he gave Alan money and is letting him hide out in an old dark shed. He then states that the money he gave Alan was for his niece's wedding -- and he really the $3,000 back. Suddenly Harley strong-arms him. She knows he's lying because Alan's claustrophobic, there's no way he'd stay in a dark abandoned shed. The man admits to lying and gets thrown out. Afterwards, Dinah assures Harley that Gus loves her and will find his way back to here.\n\n\nHarley admits that she does believe Gus is somewhere close trying to tell her something.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a bloodied Alan is lying at an unknown location in the wilderness.\n\n\nMallet's at CO2 working on some leads on Gus. Buzz approaches and accidentally lets it slip that Harley and Dinah went to Florida to follow a lead themselves. Mallet doesn't seem too concern which surprises Buzz. Mallet simply states that he's tired of running off after Harley. Buzz thinks Mallet's attitude is because he knows he cares too much and is trying to keep his distance from her. Mallet doesn't respond to that comment and keeps on working. Soon he starts having a vision of Gus. \"Gus\" tries to get him to reason out what must have happened. Mallet has theories: 1) Gus killed Alan and disposed of the body--No, he wouldn't kill his father 2) Gus stashed Alan away in a psychiatric hospital--No, too far-fetched. 3) Maybe it wasn't Gus who got the jump on Alan--maybe Alan got the jump on Gus. In other words, maybe Gus is dead. \n\n\nIn San Cristobel , Cassie is having a hard time believing Edmund's story about Jeffrey. He tries to convince her that it's true.
