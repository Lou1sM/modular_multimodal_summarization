She thinks he knows what's going on between her mom and his and asks him what he did. Jonathan tells her she's not going to like it, but she insists he tell her. Suddenly, Jonathan appears to change the subject and asks Tammy how the wedding was. She gets frustrated at first and then remembers how Cassie ran out earlier and wonders if he had anything to do with it. Jonathan starts talking about how the real Cassie is so different than the image she projects in public. Tammy thinks she's figured it out and accuses him of spying on her mother the night before the wedding. When she rants about what a terrible person he is, Jonathan asks about Sandy, prompting Tammy to defend him. She says Sandy nothing like him. Jonathan thinks she'd rather be with a guy like him, though. He says he thinks she still likes him and wishes he was just JB again and not her cousin. Tammy gets angry and tells Jonathan he did not change her world forever; he wasn't even that good. She leaves the house and slams the door. \n\n\nJosh and Sandy are at Lizzie & Company going over the details of Sandy returning to work at Lewis Construction. Josh suggests six day work weeks and then confesses he really just wants to avoid Jonathan as much as possible. Sandy warns him by doing that he's just giving Jonathan to Reva on a silver platter. Josh insists he can protect Reva without having to deal too much with Jonathan. Suddenly Reva arrives to speak with Josh alone. She asks if he hired Sandy to get back at Jonathan. Josh states that's not the case. Reva tells him that she feels like everyone is choosing sides, everyone against her and Jonathan. Josh invites her out for dinner, but Reva says she can't and suggests they have dinner at home with Jonathan. Suddenly Josh bails out and says he has too much work to do, he just wanted to stay at the restaurant with her and work as he ate. Reva's disappointed and leaves. Josh follows and tells Sandy there's more than one way to skin a stepson. \n\n\nWhen Reva gets home, Jonathan tries to make her feel guilty by whining how rough his days are ever since he was injured in the fall. However, she sees through his act and calls him on it. Reva tells Jonathan to stop trying to manipulate her and give them a chance. Just then Josh comes in the house and again invites Reva to go out to dinner with him. She is hesitant, but then Josh shows her he's provided for Jonathan by giving him a nurse for the night, a male nurse. Although she still doesn't think this is a good idea, Reva agrees to go with Josh. \n\n\nTammy, having read a note in Sandy's apartment, goes to the rooftop to find it decorated. Sandy appears and presents her with a rooftop dinner. He shows her, through a telescope, what he calls the hottest show in town: the Polar B Club getting naked on the beach. He tells her that watching usually cheers him up and it seems to do the same for Tammy. Tammy asks Sandy to tell her about himself since she knows nothing about him. He starts out by saying his family was poor and he had to learn to rely on himself. Tammy calls him a liar; she knows he went to boarding school, so his parents couldn't have been poor. Sandy tells her money doesn't make you rich, having people in your life does. He tells Tammy his parents traveled while he spent all his time in boarding schools. He never felt as if he had a family and that's why he wanted to be a part of one so badly. Touched, Tammy and Sandy kiss. At the same time, Tammy's cell phone rings. It's Jonathan, but Tammy doesn't know because she's not really interested in answering her phone right now. \n\n\nGus and Harley are on a football field waiting for Buzz. The conversation inevitably turns to her situation and her feeling that she may be guilty. Gus assures Harley she didn't kill anyone and she's not going to prison. He says he's sure Beth knows something, but Harley isn't too keen on doing this to Beth. Buzz arrives and tells the pair they're there for the Annual Cooper Football Game. Gus tries to get out of it by saying he and Harley need to work on strategy for the trial tomorrow, but she insists on playing. She offers Gus a deal: they'll play on different teams. If her team wins, they handle her case her way, if his team wins, she'll do whatever he says. Gus can't pass up that plan and agrees. The rest of the gang arrives and they pick teams. Harley gets Frank, Coop and Marina while Gus gets Alexandra, Lizzie and Danny. Harley comments to herself this is too easy, she almost feels guilty. She may have a point since neither Alex nor Lizzie seems to know anything about football. Before the game starts, Harley tries to reach Beth by phone and is surprised to learn she's gone. During the game, she tries to get info from Lizzie on where Beth is, but Lizzie doesn't say anything. A little later, Gus tackles Harley and when she appears injured, he suggests she sit the bench. To make the teams fair, Alex graciously volunteers to do the same. Alone on the bench, sitting next to Lizzie's bag, Harley gets Roxy out so she can get a peek at Lizzie's cell phone to see if Beth called her today. Her hunch pays off and she learns Beth's at a spa. However, now it's half-time and Lizzie comes over and sees Harley is going through her bag. Harley makes a lame excuse to avoid suspicion. \n\n\nAt the same time, Buzz is asking Frank about Harley's case. Frank tells his father Jeffrey was willing to cut her a deal but Gus refused it. He also says Jeffrey believes Gus is jeopardizing Harley's case. When Buzz asks Frank if he, as police chief, thinks Harley shot Phillip, he can't answer since he doesn't know what to think. He turns the question back on Buzz who states he wishes he could say no. Right after, Buzz goes over to speak with Gus alone. He tells Gus he doesn't want him handling Harley's case anymore. Gus tries to tell him that no one cares more about Harley than he does, but Buzz maintains that Gus isn't objective. Gus insists he will prove Harley's innocence. Buzz seems slightly reassured but instructs Gus to be a lawyer. \n\n\nAlso during half-time, Marina and Danny are enjoying themselves playing catch. Their new bond isn't lost on Frank who hurriedly re-starts the game and then promptly goes after Danny. Frank warns him to stay away from Marina, pointing out that he's a danger to her. Frank brings up the Santo Domingo fiasco as an example. Marina tries to get Frank to calm down and tells him she cares about Danny. But he simply states that if she loved him, she'd stay away from Danny. Danny tells Marina her dad has a point and turns to leave. Marina goes after Danny and suggests they both leave and get something to eat. Danny tries to dissuade her and suggests she listen to her father, but Marina doesn't care what her father thinks. Meanwhile, Frank is on the sidelines fuming. \n\n\nWith the game apparently over, Lizzie taunts Coop with the fact that her team won. When Coop accuses her of cheating, they argue. After some teasing, Lizzie trips and falls, knocking Coop to the ground. There on the ground, the two share a genuine moment. At the same time, Alex and Buzz commiserate over how it might have been if things had turned out differently. They also briefly discuss Harley's upcoming trial. Alex and Buzz hope Harley can prove she didn't kill Phillip. \n\n\nWith the game over, Harley tries to tell Gus she's found out where Beth is. However, Gus is not about to let her jeopardize her case by making it seem as if she'd skipped bail since they'd have to cross the state line. He vetoes the idea of them finding her. Since Gus' team won, he reminds her they're doing this his way. He takes her to the Springfield Inn where they can discuss another lead he has. At the hotel, Harley tells Gus how exhausted she is, and maybe they'd better just forget the other lead, go home, take a shower, and get some sleep. But Gus isn't an idiot and sees through her little ploy. He knows she wants to go out there and find Beth, which is why he's not going to let her out of his sight. With that, Gus locks them together in the room. \n\n\n\n\n",
