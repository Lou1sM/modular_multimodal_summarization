He knew that his mother couldn't have children.  Harley said she would stop investigating if he asked.  Gus was concerned that Eden intercepted the package.  But Harley said she was the person that had pushed this investigation.  Gus told her he loved her and that he loved Zach.  He decided to not let Phillip or Alex get in the way of getting custody of Zach.  Gus suggested they gather their information and see where it took them. He said he knew where to start.  Gus and Harley exit. \n\n\nWhen Gus and Harley returned they found a fax.  Gus called Sonny for him to send the second page showing the autopsy.  Sonny said there wasn't an autopsy.  He told Gus that Detective Joe August sent the report.\n\n\nAt the Spaulding Mansion\n\nAlan asked Nolan if he got the mail, but there wasn't anything from Olivia.  Nolan told him there was one envelope addressed to Phillip.  Lizzie and Beth entered.  Alan wanted her to be sure that she wanted to go to boarding school.  Alan suggested that Phillip and Beth go along with her.  Lizzie exits.  Beth said she got it because Alan wanted her and Phillip to get back together.  But Alan said she was wrong in this case.  Alan was excited that Lizzie was making her own decision since she had a tough year.  Alan agreed that he wanted Phillip out of town.  He said that he was trying to save his marriage by getting Phillip out of town.  Beth said it was doomed to fail.  He reminded her that Phillip and Olivia could end up together.  \n\n\nPhillip enters.  Beth asked him if she would like to accompany her and Lizzie to the boarding school.  Phillip explained to her about the conversation with Rick.  Beth agreed with Rick.  Phillip agreed to be a part of his daughter's life and decided to go with them.  \n\n\nAlan told Nolan to be sure that Phillip not get the letter.  Nolan agreed.  Alan opened the letter to find it from Olivia.  In her letter she said she knew she needed a man that will push her and that man was Phillip.  She wanted to meet Phillip the next day at the Beacon.  Lizzie entered and wanted to know why he was sitting in the hallway outside of the study.  They went into the study.  Phillip told her that he and Beth were going with her today.  Alan told Phillip to not worry about a thing.  When Phillip asked Nolan if there was any mail, Nolan answered no.  Beth, Lizzie, and Phillip exit.  Once again, Alan read the letter. \n\n\nAt Company\n\nPhillip entered.  He wanted to talk to Rick.  He talked about the hearing date for the custody of Zach.  He wanted to be sure he could count on Rick as a character witness on his behalf.  Rick said he couldn't because he agreed to do that for Harley.  Outside of company Phillip was upset that Rick was taking Harley's side.  Rick suggested he work out something with Harley.  But Phillip said that the sleazy Gus wasn't going to come out on top.  Rick said he was comfortable with Gus being a part of Jude's life.  Phillip said that Gus was blackmailing him.  Rick said it was ironic that he was worried about Gus' morality when he slept with his father's wife.  Rick told him that he was wrong about this.  Phillip said when this was said and done he will have his son and Olivia too. \n\n\nAt the Beacon\n\nRoy Baker entered and wanted to talk to Alex about money.  But Alex said he wasn't going to get any more money.  Alex agreed to meet him in about 45 minutes, so they decided to meet in the lobby.  Phillip enters.  Alex wanted to apologize for what she said.  Phillip asked her why she helped Harley and Gus, but not her own family.  He said she was helping the low life Gus.  Phillip exits.  Edmund enters.  When Edmund asked Alex if there was something wrong, she said there was nobody she could trust. He reassured he that she could trust her.  She wanted to ask him to do a favor.\n\n\nShe told him that her family was heading for a disaster.  She wanted to call on his skills as a leader of men.  She wanted him to lead someone in isolation for a while.  In other words, kidnapping.   Edmund agreed.  Alex told him it was Roy Baker.  She mentioned that she was meeting him in the lobby in 15 minutes.  She told him to not betray her because she could be a dangerous enemy.  \n\n\nEdmund told Baker he loved the hat.  He told Edmund to tell Alex he was running out of patience.  Edmund told him that Miss Spaulding was uneasy to speak to him in the public eye and asked if they could meet somewhere out of town.  Baker said he had an apartment in Clayton.  But he refused to go with Edmund.  He suggested they meet at his apartment, but Edmund suggested he go with Edmund.  Edmund told him to not make it a problem.  \n\n\nRoy Baker's apartment\n\nGus wanted to break into the safe.  Harley picked the lock on the door to the apartment and they entered.  But the safe was empty.  Harley felt as if someone beat them to it.  She found a newspaper clipping from thirty years ago.  The clipping told of an unidentified female found in a hotel room five days before Gus was born.  Harley noticed a stamp on the back from the Chicago police.  They decided it was a stolen article.  Gus called Sonny, his friend in Chicago.  They thought it strange that a woman that couldn't have children had a child, but yet a female was found five days before Gus was supposed to have been born.\n\n\n",
