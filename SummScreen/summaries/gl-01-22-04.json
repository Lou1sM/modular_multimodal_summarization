    "tvmega_recap": "Harley gets a surprise when she meets with Brad \u0096 who's arranged for a private party in a hotel suite for just the two of them. She manages to photograph something suspicious in his briefcase but is nearly caught when Gus calls and Brad goes for her photo-phone. Jeffrey provides an escape for her and Brad rushes home to keep Marie from getting suspicious \u0096 but Harley's near-romantic interlude with Brad has her feeling dirty and disgusting. She goes home and despite the guilt she feels, asks Gus to hold her. Tony finds the three men working for Lewis Construction he's suspicious about and confronts them about their ties to the mob. They try to stonewall but Tony has their number and warns them they'd best leave town. Eden wonders if the problem's been solved, but Tony knows its just beginning \u0096 and as he suspected, he gets a call from the boss, Bruzi. They arrange a meeting. Shayne's set Marah up with a blind date; he's a nice enough guy but doesn't stand a chance, especially when Jeffrey arrives at the same restaurant. She sneaks over to his table for some relief from her date, Luke, but gets a shock when Jeffrey's date, Miko arrives. She endures the rest of the evening as best she can but finally leaves, abruptly. Jeffrey's been affected, too; he tells Miko they need to take a break from their affair. Cassie finds Sandy watching tapes of Richard and he confesses she's the one who stirred his interest in the father he never knew. As they connect, she suggests he also find room in his life for his mother, Reva \u0096 but Sandy's hesitant and the surprising reason is his reluctance to have her find out how tough things were for him growing up. She's impressed \u0096 and thinks it's just the kind of thing Richard would do. They promise to continue this new connection, but Sandy continues to watch the tape of Richard with strong interest.",
