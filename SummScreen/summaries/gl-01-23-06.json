They ambush Mallet, who is entering with his own key. After the two women tackle him, Mallet says he's dreamed of something like this but it had always involved whipped cream. When he gets to his feet, they all three acknowledge they've found no clues, other than the con artist who tried to bilk Harley and Dinah earlier. As Mallet and Harley compare strange \"Gus sightings,\" Dinah feels left out and excuses herself to pick herbs outside. She repeats to herself, \"Not jealous, not jealous. Not the new Dinah.\" After questioning from Harley, Mallet confesses he turned in his badge not to win Harley, but to find Gus-so she shouldn't feel guilty. He admits he missed Dinah after she left Springfield for Florida. Dinah returns and she and Mallet laugh it up in the kitchen while Harley turns away, looking sad. After eating Dinah's cooking, the three decide to \"scam the scammers\" and have Dinah spread around a little cash to get leads at the clubs and casinos. After her toast to Dinah, Harley again looks sad. Mallet says, \"More wine!\" and the three tell humorous \"Gus stories.\" As Harley tells hers, we again see Alan, only now he is waking up, quietly repeating, \"Gus...Gus...\" \n\n\nOn Main Street, after talking to Harley on the phone about how much she is missed and how he doesn't like the CEO role, Alan-Michael calls a board member to assure he has the votes to be the new CEO. Marina accuses Alan-Michael of trying to get out of their date, but he assures her they are going to a party she'll never forget. They kiss, Franks sees it, and Marina tells her dad to back off. Alex shows up and tells Alan-Michael to be careful about trying to have it all, both the Spaulding power and the Cooper sweetness. He says she may have been unsuccessful at achieving it all but he could - besides he's only out to have fun with Marina. When Alan-Michael and Marina reunite they share that their relatives don't trust one another. When they arrive at the \"party\" it turns out to be a candlelit room at The Beacon. After passionate kissing, Marina insists they have their dinner before going any further. Alan-Michael leaves to get a better vintage of champagne from the wine cellar. While he's gone, Marina finds an announcement for an emergency Spaulding board meeting which calls for Alan-Michael to replace Harley as the CEO of Spaulding. Marina leaves and Alan-Michael returns to an empty room. \n\n\nAt the Court House, a reporter interrupts a kissing Tammy and Jon with the question, \"So, you're in love with your cousin?\" Tammy plays it cool and tells the reporter she has plenty to say about their relationship, but it's not an apology. As Tammy is reflecting to the reporter on why she fell in love with Jon, Jon calls off the interview and forces the reporter to leave. Inside the courtroom, Tammy shouts, \"We're free!\" Jon says how he thinks it is weird that Sandy and Jeffrey were the ones to get them out of trouble. Tammy says to just be grateful they got what they wanted. Jon grabs Tammy's hand and they run out of the courtroom to Main Street where Jon puts up the letters \"JON LOV S TAMMY\" on the movie marquee. He laments the \"E\" was not available. Tammy is upset she can't share her happiness with her mother, so Jon encourages her to go see her, which she does. \n\n\nAt the farm house, Jeffrey returns home with flowers but Cassie confronts him about his past and his secrets. He admits that when he was a federal agent his whole life was about lies. He confesses to Cassie that he impersonated Richard for security reasons and it was a bad idea to choose Dinah as the stand-in for Cassie, given their history. Jeffrey and Cassie recall their first meeting at The Beacon when Cassie fainted when she saw Jeffrey, thinking he was Richard. Jeffrey says he fell in love with her at first sight. He admits he had decided to never tell Cassie about his impersonation of Richard because he now has a chance at a real life. When he goes to embrace her, Cassie recoils and says she needs time. He leaves to spend the night at The Beacon, after telling her he loves her. \n\n\nLater, we see Richard walking forlornly along Main Street, with Jon alone in the background. Tammy arrives at the farm house and she and Cassie encounter one another-Tammy with a hopeful smile and Cassie with a sad one. \n\n\n",

Tammy says she doesn't want to hide anymore and tells the reporter that yes she and Jonathan are half cousins and yes they are in love. When she starts to go into more details about Jonathan he stops her again and sends the reporter away. He tells her that he will tell the world and changes the movie marquee in the square to say Jon Lov s Tammy. Tammy says that only one thing would make this better and Jonathan sends her to talk to her mom. Tammy wants him to go with her but he says she should go alone and wait for him. Cassie waits for Jeffrey and then confronts him with the news that Edmund told her about him pretending to be Richard. He doesn't deny it and tells her that it was all for work. He tells her that they can move past it and she tells him that is what Edmund always used to say. Cassie says she doesn't know if she can forgive him and he decides to stay at the Beacon for the night. Mallet goes down to Florida to help Dinah and Harley and Harley correctly guesses that he gave up his badge to help her out. He also admits that he missed Dinah also. The three put their heads together and decide to try and scam the scammers. They toast to their friendship and tell stories about Gus.
