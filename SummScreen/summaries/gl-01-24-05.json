Her thoughts are interrupted when Ross and Blake arrive and invite her to have dinner with them. Holly refuses, saying she has an appointment with the eye doctor. She asks Ross if he would drive her to the appointment. He agrees and Blake wants to ride along, but Holly admits she needs legal advice from Ross. Blake is confused but agrees to wait for them. At the hospital, Holly leads Ross to the AA meeting room. She apologizes to Ross for lying and tells him she can't face the meeting alone. Ross says he understands and would be happy to accompany her. Once inside, they realize the meeting has been cancelled. Holly suggests they join Blake at Company, but Ross wants to know the real reason they are there. Holly confesses Sebastian didn't die on the island of disease. She pushed him away to stop his kisses and he fell out of an airplane. She berates herself for being a victim of her addictions - alcohol, Roger Thorpe and now, his son Sebastian. Ross refuses to bear witness to her woe and tells her she beat her addictions and won when she shoved Sebastian away from her. They agree to keep the circumstances of Sebastian's death a secret from Blake. \n\n\nIn the study at the Spaulding mansion, Bill grabs Alan by the coat and flings him across the room. Alan demands to know why Bill has invaded his home and reaches for the phone to call security. Bill grabs the phone and says he is there because the company he formed with Olivia, Slingshot Enterprises, has lost customers since Alan arranged to air a TV program implicating Olivia and him in Phillip's death. Alan needles Bill about his company and threatens to do more damage. Bill returns the taunt, reminding Alan that soon his granddaughter, Emma, will be his child and no longer a Spaulding. Alan gets riled and tells Bill he will ruin him and his company if he attempts to raise Phillip's child as his own, 'That's a threat and a promise.' Bill responds he doesn't go for threats, he goes for the throat! He is in the process of strangling Alan when Olivia arrives and convinces Bill to control himself before he makes matters worse. Olivia and Bill argue when she suggests he leave so she can speak to Alan in private. Once Bill leaves, Olivia offers Alan a deal. If he backs away from Slingshot Enterprises and agrees not to fight her for custody, she will deny Bill the right to adopt Emma. Alan is intrigued but makes no promises. He says he will consider her deal and ushers her out of the door. Olivia smiles to herself as Alan shuts the door behind her. \n\n\nLater, she meets Bill at Company who asks if their plan has worked. \n\n\nIn Gus' suite, Harley pleads with him to let her go so she can find Beth. He refuses, saying she is out on bail, for which he fronted the money, and he intends to protect his investment. Getting nowhere with demands, Harley becomes coy and flirts with Gus. She advances on him with kisses and whispers until he is backed into the wall. She saunters away to the bathroom and tells him not to go anywhere. Gus looks at his watch, nodding his head the instant Harley screams, 'I'm going to kill you!' from the bathroom. The room has no windows, her escape plan is foiled. Later, after another failed attempt to ride away to freedom beneath the room service cart, Harley breaks down and tells Gus that by keeping her from finding Beth, he is ruining her only chance to prove she may be innocent in Phillip's murder. She sinks to the floor and pleads while holding onto the bedpost. Atop the bed, Gus strokes her hair and tells her he knows she is innocent because she doesn't have it in her to murder anyone. Harley again begs to be let go so she can talk to Beth. Gus promises they will talk to Beth as soon as she returns from the spa. Harley, recovered, says that will be too late, 'I have to go now.' She stands, grabs the key from the bed and heads for the door. Gus tries to follow but falls down because Harley tied his shoestrings to the bedpost. \n\n\nGus arrives at the mansion to find Alan on the phone in the study. He demands to know where Beth is. Alan tells his son never to interrupt him that way again. Gus responds that Alan is harboring a material witness. Alan is shocked and tells Gus he is harboring someone who may be a cold-blooded murderer. Gus says he is protecting the mother of Phillip's child. Alan corrects him, saying he is only protecting his girlfriend. He tells Gus he is fired from Spaulding. Gus says he can't fire him and once he proves Harley's innocence he is going to take the company, the property and the great big old house with Alan's name on it. He storms off to find Harley. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Gus takes Harley to the Springfield Inn to prevent her from leaving the county. He's afraid she'll leave in an attempt to track down Beth. He warns her that jumping bail would make her look guilty in the eyes of any jury. But Harley's convinced that if she's able to grill Beth she can finally know for sure whether she's guilty or innocent.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gus keeps Harley captive at the hotel. After a few failed escape attempts, she finally gets away to go find Beth. Gus goes to Alan to find out where Beth is. Alan plays dumb and then fires Gus. Gus threatens that he is going to prove that Harley is innocent and then take the company, the property, and the big house with Alan's name on it from him. At the spa, Harley finds Beth. Beth is terrified that Harley wants to know more about the night Phillip died. She finally breaks down and tells Harley she did a terrible thing. Bill charges in on Alan, but Olivia breaks them up and sends Bill away. Olivia makes a deal with Alan-he backs off Slingshot and agrees not to pursue custody of Emma if Olivia doesn't let Bill adopt Emma. Alan is clearly intrigued by the deal. Later, we see Bill asking Olivia if Alan fell for their plan. Holly pulls Ross away from Blake to take her to an eye appointment which really turns out to be an AA meeting. Holly confesses that she almost took a drink, and that she has another addiction-men that are bad for her. Then she confesses to pushing Sebastian off of her and out of the plane. Ross tells her that she did what she had to in order to survive, and that she has nothing to feel guilty about. Back at company, Ross picks up Blake. She wants to stop by Holly's house, but Ross doesn't think it's a good idea. Holly is still being haunted by thoughts of Sebastian, and then we see him ALIVE (but it's not obvious where he is).",
