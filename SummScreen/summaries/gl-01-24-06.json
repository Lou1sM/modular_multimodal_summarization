Lizzie tells him he'll have to take her to lunch. They head to CO2 together. There, they run into Coop and Ava. Lizzie and Coop hug while Quinn and Ava look on. Ava, who witnessed Lizzie kiss Quinn, has a conversation with Coop. She hints that Lizzie may not be treating him right. Coop tells Ava how Lizzie has had a rough life. He explains about the tragedies Lizzie has had growing up - shooting her mother's abusive ex-boyfriend, battling leukemia, being kidnapped by her father, and finding her father dead at her grandfather's hand. Ava feels sorry for having animosity toward Lizzie once she's heard the truth. Coop tells Ava that he's willing to take Lizzie, good and bad. Quinn leaves Lizzie alone at the table. Coop and Ava return. Lizzie makes a big fuss about Ava being her new great friend, giving her the gift she'd received from Quinn while pretending she'd purchased it for Ava herself. Ava doesn't know what to say after accepting the gift. Lizzie leaves before Ava opens the gift. Once Ava sees the very expensive handbag she thinks Lizzie has given her, she tells Coop it's too expensive. She wants to take it back to Lizzie's store to get something less expensive and have Lizzie's employee account refunded. Coop asks to go along since Lizzie has never let him visit her at work. Meanwhile, as Lizzie is leaving CO2, she runs into Quinn again.

Jonathan tells Reva there is a man out there for her, and Reva gives off a vibe that she's still interested in Josh.

At first, Reva doesn't seem concerned, but she quickly heads out of the house for shopping at Main Street. \n\n\nJosh runs into Jeffrey at the Beacon.

Olivia gives Josh and Reva a moment to talk. Reva tells Josh she doesn't think Olivia is any good for him, but he retaliates by telling Reva she has no business interfering in his life since she's the one who said he wasn't enough for her and never would be. Reva begins to tell Josh that she still wants him in her life and would like to patch things up when Olivia reappears. Reva sits on a bench on Main Street watching Olivia and Josh on their date. \n\n\nTammy goes to the farmhouse and finds Cassie looking somewhat glum.
