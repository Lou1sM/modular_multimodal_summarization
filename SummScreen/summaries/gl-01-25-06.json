Leaving him sleeping, she starts her day downstairs. While coffee brews Cassie looks at photos of Jeffrey and her. Taking one, she opens a photo album and compares it against photos of Richard and her. Cassie relives an earlier conversation with Jeffrey and says out loud that she wants to believe him. \n\n\nDressed, Cassie tells a still sleeping Jeffrey that she needs to find the truth and can't get it without help. She goes to Richard's grave and apologizes for not visiting more often. She tells him she's confused and doesn't know what's real and what isn't anymore. Richard appears in full regalia. He listens as Cassie tells him she can't move forward with Jeffrey unless she knows where she's been and where he's been. \n\n\nJeffrey wakes up to find Cassie gone. He notices the photo album and realizes she was comparing photos. \n\n\nRichard tells Cassie that he is in her imagination and can't help with her decisions. He wants her to make her own choices, even make her own mistakes. Cassie tells him she has so many questions in her head. Richard asks her, \"What does your heart feel, darling?\" Cassie responds that it's telling her to be careful. She now questions Jeffrey's loyalty. Richard disappears. \n\n\nCassie catches up with Dinah and tells her that she knows Jeffrey impersonated Richard all over Europe. She wonders where Dinah fit into it. Dinah says she would have done anything to get out of prison. Jeffrey was looking for someone who knew Cassie to help in his mission. She was the perfect choice and she used it as way to get back at Cassie. Dinah says she at least, owned up to her part and her obsession, which was more than Jeffrey did. He really loved playing the role of Richard. For him it became very real. Dinah warns Cassie that she's about to ruin her life with Jeffrey because she doesn't see him as perfect as her ideal Richard. \n\n\nLater, Cassie and Jeffrey are helping RJ perfect his roller skating. Jeffrey is giving him pointers and encouragement. Cassie recalls a similar time with Richard when he was helping RJ learn to ride horseback. Cassie's mind wanders as she thinks about what Richard said to RJ at the time and is unnerved that Jeffrey uses so many of the same words. Cassie asks Jeffrey if he remembers when RJ learned to ride a horse. Jeffrey tells her he wasn't in San Cristobel then. \n\n\nJeffrey takes Cassie back to Richard's grave and questions her about whether Richard ever told her about him. He says Richard wasn't truthful with her and Cassie agrees. She tells Jeffrey she's angry because he's taking every beautiful moment she had with Richard and making her doubt them. Jeffrey assures her all those private moments were just that - private moments with Richard. They are interrupted by Doris Wolfe. She wants papers from Jeffrey first thing in the morning. She lets Cassie know Jeffrey now works for her. Jeffrey confirms that he is no longer the DA, but he was thinking of cutting back on his workload anyway. \n\n\nCassie asks Tammy to spend the day with her. They are transported to a formal living room in San Cristobel where Cassie asks Tammy to remember all she can about her times with Richard. In particular, she wants to know if Richard ever seemed to be different, not himself. Tammy is puzzled and Cassie asks her if she remembers the day they went to the beach. Tammy does and says yes, Richard did seem different. She found it strange that he said he hated going to the beach. She recalls that Richard loved the beach. Cassie asks Tammy if there was a moment when Richard left the beach. Tammy remembers there was and questions the possibility that Jeffrey and Richard changed places. Tammy comforts Cassie and tells her to hold on to her memories of Richard but reminds her mother that she loves Jeffrey now. \n\n\nJeffrey talks to the agency and tells whoever is on the other end of the phone to destroy all the records because they owe him one. \n\n\nCassie and Tammy return to Springfield. Cassie arrives home to find Jeffrey and RJ playing. Jeffrey tells her he's been thinking about his future and perhaps going into private practice. \n\n\nCassie is again at Richard's grave and is joined by Josh. She thanks him for coming and the two of them discuss Jeffrey and Richard. Cassie tells Josh she's trying to do right by both men. When Josh asks what he can do, Cassie asks him to help her look for answers. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cassie wakes up next to Jeffrey and goes out to look at her pictures from San Cristobel. She compares pictures of Jeffrey and Richard. She goes to visit Richard's grave and while there imagines that she sees him. She asks him to give her answers but he tells her that she has to find the answers herself. She then confronts Dinah who tells her that Jeffrey enjoyed playing the prince as much as she did playing the princess. At the farm Jeffrey awakens and sees the pictures. Cassie comes back to the farm and throws herself into his arms. She tells him she still needs time and asks him about the times he played Richard. They visit Richard's grave together, where Doris finds them and lets Cassie in on the fact that Jeffrey gave his job up to get Tammy off. Cassie says that times like this are why she fell in love with him. While they are helping RJ learn to skate, Cassie flashes back to a similar time with Richard. She tells Jeffrey she needs to go and take care of some stuff and goes to see Tammy. Jonathan isn't happy, but Cassie says that she needs Tammy to come with her for the day and Tammy goes. They go to San Cristobel and try to remember if there were times that they could have been with Jeffrey instead of Richard. Cassie does remember a particular kiss that she knows was Jeffrey now, not Richard. Returning to Springfield, Cassie goes back to the gravesite where she calls Josh to come and meet her since she says he is the only one she can talk to about this.",
