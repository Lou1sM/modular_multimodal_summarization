Sandy defends himself saying that he wasn't peeking; he simply ducked inside in order to avoid them and was waiting for them to leave. Sandy informs them that he may be moving away soon; Jonathan doesn't think soon is fast enough. After Tammy leaves, Sandy informs Jonathan that he closed on the house--it's all his now.

Thinking she already knows everything, Jeffrey admits that, yes, he did he did impersonate Richard in San Cristobel. Reva's shocked at his outburst because she had no idea. Jeffrey explains that as a government agent, it was his job to keep Richard safe. He then goes on to admit that Cassie found out and is freaked out about it. Reva suddenly asks if he was Richard with her. Jeffrey puts her mind at ease--he came to San Cristobel long after she was Princess Catherine. Jeffrey confesses that he liked being Richard. Not so much the power, but the respect. He tells her Richard had everything a man could want. Reva mentions how Cassie must be driving herself crazy trying to figure out when he was Richard with her. Jeffrey suggests that Cassie could really use her sister right now. Reva agrees but Cassie's not exactly calling her; Cassie doesn't trust her anymore. Jeffrey is still concerned that Cassie needs someone to talk to. A little later, Jeffrey goes to the bar to get a drink. At the bar, he remembers being in San Cristobel. He was enamored of Cassie and kept trying to tell himself she was another man's wife. Suddenly a tipsy Cassie comes in from the party downstairs. Although he tries to discourage her Jeffrey, as Richard, made love to her. \n\n\nMeanwhile Cassie is talking to someone about Jeffrey---Josh. They're waiting for his friend in the Justice Department. Josh gives her a chance to back out from finding the truth, but she insists that she needs to know. Cassie tells him that this information changes everything about her marriage to Richard as well as her relationship with Jeffrey. She needs to know when she was with Richard and when it was Jeffrey. Finally, Josh's friend arrives and informs that the file on Jeffrey's assignment to San Cristobel is classified. Undeterred, Cassie threatens to go to the press with the knowledge of Jeffrey's assignment unless he helps her. The agent leaves to see what he can do. Later the agent comes back with bad news--he can't get access to the file for security reasons. Josh asks if that means there is sensitive information in the file. His friend doesn't know for sure but admits he wouldn't be surprised. When he leaves, Josh and Cassie wonder if there isn't more to this--it seems like a cover up.\n\n\nOn the airplane to Hawaii, Frank tells the family (minus Harley) that he's heard some news from the FBI.

After the phone call, Harley confronts Frank and Buzz demanding to know what the FBI found. Frank tells her they found Gus's bloody coat in the frozen lake. He sadly tells Harley that if Gus fell in the water, he wouldn't make it. Harley then calls the pilot and tells him to return home. She and Frank go to the crash site to find Mallet already there. They found Gus's coat in the ice. A desperate Harley tries to reason that he removed the coat to swim to shore, but Mallet reminds her that the lake was frozen over. He then shows her what else was found--Gus's wedding ring. Harley proclaims that Gus wouldn't have taken that off.
