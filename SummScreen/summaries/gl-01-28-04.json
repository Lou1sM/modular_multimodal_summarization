She lets Cassie hold Emma, and Cassie agrees to keep mum, saying that she would've done the same thing to keep her own baby safe. Cassie tries to convince Olivia to let Phillip in on the secret, but Olivia fears his mental state is too fragile for now.\n\n\nAt Towers, Edmund, Tammy, Joey and Sandy arrive for dessert and discussion about Romeo and Juliet. Edmund is distracted by his quest to find out if Cassie's baby is indeed alive. Tammy and Joey argue intensely about the play, but the underlying meaning is clear - Joey wants sex and Tammy wants romance. Joey storms off to the balcony, while Tammy bursts into tears and Edmund and Sandy sit in discomfort. Sandy departs to talk to Joey, and Edmund stays to counsel Tammy. Both give the two teens similar advice - stop pressing the other so much and just enjoy who they are. Tammy and Joey reconcile on the balcony, Sandy leaves, and a just-arrived Cassie joins Edmund. The two then interrupt Tammy and Joey's make-out session, and Cassie takes the twosome home while Edmund privately fields a call from Dax. Unfortunately, the news isn't good; Dax has finally located Cassie's doctor from that fateful night, but the good doctor is dead. Edmund is determined to get to the bottom of this ever-growing mystery.\n\n\nAt Michelle's, Carrie is confronted by Marina, Marah and Michelle. They accuse her of trying to kill Michelle, but Carrie merely scoffs. The three young women are no good to her dead. Carrie manages to convince Marina of her good intentions; however, Michelle isn't so sure and Marah is fed up. She leaves, declaring that she chooses to stick with her father.  Marah goes home to the museum, where she finds the tunnel door open. Sandy, who has come to make amends, surprises her. Marah suddenly realizes that her long-lost doll, Polly, has suddenly reappeared on her couch. She questions Sandy, but he is just as puzzled as she. He goes on to apologize to her because he realizes how unfair he's been, and promises to not stick his nose in her business.  He leaves, but Marah remains unsettled - who's been traveling through the tunnels and leaving her a long-lost toy?\n\n\nAt the Lewis home, Josh announces that he wants to spend the night with Reva. She can tell that something is going on with her husband and grows increasingly troubled by his tone. He acts as if this will be the last night they'll ever spend together. Josh makes oblique references to what he's about to do (i.e., confessing to Frank about Maryanne Caruthers) and hints that Reva will lose her trust and respect for him.  She tries to reassure him, and they end up in bed. Afterward, Josh is accosted outside by Billy, who informs him that someone tried to kill Michelle. Billy tries again to convince Josh out of confessing, stating that the mystery person is out for their daughters and Josh can't protect Marah when he's in prison. Billy states that the only way to end this nightmare is if the men get rid of the mystery person.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cassie, who still thinks of the baby she lost, can't help but feel protective of this child. She also feels an unexpected bond with Olivia. Cassie agrees to keep the baby's existence a secret, at least for now. Meanwhile, Edmund keeps up his pursuit of the facts surrounding Cassie's lost child. But her very real teenage daughter puts other demands on him, as Edmund and Sandy get caught up in Tammy and Joey's struggles with Romeo and Juliet \u0096 both on and off the stage. While they try to counsel the teenagers, Sandy is caught short by something Joey says and realizes he's been unfair to Marah. Marah, Marina and Michelle confront Carrie and wonder if she deliberately tried to harm Michelle. Carrie doesn't shy from their accusations and is able to bring Michelle and Marina back into the fold. When Marah returns to the Museum she gets a scare, but Sandy is there to make peace. Josh holds onto Reva and makes love to her for what he believes may be the last time. As he leaves for the police station, he encounters Billy who warns him that a threat may have been made on Michelle's life and Marah may be next. Josh's determination to confess is trumped by his desire to protect his daughter, at all costs.",
