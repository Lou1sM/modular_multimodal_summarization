But Josh said they needed to consider every possibility.  They couldn't understand how Jonathan got their phone number when he was in Switzerland.  Josh insisted that Marissa and Jonathan might not be speaking.  Cassie enters.  She wanted to know why Reva thought it was Jonathan.  Reva told Cassie that Marissa told him that he was adopted.  They explained the events leading up to their thoughts.  Reva told Cassie that Olivia told her that Jonathan got into trouble and was sent to boarding school because he wasn't getting along with his father.  Josh said the phone calls started about the same time that Jonathan found out.  But Cassie had her doubts.  Reva said she needed to leave and interview Alex Spaulding.  Reva and Josh exit.  The phone rang and Cassie answered it.  Cassie motioned for Josh to listen.  Whispering, he told her to keep this person on the line.  Cassie pretended to be Reva and asked why they were doing this to her.  Cassie told this person about Richard and how he couldn't breathe and how he suffered.  She said he didn't ask Cassie because he knew she couldnt watch him take his last breath.  She said that she (Reva) was the only person that could turn to.  The caller hung up.  Josh apologized that she had to go through that.  Cassie said it had to stop.  The phone rang.  Josh was told that the call was traced and the police were on the way to his place now.\n\n\nReva enters.  She told Josh and Cassie how nervous Alex was.  But Josh said he had to tell her something.  They explained what they did when the stalker called.  Josh answered the phone.  Josh told Reva they got him.  His name was Dale Hansen.  They said they found articles in his apartment pasted on the wall.  Reva said they could now sleep at nights.  They decided to celebrate with a bottle of champagne.  Cassie exits.\n\n\nSince it was so quite, Reva said she was bored.  But outside someone was looking in.\n\n\nAt the Spaulding mansion\n\nNolan escorted Edmund into the study. Alex was on the phone.  Nolan exits.  Alex wanted to know what he found out about the ring.  Edmund said he would get the ring for a price.  But she reminded him that he was on the payroll.  But he wanted her trust in what she was hiding.  Alex wanted him to swear that he wouldn't repeat what she was about to tell him.  She explained about a letter she received regarding some information that this person had to sell.  She found out that he had proof of something on the Spaulding family, so she paid him.  She decided to return to Springfield and find out herself.  Edmund said he had more questions and thought that what Roy Baker had on her could be damaging.  She said she was saying all she was going to say.  She wanted Edmund to find out about the ring since she thought it was the missing piece of a puzzle.  But he agreed to do it anyway since he liked her so much.  Reva enters.  Edmund exits.  Reva said she came on her own.  Alex said she wasn't going to answer any questions.  Reva reminded her that anything she had done didn't make sense.  Reva sensed there was something she wasn't telling anyone.  Alex told Nolan to show Reva the door.  Reva exits.  \n\n\nAt the Lighthouse\n\nMarah woke up to find Tony touching her face.  She said she was starving, so he brought her a fruit tray.  They decided they would like to stay at the lighthouse for the rest of their lives.  Marah said she wasn't going to give up on their relationship.  Reva asked Marah to stop by the lighthouse and check it out to see if the stalker left anything behind.  Marah agreed and they hung up.  Tony and Marah began to look for evidence the stalker had been there, but couldn't find anything.  Marah took Tony's shirt off.  They began to kiss passionately.  They made love.  Reva called Marah to tell her the news about the stalker.  \n\n\nAt Company\n\nHarley told Gus when she got up out of bed he was gone.  She told him that his mother's ring had a story.  Gus said he found the funeral director that buried Jane Doe, and his father paid for the funeral.  He thought that someone destroyed the autopsy.  Gus thought that maybe this woman was having an affair with his father.  He said they sent out an announcement of his arrival, which would mean that he was adopted.  Gus said if this was true, his life was a lie.  But Harley tried to convince him that he still belonged to his parents because they both loved him.  She felt his parents were trying to protect him.  He told her he didn't know what he would do without her.  Harley had to leave to go to the jewelers to get the ring appraised.  She told him she loved him.  Harley exits.  \n\n\nGus called the hospital to check on a patient Ray Baker.   He was told there was no change.  \n\n\nAt the jewelry store\n\nHarley asked the jeweler to appraise the ring while she took care of something else.  Harley exits.  Edmund enters.  He told the jeweler he was looking for something special.  The jeweler exits to retrieve some pieces of jewelry that Edmund may be interested in.  When he returned, he found Edmund looking at Harley's ring.  The jeweler told him that the ring wasn't for sale.  After writing something on a piece of paper, Edmund exits.  He called Alex and said he didn't get the ring.  He told her he saw it and needed her help.\n\n\nAt Cedars hospital\n\nGus said, \"Hi, Uncle Roy.\"  He said he wasn't going to leave until he woke up.\n\n\n",
