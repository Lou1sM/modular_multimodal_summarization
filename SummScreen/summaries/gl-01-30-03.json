He told him he knows that he was in with the Santos family and told him he knows about the Jane Doe and the safe deposit box.  He grabbed his head a few times and said how easy it would be to kill him and kept telling him to open his eyes.  He told him that he was going to make him pay when he found out what was in the safe deposit box.  When Gus walked out, Roy opened his eyes!  When Gus left Roy, he had his blood taken to have a DNA test ran on it.  When Gus showed up at Company looking for Harley, he wasn't looking well.  When Buzz noticed he was looking sick, Gus said he thought he was coming down with a \"bug.\"\n\n\nAlex was desperate to get a hold of Edmund to see if he got to the safe deposit box and was also dealing with Alan and Phillip arguing over Olivia.  Phillip called Olivia a fickle tramp and told Alan he could have her and that him and the kids were moving out.  Edmund finally showed up with a small brown envelope from the safe deposit box. There was a bracelet inside.  Harley went to pick up the appraisal on the ring owned by Gus's mom and found out it had no value but had a 3 digit number engraved on it.  Harley went to the safe deposit box and found it empty and knew Alexandra had something to do with it.  She went to see her and told Alexandra she knows she's behind the safe deposit box being empty.  Harley accused her of snooping around in Gus's past to gain more evidence for Phillip so she can't have Zach back.  Alexandra tried to defend her self and explain that was not why but Harley stormed out saying she'll never trust her or any of the Spaulding's again.   Harley was due to meet Phillip and Zach at the ice rink to skate.  When she got there, Phillip was talking on his cell phone and Zach saw Harley.  He ran to meet her and ran right in front of a car!\n\n\n",
