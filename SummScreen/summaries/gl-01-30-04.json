    "soap_central": "\n\nJeffrey's task force is skeptical about using so many civilians (Gus, Harley, and Reva via Dr. Langham) for their drug-busting operation. Jeffrey is sure about what he's doing and dismisses them. Dr. Langham expresses doubt about pressuring Reva to start re-using her psychic powers due to the stress in her life, but Jeffrey is adamant that the doctor should manipulate her to meet their objectives (and to also keep her in the dark about what he's doing). Jeffrey shows himself to be an \"end justifies the means\" kind of guy and is not above using threats, manipulation and intimidation to keep people in line. He's focused on busting up the drug operation by any means necessary. Jeffrey also wants Cassie tested for psychic ability, and Dr. Langham suggests that Marah be tested as well. Jeffrey agrees.\n\n\nAt Towers, Billy and Josh are looking over a map of the underground tunnels. Josh has changed his mind about confessing, as long as the girls remain in danger. Reva arrives, and Billy leaves so Josh can have some alone time with her. After discussing how much they miss each other, Reva asks Josh to move back in. However, Josh states that it's not yet time; he has a lot of loose ends to tie up. Reva understands and agrees to wait. Billy rejoins Josh after Reva leaves, and Josh takes the map to have a look around the tunnels.\n\n\nBeth and Lizzie also arrive at Towers, and after chatting with Billy they sit and try to take their minds off Olivia. However, Lizzie is clearly unhappy and Beth sends her home. Jeffrey arrives, and Beth joins him. A very wary Jeffrey is puzzled (since their affair ended badly), but Beth quickly gains the upper hand. She comes on to him, stating that she wasn't ready for a no-strings affair before but that she's more than ready now. She also quickly and accurately reads his feelings for Marah. Jeffrey is uncomfortable, and Beth tells him that she understands what he feels since she had a similar affair with a younger man (Bill). She states that Marah's youth, innocence, and talent all appeal to Jeffrey and he's not sure what to do.\n\n\nAt the museum, Marah and Marina discuss Carrie. Marina thinks they should trust her, but Marah remains unconvinced. Suddenly Marah sees her long-lost doll again and is spooked because she had put it away in a closet. She puts it away yet again, but it reappears in her sewing box. As she reaches in, a sharp object slashes her hand.\n\n\nGus and Harley are having a major fight regarding his decision to stay at Spaulding Enterprises. Each doesn't know that the other is doing spy work for Jeffrey. Harley is convinced that Gus is being sucked into the Spaulding black hole, and he's hurt that she thinks he's so easily manipulated. Zach, awakened by their yelling, comes down and the two adults are instantly embarrassed by their childish behavior. Gus explains that when two people love each other and they disagree, they sometimes do a lot of talking but no listening, which leads into each person talking louder but still not listening, until everybody is yelling.  He points out that it's important to apologize and to show the person love. After Gus puts Zach to bed, he and Harley kiss and make up. \n\n\nAt the Lewis house, Dr. Langham visits Reva. He presses her for an answer (re: if she's ready to pick up on her studies) and she agrees to continue their work. In their conversation, she mentions that she's usually able to read family members but that Sandy remains very closed to her. After the doctor leaves, Reva looks lovingly at the various photos of her family. She picks up a particularly attractive one of Josh. Suddenly, his face grows fuzzy and the picture crashes to the floor.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Harley is furious with Gus for deciding to stay on at Spaulding and for having had to find it out from someone else. Gus defends but he's unable to tell her the real reason he's staying that he's undercover for Jeffrey. Likewise, Harley's unable to tell him the real reason she wants him out of the company: she doesn't want him caught up in the dirty business she's investigating. Frustration mixed with anger and hurt makes for a volatile mix and they argue loudly as Zach happens onto the scene, upset that they are yelling at each other. Harley's the observer as Gus talks to Zach about it and she realizes he's only doing what he feels he must. She apologizes for trying to order him not to stay at the company. They make love but Harley's words haven't been a solace for Gus. Jeffrey reveals his last undercover operative to his federal cohorts: Christopher who is to help shepherd Reva and her talents into their investigation. But Christopher is clearly reluctant and tells Jeffrey he thinks she's had too unstable a life recently to risk harming her any further. Jeffrey encourages Christopher to try once more and Christopher goes to Reva trying to give her every out, but she wants to continue with their work. Meanwhile, Billy and Josh confer over the tunnels they believe are being used by the person pulling the stings with Marah, Michelle and Marina to uncover what happened to Maryanne Caruthers. Beth finds Jeffrey and confesses she's had an epiphany: he was right about her\u0096 she should have lived more in the moment and taken their affair for what it was \u0096 an affair. This catches Jeffrey off-guard who is in the midst of trying to get Marah off his mind. As he wishes what Beth is saying to be true, they make love one more time. Meanwhile, Marah experiences a series of spooky moments when her childhood doll that she keeps trying to put away reappears without any explanation. She puts the doll away in her closet only to find it again in her desk drawer. She reaches for it and pulls back she's been cut, badly.",
