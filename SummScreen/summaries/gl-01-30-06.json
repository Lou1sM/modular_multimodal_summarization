Alan-Michael leaves for Dinah's. When he arrives, Dinah informs him that the officials believe Gus and Alan have died after breaking through the ice in the lake while trying to seek help. Alan-Michael mutters, \"Poor Harley.\" Dinah tells him she knows Alan-Michael wasn't close to his brother, Gus, and was estranged from his father, Alan, but she knows he must be saddened. At least Harley has her family around her. Under his breath, Alan-Michael says, \"Marina,\" and leaves Dinah's as she's telling him she's in crisis mode. \n\n\nAt the crash site, Harley clings at straws saying the coat may not be Gus' - anything could have happened that keeps him alive. Mallet insists that Harley look at the ring found in the coat pocket. When she sees the inscription she breaks down, but insists Gus could still be alive. She tells Mallet that Gus is the only man who has ever come through for her and he will again. She takes the ring, saying Gus will want it when he returns home \n\n\nWhen Alan-Michael arrives at Company, he is met by Buzz. He acknowledges that while Alan-Michael has lost his brother and his father, he needs to know Harley is going to need his help. Harley arrives, telling Alan-Michael that she's been looking for him because the quarterly reports need to get out, business as usual. Alan-Michael questions her priorities and Harley replies, \"What else is there to talk about?\" Buzz takes Harley aside and says that while he's the last person in the world to tell her to give up hope, certain arrangements should be made for the children's sake. Harley replies that they will all feel stupid after burying the guy and he shows up a week later. After Buzz leaves to answer the phone, Harley tells Alan-Michael, \"You didn't know your brother.\" He replies, \"I like what I know so far.\" Harley describes how Gus was not only always the funniest person in the room, but also the kindest. She's upset that she finds herself talking about him like he is dead. Alan-Michael hugs her and tells her they'll all get through this like a family. Marina looks on. \n\n\nAlan-Michael sees Marina and tells her he'd been looking for her. She takes him outside and kisses him, telling him she saw how he was with Harley. Harley doesn't trust many people but she does trust him. Inside Company, Buzz tells Harley he's going to set up her old room and she will be staying with them for the night. \n\n\nAt Josh's, Cassie and he are going over date book entries of Cassie's that outline events Richard and she attended. Cassie says Josh's F.B.I. friend gave them no information other than there could be a cover-up involved. Josh says there are ways to get around the government. He brings in two computer hackers who once tried to hack into the Lewis Construction database. The hackers have broken into many sites without being caught. Josh says they have the ability to tap into government sites, possibly getting information on Jeffrey. When Cassie asks if it's a crime, Josh replies, \"Yes!\" Cassie says she's in, absolutely. \n\n\nWhen the hackers show up, they let Josh and Cassie know how much information they already have on them. Josh tells them their mission is to crack the C.I.A. security system and extract information that is classified. The hackers agree but let Josh know if he isn't on the level, they'll hack into him, as they'll be committing several felonies. After the hackers leave, Josh tells Cassie that although the hackers might look into their cable bills for fun, he feels they can trust them. Cassie says she feels like \"him,\" Jeffrey, for doing what they are doing. Later, Josh is staring at a computer screen with photos of Richard and Jeffrey. \n\n\nMallet returns to Dinah's room after having been with Harley at the crash site. He is visibly shaken and Dinah caringly sends him off to a warm bath. He is filled with remorse as he thinks about Harley's suffering. Dinah tells him she understands his feelings of loss for Harley as well as the feelings of loss he must have for his partner. Mallet tells Dinah that he came to know he could count on Gus, just like he had come to know he could count on Dinah. Dinah told Mallet no one had ever told her they could count on her before. They kiss. Later, Mallet, dressed, kisses a sleeping Dinah awake, and tells her he has to go out for some air. \n\n\nAt Company earlier, Jeffrey is having a flashback to Cassie and him making love (as he was posing as Richard) at her insistence. Tammy brings him back to reality, wanting to talk about her mom. She tells Jeffrey that she loved Richard as a dad and the love her mom had for him was sacred. Jeffrey tells her it still is, just as Cassie's love for Tammy is still true. They decide to go to the farm house to see Cassie, but she's not there. When Jeffrey questions Tammy about why she's not angry with him, she tells him that he was there to protect her dad - Jeffrey had a job to do. When she says Richard was truly a Prince, Jeffrey agrees. Tammy tells Jeffrey a story about Richard telling her to stand up to a bully in school by staring her down, but if that didn't work, to give her a good punch! Tammy acknowledges it didn't sound at all like Richard. What does Jeffrey think? Jeffrey says he didn't know Richard well enough to know if it sounded like him or not. He asks her how the bully thing worked out, and she said she stared the bully down and it worked. She says, \"Just like you...I mean, Richard, said it would.\" Tammy leaves, saying she will call her mom later. \n\n\nCassie returns to the farm house, finding Jeffrey looking at photos of RJ and him. Cassie remarks how they look like a real family. Jeffrey tells Cassie how just as she has precious memories of Richard - he wants her to have them of him, as Jeffrey, with her. He flashes back to being in bed with Cassie in San Cristobel , and then sweeps her up to carry her to bed. \n\n\nOn the Spaulding jet, Coop is agitated and worried about both Harley and Lizzie, saying Lizzie really liked her Uncle Gus and her Grandfather Alan. She says she doesn't want to deal with the outside world, but Coop insists they do. He sings her praises about how she's become so independent from her family. As he goes on, she thinks, \"I'm a fraud, I'm none of these things.\" When he's finished, she says, \"If you think I'm amazing, I guess I am.\" They leave the plane and go to CO2 where they run into Sandy and Ava. Lizzie and Ava spar about Lizzie's insecurities about her relationship with Coop. At the same time Jon has been questioning the sincerity of Sandy's caring about Marina and her family. Sandy tells Jon that his paranoia about Sandy will only make Jon look bad and Sandy look good. \n\n\nTammy and Jon run into one another at Company and talk about how others want them apart. Jonathan says one day it won't be like that. Tammy says Jon's powers of persuasion got her back in school, although he knows it was really Sandy. Jon knows that as a sophomore advisor, Sandy will be in close, daily contact with Tammy. \n\n\nAgain outside Company, Marina tells Alan-Michael he was really great with Harley. She asks him to invite her to his big Valentine's Day party at Spaulding; she had seen a flyer about it. She says that even better, invite anyone and everyone who loves Harley. Alan-Michael asks her that if Valentine's Day is for lovers, as a new widow, Harley might not like it-why remind her of \"what's lost.\" Marina says it would be a reminder to Harley of all those who love and support her. This could be a night \"all about Harley.\" Alan-Michael mutters, \"In a way, it already is.\" Marina asks, \"What was that?\" Buzz comes out and asks, \"Has anyone seen Harley?\" \n\n\nWe move to Harley at a bar with several shot glasses turned upside down. She says to the bartender, \"I'll have one more, no, two. It's time to make a toast.\" Gus appears to her and says, \"Sounds good to me.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Since the agency that Jeffrey worked for won't help them, Josh calls in some computer programmers to hack into the system after Cassie worries that since Jeffrey posed as Richard on important events, he may have posed the day of their wedding. Tammy talks to Jeffrey and offers to talk to Cassie on his behalf. She also remembers a memory of her father that seemed unlike him and hints to Jeffrey that she thinks it was him. Later she tells Jonathan that she has gotten back into school and thanks him for what he did, not knowing it was Sandy who actually got her back in. Marina and Buzz return to Springfield and tell Ava and Sandy the news about Gus. Sandy offers his condolences and help. Jonathan seeing this warns Marina that Sandy is only out to get Tammy back. Sandy tells Jonathan about his new job helping sophomores like Tammy at school. Dinah tells Alan-Michael about Gus and then later comforts Mallet when he feels as if there is nothing he can do. Buzz asks Alan-Michael to continue helping Harley out at Spaulding and Harley later comes to talk to A-M. Realizing that although they were brothers they barely knew each other, she starts to talk to A-M about Gus. Marina sees them and later thanks A-M with a kiss and suggests he throws a Valentines day party to cheer Harley up, unknowing that that is the day he plans on overthrowing her from Spaulding.",
