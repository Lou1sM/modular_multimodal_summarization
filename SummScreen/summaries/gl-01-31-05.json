Coop is pacing behind them, wanting to know how Frank can stand himself after locking up his sister. Buzz and Harley assure him Frank was only doing his job and it's killing him in the process. Buzz leaves to take care of Zack and Jude. Harley asks Coop if he knows anything about Lizzie's whereabouts the night Phillip was shot. Coop says he was with her when Phillip kidnapped her. Harley is upset for what Lizzie must have been going through at the hands of her own father. Coop says he has a date with Lizzie later and he will get any information he can. He leaves as Beth arrives to tell Harley she has sprung her from jail. Harley thinks she's joking, but Beth tells her it was the least she could do since Harley kept quiet about her plan to leave with Phillip and the children. Beth tells Harley to do whatever she must to find Phillip's killer - no matter who it is. \n\n\nAt the record store, the police arrive to arrest Reva and Jonathan for breaking and entering. Reva is shocked to discover Jonathan lied to her about knowing the owner and having access to the store after hours. Reva covers for her son by telling the police she is doing a behind-the-scenes story for WSPR about the lack of security at Springfield businesses. The cops are skeptical until Reva promises to mention their quick response and use their faces to portray 'Springfield's Finest.' Jonathan watches the exchange with amusement. Once outside, he commends Reva for getting them off the hook. She attempts to berate him for lying but is soon laughing as he makes faces at her. \n\n\nAt the farmhouse, Edmund answers the phone and discovers Cassie has lied about going to the doctor for a flu checkup - she is going in for a pregnancy test. Cassie lies again and tells Edmund she is worried if she really is pregnant, the baby may not be completely normal. Edmund guesses she is concerned their baby could be like Jonathan, though he has no idea that Cassie's real concern is the baby could actually be Jonathan's. She agrees to let him go with her to the hospital. Once there, they find Reva and Jonathan waiting to see the doctor. Cassie tries to leave, but Edmund demands to know what is going on between her and Reva. Before they can explain, Jonathan tells Edmund it's his fault because of what happened the night before their wedding. Cassie is tense expecting to be exposed for the night she spent with Jonathan. Instead of telling the truth about his night with Cassie, Jonathan lies. He says the sisters are upset because he crashed the bachelorette party and Reva defended him even though she knew Cassie was upset about it. A nurse approaches and tells Cassie the doctor is ready for her. Once Edmund and Cassie leave, Reva tells Jonathan that Edmund must never discover the truth about Cassie. \n\n\nAt Towers, Coop and Lizzie are having dinner when the maitre d' tells Coop he has a phone call. In the hallway, Coop finds Harley who is there to tell him she is out of jail and to forget what she said earlier about grilling Lizzie for information. Coop says it's too late; he's already started asking her questions. Lizzie watches them and starts digging her nails into her arm. She pretends she didn't see Coop talking to Harley when he returns to the table. Lizzie doesn't give up any information about Phillip but turns the conversation to Gus instead. She tells Coop that Gus will stop at nothing to clear Harley. Coop thinks Lizzie is overreacting and tells her Gus wouldn't do anything to hurt her. Lizzie shows Coop the scratches on her arm and asks, \"Does this look like nothing\"? \n\n\nHarley goes to her office and stares at the board of suspects in Phillip's murder. She imagines the photos of Lizzie and Beth are speaking to her. She is crying when Buzz arrives and embraces her. Buzz tells his daughter she did what she had to do. Harley realizes he believes she is the one who shot Phillip. Buzz gives her plane tickets for her and the boys. He tells her he has already checked it out, and even if the cops find out where she went, it's a place where there is no extradition. Harley takes the tickets. \n\n\nHolly continues to feel guilty about Sebastian's death. Ross tells her she has to get over it because Blake is getting suspicious. Holly imagines she sees Sebastian at the bar. She approaches him and grabs a total stranger. When she returns to her table, beneath her purse is one of Roger's gold coins. \n\n\n",
