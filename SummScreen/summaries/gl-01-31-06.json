She's even been named employee of the month. Lizzie is confused but plays along. The boutique owner leaves and Lizzie spies Quinn. She walks over to talk to him. She finds out he made sure the boutique owner would play along should the time ever arise when Lizzie would need an alibi about work. Lizzie suspects that Ava set up the meeting with the boutique owner to trip her up and expose her as a liar in order to get to Coop. Ava and Lizzie discuss this strange event. Lizzie tells Ava she has nothing to hide and apologizes for suggesting she was after Coop. Ava apologizes for seeming like she is grilling Lizzie. Coop arrives to help Ava close CO2.

Josh tries to cover what he's really doing, but Olivia lets him know she's aware it has something to do with Cassie. Olivia asks Josh to go skating to have some fun. Josh admits that he can't remember the last time he had fun. Olivia tells Josh he's always so busy helping everyone in his family that he never does anything just for himself. Josh senses Olivia is right. He heads out the door to make a call, promising that upon his return he and Olivia will go skating. Olivia puts on some romantic music as Billy walks in the door behind her. Billy suggests Olivia might have been after Josh the whole time. He says she could have saved Billy and Bill a lot of trouble if she'd just gone after Josh and left them alone. They get into a heated discussion about Olivia's pushing Billy off the wagon. Billy lets Olivia know that Josh wouldn't be too happy with her if he found out she was the reason Billy was drinking again. Olivia asks Billy if he's threatening her. He says a \"sober\" Billy would forgive her for what she's done, and she'd better hope he can stay sober so her secret won't get out. Josh walks back in at the tail end of their conversation. He wonders what it is they think he wouldn't be happy about if he were to find out. Billy and Olivia cover up their conversation topic. Billy leaves. Josh tells Olivia he's just left a message for Cassie telling her that she can continue her search for information on Jeffrey without him. He kisses Olivia and steps out of the room to get ready for skating. \n\n\nFrank, carrying a box of Gus' belongings, runs into Mallet outside of Company.

Frank convinces Mallet to take back his badge and \"fly solo\" until he's ready for a new partner. Mallet agrees. \n\n\nHarley is sitting in the bar downing shots. A strange man approaches her, but in her tipsy state she sees him as Gus. She dances with him, flirts and even suggests that he take her home.
