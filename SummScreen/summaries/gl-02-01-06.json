Inside, Gus is in bed asleep in what appears to be a small, dark room. \n\n\nIn black and white flashback, Gus is waiting in the limo for Alan to come out of the courthouse. He flicks on the radio and listens to a snippet of news about Alan's release. Flipping channels, \"Queen of Hearts,\" sung by Juice Newton, is playing. Back to the present, Gus opens his eyes. His right leg is badly injured. He drifts back to sleep. The visitor enters the room and covers Gus' leg with the blanket. In flashback, Gus is sitting in the limo while \"Auld Lang Syne\" is playing on the radio. Gus looks at the photo of and Harley and him at their wedding. He tells Harley he's not going to let Alan harm her and then he kisses the photo. Alan gets into the limo, triumphant at his release. He tells the driver to get going. Gus turns to him and says, \"Anything you say, Dad!\" Alan tries to reason with him, but Gus drives off recklessly. In the present, the visitor tears off the page for January on a wall calendar near Gus' bed. The days have all been crossed off. The visitor leaves. Gus's eyes open and he calls out to the visitor to wait, but he is unable to stay awake. \n\n\nHarley comes out of the bathroom in Mallet's hotel room. Her hair and camisole top are soaking wet. She is screaming because Mallet put her face under water to sober her up. Harley complains she wasn't that drunk and says she remembers everything, although Mallet disagrees about her degree of sobriety. To show she isn't still under the influence, Harley tells Mallet she remembers all that happened at the crash site. She asks Mallet if he believes Gus' body is at the bottom of the lake. Rather than answer her directly, Mallet tells Harley it doesn't matter what he thinks, but he'd like to have Gus back. Harley tells Mallet it matters to her what he thinks. She says she believes Gus is gone and it's why she got drunk. She needed to not think about it for a while, but she knows he's not coming back. \n\n\nGus wakes up but is blurry eyed. He sees the calendar on the wall, drags his injured body out of the bed, tries to stand up but falls to the floor in severe pain. In flashback, he is driving the limo fast and arguing with his father about what he intends to do. He's planning to take Alan somewhere to force him to sign a confession to Phillip's murder. Following which, Gus will return him to Springfield and prison. Alan asks Gus how Harley feels about his plan. Gus tells him not to worry about Harley as she has the support of her brother and father. Alan points out that she also has Mallet; they could just pick up where they left off. Gus pulls a gun on Alan and as he tries to grapple it away, the car veers dangerously off the road. \n\n\nBack in the present, Gus looks at the wound on his leg. He calls out for Alan. Sitting on the bed, Gus looks around the room from walls to door, door to walls and back again. He works out that one of the walls was once a door and mutters that it's his way out. \n\n\nMallet suggests that Harley gets out of her wet clothes and hands her a robe. As Harley changes behind Mallet, she declares she doesn't feel dizzy any more and thanks him. When she jokes with Mallet about whether he picked up her bar bill, he says her \"friend\" probably did. Harley is embarrassed to learn she almost left the bar with the stranger, but does remember dancing with him. Mallet tells her that she thought the guy was Gus. He tells her she also thought he was Gus when she kissed him and that was why he threw her in the shower. Harley tells Mallet she really knew the stranger wasn't Gus but was still trying to keep her mind shut down. Mallet tells her that he understands and she's welcome to use his shower, or crash on his couch any time, but sooner or later she's going to have to learn to wake each morning and deal with the day. \n\n\nGus clears the area near the wall and breaks a chair to use the leg to make a hole in the wall. He tells himself he'll get out and be home in time for dinner. \n\n\nIn flashback, Gus tries to pull himself out of the wrecked car so he can help Alan. He loses consciousness. The drifter comes along and takes Gus' wallet and cell phone. In his subconscious, Gus questions what's happening. Mallet appears as the drifter and tells Gus he's taking everything that belongs to him. \n\n\nBack in the present, Gus breaks through the plaster wall. He finds a room similar to his. There's a figure in bed. It's Alan, fast asleep. \n\n\nThe scene flashes back to the crash site. Alan is standing a little away from Gus, who has a gun pointed at Alan. They argue about Alan leaving to get help. Gus refuses to let him leave, but Alan tells him that he won't allow his son to die. Gus is doubtful because of what Alan did to Phillip. But Alan vows to never do something like that again. He's Gus' father, loves him and doesn't want both of them to stay out there and freeze to death. Gus suggests it might be preferable since that way Harley will be safe. After Alan leaves, Gus wonders out loud \"What have I done?\" \n\n\nHarley is pensive and wonders how she will go on without Gus. She asks if she can't just get drunk again. She worries about having to face the reality of Gus being gone and how she will tell the kids. She tells Mallet she doesn't know who she is without Gus. She has become a better person because of him. Mallet tells her to keep wearing Gus' wedding band and when she needs a reminder, to look at it. She can draw from his strength or look at it when the kids ask about him. Harley's sadness turns to bitterness as she tells Mallet she believes Gus' wedding ring also represents broken promises and vows that he threw away. She questions what happened to his promises to love, cherish and protect her and the boys. Mallet tries to persuade Harley that Gus was trying to protect her. But Harley calls his actions irresponsible and reckless. Mallet points out that Gus was just trying to do the best he could but Harley doesn't buy that idea. She declares that trying to do your best doesn't mean you hurt somebody as much as they could ever be hurt. \n\n\nGus helps Alan out of bed and hopes he has the keys to the door. Alan is confused and wonders where they are. Gus tells him they are in trouble and asks if Alan has any idea how they got where they are. Alan replies that all he knows is that Gus kidnapped him, they had an accident in the snow and Gus was injured. He recalls leaving to get some water and then he was hit on the head. Alan tries to help Gus reach a vent high in the wall but he cannot make it because of his injury. When they run out of ideas Alan suggests the only thing they have left is each other. Gus is not amused and suggests a bullet to his head might be better. Alan tells him they need each other to survive. \n\n\nThe scene switches to flashback. Alan returns with water and after tasting it, Gus drinks. Alan tries to cajole Gus into standing up so they can get away from the crash site but he is unable to pull himself up and collapses back against the car. He looks up and sees Alan has pulled the gun on him this time. Alan tells him that he's not going back to prison and Gus questions whether he came back to shoot him. Alan complains that none of his three sons cares about him. Gus tells him it's because none of them are good enough for Alan. Gus adds that he would love to have a father he could trust. Alan thinks he hears someone and calls out for help. He's hit on the head. \n\n\nBack in the little room, Gus reminds Alan they are in a mess because of his need to ruin Harley and his marriage. He promises Alan that he will get his confession. The two bicker about helping each other. Alan wants a 'thank you' from Gus for coming back with the water. He tells Gus he came back because he loves him. Gus tells him to \"cut the emotional crap!\" Gus is listening at the door and hears music. It's the \"Queen of Hearts\" again. He and Alan both call out to whoever is behind the door. \n\n\nBack at the Beacon, Harley is still bitter about Gus going off. She feels he's cheated her out of their life together after she went through so much for him so they could be together. Mallet tries to speak up for Gus but Harley refuses to listen. She tells Mallet that Gus betrayed her and abandoned her. Mallet promises her it will be all right. Soothed, Harley tells Mallet that she really loves Gus and she thought she would see him every day for the rest of her life. Mallet tells her maybe she will see him again one day. Comforted by this, Harley kisses Mallet and they hug. They kiss again and once again. Mallet removes his shirt and wonders out loud what they are doing. Harley removes her robe, tells Mallet she doesn't know, pushes him down on the bed and lies on top of him. They kiss passionately. \n\n\nGus recognizes the song and thinks someone is coming. He motions to Alan to stand behind the door and when whoever it is comes in they will jump him. The sounds of the music fades away and whoever it is appears to be leaving. Alan calls and offers money for them to be released. Gus questions Alan's idea to bribe someone at a time like this and says he will never change. Gus calls out and asks to make a phone call to his wife who's probably worried about him. When there is no response, Gus comments, \"This is not good!\" \n\n\nOn the other side of the door, a figure is standing looking at the lock. She pushes back the hood of her coat and turns her face to us. It's Beth. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While Juice Newton's \"Queen of Hearts\" plays in the background Gus wakes up in his \"prison\". He remembers the car crash, starting with when he picked Alan up. He told him that he was going to force him, by gunpoint, to sign a confession and then drive him back to Springfield where he would be put in jail. Alan refuses and when he grabbed for the gun, wound up crashing the car. Gus is left upside down and pinned in the car while Alan was unconscious in the back. A homeless man came and stole Gus's wallet, but Gus in his state imagines the guy to be Mallet stealing everything from him. Alan woke up and left to get some water and came back for Gus. A stranger cloaked from head to toe came up to the men and then that was the last thing Gus remembered till waking up. In the present, Gus breaks through a door to find Alan in an adjoining room. He spots medicine and realizes that someone is holding them prisoner. They try to escape but Gus's leg wound and Alan's inability to move his left arm hinders them. They hear a noise and try to talk with whoever is holding them hostage but they get no answer. The mystery person locks the door and leaves, dropping her hood to reveal it is Beth. Back in Springfield Mallet sobers up a drunk Harley and fills her in on her actions. Harley says she knows that Gus is gone and Mallet asks her to let him help her through this. He comforts her, which leads to a kiss, and she pushes him down on the bed.",
