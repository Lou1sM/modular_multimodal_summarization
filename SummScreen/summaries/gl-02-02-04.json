When Marah called, fearful she was being stalked, Beth urged her former lover to go to her. After he left, Alexandra tried to persuade Beth to help her get rid of Olivia. Beth was reluctant but agreed to go with Alex to question Phillip about his motives for getting married.\n\n\nAt Ravenwood, Phillip was hesitant to sign the document placed in front of him, but Olivia persuaded him to sign without legal counsel. When Beth and Alexandra arrived, Olivia said Phillip didn't want to see them, and as his wife, she had every right to keep them from going into his room. Beth was convinced Olivia was dangerous.\n\n\nAt the museum, Jeffrey dressed Marah's cut from the razor blade in her doll and demanded to know about her stalker. Marah explained the doll's mysterious appearance after so many years and mentioned Michelle's accident. She thought the two incidents were connected but had no proof. Jeffrey suggested a private investigator. He promised he'd let nothing happen to her.\n\n\nMarah persuaded him to stay for coffee. Alone, Jeffrey called Carrie's machine, demanding that in order for their deal to stand, the three girls had to remain unharmed. Otherwise, \"there will be hell to pay.\"\n\n\nOutside Company, Frank and Rick had a heart-to-heart. Rick was worried about Ed. Frank sympathized; when Buzz had returned to Springfield, it had taken Frank some time to adjust to having his father back in his life. He suggested that was all Rick needed too.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Ed's bottle of pills was empty. He was surprised to find Mel in his exam room, wanting a checkup for her queasiness. Ed refused to help -- there was a rule about treating family. Mel wanted the best for her baby and insisted her father-in-law humor her. Ed's vision blurred as he was about to take her blood. He couldn't do it.\n\n\nMel noticed Ed's shaky hands, but he said it was the effects of a long day. He left the room and told a nurse to page Mel's doctor and Rick -- he was \"off-duty until further notice.\" Rick joined Mel, who assured him they had done the right thing. \"We needed to know,\" he said. Ed needed help, and Mel thought that way, he would think that leaving the hospital had been his own decision. However, Rick knew his father better than she did.\n\n\nJealous of Cassie's relationship with Edmund, Tammy decided she needed a makeover in order to attract the right kind of guy. She wanted magic, romance, Shakespeare -- all that Joey lacked. Cassie admitted the glamour was nice, but she was with Edmund because he was a good person, not because he was a former prince. She urged her daughter not to change; she would find her prince just the way she was.\n\n\nLizzie entered, still upset over her dad's marriage. Cassie saw how angry Lizzie became at the mention of Olivia's name. However, Lizzie promised she wouldn't act on her anger. She said she was dealing with it. Unconvinced, Cassie called Olivia, finally understanding why she had kept her baby a secret. She warned Olivia to be careful.\n\n\nLizzie told Tammy that she'd lied to Cassie -- she hated Olivia, and her family wouldn't let Olivia get away with marrying Phillip. Tammy was sick of hearing Lizzie's problems. She'd rather concentrate on her own, starting with a new wardrobe. Lizzie snarled that nothing ever happened to Tammy but quickly took it back, apologizing.\n\n\nTammy admitted Lizzie was right. In the hallway, an angry Lizzie told Cassie that she'd thought she could count on her friends, but Tammy was too caught up in her own problems to care about Lizzie's. Cassie entered her hotel room and found Tammy ogling herself in the mirror, wearing one of her mom's sexy black dresses.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marah's been cut, by the doll placed in her desk drawer, but further examination reveals it was a razor blade she stored there with other sewing equipment. Still, she's spooked, suspecting Carrie, and she calls Jeffrey in a panic. She regrets it almost immediately and tells him not to come over. Jeffrey arrives, Marah is backtracking like crazy but Jeffrey sees that she's scared. She talks around the subject of Carrie, knowing she can't be completely truthful \u0096 but Jeffrey, who's already met with Carrie, thinks he knows what's going on. Jeffrey calls Carrie and puts her on notice to leave Marah and the other girls alone. Olivia has papers that she wants Phillip to sign. Olivia gets a call from Cassie, warning her to watch out for Lizzie. On the heels of the call, Olivia gets a visit from Alex and Beth who want to see Phillip. Olivia lies, telling them Phillip doesn't want to see them. Ed gets a shock when Mel complains she's not feeling well and asks him to treat her. Ed, trying to draw blood, finds himself too shaky to handle the syringe when it's his grandchild's health on the line. He quits the hospital on the spot. Meanwhile, Rick and Mel are relieved that their plan worked. Tammy is determined to change her look to attract more \"mysterious and romantic\" men \u0096 like Edmund. Cassie believes she's talked her out of it but when she returns home, Tammy has been transformed and not for the better.",
