Fearing someone has targeted Marah, he rounds up Billy, Buzz and Alan and they head over to Ed's house. The men make plans to head back into the tunnels to find the person who has been pulling the girls' strings behind the scenes. Alan wants Buzz to be his representative, to do what's necessary in those tunnels and to keep a close watch on the Lewis brothers. Frank pays Reva a visit and voices concerns about Josh.
