When Phillip asked WHY she was moving out, she said he obviously didn't know her and reiterated she's not staying with Alan.  They started to argue but Olivia said they shouldn't be fighting against each other and that they should be fighting FOR each other.  Phillip told her that he doesn't want to be the kind of man he's become...one who would sleep with his father's wife and that if Alan did indeed intercept the letter, he was only trying to fight for his wife. Olivia couldn't believe he was showing sympathy for his dad and doubt that he kept the letter from him.  When Phillip left, Nolan came in with the mail and let it slip that he handles ALL the mail.  She questioned him and could tell he knew what had happened to the letter she sent for Phillip and threatened him that she would press charges for tampering with the mail if he didn't tell Phillip the truth about Alan getting the letter.  She couldn't wait to get to Phillip to tell him she had proof of Alan taking the letter.\n\n\nBeth and Frank were at having dinner together and Frank asked Beth out on a date!  Beth declined saying she just was not ready for that.\n\n\nHarley and Mel were at the airport trying to stop Roy Baker from getting transferred.  They were too late but found a piece of paper that was dropped off Roy's stretcher.  On the piece of paper was the name Gina.  Gus was on his way to Chicago to find information on the \"Jane Doe\" and ran into Harley.  She lied to him and said she was only there to see him off to Chicago!  Mel was totally confused as to why Harley would lie to Gus.  Harley explained to Mel the whole story about Gus...his dad, Roy, the dead \"Jane Doe\", Alexandra, and told Mel she had to keep it quiet.  She was afraid if she gave this name to Gus that he would harass Alexandra for information and that would upset her, which would upset Phillip.  She said she loved Gus but her son came first.\n\n\nWhile Gus was in Chicago, he found the deed to the apartment his mother lived in and it was owned by Miguel Santos.\n\n\nDanny and Cassie were discussing Bill working on the Towers project.  Danny said he could work with Bill but Cassie felt they should talk to Josh about getting someone else.  At the hospital, Bill and Michelle got into a little argument about it because Michelle felt that Bill shouldn't take the project.  Bill went to see Danny about it and found out he's in partnership with Cassie.  He could sense a connection between the two.   Bill didn't commit to doing the job and told Danny he needed time to think about it before agreeing to the job.  When Bill returned to Michelle and gave her the news about Danny and Cassie being partners,  Michelle was upset that Danny didn't discuss it with her.  Bill asked if the two of them had to discuss every little thing they did together and of course Michelle said \"no\" but you could see she was not happy about the news.\n\n\n",
