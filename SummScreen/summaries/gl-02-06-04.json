    "tvmega_recap": "Cassie agrees to join Reva and Christopher to verify if she has psychic powers. Jeffrey's unexpected presence presents a challenge but Cassie plunges into the experiment. Cassie proves not to have the power but Marah arrives to be tested. For her, Jeffrey's presence is more than a challenge; it's a visceral reminder of the feelings she has for him. By the end of the experiment, her psychic skills remain unresolved. Josh, Billy and Buzz plan to go into the tunnel to find the person they believe to be using and threatening their daughters and granddaughter. Buzz, off his earlier conversation with Alan, has not come empty-handed but has brought along a weapon for self- protection. At the same time, Marina gets a call from Carrie summoning her to her room and giving her directions through the same maze of tunnels. Without realizing they are on separate paths, Marina makes her way towards Carrie's while the three men search the tunnel. The walls being to crumble, and Marina suspects that Carrie has lured her underground to trap her. The walls then collapse and Marina is trapped beneath the debris. At the Spaulding board meeting, Olivia has arrived armed with Phillip's proxy and power of attorney. At first, Alan and Alex try to block her attempt to take Phillip's seat on the board.",
