Sandy admits to Tammy that he isn't taking her back to the farm and tells her to call Jonathan. He instead takes her to meet Nicole who says she is his girlfriend. When Jonathan meets up with them he tells Sandy he found Tammy's stuff and Sandy just laughs that Nicole is a fill in until he gets Tammy back. Jonathan takes Tammy to see what Sandy still has of hers, but Sandy is too quick and boxes it all up and pretends he was bringing it back to her. Cassie insists that Jeffrey tell her all of the times he posed as Richard. He tells her that he fell in love with her while pretending to be the prince. This doesn't phase Cassie until he brings Dinah by who tells her that Jeffrey used to pretend that she was Cassie while having sex with her. The kids ask Frank about Gus and Beth saves him, he thanks her for helping out and she says that it is a shame the kids are always the ones who get put in the middle. Frank is impressed later when he runs into Dinah who says she isn't jealous at all of Harley and Mallet's friendship. Mallet tells Harley that he can't let what happened between them go, and wants to know if there is any possibility of a future with them. She says that she can't replace Gus and tells him to go and be happy with Dinah. She then tells the kids that Gus isn't coming back. Mallet finds Dinah outside of a store where the clerk has accused her of shoplifting. He claims that as a cop he will take care of it and picks her up and carries her away, again."
