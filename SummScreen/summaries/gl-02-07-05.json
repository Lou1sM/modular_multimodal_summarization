Danny tells her she has the wrong man - he's out of that business. Harley insists that he knows some people who would be willing to lean on certain jurors and she will pay for their trouble. Danny repeats that he has left that life far behind and tells Harley she is better than that. Marina arrives and wants to know what's going on and Harley tells her Danny just passed the test. Danny is surprised when Harley admits she was only testing Danny to see if he could be persuaded to resort to his old ways. Marina is embarrassed that Harley tried to set Danny up. Harley is apologetic but tells Marina that if she goes to jail, Marina will play an even bigger part of her children's lives and she had to be able to trust Danny. Once Harley leaves, Marina tells Danny she wants to end whatever it is they have going on between them, because she doesn't know where she stands with him and she doesn't want to be the rebound girl. Danny tells Marina she is not, but he likes the way he feels when he is with her. Marina says she feels the same. They agree to see where the new relationship will lead them and seal it with a kiss. \n\n\nAt Farley's Gus finds Lizzie at the bar and tells her he has been looking for her. Lizzie tries to leave, but Gus wants information about Lizzie's involvement in her father's death. Lizzie becomes angry and tells him he is either too stupid or too stubborn to see that Harley will soon be rotting behind bars for killing her father. Gus grabs Lizzie by the arm, screams that she is a snot-nosed brat and tells her he will get the information he needs if he has to beat it out of her. Coop arrives in time to hear Gus' threat and pulls Lizzie to him. Lizzie leaves to splash water on her face and Gus warns Coop that Lizzie is a master at committing crimes and covering them up. Gus prepares to leave but tells Coop to stay out of his way. Lizzie returns and thanks Coop for being the only one who understands her. She drops her purse on the floor and tenses when she notices her journal is missing. Coop asks if she's okay, but she calms and tells him she must have left it in her room. She invites Coop to dinner at Towers, but he declines saying he has something to take care of. \n\n\nAt the Spaulding mansion, Coop climbs into Lizzie's bedroom window in order to search for her journal. He hides in the closet when he hears Lizzie in the hallway giving orders to a maid. Lizzie enters her room, but dashes out again after forgetting to tell the maid something. Coop sees an opportunity to leave and begins to climb out of the window when Lizzie walks in and assumes he is entering. He tells her he needed to see her. They begin to kiss and Coop fakes a cough to get Lizzie to leave the room. Once Lizzie leaves the room for water, he pries open a box and finds a bloody shard of glass hidden in the bottom.\n\n\nIn the parking lot at Farley's, Reva is eyeing the damage done to the new car Jonathan bought her for her. Jonathan, breathing heavy after the beating he gave the car, tells Reva some rowdy bar customers must have done it. Reva asks if he wants to call a cab and go home, but Jonathan wants to stay and talk to a girl at the bar. Reva believes him and leaves alone. Once inside, Jonathan checks his phone and sees that Cassie has been trying to reach him. \n\n\nAt the farm, Edmund wants to make love to Cassie, but she sends him on an errand so she can get in touch with Jonathan. Edmund wants to know what is bothering her and she tells him Reva is coming over so they can mend their differences over Jonathan. Edmund finds Reva alone at Company and finds out that Cassie lied to him about Reva's visit. Reva confirms she had no plans to meet Cassie but asks Edmund to tell her sister to leave her son alone. Edmund, indignant, tells Reva that Cassie hates Jonathan and has every reason to do so. Reva calls Edmund a hypocrite and tells him he has been the recipient of more forgiveness than anyone in the universe deserves. Edmund blows this off and tells Reva he knows there is something going on and if she or Cassie won't tell him what is he will find out from Jonathan who seems to be in the middle of it all. Reva tells him to stay away from her son and asks Edmund to give her son a chance to prove himself.   \n\n\nAt the motel, Gus and Harley meet in the hallway and discover they have been occupying rooms right next door to each other. Gus is embarrassed when the desk attendant inquires whether Gus will need help clearing his things from the room. Harley wants to know what that was about and Gus admits that Alan threw him out and cut off his credit cards. Harley is asking Gus if he has any money at all and Gus drags her into his room. Harley is stricken to see the mass of papers strewn all over the room. Gus tells her he has it under control. She tells him it doesn't matter - that even if he wins her case - they will never be a couple. Gus won't hear it. He pulls Harley to him and tells her to admit she needs him. Not as her attorney, but as the man she loves. Harley says no, she can't say that. It's not true. She walks to the door. Gus listens as the door slams, but embraces Harley as she flings herself into his arms and pleads with him to stay the night with her. \n\n\nAlone at the farm, Cassie decides to look for Jonathan since he won't call her back. She opens the door to find him standing there. She demands to know what really happened between them night before her wedding. He agrees to tell her but only if she stays away from Reva. Cassie says that she wants to be free of that night more than anything, but the price is too high. She will never be out of her sister's life. Jonathan gives her the tape he claims is un-edited of the two of them in bed together. Edmund watches from a window. \n\n\nOutside at Farley's, Reva gives money to a homeless man. She tells him she wishes she had more, but she needs to find her son. The man tells him 'he's no good.' Reva is shocked when the man tells her he watched Jonathan beat the car in a rage.     \n\n\n",
