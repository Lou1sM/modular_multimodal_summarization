They decide to leave the tunnels because of the impending danger. Marina's fate seems bleak as she struggles to breathe under the weight of the beam that pins her chest, but just as she blacks out, Michelle and Marah save her.

Josh proposes that instead of looking for this mystery person, the men should lure the person to them. Cassie finishes a call when a strung out young man visits her. Cassie quickly deduces that he is looking for drugs as the man goes crazy and attacks her. She holds her own until Edmund arrives in time to provide some much needed backup. Harley's on her way to meet Brad but winds up face to face with Brad's wife (Marie) instead who demands to know why Harley's been calling her husband. While Harley quickly explains that she's trying to smooth the waters between Brad and Gus, Gus arrives. Gus backs up Harley's story in front of Marie but once alone, argues with her over her interference.
