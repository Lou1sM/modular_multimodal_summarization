She was trying to figure out who would sit where, since Alan couldn't sit by Phillip, Phillip couldn't sit by Gus, and she wanted to accommodate everyone's grievances.  Alan asked her if she had invited Olivia. When she flashed him a look, he said, \"She is my wife.\" She argued that Olivia was history, and he confidently said she'd be back. He thought back to the time he had replaced her birth control pills with fake ones.  \n\n\nIn the meantime, Olivia was at the hospital, trying to explain to Phillip that she had proof that Alan had taken the note, but Phillip didn't care. He told her that if Alan had done that then, yes, it was wrong, but Phillip was wrong for sleeping with Alan's wife.  She argued that the information changed everything.  He again protested that sleeping with her was wrong, and then he said that she got some kind of \"charge\" from Alan.  He could see it. Phillip told her that she had slept with him that day without even checking Alan's story out to see if it was true and told her to go be with him.  \n\n\nDr. Sedwick found Olivia and informed her that she couldn't refill her birth control prescription without an exam and said she had time right then, so Olivia had her yearly exam.  Alan found out Olivia was at the hospital and rushed over.  He asked her to go to Zach's welcome home party and reminded her that she was his wife.  She said, \"Reality check, Alan.  Our marriage is over.\"  Alan then reminded her of the night they had spent together, but she only replied with a request for a quick divorce.  When they parted, Alan called his P.I. and told her to get to the hospital and make an appointment with Dr. Sedwick.\n\n\nGus went to the hospital to beat information out of Roy Baker, but when he got there, he found out Baker had been transferred.  Mel and Harley were not telling him the whole truth.  Mel asked Harley how long she could go on like that and reminded her that Gus was a good detective and could read her every move.  Gus went to see Danny and asked if the family kept rent records on the property they owned. Danny verified that they did and said Gus could look through them only if he agreed to not charge anybody in his family with anything else he might see in those records that was against the law.  Gus promised.\n\n\n",

Alan tells Alex that fate will bring he and Olivia back together and he flashes back to having her birth control pills replaced with placebos. Alan calls his private eye and tells her to make an appt. with Olivia's ob-gyn after seeing Olivia coming from an exam. Olivia tells Phillip that Alan deliberately kept the letter from Phillip to keep them apart. Zach is moved out of intensive care. Mel tells Gus about Roy being moved. Harley withholds information from Gus. Gus goes to Danny asking about the Jane Doe who died in his dad's building. Danny allows him to go through the records as long as he doesn't implicate the Santos family. Gus agrees.",
