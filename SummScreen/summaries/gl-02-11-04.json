    "tvmega_recap": "Michelle interrupts Danny as he finalizes the arrangements for the special Valentine's benefit dance for the hotline. She hints that she's upset by her father but then begs off without leaving any details. Though he claims to be a fan of the idea of Valentine's Day, Shayne admits to Nico that he's going to the dance reluctantly because he knows Marina loves to dance. Marina opens up to Marah that she'd actually prefer to stay at home with Shayne. Hearing this, Marah enlists Sandy's help to give them a romantic date at home and asks for his help baking a cake. With Led Zeppelin playing in the background and a wig near her makeup mirror, Carrie gets ready for tonight's adventure and rehearses her words she intends to say to the men who killed Maryanne. Tony lets Danny know that he's still not sure Bruzi was behind the gas leak that almost killed Michelle. Tony warns that he's playing with fire but Danny insists he do what he tells him to do. Christopher asks Jeffrey to remove Reva from their \"project\" because she has too much going on in her personal life but Jeffrey won't hear it and guesses that he's becoming too close to Reva. Admitting she's taking her daughter, Beth urges Jeffrey to go to the benefit dance tonight because he might have a good time. Lizzie takes an interest in \"Blade\" who invites her to a rave at the warehouse on 5th Street tonight.",
