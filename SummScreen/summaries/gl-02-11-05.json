When Billy asks why she wants to know, she says it's because she thinks he's beating the crap out of Jonathan. Billy states that he hopes she's right and goes off to his dinner meeting. Unconvinced, Reva interrupts the meeting and creates a scene by demanding that he tell her where Josh is. Billy's upset when the client walks out, but not nearly upset as Reva who thinks Billy's lying. Billy's finally able to convince her that he has no idea where Josh is. \n\n\nWhere Josh is, is at the gym forcing Jonathan to work out for his physical therapy. Although Jonathan resists Josh's attempts to push him, Josh goads him into working out by comparing him to Shayne. Josh is ruthless and keeps forcing Jonathan to push himself harder and harder. Finally while spotting Jonathan, Josh gets to the root of the matter--he wants to know why Jonathan trashed Reva's car. Although Josh is pushing the weight onto Jonathan's chest and demanding that he answer, Jonathan refuses to answer. Finally, in pain and angry, Jonathan blurts out that it was a mistake. He should have never bought Reva that car to begin with. He angrily admits that he doesn't want to depend on her gratitude because when he depends on people they fail him. Josh then demands to know about the first time Jonathan was hurt. Just as it appears that Jonathan's about to answer, Reva rushes in and, seeing Josh forcing the weight onto Jonathan, demands to know what's going on. Josh merely states that he was spotting Jonathan. Despite Jonathan's cavalier attitude, Reva is angry and tells Jonathan she'll take him home and asks him to wait for her in the car. Reva and Josh then begin arguing over what she thinks she saw---him hurting Jonathan. Josh tells her she's wrong and is angry that she doesn't trust him. He tells her that he was hoping to get through to the kid, to make him open up. He then tells her that he's told Jonathan that she knows he wrecked her car. Reva is furious at that since she doesn't think it's the right time to tell him. Josh realizes that he can't win with Reva---he's the bad guy whether he tries to help Jonathan or not. Josh accuses her of not trusting anyone where Jonathan is concerned, and she admits it because the last time she trusted someone with Jonathan, Jonathan suffered. Josh then asks her point blank if she actually thinks he's like Jonathan's adoptive father, Alfred. Angry, Josh reminds Reva that he is a good father; his other kids wouldn't have turned out so well otherwise. Reva admits that she wants to trust Josh but Jonathan's a special case. Josh then accuses her of thinking she's the only one who knows what's good for her son. As they argue, a heartbroken Jonathan is outside hearing every word. \n\n\nAlan spots Gus on the street and implores him to come to his senses where Harley's concerned. Gus tries to argue that he's trying to prove Harley's innocent, but Alan thinks things are different now. Now, even Gus thinks Harley's guilty. Angry, Gus states that Harley's not going to prison. When Alan goads him by stating that he looks like a broken man, Gus maintains that he believes in Harley, she needs him. Alan doesn't think Gus is being very realistic though. How can he defend Harley effectively if he doesn't truly believe she's innocent? As a seething Gus is ready to lash out at Alan, Jeffrey approaches. When Gus walks off, Jeffrey tells Alan to leave the case to the professionals and stop bothering Gus. Perturbed, Alan informs Jeffrey that he won't tolerate a verdict other than guilty. Jeffrey tells Alan that he does expect Harley to be convicted; however he also believes that Harley is a good person, a lot better than Phillip. He goes on to say that the way Phillip was acting, he was a murder waiting to happen. Alan's not very happy to hear O'Neill denigrating his son and warns him that if O'Neill's personal opinion interferes with the outcome of the case, he'll be sorry. Jeffrey considers Alan's words to be a threat and has an officer nearby arrest him for threatening an officer of the court. \n\n\nGus is now at the site of Harley's new house daydreaming about day he shows Harley (acquitted in Phillip's murder) her new home. Suddenly, Alexandra comes and interrupts his thoughts. Seeing Alex is kind of bittersweet for Gus since he thinks she's where all his troubles began. If it wasn't for him covering for her, he would have married Harley and she wouldn't have had to face Phillip alone. Alex tells Gus that she's concerned for him since he's lost everything. Alex then surprises Gus by giving him a strand of pearls. She tells him to sell the pearls and use the money to give Harley the best possible defense. When Gus asks her whose side she's on, she replies that she's on love's side. Gus declines, but Alex states that he'll be doing her a favor by taking them. She states that she feels guilty about what happened to everyone, especially Phillip. She wants to make things better and implores him to sell the pearls to save the woman he loves. She then gives him a bit of advice by telling him to believe in Harley no matter what everyone else says. Before she leaves, Gus gives Alex another chance to change her mind by stating that she probably would rather give the pearls to an important family member. Alex states that she already did and walks off. \n\n\nLizzie arrives at Company. Coop greets her at the door though and tells her she can't go in. Lizzie realizes that they're having a special dinner for Harley on the eve of her trial and claims that it's hopeless since Harley's guilty of killing her father. When Lizzie starts to go in anyway, Coop physically carries her off to the Spaulding potting shed and locks her in. Locked in, a hysterical Lizzie tries desperately to get out. She breaks a window but only succeeds in cutting her hand. Seeing the blood on her hand, Lizzie imagines hearing screams and gunshots. Suddenly, she breaks down sobbing and asks her daddy to help her. Lizzie starts talking to herself. She says she's sorry, that she never meant to hurt anyone, she didn't mean to do it. Finally after the Cooper dinner is over, Coop returns and Lizzie practically runs out the door to get out. Coop can't understand why Lizzie is so upset and then notices her hand. Angry, she tells him that she panicked. She starts explaining that she's claustrophobic and being in the shed brought back painful memories. Seeing that she's visibly shaken, Coop tries to reach out to her.\n\n\n\n\n",
