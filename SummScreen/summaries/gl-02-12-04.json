    "soap_central": "\nThe Museum: \n\nMarina and Shayne come home to find the lights dimmed and no one home. They also find instructions from \"Cupid\"--whose handwriting looks suspiciously like Marah's. \nThe Country Club: \n\nMarah and Jeffrey meet at table five and tell each other there is no one they'd rather be with that night. After they figure out Sandy set them up together, Jeffrey tells Marah perhaps Sandy did them both a favor. \nJosh and Reva arrive together at the Country club. Reva tells Josh it feels like Valentine's Day and New Year's all in one. She calls it a new beginning for both of them. As he hugs Reva, Josh sees Alan, Buzz and Billy huddled together deep in conversation. \nDanny congratulates Michelle on planning the Charity dance so well. They both feel bad that Ed isn't there. \nCarrie's Room: \n\nWe see Carrie in her study penning a letter to each of the girls. \nCountry Club \n\nJosh excuses himself from Reva and goes to talk to Buzz, Alan and Billy. Josh asks if Marina said anything and Buzz says the last he'd heard the issue was resolved. Billy is doubtful of that, but Alan tells them not to worry and \"Eat, drink, and be merry.\" To which Josh replies, \"For tomorrow we die.\" \nAt a table with Alan and Lizzie, Beth notices Lizzie is anxious to leave and gives her permission to go to the teen dance in the next room. When Alan asks Beth if it was wise to let Lizzie leave un-chaperoned, Beth remains unconcerned. Meanwhile, as Lizzie is sneaking out of the Country Club, she leaves with a few stolen bottles of alcohol. \nAfter making small talk, Jeffrey asks Marah if something is wrong. She replies it's hard for her to make small talk and act like nothing happened between them. She tells him she can't stop thinking about him or the night they spent together. Jeffrey maintains that it was because it was only one night; cold reality hadn't set in yet. But Marah doesn't believe it. She thinks if they went to his room again, it'd be just as incredible as the first time. She tells him she thinks he believes that, too. \nAt a table with Reva and Edmund, Cassie shows off the earrings Edmund got for her. Just then, Edmund's cell phone rings and he leaves to take the call. After he leaves, Cassie spots Jeffrey and Marah together and tells Reva it's disgusting since he's old enough to be her father. \nJosh is outside calming himself when Billy sees him. Josh tells Billy coming there was a mistake. They wonder whether Ed will come for Michelle; Josh says not a chance. When they start to head back inside, Frank spots them. He asks Josh about the meeting he set up and then cancelled. \nTony flags Danny down to tell him that Bruzi is outside waiting for him. Danny tells him he'll be right there and then goes to get Michelle. The pair addresses the crowd, thanking them for coming and supporting the Crisis Hotline. \nThe Rave: \n\nLizzie's at the rave with Blade. After she gives him the liquor, he tells her that they're going to have a great time. \nCountry Club: \n\nCassie spots Marah and Jeffrey dancing and tells Reva to do something but Reva states Marah is entitled to some fun. Cassie tries to convince Reva that Jeffrey is a bed-hopping cad who'll only break Marah's heart when he moves on the next woman. Reva responds maybe he won't. She suggests perhaps Cassie's problem with Jeffrey is he looks like Richard and tells her to get over it. Cassie maintains her attitude toward Jeffrey has nothing to do with Richard, but Reva is skeptical. Meanwhile, Jeffrey, self conscious with Marah's family watching him, breaks off from Marah and asks Reva to dance. Reva, though, begs him off on Cassie. \nOutside, Frank asks Josh about the cancelled meeting. Josh tells him he was being threatened. He says it was work related; a disgruntled customer was sending him threatening notes and emails. He tells Frank the problem was worked out between them. Frank says that's odd, since most people who make threats don't back off so easily. But Josh tells him it's over. \nLater, Reva finds Josh alone outside and asks if he's avoiding her. He says he's just thinking. He tells her he wants his life back; he wants her back. \nThe Museum: \n\nShayne and Marina are enjoying their candlelight dinner and reading off of \"Cupid's\" index card. The card says for them to tell each other what most surprised them about the other-being specific and romantic. Shayne talks about Marina's attitude since his accident. He tells Marina he expected her to leave him, but she kept coming back. Marina tells him she's surprised by his spirit, generosity, kindness and willingness to forgive. She tells Shayne he makes her feel as if anything is possible. He tells her anything is possible as long as they're together. \nCountry Club: \n\nAnnoyed that Reva left her alone with Jeffrey, Cassie makes her displeasure of his and Marah's relationship known. She then tells him instead of playing footsie with her niece, he should be looking into a very dangerous drug that has hit the streets. At first, Jeffrey refuses to talk about work, but seeing her angry response, he changes his mind. He insists he wants to talk on the dance floor since he'd like to have some fun. However, this time Cassie refuses to talk and so a fed up Jeffrey pulls a shocked Cassie on to the dance floor. \nTony spots Blake and Ross at the club and sarcastically tells them his hands are clean. Blake tries to tell him they didn't leak the story of him getting beat up to the press, but it's obvious Tony doesn't believe her. Alone with Ross, Blake laments that they did talk about the incident rather loudly in public and a reporter overheard. Though Blake feels awful about it, Ross tells her Tony shouldn't have gotten in the fight to begin with; it's his own fault. He tells her this is a political fight and anything and everything is fair game. \nDanny is talking to Bruzi in his car and tells him that if he has a problem to go to him, not Tony or his family. Danny brings up the gas leak incident with Michelle, but Bruzi denies having anything to do with it. Danny doesn't believe him though and tells him to keep his feud with Salerno out of Springfield and away from his family. He warns if he doesn't, Danny will come after him with everything he's got. \nMichelle notices Marah's in a very good mood. Marah says she feels like things are finally looking up for her. She says even though they can't be sure if Carrie is out of their lives, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from her shoulders. Michelle agrees and says whatever happens next, it will be between them and their fathers with no outside interference. \nJosh tells Reva he's never stopped loving her and apologizes for distancing himself. He says there is one more thing he has to do and then it will be over. \nMichelle is surprised when Ed walks in the Country Club. She tells him she didn't think he was coming and he responds he wouldn't miss her big night. Touched, Michelle hugs him. \nWhile dancing, Cassie tells Jeffrey about the kid who attacked her at the Crisis Hotline center. She tells him he was wired on some drug called Delirium. Jeffrey tells her he's heard of it. Surprised, Cassie tries to convince him something needs to be done; parents need to be warned about the dangers and there needs to be a resource for kids. She is surprised again when Jeffrey says he's sure his office and the police department will be happy to assist her in any way they can. Just as Jeffrey is dipping Cassie, Edmund returns. \nAt the Rave: \n\nBlade has offered to get Lizzie a drink. He then secretly puts a drug, Delirium probably, into the drink. He gives it to her and tells her to drink up. \nThe Museum: \n\nWith soft music playing, Shayne asks Marina to dance with him. They dance and later make love. \nCountry Club: \n\nEdmund compliments Cassie on her and Jeffrey's dancing. She tells Edmund about her conversation with Jeffrey about the kid at the crisis center and how Jeffrey would only talk if they danced. As she tells Edmund that she just doesn't understand Jeffrey, Edmund gets a worried look on his face. \nAs they dance, Marah compliments Jeffrey on his dancing with Cassie as well. He tells Marah that he was just smoothing the waters with Cassie. Marah tells him he's a lot more thoughtful than people realize. The pair then shares a passionate kiss. \nEd tells Michelle he can't stand the distance between them. He says he wants his daughter back and asks her to dance. \nAs the camera pans over everyone dancing, Carrie walks in to the Country Club.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dimitri brings Gus an enormous number of files from the pharmaceutical division of Spaulding. Jeffrey insists that Gus spend the night going through each file but Gus reminds him that he doesn't speak Russian and won't be able to translate anything he finds. Gus enlists the Russian-speaking Dimitri to handle a phone call to the Russian shipper. Gus lets Jeffrey know that the drugs are disappearing once they reach the trucking portion of the shipping plan.
