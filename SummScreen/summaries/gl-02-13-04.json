In the aftermath of their confrontation with Carrie, the girls are feeling positive for the first time in a long time. Josh and the other men believe that the mystery of the witness will be over soon, one way or another. Carrie appears alone in her room dressed up like the long-dead Maryanne Caruthers. Josh and Billy take a breather out on the patio, where a curious Frank joins them. Josh admits to Frank that he was receiving threats, but tells him it's been taken care of. Reva finds Josh outside and the two share a romantic moment. Michelle is thrilled when Ed shows up at the party and asks her to dance. Marah and Jeffrey realize that someone who wanted them to get together on Valentine's Day has set them up. The attraction between them is undeniable but when they begin to get close on the dance floor, Jeffrey pulls away. Across the room, Cassie voices her disgust about Jeffrey and Marah to Reva. Reva tells Cassie that she is not going to get in the way of Marah being with the man she chooses. Jeffrey, wanting space from Marah, finds himself asking Cassie to dance. Cassie takes the opportunity to talk to Jeffrey about the Delirium problem facing teens. Edmund enters to see Cassie and Jeffrey dancing and he and Marah quickly cut in. Danny gets word from Tony that Bruzi is waiting outside. Danny makes a gracious speech at the dance and then joins Bruzi in his limo. Blake feels guilty that a reporter overheard her and printed the story about Tony getting in the fight. But Ross assures her there's nothing to be ashamed about. He wants to win. Marina and Shayne enter the museum to find that \"Cupid\" has set up a romantic evening for them, filled with food, ambiance and music. Marina and Shayne wrap up their perfect evening by making love. Lizzie slips out of the party to join another party thrown by Blade and his friends in a warehouse. She revels in her freedom but is quickly put in danger when Blade drops a \"D\" into her drink. As the couples dance the night away, a figure appears at the top of the stairs. It's Carrie, out of her room and watching them all."
