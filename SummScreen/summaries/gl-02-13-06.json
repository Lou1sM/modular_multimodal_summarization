Billy tells Reva that he thinks that there is more to her than just \"Reva and Josh\" when she says that Josh told her that he wants to spend Valentines Day by himself. Buzz comes by and tells them to leave Olivia alone and Reva correctly guesses that he is interested in her. Billy and Buzz discuss being interested in women who are interested in other men. After finding Olivia telling Emma about finding a guy eventually, Josh and Olivia share a kiss. Josh tells her that he isn't ready for anything serious and doesn't want to let either her or Emma down. Olivia says she understands and calls Frank to invite him and his family out for Valentines Day. Harley decides to go to the Spaulding Valentines Day party after all, where Alan- Michael has admitted to Alexandra that he is all set to take over as CEO. Alex starts to announce Alan-Michael's takeover, but he interrupts and offers a toast to Harley instead, telling Alex that it will look bad to take the company away from the grieving widow while she is there. He tells Marina that he had to cover for a million-dollar mistake that Harley made. At the party, Mallet tells Dinah that she can introduce him as her boyfriend if she wants. Later, Dinah tells Mallet to go dance with Harley to \"save\" her and she thanks him for always coming to her rescue. He tells her it's just the type of things that you do for people you love. Harley gets upset and runs off to say goodbye to Gus one last time."
