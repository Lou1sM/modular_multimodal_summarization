Both Frank and Josh find her and although Frank is very affectionate towards her, Olivia is cold towards Josh. Ava hides a mark on her neck with a scarf. Everyone comes downstairs and discusses how there was a lot of alcohol consumed and there is tension everywhere. Marina finds Lizzie hiding outside, and Lizzie is not happy to find that Ava is up at the cabin. Roxie has an accident on the sidewalk and when Lizzie cleans it up and goes to throw it away, she finds an open condom wrapper in the trash. She goes in and questions everyone to find out if it belongs to Coop and Ava. While she is asking questions, everyone flashes back to what has happened. Marina explains that she and Alan-Michael snuck off for some alone time, but a phone call from the office cut that short. She tells Alan-Michael to take care of business and she is going to take a cold shower. As A-M leaves her room, we find out that it was actually Frank who called him and told him to get out of his daughter's room. A-M runs into Olivia in the hallway and flirts with her, they share a drink, but she runs off to Josh's room. Frank interrupts her there, with an excuse the he has no lights in his room, and when Olivia goes with him, says it was just a ploy to get her there. He tells her that he wants to be the guy who tells her how special she is every day, and they kiss. A fire alarm going off breaks them up and they go to see what is going on. Ava and Coop have accidentally set off the fire alarm with a problem with the fireplace. Ava and Coop sit down to talk and she tells him that if things are over with Lizzie she would be glad for him to give her a chance. They start to kiss but Coop pulls away saying that he can't do this right now. An ember jumps out of the fire and lands on Ava's neck and although Coop tries to help, Ava says she just wants to take a shower and get away. While in the shower, Alan-Michael comes in; thinking it is Marina inside. Ava thinking Coop has come after her is shocked to find a naked Alan-Michael outside the shower. After the initial shock, they get dressed and compliment each other's physiques. Olivia goes back to Josh's room, and after they kiss Josh tells her that he doesn't appreciate being part of her games. Olivia gets upset and goes to her room to cry. Back in Springfield, Buzz notices Frank's good mood and Frank tells him that things changed for him and Olivia the night before. After Frank leaves, Buzz remembers going to Olivia's room after hearing her crying and the two of them having passionate sex, ergo the condom that was found."
