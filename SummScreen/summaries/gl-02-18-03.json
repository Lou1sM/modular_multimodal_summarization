They talk and he goes to meet a client after telling Olivia that his life had been one mistake after another. She asks, was being with me a mistake even if something good could come from it? He leaves only to daydream about their lovemaking session. He goes to her and says that it wasn't a mistake, he's not proud of what they did, but even if nothing good ever comes out of it, he doesn't regret anything they said or did. Olivia tries to tell him her news but he gets a call from Lizzie asking him to come see her. Meanwhile Olivia gets a phone call from Monica Parker, the PI that Alan fired. She tells Olivia that Alan did bad things to her but not nearly as bad as what he did to Olivia. She tells Olivia that Alan replaced her birthcontrol pills. Gus has Alex and Edmund brought in for questioning. Alex freaks out under the pressure of interrogation. She tells Gus that Regina was under the protection of Miguel Santos when she died. Gus is shocked to think that Miguel could possibly be his daddy. Alex tells Edmund that she didn't tell the whole story to Gus and that he won't like what he hears if he finds out what she is hiding."
