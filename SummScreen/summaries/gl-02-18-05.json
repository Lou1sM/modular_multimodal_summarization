    "soap_central": "\n\nOlivia is doing a press conference at Towers concerning her running Spaulding while Alan is in jail. Suddenly, Sebastian makes an appearance and gets under Olivia's skin by questioning why it's taking Alan so long to get bailed out. When the conference ends, Bill asks Olivia how long she plans to have Alan sit in jail Olivia replies as long as she can. She then leaves for the office. \n\nMeanwhile, someone has just bailed Alan out--Sebastian. Knowing who Sebastian is, Alan asks him what he wants for bailing him out. Sebastian maintains that he wants a job. He tries to sell himself by stating that his near death experience has left him fearless. He volunteers to help Alan get rid of the person who's undermining him--Olivia. Alan agrees to take the offer under advisement and then leaves for the office to confront Olivia. Olivia's shocked to see Alan and tries to make an excuse about being too busy and distracted to bail him out. He doesn't buy it. Olivia tries to get Alan to tell her who bailed him out, but he won't tell her. He then introduces her to some men in white outside the door--to take her to Ravenwood. Olivia insists that he's not locking her away and Alan relents. But he states that she owes him. He wants something from her: a piece of her business. Olivia refuses to give him a piece of Slingshot and so he settles for her accompanying him to the courthouse to support the family at Harley's trial. \n\nTammy visits Cassie at the farm. She notices how edgy Cassie seems and Cassie states that she's waiting to hear from her fertility doctor. Tammy then asks where Edmund is. She notices something in Cassie's expression and asks if everything's all right with her and Edmund. Cassie states that she's worried about Edmund and Jonathan. Tammy gets the feeling that Cassie is afraid that Edmund will hurt Jonathan and asks if he's done something. Cassie says no and then changes the subject by asking about her and Sandy. Tammy reports that everything's fine; she's even hoping that something will happen soon. \nEdmund approaches Jonathan at Towers on the balcony. Jonathan warns Edmund not to touch, since they are in a public place and there are eye witnesses. Edmund assures Jonathan that he just wants to talk. He reveals that he's been where Jonathan is now--on the outside looking in. He knows it's lonely. He apologizes to Jonathan and offers his hand in friendship. When Jonathan seems wary, Edmund states that he's sorry for everything he's done to him. He admits that the misery in Jonathan's life is his fault. Jonathan states that it's too late for \"I'm sorry.\" He then tells Edmund that if he intends to buy his forgiveness, it won't work. Edmund maintains that he's not trying to buy him. Instead he gives Jonathan a family heirloom---his mother's amethyst statuette. Edmund then offers to help Jonathan become a part of the family. Jonathan is skeptical, but Edmund states that he knows what it means to have a second chance. \n\nEdmund finally arrives home. Soon after, Cassie gets a call--the test went well. She can have an egg retrieval schedule tomorrow. The couple is ecstatic. Cassie starts talking about how no one can hurt them anyway. There are no more secrets between them. Meanwhile, Jonathan spies Edmund and Cassie at the farm and breaks the statuette and tosses it. \n\nReva awakens from a nightmare about Edmund killing Jonathan. Josh tires to reassure an upset Reva that Jonathan is in no danger from Edmund but she's not convinced. Reva then starts talking about how she can sympathize with Jonathan--she knows what it feels like to be the outcast. Josh tries to convince Reva that she's no longer the wild girl she once was, she's matured into the woman she was meant to be. He calls her a force of nature that no one looks down on, except herself. He then leaves. Suddenly, Jonathan enters and appears skittish. When Reva asks him what's wrong, he seems reluctant to tell her. After a little bit of coaxing, he tells her that Edmund wants him gone. He tells her that Edmund attacked him and then followed him to Towers. When Reva asks Jonathan if he things he's in danger, Jonathan says yes. He then tells her that Edmund tried to kill Cassie. Reva demands some answers for that comment. Again reluctantly, Jonathan tells her what he heard about the fire. He tells his mother that while the fire was accidental, Edmund made it happen. \n\nHarley's trial has begun and the first witness is Frank. After some questioning about the arrest and the evidence found, Jeffrey asks Frank if he arrested his sister based on the evidence provided. Did the evidence lead him to conclude that Harley was guilty? Frank is forced to admit that at the time he arrested Harley, based on the evidence, he believed she was the one who shot Phillip. Gus then cross-exams Frank. He gets Frank to admit that Harley wasn't the first person Frank arrested---it was Buzz. And he arrested Buzz because the evidence pointed to him being guilty. Gus points out that Frank made a mistake in arresting his father. He then goes on the state that Frank has made errors in judgment and trends to jump to conclusions. The court is then called to recess. In the hall, Coop tries to call the guy about the DNA test and is shocked when he's told a woman already took that information. Coop then approaches Lizzie and asks her if his phone rang the other day, when she was encased in the cement. Lizzie refuses to answer the question. Court's called back into session and the next witness up is Lizzie. On the stand, Lizzie tells Jeffrey about Harley's attempts (as Ruth) to get her to incriminate her father for the car accident. She then talks about how Gus tried to get her to say anything to get Harley off. She tells the court that Gus wanted to get Harley off, it didn't matter to him if she was guilty or not. When Jeffrey asks what Gus did when Lizzie refused to lie on the stand, Lizzie shows her bruised arm. Coop suddenly whispers in Gus's ear and now it's Gus's turn to question Lizzie. Gus gets Lizzie to admit that her father was deeply disturbed the last days of his life. Then to downplay her credibility, Gus brings up her instances of mental disturbances. Such as the hit and run, causing Olivia to fall, the fire at her boarding school. A flustered Lizzie claims that all of those were accidents, but Gus isn't buying it. He then asks her point blank where she was when Phillip was shot. While Lizzie is getting more and more flustered, Gus tries to badger her into admitting that she shot Phillip. \n\n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Frank and Harley commiserate at their childhood tree house, however, when Jeffrey brings Frank to the stand, Frank cracks under Jeffrey's pressure and admits that he believes that Harley really killed Phillip. Coop realizes that Lizzie posed as him and canceled the test on the shard of glass. Olivia tries to keep Alan locked up, not knowing that Sebastian has already released him for a price of course...a job at Spaulding. Reva is afraid that Edmund is just as dangerous as he once was, but Edmund tries to make amends.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jeffrey puts Frank on the witness stand and further damages Harley's chances of acquittal. Coop learns that the phone call with the results of the blood test might have been intercepted by Lizzie. Sebastian bails Alan out of prison and asks him for a job. Cassie and Edmund learn that their first appointment with the fertility specialist is the next day. Edmund apologizes to Jonathan and extends him an olive branch. Reva and Josh argue again over Jonathan. Josh tells Billy that he believes there is no hope for Reva where Jonathan is concerned. Jonathan lies and tells Reva that Edmund threatened him again. Alan threatens to throw Olivia back into Ravenwood after he learns that she did not try to bail him out. Jonathan tells Reva that Edmund caused the fire and almost killed Cassie in the process. Lizzie gets cross-examined on the witness stand and loses her cool. Gus accuses her of being the murderer.",
