Just as she's about to go\ninside his room, Olivia comes and tells her to wait; she can't tell\nPhillip his baby is alive. Cassie wonders if this is the best thing for\nOlivia or Phillip.  Olivia states that she needs to protect Emma; she's\nnot safe if Lizzie finds out she's alive. Cassie tells Olivia that she\ncan't let fear rule her life, but Olivia says she has to protect her\nchild no matter what. Olivia says Phillip couldn't protect them from\nLizzie when he was 100% so he certainly can't do it now.  But Cassie\nwants to see for herself and goes into the room.  In the room, Phillip\nsays hello to Cassie and when she asks how he is, he  tells her that\nhe's been better, but Olivia's helping him through it.  Cassie tries\ntalking to Phillip, but Olivia answers a lot of the questions herself.\nPhillip tells Cassie he had no idea how awful it was (to lose a child)\nand tells Cassie he's sorry for her loss. He tells her he wished he\ncould have helped.  He regrets not being able to protect Olivia and\ntheir daughter from Lizzie.  If he had trusted more, his daughter would\nstill be alive.  When Phillip asks when the pain stops, Cassie says\nnever.  She then asks Olivia if she feels the pain of the loss.   Olivia\nthen decides to end the visit and tells Cassie that Phillip needs\ncheered up, not dragged into the past.  Before leaving, Cassie tells\nPhillip that she hopes his pain eases a lot sooner than hers did, and\nshe has a feeling that if all goes well, it should.  Later, outside in\nthe hall, Olivia thanks Cassie for not saying anything about the baby\nbut Cassie says she feels like a louse.  She doesn't think what Olivia\nis doing is right because Phillip is suffering.  Olivia compares her\nsituation with Cassie's having helped fake Danny's death and lying to\nMichelle about it---the lie was necessary to save their lives.  Cassie\nasks Olivia how she thinks Phillip will react when he learns the truth;\nOlivia says she'll handle it.  Cassie thinks Olivia can tell Phillip the\ntruth and still keep the baby away from Lizzie and the Spauldings.\nCassie tells her to bring Emma to the hospital and trust her husband.  \n\n\nThe Lewises:\n\n\nJosh arrives at Reva's where she and the kids are enjoying themselves.\nHe tells them he just wanted to stop by before  meeting Billy.  After\nstaying a while and playing a trivia game with his family, Josh goes to\nleave.  Marah goes to him and tells him that she thinks things are going\nto be good from now on. Josh agrees and they hug.  After Josh leaves,\nMarah makes a call on her cell phone asking the person on the other end\nif she's ready to go to the Fairgrounds.  She reminds her to wear the\nring Carrie gave.\n\n\nBilly's at a bar and orders a club soda. However, when he watches the\nbartender pour a drink, he changes his order to bourbon on the rocks.\nAs Billy is staring into his bourbon, Father Ray happens to come in and\ntells Billy that he really doesn't want that drink.  Ray tells Billy\nthat it won't give him the comfort he's looking for.  Ray suggests that\nBilly needs to talk to someone he can trust.  Billy then glances at his\nwatch, noticing that he's late for a meeting.  He then gives Ray the\nuntouched glass of bourbon.\n\n\nCompany:\n\n\nBuzz is making plans to close the restaurant for the night.  Suddenly,\nFrank comes and shows Buzz what he found wide open at the\ncounter--Buzz's duffle bag with a loaded gun and extra ammunition.\nFrank demands to know what's going on, but Buzz just rushes out saying\nthere's someplace he has to go.  He tells Frank that after tonight,\nhe'll never have to see the gun again.  He tells him that tonight he's\ncleaning up.  Later, we see Buzz practicing his shooting at the shooting\nrange.\n\n\nAfter Buzz is already gone, Ed comes in looking for him and is spotted\nby Holly. She tells him she knows he's been avoiding her.  She knows\nhe's been having some difficulties lately.  Ed apologizes for not\ncalling her.  She mentions that she hasn't seen him at any meetings.  He\nsays that he hasn't been going, but he's not drinking.  He again\napologizes for not calling, but she understands.  Sometimes you just\nneed to pull back and just let things quiet down.  Ed is surprised at\nher acceptance.  Holly tells Ed to tell her he's okay.  He says he can't\ngo that far, but he's facing his problems now instead of hiding from\nthem.  Holly suggests that they have dinner sometime and Ed tells her\nhe'll call her tomorrow.  Before leaving, Ed takes the bottle of pills\nfrom out of his pocket and throws them in the trash.    \n\n\nThe Fair Grounds:\n\n\nCarrie's there alone and starts looking around.  She remembers being\nthere with Maryanne all those years ago.  But Carrie remained alone\nwhile Maryanne hung around with the young men.  Carrie thought she saw\nAlan put something in the beer, but couldn't be sure.  When the group\nleft, Carrie saw the vial and knew for a fact what Alan had done.  She\ndrove off to follow the men and Maryanne, following them to Cutter's\nBridge, where she saw skid marks.  She then saw the men come out of the\nriver with no Maryanne.  She saw the men make their pact to forget the\nincident and forget that Maryanne even existed.  Carrie vows that\nMaryanne will be seared into their memories because this time, it's\ntheir daughters' lives at stake.\n\n\nLater, Buzz, Billy, and Josh arrive at the darkened Fairgrounds.\nSuddenly the lights go on and Buzz notes, \"She's here.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "It's the night of Carrie's revenge. Each man gets ready in his own way. Josh turns to Reva and his family for a sense of strength and purpose. Billy toys with alcohol but Father Ray talks him out of it. Ed reveals to Holly his hope for a better future which will include more time with her. At the Lewis home, Marah enjoys spending time with her father, while Josh is reminded of all he has to fight for. Meanwhile, Carrie prepares by voicing her resentment towards each of the men. She is the first to arrive at the fairgrounds and she swears revenge as Buzz, Josh and Billy arrive, tense and alert. Cassie arrives to visit Philip but is discovered by the anxious Olivia. Cassie reveals that keeping the secret of Emma is growing increasingly difficult for her. Phillip's condition only reinforces Cassie's feelings and she insists that Olivia tell Phillip the baby is alive.",
