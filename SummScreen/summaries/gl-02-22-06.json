She tells Jonathan about it and he wonders why anyone would want to hear her tell about how to live life but tells her that she should go. Billy convinces her to go, and tells her that he is going with her. She asks Olivia to the keys to Cross Creek and after turning her down at first, Olivia quickly hands over the keys when Reva says it means she won't be around Josh for the whole weekend. On the way up, Billy and Reva get a flat tire and while waiting for the Auto club to show up start to reminisce. Once back on the road, Reva dreams on what it would be if she and Billy had stayed married all of these years. She dreams of a wealthy life, but one where she and Josh have had basically no contact and Billy sneaks off to meet Vanessa, the other woman. She also dreams that when Josh came to visit, all of the old feelings resurfaced and they realized that they never were truly parted in their hearts. Reaching the school for her speech, Josh shows up having been told by Jonathan where she was. Bringing Reva flowers and finding Josh there, he tells him that he is going to ruin everything. Giving her speech, Reva tells the girls that although she has had a bumpy life she never regretted following her heart. Billy and Josh are both moved by her speech. On the way home, Reva tells Billy that the experience taught her that she is going to do anything to get Josh back. Billy tells her that their kiss and all the time they have been spending together means more to him that he has let on. Reva starts to digest this as she finds a half-empty bottle of alcohol. She asks Billy if he has been drinking as lights come towards them and Billy hits the brakes."
