Cassie implied that Olivia was only after the Spaulding fortune and as long as she kept her daughter a secret, she was playing into the rumors.  Olivia didn't care as long as Lizzie stayed away from her baby.  Cassie threatened to tell Phillip the truth, but Olivia posed a counterthreat -- if Cassie told, Olivia and Emma would leave, and with the Spaulding resources, they'd never be found.  She wanted Phillip to keep believing that he owed her.  \n\n\nCassie finally saw Olivia had been using her in order to fulfill her plan to gain control over the Spauldings.  Cassie didn't believe that Lizzie was the reason Emma was still a secret.  Cassie had seen what losing his daughter had done to Phillip.  Olivia realized she had no other choice than to take Emma to Ravenwood to meet her father.  But she had to take care of something first.  \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Olivia met a man who handed her a file.  She was anxious to get to work.\n\n\nCassie promised Phillip he was going to get better.  Phillip envied Cassie's ability to heal after losing her child and Richard.  He admitted that although he was still living, he was not sure why he should be.  Cassie said it was love that had helped her through.  She hoped he would have love to help him too.\n\n\nAt the museum, Marah told Marina and Michelle that she wasn't going to the fairgrounds.  She feared Carrie was up to something.  Michelle felt that a memorial for Maryanne was the best way to end things.  It would provide everyone with peace.  Marina agreed, feeling Michelle's enthusiasm.  Marah gave in.\n\n\nAt the fairgrounds, spotlights illuminated Buzz, Billy, and Josh.  Buzz nearly drew his gun when Alan and Ed arrived.  He checked to make sure it was loaded when the others entered the fun house.  They felt vulnerable as they spotted Carrie in the house of mirrors.  Carrie kept her distance -- she had seen Buzz at the shooting range that day and knew she was in danger.  \n\n\nBuzz showed the others the gun, proud that he had gone prepared.  Josh was disgusted, promising Buzz wasn't going to use it.  Carrie wanted \"a life for a life\" and insisted one of the girls had to die to balance the scales.  Josh became enraged, kicking and cracking one of the mirrors, begging her to kill him instead.  However, Carrie wanted the pleasure of seeing him suffer.  \n\n\nCarrie demanded the men choose which girl would die.  Alan threatened that it might be Carrie who died that night.  She suggested she might already have the girls even though they had told her they wanted nothing to do with her.  \n\n\nThe girls explored the fairgrounds, feeling the effects of the Antimonius in their rings.  They followed the music emanating from the fun house.  Josh thought he heard Marah's voice.  The guys realized all three girls had to be there.  Buzz pulled his gun as they split up to look for the girls.  Josh saw Marah in the mirror and Carrie in the distance, pointing a gun.  Billy, Buzz, and Josh yelled for Marah to get down on the floor.  She did.\n\n\nSandy scanned family photos at the Lewis house.  He read the inscription on a handmade ashtray and realized Reva hadn't been there much for Shayne's childhood either.  Reva entered with a box of junk and asked Sandy to help her start sorting through the remnants of her family's past.  Sandy agreed on the condition that Reva make him cookies.  He found a carousel music box and said he had always wanted one.  \n\n\nThe music made Reva zone out, but when Sandy asked if she was having a psychic vision, she said it was nothing -- the music gave her the creeps.  Reva noted it was the second time she'd had a feeling when Sandy had been around.  She said maybe they really did have a connection.  After Sandy left, Reva saw a vision of Carrie in the house of mirrors while going through an old jewelry box.  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The men arrive at the Fairgrounds, as per Carrie's orders, and at first she is nowhere to be found. Odd music beings to play from the adjacent funhouse and they go inside to investigate. There, they come face to face with a veritable maze of mirrors and they immediately lose their sense of space. Finally, Carrie's voice is heard and a dozen images of her appear all at once, but it is still unclear which is really Carrie and which are reflections. Carrie tells them that tonight is the night of reckoning and that to repay for what happened to Maryanne, one of the girls must lose their life. The men go ballistic but Carrie insists that if they don't pick one, she'll do the picking herself. Marah is having second thoughts about accepting Carrie's invitation to go to the fairgrounds. But Michelle and Marina, already under the influence from the drug Carrie applied to their rings, convince her to go. The girls arrive and go inside the funhouse where they hear music playing. Josh sees Marah first and tries to yell for her to leave but she's in a daze and doesn't hear him. Carrie sees Marah too and starts to pull out her gun. Cassie confronts Olivia about the secret she's keeping from Phillip and insists that part of the reason he's in Ravenwood is because he blames himself for what happened. Olivia stands her ground and says that she's scared of what will happen if Lizzie learns of the baby's existence. Cassie insists that both she and Phillip will protect the secret but if Olivia doesn't tell him, Cassie will. Realizing that she has no choice, Olivia promises to tell Phillip the truth after she takes care of one last thing. Olivia then meets with a well- dressed man to discuss papers of an unknown agenda.",
