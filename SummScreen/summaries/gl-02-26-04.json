    "tvmega_recap": "In the aftermath of the shooting, Frank arrives at the Fairgrounds. He insists that Buzz be taken to the hospital so that his wound can be treated. Billy and Josh relay their version of the shooting to Frank and Jeffrey. Frank then leads Josh away to the police station. Ed tends to Michelle, Marah and Marina who are all still under the influence of the drugged rings. He takes charge and feeds them the story they'll be selling to the cops; the girls were never at the fairgrounds. When the girls take their rings off, they begin to get more lucid but Marah still doesn't remember what happened in the funhouse. Ed breaks the news that Josh shot Carrie. Marah is stunned and Ed pulls Michelle aside, worried that they can't count on Marah to stick with the story. Later on, Marah answers the door to Jeffrey O'Neill. Alan returns home to find Harley and Gus waiting to ask him questions about Antimonius. Harley gets a call from Frank, informing her about the shooting. When Alan, sticking to the story that he was not there, asks about the shooting, Gus gets the feeling that Alan is hiding something. Gus's suspicions are further fueled when Frank informs him that Alan's car was seen driving away from the fairgrounds tonight. Harley tracks down Buzz who has refused hospital treatment. They share an emotional moment and for the first time in a while, Buzz believes he might be able to give up his past.",
