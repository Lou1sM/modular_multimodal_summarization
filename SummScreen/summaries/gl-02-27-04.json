He had shot her; he'd had no choice. While Josh was being fingerprinted, Frank told him that stepping forth voluntarily would look good in the eyes of a judge, if it even went to trial. Josh stated he wanted to pay his dues.  \n\n\nRoss arrived and asked for a moment with his client.  In the interrogation room, he blasted Josh for talking to the police without counsel present and said they'd be handling his defense Ross's way.  Josh told Ross that he wanted to plead guilty and accept the punishment.  Ross tried to tell Josh that going to jail wouldn't do his family any good; his crime was defensible. However, Josh insisted.  \n\n\nAs Ross asked why Josh was railroading himself, Reva rushed in. She told Josh that Billy had told her about the shooting and asked him what had happened.  He told her the fabricated story about Carrie being a stalker and him having to shoot her in self-defense.  Reva wanted to go tell Marah and Shayne and was shocked to learn that Ed was doing that. She asked to speak to Josh alone.  \n\n\nAlone with Josh, Reva told him to tell the truth about what had happened earlier that night. She told him to trust her. She didn't care what story he was giving everyone else; she wanted the truth. Josh simply told her it was over, and he was trying to do the right thing.  He asked her to not leave Marah alone.  Josh told her whatever happened, she needed to take care of herself and the kids. Reva wasn't accepting defeat and said she was going to do whatever she had to do to get him home.\n\n\nJeffrey went to the museum and told Ed that he wanted to see Marah.  Ed objected at first but relented when Michelle told him it would be okay. Marah was still dazed and confused and told him to help her father. She said she knew he hadn't killed anyone. When he asked her what she meant, she said that her father was not that kind of person.  \n\n\nMarina and Michelle backed Marah up by saying it had been self-defense, and Jeffrey asked how they'd know that unless they had been there. Ed spoke up and said that he had been there, and he had told them what had happened.  Jeffrey asked to speak with Marah alone.  Ed sent the other two girls home.  \n\n\nBuzz was getting ready to close up Company when Alexandra rushed in. She was livid that he had never called her after being shot, and when she had gone to the ER, he hadn't been there.  She was upset that she had almost lost him, but Buzz said she was stuck with him and kissed her.  Alex told Buzz to let her take care of him and asked him to sit down and talk to her.  She told him that she knew whatever had happened earlier that night, he had done the right thing.  She told him that he had always been there for her when she had messed up, and it was her turn.   \n\n\nMarina then walked in and told Alex how her grandfather had heroically tried to help Josh with the deranged stalker and had taken a bullet for him.  When Alex went to fix Buzz something to eat -- an omelet, the only thing she knew how to cook -- Marina confided in Buzz that she'd had two heroes in her life: her dad and him. While she knew she could never be as good as her father, she thought she could be like Buzz, who she said never stopped trying to make things right no matter how bad things got.  Buzz told her she was more like her dad than she thought.  \n\n\nMarina started to apologize and blame herself for the night's events, but Buzz assured her that Carrie would have tracked them down even without the girls' help.  He told her that he didn't blame her for anything.  An upset Shayne walked in, having just gotten a message from Billy about the shooting. Marina tried to comfort him and said she wished she could do something, and  he said she could do something -- she could tell him how it all had happened.  \n\n\nMarina told Shayne that his dad was safe, and her dad would make sure he was treated fairly. Shayne told Marah he wanted to help Josh and thought up an idea to investigate the stalker/gunshot victim, Carrie Caruthers.  He wanted to look into her past to see if he could find anything in her history that could clear his father.  Marina tried to dissuade him and told him he could help by simply taking care of his mother and Marah.\n\n\nMichelle went home and flashed back to her and Marina hearing gunshots and Ed telling them to keep their secret.  Just then, Danny entered, and Michelle gave him Ed's story on the shooting.   Although he started to reassure Michelle that everything would be fine, Danny started questioning the evening's events -- mainly why Josh had needed four witnesses to confront one woman. He then mentioned seeing Alan in deep conversation with those same men at the Valentine's Day ball and commented that it was an odd group. \n\n\nMichelle got upset and told Danny to stop -- not every accident was a hit; sometimes things just happened.  Danny was confused as to why Michelle didn't want to get to the truth about what had happened, and she said she was just thankful that it hadn't been her father.  Danny suggested that maybe it had all been a wakeup call for Ed. That night, he had helped Josh and taken care of Marah.  Danny said maybe the Ed Bauer that Michelle knew and loved was on his way back.  Michelle said she wished she could believe that.\n\n\nAlone with Marah, Jeffrey asked her if she was all right, since she clearly looked spaced out.  Marah asked how it could have happened, and Jeffrey tried to comfort her by reassuring her that he'd help her dad.  He became concerned about Marah's condition and asked if she was okay. Marah was still confused about the night's events, and Jeffrey mentioned that Josh had shot Carrie with Buzz's gun.  \n\n\nAt the mention of the gun, Marah held her arms out like she was holding a gun.  Jeffrey was very concerned about Marah and asked if she was sedated.  She said no and choked out that something awful had happened that night. He told her that he'd take care of it, but Marah, on the verge of tears, said no one could, as she  continued to pretend she had a gun.  Suddenly, she blurted out, \"Oh, God!\" and seemed to be on the verge of confessing when Ed rushed in to stop the interview.\n\n\nWith Ed's entrance, Marah lost her train of thought and couldn't remember what she had been about to remember.  Ed tried to blame Marah's condition on the sedatives he had given her, which made Jeffrey suspicious, since Marah had said she hadn't had any.  He then told Ed he was taking Marah to Cedars to be looked at by another doctor, since he didn't trust Ed. As Ed and Marah left, Jeffrey called Frank as he remembered his first conversation with Carrie weeks earlier when she had claimed her life could be in danger.  Jeffrey told Frank that they needed to hold Josh overnight, and they needed to question all the men again.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Billy breaks the news to Reva that Josh has been arrested. She rushes to the police station to be by his side. Josh continues to stick to his story, determined to protect Marah at all costs. Even when Reva senses there's something he's not telling her, Josh won't betray his daughter. Marah is still feeling the effects of the drug that Carrie gave her. Michelle and Marina are coming out of it but the added shock of learning of Josh's arrest has sent Marah into a tailspin. Jeffrey arrives and does his best to comfort Marah. But he is also the DA and has to question her about the night of the shooting. Alone with Marah, Jeffrey is both loving and persistent and she almost recalls the moment when she pulled the trigger. But the moment passes and Ed and Jeffrey agree to take Marah to Cedars. Jeffrey cannot bail on his pursuit of justice and places a phone call to Frank, ensuring that Josh will remain behind bars overnight. Marina returns to Company, where Alex is doing her best to comfort Buzz. It's an emotional reunion for Marina as she is able to tell her grandpa how much she regrets putting her faith in Carrie. Shayne arrives, confused and upset that he's not allowed to visit Josh at the police station. Marina fears Shayne is going to start digging into what happened at the fairgrounds and tries to dissuade him. When Michelle returns home and tells Danny what happened to Josh, Danny recalls seeing Josh, Billy, Buzz, Ed and Alan together at the Valentine's dance. Danny's instincts kick in and he smells some kind of conspiracy, which Michelle instantly squashes. All she wants is to be with her family and she ends the evening with Robbie in her arms.",
