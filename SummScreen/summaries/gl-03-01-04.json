Buzz defends Frank as he's just doing his job bringing them all in for questioning. Billy reminds them to stick to their story for Josh's sake. \n\n\nAt the police station, Gus admits to Jeffrey that he doesn't believe Alan's story. He claimed he was only at the fairgrounds that night to survey some property he wanted to buy. Jeffrey is secretly pleased when Gus refuses to let Frank handle Alan; he wants to do it himself. \n\n\nFrank and Jeffrey question Buzz, Bill and Ed separately, but they aren't convinced of their accounts of the night's events. They notice all three used the word \"erratic\" to describe the deceased's behavior that night, which only increases their suspicion. Frank doesn't like that his father is involved in a murder rap. Jeffrey and Frank know the guys planned their stories down to the word. Alan arrives with a lawyer for questioning and tells Ed and Buzz his \"story.\" They don't buy it either. Buzz warns him not to underestimate Frank. Alan's lawyer advised him not to say anything to the police so he doesn't. \n\n\nWhile questioning Josh, Jeffrey remembers Marah's suspicion that she was being stalked the day she found the razor blade in her doll. As Josh describes the shooting, Jeffrey remembers Marah's hands forming a gun when she tried to remember that night...somehow a bullet from Buzz's gun saved Josh's life. \n\n\nHarley and Cassie meet at Company where Cassie admits she prefers Buzz's coffee to the Beacon's. Harley informs her she and Jeffrey have this in common. Cassie voices her dislike for the man, even though at times he can be human, like at the Valentine's dance. Harley agrees. Cassie hopes Jeffrey will go easy on her brother-in-law. \n\n\nGus finds Alan at Company and probes him again about the fairgrounds. How can he buy a piece of property he already owns? \n\n\nBill's phone has been ringing off the hook with nervous Lewis clients. His own nerves start to show but Eden reassures him that he can handle it and do his dad and uncle Josh proud managing the company. He is afraid Josh may be guilty. If Caroline Caruthers was stalking him, why did he keep it quiet? Eden can relate to \"keeping things quiet\", she's done it a lot, even with Bill. She decides to tell him about \"the Shadow\" who said Lewis had let the mob into the Fifth Street project. Bill says he would have known if Bruzi's guys were working for his company, but Eden reassures Bill that he couldn't possibly have known. Bill realizes that's how Tony got stabbed. Billy arrives and asks his son to run Lewis Construction for a while. \n\n\nMarah is light-headed and unable to focus the day after the murder. Marina and Michelle try to convince her not to go to the police station to see her dad. Michelle suspects their mutual confusion the night of Carrie's murder had something to do with the rings. Marah's memory is still a blur but when she tries to remember that night, her hands come together as if she is shooting a gun. Michelle and Marina urge her to stick with the story Ed told them to tell the police - they were never at the fairgrounds. The truth will only complicate things and maybe make things worse for Josh. Michelle collects the rings from the trash and suggests they hold onto them just in case. When Michelle and Marina aren't looking, Marah sneaks out of the museum and goes to the station. Ed urges her to leave but she is adamant and asks everyone why her father has not been released. Frank says things have gotten complicated. Jeffrey reluctantly tells her he's keeping Josh in custody.  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Billy, Buzz and Ed prepare to be called into the police station for questioning about Carrie's death. They agree to tell the police that Josh shot Carrie in self-defense. But when Frank and Jeffrey question them they use the same phrases, their story is too pat. Alan counters Gus's questions about his car being seen the night of the shooting by saying he was scouting the land for possible purchase. Gus finds it an odd explanation and decides to look into it. Alan is brought in for questioning but comes with his attorney and refuses to answer any questions. However, Gus later confronts Alan saying that it is curious Alan was looking to buy that land, considering he already owns it. Bill is dealing with the after-effects of Josh being taken into custody. He rants to Eden about the damage that keeping secrets can cause. This display of emotion causes her to admit the investigation she and Tony did to find out if the mob had infiltrated Lewis Construction or Danny's campaign. Billy comes to see Bill to say that he's going to suggest that Josh step aside for the time being if Bill feels up to the challenge of managing Lewis Construction. Marina and Michelle tend to Marah who is still suffering the after-effects of the drugged ring. Marah is troubled that her own recollections of the shooting do not match the story given to the police. But the girls remind her that they must stick to the story that they were not at the fairgrounds that night. Michelle realizes that the rings Carrie gave the girls to wear the night of the shooting might be important and decides to hang on to them. Marah promises to stay at home and sleep off the effects of the drug but, when they leave her, she sneaks out to the police station in search of her father. Upon arrival, she is surprised to see that her father is the only one who has not been released and heartbroken to find out that Jeffrey made the call to keep Josh in jail.",
