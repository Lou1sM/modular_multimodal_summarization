    "tvmega_recap": "Through a series of flashbacks, Alan-Michael remembers how Alan never had time for him as a child and always planned on Phillip taking over. At the reading of Alan's will, Alex, Beth, and even the maid and butler get their shares of the Spaulding estate. When it comes to Alan-Michael's turn though, all he is left is a dime that is instructed to be given to him heads up. Alan-Michael remembers back to the night of the blackout when Alan called him and asked him to come back to Springfield to help and he flipped a dime to decide. Since it landed heads up, Alan-Michael decided to come home. Although Alan-Michael laughs it off during the will reading, later he opens up to Marina that Alan pushed him off from the grave. Marina gives him a toy car that she says reminds her of the night they met and lists off the things that she likes about him. Later Harley turns over sole control of the company to Dinah, telling Alan-Michael it is a present and now he can leave the company for good."
