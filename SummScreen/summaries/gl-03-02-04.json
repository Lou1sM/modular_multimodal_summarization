    "tvmega_recap": "Cassie gives Olivia an ultimatum. Ross comes to see Phillip regarding the will Olivia had drawn up but Phillip insists that he has to trust Olivia. Olivia goes to Philip and has a brief run-in with suspicious Ross. Olivia feeling the heat, informs Phillip that she'll be leaving town for a while. She returns to Phillip with baby Emma in her arms and introduces him to his daughter. Marah is devastated that Jeffrey is keeping her father locked up. Jeffrey, forced to do his job and hating that he can't comfort her, assures Marah that he wants to help her and Josh. But his questions only make Marah feel more betrayed. In her heartbreak, she lashes out at Jeffrey and wonders if the time they spent together was real to him at all. Jeffrey attempts to reach out to her but Marah takes off, leaving him to suffer in his conflict. Marah then runs into Cassie, who finds herself in the odd position of comforting her niece by defending Jeffrey. Alan denies any knowledge of owning the old fairgrounds but Gus doesn't buy it.

Later in church, a guilty, troubled Alan prays for forgiveness. Gus returns to a hurting Jeffrey at the police station and Jeffrey realizes it's time to let Gus into the loop. He tells him the entire story of Maryanne Caruthers.",
