Thinking that she was about to commit suicide, Coop tackled Lizzie, pulling her away from the ledge. Lizzie assured him that she would not kill herself and teased that she had more reasons to live than he did. \n\n\nAs she started to leave, Lizzie slipped, but Coop saved her by grabbing her arm as she began to fall. After he pulled her back onto the roof, they shared a romantic kiss. Lizzie pulled away and left, only to meet Coop again at Company. Seeing the way that Coop and Lizzie were looking at each other, Frank warned Coop to stay away from her before it was too late.\n\n\nGus and Frank met at Company and attempted to discuss Harley's defense, only to be interrupted when Harley informed them that she was guilty and was going to accept the plea bargain. Harley went outside to call Alan and told him that she would give him what he wanted if he would meet with her at her office. Once Alan arrived, Harley confided that she remembered shooting Phillip and was going to change her plea to guilty. Surprised that she was not going to keep fighting, Harley admitted that she had heard him threaten Gus and knew that he intended to take Zack away from the Coopers. \n\n\nIn an attempt to bargain, Harley agreed to accept the plea if Alan would let Zack live with Buzz once she was in prison. When Alan didn't immediately agree, Harley became angry and accidentally admitted that she still did not remember what had happened the night of Phillip's murder. Alan eventually agreed that all he wanted was for Harley to go to jail, and if that happened, he would let Zack stay with Marina, Buzz, and Frank. After Alan left, Gus entered and again tried to talk her out of taking the plea. Harley told him that it was too late; Alan already knew. Harley tried to convince Gus that she would be okay. \n\n\nAfter Harley asked Gus to promise that he would go on without her and stating that he needed to make peace with his family, Gus kissed her, only for her to pull away and run out of the room. Harley then met Bill in the park, where he assured her that she did not have to be strong for him and attempted to comfort her by promising to finish her house for her children, so that they would have a stable home to grow up in. Gus, meanwhile, went to see Alan at Spaulding. Asking if he remembered what it had been like before all the hate, he told Alan that he would be nothing without Harley. As Gus started to leave, Alan stopped him by calling him \"son\" and telling him that there was something that he should know.\n\n\nSebastian met Olivia in her office with a copy of the background check that she had ordered and informed her that he had been made co-president. Confronting Alan, she demanded to know what his intentions were in hiring Sebastian. Alan simply said that it would be fun and told Sebastian that he could share Olivia's office until his was ready.\n\n\n",
