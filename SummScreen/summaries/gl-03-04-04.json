    "tvmega_recap": "Alan's emotional universe begins to implode as his past and present mistakes catch up with him. Gus returns home to Harley and tells her what happened at the fairgrounds all those years ago. As he confides in Harley, Gus recalls an intense confrontation he had with Alan in the church regarding the drowning of Maryanne Caruthers. Harley and Gus realize the difficulties of being loving parents as Gus wrestles with the fact that if he does not turn Alan in, he himself becomes an accessory. Alan visits Phillip at Ravenwood to apologize for his many parenting mistakes. However, Phillip is bitter off his encounter with Olivia and portrays a \"stick it to them, before they stick it to us\" attitude. Reva comes to see Josh at the police station and is happy to have a turn playing anchor for him. Reva's trust twists like a knife in Josh's heart. He urges her to focus on Marah instead. She questions him about his anxiety for her, and he covers. However, when Reva seemingly sees the ghost of Maryanne beckoning to her with urgency, she catches Josh's sense of worry for their child and rushes off.",
