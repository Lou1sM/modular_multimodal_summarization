He was concerned, since it was awfully early to be drinking, but Dinah was not in the mood and refused his offer to have breakfast with him. Dinah wallowed in self-pity, calling herself the \"family failure.\" She told Bill that the night before at the intervention, she had learned that she was nothing without Cassie. She talked about how the intervention had been all about protecting Cassie. Bill tried to convince her that that was not true, but she didn't believe it. \n\n\nDinah told about how she had been envious of Cassie and had hated her at the same time. Bill tried to tell Dinah that she could make a fresh start for herself. He tried to get her to leave the bar, but she refused and told him to just forget she was his sister. Bill then had to leave to go to Harley's hearing. \n\n\nJonathan and Reva were also at Towers, having breakfast. When Reva got up to make a phone call, a package arrived for her, and Jonathan signed for it. He opened it up and discovered that it was papers pressing charges against Edmund for what had happened the night of the fire. When Reva returned, she tried to grab the papers away, but he had already seen them and congratulated her. \n\n\nHowever, Reva told Jonathan she was not even sure yet if she'd go through with pressing charges. Jonathan tried to encourage her to follow her instincts and press charges, but Reva wasn't quite sure if it was the best thing to do. She then hurried to leave so she could be in court. When she was gone, Jonathan had the papers in his hands. \n\n\nIn their room at Towers, Edmund gave Cassie great news: her embryos were ready to be implanted, as early as that afternoon. Cassie was thrilled but was upset that she couldn't call Tammy or Reva, since the hotel's phones weren't working. Edmund told her that Tammy already knew. Edmund tried to ease her frustrations by telling her that he just wanted her all to himself that day. Suddenly, Edmund's cell phone rang. He told Cassie that he had to go; he had a meeting to get to. \n\n\nWhen Cassie suggested that Edmund leave his cell phone with her so she could call Reva, he told her that he needed it in case the clinic called. Edmund then went upstairs for his meeting, but the man from the consulate he had been set to meet with never showed. While he was waiting, Edmund instructed a waiter to send breakfast up to his wife. Jonathan overheard Cassie's room number. \n\n\nEdmund noticed Dinah at the bar and asked if she was stalking him. He thought she had set up the fake call so he'd see her. Dinah denied the charge and went back to drinking. Edmund tried to convince Dinah that she could change; she didn't have to be a prisoner to her obsession. He used himself as proof that she could change. Dinah was a little surprised at his concern for her, since she thought he hated her. \n\n\nEdmund maintained that he didn't hate Dinah; they were too much alike. He did feel sorry for her though. Dinah didn't appreciate that and asked to be left alone. When Edmund left, Jonathan approached. She was not in the mood to see him either, but he told her there was something he needed to show her. \n\n\nThe phone rang in Cassie's room -- it was the hotel management. While they were on the line, Cassie asked about the phones getting fixed and was disbelieving when she was told Edmund had ordered all outgoing phone calls blocked. Just then, room service arrived. On the table was a note, apparently from Reva, asking her to go to the Beacon. \n\n\nAs Edmund discovered that Cassie was not in the room, Cassie went to the Beacon in time to see a fax arrive -- the papers that stated the charges against Edmund. \n\n\nEveryone was getting ready for Harley's big day in court. After she quietly watched her friends and family, Harley went to her office, where Gus was staying. Gus wasn't there, and Harley sat down to write him a note. In the note, she told him that she was accepting the plea bargain and would be sent to jail for ten years. In the letter, she told him not to put his life on hold for her, and told him to stay close to her family in an attempt to help. She wanted him to make a new life for himself. \n\n\nSuddenly, Gus entered and asked Harley if she was taking the coward's way out. He then glanced at her letter and was upset that she was writing him a \"Dear John\" letter. Gus told her that he was staying with her. Wherever she was sent, he'd make a life near her. Harley didn't want that and told Gus he had to walk out of her life. She couldn't live with anything else. Gus told her that he wouldn't be in court that day, and Harley left. \n\n\nAs Frank was preparing to go to court, a policeman interrupted and told him there was an important matter he needed to attend to on 5th Street. When Frank got there, he learned that someone had been caught robbing a store. The robber told Frank he wanted to make a deal. Frank was not interested until the man mentions that he had been there the night that guy had been killed at Company. \n\n\nAt the courthouse, Reva told Jeffrey she had gotten the papers. He again told her to take her time before she filed the papers. A little later, Reva discovered that the papers were gone and figured out that Jonathan had taken them. \n\n\nHarley arrived at the courthouse and was shocked to see that Gus was there after all. When the judge asked Harley if she was ready to finalize the plea, Harley hesitated. Gus tried again to get her to change her mind, but she told the judge she was ready. Just as she was ready to plead guilty, Frank rushed in. He told the judge there was new evidence -- a witness could testify that not only had Phillip been alive when Harley had left Company, but he hadn't even been shot yet. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "Knowing this could be her final day of freedom, Harley seeks out those she holds dear. Watching them from a distance, she observes the precious moments, knowing they are going to have to last her a long time. But when she sits down to write a \"\"Dear John\"\" note to Gus, he catches her and confronts her about her desire for him to move on. She insists it's what's right but neither of them really believe it, and when he shows up at court she doesn't send him away. Later, when she stands before the judge ready to take her deal, she's stunned when everyone else shows up and she realizes she has to say out loud that she killed Phillip. Harley's ready to change her plea when Frank arrives. He reveals that a new witness has turned up, one who will swear that Phillip was alive when Harley left Company that fateful night.
