She doesn't think Gus should cover for Alan, but she doesn't think Gus should turn his father in either.  She suggests a third alternative--convince Alan to make a deal with the D.A.  She suggests that they could use Alan in their investigation of Antimonius/Delirium.  The one downside is if Alan should refuse to give access to the Spaulding files,  that could tell Gus something that he doesn't want to know.At the police station, Jeffrey is interrogating Josh.  He tells him that they found new evidence at the scene-- -footprints belonging to a woman wearing designer shoes.  Jeffrey thinks those prints belong to Marah but Josh denies that Marah was there that night.  Jeffrey warns Josh that Frank will figure out himself that those prints belong to Marah and will issue a warrant to search the museum.  He asks Josh to explain why Marah's been so freaked out lately, as if she was suffering from post-traumatic disorder.  Jeffrey wonders what has her so traumatized.  He figures Marah either saw Josh shoot Carrie, or she shot her herself.  Josh tries to explain away Marah's condition by telling Jeffrey about all the stress Marah has had in the past year, but he's not buying it. Josh warns Jeffrey that going after Marah, in the face of Josh's own confession, could hurt Jeffrey professionally, not to mention emotionally. At the museum with Reva, Michelle, and Marina, an agitated Marah has a flashback of the night Carrie died.  Marah's ravings about someone having a gun lead Reva to conclude that Marah was at the Fairgrounds the night of the murder, but Marah denies it.  She then goes off to get some rest.  Reva then suddenly remembers that she called Marina the night of the murder but no one answered.  Why was that if they were home?  Michelle tries to shrug it off by saying that they were so engrossed in the movie they were watching that they must not have heard it.  Skeptical, Reva rushes out and heads to the police station. When she lets on to Frank that she wants to talk to Buzz and Ed, he warns her against conducting her own investigation.  Reva tries to grill Frank about what they found at the Fairgrounds but he can't say.  Ignoring Frank's advice to stay out of it, Reva goes to the Fairgrounds herself and has a vision of Marah shooting Carrie!  Meanwhile, at the museum, Marina speculates to Michelle that perhaps Marah did shoot Carrie.  Though Michelle is skeptical, Marina doesn't think it's a stretch that Josh is covering for Marah.  Just then Marah returns to the room saying that she keeps getting images from that night but can't piece them together.  She sees Josh and Carrie struggling for the gun and then sees Carrie getting shot.  It suddenly dawns on her, what if SHE shot Carrie?  Michelle tries to reassure Marah that she didn't shoot Carrie; she's just feeling guilty.  But Marah finally realizes the truth and heads off to the police station and confesses! \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Reva comes to visit Marah but when Marah gets a look at the drawing of Carrie's ring in Reva's purse, it sparks disturbing memory fragments for her and she's at a loss to make sense of them. Reva's alerted by Marah's behavior and when Marah, lost in thoughts of the night of the shooting, calls out a warning to Josh, Reva becomes suspicious that Marah wasn't home the night Carrie was killed \u0096 despite what she and the other girls claim. Marah is more confused than ever about what went on in the funhouse and as Reva goes to the fairgrounds to investigate, Marah slips out of the house. Just as Reva gets a vision confirming her worst fear \u0096 that Marah was there that night and pulled the trigger, Marah arrives at the police station, and tells Josh and Jeffrey she refuses to have Josh take the rap for what she did. Before her arrival, Jeffrey uses information that Frank's forensics team has culled to try to get Josh to admit that Marah was in the funhouse that night, but Josh stands his ground. He tells Jeffrey that he should drop his investigation before he discovers something he doesn't want to learn. At Harley's, Gus is torn about what to do with the bombshell Alan's dropped in his lap and Harley offers an idea. At first she had trouble getting through to him but after Frank drops by, Gus realizes he can't turn Alan in. Harley assures him that he doesn't have to and pitches an idea for Alan to cut a deal and help with the investigation, as a way of atoning for what he did 30 years ago. Later, Gus approaches Alan with that plan.",
