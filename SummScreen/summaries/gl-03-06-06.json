They find Alan-Michael in her office and Vanessa warns her that he is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Vanessa hears about how Dinah pushed Mallet and Harley to work together and warns her that may have been a mistake. When Dinah gets upset, Vanessa just says she is an overprotective mother. Harley and Mallet get a call from the Foxwood Lodge saying that a note from Gus has been found. They go to check it out and Harley says that although the handwriting is shaky it is Gus's. Harley reads the note, which says goodbye to Harley and Mallet comforts her. Alan-Michael tips Dinah off to where Mallet and Harley are and when she calls, the owner says that they are \"behind closed doors\". Sandy calls Jeffrey and tells him he is leaving town. Jeffrey sees his suitcase and later gets a phone call that Sandy boarded a plane. He and Cassie start to make love but she pulls away remembering the time in San Cristobel. Thinking that Jonathan is going to propose, Tammy tells Cassie that if she has to chose between the two of them she will pick her husband, Jonathan. Cassie tells her that she is in for a life of everyone pointing and staring and Marina steps in and asks Tammy if this is what she really wants. Once Tammy says she wants to marry Jonathan, Marina steps in and tells her to call her if she needs a bridesmaid, and pulls Cassie away. Tammy goes to the fish shack where she finds candles, a wedding dress, and a note to tear up her invitation to her wedding with Sandy. She complies and when she hears someone she tells Jonathan that everything is perfect, only it's not Jonathan, it is Sandy dressed in a tux with a bouquet of flowers. Jonathan shows up at the hotel where he has set up his surprise and is surprised that Tammy isn't there."
