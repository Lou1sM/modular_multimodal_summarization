The Coopers send up applause and hoots of relief as Alan storms the bench and accuses Frank of staging a last ditch effort to save his sister. Jeffrey tells the judge the timing of the information is suspect and he wants to continue with the plea deal. The judge agrees the timing is suspicious but orders Frank to deliver the witness to her chambers for questioning and informs Gus and the DA that Harley's acceptance of the plea agreement still stands. Alan, upset, tells Jeffrey the last minute appearance of a new witness is a trick by Gus to stall Harley's jail sentence. The DA agrees it may be true but asks Alan if he cares at all if Phillip's real killer is brought to justice. \n\n\nLater, at Harleys Angels, Gus wants to celebrate the news but Harley agrees with the DA and the judge that the witness is just too uncanny a coincidence. Gus doesn't listen and asks Harley why she lied about remembering killing Phillip. Harley confesses she made a deal with Alan to leave Zack in her family's care while she was in prison. She surprises Gus by telling him she will probably take the plea deal regardless of what information the witness has because a jury may not find his story plausible. Gus makes Harley agree to give him two days to investigate before she accepts the deal. \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Cassie discovers the fax Jonathan sent from the DA's office charging Edmund with starting the fire in the barn.

Jeffrey tells her she should ask her husband. Cassie is upset but admits she can't ask Edmund because he may not tell her the truth. When Jeffrey doesn't deny the allegations, Cassie asks why he waited so long to file charges and is shocked to find it was Reva who filed the case with the DA's office. Jeffrey tries to comfort Cassie and tells her all he 'ever wanted' was for her to be happy. \n\n\nReva discovers Jonathan and Dinah kissing to celebrate what they hope is the impending break-up of Cassie and Edmund's marriage. Reva is disgusted by her son's choice in women and insults Dinah, who only caresses Jonathan one last time before leaving. Once alone, Reva berates Jonathan for sending the fax to Cassie because it was up to her to decide what to do with the case. Jonathan is unmoved and tells his mother he only did what had to be done to save his aunt from the 'Prince of Darkness.' Reva is afraid Cassie will be furious with her and Edmund may do worse. Jonathan assures her he won't let Edmund put a hand on her. Reva is not convinced Jonathan will be able to stop him when he finds out what they've done. \n\n\nAt Company, Coop is elated with the developments in his sister's case and hugs Lizzie.
