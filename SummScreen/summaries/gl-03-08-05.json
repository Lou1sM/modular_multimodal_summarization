He is obviously upset about what she has learned.  He claims it was an accident and that he overreacted.  Cassie doesn't understand why, if it was an accident, Edmund didn't tell her about it.  \"I trusted you!

She leaves the room and hides as he peers out the apartment door to follow her.  He retreats back to the room and Cassie listens as he ransacks the apartment in anger. \n\n\n",
