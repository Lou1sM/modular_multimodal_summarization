When Gus doesn't think that Alan is looking, takes the pill. Harley questions Beth about the key she found and when her heart rate spikes at the questions tells Mallet that she knows something about Gus. Dinah tells Beth that she will have a place at the Spaulding mansion for as long as she is in charge. As Beth \"escapes\" from the hospital, Dinah, Harley, and Mallet all follow her. Cassie runs into Josh and Reva at Company and blames Reva for the fact that Jonathan and Tammy may be married and that they are missing. Reva points out that Cassie was the one who pushed Tammy away. When Cassie admits that she and Jeffrey are \"taking a break\", Josh admits he had something to do with their problems. He later tells Reva that her little speech on destiny before her accident may be true since the day of her accident he took a different way home which is how he came upon the crash site to save her. Jonathan comes back to find out that Tammy left the room where he made her promise to stay. He is disheveled and Tammy worries about what he has done.
