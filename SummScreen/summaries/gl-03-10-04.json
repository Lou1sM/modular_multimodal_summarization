Just then Marah wakes up and makes plans to return to her place, but her parents convince her to move back home; into the pool house.  Later, while getting the pool house ready for Marah, an angry Shayne lashes out at Josh because no one told him what was going on.  Shayne notes that he did nothing while his family was in trouble, but Josh disagrees. He says that Shayne's recovery taught everyone not to give in to adversity. Later, Marina arrives and  relates her story to Shayne.  At first, he thinks that she kept the secret from him because she thought he was too weak; she couldn't trust him.  Marina denies it and goes on further, telling Shayne about the rings.  She tells him how she had wished that he'd walk again.  Seeing her in tears, he gently tells her that it wasn't magic that made him walk again; it was her.  Back at the house, Reva gets a visit from Cassie and Edmund who've come to console Reva.  When Reva relates that Jeffrey has helped Marah by refusing to let her incriminate herself, Cassie's very impressed and decides to call him and thank him.  Suddenly, Edmund jumps up and tells Cassie that that's a bad idea since it could backfire on her since some times she rubs Jeffrey the wrong way. Reva agrees that they should leave well enough alone and asks Edmund to keep Cassie away from O'Neill.  Later, at the Beacon, Edmund is unnerved to overhear Cassie trying to call the D.A.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",
