    "tvmega_recap": "Reva recognizes Jeffrey's concern for her daughter and directs him to the pool house. There, Marina has returned to comfort Marah and tell her that she's denying herself the human contact (Jeffrey) she needs. Marah can't help blaming herself for being used by Carrie, for naively doing exactly what Carrie wanted her to do. When Jeffrey appears, Marah's first impulse is to send him away. But he fights through her defenses, urging her to see herself as he sees her; brave, not weak, strong, not gullible. His words and his love are able to soothe her and Marah falls asleep in his arms. Josh begins the day handing the reins of power at Lewis Construction over to Bill on a permanent basis. Bill is ready for the challenge. For his part, Josh is ready to devote himself fully to his family, now more than ever. But when he shows up at Reva's house with his toothbrush, she isn't sure if this is a visit or a more lasting arrangement. She is overjoyed when Josh brings in the rest of his baggage and says that he's here to stay. Harley tries to get Buzz to talk about the events at the fairgrounds. Carrie may be dead, but Harley believes the evil lives after her. Buzz doesn't want to talk about it and wishes that the whole thing could just be over. But when Marina provides some missing details of Carrie's dirty tricks, the cave in, the razor blade and the gas leak, Harley becomes more convinced that her family needs the kind of protection Harley's Angels was meant to provide. Now, if only she could work a miracle for Gus and have Alan call to accept the deal that Gus offered him.",
