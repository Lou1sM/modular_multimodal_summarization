She explains that Alan is determined that someone will pay for Phillip's death, if it's not Harley, it could be her. Jonathan offers to help her with Alan but she quickly declines and tells her she'll take care of it. Her plan is to follow Webster around so she can see if he's a credible witness. Before he leaves, Jonathan warns her that it's \"every man for himself\" and \"get them before they get you.\" Later, Olivia spots Webster doing something and takes a picture with her cell phone. \n\nAt Company, Buzz is reminding Harley to sign a permission slip for Zach. It would state that Harley will help chaperone a field trip next month. Harley's reluctant since for all she knows, she'll be in jail next month. Buzz tries to encourage her not to give up hope, but she's not too convinced. Meanwhile, although the pair were supposed to watch movies tonight, Buzz tells her he can't make it but has found a substitute---Gus. Gus enters with flowers in hand. Harley seems happy to see Gus, who states that he doesn't like to use the word \"date\", he's calling this a \"strategy session.\" Gus and Harley then enjoy dinner in the parking garage. (as if they were on a stakeout) Before their \"strategy session\" is over, Harley kisses Gus. When he takes her back to Company, a happy Harley is ready to sign the Zach's permission slip and tells Buzz that she has to believe that she'll have a life. \n\nJosh sees Cassie outside Company. She's trying to clear her head and figure out how she can ever trust Edmund again. Josh reminds her that this isn't the first time she's doubted Edmund. He suggests that she's always wondered if his change was permanent; perhaps she's always been waiting for the other shoe to drop. Cassie doesn't think he's just talking about Edmund--he's talking about Reva too. Josh advises Cassie to wait a bit. Have the embryos frozen and wait things out. Later, after a run-in with Jonathan when she figures out that he's the one who set it up so she'd learn the truth, Cassie goes to Farley's to have a drink and is shocked to see Jeffrey there singing with a band. \n\nEdmund is at the Beacon, trying to locate Cassie but she's not answering any of his messages. Suddenly, he sees Reva and demands she tell him where Cassie is. Reva won't tell him though and he starts to blame her for everything. This gets Reva mad and she reminds him that this was all his fault. When Edmund accuses her of taking his life, his wife, and his child, Reva lashes back, reminding him that he did the same to her. At that point, Josh walks in and breaks up the argument. After Edmund walks out, Josh lays into Reva for tearing Cassie's life apart. Reva tries to defend her actions, saying she was trying to protect her sister, but Josh tells her he thinks this was all about revenge. She wasn't trying to protect Cassie; she was trying t punish Edmund. At that, Reva gets visibly upset and tries to defend her actions. She tries to tell him that she's having problems being in control, that her moods are getting the best of her. But Josh isn't very sympathetic and tells her to get in control. Reva tells him it's not that easy. She knows she's driving everyone away. She ten tells him she doesn't know who she is any more and needs time to figure it out. A little later, Jonathan comes across Reva outside drinking. He tells her that he thinks she did the right thing and suggests that she have fun tonight. Reva is all for it and she and Jonathan go to a bar to party. In the meantime, Josh has gone to Company to get some advice from Buzz. He needs to know if Buzz ever feels stifled by his life now; does the man he is now conflict with the man he used to be. Buzz figures out Josh is talking about Reva and simply tells Josh to hold down the fort. Josh replies that that gets hard after a while. \n\nAfter refusing Jeffrey's apology for being harsh the other day, Dinah comes across Edmund who is still trying to call Cassie. When Edmund sees Dinah, he angrily accuses her of being the one to tell Reva about the fire, but she denies it. He seems to believe her and is despondent over losing Cassie. Dinah tries to console Edmund by telling him that she knows what he's going through---she too lost everything once. Edmund brushes off Dinah though. Later, he's overjoyed when the fertility clinic calls and tells him his wife is waiting for the in-vitro procedure. When Edmund arrives at the hospital, he's shocked to see who's there---Dinah. \n\n\n\n",

Distraught, Reva leaves to clear her head but when she runs into Jonathan, he helps her to forget her troubles and enjoy the moment by setting her up to dance with a handsome stranger. Meanwhile, Cassie faces one of the biggest decisions of her life, whether or not to go through with the IVF procedure.
