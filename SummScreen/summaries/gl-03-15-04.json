She suggests they're from Alexandra, congratulating him on his new position at Lewis Construction.  She stops Bill from calling to thank Alex, saying she'll do it later on his behalf.  Outside Company, Michelle promises Danny she's going to put all her energy into being the best mayoral candidate's wife.  They stop Eden to congratulate her on her boyfriend's good fortune, but Michelle notices Eden's rush to get away.  Danny suggests Eden is intimidated by Bill's first love.  When Bill exits Company, they see he is happy about running the family business, but he is still committed to seeing Danny in the mayor's office.  After he leaves, Michelle expresses her concern over Ross' encouraging poll numbers.  What if Danny loses the election?  Danny makes his wife promise him an election night date so that no matter what the votes, he still wins.\n\n\nIn Tony's room at the Beacon, Eden complains that just when things were going well for her and Bill, Vinny Salerno sends her flowers \u2013 apparently he is pleased with her taste in men.  With Bill running one of Springfield's largest businesses, Salerno thinks he's got leverage on the former madam.  Tony doesn't see why Eden is so upset; this is simply Vinny's way of reminding her that she's still his girl.  If she gets upset, she is just doing what Vinny wants \u2013 it's what he does best.  Tony warns her that she can have the perfect life with Bill, but she can't leave her past behind.  Eden starts to cry and leaves, sorry she came to him for help.  Bill surprises Eden in the lobby.  She says she has a headache and cancels on their celebration night.  Bill understands when she leaves for home, but looks at the engagement ring he'd planned to give her with disappointment.\n\n\nMarah calls O'Neill's cell but Reva hangs up the phone before he answers.  She warns her daughter that a relationship with the DA in her murder case is risky.  Marah defends Jeffrey's softer side - the egotistical Jeffrey they all know is just a front so that he can do his job.  He promised to protect her and she believes he will.  Looking to Cassie for backup, Reva is defeated when her sister agrees with Marah.  She too has seen a different side of Jeffrey O'Neill, but in the same breath she warns her niece to be careful.  Marah knows the risks, but if she has to stop seeing the man she truly cares about, that will be just what Carrie wanted.  Marah won't let Carrie win.  After Marah leaves the room, Reva admits that Carrie has already won \u2013 she's succeeded in ruining lives even after her death.  Suddenly, the image of Maryanne appears outside the study window.  Cassie suggests Reva call Dr. Langham, but Reva already told him about seeing Maryanne's ghost.  He was pleased she has reached this level of ESP.  Reva wonders why she sees Maryanne whenever Marah is in trouble \u2013 it's as if Maryanne wants to help her.  Cassie jokingly suggests Maryanne contact her now deceased aunt and convince her to make things right and clear Marah's name.  The thought inspires Reva to visit the fairgrounds \u2013 the place where both Caruthers women died.  Maybe there she will understand the message Maryanne is trying to send.\n\n\nAt the Beacon, a reporter probes O'Neill for info.  The public, he says, is starting to doubt the DA's abilities to serve justice.  In fact, O'Neill's objectivity in the Caruthers case is in question.  Jeffrey squeezes the back of the man's neck and drags him to the couch, warning that if anything about him is printed in the paper without proof, he will be sorry.  The reporter understands and leaves. O'Neill calls Rick in the crime lab about Marah's blood test.  He needs to know what time the Antimonius was taken, the dosage, anything ASAP.\n\n\nAt the Beacon Dax gives Edmund a photo and documents.  The former prince cannot believe what he sees and advises Dax to forget the info as well.  Outside the Beacon, O'Neill asks Edmund why he called, wanting to see him.  Edmund urges the DA to do right by Marah Lewis, but neglects to say more.  Jeffrey sees Marah's number on his cell and calls it.  Marah confides that she merely wanted to hear Jeffrey's voice.  He admits Reva was right \u2013 they shouldn't talk unless it is safe; people may overhear.  O'Neill is handed a copy of the newspaper, the headline reading: \"DA Covers for Murdering Mistress.\"  On tv, Marah hears the Springfield Journal reporting that she is the latest suspect in the Caruthers murder case, and she and the DA are romantically involved which may explain why no charges have been filed.\n\n\nAt Company, Edmund shows the photo to Cassie who is shocked to see Jeffrey O'Neill in uniform.  Edmund explains that the military was just a cover for the CIA.  A blonde woman and another man in uniform also appear in the photo.  Cassie recognizes the man as Dr. Christopher Langham.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Reva discovers Marah attempting to make contact with Jeffrey and intervenes. She is worried that even though Marah's yet to be charged, she risks compromising herself by appearing too close to the man who will be in charge of her case. Marah defends Jeffrey, assuring Reva that she feels safe if he tells her she is. Desperate to do something to help Marah, Reva goes to the fairgrounds after getting another vision of Maryanne Caruthers beckoning to her. As she makes her way around the deserted area, she hears a noise behind her. Jeffrey calls Marah and the longing they feel is evident. Jeffrey begins to tell her that it will all end soon, but it's at that moment that he's approached by an assistant with a newspaper. Marah turns on the television and they get the news at the same time: Marah's been named as the new suspect \u0096 and Jeffrey's been accused of covering up for her. Edmund meets with Dax who has a surprise photo for him stemming from Edmund's request to look into Jeffrey's past. Edmund's clearly troubled by what he sees and tracks down Cassie to show her the photo of a younger Jeffrey in military uniform with two others, similarly dressed, and one of them is Christopher. Eden gets flowers from Vinnie Salerno congratulating her on Bill's rise to the top. She covers with Bill and makes a beeline for Tony to ask his advice. But Tony, in a flash of anger, tells her that if she ever thought she was out of the mob life because something better came along, she was dreaming.",
