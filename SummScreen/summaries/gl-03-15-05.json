Jonathan walks into Josh's office and informs him that Reva is dancing the night away with another man and is having a great time.  Jonathan clearly enjoys delivering this news!  Josh is not fazed by this, however.  He knows his wife well and he refuses to be sucked into Jonathan's taunts.  It's just as well -- because moments later a very drunk Reva enters the room.  She is in too good a mood for Josh, who does not want to talk about where she has been.  Reva won't let well enough alone, however, and as she gets another drink for herself, Josh tells her that she is pulling away from the family -- everyone, that is, but Jonathan.  They fight over why Reva insisted that Cassie should know that Edmund set the fire which almost called RJ and Jeffrey.  Reva has a breakthrough and realizes that her anger and guilt about giving up Jonathan has manifested itself into anger against Edmund.  He was, after all, the reason she was forced to give her son away.  But the discovery scares her.  \"I thought I was doing the right thing -- now I don't know.\"\n\n\nTammy set out to look for Jonathan and found him in the Lewis office building's parking garage.

Jonathan begins to cry.\n\n\nThe doctor tells Edmund and Dinah that everything looks good and that Dinah may well be pregnant.  Edmund, however, begins to have second thoughts. He says this decision may have been the biggest mistake of his life.  He thinks that Cassie will never forgive him for giving Dinah their embryos.  Dinah offers to \"get lost\" so that Edmund and Cassie can get back together.  Edmund is not sure what to do.  He tells Dinah to go home and they would talk the next day.  However, after a few drinks in a bar, Edmund goes to see Dinah.  She is asleep in her bed -- he tenderly tucks her in.\n\n\n",
