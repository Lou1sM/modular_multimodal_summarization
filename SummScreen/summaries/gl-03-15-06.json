    "tvmega_recap": "Cassie is relived to find out that Jonathan and Tammy aren't married but blames Jonathan for what happened at the cliff with Sandy. She \"kidnaps\" Tammy and leaves Jonathan at the cliff with Josh. Cassie takes Tammy to the dump that they lived in when Tammy was first born and tries to show her what she thinks will happen to her if she stays with Jonathan. Cassie then takes her back to the farm where she has done Tammy's room up like it was when she was a kid. Tammy tells her mom that she sees where she is coming from about Jonathan and that she knows she needs to change her life. Jonathan figures out what Cassie is up to and realizes that Josh is keeping him busy while Cassie talks to Tammy. He leaves to find Tammy. Once Cassie leaves her alone in her room, Tammy escapes out the window but when Cassie, who is waiting outside for her surprises her, falls and hurts her ankle. Cassie takes her to the hospital, but instead of taking her to the emergency room, locks her in the morgue with Sandy's body. Jonathan finds her and as Tammy freaks out about how Sandy's death was her fault, Jonathan opens up that he was the one who kept Ava and Sandy from getting a divorce and had Sandy arrested at Tammy and Sandy's wedding."
