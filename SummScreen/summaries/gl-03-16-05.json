Jeffrey attempts to question Olivia regarding the new evidence. However, she denies any knowledge and moves away only to be confronted by Bill. Olivia claims she only did it to protect Emma, only to discover Bill knows she sold the Lewis Construction Building, not that she provided Alan with new evidence. \n\n\nInside the court room, Gus reassures Harley and calls Rick to the stand. Admitting he attacked Phillip in the days before the murder, Rick denies he killed Phillip and is released from the stand to be replaced by Beth. When confronted with a credit card receipt for a Paris hotel room, Beth admits she was planning to run away with Phillip and the children whom he had kidnapped. After being released from the stand, Beth follows Rick out to the hallway where she apologizes. Rick accuses her of stealing his son, something he would never do to her. As Olivia is called to testify, Bill tells her this is her chance to prove her loyalty to him and not Alan. Admitting she said she hoped Phillip would die and is glad he is dead, Olivia begins to cry as she explains that Harley, Beth, Rick and she had been terrorized by Phillip when he kidnapped their children. She had feared for Emma's safety while in his care. Returning to her seat, Olivia asks Bill if the tears helped sway the jury. Finally, Jack Webster is called to the stand where he testifies he saw Phillip alive after Ruth Karloff left Company. Following this testimony, Jeffrey has no questions for him and instead calls Gus to the stand. \n\n\nAt Company with Alexandra, Lizzie insists she only pretended to like Coop. Alexandra attempts to convince Lizzie not to let Alan tell her who to care about. Lizzie announces that Alexandra is right, stating she can make Coop over into a man of whom her grandfather will approve. Lizzie then goes over to Coop and introduces him to Sam Rawlins, a restaurant consultant. Lizzie explains that Coop has worked in some of the best restaurants in London, and goes on about how important his opinion is. Stepping away from Sam, Coop accuses Lizzie of lying about him and demands to know what her motives are. Going back to Sam, Lizzie questions him about closing the boarding house and expanding Company upstairs. \n\n\nReva meets with Edmund and tells him he is the reason Cassie has run away. Edmund attempts to reassure her by saying he only wants to know that she is safe. He states that in a few days she may be willing to listen to him. \n\n\nEdmund leaves to see Dinah. He walks into her hotel room to find Jonathan attempting to kiss her and Dinah pushing him away. Edmund grabs Jonathan and threatens him should he do anything to harm his family. After Jonathan leaves the room, Edmund presents Dinah with a contract and offers to pay her for carrying the baby. Dinah turns down the money, but agrees to sign the contract, insisting she is trying to do the right thing. \n\n\nIn the lobby Jonathan runs into Reva, who has been trying to reach him. After going shopping together, Jonathan questions the things Reva bought, such as a toaster. Reva tells Jonathan she bought these items to help him get set up in his own place as he can no longer stay with her and Joshua. Reva confides she does not like the person she is around him, and while she loves him she needs time for her family and friends. As Reva leaves, Jonathan tears up pictures of the two of them together and throws them on the ground. Beginning to cry, he picks the pieces up and gets in the car to leave. \n\n\n",
