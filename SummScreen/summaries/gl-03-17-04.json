    "tvmega_recap": "Reva comes home anxious to help after learning about the blowup in the newspapers. Christopher comes over and tells her she can't force a connection to Maryanne. Reva feels a ticking clock and can't wait for this damn ghost. Marah retreats to the pool house where Marina and Michelle are waiting. The girls are all affected by their journey with Carrie. But most of all, Marah's missing Jeffrey, worried for him. Josh is startled when a pink envelope, from Carrie, is delivered to him at home. Meanwhile Jeffrey is at the police station. Gus comes upon him as he ponders shredding the evidence. He talks Jeffrey out of it, but then Jeffrey switches gears, firing Gus because he's been compromised at Spaulding as an operative. Gus, understanding Jeffrey's position, gives him the keys to his car so he can go see Marah, unnoticed. At the Spaulding office, Alex and Alan cross. He's angry and frustrated and takes the news of the mob's involvement with Antimonius out on her, even accusing her of knowing about it. But she knows his frustration is over his falling out with Gus and tells him so. She subtly works Alan and when Gus arrives, he's less willing to reconcile than he might have been otherwise. Gus quits and Alan does nothing to stop him.",
