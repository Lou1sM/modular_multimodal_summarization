Josh tells them it is a landmark and can't come down, much to Marah's delight. Phil and Olivia talk over breakfast. He tells her he is willing to help her even if it means sending Alan to jail. Gus wonders about being a Spaulding. Gus puts 2 and 2 together and goes to confront Alex and Lucia who is there talking to Alex. Gus confronts Alex about being his mother. Alan meets Lucia and thinks they have met before (duh!!) Olivia shares her dream with Phil of having this baby and a good man to love. Wealth and power aren't everything. Alan interrupts and they argue. He leaves and drops his phone. Phil picks it up and they realize that it is Olivia's phone, or at least one that looks like hers and is programmed to act like hers. The smoking gun just showed up."
