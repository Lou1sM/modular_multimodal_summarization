During his examination, Jeffrey produces the photo that shows Gus and Webster in a conversation in the alley the night before Webster's testimony. Jeffrey then pulls out the big guns and presents evidence that Gus knew Webster back in Chicago and knew that he could beat a lie detector test. Suddenly, all of Webster's testimony clearing Harley is thrown into doubt. A recess is called and Gus confesses to Harley that he did in fact recruit Webster on purpose. Refusing to give up, Gus believes that the jury may still be on her side and wants to ride out the storm. But an unconvinced Harley knows that's not enough to set her free and demands that Gus put her on the stand. Meanwhile, Olivia watches as the evidence she supplied about Gus's late-night meeting with Webster plays out in the courtroom. When Bill questions how Jeffrey got this evidence, Olivia keeps quiet as Alan watches closely nearby. But Alan, always ready to stir the pot, arranges for Bill to see the picture on Olivia's cell phone, confirming for Bill that it was Olivia who betrayed Harley. \n\n\nEdmund's ready to give Dinah a shot but unexpectedly finds her stripped to her skivvies for the event. Seeing he's uncomfortable she offers to have a nurse do the procedure but Edmund puts aside his feelings and gets to work. Right after the procedure, Edmund's ready to split but Dinah tries to guilt him into staying with her, saying she needs to shop for maternity clothes. Edmund agrees to help \u2013 but surprises her when he summons a woman from the consulate to accompany Dinah to the mall. Leaving them alone, he goes home, missing Cassie terribly and praying he's made the right decision. Later, there's a knock at the door but when he opens it, hoping to find Cassie, he finds Dinah instead, who claims she's unwell. Holly sees Sebastian comforting Beth and finds herself a little jealous. She finds herself curious about his motives and his claims to being a changed man so she proposes a deal whereby she'd chronicle his return to Springfield and write about what it's like to turn your life around. Holly claims her curiosity is purely journalistic but Sebastian wonders if there isn't more to the story. \n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Webster's testimony is damaged when Jeffrey puts Gus on the stand and shows him a picture taken of him and Webster in the parking garage the night before. Jeffrey also reveals that Gus knew Webster in Chicago. Moreover, Webster is schooled in beating lie detector tests. Gus tells Harley that he set it all up. He knew they were losing the case, and he had to do something. Gus wants to rest the case, but Harley refuses to let him. She wants to take the stand. Edmund gives Dinah her first fertility shot. Dinah has a nightmare about Edmund taking the baby away from her. She shows up to Edmund's claiming she is sick, and he jumps at the chance to take care of her. Beth apologizes to Edmund for being so hard on him when they were together. She now understands how a person can have such extreme reactions, as she did with Phillip. Edmund calls Cassie and asks her to come home. Tammy, Sandy, and Marina talk about the trial and the \"good news\" that is supposed to come. Tammy vows that she is turning over a new leaf and that she wants more control. This will start with her finding a new place to live. Beth and Sebastian meet and sparks fly. Holly tells Sebastian that she wants to write a story about his starting over. He agrees to let her, only if she helps him with information about Spaulding. Bill discovers the picture of Webster and Gus on Olivia's cell phone and confronts her. Rick vows to never forgive Beth for her betrayal.",
