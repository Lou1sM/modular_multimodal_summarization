Ava tells him that he used her and tells him that she won't help him. Coop tells Lizzie it is over and she accuses him of sleeping with Ava. When Ava comes back inside Lizzie tells Ava to go back to Sandy and Ava dumps a milkshake over her head. Coop and Ava get closer. Reva prepares a memorial service for Sandy and Josh brings her a box of his things, including a letter. Josh badmouths Jonathan for Sandy's demise and Billy stands up for Jonathan, which causes Reva to leave. Josh accuses Billy of using this to get closer to Reva. Reva goes to the farm where Cassie happily tells her that Tammy is back home and fills her in on what Jonathan did. Jonathan goes to Tammy's school and breaks in on a lecture to convince Tammy to go home with him. Tammy tells him that she will probably always love him but she can't be with him."
