Olivia doesn't understand why his medication isn't working. Her broker calls with news that Spaulding stock is falling. When Lizzie returns, Phillip tells her he was wrong; there is no baby. After she leaves, Phillip takes the hidden pills from his tissue box and dumps them in an envelope in his briefcase. Then he consults a To Do list, promising not to mention the baby to his family. He vows to do something \"very special\" for Olivia, too. When she returns, Olivia rips the page that says \"No Baby!\" from Phillip's notepad. He says the only way he'll remember is to have it written down, but Olivia is afraid someone may see it and become suspicious. \n\nAlan can't believe his son accused him of working with the mob. Alex shows him the stock report - down 20 points - but Alan refuses to sell. He tells his sister to stay away from Brad Green. Gus cleans out his office at Spaulding Enterprises as Alex scolds him for hurting Alan. Gus accuses her of being behind the Antimonious scandal but Alex thinks he's just trying to settle an old score - her keeping the truth about his father a secret for 30 years. Olivia arrives to find Gus has quit and tries out Phillip's desk chair, much to Alex's dismay. When alone, Olivia asks Gus the real reason for leaving, but he changes the subject to Phillip, who probably has no idea what his new wife is up to. As a Spaulding board member, Olivia inquires about the latest scandal, knowing Gus is keeping something from her. He wants to protect Phillip so he tells her to figure it out for herself. Brad pretends to be disappointed Gus is leaving and asks Alex if the other rumor is true - is Spaulding being investigated? Alex denies the rumor, in the same breath offering a trade - she will give him full reign of Antimonious if he gives her control of Bad Girl. Brad realizes what she's doing - trying to distance herself from him before the feds come. He promises sarcastically to protect her just as well as she protected him. Alex calls her broker and tells him to sell. Brad does the same. Alan tells his broker to sell, but only a few shares... Olivia realizes they're dumping stock and tells her broker to buy it all. \n\nMarah is relieved to see Jeffrey at the pool house, even though he tells her she's in danger. He's recused himself from her case; Doris Wolf is in charge now. Marah knows Doris holds a grudge against Reva and Jeffrey. She will use their relationship against Marah in court. Jeffrey says they can't see each other anymore; it will only hurt her case. He warns her not to talk to the press and to listen to her lawyer. Marah refuses to forget about him just because of a stupid tabloid. When Jeffrey takes her in his arms, someone sneaks a picture from the window. Jeffrey goes to the door but can't leave. In bed, Jeffrey promises everything will be ok. \n\nJosh opens the pink envelope. The sender claims to have been the one who went to the newspapers about Marah and Jeffrey's relationship. It's Carrie's handwriting and stationary, so Josh assumes she planned this before her death. The letter says \"Maryanne will have her day in court.\" Reva calls Harley who takes the letter as evidence. Josh is convinced now people will see this as proof of Carrie's premeditated plan. Harley isn't so sure, but she thinks she knows whom Carrie hired to deliver the letter. She tells them about the MC Corporation so Josh and Reva pay it a visit. As they're about to break in, Reva suspects it's another of Carrie's traps. Searching the virtually empty office, Reva finds today's newspaper and Carrie's pink stationary in the wastebasket, along with a crossed-off checklist with the five men's addresses on it. When they find a cassette with the tape pulled out, Josh says he can fix it, suspecting it's an instruction tape for Carrie's messenger. At home, they listen to the tape - Carrie's voice instructing someone to send the letters and then to destroy the tape and never come back. Josh thinks this proves Carrie's intentions and hopes it will save Marah. They leave for the police station. \n\nAt the station, Harley commends Gus' decision to leave Spaulding but advises him to wait a while before going back on the streets as a cop. With this new drug out there, the streets are dangerous. But Gus feels he has been swimming with sharks at Spaulding and has the scars to prove it; he's ready.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jeffrey and Marah break from their passionate kiss at the pool house as he informs her Doris Wolfe has taken over the case. Full of loving concern, Jeffrey gives Marah tips on how to testify. Both realize the hardest part of the trial will be staying away from each other. While they agree it's the right course of action, chemistry takes over and they find themselves making love. Josh and Reva react to the arrival of another taunting letter from Carrie. Harley arrives and shares information she's found on MC Corp, a legal business that Carrie created. Josh tracks down its corporate address, and he and Reva go to check it out. At MC Corp, they are stunned to hear Carrie talking, but it is only her voice on tape giving instructions to a law student. Josh, connecting the student to the messenger who brought Carrie's most recent letter, explains to the student his role in possible harassment, and the student eagerly spills to his role as Carrie's agent. It was he who notified the papers about Jeffrey and Marah's relationship. Gus has quit and Alan's feelings are hurt. Alex reprimands Gus but is interrupted by the arrival of Olivia who shares rumors of a Spaulding stock dive. Brad, Alex and Alan are all seen dumping stock by the end of the day and Olivia is pleased at her windfall. But at Ravenwood, we see how Olivia's mere presence angers the agitated Phillip. Harley and Gus meet up at the police station, where she rejoices that finally one of her men got out of Spaulding before it cost him their relationship. But she worries that Gus is going back out on the street to fight drugs.",
