Obviously, it has ruined the romance, so Tammy goes next door to ask her neighbor to turn it down.  Surprise! Her neighbor is Jonathan, who explains to Tammy and to a very suspicious Sandy that things weren't working out with Josh and Reva, so he moved to this apartment.  He swears he didn't know Tammy was next door.  Tammy and Sandy go back to her apartment and try to pick up where they left off.  Their evening is interrupted by a phone call and Sandy must go back to Lewis Oil to complete some business.  Meanwhile, a very drunk Jonathan thinks about calling Reva, but decides that she will be the one to come crawling back begging to him.  He then goes to a bar and tries to pick up a girl.\n\n\nBill is furious and disillusioned with Olivia because she took the photo of Gus talking with the witness who could have exonerated Harley.  She insists she took it and turned it in because she was afraid of what Alan would do to Emma.  Bill doesn't buy it.  He tells Olivia that he doesn't believe it's about Emma, but about Olivia wanting to improve her place in the \"House of Spaulding.\"  Bill leaves in anger, and moments later Alan stomps out of the courtroom.  He is furious about Harley's testimony and threatens Olivia.  Alan tells her that if Harley is acquitted of Phillip's murder, that Olivia's neck is next on the block.\n\n\nGus is reluctant to put Harley on the witness stand, but she sees it as her only chance.  While Jeffrey O'Neill badgers her, trying to get her to confess, Harley has an epiphany and realizes that she could not have killed Phillip.  She denies killing Phillip when Jeffrey asks her outright.  She believes in her heart and soul that she could not have killed her son's father.\n\n\nDuring closing arguments, however, O'Neill points out that Harley had motive, means and opportunity and that she had even confessed to the murder earlier.  Gus, however, reminds the jury that there were at least half a dozen others on the stand who had the same motive, means and opportunity and that the prosecution had not produced convincing evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  He pleaded with the jury to let her go home to her family, where she belonged.\n\n\nLater, Gus apologizes to Harley for letting her down.  She, however, will hear none of it.  She tells him that he believed in her when she didn't believe in herself and that he made her realize she could not be the killer.  And that, Harley told him, is true love.\n\n\n",
