Coming home from a long day at work, Olivia is met by a mess and a peanut butter and jelly covered Emma. She receives flowers from Frank and then when Buzz shows up with her and Emma's food order. Seeing how Olivia is freaking out of things not going to \"the plan\", he tells her to loosen up and be spontaneous. He takes her and Emma out for a fun evening and then later offers to go with her to talk to Emma's teacher. When Olivia's sitter cancels on the night of a big meeting, she calls Buzz to help her out. Buzz asks Olivia if all she wants from a guy is for him to need her. Coop comes over to drop something off for Buzz and offers to watch Emma while Buzz tells Olivia how he really feels. Buzz heads over to Towers to tell her but then gets a phone call that Frank has been shot on the job. It is just a graze on the arm but Frank tells Buzz that this has shown him how he wants to settle down and he wants to do that with Olivia. Buzz backs out and Frank is waiting for Olivia when she comes home. Frank tells Olivia that he wants to be with her and Emma and Olivia contemplates this but her thoughts keep returning to Buzz."
