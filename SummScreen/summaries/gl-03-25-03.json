    "tvmega_recap": "Ben and Marina go to Ben and the gang's new place. Marina wishes that she could live there too and says that she does not like the idea Ben living with one girl (Marah). Shayne and Marah come and join in. Marina and Shayne start flirting as Ben jealously watches. Marina and Shayne turn the radio onto \"Sandy and the mole\". They are talking about Eden's escort service today on their show. Eden comes and hounds Marah about doing her designs. Tony believes that Eden is trying to come between him and Marah. Tony and Marah are cuddling. Bill and Eden meet at the bar.... hmmm.... maybe a new couple? Maybe not. She gives Bill her business card....he asks if she is a florist (Eden's Garden). Michelle and Danny are on and Michelle is yelling. Danny tells her that he loves her. She says that she would love to move into the house that they are at but she is sick of living for Danny... then she finally gives in and she and Danny go inside and they eventually make love. (One of the best NSA and PAS scenes to date!!!) Regina tells Gus and Harley that she will be staying at the boarding house for a while and wants to get to know them both. Gus wants to know who his real father is and demands the truth from Regina. Regina lets the cat out of the bag and tells the truth.... that Alan is Gus' father! And she tells him the story about Brandon not liking her but Alan loving her and how she was fired by Brandon and Alex knew of Regina's pregnancy so she helped her leave without Alan ever knowing about Gus. Michelle proposes to Danny and he says YES!!! All in All... it was a great show.... especially Manny!"
