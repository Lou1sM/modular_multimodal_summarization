When Sandy asks how things are going with Jonathan, Reva replies that she wants to believe that he's trying. She starts talking about how her life's gotten off-track and how Jonathan reminds of herself. To try to cheer her up, Sandy offers to let her hang out with him and Tammy to eat but she declines. She has to visit Jonathan at the hospital. \n\nBut now, Tammy is visiting Jonathan. Though she tries to peek in while he's sleeping, he soon awakens. When she shows concern about his burns, he just shrugs it off. But Tammy can't shrug it off--he saved her life. When Jonathan starts laughing about the scar he'll have, Tammy confides in him about her scar that she got when she was trying to run away from her foster family. Just then Reva enters.

He insists that he had no idea that Tammy was staying at the Clayton Arms; he wasn't stalking her Reva tries to explain her decision to have him move out. She explains that she's cost her too much, too many people she's cared about and she needs to get a grip on her life. He thinks she's cutting him loose but she denies that.

When Edmund answers, Jeffrey points out that he heard a woman's voice--he assumes it was Cassie's. Edmund lies that it was the television and tells Jeffrey that Cassie left him because Jeffrey talked her into it.

When asked what she's doing there, Dinah lies that she's now working as a consultant for Edmund and was just waiting until he was done talking to approach him. Ross, who's there to deliver papers to Edmund, informs Dinah that Vanessa is flying in for a visit and it'd be great for them both to meet her at the airport.

They each talk about their suspicious visitors and Dinah suggests she leave to throw off any suspicion. Edmund doesn't exactly trust Dinah though and tells her to just wait and see if she's pregnant. Dinah's sure of it though and goes to meet her father at the airport. When she's gone, Edmund gets the call confirming Dinah's thoughts--she's pregnant. \n\nDinah arrives at the airport but there's no Vanessa, only Ross.
