Just as the interview is about to start, Olivia waltzes in, introduces herself as Phillip's wife, and begins singing the praises of the Spaulding family to the reporter. She tells the reporter she'll be supporting the family by acting as the Spaulding liaison to the federal investigators. When the reporter leaves, Alan asks to speak to Olivia alone. Before he can berate her though, she tells him she saved them and that they need her. She says they need someone untouched by the investigation to assuage the stockholders' fears. Alan agrees she could be useful and hires her. After she leaves, he tells a worried Alex that Olivia is no danger to them; once Phillip recovers, he'll get rid of her.\n\n\nChristopher tells Reva he's a profiler for the federal government. His job is to assess the psychic talent of other people the government may find useful. Angry at being a guinea pig, Reva refuses Christopher's offer of help saying she can't trust him. Christopher tries to convince her that his offer is sincere; he can help her speak with Maryanne. As he asks her if she's going to let her wounded pride keep her from doing what's best for Marah, Cassie enters with news. When Reva learns Cassie knows the truth about Christopher, she's even more furious since she knows he only told her the truth because he knew Cassie would. When he says he couldn't blow his cover without getting the okay from his superior, Cassie proclaims she knows who that would be: Jeffrey O'Neill. After Christopher leaves, Cassie urges a torn Reva to use her talents and her instincts to help Marah. With that in mind, Reva goes to Carrie's underground room and tells Maryanne to tell her what she knows now.\n\n\nBill and Eden are at the Beacon toasting their engagement. Eden admits she was freaked out at first, but has finally come to accept the engagement. She tells Bill that she's never been as happy as she is now and promises to make him happy.\n\n\nAt the park, Marah refuses to end her relationship with Jeffrey. He tries to tell her the ADA will use their relationship against her and Marah won't be able to handle the cross-examination. Jeffrey tells Marah she needs to convince the court that she loathes him, that he's a sexual predator. Marah says she refuses to lie; she chased him. But Jeffrey says it was all a ruse. He tells her he used her vulnerability, and played hard to get to make it appear it was all her idea. He set her up and she fell for it. He says he helped her at the police station to save his own career in case anyone found out about the affair. But Marah refuses to believe any of it and says it was all her choice. As if in a courtroom, Jeffrey badgers Marah and asks if shooting Carrie was her choice. He wonders if she killed Carrie in cold blood. Upset, Marah breaks down in Jeffrey's arms. His point made, Jeffrey warns her that's what the prosecution is going to do to her and if she reacts like that, it's over. When Marah accuses him of bailing on her, he says it's not about their feelings but her future. And in order for her to have one, they can't. He tells her they need to cut their losses and walk away. When he goes back home, he receives a call on his cell phone. He tells the person on the other end they're ready for Phase II. If they don't act now, they'll lose the big fish at the company and the mob. Back in the park, Marah is ambushed by reporters and rescued by an unlikely person - Tony. \n\n\n",
