Felicia asked Reva if she gave anymore thought to going to Europe and consulting the doctors who dealt with parapsychology, but Reva explained that this would involve her leaving her family for a while, and she's already done that to Josh & the kids enough times. After Josh overheard part of this, he & Reva discussed the situation and how the doctors in Europe would help Reva learn to keep her psychic abilities under control and, in the end, he gave Reva his blessing. Marah was in a snit about her mom being there but Tony reminded her that she used to think her mother was dead, so she changed her tune. In the Spaulding mansion, Lloyd informed Alexandra that Alan never did quite finish his cup of drugged tea. When Alex entered the living room, she was stunned to find Alan standing there with Lucia, who was dressed in a nun's habit. Alan was obviously under the influence of the drug, and with slurred speech, he told Alex they had a visitor. Lucia told her that she left her son in the hands of caring parents years ago, that they died, and that Gus was left to fend for himself. In the end, Alex convinced Lucia to let Gus handle Alan on his own terms, saying that Gus should be the one to tell Alan if he so chooses. Phillip settled in at Olivia's suite at \"The Beacon\". After he told Olivia that he's happy to be there, Olivia asked if that's only because of the baby, but Phillip assured her it's not the only reason, and they made love. Later, Phillip assured Olivia that she won't be jailed for the stalker business, then told her he wants to burn every suit he has, sell his car and get a truck, adding that he wants to find a new place to live. Harley & Gus met outside of \"Company\", and rehashed the fact that Gus is a Spaulding by blood. Gus spoke with a police informant on his phone and arranged to meet with him at \"Olivia's\". After meeting up with Buzz and Frank inside \"Company\", Harley told them that Gus is Alan's son and that she feels guilty for secretly hoping that Gus never tells Alan the truth, saying she's in fear of Gus being \"sucked into the Spaulding vortex\". Alan got up and went to the door, at first couldn't open it, then he thought he saw prison bars there. Then he had a hallucinations of Olivia and Phillip right after they had sex, while they laughed at him. Alex and Lloyd drugged some more tea but found Alan's room empty. Gus missed meeting his informant, then ran into Phillip, who was surprisingly nice to him. Gus told Phillip that he found out he was adopted; Phillip knows how that feels and shared that he's leaving his Spaulding heritage behind. Alan, still drugged, ran in and shouted to them that he wanted to talk to his son."
