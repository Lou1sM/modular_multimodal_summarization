Dinah takes up Jeffrey's invitation for a drink and the two kiss. Cassie, wanting to find out why Jeffrey's room is leaking walks in on the two of them. Dinah leaves and Jeffrey tells Cassie that he is still in love with her and from now on all of his relationships will be without love, which sends Cassie from the room also. Mallet returns to the apartment to find a very angry Dinah. After Jonathan gets on her case about not doing enough to get Tammy back for him, Lizzie tells him that the old Jonathan would have done something to get her back by now. She even talks about drugging Tammy to get what he wants. Jonathan considers this and at Outskirts starts packing up Tammy's things. Tammy has a good time with Joey and is shocked when he tells her that he is still in love with her. When he brings up Sandy, Tammy runs away and tells Joey she isn't the girl he used to know. She asks him to leave with her but later shows up at Outskirts. She tells Jonathan that she just couldn't be with Joey since she is in love with Jonathan. They start to make up but then Tammy finds her clothes packed, two plane tickets, and the drugs. She correctly guesses that Jonathan thought about drugging and kidnapping her and although he swears he wouldn't have gone through with it, she throws a metal box at him and leaves. Jonathan breaks down in tears."
