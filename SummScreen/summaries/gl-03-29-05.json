Buzz agrees when he's talking with Harley. But his story changes when he talks to Rick; he believes the boys should both live with Rick and Mel. However, Rick agrees with Harley, that Buzz will be a fabulous father figure to them. Rick even suggests they move to the Bauer guest house - it would be the best thing for them. \"We're all family, Buzz, and we have to stick together for Harley.\" Buzz has one request: he wants use of the hot tub! Rick agrees and they are both happy about the arrangement. \n\n\nRick is having a good evening. Michelle finds him at Company and makes it clear her memory is coming back. She remembers her brother! She even admits to remember more about Danny and their life together, but insists she still loves Tony. Good thing, because later, Tony presents her with a beautiful bracelet and thanks her for all the good things she has brought to his life. \n\n\nDanny isn't having such a great evening. Frank, after trying unsuccessfully to drown his sorrows, has found him. He warns him to stay away from Marina. \"I just lost my sister and I will not lose my daughter!\" Marina breaks up their fist fight. She is angry with her father, but she understands why he is upset. After getting him home, she talks with Danny. He is nursing a hurt jaw and says he realizes he had better be good to her.

She tries to seduce him and he certainly wants to comply, but knows she still loves Edmund. \n\n\nAnd Edmund is certainly having an interesting day. Trying to reason with Ross at the gate of Dinah's flight did not work. Ross refuses to let her off the airplane. So Edmund uses his position as ambassador and demands her plane be held. He breaks into the cabin just as the bodyguard seats himself next to Dinah. Edmund tries to rescue her but the guard intervenes. Edmund rallies support from the other passengers, telling them she had been kidnapped and this was the woman he loves and she is carrying his baby. Dinah is amazed and thrilled! Edmund actually picks her up and carries her off the plane. But back at home, he is beginning to have second thoughts. He tells Dinah she is indeed pregnant, he had gotten the call from the doctor earlier that morning. He also promises to take care of her, but there is oddly no more talk about love. Later, he wonders how he will tell Cassie he loves her and they are about to have a child. \n\n\nBack at Jeffrey's studio, Cassie sees Edmund is calling her cell phone and wonders if she should answer...\n\n\n",
