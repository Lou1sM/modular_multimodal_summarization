    "tvmega_recap": "Mallet arrives back at the suite to find Dinah throwing him out for leaving the dinner party. He tries to reason with her but she is adamant. He goes to get drunk but when a woman hits on him, he starts to think back to his and Harley's time in Florida, he remembers cheating on her with his partner. Running into Harley at the hospital, where she is to get supplies to care for Gus, Harley tells him that she can't be his partner anymore. Mallet goes back to the suite where he tells Dinah that he is not going anywhere. She punches him and he handcuffs her to a chair so she will listen. Dinah wants to know how she knows that Mallet won't cheat on her like he did Harley and he tells her that it already happened and it won't happen again. He tells her that it was because of the grief over losing Gus but tells her he wants to be completely honest with her. Dinah asks how she will know that Harley won't turn to him again and decides she has something that she needs to do. She leaves the suite and Mallet follows in bewilderment."
