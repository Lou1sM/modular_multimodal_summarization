Edmund ran into Cassie at the gym and they shared an awkward moment. Later, he watched her through the gym window as she exercised. Beth saw him and wondered to herself why he was staring at Cassie. Alan had another hallucination, this time about Beth coming on to him. When she visited for real, he panicked and said he can't sleep with her, shocking Beth by his condition. Beth chatted with Alex about his condition and then phoned Phillip to let him know about Alan's condition. After hearing the call, Alex drugged Alan some more. After some debate with himself, Phillip decided to visit Alan, leaving Zack with Olivia & Harley. Harley gets a call about a suspect and rushes out. Lucia advised Gus not to tell Alan that he's his father. Harley phones Gus about the suspect, so he left. Eden blasted Lucia for abandoning her and Gus. Lucia suggested that they work together to help Gus. Phillip was alarmed at Alan's behavior. Alex said it started shortly after Phillip moved out and hinted that there is a situation that has to do with him and with Brandon's will. Harley arrived at the suspect's house and heard a woman's screams, so she rushed in, flashing her badge. She talked to the woman's son while her suspect came up behind with a knife and held her by the neck. He disarmed her as she tried reasoning with him to allow the woman and child to leave. He did, and the boy told Gus, who was outside, about the lady cop being held by his father. Gus called for backup and entered the building. The man pressed Harley against the wall and shouted threats at her as he raised the gun towards her face."
