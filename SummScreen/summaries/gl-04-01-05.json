Gus tells her it's from the prison, the prison where she'll be sent to. Gus then tells a shocked Harley that he'll be able to visit her every day. He thinks it's a great idea, but she states that it's terrible. Harley tells Gus that she doesn't want him living there. She tells him he's put his life on hold enough already and it has to stop. Gus tells her he doesn't want to and declares his love for her. Harley tries to tell him that she wants the people she loves to move on with their lives. She's concerned for his health and is afraid that he'll collapse from his bleeding ulcer. Gus refuses to talk bout it though and proceeds to kiss her Harley then suggests that he shave first and take a shower. Gus complies and while he's out of the room Harley slips out. When Gus gets out, he discovers that Harley is gone, and Alexandra is there. Alex tells him that Harley called her and told her about the situation. Alex tries to explain that Gus is a burden to Harley now. Prison will be hard enough without Harley having to worry about Gus. But Gus still refuses to listen and takes off to find Harley. Before he leaves, Alex reminds him that he has family -- a family that he needs. \n\nBill and Olivia are enjoying a night out at a disco. When Bill goes to get them a drink, Olivia sees Jonathan and asks him to do her a favor. Olivia tells him that Billy wants to make trouble for her marriage and so she needs leverage against him. She tells him that she knows Billy hired a man named Jed Harris last fall and wants to know the reason. After seeing Harris's picture, Jonathan recognizes him as a guy who hangs out at Farley's. Before leaving the disco, Jonathan (who's agreed to help) bumps into Bill. Unbeknownst to Bill, he's swiped his wallet. Later that night, Bill realizes his wallet is missing and since Olivia didn't bring her purse they have no way of paying for the drinks. As they're discussing their problem, the DJ starts up the Hot Bods Contest. Since the winner of the winner gets $ 200, Bill suggests that Olivia enter. Olivia refuses to go up and dance around in public but Bill tries to persuade her by telling her the alternative is washing dishes. On the spot, Olivia publicly nominates Bill as a contestant. Although he's reluctant, when she repeats his \"would you rather wash dishes\" argument, he takes off his shirt and dances around. Thanks to the female patrons, Bill is the winner of the Hot Bods Contest. \n\nJonathan's now at Farley's where, sure enough, Jed Harris is playing pool. After challenging Jed to a game of pool, Jonathan bumps into him and discreetly plants Bill's wallet in Jed's pocket. Just then, a police officer enters the bar. At this point, Jonathan gets down to business and asks Jed why Billy Lewis hired him last fall. As an incentive for Jed to answer, Jonathan points out that Bill Lewis's wallet is in his pocket; all Jonathan has to do is tell the police officer that Jed stole it. Jed accuses Jonathan of setting him up, but Jonathan points out that he can't prove that. Harris then tells Jonathan the reason he was hired--to rough up Phillip Spaulding. However, he tells Jonathan that Phillip was already dead before he had a chance. \n\nBill and Olivia are now right outside Company. Bill notices that Harley is in there and goes in to see her. Olivia though sees Jonathan and stays outside. Outside, Olivia is thrilled with the news Jonathan gives her on Jed Harris. Meanwhile, inside, Harley laments to Bill about Gus. She tells Bill that she needs to find a way to push Gus away but doesn't know how. As Bill is comforting Harley, Gus enters. Harley asks him to leave, but he refuses so Harley leaves. \n\nEdmund's at home staring at Cassie's wedding ring. Dinah, who's dressed in Cassie's robe, tries to be reassuring but Edmund isn't interested. He reminds her of why she's living at the farm; it's not so she can take over Cassie's life. He then tells her to take off Cassie's clothes and wear her own Dinah then changes and tells Edmund that she's moving out.

Jeffrey tells Cassie that he thinks she wants to be there with him, otherwise she'd have gone to stay with someone else. Cassie tells him to stop talking since he's just confusing her and he gets angry. Jeffrey states that he can't take it; he can't deny how he feels and he wants her. As they start kissing again, Edmund knocks on the door and starts yelling for Cassie. Cassie slips out the back while Jeffrey answers the door. Jeffrey ells Edmund that Cassie isn't there but Edmund doesn't believe him. Edmund explains that there are reasons why he and Cassie need to be together, but Jeffrey doesn't care and threatens to have Edmund arrested for trespassing if he doesn't leave. Edmund doesn't care and pushes his way inside. But, Cassie is nowhere to be found. Outside though, Cassie is shocked to see Dinah and demands to know how she just happened to show up there the same time as Edmund.
