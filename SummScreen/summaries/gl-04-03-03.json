    "tvmega_recap": "Alan blamed Alexandra for all the losses he's suffered ever since she came back to town: his company, his house, Olivia & Phillip. He then told her he suspects she's plotting something else, but Alex called him paranoid. Alan requested another cup of tea, and when Alex headed out to prepare it, Alan ducked out of the mansion.......Olivia was all frustrated at the loft, trying to clean and think of a fancy meal to prepare for she & Phillip, but at wit's end, she finally called a service to employ to do the work......Alan dropped in, bringing her a string of pearls she'd left at the mansion. Totally oblivious to Olivia's distant attitude, Alan began kissing her hand passionately. Alan seemed to be in a time-warp, believing he & Olivia were still happily married. Olivia, stunned and also concerned, took Alan back to the mansion, where Alexandra was. After Alan left the room, Olivia expressed concern to Alex over Alan's delusional state, and when she found out Alan hadn't seen a doctor yet, she told Alex to make an appointment---or she WOULD. Alex then called Mel. She panicked when Mel advised that Alan should have blood tests.....Later, a nurse came by to take blood tests---but Alex arranged for Lloyd to give blood instead of Alan! After pulling Steve Gidric off of Harley, Gus realized Harley had been shot and severely wounded. Frank and paramedics rushed in. Buzz and Rick, who were at the command post, also rushed in and Rick tended to Harley before she was transfered to Cedars.....As Marah & Eden bonded, Gus called Eden and told her Harley had been shot. Marina was shaken by the news and Shayne tried to comfort her.....Ben arrived at Ramona's suite at the \"Beacon\". She had wine all ready and was in a seductive mood. Before too long, she and Ben had sex. Afterwards, she told Ben she'd like it to be a weekly occurrence. Ben seemed to go along with it.....Later, Ben returned to \"Company\" and didn't like it when he saw Marina & Shayne sharing a close moment. Marina told him about Harley's shooting......Eden & Marah arrived at Cedars, and as Eden fussed worriedly over Gus, Marah received a call from Reva, who was in Vienna. Before Marah had a chance to tell Reva the news, Reva told her she \"feels\" that Harley's in some type of danger.....Frank raged at Gus, blaming him for Harley's plight. Gus was distraught as Mel and Rick worked over Harley. Rick notified Harley's concerned friends & family that they were finally able to stop Harley's bleeding and that surgery would have to wait until Harley was in the clear......While on the phone with Marah, Reva expressed a sudden, intense fear for Harley just as Harley went into cardiac arrest. The crash cart was hurriedly brought into the treatment room where Harley was, and defribillator paddles were used to try to get Harley's heart beating again, but the flat- line on the monitor persisted......As bright light enveloped Harley, she \"woke up\", hearing a woman's voice calling her. Sitting up, she stared straight ahead, and Nadine materialized. With a loving smile on her face, she approached Harley."
