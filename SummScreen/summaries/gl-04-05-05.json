    "soap_central": "\n\nHarley talks to Bill about her last moments of freedom before she goes to prison. She tells him how frustrating it is that Gus will not leave her alone; it actually hurts her to watch him trying so hard to help. She just wishes he would get on with his life without her. Gus enters the room and Bill tries to run interference. \"She wants you to leave her alone,\" Bill says, but Gus will not leave. Harley tries to reason with him, but the more she talks the more anxious he becomes. He actually collapses right in front of her. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Rick tells Harley and Alexandra he thinks this attack was a combination of his ulcer, overwork and too much coffee. Harley goes in to talk with Gus - she tells him goodbye as he lies there asleep. Rick and Alexandra are surprised when Harley leaves the hospital, telling them she cannot be there when he wakes up. \n\n\nBill is delighted when his father agrees to let him come back to Lewis Construction. Bill goes into his old office and is sitting at his desk when the intercom flashes. He hears a conversation between his wife and his father. Olivia has given Billy some documents which prove he hired a \"thug\" to beat Phillip up the night he was murdered. Olivia threatens him, \"Give me your share of Lewis Construction or else...\" Billy walks away and saying \"No deal!\" But Olivia has agreed with help Alan and Sebastian acquire Lewis Construction for Spaulding Enterprises, so she calls Alan and tells him she believes Billy will cooperate. She is very surprised when her solo celebration is cut short by Bill's appearance in her office. \"I didn't know you were here!\" she says. \"Obviously not,\" he replies. \n\n\nMichelle and Danny have lots of apologies to make to their respective romantic partners. Michelle tries to explain to Tony what happened just as Danny apologizes to Marina and tries to explain to her. Michelle does not know what to do when Tony gets on bended knee, offering her an enormous engagement ring. She cannot answer him, saying she is \"overwhelmed.\" The two couples meet by accident at Elizabeth & Company and the tension is thick! Danny and Michelle act as if they've never met. Things only get worse when Tony asks Michelle to show off her engagement ring. Later, she finds she simply cannot tell Tony what happened with Danny...just as he cannot tell Marina what happened with Michelle. Marina is no dummy - she saw the difference in Michelle. Danny does not lie to her when she says \"Its back isn't it?\" Danny admits Michelle's memory is back and that he wants to slow things down for awhile. Marina is fine with that, but tells Danny she will not give up on what they have without a fight! \n\n\n",
