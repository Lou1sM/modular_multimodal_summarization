Both Reva and Josh are confused because she has all the symptoms. Then it dawns on Reva--she's in menopause. Sedgewick confirms that Reva is indeed in the early stages of menopause. Both Josh and Reva are disappointed. They then leave the hospital. \n\nCassie is astounded by all the baby stuff at the farm and asks Edmund about it. Edmund tells her it's for their baby. He tries to explain the situation to her, but Cassie refuses to listen since she's just there to deliver the separation papers. Cassie is still in shock over all the baby items and asks Edmund if he really thought she'd just melt and go back to him just because he bought the stuff. It's then that Edmund tells her that their dream of having a child is already happening; they're going to have a baby. He tells her that found a surrogate to carry their child. Cassie is astonished and Edmund tries to get her to see that there was only a small window of opportunity to use the embryos and so he made the decision. Cassie is in shock that he'd make this decision without even asking her. \nEdmund tries to explain himself and tells her he's sure that in time, she'll realize he made the right decision. He assures her that the surrogate signed a contract; they're protected and it's legal. In shock, Cassie states she's going to be sick and runs out of the farm with the papers still in her hand. Just then, Dinah enters, having heard everything. Dinah tries to assure Edmund that he handled everything the best he could, but he thinks he just sounded desperate. He laments that he didn't break the news the right way. As he's trying to think up the next step, Dinah announces that she has it---she'll move out and into her own apartment. She then assures Edmund that Cassie will be back and leaves. \n\nAt Company, the Coopers are getting ready to go to Harley's sentencing. Meanwhile, Harley is outside, insinuating to Gus that she and Bill slept together. An angry Gus isn't sure whether to believe it or not and accuses her of doing this on purpose to push him away. Gus asks Harley if this is really how she wants to say goodbye. Gus tells Harley that he wants her tell him she didn't sleep with Bill, but Harley is sticking with her story. She then tells him that she did it because of his decision to live next to the prison. She then tells Gus that she needed someone to hold her, someone who wasn't Gus. She then insists that he has to move on. She then tells him not to come to the courthouse. Angry and hurt, Gus walks away. Harley then asks Bill to back up her story about the two of them if Gus ever asks. Harley then goes inside and says goodbye to her boys. She tries to reassure them that she'll call and write and tells them that it will be okay. Harley then leaves after she hugs her boys one last time. \n\nAs Harley is leaving Company, she comes across Josh, Reva, and also Cassie. After Harley bids everyone a tearful goodbye, Reva and Cassie talk about Reva's news and Cassie's separation. Reva tells Cassie that she's sorry to hear she's not having a baby either. When Reva asks what Cassie's going to do about her and Edmund, Cassie isn't sure. Later, as Josh and Rick are trying to comfort Zach and Jude, Cassie comes and tries to comfort them by telling them that a mommy's love is the strongest, best thing in the whole world. She then tells them that a mommy never gives up on her babies, and she never really leaves. \n\nCassie returns to the farm to give Edmund the separation papers. When Edmund tries to talk to her, she tells him that she doesn't want to hear it. Angry, Cassie tells Edmund that she might be able to walk away from him, but not their child. Edmund tries to convince Cassie that this baby will bring them back together. Cassie's not convinced and demands details about the surrogate. When she asks about details about this woman she doesn't even know, Dinah enters and tells her she does know her--it's her. \n\nAt the courthouse, Alan shocks Harley by giving a statement to the court on her behalf. He stales that he's speaking for his son and he's son would want Harley to have the most lenient sentence as possible. Alan goes on the explain that he's doing this to keep his grandson, Zach, from losing his mother since that would be punishing the boy. After Jeffrey tells the judge that the DA's office is recommending the lightest sentence possible, Harley makes her own statement. She tells the court that she wishes she could go back in time and change things so none of this would have ever happened. She then takes full responsibility for what happened to Phillip and asks forgiveness. Unfortunately, the judge isn't moved because Harley has yet to ever admit to actually killing Phillip. The judge feels that Harley's apology is too little, too late and sentences her to 25 years in prison; with a possibility of parole in 15 years. As court adjourns, Harley tries to ask Alan why he made his statement but she's interrupted with Gus (who's been retrained from going inside by Frank) suddenly bursts in. As Harley is being led away, Gus, restrained by Frank and police officers, keeps yelling that he will keep working on her appeal. \n\n\n\n",
