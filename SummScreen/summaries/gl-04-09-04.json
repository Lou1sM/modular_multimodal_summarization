Danny asks if Jeffrey feels any guilt at all and Jeffrey says guilt is a luxury he doesn't have. He has a job to do and he needs Danny's answer by the end of the week. Later, alone in the church, Danny talks to God. He says for past two years he's tried to clean up his life. He admits he did take dirty money, but it didn't come from drugs, prostitution or gambling and it was used for a good cause--to build up 5th St. He's afraid he'll never be able to redeem himself because he's a Santos. Later, he calls Michelle, who informs him the mayoral race is being contested. The DA's office is holding an investigation and the votes are being recounted. Danny tells her not to worry about it and that they need to talk. \n\n\nBilly and Josh are at the hospital discussing the fact that Marah is being released. It's obvious though that Marah is still stunned by the entire Carrie incident and is having trouble moving forward. Marina admits to Shayne she's having some trouble too. However, she thinks she's come up with a plan to give everyone closure. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Marah sets out to leave. Josh and Billy try to talk to her but she's still dazed and can't really hear what they're saying. She then rushes out. Jeffrey finds Marah, who has been released from the hospital, at the Fairgrounds. She is having a very hard time moving on. She's furious at what Carrie did and how she allowed her to do it. She's upset because she tortured her own father and she's upset because deep down she wanted Carrie to die. Jeffrey tries to comfort her and warns not give in to her self-loathing. When Marah admits she's lost herself, he promises her that she'll find her way back. \n\n\nMarina's plan for closure is being implemented. While Marina talks to Buzz, Shayne speaks with Josh and Billy, and Michelle talks to her dad and later Alan. They talk to the men about the need to move on and settle things. They persuade them that to assuage their guilt, they need to close the door on this chapter in their lives. \n\n\nLater, the five men meet up at Maryanne's grave and Josh suggests they make a new pact. He says they can't undo their past mistakes. However, they can try to become the best men they could possibly be, the kind of men their kids can be proud of, the kind of men they should have been the night Maryanne died. As they did before, all men seal the pact by placing their hands atop one another's.  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Danny goes to Father Ray's church but Jeffrey follows him to threaten him with prosecution if he decides not to go back into the mob. When Father Ray comes to congratulate Danny, he brushes off his praise and goes to speak to God in private. Alone in the confession booth, Danny rails at his fate and the family legacy that he can never escape. At the hospital, Marina, Shayne, Billy and Josh have come to check on Marah, who fainted after her most recent brush with Carrie. They try to comfort her but their forced optimism only makes Marah feel worse and she takes off out of the hospital. Marina, Michelle and Shayne then go to Buzz, Ed and Josh and Billy, respectively, to be sure that Carrie's arrest has put an end to her hold on them. At the end of the day, the five men gather at Maryanne's gravesite to make a new pact. Jeffrey finds Marah at the fairgrounds where she confronts the detritus from the old funhouse. She laments on what Carrie has done to her and how she can't forget about the violence. Jeffrey, hurting for her and struggling with his own conflicted soul, wraps her in his arms and takes her home with him.",
