    "tvmega_recap": "Phillip gave Alex the good news about Harley's condition, but just as he was about to broach the subject of Gus, Olivia entered the room. Olivia and Alex filled Phillip in about Alan's guilt in regards to the stalking business, and that the charges against Olivia have been dropped. Alex told Phillip he needs to return to the helm at Spaulding now more than ever. After Alex left, Phillip told Olivia that the whole Alan/stalker scenario sounds fishy and that Alex must be up to something in order for her to change her tune about Olivia. Olivia leveled with Phillip about the deal she made with Alex, to try and coax Phillip back to the Spaulding fold. Phillip vehemently told her he'd never consider that. He then told her about the possibility of Gus being Alan's son. Phillip took delight in imagining what it would be like for Gus to be calling the shots at Spaulding and Alan and Alex jumping through hoops for him! After Marah, Shayne, Ben, Marina and Bill came through the secret entranceway into Danny and Michelle's new place, they were all shocked that the tunnel spanned the distance all the way from the museum on 5th St. The group wondered about the history of the tunnel. Marah refreshed Danny and Michelle about the story of the curse from the Egyptian exhibit in the 1930's. Feeling uncomfortable around Michelle and Danny, Bill quickly left. Michelle told Danny that she wouldn't ever want to lose Bill's friendship, but Danny told her that friendships sometimes suffer when intimate feelings have come into the picture. Marah pointed out to Michelle how the wooden molding in their house has the same sort of faces carved into it as the molding over at the museum. Danny told Marah, Shayne, Ben and Marina it was okay to investigate the rest of their house. Later that night, Michelle had a nightmare about the eyes lighting up in the carved face in the wooden molding, then seeing a cloaked figure. Danny held her after she woke up screaming. Gus told Harley that the bullet which hit her came from a standard service revolver, but when he told Harley he shot her, she told him not to assume that until ballistic tests were completed. She then told Gus she loves him and that it doesn't matter if the bullet came from his gun or not. Alex's arrival angered Harley. Alex pointed out to Gus how becoming part of the Spaulding family wouldn't be in his best interests and offered him a cash settlement to leave town with Harley. Outside Cedars, Bill shot a few hoops of basketball when Eden came around. When Bill mentioned that Eden should go and be with her brother, Eden informed him that Gus isn't her brother. The two were in a glum mood, and instead of talking, Eden and Bill began kissing instead. They left to go somewhere private."
