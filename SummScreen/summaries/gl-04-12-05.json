Gus walks confidently across the room and decks Bill with a good right hook. \"That's what you get for sleeping with my girl!\" he yells. Olivia is shocked and she and Bill have a nasty fight after Gus leaves. Surprisingly, she doesn't seem to understand why Bill is upset about her attempts to destroy his father - his indiscretion with Harley is much more important to her. They mutually agree their relationship really doesn't have a chance. Olivia cries when she leaves, \"I loved you. I really loved you.\" It doesn't look like Bill believes her. \n\n\nAlan has invited a number of important people to a cocktail party. Holly is among them. She wonders why, but Alan doesn't mince words - he wants to buy her newspaper. He felt the coverage of Harley's trial was biased. Sebastian tells Holly not to sell to Alan, but the temptation to be out from under the work and the financial obligations is very tempting to her. Sebastian insinuates that buying a woman's newspaper is a strange way to seduce a woman. Holly doesn't miss a step and replies, \"It's better than locking her in a cage!\" The new, calmer Sebastian agrees with a chuckle. His attention turns to Olivia, who arrives at Alan's party in quite a state. She ends up in tears - and Holly watches as Sebastian wraps his arms around her. \n\n\nJosh convinces Reva to join him on a holiday to Aspen. She melts as he describes a very romantic week. But when Jonathan shows up, she offers to stay in Springfield if he needs her. Jonathan says no, he doesn't need her and she should go. Reva is very reluctant, however. Later Jonathan seems agitated when he talks on his cell phone. He tells the listener things have changed, and Reva will be out of town. \"I tried. Yeah, I'm sorry, too.\" Jonathan looks very troubled. \n\n\nReva might not leave if she knew what a bad day her sister was having. Just as Cassie tells Dinah she will probably always love Edmund, he walks into the room. She is terribly confused and angry, but ends up in his arms and they kiss. Dinah watches them and quietly says, \"That won't do!\" She creates some smoke in the kitchen so the fire alarm sounds. Cassie tells Edmund that trouble follows him wherever he goes. She tells him to leave. Cassie sits on the sofa. She is appalled when Dinah tells her everything will be all right. \n\n\n",
