She is getting ready to give her speech when monitors are wheeled in and Harley's pre-recorded speech is given instead. Dinah complains to Jeffrey who is trying to get her on his campaign trail by getting the dirt on Blake, who is at the same time trying to get the dirt on Jeffrey from Cassie. After Jeffrey leaves, Dinah pushes the monitor with Harley's image off of the roof. Olivia meets Frank in the elevator and convinces him to give her another chance. She tells him that Buzz was there for her and she won't apologize for that but that he pushed them together because he wanted her to be happy. Buzz, who is at the party with Marina, spends most of the night hiding from Frank. Frank agrees that they need to talk but tells Olivia that it is something that needs to just be the two of them. Tammy goes home and tells Cassie that Jonathan wants nothing to do with her after what she did. Cassie tells Tammy that although she still doesn't want her with Jonathan she won't stand in their way anymore. Lizzie tells Jonathan that he needs to make Tammy sweat for a while and teases him about their one night together. Tammy wonders to Cassie how she can get Jonathan to take her back when he won't even answer her calls and from the doorway, he says that she should just talk to him. He asks Cassie if she has been telling Tammy reasons to stay away from him and Cassie tells him that she is through coming between them. Tammy and Jonathan go back to Outskirts together and he tells her that he won't hurt her again."
