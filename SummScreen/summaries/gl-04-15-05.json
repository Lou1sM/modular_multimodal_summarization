As Danny is trying to gauge Michelle's feelings, Tony (who had seen the kiss) enters with Robbie. When Michelle sees Robbie, she tells him she remembers everything and bonds with her son again. Danny tries to find out if Tony saw anything, asking when he got there. But Tony just replies he arrived a few minutes ago. Robbie is bonding with both of his parents while Tony stands off to the side. When Robbie asks if this means Michelle is going to move back home, she reminds him that she's marrying Tony. When she and Robbie go inside, Danny argues with Tony about Tony taking it upon himself to reschedule the divorce hearing. Michelle comes back out while they're arguing and Tony suggests they leave so she can sign the divorce papers now. Later, Robbie asks his father if Tony loves his mommy. Danny replies that he does. When asked if he loves her, Danny states yes, he does. \n\n\nMeanwhile, on the way to the lawyer's office, Tony and Michelle have stopped for a drink. Tony tries to get Michelle to discuss what she and Danny were talking about when he arrived at the house, but she just tells him they talked about Robbie. He asks her if she still wants a wedding. Michelle states she does. She's shocked when he suggests they elope tomorrow. Although she doesn't look thrilled about the idea, she agrees. \n\n\nDinah has arranged for Ross, Blake, Cassie and Edmund to all meet her at the Beacon. There she announces to Ross and Blake that she is carrying the Winslows' baby. While Dinah is trying to tell Ross her motives are pure, Tammy happens by and overhears the news. Tammy freaks out and demands to know from Cassie how this happened. Cassie tells the story to a disgusted Tammy who lashes out at Edmund. When Cassie tries to reassure Tammy, she warns her mother that Dinah will double-cross her with the baby. Edmund tries to tell her that won't happen, but Tammy walks out of the hotel in a rush. Cassie leaves out to follow her. Meanwhile, Ross and Blake are in shock over Dinah's news and neither one is happy about it. Blake doesn't think she will be able to give up the baby, but Dinah tries to alleviate their fears. As Blake goes outside to find Cassie, Edmund walks up to Ross and tries to defend what Dinah's doing. But Ross isn't interested in hearing it. He thinks Dinah will fall apart when she has to give up the baby and he calls Edmund selfish for letting her do it. \n\n\nOutside, Blake finds Cassie who was unable to catch up with Tammy. They start to talk about Edmund. Blake mentions he's desperate; he reminds her of her father. She gently tells Cassie it's still early in the pregnancy. If Cassie doesn't trust Dinah, there are still options. But Cassie doesn't want to consider getting rid of the baby. Edmund comes out. When Blake leaves, Edmund apologies for how Tammy found out. Cassie tells him Blake was telling her about her options. Edmund wonders if she really wants that and Cassie admits she doesn't. He tells her it's her baby, but she responds it's their baby and hugs him. When she breaks away, he tells her how much he loves her. He suggests she spend the night with him. He assures her nothing will happen - he just wants to be with her. She agrees, as long as he stays in Tammy's room. Cassie asks for some time alone. As Edmund goes back into the Beacon, Jeffrey comes by. He's overheard the last part of the conversation and asks Cassie if she's really going to spend the night with him. Cassie tries to defend her decision by stating he's her baby's father. Jeffrey asks if she can trust him; forgive him. Cassie isn't sure, and Jeffrey tells her she needs to figure it out soon. Cassie admits she does need distance from Edmund, so Jeffrey suggests she come with him tonight. Before leaving with Jeffrey (she doesn't know where to; it's a surprise), Cassie leaves a message on Edmund's machine telling him she won't be coming. Meanwhile, Dinah is at Edmund's and overhears the message. A little later, when Edmund comes to his room, he ends up finding a naked Dinah in his bed. \n\n\nGus meets with a friend right outside Olivia's bar. Gus asks his friend to investigate the note which was sent to him regarding Phillip's murder. Gus enters the bar and starts making chitchat with Olivia about the fact she's living at the Spaulding mansion again and so is he. She isn't interested in talking to him; she thinks he has ulterior motives. Gus tries to tell her he just thinks they should be allies since they're both living at the mansion. Olivia doesn't buy it. She doesn't think Gus wants an ally, she thinks he wants a suspect. She leaves. Just then Bill enters and asks Gus what he wants. Gus isn't very forthcoming since he's still mad about Bill and Harley. Bill asks how Olivia seemed. When Gus replies she seems paranoid, Bill defends her by stating she had a rough time of it with Phillip. He states Olivia was even having nightmares about him. Gus seems a little interested in these nightmares. When Bill leaves, Gus starts thinking about Olivia's tirade the night of Phillip's death and again at the funeral. \n\n\nHarley's trying to make small talk with her cellmate, but the woman isn't interested in talking. Suddenly, a guard comes and removes her cellmate but tells Harley she's staying. Left alone, Harley hears a familiar voice - her ex-husband, AC Mallet. Mallet explains he's the new warden at the prison. Harley is shocked beyond belief at seeing him after ten years. When she starts to sound resentful, he comments on her being able to hold a grudge. That just makes Harley angrier and she tells Mallet she hates him and wouldn't be in this mess if it weren't for him. He surprised by this and enters the cell with her so they can discuss how her being in jail for murder is his fault. Harley explains if it weren't for his affair, she would have never have gotten involved with Phillip to begin with. Trying to get her to see reason, Mallet asks if she'd honestly trade everything, including her sons, to not be where she is now. Harley admits she wouldn't but tells him she still hates him. Mallet tells her she should since what he did was rotten. He tries to talk about her situation, basically asking if she really killed Phillip. He tells her he's seen her angry enough t kill before. Harley gets upset again and denies killing him. Mallet tells Harley he expected her to hate him and he apologizes. But an upset Harley doesn't want to talk about it. She tells him she doesn't want to think about what she lost ten years ago since she's too busy thinking about what she's lost now. She starts crying about how she's lost her family, her children and the man she loves. Finally she just breaks down, and he takes her in his arms and comforts her. \n\n\n\n\n",
