    "tvmega_recap": "In Harley's hospital room, Eden told her that one of Eden's \"girls\" (Ginger) was beaten-up by a client and that she needs Gus' help. Knowing Gus is already dealing with enough, Harley told Eden not involve him in this. Eden explained that Ginger is a married woman, which is why Ginger doesn't want to lodge an official police complaint. After lecturing Eden about her line of business, Harley eventually agreed to look into the matter in an unofficial capacity once she's released from hospital. Later, Rick told Harley that she can be released from hospital. He also told her that he was the doctor who treated the \"acquaintance\" of Eden's (Ginger) who'd been roughed-up pretty bad. Harley told Rick she has something to \"take care of\", but he advised her ONLY to take care of herself. Danny told Michelle he's leaving town to attend a business meeting. After she asked to join him, he turned her down. She expressed fear of staying alone in their new house---secret tunnel and all---so Danny suggested she rent a room at the Beacon and invite Marah to join her, which she agreed to do. Later, Marah joined Michelle at the Beacon to have a \"girl's night\". They both happened to catch sight of Bill and Eden smooching in the lobby. Also at the Beacon, Cassie gave Edmund a checque from Danny towards the memorial exhibit for Richard, then the two sat and talked about their feelings towards one another: Cassie told Edmund that whenever she sees him, she's painfully reminded of her grief over Richard's death. Edmund offered to hold the memorial's fundraiser in Washington instead of in Springfield, but Cassie told him it wasn't necessary. Edmund got Cassie to admit that she wished it had been HE who died instead of Richard, but he also suggested that Cassie feels guilty that she's flourishing without Richard. At the courthouse, people were both alarmed and worried over Alan's no-show at his competency hearing. While Frank put out an A.P.B. on Alan, Beth, Olivia and Phillip each tried to figure out where Alan might be. The press arrived, and after they all clamored for a statement on the rumors of Alan's diminished mental capacity, Phillip faced the reporters and told them that Alan is simply just fatigued and taking a temporary absence from the company. Phillip then stunned Alexandra when he announced to the press that he's stepping in as temporary CEO of Spaulding Enterprises. Later, he made it clear to Alex that it's only a temporary situation and that he's NOT going to be sucked back into the Spaulding quagmire. Meanwhile, Gus arrived at the docks just as a delusional Alan was about to jump into the icy depths. Alan had no idea who Gus was. At one point, Alan jumped off the dock, but Gus grabbed hold of him in the nick of time. An anguished, depressed Alan wailed that he's lost everyone he's ever cared about. Gus promised to take Alan someplace where it's safe. Later, a dressed and ready-to-leave Harley phoned Gus from Cedars. She declined his offer to pick her up from hospital, lying, saying that the paperwork regarding her release could take hours (instead, intending to check into the situation with Ginger). Gus, who was talking to Harley from their house, told her he had something to tell her once she got home. After hanging up the phone, Gus turned around and faced their new houseguest: ALAN! After flying to New York City, Danny traveled to Queens and met with an organized crime figure, Rico. Danny told Rico he wants him to take over control of the gambling, drugs and money-laundering operations which the Santos family controlled, but Danny added that he's going to keep the sanitation and construction operations and that they'll be run as legitimate businesses. Danny also told Rico to stay away from any of his (Danny's) partners."
