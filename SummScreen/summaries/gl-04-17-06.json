Mallet asks Harley to make Dinah take some time off so that he can take her on a romantic getaway. Dinah slips some pills into a box of stuff that Gus is going through and he pockets them. Dinah sees him taking some later and tells him that she knows he gave his pills to Harley so she knows the ones that he is using aren't his. He gives her the pills but when Harley arrives and they go outside to talk he takes a pill out of Harley's purse. Harley tells Dinah to take some time off and a fuming Dinah agrees to help Alan-Michael get Spaulding back when she runs into him at the Beacon. She goes to her room and passionately kisses Mallet. Harley later realizes that Gus is still on the pills. Tammy and Jonathan are getting ready to celebrate the family dinner when Lizzie calls and tells Jonathan she wants him in her bed tonight. Jonathan makes up an excuse and goes to Company where he physically threatens Lizzie if she tries to come between he and Tammy. Coop hears the noise and rushes out and pulls Jonathan off of Lizzie. Lizzie tries to make Coop feel sorry for her and take her home but Ava insists that they both take her home. Ava tucks her into her bed and makes it clear that if Lizzie needs anything she should call her, not Coop. Lizzie says that seeing the two of them together makes her sick and she rushes to the bathroom to throw up. Tammy tells Marina that she wants to drop the restraining order and they discuss their love lives. Marina goes to Alan-Michael's room and they start to get passionate, until Alan-Michael tells her that she has to accept him for everything he is. When she can't he kicks her out telling her she has to accept \"all or nothing\"."
