Even though he tries to comfort her, she pushes him away and accuses him of ultimately being the reason she ended up behind bars. If he hadn't cheated on her she would never have been with Phillip. She asks him to treat her as if she were just another prisoner. He agrees and leaves. Once he is gone two inmates rush into her cell and begin to rough her up. But they are interrupted when Harley's roommate shows up and stops the rough treatment. Harley is suspicious because the woman, Lena, had previously ignored he attempts at conversation. Lena tells Harley they can help each other. Later, a guard appears and announces Lena has a phone call. When she gets to the phone, she tells the caller that whatever he did, it worked - Harley is her roommate. \n\n\nGus arrives at the Bauer's to see Buzz outside with Coop. He asks if they have seen or heard anything suspicious since Harley went to jail. He shows them the paper he found at the Spaulding mansion and tells them he thinks it may have come from Phillip's real killer. Buzz isn't convinced, but Coop confesses something weird happened to him while he was in front of Phillip's vault at the cemetery. He takes them to the spot and shows them the rose that was laid on Phillip's stone while he had his back to it. Gus admits he was there the same day and felt like he was being watched. Someone is watching the exchange from the bushes. \n\n\nEdmund arrives at his suite at The Beacon expecting to find Cassie who has agreed to spend the night with him. He is surprised and disappointed to find it is Dinah under the covers, not his forgiving wife. He attempts to leave to get another room, but Dinah urges him to stay with her so she won't be alone. He agrees and they talk about Cassie and the baby. In a last effort to salvage a night with Cassie he calls her cell phone but can't hear her because there is music, laughter and Jeffrey's voice in the background. After hanging up he gets Dinah to agree to an unnecessary trip to the emergency room in order to get Cassie away from Jeffrey. \n\n\nJeffrey, in an attempt to get Cassie's mind off the ordeal with Dinah and the baby, has convinced her to go somewhere with him. On the way, Cassie finds out they are going to a dive bar where Jeffrey and his band will be playing for the night. Cassie is happy until she finds out he volunteered her to be the back-up singer for the group. Once they arrive, Cassie is distraught and tells him she has a horrible voice and there is no way she is getting up there. He hands her a shot of liquor, a tambourine, tells her she will be fine and ushers her up to the stage. She is stiff at first but is soon wiggling all over stage and singing into the microphone alongside Jeffrey, who is encouraging her. Afterwards, she is elated. Her phone rings but she can't hear the caller because of the crowd chanting, 'Cassie! Cassie!' She hangs up and shimmies back to the stage for an encore performance. On the drive home, the mood is deflated when Cassie receives a call from Edmund announcing he is taking Dinah to the emergency room. \n\n\n",
