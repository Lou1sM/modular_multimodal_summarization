    "tvmega_recap": "Blake blames Jeffrey for the story about Ross and the affair with his assistant as a way to get her to lose the election. Frank finds out more facts about the crash, and wonders if someone was trying to murder Ross. He later asks Gus to investigate. Billy tells Josh that he was the one who arranged to have the divorce papers delivered to Reva. Olivia refuses to sell Josh Cross Creek, but later Cassie offers to sell her half of the Beacon if she will sell it to her and Olivia agrees. Harley has Rick talk to Gus about the pills he is taking and Gus resents that Harley doesn't trust him, but she points out that she knows he went through her purse. Olivia chats with Buzz at Company, but their talking is very intimate. It's clear that she can really communicate well with him, even though she says she has chosen Frank. She thanks him for helping Frank woo her, and he kisses her hand just as Frank walks up and sees them. Frank brushes Buzz off when he wants to make up. Josh can't convince Olivia to sell him Cross Creek, but Cassie convinces her to sell it in exchange for her half of The Beacon. Josh gets excited about restoring the place to the way it used to be. Cassie invites herself along to help out. Billy gets angry when he finds out that Josh and Reva are back together. He lets Josh know that he is the one that let Reva find the papers; the two brothers argue about Reva. Harley forces Gus to have leg checked out by Rick, who says it is healing. They are both worried about Gus' pill-popping, and Reva confronts him about the bottle of pills that have been moved in her purse. Gus claims he is fine and gets angry at Harley for going behind his back to Rick and accusing him, but they make up. A tabloid newspaper article has photos of Ross and his personal assistant. Blake accuses Jeffrey of planting it, but he denies it. She is very vulnerable and hurting, and Jeffrey seems to feel sorry for her (and perhaps something more). An FAA Agent gives Frank info about the crash-- it was not an accident. Frank tells Jeffrey, who phones someone about it and finds out that Ross' personal assistant, Nikki, was a private eye. Frank gives the file to Gus to investigate but doesn't want to tell Blake yet. Frank is a little concerned about Gus' leg but gives him a chance after Gus pleads with him."
