Michelle was thrown for a loop when Danny conceded the election to Ross! When Ross attempted to talk to Michelle, she refused to speak to him. After he left, Michelle admitted to Danny that she now hates everyone who ever doubted Danny. Outside the house, Ross ran into Ed, who was just arriving. Ross told Ed that Michelle was in dire need of a father right now. Inside the house, Michelle told Danny he's never backed away from a fight before and that it wasn't like him to accept fate like this. Just as Michelle asked Danny if he had something to hide, Ed arrived. As Michelle was beside herself, Danny thanked Ed for all his support. Noticing his daughter's troubled and closed-off state, Ed chose to leave. \n\n\nAt the Spaulding mansion, Joey gave Lizzie a set of tickets for her family to use on the night of the play. A saddened Lizzie left the room, followed by Joey, who correctly guessed that Lizzie was sad because her father wouldn't be able to be there when \"Romeo And Juliet\" is performed. Joey ended up telling Lizzie that his own father left his mother and him years before and that he (Joey) did a lot of acting-out because of it, but stopped because it was hurting his mother. After making Lizzie feel better, Joey announced that they were now friends. Elsewhere at the mansion, Tammy called Cassie and said she needed a ride home. When Tammy learned that Edmund would be picking her up, she was thrilled! \n\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Marah at the airport, Jeffrey returned to his suite and fantasized of how it would've been like if Marah had changed her mind and followed him back there. Later, R.J. walked into Jeffrey's suite and picked-up on Jeffrey's sadness. At first, Jeffrey tried to lie about it, then admitted to R.J. that he is, indeed, sad. All the while, Cassie had been standing in the doorway listening to every word. \n\n\nAlexandra arranged a meeting with Alan over dinner at Towers, where she said they'd be far away from Olivia's prying ears. After reaffirming their plans to keep Olivia and baby Emma close by, Alex told Alan she was worried over the current state of Spaulding Enterprises---namely the \"Bad Girl\" campaign. She informed Alan that Eden's about to marry Bill Lewis and is about to become a \"good\" girl, and they can't have that. When Sandy arrived at their table, Alex told Alan that Sandy's the person who'll help them with their current image problems. Sandy told Alan that upon graduation, what Lizzie doesn't need are earrings and a trip to Europe, but that she needs some guidance instead, and that he's worked closely with her during play rehearsals and thinks she has a lot to add to Spaulding Enterprises. \n\n\nAt another table at Towers, Frank had dinner with Marina. After telling her that the old museum probably holds ugly memories of Ben and Carrie, and seeing that Marina's birthday's coming up soon, he tells Marina he's got the perfect gift for her. When Marina guesses that the gift may be a new apartment, Frank informs a shocked Marina that he and Darcy have had Marina's old room redecorated and that they want her to move back in! Sandy rescues Marina from the awkward moment when he comes over to their table. He mentions to them that he's just had a sit-down with Alexandra over Lizzie and how Lizzie needs some guidance, when Frank smiles and says that this was the same sort of thing he was just discussing with Marina. \n\n\nBack at the Spaulding mansion, Joey confided to Lizzie that Tammy's always comparing him to her stepfather (Edmund) and that she's put Edmund high up on a pedestal and it's making him feel uncomfortable. Joey got Lizzie to promise not to tell anyone about it. Tammy rushed in and cheerily announced that Edmund would be arriving shortly and that they should rehearse the balcony scene again because it needed \"a lot of work.\" Later, as the trio rehearsed, Tammy was annoyed with Joey for tampering with the scene's blocking, but when Edmund arrived and assured Tammy that she'd be the most beautiful \"Juliet\" Springfield has ever seen, she dropped everything and let Edmund drive her home. Dejected, Joey was about to leave when Lizzie insisted he stay so they could practice lines together. When Lizzie commented on how well he knew his lines, he told her he set the words to music so he'd remember them better. He went on to tell her that tomorrow evening, he was planning to serenade Tammy and told Lizzie not to tell her. After he left, Lizzie thought of how wonderful it was for a guy to do that for a girlfriend.... \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Cassie told Jeffrey that she thought what he did for Marah was amazing and that she (Cassie) may have been wrong about him. Jeffrey assured Cassie he was still a jerk and when he tried to get rid of her, Cassie asked him if the allegations against Danny were true. Jeffrey told her to ignore the rumors and gossip and believe in her friend Danny, but when Cassie stood silently, expecting more details, Jeffrey told Cassie to think about her life, her children and her business, and warned her to stay away from Danny Santos or else she'll find herself in something that will get very ugly and the life she knows will never be the same again! \n\n\nAt Michelle and Danny's, Michelle again told Danny not to accept defeat, and when he tried to speak, she cut in and told him she was going upstairs to check on Robbie. After she left the room, Danny made a call to Jeffrey. Danny told Jeffrey he conceded the election to Ross this evening, adding that he hoped Jeffrey's evening was equally as miserable. Jeffrey told Danny not to relax just yet---that tomorrow Danny has to make a \"public confession.\" Jeffrey ordered Danny to go work on his speech. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marah heads for the plane but comes back and tells him she loves him, she is disappointed he doesn't return the sentiment. She gets on the plane and then he says I love you to Marah. Michelle wants to continue to fight for Danny as mayor but Danny doesn't think so. Danny tells Ross it was a fierce campaign and he is sure Ross will make a great mayor because he is conceding. Michelle is upset that Danny has given up which is not like him and she wants to know what is really going on. Danny calls Jeffrey and tells him everything he did and Jeffrey says it is time for his public confession. R.J comes into Jeffrey's room for a visit. Jeffrey tells RJ he isn't sad and he then admits he is sad to RJ. He says all he is going to do is wallow and work and R.J tells him he works to much. Cassie asks if the allegations against Danny are true. Jeffrey says she should believe her friend but she should stay away from Danny or she might get caught up in something ugly that will effect her whole life. Alex has had Sandy and Alan out for dinner at which Sandy offers his idea for Lizzie to work at Spaulding. Joey and Lizzie bond over family problems. Frank wants Marina to move back home",

He told her he was planning to tell her tomorrow that he was going on a date with his girlfriend, Cassie, and to keep quiet about it.\n"
