Coop and Ava are upset at first, but Lizzie claims that she planned it while they were still together. Lizzie looks at it as her last chance to get Coop back. She locks Ava away after telling her about she and Coop sleeping together and tries to get back with Coop. He reminds her that things are done but she convinces him to have one last dance with her. Ava escapes and pushes Lizzie's face into the birthday cake. Lizzie calls her mom to complain and when she mentions her recent nausea at the thought of Coop and Ava, Beth says not to mention that word because of her morning sickness. It dawns on Lizzie that she may be pregnant and she takes a test just as Alan shows up to tell her that he is going to sue the Coopers for the way that they treated her. She convinces him to leave before he finds the test. Once he leaves though Buzz shows up to try and convince Lizzie that he knows that there is still a good person inside of her and then Coop shows up and takes her to the cemetery to her Dad's grave. He tells her that at the party she acted just like Phillip and could have hurt Ava to get what she wanted and tells her that she needs to move on. She finds out that she is pregnant and although is very upset about it at first, a talk with Lillian helps her to see that children can be a positive thing in their parent's lives. She goes to the cemetery to talk with her father and tells him that she wishes he were there because although he wouldn't be happy with her she knows he would be behind her."
