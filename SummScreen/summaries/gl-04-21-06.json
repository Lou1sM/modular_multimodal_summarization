    "tvmega_recap": "Harley is packing her things to leave the police force for Spaulding Enterprises and asks Mallet to keep an eye out on Gus. She is surprised by a going-away party from \"the guys\". Gus plans to take Zach and Jude to Zach's first T-Ball game. It is very apparent Gus is limping and in pain. He keeps muttering to himself that he can do this, referring to giving up drugs cold turkey and runs into Marina at Company. He tells her he has an interview with a nurse at Cedars but needs to take the boys to the game and Marina offers to help. Gus goes to Cedars and attempts to get a doctor to give him a prescription for pain medicine. The doctor tells him he will have to check Gus's medical records from Rick before he can do that. Suddenly, the doctor is called away to a \"code blue\" and Gus eyes the blank prescription pads in view. Harley tries to find Gus at Company only to be told by Ava that he had an interview. Harley shows up at Cedars in time to find Gus just after he has stolen the prescription pad. After Tammy and Jonathan make love, she remembers to tell him what she suspects about Lizzie. She tells Jonathan that after hearing Lizzie thank Rick for the pregnancy information, she thinks Lizzie is pregnant. She even thinks that there could be a possibility the baby isn't Coops. Jonathan looks shocked. After finally getting the courage to go into Company, Lizzie drags Coop to her apartment filled with new baby items and tells him the news; she is pregnant with his baby. Lizzie tells him that she plans on keeping this baby and he needs to decide what he's going to do. After extensive questioning of Lizzie, a confused Coop finally goes back to Company to face Ava. Jonathan suddenly shows up at Lizzie's apartment and asks, \"Hey, Goldilocks. Do you have something you want to tell me?\""
