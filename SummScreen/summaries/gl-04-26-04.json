    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Beacon, Cassie asks Tony if Danny is okay, mentioning he hadn't returned any of her calls. She also tells him Jeffrey had implied to her that Danny is guilty. When Tony asks her if she believes in Danny, Cassie wholeheartedly says she does and it is up to the people closest to Danny to make sure he rises above the latest setback. Before walking off, Tony tells Cassie he's not sure he even knows what Danny wants anymore. Lizzie comes to see Tammy, and Cassie says that maybe Tammy is still asleep, but Lizzie and she will soon go upstairs to check on her. \n\nUpstairs, after Tammy writes another entry in her diary, reminiscing about kissing Edmund the night before, he arrives to talk with her. She begins to get affectionate with him when he tells her that she'd been all pumped-up with adrenaline because of the play's success, and explains the kiss was a \"mistake.\" Shattered, Tammy withdraws from him and begins to cry. When he persists, wanting to talk things over with her, Tammy flees from the suite. Out in the hallway, Cassie and Lizzie are approaching. When Lizzie goes to follow Tammy, Edmund holds Cassie back. When she asks what happened, Edmund tells her that Tammy kissed him the night before! He explains how everything happened and how she had reacted to their talk just now. He asks Cassie what if Tammy is beginning to have feelings for him. Cassie tries to make light of the situation, but Edmund says even though Tammy's a teenager, it doesn't make her feelings any less important. Cassie says she'll have a talk with her, and Edmund says he thinks it is best that he keep his distance from Tammy until things are resolved. \n\nAt the Bauer house, after waking, Michelle joins Rick and Ed in the kitchen. She proceeds to criticize herself for how she's handling things---by running back to the house in which she was raised, but both Ed and Rick try to tell her it is her \"comfort zone.\" As she rails about the state of her marriage, Ed and Rick, trying to present an unbiased front, try not to voice their own opinions on Danny. \n\nBack at the Santos house, Danny plays with Robbie, who is missing his mommy. Jeffrey comes by and presents Danny with a plane ticket to New York City, telling him that he's to have a meeting with Salerno the day after next. Jeffrey expresses concern over the way Danny should handle the meeting, but he abruptly tells him not to worry. Tony arrives as Jeffrey is leaving, and is surprised he is there. Danny tells him Jeffrey and he were going over details of the \"deal\" they'd cut. When Tony learns Michelle had spent the night elsewhere, he is livid at Danny for letting Michelle slip through his fingers. When Danny seems unconcerned about the whole scenario, Tony gets angrier. But all Danny says is how foolish he'd been for thinking he could forget he was a Santos....Back at the Bauers, Michelle paces in her bedroom when she spots a framed wedding photo of Danny and her. She walks over, picks it up and throws it against a wall, smashing it. Cutting her finger on the glass, she picks it up, stares at the photo and cries, \"Oh, Danny ...look what you've done.\" \n\nOut in the Beacon courtyard, Tammy writes more in her diary and gets frustrated and hurt, then shoves her diary in a garbage pail---as Lizzie looks on from a doorway. Later, Lizzie tries to reach out to a distant Tammy, but all she will say is she recently did something stupid. After she leaves for a run, Lizzie recovers Tammy's diary from the garbage pail. \n\nElsewhere, Joey confides in Sandy, saying he is worried Tammy may be interested in someone else. Sandy advises Joey to fight for her and to maybe get assistance from a third party, someone who knows Tammy well. He suggests perhaps Joey surprise Tammy in a nice way. This sounds like a plan to Joey. \n\nIn her suite, Cassie tries to console herself over the knowledge of Tammy's infatuation with Edmund. She speaks aloud to Richard, telling him if he were here, this wouldn't be happening. \n\nLizzie, in the corridor outside the suite, finishes reading the latest entries in Tammy's diary. Approaching the door to Cassie's suite, she notices a cleaning cart stationed there. She grabs a piece of paper and jots down the words, \"Tammy dropped this\" and places the diary and the accompanying note on the floor outside the door and knocks. As she hides behind the cleaning cart, Lizzie grins as she watches Cassie open the door, read the note, pick up the diary and re-enter the suite... \n\nBack at the Bauers, Rick tells Ed that he's sick of watching Danny disillusion Michelle time and again, and adds he's never going to change. Ed remarks that Danny is Michelle's husband and Robbie's father and they don't have a right not to give a damn about him, but Rick is firm in his opinion. Ed tells him it's up to Michelle to decide what's best for her. Upstairs in her room, Michelle has the radio on, and when she hears a newscaster give a scathing commentary on Danny, she knocks the radio to the floor. Later, after noticing Michelle has left the house, Rick tells his father one of them should've spoken up and told her what they thought, but Ed says it wouldn't have made a difference. When Ed says Michelle and he did okay without a father for years, Rick says if they'd had him around, maybe they wouldn't have made some bad decisions over the years and maybe she would never have married Danny. \n\nAt the Santos house, a stressed-out Danny sits back on the couch, lost in thought. The front door opens and Michelle enters. Slowly walking into the living room, she looks down at Danny...\n\n\n",
