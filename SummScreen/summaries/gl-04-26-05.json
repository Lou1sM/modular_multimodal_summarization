She is furious that Cassie has threatened to place a restraining order against her and Ross for trying to help their daughter.  But Ross has been fighting this fight for a long time, and wonders how long he can keep bailing Dinah out of trouble.  Vanessa says they should help until Dinah starts to make good decisions - but Ross wonders if that will ever happen.  To make matters worse, Ross sees that the front page newspaper headline is about him!  \"Mayor tries to kidnap daughter - fails!\" is blasted on the front page and he hits the roof!\n\n\nAlso angry is Cassie who could not be blamed if she thought the whole world was going crazy around her because it is!  She finds that Dinah is hiding her milk when she should be drinking it - Edmund thinks they should wait to tell the boys about Dinah's condition - and Ross and Vanessa show up at her doorstep seething with anger directed at her!  Ross blames Edmund for the newspaper cover.  Dinah rushes to Edmund's defense.   Vanessa and Ross try to convince Dinah that Edmund is using her and that he will \"throw her on the scrapheap\" after the baby is born.  Such an argument ensues that Dinah leaves the house, unnoticed.  Cassie tells Ross and Vanessa to leave and after they do, she tells Edmund she wants him to leave, also.  He thinks that maybe he will....and he'll leave town, too.\n\n\nTony is hurt and angry about the change in Michelle's attitude.  Just a few days ago, she was ready to marry him - but now she insists on telling Danny how much she loves him and doesn't want to lose him.  Tony convinces Michelle to go with him to the lake where \"it all began,\" where he first started to care for her.  Against her better judgment, she agrees.  Meanwhile in another spot near the lake, Danny has taken Marina to show her the sunrise and to prove to her that he is \"moving on.\"  She wants to believe him, but she thinks he needs some time alone to think.  She leaves to work at Company and Danny is left with his pleasant thoughts of Michelle.   Tony, however, is starting to get rough with Michelle and grabs and shakes her.  She screams at him to stop and Danny hears her.  He yells at Tony to leave Michelle alone.\n\n\nBlake is not happy to see Sebastian and Holly huddled in a corner in Olivia's bar.  Sebastian is presenting the Spaulding deal to take over Holly's newspaper.  Holly tells Sebastian it isn't a deal -- it's a \"mugging.\"  Sebastian agrees and tells Holly to refuse the deal but Alan appears out of nowhere and wonders what Sebastian is up to.  Smooth as ever, Sebastian tells him he was bargaining with Holly, but gives up his spot in the negotiation to Alan.  Holly and Alan come to an agreement after Holly remains on staff and on the newspaper's board.  Meanwhile, Blake has questions for her brother.  What is he up to?  What does he want with her mother?  Why did he take a job with Alan Spaulding, of all people?  Sebastian admits to Blake that his plan is to bring the Spaulding organization down - exactly what their father, Roger, tried to do.  Blake insists on helping him and he tries to turn her down.  He reconsiders, however, when she tells him she used to work at Spaulding and understands the organization.  The two go on to stage a little \"argument\" for Holly and Alan.  Blake admonishes her mother for selling the paper to Alan and turns to Sebastian and calls him a traitor.  She has a little too much fun when she throws a drink in his face and leaves the group in shock!\n\n\n",
