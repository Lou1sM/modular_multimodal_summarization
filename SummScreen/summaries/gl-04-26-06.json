He is locked in his room and starts to panic. When he is told that he must participate in an exercise program, he makes an excuse to go back to his room for something. In the meantime, Harley is at Company talking to Zach and Jude. She explains that Gus will be away for awhile and receives a phone call that Gus has left the center. As she curses Gus, he suddenly appears telling her he needs to go to the place of his demons, the cabin. Mallet and Dinah wait in a car talking about how to usurp Harley as CEO of Spaulding. He tells Dinah that things are like with Hart and that Harley slept with her boyfriend. He says that they need to tell about Gus's addiction. He shows her a gun and tells her that it's time to work on Harley. Harley and Gus go to the cabin where Beth held him hostage. He goes through the agony of cold-turkey withdrawal. Harley stands by his side trying to get him to focus on pleasant things. He goes ballistic and starts to fight with her, trying to get away. They physically fight and she ends up tackling him and tells him he will have to go through her to leave. As Harley is reading to Gus and consoling him, Dinah calls faking a bad connection and telling Harley, \"Zach and Jude emergency Company\". Harley rushes to the boys. Mallet seizes the opportunity to try and lure Gus back into taking pills by showing him a bottle of them. Gus is strong, however and resists. When Harley talks to Dinah and realizes all is well with the boys, she returns to the cabin. Gus makes her lock him in the room where he was held captive. He goes through a frightening withdrawal experience, screaming, crying and hallucinates, seeing Mallet, Alan, Alexandra and Beth taunting him. After agonizing hours, he asks Harley to let him out and they return to Company. He is refreshed and healthier, reading to Zach and Jude, beating the addiction withdrawal. Harley is glad to have him back, but as the closing music plays, looks on at her three guys with a worried look on her face."
