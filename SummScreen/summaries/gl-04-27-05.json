He has changed his tune about her memory of Phillip's murder and instead of writing it off as wishful thinking, he offers to help her to find out if the memory is authentic. Harley doesn't want Mallet's help but she tells him enough for him to go off on his own. He takes off, looking for answers and encounters Alan who is delighted to see him. In a not very subtle way, Alan encourages Mallet to look out for Harley so that Gus can find something else to do with his life.\n\n\nAlan meets with Vanessa and does his best to reassure her that any worries she might have about Olivia, her new daughter-in-law are moot since he happens to know that Bill and Olivia are on the rocks. Thus, it comes as a major shock to Vanessa when she shows up at Bill's apartment to find the couple not only together but acting downright frisky in bed! \n\n\nMarina is determined not to sit around pining over Danny, even though he hasn't called her as promised. Instead, she stays upbeat and pays a late night visit to her Aunt Harley. Eager for good news, Harley is overjoyed to hear that Marina's in love with Danny and that he is free now to treat her niece as she deserves. Meanwhile, Danny is at Laurel Falls, being confronted by a furious Tony who now knows about the night she and Danny made love. In his rage and pain, Tony hurls himself at Danny and during the struggle, they both go over the edge. Michelle manages to grab each of them but their combined weight is too much to bear. Realizing what has to happen, Tony makes the sacrifice and lets go of Michelle's hand, only to plummet into the water below. Once safe, Danny climbs down to retrieve Tony from the water and he and Michelle desperately begin CPR.  \n\n\n",
