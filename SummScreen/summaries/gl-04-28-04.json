Then Cassie tells them Tammy kissed Edmund. After telling them her daughter \"gushed\" about the one-sided kiss in her diary, Cassie admits she's scared. But Reva points out that Tammy is fatherless and when charming Edmund came into the picture and tried to nurture her, it would have been nearly impossible for an impressionable teenage girl to resist. \n\n\nOutside Phillip's room at Ravenwood, Olivia is on her phone with her stockbroker, telling him he should've bought more Spaulding stock. It is mentioned that she now has a 25% controlling interest, but someone else is buying up stock as well. Just then, Rick walks out of Phillip's room and tells Olivia that Phillip's clear-headed and calm, reminding her not to upset him. When she sees him, she puts on the charm and concern, and the two exchange phony niceties. When Olivia drops a copy of the Springfield Journal, Phillip wants to read it. But she suggests he read magazines instead. When Phillip begins to read the paper, he discovers Spaulding stock has plummeted and asks Olivia why. She ends up informing him of the federal investigation into Spaulding Enterprises, and he hits the roof! \n\n\nIn his suite at the Beacon, Jeffrey envisions Marah sitting on the side of his bed. He tells her that he loves her, yet he hates her for changing him forever. He also says it is best she is in France because being close to him for the next while would probably be dangerous for her. Later, in the lobby, he runs into Rick and congratulates him on his daughter Leah's birth. Jeffrey fishes around; asking him about Michelle and Danny, but Rick is closed-mouthed. \n\n\nAlan and Alexandra come along and congratulate Rick as well. He tells them Phillip is doing well today. When they learn Olivia is visiting Phillip at the moment, the two rush to Ravenwood. When they enter Phillip's room, he is livid with them for keeping the current state of Spaulding Enterprises from him. He is extremely nervous about the low value of Spaulding stock. Olivia, meanwhile, insists she was only telling her husband the truth and she didn't want to start their marriage on the wrong foot by keeping secrets from him. After sending Alex and Olivia out of the room, Alan warns Phillip about Olivia, explaining the longer Phillip's laid-up at Ravenwood, the longer she can wield her power at Spaulding. When Phillip asks what Alan means, he is flabbergasted to learn he'd inadvertently signed his voting proxy over to Olivia! \n\n\nAt the crisis center, Harley is busy manning the phones when Eden arrives. Harley explains she can't leave because Marina's late and someone has to be around to answer the phones. Eden suggests she help out. Stuck for words, Harley diplomatically tries to tell her she doesn't exactly have the knack for such things when a call comes in. Eden grabs the phone and takes the call. Before too long, she is shouting into the phone at some man who'd cheated on his girlfriend! Marina arrives and handles the call. Later, Eden comments on how lucky the three of them are that they each have a good man who loves them. After she leaves, Marina tells Harley that Frank wants her to move back home. She wants to make her father happy, but Harley tells her to focus on her own happiness first. Marina says she wishes she were more like Harley, who gets a bit embarrassed. Marina says she envies Harley because she is independent, can do what she wants and STILL has a great guy who loves her. \n\n\nBack at the Lewis home, Cassie tells Reva how rotten she felt for reading Tammy's diary, but Reva insists it was the right thing to do. Edmund arrives shortly, and tells Cassie he'd been trying to reach her. Before too long, the four of them are discussing the situation concerning Tammy. Reva and Josh are cautiously cordial to Edmund and give him the benefit of the doubt. \n\n\nJeffrey arrives unexpectedly and Reva takes him outside to learn why he came over. He gives Reva a book on France which he'd assumed was packed with Marah's things on the plane. He begins to leave, but Reva says he probably wanted to hear about Marah, which he does. Reva tells him Marah is fine, but lonely and missing Jeffrey, even angry at him, but she was meeting with designers. When she tries to offer him Marah's phone number, Jeffrey declines, saying it's much better if Marah keeps her distance at the moment, because it could be dangerous. He suggests to Reva that she dissuade Marah from returning to Springfield for the next while. Reva says she will. \n\n\nLater, back inside, Cassie tells her sister she doesn't feel prepared to handle the situation with Tammy, but Reva convinces her to grab the bull by the horns and face it dead-on. She even convinces her to reveal to Tammy that she'd read her diary, which leaves Cassie's mind spinning. After Edmund and Cassie leave, she tells Edmund he is a part of her life and her family and she's determined not to lose him over this. The two pledge their love for one another. \n\n\nBack at Ravenwood, Phillip explains to Alan that he was doped-up on medication when Olivia asked him to sign something, something that she'd said \"wasn't important.\" Meanwhile, out in the corridor, Olivia wants to go back into Phillip's room, but Alexandra stops her, asking her what she could possibly be worried about...Back inside the room, Alan tells Phillip that because Olivia didn't tell him what he was signing, the proxy is null and void. As a result they can get her thrown out of Spaulding. After some thought, Phillip says he doesn't want to do that---he wants Olivia left where she is so he can keep a close eye on her. Alan admits she is sharp, and Phillip agrees, adding Olivia's so sharp, eventually she's going to get cut! \n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Edmund joins Cassie at Reva and Josh's to ask for advice on how to handle the whole situation with Tammy. Josh and Reva both offer what advice they can. Jeffrey visits to return something Marah forgot before going off to Paris. Reva agrees to encourage her to stay in Paris. Eden tries her hand at answering phones for the hot line. Her first try does not turn out well. Olivia visits Philip and tells him of the problems Spaulding Enterprises is encountering. As Alan deals with the fallout, he informs Philip of Olivia having his signed proxy. Philip had no idea what he signed. He tells Alan to leave Olivia right where she is so they can watch his slippery wife very closely.",
