Alex said that all the evidence points to Alan as being the stalker. When Reva came into contact with Alex, she flinched, then told Alex that she's in serious danger. Reva then told a shaken Alex that she senses that the stalker is somebody Alan knows, that Alan knows this and is plotting revenge. After her little act, Reva left. Alan arrived at Harley's and, in a pleasant mood, as he was beginning to tell her and Gus about a plan he's hatched to get revenge on Alex, Reva arrived. Reva told Alan that by the time she left the mansion, Alexandra was left shaking in her boots. Alan and Reva laughed about their plan as Gus and Harley listened. When Gus suggested Alan let Alex squirm and suffer before reeling her in, Alan told Gus he likes the way he thinks---and called him \"son\". Harley took Reva aside as a down-to- earth Alan told Gus that everything Regina said was the complete truth, that the news had thrown him for a loop and now he truly believes that Gus is his son. After Gus went off with Reva to prepare Alan some breakfast, Harley told Alan that yesterday he ran both Regina and Gus through the wringer, but now that he needs Gus' help, he's being too nice and welcoming to Gus, warning Alan that if he's jerking Gus around to do his bidding, he'll be sorry. She also warned Alan about trying to get Gus into the backstabbing Spaulding ways. Later, as Harley was filling Reva in about the connection between Alan and Gus, Gus told Alan that Alexandra should be made to suffer. Alan slowly turned to Gus and told him that he spoke \"like a true Spaulding\". A pro baseball scout went to \"Company\" and told Marina he's been keeping an eye on Shayne's remarkable talent and Marina sat with him and wholeheartedly endorsed Shayne. Later, Josh and Shayne entered and sat with the scout to discuss Shayne's talent, but Josh was a little too enthusiastic and over- bearing. Later, the scout spoke to Marina about Shayne's father's attitude and asked her to speak to Josh. As Josh was leaving, Marina relayed what the scout had said to her, that sometimes the fathers of promising, up and coming athletes are too overbearing and overzealous and try to monopolize their sons' budding careers, but Josh laughed and told Marina that she must have misunderstood the scout. He told Marina to mind her own business and that Shayne's future is HIS concern. Later, Buzz took Josh aside and told him that he overheard the scout talking to Marina and that Marina didn't misunderstand at all. Josh told Buzz that when he was Shayne's age, he had a chance to become a pro-baseball player, but that he blew his chance and doesn't want Shayne to make the same mistakes HE made. Outside, Shayne was overcome with excitement at the prospect that the scout is interested in him and will be watching when the next game is played. When Lizzie noticed a stack of mail for Phillip, Nolan informed her that Phillip's moved out and is living at a loft somewhere. Lizzie ordered Nolan to send the driver around to take her to Phillip's. Just as Phillip was telling Olivia how he's dreading to tell Lizzie about all the changes that have occurred since she was last in town, Lizzie arrived at the loft. Lizzie was irritated to learn that Olivia was living with Phillip, then Lizzie noticed that Olivia is pregnant. Keeping her true feelings under wraps, she asked her father if he was happy, and when Phillip said he was, Lizzie told him that's all that mattered. After Phillip left the room to get Lizzie some money, Olivia told Lizzie she's glad she's back, then said she wants Lizzie to be a part of the baby's life. Lizzie snidely told Olivia she doesn't know if the baby will be her brother or sister OR her uncle or aunt, and told Olivia she's obviously found a way to make a permanent foothold in the Spaulding family. Later, Lizzie met up with Tammy and the two went to \"Company\". Lizzie was floored when she found out that Tammy already knew that Olivia was pregnant and living with Phillip. Lizzie then overheard part of a radio show where Alan's sanity was being discussed. After Tammy turned the radio down, Lizzie fumed that everyone seems bent on keeping secrets from her. Back at the loft, both Olivia and Phillip agreed that Lizzie seemed to handle the news TOO calmly. A frantic Alexandra arrived, telling them that Alan's stalking her. After telling them about the phone call, Olivia and Phillip were skeptical. Alexandra told Phillip that his father's crazy as a loon and is coming after them and that they have to go on the offense. Before leaving, she looked pointedly at Phillip and cryptically told him that she's not the only one with a vested interest in this....."
