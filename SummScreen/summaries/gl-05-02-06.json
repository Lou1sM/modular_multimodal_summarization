Cassie walks away as Jeffrey and Blake share a photo-op and Jeffrey pats Blake on the behind. Cassie, lurking about, watches this display and leaves in a huff. Frank meets up with Jeffrey and Blake asking Jeffrey if he could compare notes about Ross's plane crash. Blake wonders what all the talk is about as Frank tells her that Ross's female assistant had a female life partner. She realizes that Ross wasn't having an affair and asks Jeffrey how long he knew. Jeffrey doesn't answer her when she asks if it was before he slept with her. Reva wants to be discharged from Cedars and Josh sneaks her home. They share a tender moment kissing and drinking champagne. He gets her back to Cedars and both think they have fooled the nurse. The nurse tells them she knew they were gone. Josh presents Reva with an engagement ring engraved with \"always\" and set with stones to represent the children, including Jonathan. Jonathan and Coop fight and crash through Company. Coop takes the blame. Coop dotes on Lizzie and makes a meal for her. Lizzie loves the attention. Ashley, Lizzie's friend at the OB-GYN clinic; the one who fixed her medical records, finds her at Company. A startled Lizzie tells Ashley that she cannot go shopping with her today because Coop was injured. Jonathan overhears their conversation and asks Ashley to grab coffee with him, telling her his name is Nate. He proceeds to find out that she works with her uncle-doctor who is an OB-GYN. He asks her for her phone number telling her that they will be spending a lot of time together. Ashley is under the misunderstanding that Jonathan is interested in her for other reasons. Reva is finally given the okay to be released but rubs her left shoulder and looks as if she is in pain. The doctor notices and asks to examine her. As she does, a concerned look comes over her as she asks Reva, \"When was the last time you had a mammogram\"? Reva's face freezes."
