Ross comes along, saying Blake is shopping nearby as well. Grateful for the interruption, Bill spends time with Ross while Eden goes to a jewelry store. The two men discuss the election fiasco and how it is affecting Bill's and Michelle's friendship. He tells Ross he's finally happy now, with his new job and upcoming wedding, things are finally under control. \n\n\nAt the crisis center, Jeffrey presents Michelle with plane tickets to London. He tells her to leave with Robbie so they won't be around if the mob decides to squeeze information out of her. She refuses, saying Danny stands a much better chance at surviving if he has her in his corner. Michelle bitterly accuses Jeffrey of being the true source of danger, since HE was the one who placed her family in this position. \n\n\nLater, Michelle nervously watches the clock tick away. Mel and Harley arrive, saying she isn't scheduled to help out, but Michelle insists she needs something to occupy her time. Mel asks how things are between Danny and her, and she makes light of the situation. Aside, Mel tells Harley about Michelle spending one night at the Bauer house recently. Harley thinks of a plan to cheer up Michelle and Danny. While whispering the details to Mel, Michelle walks over, assuming the two are whispering about the rumors regarding Danny. Upset, she assures them Danny was set up, and says if they don't believe her, she doesn't want anything to do with them. Mel and Harley approach a sobbing Michelle and embrace her. \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Reva arrives to help Cassie deal with Tammy, who is still holed up in her room. Lizzie is nearby in the lobby listening to Edmund and them discussing the situation. When Edmund wants to go upstairs with Cassie and Reva, Reva suggests things would go better if he remained downstairs. Joey arrives and after Lizzie realizes he is looking for Tammy, she lies and says she isn't home. After sending him off to get sodas, she calls Tammy on her cell phone and tells her she heard Tammy had locked herself in her room. Lizzie congratulates her on the control maneuver and promises she'll bring some food to her room shortly. After she dispatches a bellhop to get junk food and a meal from the restaurant, Joey returns. Lizzie lies again, saying Tammy is now at Company waiting...When Jeffrey enters the lobby and approaches the main desk, he overhears Edmund, who is talking on the phone. He sounds pretty edgy about a \"shipment\" that was not delivered on time... \n\n\nIn New York City, while pointing a gun at Danny, Tony orders him to go home to Michelle and Robbie, but he refuses. Salerno escorts Danny inside a restaurant, where several of his associates are seated at a table. When he rehashes the election debacle, Vinnie asks Danny why he wasn't in jail, but he smirks and says Jeffrey can't put him away based solely on rumors. Danny tells Salerno he wants to work for him. Although he's already given back some prime turf, Danny doesn't expect to start at the top and will start at the bottom and work hard. At first, Salerno is unsure on which side of the fence Danny is, but he affirms he's back for good. Salerno tries to get Tony's opinion, but Danny interrupts and says Tony probably doesn't want him to be part of the team because he fears he'll slink back under his shadow again. Tony tries to punch Danny, but Salerno breaks it up. He informs Danny that he'll start working in a position below Tony and he'll have to deal with people he never had to deal with before. Later, Salerno tells Danny that he intends on sending Jeffrey O'Neill a very clear and strong \"message.\" Danny talks him out of doing it himself, saying he hates O'Neill as well and wants to deal with him personally. \n\n\nAfter trying to reason with Tammy through her bedroom door, Reva returns to the lobby and reports things didn't go too well. Lizzie offers to help, noting she isn't a parental figure and she is close to Tammy's age. When Cassie consents, Lizzie starts up the stairs, but obtains the food order from the bellhop first. Upstairs, Lizzie gets Tammy to open her door by revealing she knows all about her kissing Edmund! When Tammy asks how she found out, Lizzie says she saw the kiss with her own eyes. She tells Tammy that she shouldn't be ashamed, she thought it was cool! Down in the lobby, Edmund berates himself for the situation with Tammy while Cassie assures him that he's done nothing wrong. She says Edmund's done everything to prove himself to her and others and she knows he wouldn't do anything to jeopardize their happiness. While she hugs him, a worried expression crosses over Edmund's face...Outside the Beacon, Reva and Jeffrey speak. She tells him she knows he must be missing Marah and he agrees that he does, but asserts it's best if he doesn't contact her right now. When Reva tries to ask about the \"dangerous situation\" Jeffrey previously had mentioned he avoids answering the question. \n\n\nAfter noticing it was well past 6 pm, Michelle recalls Danny telling her he'd be back in Springfield on the 6 o'clock flight. She calls her house and retrieves a message from the answering machine: a call had come in from Danny, informing her he'd be back later than expected...Back in New York City, Salerno approaches Danny in an alley beside the restaurant and accuses him of not being genuine and putting on an act. When Danny asks what he means, Salerno tells Danny that he's going to have a lot more to worry about than a missed flight to Springfield---a LOT more! \n \n\n\n",
