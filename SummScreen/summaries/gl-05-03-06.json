Reluctantly, Reva has the test done after waiting for hours for her turn. She cries softly during the procedure. Afterwards, the same physician tells her she needs to talk to another physician about further testing; a needle biopsy for the mammogram showed something. Reva has the biopsy and the doctor tells her he will call with the results. After leaving and walking around, she realizes she cannot wait for the phone call and returns only to find another doctor assigned to her case; an oncologist. Reva is shocked that he is a cancer doctor. He explains in clinical terms about what he needs to do; a lumpectomy. Reva is less than pleased with the doctor and lights into him about the fact that he treats her as a \"color-coded number\". He turns the tables on her and informs her that she didn't have mammograms as she should have and needs to take responsibility. She agrees to the surgery the next morning. Reva goes for the surgery the next morning. Reva tells the doctor that she hasn't told her husband about the surgery. After she wakes up from the surgery, the doctor tells her that he is waiting on the laboratory results to see if the mass is benign or malignant and will call her. A sore Reva goes home and strolls around town. She receives a call from the doctor and goes back for the results. A shocked Reva walks out of her doctor's office. She hears the words echoing, \"As we feared, the tumor we removed from your breast was malignant\". Reva goes home to Josh. As she tries to tell him that she has something to tell him, he takes her away for her surprise at Cross Creek. She realizes that Cross Creek has been refurbished and is excited to see most of the original furniture. Josh tells her that he bought the place back from Olivia and now is theirs. He proceeds to tell her about the plans for the long-term care facility. He realizes she was trying to tell him something and Reva tells him it is nothing. . She grabs a knife and Josh's hand. They walk to the mantle and carve the word, \"forever\" under their names and the word \"always\". He hugs her and whispers, \"Now everything is right where it should be and that's the way it's going to stay always\". Reva looks sad"
