She tells him that she will tell him all about Lizzie if he agrees to do this. He obliges and when they come back from the \"date\", he kisses her. She never notices him as he slips his hand in her purse, retrieving her keys. \"Gotcha\", he says after a smitten Ashley walks away. Dinah tries to find out where Alan-Michael is. Gus visits Mallet's apartment and tells him what really happened on the night of the shooting. An angry Mallet makes him promise to keep an eye on Dinah. Gus finds Dinah after she has broken into Alan-Michael's apartment. While they are there, Dinah finds a piece of paper with a flight number on it. She keeps the information to herself. At Company, Olivia tells Buzz and Frank they need to make up and quit placing her in the middle of their arguments. At Lizzie's apartment, Alan has a little talk with Coop about the financial burden of raising a child. Coop, after hearing Alan out, tells an elated Lizzie that he will take responsibility and not leave his child without a father as he had to live. As Lizzie and Coop are strolling along Main Street, Mel approaches Lizzie telling her she has her chart with the conception date. As the closing music builds to a climax, a horrified Lizzie sees the date: April 10th. When Coop wants to see the chart, Lizzie clings to it, not letting go."
