They discuss how Gus is going to turn down Alan's generous trust fund, but he points out how the money would come in handy. Harley insists if Gus accepts the money, there'll be strings attached. A minute later, Alan arrives. Gus tells him, \"Thanks, but no thanks.\" When Alan asks what the problem is, Gus says he and Harley like things the way they are. Alan tells him he can try to ignore the trust fund, but it can't be undone. Maybe someday he'll need the money. Alan asserts he's not trying to buy his affection, and Gus says he already HAS his affection. Gus asks how the federal investigation is going over at Spaulding Enterprises and Alan reports although every employee has been questioned and the feds have gone through all the records, they can't find the drug connection. Gus hints he's doing an investigation of his own, but won't tell Alan how. \n\n\nRick checks up on Phillip and gives him a glowing report on his improvement. Olivia, who is there with Emma, leaves the baby with Phillip in order to speak with Rick out in the hall. She complains the nursing staff is keeping her out of the loop about Phillip's actual treatment. She asks him point-blank exactly what sort of treatment Phillip is receiving. Rick tells her to ask Phillip himself....Lizzie sneaks into Phillip's room and is happy to see Emma there, too. Phillip is unnerved to hear from her that Olivia pretty much keeps Emma under lock and key. He lets Lizzie hold Emma. Olivia is livid when she sees Lizzie holding Emma, and takes the baby from her. When Lizzie says she's done nothing wrong, Olivia quipped it's what she's done up to this POINT which is a cause for worry. When Phillip suggests someday Lizzie will get to baby sit Emma, Olivia silently grits her teeth. \n\n\nOver at Harley's Angels, Eden arrives with a rack of bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses to show Harley. At first, Eden gets a little touchy-feely and remarks at how much their relationship's changed from the time Harley first brought her to Springfield in handcuffs. Eden sincerely apologizes for all the trouble she caused, explaining she'd felt threatened at losing Gus' love. Focusing on her agenda, Harley begins to make references to Paris in order to gauge Eden's reaction. Pushing the envelope further, Harley tells Eden that Marie Green had seen her on the arm of Vinnie Salerno in Paris a couple years back. Eden suddenly dissolves, telling Harley she'd been one of Vinnie's toys, just like his speedboats and race cars. Vinnie had terrorized her and she'd been scared the whole time. When Harley asks if Brad and she had been an item back then, Eden denies it, saying Salerno would've killed them both. However, the prospect of danger made Brad more amorous. She also admits it was at this time she got the idea to start \"The Garden Of Eden.\" Tearfully, she insists she broke away from Salerno's control, and pleads with Harley not to tell Bill or Gus about it. Harley agrees. Eden basically admits Salerno still has some control over her life and if he doesn't want her to marry Bill, he'll make it so. Harley tells her not to handle Vinnie alone, but she states she and Harley are finally getting along and she doesn't want to put her life in danger. \n\n\nGus goes undercover to buy more \"Delirium\", but this time a different dealer shows up. Just as Gus is paying the dealer for the drugs, two cops suddenly bust them. When one cop mentions that he looks familiar, Gus shuts him up by punching him! Later, Gus apologizes to the cop, saying he didn't want his cover blown. Frank arrives and reads Gus the riot act for being a vigilante, but once he explains things and asks him to use him, Frank tells Gus to write up a full report on what information he's gained thus far. If the situation merits it, he'll hand it over to Vice for an official investigation. \n\n\nCassie and Edmund go to Tammy's door with a breakfast tray, where he tries to talk her into leaving the room. It nearly works, but Tammy remains steadfast. Later, in the lobby, Edmund tells Cassie they're going to handle it as though it were a hostage situation (the \"bad\" Tammy holding the \"good\" Tammy prisoner). They go upstairs, take the untouched breakfast tray away, and arrange for the electricity and phone service to be cut off from Tammy's room. In the room, when the lights suddenly go out, Tammy shouts complaints to Cassie, who lies and says she'd look into it. Just then, Joey puts a ladder up to Tammy's balcony and climbs up. He tells her he knows about her being angry at Edmund for something, but when he asks what it is, Tammy avoids answering the question. Meanwhile, worried when she hasn't heard anything from Tammy's room in a while, Cassie asks Edmund to break in somehow. Out on the balcony, Joey proceeds to sing \"Your Song\" to Tammy. She is really moved by the gesture. Later, once Cassie and Edmund get into Tammy's room, she is nowhere to be found. She eventually walks in. Cassie takes a hard line with Tammy, berating her for locking herself in her room. Cassie agrees to table the discussion so Tammy can go to school to take a math test. Later, down in the lobby, Lizzie arrives and is stunned to see Tammy with Joey. After asking about the intended \"plan\", Tammy simply states it was working, but Joey had convinced her to leave her room. As they head off to school, Lizzie looks fit to be tied! \n\n\nGus arrives at Harley's Angels just as Harley is trying on a bridesmaid's gown. After poking fun at the gown, Gus grabs Harley and plants a kiss on her. Eden comes out of the back wearing one of the selections from the bridal gown collection. After Eden realizes the dress isn't the right choice, Harley hints maybe Eden's brother could possibly help her out of a situation. When Gus gets curious, Eden covers, saying Harley had meant something else instead. \n\n\nOlivia tells Phillip pigs will fly before Lizzie ever gets to baby sit Emma. She accuses Phillip of endangering Emma's life, but he says she is over-reacting. He tells her Lizzie's a huge part of his life and Olivia should've known when she made the arrangements to marry him. Looking squarely at Phillip, Olivia tells him she knows he's up to something, but isn't sure exactly what it is. After she walks off, an expression of steely determination crosses Phillip's face...  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Harley tells Gus on the phone that he needs to turn down Alan's inheritance. Gus reluctantly goes along with it and tells Alan that. Alan tells him that he can't reverse it but maybe Gus will need the money someday. Harley wonders how Eden is involved with the Greens. Eden and Harley meet so that Eden can try on wedding dresses. Harley quizzes her about Paris, so Eden thinks Harley knows everything. She spills it all to Harley that Salerno was obsessed with her and kept her as his \"toy\". Brad Green used to hit on her and she got the idea of starting the escort service from how he acted with her. Harley feels great sympathy to Eden's plight and wants to help her, but Eden doesn't want to risk Harley being endangered from Salerno, too. Eden hopes that she is able to marry Bill but fears the future; she asks Harley not to tell Bill. Later, Harley is trying on wedding dresses, too, when Gus comes in. He is glad to see them getting along. Harley asks Eden to tell Gus about Salerno, but she won't. At the Beacon, Tammy won't come out of her room. Edmund and Cassie try to get her out by first talking to her, then cutting off her phone and electricity. Joey puts a ladder to her window and climbs up. She feels better after talking to him. He sings his song to her. Cassie gets Edmund to open the door, but Tammy is gone. She comes in behind them and says she's going to school. Cassie is annoyed and lectures her. Olivia is concerned about Philip and begs Rick to tell her what's going on with his treatment, but Rick won't tell her. She leaves the baby with Philip, who in turn lets Lizzie hold her, so Olivia freaks out and takes the baby back. There is tension between Philip and Olivia about that; Olivia tells him that Lizzie will not get near her daughter. Gus poses undercover as a drug dealer but gets busted by cops. Frank is called and he yells at Gus for doing police work on his own. Gus explains he's trying to figure out where the drugs at Spaulding came from, so Frank agrees to let him work with them.",
