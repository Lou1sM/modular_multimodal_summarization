However, she does suggest that Edmund come along with them as well. Dinah, who's overheard everything, invites herself along by pointing out to Edmund that her parents could come along when she's alone and whisk her away to Europe. Later, on the way to DC, Jeffrey's car breaks down and the group is stranded. Edmund tells Dinah that he plans to take advantage of this situation by going with Cassie for help.

Buzz, who's shocked to finally see Gus, tries to get him to go to the hospital, but Gus refuses. Gus tells Buzz (within earshot of Lizzie) that Alan locked him in the basement of the mansion, but he turned the tables and has Alan locked away now. Gus keeps telling Buzz that he has to go in and see Harley, but Buzz can't see a way for that to happen. Suddenly, as if by fate, a drunken prison guard staggers into the place. While Buzz serves the already inebriated guard a beer, Gus makes plans to knock him over the head. However, before he has a chance, Buzz is able to trick the guard into stripping off his clothes. Armed with the guard's clothes, Gus has the perfect means to get into the prison. \n\n\nStraight from hearing about Alan locking up Gus, Lizzie hurries out of Company and grabs Coop to help her get Alan out. They go to the basement and after a while end up finding the room where Alan is. However, when Alan pleads to be let out, Lizzie asks if what Gus said true.. Did Alan lock him up? Alan claims his innocent, but Lizzie doesn't believe him and is reluctant to let him out. Coop, who's freaking out because Alan is, accuses Lizzie of being cruel and demands that she unlock the door. Lizzie maintains that she's scared because of what Alan did to Gus. She's afraid because it's something her father would have done near the end. Lizzie then surprises Coop by suggesting that Gus could be right about Harley--she could be innocent and Lizzie is upset because Alan doesn't even seem to care about who really killed Phillip, he just wants someone to pay. Finally, Lizzie agrees to let Alan out. When Alan sees Coop, he goes ballistic and attacks him, forcing Lizzie to threaten to lock him back in there if he doesn't stop. Shocked at what she just said, Alan demands to know why she didn't open the door for him right away. Alan blames Coop and Lizzie admits that it was, because Coop opened her eyes to what her family was. Lizzie defiantly tells Alan that she doesn't want to end up like him or her father and leaves. Later, outside Company, Lizzie reveals her fear to Coop that she'll end up being like the rest of her family. Coop assures her that she doesn't have to and gives her a hug. In the meantime, Alan's on the phone telling someone that it's time--Harley Cooper has to disappear. \n\n\nMallet is trying to keep Harley awake in his office since she's suffering from a concussion from the beating the fired guards gave her. Harley, who initially called Mallet \"Gus\", keeps maintaining that she's fine and wants to go back to her cell, but she's extremely wobbly and Mallet won't let her leave the office. He wants her to spend the night in the infirmary, but then learns there are no beds there tonight; she's stuck in his office. In order to keep Harley from falling asleep, Mallet takes her to the balcony for some fresh air while he reminisces about the time they were in the root cellar during the Weatherill case. Mallet asks Harley if she ever thinks about them, but she says no. Harley starts to get a little angry and tells Mallet he's a jerk, just like he was when they first met at the Academy and he was so hard on her. Mallet admits that the reason he was hard on her was because he was in love with her. When Mallet asks if talking about the past makes her uncomfortable, she states that it makes her angry. He suggests that she's angry because it still hurts. Harley doesn't admit it and asks Mallet why he's here now. He doesn't give her an answer. While a tired Harley rests her eyes, with her head on his lap, Gus enters the office. \n\n\n\n\n",
