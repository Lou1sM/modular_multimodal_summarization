Cassie urges Tammy to talk about her feelings for Edmund and the hurtful things she said earlier.  However, Tammy is still angry with her mother and feels like Cassie is hindering  her independence.  She then walks away from Cassie, without telling her where she's going and ripping  up a Mother's Day car right in front of her.  Tammy then goes to the mall to see Joey.  Joey's still trying to figure out what's going on between her and her mom, and Tammy tells him that Cassie just expects her to be perfect.  When Joey states that he hopes Tammy didn't mention she was going to see him, since that might make things worse, Tammy states that she doesn't care because Cassie deserves it.  She then gets a devilish look in her eyes and suggests that they skip school tomorrow and \"disappear\" so that Cassie will worry.   Olivia is shocked to see Phillip sitting on her bed.  She immediately thinks that he escaped from Ravenwood, but he assures her that he was released.  He tells her that Rick gave him checked him out and gave him a clean bill of health after he spoke with Olivia.  He tells her that he'd been undergoing ECT treatments and will still be getting therapy on an outpatient basis.  While talking to her, Phillip holds Olivia tightly around the shows, making her uncomfortable.  He asks her if she's scared of him, and she wonders if she should be?  Phillip tells Olivia that he'd never hurt her intentionally.  He says he'd never hurt her like she hurt him.  He tells her that he did have a lot of anger towards her because of her lie about Emma and he did want to see her suffer.  Phillip then puts his hands around Olivia's neck and tells her that he's gotten past it; he's forgiven her.  Unsettled, Olivia rushes out and heads for the Beacon.  She asks Cassie again about buying her half of the Beacon.  She tells Cassie that Phillip is home, although she's not thrilled about it; she thinks his release may have been premature.  Olivia then tells Cassie why she needs the money--she wants to get a foothold at Spaulding.  Olivia and Cassie talk about her marriage to Phillip, who she knows is trying to frighten her,  and Olivia assures Cassie that she's in it for the long haul because of Emma.  When Cassie calls it a loveless marriage, Olivia mentions that she'd like Phillip to be in love with her but knows that won't happen.  Cassie realizes that Olivia does love him.  Olivia tells her that she's been in love before and has always gotten burned.  Now she's in it for pragmatic reasons.  Across town, Phillip is promising Lizzie that he's going to be a better father than he was before and tells her that they'll be a family when.  When Lizzie asks him if he loves Olivia, he tells her that it's not that simple.\n\n\nBill is trying to enter the house while Salerno is inside with Eden.  Salerno manhandles Eden and tells her that she belongs to him professionally.  He says that she owes him and he intends to collect.  He then sneaks out right before Bill enters.  Again Eden tries to convince Bill to elope.  She thinks they should get married immediately before something happens.  But Bill wants them to marry surrounded by family and friends.  He tries to assure her that nothing can stop them from getting married.  But Eden still looks worried.\n\n\nDanny and Michelle find themselves both at Towers.  Although they think that Salerno set them up, the true culprits were Rick and Mel.  Giving the couple some alone time, Rick, Mel, and Ed go to another table and discuss a letter Ed received regarding working at the clinic in Africa again.  Ed's obviously conflicted about it since he knows he's needed in both places.  Although Mel assures Ed that his family just wants him to be happy, Rick makes it clear that he'd really like Ed to stay and be a part of their lives. At their table, Danny and Michelle talk about their situation.   Danny informs Michelle that Salerno is coming to Springfield, which means Danny's going to have to work hard to convince him he's back in the life.  Michelle offers to help him by showing Salerno she's changed and is now the \"perfect mob wife.\"  They agree that the only way to protect the people they care about is to drive them away.  That means convincing Ed to go to Africa, sending Nico away, and convincing Rick and Mel that Danny's back in the mob and Michelle's okay with it.  Later the couple goes home and Danny apologizes for getting them in this mess and leaving Michelle alone.  However, she supports him by saying that they're not alone, they're together.  Just then Salerno appears in the house!\n\n\n",
