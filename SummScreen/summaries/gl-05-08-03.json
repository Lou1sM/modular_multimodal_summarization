Alex calls Harley and hears voices. She sends Lloyd over to check the mansion for Alan. Lloyd finds Harley holding a bag of goodies. He pulls a gun on Harley. Gus enters and runs Lloyd out. The cops are waiting for him. Edmund gives a great speech and in the excitement, kisses Cassie. Realizing what he did he offers an apology. The bearded man walks down the stairs, but no one notices. The mayor congratulates Cassie on the party and says he wants to introduce her to the new DA. They will meet in the bar later. He asks her to join them. Edmund goes to the bar to find the mayor. He is not there but is directed to another man who is waiting for the mayor. He approaches the man and taps him on the shoulder. The bearded man turns around and much to Edmund's surprise, the man looks like Richard. Stay tuned."
