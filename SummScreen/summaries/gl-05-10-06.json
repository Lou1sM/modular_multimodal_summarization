Suddenly, many get sick, including Cassie, Harley, Buzz, and Lizzie. They go to Cedars Hospital with food poisoning. Jonathan tells Reva, who is trying to retrieve her medical records, it was from the potato salad, but brags that he never was ill after eating two helpings. Buzz lies in an examination room, half asleep. Suddenly, there are voices in the room. They all run together as echoes saying, \"Oh, Buzz, if only I could have spared you ..Jenna, you can't let him see you . Oh, relax, Nadine ..I just want to look at him Well, I do, too ..You are breaking the rules Will you two just stop your bickering You tell her, Sarah\". Buzz lies in silence, unable to hear the bantering voices echoing back and forth. Suddenly, as he lies quietly, Jenna appears whispering in his ear, \"Poor Buzz. Buzz, I've missed you .Our son is in trouble, you know that . Don't worry because I am here to help\". She starts to kiss him and is suddenly called back by Nadine's voice. Buzz suddenly sits bolt upright. Jenna finds Coop outside Cedars crying and starts to talk to him. He is so glad to see his mom and hugs her tightly. They talk about the baby and he tells her a baby needs two parents. They walk around Main Street, looking at diamond rings. Later, Coop looks at the diamond ring in his pocket and starts to ask Lizzie something, but changes his mind. Harley sits in an exam room of Cedars Hospital looking at her cell phone. \"You're not supposed to have that in here\", Nadine says disapprovingly. A shocked Harley turns to the voice, \"Mommy\"? Nadine jumps up and runs to her side, grinning widely. Nadine and she talk about her role at Spaulding and Nadine makes her realize that she was not nice to Dinah. She decides to help Dinah. Meanwhile, inside Cedars Hospital, Reva stands up against a wall and hears Sarah say in a stern voice, \"Ah, Reva girl. Pulling away is not the answer. You know better than that\". \"Mama, you're here\", Reva says happily. \"I'm here to give ya a swift kick in the britches\", Sarah retorts. Sarah tries to convince Reva that she needs to fight for her life. Cassie prepares for discharge from Cedars and hears, \"I'm sorry I missed out on your life, Cassie, and you mine. G-d knows I regretted it until the day I died\". Cassie turns and with a shocked smile says, \"Sarah\"? \"Better late than never\", Sarah laughs. Sarah tells her that she needs to learn to let go of Jeffrey and Tammy. Cassie asks her who her father is and Sarah tells her that she will know when the time is right. Cassie and Reva meet up again and both agree that Sarah can make their fears and doubts go away for a while. At Company, Jenna and Nadine critique Olivia. Nadine thinks she is right for Buzz and Jenna disagrees. When Frank comes in, Nadine tells the two of them, who are oblivious to her presence, that they will work everything out. She gently touches Franks face and he turns around, seeing nothing. Buzz cannot understand what went wrong with the potato salad. Emma sees \"shiny ladies\". Back at the site of the Mother's Day picnic, Jenna, Sarah and Nadine meet. \"Our work is done her girls\", Nadine grins to Jenna, holding her hand. \"That is until the next time, of course\", adds Jenna. \"That's right, girls; a mama's work never really ends\", says Sarah. Nadine says, \"Wait! Who's got the stuff we put in the potato salad\"? Sarah holds up a bottle and shrieks, \"Castor Oil. My kids always did hate this stuff\". The three giggle as they fade away As the closing theme music is playing, Harley thinks about Nadine and says,\" Mommies are always there. Frank senses Nadine blowing a kiss. Coop tells Jenna happy Mother's Day. Cassie stares in awe at Sarah. Reva hugs Sarah and weeps, \"I love you mom\"."
