It's arriving on a boat called  The Gilded Lily.  Both think that this could be the Antimonius shipment.  Although, Danny thinks this information makes him square with O'Neill, Jeffrey tells him they won't be square until  they trace where Antimonius is being converted to Delirium.  Meanwhile, Harley is at the customs office for her meeting with Marie Green.  She learns that Marie is expecting a shipment of antiques to arrive tonight.  After giving Marie her report---that she could find no evidence of Brad having an affair in San Cristobel--Harley learns that the antique shipment will be aboard The Gilded Lily.  Later, Harley rushes off to meet Jeffrey.  Both are convinced that the antiques are just a cover to smuggle Antimonius.  Jeffrey orders Harley to stake out the boat and starts to give her back-up.  However, Harley is concerned that the agents will be spotted and tells him she's going alone.  Although he agrees with her request, once she leaves, Jeffrey arranges for backup.   Jeffrey later talks to Danny and tells him to keep his eye on Salerno today, but orders him to keep away from the docks tonight.\n\n\nAlso at the Beacon, Cassie spots Tammy leaving on the way to school and tries to make small talk; asking about Tammy's plans for the day.  Tammy though gets defensive and storms out.  She then meets up with Joey and they make plans to \"run away together.\"  When Joey gets concerned about her choice of words, she reassures him that they aren't really running away, they're just playing hooky and having fun.  Joey is concerned about her getting into trouble with her \"parents.\"  When he uses the phrase repeatedly, Tammy gets defensive and states that Edmund is her uncle and not a father figure. The pair is spotted outside the Beacon by Edmund.  When Edmund questions why Tammy has a backpack, she makes up an excuse about having a science project in there.  When he implores her to go easy on her mother, Tammy lashes out by reminding him that he's not her father.  She's still convinced that both he and Cassie betrayed her.  After Edmund leaves, Sandy sees the pair and nonchalantly asks if they're playing hooky tonight.  Tammy says not and her and Joey leave.  Later, Edmund is trying to convince Sandy to head up the 1st annual San Cristobel festival.  He tells Sandy that he was impressed with his work on the Romeo & Juliet play and thinks it would only be fitting for the son of the former crown prince to head up the event.  Sandy though declines the offer by saying that San Cristobel is the last place he wants to think about since he was robbed of his life there.  After this meeting, Edmund sees Cassie fielding a phone call and learns that Tammy and Joey never made it to school.  When Edmund tells her about the backpack and Tammy's science project, Cassie figures out the pair skipped school since she knows there was no science project.  Cassie is convinced they've run away.   After trying to reassure a very worried Cassie, Edmund suddenly thinks of someone who might know where the kids are.\n\nThe kids are at the Bauer cabin since Tammy got permission from Michelle to use it (although didn't tell Michelle she'd be alone with Joey).  The pair decide to have a nice picnic lunch and Tammy asks Joey to build a fire, for a romantic environment.\n\n\nWhile Danny is at Towers for his meeting with Salerno, they're spotted by Bill and Eden.  Bill notices that Salerno is staring at Eden, and sensing that she's uncomfortable, he goes to confront the man.  Bill tells Salerno in no uncertain terms that he's marrying Eden and he wants Vinnie to stop sending her gifts and drooling over her.  When Vinnie starts to get angry, Danny rushes Bill out and advises him against confronting a man like Salerno.  Bill backs down by telling Danny to tell Vinnie to back off of Eden. Bill then asks Eden for their wedding invitation to Michelle.  He wants to deliver it in person and tell Michelle about Danny and Salerno.  Meanwhile, Danny asks Vinnie not to make any move against Bill Lewis.  He assures Vinnie, that he already has a plan in mind to make Bill suffer his entire life.\n\n\nAt the Spaulding mansion, Olivia and Phillip discuss his hovering around her last night.  He excuses it by stating that he had a bad dream about her and was just checking to see if she was all right.  Olivia is then surprised to learn that Phillip is planning on going to work.  She tries to persuade him to stay home, telling him it's too soon to for him to go back.  However, he assures her that he's fine. He thanks her for covering for him but assures her that he's fine now and ready to take over.  She's not convinced and tells him that she can help the company.  But Phillip thinks the best way she can help is by staying home and playing the dutiful wife.  At Spaulding Enterprises, Alex is surprised to see Phillip in charge already and urges him to take it easy; he's not in race.  But he states that he is, and it's a race he intends to win.  Meanwhile, Olivia, resentful of Phillip's dismissal, calls a reporter and offers to give them the scoop on Spaulding.\n\n\n",
