Josh hatches a plan with Billy to move the cabin to Springfield. Reva visits Colin McCabe, her oncologist and tells him that she wants him back as her doctor. He tells her she needs to tell her husband about the cancer and she refuses, telling him that she will go through it all by herself. She tells him that she and Josh will grow old together with or without his help. He tells her to make an appointment for radiation treatments which she does. Beth and Alan are at Cedars Hospital for her pregnancy check up. She tells him that she has documents to sign that will make him say away from Lizzie and Coop and allow them to lead their own lives. He threatens to tell the police that Beth held him captive for months in the cabin and that he needs a lawyer. She tells him not to bother because she knows he has skeletons in his closet about the events leading up to Ross's plane crash. Rick eavesdrops on this conversation. She finally gets Alan to sign the papers and he suddenly kisses her and tells her to leave with him tonight to renew their vows on a private tropical island. Harley and Gus visit Mallet at his apartment and Harley tells him that she wants to find Dinah. Jeffrey is there as well. Mallet tells both everyone that Dinah is just grieving and is actually at a spa with Blake. Suddenly, Blake arrives and tells all that Blake is missing.

Harley, Gus and Mallet go to Alan-Michael's apartment and find out that Dinah has taken a flight to St. Gabriel's in the Caribbean. As they leave to find Dinah, Mallet discovers that his gun is missing. As the closing dramatic music is playing, a voice says, \"Can you bring the tray out\"? Someone is entering the room of a lush tropical resort. \"Try not to drop it\", the voice continues. Dinah walks towards a man who is reading a magazine, his face hidden. \"Go ahead\", the voice pleads. Dinah says very calmly, \"Surprise partner\", and whacks the man in the face with her briefcase."
