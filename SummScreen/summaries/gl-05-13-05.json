    "soap_central": "\n\nJosh finds Reva at an out of town bar and playfully accuses her of \"hiding out.\" She denies it and offers to buy him a drink. Nate comes to the bar, and seeing Reva's money on the bar, admonishes her for forgetting the employee discount. Reva quickly introduces Josh to Nate but doesn't reveal he's her boss. She makes it seem like Nate just owes her a drink. Alone, Josh asks Reva what's going on with her. She hasn't really seemed grounded. Reva tries to explain her emotions are everywhere nowadays. She tells him everyone around her is trying to help and she seems to resent it a little. It's just easier to be around people who don't know her. Josh leaves to go to his meeting. With him gone, Reva's break is over. When Reva thanks Nate for not breaking her cover, he asks why she didn't tell Josh she works there. She wants something that is just hers alone. When Nate asks why exactly she is there, she tells him she's working and also having a little bit of good old fashioned fun. Suddenly, she spots Tammy in the bar. When she walks off to speak to her, Tammy is suddenly gone, leaving Reva confused. \n\n\nFrank is at Company agonizing over a bundle of letters. He tells Coop that Mallet had mailed these letters to Harley but he intercepted them in order to protect her. He regrets the decision because perhaps Harley wouldn't be in this mess if she'd known about the letters. Coop suggests to Frank maybe he could talk to Lizzie about stopping her transfer to Hell House. Frank's not happy with Coop asking a Spaulding for help, but approves of it anyway. A little later, Gus arrives to get some coffee and picks up one of Mallet's letters and reads it. Gus asks Frank when they were written but he won't answer. Gus tells Frank he has a lead on Olivia - Alan said she was in San Cristobel. A frustrated Frank tells Gus that Harley is being transferred to Hellus Correctional Facility, nicknamed Hell House. Frank tells Gus that Mallet is hiding Harley until he can find a way to stop the transfer. \n\n\nAt the Spaulding mansion, after Alan gives Gus the lead on Olivia, he makes a call to Lena to ensure her cooperation in getting Harley transferred. Lizzie walks in on the tail end of the conversation. Alan tells Lizzie about sending Gus to San Cristobel. An upset Lizzie accuses him of sending his own son on a wild goose chase. She tries to catch up with Gus to tell him, but Alan stops her. He tries to defend his actions by stating he's helping Gus get over his obsession with Harley. Lizzie is not happy about Alan's venomous attitude toward Harley and says she hates being a grown up in this family. She tells her grandfather she used to be proud when she was compared to him; now she's afraid. Lizzie tells Alan she doesn't want people to hate her; she wants them to care about her. Alan accuses Coop of putting ideas in her head and tells her the Coopers will ruin her just like Harley ruined Phillip and Gus. Lizzie tries to convince Alan the vendetta against the Coopers and everyone else has to end, but he is determined to make those responsible for Phillip's death pay. Alan tells her sending Harley away is for the best and asks her to trust him. Suddenly, Coop enters asking to speak to Lizzie. Before she can go out to the hall, Alan privately tells her to keep Harley's immediate transfer a secret. Out in the hall, Coop asks Lizzie's help in using her Spaulding connections to stop Harley's transfer. He says he knows what kind of person she is. He knows she wants to help them. Lizzie tells him she WANTS to help him. \n\n\nIn Mallet's office, he and Harley are discussing the letters he wrote but she never received. Mallet's a little angry that Frank made Harley's decision for her but she defends her brother. Harley asks Mallet when he stopped writing to her. He says not for a long time. He mentions her old dog, Piper, and tells Harley the dog died two years after she left. At that point, his last link to her was gone and he stopped writing. Harley starts talking about how angry she used to be at him for not even apologizing to her; now that she knows he did, she's not angry any more. Harley regrets never having read any of the letters and Mallet gives her the last letter he ever wrote to her, one he didn't mail. Touched he's kept the letter with him all this time, Harley reads it and is moved to tears. Mallet asks her if it would have made any difference had she gotten the letters in the first place, but Harley really has no idea. She asks him if she had come back, what would he have done? Mallet tells her he would have spent the rest of his life proving to her that she hadn't made a mistake. Harley's not so sure, because she thinks she would have spent all the time wondering if he was cheating again. Mallet tells her he would have made her trust him, but Harley thinks it was too late. Suddenly, Mallet gets a call to meet the Corrections Officer to discuss Harley's transfer and leaves for Company for the meeting. But when he gets there, the place is empty. Realizing something is very wrong, Mallet rushes out. He is blasted by Gus, who just happened to see Mallet on the street, for leaving Harley alone. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Lena checks up on Harley and reports to Alan that she's alone. A guard comes to Mallet's office to retrieve Harley. Being told it's on the warden's orders, Harley leaves with him and is suddenly taken outside where a transfer truck awaits! \n\n\n\n\n",
