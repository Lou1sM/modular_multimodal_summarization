Gus also stressed that he doesn't want any help from Alan. Frank was summoned to the mayor's office, where the mayor pressured Frank to reinstate Gus to the force. Although the mayor said he was voicing sentiments on behalf of a concerned citizen, Frank saw through the smokescreen and realized it was Alan Spaulding who was putting on the pressure. Frank was caught off guard when the mayor introduced him to Jeffrey O'Neal, the new D.A., who the mayor explained just recently transferred from the Manhattan D.A.'s office. Still puzzled by Jeffrey's resemblance to Richard Winslow, Frank begrudgingly agreed to reinstate Gus back to the force. After Frank left, the mayor asked Jeffrey to join him and a few others out on the golf course, but Jeffrey turned him down, saying there are a stack of cases to take care of, then he asked the mayor some questions about Edmund Winslow, saying he smells a rat where Edmund's concerned. Frank later arrived at Harley and Gus' place, where he stoically informed Gus that he's been reinstated to the force. When Gus questioned how this all occurred so fast, Frank simply said that \"higher-ups\" decided it. As Gus and Harley were ecstatic at the news, Frank informed Gus that there's one condition on his return to the police force: that Gus and Harley can no longer be partners. They were astounded and angry at Frank, who told them that he can't have two of his police officers letting their hearts steer them instead of their heads. Harley stunned both Frank and Gus by announcing she's quitting! Later, after they were alone, Gus asked Harley if she made the decision in spite of Frank, but Harley told him that after her recent brush with death and seeing Nadine again, she realized what's important in life and wants to spend more quality time with her kids and Gus. Gus again asked her if she's making the right decision, and she told him her decision \"feels right\". At \"Company\", Marina told Tammy that she's planning to make love with Ben for the very first time on her upcoming 18th birthday. Shayne arrived, pumped-up in anticipation over the baseball game later in the day where the pro-baseball scout will be in attendance. As Tammy and Shayne sat and talked, Buzz tried to get Marina to think of Shayne in romantic terms, but she saw through his ploy. Marina was irritated to see Frank arrive. Frank spoke to Buzz and asked if he thought Frank was becoming too mean-spirited, and Buzz told him to open his heart and not close it off to the two most important women in his life (Marina and Harley). Just before she and Edmund were to depart for St.Cristobel, Cassie told Edmund she couldn't go, explaining that St.Cristobel held a special place in her heart along with all her memories of Richard and that it would be too painful to return there. Edmund accepted this, but told Cassie that he has to return there for his own sake, in order to put some demons to rest so that he could move forward with his life. After hearing Edmund's words, Cassie suddenly agreed to go after all. Cassie called Tammy to let her know that she's going to St.Cristobel---with Edmund---and Tammy was less than enthused, warning Cassie that although Edmund's made great strides lately, he's STILL Edmund and that she should be careful. Meanwhile, Jeffrey walked into the Beacon and ran into Edmund, who kept looking over Jeffrey's shoulder for any sign of Cassie. Edmund mentioned he wanted to schedule a meeting with Jeffrey to discuss extradition laws between St.Cristobel and the U.S., and Jeffrey let it be known that he's aware that extradition was a fate that Edmund faced not too long ago. Suddenly aware that Jeffrey's done his research, Edmund told him not to believe everything he's heard about him, whereas Jeffrey told Edmund TO believe everything he's heard about HIM. Later, Edmund and Cassie departed for St.Cristobel. When Cassie let herself into her room and looked about the place, she opened a door and was shocked to discover that she and Edmund have adjoining suites!"
