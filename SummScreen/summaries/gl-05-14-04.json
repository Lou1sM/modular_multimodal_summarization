The only information the broker could offer was that the buyer resided in Springfield. Olivia was irritated further when Alexandra showed up with baby Emma in tow. She didn't buy Alex's excuse that Emma was missing her mother. Alex lamented how Emma spends all day with a nanny while Olivia's at the company looking after her own selfish interests. Olivia told Alex not to try laying a guilt trip on her, adding that the reason she's working so hard is to secure Emma's future. Olivia left with Emma, but not before telling Alex never to touch Emma without her explicit permission. \n\n\nHarley phoned Eden and canceled out on their plans to buy decorations for Eden's bridal shower, saying she suddenly had work to do. After the call, Bill arrived and wanted to order dinner for he and Eden, but she lied, saying she and Harley had plans to buy decorations....Harley phoned Jeffrey, who told her to get down to the docks, but he stressed that he only wanted Harley to stick around long enough to confirm the arrival of \"The Gilded Lily\", but that's it. After the call, Jeffrey instructed an agent to place listening devices in Salerno's club on 5th Street. \n\n\nAt Danny and Michelle's, Michelle expressed reservations about Danny taking a gun with him to the docks, but Danny told her it was a precaution in case O'Neill's men screwed up somehow. After Danny went upstairs to say goodnight to Robbie, Mel, Rick and Ed arrived. When Michelle noticed that Rick was angry, Ed announced that he was definitely leaving for Africa and that a diplomatic charter was available and he'd be on his way in a couple of hours. Rick was bitter over the fact that there was precious little time for them to get prepared for Ed's departure. Michelle told Ed he was doing the right thing by going to the African village to save lives. Rick tuned out of the conversation while Ed described the situation facing him when he arrives at the field hospital. Ed approached Rick, telling him he's leaving in order to make a huge difference in people's lives, but Rick said he'd make a big difference by staying in Springfield. Mel tried to get Rick to realize that his father was following his own path. When Rick asked Ed if he'd informed Ross or Holly of his decision, Ed said he'd call Ross from the airport, adding that Holly already knew. Rick pulled Michelle aside and asked how she could have talked their father into leaving the country, but Michelle insisted it was something that Ed wanted to do. Rick tried to plead with Michelle to talk Ed out of leaving. \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Phillip told Gus that he wants to help Spaulding Enterprises by blaming the company's current state on his mental breakdown so that the public's confidence can be restored. Gus then told Phillip that the federal probe into Spaulding isn't something as simple as corporate mismanagement....Elsewhere at The Beacon, Olivia ran into Bill. After they touched on the subject of the falling price of Spaulding stock, Bill admitted he didn't really bother with the stock market much. Alluding to the fact that Bill's now in a larger income bracket, Olivia hinted at Bill using his money so it would have greater earning potential. Olivia suggested they meet soon to discuss an investment opportunity, adding that there's a lot that each of them could bring to the table, but Bill was non-committal, saying he had his hands full planning his wedding. \n\n\nFrom a hiding spot, Harley watched as dockworkers unloaded wooden crates from \"The Gilded Lily.\" She phoned Jeffrey to report about the progress, and while doing so, she spotted Danny standing in the sidelines and reported it to Jeffrey, who pretended to be surprised, but Harley didn't buy it and told Jeffrey to tell her everything he knew about Danny's involvement. Jeffrey said she was strictly on a need-to-know basis, then ordered her to leave the docks....Tony discovered Danny lurking at the docks and revealed that he'd purposely left the pad of paper in plain sight at the club, knowing fully well that Danny would try to read what Tony had written on it. He told Danny that it was a test to determine the level of Danny's trust, and that Danny had failed the test. After telling Danny it's obvious he can't follow orders and do what Salerno says, he told Danny to go home. Danny pretended to, but turned back and began opening crates addressed to Marie Green when Jeffrey arrived. After discovering the crates contained antiques---and not drugs---Danny was furious that his charade with Salerno would have to continue. Jeffrey assured Danny that they'd eventually nail Salerno, but stressed that Danny would have to do things Jeffrey's way. \n\n\nEden arrived back at her place carrying two cardboard boxes. After setting them down, she let out a deep breath and muttered, \"Okay...I did it...\" Back at The Beacon, Alan arrived and Gus told him that Phillip was there as well, adding that he and Phillip had discussed Spaulding matters. When Alan asked if Gus had mentioned anything to Phillip regarding the drug investigation, Gus said he hadn't. After Alan walked off, Gus called Harley's cell phone and reached her just as she approached Eden's front door. Gus asked how the situation at the docks went and Harley said she didn't have much to report. When Harley revealed where she was and that she heard water running inside Eden's place and that Eden probably wouldn't hear her knocking, Gus told her about a spare key which Eden always kept under the doormat. Thanking Gus, Harley let herself in. While still talking with Gus, Harley sauntered over to one of the cardboard boxes and casually rifled through its contents. Before too long, Harley came across a stunning discovery: a plastic bag filled with a white powder! \n\n\nAt The Beacon, Phillip told Alan that Gus made it sound as though the federal investigation into the company was worse than originally thought, but Alan changed the subject. Noticing Olivia and Emma in the lobby, Phillip told Alan the idea of letting Olivia continue to run Spaulding is a good one, and until the investigators find what they're looking for, that it's for the best. \n\n\nAt Michelle and Danny's, Ed said it was time to leave and that he still had packing to do. Michelle began to cry when her father hugged her, and Ed assured them he'd keep in touch with emails and phone calls. He asked Mel to \"look out\" for his two kids, then wished them all a fond farewell, refusing to say the word \"goodbye.\" Outside the house, Ed said a few more parting words to his son but tried to keep it light. Ed insisted Rick walk ahead of him, and after a few moments, Ed departed after him....Inside, Danny returned through a side entrance and Michelle was grateful he was okay. It was obvious to Danny that Ed's departure was tearing Michelle apart and he held her while she cried. \n\n\nAt Eden's, Harley suddenly told Gus she had to go and hung up on him. She walked over to the other cardboard box and delved into it, finding yet another plastic bag with white powder. Tasting a few grains, Harley uttered, \"Antimonious!\" Seconds later, Eden entered the room while drying her hair with a towel. The two women stared at one another...  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Olivia was still trying to get her grubby paws on Spalding stock when Alex wandered in with Emma. Danny left Michelle to meet the ship at the dock. After he left, Ed, Rick and Mel arrived so Ed could bid tearful goodbyes and ride off into the African sunset. Gus told Phillip that the woes at Spalding aren't just corporate and that he shouldn't set himself as the fall guy for the company. Phillip grilled Alan about what the problems at Spalding really are. Harley skulked around Pier 14 looking for clues. Jeffery ordered her out of the area after she spied Danny lurking around for his own clues. Olivia suspects Bill may be the one buying up Spalding stock, though he denies interest. Tony found Danny hiding behind boxes, caught red-handed lurking around. Tony admitted he set Danny up and can't trust him now. Danny made Tony believe he left but instead he stayed. Jeffery showed up and they came up empty-handed after going through one of the boxes. Harley found antimonious inside a box of Eden's wedding decorations.",
