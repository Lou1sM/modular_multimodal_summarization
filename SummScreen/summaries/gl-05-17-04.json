Eden tells Harley she was only doing one last job for Vinnie and now he'll leave her alone. Harley points out how naive it sounds, reminding Eden how Salerno promised the same thing before. She is livid at Eden for lying to her and says she could have helped her. When Eden asks if Harley is going to say anything to Bill about it, Harley says she won't, but she IS telling the D.A.! \n\n\nGus goes to \"Olivia's\" to check on how the preparations are going for Bill's surprise bachelor party. He runs into Beth, who's just had a business meeting. He suggests maybe someday she could give him pointers on how to adjust to the Spaulding family easier. Gus is all happy over Eden's upcoming marriage to Bill, and Beth says a few kind words about her, which Gus admits is kind of rare. \n\n\nAt the Lewis home, just as Josh is telling Reva and Sandy about a surprise bachelor party Billy is planning to throw for Bill, Bill arrives. He says how happy he is to be marrying Eden and after admitting she doesn't have many friends in Springfield, he asks them to become her friends. Reva says as long as Eden makes Bill happy, she makes the rest of them happy as well. Bill says he worried people would think he was making a mistake with Eden, the same way he made a mistake trusting Danny Santos. Reva and Josh present Bill with a wedding talisman, which had belonged to Bill's great-great-grandfather, William. Bill is touched. He ignores his cell phone when it rings, saying it's his father, who's been pestering him to consent to having a bachelor party. He thinks bachelor parties are for men too scared to give up the single life and they don't pertain to him. Even after much persuasion from Sandy and Josh, Bill stands firm, maintaining he doesn't want a bachelor party. He asks Josh to talk to Billy for him and get him to stop making a fuss about it. \n\n\nAt their house, Danny tells Michelle he really hoped to find something incriminating at the docks which would point to Salerno, but there wasn't anything to find. After Michelle goes upstairs to tend to Robbie, Tony arrives. He reminds Danny that Salerno had told him to stay put. Tony had tested Danny and he'd failed the test. He went further, informing Danny he has no choice but to tell Salerno about his deceit. Danny tries to talk him out of it by saying he's on a power trip. But Tony is steadfast, and warns he doesn't know what Salerno will do once he is informed. Michelle enters the room after hearing this, and orders Tony not to do anything that would hurt Danny or her family. She adds Tony does NOT want to have her as his enemy! After pointing out how often Danny saved Tony's hide, he should be loyal to the family who's loved and supported him for years. Michelle tells Tony to give it serious thought, and then orders him to get out! \n\n\nWhen Jeffrey arrives at Eden's and starts packing away the drugs (in order to take them out to his car, where he was preparing to test them for purity), Eden insists she didn't have a choice. But Jeffrey says she DID. He threatens to put her in jail and begins to leave with the drugs when Harley stops him and pleads Eden's case, saying she was coerced and their main goal is to nab Salerno. Jeffrey agrees and says he has no intention of prosecuting Eden. After he leaves, Harley assures Eden she won't be going to jail, and she hugs and thanks her. Later, Jeffrey comes back inside with the drugs. He tells them he'd just tested them and the drugs are indeed Antimonius, and they are pure. Shocked to learn the drugs are worth 5 million dollars, Eden assumes Salerno can then be arrested, but Jeffrey says it doesn't work that way. He orders her to continue with the plan and deliver the drugs to Salerno. Eden is shocked, and even more so once Jeffrey threatens to have her put in jail if she doesn't go along. He explains he needs a drug trail leading to Salerno and tells Eden not to tell anyone about what's occurring---not even Bill. \n\n\nBack at the Lewis home, Reva, Josh and Sandy are overcome by the sound of loud music emanating from Tammy's room upstairs. Josh and Reva announce there is something they want to give to Sandy. After Josh compliments the job he did at Lewis Construction previously, he says he'd like Sandy to work there again. Sandy is grateful, but says he wants to keep his options open, and thanks Josh again. Josh and Sandy go to track down Billy. \n\n\nAt the Santos home, Danny thanks Michelle for being on his side and tells her that he never takes her for granted. Michelle tells him how much he means to her. She asks Danny if he thinks Tony will still report him to Salerno, but he admits only time will tell. Meanwhile, Tony is downing a few drinks in the office at Salerno's new club when Vinnie calls. When Vinnie asks if Tony has seen Danny, he hesitates, and then says he hasn't seen him at all. \n\n\nJeffrey and Harley set up surveillance equipment inside a van, gearing up for the drug drop. Harley admits she feels sorry for Eden, but Jeffrey remarks she made her bed and now she can now lie in it. Inside Eden's place, a gym bag containing the drugs is all ready and Eden is silently contemplating the task facing her when Bill arrives. He gives her a long kiss, and then shows her the wedding talisman. When he assumes the gym bag's handy because she is on her way out to a gym, she doesn't correct him. Before he hugs her, Bill tells Eden nothing's going to stop them from being happy for the rest of their lives....  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Josh, Reva and gave Bill a wedding talisman that had been handed down from his great great grandfather in the Lakota tribe. Danny and Tony had it out about Danny's trip to the dock. Michelle, managing to appear menacing jumped into the fray and threatened Tony. Later, Tony received a call from Salerno and lied about having seen Danny at the docks. Harley confronted Eden about the antimonies in the decorations. Eden told her it was her last job and then Salerno was going to let her go. Harley called in Jeffery who tested it for purity and then told Eden she'd have to follow through with the drop so they could nail Salerno.",
