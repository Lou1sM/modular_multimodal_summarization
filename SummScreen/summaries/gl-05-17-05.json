He overhears it and is very angry, but he has come with a delivery of things to show Lizzie.  It is a box of photos Harley, and Beth leaves to let them talk.  Coop yells at Lizzie as she tries to explain why she didn't tell him.  Apparently, her grandfather had threatened bodily harm to Coop if Lizzie told anyone that he was the reason Harley was transferred.  She tried to tell him that he didn't understand her grandfather, that bad things happened when he was angry and that she didn't want to lose any one else.  Coop admitted he didn't want to lose her, either, and delighted, the two kiss for the first time!  Beth returns to the room, and is not happy to see them kiss.  Lizzie, in full blush, leaves to go to work at Company.  Beth tells Coop to sit down, that she needs to talk to him.  Beth doesn't want him to get involved with her daughter because she thinks Lizzie will hurt him as she has no \"impulse control.\"  Coop tells Beth that he thinks she is wrong.....Beth says \"I hope you're right.\"\n\n\nEdmund tries to convince Dinah that she needs to join him and Cassie as they flee Springfield.  She really doesn't want to leave, but Edmund flirts with her and tells her how wonderful a person she is and she changes her mind.  She jumps into his lap and he gives her a very warm hug.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey is trying to convince Cassie not to leave with Alonso's son, that what she is doing is not only crazy but it is illegal.  He then gets personal and tells her he has feelings for her.  She cannot deny that she has feelings for him, and they kiss passionately.  Edmund and Dinah walk in just in time to see this.  Later, Cassie tries to convince Edmund it was a \"good-bye\" kiss, but admits that she has feelings for Jeffrey.  In an obvious attempt to get back at her, Edmund walks out of the room and kisses Dinah passionately on the mouth.  Cassie watched in disgust.  Jeffrey, however, did not believe Cassie's kiss meant good-bye.  He calls his office to tell them that he will be out of town for a few days on personal business in Saint Cristobel, and that he wanted no one to know where he was.\n\n\nBill calls Olivia in a desperate attempt to reach her.  Olivia, in seclusion with her daughter, sees his number on the phone but does not answer it.  Gus sees Bill on the phone and thinks Bill knows where to find Olivia.  Gus threatens Bill, but Bill really doesn't know where she is and tells Gus he wouldn't turn her in, anyway, because she would be accused of Phillip's murder.  Gus leaves in anger.  Bill tries to call Olivia again and she answers!   He begs with her to come home or to at least tell him where she is.  She actually does tell him - she and Emma are on a private Spaulding island in the cottage he renovated.  As soon as he hangs up, he asks Danny to fly him to the island.  Danny is reluctant to get involved, but agrees.  Marina overhears this and runs to Gus, who is having a drink in Company.  As Danny's plane is about to take off, there is a knock on the cockpit door....Danny answered it and sees Marina, who insists on going.  After they take off, Bill and Danny realize that not only Marina has joined them - Gus is in the plane, too!  Bill and Gus go to the cottage as soon as they land on the island.....Bill asks to go first, to speak to his wife alone, and Gus agrees.  Bill knocks on the cottage door..... \n\n\n",
