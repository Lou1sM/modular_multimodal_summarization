Gus receives a phone call from a housekeeper across the island who heard a plane take off in haste; someone was leaving the island in a hurry. A police officer tries to arrest Dinah and Mallet smoothes over everything and gets the charges against Dinah dropped. Later, Gus pours a whiskey for Dinah to settle her nerves. Mallet and Dinah are talking in their bedroom and Gus, out of their sight, walks in. Dinah tells Mallet that she can see when someone is grieving how they reach out to others for comfort. \"I get it how two people like you and Harley could sleep together when Harley thought Gus was gone\", she tells Mallet. Gus starts to take a drink of the whiskey and horrified by what he hears, crushes the glass in his hands. Gus tells Harley he needs to ask her something but Mallet returns to help Harley dress the wound. Gus has hate in his eyes. A reverend arrives announcing that he is there to marry the Spauldings. Since Beth and Alan have left, Harley tells him that she and Gus will renew their vows. Gus is less than eager. They stand before the reverend and Harley tells Gus that he is her hero and she loves him. Meanwhile, Mallet finally admits to Dinah that he knew Phillip was alive. She finds a letter from Ross addressed to Mallet. In the letter Ross tells Dinah that he is proud of her and is glad she has Mallet. After the renewal vows, Gus takes Harley upstairs and makes angry love to her. Mallet and Dinah make sweet tender love. Gus, after Harley is asleep, goes downstairs and starts to drink from a bottle of alcohol. He finds Harley's purse and searches for a bottle. Once he finds this, he takes a pill from it, pauses to look upstairs, and shoves the pill in his mouth. He washes it down with long gulps of alcohol, disappointment and disbelief written on his face."
