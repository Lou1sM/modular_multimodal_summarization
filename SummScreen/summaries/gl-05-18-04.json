    "tvmega_recap": "Jeffery and Harley anxiously await Eden's arrival at Salerno's. Jeffery told Harley that the drugs Eden was supposedly carrying were fake. Salerno frisked Eden when she got there, suspicious that she was up to something. Gus dragged Bill to his bachelor party. Edmund and Joey had a heart to heart about the Bauer Cabin incident. Joey told him nothing happened. Olivia made an appearance. HB spilled the beans about Bill being a stock wiz. Olivia made use of a very drunk Bill to try to find out if he had bought Spalding stock. Salerno told Eden that he owned her and she wasn't finished working for him. After he'd dismissed her, she snatched a key ring that had been hanging on the wall near the door. Later, she returned and let herself into Salerno's empty house, retrieved her bag, dumped the drugs and then left again.",
