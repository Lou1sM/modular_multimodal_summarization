    "tvmega_recap": "Marina is bummed out at her birthday party at Company because of being arrested the previous night. Frank and Buzz worry about her and feel old that she is turning 18. She cheers up when Ben arrives but he is being followed by Ramona's husband, Mitch. Mitch turns out to be an old service buddy of Buzz's, making Ben more nervous when he founds out how tough (and jealous) he is. Marina goes lingerie shopping and finds a dead body (Ramona I think). Ed tries cooking for Tony (and Marah, Michelle & Danny) but is a disaster. Bill drops by and tries to help. He won't host the dinner party with her and is suspicious of her motives, but she explains that she's been a screwup and wants to celebrate with real friends, etc. They end up getting naked. She keeps hiding this picture of Tony and Marah, where Marah is blotted out in red, and he almost discovers it a few times. Beth and Philip demand answers from Lizzie; she claims she felt left out and was helping Marina and Tammy because she wanted to fit in. Olivia and Beth are on the same side but Beth won't admit it. Olivia is suspicious of Lizzie and suggests that Beth get her some help. Beth tells Lizzie that she wants her to go to see Felicia. Edmund runs into Alexandra at the Beacon and tells her about the D.A. who looks like Richard, as well as the girls getting arrested. She rushes over to offer help but Philip throws her out. He says that he knows she drugged Alan and she has destroyed their family. She says she did it for him; he is the only one in the family with values. But, she says, he must get rid of Olivia. Alan is going to find out that he's the father and ruin things anyway. Philip won't hear about her plans so she tells Olivia to meet her at the Beacon. Tammy freaks out when she sees Jeffrey O'Neill at The Beacon; Cassie tells her that he's not Richard. Things are awkward and he makes them worse. They argue about the car theft. Cassie wants to throw him out but he says he hasn't broken any laws and besides, he knows she won't. This seems to catch her off guard. Edmund has a nice chat with Tammy about the car and about his relationship with Cassie, then he asks Cassie out to dinner, so she says yes. Jeffrey lurks nearby."
