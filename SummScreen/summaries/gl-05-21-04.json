He asks her if Eden was there, but Olivia's reluctant to answer and leaves.  Bill then sees Josh and Reva and asks them for marital advice.  They tell him that love and respect are important, as well as forgiveness and keeping things interesting.  \n\n\nLater, Bill goes home but Eden's not there.  Taking out their wedding rings, he waits for her. Gus confronts Eden and Harley about Bill's fight with Salerno.  Eden tries to rush out to see Bill, while Harley stops her and Gus demands answers.  Eden and Harley then finally tell Gus about Salerno leaning on Eden to do one more job for him.  Gus realizes that job was for her to pick up the Antimonius.  Furious that all this was kept from him, an angry Gus demands answers or else.  Eden defends Harley while Harley maintains that Eden had to cooperate with Salerno or she'd be dead.  She tells him that they couldn't have told him about Eden and Salerno earlier because he was too close to be objective and he could have inadvertently jeopardized Eden.  Tony sees Michelle outside Salerno's and tells her to go home.  When she drops her purse, he's shocked to see a gun fall out.  Taking the gun away, Tony insists that this is no place for Michelle and she shouldn't be carrying a weapon. When she assures him that she's going straight home, he agrees to give her the gun back. She then leaves and Tony goes into the building.  Inside, Salerno is telling Danny of his plan to kill Eden and Danny volunteers to do the deed for Vinnie.  While Danny is rushing out, he spots Tony but Danny leaves too quickly for Tony to tell him Michelle was there.  Salerno then tells Tony to trail Danny to make sure he's up to the task. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Tony, Michelle returns.  Danny then goes to see O'Neill.  He tells Jeffrey that he's getting cold feet, he can't go through with what he has to do,  he doesn't want to destroy another family.  But Jeffrey insists that Danny has to follow through; it's too late to back out now.  Later, Danny sees Michelle at Salerno's and tries to convince her to go home.  Michelle is reluctant because she knows Danny is keeping something from her.  Danny tries to ease her mind by telling her that he has one thing to do, then he'll be home.  They then declare their love for one another and he leaves after she tells him that she's going to work at the hospital.  However, Michelle is still convinced that he's hiding something.  Gus tries to take charge of the situation and assures Eden that he'll protect her. Just then Jeffrey walks in and tells him that she already has some.  Jeffrey defends Harley's secrecy and tells him about Eden flushing Salerno's drugs down the toilet.  Because of that, she's going to have to testify.  Jeffrey, Harley, and Gus then leave the room, leaving Eden alone.  The phone rings--it's Danny.  He tells her that he wants to help her; he and Tony have found a way out for her.  He asks her to meet him at an old warehouse.  Eden arrives at the warehouse for her meeting with Danny.  He assures her that the plan is for her to get out of there in one piece. He whispers the plan to Eden and she thanks him for his help.  He then tells her to go into the office.  While she's in there, Danny sets up a bomb, asking God to forgive him.  At the same time, unbeknownst to Danny, Michelle enters the warehouse and is caught in the explosion!\n\n\n",
