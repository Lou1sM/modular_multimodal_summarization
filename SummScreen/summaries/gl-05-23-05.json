Reva interrupts the exchange by telling the man to get lost unless he wants to be in trouble for propositioning a minor. Tammy is embarrassed but swears she wasn't doing anything wrong and had no intention of leaving the bar with the man. Reva believes her but wants to know what she is doing there. Tammy confesses she likes to feel in control - something she doesn't have with Sandy. Reva commiserates and tells Tammy it's okay to be in a rut and do what you need to in order to find what makes you happy. Tammy is relieved to have someone to talk to besides her mother. \n\n\nAt Company, Sandy is needling Jonathan about working for Lewis Construction and asks to know what his motivation is. Jonathan responds with a dry apology for acting 'out of character.' While shaking ketchup onto his fries he promises to 'do something mean to a Lewis' as soon as he finishes his lunch. Sandy smiles and responds he knows what is happening. Jonathan is finally seeing how good it can be to have a loving family for no other price than having to open up a little. Jonathan gets angry and tosses his beer mug across the room. \n\n\nAlan, Gus and Alexandra have arrived at Cross Creek to question Olivia about leaving town. Bill, who has gotten there first, sees Gus outside and convinces him to let him talk to his wife first. While Bill and Olivia are kissing on the couch, Gus takes Emma who is outside in the play area. He arrives back at the limo with his hostage to find Alan is thrilled with the kidnapping and Alexandra is appalled. They leave for the airport hoping Olivia has no choice but to follow. Inside the cabin, Olivia has discovered Emma is gone and Bill knew Gus was on the property. She pounds on her husband in a rage and tells him he is a failure at keeping her safe. Bill apologizes and begs her to return to Springfield with him. She refuses saying if she does, it will be the end of her. \n\n\nIn the warden's office, Harley and Mallet are trapped inside as sirens wail in the yard and guards demand Harley give herself up. Harley pleads with Mallet to let her go, but he denies her and lets it slip this is the fight he's been waiting for. He reminds her of how good they were together and begs her to trust him to see her through the ordeal. Harley agrees but confesses she is in love with Gus - not him. Mallet allows her to make a phone call before he spirits her away from the prison. She calls her sons to tell them she loves them and then she calls Gus to hear his voice in case something goes wrong. She is disconnected as all the lines to the prison are cut. \n\n\nIn the Spaulding study, Gus and Alan are waiting for Olivia to show up and fight for Emma. While they are watching the news of the prison standoff, Harley phones Gus to tell him she loves him, but is cut off. Gus panics and begs Alan to do something to help Harley. While Alan heads for the phone, Gus prepares to leave the study, but is stopped by Olivia and Bill. Before Gus can get past them Olivia pulls a gun, aims at Gus and demands he give her back her daughter. Bill watches on in horror. \n\n\n",
