    "tvmega_recap": "Phillip brought Emma to the hospital. Rick reported that she just had a cold. Danny, unaware that Michelle was also in the building, pushed the button blowing up the warehouse with her and Eden inside. He took a picture of a bloody Eden which he then presented later to Salerno. Rescue workers retrieved Eden but missed Michelle, camouflaged by the rubble. Tony poked around the rubble and reported to Salerno that Danny had done what was required. Danny later tried calling her, causing her cell phone to ring under the rubble and alert Tony that there was someone trapped under it all. He found her in bad shape. Billy's car broke down at the hospital. Josh and Reva came to give him a lift. All of them end up going over to give Bill the bad news about Eden being at the warehouse. Eden was pronounced dead by the rescue workers but later showed up in Jeffery's car with Harley - very much alive.",
