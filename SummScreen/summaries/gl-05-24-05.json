Now Josh owes Blake and him a favor. Blake arrives just as Sebastian comes close to making threats. Sebastian wants to make sure his sister can handle the fallout when Alan goes down, because it will be ugly. He reminds her of her husband and three children, and that he doesn't want to see her get hurt. Blake assures him she can handle whatever Alan dishes out. \n\n\nThe fun seems to have gone out of Reva's bartending job, as Nate taunts her and asks her if her life were so perfect, then why is she bartending? Angry, Reva leaves to look for Josh. She finds him leaving Company, and greets him with a bottle of wine, two glasses and a passionate kiss. She tries to explain her behavior by apologizing to Josh for her reaction when he bought WSPR. She tells him she didn't recognize herself in all the videos he set up for her, but Josh assures her she is the same person. \n\n\nOlivia holds Gus at gunpoint as Bill looks on helplessly. Gus taunts her, saying Emma is a Spaulding and she belongs with the Spauldings. He has a tape recorder in the room and he tries to make her angry enough to confess to Phillip's murder. She comes close - she says, \"You have no idea what I'm capable of, just ask your brother!\" Emma runs into the room, happy to see her Mommy. Olivia whisks her away and says she will always keep her safe. Meanwhile Gus tries to convince Bill that Olivia confessed, but he doesn't believe it. What she said was close to confessing, but he needs to hear the actual words to be sure. Gus leaves the mansion to rescue Harley at the prison, but his car breaks down on the way. He gets out, looks at the engine, but he is clearly not going to fix it in time to help Harley. \n\n\nMallet is also trying to help Harley at the prison. But his plan may get them into more trouble than they are in already! He convinces her to escape and it works for awhile. But when he confesses he put Lena in the bus to pose as Harley, she will not allow this to happen. The more Harley thinks, the more she realizes she must turn herself in and go to Hellis. Mallet will not allow this, so she knocks him out and runs for the bus. She tries to convince Lena to leave the bus, but before she can, the driver hops in and they drive off. Lena and Harley try to keep their spirits up. Harley spots a car on the side of the road. She and Gus call to each other as the bus passes by...but there is no time for Harley to feel sorry for herself. Lena turns to Harley and tells her, \"Before we get to the prison, there is something I have to tell you about Phillip's murder.\" Just as Harley turns to listen, the bus swerves violently and rolls, again and again down a ravine. When the bus stops rolling, it looks as if Harley is still alive...  \n\n\n",
