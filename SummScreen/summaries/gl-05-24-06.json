    "tvmega_recap": "Alan Spaulding \u0096 In the Light \"Saving Grace\" Alan thinks about the lost baby. He tells Lillian at the hospital that he wants to take Beth home. At the mansion, he looks through the baby book, Roxie irritating him by nuzzling him. He takes Beth home and tells her that Dr. Sedgwick said they could try again for another baby very soon. She slaps him and leaves. A despondent Alan goes to Outskirts and starts drinking. He staggers into Company and frightens Zach; tries to talk to Lizzie and Coop asks him to leave. Buzz has to man handle him to get him to leave, telling Alan that he messed up his families' lives. Alan visits the church and talks to Father Ray, telling him that he is being punished. Ray tries to tell him that G-d doesn't punish and Alan realizes he needs to be more spiritual. Alan- Michael arrives and taunts Alan for being in church. Alan goes back to the mansion and talks to Alexandra who is looking for Phillip. She tells Alan he doesn't look well. A delivery arrives and it is a nursery box Alan ordered for the baby. He becomes irate and tells Roxie that he doesn't like little dogs for they remind him of children. He crashes the wooden box to pieces on the floor and suddenly collapses gasping and writhing on the floor. Alan tries to call Beth, Lizzie and Alan-Michael for help and they all ignore him save Roxie who is by his head the entire time. The ambulance takes him to Cedars and he is told he had a panic attack. Beth tells him that she will stay in their \"arrangement\". Alan has flashbacks of Phillip telling Alan to help him. He has another conversation with Buzz who tells Alan he must let his children be themselves and place the past in the past. Alan tells Ray that he has figured out what his redemption is; Lizzie's baby. He tells Ray, as he rubs Lizzie's stomach, that nothing will ever harm him (the baby)."
