After Tony walks off, Danny is furious when Jeffrey arrives. He warns Jeffrey he'll be coming after him if Michelle doesn't survive. Danny reminds him it was he who didn't allow Michelle to be told about the warehouse plan. He asks Jeffrey if he is satisfied, if part of the plan involved having to lose Michelle. Jeffrey points out Danny's not totally blameless and if he'd kept his hands clean, they wouldn't be in this situation. When Danny says the facade is over and Salerno can be put away for ordering the hit on Eden, Jeffrey stresses the drug connection hadn't been figured out yet. Danny heatedly tells Jeffrey he's going to do things HIS way, and he's more than welcome to come along for the ride.\n\n\nElsewhere at Cedars, Buzz, Frank, Marina and Shayne are all keeping a vigil and waiting for word on Michelle's condition while she is in surgery. A distressed Mel comes by to report she's found out Ed is quarantined in the African village and unable to travel. She adds she has a friend with diplomatic ties who will try to notify Ed about Michelle's condition. Aside, Buzz asks Frank if he considers the explosion an act of foul play. All Frank will admit to is the explosion is deemed \"suspicious\" at the moment. \n\n\nIn Jeffrey's suite at The Beacon, as Gus and Eden are talking, she suddenly has second thoughts about the whole plan. But Gus talks her out of it. Harley arrives to report Eden's funeral will be tomorrow. Eden insists on going to the funeral herself, tearfully pleading to at least see Bill one last time, but Gus tells her she'll have to stay away from the event so she won't blow her cover. Gus' cell phone rings and he notices the call is from Alan. Eden comments the Spauldings are the only family Gus has left now. After saying Alan will probably be glad she's \"dead\", Eden reminds Gus there is a higher-up in Spaulding Enterprises connected to the Antimonius trade who could be Alan. \n\n\nBack at Bill and Eden's, he studies the revolver, and holds it as though aiming it at someone. Olivia knocks and when Bill won't answer, she opens the door and sees him holding the gun. She asks him to put it down, and he does, slowly. Olivia extends her heartfelt condolences. Bill tells her Eden's death wasn't an accident and not only is Vinnie Salerno to blame, he is going to pay. Olivia tells Bill to cool down or else she'll be going to HIS funeral next. Bill is adamant, saying he is going to make Salerno suffer the same way Eden did. Olivia tells Bill instead, he's probably mad at Eden for dying, but Bill assures her he isn't - Eden didn't choose the way she died. Tony arrives and Bill aims the gun at him. Tony tries to tell him he would feel the same way if he were in Bill's shoes. Olivia whisks Tony outside, where she tells him not to tell Bill about what happened to Michelle; he has all he can handle right now. Tony comes back inside. Even though Bill is calmer, he accuses Tony of having some role in Eden's death. He reminds Tony of how he stood by and watched Salerno's men beat him to a pulp. Tony says a few kind words about Eden and how things were starting to look up for her, she had been about to make a fresh start. \n\n\nAt Olivia's, Gus and Harley arrive to speak with Alan, but before doing so, she makes sure he can still pull off the \"act\" regarding Eden. Gus assures her he can. When Alan gives him his condolences, it is hard for Gus to pretend to be grieving. Alan says although he'd always worried Eden would get Gus entangled in one of her messes one day, he admired her for the fact that she was loyal to her brother. Gus says it is hard because part of him is reacting like a brother, and the other part like a cop. When Alan asks if he means there is foul play involved, Alexandra arrives and gives Gus her condolences as well. He mentions Alex knew Eden as much as anyone in town, and asks if she knows of anyone who wanted her dead. Caught off guard, Alex intimates she doesn't know of any enemies Eden had. The foursome sits for a while at a table, but it is obvious Alexandra is a bit nervous and edgy about something. After Gus and Harley leave, he remarks on how nervously Alexandra had reacted to Eden's death. Back at the table, Alex announces she has to leave. When Alan asks where she is going, she says she is going to meet with Brad Green. Even though Eden's gone, the business world still has to revolve and she's meeting with Brad to prepare an announcement regarding the Bad Girl campaign. \n\n\nBack at Jeffrey's suite, he tells Eden from now on, she'll be known as Alison Grey; from now on Eden August will only exist on a tombstone. He gives her a new passport, driver's license and other identification in the name of Alison Grey and tells her she'll be living in a small town in New Mexico. Alison will be a woman who's just gotten out of a bad relationship and wants to start fresh in a new town. When Eden asks if she has a say in it, Jeffrey says no, not if she wants to live. When Harley and Gus arrive, Jeffrey asks how it went. Gus and Harley say it appears Alexandra is hiding something. Eden asks Gus if he'll be able to make an arrest if it turns out a member of his family is involved. Gus states he'll take down half the town if necessary. \n\n\nAfter she helps lay out some clothes for him to wear at the funeral, Bill asks Olivia to help him find something for Eden to wear in her casket. She says she'll find something colorful that will express who Eden was. After Olivia asks if there is anything more she can do, Bill thanks her for being there for him during this time. \n\n\nBack at Cedars, Rick announces to everyone the surgery went well and Michelle is expected to live, BUT is in a coma. When Danny asks how long it will be until Michelle regains consciousness, Rick says he doesn't know. In a broken voice, Rick asks everyone to look in on Michelle from time to time and to speak to her, adding how the sound of familiar voices seems to help coma patients recover more quickly. After thanking all of them for being there, Rick walks away. He later tells Danny that Mel was able to get through to Ed by phone and had given him the news about Michelle. Rick says it is okay for Danny to look in on Michelle. When Danny sits by Michelle's side and holds her hand, he tells her she is his life; she always will be. He asks her to come back to him. \n\n\nLater, Tony sits with Michelle while Danny makes a call to Mike Bauer. When Robbie gets on the phone, Danny tells him how much he loves him. But when Robbie asks to speak with his mommy, Danny tells the boy his mother is sleeping. After the call, a nurse approaches Danny with a flower arrangement. When Danny checks the card, he discovers the arrangement was sent by none other than Vinnie Salerno. He hands the arrangement back to the nurse and tells her to give the flowers to a patient who really needs them.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill prepared to face Salerno. Olivia arrived and talked to him, had him slightly calmed down when Tony showed up to offer his respects. Bill demanded to know who killed her.

Gus pumped Alan and Alex for information eluding to her possibly being murdered. Alex behaved nervously when questioned. Jeffery brought Eden her new life as Allison Grey, living in New Mexico.",
