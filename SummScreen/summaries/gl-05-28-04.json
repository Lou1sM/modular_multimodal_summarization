She then announces to the crowd that they're there to celebrate Eden's life, not mourn her.  The crowd immediately understands, with Billy giving a toast to Eden and Tammy playing light music on the stereo.  Now the crowd is talking more.  Encouraged by Joey to speak with Edmund, Tammy apologizes to him for everything she did and everything she said.  To her relief, he accepts her apology.  A happy Tammy then tells Josh and Reva that she's moving back into the Beacon, something Joey's glad about.  Meanwhile, Sandy has gone outside to get some air when she's spotted by Marina.  Marina comments how he finds a reason to escape when he's around her and Shayne.  She thinks it's because he feels like a third wheel and so she resolves to fix him up with someone.  Later, Sandy surprises Reva and Josh by asking to stay at their place because his has flood damage.  Reva happily says yes.  Not long after Reva goes off to talk to Cassie, Josh, getting off the phone, relates to Sandy that he just spoke to his landlord (to offer to help repair the building) and learned that Sandy was lying.  Sandy admits that he lied; he just wanted to do something to make Reva happy.  Josh understands but warns Sandy to never lie to him again.  Also, at the funeral, Darci asks Frank about what the authorities believed caused the warehouse explosion.  Frank said the Fire Dept. is calling it an accident.  Darci, though is sure this was a mob hit and implores Frank to keep the case open.  Having some questions of his own, Frank assures Darci he will.\n\n\nDanny is at Michelle's bedside at Cedars.  He's doubtful that he being there and talking to her is doing any good, but Rick assures Danny that Michelle can hear him  and hearing his voice will help her.  Rick then leaves the room and runs into Bill, who's there to see Michelle.  Realizing that Bill thinks Michelle is working, Rick tells Bill that Michelle's at ICU.  Shocked, Bill rushes into the room, sees Danny and demands to know what he did to her.  Rick intervenes and tells Bill to take it easy and he and Danny explain that Michelle was at the warehouse the night of the explosion.  Bill's upset that no one told him Michelle had been injured and blames himself for what happened since he and Michelle argued about Eden and he figures that Michelle followed Eden.  Danny reassures Bill that he's not to blame and encourages Bill to spend time with her.  Bill suddenly asks if Salerno was involved in the explosion, but Danny denies it. When Danny leaves, Bill apologizes to Michelle for everything he said to her and encourages her to get better because she's needed.\n\n\nSalerno is in his office burning Eden's obituary card when Tony comes in.  Tony's upset about the hit Salerno put on Eden.  Vinnie's a little annoyed at Tony's disrespectful tone and warns that he's letting his personal feelings about Danny cloud his judgment.  While they're discussing Danny, Danny walks in.  Salerno dismisses Tony.  When Salerno tries to get Danny to go back to the hospital, Danny says that he needs a distraction.  He offers to get the drugs back that Eden flushed; he just needs the name of the supplier in San Cristobel.  However, a slightly suspicious Vinnie refuses to give the name and dismisses Danny.  Upon leaving Salerno's office, Danny runs into Bill, who's there to confront Vinnie.  Danny tries to warn Bill of the danger of confronting a man like Salerno, Bill is adamant, claiming that he has nothing left to lose.   Seeing no other way, Danny gives Bill an address and tells him to go there now.\n\n\nAt the safehouse, Eden is struggling with Gus and Jeffrey.  Jeffrey warns her again that she can't see Bill.  He tells her that she has to remain \"dead\" not only for her protection but for the lives of everyone connected to her.  Finally seeing the wisdom of Jeffrey's argument, a tearful Eden says goodbye to Gus and Harley and tells Gus that she wants one thing from him before she goes--a wedding date.  Although she knows she can't attend his and Harley's wedding, she wants to know the exact date so she can be happy for him.  Caught off guard, Gus is having trouble coming up with one, but Harley does--Gus and Eden's dad's birthday.   Finally happy for Gus and Harley, a tearful Eden leaves with Jeffrey.  Almost immediately after, Bill arrives at the room.  Just then Eden, having forgotten something, rushes in, and she and Bill come face to face! Danny and Tony are back at the hospital with Michelle.  Suddenly Michelle opens her eyes.  She sees Tony, remembering he saved her, and then slips back into unconsciousness.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Buzz showed up at the reception after the funeral at the Beacon. Marina said that the reception was drab and wanted to liven it up. Billy backed her up, they put on some music and got the party started. Joey encouraged Tammy to go talk to Edmund and apologize. Lizzy didn't look all that thrilled about the cease fire. Salerno threatened Tony for the way he was speaking to him. Tony expressed that killing Eden wasn't in his or the business's best interest. Danny tempted Salerno with promises of getting his money back as long as he gave up the name of the drug supplier but Salerno wasn't buying it. Salerno sent him back to the hospital. Bill showed up at Salerno's with a head full of steam. Danny gave him the address where Eden was staying to keep him from confronting Salerno. Bill got to the room just in time to see Eden. Bill asked Rick if he knew where Michelle was and saw her name on the room plate. He said it was his fault that Michelle was at the warehouse because he told Michelle about a fight that he and Eden had. Harley and Gus set a date for their wedding - his fathers birthday. Sandy asked to move in with Josh and Reva siting that his apartment house was flooded. Josh found out it was a lie but allowed him to move in anyway. Michelle woke up but didn't seem to recognize Danny.",
