    "imdb": "A lab technician informs Phillip that Olivia's baby is actually Alan's. What Phillip doesn't know is that the lab technician has been working secretly with Alexandra. Alex tells Phillip that it is really best if Olivia's baby is Alan's child. Phillip is upset and tells Alex to stay out of his affairs. Eden claims to have left her mob ties behind when she moved to Sprinfield. Her explanation is fine for Marah and Tony but Danny is not convinced and tells Tony to stop acting as Eden's bodyguard. Harley is having a difficult time not being on the police force. Seeing this, Eden comes to Harley with a proposition. Alan brings Gus some information he has gathered about the Hendon murder, much to the bewilderment of the police department. Publicly, Gus tells the entire station that Alan is his biological father.",
    "tvmega_recap": "Harley is having issues with her new position as a stay-at-home mom, and Eden comes to offer her a job. Alan visits Gus at the station, and everyone keeps interrupting them. Finally, Gus announces that Alan is his father and that his visit is nothing more than a father visiting his son, so everyone should stop trying to suck up. Danny is very upset that Tony wants to be Eden's bodyguard. Eden overhears them talking and leaves. Olivia keeps answering Phillip's cell phone, but the caller keeps hanging up. When Phillip gets back from his run, he calls the lab technician, and they agree to meet in 10 minutes. The technician reveals that Alan is the father. Phillip again promises him a job at Spaulding if he keeps quiet about the results. Later, we see the technician taking money from someone we can't see (my guess is it's Alex), and he tells them that Phillip will never know that he is really the father of the baby."
