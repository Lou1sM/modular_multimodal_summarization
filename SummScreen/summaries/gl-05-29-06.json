Reva steps out and asks them why they are talking about her son, feigning the fact she already knows. Lizzie tells her that she just remarked to her mother how sad the charges are against him by Ashley. Jonathan and Lizzie make out on the couch and he bribes RJ to leave them alone. Cassie tells them both they have to move out for this. Ava and Coop paint the nursery and share a tender moment, kidding with each other. Lizzie sees the nursery and thinks Coop painted it. He corrects her and tells her that he is looking forward to being a father. Gus tries to make a move on Dinah and kisses her, telling her now they can get their revenge. She rejects him and tells him to just get over it. Mallet sees Gus kissing her and he and Gus start fighting. Gus is obviously drunk and Mallet tells him to stay out of his life. Harley finds Gus and tries to get him to come back to her. He leaves her sitting sadly alone. Reva goes to Jonathan and tells him that he and Tammy cannot pick up and leave town now. He wants to know one good reason why. Reva says, \"Because\", and she hesitates, \"you are going to be a father\". Jonathan stares at her in disbelief."
