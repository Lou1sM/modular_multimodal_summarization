Memories overtake him as recalls the night he shot his son. He seizes a photo and begins to shout that Phillip should never have dared him to stop him from leaving with the children. He reminds the photo that of all people he should have known best that he would do anything to keep his family safe. \n\n\nDownstairs, Gus has received another cryptic message saying that the killer is still out there. \n\n\nAt Company, Buzz is pleading with Frank to let Harley go so she can find the freedom she deserves. Frank is convinced that his sister would be safer behind bars where he can protect her. Danny walks into the room and overhears the conversation. He tries to bow out saying he has heard nothing and seen nothing. Buzz calls him back and appeals to him to help Frank be sensible about pursuing Harley. Frank is disgusted when Danny sides with Buzz. \n\n\nHarley has discovered Olivia attempting to bury some letters on the grounds of Spaulding. Harley wants to know why. Olivia tells her the letters are evidence that she was an idiot. She wrote them when she was pregnant with Emma and still believed in her relationship with Phillip. After speaking to Olivia, Harley is convinced that she is not Phillip's killer. \n\n\nGus has noticed that Alan has been missing and goes searching for him with a flashlight. He finds the secret room in the attic and surprises Alan who has been wearing bloodied gloves and pouring him self drinks. Alan hides the gloves as Gus approaches and explains that the room is a place he goes when he is suffering and does not wish to be seen. While explaining, he notices that the gloves are hanging partially out of the drawer. He attempts to block the sight from Gus by standing and telling Gus how much he misses Phillip. He begins to unravel and starts to shout about the importance of family. Gus gives him a puzzled look and says they need to get out the attic. Before leaving, Alan casts one last look at the gloves. \n\n\nOutside at Company, Danny finds Harley who is about to rush inside to see her boys who she has seen from the window. Danny stops her and tells her it would only be worse since she can't have them with her on the run. He asks her to hide in the bushes while he goes inside. He returns with Zack and Jude and asks them to tell him all the things they like and the things they like to do. Harley watches on with tears in her eyes. Afterwards, she thanks Danny and tells him that she intends to run until Phillip's real killer is caught. Inside, Frank has received word from Rick that it's been discovered that Harley's is not the body at the morgue.\n\n\nGus and Alan have returned to the study to the news that Harley is not dead and is now considered a fugitive. Alan feigns happiness for Gus but tells him he has the feeling that Gus knew along that Harley was alive. Gus counters by saying he has the feeling Alan was happier when he thought Harley was dead. Alan offers the Spaulding resources in finding Harley. Gus mutters sarcastically about the offer and refuses. He prepares to leave the study when Alexandra stops him with a hug and whispers that she has packed a bag for Harley and it is waiting in the hallway. Outside, he finds Harley and they begin the investigation anew as fugitives. \n\n\nIn the study, Alan tells Alexandra he wants to be alone. Once she leaves, he makes a call to an anonymous person and requests that bounty hunters be set out to find Harley Cooper. He will pay three times the usual amount but he wants her found dead or alive - the 'alive' part is of little importance, he adds before hanging up. \n\n\n",
