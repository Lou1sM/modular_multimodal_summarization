He tries to deny it and finally admits but that he will not admit it to anyone else. He tells her that Tammy and he will still move. Reva tries to tell him that he will make a good father and not to turn his back on his own baby. Jonathan tells her that he is too much like Alfred. Tammy tells Ava that she knows she loves Coop and that if her guy was having a baby by another woman, she isn't sure she could be as generous. Josh and Billy are at Cross Creek waiting for Cassie and Reva. He is excited about telling Reva about moving the cabin to Springfield. When there is a knock at the door, he runs to the door and kisses (surprise) Cassie. They both are embarrassed. Billy giggles. Josh calls Reva who lies and says she missed her flight and that Cassie will have to stand in for her. Reva goes home and as she is taking a shower, finds clumps of hair coming out. She starts to cry hysterically. Lizzie tells Coop that she will move back into the mansion because she is afraid to stay alone in the apartment and he tells Alan and her that he will, too, for he wants to be with Lizzie and the baby. Alan isn't pleased, but tells Lizzie that the baby and she are his future and that he will turn Henry into a Spaulding. Jonathan sneaks up on Lizzie at the mansion and startles her. \"Hey, Lizzie how was your Memorial Day\", he says hatefully. She asks him what he wants. \"Just checking in on you, the baby \", he adds with disgust."
