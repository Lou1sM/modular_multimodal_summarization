He finds Lizzie at the mansion and makes her level with him about him being the baby's father. He starts to leave and Lizzie tells him he has to make an honest woman out of her. Alan, standing in hunting gear and holding a gun, tells Jonathan he will do it his way or else. Jonathan goes back to Tammy and is dressed in a tuxedo, carrying a bridal bouquet. She thinks he is asking her to marry her and finally, after seeing a very pregnant Lizzie standing behind Jonathan, realizes Jonathan is the baby's father. He tries to explain to Tammy and she throws him out. Time seems to pass by and Lizzie pitches a newborn baby into Jonathan's hands and tells him that he has to learn to catch a child when he falls. Jonathan, at Company's nursery, holds his son. Buzz tells him the child will grow to hate him. Alan and Beth dress Jonathan in \"Spaulding attire\" and tell him what they expect of him. Lizzie tells him it's not to bad being Mr. Lizzie Spaulding. Year pass and a very young boy asks his daddy who the pictures are. Jonathan is looking at the pictures of Henry Cooper Bradshaw and Tammy as they have made it big time. The little boy wants to play ball and Jonathan makes him cry telling him no. Lizzie gets mad. Jonathan starts drinking heavily. Years later, a graying and drunken Jonathan starts a fight with a teen. He ends up slapping him and as the teen leaves, he tells him, \"I'm sorry, Johnny\". Jonathan visits Reva and tells her that he has turned into Alfred. He receives a phone call from a doctor telling him that his son, Jonathan Randall, Jr., has been in a motorcycle accident. As he goes to the hospital, Lizzie screams that Jonathan is at fault for he never loved him. The doctor leads him to a body; the body of his dead son. Jonathan sobs heartbroken. Suddenly, Lizzie brings Jonathan back to reality. He tells her that no matter what type of screw up she is, the baby is Coop's. He returns to Tammy, kissing her and hears his last words to Lizzie, \"Yeah, the baby is all Coops' and I am not going to give you anymore trouble for we both have exactly what we want."
