A beautiful woman visits and Mallet tells Dinah she is his possibly his new partner, Brooke Pearson. Dinah is obviously jealous. The car mechanic told Mallet the brakes had a slow leak and no tampering evident. Cassie fantasies about Josh rubbing her shoulders. Cassie asks Colin out on a date. Reva is shocked and afraid that Colin will tell Cassie about her cancer. Reva arranges a meeting with Jonathan and Lizzie telling them they need to tell about Jonathan being the father of the baby. Jonathan goes with Tammy to see the nursery and he cannot take his eyes from the baby items. Lizzie freaks seeing this and phones Beth for help. Lizzie, trying to scare Coop, starts to climb on the bar for a cup; Jonathan sees this and runs to \"catch\" her. Lizzie is irritated that he caught her and not Coop. Coop is frightened and tells Jonathan he was glad he was here. Jonathan tells him it was okay for Coop would have caught her if he hadn't been preoccupied (looking at Ava). Beth tells Lizzie that she will help her with the problem."
