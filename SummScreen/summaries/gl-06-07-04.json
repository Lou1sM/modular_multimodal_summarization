When she realizes Vinnie was behind the attempt on Jeffrey's life, she fears Edmund could be involved as well. Jeffrey advises her not to jump to any conclusions. Later, Cassie spots Edmund and Alan in a huddle, and can't help but assume Alan, Vinnie and he are partners in crime. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Harley is watching the social club when Danny returns from his aborted \"hit.\" Vinnie is furious that Jeffrey is still alive. Tony urges him to keep his cool and his eyes on the prize - the drug deal which is scheduled to go down at the San Cristobel Festival the next night. Danny and Tony find themselves working together towards different ends - Danny to bring Vinnie to justice and Tony to take his place. The plan is set, but there's a problem. Harley learns Vinnie plans to be out of town when the drug deal goes down, making it impossible for him to get caught along with his Spaulding supplier. \n\n\nGus confronts Alan with the photograph which proves he lied about how well he knew Eden and Vinnie. It is a painful moment for Gus as he struggles with the fact that guilty or not, Alan will always keep a portion of his life secret from his son. Gus realizes the planned takedown of Vinnie and his associates the night of the Festival might involve his father.
