The TV show stars Gus, Marina, Frank, and Mallet. Dinah, clad in a towel, too, is all excited and asks to go along. She ends up asking Mallet to let her go patrol and the camera people tell Mallet they want to see him in action on the streets and in his personal life, too. Dinah gets bored, makes a nuisance of herself and drives Mallet crazy. He collars a perp on the streets and by mistake, the guy is only buying groceries and not drugs. The camera people see Gus in an alley and Mallet makes them stop filming, but they don't and instead film a drunken-looking Gus. Mallet goes to a church after hearing about a hostage situation and Dinah ends up talking a woman out of killing her ex-fiance. Mallet is impressed, the two stay to see a bride and groom marry and Mallet ends up asking Dinah to marry him. She says yes. The camera crew continues to film all of this without Mallet and Dinah knowing. Later, Mallet and Dinah nervously ask the other if they still want to get married and they both say yes, but are not convinced themselves. The camera crew continue to film everything..."
