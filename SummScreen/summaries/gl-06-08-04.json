When he urges caution, she is able to put her fears aside for a brief moment and realize she and Jeffrey have moved beyond sniping and sarcasm to actual friendship. The moment is interrupted when Edmund appears. When they are alone, Cassie is suspicious of his every move. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Harley and Gus are preparing for the bust at the San Cristobel Festival. Harley, struggling to come up with a way to keep Vinnie from leaving town, decides to use his superstitious nature against him. She asks Reva to help. When she protests that her psychic powers are gone, Harley says all she needs is for Reva to fake her gift. At first, Reva refuses but once she realizes Cassie was almost killed, she is energized to take on Vinnie. Monitored and protected, she enters the lion's den to try to pull one over on him. \n\n\nGus, attempting to provide a false sense of security, surprises Alan and the rest of the Spauldings by informing them the Federal agents are dropping their investigation of Spaulding Enterprises. Everyone is temporarily relieved, except for Phillip, whose plan to destroy Olivia depends on the investigation. Alan assures his son they will find another way to get her out of their lives. \n\n\nMarina and Shayne pay a visit to Michelle at the ICU. After Shayne is able to charm their way past the nurse, Marina tells her \"sleeping\" friend they are going to surround her with friends and family. They tape photographs and drawings all over the room. Marina is keenly aware of how lucky she and Shayne are, given that only recently he was fighting for his life in this same hospital. But by the end of the day, as they leave music for Michelle, it's unknown if they've managed to reach her. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gus assembled the Spaldings plus Brad Green to let them know that the feds cleared them and everything would be fine; forcing Alan and Phillip to come up with another plan to get rid of Olivia. The noose tightened around Salerno as Harley, Gus and Jeffery put their plan to keep him in town in place. Reva faked psychic visions of doom to encourage him to stay for the festival. There were some rather entertaining scenes between Cassie and Jeffery while they were getting drunk together - until Edmund showed up to spoil the party. Shane and Marina redecorated Michelle's hospital room with reminders of home.",
