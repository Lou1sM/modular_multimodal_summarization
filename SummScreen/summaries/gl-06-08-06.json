Frank asks Olivia to move in with him and she tells him she cannot; not now. They make love and he is very content. Later, she goes to CO2 and tells Buzz that she blew it with Frank. As Buzz and she are talking, she touches his face and Frank walks by just in time to see this. He looks sad and hurt and walks away. Beth bribes Jonathan with a $100,000 check to leave town. Josh finds the check, tears it up and tells Jonathan that he cannot leave town, then proceeds to find Beth and bawls her out for trying to bribe his family. Reva, at the hospital, eavesdrops on Lizzie's conversation with the sonogram nurse. She phones Buzz, disguises her voice and leaves a message for Henry Cooper that Lizzie's sonogram has been canceled. She phones Jonathan to come to the hospital now. Jonathan arrives, walks into Lizzie's room and Reva shoves a chair under the door, preventing him from leaving. He sees the monitor during the sonogram and says, very intrigued, \"Is that the heartbeat\"?"
