    "tvmega_recap": "There were a few touchy moments where it looked as though Salerno wouldn't go through with the plan but Danny brought him around and got the deal back on again. That took most of the episode actually. Lizzy thought Joey would ask her to the Spring Fling but instead, he asked her to go with one of his friends. She declined. Gus got into place in the wine cellar so he could witness the buy and found Alan waiting instead. Phillip insisted Olivia wear the red dress that he got for her that didn't leave much to the imagination.",
