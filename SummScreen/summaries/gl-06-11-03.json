Darcy and Frank decide that this scene is too formal and go to the bar for a beer. Gavin spooks Alex when he delivers a message that she needs to live fully for you may die. They dance. Jeff reads the note that Eden received with her bar bill and they head to the Country Club to check out her girls. Alan and Ariana get cozy on the dance floor as he fishes for information about her working for Eden versus Vinnie Salerno. She says that she has only had one boss, Eden and she gets unnerved talking about Salerno. Jeff and Eden arrive at the Club and give Gus the note she received. Gus wants to shut the operation down and Jeff says NO! Harley and Eden talk about Ariana and Alan both being wired. Eden didn't know that Ariana had subbed for another escort. Edmund pumps Cassie about the psychic reading. She is hesitant to talk. Edmund repeats Richard's message and she tells him that is what Richard said and maybe Richard was talking about Edmund being the new man coming into her life. The lights go out and Eden calls out for Nicky. The backup power doesn't come on. Frank and Darcy flirt in the darkness. He leaves to go check on the generator. Cassie suggests they leave. Edmund of course agrees. Alex screams! Stay tuned."
