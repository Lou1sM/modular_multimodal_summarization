When Edmund is confused about what she's talking about, she reveals that she knows he's running drugs from San Cristobel. Edmund is flabbergasted that she'd accuse him of dealing in drugs; Cassie tells him saw him giving a box to Salerno and saw him in a clandestine meeting with Alan.  Angry and hurt, Edmund shows her what's in the box he has---cigars.  He explains that his shipment was cigars that he was giving to the Spanish ambassador.  He also gave the cigars to Salerno as a bribe for Salerno to stay away from the gala tonight, since he wanted it to be perfect for her. After explaining himself, he stalks off.  Cassie goes after him to apologize, but he's obviously angry and suggests that perhaps she constantly told him she loved him because she wanted to believe it.  When he asks her why she couldn't have just come to her with him with her suspicions earlier, she says she doesn't know.  Edmund tells her that's not good enough and walks away.  She catches up with him again and this time lays into him for keeping secrets from her in the first place. But Edmund is still hurt that she automatically assumed he was dealing with drugs.  As Cassie is ready to respond, Alan calls her away and makes a speech to everyone at the gala.  He announces that all the money made this evening will go to a new wing in the children's museum in San Cristobel.  Cassie realizes that's what Alan and Edmund's meeting was all about.\n\n\nJoey can't believe Lizzie's story about Edmund and Tammy kissing but she convinces him that she saw it with her own eyes.  She tries to defend Tammy and reassure Joey that the kiss probably meant nothing but he's freaked out and walks away.  As he does, Tammy sees Lizzie and asks if she's seen Joey, but Lizzie stays mum.  After looking for Joey for a while, Tammy spots Edmund outside.  She can tell he's upset about something and asks what it is.  He only tells her that her mother and he had a fight and then apologizes for jumping to conclusions about her day at the cabin with Joey.  He then urges her to always be honest with Joey.  Tammy gives Edmund a hug while Joey watches from the shadows.  Later, Tammy gets a message from Joey--it includes two tickets to the Spring Fling and a note telling her to go with someone she cares about.\n\n\nOlivia and Bill are talking at the gala.  She's concerned about his drinking and tries to get him to stop by offering him coffee.  She tells him that she recognizes how much pain he's in and urges him to talk to her about losing Eden.  Bill is reluctant, but Olivia keeps pressing him to talk to her and so,  to shut her up, he kisses her.  Unbeknownst to both of them, the kiss is spotted by Phillip. Bill tries to apologize for kissing her, stating that he meant no disrespect, but she assures him that it's all right.  Phillip then walks over to the pair and starts gushing over Olivia telling Bill what a wonderful woman who doesn't have a deceitful bone in her body.  It's obvious that Phillip's praise is making Olivia very uncomfortable.  \n\n\nSalerno nabs Reva right outside the gala and escorts the reluctant to his office.  He thanks her for all her advice earlier and wants her to work for him.  Tony arrives and after Reva makes it clear that she'd rather be somewhere else, he whispers that he'll get her out.  Unfortunately, Tony's not able to convince Vinnie to let Reva leave, since Vinnie believes Reva's psychic powers will help him.  Tony tries to dissuade Vinnie by first calling Reva a flake and then stating that she could double cross Vinnie.  But Tony's objections only get Vinnie upset that Tony is unwilling to try unconventional approaches.   He tells Tony that he doesn't think Reva will betray him because (as he looks at Reva), she has a family to consider.  Reva tries to back out herself by telling Salerno that she can't really trust her abilities, but he's unconvinced and tells her to name her offer.  \n\n\nGus is in the basement of the Beacon waiting for the drop off.  Finally, someone walks in--Brad Green.  He drops off a duffle bag and then leaves.  While Harley keeps her eyes on Brad, Gus checks the bag and confirms that it contains drugs.    Later, Danny goes into the basement, gets the duffle bag full of drugs and replaces it with a suitcase full of money.  He then heads out to Salerno's.  Jeffrey tells him that once the bag is in Salerno's hands, they'll bust him.  \n\n\nUpstairs in the Beacon, Harley informs the others that she's lost Brad.  Danny goes to Salerno's and is surprised to see Reva there.  He's hesitant and tries to convince Salerno that Reva should leave but Vinnie insists that she stay. At the same time, someone goes down the basement of the Beacon.  Ready  to nab his man, Gus reveals himself.  Gun in hand he says, \"It's you.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Salerno tried to enlist Reva's services, not taking no for an answer. Cassie confronted Edmund, only to find the mysterious box contained nothing but cigars. Harley lost track of Brad Green. Joey found a distraught Edmund hugging Tammy (thanks to Lizzy). Later, Tammy received an envelope containing the Spring Fling tickets. Someone came into the wine cellar to pick up the money. Gus pulled his gun and said \u0091It's you?'",
