He warns her to not let the pressure build up until she breaks. \"It's what Phillip would have wanted.\" She stares at him in disbelief and responds that since he is the one who killed Phillip, he hardly has the right to speak for him anymore. Alan is grim-faced but has nothing to say to her rebuke. \n\n\nIn the dining room at Towers Olivia and Bill are having dinner with Emma. Olivia tells Bill she is so happy to be with such a wonderful man and asks him to adopt Emma - against Alan's wishes. Bill is ecstatic and tells Olivia he will do it. Alan arrives, overhears the conversation, and promptly tells Olivia that Phillip is Emma's father and that will never change. Olivia becomes angry and tells Alan she has a right to be happy with the man she loves and Emma needs a father. And there isn't a thing Alan can do about it. Alan snaps and grabs Olivia. He tells her she will not take Emma from him. He will see her dead first! Alexandra grabs Alan and ushers him to the bar for a drink. \n\n\nIn New York, Harley and Gus have temporarily ditched the agents after them and found shelter on the set of a soap opera about to go on the air live. One of the actors mistakes them for soap stars and asks if they've read their lines. Gus corrects the man and says he is one of the writers. Harley quips that she is there as a technical consultant. The man, in a police uniform, is ecstatic and asks Harley for advice for making his scenes as a cop more believable. Harley and Gus exchange amused glances. \n\n\nAt Lewis Construction, Sandy has found Josh who is alone and avoiding going home because of Reva's recent behavior. Sandy tells Josh he thinks Reva needs help because he saw her fighting with Jonathan earlier in the evening. Josh tries to convince Sandy that Reva does what Reva wants to do and he can't control it. Frank and Ross arrive from Towers where they went for dinner but left when they saw Alan and Olivia arguing. Sandy turns the conversation again to Reva and includes Blake this time saying he thinks those two women are lucky to have such good solid men in their lives. Josh and Ross laugh at Sandy's innocence when it comes to women. \n\n\nAt Towers, Olivia has returned to the table with Bill and Emma when her phone rings. It's Alexandra who begs her to give Alan more time with Emma. Olivia refuses. Alexandra leaves the conversation flustered and tells her brother that maybe they shouldn't focus on Harley but turn their attention to Olivia instead. Alan responds, 'who says I have to limit myself?' \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bill and Olivia decide that it's time for Bill to adopt Emma. Alan is not thrilled with the plan and makes threats towards them. Alex is worried about Alan and all the stress that he's been under. Alan tells her that he can handle it all with no problem. Sandy, Josh, Ross and Frank have a boy's night out playing cards at Lewis. The older men tell stories about the ladies. Sandy learns a lot. Gus and Harley end up on the set of a soap that is doing a live broadcast. Gus acts like he's a writer and Harley is a technical consultant to fool the cast. They end up actually being shown on live TV, but no one in Springfield sees it. They decide to stay the night on the set so they can watch the motel to see when Wallace leaves. Wallace decides to stick around for a while.",
