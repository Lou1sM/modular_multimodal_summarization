Josh tells her that he will help with Jonathan, but Reva is too disgusted to talk about it any more.  When Jonathan walks in on their conversation, Reva leaves without speaking to Jonathan.  Jonathan tries to be belligerent to Josh, but Josh tells him that he will not fire him because he had a fight with Reva.  Josh tells Jonathan he is doing a good job, and only if he fails - which is what everyone expects will happen - will Josh fire him.  Josh tells Jonathan that he needs to leave and asks him to download some information about the Oklahoma project.  Jonathan sits down to the computer and remembers Nate's words about needing money.  Since Jonathan's trust fund is gone, he sees no other way to get the money but than to embezzle from Lewis Construction.  He works on the password with no luck.\n\n\nTammy apologizes to Sandy about the \"group\" date with her mom and Edmund the previous evening and tells him she wants to be alone with him that evening.  But before they can get down to plans for a romantic evening alone together, Sandy's cell phone rings.  He excuses himself to answer it, and the conversation is very interesting.  He tells the caller that he got the letter, and that yes, he misses the caller, too.  He then goes to Tammy and tells her that Josh called and needed him to do some emergency work.  He leaves her and promises to continue the romantic evening another time.\n\n\nTammy, however, runs into Josh at the office.  She admonishes him for being a slave driver, but Josh doesn't know what she's talking about.  He tells her he didn't call Sandy, hat he gave Sandy the evening off so they could have some private time.  Tammy saves face by telling Josh that she probably misunderstand what Sandy said.  A few moments later, Tammy walks in on Jonathan, who is trying to break into the Lewis computer.\n\n\nDinah tries once again to record Edmund talking about Alonso.  This time, however, he sees the tape recorder, takes it out of her purse and demands an explanation.  She tells him that she needs his voice on a tape recorder because it's good to play to the baby.  He doesn't believe it and persists.  She tries to convince him - again - that she is the only woman for him, and kisses him.  He only gets very, very angry, and tells her that he will take any kind of seduction or talk of Alonso as a threat - \"And you know how I handle threats.\"  He then insists that she will have a happy, healthy baby, and in addition, she will join the party for Cassie that evening.\n\n\nCassie, however, has gone to hear Jeffrey sing.  She asks him if he ever thinks of what would have happened if they'd met at another time - he tells her he is more interested in the here and now.  He starts the song and she clearly enjoys it and smiles in approval.  Edmund walks in and is not happy to see her smile at Jeffrey that way.  Jeffrey sees Edmund and then acts as if he is singing the song for a beautiful woman who is seated near Cassie.  After the song, Jeffrey asks the woman if he may buy her a drink and he joins her.  Edmund tells Cassie about the part and she seems happy and they kiss.  Jeffrey, however, will not make much of an impression on his date if he keeps watching Cassie....\n\n\n",
