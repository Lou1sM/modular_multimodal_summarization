Phillip finds her at the Beacon waiting to meet one of the board members dressed conservatively but when she refuses to talk to him, he decides to do some damage control of his own. \n\n\n\n\nJeffrey enters and Phillip questions him on what the punishment would be if someone had been involved in illegal stock trading. Jeffrey tells him that the punishment would definitely involve jail time and that if Phillip doesn't handle it internally, he will handle it criminally. \n\n\nGus meets Alan and Alex in Olivia's Bar and informs them that the only way he will keep their secret and not give Alex up to the Feds is if Alan stops selling Antimonius and destroys the formula. The only way he can live with his decision to look the other way is if no one can ever be hurt by the drug again. They are pleased that he is a loyal member of the Spaulding clan. \n\n\nTammy is distraught that Joey left her the prom tickets and a curt note. She agonizes over what went wrong when Lizzie admits to telling him about her kissing Edmund. She swears she thought he already knew but it falls on deaf ears as Tammy tries desperately to find Joey and explain for herself. When he arrives at her room in answer to her message, he tells her that he can't get past the hurt and deception. He tells her that they're through. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Lizzie has caught up with Alan in the bar and tries to convince him to put Joey and her together in the 'pairs' part of the intern contest. She then goes back to Tammy to swear she'll try to get Tammy and Joey back together. Tammy tells her not to interfere, that this is something she'll have to deal with herself. \n\n\nBill goes back to Eden's apartment and deals with being there alone. In his hurt and his anger he goes on a destructive rampage. Olivia, still trying to do damage control, comes by to ask him about their kiss the other night. He tells her that it didn't mean anything and not to worry about it. When Olivia goes back to the Beacon, Phillip informs her that by selling his stock with a proxy she obtained while he was incapacitated, she committed fraud. \n\n\nDanny goes to the ICU to show Michelle the newspaper that proclaims him a hero. Ross comes by to visit her and asks Danny about the explosion, telling him that something about the scene of the accident didn't seem right. He promises Danny that if he finds out that there was more to it, he will pursue it. Danny continues to talk to Michelle's comatose form, and doesn't notice when her finger starts to move.  \n\n\n",

He walks out on her. Lizzie promises to help Tammy get Joey back, but Tammy refuses her help. Lizzie tries to convince her grandfather to let her and Joey be partners in the next stage of the intern contest. Phillip uses a hypothetical situation to question Jeffrey about the consequences of fraud. When Jeffrey tells him that it could very well mean jail time, Phillip confronts Olivia with the information. He explains that she committed fraud when she sold his stock and then bought it back in her name. Gus agrees to keep Alex's part in the drug ring a secret if Alan agrees to stop producing the antimonius and to completely destroy the formula. Phillip advises him not to give up his morals for the Spauldings. Gus isn't happy that he has agreed to lie to everyone, but he will stick to the deal. Bill completely destroys Eden's apartment in a fit of grief before Olivia shows up to ask him about the kiss they shared. Danny shows Michelle the newspaper and begs her to wake up from the coma. Ross stops by to see Michelle too, and to apologize to Danny for thinking badly of him. Ross tells him that he is looking into the explosion that put Michelle here, and he will get to the bottom of it. When Danny is alone again with Michelle, he doesn't notice when she starts to move her finger a little bit.",
