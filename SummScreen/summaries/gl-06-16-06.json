Marina arrives and flirts with Alan Michael but later admits to Frank that she's playing him for information for Harley. Coop remembers his time with Ava but then tells Lizzie that he's put his feelings for Ava behind him and that after their wedding he'll be focused on her and the baby. Jonathan and Tammy celebrate their leaving Springfield by making love. They are later interrupted by a phone call from Collin who is caring for Reva at Cedars. Reva has the flu and with her immune system compromised by chemo, it could be devastating. Jonathan makes an excuse to go see Reva without Tammy. At first Jonathan believes that Reva is fine when he hears she has the flu, but once he sees her he knows how serious things are. Jonathan asks Reva what he can do to help, and she says acknowledge his daughter. Jonathan goes off to do so, but tells Billy of Reva's condition. Reva and Billy share a tender moment when he tells her he knows about her cancer. Tammy finds Ava in Company's freezer and takes her to the wedding. Jonathan stops the wedding and tells Coop that he and not Coop, fathered Lizzie's baby. Tammy hears the admission."
