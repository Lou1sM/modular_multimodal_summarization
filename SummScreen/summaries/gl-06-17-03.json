Before leaving for the Bauer cabin, Olivia wished upon a star that her baby would be Phillip's. Shayne threw a surprise birthday party for Marina at the Lewis pool-house. After, he and Marina shared a kiss, which Lizzie witnessed. Darcy told Eden that though seeing Frank had begun as a favor to Eden, she really liked Frank and wanted to continue seeing him. Eden was upset, and wandered around Marah and Tony's empty bedroom, sniffing Tony's clothes and lying in their bed. Reva argued about Shayne with Josh, accusing him of trying to run Shayne's life because he has regrets about his own life. Josh denied this, and then became angry when he discovered Shayne's party, but Reva convinced him to let it be."
