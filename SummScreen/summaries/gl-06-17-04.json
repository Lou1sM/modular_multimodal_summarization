Despite Reva's pep talk and her own fighting spirit, Cassie's misplaced suspicion appears to have cost her the man she loves. \n\n\nBut Jeffrey won't let her quit. Now that he's become less a sparring partner and more a friend, he gives her the swift kick she needs to go to Edmund and bring him home where he belongs.\n\n\nBut before she can get to him, Tammy pays Edmund a visit. She knows he's moved out and assumes it's all her fault. Edmund is quick to reassure her but Tammy's suffered her own first heartbreak and needs to believe that true love can still exist. Edmund is touched by Tammy's desire to set everything right but when Cassie comes to him and they 're alone, he tells her he doesn't want to live his life on trial every minute of the day. Cassie's taught him to believe in himself. And since she can't share that faith in him, maybe they should go their separate ways.\n\n\nGus returns to the police station and receives a hero's welcome. Jeffrey even stops by with a commendation from the Mayor for Gus and Harley. But Gus is uneasy in the hero's role. When Alex arrives to join in the celebration, Gus's inner conflict threatens to boil over. Harley senses something is wrong but when Gus surprises her by setting the date for their wedding, the dark cloud that hangs over him seems to vanish.\n\n\nPhillip threatens to go to the DA with proof of Olivia's stock fraud, unless she agrees to his terms, which include an eventual divorce and surrendering of baby Emma to her father and his family. Olivia is horrified, but at least the gloves are off and she and Phillip can now openly hate each other. \n\n\n",
