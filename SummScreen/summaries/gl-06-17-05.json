Cassie refuses to believe that and Dinah accuses her of refusing to see Edmund for what he truly is. Cassie tells Dinah to tell her what she knows. Later, Edmund comes rushing in looking for Cassie. At this point, Dinah is alone and lies that she hasn't seen Cassie. An upset Edmund doesn't believe her and they argue over her intention this evening to tell Cassie about him. Dinah denies having any reason to do that, but he accuses her of doing it so he and Cassie would break up. An angry Edmund then starts to intimidate her and tells her that he will not allow her to destroy his family. Suddenly, Dinah gets scared and starts to run away. She grabs a shovel and holds it as if she's about to strike him. Shocked, Edmund grabs the shovel and as he's holding it in mid-air, Cassie enters the barn. Believing Edmund was going to strike Dinah, Cassie sends her into the house and tells Edmund that although she doubted Dinah's story, she believes it now. Edmund tries to convince her that it was all a set up by Dinah, by Cassie doesn't believe it. After telling him that she no longer loves him, Cassie accuses Edmund of being the same man she was so afraid of on the island. Edmund tries to tell her again that it was Dinah and he loved her, but Cassie tells him he's incapable of loving anyone but himself. After telling him that she wants him gone, Cassie leaves. Just then, Dinah enters and Edmund gives her a nasty look. When he warns her that she should be scared of him, she replies that isn't scared of him; she's in love with him. Meanwhile, Cassie has arrived at Jeffrey's door and gives him a passionate kiss. \n\nAt the Spaulding mansion, Alan is wondering where Alex put the bloody gloves. Suddenly, Sebastian enters with some new ideas on finding Harley. But Alan has a new assignment for him. He wants Sebastian to take care of a threat to Spaulding and gives Sebastian the address of where to find that threat--Wallace. When Sebastian leaves, Alexandra enters, having heard the entire exchange. Alex is upset that Alan has actually ordered this man's death, but Alan tells her he will eliminate any threat. Alex wonders if that includes herself. Alan sweetly responds that his loving, devoted sister would never be a threat to him; she's too loyal. However, he does suggest that it might be best if she gave him the gloves for safe keeping. \n\nAlso at the mansion are Coop and Lizzie who are enjoying a secret rendezvous upstairs. Suddenly, Coop finds a hidden door that leads into the attic. Lizzie knows all about the room--it was her parents' private getaway. Doing some innocent looking around, Coop opens a chest that contains poetry--Lizzie's. Against her wishes, he starts to read it and is moved by one poem that describes feelings of being alone. Coop asks Lizzie if that's how she feels but Lizzie clams up. She talks about how everyone thinks she's crazy, but he tells her that it reads as if she was lonely, not crazy. He then assures her that she isn't alone. Coop then starts rummaging through the chest again when suddenly Alex appears and tells him to get out. Alex rushes Coop out of the room, scolding the both of them that Alan would be furious if he knew Coop was there. Lizzie starts to tell Alex that she doesn't care what her grandfather thinks but Alex warns her that Coop could be Alan's next target. An upset Alex tells the confused pair that Alan's a ticking time bomb and urges them to get out. Away from the area, Coop wonders to Lizzie why Alex wasn't so much concerned about him being in the house as concerned about him being in the attic. \n\n\nAt the hide-away, Gus is setting up a surveillance camera so they can see who goes in and out of the hotel across the street. Suddenly, Harley is shocked to see Wallace entering. Because they've already been in the hotel asking questions, the pair grabs some tacky clothes and shades from the wardrobe rack and then goes back to the hotel.
