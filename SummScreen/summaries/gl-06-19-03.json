Just as the girls arrived at the pool house, Shayne gave Lizzie a comforting hug. Lizzie gave Marina a birthday gift, then left with Tammy. She then spied on Marina and Shayne through the window, and told Tammy that Marina didn't deserve him. Marina told Shayne their kiss meant nothing, but Shayne disagreed. He then asked her to prom, and she accepted. Phillip bought a tree to plant for Olivia's baby. He then promised Olivia that he would be there for her and the baby no matter the paternity, and that he would always protect the child from Alan. After, he suggested they buy a house. At the Beacon, Alan met with a mystery woman, Nicole Adams. Gus interrupted, assuming that she is an escort, and believing that Alan is trying to investigate the \"Garden of Eden\" murders on his own. Alan informed him that she is actually his lawyer. Frank told Gus the murders are becoming more personal. The lab tech that was paid to switch Olivia's test results shook down Alex for more money. Later, Alex warned Alan that his next enemy might be Phillip. Alan told Nicole to draw up the papers making Gus his true heir."
