Reva tells Billy that Jonathan is having a baby with Lizzie Spaulding. Billy sneaks her out of the hospital. At the cabin, she takes off her wig and they hug. At the wedding, Jonathan tells everyone that he is the baby's father. Alan tells Beth, who blurts out that she knew this, that she will never lie to him again. Lizzie tells Coop that Jonathan raped her. Coop is devastated. Jonathan tells Tammy about the night Lizzie and he were together. She tells him that she will ensure he stays in town for his baby girl. Lizzie, after following Coop back to the wedding area, faints \u0096 right into Jonathan's arms. Tammy is totally disgusted."
