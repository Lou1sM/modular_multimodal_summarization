After Reva and Josh both presented their cases for Stanford vs. professional baseball, it was decided that Shayne would sign both the scholarship acceptance letter and the recruiter's contract, then put both away until he made a decision after prom. Marina admitted that she would miss Shayne if he was gone, but insisted he needed to make his own decision. Shayne remarked that he wished someone would make the decision for him. Josh heard this and sent off the signed recruiter's contract without Shayne's knowledge, remarking to himself that Shayne would thank him later. Alan arrived for dinner with Harley and Gus. Harley made sure he understood that he was on her territory, and she wouldn't allow him to change her, Gus, or the kids; Alan said he understood. Gus and Alan continued to bond over cigars after dinner. When Harley expressed concern that she would lose Gus to Alan, he reassured her with an engagement ring. Harley accepted Gus's proposal. At the Beacon, Cassie was exhausted, but was determined to keep her dinner date with Edmund. After coming to a tentative truce with Jeffrey, Cassie ran a bath and lay down to rest. An irate Jeffrey, whose room on the floor below Cassie's was being flooded by her overflowing tub, soon awaked her. They both fell in the water trying to stop the flood. Jeffrey removed his soaked shirt, then argued and wrestled over a towel with Cassie. Edmund walked in just as Jeffrey yanked Cassie close with the towel."
