    "tvmega_recap": "At the wedding, Jonathan catches Lizzie as she almost faints. Tammy gets irritated and leaves. Lizzie admits to everyone that Jonathan is the father. Coop finally tells Lizzie it is over and leaves. Lizzie vows to Beth and Alan that she will get Coop to marry her. Buzz tells Coop there is someone for him; Ava. Jonathan tries to get Tammy to forgive him and she tells him forgiving him is nothing for he is going to have a baby. Billy takes Reva to a cancer support meeting and she sees Suzy's dad (the little girl whose mother has breast cancer she met a few weeks ago). The worker tells Reva the mother died. Reva makes Billy take her home. Billy gets Reva to vent about having cancer. Josh decides not to go to San Francisco and apologizes to Cassie about the kiss. They both appear uncomfortable with the other. Josh goes home and Reva tells him that Jonathan is having a baby with Lizzie. He tells Reva that she looks exhausted and that he will rearrange things to help her. She lovingly asks him \"Don't you realize we have lived together long enough to know there is nothing I cannot handle\"? Josh just looks at her and says nothing."
