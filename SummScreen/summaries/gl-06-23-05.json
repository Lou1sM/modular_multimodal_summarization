    "tvmega_recap": "Jonathan and his new girl Zoe hang out at Farley's. Nate and Jonathan confer about their plan while she is in the bathroom, looking for the earrings. Jonathan covers that they don't know each other when she comes back; Nate flirts with her. Tammy is upset to find the earrings in Sandy's place. She checks with Josh again to see if Sandy really lied about working for him tonight. Sandy is surprised to find her there when he returns; she asks him where he's been and acts very suspicious. He assures her that he's happy to see her there. They go to Farley's. Tammy almost tells Sandy about the earrings but stops. Sandy gets a call, so she goes in by herself. Jonathan sees her and decides to leave. He asks Zoe not to talk to Tammy, but she does anyway. Zoe recognizes the earrings and tells Tammy they are hers. Tammy is shocked. Sandy comes up after Zoe leaves and tells Tammy she has to leave town with Josh. At Cross Creek, Olivia gives Bill a late-father's day gift: a wallet with Emma's picture, binoculars, and a mug that says \"World's Greatest Dad\". Someone watches them and then a big pile of wood falls on Bill. He is woozy but fine. Olivia thinks Alan made the \"accident\" happen because he doesn't want Bill to adopt Emma. She phones Josh, who agrees to come out there and look into it. JOsh threatens Alan that nothing had better happen to Bill or Olivia. JOsh asks Nate to give Reva a message that he's going to Cross Creek, in case he can't find her before he leaves. Nate is happy to look after Reva. Nate tells Sebastian that he arranged for the accident in Cross Creek in order to get Josh out of town. He plans to romance (and hurt) Reva. Jonathan tries to talk him out of it, but Nate ends up physically hurting Jonathan to shut him up. Gus and Harley try to Dr. Wallace, but the police want to chat with them about the accident. They give their statements. They plan to talk to Dr. Wallace again to find out who killed Phillip. Wallace tries to write Gus a note, but he falls unconscious. Sebastian has the $100,000 check that Alan wrote to Dr. Wallace, so he questions Alan over the phone about how Wallace and Harley are connected. Later, Alan goes to the hospital and threatens Sebastian that he will tell the police that he ran over Wallace, but Alan will deny giving him that order. Sebastian prepares to smother Dr. Wallace with a pillow just as Gus and Harley are about to talk to him.",
