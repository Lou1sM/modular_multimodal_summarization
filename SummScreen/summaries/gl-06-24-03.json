She was still sick, so he told her he would care for her kids for the day. After caring for the boys, Edmund brought in a group of prom dresses for Tammy to choose from. He was afraid her choice was too revealing, but Cassie loved it. Beth and Lizzie argued over Lizzie's behavior. Beth again spoke to the boarding school headmistress, who still insisted that Lizzie started the fire at the school. Lizzie became angry and pushed Beth as she left the house. Alan arranged for Gus to have breakfast with his mother. Lucia/Regina told Alan she was afraid that Gus would never forgive her, but she and Gus began to bond over the news of his engagement to Harley. Danny was upset about the tabloid article about Eden, and asked Tony to kick her out of the museum. When he refused, Danny asked for Gus's help. Gus then told Eden she needed to move out for the safety of the museum residents. She finally relented, but drew a big red circle around a picture of Danny in her scrapbook."
