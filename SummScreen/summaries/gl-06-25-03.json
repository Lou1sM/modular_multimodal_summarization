Frank thought she was innocent, but was suspicious when she said a little too quickly that she didn't know Eden. Harley offered to talk to Eden for Gus. When she and Blake arrived at the museum, they met a spooked and angry Ben. Ben went to Company to show Gus the threatening note he had received. Beth told Phillip about her talk with the boarding school headmistress, and expressed her concern that Lizzie may have snapped. Phillip said he would take care of it, and then told Beth that Alan was the father of Olivia's baby; Lizzie overheard and was elated. Meanwhile, Olivia was overjoyed to hear that Phillip was the father, and planned a celebration dinner. When he arrived home, Phillip was confused by Olivia's news. Back at Company, Lizzie gave Ben rent money and told him he needed to fight to get his life back. Alex paid the lab technician who switched Olivia's paternity test to leave town."
