Though a tad confused by the suggestion, Gus agrees to the idea.  Soon after, Alan and Alexandra arrive.  Over dinner, Harley brings up the elopement idea and mentions that she and Gus will be eloping to Niagara Falls.  She tries to sell them on the idea by mentioning that'd be different from any other wedding she's had,  it's economical, and she could even rent a wedding dress.  It's obvious by the silence, that no one, not even Gus, is impressed with the idea.  Harley  then gives the Spauldings free reign to tell her what they think of her and Gus eloping to Niagara Falls but she's surprised when Alan and Alex say they want whatever Gus and Harley want.  Harley seems disappointed at that. No one took the bait and told her what they really thought, they were all supportive. Harley then admits that even though she was suspicious of the Spauldings, she was wrong about them.  She the tells Gus that he deserves to have his first wedding be special and agrees to let the family plan her wedding.  Later, as they're leaving (and Harley is out of the room), Alex tries to ask Gus if he took care of the incriminating evidence against her, but he tells her they'll discuss it later and rushes her out.  When Harley returns, she tells Gus she has to tell him something about Alexandra.  Gus has a worried look on his face and is relieved when Harley merely admits that Alex told her he wanted a big wedding.  Noticing his relief, she asks why he thought she was going to say, but he shrugs it off.  When Harley goes upstairs, Gus takes the document incriminating Alex out of his pocket and burns it.\n\n\nAfter a tense visit from Michelle at the hospital, Marina goes home and sees Shayne talking with Kira on the Spaulding project while Sandy is working on something alone. After Shayne and Kira leave, Marina asks Sandy if men actually fall for Kira's little act and tells him that she really wants to beat her at the contest.  She then becomes curious about what he's working on.  He tries to keep it from her, stating that she should have \"plausible deniability\", but she wants an answer.  He informs her that he's hacking into Alan Spaulding's computer.  Marina is surprised since he'd ruin his chances of winning the contest.  But Sandy could care less about the contest; he doesn't like Alan at all.  Feeling that Alan is condescending and manipulative (since he purpose split up the couples, Marina and Shayne, and Tammy and Joey), Sandy wants to teach Alan a lesson by pulling one over on him.  Marina's impressed and wants in.\n\n\nCassie is at the Beacon ready to bring dinner up to Jeffrey and is surprised to see him descending the stairs.  After thanking him for his advice about Edmund, Cassie admits that Jeffrey's a stand-up kind of guy.  However, her opinion suddenly changes when her yoga instructor comes down the stairs, definitely a guest of Jeffrey's.  Realizing that he's had  a fling, she tells him that she's reminded of what a shallow \"jump anything that moves\" guy he is. Later, she's at the farm and is shocked when Jeffrey just barges in.  While Cassie's angry at his intrusion, he's mad because she was rude to him at the hotel and wants an apology.  Realizing that Jeffrey won't leave until she talks to him, Cassie tells him that the  problem is that when it comes to relationships, he acts like a college kid instead of an adult.   He asks why it makes a difference to her and she replies that it doesn't; she just doesn't like being lied to since she thought he once cared about her niece.  Jeffrey shoots back that he did care about Marah, that's why he put her on the plane.  As Jeffrey makes himself comfortable at the farm, Cassie gets uncomfortable and admits it's because Richard used to visit the farm a lot and it freaks her out to see Jeffrey there.  Jeffrey then apologizes for barging in, and after some prompting, she half-heartedly apologizes for insulting him  at the hotel.  They then talk about Cassie's moving to the farm and Jeffrey's leaving town once the case is wrapped up.   Later, Jeffrey calls Cassie on the reason he always annoys her -- because he shares the face of a certain man but acts nothing like him.  Cassie maintains that it could be true and asks why she annoys him.  He confesses that it's because she reminds him of someone too.  Cassie starts to ask questions, but Jeffrey will only say the woman is gone, the relationship was toxic and he got out before any more damage was done.  Cassie tries to talk some more about Jeffrey's mystery woman but he clams up and starts to leave.  She asks him why he's told her this now, since he's leaving soon, and he tells her it to show her that she was wrong about him not caring about anyone.   Cassie tells Jeffrey that does think he's wrong about not being able to have a meaningful relationship again and thinks he should get rid of his hang-ups.  He replies that hang-ups are good, they keep you from making the same mistake twice.  As they both bond over their ability to hold grudges, Edmund enters with a very unhappy RJ.\n\n\nDanny accidentally wakes up Michelle at the hospital as he's fixing her blanket. She's kind of annoyed and tells him that he doesn't need to be there all the time. Danny suggests that while she's up, they can go over the pictures again to jog her memory, but Michelle's tired of doing that.  She suggests that he touch her, however his hand to her face has no effect.  Not long after, Marina arrives for a visit, but Michelle is hostile since she feels as if she's on exhibit.  And hearing Marina describe Michelle and Danny as a \"super couple\" doesn't make Michelle feel any better.  Later, Bill drops in for a visit, which pleases Michelle since she thinks he's hot.  She's disappointed though, and surprised, when she learns that they were always just friends.  Bill explains that they did trying dating once but she was hung up on some other guy.  Michelle figures out he's talking about Danny and realizes that Bill doesn't like him.  Intrigued, she tries to get him to give her some dirt on Danny, but Bill won't say anything bad about him.  Michelle theorizes that perhaps the reason she doesn't get an emotional vibe from Danny is because their marriage wasn't as loving as everyone thought.  However, Bill shoots that down but admitting that both she and Danny loved each other.  Meanwhile, in the hall, Rick tells Danny that Michelle can be discharged.  When Danny starts to get excited, thinking that being home will jog her memory, Rick warns him not to be too optimistic.  They then inform Michelle, who is less than enthusiastic.  When the guys all start talking about the upcoming Bauer Barbecue, Michelle suddenly freaks out and tells them to get out and leave her alone.\n\n\n",
