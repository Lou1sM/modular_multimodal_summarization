He suggested they confront Salerno together, but she refused because it would be too dangerous. Bill returned and told Marah he was afraid he wasn't there enough for Eden, but Marah said it was easier for Eden to open up to Tony because of their pasts. At Company, Gus and Harley decided that while Ben had the best motive, Eden was still the most viable \"Garden of Eden\" killer. Olivia was ready to celebrate that the baby was Phillip's, but Phillip accused her of lying. Olivia was astounded, and continued to insist that she was telling the truth. Phillip left, telling her to be gone when he returned. He met Rick outside Company, and told him Olivia had lied about her baby's paternity. Rick tried to justify it, but Phillip didn't want to hear it. When Rick started imitating Phillip and Olivia, Phillip said he wasn't in the mood. When he returned to the loft, Olivia was gone. Alex and Lizzie were overjoyed when they saw Olivia moving into the Beacon alone. Lizzie suggested to Ben that he go to the prom to see Marina, but he refused."
