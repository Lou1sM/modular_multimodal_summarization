Afterwards, Harley receives a phone call from Mallet informing her she is not safe with Gus because Alan knows where she is and he intends to kill her. Harley convinces Gus that they should separate until things cool down and they can find each other again. As they make their plans, Alan is seen in the shadows aiming a gun at Harley as she kisses Gus. She departs to leave the studio, but hears a gun shot and finds that Gus has been shot. She is shocked to see Mallet standing over Gus with a gun in his hand. \n\n\nAt Jeffrey's apartment, Jeffrey tells Cassie that she called him Richard. Cassie doesn't believe him and insists if she did it was because earlier Edmund was there and planted doubts in her mind. Jeffrey is bothered by the idea that Cassie's only attraction to him is as a reminder of her dead husband. Cassie asks Jeffrey to blindfold her and proceeds to tell him that it was him - not Richard - she has depended on all these months. Dinah interrupts the exchange to inform Cassie that Edmund has plans to keep the baby to himself once it is born. She leaves abruptly when Cassie asks if she can feel the baby move. \n\n\nAt Nate's bar, Jonathan has found Reva alone with Nate who she doesn't know is really Alfred. He accuses her of never being happy even though she has the perfect life. He uses her desire to be with Nate as proof of her selfishness. Reva responds that Nate isn't his business and tells him she wants to help him because he is her son. Jonathan is overcome and demands that she admit he isn't good enough to be her son. He yells at her to tell him she would love him more if he looked more like Shayne. He begins to cut his hair with knife and cries that she answer if he is more like her son and can love him now. Nate watches on with naked amusement. He breaks the exchange when Reva holds Jonathan and cries with him. He tells Jonathan to leave and go someplace else because no one wants him there. Jonathan sobers and tells them they deserve each other. \n\n\nDinah is in the hallway preparing to enter her suite when Jonathan approaches and hints that he wants to go to bed with her. She looks at his hair and tells him to go away because she wants to be alone. Once she is inside, Jonathan enters her room and discovers an apparatus she has been using to simulate pregnancy. Dinah admits she miscarried weeks ago but needs more time to work on Edmund before revealing the truth. She will 'do anything' if Jonathan will keep her secret. They make love. \n\n\n",
