Jonathan agrees to hide in the bathroom but only after Dinah promises he can have as much mindless sex with her as he wants...he assures her it is a lot! Cassie marches into the room and demands to know what is wrong with Dinah, who tells her she just felt a little dizzy. Cassie panics and wants to take her to a doctor but Dinah tells her it is nothing. Jonathan surprises them both by walking out of the bathroom and announcing to Cassie that he and Dinah are seeing each other. Cassie is furious! Dinah tries to tell her Jonathan is helping to protect her from Edmund. Jonathan kisses Dinah goodbye and leaves her to deal with Cassie by herself. Cassie has all sorts of advice for Dinah, but they are interrupted by a knock on the door. It is Twyla, whom Cassie has hired to be Dinah's personal doula, or birth coach. Dinah freaks! She refuses to let Twyla touch her, for good reason. Twyla tries to reassure her it is okay, for now. She starts to teach Dinah and Cassie breathing exercises. Cassie is surprised as she suddenly realizes the baby is coming soon. \n\n\nReva tries to reach Josh, Olivia and Jonathan by cell phone but no one answers. She leaves messages and tells them she needs to speak to them all immediately. After leaving Dinah's room, Jonathan comes to talk with Reva. She tells him his adoptive father is alive but Jonathan refuses to hear it. He tells her he does not want to see his father; they are all better off leaving it alone. Reva refuses to let it die. She tells him they need to find Alfred so he can confront him. Jonathan tries to tell her there is a lot at stake and not to follow through with her plan. But he can't talk freely as Nate is listening to everything. \n\n\nHarley is distraught at the sight of Gus on the floor of the studio. It appears he has been shot in the chest. When Mallet appears with a gun, she is furious, assuming he has killed Gus. Mallet grabs Harley and tries to carry her away. They are fighting when a policeman sees them and points his gun at them. Mallet talks to him, telling him he is also a cop. He says he needs to call for backup and for an ambulance. When the policeman does so, Mallet grabs Harley and they run. He takes her to his hotel room where she is very angry. But Mallet admits to Harley that Gus is not dead; it was an elaborate plan he and Gus concocted to get Harley out of danger. Harley is both relieved and angry. \n\n\nAlan saw Gus fall to the studio floor and believes Gus is dead. Sebastian, having followed Alan, grabs him and convinces him to leave the studio. Alan is distraught. Sebastian takes him to the hospital where he receives medication and oxygen. While the medication takes effect, Sebastian hears Alan admit to killing Phillip.
