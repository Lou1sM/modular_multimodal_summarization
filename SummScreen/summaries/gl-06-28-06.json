Billy takes her to the cancer center and she makes him leave her there. Later, Billy prays to G-d to bring Reva home. Reva meets a brusk woman named Tracey who has cancer, too. They bond and during the night, Tracey dies after her battle with cancer. Colin happens to be the attending physician for Reva. She gets him to help her with her 10 things she wants to do before she dies. One of them is to kiss David Cassidy, the singer. At a club, that plan fell through and Colin sings Karaoke to Cassidy's song, \"I Think I Love You\". Reva is elated. Colin helps Reva make a tearful goodbye video for her children and Josh. Then, he takes Reva to the car race track where she meets the racer, Travis Kvapil who lets her work with the pit crew. She dons a racing suit, takes the car around the track several times, speeds like a demon, and stops short of the checkered line. Colin applauds her, she lifts her visor and all you can see are her dark eyes, looking at the ..Finish Line."
