She's tired from a day of meeting people, and they decide to go to bed: a decision fraught with its own awkwardness. Upstairs, Danny moves cautiously, not wanting to make Michelle uncomfortable in her own home. By the end of the night, they climb into bed together, but she cannot get comfortable in his arms. Danny quickly volunteers to sleep in the guest room despite Michelle's protests she's making him feel unwelcome in his own bed. She asks for him to stay in the room while she goes to sleep so Danny, alone and on the other side of the room, complies. \n\n\nCassie has invited Edmund to stay the night and, as before, he's hesitant. Cassie changes gears, telling him she knows she's done wrong but he's failing them too, by not trusting their relationship enough to weather any storm they encounter. Tammy and Remy walk in on this scene and decide to give fate a push by loosening the battery cables on Edmund's car. He had been ready to leave, despite Cassie's words, but the combination of her common sense, love and affection, and his sudden car trouble, makes Edmund realize he's been wrong. He and Cassie reconcile, and they make love. \n\n\nPhillip finds Olivia enraged over having her access cut off to Spaulding credit. He takes it one step further and presents her with a script she's to read at the board meeting tomorrow, announcing her resignation and Phillip's ascendancy to the company's helm. Humiliated, she waits until Phillip is gone, and then meets a mysterious man at the Beacon to make her own arrangements. \n\n\nTony and Bill go to the Social Club so he can get a look at what Tony intends for the place. But, in the middle of their meeting, Josh and Billy arrive to demote Bill. He is outraged but they insist it's a temporary situation until he pulls through this rough patch he's in currently.\n\n\n",
