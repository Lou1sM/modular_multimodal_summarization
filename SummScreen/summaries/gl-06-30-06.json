Lizzie goes out onto the Cedars hospital roof in hopes of getting Coops' attention and winds up in danger when the scaffolding she's on breaks from the building. She's eventually rescued by Gus. Tammy goes to meet Jonathan in the islands, unaware that Alan has been there to persuade Jonathan to sign over custody of the baby. Alan offers Jonathan a weekly bank deposit and the house. Tammy is not aware the house is a gift from Alan, provided Jonathan signs away his rights to his grandchild. Jonathan lies to Tammy saying he mortgaged the bar to buy the house. Tammy tells Jonathan that she had to take Lizzie to the hospital but that everything with the baby is fine. Gus is at Cedars for a Narcotics anonymous meeting when a nurse tells him that someone is on the roof about to jump. Gus eventually rescues Lizzie with Harley looking on. Gus and Harley talk at their shell of a house. Alan and Beth agree that there can't be anymore episodes like that from Lizzie and that maybe Lizzie isn't fit to raise her own child."
