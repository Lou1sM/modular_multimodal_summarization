They promised they would go to the cabin by the end of the summer, but said they couldn't cancel the barbecue. Marah told Tony she wanted to throw a surprise wedding for Danny and Michelle at the barbecue. She offered to take charge of the barbecue, but the Bauer's said no. Rick asked Ed to come back to work at Cedars. Ed said he would need to hire more help for the clinic, but he didn't have the funds. Danny offered the money, but Ed declined. Danny set up the donation anyway, hoping it would give the Santos name good publicity. At the prom, Shayne and Marina danced, while Lizzie looked on in jealousy. Devries called Josh, telling him there was a rumor that Shayne was going to college. Josh assured him he was wrong. Later, Josh received word that Shayne had been drafted in the fifth round by the Chicago Cubs. He tried to tell Shayne the news, but Shayne got upset that he was being pressured before Josh could finish. Reva told Marina she thought Shayne and Marina were good together. When Marina started to feel uncomfortable from Reva's words, she went outside to escape, asking Lizzie to tell Shayne to meet her there. Lizzie lied and told Shayne she didn't know where Marina was. Ben arrived, surprising Marina. Meanwhile, a woman named Caroline Boyle told Gus and Jeffrey that, two years ago, her best friend, Bridget, disappeared after dating Ben. Gus and Jeffrey decided they needed to bring in Ben for questioning, then went to the country club to find him."
