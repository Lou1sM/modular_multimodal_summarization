After some assurances from Jeffrey, Cassie is finally ready to go inside. Tammy's also there and is very surprised to see her mother with Jeffrey. After giving her blessing on the relationship, Tammy asks to speak to Jeffrey alone. She asks him what she should do if someone seems to be hiding something.

Suddenly, Edmund starts knocking on the door demanding that Dinah open up.

Dinah tries to flirt with Edmund, to get him to provide what she needs, but he points out that he'd only be using her. Jonathan's in a mood and explains that everyone uses everyone. When Edmund implies that Jonathan should be glad he's changed for Cassie and the baby, Jonathan asks what if there was no baby? Edmund can't take Jonathan any longer and abruptly leaves the room. Dinah's a little concerned about Jonathan's hostility and tries to get him to talk about his childhood but he clams up and leaves the room to get ice. He runs into Tammy.

He thinks the baby needs a stable, unified family, but Cassie insists that she's going through with the divorce. Edmund then tells Cassie that her name is not on the contract that Dinah drew up earlier.

All she has to do is choose between the baby and Jeffrey O'Neill. \n\n\nMallet enters the hospital and asks the nurse where Sebastian's room is. She tells him, but when he enters the room is empty--except for Harley who is there for the same reason he is.

Instead of listening to Mallet's advice that she go back into hiding, she spins the theory that Sebastian killed Wallace. Mallet states that he'll talk to the hospital staff, but Harley tries to tell him she needs to come along. Suddenly, Harley's phone rings. It's Gus who's just learned that Harley snuck out while he was sleeping. Gus gives Harley the same argument that Mallet did that she's not safe on the outside but she's not listening to him either.
