    "tvmega_recap": "Alan invited Alex and Phillip to the mansion. He informed Phillip that someone had fixed the first paternity test, and that Phillip was actually the father of Olivia's baby. Phillip didn't believe him at first, but soon began to wonder if Alan might be right. He talked to Dr. Sedwick, who wouldn't give him specific information, but did admit that her lab tech had just left town unexpectedly. Because of Alan's clues, Phillip told Rick he thinks Alex paid the lab tech to lie, though he doesn't know why. Alex wondered why Alan didn't accuse her in front of Phillip. Alan said that would be too easy, and that now, Phillip will simply dote on his new family. This will punish Alex by ruining her plans for Phillip to take over Spaulding Enterprises. Alex said Gus will never take Phillip's place in Alan's heart, but Alan wasn't so sure. At Rick's urging, Phillip went to see Olivia, though he wondered if maybe the baby didn't deserve better than him. Buzz and Beth reminisced about proms and loves past, and decided their lives were good, even without a partner. At the prom, Josh tried to tell Reva about Shayne's offer from the Cubs, but she was too distracted by the arrival of Gus and Jeffrey, and by her feelings that something was wrong with Marina. While Shayne, Reva, Frank, Gus, and Jeffrey searched for Marina, Ben tried to convince her he had done everything for her, but this angered Marina. She told him they had nothing to talk about, but he said he wouldn't let her go, not again. This confused her, but she finally agreed to leave with him so they could talk. She said she had to go back in and say goodbye to her dad and to Shayne, but at the mention of his name, Ben became furious, grabbing Marina and accusing her of sleeping with Shayne. Reva found them, and pulled them apart. Shayne, Lizzie, Frank, Gus, and Jeffrey arrived. Shayne and Ben started to fight, but Reva stopped them. Ben refused to talk to the police without a lawyer. Before leaving, he accused Lizzie of lying about Marina's feelings, but she denied it; she also denied that she set up the meeting between Ben and Marina. Gus and Jeffrey told Rick that Ben is once again a major suspect in the \"Garden of Eden\" murders."
