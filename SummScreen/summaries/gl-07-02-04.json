Phillip asks her when she's ever believed in anything.  She tells him she used to believe in true love but he taught her better.  Phillip leaves and a little later Bill arrives.\n\n\nAfter telling her about the ultimatum he gave his dad and uncle, he asks Olivia about her plans for the day.  Realizing that he's offering to spend the day with her, she suggests they go for drinks. Later, at the bar, Bill notices that someone's been following Olivia.  She tells him that's Phillip's spy.  She playfully suggests that they give him a show and starts flirting with and kissing Bill.  They then decide to go to his apartment.  After a drink there, and talk of partnerships, business or otherwise, they start kissing passionately.\n\n\nAt the Bauers', Ross sees Danny and tells him how much Robbie misses his mother. Tony overhears and suggests that Robbie come to the Barbecue but Danny refuses  Tony tries to convince Danny that Michelle has a right to know, but Danny is concerned that it would be too much for her and she might create a scene.  Having failed to convince Danny, Tony walks off and overhears Michelle telling Harley and Gus about her memory flash last night.  Upon spotting Tony, Michelle goes to talk to him and he tells her he heard her little speech and doesn't believe any of it.  She tries to deny that she's lying but he tells her that if her memory were really returning she'd be a little more excited about. The only reason everyone else buys it is because she's telling them what they want to hear.  He just wants the truth.   Michelle defends herself by saying that she just wants to give everyone hope. He asks her if the lie feels good.  Reva then sees the pair talking and ushers Michelle into the house.  She tells Michelle that she saw her apple pie (the one that Michelle made from scratch yesterday).  Michelle is forced to confess that she burned it, but Reva was prepared for something like this and brought a pie.  She then asks Michelle if she's really getting her memory back.  \n\n\nAt the Bauers', Gus notices that Darci's nervous and tells her to relax.  When Harley asks what they're talking about Gus just brushes it off.  Frank joins them and starts telling Gus that something is bugging him about the Salerno case.  Gus tries to get out of talking about it by mentioning that the case is closed, but Frank says the pieces just don't add up and something is off.  This piques Harley's interest since once Frank gets a feeling he's usually right.  Just then Darci and Gus quickly distract them from talking business.  Later, though, as he's grilling, Frank tells Gus that he's convinced Brad was working with someone at Spaulding. Gus accuses Frank of just jumping on the \"I hate the Spauldings bandwagon\" like his sister, but Frank maintains that he's a lot more objective than Harley.  Just then Gus spots Darci and Harley whispering and goes to see what they're talking about.  He's relieved to learn that they're just talking about the wedding.  When Harley leaves to get food, Darci confesses to Gus that she was tempted to reveal her secret.  She thinks she should just tell Frank the truth and trust that he won't bail on her.  Gus tries to dissuade her by telling her that the truth can sometimes be more damaging than a lie and he hopes she doesn't do anything she'll regret.  Across the yard, Harley spots the pair in deep conversation and wonders what's going on.  Later, Frank pulls Darci aside and asks her to marry him.  She tells him she'd love to marry him but first she needs to tell him something that could make him change his mind.    Cassie and Reva talk about her identify theft problem.  Reva suggests that Cassie talk to Jeffrey about it but Cassie declines.  Later, Jeffrey, who's come to the Barbecue to say his good byes, says goodbye to Reva. She then tells him about Cassie's problem.  He agrees to make some calls. Alone he makes one call, telling a mysterious person that someone is masquerading as Cassie Winslow and he better not find out it's her.\n\n\nDanny, Rick and Mel talk about how well Michelle's doing.  Danny thinks maybe she'll remember something today too but Rick and Mel are skeptical.  Danny suggests telling Michelle about Robbie today but neither Rick nor Mel think this is the right time.  A little later, Danny sees Tony, who isn't looking very happy with him.  Danny asks him if he has a problem with how he's handling Michelle and Tony says his problem is that Danny's handling Michelle.  Tony doesn't like the pressure Danny is putting on Michelle to get things back to normal. He thinks it's all for appearance sake.  Instead of everything being okay with Michelle, Danny just wants to make it look okay.  A little miffed, Danny blurts out that he just wants what's best for Michelle. Just then, Michelle comes up behind him and says that no on asked him to.  Tony starts to leave, but Michelle tells him she wants him there.  She then confronts Danny about never showing his real feelings around her.  She asks him to be real.  When she leaves, Tony again asks when Danny's going to tell her about Robbie. Danny hedges by saying soon. He then asks Tony to distract Michelle later when Robbie comes over.  Tony really doesn't want to because he thinks it's a big mistake but he agrees.  Later that day, Danny finds out Robbie's there and asks Tony to keep Michelle busy.  Tony's still put out about it since he thinks Danny should be honest with Michelle.  Just then Robbie comes running into the yard; spots Michelle and calls her Mommy!\n\n\n",

Robbie arrives and cries out \"mommy\" upon seeing Michelle. Gus is nervous about Darci knowing his secret. Frank tells Gus that he doesn't think the Spaulding-Salerno case is really wrapped up; he thinks Brad was working with someone else at Spaulding. Harley quizzes Gus about why he keeps talking to Darci about something. Frank proposes to Darci. She accepts but prepares to tell him the truth. Jeffrey shows up and people give him a hard time, except for Reva. Philip and Olivia argue again; he wants her to go with him to the barbecue, just to keep up appearances, but she refuses.
