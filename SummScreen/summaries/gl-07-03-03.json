Phillip told Alex he is more determined now than ever to build a family with Olivia. Marina told Shayne she had been accepted to Northwestern University, but knew she couldn't go, because her family could never afford it; she later told Frank she had decided to go to Springfield University. When Shayne told Josh he had decided to play professional baseball, Josh admitted he had already sent the contract, and Shayne had already been drafted to the Chicago Cubs. At first, Shayne was furious that Josh took the decision away from him, but soon gave in to his excitement over playing for the Cubs. Shayne told Reva about his decision, and she agreed to support him. When she found out about Josh's deception, however, she walked out, livid that he had broken her trust. She called Christopher to tell him that she agreed to participate in his three-week sequestered study. Speaking with Gus and Frank, Jeffrey introduced Detective Drummond, who had worked on the Bridget Waters case years ago. Drummond revealed that he had been communicating with the former coroner before his death. He said the coroner had found some bones he thought were related to Bridget's case, but he was killed before Drummond could get the full story. At Company, Tony told Bill, Marah, Remy and Ben that he wanted Ben to move out of the museum; they decided to vote on the matter."
