During the meeting, she opens up to some ladies and realizes she needs to get home to Josh. Afterwards, Reva makes Colin streak naked and he does it, but is mortified. He tells her later that her lab results look \"promising\". Tammy finds Alan's papers making Jonathan give up parental rights and tells Jonathan she doesn't want to live this way. Alan tells Coop that Lizzie made up the \"accident\" on the roof and Coop tells Lizzie goodbye. Lizzie is mad at Alan and at the Bauer's house, she tells him that she will prove to Coop that she is domestic and maternal. Alan, after trying to contact Jonathan on St. Gabriel, arranges for a jet to fly down and make Jonathan tow the line. Josh has a fight with Billy and tells him that he (Billy) may love Reva, but she will dump on Billy like she has dumped on him. He tells Billy and Cassie that Reva is now on her own."
