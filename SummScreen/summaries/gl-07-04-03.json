    "tvmega_recap": "All of Springfield planned for the annual Bauer Barbecue. Josh and Reva continued to argue, but agreed to a truce for the duration of the party. They both thought Marah and Tony were acting strange. Meanwhile, the duo prepared for their surprise wedding for Danny and Michelle. When the Justice of the Peace arrived early, they disguised him in an Uncle Sam costume, afraid someone would recognize him and ruin the surprise. When Marah put down one of her supply bags, a nosey Reva snuck a peak, and was alarmed to find a bride and groom cake topper. Phillip told Beth and Lizzie that Olivia's baby is his, but that they are split up, for now. Pretending to go home for her swimming suit, Lizzie instead went to see Olivia. She offered her assistance, saying she wanted to make amends for her past behavior. Olivia thanked her, and said she would call if she needed Lizzie. Both Beth and Gus thought Alan and Phillip should talk, so Gus brought Alan to the barbecue. Alan told Phillip he needed to realize that the problems he is now having are his own fault, not Alan's. Blake wanted Harley to help prove Ben's innocence, but Harley insisted that any new evidence she found would go to Gus, no matter who it incriminated. Rick told Harley about a strange bruise on Mrs. Hendon's neck, but wouldn't let her see the pictures. Gus asked Rick to keep Harley out of the investigation, because he is afraid the killer might come after anyone who is on to him, like he did with Rick's predecessor. Rick was irritated when Mel was called away to begin her new job with Jeffrey. Ed officially started the party by raising the flag."
