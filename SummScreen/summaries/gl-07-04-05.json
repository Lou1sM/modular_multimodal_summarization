A shocked Reva tries to console him, but he just brushes it off by saying he could care less. He says that he's happy she's dead d and Reva should be too since it was her abandonment of him that set the horrors of his and Marissa's life in motion. Reva is still shocked over Marissa's accident, and Jonathan implies that it was no accident. Suddenly, Nate arrives and lets himself in. When he asks what happened, Reva tells him about Jonathan's mother dying. As Nate tries to offer his sympathies and sweet talk Reva into letting him stay, Jonathan just stares intently at Nate. Finally, Jonathan asks Nate if he's going to ask how his mother died. Jonathan informs Nate and Reva that his mom was killed, he knows it. He knows it because his mother was afraid of the water. Reva asks if he thinks his father killed her. Jonathan tells her that he doesn't want to believe that, but the more he tries to talk himself out of that, the more Reva believes it. Reva makes plans to locate Alfred. Jonathan quickly tells her not to; he could just be jumping to conclusions. Nate agrees with Jonathan, but Reva is intent on finding Alfred and making him pay. Suddenly, Josh calls and Reva leaves the room. Alone with Nate, Jonathan asks if he has anything to hide regarding Marissa's death. Nate doesn't answer and states that he isn't leaving until he gets what he wants. \n\n\nHoled up in New York, Mallet informs Harley (who he's still cuffed to) that he learned that Frank arrived and arrested Gus. Harley figures out that Gus threw the police off her trail and is bent on turning herself in in order to save Gus Mallet tries to talk Harley out of it, trying to convince her that she needs to stick it out. She finally concedes when he asks her if Gus would want her to turn herself in. Suddenly, there's a knock at the door-it's Andrea Wallace who has read her brother's note. After telling her he'll take care of it--Mallet takes the note. He and Harley are both shocked when it names Alan as the shooter. At first, Harley can't believe it since it doesn't make any sense--why would Alan kill his own son? But Mallet points out that Phillip was becoming a monster and maybe Alan had to \"dispose of the problem.\" He theorizes that Alan was so intent on making Harley pay because he was afraid she's uncovered the truth. He points out that Alan is running scared which makes him very dangerous. They conclude that it's guilt and desperation that are driving Alan now. He's punishing everyone who drove Phillip (and himself) over the edge. Mallet unlocks Harley's cuffs and informs her that she's free to go. But Harley doesn't want to go without him. They decide they need to head back to Springfield and prove that Alan pulled the trigger. \n\n\nThe Bauer Barbecue is in danger of being rained out. Although it definitely looks like rain, Rick and Mel decided to wait it out and go on as scheduled. Danny asks Rick if he's heard anything from Michelle since she and Robbie were supposed to arrive today. Mel mistakes his concerns as an indication that he still has feelings for Michelle, which Marina overhears. While Danny and Rick go out to fire the grill, Mel literally bumps into Marina who is standing next to the kitchen door, listening. Mel knows that Marina heard everything she said and isn't apologetic. She believes that Danny and Michelle belong together although she doesn't want Marina to get hurt. At the same time, Danny is informing Rick that he doesn't want Michelle back and asks him to inform his wife of that. Later, Marina tries to talk about what will happen if Michelle shows up but they are interrupted by a surprise guest---Alan. Alan was invited by Rick and informs everyone that he's there to take Phillip's place since Phillip loved this holiday. Alex (there with Buzz) tries to talk Alan out of staying, but he's insistent. Suddenly, Frank arrives and informs everyone that he arrested Gus--and Gus alone. He then incurs Alan's wrath when he states that Gus asked to talk to Buzz, not him. Alan demands to know what Gus said to Frank, but Alex pulls him aside before he can get into an argument with Buzz. Alone, she tells Alan to let this go and warns him not to hurt anybody. He warns her not to make him. In the meantime, Frank has decided to stay a little at the barbecue since Gus is still being processed and Buzz can't see him right now anyway. While there, he gives Marina some advice regarding her \"testing\" Danny to see what would happen if Michelle arrived. Marina goes to apologize to Danny when suddenly, who runs through the door but Robbie! Meanwhile, outside with Zach (who is missing his mother), Buzz points out that the sun is starting to peek through the clouds.\n\n\n",
