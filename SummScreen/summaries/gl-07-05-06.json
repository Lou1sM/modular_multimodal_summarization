Harley wafts back and forth about Gus building the house without a contractor. Mallet and Dinah pitch in to help build the house as well. Mallet tells Gus that if he lets him help and they do a decent job together, maybe they can be partners again. Rick, who mistrusts Gus, has Mel draw up a custody amendment and gives to Harley, who refuses it and tells him to get out of her house. Later in the night, Frank, Coop, Mallet, Dinah all pitch in to help build the house. Rick comes back and Buzz tells Harley that Rick might be reconsidering what he said about not wanting Jude to stay with Harley and Gus. A storm rolls in and Harley and Gus try to place a tarp on the roof only to get caught in the storm. Later, after all have worked day and night, Harley and Gus kiss and she asks him to move in the house with her and the boys."
