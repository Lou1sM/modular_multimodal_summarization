    "tvmega_recap": "Phillip gives Olivia a hard time when she is at Spaulding picking up some files. They argue about why he hates her; he thinks that she slept with Bill. Bill meets with Josh, who asked him to come back to Lewis Construction. Bill agrees, which is part of his plan with Olivia. Olivia and Bill make out at Spaulding. She shows him a piece of paper she found that shows a piece of property and Phillip and Alan want to buy, so they plan to buy it first. She hopes to keep distract Phillip with her fooling around with Bill so he won't notice them trying to steal the company. Meanwhile, Alan has Shayne and Sandy put in jail for the night. The kids object. Sandy gets particularly upset about being fingerprinted. That makes Alan and Reva suspicious. Reva and Josh try to talk Alan out of it but he lets them know that he is only teaching the kids a lesson and will drop the charges tomorrow. Tony and Michelle return home, wet from swimming. Danny has a romantic dinner laid out. Michelle gets to know Robbie, which makes Danny happy. He thanks Tony for his help but suggests he move out. Tony almost tells him what he and Michelle talks about at Laurel Falls but they get interrupted. Later, Michelle lets Danny knows that she isn't happy that he lied to her about the mob and tried to protect her too much. They come to a sort of understanding, but he still doesn't tell her that he was responsible for her accident. They end up sleeping in the same bed with Robbie between them.",
