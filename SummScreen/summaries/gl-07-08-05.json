They try to pretend there is nothing between them but Ross is amused and tells them he knows they have feelings for one another. Lizzie asks Ross to speak to her mother about giving her a chance to do the right thing. Ross thinks it would be better coming from Lizzie. Coop agrees and cancels their plans until Lizzie has a chance to tell Beth about their relationship and gain her approval. Coop's phone rings and he discovers it is Harley. She asks him to make sure Company is closed for the night. Her life depends on it. He and Lizzie leave the restaurant to share a quiet evening alone in town. \n\n\nGus is in court for his bail hearing after being detained for helping Harley escape justice. Buzz arrives to offer his support but is interrupted by Alan, who overhears Gus thanking Buzz for being there for him. Alan makes sarcastic remarks about Gus turning to the Coopers again instead of his own father. Gus follows his lead and answers it probably would have been a good idea to go to Alan so he could pretend to help when all he really intends is to stab him in the back. Alan is grim and stalks away angrily. \n\n\nGus pleads with Buzz to help him stay out of jail because Harley needs him. Buzz offers his help but refuses Gus' request to fake a heart attack because he doesn't want to jinx himself. He offers to cover his bail with money held in trust for Harley's boys. Buzz reminds Gus the money is really from Alan since he is the one who set up the funds. Gus agrees to accept it as poetic justice. \n\n\nAlan is at the Bauer's hoping to spend time with Zack. Before he finds his grandson, he imagines being on trial and found guilty of murder. Rick arrives to find Alan agitated and nervous. When Alan requests to see Zack, Rick tells him he has gone to bed for the night. He tells Alan to wait and he will bring him a drink. Instead, he goes in to call Ross and asks him to come over and see if he can figure out what's wrong with Alan. Ross arrives later and guesses Alan is remembering Phillip and having a hard time with his death. Alan admits he misses his son but laments the fact that Zack lives in the same house with 'these people'. Rick rolls his eyes, but Ross reminds Alan that Zack is getting the best care possible from good people. Alan prepares to leave as a messenger delivers a note which says, 'The truth will come out. And so will the murderer. Nine p.m. Tonight. Where it all began.' \n\n\nAlan arrives at Company, breaks the window to get in, sits at a table and places a gun in front of him. \n\n\nAcross Springfield, Coop and Lizzie, Mel and Rick and Buzz receive notes with the message, 'History repeats itself tonight.' \n\n\n\n\n",
