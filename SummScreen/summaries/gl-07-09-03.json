Pop star Daniel Bedingfield, an old friend of Tony's, then performed for the bride and groom. Christopher arrived at the barbecue, and told Reva that he wanted her to go to a conference with him in Milan the next day. Josh was visibly irritated at the idea, and Reva thought he was rude. Josh asked what he could do to fix things between them; he apologized, but admitted he would do the same thing again if the situation presented itself. Reva said she couldn't get past that, and thought she should go to Milan after all. Danny promised both Ed and Michelle that his marriage would work this time. Danny and Michelle then shared their wedding night with champagne, dancing, and peanut butter cups. Harley told Gus that Mrs. Hendon's killer was wearing a signet ring, like Mitch Hendon's. She thought he may have tried to make it look like one of the serial killings. This would take suspicion off Ben, since he had no motive for the other killings. Holly found Ben unconscious underwater in the hot tub. When Ed and Rick pulled him out, they discovered a stab wound in his abdomen; it was made by an ice pick that Frank found in the bushes. Eden appeared just as Ben was being rushed to the hospital, and Gus was suspicious."
