But at the ceremony, Marie arrives (dressed to the nines, liberally spending the money Alex bribed her with) and when Alex tries to get rid of her, Frank observes their interaction. At the end of the day, careful to keep it from Harley, Frank decides to revive his investigation, and invites Alex down to the station for a little chat. \n\n\nCassie finds herself obsessing about the woman who's using her name all through Europe, and Edmund tries to get her to back off.

Edmund is disappointed that Cassie feels so down about her life but Cassie is quick to assure him she doesn't, she just wishes she knew who this woman really was. Meanwhile, Dinah, Cassie's imposter, is indeed living the high life in Europe, attending an opera. But Jeffrey O'Neill pays her an unexpected visit and tells her the time for playing games is over.\n\n\nBill and Tony, hard at work, take a break to hit on a nurse they meet at Company. At the same time, Michelle goes through her date book, finds an entry marked \"Company,\" and mistakenly believes she and Danny are entertaining that night.
