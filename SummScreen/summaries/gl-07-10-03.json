Reva denied Josh's accusations that she was running away by going to Milan. When Marah heard of Reva's trip, she decided to tag along, saying she could check on her handbag production. Tony was unhappy with her sudden trip, but Eden was secretly thrilled. Marina felt guilty for still having feelings for Ben, but Lizzie convinced her that her feelings were normal. Marina decided to visit Ben. Gus obtained a search warrant for Eden's apartment, and confiscated her scrapbook. Eden finally admitted that it was hers and not Marah's, but insisted it didn't contain any business information. Gus offered to trade it for her real business diary. Eden relented, and Gus found out that the first victim, former coroner Jed Simmons, had been a client of the second, Renee Peters. Ben began to awaken, and Frank asked who had attacked him. All that Ben remembered was watching the wedding from the bushes, then feeling hands on his neck from behind; he didn't remember being stabbed. Frank and Gus thought perhaps Ben was drugged, but determined from the angle of his wound that it may have been self-inflicted."
