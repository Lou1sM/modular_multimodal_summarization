Edmund is so angry that he throws her to the bed and chokes her for a moment, but releases her when she cries. She tells him it was a girl and explains how it happened. He seems sympathetic, so she goes on to tell him if they sleep together that night they could make a baby and be a family. He tells her he still wants to be with Cassie and walks out on her. \n\n\nCassie has tricked Jonathan into coming to talk to her at Reva's house. Assuming Jonathan was beaten by Edmund, she tells him she needs his help to get Edmund arrested for assault. Jonathan tells her Edmund didn't do it and he won't help. Not only that, when Cassie mentions the baby, Jonathan almost tells her there is no baby. Instead, he tells her she and Edmund do not deserve to be parents and that Dinah would be a much better parent than they would. \n\n\nLater, as Cassie leaves Reva's house, she walks out to find Edmund waiting for her on the porch bench. He has come to tell her about the baby, but as he talks with her, he finds he can't - instead he tells her that he wants to get back together! Cassie's phone rings and she leaves the room - just as she does, there is a knock on the door. Edmund answers it and is surprised to see Dinah. She pleads with him to try to have another baby and tells him she wants to be with him. Cassie calls for Edmund, and he convinces Dinah to put the maternity pad back on quickly. When Cassie opens the door and sees Dinah, she assumes something is wrong with the baby. Edmund lies and tells her everything is fine with the baby. \n\n\nSandy is enjoying a drink at the bar when a lovely young woman asks if she can buy him a drink. He agrees...just as Tammy enters. Tammy accuses him of trying to get back at her for their fight. He denies it and says it wasn't the fact that they fought; it was what the fight was about - Jonathan! She tells him she loves him and doesn't want to lose him, but Sandy just won't fight with her. He tells her maybe it's just as well as nothing got more serious between them, because now maybe they can just be friends. She is furious! But Sandy tells her it's okay, it's her feelings for Jonathan - not her - that are the problem, and until they go away, they can't be together. Later, Tammy watches Sandy and the young woman together when Jonathan comes and sits by the bar with her. Sandy leaves the woman to go home and stops long enough to threaten Jonathan if he hurts Tammy. \n\n\nAlan confesses right in front of Harley and Gus that he shot Phillip, even as he has a gun pointed at them. There is a shot - Harley checks to see if she's hit - but Mallet has shot into the air and warns Alan the next one will be for him if he doesn't put his gun down. Just as Alan starts to deny to Mallet that he has confessed, Beth, Lizzie, Rick and Olivia come out from behind the wall and tell Alan they heard it, too. But as Alan still tries to blame it on Harley they are all in disbelief. Lizzie is especially upset and tells Alan to look her in the face and tell her he didn't kill her father. He tries to talk to her, but she can see from his eyes that he is lying. Alan tells them all they cannot prove anything as there is no physical evidence linking him to the crime. Alexandra begs to differ, however, as she walks into the room. Harley and Gus demand to know what it is, and she tells them about the gloves. Alan is incensed! He is absolutely furious with Alex and calls her a traitor. He rants and raves about trying to do the best for his family and insists that Harley is to blame for all this. When Frank arrives, he is more than happy to arrest Alan for the murder of his own son. He also has to take Harley into custody, but not before Harley and Mallet share a longing look when she thanks him for his help. \n\n\nOutside of Company, Alan is waiting with two policemen. Frank tells them to take Alan in - he will take Harley in his car. Just as the policemen start to take Alan to the station, another policeman walks up to relieve the other two. It is Sebastian in disguise, and he escorts Alan off of Company's property. \n\n\n",
