It turns it he's right---Lizzie is on an airplane ready to take off with Sebastian. Though the plane was delayed all night due to repairs, it's now about ready for take-off and Sebastian wakes Lizzie who is clueless about Sebastian's motives. Lizzie doesn't stay clueless for long though when she overhears Sebastian making a call to Alan's cell phone stating that he's holding his granddaughter for ransom. Alone in the restroom she places a call to Coop who tells her to delay the take off until he arrives. Lizzie has no idea how to do that and Coop tells her to just be herself. Lizzie then exits the rest room, sullen looking and informs Sebastian that she's deathly afraid of flying. Sebastian doesn't really care, however, so Lizzie starts playing the little rich girl by demanding something to drink and insulting Sebastian. Sebastian's on to her plan though and states that it won't work--they're taking off. Suddenly, Lizzie states that she needs to do her yoga--otherwise she'll have an anxiety attack. When it seems as if she's about to have one, Sebastian gives her five minutes to do her yoga. When her time's up, Lizzie tries to bribe Sebastian into letting her go by enticing him with her Spaulding stock. But Sebastian isn't impressed since he knows she won't get it until she's 25, no matter what legal finagling she claims can be done. Finally, Coop arrives to save the day. Coop antagonize Sebastian by telling him about how awful of a prisoner Lizzie would be and Coop and Lizzie end up arguing. Fed up with Lizzie, Sebastian lets her go because she's \"not worth the aggravation.\" Later, outside Company, Lizzie is freaked out to learn that Sebastian was more dangerous than she thought. (Since he had killed a man) \n\n\nHarley's in court for her hearing. Even though they can't produce Phillip's true killer, both Gus and Jeffrey are able to convince the judge that Alan killed his own son by presenting the bloody gloves and having Alexandra testify as to what she knew. Although the judge is convinced, there's still the matter of Harley escaping from prison. Although both Gus and Mallet try to shoulder the blame for that, Harley won't let them. Luckily, the judge decides to drop all charges---Harley's a free woman. When the trial ends, Alex tries to apologize to Buzz for keeping quiet for so long but he's too hurt by her betrayal and walks away. Harley, meanwhile, shares a heartwarming goodbye with Mallet. \n\n\nThere's more good news for the Cooper family: Marina passed the police academy exam. While she and Danny are setting up Company for a celebration for Harley, Mallet walks in to say goodbye. He hears the news about Marina. While Marina goes into the kitchen, Danny asks Mallet if his past could make things difficult for Marina. Mallet honestly says yes it would; some officers would give her a hard time. He states that Marina would have to deal with the same things that Danny, as a former mobster, has to deal with. Danny doesn't think it's fair; Marina shouldn't be punished because of his past. Mallet, seeing that Danny is worried about hurting Marina's chances, points out that life is not fair and suggests that he just basically stick with it because he has something good. \n\n\nAlan's hiding out near the docks, and comes across two homeless men. Alan's in a little bit of a hurry since there is something he needs to take care of. He narrowly escapes being recognized when a police officer briefly arrives. Later, Alan bribes one of the men to inform everyone that he saw Alan take a bus out of town. While Alan is bribing one man, the second man sneaks out. That second man, Shorty, is obviously an old contact of Gus's and he goes to the courthouse to tell Gus he saw his old man. \n\n\nAlan's is now in a building and asks a doctor to let him into a room. Inside, seated at a table, is Phillip! \n\n\n\n",
