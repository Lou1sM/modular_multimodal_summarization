The town was thrilled when Shayne's team won the game. Marina told Shayne she was so sorry she wasted so much time on Ben, when she could have been with him. Lizzie visited Ben and told him that she didn't care if he was a bad guy, as long as he got Marina out of her way. Cassie checked up on Tammy's date's past. She discovered that he had recently picked up his grades, and was volunteering at a youth center. Though he teased Cassie for overreacting, Edmund made it clear to the boy that he would have to answer to him if he hurt Tammy. Cassie kissed Edmund as they stargazed, and thanked him for bringing her back to life. Frank and Gus theorized that Ben may have killed Jed Simmons and the two escorts over Simmons's suspicions of Ben. They also thought that Mitch Hendon killed his wife and tried to pin it on Ben for revenge, but, when Ben was not charged, he tried to take care of Ben himself. Jeffrey said they had no proof, and told them that two weeks before his death, Simmons filed suit for blackmail against Eden. He said this made her a more viable suspect than Ben or Mitch. Meanwhile, Eden told Tony that some people don't understand their way of life. Tony agreed, saying Marah was one of those people."
