When RJ tried to hit Will with a plastic bat, Edmund reminded him how lucky he was to have a brother; RJ promised to be good, and later told Cassie that he liked Uncle Edmund. After Cassie lamented never doing any of the planned renovations to the Jessup farm, Edmund had the plans brought to him. Holly told Ben he could stay with her after his release from the hospital, then gave him the news that his maternal grandmother has had a stroke. Ben told Bill, Michelle, and Holly that he wanted out of the hospital. When Ben told Bill that Eden had been at the barbecue after Michelle and Danny's wedding, Bill asked Eden why she had lied to him. She tried to distract him with sex, but he said that wouldn't work anymore. Tony worried that Eden was getting too close to him, but she acted offended, and insisted she wasn't hitting on him. Tony told Michelle that he was afraid he had led Eden on, so Michelle said maybe he should stay away from Eden for a while. Gus and Frank interrogated Mitch, who couldn't account for some time the night of his wife's death, or remember his whereabouts the night of Ben's attack. He admitted to nothing when Gus showed him the ring that was found in the Bauer hot tub. Gus decided he needed to question Eden again."
