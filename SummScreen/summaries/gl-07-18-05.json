Gus and Harley arrive and tell Frank that Gus received a tip Alan was seen at the docks near an abandoned office building. Harley convinces Mallet to accompany them in their search for Alan. \n\n\nAlan is preparing to enter a room in a deserted corridor when a woman approaches and tells him she has seen the morning paper. Alan cuts her off by saying 'Don't believe everything you read, doctor.' The doctor unlocks a door. Alan enters and greets Phillip, who is seated behind an executive desk reading some papers. He approaches his son with caution and tells him he is looking well. Phillip ignores the remark and tells his dad he's glad to see him because he's having some trouble with a property on the east side. Alan tells his son that whatever the problem is, he is sure he can handle it. He tells Phillip the time has come to hand over the reins of Spaulding because he has to leave and may not return for a while. Phillip appears lucid and asks if the children are okay. Alan assures him the kids are fine and shaping into perfect little Spauldings. He says goodbye and prepares to leave since Phillip has a 'board meeting.' He watches from the door as two orderlies enter the room and Phillip emerges from behind the desk wearing pajama bottoms beneath his shirt and tie. \n\n\nIn the hallway, Alan leans against the door and promises he will always keep Phillip safe. He's interrupted by Harley and Gus who tell him not to run. Alan runs but is blindsided by Frank who slams him against the wall and handcuffs him. Later in the courtroom, Harley taunts Alan with a life behind bars the way he intended it to be for her. Alan sneers at her and Gus, telling them they think they know so much but they know nothing. They will never pin a murder charge on him. Harley wants to stay and watch Alan being led away to jail but Gus convinces her they should leave. He takes her to her house and tells her they are finally home. \n\n\n",
