Lizzie asks Tammy about Jonathan and Tammy tells her that Jonathan will come around. Reva has the chemo and afterwards, phones Jonathan and asks him to be with Josh today (it is their anniversary). Cassie goes to Jeffrey's room and they kiss. Josh sees her as she leaves Jeffrey's room and looks bothered. Alan continues to eavesdrop on Tammy, Jonathan and Lizzie's conversations. Billy, who dodged a bullet at the bar by not drinking, goes to be with Reva. Colin tells Billy that he needs to get a bone marrow donor list for Reva. Reva tells Billy to remember not to tell anyone about her illness. Billy finally makes the decision to call the family. As he watches Reva through her hospital window he says, \"Sorry darlin'. This is a no brainer. I will do what it takes to save your life\"."
