She tells the party that some drunken guys were trying to get her into their car. Danny asks for the names of the guys. Lizzie tells Danny she didn't recognize them, but they said something about going to the park. Joey tells Tammy he should take Lizzie home. \n\n\nAt the mansion, Lizzie tells Joey she's sorry she ruined their date. He quickly reminds her it wasn't a date. Lizzie asks Joey to dance, and she kisses him. Stunned, Joey tells Lizzie this isn't what he wants. She accuses him of still being in love with Tammy. She shows him the video from the beach of Tammy's venting about his bad habits. Lizzie apologizes to Joey for breaking his heart. Upset, Joey leaves, but not before planting a kiss on Lizzie as he walks out the door. A thrilled Lizzie tells Beth she just had the best night of her life. \n\n\nTammy tells Sandy she doesn't believe Lizzie's story. She vows to win Joey back, while Sandy tells Tammy any guy would kill to be with her. \n\n\nDanny heads to the park and finds two drunken teenage boys.

The boys swear they haven't been to a party, and a confused Danny lets them go. \n\n\nThe police have Tony's club surrounded. Michelle lurks in the shadows, and calls Tony to warn him. The cops enter the club, but all they find is Tony looking over his books. They warn Tony they will be back. Once the coast is clear, he tells Michelle to stay out of his business. She asks Tony if he ever tried to go straight. Tony says yes, but it didn't work. Back at the house, Michelle apologizes to Danny for running out of the party. He gives her the cold shoulder. Michelle asks him what mob life was like. Danny tells his wife he was born into that life and hurt a lot of people. He thanks God everyday that part of his life is over. Michelle asks about Tony's criminal life, and Danny says he tried to get out, but he liked the excitement too much. \n\n\nAt the station, Ross tells Frank the file connecting Darci to the mob was found in his briefcase.

Ross suggests Frank take a couple of days off and appoints Gus as Chief of Police. Harley asks Gus who would frame her brother. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Alex is having a heart-to-heart talk with Buzz about her past coming back to haunt her. Buzz tells Alex that Frank is just doing his job, and his son is the most honest man he has ever known. Gus calls Alex, but she sees the name on the caller i.d. and ignores the call.
