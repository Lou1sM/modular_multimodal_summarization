Dinah gets Harley to go with her to a crazed half- price sale of wedding gowns. In the hustle and bustle of the venue, a woman grabs Dinah's dream dress. Dinah finds out that she is allergic to all types of live flowers and cannot make a decision on the floral arrangements.

At the police station, Blake arrives and tells her that she got the charges dropped. Dinah runs into the woman who grabbed her wedding dress and is able to get the dress back.

What else are they hiding?\" He then finds pictures of Dinah and Gus on a bed, kissing."
