    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Beacon lobby, a bent rose from an admirer is delivered to Olivia. She is sure it is from Phillip, who happens to be on the other side of the lobby making a call on his cell phone. She runs over and tells him to grab onto the thorns, and squeeze really good and tight. Phillip ignores Olivia, and asks her for any news from Bill Lewis. When she replies Bill is giving her the cold shoulder, he tells her he doesn't want any excuses and to just get it done. Flabbergasted, Olivia leaves the desk as Jeffrey approaches. He has just returned from Europe. He opens a bottle of pills and reviews a file on Dinah. Back in Europe, Dinah's phone rings. It's Jeffrey. As she holds on to Cassie's credit card and compliments Jeffrey on their wonderful evening together the other night, he informs Dinah it's NOT a social call. Meanwhile, Cassie calls on the phony credit card account she kept open to track her imposter. While she is calling to check on the card's recent activity, she sees the words \"Princess Cassie, Woman of Mystery\" on the cover of a magazine. And then, a similar headline on ANOTHER magazine... \n\n\nOn the phone, Gus can't find Alexandra...it appears she has run off to a spa. When Harley comes in and inquires about to whom he was talking, Gus lies and says it was the station. Gus reminds her he is now the acting chief of police. Eliza the caterer arrives. \"Mrs. Spaulding\" has made a change in the menu as of this morning. Gus figures out Eliza actually spoke to Alex today. He demands to know where she is. Meanwhile, at the Spaulding mansion, Alex intercepts Gus' call. It seems she is hiding from him. Alex then makes a call to Fritz. She asks that one million dollars be transferred to a private account in Missouri, and to deposit it in the names of Brad Green and Frank Cooper... \n\n\nHarley is very bothered by Alex's interference. Gus and she discuss possibly putting the wedding on hold to help Frank. Ross calls Frank to a meeting at the station. Frank maintains his innocence regarding the file found in his briefcase. Ross tells him that as Darci could have been his motive, perhaps he could've experienced a moment of weakness to protect the woman he loves. \n\n\nJeffrey reminds Dinah that her freedom will be short-lived if she continues to impersonate Cassie. She agrees, on the condition Jeffrey confesses to dreaming about her. He hangs up on her. \n\n\nCassie combs the royalty magazines for perhaps a picture of the woman impersonating her. RJ asks her to tell him a story. Cassie tells a tale of a little boy who lived on a farm, and how a princess appeared with wonderful stories and luxuries. RJ notices \"the princess\" is in one of the magazines. Cassie views the photo, and sees \"the princess\" has her back to the camera. \"Who is it?\" Cassie wonders... At that moment, Edmund interrupts the moment with ice cream. \n\n\nJeffrey pounds his keyboard as he sips water with the pills, and recalls finding the dirty, ragged and imprisoned Dinah. He recalls how he told her he could pass her off as royalty. Dinah had his full attention. Jeffrey is brought back to the present when Edmund approaches him, and asks about the woman who is impersonating Cassie... \n\n\nOlivia arrives at Bill's. He is redecorating. Olivia reminds him they can work well together. Bill continues to resist her. \n\n\nRoss advises Frank the \"Darci defense\" could get him out of it. Frank once again proclaims his innocence. Harley arrives and points a finger at \"a Spaulding\" as the guilty party... Harley believes Marie lied. Frank demands Harley stay out of it. Harley wonders if Brad Green, in the moments before his death, uttered the words \"god free\" to name his accomplice... Frank and Harley discuss the possibility of Gus finding out his family is behind everything. Ross announces the iron clad case against Frank. Ross makes Frank's suspension permanent.\n\n\nGus finds Alex at the mansion. He out right accuses her of framing Frank. She denies it, as if to be a helpless victim. She tells him that turning her in would be a big mistake. Marry Harley, and in one year, all of this will be long forgotten. Gus points out to Mrs. \"god free\" that Frank could lose everything. He announces he is done with Alexandra. She turns the tables on Gus, and tells him to tell Harley they are co-conspirators. \n\n\nOlivia ignores Bill's insistence that she leave his apartment, and prepares to help him redecorate. Phillip calls Olivia, and reiterates that she come through for him. Bill's resistance and Olivia's begging, mixed with Phillip's orders, is hilarious. Bill almost gives in to Olivia's advances, but all is interrupted when Bill's foot slips into the can of paint.\n\n\nJeffrey tells Edmund there are no updates on Cassie's case, and how it is not his only case. He tells Edmund Interpol is about to make an arrest. In Cassie's forgotten purse, they discover the magazines... \n\n\nAlex demands Gus tell Harley the truth. She tells him maybe Harley will forgive him. Phillip walks in on them. Gus leaves to have a talk with Harley, leaving Alex and Phillip standing there... \n\n\nIn another flash back, Jeffrey coaches Dinah on how to be royalty. She wonders what type of princess she will be. Jeffrey tells her she will impersonate Princess Cassandra Winslow, a.k.a Cassie Layne. Dinah freaks as she says, \"You mean Cassie fell in love and became a princess, while I am in here?\" The old hate and rivalry Dinah felt for Cassie all those years ago returned in her eyes... Back in the present, Dinah reads Cassie owns the Beacon. She pulls out a creepy scrap book containing news clippings and pictures of Cassie... \n\n\nCassie admits to Edmund she kept one credit card. Edmund tells her there must be something missing in her life in Springfield. Cassie admits it's true... \n\n\nHarley learns of the bank account set up in Frank's name. Gus advises Harley he has something to tell her... \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Phillip tells Olivia to get results where Bill is concerned. Jeffery once again calls Dinah and warns her to stop impersonating Princess Cassie. Alex transfers a million to a Swiss bank account with both Frank and Brad Green's name on it and Ross find out. Frank has to turn over his badge and gun. Gus yells at Alex for setting up Frank. Olivia goes to Bill's house to try and get closer to him.",
