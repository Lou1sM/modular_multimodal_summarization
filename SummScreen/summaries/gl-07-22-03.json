    "tvmega_recap": "Mitch Hendon jumped from the roof of The Beacon and pulled Cassie with him. Jeffrey grabbed Cassie just in time before she went over the edge with Mitch. Tony tried to convince Eden that they should establish an alibi for her so the police can find the real killer. Eden said she was tired and didn't feel like proving anything. Harley found Marina's acceptance letter to Northwestern. Marina told Harley not to say anything to Frank because she knows they can't afford it. Bill shows up at Eden's apartment as she is fondling her Tony scrapbook and tells her he is going to spend the night. At The Beacon, Cassie and Jeffrey have a moment after he saves her life. Edmond comforts Cassie and commiserates that too bad it had to be Jeffrey that saved her life, but the important thing is that she was saved at all. Jeffrey made another cryptic phone call to say that there had been a change in plans. Federal agents showed up at The Beacon to take over the Hendon case after he survived the fall from the roof. Outside, an agent calls Jeffrey \"Colonel\", to which Jeffrey bristles and says be careful, they are in an un-secure location. Shane and Marina make plans for a romantic camping getaway."
