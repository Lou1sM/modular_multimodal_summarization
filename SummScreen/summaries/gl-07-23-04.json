There dinner plans gone, Michelle suggests they see Tony, a suggestion that makes Danny visibly uncomfortable. Michelle correctly guesses that they had a fight, but Danny tries to blow it off.\n\n\nRay enters Tony's office, wondering why Tony called him. Tony tells him that he had a dream he didn't like and needs guidance.  Upon hearing that the dream was about a woman, Ray doesn't see the problem but is slightly startled when Tony ways it was about Michelle. But he shrugs it off telling Tony that the dream might not mean anything.  He says it could simply be that Tony is uncertain about Michelle and he wants to protect her.  They talk a little about Michelle.  Ray states his doubts about Michelle going back to being the person that she was.  He tells Tony they need to help her along  and deal with who she is now.  Just then Michelle and Danny walk in.  When they enter, Ray leaves.  Michelle tells Tony they need to have something settled.  She wants to talk about the argument he had with Danny.  But like Danny did, Tony shrugs it off telling her they're always fighting.   Satisfied, Michelle shows him the real reason she came--to show him her tattoo.  As Tony admires it from a distance, an excited Michelle starts telling the guys about her experience.  She then tells Tony that she has him to thank since he was her inspiration.  Things are starting to get too hot for Tony and he tells Michelle and Danny to leave since he's busy.  Outside, Michelle apologizes to Danny for dragging him out there, but states that it was important for her to show Tony since he's the only one who gets her, aside from Danny.  Danny tells her that understands completely. Impressed by his ability to say the right thing, Michelle kisses him--while Tony watches from inside.\n\n\nAfter their plane ride, in which Edmund presented Cassie with her choice of evening gown, Cassie and Edmund arrive at the charity auction in Venice.  Cassie thanks Edmund for making her feel like a princess and not thinking she's crazy. Edmund accepts her thanks and tells her that it's customary for them to be announced when they enter.  But Cassie doesn't want to do that since it might alert the imposter.  They step out on the balcony.  As they're outside, Dinah enters the ballroom and is announced as \"Princess Cassandra Winslow.\"  When Cassie, who hasn't heard anything because she's outside, enters the ballroom, Dinah's back is directly toward her so neither woman get a look at the other.  Later, Edmund spots this exquisite dagger that is being auctioned off--it's from the Shakespearean period.  He admires it and so Cassie suggest that he bid on it.  But he says it's too rich for him.  Secretly, Cassie puts in a bid.  A little later, Dinah also admires the dagger.  It turns out, Cassie loses the bid--by a lot.  Curious, she asks the hostess who won the bid, the hostess points out Dinah, whose back is turned again. Cassie goes to talk to her, but Dinah slips out before Cassie can get to her.  Later, Cassie is shocked to learn that the winning bid came from \"Princess Cassandra Winslow\", while Dinah admires her new acquisition and wonders of it ever drew blood.\n\n\nThe Spauldings and Coopers are getting ready for the engagement party. Phillip pressures Olivia to go with him, even though she doesn't want to.  Buzz tells Alex that Frank has suspicions about her.  Alex assures Buzz that she knows nothing and he believes her; he actually thinks it was Salerno who set Frank up.  Meanwhile, at Company, Frank is upset\n\n\nbecause he hasn't been able to get a hold of Ross all day.  At Harley's, Gus is complaining about the stuff in the papers about Frank and tells Harley that he won't rest until Frank's exonerated.  But Harley just wants to put all that behind them for tonight.  Gus is assuring her that her family means just as much to him as his own and he wants to help Frank.  He tells her that he feels guilty about getting Frank's job, but she assures him that he has nothing to be guilty about.  Just then the phone rings.  It's Darci warning Harley that Frank is stressed out. Just then Frank (who's obviously had a few beers) gets on the line and tries to put on a brave front by saying that he's fine.\n\n\nEveryone's at Company now.  Frank can't stop staring at Alex and goes to get another beer.  But Buzz is behind the bar and refuses to give Frank one since he's had enough.  He tells Frank that the evening is about Harley and he won't let him ruin it.  Across the room, Gus quietly asks \"Mrs. Godfrey\" how she is.  Alex tells Gus that she thinks he did the right thing by not telling Harley.  She's still concerned about how long he'll keep the truth from her.  Gus assures Alex that he'll continue to lie but warns her that he does have limits.  \n\n\nLater at Company, Phillip comments to Olivia about how happy Gus and Harley look.  It's clear that Olivia's not happy and Phillip suggests that she simply accept her situation.  Olivia asks if he misses having something real.  He simply tells her that he had that  with Beth and Harley. Olivia asks if they shouldn't be pushing for that instead of what they have, but Phillip tells her they've both had their chances.  A little later the pair, who've been isolating themselves in the back all night, both decide to leave.  Outside Olivia notes that she's amazed they actually agreed on something without harsh words and attitude.\n\n\nBack in the party, Harley's trying to comfort Frank, but he still keeps insisting that he's fine. But she's not buying it.  She thinks he's a time bomb with a smoldering fuse.  She tells him she wishes Brad Green had named his accomplice or said something more substantial than \"God free\" before he died.  Frank remarks that death beds aren't the only places to drag out a confession, a comment that startles Harley, but Frank tells her to just forget about it.  Buzz then gives a toast to Gus and Harley, building up Gus by calling him a man of integrity and truth. Right after, Alan gives a toast and tells Harley that he'll be proud to have her as his daughter-in-law and have his family associated with hers.  After  Alex demurs from speaking, Frank steps up.  He starts to give a very heavy handed speech, which is layered in hostility, and is escorted out by Buzz.  Gus follows him out and tells Frank that everyone is sick about what happened to him, while Buzz urges Frank to put his problem to rest until after the wedding.  Inside, in an effort to deflect from what just happened, Darci toasts Harley and then inadvertently calls Alexandra \"Mrs. Godfrey\"! \n\n\n",
