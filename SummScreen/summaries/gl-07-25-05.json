Lizzie is nervous as Coop turns on the charm and scrambles away from him for some breathing room. Coop guesses she is nervous about going all the way and asks if this will be her first time. Lizzie prattles on unconvincingly about her past 'experiences' and assures him that while she is not a 'ho-bag or anything' she knows what she is doing. Coop recognizes that she is not telling the truth and that she is a virgin which embarrasses her so that she locks herself in the closet. \n\n\nSince she refuses to come out, Coop tells her through the door that she is beautiful and he is happy she chose him because he has chosen her, too. Lizzie is moved by his admission and opens the door and jumps into his arms. They resume their passion only to be interrupted by Gus who is there to inform Lizzie that he is the new head of Spaulding. He surprises them by saying he agrees with their relationship and has arranged with Rick for Lizzie to occupy the Bauer garage apartment so the two won't have to sneak around anymore. \n\n\nEdmund and Dinah arrive at Company unaware that Cassie is to have a surprise baby shower. Dinah complains about the huge belly and her desire to be rid of it to the shocked ears of Blake, Tammy and Mel who are listening in the hallway. When Cassie and Jeffrey arrive the women reveal themselves and demand that Dinah tell Cassie the truth about Dinah's pregnancy. As Edmund and Dinah search for words to defend themselves, Tammy chimes in that Dinah hates being pregnant. Edmund is relieved that the truth is still a secret. He leaves the party after telling Cassie she looks beautiful. Outside, Jeffrey warns Edmund that he is playing with fire if he is manipulating Dinah into believing he cares about her. He reminds him that Hart is the last man Dinah was crazy about and Hart is now six feet under. \n\n\nInside, Dinah grows increasingly uncomfortable as Cassie shines the spotlight on her and thanks her for carrying her baby. Dinah accepts the praise but rushes outside. Once away from the party, she tells Edmund that if he doesn't tell Cassie the truth, she will. No one - not even Cassie - deserves what they are doing. Edmund appeases Dinah by hugging her but stares menacingly over her shoulder. \n\n\nAlan has been processed and led to a cell where he demands to make a phone call. He calls the doctor in charge of Phillip and is barely able to speak before the doctor tells him that she needs payment for Phillip's care. Alan becomes angry and tells her he has no access to his money but will have it for her soon. He demands to speak to his son. Gus arrives and snatches the phone saying 'your son is right here.' Alan thinks Gus is there to help him but is quickly disappointed when Gus says he is only to inform him that he has taken over as the head of Spaulding. Alan is desperate when Gus announces that all of his accounts will be frozen. He begs Gus to reconsider as he is his father. Harley arrives in time to hear Gus tell his dad he will be in jail for a very long time for killing Phillip. \n\n\nAlan unravels and shouts that Phillip is still alive. Harley is momentarily shocked but recovers as Gus makes jokes about already knowing this as he has seen Phillip at the gas station complaining about gas prices. Alan is not amused and re-states his claim that Phillip is alive. Harley remains unconvinced until Alan warns her that if Phillip is released, he will come after her and finish the job he started. Gus ushers Harley away from the cell since Alan is crazy. He kisses her goodbye in the hallway and leaves to take care of family business. Harley returns to Alan's cell and offers to help Alan to get out of jail if he will take her to Phillip. He agrees.  \n\n\n",
