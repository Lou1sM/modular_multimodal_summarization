Later, she visits Tammy in the hospital and realizes that Jonathan didn't tell Tammy the real reason he had to leave town. She selflessly spares Tammy. Colin tells Billy that if Reva doesn't receive the bone marrow, things will be bad. Jonathan arrives and Reva is happy to see him. She becomes delirious and thinks she is talking to Jonathan as a little boy. Present-day Jonathan remembers the day in question years ago. Later, Jonathan finds out that he is a match and undergoes the operation. After Reva gets the bone marrow, Jonathan makes her promise that she will fight to live. They both realize they are mother and son by choice. He tells her that he remembers that day when she talked to him as a little boy. He also tells her that when he awoke from the surgery, he realized he needed to be a parent for his child. After he goes back to Springfield, he finds Lizzie at the Spaulding mansion. Again, Lizzie selflessly tells him that she knows he and Tammy need their space. He tells her no that she will live with them as long as she is carrying his baby. Lizzie is elated and they leave together for their home."
