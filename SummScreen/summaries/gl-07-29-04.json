Gus tells Harley to hurry up and get over to the mansion, so they can get the wedding under way. After hanging up with Gus, Harley is greeted by the arrival of Blake and Marina. They came to help Harley get ready. Blake picks up on the fact that Harley has more than pre wedding jitters. She tells Blake it's due to the Brad Green scenario. When Gus can't find his cuff links, Phillip lends him some which had belonged to their grandfather. Alex and Alan enter, offering to help Gus get ready. Gus asks them what they know about trust. \n\n\nBearing gifts for the bride and groom, Olivia and Bill bump into each other. After talking with Buzz, Harley figures out Alexandra and he did not break up after all. Reva and Cassie also arrive to help Harley get ready. After Marina brings the wedding dress in, it's time for something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. Cassie provides something new, a pin from Venice, so she and Gus will have smooth sailing the rest of their lives. Marina provides something blue, a garter. Frank and Darci arrive at Company. Frank hasn't slept all night. He vows one more day, and he is going after the Spauldings. At the mansion, Alex tells Gus he is in this as deeply as she. Gus wonders if there's a way to protect Frank and them at the same time. Blake provides something old, some jewelry which belonged to Holly. Marina re-iterates that Frank was set up. She further announces Frank would never commit a crime, not even to protect Darci. All eyes fall on Marina. \n\n\nDinah arrives at the Beacon in disguise. A hotel clerk greets her, asking if she needs assistance. Dinah goes on to say how much she admires the hotel. The clerk points out the owners of the Beacon to Dinah, Olivia and Bill. Dinah lights up when she sees her brother. Meanwhile, Olivia touches Bill's face. She gets a call from Phillip at that moment. She pretends to have a bad connection on her cell phone. Phillip vows their truce will end if Olivia doesn't cooperate. As Bill goes to get his car from the valet, Olivia tells him to save her a dance. Dinah approaches Olivia, and asks why do all the good ones get away? Olivia asks if they have met. Dinah introduces herself to Olivia as Dee. Dinah says she knows Olivia's name as being in partnership with Princess Cassie Winslow. Olivia summons Bill over to meet Dee, but to their surprise, Dee has vanished. \n\n\nPhillip asks Frank to focus on what's important, which is Harley's wedding to Gus. Gus arrives and tells Frank he owes him. Gus asks Buzz to keep Frank out of trouble until tonight, as he has to go and take care of something. \n\n\nThe ladies attempt to apologize to Darci for Marina's remark. Darci provides something borrowed, a bracelet Frank gave her. Reva declares it's time to get into hair and make up. Darci unexpectedly announces she has to leave for a moment. Alone outside Company, she says she \"did this to Frank.\" \n\n\nJeffrey arrives at Company, much to the ladies' displeasure. It turns out Harley called him. She asks him for a favor today, or there won't be a wedding. Harley declares she has information. Jeffrey gives Harley a wedding gift, tickets to the dog show. She officially invites him to join the wedding. Jeffrey tells Harley he is not going to deal with her problem until after the honeymoon. Harley pleads she is withholding evidence, but Jeffrey does not want to hear it. As Harley appears all ready in her wedding dress, Phillip asks for a moment with his ex wife. Reva, Cassie and Blake leave them alone for a minute. Phillip and Harley discuss old times. He fears that unless she forgives the Spauldings, she may not be able to go on trusting Gus. \n\n\nDuring a toast proposed by Alan, it is discovered the champagne is bad. Alex, Buzz and Frank look on it as a bad omen. Meanwhile, Gus goes to the police station and arranges a private meeting with Vinnie Salerno! Gus tells Vinnie he has information which implicates him in the death of Eden. He tells Vinnie it could result in the death penalty. Vinnie asks what his alternative is. Gus tells him to confess to framing Frank Cooper. Vinnie tells Gus to go after the real culprits. Gus calls in the guard to have Vinnie taken back to his cell. His plan has backfired. \n\n\nDarci tries to tell Frank something. They are interrupted by Alan, who announces all of the champagne has turned to vinegar. Frank volunteers to go to the Beacon wine cellar to get more champagne. When Frank arrives at the wine cellar he notices the surveillance camera. He views a surveillance tape from the night of the San Cristobel festival. Frank sees the meeting between Gus and Alexandra: she is the pipeline between Antimonius and the mob! Frank sees the entire show down between Alex, Gus and Alan that night. \n\n\nAs Alexandra and Alan await Gus and Frank's arrival, Alan implies to Phillip that perhaps he would like to marry Beth again. \"Been there, done that,\" he replies. Phillip sees Olivia walk in. He begins to question her about Bill and demands a word with her. Olivia says she will talk to him after the wedding. Meanwhile, Gus arrives and tells Alan he cannot go on with this lie. Alan pulls Gus aside, and tells him this is what makes it all worthwhile. Gus gets ready to approach Harley. \n\n\n",
