When Sandy accuses Jonathan of worming his way in, Tammy defends Jonathan and admits that she let him in. Sandy gets angry and shoves Jonathan against the wall and tells him that he's not going to disturb their lives.  He tells Jonathan that Tammy chose him (Sandy); Jonathan doesn't get everything he wants.  Hurt, Jonathan walks out.  Alone with Tammy, Sandy tries to comfort her by telling her that Jonathan won't be a problem anymore; he made sure of that.  Sandy tells Tammy that he was the one who turned Jonathan in to the police.  Tammy is shocked and upset.  She tells him that it wasn't his place to do that, but he defends his decision stating that he did what no one else in the Lewis family would be able to do.  Sandy seems upset with Tammy's attitude and asks why she keeps letting Jonathan into her life.  An upset Tammy insists that she's not letting him get to her anymore.  Sandy assures Tammy that he did what he did for her.  Jonathan will be arrested and will never bother her again.  \n\n\nA sullen Jonathan is now skulking when Nate approaches him asking where the money is.  Jonathan refuses to give it to him and so Nate brings up Tammy and Jonathan's feelings toward her.  After belittling Jonathan by calling him a stray mutt who doesn't have a chance with Tammy, Nate departs.  Suddenly, Jonathan finds himself face to face with Tammy.  Tammy admits that she's been looking for him and offers to help him return the money.  That just makes Jonathan upset and he demands to know what she wants from him.  He grabs her and tells her just to hate it--it'd make things so much easier.  She tells Jonathan that she could never hate him and tells him that it was Sandy who turned him in.  Jonathan understands why Sandy did it--to protect her for him--and he walks away. \n\n\nFrank stops over at the Lewis house to ask Josh some questions about Reva and Nate's relationship.  Franks states that witnesses have reported that they were \"an item.\"  Josh doesn't know anything about that and goes into the house to talk to his wife.  Reva's upset because she can't reach Jonathan. Josh picks this time to ask her if she slept with Nate.  Josh tells her that he and Nate were seen kissing on more than one occasion and were apparently \"an item\"  Reva admits to the kissing but insists that they never slept together.  She admits that she and Nate flirted but that's it.  She goes on to say that they could have ended up sleeping together but then she found out he was Alfred.  That doesn't make Josh too happy since now he thinks that was her only reason for not sleeping with him.  Reva tries to reiterate that she never betrayed him, but Josh isn't satisfied.  He maintains that she can be selfish sometimes and wonders what kind of excuses she fed herself to make her rationalize her behavior toward Nate.  Josh tells her that he's getting tired of not being enough for her.  Reva tries to tell him that he is but he doesn't believe it and walks out.  Later, alone, Reva finds a receipt for a boat rental the date that Marissa was killed.  After calling the company to get information, she discovers that Alfred Randall has reserved the boat for a future date.   Reva realizes that Nate's going to kill Jonathan.  Just then, Josh returns but Reva's too upset about what she thinks Nate's going to do to talk to him.  Josh accuses her of shutting him out.  He suggests that maybe they need some time apart.  Focusing on Nate, Reva calls him and tries to lure him to the house by telling him that Jonathan's ready to hand over the money. Meanwhile, Josh tells Billy he needs to hire a private detective to keep an eye on  Reva.    \n\n\nThe Coopers are having an engagement party for Harley and Gus at Company.  Also in attendance is Lizzie, though Beth is trying to convince her to leave and come home with her.  She tries to talk Lizzie out of moving in to the Bauer's, but Lizzie's is bent on doing it.  \n\n\nHaving been spurned by Lizzie, Beth visits Alan in jail at his request.  Alan tries to convince Beth that Phillip is alive and he did what he did for the greater good, but she doesn't believe a word of it.  Alan tries convincing her and tells her that he thinks she can lure Phillip out of hiding.  An upset Beth tells Alan he just needs to accept that Phillip is dead for everyone's sake, especially her children's.  She starts telling him about her worries for Lizzie; she doesn't think Lizzie's ready to be in a relationship.  Alan agrees that Coop is all wrong for Lizzie and offers to help Beth if she helps him.  Alan tells Beth that if she cuts Lizzie off financially, she'll come home.   Although it's drastic, Beth warms to the idea since a parent will do anything to protect that child.\n\n\nAt Company, Lizzie shocks everyone by giving the restaurant back to the Cooper's.   Afterwards, there's a knock at the door.  Harley answers--it's a delivering man delivering pink petunia's to Lizzie Spaulding (which Lizzie earlier mentioned that her father gave her everyday)   Even though she knows Gus doesn't want her to pursue the \"Phillip is alive angle\", Harley makes an excuse to go and locate Phillip.  She goes to the warehouse and is shocked to see Phillip with his back toward her.  She tries to exit quietly when suddenly, he grabs her from behind!\n\n\n\n\n",
