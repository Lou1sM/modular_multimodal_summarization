Buzz is deeply rattled by what he sees--namely Gus confronting Alexandra about her involvement in the Antimonious drug case--and tells Frank to shut it off.  Frank tells his dad that he doesn't know what to do because this will destroy Harley.\n\n\nBill recognizes Dinah near the Beacon and approaches her.   When he asks her what she's doing back since she's a fugitive, she states that she missed Springfield and got tired of running.  She tells him that she wants her life back, the one she deserves.  Finding out Dinah has nowhere to stay, Bill invites her to stay with him.  He then warns her to stay away from the Beacon since it's owned by Cassie.  He then rushes off telling her he has to go to Harley's wedding at the Spaulding mansion.\n\n\nMichelle and Danny arrive at the Spauldings for the wedding.  Michelle tells Danny that his mission is to keep people from hounding her about their wedding.  Danny tries to explain that people are just being friendly but Michelle isn't appreciative.  He thanks her for coming with him anyway.  A little later, an unhappy Michelle calls Tony.  Since he's with the nurse from Cedars, he doesn't answer.  Michelle leaves a message though stating that she knows he doesn't want her bothering him but she needs him here.\n\n\nFrank tells an incredulous Buzz about how he went to the wine cellar at the Beacon yesterday, noticed the surveillance camera and thought to ask for the tape.  Frank thinks they need to tell Harley about this now. But Buzz is still in shock and keeps asking Frank why he brought him the tape.  He's angry about Alex's involvement while Frank continues to insist that Harley needs to know.\n\n\nOutside, a nervous Gus is waiting for the wedding to start. He's approached by Phillip who gives him some advice.  Phillip warns Gus not to blow it.  He tells Gus that he doesn't want to see Harley hurt again the way he (Phillip) hurt her.  He tells him that his marriage to Harley ended because he lied and he advises Gus to always be upfront with her. After their talk, Gus sees Alan and starts talking about his father, Joe August.  He says that being Joe August's son always meant doing the right thing   He then goes to find Harley.\n\n\nFrank and Buzz are still in the living room, both conflicted about whether or not Harley should be told.  Suddenly Buzz plays the tape again, believing that they missed something.  Perhaps there's an explanation why Alex and Gus did what they did.  Just as Frank is saying that it's all right there on the tape, Harley walks in and asks what tape?  Buzz is able to stop the tape when Frank distracts Harley, but she's on to them and demands to know what's going on.  How bad is it? Buzz tells her it's very bad.\n\n\nReva spots Michelle outside and tells her that she knows how she feels. She talks about Michelle's reluctance to hear others talk about her wedding.  Reva tells Michelle that she's hurting the people who care about her, especially Danny since their wedding was the happiest day of his life.  She tells Michelle that even though she got a raw deal, she should still remember how to treat people who love her.\n\n\nAlan tries to dissuade Gus from talking to Harley, but Gus tells him that he owes it to her. If he doesn't do it now; he doesn't deserve to marry her.\n\n\nHarley demands to know what's on the tape.  Both Buzz and Frank try to convince her to just forget about it and  marry Gus.  But she says she can't do that and orders Frank to play the tape.   As Buzz leaves the room, Frank plays the tape.  What she sees brings Harley  on the verge of tears.\n\n\nAt his place, Tony checks his voice mail and hears Michelle's message. He then blows off the lady he's with in order to meet Michelle.   \n\n\nBack at the Spauldings', Michelle approaches a sullen Danny commenting about how happy he looks.  When he assures her that he won't mention their wedding, she tells him she wants to hear about it, about all of them.  \n\n\nWaiting for the wedding to start, Cassie comments to Jeffrey about how much she loves wedding, since being part of a couple just makes you better.  As she walks away, he mutters to himself \"Unless that one brings out the absolute worst in you.\"  After he flashes back to his early days with Dinah, Cassie mentions that she keeps getting prank calls asking for Blondie. (which is how Dinah would refer to Cassie when she was with Jeffrey)\n\n\nIt's getting late and Alexandra asks Alan if they should ask the guests to sit down.  Alan comments that nothings going to happen anytime soon and notes that it's ironic that they have to pay the price for others' righteous deeds.\n\n\nInside, Harley just about collapses when she sees that Alan was in the deception also and asks Frank to leave her alone in the room.\n\n\nDanny is telling Michelle about their weddings.  She asks what their vows were.  He makes like he doesn't remember but she knows he does.  He tells her how they proclaimed their love for one another.  In a warm moment, Michelle thanks him for telling her about their wedding and he thanks her for wanting to know.  As they kiss, Tony arrives and spots the pair and leaves.\n\n\nJeffrey looks like he's watching out for somebody as Cassie approaches him and asks what's wrong.  He brushes her off by saying that he needs to find someone. When Cassie's gone, he sees a blonde server that he things is Dinah.  Unbeknownst to him though, Dinah arrives immediately after.\n\n\nBuzz laments to Frank that they should have stopped Harley and asks again why did he have to give him the tape, today of all days?  As Frank is trying to defend himself, Marina comes and gives Frank a letter she found out the house. It's from Darci.\n\n\nAs Gus is going to talk to Harley, she puts the tape in to play again. Gus enters the room and tells her they need to talk.  With this back turned, he has no idea what she's watching.\n\n\n",
