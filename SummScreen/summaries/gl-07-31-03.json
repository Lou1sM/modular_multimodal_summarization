    "tvmega_recap": "Reva returned to Springfield from Milan. Reva and Josh agree that it's easy to put their own problems in perspective after the tragedy with Ben. Ben was transported to Cedars after injecting himself with a toxic drug. Phillip bribed a housekeeper to let him into Olivia's room at The Beacon so he could put their baby's crib together. Jeffrey gets Ben to confess to four of the murders while he is in the hospital. Marina tells Buzz and Darcy that Ben turned the needle on himself for her sake. Ben told Ross to give all of his inheritance money to Marina. Ben died at Cedars with Holly at his bedside. Marina didn't say good-bye."
