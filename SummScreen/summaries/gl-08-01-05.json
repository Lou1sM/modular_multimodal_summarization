Although he enjoys the new Dinah, he's concerned that she will be caught between Edmund and Cassie when the baby is born and she has to hand it over. He asks Cassie to try to be the one Dinah turns to for support - not Edmund. \n\n\nAt Company, Dinah finds Edmund with surveillance equipment. She correctly guesses his intent when she also sees a key to Jeffrey's room. Edmund doesn't deny his intentions and states that he wants to hear whatever Jeffrey and Cassie plan together. Dinah asks Edmund to drop the charade of her pregnancy and announce that they are now together. She suggests they go somewhere to make love to seal the deal. Edmund feigns interest and tells her she must wait for her reward - the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. In order to go undetected in Jeffrey's suite, he asks Dinah to go to the farm and keep Cassie occupied. \n\n\nAt the farm, Dinah arrives just as Cassie has finished wrapping a gift for her. It's a picture of the two of them at the baby shower. Cassie comments how beautiful Dinah is in the photo. It's true, she says, pregnant women really are radiant! Dinah grimaces as she holds the photo. Cassie cuts the meeting short when the phone rings and she sees Jeffrey's number on the ID. She tells Dinah she has to leave to surprise Jeffrey who must have returned early from his trip. \n\n\nEdmund has arrived at Jeffrey's suite but discovers someone else is already there. He is shocked to discover that there is a woman waiting for Jeffrey who insinuates that she is a paramour of the DA and is anticipating a romantic evening. Edmund is overjoyed to have discovered the woman and learned of her plans. He excuses himself so she can freshen up for her 'date' but stops long enough to call the farm and say nothing when Cassie answers. \n\n\nHarley has gone to the abandoned office building to search for clues about Phillip. She sees a man crouched in the corner, assumes it is Phillip and tries to leave. Before she can reach the door, a hand reaches out to grab her. In a panic, she turns around to see that it's Mallet who is also there searching for information about Alan's story that Phillip is alive. They bicker back and forth about who is in charge of the investigation until Mallet shows her his new police badge. Frank gave him his old job as a detective in Springfield. Harley is suspicious but says nothing as Mallet tells her to stay out of his way and go back to Gus so they can plan their wedding. \n\n\nCassie has let herself into Jeffrey's suite and shouts 'Surprise!' She is mortified when a bathrobe-clad women saunters from the bathroom. The woman, Sonia, mocks the vintage of champagne Cassie is holding and reasserts her claim that she is in the right place looking for the right man. Cassie regains her composure and tells the woman to get out. Jeffrey is her boyfriend and this would have been clarified if she had called before showing up unannounced. Sonia tries to goad Cassie by saying she is used to Jeffrey being away on business; in fact that's how they met. Cassie is not roused by this taunting and responds that her guess would have been that Jeffrey had her arrested for soliciting. Cassie again tells her to get out or she will call security. \n\n\nLater at the farm, Cassie has convinced herself to not be jealous. She calls Jeffrey and begins to leave a message for him when the lights go out. Edmund is outside with a flashlight closing the panel on the breaker box. \n\n\n",
