Reva and Josh rush to find Cassie to tell her the news while Sandy goes in search of Jonathan.  Reva and Josh later find Cassie outside Company with Jeffrey and tell them about Reva's plan to trap Nate and his kidnapping of Tammy.  Cassie gets upset not only because Reva's plan put Tammy in danger but also because she thinks Reva's more concerned about Jonathan than Tammy.  Jeffrey promises to get the police involved and convinces Cassie to stay at Reva's.  Meanwhile, Reva figures out that Nate must be holding Tammy at the docks since his plan must be to drown Jonathan the same way he drowned Marissa.  They rush to the docks but Tammy and Nate are nowhere to be found.\n\n\nSandy has succeeded in locating Jonathan and tells him that Nate has Tammy.  Although shocked at first, Jonathan refuses to help stating that Tammy is Sandy's problem not his.  Later, Sandy gets a message to meet Reva and Josh at the docks but they tell him they didn't find Tammy.  However, before he leaves, Sandy spots something.  \n\n\nUnbeknownst to all of them, Nate and Tammy are nearby at the docks.  Nate has Tammy bound and gagged but removes the gag when she agrees to behave herself.  Tammy figures out that Nate's sing her to get Jonathan and tries to run away but Nate grabs her. Tammy tries to tell Nate that Jonathan hates her and won't come, but he doesn't believe it. Later, Tammy kicks Nate and tries to run away again.  Nate catches to her quickly and spots her cell phone in her pocket. (that he didn't know she had)  Nate then places a call to Jonathan.\n\n\nHarley and a very sullen Gus are at Company making wedding arrangements.  Harley knows he's upset about her missing the appointment with the wedding planner yesterday and apologizes.  Remembering her with Mallet, Gus accuses her of ducking out rather than forgetting about the appointment and suggests that they postpone the wedding.  Gus thinks they should wait until she's 100% sure of what she wants.  Harley assures him that she wants to marry him.  Suddenly, Mallet rushes in with news for Harley.  Realizing a second too late that Gus is sitting right there, Mallet tells them that Alan has been pressuring him (through threats and bribery) into believing his story about Phillip being alive.  Gus gets up to reschedule the wedding planner which gives Harley a little time to grill Mallet about what exactly his news was.  He tells her that a janitor at the old warehouse told him that a doctor and nurse had been paying frequent visits and Alan had a key to the office door.  Although that's interesting information, Harley points out that it doesn't actually prove Phillip's alive.  Suddenly, Gus returns and Harley gets up, telling Gus she's going to ask Lizzie to be one of her bridesmaids.  However, alone with Lizzie, Harley asks a totally different question- can she exhume Phillip's body in an effort to stop Alan's ranting about Phillip being alive.  Lizzie refuses the request.  In the meantime, Gus asks Mallet what he and Harley are up to. Gus accuses Mallet of helping Harley prove the \"Phillip is alive\" theory.  Mallet states that he tried to talk Harley out of pursuing it.  \n\n\nHaving  excused herself from Company, Harley high tails it to Phillip's burial vault, ready to exhume the body herself.  Mallet arrives and after questioning about whether she's doing the right thing, he offers to help her.  At the same time, Gus learns from Lizzie exactly what their conversation was about. \n\n\n\n\n",

They try to play it off, but Gus doesn't believe them. Harley asks Lizzie to have Phillip's grave exhumed. Lizzie says no. Lizzie realizes her credit cards have been cut off. Jeffery comes back into town. Cassie calls him on Sonja. Jeffery throws away his little black book. Jonathan almost makes love to Nina, but Sandy interrupts them asking for help finding Tammy. Jonathan turns him down. Reva tells Cassie that Tammy is missing. Jeffery asks Mallet to help search. Harley takes a crow bar trying to get into Phillips tomb. Mallet catches her and offers to help. Tammy almost escapes Nate, but Nate catches her. He finds her cell phone and calls Jonathan. Reva figures out they are at the docks. They hear Reva and Josh in the background looking for Tammy. Nate hangs up the phone before Jonathan answers. Sandy finds something at the docks that looks like mud or chocolate",
