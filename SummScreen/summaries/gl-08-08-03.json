Danny offered Edmond a piece of real estate on Fifth Street. Incriminating photos of Tony fell out of Eden's purse in front of Marah who picked them up. Tony wondered if Danny cares more about the Santos image than actually going legitimate. Marah ran away from the country club after seeing the photos of Tony. Edmond proposed that Cassie move out to the farm as she and Richard had planned before he died. Cassie mistakenly believed that Edmond wanted to make the move as well and refused his offer. Marah apologized to Tony for running away and told him she should have known they were fakes. Tony told Marah the pictures were real."
