Jonathan surprises them both when he decides to go with Nate and orders Tammy to leave. He's forced to be deliberately cruel to Tammy in order to get her off the boat. Heartbroken, Tammy gives Jonathan her locket and goes. Meanwhile, Reva and Josh rush to Jonathan's hotel, wanting to enlist his help in getting Tammy away from Nate, unaware that's exactly what he's doing. Later, Tammy returns and Reva hears that Jonathan's decided to leave with Nate. Reva sets off to notify the paramedics that Tammy's been found but later, when Josh goes looking for her, Reva is no where to be found. On the speedboat, Jonathan has resigned to his fate, certain that he doesn't deserve anything better than Nate, unaware the Reva lurks nearby, determined to change his mind. Dinah fakes contractions and Edmund is forced to talk her down from her jealousy and convince Cassie that it was a false alarm. But, Dinah isn't willing to back off completely, now that she has come to doubt that Edmund hates Cassie, as he claims. So Edmund spins another tale, elaborating on a plan to get Dinah the farm and leave Cassie with nothing. Desperate Dinah puts aside her doubts, for now, but gives Edmund a deadline: in two weeks, she's going to fake a miscarriage and he'd better have everything in order. Olivia returns to town and Bill's anxious to tell her about his new roommate, Michelle, before Olivia finds out for herself. But, Olivia's consumed with an epiphany she's had about Nate and the conversation doesn't come up until a shocked Olivia finds a bra behind the couch. \n\n\n",
