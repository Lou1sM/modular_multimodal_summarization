When he rushes over to hug her, Michelle stops him by saying that she has a cold and doesn't want him to catch him.  Rick tries to shrug off her concern, but Michelle is adamant that he not touch her.  Soon, they start talking about Danny.  Rick tells Michelle that Danny was looking for her at the Bauer Barbecue and mentioned that he couldn't wait until she got home.  Before he leaves, Rick writes Michelle a prescription to make her feel better--call Danny.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Danny is with Marina at Company talking about Gus and Harley's upcoming wedding.  Talk of the wedding leads to talk of their moving in together and Marina wonders if he's freaked out about that.  Danny thinks Marina's the one who's scared and gently reassures her that he wants to live with her.  At that moment, Danny's cell phone rings--it's Michelle.  Thinking that she's still in Africa, Danny tries to convince her to come back home for Robbie's sake since Robbie really misses her. He suggests coming next week for Parent's Day at Robbie's school, but Michelle claims that can't come home yet.  This upsets Danny and he almost tells her off but decides to just let it go.  Michelle tries to find out what's new with Danny but he doesn't tell her anything.  This isn't lost on Marina and when the call ends she's upset that he didn't tell Michelle about them moving in together. Danny assures her that it wasn't intentional.  As he's talking to Marina, a woman dressed in a hat and dark glasses looks through the window.

She tries to get Edmund to promise her that they'll win, but Edmund evades the question by stating that he has to go to hurry and get Cassie to sign the papers.  Edmund then gets Cassie to come to Company.  Cassie is concerned to see a groggy Dinah, but Edmund insists that she's fine, just tired.

Reva tries to convince Jonathan that he can't kill Nate because he's better than him, but Jonathan's not listening as he begins trying to choke the life out of him.  Finally, Jonathan does stop and turns on Reva by grabbing the spark plugs from her. he then shocks Reva by admitting that he is who he is and stating that he's going with Nate.  Nate's pleased by this little turnaround and tells Jonathan that he's at the point of no return, he can't go back and neither can Reva.
