Mel, still worried about passing the bar exam, told Jeffrey she was considering working for Harley's Angels instead of the DA's office. Jeffrey told Mel he couldn't understand why women do ridiculous things. Mel called him an elitist pig and told him it doesn't matter because she quits! Cassie took a break from work to have a romantic interlude with Edmund in the linen closet. RJ continues to call Jeffrey Daddy. Josh was upset that Reva wants to do her own readings on the air. Danny went to Eden's apartment and told her he doesn't believe it was an accident that Marah saw the photos. He also told her to back off \u0096 he will handle Tony and Salerno. Cassie told Jeffrey to drop the obnoxious act because she's on to him. Jeffrey told Cassie her hair looks like hell and made a pass at Reva when she walked into the lobby at The Beacon."
