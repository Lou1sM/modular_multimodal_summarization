Michelle thinks Danny should take the job but he feels as if that would be a step backward for him.  He tries to explain that she was the reason he got out of the mob business to begin with, but that just exasperates Michelle who asks if he can live with who she is now.  She tells him that she's angry that he keeps hiding things from her and tells him to tell her exactly how bad his financial problems are.  He does and that asks what good did it do.  Michelle tries to tell him that it was good because now she can help him. Danny's skeptical that Michelle can help him.  His doubts frustrate her and she stalks off.   \n\n\nAngry, Michelle goes to the lighthouse and calls Tony to meet her.  When Tony arrives, Michelle tells him that she has a solution for everything. She notes that the lighthouse makes her feel better and she thinks it could do the same for others too.  Her idea is it turn the lighthouse into a restaurant-type gathering place and she wants him to go in with her.  Tony's very resistant at first, telling her it's a bad idea.  But Michelle's convinced it can work.  Tony tries to dissuade her by stating that Danny won't be happy that she's using his money since the way he (Tony) does business is not normal.  However, she's able to sweet talk him into agreeing.  When he does, an elated Michelle jumps into his arms and they kiss passionately.\n\n\nHarley is shocked that Phillip is the head of Springfield Corp. He tells her that he has plans for that part of town and Company is in the way. When Harley and Buzz get upset, Phillip ties to convince them that's it's a good  deal and tries to encourage Buzz to take the money.    When Marina walks in and learns what's going on, she gets upset and attacks Phillip. Nonplussed, Phillip tells the Coopers that it's nothing personal, it's just business.  Again he encourages Harley to look over the contract and encourages Buzz to take the money.  When Harley states that they'll stop Phillip, he smugly asks her if she really thinks they can.  After almost getting attacked by Buzz after that remark, Phillip leaves.  With Phillip gone, Buzz seems resigned to his fate and tries to make the best of it, but neither Harley nor Marina believe that he wants to give up Company and encourage him to fight.  Suddenly, Harley gets an idea on how to bring a Spaulding down--use a Spaulding.  Knowing she's talking about going to Gus for help, both Buzz and Marina try to dissuade her but she's determined to find Gus.\n\n\nCassie sees Bill at the gym.  After some small talk she tells him she wants to talk about putting a security system in her home.  He tells her that although he doesn't do that kind of work, he'll refer her to someone else.  \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Edmund gets some information on Jeffrey.  It seems Jeffrey has been on a leave of absence--hence he's not conducting any official investigation.  Later, he questions Cassie about her faith in Jeffrey, specially how if he's trying to help her find her imposter, why is it taking him so long?  After a small argument on the subject of Jeffrey O'Neill, Cassie changes the subject and tells him that she's having a security system put in the farm.  \n\n\nJeffrey picks the lock on Bill's apartment and lets himself him, planning on planting a bug.  Unbeknownst to him, Dinah is lurking in a corner, holding a dagger.  Soon, Jeffrey's caught by Bill, who accuses him of breaking and entering.  Jeffrey covers though by stating that the door was left open.  Jeffrey lets on to Bill that he knows he's hiding Dinah and warns him that she's a lost cause.  When Jeffrey leaves, Bill confronts Dinah and asks her if she was lying when she told him she was in town to turn herself in.  Dinah maintains that she didn't lie, she just lost her nerve.  Bill warns her that she's not safe and she tells him that she knows--she needs to disappear. When Dinah thanks him for everything he's done, Bill persuades her to stay so they can enjoy one last dinner together.  He goes out to get food after she assures him that she'll be there when he returns.  However right after he leaves, she starts packing.  While packing, Bill's phone ring--it's Cassie wanting to talk about the security system.  Hearing Cassie's voice on the answering machine, Dinah picks up, but doesn't speak.  \n\n\nDanny sees Bill outside and proposes that they work together again, this time to rebuild Fifth Street.  It's obvious that Bill's not fond of this idea at all.  Bill's still resentful of how Danny lied about not using dirty money last time and how that ended up hurting not only Eden but Michelle as well.  Finally, he lashes out and shoves Danny!\n\n\nJeffrey returns to Bill's apartment, this time to see Dinah.  He knew she was there since he could smell her perfume.   Dinah, who is still holding the dagger, tells Jeffrey that he could just let her walk away. No one would have to know.  Just then, he pulls her into a passionate kiss.   \n\n\nAt that moment, Cassie and Edmund (who had decided to visit Bill in person to talk to him) arrive outside the door.\n\n\n",
