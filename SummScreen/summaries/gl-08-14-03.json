Marah told Tony she loves him but she's afraid he might snap one day. Danny and Salerno exchanged mutual threats (mob style) to each- others family members. Phillip attended Lizzie's therapy session and learned her problems are more serious than he thought. Tony begged Marah to take him back, but she can't forget the image of the battered woman in the photo. Eden told Bill he was all she wanted after he said he wouldn't share her with Tony or anyone else. Phillip found out he and Olivia will have a girl - as Lizzie watched on in horror. Edmund and Cassie daydreamed about their new life at the farm. Cassie and Olivia are developing a friendship. Tony asked Eden to go to Salerno to find out who the woman in the photo is."
