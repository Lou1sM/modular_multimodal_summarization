Shayne assures his mother Marina is going with him because they love each other. Frank and Buzz arrive to say goodbye to Shayne, not realizing Marina is planning to go with him. Shayne leads Marina away and asks if she wants to go for the same reasons he does. Marina admits going to Bosnia to set up youth programs is not her passion, but he is and she wants to be with him. Shayne doesn't think it's enough. When Marina mentions Phillip is trying to destroy Company, Shayne convinces her stay behind and help her family. After tearful goodbyes, Reva and Josh speculate on how wonderful their children are in spite of having them for parents. \n\n\nAt the Lighthouse, Michelle and Tony share a passionate kiss after he agrees to become her partner in opening a restaurant/bar inside the Lighthouse. After the kiss, Michelle seems unaffected and wants to talk about her plans some more. Tony is shaken and confused by what just happened between him and his cousin's wife. Rick arrives with Robbie, which seems to disappoint Michelle. Feeling uncomfortable around her brother, Tony leaves. Michelle tells Rick her plans for the Lighthouse and about Tony's involvement. He tells her she must have a death wish. He warns her not to upset Danny because she has no idea of what he is capable. He says he can't believe she ignored her own son to hang out with Tony at the Lighthouse, where Robbie has never been. Rick leaves disgusted. Michelle picks up Robbie and tells him she's taking him for a ride. \n\n\nCassie and Edmund arrive at Bill's apartment. Jeffrey and Dinah are inside about to make love when they are interrupted by the knock at the door. Dinah hides while Jeffrey answers the door and convinces Cassie to go to The Beacon with him to discuss her plans for extra security. Edmund has other plans and will meet them later. He phones Dinah, whom he only knows as \"Dee\", and says they have to meet. She agrees to meet him at Company. There, before his meeting with Dinah, Edmund confronts Danny about the loans Cassie co-signed for him. Danny tells Edmund he has everything under control. Edmund says he had better get things turned around quick because he will not allow Cassie to end the same as Michelle, Danny's 'collateral damage'. Outside, he tells Dinah he is tired of playing her games and she'd better give him some information soon. She advises Edmund should be more concerned about the fact Jeffrey and Cassie are spending so much time together. \n\n\nLater at The Beacon, Edmund walks in to see Jeffrey comforting and reassuring Cassie. She tries to kiss Edmund but he ignores her and leaves the room. After leaving Cassie, Jeffrey returns to his room to find Edmund there waiting for him. In no mood to joke with the secretive DA, Edmund tells Jeffrey everyone in town thinks he is no longer the monster he used to be, but assures him the monster is still there waiting for the right person to push him just far enough. Outside, Dinah corners RJ and tells him she is planning on sticking around. 'Isn't that just wonderful? Huh, RJ?' Innocent RJ agrees. \n\n\nOutside at Company, Olivia breaks up a fight between Bill and Danny. Bill accuses Danny of being trouble for Michelle and anyone else he gets involved with. Buzz and Frank show up and after calling Olivia the 'Bride of Frankenstein', tell them about Phillip's plans to ruin Company. She reminds them Phillip is no longer her husband. She makes plans to meet Bill at his apartment to discuss what Phillip may be up to. Later, at his apartment, Olivia finds a letter from Dinah and confronts Bill with it. He admits she is his sister. Olivia is surprised his fugitive sister is in Springfield. Bill tells her Dinah is not a threat to anyone and asks Olivia not to tell anyone about it. She agrees. \n\n\nMichelle finds Danny leaving Company and tells him about her plans with Tony for the Lighthouse. Danny doesn't like the idea, but sullen Michelle tells him she's doing it for them to help him pay back the loans. Danny's mood darkens and he tells Michelle to go ahead with her plans because he obviously can't stop her. He says he has plans of his own. \n\n\n",
