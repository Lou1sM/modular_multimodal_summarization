But, he can sense she hasn't and decides to visit Alan, who he's sure is the one who sent the videotape to his bachelor party. Alan denies and warns Gus that Phillip is out there, lurking, and Alan's not the one he should be worried about. Gus blows him off and tricks Alan into signing an exhumation order for Phillip. He presents the order to Harley as a wedding gift so they can know for sure if Phillip's really dead. Meanwhile, Alan gives an engagement ring to Beth to prove he was serious about the proposal. She leaves to ponder her options and Alan remains determined to go ahead with his plan. Edmund gets paperwork from his lawyer on the illegal adoption he's rushing to put into place, but Dinah gets her hands on the envelope, assuming it's divorce papers. Dinah tries to get them to Cassie but Edmund is able to snag them back and keep his charade going. Thinking he won't come up with a baby before Dinah's two-week deadline, Edmund begins to despair until he sees a very pregnant Michelle and is intrigued. Marina learns Michelle's back in town and not too subtly makes it clear that she and Danny are happy. Michelle is nearly ready to tell Marina she's pregnant but pulls back. Later, Michelle is at the hospital filling out paper work and impulsively lists Danny as the emergency contact. When a nurse calls Danny for clarification about the baby's medical insurance, Danny is very confused. \n\n\n",

Beth tries to fish for information on what Gus's plans for Spaulding Enterprises and the family are. Alan gives Beth an engagement ring and they do a practice run at kissing. It looks very awkward. Gus tricks Alan into signing an order to exhume Phillip's body and gives it to Harley as a wedding present. Vince Russo gives Edmund the papers for his divorce settlement and the agreement to find a baby. Dinah sneaks the baby agreement out of Edmund's briefcase and almost gives it to Cassie. Edmund manages to get the papers back before Cassie reads them. Dinah insists on seeing the papers because she thinks it is the divorce agreement. Edmund manages to swap envelopes and shows her the divorce agreement. Marina calls Michelle to welcome her home and let her know she doesn't view her as a threat because she and Danny are \"solid\".
