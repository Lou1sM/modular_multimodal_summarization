Beth states that it may be too late to come back. She doesn't want Lizzie to come back just for a credit card, her attitude needs to change as well.  Lizzie seems to understand and starts on about how upset she was about Beth marrying Alan, which leads her to talk about missing her father and missing the entire family.  Beth is sympathetic,  hugs Lizzie and allows her to come back home. Just then a man approaches looking for Lizzie. Lizzie tells her mother it's someone from WSPR about her new job and she starts talking about how she has no money for new clothes and asks for some pocket money.  Beth supplies her with a blank check and then goes off to her meeting.  Meanwhile, Lizzie goes to the man, who's not from WSPR--he's a jeweler.  Lizzie tells the man that money is no object and begins looking at engagement rings.   \n\n\nMeanwhile, back at Company, Coop has just gotten an acceptance letter from Oxford University to attend a semester long creative writing seminar.  This comes as a shock to him since he never applied.  Buzz admits that he sent in a few of Coop's short stories. While Coo[p is still wrapping his mind around this news, Buzz points out that while Coop was needed before, the family's on track now and he can pursue his own dreams.  Though he's definitely excited about the offer, Coop's a little leery about accepting it since it means he'll be gone for 4 months.  While he and Buzz are discussing it, Beth walks in.  When she hears the news, she's very happy for Coop and reassures him that he and Lizzie can be apart for four months; it'll just fly by.  Soon, Lizzie walks in. She and Coop go outside to talk and she tells him that she's found the solution to all their problems.  She then proposes to him.\n\n\nDanny and Marina are basking in their love making when the phone rings.  It's for Marina--she has an assignment.  Marina reports to Mallet  After some small talk, he gives her her assignment. She's to procure a fake ID from a college student named Roth who's been selling them to other students and criminals.  Mallet tells her that she'll have back up at the bar and tells her not to get out of her back up's sight.  Marina goes to the bar and asks Roth to buy her a drink since she's underage.  After he does so, she tells him this story about how her mother is too strict and so she just left.  When she mentions about always getting carded, Roth offers to make her a fake ID.  Marina acts excited by the prospect and Roth offers to show her his ID machine that's in his car.  As Marina gets up, she notices that her back up is distracted by another customer.  Although Marina tries to beg off going to Roth's car, he convinces her that they'll only be gone a minute  Knowing her back up is preoccupied, Marina goes off with Roth.  Suddenly, in the hallway, Roth starts forcing himself on her.  \n\n\nDanny, meanwhile, has gotten a call himself.  Robbie wants to be picked up from camp because he's homesick ever since his mother called him.  After picking up Robbie, Danny goes to the hospital to see if Rick knows where Michelle is staying.  Rick has no idea.  Danny's not happy that Michelle can't be located. He thinks Michelle is trying to avoid that fact that Danny's moved on by avoiding him.  Danny tells Rick that for Robbie's sake, Michelle's going to have to deal with it.  Wanting to talk to Michelle, Danny finds out where she called from by asking the camp to check their caller ID.  When he learns she called from Towers, he leaves Robbie with Rick and heads out there.  \n\n\nEdmund's also at Cedars, getting medicine from an open medicine cabinet.  he's caught by Rick and tries to cover by saying he has a terrible headache and the cabinet was already open anyway.  Rick's not buying it and assumed that Edmund is after the pain medicine that's in his hand.  The medicine is highly addictive, leading Rick to think Edmund has a problem.  After giving Edmund the number for a rehab clinic (and telling him he will call to see if Edmund called), Rick locks up the cabinet and gets Edmund to leave.  However, unbeknownst to Rick, Edmund has pocket a different drug--one that induces labor.  \n\n\nMichelle's at Edmund's apartment scheduling an amnio and a DNA test.  However, when she goes to leave the apartment, she's shocked when she can't get out. Unbeknownst to her, Edmund has bolted the door shut on the outside.  While Michelle is trying to call maintenance to tell them about the stuck door, Edmund arrives.  Michelle tells him that she's going to the hospital for the tests but he quickly stops her.  He then begins warning her about amnios, about how risky they are.  Although Michelle's not worried at first, she does get scared when he tells her Dinah almost had a miscarriage after hers. Michelle tries to reason that she's almost full term and she hasn't had any problems, but Edmund still puts doubts in her mind and he encourages her to lay down and take a nap.  While she's fast asleep, he prepares the syringe with the labor-inducing drug and injects her with it.  The action jolts Michelle awake but Edmund tries to ease her mind by saying he was just swatting a fly that was on her.  She seems to buy his explanation and starts to go back asleep.  Just then, Danny arrives ready to knock on the door.\n\n\n\n\n",
