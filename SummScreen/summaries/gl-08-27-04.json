Sandy adamantly refuses to go.  Confused by his reaction,\nReva assures him that Richard would have wanted him to have it.  As\nshe's trying to convince him, the phone suddenly rings, to Sandy's\nrelief.  While Reva's on the phone with Shayne (a call that Sandy set\nup), Sandy retrieves the passport and pockets it.  After Reva's done\nwith the call, she thanks Sandy for arranging it, she figures out that's\nwhy he didn't want to go to the bank.  He confirms it and says they can\ngo any other day. Reva assures him that he will get that money.  Just\nthen Remy, Marina, Tammy, and Joey arrive for Sandy's birthday party.\nReva notices how happy Joey and Tammy look and asks Tammy if they're\nback together?  Tammy says no, but she's been wondering why they\nshouldn't be?  Later, Tammy and Joey seem to be having a good time and\nseem to be very comfortable with each other.  However, when Joey notes\nthat he's there to keep his eye on Tammy, she's offended and  when he\nstates that he's been worried about her because of her mother's identity\nthief, Tammy asks if that's the only reason he's with her.\nUncomfortable, Joey doesn't answer the question,   Instead he asks Tammy\nif she's had fun with her?  He wishes she wouldn't get so worked up and\nmake everything complicated.  Just then, Lizzie calls.  She says she's\nbeen talking up his CD's in New York and wants to know what he's doing.\nJoey doesn't seem too anxious to talk to Lizzie.  He mentions that he's\nat Sandy's party but makes no mention at all of Tammy. After rushing\nthrough his call with Lizzie, he tells Tammy that he had a really good\ntime with her today.\n\n\nSandy thanks Reva for arranging the party for him and for everything\nshe's done for him.  She won't accept his thanks, stating that he came\ninto her life at the right time for both of them. Later, when the\nparty's over, the phone rings.  Sandy answers it.  It's someone from the\nbank who mistakenly thinks he's talking to Josh.  He informs him that\nthere is a problem.  They believe the boy who is claiming to be Reva's\nson is an imposter.  \n\n\nA furious Harley orders Phillip to get out of the hospital.  Gus is\nholding her back, but she breaks away and lays into Phillip , calling\nhim sick  and saying it's only a matter of time before he's locked away\nagain.  Phillip then states that he was ready to put an end to all of\nthis by relinquishing Company back to Buzz.  But he's changed his mind\nnow.  With that, he takes a contract and rips it up.  Harley and Gus are\nboth shocked but Phillip is unapologetic.  He's let Harley spit in his\nface and then offer her a gift?  As Harley is getting angry, Phillip\nrefuses to take any responsibility for Buzz's heart attack, in fact\nsaying that it's how Buzz took care of himself.  With that, Harley loses\nit and attacks Phillip as Blake and Rick walk by.  While Blake gets\nHarley away, Rick tries to talk to Phillip about what he's doing.  But\nPhillip insists it's just business.  Phillip tells Rick to trust him and\nnot believe what everyone says about it.  Phillip leaves and Rick is at\na loss to explain Phillip's actions.  Gus follows Phillip to the\nhospital parking lot to berate him for what he's doing.  He accuses him\nof torturing Harley.  Phillip states that he doesn't wish any harm to\ncome to Buzz, as long as he doesn't try to harm Phillip.  Gus can't\nunderstand Phillip's attitude (since what did the Coopers ever do to\nhim?), but Phillip points out that Gus was just as ruthless and\nvindictive when he first came to Springfield.  Gus notes that he's\nnothing like Phillip, Phillip states that according to Harley he is, and\nhe should embrace that.  Again, Gus urges Phillip to stop punishing the\nCoopers. Phillip says it's not about punishment; it's about knowing who\nyou are.  Gus asks Phillip who he is?  Phillip says, pointedly, \"I'm\nPhillip Spaulding. Who are you?\"   As Gus walks off, Phillip makes a\ncall telling the person on the other end that they'll have to go with\nthe alternate  plan. Move the schedule up.\n\n\nGus returns to the OR.  Harley asks if he and Phillip had a nice chat.\nGus states that he just wanted to make things right.  He mentions to her\nthat they seemed to have a moment earlier. He was hoping they were on\nthe verge of remembering what they meant to each other.  He tells her he\nwants to work on making the gap between them smaller.  He knows she\nstill loves him; he can see it in her eyes and he won't stop trying.  As\nHarley walks off to greet Frank, Gus's cellphone rings.  He's shocked to\nlearn the demolition has been moved up to today and rushes off without\ntelling anyone.  When Harley returns, she's disgusted to hear that Gus\nleft, saying something about Spaulding business.   A little later, Buzz\nis wheeled in for surgery.  He inquires about Gus, and Harley says he\njust stepped out to take a call.  Buzz tells Harley to remember what he\nsaid, forget the small stuff.  He's wheeled away and Harley is mad\nbecause Gus wasn't there for her father.  She says she doesn't know who\nhe his any more  and after today, she doesn't care.  At the same time,\nGus arrives at Company and tries to explain to the foreman that Company\ncan't be torn down today, but the man insists he's under orders from\nPhillip.
