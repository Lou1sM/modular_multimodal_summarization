Jonathan tries to tell Josh that Reva's condition is really bad, that if she's not careful she may be crippled for life.  But Reva refuses to go along with that and assures josh that the doctor said she was fine.  Josh isn't sure who to believe, especially when Reva has a back spasm.  But he promises Reva that he will stick by her and do whatever it takes to get her well again.  By this point, Jonathan's left, and Reva proves to Josh that she's alright by standing up and walking around. She then has another back spasm, but when Josh tries to help, she refuses it.  Reva tells him that she wants him to help her because he loves her, not out of obligation.  Josh tries to state that he does love her, but he ends up making it clear that her getting well is a priority over them saving their marriage.  Before Josh leaves the room to get her something, Reva calls him one of the last good guys. Once he's gone, she decides that's why she needs to push him away.   When Josh returns, Reva's already checked herself out.  \n\n\nReva goes to Outskirts where she tells Jonathan that she told Josh the truth about her condition.  Jonathan thinks that was a bad move, but Reva maintains that she made the right decision.  She wants him to stay with her out of love, not obligation.  Reva notes that although he is the love of her life, neither one of them is happy right now.  Later, Josh comes to the bar looking for Reva.   When Reva subtly spots her, she begins overtly flirting with a man at the bar.\n\n\nA very serious Sandy is at Outskirts, ready to meet with the PI he hired. Suddenly, Tammy arrives and Sandy tells her that he hired the female PI to locate his family and friends since they'd lost contact. He tells her that he wants his family to meet her. Tammy's very excited about the idea and starts talking about planning a reunion.\n\n\nSandy quickly nixes that idea by suggesting that they take things one step at a time; he'd like to get information on everyone's whereabouts first.  He then goes off to tell his PI that he doesn't want Tammy to know the reason she's hired.  Tammy meanwhile, has decided not to listen to Sandy and begins asking Jonathan about Sandy's past since she wants to plan the reunion as a surprise. Jonathan reveals that Sandy had one, that's it, one friend. He said it was a guy named Fallon from Chicago who called once in the middle of the night.  Tammy's intrigued and plans on seeing if she can get information on Fallon.\n\n\nA guilt-ridden Dinah is at the farm, trying to ell Cassie the truth about the baby. She tries to explain that all she wanted was pay-back, that the initial plan was to leave town with Edmund and the baby. Cassie is touched by Dinah's honesty and starts to praise her, stating that they could end up being friends one day.  Cassie's understanding is unsettling Dinah since she's getting it all wrong by assuming that Dinah's secret is that she slept with Edmund and now wants to marry him. After warning Dinah to be careful of Edmund, Cassie leaves to take RJ to a sleepover.  \n\n\nEdmund finally finds Michelle. Michelle is injured from the accident and has gone into labor.  Edmund proceeds to deliver her baby, with a delirious Michelle thinking that he's Danny.  After giving birth, Michelle collapses and Edmund takes her newborn daughter as his own, telling the child that she will help him reunite with Cassie.  Before leaving with the baby, Edmund calls 911 to report a car on fire, then torches Michelle's car. When Michelle wakes up, she assumes that her baby is in the burning go but collapses again before she can get to it.\n\n\nEdmund leaves the newborn baby on the front porch of the farm so he can handle one loose end. Edmund then convinces Dinah that they need to get out of town ASAP because once their deception is discovered, the whole town will hate them.  Dinah's reluctant at first, but finally agrees after Edmund suggests that she leave a video message for her father.  After leaving the message, Dinah thinks she hears a baby crying outside. Suddenly, Edmund chloroforms her.  As an unconscious Dinah lay upstairs, Edmund calls Cassie to tell her to come home--Dinah's in labor.\n\n\n\n\n",
