When Shayne walked in, Nico recognized him and said he (Shayne) could do better than Marina. Marah asked Josh to interview Sandy for a job. Reva asked Cassie if she would ever be able to forgive Edmond for causing her to lose her baby. Cassie thinks she can because he makes her happy. Edmond told Cassie he is afraid she will come to her senses one day and force him out of her life. Lizzie didn't want to talk to a new psychiatrist but agreed when she found out he has been working with Reva on psychic phenomenon. When he arrived to evaluate her, Lizzie pretended she had something to tell him only he would understand.
