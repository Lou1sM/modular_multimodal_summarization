It's Ross who says Dinah has been arrested. Harley is shocked to discover Dinah is in Springfield and wants to call Cassie to see if she has heard. Before she has a chance, a man arrives with orders from Phillip Spaulding to demolish Company. Harley snatches the order and tears it up, saying this is what she thinks about Phillip Spaulding. \n\n\nHarley runs outside and tells the protesters what Phillip is trying to do. She taunts the wrecking crew as Bill advises her they will mow the place down whether she is there or not. Harley handcuffs herself to a railing in front of the restaurant. The demolition foreman asks Bill to talk sense into her. He decides to handcuff himself next to Harley. Gus shows up and tells Harley to take off the cuffs. Harley appeals to the foreman and asks him to consider what he would do if this were happening to his family. The foreman says he can't proceed while people are chained to the building. Gus responds, 'Good, so get out of here.' Phillip arrives and tells the foreman to stay put and also tells Gus to do the job he is being paid to do. \n\n\nBuzz arrives with Frank and Coop at his side after leaving the hospital early. He tells Phillip to go ahead and mow down 'Old Grandpa while he's on his porch.' The Cooper family surrounds Buzz as a news reporter arrives, reporting on a 'battle between the big guy and the little guy. And Springfield has always loved the underdog.' Lillian shows up and sides with the Coopers. Phillip, defeated, calls off the bulldozers. Lillian tries to explain her actions to Phillip who only tells her to never stand in his way again. \n\n\nAt a bar, Father Ray and Sandy meet to discuss an idea Sandy has. He asks Ray to intervene for him with his boss, who doesn't seem to like the little people. Phillip arrives in time to hear Sandy's comment, but listens to his proposal to have WSPR get involved in the 'Rock the Vote' campaign. He likes the idea and tells Sandy to have something in writing on his desk first thing in the morning. When Sandy leaves, Father Ray mentions the things he has heard lead him to believe Phillip may need his guidance. Phillip smugly assures Ray he is fine and only acting in the best interest of his children. \n\n\nAt Tony's new house, formerly Danny and Michelle's, Danny and he are arguing about Michelle, who is outside being mugged. Tony tells Danny to clear his things out and lock up behind him. Tony walks outside and attacks Michelle's mugger. Danny follows and stops Tony as the mugger breaks free and runs away. Michelle screams at Danny for letting her assailant get away. She tells him she packing her stuff and they are going their separate ways. Tony leaves. Danny notices she is limping and after groveling is allowed to help her with the scrape. Michelle admits she fell in the driveway chasing the mugger. Danny tells her he doesn't mean to upset her, but only wants to support her with the Lighthouse after seeing how important the project is to her. He asks her to count on him, not Tony. Michelle defends Tony, 'He's been great to me!' Danny hints Tony may be interested in more than a business relationship. Michelle informs Danny that possibility exists only in his head. They agree to start over and try to get know each other again by leaving the past behind. They kiss. \n\n\nAt the police station Cassie and Edmund arrive to see what is going on with Dinah. Cassie is wondering what lies Dinah will tell to save herself when Tammy and Blake arrive. Blake approaches Ross and tells him she came to see that Dinah gets everything she deserves. Dinah arrives escorted by Jeffrey. Edmund asks Dinah not to cause any more pain to the people she has hurt. She says she only wants the pain to end. Dinah tells everyone she wishes she could go back and change things, but she can't. She admits what she has done and says she prays for understanding. She recounts her time in Europe as not only running from the police, but running from herself as well. She said in order to survive financially she took the opportunity to impersonate Princess Cassie. She stops short of naming Jeffrey as her cohort or mentioning the fact that he asked her to do it. \n\n\nBlake wants to know why Dinah didn't turn herself in as soon as she arrived back in Springfield. Dinah said she had to visit the farm one last time and what she saw was horrible. Edmund and Dinah have a shared recollection of Edmund whacking Jeffrey in the head with a shovel. Dinah continues, saying the horrible thing was the barn on fire with Cassie and RJ trapped inside. She said she made the decision to stay and help instead of adding one more deed to her list of regrets. She finishes by saying she alone will accept the blame and not involve anyone else. Cassie wants to know who else could possibly be involved with her. Ross pipes in that she is talking about him. He admits he has known for weeks his daughter was back in Springfield. Blake is shocked he knew her brother's murderer was back in town and he didn't tell her. She accuses Ross of knowingly putting innocent people's lives in danger. Ross says Dinah is not threat and he wants to see her acquitted. \n\n\nJeffrey leads Dinah away and privately tells her she put on quite a performance. She agrees it was a good one and reminds Jeffrey she could drag him down at any time unless he helps her. Edmund finds her alone in a room where she also advises him to convince Cassie to not pursue her or she will expose his involvement with her. \n\n\nAt the Beacon, Father Ray arrives as Tony is about to make a toast. Tony says he is celebrating his partnership with Michelle. Ray wants to know what is going on between them. Tony muses that maybe Danny and Michelle won't get back together this time. Ray begs him to see reason and not go after his cousin's wife. Tony tells Ray his vow of celibacy won't let him understand the love between a man and a woman. \n\n\n",
