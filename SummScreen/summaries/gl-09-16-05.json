    "soap_central": "\n\nEdmund is holding baby Hope outside Company, telling her how she'll help reunite him with Cassie, but before everyone can live happily every after, Michelle and Jeffrey need to \"go away.\"  He then goes into Company where he comes across Cassie and Jeffrey (who appears to have caught a cold) having lunch.  When asked if there's been any word from Dinah, Edmund says no, prompting Cassie to state that she's really worried about her.   Edmund then leaves Hope with Cassie since Hope has a doctor's appointment,  Jeffrey goes with her to get medicine for his cold.\n\n\nIn the farmhouse replica, Dinah starts to read about Michelle losing her baby in an accident.  Suddenly, Edmund comes in, ranting about how devoted Cassie is to Jeffrey.  Dinah tries to explain that the hold Jeffrey has is that he looks like Richard, but Edmund's not really listening. He starts to talk about how he wants Cassie and him to raise their child together. When Dinah questions what he means, Edmund quickly changes the subject.  Dinah's getting frustrated by all his talk about Cassie and demands to be let out of confinement.  Edmund's not willing to do that though.  He's shocked when she brings up the news about Michelle's baby.  Seeing the look on his face, Dinah reads the article and figures out that Edmund must have taken Michelle's baby!  Edmund doesn't deny it--in fact he appears to relish in telling her about his perfect plan.  As Edmund tries to convince a horrified Dinah that this was the best solution for everyone, Dinah suddenly starts to freak out about being held prisoner.  Telling Edmund she's suffering from a panic attack, Dinah gets him to refill her anti-anxiety prescription.  While he's gone, a very calm Dinah decides to drug Edmund so she can escape and make him pay for what he's done to her.    \n\n\nJeffrey and Edmund have gotten their respective prescriptions filled and literally run into each other on the street.  Edmund drops Dinah's prescription which Jeffrey picks up. Jeffrey is shocked to see that they're for Dinah and they were filled today.\n\n\nMichelle and Danny are at the Bauer house discussing her plan to leave town to put distance between herself and what she lost.  Danny doesn't think her leaving is a good idea, and tries to convince her that her other baby, Robbie, needs her at home.  At this point, Ross arrives to check up on Michelle.  After they talk about the missing Dinah, whom Ross is very worried about, Michelle asks Ross if he's seen Cassie's baby.  Before Ross can answer, Danny pulls him aside and explains that he's trying to distract Michelle from thoughts of her baby. When Ross leaves so he can file a missing persons report on Dinah, Michelle asks Danny if they can go see Cassie and the baby.  Danny's not too keen on that idea and tells her she should just focus on Robbie.  Michelle quietly states that she's surprised he even wants her to stay.  Michelle starts to lament that had the baby had lived, things would be totally different between them.  Danny's not so sure since they don't even know if that was his child.  Michelle asks Danny what would have happened if it were; Danny can't answer that question.  Soon after, the rosebush that Danny ordered is delivered. He tells Michele that he thinks they should plant it in honor of her child.  Michelle is very moved and gives him a hug, which causes her to wince in pain.   Danny decides to take Michelle to the hospital.  There at Cedars, Michelle sees Cassie holding her baby. \n\n\nGus and Harley arrive at Spaulding Enterprises for the board meeting.  While Harley is trying to encourage Gus that he'll do fine, Blake walks in and informs them that Alan is at the hospital.  Gus is certain this is a ploy by Alan and leaves to confront him.  Blake meanwhile tries to get Harley to admit that Gus running Spaulding might not be the best thing for their marriage, considering that Harley's other two Spaulding marriages were disasters. Harley shrugs it off and tries to convince Blake, and herself, that she's okay with Gus running the company because Gus is different.  \n\n\nAlan receives an unexpected visitor--India!  India is not happy to see Alan at all since he killed the only man she ever really loved.  Alan points out that Phillip never loved her to begin it, his heart was always with Beth.  After discussing Beth, who India doesn't have a high opinion of, India informs Alan that she's there to ensure that Spaulding Enterprise's doors are closed to him forever--even if that means voting for Gus as CEO.  After telling Alan to rot in hell, India leaves.  Soon after, Alan gets another visitor--Gus.  Gus tells Alan that he knows he's in the hospital because of the meeting.  Gus tells Alan that he only wants to save the company ad the family, but Alan's not impressed and tells Gus it's a bad idea. He tells Gus that he'll ruin his marriage in the process. Alan tells Gus that the position of CEO will shift his priorities and eventually Harley will lose all respect for him.  \n\n\nBack at Spaulding, everyone has arrived for the board meeting (except for Beth who, thanks to Lizzie, is stranded in Boston) and the meeting begins.  While Gus is giving his speech about wanting to get the company back on track, Alan's words come back to haunt him. Suddenly doubtful, Gus tenses up and then just walks out to get some air.  While he's gone, Alan calls for a vote, but Harley asks to speak first.  Harley speaks eloquently about 'Spaulding needing to embrace honesty and integrity and working to make people's lives better.  She encourages the board to vote for Gus.  When she's finished, she leaves the room so the board can vote and runs into Gus.  Harley tells Gus that she spoke on his behalf, but he tells her not to worry about it since he's decided he doesn't want the job anyway.  Gus is convinced that the board isn't going to vote for him, especially since he just cut out and decides to go to the cafeteria to get something to eat.  After he's left, Blake comes out and tells Harley that the board has voted on a new CEO.  In the boardroom, Harley is shocked to learn who they picked---her! \n\n\n\n\n",
