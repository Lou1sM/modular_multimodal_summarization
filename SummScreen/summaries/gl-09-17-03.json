Harley was happy about the donation but was concerned Phillip donated the money as a way to distract himself from Lizzie's problems. Harley and Blake are looking for Spaulding employee Lori Jensen who was last seen with Spaulding executive Brad Green. Alan asked Gus to talk to his brother (Phillip) about Lizzie's problems. Edmond asked Beth to consider going to Olivia's baby shower. Beth accused Edmond of wanting her to pursue a relationship with Jeffrey so he wouldn't be available for Cassie. Reva had a conversation with God in the hospital chapel and told him to do the right thing and make Shayne come out of his coma. Alan admonished Brad Green for having an affair with his assistant Lori Green who is half his age. Brad told Alan to find a way to make the mess disappear or he will go public with dirt he has on Spaulding Enterprises. Rick and Mel found out Mel is pregnant."
