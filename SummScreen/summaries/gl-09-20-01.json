The owner tells her that all of the things are available for the right price.  Reva looks at a painting and finds it interesting.  She thinks it has an aura to it.  She tells the innkeeper how her mother have the gift of 'seeing things' and used it to help others even though she could never help herself.  The innkeeper says the 6th sense is inherited and asks Reva if she ever had visions.  Reva tells her that she has always had a strong connection with her children and ex-husband.  She tells the woman about her rocky life with her kids and men and doesn't think that is an indication of her having the gift.  The innkeeper isn't fazed and tells Reva she may just need more time to develop it.  She tells Reva to enjoy her stay and she is there if she would like to talk.  Reva goes to take a nap as she stares back at the painting.  She wakes up thinking someone is with her, the curtains move and Reva calls out to her mom.  \n\n\nIn Chicago:\n\nBuzz catches up with Holly and tells her that he is there to rescue her.  She tells him that she wouldn't mind his company but he shouldn't get any romantic ideas.  They have a seat as the pianist starts to play.  They look over and notice that it is Edmund on the piano.  They laugh as he plays his lounge act and Buzz goes over to taunt him.  Holly and Buzz sit at the bar and pick on Edmund as he plays.  They look over and see Richard on television talking about the future of San Cristobel.  Ed is furious at Holly and Buzz and hates seeing Richard in control.  \n\n\nEd leaves the bar and makes it to the river.  He walks over the bridge talking to himself and to Beth.  A woman comments on his sad state and tells him to go ahead and jump if he wants to.  Edmund looks over and sees a dark haired woman who looks like Beth.   \n\n\nIn San Cristobel:\n\nRichard and Tammy are talking in the garden.  He asks her if she would like a new sibling.  She wonders if her mom is pregnant but Richard tells her she isn't.  Tammy thinks that would make Cassie very happy.  Dax tells Mrs. Mayhew that Richard is considering the adoption, he can tell.  She tells Dax that Richard wants a democracy anyway.  Dax tells her that is only because of Edmund, if another heir was to come forth Richard would feel different and he could act as Regent for the baby if Alonzo doesn't want to rule. No one must know that Alonzo is the true prince until after the baby is adopted. Dax tells Mrs. Mayhew he will take care of the adoption business himself and Cassie will do what Richard wants. Dax interrupts Richard who is showing the stars to Tammy. Mrs. Mayhew comes in with Camille and the baby. Camille tells Richard she trusts him more than anyone on the island and would have voted for him if she were a citizen. She loved SC and thought she loved Alonzo but in reality she only knew him 5 days when she married him. She would still do anything for him but she is not cut out to be a fisherman's wife. She wants to get back to the states but she told her parents she was a nanny and she cannot take the baby with her. She admits that she isn't the mother type. Richard says she has a large problem. Camille says her son deserves so much more than she can give. He deserves to be loved. Richard says yes. He stares at the baby and cannot seem to stop looking at him.  Camille continues to talk and starts to cry.  Richard hands the baby back to her and tells her that she needs to try to care for the baby.  He tells her she has to contact Alonzo and tell him about the baby as well as dissolve their union.  Richard is sure she can leave the baby with social services until Alonzo decides if he wants the baby. Richard offers to buy her a ticket to the States after she does all of this. He tells Mrs. Mayhew to take Camille and the baby home. Dax tells Richard he just let his wife's happiness walk out of the garden.  He saw Richard with the baby and knows he felt something.  Richard tells him that he just had a normal reaction to the baby.  Dax says the baby resembles him. It would be a godsend for Cassie to hold a baby that resembles the one she lost. Richard should let her hold the baby and look into the eyes that look like his. Dax is sure that Camille would be happier if they adopted him.  Cassie comes in and hugs Richard.  She was thinking about the election and the fact that no matter how many children visit the museum, their child will never see it. Cassie buries her face in his shoulder. Richard tells her there is something they should discuss. He tells her that he has been watching how she is coping with the loss of their son. She feels terrible that they cant have a baby.  Richard starts to tell her more when the press comes in and tells Richard that he won the presidency.  Everyone is happy and Richard and Cassie ask for a moment alone and leave.  Cassie is happy that Richard has the sparkle back in his eyes.  Richard just wishes Cassie did as well.  Cassie tells him she can be happy without having another child and hugs him. \n\n\nAt Infierno:\n\nDanny comes in to see Tony.  He talks about his new job and how great things are going.  Danny loves the respect that comes along with his new life and feels powerful.  Danny is really happy.  They talk about Michelle and Robbie and Tony tells Danny that Josh was cleared.  Romeo tells Danny that Tony didn't take any credit for his part and he isn't happy about it.  Danny wraps things up and tells Tony he is heading home.  Just as he leaves, Carlos shows up wanting to talk to Danny.  Carlos congratulates Danny on his new life but reminds him that he can't just leave the family.  Carlos tells Danny he had a deal with him and will honor it, but he didn't deal with the other families. If he does one more favor, they will leave him alone. He has access to Spaulding's finances; Carlos wants Danny to relieve them of $25 million.  \n\n\nAt Company:\n\nMeta, Claire and Michelle are at Company waiting for the guests to arrive at the baby shower. Meta wonders what time the guests will arrive. Claire thinks they are just being fashionably late. Meta doesn't think anyone is coming.  Just then, Maria arrives with gifts, saying her invitation must have been lost in the mail since she is the baby's great grandmother.  Claire tries to get rid of Maria but she isn't leaving. Michelle starts to open her gifts. Meta gives her a framed picture of Maureen. Maria gives another customer her camera and asks her to take a picture of all of them.  Michelle thinks it is about time to leave and she and Meta start to gather their stuff just as Carmen arrives, with gifts.   \n\n\n",
