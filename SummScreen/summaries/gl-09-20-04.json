She asks him to be patient with her since she has no memory of ever making love and this will be like her first time. They are interrupted by a noise outside. It's Michelle's contractor who needs measurements so he can begin working on the renovations the next day. Michelle is excited her plans are moving faster than she expected. She apologizes to Danny that their romance has to be put on hold, but she wants to call Tony with the good news. \n\n\nTammy goes to a bar and orders a rum and coke. Tony is there and congratulates her for bluffing the bartender about her age. She wants to talk but Tony doesn't, telling her he has problems of his own. Tammy doesn't care and tells him she's tired of being good and perfect; she wants to be evil and mean like everyone else in town. Tony realizes Tammy is getting drunk and calls Sandy to pick her up. Sandy arrives and tries to comfort Tammy. She tells him the man she wanted to give herself to has gone and slept with someone else. Outside, someone watches Tammy and Sandy. \n\n\nTony arrives at the lighthouse and Danny accuses him of sending the contractor in an effort to disturb his time with Michelle. Tony denies it, saying he is only there because Michelle called him. Danny tells him whatever he thinks he has going with her he needs to remember Michelle is his wife and that's the way it's going to stay. Inside, Tony tells Michelle he has a surprise for her but she has to leave to see it. Michelle takes the bait and convinces Danny to stay behind with the contractor. Danny suspects Tony is only trying to get Michelle alone but doesn't say so as he glares at him. Outside, Tony confesses he bought Michelle a motorcycle. She is thrilled and wants to learn to drive it right away. Tony is happy Michelle likes her gift. \n\n\nAt the police station, Ross leads Dinah to the interrogation room where he says there are people waiting who could help her. Dinah realizes her audience is going to be Blake and Cassie. In the hall, Reva comments to Ross that he is very brave to let Dinah go in there and face her accusers. He assures her it is not bravery, but belief in his daughter and her desire to rehabilitate. Cassie leaves the interrogation room and joins them in the hall. Reva tells her she is willing to play 'good cop' if it will give Cassie what she needs from Dinah. Cassie is sure Dinah won't pass their pass their test, but will prove she's as hateful as ever. They return to the interrogation room where Dinah is waiting with Blake. Cassie and Blake hurl insults at Dinah while Reva plays devil's advocate hoping Dinah will snap. Dinah admits she once hated Cassie but now only wants to be loved and forgiven. Cassie wonders if Dinah's remorse is real, while Blake refuses the idea and insists she wants to see her rot in prison for the rest of her life. Jeffrey interrupts the gathering, saying they did not get approval from him and Ross can't grant it since he is guilty of aiding and abetting his criminal daughter. \n\n\nLater at The Beacon, Ross tells Blake he can no longer be silent concerning her fury towards Dinah. Though he doesn't want to, he reminds Blake she has always stood by her father, Roger Thorpe, who has a long history of committing heinous deeds. Ross leaves. Blake receives a note from her father saying he will arrive in town on the 28th. She calls her father to confirm his arrival and tells him she misses him and needs him now. \n\n\nAt The Beacon, Sandy is receiving email messages from someone who repeatedly types 'You let him die.' Sandy asks who is sending this and receives the response 'Wouldn't you like to know?' He recalls holding the hand of someone who has just fallen over a cliff. He loses his grip and as the person falls, Sandy screams, 'Jonathan!' \n\n\n",
