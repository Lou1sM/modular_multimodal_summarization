She asks if Sara is there trying to tell her something and if she is there because she knows that mess Reva has made of her life.  Reva reflects on how she is at a crossroads in her life with her children grown and her being further apart from Josh than ever now that she messed up his life.  She feels on her own for the first time and wonders if her mom is trying to tell her where to go from here.  She begs her mom to talk to her.  She hears noises and chimes and sees the book in the corner flip pages.  She goes to look at the book and the lamp above it comes on.  Reva is spooked but goes ahead and reads the passage.  It is about the past never dying and not even being truly past.  She isn't sure what Sara is trying to tell her and asks her to tell her more plainly.  Just then there is a knock on the door.  She goes to the door to find only Daphne, the Innkeeper.  She tells Reva she has a few extra candles in case the power goes out.  She asks Reva if she is acting so nervous because she has been speaking to the dead.  Reva is taken aback that Daphne knows this.  Daphne explains that the Inn was built on an Indian burial ground and is full of spirits.  She watches Reva's reaction and asks her if the ghost she was in contact with was someone she knew.  Reva tells her that she isn't being haunted; it must just be the room.  She goes on to tell Daphne that she thought her mother was there but that she has been gone for many years.  Daphne tells Reva that time is relative. She goes on to explain a little quantum physics to Reva that basically boiled down to the past never really dying.  She thinks that Reva's past may just be ready to revisit her.  Daphne talks about time travel and the past and Reva is getting a little spooked.  She tells Daphne to let her know when she finds the porthole there are some things she would like to change in her past.  Daphne tells her that if she changed one thing it would change everything from the point on.  It could fix one thing, only to make something else bad.  Reva is skeptical about time travel. She asks Daphne how much the painting would be. Daphne was thinking of selling it and is amused that Reva wants it.  They exchange offers on paper, they both wrote $500.  Reva thinks it is a coincidence but Daphne thinks it is kismet and that she and Reva can tune into each other's thoughts.  \n\n\nIn San Cristobel:\n\nRichard and Cassie are in the garden toasting to the presidency.  An aide comes in and tells them the press is getting restless.  They tell the aide to bring them in and Cassie tells Richard she wishes she had good news to tell them about them having a child.  She is upset that she will never get to say that now.  \n\n\nRichard talks to the press about the renovations on the palace and tells them it will now be the presidential home and belong to the people as the White House belongs to all Americans.  Cassie tells the reporter that it will be open for visitors every day.  The lady asks about any plans for children.  Cassie is upset but Richard covers and tells them that they have everything they want right now and are very content with the two children they have.  The press leaves and Richard comforts Cassie.  He mentions adoption but Cassie is against it.  He tells her if they love a child it will be theirs and biology doesn't matter. Cassie says she doesn't want to adopt a child and not love it the way it deserves to be loved. She doesn't want to talk about it anymore and goes to rest.  Dax comes and Richard tells him that Cassie said no.  Dax thinks with time Cassie will change her mind but Richard isn't convinced.  He asks Dax to find the baby a good home.  Richard leaves and Dax tells himself that he has to convince Cassie; the true heir has to be living in the palace.  \n\n\nCassie is in her robe in the garden when Richard comes down.  She tells him that she couldn't sleep.  She tells him that she loves their home and him and they have two children.  She is lucky and she is going to have to start acting like it.  She tells him she is sorry for spoiling his night.  He tells her she didn't spoil anything and kisses her.  She asks if she can make it up to him and he is more than willing to let her do that.  \n\n\nIn Chicago:\n\nEd calls the woman Beth again as she helps him up off the bridge.   She talks with a Country accent when she asks him who Beth is.  He can't believe she is there and goes on to ask where she has been.  The woman checks on Edmund and makes sure he isn't dizzy.  She starts to leave and he asks her not to go.  The woman helps Edmund back to the hotel.  They enter the bar and Ed asks if she has amnesia.  He tells her about the accident and asks if she is ok.  She tells him she isn't Beth and they talk for a while.  The woman tells him that her name is Lorelei and she is from Virginia.  She came to Chicago to become an actress and that is her story.  Lorelei doesn't like that Ed keeps staring at her but he can't stop.  He tells her she looks like Beth but she is nothing like her.  He asks her to stay with him but she declines.  He offers to get her a room in the hotel but she declines his help.  He tells her if she doesn't need his help she should give him his money clip back.  The woman reluctantly hands it over and asks him how he knew she lifted it.  He tells her he thinks on his feet.  Lorelei thanks Ed for the coffee and goes to leave.  Ed gives her some of the money back and thanks her for helping him.  He goes to the piano and starts to sing, \"I've got you under my skin.\"  Lorelei comes back and watches it.  \n\n\nAt Infierno:\n\nDanny asks Carlos if he wants him to steal $25 million from Alan. Carlos says it isn't him or the three families, but higher than that.  Danny tells him to forget it; he won't let himself get pulled back in. Carlos says he should think of it as a redistribution of wealth. Danny wants to meet these people because he thinks it is Carlos and Machado jerking his chain. Carlos denies it. Danny asks him if he is a third rate messenger for some other bosses. Danny tells him there is no deal without a meeting. Carlos tells him to do what he is told or else.  Carlos suggests that Danny take a little money from each Spaulding account and put it in a Swiss bank account. Danny asks if he is supposed to just sit around after that and wait for Alan or Phil catch on. He doesn't want to live the life of a criminal.  He tells Carlos he doesn't have that kind of access to the financial part of Spaulding but Carlos is confident that he can do it.  Danny tells him that he will think about it.  Carlos gives him 24 hours.  \n\n\nAt Company:\n\nMeta tells Carmen to leave or she will call the police. Carmen says that the police know where she is; she is out on bail. No one believes her until she shows them her ankle monitor.  Carmen tells them she is only there because she truly wants to be there for her family and little Robbie.  She tells Michelle not to fear her.  Michelle tells her that her baby isn't there and Carmen will never see him so she should just get out!  Claire tells Carmen she doesn't deserve to see the baby after all she has done. Carmen reminds Claire that she helped her. As they argue, Meta and Michelle are in another world talking about the cake and the Reardon recipes.  Carmen continues to tell Claire that the only reason she did was due to being on bad medication. Carmen rushes over to Michelle and begs to start over for Robbie's sake.  She tries to hand her a teddy bear she brought for Robbie but Michelle isn't interested.  Carmen offers to spend the rest of her life making things up to her and Danny.  Michelle isn't buying the bad medication story. The only thing she thinks of when she sees Carmen is calling 911. She tells Carmen she belongs behind bars and she will never let her be in the same room with Robbie as long as she is still breathing. Carmen says she is sorry to hear that and leaves.  Outside, Carmen says she will have her grandson and her family back.  \n\n\n\n",
