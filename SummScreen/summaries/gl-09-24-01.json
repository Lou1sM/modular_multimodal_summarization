Reva calls Holly for a reality check and she comes over.  She tells Reva that it may be a coincidence but she somehow doubts it.  She tells Reva that she was out with Buzz and she thinks she is going to give the relationship a chance.  Holly leaves and Reva covers the painting and goes to take a nap on the sofa.  While she is asleep she dreams that the woman in the painting steps out and puts a gardenia on Reva.  Reva wakes up and smells the fragrance of gardenia blossoms but sees nothing.  \n\n\nIn San Cristobel:\n\nCassie wants to adopt the baby but tells Camille that she and her husband will have to be involved.  The girl tells Cassie that she has to leave and she has to leave right away.  Dax tells Richard he can cut through the red tape since he is president.  Richard talks to Cassie and they agree it is the best thing for everyone.  They take the baby and Camille leaves.  Richard and Cassie hold their new baby and are happy.   Dax and Mrs. Mayhew watch and are glad that they are happy but hate that to restore the monarchy they will have to hurt Cassie and Richard in the process.  \n\n\nAlonzo asks the bartender about his wife.  He tells him that he missed her and that thinking back, their wedding night was the best night of his life.  He was away at sea and felt that he was missing a part of him. Now he is back and ready to claim what is his.  Camille comes in and thanks the barkeep for helping her the past year and tells him that she is going home.  She is glad to be leaving and hopes that the man won't tell Alonzo about the baby if he ever comes back.  The bartender tells her that Alonzo is back and Alonzo greets his wife.  She tells him that she has to go and tries to leave.  He tells her that he just got back and it isn't fair for her to just leave without saying goodbye.  He grabs her as she is leaving and gives her a big kiss.  She tells him she can't; she has to go home. She runs out of the bar.  \n\n\nAt Company:\n\nDanny tells Carmen that he knows she is behind this. Carmen tells him that she is in trouble with the law and would never do anything to mess up her chances.  Danny thinks she wants revenge on him for choosing Michelle over her.  Frank comes in and tells Carmen that she is a free woman and removes her tracking devise.  Danny can't believe it and asks Frank what is going on.  He tells him that he doesn't know yet.  Carmen tells Danny that she is free because of God.  She tells him about her work with Ray and how she prayed for another chance.  He doesn't buy it.  He thinks she offered him up to the prosecution.  \n\n\nHolly and Buzz are dancing outside company.  They are having a good time and kiss.  Reva calls and Holly has to leave.  Buzz tells Holly he had a great time and she leaves.  Buzz sits on a bench and thinks about his night with Holly.  Sam comes up and asks him if he has ever broken the rules for love.  Buzz tells him of course.  Sam feels terrible for not being totally honest with Marah.  Buzz tells him that love is the most terrifying thing on the planet. It might not be the right thing to do but rather the right person to be with.\n\n\nFrank gets off the phone and tells Danny that Johnny Machado and his group were busted with a mystery witness.  Carmen denies that she is the witness and tells them that she has a lot to live for and she is going to go enjoy her new found freedom. After she leaves, Danny says he thought Carmen sold him out but he doesn't know what to think now.  He thinks the Machado bust is a smokescreen and that Johnny probably owes Carmen a favor.  Carmen of course will have amnesia when it comes to the trial. Frank tells Danny they will go ahead with their original plan. \n\n\nOutside Company, Carmen makes a call and tells someone that she thinks Danny has fallen for her plan.  \n\n\nAt the University:\n\nSam and Marah are kissing.  Sam keeps seeing himself telling him that he is bad for not being honest about clearing Josh.  Sam ignores it and continues to kiss Marah.  Things heat up and he starts to pull up her shirt.  Marah tells him she wants to go slow and make things right.  They kiss some more.  Sam tells her that he doesn't want her to feel she owes him anything but Marah tells him she does owe him.  \n\n\nAfter Sam leaves and Marah gets in the bed, Catalina returns to the dorm room. Marah is happy and asks Catalina how her night went.  Catalina tells her it was fine.  Tony calls and Marah answers the phone.  She hands it to Catalina and listens as Catalina tells Tony how special he made her feel.  \n\n\nAt Infierno:\n\nTony and Catalina kiss.  He apologizes and tells her that he doesn't want to mess things up between the two of them.  Catalina tells him that they should see where this would go but whatever happens he will still be her friend, her best friend.  They kiss again just as Maria comes in.  She tells them that they have her blessing even if they don't want it. Tony gets a call and leaves.  Catalina starts to head back to the dorm but Maria stops her and tells her she likes her style.  Catalina tells her that she will not manipulate Tony; he is free to see whomever he wants.  Catalina leaves\n\n\n\n",
