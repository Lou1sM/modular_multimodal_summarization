Gus was proud that Phillip took time for himself to jog. He asked Phillip if he knew the missing girl, or Brad Green. He said he knew of Green, but didn't know him personally. He later checked Green's personnel file, and asked Alex why she gave the man a 20-year guaranteed contract. Gus tried to get Harley to drop the Jenson case since it was now a police matter, but she said she deserved the same respect as any other private investigator. They made a bet about who could solve the case first. Blake pretended to be an old college buddy of Brad's to gain access to him. Marah pretended that seeing Tony with a date didn't bother her, but when he said he wants her to be happy, she said she is no longer his concern, and stormed out. She told Josh she missed Tony, but was going to concentrate on Shayne; she also said she hated how stubborn her parents were being. Nico figured out that Tony set it up for Marah to see him with Jenny. Tony said Marah would be better off if she hated him."
