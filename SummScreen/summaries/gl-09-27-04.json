JB responded he wasn't planning on having a family anytime soon. Tammy was reluctant until he produced a pack of condoms. Before they could go any further, Reva and Sandy arrived to check on Tammy, concerned she was upset about Dinah's release.\n\n\nJB hid as Tammy answered the door. Reva commented that Tammy looked flushed and asked what was up with the candles and soft music. Tammy said she had been trying to relax. JB sneered outside and wrote \"Hi Mom\" in the dust on the window. Reva and Sandy invited Tammy to go back to Reva's with them. Tammy declined, saying she wanted to be alone to think.\n\n\nSandy and Reva left. Tammy dialed Joey's phone number and discovered it had been disconnected. JB knocked on the door, ready to pick up where they'd left off. Tammy told him she had only been kidding herself -- she was not ready. He said he could wait for as long as she needed. Tammy, relieved, went to put back on the music. When she walked away, JB said, \"Yeah, little cousin, I can wait.\"\n\n\nOn a tip from a patrolling officer, Edmund and Jeffrey raced to where they thought Dinah was holding Cassie captive. Meanwhile, Cassie was threatening Dinah at gunpoint. Dinah taunted her, saying she would never be able to pull the trigger, \"You don't have it in you.\" Dinah managed to wrestle the gun from Cassie and pointed it at her, screaming, \"How does it feel?\" Cassie managed to regain control of the gun, telling Dinah she couldn't win because she didn't have kids to fight for. Cassie fired the gun.\n\n\nEdmund and Jeffrey arrived in the clearing just as Cassie was commenting what a great shot she was to an unhurt Dinah. Edmund begged Cassie to put the gun down, while Jeffrey told her to shoot Dinah, \"Do it! Do it right now! Just shoot her. I'm the D.A. You won't do any jail time -- I promise. Shoot her now!\" Dinah screamed at Jeffrey to shut up. Cassie appeared confused, regained her senses, and lowered the gun. Edmund comforted her and told her she had done the right thing. Dinah mused to Jeffrey that she seemed to draw out the worst in people, even him, based on his little performance.\n\n\nOutside at Company, Harley and Bill welcomed Olivia home from Denmark, where Phillip had tried to have her detained on a false customs violation. Harley pointed out the door where Phillip had put chains and a \"Condemned Property\" sign. Buzz and Coop arrived with Zack. Coop, seeing the chains, announced he would create another entrance. He picked up a brick, broke a window, and unlocked the door.\n\n\nOnce inside, Buzz began preparing lunch for everyone. Olivia asked how Harley had managed to get her cleared at Customs. Before she could tell about Ruth Karloff, Bill interrupted, saying Harley had been brushing up on her detective skills. When Olivia left the table, Harley accused Bill of not trusting Olivia -- even though he was sleeping with her.\n\n\nOutside, Lizzie approached Coop as he was cleaning up the glass. She was looking for Tammy. He made it clear that she -- or any other Spaulding -- was not welcome on the property. He told her to leave. She refused, saying her father's business decisions had nothing to do with her.\n\n\nLater, Bill and Olivia celebrated her work overseas by making love.\n\n\n",
