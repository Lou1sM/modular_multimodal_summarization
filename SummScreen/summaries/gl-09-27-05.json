Tammy is deeply tempted to give in to her own feelings. But unlike Jonathan, she resists and pushes him away just as Sandy appears. After Jonathan leaves, Tammy does her best to overcome her feelings, even though she is touched by a gift Jonathan left for baby Hope. Sandy is on the brink of asking Tammy to marry him but when he hears how important the christening is to her, he decides to wait until it's over to pop the question. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jonathan, stung by Tammy's rejection, retreats to Outskirts to drown his troubles in beer. Jeffrey joins him at the bar, depressed himself that he can't participate in the christening like Cassie wants because of the death threats he has been receiving. \n\n\nMarina is in Edmund's room, searching for clues which would connect him to Michelle's accident. She finds a hypodermic needle but is thwarted when Edmund returns and catches her. Marina, keeping her back to Edmund, manages to escape into another room when Cassie shows up to talk about the christening. Edmund uses the moment to open his heart and 'confess' to his addiction to painkillers. His confession not only touches Cassie, who sympathizes with him and admires his honesty, but convinces Marina her hypodermic needle discovery is useless. However, unable to fight her instincts, Marina does pocket the needle cap and calls a lab to do some tests, leaving Edmund more concerned than ever that he has a problem in her. \n\n\nOlivia, troubled by Harley's recent promotion, reconnects with her favorite nemesis, Reva. She does this in an effort to win her support for Olivia's going to work for Lewis Oil. The two spar but in the end, Reva, who's looking for a new start herself, offers to help Olivia.  \n\n\n",

Sandy tells Tammy that they need to move forward and later tells Reva that he intends to ask Tammy to marry him. After Sandy has left, Tammy breaks down.

He later tries to drown his sorrows at Outskirts where he and Jonathan bond over their hatred of Edmund. Jonathan finds the letter from Dinah that she had Edmund send to him.
