He told Ross he had stopped by to deliver a warning to Dinah to stay away from Cassie. When Jeffrey left, Ross warned Dinah to stay away from Jeffrey and asked if there was anyone else she cared about. Dinah said there was, and later on, she showed up at Edmund's door.\n\n\nBlake was anxiously awaiting Roger's arrival, hopeful that he'd do something about Dinah. A mysterious stranger arrived, and later, when Blake was alone, the stranger called her Chrissy. She turned, expecting to see Roger, but it was not him.

Gus denied it, but later, Beth found out that he was the source of the leak. She decided to tell Phillip, but when she saw him, it was clear to her that he was out of control, and she decided to help Gus. Together, they figured out a plan to save Company by claiming it was in the migration path of an endangered bird. Meanwhile, Marina took Zach to see Phillip, but Zach didn't want to see his dad. Later, Phillip learned about the environmental problems and was furious because he believed the Coopers were poisoning Zach's mind against him. He called Ross and said he needed to discuss his and Harley's divorce settlement.\n\n\nTammy and JB were still close the next morning, despite the fact that she had said she wanted to wait before having sex.

    "tvmega_recap": "Phillip accuses Gus of giving inside information to the Springfield Journal. Beth and Gus come up with a way to save Company. Dinah threatens Jeffery and he calls her on it. Reva and JB have an argument. Blake meets a mystery man, Sebastian, who tells her that Roger is dead. Phillip calls Ross so that they can look over his divorce agreement with Harley. Phillip is in his office reading the local news when Gus walks in wanting to know where Alan is. Phillip shows Gus the paper, and mentions that he's going to have to have a talk with Holly Reade as the headline (\"Corporate Giant set to Bulldoze Local Eatery\") is biased. Phillip tells Gus that it's not so much the headline that bothers him, but that the article talks about a Spaulding insider, Phillip also goes on to mention that the person leaking the information has to be high up. When Gus asks Phillip who he thinks it is Phillip tells him, straight up that he thinks it's him (Gus). Gus looks shocked at this accusation.",
