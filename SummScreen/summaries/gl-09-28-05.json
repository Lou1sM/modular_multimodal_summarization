She gets a shock when she finds out they kissed. Marina is devastated. Danny tries to convince her that the kiss was truly a good-bye kiss and that he does love Marina. Marina accepts his apology but lets him know he'll have to work hard to show her how much he cares. \n\n\nLater, Marina's stunned to find out the drug on the needle cap was the labor-inducing Laprosin. Though she feels she's already losing Danny, she can't ignore her cop instincts and begins running scenarios through her head of what could have happened to the baby. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Edmund is trying to keep his world from falling apart. But he is panicked to hear that Michelle plans on coming to 'his' baby's christening. After unsuccessfully trying to convince Michelle to leave town, he rushes after Marina, suspicious about what she knows. He finds her all alone, on a rooftop. \n\n\nBlake's new romance novel hits the shelves just as Harley is starting her CEO position and Gus has his first day as Mallet's partner on the force.

Danny assures Marina that she is the one he is in love with but she is not so sure. Marina gets the information on what was in the syringe and wonders why Edmund would need a labor-inducing drug. She is unaware that Edmund is following her and out to silence her. Edmund tries to convince Michelle to move on and realize that Danny has done the same and later Danny tells Michelle that they can not go back to the past. Blake's new book based on Harley and Mallet comes out much to Ross and Harley's displeasure and Beth's pleasure. Harley later gives Alex reason to help her with her term as Spaulding CEO. Mallet assures Frank that the book isn't true and uses it as an excuse for he and Gus not to be partners anymore, Frank has a different idea though and tells Mallet to convince everyone that they are the best of friends.",
