He tried to calm her by saying that everyone was fine; it was just a house. Harley realized that Phillip had done it. Just then, Phillip called Harley's cell phone. She told him that she despised him and that he'd pay big. Phillip informed her that what he had done had been legal. She could ask Gus; since he was the head of Spaulding's legal department, he'd know.\n\n\nAfter the call, Gus walked in, and Harley punched him hard in the stomach. She railed at him about what he'd let Phillip do. Gus tried to convince her that he had known nothing. He asked if she would actually believe Phillip's word. Harley didn't believe him. Gus couldn't believe that she'd actually think that he would go and destroy her house. He got upset because he'd been trying to help her for months, and she turned her back on him. He finally told her he was sick of it; she was on her own.\n\n\nHarley and Buzz then left for Company. Harley was ranting that she wanted to kill Phillip. She wanted him dead. Her words concerned Buzz, and he asked if she was unarmed. When she assured him that she was, Buzz told her that she couldn't go and do something that would give Phillip leverage in a custody suit for Zach. He told her she had to play it smart, and Phillip wouldn't know what had hit him. He then went to make her dinner. When he returned, she was gone, but a glass case was left behind.\n\n\nOutside of a bar, Tammy saw a car going right for her. Suddenly, Sandy pushed her out of the way. Although he initially seemed all right, it soon became apparent that he'd been hit. Just then, Reva happened by, and she called 9-1-1 to get Sandy to a hospital. On the way, Tammy called Edmund.\n\n\nEdmund was outside Company with RJ when Dinah walked by. Dinah gave RJ a toy. Edmund clearly wasn't happy seeing Dinah and told RJ that it was a goodbye gift, since he'd never see her again. When RJ asked if she was going away, Edmund said she was not, but she'd be busy. Dinah told RJ that although she wouldn't see him anymore, she'd miss him and would be thinking of him. Just then, Edmund got his call from Tammy. Dinah overheard and offered to go to the hospital too. Edmund refused her offer and left. Dinah decided Tammy could use a shoulder to cry on and went anyway.\n\n\nBeth overheard Phillip talking to Harley and was shocked that he'd had her house demolished. She railed at him and wanted to know why he was doing what he was doing. Phillip told her that he was tired of being weak; he had been before, and it had gotten him locked up and blackmailed into marriage. Beth asked Phillip if he realized what effect he was having on his children. She asked if he thought he was setting a good example for Lizzie.\n\n\nWhile Beth was arguing with Phillip, Lizzie walked in, clearly agitated. Wanting to win his argument, Phillip suddenly asked Lizzie if she thought he was an ogre. After Lizzie defended her father, she tried to get her parents to listen to her, since she had no idea what they were arguing about. Beth told her they were talking about Phillip's vendetta against the Coopers. Lizzie couldn't understand why they'd want to bother with the Coopers; they were all a bunch of jerks.\n\n\nThough Phillip was pleased that Lizzie understood him, Beth was incredulous and tried to tell Lizzie that it was wrong to judge people that way. Lizzie didn't really care. She said the Coopers hated them, so there was no reason they shouldn't hate the Coopers back. In the course of the argument, Lizzie learned that Phillip had had Harley's house torn down. Although she was shocked, she refused to go to the house with Beth; she wanted to stay with Phillip.\n\n\nAlone with her father, Lizzie asked him why he had torn down the house. Phillip told her that he'd had a good reason, and that answer was fine with Lizzie. Phillip then asked what she'd wanted to talk to him about earlier. Lizzie started to get upset, claiming that she always acted out, and when the damage was done, it was too late. Upset and resistant, Lizzie admitted that she had done something bad and stupid. It involved Tammy, and it was awful. She then proceeded to tell Phillip about seeing Tammy outside the bar, thinking she had been with Joey, and stepping on the accelerator.\n\n\nSandy was being rushed into Cedars. He was seriously hurt and could hardly breathe. He kept trying to tell Reva something. He told her there was something important she needed to know in case he didn't make it. However, his injuries were too severe, and he couldn't get it out. As he was being wheeled into the operating room, he tried to whisper something to Reva, but she couldn't make it out. Being led away, he asked for forgiveness.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Tammy was leaving a message for JB, to tell him about Sandy. Unbeknownst to her, Edmund was watching her from behind a wall. Edmund then saw her, and she admitted to him about being at the bar and the guilt she felt because that car had been headed for her. Later, Dinah arrived and was there when Rick told Reva that a portion of Sandy's liver had been damaged, and he'd need a partial transplant. When he suggested that they needed a compatible donor, Dinah volunteered. A skeptical Reva says she'd take anyone's help she could get, but she was sure a relative would be a better match, such as herself.\n\n\nSandy was asleep in his hospital room. JB was suddenly right there at his side.\n\n\n",

Edmund is called and stands by Reva's side while Sandy is in surgery. Tammy tries reaching JB, who is ignoring her calls. Harley blames Phillip & Gus for destroying her house and vows to get revenge on Phillip. Beth sides with Harley and tells Phillip that she doesn't know what he's thinking anymore. Lizzie tells her father that she needs to confess something.",
