Harley and Gus are in Las Vegas on a police investigation and they stop at a casino. She gambles and then they run into Billy and Reva who are getting married. Reva asks them to be witnesses and they do. But, during the ceremony, Reva backs out during the vows. She tells Billy that she is sorry, but she cannot lie to him and to G-d. She realizes later, in her room alone, that she will never be married to anyone but Josh. Meanwhile, Josh and Cassie finally make love. RJ arrives much later and they tell him they are dating. He is cool with all of it."
