He is dumbfounded when Lorelei emerges from the bathroom wearing an exact replica of the gown worn by Beth for her and Edmund's wedding.  She explains that she surfed the web and found a website all about Eddie and Beth and was able to order a knockoff gown, and watch the wedding.  Lorelei displays her aptitude for Beth's speech patterns by reciting Beth's wedding vows to Edmund.  Eddie just stands there stupefied.   \n\n\nAfter changing out of Beth's gown, Lorelei is wearing another \"Beth\" type outfit.  She can remember all of the pertinent information on all of the citizens that are important to Beth with the exception of Phillip, who she refers to as \"Freddy.\"  Lorelei can't figure out why Phillip's name is such a mental block for her.  Eddie leaves her to concentrate while he goes out to get her some more food for her unending appetite. Meanwhile, Phillip comes to the door at the Springfield Inn after garnering the information that Edmund is back in town from Alan.  Phillip hears someone moving around in the room (Lorelei), and bangs on the door demanding that Edmund let him in, or he will knock down the door. \n\n\nIn San Cristobel , Cassie and Richard are getting ready for the Christening. Meanwhile, Dax instructs the driver to bring the limo for him, and tells Mrs. Mayhew that he is going to tell Alonzo about the baby, as the most important thing is to save the monarchy.  Mrs. Mayhew tries unsuccessfully to talk Dax out of it, pointing out how devastating it will be to Cassie and Richard to loose another child.  Dax takes off to find Alonzo anyway. \n\n\nCassie talks with Richard about how she is uncomfortable about the way the adoption was handled, as she does not know if she can trust Camille's word that the father really didn't want the baby.  She does admit that she really wants the baby and thanks Richard for making her see it.  A knock on the door interrupts them, and Mrs. Mayhew comes in.  Richard thanks her for bringing the baby to them and asks her to be part of the ceremony.  She accepts. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Dax arrives at the bar, and finds out from the bartender that Alonzo had re enlisted with the Merchant Marines, since Camille dumped him.  Dax is on his way out when Alonzo walks in.  Dax tells Alonzo that he has news for him that will change his life. \n\n\nCassie is explaining to Tammy about her job as a role model for her two little brothers. Richard cannot understand where Dax is, and Mrs. Mayhew goes to look for him.  When Dax arrives, Richard asks him to be baby William's Godfather.  Dax is speechless, but eventually accepts the news and the Christening begins.  Suddenly, the doors burst open and Alonzo announces that the baby is his. \n\n\nBlake is having lunch at Company with Holly.  She is filling Holly in on finding Ross in his classroom with his arms around Tori, and all of the circumstances surrounding that.  Holly questions her about being jealous, which Blake adamantly denies.  After a little more prodding by Holly, Blake finally does admit she was jealous, but has come up with a way to solve everyone's problems by offering Tori a job as Ross's legal assistant. That, she says, will give Tori her tuition, and free up Ross's time so he can spend it with Blake. \n\n\nReva comes into Company lugging a mountain of books on American Civil War Art History.  Blake is fascinated with the story of the \"Olivia Look alike\" portrait story. Blake and Reva begin to talk about past lives, and Blake explains the circle of friends around a person won't change through past lives, and can be used to help solve problems in the current life.  She suggests trying to go back through hypnosis, and agrees to hypnotize Reva at Reva's house.  Reva, Holly and Blake leave and go to Reva's house to see the portrait, and get started on the hypnotism. \n\n\nAt Reva's house, Blake begins the hypnotism with candles, incense and meditation.  Blake is really serious and into it, but Reva is struggling to stifle a laugh.  Blake instructs Reva to stare into the candles, and then at the portrait and say the first thing that comes to her mind.  Reva says \"Spaghetti\", Blake says perhaps Reva was Italian in a past life... Reva says no, that is what she is going to make Shayne for dinner.  Blake then suggests word association, but Reva doesn't think that will help either.  Reva apologizes to Blake and Holly.  Holly thinks that Reva needs to put the portrait in the attic and forget about it... but Reva can't.  She has to find out the connection it has to her.  Blake and Holly leave. \n\n\nReva returns to the living room and continues to stare at the portrait.  As she leans over to pick up something from the floor she notices something in the portrait that she had not seen before.  She goes upstairs. \n\n\nReva returns with her locket that was a gift from her mother Sarah, that Sarah said was bought new, and not an antique.  Funny thing, it is an exact duplicate of the locket in the portrait with Olivia.  Reva reaches out to the portrait to touch the locket and her hand goes through the portrait. \n\n\nWhen Olivia enters Towers to meet Josh for dinner, she sees that Alan had beaten her to it.  She flashes back to her night of passion with Alan.  Alan tells Olivia he was updating Josh on his and Olivia's relationship. She is momentarily panicked.  Alan continues to tell Josh about Olivia getting private investors for the Harbor Project, and that he is now a minor player. When Josh answers his cell phone, Alan tells Olivia that she may not need him for the money, but she will be back in his bed. \n\n\nAs Josh returns, she overhears Olivia telling Alan that he doesn't know what she wants, and Josh questions the statement.  Alan covers by saying that Olivia wants what they all want... for the Harbor Project to proceed.  Alan continues by praising all aspects of Olivia as a businesswoman, making Olivia extremely uncomfortable. \n\n\nJosh questions why Olivia wanted to cut ties with Alan.. and who the new investors are.  She pussyfoots around the questions by saying that the new investors wish to remain anonymous.  Josh says that since he owns the company that he would really like to know.  As Josh keeps pushing the subject, Olivia gives him very vague answers about the investors being from a web company that was going down, being from the west coast, and not being completely organized as a group yet... this seems to satisfy Josh, for the time being. \n\n\nAt another table, Alan peruses the documents he pilfered from Olivia's brief case earlier.  The papers do not reveal the names of the investors, but Alan calls someone to research it.  They can't come up with the answers, yet, but Alan swears he will find out who the investors are. \n\n\nBack at Company, Michelle comes in to meet Danny.  She has several bags with her, one containing a sexy negligee.  After some small talk, Danny explains to Michelle that Carmen is free, and that she is the one who orchestrated the set up against Danny. That is why he is not going to steal the money from Spaulding.  He surmises that this is the deal that Carmen made with the Feds to get her \"Get out of Jail Free\" card.  Upon hearing that Carmen is free, Michelle starts to worry about Robbie.  She gets up to go outside to call Meta to check on him, but runs into a suspicious looking guy in a black leather jacket.  Upon returning to the table, she points the guy out to Danny.  Danny thinks she is being paranoid.   \n\n\nMichelle tells Danny that   while she was on the phone, she called Carmen and requested that Carmen meet them at Company.  Danny isn't very happy, but the suspicious guy in the leather jacket appears to be.  Michelle explains to Danny that she thinks if she pushes Carmen hard enough, that Carmen will slip and expose herself.  Michelle gets up and goes outside to await Carmen's arrival, and the suspicious guy in the leather coat fingers the holster on his gun. \n\n\nCarmen arrives at Company.  Danny comes out after Michelle, but is pushed aside by the suspicious guy in the leather jacket who is pointing the gun in the direction of Carmen and Michelle. He exclaims, \"This is for Johnny Marchado!\"\n\n\n",
