Rocked, Sandy runs out unseen and throws himself into his work. In his haste and emotional state, he ends up getting electrocuted and is rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Josh immediately notifies Tammy, who guilty and shocked, breaks away from Jonathan and races to Sandy's side. As Cassie struggles to tell Michelle the truth about the baby, Jeffrey confronts Edmund. Edmund realizes Cassie is on the verge of telling Michelle and interrupts them. After, Cassie wants to hear Edmund's story. Jeffrey reluctantly allows it, but only so he can find Michelle and get a DNA sample and find out once and for all if she's Hope's mom. But, Michelle has already left for the airport with Danny, Marina and Robbie. There are bittersweet partings for all and Danny promises to visit his little boy as often as he can. After Michelle and Robbie go, Jeffrey arrives too late. While Michelle and Robbie fly away, Danny and Marina set off together and, despite her curiosity about why Jeffrey needed to see Michelle, Marina allows herself to believe that she and Danny at long last have a future. Meanwhile, Cassie listens to Edmund's version of the truth. He tells her that the baby isn't hers but that she also isn't Michelle's. With a mixture of truth, lies and desperation, he talks about getting the baby from the black market and tries to play on Cassie's love for Hope. When Jeffrey returns, regretfully saying that the DNA proof will have to wait, Cassie holds onto the slender thread of hope that Hope, whoever gave birth to her, will always be hers.  \n\n\n",

Cassie tries once more to tell her until Edmund comes outside, warned by Jeffrey that Cassie knows the truth. Michelle sneaks out to go to the airport. Jeffrey goes after her but is too late.

Tammy insists that she is going to marry Sandy but Jonathan doesn't believe her and they fall into the hay, undressing. On his way to get Tammy to propose to her, Sandy sees Tammy and Jonathan and runs away to the job site he is working on with Josh.

Sandy is electrocuted and Josh calls Tammy to tell her to get to the hospital right before Sandy stops breathing.
