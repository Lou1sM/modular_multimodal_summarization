While on the mission, they discover an abandoned baby. Social Services cannot take the baby for a while, so Harley takes the baby home. Between Harley, Gus and the boys, Zack and Jude, they name the baby Gracie. Gus is enamored by the baby and Harley seems to like her a lot, too. The baby keeps them up almost all night long and the next morning is a comedy of errors getting the boys ready for school. Later at the station, Harley calls Gus at home, who is taking care of Gracie, and tells him that he needs to contact Social Services. Later on, Gus finds the grand mother of the baby, whose real name is Sydney. Gus and Harley are sad. They start talking about babies and after a whole day of back and forth, go home, to bed, and decide they want to have a baby together."
