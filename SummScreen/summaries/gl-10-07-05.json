As they dance, he tells her how much he loves her, how grateful and honored he is that she stuck by him through everything. All this talk freaks out Marina. She just can't believe everything's worked out alright. She's still worried about Michelle, about whether Danny's love for her will override what he feels for Marina. She then wonders if, when Michelle and Robbie were boarding the plane, Danny had wished he was going with them. Danny admits that he did and apologizes. Marina tells him it doesn't matter; she's just happy he decided to stay with her. Danny assures Marina his feelings for Michelle only centered on the baby she lost. At that moment, Mallet arrives to speak with Marina about Edmund. Realizing that Danny has no clue about this, Mallet makes a hasty retreat, leaving Marina to confess she did some investigating about the baby Michelle lost, but now the case is closed. Danny's speechless since Marina did all of this in secret without telling him. Marina assures him that she had good intentions; she only wanted to know the truth. Danny's touched, especially because he knows how hard this must have been for her. She had to know this could have changed everything. He's touched she'd put Michelle above their relationship. Marina replies she didn't do it for Michelle, she did it for him. That baby girl could have been his and she couldn't live with herself if she kept him away from his daughter. As for Michelle, she just wanted her to go away. Danny is still touched by her admission and confesses his love for her. \n\n\nAt Cedars, Sandy flat lines and Tammy is escorted out of the room. Out in the waiting area, she runs into Jonathan whom she is not happy to see. As Sandy's heart starts up again, Tammy tries to get Jonathan to leave but he doesn't want her to be alone. His presence isn't comforting at all though; it's making her upset. Tammy states that she will never forgive herself for what happened and demands that he leave. Jonathan refuses and Tammy tries to convince him that she's staying with Sandy now. Her guilt over what they did starts to annoy Jonathan and he tells her she should break a rule once in a while, maybe she'll get what she wants. Tammy refuses to listen and tells him what happened between them was a mistake and Sandy suffered for it. Jonathan retorts the only mistake was denying their feelings for so long. Sandy could have gotten off the hook a lot sooner. Jonathan tries to convince her that Sandy's accident was just an accident, what they did was not. Tammy's very upset and Jonathan tells her to stay, because he knows she'll hate herself if she doesn't. He doesn't feel guilty about what happened in the barn and tells her it will happen again. Tammy tells him it won't. When she's told that she can see Sandy, Tammy tells Jonathan she intends to marry Sandy. Jonathan tells her she's crazy but then kisses her and tells her that he'll be there if she needs him. A little later, inside Sandy's room, a very emotional Tammy prays to God that if he lets Sandy recover, she will never see Jonathan again. \n\n\nAn angry Edmund is at the farmhouse replica desperately looking for Dinah. Unknown to him, Dinah is hiding, hoping that since he thinks she's gone, he'll leave the door unlocked when he leaves. After failing to get information on Dinah's whereabouts from Ross and Bill, Edmund gets a call from Cassie asking to speak with him. Thinking Dinah's with Cassie, Edmund rushes out. To Dinah's frustration, the door locks behind him. \n\n\nEdmund rushes to the real farm, relieved Cassia has not seen Dinah. Cassie informs Edmund he is no longer Hope's father any more. Edmund infuriates Cassie by acting as if he has no clue why she's so upset. Cassie tells him that Jeffrey is running a DNA test on Hope. She wants him out of her life completely. That's why she's not pressing charges against him; she wants it all to stop right now. Edmund agrees to leave but tells her that everything he did he did for love. He reminds her that her house and her baby are a product of his love for her. The only reason she's with Jeffrey is because he has Richard's face. \n\n\nAt the police station, Mallet gets a file on Edmund. Though he's ready to send it back since the case is closed, he decided it couldn't hurt to look it over. \n\n\nAn upset Edmund returns to the farm replica with gasoline in hand. He's convinced that Dinah is out there somewhere. He is desperate to destroy any evidence of her being held captive. When he rushes out of the house for something, again with the door locking behind him, Dinah is able to run and grab his cell phone and go back into hiding before he returns. Edmund pours gasoline everywhere and then sets the place ablaze. \n\n\nAt the real farm, Cassie finds Jonathan skulking around the barn. She tells him that she wants to talk about Tammy - she knows what he did. Jonathan's a little surprised until it becomes apparent that she's talking about Dinah not being pregnant. She thanks him for not using that knowledge against her and not telling Tammy. She asks that he keep the news from Tammy. Suddenly, Cassie gets a call - it's Dinah! \n\n\n\n\n",
