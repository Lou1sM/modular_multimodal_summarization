The bartender tells her he's called someone to get her. Suddenly, Edmund enters.  Edmund has no idea why he's been called to the bar since the bartender just found Edmund's number in Dinah's coat and never told Edmund her name.  Edmund tries to get Dinah to come down, telling her that she's blowing the second chance she's been given. Figuring she just loves attention, a disgusted Edmund turns to leave but is lured back when Dinah mentions Cassie's name.  When Dinah, who seems about ready to do a striptease, starts telling the bar patrons all about her lousy week last week, Edmund suddenly snatches her up and carries her out of the bar.  \n\n\nOutside, Edmund starts to lecture Dinah asks if she has any idea what could have happened. She accuses him of just being afraid she would spill the beans about Cassie threatening her life.  She suddenly gets pensive and asks Edmund how he did it.  How did he go from the town pariah to a good guy? She then breaks down in tears, declaring that she has all this anger and doesn't know what to do.   Edmund immediately softens toward her and gives her the keys to his apartment at Towers.  He tells her she can stay there until she pulls herself together. He then gives her some money for a taxi ride and tells her that if she's serious about changing, she needs to believe that she can be the person she wasn't to be.\n\n\nSebastian goes to the farm and meets Cassie, who's heard about him from Blake.  He mentions that he'd like to see his half-brother's farm.  When Cassie lets him in, Sebastian comes right out and asks her why Dinah is walking the streets a free woman?  Cassie tries to explain the situation, but Sebastian shrugs her off saying that he's a complete stranger, she doesn't have to explain herself to him, he's just worried since Dinah is unpredictable. He then asks to meet his nephew.  While Cassie goes upstairs to get RJ, Sebastian starts snooping around, looking for something.  After Sebastian meets RJ, Cassie declares that she has to go to the hospital.  He decides to hang around a bit and talks to RJ about his grandfather.  He tells RJ that he'll make sure that RJ knows what kind of man his grandfather was. He tells RJ he's in town to claim their birthright and maybe get some revenge. He then takes out his gold coin and asks RJ if he's ever seen one like it, perhaps one his daddy had?  RJ tells Sebastian about the hiding place that Dinah showed him.  Sure enough; the coin is there.    Sebastian asks RJ to keep their discovery a secret.  \n\n\n\n\nWith Sebastian gone, Dinah arrives at the farm.  Alone, she starts \"talking\" to Hart. She tells him she has good news--she got to Edmund just like Cassie got to Hart.  Her plan worked and now she's going to see how Cassie likes it.\n\n\nWhile at Company looking at family photos, Michelle has another memory of Maureen.  Tony walks by, and seeing her expression asks if she's remembered something.   Michelle tells him about the few memory flashes she's had of her mother.  When Tony asks if she would have mentioned anything to him if he hadn't have walked by, she says probably not.  She tells him that she likes their relationship as it is and is afraid that telling him of her memory flashes might change things.  Michelle then states that a part of her is afraid of getting her memory back since she may lose who she is now.  Tony tells her not to worry about that, to hold on to the good memories and still hold on to who she is.  She asks him if he thinks Danny is happy with who she is now?  Tony can't really speak for Danny though.  Michelle confides that she hopes Danny is happy with who she is, because she won't be second best to the old Michelle. At about that time, Sebastian enters and introduces himself to Tony. Spotting the pictures, he mentions Michelle's dad, Ed, and how he and his father were enemies.  Later, when Michelle and Tony leave the table\nfor something, Sebastian laments that it isn't right--Roger's dead and Ed's still alive.\n\n\nReva's keeping vigil over Sandy who's still in his coma, while JB/Jonathan watches from outside the room.  Later, when Reva is in the hallway, in her wheelchair, JB/Jonathan approaches her, making Reva very uncomfortable. Suddenly Tammy happens by, and seeing the tension, she leads JB/Jonathan away.  JB/Jonathan apologizes to Tammy for his behavior.  Reva just reminds him of his mother.  She was a selfish woman who cared for no one but herself.  Meanwhile, the bank manager has arrived to speak with Reva.  He tells her of the conversation he had with Mr. Lewis about the fact that Sandy was not her son.  Reva puts it all together and realizes that Sandy intercepted the call and he knew from the beginning that he wasn't Jonathan.  Later, Reva discusses the situation with Cassie.  She can't understand it.  Cassie suggests that Sandy was just after money, but Reva is confused since he had ample opportunity for that and yet declined it.   Reva suddenly gets the idea that the answers may be in Sandy's computer.  Cassie agrees and asks Tammy to retrieve the computer but alone with Tammy JB/Jonathan volunteers to do it himself.\n\n\nStill in his coma, Sandy starts having a nightmare.  In his dream, Jonathan confronts him about stealing his life.  In the dream, Jonathan accuses Sandy of not trying very hard to save his life on that cliff.  Jonathan knows that Sandy came to Springfield to tell everyone about him but he was too much of a coward.  In the dream, he states that what Reva did was unforgivable.  Reva then appears in the dream and Jonathan pushes her off the cliff while a horrified Sandy watches.  \n\n\nBefore giving Sandy's laptop to Tammy, Jonathan deletes the emails he sent him and doctors one up.  Later, while Reva is looking though the computer, she finds an email supposedly from Marissa.  The email states that her son is missing and was last seen on a hiking trip.  She wonders if there was an accident and asks if any John Does were reported? Reva suddenly concludes that Jonathan must be dead, and knows that Sandy knew it all along.    \n\n\n",
