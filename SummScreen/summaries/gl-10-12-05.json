    "tvmega_recap": "Jeffrey offers Edmund a deal that he won't press charges if Edmund leaves town and Cassie and Hope for good. Edmund refuses to take it. Mallet arrests Edmund and makes him wait around the hospital with him, much to Edmund's chagrin. Ava calls Bill and lets him know his dad is drinking again. Bill confronts Billy and later when Reva takes over Billy explains that seeing Bill's embarrassment over his drinking is what made him realize how bad what happened was.
