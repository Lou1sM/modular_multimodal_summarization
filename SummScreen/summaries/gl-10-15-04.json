A phone call to Switzerland seems to bring results when an old friend of Sandy's returns her call. \n\n\nWhat Reva doesn't know is that Jonathan is the voice at the other end of the call, deliberately misleading her and fueling her fears. Later, Reva decides to take serious action and asks Jeffrey to investigate what really happened to Sandy Foster and Jonathan Randall. \n\n\nGus conducts his interview with Ruth to see if she is the security leak at Spaulding. Harley is nervous at first, worried Gus will see through her disguise. He takes an interest in Ruth's personality while his instinctive defense of Harley and his love for Zach touch her deeply. Harley realizes she's going to have to work harder to keep Gus from catching on but when she turns for help to her partner, Bill, he has other plans. \n\n\nIn an effort to thwart Phillip's plans to deport Olivia, Bill brings Jeffrey to the jail to perform a wedding. Alex sees it as a chance to help the woman who has promised to help her as well. Though it might be all business for Bill, Olivia, whose feelings for him have developed, believes a real marriage might result. Jeffrey remains skeptical and refuses to be manipulated into breaking the law. But when Bill makes his appeal, he wins Jeffrey over and gives Olivia even more hope for a happy ending. \n\n\nThe newlyweds take the news of their marriage to Bill's dad, but no one could be more stunned or outraged, since it was Billy and not Phillip who arranged for Olivia's deportation! Billy, in an effort to steer Olivia clear of real estate, the Lewis office building and especially Bill, made a Phillip-style move and tried to have her deported. His efforts, he learns to his great regret, have backfired and only thrown the couple closer together. \n\n\n",
