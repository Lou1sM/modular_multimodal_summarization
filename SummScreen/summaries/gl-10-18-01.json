    "soap_central": "\n\nCivil War Era Reva goes back to the present through the painting.  Staring at the painting, she asks what just happened.  Reva is still trying to figure out if it was all a dream when she is interrupted by a knock at the door.  It is Felicia, who has been trying to reach Reva for hours.  Reva tells Felicia about her time travel, and together they try to figure out an explanation.  Felicia encourages Reva to try to go back through the painting while she is there, but Reva can't.  Reva tells Felicia about the affair between Regina and Col. Hudson, and how they are the same likenesses as Olivia and Alan. After Felicia leaves, Reva starts to wonder if perhaps the present is reflecting the past, and if Olivia and Alan are having an affair.   She thinks that it has to be something more than that.  She spies a book on the end table about New Orleans.  As she is looking through it, she sees something shocking. She bookmarks the page and heads out of the room. \n\n\nOutside Company, Rick and Mel are discussing their relationship.  Mel tells Rick that she is breaking it off before it can go any further.  Rick tries to talk her out of it, but she won't listen.  She says that Rick has the baby and Harley living at his house now, and there isn't room for further complications.  She kisses his cheek and says goodbye. \n\n\nIn the Bauer kitchen, Gus tells Harley that she came back to Springfield for the same reasons that she left... because of him.  She says that she left to get away from Buzz and Frank's meddling. Gus tells her that he was expecting her to come back, but she replies that it was a spontaneous decision. He tells her that she came back for him, and that he cannot be convinced otherwise. She asks him if he is nuts, tells him that he is delusional, and that she is not in the mood for his mind games.  She tells him to leave, but he won't.  He tries to get her to admit that their \"almost kiss\" the night after the trial meant as much to her, as it did to him.  She says it was all sympathy.  Harley flashes back to the night in question.  She remembers how she touched his check and he touched her hair.  She becomes more defensive after this, and calls him a self-absorbed jerk.  A flash of pain comes over his face.  Harley stalks across the kitchen and he comes up behind her and touches her on the neck.  She turns to him and tells him he needs a hobby.  He starts talking very softly, remembering that night, and getting closer to her.  She closes her eyes, and leans into him.  They kiss.  When she realizes what she is doing, she pulls away.  She accuses him of taking advantage of her when she is confused and weak.  She denies responding to his kiss.  She says she fell forward in exhaustion.  Again, she orders him to leave.  He leaves his card, and says that she knows where to find him.  And, that he knows she will. \n\n\nHarley is asleep at the kitchen table when Gus comes over to her. They kiss passionately ... but it is only in her dreams.  Harley awakens to keys in the door--- it is Rick.  Rick brings in the baby supplies from the store.  He tells her that his paternity leave has been covered.  Harley asks Rick if he knows why she came back when she did.  He responds that she returned in order for the baby to be born in Springfield.  Harley says that she has come to a decision that will be good for the baby.  She asks Rick to marry her. \n\n\nJosh barges in on Alan at home.  Alan is his usual charming self.  Josh says he is there to return the money clip that Alan left at his apartment.  Alan plays innocent.  Josh accuses Alan of trying to lure Olivia away to Spaulding.  \"Is he talking business, because it is starting to sound personal,\" states Alan. Josh says that Alan always thinks he can buy anything that he wants.  \"Everyone has their price,\" retorts Alan.  He asks Josh how well he REALLY knows Olivia, because it takes someone like him to appreciate her special qualities.  Alan advises Josh to leave it alone.  He then tells Josh that Beth is alive and back in Springfield, and that has made him believe anything is possible.  Alan admits his interest in Olivia.  He challenges Josh for Olivia...his power and influence versus Josh's love.  \"May the best man win.\"  Josh replies that the best man has already won. \n\n\nReva goes to Alan's with book in hand.  She runs into Josh on his way out.  He accuses her of snooping into the Harbor Project again.  She says that she is not exactly there for that purpose... she is there looking for the truth. \n\n\nAt Tony's birthday party, Romeo tells Marah that he is her hero, not Sam.  She doesn't believe him.  She tells Romeo that Sam wouldn't lie to her.  He challenges her to ask him.  Marah interrupts Sam dancing with Catalina, and asks to speak with him privately.  She tells Sam that she has been told a lie about him, and she needs verification that it is untrue. \n\n\nTony explains to Romeo, that he had to let Marah find out about Sam's deceit so that Sam would leave town alive.  Meanwhile, Marah pushes Sam for an answer. Just as he is about to tell all, Ray comes in with the birthday cake for Tony.  Tony makes his wish and blows out the candles.  He says he hopes that wish comes true. \n\n\nSam does admit, with tears in his eyes, that what Marah heard was true.  He explains that he tried many times to tell her the truth.  That he only did it because he wanted to be with her.  He says that he is not a hero, he is just Sam, and Sam screwed up. He swears that he will never keep the truth from Marah again.  Marah asks Sam, if the hero wasn't him --- who was it?  He says it was someone that didn't want her to know. She pushes him and he admits that it was Tony.  Catalina is horrified that Sam told Marah.  Marah looks over at Tony, who is standing in the doorway\n\n\n",
