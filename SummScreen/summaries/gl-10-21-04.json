    "tvmega_recap": "Cassie argues with Tammy about her going camping with J.B. and finds out that she loves him and has already slept with him. Dinah maneuvers Edmund into coming to Jeffrey's suite while he is out. She pretends to be breaking into Jeffrey's safe for money so that Edmund will feel sorry for her and find a picture of Richard and Cassie (which she says is Jeffrey). She also tells him that when she sleeps with Jeffrey, he calls her \"Cassie\". Jeffrey sees the two of them in his suite and is curious, but she covers it up. Reva and Josh are upset about J.B. Reva goes to Cassie and tells her that he is really her son, which disgusts Cassie. She prepares to tell Tammy the truth. Jonathan visits Sandy in his hospital room; he taunts him and roughs him up, then ties him to his bed with his restraints and gags him. Sandy is frantic to save Tammy from going off with Jonathan. Josh meets with Jeffrey to ask him if he can have Sandy and J.B. arrested, but he doesn't tell Jeffrey any reason so he can't. Josh also visits Sandy and takes out the gag. When Reva returns home, Jonathan is waiting there for her.",
