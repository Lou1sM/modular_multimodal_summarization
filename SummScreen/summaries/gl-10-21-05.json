After mocking Sandy, Jonathan shows him the note he found on Sandy \"I found you.\"  Jonathan tells Sandy that he's sniffing around into his background and he'll figure out what Sandy's hiding.  When Jonathan walks out, Sandy gets a call from his lawyer, Fallon, telling him that Ava is at the Beacon.  Sandy immediately calls Ava, who's just found out from Tammy that Sandy is moving in with her.  Sandy tells Ava to meet him up on the hospital roof.  Later, on the rooftop, Sandy tries to convince Ava that he's changed.  He tells her that he's met someone and plans to marry her.  He asks her to make things easy for him and Ava says she will on one condition - he give her the ring.  Sandy refuses since that's the ring intends to give to Tammy.  He tries to offer her cash, but Ava insists that she wants something that really matters to him.  Suddenly, Fallon arrives and Sandy tells him to give Ava anything she wants to get her out of there.  He then leaves.  Fallon attempts to buy off Ava, but she refuses to budge stating that she wants to show Sandy that there are some things money can't buy.  Just then Jonathan (hot off a conservation with Tammy in which she told him he would just be her friend and nothing more)  arrives on the roof and sees Fallon with Ava.  Ava and Fallon try to make like they don't know each other, but Jonathan's not buying it.  When Fallon leaves, Jonathan demands to know how Ava knows Sandy and his lawyer.  An upset Ava warns Jonathan to stay out of it, but he just presses harder.  Ava is getting more and more upset, leading Jonathan to think that Sandy hurt her.  She tries to tell him that she can't risk it but Jonathan continues to badger her, asking her how he hurt her. Ava blurts out that he married her!\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tammy has taken Sandy home to the Beacon where he asks her to marry him.  \n\n\nCassie is outside Company saying a premature goodbye to Hope.

Apparently, Dinah ditched him by lying to him that she was going to be with her father.  Dinah promises to make it up to him by buying him a sandwich and goes inside Company while Mallet stays outside and talks with Cassie.  After a while, Mallet realizes he's been ditched again.  \n\n\nAt the Bauer cabin, Michelle is frantic because Edmund has just knocked out Danny.
