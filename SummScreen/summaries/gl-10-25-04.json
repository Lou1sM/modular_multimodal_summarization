An INS agent appears and mistakenly assumes Harley is Olivia - the new Mrs. Bill Lewis. Once he discovers Bill is enjoying a beer with a friend the agent hints that Bill's marriage was a sham to save Olivia from deportation. Bill denies this and assures the man his blushing bride is working and he will be with her later. The agent departs but not before telling Bill to expect a visit from INS soon as they intend to investigate the marriage. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Tammy storms into Sandy's room and slaps him. Sandy tries to apologize but Tammy won't hear it and cries while telling him if not for his lies JB would never have gotten to her. Josh walks in and embraces Tammy. Josh berates Sandy for lying to his entire family about his true identity. Sandy tries to defend himself by saying he loves the Lewis family, but Josh won't allow it and tells Sandy it's his fault Tammy was seduced by the monster JB. He advises Sandy to leave town immediately so the Lewis family can begin to repair the damage caused by Sandy and JB. Josh leaves to find Reva. Sandy is considering Josh's words when he turns and finds Lizzie in his room. Lizzie says she needs to tell him something about the night of his accident. Sandy doesn't wait to hear her confession but rushes to tell her she is quite possibly the only friend he has left in Springfield. Lizzie is confused by Sandy's remarks until he comments everything could have been different if not for 'the freak' that hit him and left him to die. Noticing Lizzie's agitation Sandy admits he is not Reva's long lost son, Jonathan. Lizzie stares in disbelief as Sandy tells her the real Jonathan has been living in Springfield and going by the name JB. Though shaken, Lizzie remarks she wants to talk about the accident just as Harley appears in the doorway. 'What about the accident, Lizzie?' she asks. Lizzie makes an excuse and hurries to leave. Harley is puzzled at Lizzie's behavior at the mention of Sandy's accident.  \n\n\nAt the farmhouse, Cassie and Edmund are calling everyone they know to try to locate Tammy. Cassie is afraid that because she told Tammy she lost her virginity to her own cousin it will lead her daughter to even more danger. Edmund and Cassie decide to go to Farley's Bar to look for Tammy. Once at the bar, they see Danny and Dinah getting cozy on the dance floor. Cassie is upset to see Dinah with her hooks in a friend of hers and warns Danny to stay away from Dinah - who can only bring trouble for him. Danny tells Cassie he is a big boy and can take care of himself. Cassie and Edmund leave to continue their search for Tammy. Danny ignores Cassie's advice and asks Dinah if she wants to leave with him. Dinah agrees but disappears as Danny pays the bill. \n\n\nAt the Lewis house, JB is clutching Reva by the throat as he recounts the beatings he endured as a child. Reva dares her deranged son to do it - 'finish the job!' JB relents and releases his mother. Reva tells him she knew he couldn't hurt her because 'you're my son!' Reva begs JB to believe she had no other choice but to leave him when he was a baby in order to keep him safe. JB becomes emotional as Reva describes his treatment of Tammy as despicable. She grabs his hands and puts them around her throat again and challenges him to hurt her - not more innocent people. Josh walks in to find JB standing over his wife and screaming at her. In a rage, Josh flings JB across the room, jerks him around like a doll and tells him if he ever sees JB with another member of his family he will rot in prison for the rest of his life. JB tells Josh his beef is with Reva and warns Josh against making an enemy of him. Josh is unfazed and tells JB to get out of his house. \n\n\n",
