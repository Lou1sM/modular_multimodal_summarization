But she lets her true intentions show when she pulls a gun on him and declares that his time has come. At the last second, Mallet arrives, having had her tailed. He eventually gets her to lower her weapon. Edmund demands Dinah's arrest, but Mallet informs him the gun is a fake and that no charges can be filed. After Edmund manages to escape, Mallet puts Dinah in the car to take her back to town. Dinah realizes Mallet covered for her so she wouldn't face jail time. \n\n\nMichelle and Danny are in the Bauer cabin, trying to deal with the enormity of being parents again and what it means for all involved. Michelle's overcome by it all and as Danny comforts her, Marina arrives. The moment is full of tension with no one quite able to articulate how much things have changed between them all. With the spare tire Marina's brought, Danny's able to repair his car. The three of them head out, back to Springfield and Cassie and Hope, to find out what the future holds for them. \n\n\nAlan encourages Beth to go to the Spaulding shareholders' meeting and switch the promotional video with the video he has of Mallet and Harley kissing in the warden's office. She starts to get cold feet, but Gus comes and unknowingly gives her what she needs to go through with it when he patronizingly suggests she let him help her get an annulment.

    "tvmega_recap": "Beth likes the video Alan has given her that shows Mallet and Harley kissing but later questions the ethics behind it. Alan finds her change of heart funny and later; Beth switches the disc that Harley had for her presentation with the one that Alan gave her. Harley is embarrassed when Mallet finds her naked, after she was thinking that Gus was coming home for a quick game of \"Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Cop\". He jokes with her but later has to crawl out the window when a reporter is outside of Harley's room. Mallet later comes to Edmund's aid when Dinah pulls a gun on him, but refuses to arrest Dinah for any wrongdoing. Michelle and Danny can't leave the cabin since Edmund slashed their tires and discuss what will happen now that they know that Hope is their child. Marina, upon hearing that Edmund got out on bail, goes to the cabin to find them in an embrace. Michelle thanks Marina for never giving up on finding her baby and says that now she can put her family back together.",
