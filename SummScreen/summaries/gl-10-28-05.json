She bristles at what she sees as another man trying to control her, unable to see the good guy who has her best interest at heart. Meanwhile, Edmund finds a way to use Halloween to mask his appearance so that he can sneak into the jail to see Alan. Both men need the other in order to put their own desperate plans into motion. Edmund narrowly dodges discovery when Dinah and Mallet appear at the jail but later, he and Alan have forged an alliance. Cassie throws herself into the holiday spirit, not just for RJ's sake but to keep her own mind off the loss of Hope. Reva is there to help her, and tries to get her to confront her feelings. But, Cassie ultimately admits that she needs a kind of help she can't get from her sister or even from Jeffrey. Later, she calls upon an unlikely source for comfort - Dinah. Knowing what her mother is going through, Tammy is all the more eager to marry Sandy and create a stable, happy life for herself and her family. Which would be great for Sandy, if only Ava would agree to the divorce. A divorce is just what Jonathan urges Ava to go for, telling her that by setting Sandy free, she will have a fighting chance of winning him back. What he doesn't tell her is that he is setting up Sandy for a fall so that a heartbroken Tammy will turn to Jonathan for support. Later, when Ava signs the divorce papers, Jonathan tells Tammy and Sandy he wants to throw them an engagement party.\n\n\n",

He meets her at Outskirts after she calls him and he puts off Tammy's plans to elope and they sign the papers. Jonathan goes to Tammy's and offers to throw her and Sandy an engagement party. Reva helps Cassie deal with things by showing her an anger management trick. Pretending a pumpkin is Edmund she smashes it and agrees it makes her feel better. Reva tries to get her to smash another one thinking of it as Dinah and Cassie says that she is not as upset with Dinah since she can kind of understand why she did what she did. Mallet throws Dinah into the cell with Alan until he can move up her court appearance where he is \"put in charge\" of making sure that Dinah doesn't screw up again. She can't figure out why he is sticking up for her. Edmund dons a disguise and visits Alan at the jail where he asks for more help getting Cassie back. He hides when Mallet comes in with Dinah. Alan and Edmund agree to work together.",
