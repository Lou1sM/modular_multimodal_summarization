Reva tries to ease his fears by lying that she put his hands on her throat\u2014she proclaims that she knew he was making an empty threat.  Josh doesn't seem to be buying it though and reiterates that she should forget all about her son.  Just then, there's a knock at the door--it's Sandy.  He asks for 5 minutes to talk to Reva before he leaves town.  He tries to tell Reva that Jonathan wants to hurt her.  Just then, there's another knock at the door--it's Jonathan.  Although Josh tries to throw him out, he reminds Josh that Reva invited him.  Jonathan then tells Reva he only came to tell her to back off and stop harassing him.  He then urns to leave, but Reva asks him to stay, leading a disgusted Josh to leave the house.  Sandy wants to stay in the room with Jonathan and Reva, but she's able to convince him to go upstairs so she and Jonathan can be alone.  When alone, she asks Jonathan why he's so determined to fight her.  He brushes her off and tells her he's not, he could care less about her; he just wants his trust fund.   Reva tries to tell him that she wants to make up for everything he went through, but Jonathan is less than moved.  When some trick-or-treaters knock at the back door, Reva leaves the room.  While Jonathan's alone, Sandy comes down the stairs and tells him to leave Reva alone.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, Josh has arranged a meeting with Edmund to talk about the Jonathan problem.  He wants ideas on how to get rid of Jonathan.  Edmund asks Josh how he thinks Reva would feel about that.  Josh doesn't care, all that matters is protecting Reva.\n\n\nTammy sees a Lizzie outside and accuses her of setting her up with JB, her own cousin.  The revelation amuses Lizzie more than anything else and her ridicule causes Tammy to slap her.  Soon the pair is arguing, with Lizzie telling Tammy she's desperate to be trashy like her mom and Tammy calling Lizzie sick and alone like her father. \n\n\nJeffrey meets Cassie at the farm.  She wants to talk to him about taking legal action against Jonathan.  Jeffrey informs her though that nothing can be done since the sex was consensual.   He does tell her that his office will keep a very close eye on Jonathan.  A frustrated Cassie then tells Jeffrey that Dinah could have stopped it since she had the opportunity to tell Cassie about Tammy and JB.  She then brings up the picture of her and Richard that Dinah and Edmund found in his safe. Jeffrey brushes it off by explaining that that picture was a part of his old investigation into the drug scheme in San Cristobel.  Cassie can't understand why Jeffrey would be interested in a troublemaker like Dinah; he tells her he has a thing for danger and leaves.  \n\n\nDinah sees Tammy who is visibly upset.  Dinah has just learned from Cassie about Tammy's situation (since Cassie laid all the blame on Dinah for not telling her anything).  Dinah shows concern for Tammy, asking if she's okay.  She tells Tammy she's sorry about what happened that night and tells the teen that if she had known who JB was, she would have kicked him out herself.  She tells Tammy that she wants to help, to make\n\n\nup for things.  She suggests helping Tammy get revenge on Jonathan, but Tammy isn't interested.  Dinah then suggests that Tammy needs to go for a long drive to clear her head and offers Tammy her car keys.  Tammy accepts the offer and later calls Cassie, telling her she has to get out for a while and not to look for her.\n\n\nLater, Cassie gets a call from the manager of the strip joint she used to work in Chicago.  The person on the other line says she needs to verify her daughter's age since she's looking for a job there.

After they trade barbs, Dinah informs him that Tammy's in Chicago.  He thinks she's lying, but she assures him she's not.\n\n\nAt Towers, Phillip's on the phone telling someone to take care of Ruth. Right after his phone call, a concerned Beth and Alan arrive for their dinner.  Beth tries to talk to Phillip alone about her concerns regarding Lizzie.  She knows Lizzie is upset about something and she asks Phillip what it is since she knows Lizzie has been confiding in her father.  Phillip tries to tell Beth that it's nothing, but Beth is unconvinced and keeps telling Phillip she wants to know.  He tells her it's better that she not know and assures her he has it under control. Later, Alan talks to Phillip on the balcony where Phillip makes a comment about Lizzie and feeling guilty.  Alan then wonders if Lizzie has done something.  Phillip tells him she has but he's going to handle it on his own.  Alan tries to convince Phillip to let him help, but Phillip insists he can handle it himself.  Soon after, Phillip meets with an ominous-looking man.\n\n\nHarley, dressed as Ruth, is looking on the Spaulding grounds for Phillip's car but there's no trace of it now.  Suddenly, Gus catches her snooping.  He tells her he's on to her and tells her to stop playing games.  \"Ruth\" suggests that he must know why she's there---to  gather as much information on Mr. Spaulding to use against him.  She then asks Gus point blank, what would he do if he found out Phillip had done something terrible life-threatening?  Would he turn him in or protect.  He doesn't answer her, but he does give her a warning that she's playing with fire But \"Ruth\" assures him that she can handle herself.  Suddenly, Phillip calls \"Ruth\" and tells her to pick up Lizzie at Pharley's bar.  She agrees and then tells Gus not to follow her.\n\n\nHot off her run-in with Tammy, Lizzie arrives at Towers and starts talking to Alan and Beth about her past.  She mentions Carl and suggests that her getting sick was punishment for what she did.  They both try to reassure Lizzie that there was no connection between her leukemia and shooting Carl.  Lizzie then goes on to say that she's done bad things. Seeing that Lizzie is upset about something, Beth tells her she can tell them anything, that nothing bad will happen to her.  Suddenly Lizzie states she's worried about Phillip and asks what's going to happen to him?  But before she can say anything, Phillip approaches her.  She hugs him hello and he tells her he had to take care of some things.  He tells her there's nothing he wouldn't do or risk to protect his little girl.\n\n\nGus meets with Phillip at Towers and asks him if he knows where Ruth is. Phillip tells him he has no idea.  Gus suggests that perhaps Ruth is the mole.  Phillip doesn't act too concerned, in fact he flat out tells Gus he thinks he's mistaken about Ruth and tells him he has the utmost trust in her.  Nonetheless, he does give Gus permission to keep investigating her.\n\n\nHarley is at Pharley's waiting for Lizzie but no one's there.  Suddenly a car comes speeding toward her! \n\n\n",
