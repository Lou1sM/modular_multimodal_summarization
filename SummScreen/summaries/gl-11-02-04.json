Edmund offers to go with her to lend support but she refuses, saying he is the reason Tammy left in the first place. Edmund is hurt by Cassie's statement but understands his past misdeeds may have led Tammy to sleep with her revenge-seeking cousin. Cassie assures him Reva will help her find Tammy. Jeffrey arrives and offers his support to Cassie, but is also refused. Dinah, hiding in the shadows, watches as Jeffrey follows Cassie. Edmund is pouring himself a drink when Dinah enters and tells him Jeffrey and Cassie left together. He doesn't believe her until he calls the Lewis house and Josh confirms Cassie has been there and left already with Jeffrey at her side. Dinah sidles up to Edmund and tells him she understands his pain and attempts to kiss him. Edmund shoves Dinah away and asks her to leave. \n\n\nDinah refuses to leave and asks Edmund what he intends to do. He remarks that killing comes to mind. Dinah assumes he is talking about Jeffrey but Edmund corrects her. It is Jonathan whom he wants to kill for causing Cassie to revisit a past she had put behind her. Dinah tells Edmund it's not in him to kill anymore. He assures Dinah she has no idea of what he is capable. Now that he knows what it is like to have a family of his own, he will stop at nothing to preserve it. \n\n\nAt the Lewis house, Reva is preparing a dinner for Jonathan against Josh's wishes. He begs Reva to see reason where her son is concerned but she insists she has to try to make up for the hurt she caused by leaving him with abusive parents. Jonathan arrives for dinner and immediately begins a campaign to harass Josh. In an attempt to control his anger, Josh leaves the room to get dinner started. Jonathan asks Reva what it's like to go through every single man in one family and still manage to get 'knocked up' by a prince. Reva refuses to take the bait and continues her attempts to appease Jonathan by insisting she can make up for the past. Josh returns and the three sit down and begin their meal. Josh grows even more outraged when Jonathan makes snide comments about the pretty women in Paris referring to Marah and the possibility he may pursue her in the same way he did Tammy. \n\n\nCassie arrives to enlist Reva's help locating Tammy but is shocked when Jonathan answers the door. She asks Reva what the 'sick freak' is doing there. Reva rushes to her and explains she is trying to fix things. Cassie is disgusted and tells Jonathan she will personally rip him apart with her bare hands if anything else happens to Tammy. Jonathan responds that Tammy didn't get anything she didn't want. Jeffrey arrives in time to stop Cassie from attacking Jonathan. Cassie glares at Reva and says she can't believe she is protecting that monster. Reva wants to go with to find Tammy, but Cassie tells her to 'forget it. You made your choice.' When Reva follows Cassie to the door, Josh slips his wallet in Jonathan's bag. Jonathan leaves and says they won't be seeing him anymore. Out of earshot of Reva, Josh calls the police to report a stolen wallet. \n\n\nAt the police station Ruth, accompanied by Gus, is attempting to file a police report for the attempted hit and run when Phillip emerges from a conference room. Phillip realizes what she is doing and convinces her to speak to him in private. Ruth agrees but insists Gus remain with her. Inside the conference room Ruth tells Phillip she believes he was behind the attempt made on her life. She plans to press charges unless she gets what she wants - Spaulding Enterprises. Phillip laughs at this until Ruth mentions Lizzie, at which point he begins to seethe. He tells Ruth she had better leave is daughter out of this. Ruth, undaunted, tells Phillip she is convinced Lizzie knows something about the accident involving Sandy Foster and she intends to find out what it is. Phillip, shaking with rage, tells Ruth he is deadly serious about Lizzie and remarks accidents like the one that almost killed her can happen again at any time. Ruth leaves and reminds Phillip she is unafraid of his threats and she will be sending all the information she has to her attorney. \n\n\nOnce Ruth is gone, Phillip questions Gus' loyalty to the Spaulding family. Gus reminds Phillip it was he who saved Alexandra from the police. Phillip remains suspicious until Gus tells him Ruth Karloff is the Spaulding mole and has been working with Bill Lewis to dig up dirt on him. Gus tells Phillip he will represent him if Ruth brings any action. But Phillip has to tell him anything he knows about the car which hit Sandy. Gus reaches in his pocket and turns on a tape recorder. Phillip doesn't give any information about the accident but agrees when Gus says he will pay Ruth off and put her on a plane. \n\n\nLater, at the Beacon, Harley, out of disguise, thanks Gus for keeping her secret. He tells her Ruth has to disappear to throw Phillip off of her trail. Harley gives Gus the bag containing her disguise and he hurries to the airport to put in plan in motion to deceive Phillip. Harley calls Bill and asks him to bring some clothes and a back-up wig. Ruth needs one more outing. \n\n\n",
