Things are tense between them since Harley isn't exactly happy about what Dinah did to Cassie. Dinah insists she had good intentions and was trying to do something good, but Harley thinks that doesn't change the fact that she lied about being pregnant. Soon, Dinah turns the conversation to Harley's love life. She refers to Blake's book and seems skeptical Harley didn't want to turn to Mallet for comfort while she was in prison. She's convinced Harley still has a thing for Mallet, but Harley denies it. Finally they're ready to go upstairs and Dinah asks if Harley believes the girl she was - the one who delivered Harley's first baby - is still in her, Harley begrudgingly says, \"Yes she is.\" The pair has seemed to bond and they talk a little about old times and how much easier life was back then. When they finally get to her office, Harley informs Dinah that she will find her a job at Spaulding. A grateful Dinah thanks Harley and promises to help and protect her. \n\n\nReva arrives at a darkened Company and starts talking to Buzz about her relationship with Josh. She reveals that while they did sleep together, she doesn't think she wants to get back together with him. She admits she's been jealous of Josh's being around Olivia lately. Buzz wonders if Reva was just marking her territory. Reva's not sure, but admits that while they were making love it didn't seem like they were back on track; it felt like they were saying goodbye. Reva tells Buzz she wants to go out in the world and just be Reva Shayne, but she also wants Josh to be there waiting for her when she gets back. But now she's worried that Josh will think their latest encounter means they're back together. Reva admits she's just not ready to settle down. Buzz tells her that she could be throwing away a wonderful thing and she could be sorry. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Josh is in the parking garage with a visibly upset Cassie. He gets in the car with her and gets her to tell him why she's upset. She tells him it's because she's stuck in her life, stupid and selfish. Josh deduces she's upset over Hope and tries to reassure her that everything will be alright; the pain will eventually go away. He makes her feel a little better and they start discussing Reva and him. Josh admits they had a breakthrough but doesn't think that means they're back together. He tells Cassie his whole life always revolved around Reva, and he doesn't know how it'd be otherwise. He tells Cassie what he really wants is for Reva to settle down with him. Later, after talking about how Reva never has a plan, yet Cassie loves to make them, Josh suggests that Cassie make Hope a part of her life. He gets her to call Danny. Talking to Danny about Hope seems to help her, especially when he gives her the go-ahead to call anytime. Cassie thanks Josh since now she has hope; it's just different. Suddenly, Josh's cell phone rings-it is Reva telling him she's at Company. Josh is a little miffed since they agreed she'd stay at the suite. Reva tries to convince him that he doesn't have to meet her at Company, since the power has just come back on, but Josh is determined. However, when he gets there, Reva is gone. Buzz warns him to be careful. \n\n\nTammy's alone, locked in the bridal shop, since the clerk left to go to the warehouse and never returned. While looking at herself in the mirror, Tammy is startled to see Jonathan outside the door cage looking at her. He tells her how good she looks in the dress. He just wanted to find her so he could drop off her ring. Jonathan picks up on Tammy being tense, and she admits she's a little afraid of the dark. She doesn't like being trapped in the store alone and tells Jonathan she wants out. Jonathan succeeds in breaking through the door cage but before Tammy can leave, he stops her. He asks her to model the dress for him and she complies, although it's obvious his presence is having an effect on her. Tammy starts complaining that she forgot her shoes; she's been forgetting everything. She says she doesn't even have her vows done yet. Jonathan offers to help her by suggesting she practice her vows on him. Tammy's a little uncomfortable and starts. The vows start out dry, since she's talking about how Sandy makes her feel safe and she lists all his good qualities, but they end up being more romantic the longer she looks into Jonathan's eyes. When she's done, Jonathan gently takes his turn to recite vows and all but declares his love for her. Things are getting too intense for Tammy and she demands that he leave, but he refuses to leave her alone in the dark. When she insists, he carries her out of the store himself. \n\n\nMarina and Michelle are both stuck in an elevator at Towers. Things are a little tense between them, so Michelle tries to thank Marina for spending so much time with Hope. Marina shrugs it off and comments that it's good practice for when she and Danny have kids. The comment startles Michelle and soon the pair begins discussing Danny, or rather who he is really in love with. Michelle tries to get Marina to see that he just turned to her because he needed a break, but Michelle is his great love. Marina refuses to back down. Just then the lights go back on and the elevator starts to move. Before getting off, Michelle tells Marina that she wants her to find true love; she shouldn't settle for less. Finally, Michelle goes to Danny's and tells him that she and Marina talked about him. Danny asks what exactly they talked about. Michelle's response is to give him a passionate kiss. \n\n\nFresh from her confrontation with Michelle, Marina goes outside and almost gets hit by a car while she's crossing the street. The driver gets out, seeing if she needs any help. She responds that he's under arrest. \n\n\nThe instigators of the power failure are outside Towers - Alan and Edmund. Alan boasts about what he'd done but Edmund's upset because he didn't get to \"rescue\" Cassie like he wanted. Alan tries to get Edmund to think more positively. Finally, the lights come back on and before they part ways, he tells Edmund to finish what he started. Later, Alan shocks the police who've been searching for him by returning to his cell. \n\n\nCassie has finally made it to the bridal shop to pick up Tammy, however she's gone. Unknown to Cassie, though, Edmund is lurking outside. \n\n\n",
