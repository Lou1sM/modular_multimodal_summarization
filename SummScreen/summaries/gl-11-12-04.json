After exchanging angry words, he presents her with a peace\noffering---a new dress to wear.  Although she refuses it, he leaves it\nin the cell with her and then walks out.  Later, he's pleased to see\nthat she has put on the dress.\n\n\nTammy is laying low at Sandy's.  He tries to tell her that she has to go\nback home some time but she doesn't want to and begs him to let her\nstay.  Suddenly, there's a knock at the door.  Sandy can tell from the\npeephole that it's Reva and she's about to let herself in.  When Tammy\nhides herself, Sandy lets Reva in and asks what she wants.  She states\nthat she thought he left town and she wanted to know if he left a\nforwarding address so she knew where to get in touch with him.  She\ntells Sandy that she just wants to hang on to their friendship.  Sandy's\nnot interested though.  He tells her that he lied to her from the first\nday he met her and that he's nothing to her. He suggests that she cut\nher losses before she gets too invested.  Reva tries to explain that he\nis important to her but he rejects her.  He tells her that she'll never\nbe able to fully trust him and she will eventually just cut him loose.\nWhen he shows her the door, a saddened Reva tells him she'll never\nbother him again.  At that point, Tammy exits shocked that Sandy just\ncut Reva out of his life.  He assures her that it's for the best.  He\ndoesn't want to talk about Reva though.  He tells Tammy she has to\nconsider her next move since she can't hide from her mother forever.\nWhen Tammy refuses to call her mom and then leaves the room, Sandy pulls\nout Cassie's number from his shirt pocket and considers it.\n\n\nDinah literally (and purposely) runs into Edmund at the Beacon.  When\nshe mentions Cassie and Jeffrey being in Chicago together, the pair\nsuddenly walk in.  They didn't find Tammy.  Edmund tries to ask Cassie\nwhy she won't let him help her, but she only gets upset and accuses him\nof being jealous and paranoid about Jeffrey. Clearly upset, she tries to\nexplain that she just wants to concentrate on finding Tammy and doesn't\nwant to constantly reassure him.  But to Edmund it seems as if she's\nshutting him out.  He thinks her problems should be their problems, but\nCassie doesn't agree.  Suddenly, Dinah inserts herself and calls Cassie\nas selfish as ever.  She defends Edmund, calling him caring and loyal,\nand states that Cassie is taking him for granted.  She then mentions\nthat Edmund helped her when she first came to town, without even knowing\nwho she was.  This clearly shocks Cassie and Edmund confirms the story.\nHe knew Dinah as \"Dee\" and offered her a place to stay.  Cassie is very\nangry now.  Suddenly, she faints!\n\n\nIt's 9pm.  Buzz is outside Company waiting for someone and spots Alan.\nSuddenly they both notice something inside Company.  They enter and are\nshocked to find Phillip, unconscious from multiple gunshot wounds!  The\ncall an ambulance as Gus enters.  When asked why he's there, Gus\nmentions that Harley was to meet Phillip at 9pm.  Suddenly, Beth and\nLizzie arrive, again having been told to meet Phillip.  As the\nparamedics and police arrive, the group realizes that now no one knows\nwhere the kids are.  Buzz finds a piece of paper in Phillip's coat but\nFrank takes it as evidence.  By this time, Rick has arrived, as have\nBill and Olivia.  Olivia puts it all together and angrily states that\nPhillip scammed them.  She states that Phillip offered her a deal--meet\nher at 9pm and he'd tell her where her daughter is.  She correctly\nguesses that everyone in the room got the same deal.  She guesses that\nit was all a set up--that Phillip had no intention of giving them the\nchildren, he just wanted to watch them all squirm as he backed out of\nthe promise.  She tells the paramedics to keep him alive long enough to\ntell them where her daughter is and then he can go straight to hell.\nShe then leaves.   Outside, she runs into Jonathan who asks her where\nthe gun is?  She's shocked that he knows about Phillip and he claims\nthat he overheard the cops talking.  He seems to think she shot Phillip\nand is impressed that she had the nerve to do it.  He mentions their\nconversation the night before where he told her to do something; Olivia\nwarns him that that conversation never happened.  He tells her not to\nworry, her secret is safe with him.  She suddenly wonders if he did it?  \n\n\nAfter his conversation with Olivia, Jonathan runs into Reva who has just\nheard about Phillip.  They talk and she tells him Sandy told her to get\nlost.  She thinks Jonathan should be gloating--he won now.  Jonathan\nstates that he has good reason to hate Sandy, but she says Sandy says\nthe same about him.  When she defends Sandy, Jonathan reminds her that\nit was Sandy who hurt her.  He starts to say something else, but thinks\nbetter of it and leaves.\n\n\nBack in Company, Gus is trying to locate Harley by phone but she's not\npicking up.  Lizzie is guilt-ridden and tells Beth that if she would\nhave gone on that plane, this wouldn't have happened.  Beth assures\nLizzie that this isn't her fault.   Later, the group, except Gus, goes\nto the hospital, only to learn that Phillip is dead.\n\n\nGus is skulking outside Company where he spots Harley, dressed as Ruth.\nHe grabs her, and she is clearly dazed and rattled.  He asks  her where\nshe's been and she responds that she thinks she did a terrible thing.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Buzz and Alan found Phillip shot and bleeding on the floor at Company. Everyone arrived that Phillip had told to meet him at 9 (except for Harley), including Gus, Beth, Lizzie, Olivia, Rick, Frank, and Bill. Alan accused them all of wanting to kill Phillip and vowed the killer would be caught as Rick and the EMT's worked on Phillip. Olivia told Alan that she hopes Phillip dies for what he did to them. They all realized that he played them all off one another. Buzz and Olivia worried about where their kids are. Gus worried about where Harley was and snapped at Frank. Harley arrived late and, when hearing that Phillip was dead, told Gus that she did a bad thing. Lizzie blamed herself for not getting on the plane. At the hospital, Phillip's family and friends waited, and then the doctor told them that Phillip had died. Reva visited Sandy's place, thinking he might have left town, hoping to still be friends with him, but he told her there is nothing between them, which hurt her feelings. Sandy consoled Tammy, who is hiding out in shame. Jonathan wondered to Olivia if she shot Phillip and hinted he might have done it himself. Later, Reva told Jonathan how much she cared for Sandy, how upset she was at what Sandy said to her and about Phillip's being shot. Cassie and Jeffrey returned from their trip to Chicago, having had no luck in finding Tammy. Edmund was jealous of their being together and upset that Cassie seems to be pushing him away lately. Cassie snapped at him that she doesn't have time for his jealousy right now. Dinah let slip to an outraged Cassie that Edmund met her when she first came to town. Meanwhile, Holly tried to escape her prison by feigning unconsciousness but Sebastian stopped her. He brought her a new dress to wear. After throwing it back at him, she put it on and played nice to her captor.",
