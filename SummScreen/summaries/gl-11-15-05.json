After putting up a brave front by telling Coop she understands, a dejected Lizzie leaves Towers. Soon, Quinn approaches and Coop thanks him. Quinn notes that now it's time for Coop to live up to his end of the bargain and wash dishes. After calling Buzz, asking him to cover for him should he see Lizzie, Coop gets to work bussing tables. Unknown to him, a depressed Lizzie has re-entered the restaurant. She's noticed by Quinn who invites her over to his table. Lizzie insists she should leave, but Quinn invites her to share a dance with him. On the dance floor, he suggests they go to his parents' house to soak in the hot tub, but Lizzie declines. She is shocked to literally bump into Coop. He is forced to tell her that he's bussing tables for the night due to lack of money. He wonders if Lizzie's angry. She says she's fine, but she is a little angry that Coop lied to her; she had assumed he was simply ditching her and that had her almost in tears. Realizing he'd hurt Lizzie's feelings, Coop apologizes and tells her they need to resolve to always tell each other the truth. After their talk, Coop goes back to work. \n\n\nLizzie receives a call from Dean which she takes out on the roof. Dean demands the money by tomorrow. Quinn overhears the exchange. When Lizzie's off the phone, Quinn approaches her and apologizes for insulting Coop earlier. He gives Lizzie some money, telling her she can do whatever she wants with it. She tries to decline, but he insists that she keep it. \n\n\nJonathan is asking Reva to help him stop Tammy's wedding. Reva is reluctant to help him and tries to tell him to just let Tammy marry Sandy. Jonathan reminds her that Tammy doesn't love Sandy. This discussion is really upsetting Reva. She tells Jonathan this will tear apart the entire family. Her apparent refusal upsets Jonathan who feels she's taking everyone else's side over his. Reva denies this and tells Jonathan of the rough childhood Tammy had. She tells him what Tammy needs now is security, someone who will keep her safe and give her a house with a white picket fence. Upset, Reva wants to know if Jonathan can provide the dependability Tammy needs and has in Sandy. Now Jonathan's upset because he thinks Reva doesn't think he's good enough for Tammy. An angry Jonathan can't see why she just won't help him win the girl he loves, but Reva is extremely concerned about what this will do to Tammy and Cassie. Reva tells Jonathan that she's not totally refusing to help him; she just needs time to think. After asking Reva what she really knows about Sandy, Jonathan angrily reminds her that HE is her son and storms off. \n\n\nWhile talking with Buzz outside CO2, Ava spots Tammy and Sandy, who are outside discussing their wedding. Sandy leaves to do something at home, and Tammy sees Ava. She approaches and asks her to help her pick out a wedding present for Sandy. Tammy sees a tense look on her face and assumes it's because Ava thinks she's too young to get married. Just then, Jonathan happens by and after hearing that Tammy's buying a gift for Sandy, volunteers to help. Tammy declines the offer. Jonathan chats with an uncomfortable Tammy about her upcoming wedding and asks if she's having second thoughts. Tammy says no and Jonathan tells her that he's happy for her and walks off. The tension between the two isn't lost on Ava. She asks Tammy about it. Tammy's not really forthcoming with an answer, and Ava tells her that Jonathan seems to care for her. Ava unnerves her by saying Tammy is special to Jonathan. Seeing her reaction, Ava asks if she's having any doubts about marrying Sandy, but Tammy states she's not. When Tammy starts praising Sandy, Ava points out Jonathan is a good guy himself. Tammy suggests that Ava and Jonathan could be good together, but Ava insists they're just friends. Ava believes Jonathan has the hots for Tammy. Tammy denies having any feelings for Jonathan and tells Ava she wishes he'd move on. A little later, Ava and Tammy are looking into a store window and spot a small silver box and an antique watch. Ava suggests Tammy buy Sandy both - he can use the box to store all his antique watches. This piques Tammy's interest - how did Ava know Sandy collected antique watches? \n\n\nFresh from her conversation with Jonathan, Reva goes to talk with Sandy. After asking if he's sure about marrying Tammy; is this marriage what he really wants? Reva starts to talk about her first marriage. She said she went into it for all the wrong reasons. She tells him that several days before her wedding to Billy, his dad offered her an \"escape route\", stating if she had any doubts he'd help her get out of the wedding, no questions asked. Of course, Reva was too stubborn to take him up on it. Sandy figures out Reva is there to offer to be his \"escape route.\" He declines the offer and insists he loves Tammy. He spouts that he wants to spend the rest of his life making her happy. Seeing how adamant Sandy is, Reva drops it and asks if he has any family coming to the wedding. Sandy says no. Reva tries a different tact and states if he's having any doubts at all, the wedding can always be postponed. But Sandy insists that almost losing his life has shown him he doesn't want to waste any time; he wants to get married ASAP. \n\n\nJonathan is now nursing his wounds over at Company. He overhears Blake talking to a couple, the Bakers, about a house she's selling. When Blake's alone, Jonathan walks over and after seeing a picture of the house, tells Blake he wants to buy it. When she points out that he blew through his trust fund, he states he got an inheritance from his adoptive father. Blake doesn't want to sell to Jonathan and refuses since she already has buyers lined up. But when Blake leaves for a second, Jonathan walks over to Mr. Baker and threatens him into getting a different house. When Blake returns, the Bakers rush out, claiming they've changed their minds. Blake still refuses to sell to Jonathan since she thinks he's playing games with her. Jonathan finally gets upset and angrily demands that she accept his bid for the house. He leaves and overhears Reva telling Sandy to go and marry Tammy. Jonathan approaches Reva and says he'll win Tammy without her help - anyone who gets in his way will get hurt. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Lizzie thinking Coop doesn't want to be with her starts to leave the dance but is stopped by Quinn. Coop is told by his friend who helped get him the tickets that he needs to start washing dishes to pay for the help he got to get Lizzie to the dance, which is why he blew her off in the first place, embarrassed by his lack of money. Lizzie and Coop run into each other thinking the other has left and promise to tell each other the whole truth from now on. Buzz talks to Ava about opening his new place CO2, Sandy and Tammy's wedding, and Olivia. Later he goes to Towers to help Coop out. Jonathan tells Reva that he is her \"real\" son and if she loves him she will help him, she goes to Sandy and asks if he really thinks that he is making the right decision and offers him an \"escape route\". He refuses her help and Jonathan comes across this and thinks Reva is taking Sandy's side against him yet again. After Reva's talk about what Tammy needs, Jonathan puts money down on a house. Tammy asks Ava's help in picking out a wedding present for Sandy, which leads to her slipping that she knows him better than anyone thinks.",
