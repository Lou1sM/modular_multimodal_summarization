They've planned a bachelorette party for her, complete with a scavenger hunt-style \"list\" of crazy things for her to do. Before the party, Tammy assures Sandy that he has nothing to worry about but when her night begins, she begins to let go, needing to get everything out of her system before she can commit to Sandy. Meanwhile, Reva is floored when Jonathan says he has faith, for the first time in his life that Tammy won't go through with the wedding and will realize she belongs with him. He finds himself at the bar where Sandy's bachelor party is underway and joins in the fun. Meanwhile, with the help of Lizzie, Marina, and Ava, Tammy gets tipsier and throws herself into her wild night, even kissing a hot guy at the bar. The girls talk about true love, the kind you can't fight or ignore, and Tammy is affected by their words. She agrees to take on one last task, to steal a groom figurine from Tilson's bakery and there, for the first time, she gives in to the memory of kissing Jonathan in the barn and doesn't fight it. Later, Jonathan arrives at the bakery, and the two come face-to-face. Danny surprises Michelle by bringing her to the Bauer house to renew their vows and remarry. Michelle's overcome by the gesture and thrilled beyond words. Father Ray presides as Rick and Mel watch the happy couple dance in the kitchen, remembering all their happy times and planning for new ones. Beth has invited Gus and Harley to a dinner, in hopes of finding the weak link and seizing Spaulding power for herself. Gus and Harley get in a fight and Beth couldn't be more pleased by the turn of events. However, when Harley and Gus regroup outside, they reveal their fight was an act to throw Beth even further off their trail.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jonathan tells Reva that he changed his mind and he will do nothing to stand in Tammy and Sandy's way. She follows him to Tammy's bachlorette party and then gives him an address of an apartment to take his mind off of things. He goes to Company and runs into Sandy's impromptu bachelor party with Jeffrey and Josh and Sandy tells him to have a drink with them. Tammy's bachlorette party includes many dares that she has to do to get her wild side out of her system, including a lap dance that she imagines is for Jonathan and dancing with Alan-Michael. Alan-Michael tells Marina that he thinks she enjoyed their kiss during the blackout. On her last task, breaking into the bakery and stealing a groom from atop the cake, she thinks about life with Sandy vs. Jonathan, and Jonathan walks in and finds her. Harley and Gus fight over Spaulding and Mallet to Beth's joy. She calls Alan to tell him that they are having problems while secretly Harley and Gus celebrate that they have fooled Beth. Danny and Michelle marry again at the Bauer house with Mel and Rich and Father Ray in attendance.",
