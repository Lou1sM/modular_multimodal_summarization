Michelle tells Ross and Ed that Danny is going to run for mayor; they try to dissuade her from the idea. Sandy finds Marah and suggests that she stay away from Jeffrey. Reva finds Christopher while he's jogging and pours out her heart about Sandy. They make dinner plans. Michelle and Marah both read the news headlines about the mobster running for mayor; they meet up and discuss it. They find some fortune cookies with some messages and a red ring. Marina visits and tells them she found a ring, too. They figure it all must come from Carrie. (there may have been a third ring, I didn't see, sorry) Edmund tries to offer advice and money to Sandy but he refuses it. Sandy isn't sure if Edmund is human and tells him that he will do everything he can to keep him as an outsider. Reva asks Edmund to back off from Sandy. Ed and Ross tease Jeffrey about the baloons. Cassie arrives and gives Jeffrey the cold shoulder as she waits for Edmund. Jeffrey asks Cassie about Marah, saying he thinks she has problems. She suddenly realizes that he's been hitting on Marah."
