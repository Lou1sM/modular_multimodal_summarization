She flees to the church, trying to suppress her memories of their kiss the previous night, then returns home, planning to tell Cassie about her conflict. But Tammy chickens out and takes off for a few hours of fun with Sandy. Sandy takes Tammy to the bakery to see the wedding cake, which reinforces her commitment to go through with the ceremony and leave Jonathan in the past. But, Tammy's shaken when she receives a provocative gift from Jonathan. She ends the day alone with her wedding dress, wondering what she'll do next. Meanwhile, as Reva urges Jonathan to stay away from Tammy on her wedding day, Jonathan remains convinced that the marriage won't happen. And adamant about being there to see it. Newly remarried, Danny and Michelle decide to leave town for a fresh start closer to Ed. Michelle takes Hope and goes to visit Cassie, reassuring the little girl's one-time mother that she will always be welcome in their lives. At the same time, Danny heads to Company and Marina, telling her about his plans to leave Springfield and giving her a good-bye note, thanking her for helping to reunite him and Michelle with their daughter. Marina assures Danny that she's fine, but later tries to commandeer Alan-Michael's sports car for a quick, kamikaze drive to clear her head. Unfortunately, the car is a stick - and Marina can't drive a stick. Alan-Michael ends up stepping in and showing her a good time, whether Marina likes it or not. Later, Michelle, Danny, Rick, Mel and Ray gather for a pre-Thanksgiving meal to say good-bye.\n\n\n",
