She told a disappointed Edmund that she couldn't think about their wedding until she resolved the painful situation with Tammy.

Edmund called Sandy with a mysterious request.\n\n\nHolly put on a slinky dress to have dinner with Sebastian. Holly reminisced about her love/hate relationship with alcohol. She leaned in close to tell him in a husky voice that she often had to engage in other sensual experiences so as not to indulge in liquor. Sebastian called Holly on her seduction ploy and asked how far she was willing to go to save herself. Holly kissed him passionately until he bent over in pain and violently threw her back into a cell.

Alex made a beeline for Company.\n\n\nBuzz told Coop that he would do anything to see Coop's dreams come true. Lizzie invited Buzz to stay and work for her as manager.
