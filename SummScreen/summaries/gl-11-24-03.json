While talking about her wish, Carrie disappears. While pouring his woes out about his situation with Marah to a bartender at Towers, Jeffrey runs into Josh, who offers to buy him a drink. Josh proceeds to drink too much and talks about his woman problems with Jeffery, hitting close to home about Jeffery's situation. Sandy confronts Marah about her kiss with Jeffrey, telling her she is setting herself up for a big hurt. Marah tells Sandy that Jeffrey couldn't hurt her any worse than Sandy himself has. Marah then accuses Sandy of still having feelings for her. Shane asks Nico to take Marina to the college dance so that she can have a \"normal\" night out. Nico tried to persuade Marina to go to the dance with him, but after she gets upset, he ends up telling her that is was all Shane's idea for him to ask her out. An obviously drunk Josh runs into Sandy at the office, then passes out at his desk, while Sandy takes care of him. Marah runs straight to Jeffrey's room after her fight with Sandy, saying she needs to be with him tonight."
