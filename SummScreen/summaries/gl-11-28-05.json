Jonathan ominously shifted in his seat. However, he \"forever\" held his peace, and Tammy and Sandy were pronounced husband and wife. They turned around and happily marched up the aisle, only to be greeted by an arrest warrant. It accused Sandy of bigamy, since he was still legally married to Ava.\n\n\nSandy admitted that he and Ava had once been married and that he had walked out on her. However, he swore that they had signed divorce papers weeks before, and it was all a misunderstanding. Tammy didn't want to hear about it and ran off. She met face to face with Jonathan, who got into the \"Just Married\" car. She tossed her wedding bouquet out the window, and they tore into the night.\n\n\nHarley and Gus continued with their plan to convince Beth they were on the outs by cutting short their makeout session to fake a fight. Beth offered Gus a deal: help her get Harley out of Spaulding and save his marriage as a result. Harley ended up at Company, where she found Mallet on top of Dinah. Mallet explained that Dinah, driven to drink by the sight of Tammy's wedding, had broken into Company. He was just subduing the perpetrator.\n\n\nTrying to defend her own actions, Dinah prompted Mallet to admit he still had feelings for Harley. Harley didn't want to hear about it. She told Mallet to be a man and repress. Mallet told her to do the same. Harley insisted she had no feelings whatsoever for Mallet, but their debate was cut short by Gus's arrival.\n\n\n",

Mallet finds Dinah with a bottle of champagne outside of the church. She gets drunk and when Mallet says that he will take her home, she throws him over her shoulder and they exit the church. Dinah is hungry so they go to Company, where they find the restaurant closed. Dinah breaks in and when Mallet tries to climb through the window to try and shut off the alarm, he falls on top of her. Harley walks in and sees this and Mallet accuses her of being jealous. Harley says that she could care less who he sees as Gus walks in. The Reverend asks if anyone has any reason why Sandy and Tammy can not be married as Jonathan, Ava, Sandy, and Tammy think over their intertwining lives. No one says anything so the Reverend pronounces Tammy and Sandy husband and wife. As they are leaving the church a police officer stops them and says that they need to talk to Sandy. Jeffrey reads over the papers they give to him and tells the church that the wedding wasn't legal because Sandy is already married.
