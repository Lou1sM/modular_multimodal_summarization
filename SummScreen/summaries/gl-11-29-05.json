Once there, Tammy insisted on still having a reception -- even if it was just for the two of them. They proceeded to eat, drink, and be merry -- and to be honest. They apologized for hurting each other in the past. With the wedding reception completed, the two took off for her honeymoon cabin in the woods. Jonathan carried the bride over the threshold, and their desire for one another heated up.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the wedding that wasn't, everyone tried to comfort Cassie. Buzz called Olivia on wanting to be there for Cassie -- only to get closer to Josh. Sandy was stuck down at the police station, trying to explain how he'd managed to forget to share the facts of his marriage and presumed divorce. At first, he accused Ava of setting him up, but she denied it. She urged Jeffrey to call their divorce attorney, Vince Russo. Jeffrey did but learned Vince was mysteriously out of town. Jeffrey arranged for Sandy to get out on bail and listened, without comment, as Sandy defended his decision to reinvent himself through lies and deception, even to the woman he loved.\n\n\nAt the same time, Josh, who was giving a heartbroken Cassie a shoulder to cry on, received a file purporting to document Jeffrey's own lies and deceptions. However, he decided not to read it. Olivia, the woman who had arranged for him to receive the incriminating file, was stuck at Company with Buzz, wishing she could be with Josh instead. She passed the time by pumping Reva for what she knew about Tammy's whereabouts. She also blasted Ava for lying about her connection to Sandy. Olivia fired Ava and threw her out of the Beacon. Sandy, feeling sorry for his recently homeless not-quite-ex, invited her to stay at his place.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jonathan takes Tammy to Towers where the reception was supposed to be held. Seeing the decorations, the cake, and the presents Tammy starts to tear the place apart. She is about to attack the cake with a knife when she breaks down. Telling the staff that no one else is allowed in, Tammy declares that she is going to have her party for just her and Jonathan. They dance, throw the presents around, and have a good time until the clock strikes midnight. Tammy says that this is when she and Sandy were supposed to leave for their honeymoon. Jonathan tells Tammy that she is going to have everything related to the wedding, including the honeymoon and takes her away. Josh takes Cassie back to the farmhouse, where he comforts her when she thinks that the farmhouse may be cursed. Josh goes to answer a knock at the door and is surprised to find the man who has the info on Jeffrey. Josh reminds the man that he didn't want the information anymore and the man tells him that Olivia wanted him to have it. Cassie asks for some time alone and Josh leaves with the information. Jeffrey takes Sandy into the police station and says that he will try and get to the bottom of why the divorce papers didn't go through but warns both Ava and Sandy that he cares for Tammy and her family and won't see them hurt anymore. Olivia calls and fires Ava, thinking it will get her in closer with Josh. Josh walks into the police station at the end of the conversation and tells Sandy that he is also being fired. Since Ava also lost her hotel room at the Beacon, Sandy offers to let her stay with him. Jeffrey tells Josh he may have been to hard on Sandy, and they discuss that sometimes you need to keep secrets from the ones you love.",
