She refuses, but as she walks away, he collapses to the ground.  He would surely have died had Edmund not turned the corner, for when Dinah saw him, she, anxious to impress Edmund with her \"compassion,\" pleads with Edmund to call the paramedics.  Where a moment ago she was ready to walk away from a dying man, Dinah now decides to become a hero and she resuscitates Sebastian.   As her mysterious ex-stepson is carried away by paramedics Dinah convinces Edmund to have a drink with her.  He agrees, and Dinah makes every effort to make Edmund believe she wants to be his friend.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Rick and Mel have yet another disagreement about his feelings for Phillip.  She does not understand that Rick misses his lifelong friend and doesn't understand how Rick can have compassion for Phillip's behavior during his mental illness.  Rick stomps away in frustration.  Beth just happens to walk in on the last bit, and asks Mel if she can help.  Mel tells Beth she believes it is a family matter and something she and Rick will work out.  However, after Mel leaves and Rick reappears, Beth gets another story \u2013 Rick is obviously very upset about her lack of support in his grieving process.  Their conversation is interrupted by Sebastian's arrival at the emergency room.  Rick runs to his side but is quickly overtaken by a panic attack as memories of Phillip's death flood his mind.  Beth, who apparently has nothing else to do that day, is still just outside the door and is very understanding of Rick's feelings.  After agreeing to always talk with each other \u2013 and sharing more than a few moments of meaningful looks into each other's eyes \u2013 Rick returns to his patient's side.  Sebastian realizes he is being treated by Ed Bauer's son and asks about Michelle.  He finds out that she is missing and realizes that she has not contacted Ed, whom he feels is the only person who can cure his mysterious disease.  As Rick and Beth enjoy yet another few moments of conversation, Sebastian escapes from the emergency room to continue his search of a cure.\n\n\nCassie and Reva try to patch up their argument over Jonathan by enjoying drinks at Towers.  However, upon their arrival, Reva finds Jonathan and Sandy in a scuffle.  Reva is angry and tells Sandy to leave her son alone.  She doesn't, of course, know that Jonathan egged Sandy into the fight by threatening to bed Reva's daughter, as he did Cassie's daughter.  Sandy swears that he will defend Reva and he tells her she is worth fighting for.  In a sudden about face, Reva and Sandy embrace \u2013 and are found in that embrace by Jonathan, who is visibly unhappy about what he sees.  Jonathan, in a bit of good acting, looks contrite and sad.  He tells Reva that Cassie has thrown him out of her hotel and asks if he can stay at her home \u2013 Reva is overjoyed.    But before he can move in, they must first win Josh's permission.\n\n\n",
