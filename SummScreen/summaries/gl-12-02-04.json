Mel accuses Danny of driving Michelle away. Frank accuses Olivia of killing Phillip because he was blackmailing her with proof of stock fraud. Olivia pleads her innocence and Danny admits his marriage to Michelle is over. Olivia accuses Beth of engineering the allegations against her.

A shaky Olivia decides to take Emma and leave Springfield. \n\n\nLizzie presents the mortified Cooper clan with pink, frou-frou menus for her new restaurant, Elizabeth & Company. Marina and Coop brainstorm about ways to cause trouble for Lizzie. Danny encourages them to exploit Lizzie's weak spot-not being in control-by giving her complete control and following her orders. They hope if they give her enough rope, she will hang herself. Marina bets Danny he wouldn't last five minutes working for Lizzie. Marina tells Coop to mind his own business when he warns her to be careful with Danny. \n\n\nHarley tells Gus their Thanksgiving flirtation and dance at the bar meant nothing. \n\n\nHarley, fearing Buzz is upset because he killed Phillip, assures him she will make everything work out.
