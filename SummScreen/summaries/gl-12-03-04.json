When she complains about the miserable day she's had, Bill says all the more reason to celebrate themselves. But, as Bill strives to give Olivia what she needs, she's distracted. She's thinking about the instructions she gave her nanny to meet her at the airport with Emma so they can slip out of the country and avoid Phillip's investigation all together. But, Bill is so wonderful and so sure of their future, she gives in for the moment. But, after they make love, she lies in his arms, wide-awake, and full of conflict, and when he dozes, she makes her escape. \n\n\nArmed with advice from doctors, Cassie and Edmund are ready to try to make a baby and take advantage of the miracle thrown their way. Jeffrey, however, is greatly affected when he hears their news and though he tries to hide it, Dinah can see his sad resignation and chooses to take advantage of it. She seduces Jeffrey, painting them both as needful in the wake of recent events, and in Jeffrey she finds a willing partner and then puts her plan into action. When she gets him out of the room briefly to get them some drinks, she pulls out a condom for their imminent use and pokes holes in it with a sewing pin, determined to make a baby. \n\n\nMichelle realizes Tony is sick and she swings into doctor mode, trying to figure out how to reduce his fever. Tony however continues to get worse and his fever induces a hallucination in which he imagines the old Michelle leaving him to return to her old life. Michelle discovers the source of his fever, the spider bite that is now infected, and knows she must try to leave and bring him help. She goes, despite his protests and the danger she faces, into the unknown jungle. \n\n\n",
