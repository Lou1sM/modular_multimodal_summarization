When Carmen tells Gus that \"Danny has betrayed me\" and he will have to pay a price for such disloyalty, Gus admits he almost feels sorry for Danny. After Gus leaves, Carmen meets with Carlos and tells him that Danny and Michelle's arrest must take place in San Cristobel - nowhere else. She warns Carlos not to underestimate Danny or Michelle. After he leaves, Carlos phones an accomplice and makes plans to double cross Carmen - he will steal the securities, then kill Danny and Michelle to insure their silence.

Josh later tells Billy that \"in 20 minutes, Lewis Construction goes public, and my marriage is over.\" Sad that he has answered betrayal with betrayal, Josh feels he has lost a part of his soul. \n\n\nAgainst his analyst's advice, Alan is champing at the bit to buy all the Lewis stock he can get his hands on. When Olivia arrives, she tells Alan that she answered his page only to say good bye. While Olivia contends their affair is over, self-satisfied Alan insists that she will be back.

When Camille asks to see Will, a reluctant Cassie acquiesces. In the hallway, Cassie runs into Dax and tells him she's worried about Camille being there. Although she feels badly for being jealous of Camille, Cassie mistrusts her nonetheless. Cassie goes with Camille to the hospital and is visibly troubled by the young woman's penchant for referring to Will as her baby. After their hospital visit, Cassie and Camille meet up with Alonzo and Dax at Company. Camille tells Alonzo she was delighted to see \"junior.\" Although she apologizes for calling Will \"junior\", she thinks it an understandable slip since she is, after all, Wills mother while Cassie is his \"stepmother.\"  To save Cassie from further humiliation, Dax spirits Camille out of Company. Cassie tells Alonzo that now that she has seen Camille in action, she realizes that the woman is \"about as far away from honest and simple as they come.\"\n\n\nConstance (Olivia) admonishes Reva for reading a book that has been banned in their parish.
