Cassie tells Jonathan that Tammy is with Sandy. Jonathan is crushed, taking off for Outskirts and refusing to take Tammy's call or even listen to her message before turning off the machine. His anger keeps Jonathan from hearing Tammy only went to Sandy so she could return some of his things. \n\n\nEarlier, Sandy pleaded with Tammy to forgive him, but she said it wasn't that simple. He accused her of being in love with Jonathan. Tammy admitted that she loves both men, and doesn't know what to do. \n\n\nEarlier, Reva lectured Jonathan about his selfishness in wanting to spirit Tammy away, while Josh walked into a seduction trap set by Olivia. Josh, learning she'd just received her divorce papers from Bill, offered his ex-wife a friendly shoulder to cry on - but nothing more. After, Reva and her estranged husband wrap up the day platonically in each other's arms, watching the sunset. Olivia ends the day sharing wine and baklava with Buzz while describing her idea of the perfect man...while Buzz privately thinks he might know of a widowed, Greek diner owner who would fit the bill beautifully. \n\n\nAlan-Michael whisks a starry-eyed Marina off to Paris, only to abandon her with just a guidebook for company so he can go on a date with a supermodel. However, when Marina is unable to get into her dream museum, Alan-Michael returns to pull some strings and get her a private, behind the scenes tour. Back on his plane, a grateful Marina opens her heart just a bit, only to see that Alan-Michael has fallen asleep without hearing a word. \n\n\n",

He tells her that they will work later at the office and finds her divorce papers from Bill. He leaves and Buzz comes over to deliver food to Olivia. He stays for some wine and they discuss the divorce and Olivia says she is ready to find another guy who makes her heart pound. Marina calls Buzz so that he doesn't worry and tells him that she is in Paris and will be home tomorrow. He doesn't believe her and when he asks whom she is with, she pretends to have problems and hangs up. When they land Alan-Michael goes off with Brigitte and although Marina is upset at first tells herself that this is not a date. She is further upset when all of the museums are closed for a holiday, until Alan-Michael shows up and says that he got them a private tour of a museum just for her. On the plane ride home, Marina goes to make him \"the world's best martini\" for getting her into see the museum but A-M falls asleep. R.J. is worried that Jeffrey will leave like Edmund did. Jonathan tells Reva that he and Tammy are running away together but they find out that she isn't at the house. Cassie announces that she thinks she went to see Sandy since there was a message on her phone from him. Jonathan runs off to the bar to drink his sorrows away and when Tammy calls only listens to half of her message, thinking she went back to Sandy. He misses Tammy telling him to call her since they need to figure some stuff out about them.",
