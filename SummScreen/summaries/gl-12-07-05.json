Reva tries to scare Olivia off the notion of pursuing Josh after breaking up with his nephew. They have an ugly encounter bashing each other's past mistakes. Olivia ends up fighting tears alone in her room, while Reva walks through a Christmas tree lot full of happy families, only to end up staring at a lonely, Charlie Brown tree. At the same Christmas tree lot, Cassie, Jeffrey and RJ experience the start of their first holiday as a family. Jeffrey doesn't even panic when RJ accidentally calls him \"Dad.\" Later, Josh watches the happy group through a window, while remembering an earlier phone call promising him all sorts of dirt on his sister-in-law's new man. Tammy runs all over town looking for Jonathan so that she can admit that it's him she wants, not Sandy. Sandy, on the other hand, is drowning his sorrows back home, and even Ava's sweet support can't keep him from murmuring Tammy's name as he sleeps. Meanwhile, Jonathan, convinced he's lost Tammy, breaks into her empty dream-house and prepares to set it on fire. Only Tammy's arrival and confession that she can't imagine spending her life with anyone but him, keeps Jonathan from doing something drastic. Unfortunately, their reconciliation can't stop the torch Jonathan dropped from catching the curtains and quickly incinerating the house. Tammy stands outside what would have been her home, watching an entire potential future go up in flames.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Josh and Olivia finish their kiss and Josh apologizes for it, saying that both of them are hurting and it isn't fair for anyone to read into it. Reva comes by and calls him out on the lipstick on his face. Josh tells her that it isn't what she thinks and then when he gets a phone call about Jeffrey has to leave and tells the girls not to break too much in the hotel suite. RJ, Cassie, and Jeffrey go Christmas tree shopping. During the trip, RJ calls Jeffrey dad and Cassie tells him that this is his chance to run. Jeffrey chooses to stay. Overhearing Cassie and Jeffrey talking about getting a Christmas tree for Sandy and Tammy, Jonathan loses it in front of Ava. Tammy tells Reva that she is choosing Jonathan but she can't find him to tell him. Ava goes back to Sandy to hear that Tammy wants Jonathan and offers advice to let it go for one night and relax, he takes her up on it and then cuddles with her in bed. Ava is happy until he calls her Tammy, and then she gets up and sleeps alone. Tammy finds Jonathan at the new house with a Santa hat that he has set on fire. She tells him that she wants to be with him, and while they are kissing the rest of the house starts to go up in flames. They can't put the fire out and Tammy says she won't leave without Jonathan so they both leave the house.",
