Gus followed Frank into the room, announcing Frank had hired him to act as Buzz's attorney. After Buzz admitted to having seen Phillip the night he had been murdered, Gus interrupted the interrogation and refused to allow Buzz to answer any more questions. \n\n\nAs Frank demanded to know if Buzz had killed Phillip, Alexandra entered the room and proclaimed Buzz was innocent. Alexandra attempted to provide him with an alibi, admitting she had not been in jail that night. When Frank made it clear he did not believe her alibi, Buzz kissed Alexandra and thanked her for trying. Alan took Alexandra away, and Beth and Rick called Frank to the Spaulding mansion. \n\n\nMichelle left Tony and went for help. In the jungle, she ran into a man who said they needed more help to get Tony. He told her to wait for him to return for her. As Michelle waited in the jungle, Holly was able to escape from Sebastian and set out through the jungle. After stopping to remember her past with Roger, and seeing a correlation with Sebastian, Holly returned to help him in what she thought was his time of need. As the stranger returned for Michelle, she was shocked to see that rather than help for Tony, he had Sebastian with him. Holly searched for Sebastian at the villa and was about to leave once again, but he arrived and locked both Michelle and Holly into the room where Holly had been held captive. \n\n\nAs Marina arrived to meet Danny and Robbie, she discovered Robbie was at preschool, and she was not needed as a nanny that day. She and Danny began a snowball fight, which drew them closer together. \n\n\nMel and Rick were arguing over Phillip, and Mel's need to remember Phillip as a friend. As Mel left to answer a telephone call, Beth and Rick began to reminisce over a high school yearbook. When Mel refused to join them, Beth and Rick went to the Spaulding mansion to visit with James and to continue talking about the Phillip they had known. Once they arrived, Beth and Rick discovered Ruth hiding in the study and a letter she had written claiming to be the killer. Beth locked her in the study as Rick called the police. \n\n\n",
