Just then, Alan entered wanting to speak to Olivia about Emma, specifically a custody arrangement. He pointed out that Olivia could be facing jail time, and he believed that the Spaulding family could provide Emma with a more stable environment. Alan said that even if Olivia could establish her innocence, he'd like them to share Emma. Olivia was against that idea, citing Phillip and Lizzie as examples of what kind of people the Spaulding family turned out. \n\n\nAlan told Olivia he'd speak to a lawyer about his rights and then left. There for the entire exchange, Billy suggested that Olivia compromise with Alan, because when it involved the Spauldings, one either surrendered or fought fire with fire. After Billy left, Bill assured a worried Olivia that he would help her fight. Olivia was not very reassured, since there was nothing he could do to help her -- he was not Emma's father. After she went upstairs, Bill made a phone call, asking to meet with someone. \n\n\nA little later, a woman arrived, and Bill asked her to help him get Olivia something very special for Christmas. Later, a depressed Olivia went downstairs, and Bill asked her what was wrong. She responded that she had just been thinking how her life seemed so perfect at that moment, and she didn't want to lose it. He told her she wouldn't; he was going to get her and Emma something for Christmas that would take all their troubles away. \n\n\nReva and Jonathan were in the woods right outside his house at San Jamal. He seemed to be wary about going in and warned her about his father, Alfred. Reva tried to tell him that he had to face his demons, but he was not very moved. He told her he was not going to suddenly change just because he saw the man who had abused him. Reva convinced him to go in, but when they arrived, the house was empty. \n\n\nSoon, Reva and Jonathan spotted a vagrant who stated that the house had been empty when he got there. He said he had heard that the man had died in a boating accident a few months earlier, and the woman had left soon after. He then hurried out. Reva mentioned that Alfred seemed to have died about the time Jonathan had arrived in Springfield. Jonathan thought he knew what she was getting at -- she thought he had killed his parents. \n\n\nSuddenly, Jonathan started advancing on Reva and appeared to confess to the crime -- as well as the ozone layer and the budget deficit. Not very amused, Reva reiterated that she wasn't afraid of him. He was skeptical and suddenly lashed out and forced her into a chair, stating that if he could do it to his adoptive parents, she could only imagine what he could do to the woman who had left him. Reva was still not scared and suddenly turned the tables on her son, forcing him into the chair. She then maintained that he was the one who was scared. With that, Jonathan freaked out, bolted up, and started yelling at his father for beating him and his mother for watching it happen. \n\n\nHe then asked who could blame him for getting rid of a guy like that. But, quietly, he stated he hadn't. Reva told him his games didn't sway her; she saw the pain in his eyes. She told him she thought they were done there, and she left. Jonathan then picked up a pack of cigarettes left behind. He lit one up, took a puff, and threw the lit cigarette on the chair as he left. \n\n\nOutside Company, Frank saw \"Ruth\" hovering over an unconscious Buzz and thought she had done something to him. He tried to confront her, but then Gus arrived and made if possible for her to escape. Buzz was rushed to the hospital. Soon, Harley arrived, and she and Gus argued about her plan to nail the murder on Ruth. After hearing that Buzz was okay, Harley left. \n\n\nSoon after, Alex arrived, anxious to see Buzz. Gus, remembering how Buzz and Alex had been lying for each other, wondered why she was in such a hurry to see him. Alex realized what Gus was saying and insisted that she had not killed Phillip. Gus told her, most emphatically, that he was going to find out who had, and if it were her, he couldn't protect her. Just then, Alan entered and told Alex that Gus wasn't interested in nailing her for murder; he was just interested in proving himself to Harley. \n\n\nAlex again tried to get through to Gus that she had not killed her nephew and wanted him to believe that. He told her that she could start by honoring Phillip's last request -- working in the Spaulding mailroom. Alex was shocked at first, but quickly complied, stating that she wanted to regain his trust. She then went in to see Buzz and told him about Gus reading her the riot act. She told him that Gus was determined to find out which one of them had pulled the trigger. \n\n\nMeanwhile, out in the hall, Alan tried to convince Gus that Alex was innocent. As a token of good faith, he even gave Gus a motive by telling him about Phillip's threat to get Alex lost in the prison system. Alan also told Gus that Alex had told him about that threat because she had trusted Alan to save her, which he had. \n\n\nLeaving the hospital, Harley encountered a hooker she recognized and after talking, realized the hooker might have seen something the night Phillip had been killed. The woman stated that she had seen a man there that night -- a man with horns. Later, Harley saw Billy walking near Company and started talking to him about his Cadillac -- the one with long horns in the front. She started to imply that maybe he had killed Phillip, since he had obviously lied about not being at Company that night. She informed him that the police were looking at Buzz as the prime suspect. \n\n\nBilly started telling Harley that she was barking up the wrong tree, but after she threatened to go to the D.A., he admitted that he had lied but insisted he hadn't killed Phillip. Phillip had summoned him to Company that night, but he had been undecided about whether or not to do it. So he had just ridden around and had only gotten out of his car once -- at the all-night pharmacy. Harley wondered why Phillip had wanted him at Company and asked what Billy had had at stake. When she mentioned that he'd been involved in a shooting before, he reiterated that she was going after the wrong person and walked away. \n\n\nBack home, Alan received an unexpected visitor -- the lawyer Bill had met with. She told Alan that Bill wanted her to get something special for Olivia for Christmas -- he wanted to adopt Emma. \n\n\nGus found Harley outside Company, and she told him about her misguided attempt to grill Billy about Phillip's murder. He mentioned that he had tried that with Alex as well. Harley told Gus that there were only two real suspects in the case -- herself and her father. \n\n\nBilly was on the phone with someone. He frantically told them that he had wanted them to scare Phillip, not kill him. He instructed the other person to disappear off the face of the earth. \n\n\n",
