When Olivia comes to visit Sam, she meets up with Claire in the hall and the Dr. taunts her about her arrest.  After getting Sam's test results, Claire determines that Sam not only has a \"significant\" infection, but it's affecting his heart as well. Olivia tells Sam about her arrest, and that Josh set the whole thing up to trap her. Still, she thinks, Josh will forgive her eventually. As he is resting alone in his room, Sam goes into cardiac arrest. Claire rushes to the room and calls a \"code blue.\" \n\n\nWhen she runs into Tony at the Towers, Marah discovers it was he who saved her father's name. The two finally admit that they loved one another. Meanwhile, over at Inferno, Ben and Catalina are at odds once again. When Ben's fraternity brother, Greg arrives, Catalina overhears the two talking about \"the bet.\" Catalina buys Greg a beer in an attempt to get information from him - it works like a charm. Thinking that Catalina knows about the bet, Greg spills the details. Over at the Towers, Marah and Tony realize that had they expressed their feelings sooner, things may have turned out differently. While Marah and Tony are agreeing to be friends, Catalina arrives at the Towers. Before she goes to talk to her former friend, Catalina stops to have a few words with Ben, who is waiting for Marah. Catalina tells Ben that she knows about the bet, that she thinks that it's the most horrible thing a man could do to a woman, and goes on to say \"I don't care if Marah was my worst enemy - I'm not going to keep this from her.\" Ben tells Catalina to have a look at Tony and Marah before she goes over to warn her adversary. Ben suggests that if Marah finds out what he's up to, she'll dump him and go back to Tony.  Hearing that, and seeing the former couple talking and laughing with one another, Catalina changes her mind and leaves the Towers without a word.\n\n\nAlan is certain that the SEC charges won't stick, and tells Josh just that.

But Josh warns Alan that Olivia will betray him, as well.\n\n\nWhile Josh is still at Reva's house, Holly arrives looking for the former Mrs. Lewis. At first, Josh thinks that she is there to campaign for Olivia, but Holly quickly assures him that she can't defend her friend's actions. Both Josh and Holly are worried about Reva. In fact, Josh worries aloud, Reva may be in a place where if she's in trouble, they can't help her. Holly offers that she has been worried about Reva since she purchased the painting. She tells Josh that it was on that trip to the B & B that Reva first heard her mother's voice saying \"trust your heart.\" \n\n\nWhen Alan pages Olivia, she pays him a visit. Alan tries to assure her that he can make the charges go away. When Olivia tells him it's Sam she's worried about, Alan offers to get the young man another doctor. He then goes on to tell Olivia that he will protect her from Josh. Furious, Olivia reminds Alan that it is he she needs protection from, not Josh. She insists that not matter what, she and Alan will never be a couple. In an effort to persuade Olivia that she and Josh are through, Alan tells her that her husband hates her. Alan then fabricates a story about his conversation with Josh - it seems that Josh had nothing but hateful things to say about Olivia, but extolled the virtues of Reva. Olivia tells Alan that she loathes him.\n\n\nDanny and Michele return to the hotel with the loot, knowing that it's the moment of truth.
