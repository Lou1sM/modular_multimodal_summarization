At that time, Danny provoked a fist fight with Gus as a way to get his hand on the alarm switch.  The alarms went off creating an illusion that the cops were right outside and Carlos and Bernardo gave up, which allowed Danny and Gus to restrain them.  As they were all discussing who was under arrest, the FBI walked in.  Babe, Gus's boss, announced that the FBI was there to arrest Carlos and Bernardo and that Carmen had helped them in this sting, going right over Gus's head to do it.  Gus was angry as Carmen told everyone that she did not do business with a little guy like him, she had been dealing with his superiors.  Babe apologized to Danny and Michele for having to use them in the sting operation and told them that they were free to go. \n\n\nAfterward, on the terrace at the villa, Carmen told Gus that he was a nobody and that he would be alone all of his life.  She told him that he should let this anger against Danny go or he will be the one who suffers for it.  As she went back inside the villa to 'celebrate' with Danny and Michele, they would have nothing to do with her.  Danny told her that he was angry with her for putting Michele and Robby in danger and for killing his father. \n\n\nSam's health continued to deteriorate, as Doctors Ramsey, Bauer, and Boudreau had to come in with the 'cardiac crash cart' and resuscitate him.

Alonzo saw that Camille was upsetting Cassie and took her off to a side table to have a little talk with her.  At that time, Camille received a note from one of Dax's aides.  She went to meet with Dax and he told her that Alonzo was the real heir to the thrown and was given away at birth by his father, and that it had all been covered up.  She was delighted at the thought of becoming a princess.  Later that evening, she set up a very romantic dinner for Alonzo in an effort to win him back.\n\n\n",
