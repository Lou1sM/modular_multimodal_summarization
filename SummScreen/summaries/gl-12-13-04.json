Josh is unfazed until Billy tells him Harley knows he lied about his whereabouts the night Phillip was killed. Josh asks Billy if he killed Phillip. Before he can answer, Billy's phone rings and he answers. On the other end an unidentified man tells Billy he did as asked and 'took care' of Phillip. If Billy wants him to leave town, his price for the deed will double. Billy whispers urgently that the man should leave town and agrees to the price. Josh glares at Billy and demands to know if the call had anything to do with Phillip. Billy lies to his brother and walks into the hotel. \n\n\nIn the lobby at the Beacon Ross hands Olivia legal papers outlining a proposed visitation agreement giving Alan the right to visit his granddaughter on a regular basis. Olivia is outraged and tells Ross she will not allow Alan to mold Emma into a twisted image of him. Ross tells Olivia to calm down and try to understand Emma is a Spaulding and Alan has a right to be interested in her future. When Olivia storms off, Ross greets Dinah who is also in the lobby, happily knitting baby booties. Ross is shocked to find out Dinah may be pregnant. He tells her he is happy but is concerned she may not be ready for motherhood. On the phone at the front desk, Edmund listens to this news in fascinated horror. Later, Dinah confirms Edmund has heard and tells him not to tell Cassie. \n\n\nAt the hospital, while waiting to see Buzz, Jeffrey O'Neill questions Lillian about the morning-after pill. Lillian is suspicious and refuses to give Jeffrey a prescription without the recipient seeing a doctor first. Their meeting is interrupted by Harley. She tells Jeffrey he can see her father but advises him not to upset Buzz. Once at his bedside, Jeffrey tells Buzz as soon as he is well, he will be formally arrested for Phillip's murder. \n\n\nAt Company, Jeffrey tries to get Dinah to agree to a pregnancy test. She refuses, saying it isn't necessary - she knows she is going to be a mother. She goes on to reassure Jeffrey she has no plans to pursue him for help with the child. Jeffrey is annoyed and tells Dinah any child with her as a mother is surely doomed. Dinah simply smiles at him in response. \n\n\n",
