They wondered what to do when they were attracted to someone each of their whole families pretty much hated. The girls decided there really wasn't much they could do.\n\n\nTammy saw Jonathan with Reva and Frank. Frank accused Jonathan of starting the fire that had burned down Sandy's house. He informed him that a neighbor who had run over to try to contain it was injured and in the hospital -- and she had seen a dark-haired young man and a blonde young woman running away from the scene. Jonathan confessed to setting the fire but stressed that he had been alone. Reva insisted to Frank that Jonathan had been with her at the time the fire had been set. Frank left to check out Jonathan's alibi. Jonathan grudgingly accepted Reva's help before he told Tammy what he'd done. Tammy was moved by his sacrifice.\n\n\nLater, Tammy was horrified when Cassie declared she'd decided that Jonathan could never change. He was bad news and always would be. That was why Cassie had told Reva she didn't want Jonathan at their holiday party.\n\n\nMarina went shopping for a killer dress to wear to her New Year's Eve non-date with Alan-Michael. She dropped by Spaulding to speak to him and learned Alan-Michael was leaving town. Harley had fired him. Since Alan and Beth had been neutralized, Harley thought she didn't need him anymore and gave Alan-Michael permission to go back to his slothful lifestyle. Alan-Michael called a friend and asked for an emergency to be arranged at the London office, all the while wincing over having to be so dismissive to Marina.\n\n\nEarlier, Alan-Michael had ignored a ranting phone call from Alan, but Gus answered his brother's phone. He heard their father demanding to be let out. Gus went to the asylum, where Alan insisted he'd be let out soon. Gus realized he couldn't allow it because of the threat that Alan posed to Harley.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Harley fires Alan-Michael, citing that she doesn't need him to watch her back anymore so he is free to have fun now. Gus answers Alan-Michael's phone where he hears Alan saying he can't run things from his cell. He goes to visit Alan and threatens him and tells him he wants to know what is going on. Alan threatens Harley as the doctor makes Gus leave. Frank confronts Jonathan about the fire and Jonathan confesses but asks for a little time to work something out. Reva makes up an alibi for him, saying he was with her when the fire started. Cassie tells Reva that Jonathan isn't welcome at the tree trimming party and Reva tells Cassie whether she likes it or not, Jonathan is part of Tammy's life. Marina and Tammy both share that they each have a secret involving a guy that people won't accept them with, but that they want to be with anyway. This prompts Marina to buy a new outfit for New Years and then go to Spaulding to tell Alan-Michael that she wants to be his real date for New Years. Harley interrupts and tells Marina that he is leaving and Marina changes her story and says goodbye. Alan-Michael calls and sets something up with the London branch so he can come to Harley's rescue and she will keep him around.",
