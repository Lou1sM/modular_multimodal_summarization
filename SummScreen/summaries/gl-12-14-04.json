Her patience with Rick's morose behavior since Phillip's death is running thin! Beth, however, knew right where to find her old friend Rick - in the high school gymnasium where Phillip and Rick played many a game of one-on-one. Rick seems unconcerned that Mel is looking for him and tells Beth he just took a day off from the hospital. The two commiserate and it is obvious a new kind of bond is growing between them. In fact, when Rick offers Beth some personal basket shooting instruction, it looks like a cuddle between sweethearts - something not missed by Mel, who finds the two together. Mel tries to get Rick to return to the hospital and reality by telling him Buzz was admitted to the hospital again. Rick is concerned, but not enough so to leave the gym. He tells Mel about the trip around the world he had hoped to take with her, but she insists his home is in Springfield, and his place is in the hospital. He tells Mel he refuses to be like Ed, \"a workaholic father who was never around.\" The fight ends when Rick stomps out of the gym, leaving Mel and Beth together. When Mel confronts Beth and asks about her relationship to her husband, Beth says, \"I'm his friend. Are you?\" \n\n\nSandy and Tammy enjoy a meal at Elizabeth & Co. Sandy talks her into trying her hand at playwriting. When he is called away on a phone call, Jonathan sees his opportunity to further destroy Tammy's confidence. He tells her Sandy only wants her for sex, but he won't have her until he has \"fixed\" her. Jonathan says Sandy's suggestion that she write it all out in a play is just another way to fix the \"damage.\" Although Sandy is making every effort to show Tammy he genuinely cares for her, she is bent on self-destruction and believes everything Jonathan told her. \n\n\nMichelle has joined Holly in her tropical prison cell, but she refuses to sit quietly. They know Sebastian wants them to contact Ed, apparently the only physician in the world who can cure his illness. Michelle tells him she will call her father only after Sebastian lets her out of the cell long enough for them to find Tony. Sebastian falls for the ruse, not knowing Michelle has no idea how to contact her father. Miraculously, they find Tony just in time to administer the medication he needs...and he recovers! Sebastian and his henchman bring him back to join Holly and Michelle in their prison. Sebastian now expects her to pony up, and hands Michelle the telephone through the prison bars...she dials the phone... \n\n\nBack in Springfield, Danny and Marina enjoy a day of flirting and innuendo. It's clear they enjoy each other's company as they spend the afternoon selling Christmas trees. At the end of the day, Marina mischievously produces a sprig of mistletoe. Danny is delighted, and they kiss! It's obvious they have both looked forward to it for some time, but Danny's cell phone rings, disrupting their moment. Danny is startled by the reply on the other end of the line. In a bit of very clever thinking under pressure, not to mention brilliant timing, Michelle has dialed her husband's cell phone number instead of her father's, as Sebastian ordered. Danny reels as he hears his missing wife's voice: \"Hi, Dad! How are you, Dad?\" \n\n\n",
