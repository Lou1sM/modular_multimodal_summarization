Meanwhile, Josh and Olivia debated over what to do about the picture Josh had found of Jeffrey and Richard together. Josh's decision was made easier when Robards, the P.I. who had originally dug up the information, called Josh to demand more money or else he was going to Cassie with the information. Figuring Cassie was better off hearing the truth from him, Josh headed to Cassie's, where he presented her with Jeffrey's dossier.\n\n\nMallet went to see Harley to discuss Marina getting in over her head at the police department and suggested they go on a stakeout to confront her -- just like the good old days. Harley, who was feeling cocky since Gus was back in her bed and the sexy Mallet dreams out of her head, agreed. But as soon as Mallet left, she had another fantasy about her ex. Mallet happened upon Dinah, who was trying to hide her tears after learning that Ross, Blake, and the kids were going out of town for Christmas, so Dinah had no one to spend the holidays with. Mallet told Dinah that there was nothing wrong with spending Christmas alone, and both sadly pretended to believe it.\n\n\nLizzie and Coop wished they could spend some time together over the holidays, but neither had the money to make their dream a reality. Luckily, Lizzie had something. Her old friend, Quinn, gave Lizzie the key to his condo, complete with river views and two Jacuzzis. Lizzie wondered what Quinn expected in exchange for all of his more-than-friendly generosity. Quinn acted so hurt that she would even ask, he took off without answering -- or taking his key back. Lizzie returned to C02 and found Coop horsing around with Ava. Suddenly Lizzie was dying to take Quinn up on his offer.\n\n\n",
