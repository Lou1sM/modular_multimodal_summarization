    "imdb": "Josh and Cassie host a Christmas party at the farm house. Lizzie can not wait to attend the party in hopes of Jonathan taking notice of her. She even pushes him to have sex with her once the party's over and they return home. Beth questions Tammy about whether or not she regretted leaving Jonathan for Lizzie and Sarah. Tammy, already a little tipsy, tells Beth she knows that by being the nice person, people like the Spauldings always get what they want. Tammy leaves Beth at Towers. Alan is depressed over the holidays and nothing Beth can say to him can get him to forget about Sarah. Alan tells Beth that he doesn't know who Lizzie is anymore. Lillian lets it slip that she will be babysitting Sarah while Jonathan and Lizzie are at the Christmas party. Alan tries to force Lillian to bring the baby to the Spaulding mansion, which would be a violation of the restraining order. Lillian refuses to participate in any of Alan's schemes and he makes a threat to her. Lillian fires back that she has lived around the Spaulding's long enough to know their deepest, darkest secrets. She tells him to stay away from the baby or she will tell the police everything she knows about Alan's illegal business practices and she would make sure that he had a nice long stay in Ravenwood Sanitarium! Alan swears he will not let Jonthan Randall ruin his family. Tammy goes to her mother's Christmas party and confronts Lizzie. The two argue, but in the end, Jonathan and Tammy can not stay away from each other and the temptation is to strong to ignore. They end up kissing passionately in the barn and begin making out. Cal acts as Reva's date to the party, but the awkwardness between Reva, Josh, and Cassie is so great that Cal makes an excuse to leave and Reva goes with him. Cal takes Reva back to his room at the Beacon and invites her in."
