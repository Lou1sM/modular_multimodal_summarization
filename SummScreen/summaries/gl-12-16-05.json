She was boldly provocative, wearing a red negligee and having scattered rose petals on the bed. Coop was a little unnerved. He asked her how she had gotten the room. When she shrugged it off, he demanded to know how she could afford it. Lizzie stated that it was Alan's -- she had stolen the key from his safe. That made Coop feel better, and they kissed.\n\n\nHowever, when Lizzie started to undress him, he suddenly stopped and asked her if she was sure she was ready for that. He told her they didn't have to do it if she wasn't. Lizzie insisted she was ready to sleep with him, but Coop was not so sure she was. That upset Lizzie because she had done all that preparation, including reading stuff in magazines, just so the night would be perfect. Coop gently told her there was no way she could make a mistake. He assured her that she'd know what to do.\n\n\nAfter Lizzie told Coop she loved him, they made love. Later, as Lizzie basked in the afterglow, her cell phone rang. She told Coop it was her boss and took the call. It was not her boss, though -- it was Quinn, wanting to know how it had gone. Lizzie thanked him for the use of his suite. He suggested she visit his parents' villa in Switzerland -- just her, not Coop. Lizzie declined the offer but asked if she could use his suite on a regular basis.\n\n\nMallet and Dinah were outside Company. Dinah was complaining about the fact that her family would be gone for Christmas. At that point, they spotted Reva and Billy. Dinah invited them to hang out at Company with Mallet and her. But Reva stated they were going to Cassie's tree-lighting party. She invited them to go, but Dinah declined.\n\n\nWhen Reva and Billy left, Dinah started complaining again about Christmas and how she wanted to forget all about it and just have lunch. She and Mallet entered Company and saw a slightly tipsy man singing Christmas carols. Not really in the mood, Dinah almost threw a drink in the man's face, but Mallet stopped her. He gently suggested the man leave.\n\n\nJust then, Dinah was shocked to see her mother, Vanessa, in Company. Dinah was very happy to see Vanessa and gave her a big hug. Vanessa seemed a little surprised, since Dinah was not usually so happy to see her. Dinah pointed out it was because usually Vanessa was only there when she was causing problems. Dinah knew that wasn't the case that time. Vanessa told Dinah that Mallet had suggested she spend the holidays with Dinah.\n\n\nDinah was a little hurt to learn her mother was there because Mallet had talked her into it. However, Vanessa assured Dinah she hadn't needed much persuading. Vanessa said Mallet had been very charming on the phone, and he seemed to know Dinah like a book. She left to make a call, to let Mallet and Dinah be alone on their \"date.\" Dinah told her mother it was not a date. When Vanessa stepped out, Dinah blasted Mallet for inviting her mother and asked what his motive was.\n\n\nAt that point, Mallet got defensive and told her not to assume everyone had an agenda just because she had one. Dinah pointed out that nothing was without strings. A defensive Mallet stated he had simply invited her mother because he'd known she was lonely. However, if that was not good enough, she could buy him lunch. Vanessa walked in at the end of the argument, and Mallet left.\n\n\nVanessa warned Dinah not to ruin things. Dinah insisted there was nothing between her and Mallet. Vanessa thought Dinah just couldn't recognize a good man when one was in her life. Vanessa pointed out that Dinah and Mallet had chemistry.\n\n\nAt the farm, Tammy tried to tell Cassie and Jeffrey that Jonathan hadn't started the fire, but her mother refused to even listen. Sandy showed up. Tammy thought Cassie had invited Sandy to her party, but he said he was there of his own accord. He asked to speak to her. In the corner with Tammy, Sandy gave her a gift -- a crystal star for the Christmas tree, her ring, and his new divorce papers.\n\n\nTammy told Sandy they were over. It didn't matter if he was divorced or not. A miffed Sandy knew it was about Jonathan and asked her if she honestly thought he would fit in with her family. Upset, Tammy stormed out and ran into Jonathan, who'd been lurking outside. Jonathan told her that he wanted to be with her that night, so Tammy told him to give her a little time to make an exit and went back inside. When she went in, Josh, who went to the party with Olivia, was helping R.J. put the star on the tree.\n\n\nLater, Sandy talked to Tammy again, trying to convince her that she could be happy with him again. He told her to think about it. While the family was singing Christmas carols, Tammy slipped out to make love to Jonathan in the barn. Sandy knew where she'd gone, and when the party started to break up, he suggested they go sledding outside, knowing the sleds were kept in the barn. They all agreed, and the whole family walked in on Jonathan and Tammy together.\n\n\n",
