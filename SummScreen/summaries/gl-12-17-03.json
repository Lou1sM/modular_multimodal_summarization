They proceed to question their loved ones again which leads to strained relations. They all come back to the museum and talk about the emotional pain they are causing their loved one while they are not telling them about Carrie. Carrie appears and tells them they should continue despite the pain they are causing and accuses them of not wanting to know the truth about the citizens of Springfield. Carrie says that perhaps when the truth comes out that the men can start to spiritually heal and tells them they are either in or out. Marah and Marina are in and Michelle is out. The cast of Romeo and Juliet is rehearsing in the gym where Sandy is trying to teach Joey how to fence. Edmund steps in and teaches Joey the correct positioning and a relieved sandy moves on to help the rest of the cast. Tammy gives Joey a scarf identical to the one she gave Edmund and leaves when Joey says the gift is not his style. Lizzie goes to make a move on Joey and before Cassie can stop her Edmund takes her to pick out a tree. Lizzie scores some points with Joey but leaves the gym upset after a cast mate makes a comment about her dad's health. Sandy who is worried follows her out. She confesses she feels she will never fit in and he relates and they connect. Though it is clear Lizzie is after Joey as she gives him a ride home while Tammy rides with her family. Buzz and Ed meet up at Maryanne's grave, where Buzz warns Ed that they all promised to visit the grave only once a year. Ed is clearly buckling under the strain."
