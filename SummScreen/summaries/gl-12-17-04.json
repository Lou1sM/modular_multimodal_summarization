Billy simply says he's in trouble. Billy asks Josh if he knew something that could help Buzz. He's not forthcoming about what he's talking about, so Josh tells him he has to do what he knows is right. Josh asks how he can help. Billy says he can't and gets up; he needs to make a decision. He then leaves. \n\n\nCassie is running outside the Beacon and stops to stretch. Suddenly, someone starts rubbing her shoulders. She thinks it's Edmund at first and is horrified when she learns that it is Jonathan. Just as a disgusted Cassie is about to lay into him, Reva happens by and Cassie tells her that Jonathan groped her. Jonathan defends what he did, stating that it was a simple back rub, but Reva wonders if he was just messing with Cassie since he knew she wouldn't appreciate the gesture. Jonathan says no and walks off. Cassie starts getting upset that Reva is taking Jonathan's side and defending him. It's obvious Cassie's not ready to simply forgive Jonathan for what he did to Tammy. She then tells Reva she has one request. \n\n\nA little later, Reva sees Jonathan inside the Beacon and asks to talk to him. He tells her to spare the tongue lashing. He comments that it might be best if he just disappears. Reva states that Cassie had a similar thought; she doesn't want him at her wedding. Reva defends Cassie's decision, although she tells Jonathan she wishes she would have postponed the wedding until next spring or summer. Perhaps then things between them would be different. She's hoping with some time and effort on everyone's part things will improve. He shrugs it off by asking why would he want to be there? To watch his aunt marry the man who wanted him dead at birth? Reva states that Edmund's changed, but Jonathan's not buying it. He doesn't think she does either, but she has to be there because she loves her sister. \n\n\nCassie sees Josh, who's now waiting for Reva, and tells him about not wanting Jonathan at her wedding. She says Reva claimed to understand but she knows she doesn't. Josh tells her not to worry about it. He's learned that sometimes things just have to happen. He tells her that Reva will eventually see Jonathan for what he really is. \n\n\nA little later, Reva sees Cassie outside the Beacon and tells her that Jonathan understood. Satisfied, Cassie asks Reva to share the maid of honor duties with Tammy. Reva accepts. Cassie then goes outside and comes face to face with Jonathan. He's carrying a large box and tells her it's a wedding gift. Cassie's not very eager to take it, but he gives it to her anyway. He tells her that he doesn't want to keep making the same mistakes; he wants to put their problems behind them. He then wishes her a happy wedding and leaves. Cassie throws the present away, unopened. Later, Jonathan returns and sees the present in the trash. \n\n\nJosh and Reva talk about Jonathan. She thinks he's finally coming around. She thinks the more they include him in the family, the safer he'll feel around them. Josh reminds her that there are those in the people who don't feel safe having him around. \n\n\nOlivia goes to Phillip's old room at Ravenwood to meet Alan. He tells her to make herself comfortable. He informs her that she'll be staying a while. At first, Olivia can't believe that he has the power to keep her committed, but he states that all he needs are some friends in key positions. She'll be there until he gets what he wants--Emma. Olivia tells Alan that he has no right to Emma, but he reminds her that she is his granddaughter and should be raised as a Spaulding. He asks her if she honestly thought he'd just stand by and let Bill Lewis adopt Emma. Olivia is speechless, and more than a little moved. She starts defending Bill to Alan stating that he'd make an excellent father, but Alan won't hear it. He leaves the room and Olivia's locked in. Inside alone, Olivia starts bemoaning what's happened to her and wishes she could go back to that night and re-do it. Just then Alan reenters and asks her what she was about to say. Olivia insists that she did not kill Phillip, but she wishes that night had changed, that she could have saved him. Alan doesn't seem to believe her. He reiterates that he will not let Bill adopt Emma; Phillip would not have wanted that. After he threatens to walk out and leave her locked away, a desperate Olivia concedes to his demands. Alan then tells her he wants to work out the details. What will she tell Bill? She suggests the truth, but Alan wants his name left out of it. He wants it to appear to be her decision. She comes up with a few ideas, but they all seem too weak to Alan. He wants the adoption idea resolved permanently. Olivia then suggests that she tell Bill she doesn't love him enough for him to be Emma's father. Disgusted, Olivia goes to leave, but is confronted by a nurse who pushes her back in the room and sedates her. Olivia is angry since she did what Alan wanted, but he tells her that he thinks she should stay there a bit so she won't have any second thoughts. \n\n\nWhile Frank is forced to arrest Buzz for Phillip's murder, Gus and Harley are discussing her plan to have Ruth commit suicide. Gus is shocked, but Harley insists that she will not let her father go to jail for shooting Phillip. She's not even sure if he'll survive the stress of the trial. Gus isn't sold on her plan. Harley agrees that Ruth's death has to be 100% convincing, but she knows how to do it. She, as Ruth, will go to the old bridge and videotape a confession. Ruth needs to be terrified about getting arrested. Harley will then make it appear as if Ruth has jumped off the bridge. She'll throw a log in he water so a splash could be heard on the tape and the police will think Ruth's body washed away with the currents. She says it's foolproof, she just needs his help. Gus is less sold on the plan now than before and tells her she's lost it and refuses. Harley is shocked, but Gus tells her the plan has too many flaws. Plus, there's the danger of her getting shot by some nervous rookie. He can't help her with that plan since he'd be putting her life at risk. Suddenly, he gets a call from Frank, Buzz needs his lawyer. Gus wants Harley to come to the station with him to see her father, but she refuses. She says she can't bear to see him like that. Gus leaves but tells Harley not to do anything crazy, to think about what she's doing. \n\n\nGus then goes to the station. Buzz isn't optimistic about his chances--he's even doubtful he'll be allowed on bail. Buzz asks where Harley is and Gus states that she had to stay home and watch the boys. He tries to assure Buzz that it will be okay. He then leaves the interrogation room and hears that Ruth Karloff has been spotted near a bridge. He rushes out with the cops. At the same time, Billy enters the station and asks to speak with Buzz. Billy tells Buzz that he doesn't belong there; that he wants to make sure the right person goes to jail. \n\n\nHarley, dressed as Ruth, is outside on the old bridge, setting up the videotape when the cops arrive on the scene. At the same time, Gus arrives and demands that no one fire. However, when Frank demands that Ruth give herself up, he fires warning shots in the air. Shouting for everyone to hold fire, Gus runs toward Ruth as Frank does the same. Scared, Harley keeps backing away and falls right through mesh gate and into the water!\n\n\n",
