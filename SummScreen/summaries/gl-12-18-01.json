Insisting that she must finish writing her paper, and adding that she has nothing to wear, Marah turns down Ben's offer. Not one to take no for an answer, Ben finds a cocktail dress in Marah's closet and suggests she wear that, and change their plans to dinner at the Towers. A teasing Marah begins to change her clothes in front of Ben, who stops her. Before she can zip her sweatshirt back up, Tony and Catalina arrive and get the wrong idea about what's going on in the dorm room. Ben invites Catalina and Tony to make a double date out of it. Although the girls aren't eager to make the dinner a foursome, the boys insist. When Tony and Ben go out to the hall to wait for the girls to change, they face off. Ben suggests that Tony wants to keep an eye on Marah, but Tony assures his new adversary that it's Ben he will be keeping an eye on. When Tony brings up the essay, Ben begins to have second thoughts about this double date. Tony puts Ben on notice: \"Tony Santos protects his good friends, so you watch your step.\"\n\n\nRick and Mel are afraid they're running out of time on Sam's case. Mel makes a date with her father to get some historical information - she wants to know about \"Zatunca\" - the word Sam whispered. Her father tells her that Zatunca is the ruins of a city in the Andes. She wonders what the significance is. When her father innocently turns the conversation to Rick and his situation, Mel gets wound up and storms out, leaving her father to wonder what he said.\n\n\nHarley is furious with Gus for lying to her. When he realizes that she's not just angry that he lied, but more that he lied to her, he's touched that she cares enough to be angry. He tells her that gives him hope. Harley tells Gus \"there is no hope for us.\" She insists that she is done with him. When Gus informs her that he's leaving the FBI, Harley doesn't believe him. After Gus leaves, Rick arrives. Although somewhat surprised at how happy Harley seems to see him, he appears happy about it none the less. That is, until Gus returns. Harley then tells Rick that she hasn't been completely honest about her feelings for Gus. She explains that she's been trying to figure out how she feels about her former partner, but insists that she has realized she's not interested in him - it was just a crazy infatuation. Although Rick seems to harbor some doubts, Harley assures him that she is being honest. Hearing all this, Gus changes his mind about leaving - Harley, he says, just gave him a reason to stay.\n\n\nEager to get back to the sea, Alonzo doesn't want to stay at the palace any longer. He tells Cassie that as soon as the doctor clears him, he will leave. Alonzo admits to Cassie that he's beginning to like life at the palace \"way too much.\" He asks Cassie and Richard to send Camille some pictures of Will. When Cassie balks at the request, Alonzo assures her that Camille is no threat to the family. Cassie tells Richard that he and Alonzo are right, Camille is no threat to her - she is, after all, in Iowa. While he's sleeping in the presidential suite at the palace, Camille slips into Alonzo's bed. He dreamily says aloud \"I thought I was dreaming.\" Camille tells her former husband that it's not a dream and begins kissing him.\n\n\n",
