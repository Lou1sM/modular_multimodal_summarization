Crushed, Sandy comes on to Ava - who turns him down flat. She announces that she knows he never loved her and gives Sandy his ring back. Coop takes Ava back to CO2, where she admits that she's lived her entire life up to this point for Sandy - and she isn't so sure what she's supposed to do next. Coop offers support, which doesn't sit so well with Lizzie. Earlier, she was out shopping with Alex when Quinn showed up and invited Lizzie to St. Moritz. Lizzie turned him down - but did accept his offer of a key to his condo again. Alex warned her niece about playing a dangerous game. Lizzie blew her off and insisted she was doing it all for Coop. However, seeing her boyfriend with another girl, she spins Ava a sob story about how Coop is so busy right now, he really doesn't need yet another person leaning on him. Ava gets the message and, when Coop invites her to the Cooper Christmas party the next day, she politely begs off. Tammy and Jonathan take off into the night, only to end up at a cheap motel. Tammy can't help thinking about her mom, and Jonathan urges Tammy to call Cassie, put all the blame on Jonathan and ask to come home. But Tammy refuses, reminding him that they're in this together. Leaving the motel behind, they take off for parts unknown. Meanwhile, after a pep talk from Reva and Josh about letting your kids go to make their own mistakes, Cassie calls her daughter. She assures Tammy that she's welcome at the Lewis Christmas party the next day, and that she can always come home if she needs to.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Alexandra runs into Lizzie and notices that something seems different about her and guesses that it is about her and Coop. Quinn surprises Lizzie and asks about her going to Switzerland with him, she turns him down but says she wouldn't mind borrowing the condo again. Sandy tells Josh that he isn't going to give up on Tammy and Josh tells him that Tammy has made her choice and she doesn't want anything to do with him whether or not she is with Jonathan or not. Ava tries to comfort Sandy and tells him to move on and when he won't take no for an answer, Coop steps in to help Ava out. She finally lashes out at Sandy for hurting her and tells him she is moving on. Sandy destroys the fishing shack of Tammy and Jonathan's. Coop and Ava are having a close moment when Lizzie finds them and tells Ava not to go to Coop for all of her problems. Josh and Reva both advise Cassie not to give up on Tammy and not to push her away. Jonathan tries to do the same with Tammy and she tells him not to pull away from her for her sake. Cassie calls Tammy and tells her to come home, no matter what and Josh and Reva help her trim the tree.",
