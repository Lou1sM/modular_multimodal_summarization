    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the space of one day, Harley manages to make two major mistakes. She rehires Alan-Michael at Spaulding (thanks to a crisis he engineered, then gallantly swooped in to solve). This means that he's in town to stay. So Alan-Michael tracks down Marina. She'd been on her way to return the dress she bought for New Year's Eve, but Alan-Michael reminds that Marina promised the evening to him, as part of an earlier bet. He is especially adamant that she keep her word after he sees Marina in her dress. She accepts and Alan-Michael is so pleased that he ignores an urgent call from Alan, in favor of being with Marina. Second mistake? Harley confides in Alan-Michael about her recent dreams starring Mallet. \n\n\nThe confession - and an unexpected chat with Olivia about tossing out the old to make way for the new - prompts Harley to return a \"My First Christmas\" ornament Mallet once made for her. Mallet is hurt, especially considering that earlier in the day he teamed up with Gus to make sure Alan isn't released from the institution and capable of hurting Harley again. \n\n\nAt Gus's urging, Mallet goes to Alan and asks if Alan's offer for Mallet to break up Harley and Gus still stands. Before they have a chance to come to terms, though, Gus barges in, having learned that Alan is having Harley's every move tracked, and threatens his father. Meanwhile, an inadvertent love triangle appears to be brewing at Company, when Buzz swallows his own feelings for Olivia to encourage Frank, who seems to be developing a bit of a crush on the lady, himself.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Harley gets a call from the London office about a problem, but Alan-Michael tells her that he took care of it when he was in London. Harley asks him if he would consider coming back to work for Spaulding and he accepts. Gus and Mallet work together to try and keep Alan in the hospital. Mallet pretends that he wants to take Alan up on the offer that was on the table before to help him get Harley back. Gus almost blows things though when he finds that Alan has a copy of Harley's schedule, and attacks him over it. Marina is about ready to take her dress for New years back to the store when Alan-Michael shows back up in town. After she tries it on for him, he calls and cancels his first date so he can be with Marina. Olivia confides in Buzz that today I the last day for her to send off her divorce papers and Buzz tells her to do what is right for her. After a bit of flirting between Olivia and Frank, Frank tells his dad he thinks he is going to ask Olivia to be his date for the Cooper Christmas party. This upsets Buzz, but what neither of them knows is that Olivia has called Josh to be her date for the night.",
