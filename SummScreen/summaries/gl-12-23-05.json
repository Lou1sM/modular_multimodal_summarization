Alan swears he'll be out soon, a fact that terrifies Gus when Lizzie repeats it to him. Gus and Harley spend their first Christmas together as husband and wife with Zach, Jude, Rick and Mel. Meanwhile, Buzz cheers up a down-in-the-dumps Olivia, but steps back when Frank thinks he's made a date with her. Marina celebrates with her family, but can't keep her mind off Alan-Michael. At the same time, Alan-Michael tries to bury himself in work at Spaulding, only to break down and join the Cooper Christmas party, gifting Marina with a beautiful necklace. Over at the Lewises, Tammy and Jonathan arrive at Reva's party and are caught kissing. Hawk and Rusty awkwardly meet their grandson/nephew for the first time. When a secretly drunk Billy drops by, he only fans the flames by asking Tammy how she could have made such a lousy choice of boyfriends. Jonathan takes a swing at Billy, Hawk and Rusty get into it and, finally, Jonathan and Josh end up knocking down the Christmas tree. Jonathan takes off, and Tammy, much to Cassie's dismay, follows him. They end up back at the boathouse, where they realize that Sandy has trashed their little Christmas tree. But as long as they're together, they don't care. Mallet and Dinah are planning on spending their respective Christmas Eves alone. Until Mallet accidentally sprays Dinah with beer, and both discover they've ordered the hotel's last turkey dinner. Dinah grudgingly agrees to share and the two end up having a lovely evening together. They're interrupted when Gus calls in a panic about Alan's plans for being set free. Dinah assumes that Mallet would rather be at the Cooper party with Harley then having dinner with her, and all but throws him out of her room. However, he returns later, sweeps her into a kiss, and the bickering duo makes love for the first time.\n\n\n",
