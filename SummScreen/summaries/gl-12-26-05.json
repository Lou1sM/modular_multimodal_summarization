The happy couple is making plans to get away when Frank bursts in, announcing they're under arrest! \n\n\nMallet and Dinah wake up together, both ecstatic from the night before. But neither is willing to admit their encounter meant anything serious, and so end up parting on a testy note. \n\n\nElsewhere, Gus and Harley wake up deliriously in love, but are soon forced to part ways. Harley goes to work, stopping off at C02 on the way, where she runs into Dinah. Dinah tries to make light of her night with Mallet, but Harley urges her to go for it. She keeps to herself the reason for her support, which is that Harley wants Mallet in a committed relationship so he stops being a temptation to her. Gus heads to Mallet's and demands he help him keep Alan from getting out of the hospital - by any means necessary. Mallet appears to talk some sense into him, but Gus intends to go to any lengths to save his wife. Dinah returns to Mallet's, eager to pick up where they left off. But when he assumes she's just there to retrieve her lost bra, Dinah pretends he's right and the two, once again, end up alone. \n\n\n",
