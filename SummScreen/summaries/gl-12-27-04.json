A room attendant admits to seeing them together and comments they appeared to be very much in love. When the attendant leaves the room, he calls Sebastian and alerts him to Danny's presence on the island. In the lobby, Tony staggers in and asks the desk clerk if he can arrange to have a plane fly him off the island. The clerk phones Danny in his room and asks if he would be willing to assist someone who wishes to leave the island. Unaware it is Tony, Danny refuses. Tony forces his way into Danny's room to ask for help, but is punched in the jaw by Danny when he recognizes his cousin. Tony, unfazed, tells Danny that Michelle needs his help and he has to fly them to Africa in search of Ed Bauer. Danny tells Tony they will start doing things his way and they are not flying to Africa in hopes of finding Ed sitting happily by a campfire. He leaves alone to fly to the island where Sebastian is holding Michelle and Holly. \n\n\nSebastian makes cryptic comments to Michelle about Danny willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice for a woman who doesn't even love him. Michelle is startled and asks what that is supposed to mean. Sebastian doesn't answer. \n\n\nOutside at the Spaulding mansion Coop and Lizzie continue their charade of trying to romance the other. They are in a near embrace when Alan and Beth appear. Alan tells Lizzie her father would be disappointed to see her becoming close to a Cooper. Beth tells Alan to stop and maybe Lizzie will finally be the one to stop the madness created by the Spauldings and their vendettas. Once inside, Beth continues by saying she wants Lizzie to embody the love of Phillip because she is glad she will never again see the person he had become. Alan is shocked at her words and attempts to calm her down. Later, Beth calls Rick and leaves a message that she has to tell him something about her and Phillip. \n\n\nAt Company, Gus and Harley are sharing a passionate kiss as Frank watches from the window. Gus tries to convince Harley to share an evening of romance with him. Harley is reluctant but seems to like the idea. Outside, Franks makes a call to Jeffrey and tells him he is about to arrest someone for Phillip's murder. He walks into Company and announces he is arresting Harley for the death of Phillip Spaulding. Harley guesses Frank knows she is Ruth Karloff. Franks admits he saw the scar on her arm - the same scar Ruth had on her confession tape. Despite Gus telling Harley not to talk, she tells Frank she created Ruth as a device to infiltrate Spaulding and cut them down to size. Franks asks if she killed Phillip and she responds she doesn't know for sure. Harley asks Frank for his handcuffs, but he doesn't want to use them on her. Harley takes the cuffs and puts them on herself. Gus promises he will find out who is responsible for Phillip's murder before Franks leads her to jail. \n\n\n",
