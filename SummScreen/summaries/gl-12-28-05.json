Cassie pleads with her daughter to understand; she did it to protect Tammy from making the same mistakes Cassie once did. Tammy is having none of it. She reminds her mother that she stood by for all of Cassie's mistakes - stripping, Edmund - and demands to know why her mother won't do the same for Tammy in return. Cassie again insists that she's only trying to help, but Tammy refuses to listen. She tells her mother that Reva understands about Jonathan and Tammy's love. Reva helped them see each other the night before Tammy's wedding, and Reva will be whom Tammy intends to turn to, to help get Jonathan out of jail. A horrified Cassie goes home, where she hurls a photo of herself, Tammy and Reva, realizing that she's lost her family.

Buzz gives Frank a pep talk prior to what Frank believes is a date with Olivia. Buzz lists all the reasons why Olivia could fall for a straight-shootin' guy like Frank, all the while hiding his own feelings for the lady. Unfortunately for Frank, Olivia hadn't realized she and Frank were dating. However, she's a good sport and lets him accompany her to a concert. When Frank is called away to deal with the Jonathan/Tammy situation, Olivia phones Josh. Buzz stops her and, again, makes a pitch for Frank while actually enumerating his own compatibility.

He asks her to look after Tammy for him. Tammy can't believe that Cassie was the one who called in the anonymous tip and asks for her help again.
