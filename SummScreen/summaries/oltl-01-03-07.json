On the other hand, things went well between himself and Sarah, he informs his brother. Stating confidently that he needs to school Antonio in his knowledge of women, Cris tells him he has to go slow and learn about the woman he's with. As a matter of fact, Talia argued with him all night, Antonio discloses, and he finally had to kiss her to shut her up. He doesn't think Talia trusts him and she's complicated his life. The brothers continue to teach each other. Cris advises Antonio to go after Talia and takes the lead. He insists they shower and head out.\n\n\nAt the same time, Talia and Sarah run into each other at the diner and compare notes. Sarah is getting the jump on Valentine's Day plans while Talia admits that she and Antonio are going nowhere and they even argued all night, though she felt comfortable with him. Sarah wants to take things slow with Cris. They both begin to salivate over the Vega boys and their bodies and in fact, are overheard by Carlotta, who offers them some ice water. Women are always throwing themselves at my boys, she announces, and Talia quickly admits that she was one of them. The guys were miserable over Christmas though, Carlotta continues, and she wants the latest scoop on what's been happening. She and Cris worked things out, Sarah divulges, and no, they did not sleep together, she responds to Carlotta's question. Talia and Carlotta talk about Antonio's recent past and Carlotta apologizes for the fact that even Jamie knew how Antonio felt about Talia before he did. She believes he wants to pursue something with her and gives her blessing. Suddenly, the guys appear; Sarah assures Cris that his mom likes her. Antonio and Talia attempt to make plans. \n\n\nA smug looking Nora is happy to hear that Lindsay is found sane and able to stand trial. She promises to go for the highest possible penalty as the law will allow. She's getting what she wanted, Dorian whispers to Blair and Addie. However, there's a glitch as the judge announces that it's been determined by experts that while Lindsay has recovered, she was insane during her crime and is thereby ruling that she's not guilty by reason of insanity. Nora quickly jumps up to argue, her smile gone. When the judge decides that Lindsay should return to St. Ann's, it's Addie's turn to jump up and argue. No, she yells, that will take her life away from her. Lindsay's attorney is also not happy with the ruling but the judge states that it's not clear that Lindsay is ready to return to society. Addie offers to be her guardian and when that is turned down, she volunteers both Dorian and Blair. The women have their own affairs to look after and while they love Lindsay, politely decline. Both Bo and R.J. jump into the mix and offer to look after Ms. Rappaport, much to Nora's dismay. Dorian is eagerly looking on in anticipation of Bo's irritating Nora while the judge asks Lindsay for her opinion. Nora is fit to be tied that Lindsay is even allowed to express a desire for where to live, motioning for a Time Out. She mutters under her breath about the judge's upcoming re-election campaign. Lindsay thanks everyone for looking out for her and is grateful for a second chance. She has a very bad headache and the judge kindly orders her back to St. Ann's for the time being. Bo and R.J. continue to disagree over who would be better at looking after Lindsay as Dorian can only notice how men love a broken woman. Nora flips out on the guys and suggests they don't come crying to her when she stabs one of them in the back with a scissors. \n\n\nMichael and John learn about Marcie and Gigi's relationship after they all figure out who's who in the picture. Moe refuses to give any information out without a warrant and is skeptical of John when he identifies himself as a cop and Michael's brother and then an ex-cop when he doesn't have ID. Michael figures that Marcie will return for her bag and they might as well wait it out but John follows Moe into the back and threatens him. I'm not surprised that Marcie is running away from you, he blurts out. John changes his attitude and explains the full story to Moe. He has nothing to lose and doesn't really care if Moe calls the cops on him. Moe suddenly believes him and gives them Gigi's address. \"Marcie was on her way over there,\" he says. \"Don't make me sorry I trusted you.\" \n\n\nAs Lee trains a gun on Shane, Marcie and Tommy arrive at Gigi's apartment. Gigi tells her son to remember what she told him during the tornado and when Marcie knocks she screams for her to run, that there's a trap. Shane takes off for the other room (he remembered that he was to lock himself in the bathroom during the tornado) and Gigi is able to temporarily stall Lee when she gets him between his legs. Marcie starts knocking things over behind her, as she runs. Lee and Todd manage to get out and stumble across all of the obstacles Marcie has left in the hallways. She runs into a fenced off area where the trash is collected and seems trapped. She's able to temporarily bar the door with a piece of wood as she tries to figure out how to get out. When the men finally break through the door, she's gone. Suddenly Lee spots her hiding but when they get to \"her\" it turns out to be only her wig.  Click! She has managed to get out and left them the trapped ones now. Meanwhile, upstairs, John and Michael arrive as Gigi and Shane are leaving. They hear that Marcie has run off, hopefully gotten away, and that Todd and Lee are in pursuit of her, with a gun. John orders the pair back into the apartment and he and Michael take off. They get there as Marcie is putting Tommy into the car; Michael yells for her to stop. She smiles as she sees her husband but Lee has his gun pointed at the McBains.
