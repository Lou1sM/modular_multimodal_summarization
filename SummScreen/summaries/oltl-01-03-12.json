    "soap_central": "\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Blair asked Todd. \"What I should have done at midnight,\" he replied, and kissed her. Todd ushered a shivering Blair into the pool house. She told him that it was \"too soon\" for her to jump into things with Todd. He suggested that she let Tomas go for the night, and start the new year with him. He knew that they belonged together, and wondered what was holding her back. \"It's you,\" she answered.\n\n\nBlair told Todd that she had loved him so much that she \"couldn't see straight,\" but Todd had always screwed it up. Todd owned up to his mistakes. Blair continued that she couldn't be with him again. Todd vowed that everything was different \"this time.\" She wondered if he could guarantee her that, but he couldn't.\n\n\nTo Blair's confusion, Todd explained that no one could make a promise to never hurt the feelings of someone else. He promised to love, and take care of Blair, and their children. He knew she wanted him again. She wanted to jump right in, but she couldn't. She added that she would, \"someday.\" She told him that they had a lot to look forward to, and led him out of the pool house.\n\n\nStarr was shocked to answer the front door to Cole. He entered the house, and she demanded to know if he'd escaped from Statesville. He explained that the power had gone out, the cell doors had unlocked, and he'd suddenly found himself outside. He'd needed to see Starr and Hope. She reminded him that she was with James, which Cole knew. He told her that he'd dreamed about holding Hope, but Starr responded that he was supposed to be doing time for murder.\n\n\nStarr continued that his sentence would be lengthened if Cole's absence were noticed. She wanted to take him to the police station, and explain the situation so Cole wouldn't get in trouble. Cole begged to see Hope first, but Starr argued that he saw Hope every week. \"Daddy!\" Hope said, standing in the doorway.\n\n\nA short while later, Starr told Cole that it was time for him to go. He didn't want to go back, and revealed that he'd received a letter from his father. Cole had been astounded that Patrick was alive, and needed to see him. He explained that Marty was with Patrick, and getting better by the day. Starr suggested that Cole could see his parents once he'd finished serving his sentence, but Cole responded that he had nine years left to serve. Cole didn't want Starr to get in trouble because of him, but begged her to hide him until he could find his parents.\n\n\nJust then, Blair and Todd called out for Starr from the hall. As Cole hid, Blair wondered if someone else were in the room. Starr replied that she'd been telling Hope a story. Starr wondered how their night had been, to which they both replied, \"Cathartic.\" Starr asked her parents to take Hope upstairs to bed, and lied that she'd done something to her back. Todd picked Hope up, and she called for \"Daddy.\"\n\n\nStarr explained that she'd shown Hope pictures of Cole before she'd gone to sleep, so Hope had probably had a dream about Cole. Todd and Blair took Hope upstairs, and Starr closed the living room doors after them. Moments later, Starr let Cole into the pool house. She told him to take care of himself, and turned to walk away. \"Wait,\" Cole said, and grabbed Starr's hand.\n\n\nTodd and Blair marveled over how much Hope resembled Starr. Todd suggested that he could be there all the time, but Blair told him to go home. She handed Todd his coat, and he turned to leave. \"Forgetting something?\" Blair asked. Todd returned, kissed Blair's neck, and left the house.\n\n\nBo and John arrived at Statesville, and approached Richard, who was the head guard. Richard explained that the power had gone out at midnight, and the escaping prisoners had attacked the guards. He divulged that \"at least one hundred\" prisoners were missing. They'd overpowered the guards, and had taken weapons. He pointed to a stretcher, and informed Bo and John that they'd caught the ringleader, Mitch Lawrence. The figure on the stretcher was covered in bloodied bandages.\n\n\nRichard continued that a makeshift bomb had exploded in Mitch's face, and he was still unconscious. Bo wanted a list of all the escaped prisoners, so Richard left to get an update. John stared at Mitch, and Bo wondered what John was thinking. Richard returned, and informed the men that the landlines were down. John wanted to check on Liam and Natalie.\n\n\nRichard told Bo that they hadn't gotten any updates from the women's area of the prison, but he'd gotten the names of the Llanview men who had escaped. He named Cole, and Troy MacIver. Bo instantly wanted to check on Nora.\n\n\nNora walked into the living room, wielding a flashlight. She was shocked when her flashlight shined on Troy's face. Clearly distressed, she wondered when he'd gotten out of prison. He told her that he'd missed her, and claimed that he'd gotten out for good behavior. He hugged Nora, who attempted to dial a number on the phone behind his back. Troy suddenly pointed a gun at her, and ordered her to put the phone down, which she did.\n\n\nNora asked if Troy had been lying about getting out on good behavior, which he admitted to. He added that he hadn't wanted to scare her. He explained that there had been a power outage, and he'd picked up the gun in the confusion. He'd only wanted to get back to Nora, and told her that they belonged together.\n\n\nNora was flattered, but reminded Troy that she was married to Bo. Troy replied that they were only married because Nora had probably thought that she couldn't be with Troy. He continued that he'd been framed as the Music Box Killer, but had to go to jail even when they'd proven that he hadn't been the killer. Nora reminded him that he'd escaped from prison around the time of the Music Box Killer, so he'd had to go back to jail.\n\n\nTroy suggested that they have some wine, but Nora remembered that the last time they'd shared wine, he'd tried to poison her. He yelled that Colin, \"the bad one,\" had been the one who'd tried to poison her. He hugged her, and told her that he loved her. She wondered why he would treat her so badly if he supposedly loved her. He replied that it was the only way he could get through to her.\n\n\nTroy asked Nora to tell him that she loved him, but was interrupted by the phone ringing. Troy knew that it was Bo, and advised Nora to \"make it good.\" She answered the phone to hear Bo's warnings about Troy escaping from Statesville. She assured him that everything was all right. He told her to lock the door, and to not answer it for anyone. Suddenly, he told her to say \"I love you\" if Troy was there with Nora. She told Bo that she loved him, and Troy grabbed the phone from her.\n\n\nBo told John that the phone had gone dead, but that he needed to get to Nora. Bo ran from Statesville with two cops.\n\n\n\"I wish you hadn't have done that,\" Troy told Nora. She replied that she had to tell Bo that she loved him, or else he would have been suspicious. Troy approved, and wanted to take Nora away. Nora offered Troy some wine and food, because she figured that he was exhausted. She handed him a glass, and expressed how happy she was that they would have plenty of time to themselves. She wanted to talk and make plans, but Troy kissed her neck instead. Trying to stop him, she toasted, \"To us.\"\n\n\nNatalie screamed at what her candlelight illuminated. \"Happy new year to you, too, Natalie,\" said a smiling Mitch, clad in a prison guard's uniform. Mitch blew out her candle, and covered her mouth. He warned her that, if she screamed, Viki and Clint's blood would be on her hands. He took his hand away when she nodded. \"You filthy, disgusting lunatic!\" she spat at him. He wondered if that was any way for her to talk to her \"old husband.\"\n\n\nNatalie reminded Mitch that he'd killed Jared, her real husband. Mitch thought that Jared had deserved to die. With that comment, Natalie dove at Mitch, and closed her hands around his throat. After a short struggle, Mitch had her in a headlock. Mitch told her that he wanted his daughter, Jessica. Natalie didn't know where Jessica was, but vowed to die before giving up Jessica's whereabouts if she'd known them.\n\n\nMitch pulled Natalie up by her hair, and suggested that they check upstairs. Just then, Liam's cries were heard over the baby monitor. Natalie swore that she wouldn't let Mitch near her son. Just then, Clint called down the stairs that Viki was taking care of Liam. When he didn't hear a peep from Natalie, he ventured down the stairs, and into the living room.\n\n\nClint saw Mitch with his hand over Natalie's mouth, and demanded that he let Natalie go, and leave the house. \"Not without my daughter,\" Mitch told Clint. Clint refused, and Mitch pulled out a gun. Clint insisted that Jessica was his daughter, but Mitch told Clint that it was \"one paternity test you couldn't change.\"\n\n\n\"This harlot is yours,\" Mitch told Clint, gesturing to Natalie. Clint didn't care about paternity, and vowed to protect his family. He dove at the gun, and struggled over it with Mitch. Mitch won out, and hit Clint square in the back with the gun, knocking the air out of Clint.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "After the prison break-out and the power outage, the prison warden informs John and Bo that many inmates have escaped although he's not entirely certain exactly which ones. He believes that a \"dead man\" whose face is covered by a bandage is Mitch Laurence so at least they no longer have to worry about being terrorized by Mitch again. John and Bo question whether that's really true. Mitch finds Natalie and is ready to kidnap and take her somewhere until she lets him \"have\" his daughter, Jessica. She refuses. Clint tells Mitch it won't happen. But Mitch is relentless in taking Natalie with him. Troy MacIver also escapes, finds Nora and tells her he wants her and knows they are meant for each other. She secretly calls Bo and tells Troy what he wants to hear but Troy has a gun and knows he cannot trust. Cole Thornhart breaks out of prison to find Starr and Hope. She urges him to turn himself back into Statesville. But he urges her to let him see Hope and hide him. She finds a place for him to stay for the night and refrains from calling the cops under the promise that he will leave the next morning, but he doesn't seem intent on doing that. Todd wants to get back with Blair and she tells him that might happen some day but not right now. She appears to have mixed feelings about their future.",
