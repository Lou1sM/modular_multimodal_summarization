    "soap_central": "\nA Mitch in Time\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody approached Charlie and suggested that they discuss Charlie's drinking problem.  When Charlie refused to discuss his addiction, Brody expressed concern that Charlie was headed for disaster.  Reminding Charlie of his recent visit to the hospital, Brody insisted that Charlie might have killed Mitch if the guard hadn't prevented Charlie from entering Mitch's room.   Charlie stated that the world would be a better place without Mitch Laurence.\n\n\nStating that he couldn't continue to cover for Charlie, Brody urged his friend to attend an AA meeting and offered to accompany him.  When Charlie claimed that a meeting wouldn't solve his problem, Brody pleaded with Charlie to confide in Viki, but Charlie insisted that he couldn't face his wife.   Presenting Charlie with one last option, Brody offered to act as Charlie's sponsor, but Charlie refused to accept Brody's help.  Unable to reason with Charlie, Brody advised the troubled man that he couldn't continue to keep his secret from Viki.  As Brody declared that he was fighting his own demons, he received a call from the station, instructing him to report for duty.   Before leaving, Brody warned Charlie to stay away from Mitch.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian examined the front page of the Sun.  The article reported Bo's firing, and exposed Bo and Nora's affair.   A call from Mitch interrupted Dorian's thoughts . He indicated that he had more work regarding Bo  for her to perform.   Dorian ordered Mitch to leave her family alone, but a sly Mitch replied, \"Not yet, we're not finished with Bo Buchanan!\"  Reminding Dorian that she had fired Bo for personal reasons, Mitch was concerned that Bo might reclaim his position as police commissioner.  A look of fear crossed Dorian's face when Mitch stated that she would soon receive a package that contained damaging evidence, and instructed her to use it against Bo.\n\n\nAs an infuriated Dorian yelled at Mitch, John appeared in Mitch's hospital room and demanded to know who the prisoner was conversing with over the phone.   Retrieving the phone from Mitch, John asked Mitch's co-conspirator to identify herself.  At that moment, Viki entered the library of La Boulaie and overheard Dorian mention Mitch's name.   Before Dorian could respond, Viki blurted out, \"Why are you talking to Mitch Laurence?\"   Covering her tracks, Dorian identified herself.  Relating that Mitch was harassing her, Dorian ordered John to keep Mitch away from her.\n\n\nJohn questioned Mitch about being in possession of an untraceable cell phone, but Mitch lied and claimed that he'd found it.  When Mitch asked if Natalie would face charges for stabbing him, John informed Mitch that the case was closed.  Insisting that no one would ever believe that he had stabbed himself, Mitch was adamant that he would be exonerated of all the charges facing him.  Unfazed by Mitch's threats, John advised the prisoner to prepare to be transported back to jail.\n\n\nAfter Dorian ended her call, Viki questioned why Dorian had fired Bo, Llanview's most trusted official.  Viki also wondered why Dorian had been caught speaking with the dangerous criminal that Bo was trying to keep behind bars.  Viki threatened to expose Dorian's motives in the Banner, but Dorian reminded Viki that she had resigned her position as mayor, and as a result, Dorian had accepted the post.   When an angry Viki related that she had resigned as mayor in order to protect her family, Dorian declared, \"I have to protect my family too!\"  Suddenly, Viki realized that Mitch had threatened Dorian's family.\n\n\nDorian denied having any involvement with Mitch, but Viki was convinced that Mitch had blackmailed Dorian into helping him.  Pleading with Dorian to turn to her if she was in trouble with Mitch, Viki offered to help Dorian in any way she could. Ignoring Viki's pleas, Dorian showed Viki the door.\n\n\nMoments later, Dorian's assistant entered the room and dropped off the mail, which included an envelope addressed to Madame Mayor, but Dorian didn't notice the package.  Instead, Dorian and her assistant discussed strategy regarding the backlash that she was expected to receive regarding Bo.   Informing Dorian that several media outlets didn't support Bo's termination, Dorian's assistant warned her that the termination wasn't legal and that Bo could file a lawsuit against her.  \n\n\nWhen the assistant suggested that she reconsider, Dorian refused to flip-flop.  The assistant advised Dorian that it was necessary to pull out all the stops to ensure that the termination would stick.  Noticing the package with no return address, Dorian slowly opened the envelope.  Dorian told her assistant that the package contained evidence that could end Bo's career in law enforcement.\n\n\nRex was pleased to find Bo inside his office at the police station.  Relating that his lawyer had advised him that Dorian didn't have any legal grounds to fire him, Bo declared that he intended to fight for his job.  Although Rex offered to help Bo fight the charges, Bo refused to discuss the case.  Instead, Bo questioned how Rex's relationship with Gigi was progressing.  After explaining that he had convinced Gigi to move out of the cottage to figure out what she truly wanted, Rex wondered if he had pushed Gigi into Schuyler's arms.  Bo was convinced that Rex would eventually work out his problems with Gigi.\n\n\nAt Viki's cottage at Llantano Mountain, Gigi was pleased when she awoke in Schuyler's arms.   They both agreed that the previous night had been wonderful.  While Gigi attempted to prepare breakfast, Schuyler offered to go out and get wood.  A modestly dressed Schuyler opened the door and was stunned to find Shane on the stoop.\n\n\nShane was shocked to discover his mother draped in a sheet.  Relating that Rex was under the assumption that he was staying at a friend's house, the pre-teen announced that he had made a surprise visit to the cabin in hopes of convincing Gigi to return home to his father.  A nervous Schuyler picked his clothes off the floor and headed upstairs to dress.   Enraged, Shane asked his mother if she was leaving him and his father for Schuyler.  Gigi was horrified when Shane stated that he was aware that his mother had slept with Schuyler.   As Schuyler returned downstairs, an uncomfortable Gigi related that she was going to get dressed and drive Shane back to his friend's house.  Gigi headed upstairs, leaving Shane and Schuyler alone.\n\n\nSchuyler apologized to Shane, but the youngster lashed out at him.   Shane told Schuyler that Schuyler had destroyed his family.  Unable to bear the sight of Schuyler, Shane announced that he would wait for Gigi outside, and raced out of the cabin.\n\n\nWhen Gigi returned downstairs, she asked Schuyler to remain at the cabin, while she drove Shane back to Llanview.  As she tried to convince Schuyler to wait for her, Shane pounded on the door and demanded that they leave the cabin at once.  Schuyler promised to have breakfast waiting for Gigi when she returned, and the two kissed goodbye.\n\n\nInside Kyle's room at the Angel Square Hotel, after an intense night of lovemaking, Oliver and Kyle lay in bed and shared a passionate kiss.  Proclaiming their love for each other, the two men declared that they were a committed couple.\n\n\nMeanwhile, outside Kyle's room, Roxy read the cover story in the Sun.  As Kyle and Oliver enjoyed their time together, Roxy burst into the room.  Pleased to find them together, Roxy congratulated her friends on finding their way back to one another.  Afterward, Roxy gave Oliver the news about Bo.  Roxy was certain that John would replace Bo as police commissioner.  \n\n\nWhile Oliver tried to process the news that his boss had been fired, he received a call from John, who instructed Oliver to assist Brody in transporting Mitch back to jail.   While Kyle was disappointed that Oliver couldn't spend the day with him, Roxy was concerned that Mitch might be released from jail.  Oliver assured her that Mitch would remain in custody.\n\n\nAlone with Roxy, Kyle noticed that the mention of Mitch Laurence had left Roxy in a depressed state.  Noting that Roxy was terrified of Mitch, Kyle wondered how Roxy had conceived Mitch's child.  When Kyle asked if Roxy had ever been in love with Mitch, she flew into a rage.  Referring to Mitch as Satan, Roxy denied ever loving Mitch.    Kyle apologized for upsetting Roxy, and insisted that he wanted to help her.  Kyle was convinced that Roxy hadn't divulged her true relationship with Mitch to anyone.   Roxy warned, \"If you really want to be my friend, you'll never mention Mitch's name again!\"\n\n\nBack at the police station, presenting Nora with a copy of the Sun, Jessica and Natalie asked Nora if the accusations in the article were true.  Explaining that she didn't want to hurt Clint, Nora admitted that she and Clint had separated and that she had reunited with Bo.   Natalie couldn't believe that Nora would leave Clint, but Nora insisted that she couldn't ignore her feelings for Bo.   When Nora excused herself to tend to Mitch's case, Natalie became nervous and questioned if Mitch would be released.  Nora informed the sisters that she was closing the case on Mitch's attempted suicide.  As Natalie and Jessica worried about Clint's state of mind, the sisters were horrified when they noticed John, Brody, and Oliver entering the station with Mitch.\n\n\nA few feet away, when Nora opened Bo's office door, Rex stood up to excuse himself.   Rex frowned as he stood face-to-face with a smiling Mitch.\n\n\nAs Mitch taunted Bo about losing his job, Nora informed Mitch that his stabbing had been ruled an attempted suicide.  Everyone listened as Mitch accused John of framing him.  Advising Nora not to participate in covering up a crime, Mitch warned Nora that she couldn't endure any more scandal.  After defending Bo to Mitch, Rex walked off to answer Shane's phone call.\n\n\nAs Brody and Oliver attempted to escort Mitch to his cell, Dorian emerged and stated that she had a few things to say.   After Brody and Oliver took Mitch to his cell, Dorian advised Bo to resign, but he refused.  Bo insisted that Dorian couldn't fire him over a personal matter.   Opening the mysterious envelope, Dorian stated that Bo was guilty of removing evidence and filing false charges.  Removing Jared's bloody letter opener that Natalie had used to stab Mitch, Dorian announced, \"This is evidence of a cover-up that goes from John McBain all the way up to the top!\"\n\n\nWhen Gigi returned to the cabin, Schuyler stated that he didn't want to cause problems between her and Shane.   Gigi insisted that Shane would adjust once he realized how happy she was with Schuyler.  The two shared a passionate kiss.  A knock on the door interrupted their special moment .     Rex called out to Gigi to open the door.\n\n\nWhile Charlie nervously fumbled with a cup of coffee, Viki entered the room and began discussing her confrontation with Dorian.  Realizing that Charlie was troubled, Viki questioned if he was all right.   Stating that he had something to tell her, Charlie asked his wife to have a seat.   Charlie admitted that he had been drinking.\n\n\nAfter explaining the events that had led up to him taking his first drink, Charlie related that he had been drinking ever since his visit to Mitch Laurence.  When Viki asked why Charlie hadn't sought help from her, Charlie shocked her when he stated that he didn't want to stop drinking.    Viki felt compassion for her husband and offered her support, but an emotional Charlie refused her help and announced that he was leaving.  In tears, Viki pulled Charlie close and declared, \"You're not going anywhere without me!  I don't care how bad it gets, I'm not leaving you and you sure as hell aren't leaving me!\"  Charlie wept as Viki cradled him in her arms.\n\n\n",
