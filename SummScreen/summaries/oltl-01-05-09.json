Alex claimed to have information concerning David. When Dorian demanded that Alex provide her with details, Alex briefly attempted to withhold the information, but quickly succumbed to Dorian's threats. While Dorian listened intently, Alex confessed everything she knew about David being a Buchanan. Revealing how she learned of the information, Alex exposed Nigel and Max's involvement and gave details of how she tricked David into marrying her. Convinced that Alex was being untruthful, Dorian pressured her for more answers. Stating that Nigel was desperate to protect the Buchanans, Alex maintained that he gave her his inheritance as a means of keeping her silent. \n\n\nWhen Dorian surmised that Jared had knowledge of the truth, Alex shared that she had overheard Jared discussing the matter with Nigel. Insisting that she had given Dorian valuable information, Alex considered them even, but Dorian wanted more. Citing that David was poor and had no knowledge of his lineage, Dorian said that Alex's information was of no use to her. Alex suggested that Dorian find a way to use the information to her advantage-and leave Alex alone. After Alex had left, Dorian overheard Asa's lawyer, Beaver Calhoun, asking a bartender for Alex. Dorian witnessed Beaver displaying a photo of David and inquiring if he had been seen on the island. Dorian interrupted Beaver's discussion with the bartender and offered her assistance. \n\n\nInside the Palace ballroom, Clint and Nora were startled by David's presence and certain that he was involved in a scheme. Although David did his best to convince them that he was a changed man, Clint and Nora remained skeptical. Unaware of his birthright, David mentioned that his return to Llanview involved the Buchanan fortune. David's words immediately sent Clint into a tailspin. In an attempt to calm Clint, David reminded him that they were brothers, which further infuriated Clint. Upon learning that David was speaking in general terms, Clint was anxious to hear David's announcement. Apologizing for his past misdeeds against the Buchanan clan, David claimed that he had transformed and no longer desired financial wealth. David insisted that he only wanted Clint's forgiveness. \n\n\nAs David excused himself to assist an elderly woman, a bewildered Clint and Nora tried figure out David's angle. While Clint was certain that David was plotting something, Nora reminded him that David wasn't asking for any money. The couple expressed their relief that no one who knew the truth would ever tell David. Refusing to believe that David had actually changed, Clint told Nora that their only hope was to send David far away and keep Asa's lawyer from locating him. After being shooed away by the elderly woman he had tried to help, Davis rejoined Clint and Nora. When David stated that he would return to Tibet upon receiving Clint's forgiveness, a relieved Clint and Nora gladly accepted his apology and encouraged him to head back to China immediately. \n\n\nAlthough pleased by Clint's forgiveness, David revealed that he couldn't leave town because he had much work to do. Explaining that he needed to make amends to every person he had wronged, David related that Dorian was next on his list. Clint wondered how long David would remain in Llanview. David responded that he had wronged many and his stay in Llanview could be quite lengthy. As he walked away, David announced that he would be residing at the local Krishna Rama Center. Both Clint and Nora feared that David could be in Llanview forever if he expected to be forgiven by Dorian. \n\n\nWhile out for the night, Jared informed Natalie that he had a big decision to make and needed her input. Natalie wondered what was troubling Jared, but was pleasantly surprised when he informed her that Clint had offered him back his old job at Buchanan Enterprises. Natalie happily remarked that the gesture meant that Clint had forgiven them for everything that had taken place in the past, but Jared expressed concern that Clint had only offered him the job so that he would be able to provide for Natalie. Unconvinced, Natalie recounted the many instances in which Jared saved the company from financial ruins, and assured Jared that Clint offered him the job because of his abilities. Shaking her head in disgust, Natalie imagined the disaster that would have occurred had David learned that he was really a Buchanan. \n\n\nNatalie reminded Jared of how much he loved working at B.E. Admitting that he would love to return to the company, Jared commented on how he had nearly lost Natalie due to his ambitious nature, and wouldn't allow it to happen again. Jared refused to accept the position unless he had Natalie's blessing. Pleading with him to accept the job, Natalie stated that B.E. needed him. Noting that B.E's stock was down, Natalie challenged him to save the company. Vowing to save B.E., Jared gave Natalie a loving embrace and promised that he wouldn't allow anyone to get in his way. Jared was certain that Clint would offer Natalie back her old job as well. Natalie stated that she couldn't return to B.E. because it was her responsibility to take care of Bree and Chloe while Jessica was away. \n\n\nA frantic John searched Marty's empty room at the Palace Hotel. \n\n\nOn the roof of the Palace, Todd stood on the ledge and asked, \"I can make you happy by doing this?\" As Marty looked on in anticipation and insisted that his actions could make her happy, Todd leaped from the building. After watching Todd fall into the icy water below, Marty fell to the ground and exclaimed, \"It's over!\" Marty stumbled back to her room. \n\n\nWhile strolling along the Palace grounds, T\u00e9a became curious after hearing a loud splash. Before she could investigate, an angry Blair appeared and warned her not to pressure Starr during Todd's upcoming hearing. Certain that trouble was brewing, T\u00e9a tried to convince Blair that they should investigate the sound she heard in the water. Ignoring T\u00e9a's pleas, Blair reminded her of the turmoil she placed Marty through and advised T\u00e9a not to attack Starr during her testimony. \n\n\nClaiming to love Starr, T\u00e9a promised not to hurt her. Stressing that she didn't want Starr to experience any more pain, Blair begged T\u00e9a to convince Todd to plead guilty. Apologizing, T\u00e9a explained that she was Todd's lawyer and was committed to defending him in court. As Blair argued that Todd had planned to steal Starr's baby, T\u00e9a stated that Todd denied the claims. After listening to Blair rant about Todd, T\u00e9a wondered what had happened to make Blair turn against Todd. When T\u00e9a reminded Blair that Todd was once the love of her life, Blair responded, \"You of all people should know that loving Todd fills your life with misery.\" \n\n\nUnable to find any clues in the room, John called the front desk. To John's surprise, a disheveled Marty surfaced and questioned why he was in her room. Explaining that he had read her journal and knew that she had arranged to meet Todd, John demanded to know where he was. With a smile, Marty announced, \"He's gone!\" After John continued to question Marty, she finally admitted that Todd had jumped from the roof. \n\n\nMeanwhile, as Blair continued to argue with T\u00e9a, both women were shocked when they observed John jump into the icy waters before their eyes. Realizing that someone had obviously fallen into the water, T\u00e9a, blamed Blair for distracting her and not allowing her the opportunity to call for help. A nervous Blair feared that no one could ever survive the icy waters. When Blair stated that John had been searching for Marty, both women surmised that Marty had fallen into the water. As T\u00e9a attempted to call for help, John emerged from the water with an unconscious Todd. As Blair and T\u00e9a tried to help John rescue Todd, Marty watched from the shadows. After managing to pull Todd from the water, an exhausted John collapsed and Blair tried desperately to resuscitate Todd. Pleading with Todd to regain consciousness, Blair screamed that she didn't want to explain the tragedy to the kids. \n\n\nAs Blair successfully revived Todd, T\u00e9a returned with towels for Todd and John. While Blair and T\u00e9a assisted him, Todd noticed Marty and mumbled, \"I tried!\" When John approached Marty and inquired about her condition, she lashed out at him and demanded to know why John had saved Todd's life. Blair and T\u00e9a listened as Marty screamed that Todd didn't deserve to live and that he should have died after falling from the roof. T\u00e9a and Blair wondered if Marty had pushed Todd, but he defended her. John tried to console Marty, but she warned him to stay away from her, and ran off. Blair begged Todd to go to the hospital, but he refused and staggered away, with T\u00e9a following close behind. Alone with John, Blair questioned if he knew more than he had revealed. John simply stated, \"It doesn't matter. It's over now!\" \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nigel interrupted Renee as she watched Asa's video in which he bequeathed the entire Buchanan fortune to David. Renee expressed her sorrow that David was the real Buchanan heir and not Jared. Remembering David as a small boy, Renee admitted that she was aware of Asa and Emma Bradley's affair, but never imagined that David could be Asa's son. Recalling his past crimes, Renee acknowledged that David was a con artist, but couldn't help but wonder what type of a man he would have become had Asa been involved in his life. Renee related to Nigel that she had convinced Emma to leave town with Ned Truman and forget about a life with Asa. Renee recounted the time that she held an infant David in her arms. She laughed as she remembered that he nearly choked her to death when he pulled on her very expensive necklace. Shaking his head, Nigel wasn't surprise that David was interested in money at such an early age. \n\n\nAt the Krishna Rama Center, David sought guidance from his spiritual advisor. He vowed to save the souls of others. As he meditating, David thought of all the Llanview residents who were in need of his help. \n\n\nBack at the Buchanan mansion, Clint and Nora alerted Renee and Nigel of David's return to Llanview. The family agreed that David could never learn that he was Asa's son or of his inheritance. Clint announced that he had an idea that might save the family's fortune from David. \n\n\nFilling Beaver's glass with liquor, Dorian tried to learn as much as she could concerning his search for David. \n\n\nBlair continued to question John about Todd's accident, but he refused to give her any information. \n\n\nA stranger on a motorcycle approached Marty and asked if she needed a ride. Without saying a word, Marty rode off into the darkness with the stranger. \n\n\nA distraught Todd stood outside of the Palace Hotel. When T\u00e9a tried to help him, he pushed her away.\n\n\n",
