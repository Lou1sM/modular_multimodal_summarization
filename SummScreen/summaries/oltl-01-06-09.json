    "soap_central": "\nMake No Mistake, He's Mine\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, T\u00e9a took a call on her phone expecting Todd, only to get Ray from Colombia. \"Who the hell is Todd?\" Ray growled. T\u00e9a explained that Todd was her other client, and the perfect cover for her presence in Llanview as she worked on Ray's behalf, but Ray called Todd a distraction. He ordered her to get him out of Plato Prison immediately so he could make Vanessa pay. T\u00e9a reminded Ray that she'd have to question Lola on her recollections about the night of her mother's death, and told him she'd have to make Lola \"crack.\" Ray warned T\u00e9a not to put Lola under undue pressure, and T\u00e9a asked if she was being threatened. \"I do not threaten, T\u00e9a,\" Ray replied. \"I make promises.\" T\u00e9a told Ray that Vanessa had \"coached\" Lola's memory on the witness stand, and that she would break Vanessa's scheme down by any means necessary in order to prove him innocent.\n\n\nAt the loft, Cristian woke from a nightmare, and Vanessa comforted him. Vanessa told him not to trouble himself sleeping on a daybed, and urged him to take the upstairs bedroom with her instead. Cristian was flustered by the prospect of sharing the same bed with Vanessa, but Vanessa reminded him that they would have to get used to sharing intimate space in order to fool the immigration services. At first, Cristian refused, and said his actions for Vanessa had hurt Sarah too much already. Vanessa reassured Cris that Sarah was a kind woman who would understand the sacrifice they were both making. She was about to back off her request, but Cristian finally relented, and agreed to share Vanessa's bed.\n\n\nAs Cristian and Vanessa rendezvoused for a private brunch at the Palace, Lola and T\u00e9a interrupted their conversation. Vanessa was surprised T\u00e9a only wanted to eat with Lola, but T\u00e9a warned Vanessa and Cris that they would have to prepare for their visit from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n\nOver at Sarah's apartment, an agent from the ICE arrived to question Sarah about her fraud claim against Vanessa and Lola. Sarah was surprised by the speed with which the ICE had responded to her report, and was hesitant to implicate Cristian in any wrongdoing. She told the ICE agent that Cristian and Vanessa's marriage was a \"marriage of convenience,\" and that the fraud was not Cristian's fault; Vanessa had seduced and manipulated him. As Sarah retold her story to the ICE agent, she explained that Cristian had refused to wed Vanessa until the mysterious death threat had turned up. Sarah theorized that Vanessa had sent the note to herself to compel Cristian to act. She pleaded Cristian's case, and said he had only been trying to do the right thing. However, the ICE agent was not so sympathetic.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Clint met Jared, Natalie, and baby Chloe for lunch, and Clint marveled at how much \"Chloe\" looked like Viki. Jared and Natalie were curious about Jessica's release from St. Anne's, but Clint informed them that Jessica's treatment had a long way to go. Natalie was upset to hear that only Viki was allowed to visit with Jessica, and feared for Jessica's girls, who missed their mother. Changing the subject, Jared gave Clint an answer to his proposition, and agreed to come back to work at Buchanan Enterprises. Clint told Jared things had grown more complicated; he explained the codicil in Asa's will, which left everything, including B.E., to David Vickers. Jared and Natalie were floored by the news, and even more floored to hear that David had returned to Llanview as a novice Buddhist monk. The trio did not buy David's change of heart, and believed his Achilles heel would always be money. Clint told Jared and Natalie that they had to get David out of Llanview before he could be informed of his heritage and claim the Buchanan empire for himself, and asked for Jared's help.\n\n\nOver at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Bo and Nora were also discussing the David situation, just in time for David to wander through the door in full Buddhist regalia, walking staff in hand. Nora explained to a flabbergasted Bo that David \"Vickaroshi\" no longer desired material wealth, and had \"found the light\" in his new religion. \"I've never felt lighter, Nora,\" David enthused. \"Namaste!\" \"Namaste!\" Nora replied gleefully. Bo asked David what he was doing at the cafe, and David said he had come to pay yet more amends to the people of Llanview, namely \"Car-low-tta.\" \n\n\nThe bewildered Carlotta walked up as David explained that he had inadvertently burnt down \"the hallowed, flan-covered walls\" of the Vega diner the previous summer while burning Clint's hefty check at one of her tables. \"Carlotta, would you hold my staff?\" David asked, and handed her his trusty staff as he held out his wrists to Bo, asking his unknown brother to incarcerate him for his crimes. Carlotta informed David that his penance was unnecessary, because he hadn't caused the fire at the diner; the cause had been faulty wiring. Bo asked David how he had intended to compensate Carlotta for what he'd thought he'd done. David said an apology would have had to suffice, as \"money is an illusion.\" David said that by understanding that simple concept, he was finally free.\n\n\nAs David drank tea at a separate booth, Nora and Bo continued their hushed conference about David's secret heritage. Nora warned Bo that if David learned the truth, it would be \"sayonara saffron and hello sapphires!\" Bo told Nora they had to get David out of town before Beaver Calhoun tracked him down, or they at least needed to prevent him from learning the truth before they could get B.E.'s stock price back up, thereby retaining control of the company. Nora told Bo she also needed his help with some records regarding the case against Todd; she was sure that with those records, she could nail Todd and T\u00e9a once and for all.\n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Jessica gazed at a picture of Chloe before getting a visit from Viki, who brought more photos of the children, who Jared and Natalie were caring for. Viki fretted about Jessica's latest \"Tess outbreak,\" and wondered what could have brought on Tess's dogged insistence that something was wrong with Chloe. Jessica thought that Tess simply could not accept that Bree and Chloe were her children instead of Tess's. Viki reminded Jessica that Bess was the gatekeeper alter who protected the host personality from trauma, and said that like Jean Randolph, Bess would stop at nothing to \"guard\" Jessica from what she perceived as pain. Viki suspected that Bess held the key to the root of the problem, and might know \"something you're not ready to face.\" Jessica wondered why Bess hadn't stepped in to stop Tess when she imprisoned Jared and Natalie, and Viki asked if it had been an even worse horror that had drawn Bess out into the open. As Viki continued to press the issue, Jessica grew withdrawn, and suddenly donned a familiar pair of dark glasses before turning to confront Viki. \"You are badgering Jessica,\" Bess said, \"and I will not have it.\"\n\n\nBess told Viki that she decided what was best for Jessica, whereas Viki was responsible for everything terrible that had happened to her. Viki admitted that she and Niki were at fault for what had happened to Jessica as a child, and Bess called Niki's negligence unforgivable. Viki said that Jessica had forgiven her, but Bess disagreed: \"Jessica hasn't forgiven you. Not one bit. She just doesn't have the guts to say so.\" Bess said that Jessica was locked away because of Viki's illness, and refused to share her secret. Viki insisted that Jessica was strong and could handle whatever Bess was shielding her from. \"Some things, Victoria, are unendurable,\" Bess said. \"We're done here.\" With that, she whipped off her glasses and smashed them against the wall, and Jessica regained control.\n\n\nJessica asked her mother what had happened, and Viki told her she'd met with Bess. She told Jess they didn't have the answers they needed yet, but would soon. Unaware of Bess's accusations, Jessica tearfully hugged her mother and reassured her that she blamed Viki for none of her problems. Viki bid Jessica an emotional goodbye and, as Jessica took to her bed, Viki pocketed Bess's smashed glasses and left the room, shaken.\n\n\nElsewhere in the sanitarium, Wes Grainger met with Dr. Levin, Brody and Jessica's psychiatrist. Dr. Levin urged Wes to meet with Brody and help him open up about the tragedy with the young boy in Iraq. Wes was reluctant to reopen old wounds, but agreed to try to help his fellow soldier.\n\n\nWes entered the common room and shared a happy reunion with Brody. Wes told Brody he'd get through his time in St. Anne's, and urged him to stick with the program. Brody admitted that his thoughts kept returning to the shooting of the Iraqi child, and Wes told him not to dwell on it; he reminded Brody that the boy had had a gun, and he'd done only what he'd had to. Wes assured Brody he would be there to help him through his recovery, and explained that he was staying in Llanview, and had even landed \"this crazy chick,\" who was waiting for him back in his hotel room.\n\n\nBrody mused about Jessica, his new friend who had warned him he would never be free of his guilt. Wes was apprehensive about Jessica's treatment of Brody, but Brody explained that Jessica had DID, causing multiple personalities. Wes teased Brody, asking which of the personalities was the hottest, and called Jessica his new \"girl.\" \"Jessica's not my girl,\" Brody groused. Wes found the idea of DID creepy, but Brody said he could understand it, remembering how he had \"psyched himself out\" and steeled his mind for combat back in Fallujah. \"Me and Jessica, we're not that different.\" As Brody described Jessica's alters to Wes, he explained that Bess was the \"alpha dog,\" while Tess had called him a \"crazy SOB.\" Wes was outraged by the callous treatment of his friend, and asked, \"Who the hell is this girl?\" \"That would be me,\" Jessica replied, walking into the common room.\n\n\nBack at the Palace, T\u00e9a and Lola sat down for their brunch, and Lola let T\u00e9a know how much she appreciated T\u00e9a's kindness towards her and her stepmother. T\u00e9a said she was doing it for Cristian, and Lola confessed that Vanessa had a \"thing\" for Cristian. She was sure that the immigration officials would see Vanessa's love for Cris and know their marriage was \"real.\" Lola said she wanted nothing more than to stay in America forever, and told T\u00e9a she wouldn't miss anyone or anything in Colombia. When T\u00e9a expressed her sympathies about the death of Lola's mother, Lola grew evasive, and refused to answer any questions about the night of the murder. T\u00e9a suggested that Lola's memory might have played tricks on her, but Lola grew angry and snapped that she knew what happened. She asked T\u00e9a why she was so interested in the night her mother died.\n\n\nAt the loft, Vanessa and Cristian attempted to awkwardly quiz each other on information they would need to fool immigration. Vanessa opened the questioning with, \"What was it like when you realized you were falling in love with me?\" Before Cristian could formulate an answer, the ICE agent who had questioned Sarah arrived at the door. Cristian and Vanessa thought he was there for the first of their interviews, but the agent informed them there would be no interview, because their marriage was a sham. \"You've been reported,\" he told the stunned couple.\n\n\nSarah sat pensive at her kitchen table as Layla returned from walking their puppy. Layla asked who the immigration official at the door had been, and Sarah confessed that she had reported Vanessa to ICE \"to get her away from my man.\" Layla was both impressed and nonplussed by Sarah's actions, calling her \"fierce,\" but asked why she'd done it. Sarah explained that she'd seen Vanessa and Cristian kiss on the live feed from Ultra Violet on New Year's Eve, and knew then that Vanessa would make their marriage real. She told Layla she would do anything to prevent Vanessa from digging her hooks deeper into Cristian. Layla hesitantly congratulated Sarah on her scheme, and told her she'd \"learned from the master,\" Tina. \"You are your mother's daughter,\" Layla said as she walked away, leaving Sarah with second thoughts.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, a visitor surprised David-Jared was there, and said they needed to talk.\n\n\nClint and Nora met up with Viki at the Palace, and Clint asked Viki about Jessica's condition. Nora told Viki she needed to talk to her about Jessica, as well, because she needed an eyewitness to Todd's scheme to steal Starr's baby. Nora explained that she wanted to put Tess on the stand to testify about Todd's conspiracy, but Viki violently rejected Nora's plan: \"Absolutely not!\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Clint informs Natalie and Jared that if they want to keep their jobs at B.E. and still have a B.E., they need to know that David Vickers has become the sole heir of Asa's fortune. And they must make certain that David never finds that out. Sara decides she will take action against Vanessa. So she calls the immigration agent and tells him she believes that Vanessa perpetrated fraud in manipulating Cristian to marry her so that she could get away with attempting to murder her ex husband and get him falsely accused of murdering his first wife. Tea is working with Ray Montez to secretly keep Vanessa married to Cristian so she can stay in the US and he can get her charged with false imprisonment and other crimes Viki and Clint know that Jessica (and Tess as well) has a secret involving baby Chloe. SO she asks Bess. But Bess won't talk about it. Brody shares with his friend, Wes that he knows there is something mysterious and similar to his own situation about his new \"friend\" Jessica. . Nora tells Clint and Viki that in order to make her kidnapping case against Todd stick, she needs to subpoena the only witness who can corroborate that Todd intended to kidnap Starr's baby. And that witness happens to be Tess.",
