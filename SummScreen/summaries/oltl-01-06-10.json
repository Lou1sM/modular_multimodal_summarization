    "soap_central": "\nLet's Get (Meta)Physical\n\n\nMarkko slaved away in the kitchen at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, in hopes of whipping up a new health shake so he could begin his physical fitness regimen for the new year.  As Cole watched with trepidation, he told his buddy he knew what Markko's new year's resolution was really all about: Ford.  Markko denied it, but Cole knew that Markko was still upset by Ford and Langston's connection.  Markko said it was more than that, though; as the teacher's assistant for his film seminar, Ford would be viewing and grading his documentary about Dorian's mayoral run.\n\n\nIn the dining area, Starr and Langston worked on their senior projects, but Langston's head was firmly planted in the clouds, and Starr thought she knew why: Langston couldn't stop thinking about Ford.  Turning prim and proper, Langston told her friend she had no reason to think about a guy who nearly ruined her New Year's Eve celebration with Markko.  Starr reassured her by saying it was okay to fantasize, but Langston said she had more important things on her mind, like starting work on Llanview High's newest musical.  Langston was determined to top the \"Prom Night\" musical she'd written in 2007, and do something spectacular for her final project as a high school student.  She tried to focus on her work, but as she stared helplessly at her laptop, no words sprang to mind.\n\n\nCole and Markko joined the girls in their booth, and Langston hid her work, or lack thereof, from Markko; she was ashamed that she'd been unable to buckle down and write.  When Langston shifted the conversation to the subject to the leading role she'd promised for Starr, her friend balked; Starr said she'd have no time to perform in the musical while also caring for Hope.  Cole saved the day by promising to pick up the slack in the household, which earned him a kiss from his girlfriend.  Turning to Markko, Langston turned up the heat and whispered to him to hurry back from the gym so they could have a wild evening together.\n\n\nOnce the boys were gone, Starr and Langston continued to work, or at least Langston attempted to.  Dodging her writer's block, she broached the subject of their imminent eighteenth birthdays, but Starr wasn't interested in talking.  Starr reminded Langston of how Langston had spent the past several years struggling to write a new musical, but had been sidetracked by all the strife in their personal lives; 2010 meant a new beginning for all of them, and Langston would finally have time to explore her art.\n\n\nAs Starr recounted the teens' turbulent recent past, Langston was struck by inspiration, and seized on the idea of writing a musical all about Starr and Cole.  Starr flatly refused to let Langston write about her or her family, even in a fictionalized form, and needled her friend by asking how she'd feel if Starr had written about Langston's obsession with Ford.  Langston relented, and Starr said her goodbyes. She headed home to Hope and left Langston still staring at a blank word processor.\n\n\nAt Serenity Springs, Layla was working out in the gym when she caught Ford's roving eye.  He hit on her, but Layla politely rebuffed him and informed him she had a boyfriend.  \"That would be me,\" Cristian replied, walking over.  Ford apologized for being forward and introduced himself as \"Robert Ford.\"  He said he was new in town and didn't know many people, but mentioned Langston and Markko by name.\n\n\nWhile Layla hit the showers, Cristian and Ford continued to chat.  Cris said he'd seen Ford somewhere before, and Ford admitted that he'd been in town the previous summer, when he was producing David's reality show.  Cristian reassured him that it didn't affect his positive first impression, and offered to \"spot\" Ford on the weight bench.\n\n\nNearby, Destiny was also \"spotting\" for big brother Shaun on the exercise mats as he burned his way through an endless exercise regimen.  Destiny encouraged Shaun to push through the pain in order to get his mind off Rachel, and said she'd do the same in order to forget Matthew.  Shaun took her up on her challenge, but Destiny found herself struggling when the tables were turned.  \"Do I look like Tyra Banks yet?\" she gasped as she strained through her sit-ups.\n\n\nShaun told his little sister that he was impressed with how she was taking Matthew's rejection, and asked if she wanted to talk about it.  Destiny said there was no need; she was determined not to pine for Matthew, and he'd assured her that he and Danielle were no more than friends.  Shaun was skeptical, and said that Rachel had told him the same thing about Greg.  \"[Matthew] wouldn't lie to me,\" Destiny informed him.\n\n\nShaun told Destiny that she was being brave and facing life head-on, and she'd done good.  Destiny said that all they needed to do was keep working out, and they'd find the real people of their dreams.  After their workout, they went to the health bar to toast to \"new love in 2010,\" but their bizarre health drinks were less than palatable.  Choking on algae, Destiny gave Shaun a high-five to his replacement offer of a hot fudge sundae.\n\n\nCole and Markko arrived at the gym, ready to get \"pumped up,\" but, as usual, all Markko could talk about was his rivalry with Ford.  Just then, Cole sighted Ford and Cristian by the weight bench.  \"You got your work cut out for you,\" Cole said, stunned by Ford's impressive physique.\n\n\nAs the boys began their workout, Markko decided to tackle the weight bench, but found himself in over his head with weights that were far too heavy.  He was further dismayed when Ford turned up to save the day and \"spot\" him.  Markko chafed at Ford's condescending suggestion to stick to his weight class, but couldn't help but ask Ford what he'd thought of Markko' film project.  Ford hedged and said the instructor would discuss the projects in class, but Markko was determined to hear Ford's opinion.\n\n\nMistaking Markko's documentary for a narrative piece, Ford told him that he \"didn't buy the story\" of Dorian becoming mayor on a gay rights platform, with Oliver and Kyle as unlikely supporting characters.  Markko was livid and informed him that the film was nonfiction, which stunned Ford, who said that real or fake, the film had not had a strong or compelling narrative.  He offered to help Markko work on story structure, but the humiliated young man begged off and said he'd see Ford in class.\n\n\nReturning to Cole's side, Markko continued to angrily denounce Ford, who Markko felt had proven superior to him not only in looks but also in talent.  Markko was sure he couldn't do anything right.  Cole said he was  wrong; Markko had Langston, he had her love, and that was something Ford would never have.  Cole urged Markko to believe in Langston, and remember that she cared more about him than she could ever care about Ford's abs.\n\n\nSome time later, Langston was still burning the midnight oil at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, and was desperate to write a single line in her play.  Reclining in her seat, she didn't notice as Ford entered the caf\u00e9.\n\n\nAt Todd's, T\u00e9a pulled away from Todd's embrace.  Todd asked her to stay in Llanview, but T\u00e9a said it was impossible; Danielle could only forgive him with time and space.  Todd said he understood, and he knew why T\u00e9a had to go, but he asked her again to stay with him for just a little longer.  Turning mischievous, he reminded her that they hadn't made love since their wedding night, and said he'd wasted too much time hating her for her deception.  The truth was, he couldn't hate her; he loved her, and would miss her.\n\n\nAs Todd put the moves on her, T\u00e9a succumbed to his advances.  She said she'd stay a bit longer, on one condition: \"Don't say it's the last time.\"  \"It's not,\" Todd said, taking her into her arms, and they sank into his bed and began to make love.\n\n\nAfterwards, Todd was over the moon, but still had questions for T\u00e9a: how long would it be until she told Danielle the truth?  T\u00e9a said that Danielle wouldn't be able to hear the truth until she was able to stop hating Todd for what had happened to Ross, and insisted she had to handle things slowly and carefully.  In the meantime, Todd asked, \"What happens to us?\"  He wondered what would happen if, while they were gone, Danielle wanted T\u00e9a  to find love with someone new, like \"Uncle\" Elijah, who T\u00e9a had spent New Year's Eve with.\n\n\nT\u00e9a scolded Todd for his jealousy, and told him Elijah was just a friend, but Todd remained peevish; exasperated, T\u00e9a began to get dressed.  Growing melancholy, she implied that Todd would reunite with Blair not long after she left, but Todd said that he and Blair were over.  T\u00e9a didn't believe that Todd could wait for her, but Todd promised to wait forever.  He expressed regret for shooting Ross, but T\u00e9a reminded him that he'd only done what he'd had to do to save Danielle; she said that everything she did with Danielle while she was away would be to unite them as a family.\n\n\n\"We can be a family,\" T\u00e9a told Todd, who replied with a dubious \"If you come back.\"  \"I will,\" she promised, and kissed him once more.  As she rose to leave, Todd told her he'd be there waiting for her.  \"I'll never forget you,\" he said. \"I promise.\"  Consumed with emotion, T\u00e9a walked out, leaving Todd sitting alone.\n\n\nIn Elijah's suite at the Palace Hotel, however, an entirely different love scene was playing out as Blair and Elijah tore each other's clothes off.  \"I'm tired of being odd man out,\" Blair growled as she threw Elijah onto a chair to have her way with him.  \"You are definitely no man,\" Elijah mumbled.  \"Got that right,\" Blair said as she kissed him again.  Reveling, Blair said that she'd found what she'd needed, to have control over her love life again, but Elijah said what they really needed was to forget the ones they'd loved and lost, and he pinned her to the floor.\n\n\nBlair pulled away suddenly, and told Elijah she couldn't sleep with him; they barely knew each other, and she wouldn't have unsafe sex.  Beaming, Elijah produced a condom, and Blair asked him if he'd been saving it for T\u00e9a.  \"Who are you, Elijah Clarke?\" she asked, raking her nails across his flesh, and Elijah countered, asking Blair who she was, other than Todd Manning's ex.  Blair tore the condom wrapper open with her teeth and urged him to find out, while Elijah flung everything off his nearby desk and threw Blair on top of it.\n\n\nNot far away, in T\u00e9a's suite, Matthew and Danielle stepped back from their chaste first kiss,. They looked as if they were feeling awkward and unsure.  \"That's another thing I won't forget when I go back to Tahiti!\" Danielle quipped.  Matthew wished it weren't a kiss goodbye.  Danielle marveled at how kissing felt, and Matthew was shocked to realize the kiss had been a first for both of them.\n\n\nNeither teen could believe that they were each other's \"first,\" but Matthew said he'd only been kissed once before, by Becca, when she had deceived him with Justin.  He recounted the tale of his accident, and said that, in the final analysis, Becca hadn't counted as his first kiss, whereas Danielle was sure to have had suitors, since she was \"hot.\"  Danielle said that she wasn't as hot as Matthew thought, and had been a \"surfing tomboy\" in Tahiti, only competing against boys, never being wooed by them.  Danielle shyly said she'd liked the kiss, and suggested they do it again, but Matthew wasn't sure it was a good idea.\n\n\nMatthew explained that he felt guilty about Destiny, who he'd shot down on New Year's Eve; he'd told Destiny that he was only friends with Danielle, nothing more, and said he wouldn't want to hurt Destiny's feelings.  Danielle reminded him that she was leaving town, and Destiny would never have to know.  As the kids leaned in for another kiss, a loud noise from somewhere in the hotel stopped them short.\n\n\nLittle did Matthew and Danielle know that that noise was Blair and Elijah, still at it in their marathon lovemaking.  As Blair and Elijah wrestled on the ground, there was a knock at the door: it was Renee, asking if she needed to call security.  As Elijah answered the door and Blair hid behind it, Renee took in the trashed hotel room and asked Elijah why everything looked and sounded as if a tornado had hit his suite.  Elijah lamely claimed he'd had a bad reaction to sleep medication, and promised to pay the damages.  As Renee stormed off in a huff, Elijah closed his door and he and Blair collapsed to the ground, laughing.\n\n\nBack at T\u00e9a's suite, Matthew looked for the source of the \"noise\" in the corridor, but found nothing.  Danielle suggested they try kissing once more, as \"practice makes perfect.\"  Matthew leaned in, but the kids stopped short just as T\u00e9a returned, bemused by the vibe between the two.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked them if they'd said their goodbyes, and Matthew suggested he take Danielle's picture for posterity.  Danielle smiled for Matthew's camera, and Matthew vowed that he'd never forget her-and used the same phrase Todd had used during his final hour with T\u00e9a.\n\n\nIn Elijah's suite, Elijah and Blair retired to the bed, to recover from their torrid encounter.  \"I think I might be bleeding,\" Elijah murmured.  Blair asked if he was over T\u00e9a, and Elijah assured her he'd worked the \"bug\" out of her system; the question was whether she was over Todd.=  Considering it, Blair said no, and tackled him back onto the sheets once more.\n\n\nAfterwards, Blair and Elijah lay on the floor of the suite, covered in feathers and debris; \"I think that did it,\" Blair sighed.  As she began to get cleaned up, Elijah offered her his business card for the future.  Blair initially refused, and told him she wasn't ready for another relationship.  \"Who said anything about a relationship?\" Elijah asked, and promised her \"no strings,\" just good times.  Blair smirked, considering his offer. \n\n\n",
