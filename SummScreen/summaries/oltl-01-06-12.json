When Bo asked Nora if Troy had hurt her, Troy yelled out that he would never hurt Nora.  Bo then handed Nora the gun to hold on Troy, so Bo could leave to find some rope.  Lindsay informed Nora that Troy had escaped Statesville, but that Lindsay had only left the prison to warn Bo.\n\n\nWhen Bo returned, he tied Troy to a chair. Bo explained that he had known where Troy had gone, since Troy had mentioned to Lindsay that he would be leaving with Nora and Matthew.  Lindsay expressed that she owed Nora, so she had warned Bo about Troy.  Bo indicated that they would place Troy in the car, drive down the mountain, and turn Troy over the police.  Lindsay then wondered what Bo would do with her.\n\n\nBo revealed to Lindsay that he was no longer police commissioner, so that decision would need to be made by the district attorney.  As Bo and Lindsay looked at Nora, she said, \"Lindsay, we have a history.  But I have to say after what you've done for us today, you've really changed, and I forgive you.  Can you forgive me?\"  Lindsay indicated that was why she was there.  However, Nora then stated that she could not overlook that Lindsay had murdered a man, but Nora did promise to talk to a judge on Lindsay's behalf.\n\n\nNora added that she would tell the judge that Lindsay had helped Nora and Bo with a serious crime.  Nora believed that with her and Bo's testimony, they could probably get Lindsay paroled.  Bo handed Lindsay the keys to Troy's car and requested that she drive herself down the mountain to the cops, so that she could ask them to call an ambulance.  Lindsay was pleased that Bo and Nora trusted her to do that, and Lindsay smiled once she walked out the door.\n\n\nWhen Nora asked Bo why they needed an ambulance, Bo opened his coat to reveal a gunshot wound, as he collapsed on the floor.  Nora screamed that she needed help and then ran out the door in search for Lindsay.  After she saw that Lindsay had already left, Nora returned inside and held a pillow on Bo's wound.  Nora cried and begged Bo not to die on her.  Nora looked around the room and saw a tied-up Troy.  Nora then remembered that Troy was a doctor.\n\n\nNora reminded Troy that he had taken an oath, and she stressed that Troy had to save Bo.  Nora claimed that she would talk to the warden on Troy's behalf, but Troy refused to help Bo.  Nora insisted that she would do anything Troy wanted and would even lie or \"go to jail\" for Troy, if he would just save Bo.  However, Troy remarked that Bo had to die, so that Troy and Nora could be together.  Nora cried that she loved Bo, and that he was everything to her.  Nora again pleaded with Troy to help Bo.  Troy told Nora that meant that she would have to untie him, and that she would also have to trust him.\n\n\nIn the church, Bobby Ford and Mitch Laurence wrestled with the gun, as it went off.  The church chandelier fell on top of Bobby.  John pointed his gun at Mitch, as Jessica ran to Ford.  Mitch threatened to shoot Jessica, and Jessica begged Ford to stay with them.  Mitch refused to put down his gun, while Jessica cried out for John to call an ambulance.  Mitch then declared that Jessica's time was at an end.  \"The eye that mocks the father, that scorns obedience, will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vulture.\"\n\n\nNatalie told Jessica to lift the chandelier off of Ford with her, but Mitch demanded that they stop.  The girls lifted the light, and John declared that he was taking Mitch out.  Jessica again yelled that John needed to call an ambulance and then begged Mitch for mercy on Ford.  Mitch let John make the call but then announced that Natalie would remain with Mitch.  As Mitch continued to hold the gun on Natalie, the EMS technicians carted Ford out of the church, and Jessica decided to accompany them.  Mitch declared that Jessica meant nothing to him, since she was a \"thankless, thankless child.\"\n\n\nJohn announced that the time was up, and that if Mitch released Natalie, John would look the other way, as Mitch escaped.  However, Mitch refused to surrender his bride, because he wanted to start his own flock with Natalie.  Mitch revealed that Natalie would learn to obey, and to be humble.  Mitch then added that Natalie would be his bride in every sense -- body and soul.  Mitch then howled that John was not that good of a shot, so John shot his gun.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Hannah shot Cole in the chest.  Starr ran to Cole and cried out for Todd and Blair to call an ambulance.  Starr leaned over Cole and promised him that he would be okay.  Hannah declared that she had not meant to hurt Cole, and that she had only intended to hurt Starr.  Starr jumped up and slapped Hannah's face.  James stopped Hannah and Starr from fighting, and Starr returned to Cole's side.\n\n\nTodd handed Starr a gun and told her to keep it pointed on Hannah.  As Todd, Blair, and James carried Cole out, Starr exclaimed that Hannah would return to Statesville.  Todd walked back into the room and took the gun away from Starr.  Todd requested that Starr accompany Cole to the hospital.  Todd was angry at Hannah, because she had held a gun on Sam and Starr, and she had shot his granddaughter's father.  Todd revealed that he would have no problem shooting Hannah.\n\n\nTodd announced to Hannah that he had shot his own mother, however, Hannah claimed that because Todd had shot his mother in self-defense, it did not count.  Todd replied, \"Tell that to my mother.\"  Todd admitted that Irene was \"dead as a doornail\" and then acknowledged that he had never understood that expression.  Todd then recommended to Hannah that she never kill her mother, because Irene had constantly taunted him since he had shot her.\n\n\nTodd explained that Irene had told him that he would lose everything that he had ever cared about.  Todd then realized that Irene had made a point, because if Blair knew the truth....  After Hannah wondered what the truth was, Todd considered telling her, because Hannah was bananas, so nobody would believe her anyway.  Todd sat quietly, so Hannah asked, \"Cat got your tongue?\"  Todd noted the expression and mentioned that another expression that he did not understand was \"a bird in hand.\"\n\n\nTodd started to tell Hannah the truth, just as two police officers walked in.  As one cop handcuffed Hannah, Todd handed the other one the gun.  Hannah screamed that Todd was a murderer and had been about to kill her, as the police officers escorted Hannah out the door.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Cole was wheeled into the emergency room, and the doctor told Starr and Blair that he would do what he could.  As the doctors looked Cole over, Starr cried over Cole, so Blair pulled her out of the room.  Starr gazed through the door window at Cole.  Starr then revealed to Blair that Cole had wanted to see Hope and Starr, so she had hid him in the cabana.  Starr remembered that Hope had been excited to see Cole.  Blair realized that Cole had been at the house when Hope had called out for her daddy.\n\n\nStarr added that Cole had been about to leave the property when Hannah had arrived and had held a gun on Sam.  Cole and Starr had walked in on that, and Hannah had shot Cole.  Blair hugged Starr.  Blair and Starr walked into the hospital church, and Starr feared that Cole would die.  Starr wondered what she would tell Hope, and she believed that she could not live in a world without Cole, and that a world without Cole would make no sense.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Allison Perkins bid Clint and Viki goodbye, as Clint and Viki declared their love for each other.  Allison shot a vase, and after noting that it was precious, indicated that it was not the first time that she had taken something precious from Viki.  After Viki asked what she meant, Allison explained that she had kidnapped Natalie, so that Jessica could live the life of luxury with Miss Viki and \"Hopalong Clint.\"\n\n\nAllison remembered that Natalie had grown up in a trailer park with Roxy, or at least, that was what Mitch had believed.  Allison voiced that although Mitch was a sacred vessel, he was not the sharpest crayon in the box.  However, Allison noted that Mitch could get very angry when he did not get what he wanted.  Allison reflected that Viki knew all about Mitch's demands.\n\n\nWhen Clint started to argue with Allison, she stated the facts by the numbers:  number one, Allison was the boss; number two, Mitch was the sacred vessel and therefore, must be served; number three, the messenger could use a little anger management; and number four, Allison had sworn to do whatever it took to placate the messenger's moods, even if it meant making the messenger believe something that was not exactly kosher.\n\n\nAllison then asked if Viki and Clint would love Natalie and Jessica any less if they were not sisters, but Viki and Clint were both confused by the question.  Allison dramatically announced that Natalie and Jessica were both Clint's daughters, and that when they had bought Natalie, they had received Jessica as a bonus.  Allison revealed that she had faked the paternity tests, and that Clint was really both girls' father.\n\n\nWhen Clint yelled that Allison was lying, she claimed that she had tried to tell Jessica, but that Jessica had refused to listen.  Allison then demanded that Viki and Clint sit down.  Allison related that when Viki was pregnant, Mitch had ordered Allison to check in with Dr. Balsom, and that was how Allison had learned that Viki had been pregnant with two babies, and that Clint was the father.  After Clint cried out, \"Bull,\" Allison exclaimed, \"That's what I said, but the doctor was adamant.  Two babies -- one daddy, which makes a hell of a lot more sense than two babies -- two daddies.  I mean, seriously, who in their right mind would believe that?  Oh wait, that's right.  Mitch.\"\n\n\nAllison claimed that she had been given no choice but to lie, because Mitch had placed his hands around her throat and would have killed her.  Allison revealed that she had told Mitch that he was the father of the second child, and that since Mitch had wanted to believe her, he had not strangled her.  Allison reminded Clint that he knew how easy it was to change paternity test results.  Allison insisted that they all celebrate, and that Viki and Clint should thank her.\n\n\nWhen Viki and Clint still hesitated, Allison pointed out that it would not serve Mitch to admit that Jessica was really Clint's daughter.  After Clint wondered why Allison had kept it a secret, Allison explained that Mitch would have done something bad to her if the spirit of Satan had been upon him.  Allison then shot Viki and shouted to Clint,  \"It's only fair.  I gave you Jessica; you owe me Viki.\"  Allison chanted around the room and declared that her aim had been true.\n\n\nBack in the hospital church, after Starr demanded to know what she could do, Blair replied, \"You know what we are going to do?  We...we're going to pray.\"  Starr cried, \"I don't even know how,\" and Blair responded, \"Yes...you can do that.  You just...you just listen to your heart, okay?  Think of it as...think of it as a song.  You just open up your heart, and the words will come, all right?  Okay.\"  Starr knelt to pray, \"God, please...\" and stopped.  Starr then sang a beautiful song, \"One Life to Live.\"\n\n\nAs Starr sang, Blair walked into the hall, where Todd found her in tears.  Todd held Blair in his arms.  James watched, as the doctors worked on saving Cole, and saw Jessica and the paramedics wheel Bobby into the emergency ward.  At the cottage, Nora untied Troy, who then bent over Bo.  At the church, John shot Mitch Laurence, who fell to the floor.  Natalie and John hugged and then kissed.  At Llanfair, Clint placed Viki's head on a pillow and then reached for the phone to call for help.  Clint suddenly clutched his chest and collapsed next to Viki.  The phone dropped to the floor. \n\n\n",
