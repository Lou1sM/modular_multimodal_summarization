Jared informs her that he did research on her mental illness and realizes she is scamming him.  He questions how she has been able to keep up this pretense for so long.  Jessica continues to behave as Tess; she tells him she needed to convince her family that \"Jessica\" was integrated.  Jessica claims she had plans to leave town until he (Jared) came to Llanview and derailed her plans.  Exhibiting seductive behavior, Jessica informs Jared that she plans to help him get something they both want.  Jared quickly deflects Jessica's accusation that he tampered with the DNA test.  Jessica explains that she wants the inheritance just as badly as he does; she tells him he will need an ally to convince the family to purchase the vineyard.  Jessica reveals that she will be his ally.  Jared reminds Jessica that Tess ruined his life; he declares that he would never get in bed with her literally or figuratively if she were the last woman on earth.   Jessica tells Jared that the guy Tess turned on was a loser; she is impressed with the new Jared who devised the plan to become a Buchanan.  Jared continues to question what Jessica's true intentions are.  Jessica tells him that aside from living the good life with the inheritance money, she will enjoy making fools out of the Buchanans.  This peaks Jared's interest; he becomes curious of Jessica's scheme.  Jessica suggests Jared presents his plan at the next BE board meeting.  She states that when the votes are cast, she will vote for him.  Jessica believes this gesture should convince him that Tess is back.  After little consideration, Jared informs Jessica that her idea proves she is not Tess.  Jared believes Tess would have a much clever plan; he questions how her one vote would help his cause.  Jessica tells him that the Buchanans accept whatever \"Jessica\" says; when Jessica speaks everyone listens.  Jessica tells Jared that once she states her case, the family will all follow suit.   Jessica asks Jared if he intends to go along with her plan.  Just as Jared prepares to give her an answer, an angry Nash walks through the door.  Nash wants answers from both Jared and Jessica about what is going on.\n\n\nWhile in bed, Adriana and Rex discuss plans for the upcoming wedding.

Claiming to have accidentally stumbled across the picture, Dorian asks Charlie the identity of the woman in the photograph. Charlie tells Dorian that Viki is a waitress and close friend from Paris, Texas.  Dorian continues to question Charlie about his relationship with Viki.  Charlie admits that the relationship was stalled because he had to come to Llanview.  He goes on to tell Dorian that his relationship with Viki is somewhat mysterious.  Charlie laughs when he admits that he and Viki never revealed their last names to one another.  Cunningly, Dorian reminds Charlie that she is not aware of his last name either.  Charlie tells Dorian that he goes by the name of Charlie \"B\".  Feeling comfortable with Dorian, Charlie confides that Viki has children that he knows very little about and states she has another life that he plans to learn more of.

In a desperate state, Marcie continues to hold Viki at gunpoint.  Viki attempts to reason with Marcie but to no avail.

Todd tells John he intends to find his son alone at all costs.  A frustrated John complies.  As the two arrive at the diner, they observe Marcie's car.  John convinces Todd to park out of sight so that Marcie does not panic when she sees them.  As Todd and John approach the door to the diner, Marcie is attempting to flee with Tommy in hand.

Natalie admires Miles' consideration for Roxy's feelings and wishes more men shared his kindness - namely Jared.  After leaving Miles' room momentarily, Natalie is approached by Nash who wants to discuss Jared's plans for his vineyard.   Natalie tells Nash that from a business stand point she feels Jared has a good idea but states she will not back the plan.  Nash worries that Natalie may be tempted by Jared's plan but she reassures him that family means everything to the Buchanans and no one on the board will side with Jared.  Before leaving, Nash lashes out at Natalie who continues to praise Jared's business plan to sell the vineyard.  He cannot understand why Natalie is falling for his con and states he believes Jared tampered with the DNA test.  Upon returning to Miles' room, she begins to express her hurt over Jared and seeks advice from Miles.  Miles suggests she falls in love with someone new.  Natalie feels the answer is to get Jared out of her head.  Suddenly, Natalie begins to consider the fact that Nash may be correct about Jared conning the entire family.
