An amorous moment between the lovebirds was interrupted when Natalie, holding Chloe, knocked on the front door. The moment she saw Rex's rumpled clothes, Natalie realized that her timing had been less than perfect. She began apologizing for dropping by unexpectedly. Rex brushed off Natalie's concerns while Gigi took Chloe from Natalie. As Gigi played with the baby, Natalie told Rex about her recent engagement to Jared. Rex and Gigi were happy for Natalie and congratulated her. They made plans to celebrate the engagement before Natalie and Chloe left. After they were gone, Rex brought up the subject of children. He told Gigi that he was sorry that he had not been around to help her when Shane was a baby. Talk of Shane's infancy led to them discussing the future. Gigi hoped that when they were more financially stable, that they could have another child. \n\n\nAt the diner, Jared tried his best to persuade David to return to Tibet. David took the opportunity to impart some wisdom. He urged Jared to follow David's example and right his own wrongs, such as deceiving the Buchanans when he pretended to be Asa's long-lost son. Jared appreciated David's concern but remained focused on his goal of sending David packing. To reach that end, Jared offered David a briefcase filled with money. David appeared momentarily tempted when his eyes glazed over with greed, but then David began chanting. When David was done, he pushed the money away and declined the offer. \n\n\nAt the St. Blazes Resort, Beaver Calhoun slowly woke up and was surprised to realize that he was in Dorian's bed. Initially, Dorian let Beaver believe that they had slept together after a night of revelry and drinking. What Beaver didn't realize was that Dorian had only pretended to drink with him. The truth was, Beaver had passed out before he could even kiss Dorian. When Beaver apologized for not remembering, Dorian admitted that he had nothing to apologize for since he did not \"close the deal.\" However, Dorian continued to fish for information by pretending that Beaver had confided the details of Asa's will to her. With his guard down, Beaver revealed enough for Dorian to learn that Asa had disinherited his legitimate heirs and left his entire fortune to David. While Beaver went to shower and change, Dorian took a moment to celebrate Clint's misfortune. \n\n\nDorian's joy was cut short when a knock at the door revealed Mel in the guise of a hotel maid. Mel warned Dorian that she was headed down the wrong path, but Dorian refused to listen. She chastised Mel for raining on her parade. Before Mel left, she told Dorian that she would need a mighty big umbrella if she intended to go through with her plans. Dorian ignored the warning. She was convinced that she could regain Buchanan Enterprises if she found David. \n\n\nAt the loft, Cris and Vanessa were stunned to learn that the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agent had received a report that their marriage was a sham. When Cris demanded to know who had made the claim, Sarah appeared in the doorway and took responsibility. Cris was taken aback but recovered quickly. He accused Sarah of being a jealous and vindictive bitch, who was bitter because he had dumped her for Vanessa. The ICE agent wasn't swayed. He told Cris and Vanessa that he didn't care who had reported the fraud, or why, because he was required to investigate the claim regardless. After the ICE agent left, Cris asked to speak to Sarah alone. When Vanessa attempted to make peace with Sarah, Sarah told her to \"save it.\" \n\n\nAfter Vanessa left, Cris asked Sarah why she had turned against him. He said that he thought she understood his reasons for marrying Vanessa and supported his decision. Sarah told Cris that she had seen Cris and Vanessa's New Year's Eve kiss and realized that Cris was not as immune to Vanessa as he claimed. Cris couldn't explain the kiss but insisted that Sarah was the woman he loved. Sarah was tired of being the understanding girlfriend, and announced that she was leaving town. She had been offered the opportunity to be Puddle of Mudd's road manager and she had decided to take the job. Cris objected to Sarah leaving, but in the end he was unable to persuade Sarah to change her mind. She told Cris goodbye and then walked out of his life. \n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel's restaurant, T\u00e9a tried to talk to Lola about Ray. Lola was very uncomfortable discussing her parents and became quite agitated. T\u00e9a backed off, but worked on gaining Lola's trust. Unfortunately, T\u00e9a's attempts to get closer to Lola were thwarted when Vanessa suddenly appeared and demanded to know what T\u00e9a and Lola were discussing. T\u00e9a deftly deflected the questions by asking Vanessa why she was at the restaurant instead of at the loft with Cris. The ploy worked because Vanessa told T\u00e9a about Sarah's accusation and the visit by the ICE agent. \n\n\nElsewhere in the restaurant, Nora did her best to persuade Clint and Viki to consider consenting to Tess testifying against Todd. Nora hoped that Tess knew of Todd's plans to kidnap Starr's baby. Viki and Clint objected. Viki explained that Jessica was in a fragile place at the moment and that her alters were unpredictable. Later, Viki told Clint that Bess was keeping a secret that had the potential to devastate Jessica if she learned of it. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Jessica approached Wes and Brody as they talked. The tension was thick as Wes asked her which personality she was. Jessica assured them that she was herself, not one of her alters. When Wes was introduced, Jessica tried to lighten the mood by joking that he could be one of his alters because of his name. She realized that the comment might have been inappropriate and apologized as she turned to leave. Wes stopped her. He told her that Brody had told him about her, and invited her to stay. \n\n\nAfter Wes left, Jessica turned to Brody to ask him what had happened while Tess had been in control. She was horrified as Brody told her the painful details of the ugly scene she had created when he had circumvented her attempts to escape the sanitarium. Jessica apologized for what she had put Brody through and decided to keep her distance from him. She told him that she had admitted herself to St. Anne's to protect the people that she cared for. Jessica went on to confess that she had grown to care for Brody. Brody refused to let her push him away. He insisted that she had helped him and that he believed that she could continue to do so. Jessica relented and admitted that Brody had helped her, too. As the two talked about their hopes for recovery, the young boy Brody was haunted by and Tess stood behind Brody and Jessica. \n\n\nWes stared at a picture of him and Brody while they were on their tour of duty. After a few minutes, Wes returned the picture to the drawer and prayed for Brody to let it all go.\n\n\n",
