She explains that it wasn't pre-planned, that it kind of just happened when he showed his arrogant side. She tries to convince her husband that she'll be able to expose Jared as the fraud that he is and that finally Natalie will be able to stop thinking about him. Nash is concerned that it's dangerous on a few different levels though; he's worried about her health, the fact that Tess might really return or that Jared will find out she's pretending and want to pay her back. She thinks that Jared is only consumed with power and money now, not the past, and she promises that his plan will not make the vote. Nash is scared too as his wife seems almost excited to be Tess again. Jess denies this and reminds him that she is made up of both Tess and Jess, she loves him, and he loves her. She's willing to do what it takes to bring Jared down. Jess thinks that if she obeys his request to not be Tess, then she'll just be playing good little wife as Nash watches everything he's worked for become wrecked. She's doing this for him and the family, he's assured. She promises him that nothing will happen. \n\n\nAdriana has cold feet and decides she really doesn't want to talk to Dorian about her blurted out New Year's comment, but Rex thinks they should head over to Dorian's so they can also tell her about their engagement. Over at La Boulaie, Dorian doesn't want to hear Charlie's objections, insisting that he'll stay there. She wants to look after him for his \"Viki.\" When Rex and Adriana arrive and announce their betrothal, she admits that while she gave her blessing, she's startled nonetheless. She's anxious to see the ring and is disappointed to see the toy, even though Adriana admits to really liking it. She mentions how the ring that Rex did buy her first is now involved in a police investigation, which leads to the other reason they're visiting, but Dorian advises them that she's busy with company and will have to discuss it another time. She introduces the young couple to Charlie, who hesitates on his last name and then blurts out Balsom after seeing something with Roxy's name. Rex is confused and wonders if they're related because that's HIS last name. Adriana mentions that Rex's mom owns the hotel at Angel Square. An uneasy Charlie manages to deflect questions as Dorian arrives with some champagne for a toast. Charlie is able to turn it down for some water instead, and a quick toast is made before the visitors are ushered out. Charlie tells Dorian that he has no children in answer to her inquiry and finally agrees to stay for just the night, before he's off to visit with his friend, Jared. \"Charlie Balsom, indeed,\" Dorian mutters as he heads up the stairs.\n\n\nRoxy walks into Miles' hospital room just as Natalie is leaning down to kiss him on the cheek. Furious, she accuses her daughter of stealing him from her and of being in love with him. Natalie tries to reason with her, explaining that they're just good friends and that she loves someone else. As she says this, she appears shocked herself, but is unwilling to share any of the details with Roxy, other than to mention that it's over anyway. Roxy doesn't believe that by the look on Nat's face. They're interrupted when Adriana and Rex show up to share their news. Rex mentions Charlie Balsom and thinks it's a good time for him to learn about his family tree. Roxy tries to discourage him and successfully changes the subject. She appears uneasy. \n\n\n\"Back off or I'll shoot her,\" Marcie threatens, when John and Todd try to get her to give in and settle peacefully. She doesn't want to shoot anyone -- but she will, she tells them. She closes the blinds on the door as Viki tries to talk to her calmly. Marcie cries that the only person she could ever love and trust is her son, and points out how even Viki is there to take her down. Viki explains how it's all a coincidence that they're even in the same town and that she's been there for quite some time. She points out that she didn't know anything at all about this entire situation involving Marcie, Todd and the baby until very recently. If Marcie gives up she won't press any charges, she indicates. Marcie is slowly becoming frantic and emotional and wants time to think. Standing outside, Todd wants to call the cops but John wants to try to speak with Marcie first. He calls the diner phone and begs her to give herself up so that she won't be in even more trouble. He asks to speak to Viki to make sure she's ok and asks her if she thinks Marcie would really shoot. Marcie grabs the phone back and when she hears Todd refer to Tommy as Sam, she loses it and hangs up. She rips apart her bags looking for the passports and accuses Viki of taking them. (John has them). Todd decides to call the cops and John asks for his unregistered gun so that he won't be arrested if he's found holding it. Viki tries to engage Marcie in conversation and asks about her family but the fugitive mom refuses to fall for it, thinking that Viki just wants her to realize what and who she's missing. They hear sirens and Marcie figures maybe she can leave via the loading dock. She demands the keys from Viki who has no idea where they might be. Both the local police and FBI show up along with the press. John assures the agent that Marcie will do anything to keep her child. Todd is interviewed on television. Inside, Viki continues to talk to the woman who is now closed in. She wants to speak with John. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, residents are astounded as they see the scene in Paris, Texas play out on the news. Jess and Nat learn of their mother's whereabouts. \n\n\n",
