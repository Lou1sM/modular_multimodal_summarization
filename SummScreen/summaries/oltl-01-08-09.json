    "soap_central": "\n The Mourning After \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, John expressed his opinion that Cole should attend school instead of sitting home worrying about his mother, whose whereabouts were unknown. Cole was concerned that Marty was out seeking revenge on Todd in some way. John reassured the young man that Marty was an adult and probably wanted to be alone. He was sure that she was finished with Todd. Cole felt that John was hiding something from him but John thought that Marty should be the one to explain the situation to her son. \n\n\nAn encounter at the Palace Hotel restaurant had Viki demanding to know why T\u00e9a was helping Todd. An unrelenting Viki was not satisfied with T\u00e9a's response that she was merely Todd's lawyer. Viki reminded her that T\u00e9a had appointed herself to the position. T\u00e9a felt that she and Todd had many similarities in their lives that connected them to each other, along with their previous marriage. She disagreed when Viki suggested that Todd was not the same man as he was in the past. Turning the tables, T\u00e9a wondered why Viki was not helping her brother through his latest troubled times, when she had always supported him in the past. \n\n\nViki explained that in the past she understood and aided Todd because of their terrible father, but Todd's actions during the past year changed things for her. She detailed what had happened with Jessica, her multiple personalities and Todd's knowledge of that, and Todd's confrontations with Starr and Cole. T\u00e9a attempted to make excuses for Todd, citing the fact that Todd really loved Starr more than anything in the world. Viki thought that was true once, but not any longer. She accused T\u00e9a of wearing blinders where Todd was concerned. \n\n\nA teary T\u00e9a broke the news of Todd's attempted suicide, causing a departing Viki to stop dead in her tracks. While she was hungry for more information, T\u00e9a was unable to provide much. T\u00e9a expressed her belief that it was Marty who told him to jump and she emphasized that Todd needed help. Viki was upset, because she had been emphatic in her resolve to be through with him this time. After hearing the news, she wasn't so sure. T\u00e9a confessed that she married Todd not only because of the connection they had, but because she had loved him. After Viki's departure, T\u00e9a looked at the wedding portrait of herself and Todd. \n\n\nA dizzy Marty woke up in a strange place, only to find an unexpected man walking through the door armed with a couple of cups of coffee. She managed to recall the events of New Year's Eve with Todd that led her to the situation she was in. The man in question was Wes, Brody's buddy, and he helped her through her cobwebbed memory. She had jumped onto the back of his motorcycle and crashed at his place in Angel Square, he explained. She had introduced herself as \"Marty the party girl Saybrooke\" and had asked him if he wanted sex. He had to tell her that there was no liquor or loud music allowed and that he could see that she only wanted a distraction, not sex. \n\n\nMarty was unaware of whether she knew Wes from her past or not, since he seemed to know her well. He explained that she reminded him of himself and that he did not know her previously. He had heard about her evening with Todd, resulting in Todd's jumping from the roof of the Palace. \n\n\nA quite tipsy Marty had seemed disappointed that she couldn't kill the guy, who certainly deserved it, she had told him. He had confessed to his own need for distraction after his first tour of duty to Iraq and Afghanistan, when he had pretended to be the same as he was before the tour. Needing to get away, he had signed up for a second tour. He wanted to start his life over again, he had explained. He confessed that Marty had fallen asleep by the time he had finished telling her about his life, but it was cathartic for him to talk anyway. He had tucked her in for the night. Marty offered to listen to him another time. \n\n\nTodd was dreaming about the events of New Year's Eve, but was startled awake by Blair, who stopped by to check on him. \"I'm alive, no thanks to you,\" he snapped at her. He was angry that she had saved his life when he and Marty had tried so hard to end it. A confused Blair could hardly believe that Todd actually wanted to kill himself, especially since he had been wearing a tuxedo! It suddenly dawned on her that he had done it for Marty, to make up for all that he had done to her. She wondered why Marty had so much power over Todd, seemingly more than his own children. \n\n\nThis caused the pair to argue over Todd's parenting skills, with Blair pointing out that Todd never acted like an adult. She also stressed that he never loved Marty and never would, and that it was all merely a fantasy. She reminded him that he had never loved anyone who didn't want him to change, and Marty didn't fit that bill. Obviously, she hadn't wanted him to change because she didn't remember the past, Blair continued.  \nShe accused him of deserting all of the people who knew him and loved him, anyway. \n\n\nBlair wondered what she was supposed to tell the kids, who were certainly missing him. She would always be there for them, just as she had always been there for Todd. Blair reminded him how happy they had been until he had caught Starr and Cole together after they had sex. She felt that it had just reminded him of himself and Marty. She advised him that he needed to wake up, get over it, and put the past behind him once and for all. Since he could not change what happened with Marty, he needed to accept it and move on, she added. She strongly urged him to be loving, wondering if he was capable of doing that, so that he could see his kids again. \"Like when I was with you?\" he asked. \n\n\nAt school, Starr was surprised that not a soul had mentioned her pregnancy, while she and Langston wondered why they hadn't seen Cole. Starr knew that something was happening, since her mom had insisted on a family breakfast. She explained that Blair always did that when something was wrong. \n\n\nCole finally showed up, explaining that he had been worried about his mother. Awkwardly, he and Starr seemed unsure of how to behave regarding her pregnancy. When a fellow student asked about the birth and excitedly told them that her sister had extra baby clothes, they uncomfortably told her that the baby had died. They only hoped the passing of time would make things easier. They both received comforting words from others, but Cole received an extra offer. His classmate held out a joint, suggesting he head to the park by the river to light up. He thought that might ease Cole's pain. \n\n\nAt the caf\u00e9, Roxy apologized to Charlie for pretending that he had proposed marriage to Viki. Natalie arrived with Chloe and announced that Jared was once again working at Buchanan Enterprises. Roxy asked when Natalie might have her own baby, expressing her desire to become a grandmother again. Natalie quickly put a stop to that conversation, as Charlie chuckled but agreed with Roxy on the premise. John arrived and learned from Roxy that Marty was seen at the Palace and had left with a man on a motorcycle. Roxy had thought it was John who was having such a good time with Marty. John questioned others at the caf\u00e9. \n\n\nNeeding to get to work, Wes offered to drop Marty off at home. He was in the midst of changing his shirt when there was a knock on the door. As Marty put on her boots, a shirtless Wes opened the door to reveal a surprised John. \n\n\n",
