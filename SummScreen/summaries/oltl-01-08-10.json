    "soap_central": "\nMissing You\n\n\nTodd was surprised when Blair, Addie, Starr, Langston, and the boys stormed into his home and announced that they needed a place to stay.  After explaining that Dorian had fired Bo as police commissioner and hired the corrupt former Mayor Lowell, Blair related that they were appalled by Dorian's actions and could no longer reside under her roof.\n\n\nLater, Blair pulled Todd aside and asked if he had made any progress toward mending his relationship with Danielle.  An emotional Todd informed Blair that T\u00e9a and Danielle had returned home to Tahiti.  Relating that Danielle hated him for killing Ross, Todd told Blair that T\u00e9a had promised the teen that she would never reunite with Todd.  He explained that T\u00e9a believed that Danielle would forgive him once she had time to process what had happened.  Todd also admitted to Blair that he had told T\u00e9a that he loved her before she left.  \n\n\nRealizing that Todd was heartbroken over the lost of T\u00e9a and his daughter, Blair assured Todd that T\u00e9a  and Danielle would eventually return to Llanview, but Todd was doubtful.   Blair insisted that T\u00e9a would never allow Danielle to hate Todd for the rest of his life.  While Blair tried to cheer Todd up, Starr interrupted and announced that she was going out.  To everyone's surprise, Todd lashed out at his daughter for being disrespectful.  Afterward, Blair explained to a stunned Starr that Todd was depressed over losing T\u00e9a and pleaded with her daughter to understand.\n\n\nOnce Todd's mood had softened, he asked Blair if she was involved with someone.  Blair refused to provide him with any information, and insisted that she was capable of taking care of herself.   As Todd continued to pressure Blair for answers about her love life, Jack interrupted his parents and suggested that the family play a game.  While everyone prepared to enjoy family time together, Blair removed Elijah's business card from her pocket, and smiled to herself.\n\n\nLater, Blair observed Todd slip out of the house unnoticed by the others.  Peering from the doorway, Blair watched as Todd stood outside and stared at T\u00e9a's photo.  Blair stepped back inside the house and tightly held onto Elijah's card.   Out on the porch, Todd looked up at the sky and called out, \"Goodnight, T\u00e9a!\"\n\n\nIn Tahiti, T\u00e9a and Danielle arrived at the home they once shared with Ross.  Stepping inside the familiar home, Danielle couldn't help but remember the good times she spent with Ross.  As she comforted her daughter, T\u00e9a had a flashback of the intimate encounter that she had shared with Todd earlier that day.   A sobbing Danielle thanked her mother for returning home.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, at the drug rehabilitation center, a triumphant Schuyler happily announced to Rachel that Gigi had chosen him over Rex.   A call from T\u00e9a interrupted Schuyler and Rachel's discussion.  T\u00e9a phoned to inform Rachel that she and Danielle were in Tahiti.  Rachel was shocked to learn that Todd had agreed to allow T\u00e9a to leave with Danielle without a fight.  T\u00e9a told Rachel that Todd had confessed that he loved her and his only wish was for her and Danielle to be happy.  Insisting that Todd had changed, T\u00e9a added that he would be fine because he would eventually turn to Blair.  Rachel wondered if T\u00e9a would return to Llanview someday.  Observing her distraught daughter, T\u00e9a responded, \"I hope so.  That would mean that I told Danielle the truth and that she's ready to meet her father!\"\n\n\nAfter ending her call to Rachel, T\u00e9a returned to her daughter's side.   Reminiscing about her father, Danielle declared, \"My father would still be alive if that bastard hadn't shot him!\"   Attempting to reason with Danielle, T\u00e9a reminded the teen that Todd had only acted in her best interest when he shot Ross.   Later that night, Danielle made a shrine to honor Ross.   Crying uncontrollably, Danielle removed a photo of Ross from the stand and placed it next to her as she lay on the floor.   Meanwhile, consumed with thoughts of Todd, T\u00e9a stepped outside to be alone.  Staring up at the sky, T\u00e9a whispered, \"I miss you Todd!  Goodnight!\"\n\n\nOnce she regained her composure, T\u00e9a stepped back inside and closed the door.  Moments later, a man who was holding his shoulder and grimacing in pain stumbled to the door.  The man was Ross Rayburn.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Rachel listened as Schuyler discussed his future with Gigi and Shane.  Schuyler considered renting a two-bedroom apartment to accommodate Shane.  Reminding Schuyler that Shane resented him, Rachel doubted that Rex would allow Shane to reside in a home with Schuyler.  To Rachel's surprise, Schuyler presented her with a proposition.  Schuyler suggested that he and Rachel become roommates.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rex and Gigi met to discuss their separation and Shane's future.  Gigi was shocked when Rex informed her that he had consulted with an attorney about seeking full custody of Shane.  Convinced that Rex was determined to punish her, Gigi reminded him that it had been his idea to separate while she figured things out.  When an angry Rex accused Gigi of being in love with Schuyler for several months, Gigi lashed out at him for sleeping with Stacy.\n\n\nAfter an intense argument, Rex told Gigi that it was in Shane's best interest for Gigi to raise their son at the cottage.  Rex agreed to move out of the cottage under one condition -- Schuyler was to never to go near Shane.  Unable to reason with Rex, Gigi finally agreed to his terms.  As Gigi walked away, she looked back at Rex and told him that she still cared for him.  Turning away, a devastated Rex simply replied, \"Don't!\"\n\n\nLater, Gigi paid Schuyler a visit at the drug rehabilitation center.  Excusing herself, Rachel told Schuyler that she had to tell Greg the news.  Alone with Gigi, Schuyler informed her that he and Rachel had decided to share an apartment.  Noticing that Gigi was distracted, Schuyler wondered how her visit with Rex had gone.  Schuyler became frustrated when Gigi related Rex's terms.  Upon learning that Rex had agreed to move out of the cottage, Schuyler wondered if Rex might move in with Stacy.   After a long sigh, Gigi responded, \"Please, don't go there!\"\n\n\nAfter an intense struggle with Nurse Charles, Stacy managed to pierce the woman with her own syringe. Once the woman fell to the floor, Stacy attempted to flee the loft, but nearly panicked when she discovered Mitch Laurence standing in the doorway.  In a stern voice, Mitch declared, \"You're the vessel and you're carrying my future.  Whether you follow me or you're taken is entirely up to you!\"\n\n\nWhen Stacy made an attempt to phone the police, Mitch laughed and announced that Lowell was the new police commissioner.  Relating that Lowell had dropped the charges against him, Mitch informed her that he owned Lowell.  Mitch ordered Stacy to leave with him, but she continued to resist.  Losing patience with Stacy, Mitch exclaimed, \"You're mine, at least until my grandson is born, afterward, I'll have no use for you! This kid is mine!\"  \n\n\nTerrified, Stacy blurted out, \"It's not your grandchild!\"  An amused Mitch listened as Stacy explained that she lost Rex's baby and became pregnant by someone else.   While Mitch refused to believe her, they both noticed that Nurse Charles had regained consciousness.  Mitch instructed the nurse to help him carry Stacy out of the apartment.\n\n\nAs Mitch and Nurse Charles wrestled with a feisty Stacy, Rex opened the door and demanded to know what was going on.  Stacy rushed into Rex's arms and sobbed uncontrollably.  Believing that Mitch had escaped from jail, Rex announced that he was phoning the police. Insisting that the charges against him had been dropped, Mitch told Rex that Bo had been fired.  Refusing to believe Mitch's claims, Rex phoned the precinct and was shocked by the news.\n\n\nWhen Stacy threatened to press charges against him for kidnapping, Mitch claimed that he and the nurse showed up at the loft to provide Stacy with medical care for his unborn grandchild.  Showing Mitch the door, Rex warned Mitch to never approach Stacy again.  With a sly smile, Mitch stated, \"You're not going to kill your father!\"  \n\n\nOnce Mitch and Nurse Charles had left, an emotional Stacy flew into a panic.  She explained to Rex that Mitch wanted to steal her unborn child and then do away with her.  Fearing that Mitch would return, Stacy insisted, \"He's going to hurt me because I'm all alone!\"  To Stacy's surprise, Rex declared, \"You're not alone.  I'm moving back!\"  A look of relief crossed Stacy's face.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian's dead husband, Mel, appeared before her.  Presenting her with a rose, Mel exclaimed, \"Another fine mess you've gotten yourself into!\"  Reminding Dorian that he always paid her a visit when she was experiencing a crisis, Mel stated that he wanted to help her.  When Mel shook his head in disgust concerning Dorian's recent behavior, Dorian insisted that Mitch would kill her family unless she did his bidding.  Mel inquired about Dorian's next move.  Dorian pleaded with him to provide her with an answer, as he always had done in the past.  Mel stated that Mitch would leave her alone if she were no longer the mayor.  Insisting that she wasn't a quitter, Dorian refused to resign from her office.\n\n\nAppearing defeated, Dorian told Mel that she was helpless and that Mitch owned her.  Mel insisted that Dorian was a strong woman and would need all her strength to fight Mitch.  Suddenly, Dorian announced that she could kill Mitch.  Mel expressed his displeasure at the idea of Dorian committing murder, and related that Mitch Laurence would never remain dead.  When Dorian pleaded with Mel to provide her with a solution to her problem, Mel asked her to dance with him.  Dorian doubted that a dance would provide her with an answer, but Mel urged her to give it a chance.\n\n\nAs Mel held her in his arms, Dorian moaned in delight, \"Oh, Mel!\"  Mel warned Dorian to save her soul and not to contemplate murdering Mitch.  When Mel announced that he had to leave, Dorian pleaded, \"You can't go.  You haven't told me what to do!  Don't leave me all alone in this house!\"  Looking back, Mel stated that she was never alone because he was always in her heart.    Afterward, Dorian sat alone and declared, \"You're right I'm not alone!  I'm going to figure out something!\"  Dorian was horrified when Mitch appeared before her and joked, \"Honey, I'm home!\"\n\n \n\n\n",
