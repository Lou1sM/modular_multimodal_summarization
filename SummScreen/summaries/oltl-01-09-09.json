    "soap_central": "\nT\u00e9a and Sympathy  \n\n\nBlair arrived at Todd's home and tried to convince him to take responsibility for attempting to kidnap Starr's baby. Suggesting that Todd should stop feeling sorry for himself, Blair begged him to do the right thing for the sake of his children. Blair believed that Todd still possessed some level of goodness, but was adamant that he should pay for his crimes. Blair maintained that Todd's plan to kidnap Starr's child was despicable, and she was certain that Starr would never forgive him. Displaying little reaction to Blair's pleas, Todd continued to plunge into a sea of self-pity. Unbeknownst to them both, they were secretly being videotaped. Blair hoped to trigger some emotion from Todd and presented him with a photo of his family during happier times. \n\n\nAn emotionless Todd wondered why Blair was included in the picture. Fed up with Todd's harsh demeanor, Blair opened the door to leave. She received an unpleasant surprise - T\u00e9a stood on the other side of the door. As T\u00e9a entered the hose, the videotaping continued. T\u00e9a insisted upon knowing why Blair had decided to pay Todd a visit. Ignoring T\u00e9a's questioning, Blair begged Todd to convince T\u00e9a not to cross-examine Starr on the stand. T\u00e9a reminded Blair that Starr had volunteered her services, and argued that she was only in search of the truth. Before leaving, an angered Blair remarked, \"You wouldn't know the truth if it jumped up and slapped you in the head!\" As Blair left in a huff, Todd and T\u00e9a shared a laugh at her amusing comeback. \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a reminisced about how Todd helped her recover after Blair pushed her out of a window, Todd insisted that he wasn't that same person. Reminding Todd that she wanted to keep him from going to prison, T\u00e9a insisted that Todd tell her the truth about his plan to steal Starr's child. Todd complied and described the kidnapping plot in great detail, naming Dr. Joplin and Janet as his accomplices. Todd related that Starr was to believe that her baby had died and that he and Marty would raise the child far away from Llanview. \n\n\nT\u00e9a was convinced that Nora couldn't prove her case because Dr. Joplin was dead, but expressed concern over Janet Ketring's whereabouts. Todd stated that he had no idea where Janet had relocated and didn't care, but T\u00e9a believed that it was vital to have knowledge of Janet's whereabouts because she was the only possible witness. When Todd related that Tess knew about the kidnapping attempt, but was in no condition to testify, T\u00e9a's concern over locating Janet intensified. T\u00e9a wondered why Dr. Joplin would allow herself to be blackmailed by Todd. He admitted that he had threatened to reveal that her son had stolen drugs from the hospital and that she had covered up his crime. \n\n\nAt Llanview High School, Starr, Langston, and Markko sat in class and awaited the arrival of their new science teacher. To Starr and Langston's surprise, an attractive young man entered the classroom and introduced himself as Mr. J. The girls smiled as the new teacher announced that he would be teaching the class with a hands-on approach. Impressed by her instructor's good looks, Langston made a comment that obviously annoyed Markko. After mentioning that his course would focus on human biology, Mr. J overheard Starr make a sarcastic remark. Displeased by her lack of attention, the teacher asked her to explain her knowledge of human reproduction. \n\n\nWhen Starr hesitated, Markko answered for her. Although impressed with Markko's knowledge on the subject, the teacher questioned Starr's inability to answer his question. Defending Starr, an angered Langston informed Mr. J that Starr was one of the smartest kids in the class and nearly blurted out that Starr knew a great deal about the subject due to firsthand experience. Before Langston inadvertently brought up Starr's pregnancy, Starr spoke up. Starr advised him that she was well aware of the subject because she had given birth to a child that had died. Mr. J quickly apologized and continued with his class overview. Starr appeared troubled as she observed a picture of a human embryo in her textbook. \n\n\nMr. J dismissed the class and asked to have a word alone with Starr. Mr. J apologized for being insensitive to Starr and related that he had no idea of her situation. He confessed that he hadn't been given a class roster and didn't even know her name. When Starr informed him that her last name was Manning, Mr. J cringed and declared, \"If I knew you were in this class, I wouldn't have taken the job!\" Appalled by his statement, Starr wondered exactly what her new instructor had against her. He revealed that his name was actually Schuyler Joplin and that Dr. Joplin was his mother. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the school corridor, a drug pusher offered Cole marijuana. When Cole refused the offer, the dealer challenged him to try something a bit stronger. Without hesitation, Cole stated, \"Hook me up!\" When Matthew appeared and interrupted the discussion, Cole quickly pulled him aside and the drug dealer walked away. Expressing concern for Cole, Matthew reminded him that he understood what it was like to have a mother who had suffered memory loss. Cole wondered how Matthew had dealt with the pain. Matthew admitted that he was a child at the time, and inquired how Cole was handling his problems with Marty. When Cole responded that he hung out with friends, Matthew asked to tag along. Suggesting that Matthew hang out with kids his own age, Cole encouraged him to be his own person and not try to fit in with the cool crowd. A few of Matthew's new friends approached and asked him to join them as they met up with some girls. Matthew quickly agreed and walked off with the boys. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Nora met with Antonio and Talia to discuss gathering evidence to use against Todd at his upcoming hearing. Insisting that her only chance of getting justice for Marty was to get Todd convicted on kidnapping charges, Nora said that she wanted to meet away from the station because she feared that Todd and T\u00e9a might have their sources planted there. Nora explained that her case was in jeopardy because she was missing a key witness to Todd's plan to kidnap Starr's baby. When Talia inquired about possible witnesses, Nora mentioned Tess but Antonio quickly dismissed the idea. Upon hearing that Nora had inquired about speaking with Tess, Antonio expressed his concern that Jessica's recovery could be damaged as a result and demanded that Nora give up the idea of questioning her. Talia quietly listened as Antonio spoke out in defense of Jessica. Nora assured Antonio that she would never risk jeopardizing Jessica's recovery for her case and mentioned that Viki had denied her access to Jess anyway. \n\n\nAs Antonio and Talia discussed possible witnesses, Nora explained her reasons for believing that Dr. Joplin was involved in Todd's scheme, but couldn't prove it because of her suicide. After ruling out Keyes, the bodyguard, Nora announced that there was a potential witness that both Marty and Todd trusted - Janet Ketring. Nora gave her officers an update of Janet's history, including her stint as a prostitute with Renee's brothel. While Antonio, Talia, and Nora discussed their plan to locate Janet, they were unaware that an unknown party was recording their conversation and actions. Nora instructed Antonio and Talia to find Janet and bring her in for questioning. After giving detailed orders, Nora was anxious to spend time with Matthew and ran off to meet him at home. \n\n\nLater, Talia phoned Blair and briefed her about Janet's possible connection to the attempted kidnapping. When Talia suggested that Starr's cooperation would place a nail in Todd's coffin, Blair hung up on her. Talia couldn't understand how Blair could still have feelings for Todd. Antonio told her that Blair and Todd had a history and were bonded for life. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Matthew rushed into the house and asked Renee if his mother was home. When told that she hadn't arrived, Matthew walked away as his cell phone rang. He answered, but the person on the other end hung up without saying anything. The mystery caller wore a black glove. \n\n\nIn Wes's room in the Angel Square Hotel, John interrupted Wes and Marty. Wes insisted that John leave at once, but John demanded to know if Wes had hurt Marty. An angry Marty told John that she wanted to be with Wes and ordered him to leave her alone. John pleaded with Marty to allow him to help her, but Marty blamed John for saving Todd's life and stated that he should have let Todd die. When Marty remarked that she was staying in Wes's room of her own free will, John quipped, \"Just as you were staying at Todd Manning's.\" Furious that John would throw Todd up in her face, Marty demanded that he leave. \n\n\nBegging Marty to leave with him, John mentioned that Cole was worried about her. A curious Wes inquired about Cole and wondered if John was a cop. Marty revealed that John was once a cop as well as her ex-lover. Confessing that she suffered from memory loss, Marty admitted that Cole was her son and that she had no memory of him. Consumed with guilt, Marty said that all she would ever bring to Cole was hurt and disappointment. She was convinced that he would be better off believing that she was dead. Maintaining that Cole needed his mother, John continued to ask Marty to come with him and insisted that she didn't belong in Wes's room. John warned Wes that he would kill him if he hurt Marty, but Wes didn't appear bothered by John's threats. John warned Marty that her actions were dangerous and that she was allowing Todd to destroy her. Before leaving, John told Marty that he would only be a few feet away if she needed him. Realizing that Marty had no idea that he resided at the hotel, John alerted her that the hotel was also his home. As John exited the room, Marty shook her head in disgust. \n\n\nReturning to his room, John discovered Blair there. They both discussed their encounters with their former lovers. \n\n\nMarkko teased Langston about her crush on Mr. J. He playfully remarked that he would give Lola a call. Nearby, the drug pusher promised Cole that his friend would provide him with a high-powered drug later. Upon noticing Langston and Markko, Cole interrupted and asked where Starr was. They advised him that Starr needed to speak with the teacher after class. When his friends asked if he was okay, Cole insisted that he was. The drug dealer watched with curiosity. \n\n\nNora arrived at the mansion and greeted Matthew. When he received a call on his cell phone from someone named Becca, Matthew quickly excused himself and ran upstairs to talk in private. Nora accidentally knocked over Matthew's backpack and was stunned to find marijuana in one of his textbooks. Meanwhile, Renee stood in the foyer as the doorbell chimed. As she opened the door, a gloved hand grabbed her and pulled her outside. \n\n\nConcerned for Marty, Wes offered her a place to stay. He told her that he needed to get to work, but understood if she wanted to leave. Marty gave him a friendly kiss. She retrieved a picture of her and John from her purse. She looked troubled as she recalled John's warnings. \n\n\nT\u00e9a warned Todd that she needed to find Janet Ketring before Nora did. \n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio placed a call to someone regarding Janet's whereabouts. He was surprised by the answer he received. \n\n\nOutside the mansion, a woman dressed in black revealed herself to Renee. The woman was Lee Halpern. A fearful Lee informed Renee that she was using the name Janet Ketring. Janet begged Renee for her help. \n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd, \"If Janet Ketring shows up, you're screwed!\"\n\n\n",
