Viki informs Todd that Marcie does not want to hurt anyone.  When Agent Sutton asks Viki to answer some questions, Todd explodes and wants to know what further actions the FBI plans to take in order to get Sam released.

Meanwhile, Agent Sutton tells John that he has plans to enter the caf\u00e9 if Marcie does not surrender soon.

Marcie tells Michael she loves him and wants to be a family again.  Michael attempts to reason with Marcie by explaining she must return Tommy to Todd.  Michael tells Marcie that she cannot leave because she has committed a crime by holding Viki hostage at gunpoint. Marcie contends that she is not a criminal but Todd is.   Michael says that Tommy will be placed in danger if she attempts to flee with him.

Todd begins to blame himself for the current situation; he feels perhaps he should have been more compassionate towards Marcie.  Todd feels he may have handled the entire custody of Sam incorrectly; he wonders if he hadn't acted so impatiently maybe Marcie would have never took off with Sam.  Viki tells Todd he must move forward and not live in the past.  While talking to Agent Sutton, Marcie demands that he provide her request for a getaway car and reminds him that she still has a hostage.

He tells her Todd may have many faults but he is a good father.  Michael says Tommy will be better off with Todd than with he and Marcie.  Michael explains that they must let Tommy go on their own and if they do not, he fears he will have to say goodbye to both of them again.
