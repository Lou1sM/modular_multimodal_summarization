During their tryst on the living room floor, Shane interrupted when he walked in and found his parents half-dressed. Shane was embarrassed and ran off. Gigi worried that their actions might have scarred their son for life. After Rex assured her that Shane would understand, Gigi insisted that Rex explain sex to their son. When Rex expressed his concern about being alone with Shane, Gigi reminded him that she was late for work, and encouraged him to have a heart-to-heart chat with their son. Once Gigi had left, a nervous Rex called Shane downstairs for a man-to-man talk. \n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio learned that Janet had booked a flight to Vegas, but never got on the plane. He told Talia that he believed she might still be in Llanview. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Renee was thrilled to learn that Janet was alive and well. Janet quickly put an end to the happy reunion by begging Renee to hide her. Renee escorted Janet inside the foyer of the mansion. \n\n\nMeanwhile, inside the living room, Nora held the marijuana in her hand and phoned Bo. Nora informed Bo, \"We have a big problem!\" Before Nora could state the reason for her concern, Bo received a call from the mayor and asked if he could call Nora back. Nora hung up and raced to the door. At that moment, Renee demanded to know why Janet needed a place to hide. Before she could explain, the women heard Nora approaching the foyer, and Janet managed to hide before Nora spotted her. Once Nora rushed out the door to meet Bo, Janet returned and explained her dilemma to Renee. \n\n\nBack at the station, Antonio and Talia gave Bo an update on their findings concerning Janet. Bo informed his officers that the mayor was eager to see Todd convicted on the kidnapping charges, and instructed them to continue their search for Janet. Nora interrupted the discussion and asked to speak privately with Bo. Inside his office, Nora presented Bo with the marijuana she had found among Matthew's belongings. Outraged, Bo insisted upon confronting Matthew immediately. Attempting to calm him down, Nora pleaded with Bo to have an open mind when they spoke with Matthew. Nora feared that if Matthew were placed on the defensive that they could possibly never learn the truth. She believed that Matthew might have a reasonable explanation for having the drug in his possession. The two headed off to confront their son. \n\n\nRenee was stunned to learn that Todd had employed Janet as Marty's caregiver. Relating that she had originally worked for Lee Ramsey, Janet insisted that she had only wanted to help Marty and had been unaware of Todd's true motives concerning her. Reminding Janet of her checkered past, Renee wanted to know if Janet was in trouble with the law. When Janet proclaimed her innocence, Renee attempted to call Bo but Janet pleaded with her to reconsider. Admitting that she might have knowledge that could place her in danger, a terrified Janet pleaded with Renee to help her. Concerned for her old friend, Renee offered her temporary refuge in the guesthouse. Advising her that they needed to be careful, Renee led Janet out the back entrance. At that very moment, Bo and Nora returned to question Matthew. An angered Bo yelled for Matthew to come downstairs. In a stern voice, Bo demanded that his son take a seat. Displaying the marijuana, Nora asked him to explain. \n\n\nAt Todd's residence, T\u00e9a was desperate to locate Janet, but Todd was convinced that she was far away and would never confess her role in the kidnapping attempt. Unconvinced, T\u00e9a continued to worry about Janet surfacing, and expressed her concern about the effect Dr. Joplin's suicide might have on Todd's case. T\u00e9a feared that the doctor might have revealed the truth to someone before taking her life. A confident Todd believed that Dr. Joplin would never have told because she hadn't wanted her son's crime exposed. Todd assured T\u00e9a that a parent would do anything to protect their child. \n\n\nAt Llanview High School, Starr was stunned to learn that Mr. J was actually Dr. Joplin's son. Starr blamed herself for his mother's death, but Schuyler assured her that his mother had been consumed with guilt for misdiagnosing Starr's condition. Schuyler was surprised that Starr didn't hold his mother responsible for the death of her child. Starr listened as he blamed himself for his mother's suicide. He confessed that he had let her down. After regaining his composure, Mr. Joplin reminded Starr that he was her teacher, and attempted to end the conversation. Citing that she had problems accepting her father for the person that he really was, Starr suggested that Dr. Joplin might have been fighting demons that he was unaware of. Schuyler admitted that his mother had appeared troubled during the last few months of her life and he stated that he wished he knew why. \n\n\nUpon learning the name of Dr. Joplin's son, T\u00e9a told Todd that she was going to find out exactly what information the prosecution had concerning Todd's case. As she opened the door, both she and Todd were surprised to find Viki standing there. In a gruff voice, Todd asked, \"What do you want?\" Entering the home, Viki told her brother that she was thankful that he hadn't succeeded in taking his life. Hoping to make Viki feel guilty, Todd accused her of abandoning him. Viki reminded Todd of the terrible pain he had caused his family, but Todd confessed his love for Marty and claimed that Marty had made him a better person. \n\n\nAfter advising Todd to stop lying to himself, Viki confessed that she still believed that there was hope for him. Citing all the troubles he faced, Todd declared that he didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel. Recalling the time that Todd returned from Ireland, Viki reminded him that he had referred to himself as a lost cause. She reminisced about the hope and love she witnessed in his eyes when he held Starr for the very first time. Viki suggested that he allow his love for Starr to help him start over again. \n\n\nEntering the station, T\u00e9a placed a call to someone and instructed them to provide her with any information regarding Leah Joplin. After overhearing Talia and Antonio discussing Janet, T\u00e9a demanded to view their files. Annoyed, Antonio explained that T\u00e9a would need a subpoena and questioned why she was snooping around the station. When Antonio suggested that she was worried about her case, T\u00e9a denied having any worries, and assured him that she would eventually gain access to any information he had collected. After T\u00e9a left, Talia continued to discuss her findings with Antonio. Talia had learned that Janet checked into a hotel room the night that Starr delivered her baby - she hadn't checked out until the previous night. Displaying a folder, Antonio stated that he had obtained important information. Antonio was in possession of Todd's phone records. The records revealed that several calls had been placed between Todd and Dr. Joplin. \n\n\nViki was certain that Todd's love for Starr could turn his life around. Before leaving, Viki told her brother that she would miss him if he weren't around. Alone, Todd stared at the photo that Blair had given him of their family. Deep in thought, he picked up his phone and placed a call. \n\n\nWhen Starr informed Mr. Joplin that she intended to remain in his class, he insisted that they maintain a student-teacher relationship and keep their connection private. Agreeing to keep their conversation under wraps, Starr told her teacher how kind his mother had been to her. Their discussion was interrupted when Mr. J received a call on his cell phone. Starr said goodbye and left him alone. Out in the hall, Starr's cell phone rang. Realizing that Todd was the caller, Starr ignored the call. Todd hung up without leaving a message. Meanwhile, Schuyler answered his cell. T\u00e9a introduced herself and asked to speak with him. She stated that it concerned his mother. \n\n\nIn a nearby corridor of the school, a drug dealer handed Cole a bag containing some pills. He told Cole that the drugs would help him \"check out\" for a while. Cole hesitated initially, but changed his mind when the drug pusher reminded him of the troubles concerning his mother and the loss of his child. Accepting the drugs, Cole asked, \"How much?\" \n\n\nInside John's apartment, John told Blair that he had located Marty. A frustrated Blair recalled the night of New Year's Eve when John interrupted their date to rescue Marty. John defended his actions. He insisted that he was concerned for Marty's safety, and reminded her that they had agreed not to place demands on each other. A defensive Blair shouted that she didn't want to be involved with another man that was obsessed with Marty. John accused her of not being over Todd. Blair claimed that she only had a concern for Todd because of their children, but John remained convinced that she wasn't over him. As they argued, John's phone rang. When Blair remarked that he should answer because it could be Marty, John ignored the call. Meanwhile, Cole left a message asking if John had located his mother. Before hanging up, Cole confessed, \"I'm freaking out!\" \n\n\nBlair told John that she could never love Todd after learning of the pain he had caused Marty. She also confessed that she refused to wait on a man who continuously left her to chase after another woman. Apologizing to her, John revealed that Marty was in serious trouble. At that moment, Cole attempted to knock on John's door, but hesitated after hearing his mother's name being mentioned. Cole overheard John admit that Marty was out of control. He stated that he had found her in a nearby room with a stranger. John expressed his fear that Marty was headed down a dangerous road, and he was worried about her and Cole. A devastated Cole ran off to find his mother. John assured Blair that he didn't want to be with Marty, he only wanted Blair. Blair admitted that she wanted to be with John. As she struggled to apologize, John pulled her into an embrace and they shared a passionate kiss. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Cole banged on a nearby door and called out Marty's name. \n\n\nJohn and Blair forgave each other and made love.\n\n\n",
