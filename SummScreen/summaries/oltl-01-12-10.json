    "soap_central": "\n \nMarkko was surprised when Langston showed up at his apartment and announced that she had walked out on Dorian. She professed that she didn't understand her mother, and she had no intentions of talking to Dorian again. Markko was shocked to hear about Dorian's moves regarding Bo's firing as police commissioner. He thought that Langston shouldn't feel so strong about not talking to Dorian again, as the woman had been a real mother to Langston. Langston admitted that he was right but promised she would never forgive Dorian. Markko invited Langston to move in with him.\n\n\nA surprised Langston was sure that Markko's parents would \"freak\" if they knew that she had moved in with their son. Markko was confident that he could persuade them to see things differently, and Langston agreed to move in. Markko grimaced in pain when Langston put her arms around him. He thought that he had overdone it at the gym. Langston admitted to bumping into Ford, who had told her about Markko lifting weights. Frowning, Markko wondered why Langston had never told him about seeing Ford.\n\n\nTodd made it clear that he forbade Starr from moving in with Cole because he was not prepared to lose another daughter. Starr halted him and demanded clarification, but a stuttering Todd found it difficult to cover and finally just blurted out, \"You can't leave.\" He voiced his loud objection to the idea of losing Starr and Hope, but Cole assured him that he wanted to keep his daughter close just as Todd wanted to.\n\n\nTodd told Starr that he wanted her to wait, and the pair began to bicker. She tried to explain that she had her own family and wanted to live with them. Todd felt that she wasn't ready, but Starr urged him to treat her like an adult as his gift to her for her upcoming eighteenth birthday.\n\n\nDanielle was thrilled beyond belief to see Ross appear at their house in Tahiti. Ross explained that he was still alive because he had washed up downstream and Todd had taken a poor shot at him. He was also lucky that the cops hadn't found him. He was vague in his accounting of how he had gotten himself back to the island. There was good news for Danielle as he told her about a new place he had found for the two of them, since they had a second chance to be together.\n\n\nT\u00e9a returned home with the groceries and shrieked when she saw Ross. She dropped her bag, and its contents spewed all over the floor. Shoving her daughter aside, she stood in front of Ross and vowed to kill him if he hurt Danielle. She told him to kill her instead. Ross tried to assure her that he wasn't there to hurt anyone but wanted to take Danielle with him. Danielle declared that she couldn't go with him because she would miss her mother too much.\n\n\nDanielle thought that the three of them could start over as a family, since she wanted to be with both parents. T\u00e9a reminded her daughter of all that had happened in Seattle and what Ross had done. She admitted that things were partially her fault because she had not done things correctly. Those were not the only reasons they could not be together, she said. Sadly, she told Danielle that the couple had not been happy together for a long time. Ross spoke up then and told Danielle that T\u00e9a was in love with someone else.\n\n\nT\u00e9a stated that she had chosen to be with Danielle. The teen disclosed that she had tried to kill Todd because she had thought that Todd had killed Ross, who shook his head sadly, certain that he was responsible and had driven Danielle to it. He berated himself for the father figure he had turned out to be. Danielle was confused, stating that he wasn't a figure but was her father. Tearfully, Ross described how he had always loved Danielle, would love her forever, and thought she was a part of him. T\u00e9a was also moved to tears.\n\n\nRoss urged Danielle to promise to \"stop hating Todd.\" Danielle was still puzzled as she expressed her love for Ross, who was her father. \"The thing is, I'm not your father,\" Ross announced. As Danielle looked at the man she knew as her father questioningly, T\u00e9a begged her to listen to Ross. \"Todd Manning is your father,\" he announced.\n\n\nMatthew and Bo shared lunch together in their Palace hotel room. Bo thought it was great that he no longer had to go to work and could spend time with his son. He chalked up Matthew's somber mood to girl trouble, and when Matthew noted that there was no girl to have trouble with, Bo hit the nail on the head. He realized that Matthew was thinking about Danielle. Matthew expressed his dismay that Bo was a cop and that his detective skills were always evident.\n\n\nMatthew confessed that he and Danielle had kissed, and Bo hid a smile. He informed his son that kissing a person would send feelings into \"high gear.\" Matthew was despondent that everything had changed after he and Danielle had kissed, but she wasn't going to be returning to Llanview. He was pretty upset that she was gone. \n\n\nBo acknowledged that he had felt the same when Nora had married Clint, which caused Matthew to apologize for his previous behavior. He understood and could relate. Bo assured Matthew that he would have another chance with Danielle if the relationship were real. He was certain that Danielle would be in touch.\n\n\n\"That son of a bitch,\" Nora exclaimed after she was served papers at the police station. At the same time, David Vickers ran into the station and headed for Bo's office; he announced that he wanted his father to arrest someone for him. He was taken aback when he walked in on Blair and Elijah, both in a state of undress. They hurriedly put on their clothes as they filled David in on the latest happenings in Llanview, along with the fact that Bo was no longer the police commissioner. They pointed out the new name on the office door. Blair informed David that all of Dorian's family members had moved out of La Boulaie.\n\n\nDavid was determined to locate Dorian to insist that she give Bo his job back. After he rushed out, Blair assured Elijah that while she was sleeping at Todd's house, she was not sleeping with him. Nora showed her papers to Elijah. \"It looks like you need a lawyer,\" he told her.\n\n\nA surprised Renee and Nigel learned that Kim was moving into the Buchanan mansion. Clint introduced the two women and left the group while he attended to another matter. \"No red carpet?\" Kim asked Renee about her welcome into the home. \"A red light is more like it,\" Renee shot back. \"What'd you say, old lady?\" Kim growled. The women had words, and Kim assured Renee that she would be in Clint's bed before too long. Since she had Clint's ear, Kim also planned on seeing to it that Renee was residing in the same nursing home as Nigel after Kim had him fired.\n\n\nClint returned and was happy about something he had set in motion. \"Right about now, steam should be coming out of Nora's ears,\" he noted. He wondered if he had walked in on something with the group appearing ill at ease, but Kim sweetly asked Nigel to carry her bags upstairs. She assured Clint that everything was fine.\n\n\nNora and her new attorney, Elijah, showed up at the mansion with the papers in hand. Nora was furious that Clint wanted her to give him money, and Elijah wanted to know how Clint had arrived at the sum of 42 million dollars. Explaining that he had totaled all of the money he had spent on her, Clint reminded her that she had also had an affair with his brother. He wondered what that was worth.\n\n\nContinuing, he stated that he had included the time he had lost at Buchanan Enterprises for emotional distress and the damage to his image. He pointed out that there had also been a loss in company stock after the scandal had emerged. Sarcastically, he advised them that he was willing to accept a payment plan but that the price was fair. Nora handed Clint her ring as her first payment. Abruptly, Elijah advised Clint that the mansion would be on the market by the weekend to enable Nora to collect the funds.\n\n\nAnnoyed, Clint insisted that Nora had given the mansion to him, but Nora waved the envelope that contained the papers. Elijah declared that Nora had never signed anything, so the house was still hers. She had no choice, so everyone would have to vacate the house. Kim asked if she could speak to Clint in private.\n\n\nMoving into the next room, Kim guaranteed her boss that there were other ways to get back at Nora. She hated to see him lose his house and memories. Returning to Nora and Elijah, Clint confirmed that his assistant had given him a new perspective on things. He agreed to drop the damages lawsuit for the house but wanted it in writing. \n\n\nNora expressed her dismay at Kim living in the mansion and advised Clint that she still cared about him. She didn't want to see him look like a fool. Clint noted that was Nora's \"area of expertise\" and yelled at her to get out of his house. Nora tore the envelope in two as she left.\n\n\nAs Bo and Matthew chatted, David arrived to see Bo. He was astonished when Matthew answered the door. \"You're all vertical,\" David proclaimed. He asked if his little brother was still with Destiny, but Matthew informed him that he had met someone else. Sullenly, he added that the girl had left town. David was excited for Matthew's turn of events but was sorry to hear about Bo's job. He announced that he had been looking for Dorian in order to force her to return Bo's job. He wanted to have Robert Ford arrested, he explained.\n\n\nSitting alone with Bo, David explained that Ford had stolen his name and his show, and had even recast David. Bo suggested that David needed a lawyer instead. Just then, Nora returned, and David quickly waved a contract in her face. He demanded to know how much prison time Ford would get, because David wanted justice. \n\n\nNora decided to share her own news about Clint and his \"gold-digging girlfriend\" instead. She was sure that Kimberly Andrews would go through all of Clint's money and would be his next wife. David perked up when he heard Kim's name and, while he claimed not to know her, his body language indicated otherwise. Suddenly, he had the need to leave right away. Bo shared Matthew's news with Nora.\n\n\nNora was annoyed at herself for not forcing Clint to move out of the house so that she and Matthew could return to it. She agreed that it was silly that she and Bo still had two separate hotel rooms out of respect for Clint. She noted that she and Bo hadn't made love yet, and he was well aware of it. Bo wanted to make a home with Nora and Matthew, and he proposed that they find a place for the three of them. Smiling, Nora said yes enthusiastically.\n\n\nBlair returned to Todd's place and walked into the argument between Todd and their daughter. Starr pleaded for Blair's help. Pulling Todd aside, Blair assured her former husband that letting go was difficult, but they needed to let Starr go. They would still be there for her if it didn't work out between Starr and Cole. \n\n\nBlair felt that Starr should make her own decisions, or they would lose her forever. She stressed that Starr wouldn't really be totally on her own, and even though they hated the idea, they had to let her go. Left alone with Cole, Starr was distressed. She didn't want everyone to be angry.\n\n\nTodd gave in, and he and Blair advised Cole and Starr of their decision. Todd told Starr that she would have to pay for all of her own expenses, and he expected her to be back within a week. Blair quickly hushed him. Cole emphasized that he would look after his family.\n\n\nTheir belongings packed, Starr and Hope were ready to leave with Cole. Todd strongly recommended that Cole take care of them, or Todd would kill the boy. Used to hearing the threat from Todd, Cole muttered his assent. A cheerful Starr kept up a stream of chatter, noting that she'd probably see her parents the next day. She was very happy and assured her dad that she would always be his \"one and only little girl.\" Blair and Todd stood sadly at the door as their daughter left.\n\n\nLangston enlightened Markko that \"all hell broke loose\" after Dorian made her announcement, so she'd never had the chance to tell him about Ford. She was angry to hear that Ford had criticized the film Markko had made for class. The talk returned to Langston's moving in, and Markko promised that they would have lots of alone time because Cole was never around. He was looking forward to having sex everywhere around the place -- when he was not in pain.\n\n\nKim asked Clint for permission to blast her music so she could dance. He advised her that it was her home, and she could do what she wanted. He praised her for helping him out and, as he left the room, reminded her that they still had work to do. Kim turned on the music and began to dance with her back to the door. Suddenly, the music stopped, and she turned around quickly. \"So you're Kimberly Andrews,\" David said accusingly. He added that he knew her and knew what she did.\n\n\nAs Elijah turned the key in the lock of his hotel room at the Palace, he was surprised to see Blair emerge from the elevator. She was upset about Starr moving out, but she didn't have talking in mind. Tugging on Elijah's tie, she pulled him away from his door.\n\n\nCole, Starr, and Hope arrived at the apartment Cole lived in with Markko and found clothes strewn all over the floor. As they pondered the dilemma, a partially clad Markko and Langston appeared from the bedroom. After Langston revealed that she was moving in, Starr related her own good news. She and Hope were moving in too.\n\n\nAs Matthew looked longingly at Danielle's picture on his phone, Todd stared at pictures of both of his daughters, holding them side by side. Suddenly hearing a strange noise, Todd got up to see what it was. \"What the hell you doing here?\" he asked.\n\n\n",
