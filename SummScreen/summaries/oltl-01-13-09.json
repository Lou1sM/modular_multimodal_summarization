    "soap_central": "\nThe Joy of Rex\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Rex sat Shane down for the dreaded \"talk.\" As Rex began haltingly, Shane cut him off: \"It's called sex, I get it. Can't we talk about drugs instead?\" When Rex asked his son exactly what he knew about sex, Shane got grossed out. Rex told Shane it was important he had all the facts, because he himself had not. He explained that his Aunt Corinne had raised him without educating him properly or showing him how to treat people, and as a result, he had made a lot of mistakes as a young man. Shane asked Rex point-blank if he had been a mistake, or an accident. \n\n\nRex allowed that Shane had been a \"surprise,\" something he'd never known he'd wanted. He told Shane he'd been young, selfish, and stupid when he was in high school, unaware of Gigi's true feelings for him or his own deep feelings for her. He warned Shane to not follow his bad example, and instead, save sex for love. Shane found their talk to be repetitious, as he no longer had a girlfriend. Rex, of course, was floored that Shane had had a girlfriend at all. \"We broke up because she was too immature,\" Shane deadpanned. He explained that the girl he'd \"dated\" had wanted to explore the taboo of kissing with tongues, which revolted Shane. Relieved, Rex told his son to come to him any time he was ready to kiss a girl-or boy-that way. \"Only if you promise you won't do it in the living room again,\" Shane chided. Rex said it was a deal, and father and son pounded fists. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Cole kept banging on Wes's door, calling to Marty. When she finally let him in, Cole begged her to come home to the Buchanans'. Marty told Cole the mansion wasn't her home and she couldn't go back there, surrounded by strangers. Nor could she move in to a new place with him, whom she didn't remember. Downcast, Marty urged Cole to stay with the Buchanans, where it was best for him with people that loved and understood him. She told him he needed taking care of, whereas she needed to be alone. \n\n\nCole attempted to comfort Marty, and told her she was being too hard on herself, that her memories would return in time. He reminded her that she had remembered some things, but Marty told him it wasn't enough, and the things she had done for him over the holidays, like the Lewis Carroll book, had been things she was expected to do, not things that came naturally. Marty told him he deserved more from her than going through the motions, and that no matter how much she desperately tried to reconnect to him, it wasn't working. \"I feel like a fraud,\" she muttered, despondent. \n\n\nCole promised Marty he would back off and give her some space, but Marty said he wasn't the problem; things just weren't working. She said she needed time and her own space to figure things out. Cole protested that running away from her friends and family was not the answer, and wasn't something she would do. Marty grew exasperated, resenting that everyone kept trying to tell her who she was or what she would do, just like the night before. Before Cole could get her to elaborate, Marty opened the door to usher him out. She told him she didn't like what she was doing to him, and hated to keep hurting him. Anguished, Marty told her son she was not the mother he'd loved or remembered, no matter how much she wanted to be. She told him the only way she could become that woman again was if she got herself back on her own terms first. Frustrated, Cole asked if he had to keep on waiting to hear from her. \"I'm sorry,\" Marty replied. Fed up, Cole stormed out and slammed the door, leaving Marty to take her anger out on the furniture. \n\n\nOutside Wes's apartment, Cole stood in the hall and unwrapped the bundle of pills he'd gotten from Asher. Pondering the drugs, he left the hotel. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi briefed her new boss, John, on the delivery schedules. John told Gigi not to worry about her own work shift and promised her he'd be flexible, knowing she had a child to raise. As John walked off, Gigi ran into Wes, who was reporting for work. Gigi asked when he'd started at Rodi's, and Wes said he'd been hired just before Christmas. He told Gigi he was staying in Llanview for the foreseeable future to support Brody during his recovery. \n\n\nAs Gigi and Wes began doing their rounds around the restaurant, Wes ran smack into John, who asked what he was doing there. Wes told John he'd been hired by the previous owner just before John bought the place. The subject inevitably turned to Marty, and John appealed to Wes's reason, explaining that Marty was a confused woman who had suffered a trauma and needed her friends and family around her. Wes told John that Marty was welcome to stay with him if she liked, and said she was tough and could handle herself. John countered that Marty was scared and putting up a front. Wes said that all he could do was deal with the Marty of the moment, and not the Marty who used to be, the one John only remembered. With that, he went back to work. \n\n\nGigi greeted Michael and Marcie, who had arrived to check up on John. Gigi bashfully explained to her friends that Shane was home with Rex, getting \"the talk\" as a result of his having walked in on something he shouldn't have. The McBains teased Gigi mercilessly about Shane having encountered her in flagrante delicto. \"John walked in on Mom and Dad, look how well he turned out!\" Michael snickered. The couple comforted Marcie, assuring her that Shane would be fine. \n\n\nAs they talked, Michael glimpsed John's argument with Wes. As soon as Wes left, Michael made a beeline for the bar to greet John and ask him what was going on with his employee. John told his brother to butt out, sending him back to Marcie and Gigi. When he turned around, he saw Wes preparing to leave, assuming John had fired him. John told Wes he wasn't fired, and that he knew Wes needed the job. Wes challenged John, aware that he was only being kept around to keep an eye on Marty. John told Wes to get back to work. \n\n\nShane and Rex arrived at Rodi's and sat down with Michael and Marcie. Rex assured Gigi that everything was good and their father-son chat had gone well. Shane nonchalantly told the McBains that they had talked about sex, and said he still had a few questions. Michael said that as a doctor, he could answer as many questions as Shane might have. \"Okay,\" Shane said blithely. \"What's a clitoris?\" Stunned, Marcie did a spit-take with her beer. \n\n\nTodd arrived at the cemetery, and stood over \"Hope's\" grave, lost in thought. As he began to address his \"dead\" granddaughter, Todd was unaware that Starr had walked into the cemetery behind him, and overheard his words. Growing emotional, Todd told Hope that he was sorry for what had happened to her, and took the blame for her death. \"I made it happen just by thinking it,\" he explained, by putting his plan together to fake her death. He said he knew Starr would never love him again. Todd chuckled that God wouldn't let him die, and he didn't want to live as he was, but he didn't know what to do next. He reminisced about holding the infant Starr for the first time, and how he hadn't wanted to initially, but when he had, he'd changed then and there. He'd realized then that there were people he could love unconditionally. Todd said he'd promised himself he would never hurt his children, but he had many times over. \"I lost my little Starr,\" Todd whispered to the grave, \"and I made her lose you, her Hope.\" \n\n\nTouched, Starr walked over to Todd, showing herself. She told him she'd heard everything. Todd said he knew Starr still hated him, but Starr replied that it wasn't so simple. \"It should be easy for me to hate you,\" she said tearfully, \"but you make it hard.\" She told her father that she hadn't only lost Hope in the last year, but him as well; the whole family had lost him. Starr told Todd he didn't realize how much he'd meant to all of them, how deeply his loss had been felt when he had abandoned the family for his schemes. \n\n\nTodd admitted he hadn't known how much his loved ones had cared, and asked Starr if they could be okay again if he stopped taking his children for granted. Starr replied that she didn't know, because she no longer knew who he was. \"You look like my Dad but you're not him,\" she said. \"I don't know where he went.\" Todd promised to find that man again, and be her father once more. He said even if she couldn't forgive him, he couldn't take back what he'd done, he could only move forward and try not to hurt people again. He thanked Starr for giving him a reason to go on. \"Someday, somehow, I'll be worthy of your love again.\" Todd walked out, leaving Starr with her thoughts. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Matthew played dumb when confronted by his parents with the joint in his backpack. Nora asked if the joint was Cole's. Matthew said no, and was outraged that they had rifled through his things. Bo took a hard line, reminding Matthew that everything he owned was their property, and pushed his son for the truth. Matthew gave him the classic \"I'm holding it for a friend\" routine, but Bo wasn't buying his story. Cornered, Matthew admitted the joint was his, but didn't see the problem. He said he'd never done pot, wasn't going to do it, and had only taken one to look cool at an upcoming party. Bo urged him not to give in to peer pressure so easily, and reminded Matthew of all the times he had told him to \"Just say no.\" \"Did you?\" Matthew shot back. \n\n\nBo assured his son that he had always abstained from drugs, while Nora began to quietly sweat bullets. When asked for her own experience, she grew evasive. Matthew challenged Bo on his drinking habits, reminding him that he went on a bender the previous summer, as well as when Asa had first died. Nora told Matthew that the difference was that alcohol was legal and that both she and Bo were adults who knew their limits. \n\n\nBo told Matthew that he'd never \"toked up,\" even during rough times in Vietnam; he said he'd seen what hard drugs had done to other servicemen, and that Asa would've killed him when he returned home. Matthew asked Nora about her past, and Nora finally acknowledged that she'd done pot, but only once she'd gotten to college. Matthew asked if that meant he should do drugs when he was older. Bo said drugs were unacceptable, period. \n\n\nMatthew lashed out at his father, and explained that he had a lot to be stressed out about that they didn't understand. He told Bo and Nora that he was the shortest kid in his class and had to rely on Cole for protection from bullies, while the other students who might use drugs thought he was a \"narc\" because of who his parents were. Matthew said he'd taken the joint to try to put the other kids at ease. Bo told Matthew that things were not as harmless as they seemed, and declared that they would all be sitting down with the school principal to discuss \"the drug problem\" at Llanview High, and the students involved. \"The hell I am!\" Matthew replied. \n\n\nCole returned to the mansion just in time to hear the arguing in the drawing room. He recoiled, stepping back outside, where he unwrapped his bundle of pills again. After considering it for a moment, Cole swallowed a pill, then reentered the house and snuck upstairs. \n\n\nBack in the drawing room, Bo was furious with Matthew's defiance, and ordered him to his room. Matthew stalked out, telling his parents that he hadn't planned to smoke the joint, but they'd made him want to. As he ran off, Nora and Bo regrouped. \"That went well,\" Nora mumbled. \n\n\nAt Wes's apartment, Marty got a phone call from Wes, who was checking up on her. Marty asked him if she could stay there a while longer to get her head together, and Wes reiterated that she could stay with him for as long as she needed. As he hung up, he found himself once again face-to-face with a disapproving John. \n\n\nAfter Michael and Marcie took Shane to the movies, Rex sidled up to Gigi at the bar and told her he'd done okay with \"the talk.\" Rex wondered if he was finally getting the hang of \"the Dad thing.\" \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Jessica paid a visit to Brody's room. Jessica asked how his essay about his traumatic experience for their group therapy session was going, and Brody told her he didn't see the point. Jessica said her own essay hadn't told her anything new about what her mind was going through, and suggested they each compare notes on the other's essay, to see if the other person picked up on something they hadn't. Jessica read first, describing her ordeals with Tess, and how she had come to encounter Bess: \"Why did Bess show up? Where did she come from, and what is she hiding? What can she do that I can't?\" \n\n\nAfter Jess finished, Brody began to read his essay, narrating his horrific war experiences in Basra. He spoke about the night he and his squad had assaulted a house that was reported to be full of insurgents. He said that when they'd breached the house, he had fired without thinking, and hit an innocent child. Suddenly, Brody froze up, and Jessica asked him what was wrong. \"He's here,\" Brody said, staring straight ahead at the dead child only he could see. \n\n\nJessica played intermediary between Brody and his hallucination, and asked Brody to tell her what the boy was doing. Shell shocked, Brody told Jess the boy never did anything but stand there. Jessica asked if he'd tried talking back to the boy. She urged him to try apologizing, and see if that made the boy speak. Brody told the Arab boy that he'd never meant to kill him, and hadn't known he wasn't an insurgent. He asked the boy if he kept appearing because he hated him. The boy shook his head. \"Then why?\" Brody asked. The boy spoke in Arabic, and Brody was stunned. He translated the words for Jessica: \"He says, 'I know.'\" Brody asked the boy what it was he knew, and the boy spoke again, then vanished. As Brody sat back, Jessica asked him what the boy's answer had been. Brody was shocked and confused: \"He said, 'It's a lie.'\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd goes to the gravesite of Starr's baby and privately confesses all he has done wrong and that he wants to be a better man. Unknown to him, Starr observes and overhears. And she indicates she might be willing to forgive him for his wrong-doings. Wes gets a job at Rodi's before finding out that John is the new owner. Marty tells Wes that she needs to live away from people who remember her and asks if she can stay at his home a while longer. He tells her yes.

Cole is then ready to take the pills the drug pusher gave him. Bo and Nora catch Matthew with a joint. But he doesn't want to answer to them. He realizes that they have both used and they need to realize that he can make good judgment with \"using\" in moderation just like they can. But they are very disappointed in their son. Rex and Gigi are attempting to explain to Shane that they are having sex and how he was conceived. Marcie and Michael attempt to \"help\" them. Jessica asks Brody what is behind the \"vision\" he has of the boy whom he shot. And she wants to help him process his situation.",
