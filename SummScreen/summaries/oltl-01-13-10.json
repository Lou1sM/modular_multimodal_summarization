Langston couldn't believe that Todd had agreed to Starr's plan, but Starr said he'd had no choice but to let \"his little girl\" go.  She admitted that she felt sorry for him and knew it had to be hard for a father to say goodbye to his daughter.  Langston was thrilled to have her friends for roommates, but Markko was struggling to garner enthusiasm for their new living arrangements.  The girls quickly pressed Markko and Cole into service to get the rest of Starr's luggage.\n\n\nAfter the new Manning-Thornhart clan was settled in, the reality of their new household crashed down on Langston and Markko when Hope's incessant cries interrupted their attempts to do schoolwork.  The lovebirds complained about their situation in hushed tones but found themselves scrambling for an explanation when Starr and Cole reentered the living room and asked what they had been talking about.\n\n\nAt Cristian, Layla, and Oliver's apartment, Cristian awoke and found Layla working on her laptop in the living room.  Cristian asked his ladylove why she wasn't at the police station, and Layla explained that she'd been asked not to go in. Because Lowell had fired Bo and John, her position was also in jeopardy.  Layla feared for her employment, but Cristian told her it would be okay and plied her with kisses to get her mind off her troubles.  Heading for the couch, the lovers began to make out.\n\n\nJust as Cristian and Layla were about to get horizontal, Oliver returned, averting his eyes.  As Layla related her job woes, Oliver cursed Lowell and admitted he also feared for his position because of his relationship with McBain.  A dark thought sprang to Layla's mind: \"We could lose this place.\"\n\n\nThere was a knock on the door. Cristian answered it and found Ford waiting, ready for their workout appointment.  As Cristian rushed to get changed, Layla introduced Ford to Oliver.  Just then, Ford got a call from the university, which had bad news for him as well: he'd lost his subsidized housing and no longer had a place to live.  Oliver said there was an apartment available in their building, but Ford explained that as a teacher's assistant, he couldn't afford to live on his own.\n\n\nSeized by inspiration, Oliver and Layla began a summit of whispers about Ford and their living situation. They wondered aloud if he could somehow be a fourth roommate.  Cristian arrived to join their caucus, and Oliver explained that he was always at Kyle's, and Layla and Cristian were bunking together, which left one bedroom empty -- plus, they could use the extra rent money.  Cristian considered the idea then turned to Ford and offered him the room.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, David and Kim sized each other up; David gave her his full family title of \"David Vickers Buchanan,\" but Kim said she'd never heard of him.  David explained that he'd heard of her, however, and wasted no time in dragging out all of Kim's old skeletons, specifically her past as an \"exotic dancer.\"  Kim said that the past was the past, her life was an open book, and she had no secrets, unless he needed a lap dance.  David strained to avoid the temptation and keep his mind on family business.\n\n\nDavid asked her if she was sure she had nothing to hide. \"Is the Pope German?\" Kim replied.  \"I don't know,\" David murmured, \"is he?\"  After getting lost in the tangle of his own musings about Pope Benedict's ethnicity, David ordered Kim not to change the subject and added, \"Remember, I'm smart!\"  He explained that Neville, \"Nigel's dentally challenged look-alike cousin,\" had told him all about Kim's scheme to destroy Clint's marriage.\n\n\nKim played innocent, leading David to probe further: \"So you didn't ply Neville with alcohol and promise him that lap dance that you assumed that I wanted, which I do if it's free, and I'll tip you?\"  Kim insisted she'd never heard of Neville, but David wasn't buying her line.  Kim turned the tables and accused David of not caring about Clint but only the family money.  David admitted that, like her, it was the Buchanan fortune he was interested in, but the question was which of them was \"the smarterest.\"  \"Game on,\" Kim replied.\n\n\nDavid slammed Kim for using Neville to do her dirty work and for taking advantage of Clint.  \"No one can take advantage of Clint Buchanan,\" Kim declared.  Regardless, David warned \"Princess Velvet Thighs\" that he would not allow her access to wealth that was rightfully his, and he said, \"This family isn't big enough for the both of us!\"\n\n\nAgain, Kim insisted she was only Clint's faithful assistant and asked David if he'd ever had to claw and scrape in a g-string and heels to get what he deserved. Not surprisingly, this led David to another meandering remembrance of his own sordid past in \"Berlin, '97.\"  Finding his way back to the topic at hand, David told Kim he knew she was using her position to worm her way into Clint's confidence -- and his bank account. She'd ruined Clint's marriage to get close to Clint, and David was going to tell Clint the truth.  \"Tell me what?\" Clint asked, entering the drawing room.\n\n\nKim was on the spot as David pressed her to tell Clint the truth, or he would.  Stumbling over her words, Kim admitted that she'd engineered the deception with Neville in order to out Bo and Nora to Clint but claimed she'd only done it to protect Clint's honor.  David scoffed at Kim's lies, and gleefully asked \"Uncle Clint\" if he was going to throw her out.  Kim offered to leave, but Clint told her that he didn't want her to leave; he wanted to shake her hand.  He thanked her for giving him the truth when no one else would. Far from firing her, he intended to give Kim a raise.\n\n\nDavid was stunned that Clint was siding with Kim over family, but Clint reminded him that, as Bo's son, David was \"nothing to me\" and told David to get out, showing him the door. Infuriated, David placed a call to Ford, who, still in conversation with Oliver, Layla, and Cristian, ignored it.  Turning back to the trio, Ford happily accepted their offer to move in. Outside the Buchanan mansion, however, David was still out in the cold and was angered by Ford shutting him out.  \"I will find you,\" David vowed.\n\n\nInside, Kim thanked Clint for his understanding, but Clint wasn't taken in by her phony altruism.  He told her she wasn't the first opportunist he'd met, and he knew she hadn't busted Bo and Nora for his benefit.  It was obvious to him that she wanted a \"sugar daddy,\" but \"if I'm gonna be the daddy, sooner or later, we're gonna have to talk about the sugar.\"  With that, Clint headed upstairs and left Kim to ponder the gravity of his words.\n\n\nRex returned home to the loft and Stacy after a grocery run and was pleased to learn that Kim had moved out.  Stacy gushed that it would only be \"the three of us\" from then on; her, Rex, and their baby, but Rex included Shane in the equation instead.  Stacy managed to feign interest in spending time with Shane and thanked Rex for his support.\n\n\nJessica arrived to meet with Rex, who had news for his newfound sister.  He recounted Mitch's attempt to abduct Stacy, who explained that Mitch was obsessed with his latest grandchild, the \"chosen heir.\"  Jessica was shocked that Mitch had made open advances on Stacy and the baby, while Stacy feared for her life. Stacy knew that she was just \"the vessel,\" and without the baby, her life wouldn't be worth anything to Mitch.  Jessica asked about Shane and Bree, but Rex said they were safe.  Stacy explained that Mitch wanted a child who was \"unspoiled\" and new to the world to mold in his image.\n\n\nChanging the subject, Jessica asked Stacy when she was due.  Stacy flashed back to her conversation with Kim and lied that she would be expecting on Valentine's Day, instead of a month later.  Jessica told her she was lucky to be \"carrying small.\"  Touched by Jessica's concern, Stacy said she hoped they could become friends, but Jessica reminded her that she was well aware of what the young woman had done to Gigi and Shane.  Rex stepped in to defend Stacy and said that they'd moved beyond her actions in the past year.\n\n\nStacy claimed to be heading for the bathroom, while Rex and Jessica began a private conversation about the mother of his second child.  Stacy eavesdropped as Jessica reminded Rex of everything Stacy had done to his family, a family Rex said no longer existed.  He told her that Gigi had left him for Schuyler, but Jessica was convinced that Rex, Gigi, and Shane would still be together if not for Stacy's machinations.  Rex remained unconvinced.\n\n\nJessica told Rex that if he really wanted to protect Stacy from Mitch, there were cops on the force who moonlighted as bodyguards; she suggested he look into available officers.  Offering another piece of sisterly advice, she told him to watch out for Stacy, but Rex insisted that pregnancy had changed the lesser Ms. Morasco.  Stacy beamed as she heard Rex proclaim that she'd be a good mother.\n\n\nAt Todd's place, Todd stared mournfully at photos of Starr and Danielle, but Mitch interrupted his reverie.  Todd wasn't thrilled to see his old nemesis, who feigned sadness. \"Is that any way to greet an old friend?\" Mitch asked.  Mitch and Todd traded barbs as Mitch told Todd that he owed him -- Todd had killed his brother, Walker, and stolen his identity, then used his family against him.  \"To protect mine,\" Todd countered, and Mitch reasoned that he could understand that.  Mitch explained that he was still all about family and was anxious to claim his heirs, but Rex and Jessica refused to accept him, though they needed his love, much like Starr needed Todd's...Starr and Danielle, he added, noticing Danielle's picture.\n\n\nTodd attempted to shut Mitch out, but Mitch continued to work on him. Mitch needled Todd about Starr and Cole moving in together; like Mitch, Todd had once again been abandoned by his family.  He reminded Todd of the last time that had happened, and how it had led to Todd's \"romance\" with Marty, his two-time rape victim.  After everything that had occurred, Todd had lost his daughter to the bed of his victim's son.  Mitch said he could get Starr back for Todd and suggested that if Cole suffered another \"accident,\" a fatal one, Starr would rush to her father's open arms.\n\n\nTodd was repulsed by Mitch's proposition and told him to get out.  Mitch asked if his reasoning was so far removed from Todd's when he'd attempted to steal Hope from Starr and Cole in order to raise her with Marty.  Todd pleaded \"temporary insanity,\" but Mitch called his plan brilliant; he'd only wanted to protect his bloodline, and Hope was his second chance, much like Rex and Stacy's child was Mitch's.  Mitch said that they could help each other: Todd would convince Jessica and Rex to have contact with Mitch, and Mitch would take care of Todd's problem with Cole and Starr.\n\n\nTodd refused to be a part of Mitch's scheme, and said Mitch would never know his latest grandchild.  Mitch said that his grandson was his heir, and he wouldn't leave Llanview without the child.  Todd blew Mitch off, ordered him to leave, and asked him not to return.  As Todd closed the door in his face, Mitch said he was sorry Todd had refused him.  Walking away, Mitch murmured that Todd would regret that decision.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Danielle was horrified as Ross told her that Todd was her biological father.  Ross said he wished he was, but he wasn't.  Shell-shocked, Danielle listened as T\u00e9a laid out the story of her dalliance with Todd in the South Pacific and how she'd rebounded with Ross and believed that he was her child's father, until the paternity test.  Danielle was convinced T\u00e9a was lying to separate her from Ross, but T\u00e9a proved her wrong by handing over the DNA test.\n\n\nDanielle refused to accept the evidence; \"You're my father!\" she cried, wrapping her arms around Ross.  She vowed that Todd would never be her father and turned on T\u00e9a for deceiving them.  Weeping, T\u00e9a insisted that she'd thought Danielle was Ross's daughter for years and had put her one night with Todd out of her mind -- until her return to Llanview.  She'd loved Todd, but he'd wanted to be with Blair, and she hadn't wanted Danielle to be Todd's; she'd loved Ross for a long time, and the situation was no one's fault, not Ross or Todd's.  Ross added that Todd had saved Danielle's life in Seattle, and Danielle was shocked to realize that Todd already knew he was her father.\n\n\nDanielle asked why Todd hadn't said anything to her if he'd known, and T\u00e9a explained that they'd wanted to give her time to grieve for Ross.  Danielle replied that Ross was alive, so there was no need to grieve; they could be a family again, if only T\u00e9a would try.  Ross said that wasn't possible, as T\u00e9a loved Todd, and Danielle needed to get to know her real father.  Ross had gotten to raise her and hold her in his arms, but Todd deserved to know her and discover what a wonderful young woman she was.\n\n\nDanielle asked what would become of Ross, and T\u00e9a explained that no one was looking for him; the authorities thought him dead, and he could stay that way and continue to live in Tahiti, on one condition: if Danielle returned to Llanview with T\u00e9a, and got to know Todd.  Ross told Danielle to go, but she didn't want to leave him behind.  Ross told her to forget about him, or T\u00e9a or Todd, because she needed to go back for herself, to know who she was.  Danielle said she already knew: \"I'm Dani Rayburn, Ross Rayburn's daughter.\"\n\n\nDanielle hugged Ross, who held her tightly.  She told him she loved him and promised to return.  \"I'll be waiting,\" Ross replied, fighting back tears, while T\u00e9a watched with sorrow. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ross tells Dani that Todd is her biological father. He tells her she should go back to Llanview and get to know Todd. Dani says Todd will never be her father and that he creeps her out. T\u00e9a tells Dani that she won't report to the authorities that Ross is alive if Dani comes back to Llanview to get to know Todd. Ross tells Dani he will be at their house in Tahiti and she can come back whenever she wants. Starr and Langston move in with Cole and Markko. Mitch Laurence goes to Todd's house and tells Todd that he knows what it is like to lose his children. He comments on Todd losing T\u00e9a and Dani and now Starr moving out. He offers to arrange for Cole to have another accident so that Starr will turn to Todd, but Todd warns Mitch not to touch Cole. Mitch says Todd owes him because Todd killed his brother, Walker and had plastic surgery to look like him. He wants Todd to help him get Rex's child because he is not leaving Llanview without the chosen child. Todd refuses. Rex moves back into the loft with Stacy. Rex and Stacy tell Jessica about Mitch wanting to take their baby and mold it from birth as his heir. Jessica tells Rex that some of the cops on the Llanview PD moonlight as security guards. She warns him to watch out for Stacy. Layla tells Cris and Fish that she was told not to report to work until further notice. Ford is informed that he will not get graduate student housing at the university. Layla, Cris, and Fish discuss how Cris sleeps in Layla's room and Fish usually sleeps at Kyle's place. They decide to invite Ford to move into their apartment with them. David Vickers vows to find Ford. David goes to the Buchanan mansion and confronts Kim about being a gold- digger. He tells her that he will not let her sleep her way through his fortune. He tells her to get out of Clint's life or he will be forced to tell him the truth about how she manipulated Neville to set into motion the events that led to Clint finding out about Nora and Bo. Clint overhears the end of the conversation so Kim admits it and says he only did it to prevent Clint from being embarrassed by finding out another way. Clint thanks Kim and tells David that Bo is no longer his brother therefore David is no longer his nephew. David leaves. Clint tells Kim that it is obvious that she is looking for a sugar daddy and that they will eventually have to talk about the sugar.",
