Nora wants privacy and closes the door; she tells Clint she wants to pick up where they left off.  The two share a passionate kiss.  They both realize that Bo should be made aware of their new found relationship.  When Nora suggests that they also make Lindsay aware, Clint questions why.

Holding the child, Tommy looks back at Marcie and then turns away.  Todd tells his confused son, \"its okay Sam.  You're with daddy now.\"  Todd tells Blair he never wants Marcie anywhere near Sam again.  Blair tells Todd that will not be a problem because it appears Marcie has lost everything.  Devastated, Marcie sits in the back of the squad car starring as Todd holds his son.
