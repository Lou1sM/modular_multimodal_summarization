Blair didn't need to volunteer details. Roxy figured out that they had been arguing about Marty. Blair tried to minimize the incident, but Roxy didn't buy it. She pointed out that John had obviously chosen Blair over Marty, since Blair was still in John's apartment. \n\n\nAt the gym, Antonio tried to talk to Cris about Cris's situation with Vanessa. Cris seemed defensive. He reminded Antonio that he was helping Vanessa because her life was in peril. Antonio kept his private thoughts on the matter to himself and focused on his brother's relationship with Vanessa. Cris admitted that he did have feelings for Vanessa, and told Antonio about the sacrifices that she had made to protect Lola from Ray. When Antonio asked Cris if his marriage to Vanessa was the real thing, Cris answered that it was. \n\n\nAt the loft, Vanessa told Lola about Sarah's decision to leave Llanview. Lola couldn't help but wonder if Vanessa had something to do with it. Vanessa was taken aback and asked how Lola could think such an unkind thing about her. Hurt turned to suspicion when Vanessa asked if T\u00e9a had put the idea in Lola's head. Lola denied it. She told Vanessa that she had seen the way that Cris and Vanessa looked at each other when they thought no one was watching. Vanessa dismissed the idea of Cris being interested in her and insisted that he was only helping her through a difficult situation. Vanessa contended that the only reason she was happy with Sarah's decision to leave town was because it made it easier to convince the authorities that her marriage to Cris was real. \n\n\nThe conversation then shifted to Lola and her desire to remember more of her past. Vanessa was taken aback when Lola suggested that she talk to someone about what had happened the night that Ray had killed her mother. Vanessa appeared hurt and asked Lola why she felt she needed to confide to someone else when she had Vanessa to talk to. Her hurt quickly turned to anger and suspicion when she accused T\u00e9a of manipulating Lola. Lola was adamant that T\u00e9a had merely tried to help her. Vanessa quickly backed down and once again offered to talk things through with Lola. Lola declined the offer and said that Vanessa made Lola feel as if she wanted Lola to forget the past. Vanessa admitted that she wanted Lola to put the past behind her. She said that they needed to move forward with their lives. However, Vanessa made it clear that she would listen if that were what Lola needed. Lola decided to leave rather than take Vanessa up on her offer. She reminded Vanessa of her sleepover at Langston's, then left. \n\n\nCris arrived home a short time later to find Vanessa waiting for him with a home-cooked meal and a bottle of wine. Vanessa told Cris that she wanted to talk about Sarah's decision to leave Llanview. Vanessa was surprised when Cris made it clear that he didn't want to discuss Sarah. Her surprise turned to joy when Cris admitted that he had feelings for Vanessa and that Sarah had realized it before Cris had. As Vanessa moved to kiss Cris, he stopped her long enough to ask where Lola was. With a suggestive smile, Vanessa informed him that Lola had gone to Langston's for the night. Cris and Vanessa began kissing and then made love. \n\n\nAt the diner, T\u00e9a was on the phone with Ray when Langston walked in holding a letter that Ray had mailed to his niece. While T\u00e9a told Ray what was unfolding in the diner, Langston asked Markko if she should read the letter. Markko thought that it was a bad idea. Langston reminded Markko that Ray and Lola were her only family. She felt she needed to read what Ray had written. With her decision made, Langston opened the letter and translated it to Markko. In the letter, Ray apologized for hurting Langston and asked for her forgiveness. Markko scoffed at the idea. Langston ignored him and continued to read the letter, which included a request that Langston give Lola an enclosed note and photograph. \n\n\nMeanwhile, on the phone, Ray told T\u00e9a that he had meant every word he had written to Langston. T\u00e9a suggested that the next step would be for her to work on his image so that the girls had a different view of Ray. Ray became upset. He told T\u00e9a that Vanessa was the monster, not him. T\u00e9a didn't disagree. She reassured Ray that she would find a way to prove that Vanessa had set him up. \n\n\nMoments later, Lola walked into the diner. She asked Markko if he would be joining them at La Boulaie. Langston and Markko laughed and told her that their parents would have a fit if he were near them during the sleepover. While T\u00e9a watched and kept Ray up to speed on what was transpiring in the diner, Langston handed Lola the note and picture from Ray. Lola read the letter out loud. In the letter to Lola, Ray warned his daughter that Vanessa was not to be trusted. He urged Lola to find someone she felt comfortable enough with that she could confide in. \n\n\nT\u00e9a decided it was the perfect opportunity to make her move. She promised to be in touch with Ray soon and disconnected the call before she walked up to Lola. T\u00e9a apologized for upsetting Lola the other day when she had asked her uncomfortable questions, and then handed Lola a business card with her phone number on it. T\u00e9a asked Lola to call her any time she felt she needed someone to talk to. As T\u00e9a began to leave, Lola blurted out that Ray had written her and professed his innocence. T\u00e9a looked at Lola with compassion and suggested that Lola call her soon. \n\n\nGigi joined Rex at a table in Rodi's to congratulate him on his first successful sex talk with Shane. Rex was surprised at her reference to \"the first.\" Gigi explained that there would be similar talks for Rex and Shane in the future. Rex was uncomfortable with the idea. As they were talking, Talia walked in. They chatted for a few minutes before Gigi resumed her shift and Talia stepped away to speak with John. Moments later, Bo walked in. He swept up a glass of beer from Rex's table and took a long drink. Rex could sense that Bo was troubled and asked him about it. Bo told him that they had discovered a joint in Matthew's backpack, then he polished off the beer and asked for another. \n\n\nBo sat down and filled Rex in on what had happened after Nora found the joint. Rex tried to downplay the incident by pointing out that the joint had not been smoked and that, to Bo's knowledge, Matthew had never been high around his father. Rex suggested that Matthew had momentarily succumbed to peer pressure. Bo remained agitated. He was disappointed with Matthew's attitude when he had been confronted. Bo told Rex that Matthew had initially tried to claim that the joint had belonged to Cole. When that had failed, Matthew said that he had been holding it for a friend. Later, Matthew admitted that he had bought it. Matthew's cavalier attitude about the illegal substance bothered Bo. Rex understood, but played devil's advocate by suggesting that Bo drank alcohol, which was a drug. Bo reminded Rex that alcohol was legal and that he was of legal age to drink it. Rex warned Bo to proceed with caution. He said that one joint did not make Matthew a pothead. \n\n\nWes was on the pay phone at Rodi's with Marty. He invited her to stay at his place for as long as she needed. When he hung up, John suggested that Wes work more and chat less. Wes said nothing and returned to his shift. When Talia approached John, he explained his comment to Wes by telling her that Wes was the guy that Marty had \"shacked up\" with. \n\n\nWhile they worked, Gigi talked to Wes about Brody. Wes was worried about Brody's recovery. He hoped his friend would make progress soon. Wes told Gigi a little about what it was like in Iraq, and said that she had no idea how difficult things had been for them. According to Wes, Brody was one of the good guys and would have taken a bullet for any one of the men that he had served with. Gigi admitted that she had regrets, and believed that Brody had a good heart. She suggested that perhaps that was why the incident with the boy had broken Brody. Wes vowed that he would not let Brody down. He intended to see Brody through his recovery. \n\n\nWhen Antonio sat down with Talia, in a booth at Rodi's, they talked about Cris and Sarah. Talia was surprised that Cris was willing to give up Sarah for someone he barely knew. \n\n\nLater, Blair joined John at Rodi's. When she stepped away for a moment, Blair overheard Antonio and Talia talking. Antonio noticed that John was in a foul mood, and asked Talia if she knew why. Talia responded that John was upset because Marty was staying with Wes. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Jessica tried to help Brody make sense of his vision of the boy he had killed in Iraq. Brody told her that the boy had said, \"It's a lie.\" Brody didn't understand the message. Jessica suggested that the boy, Brody's subconscious, was letting him know that it was time for Brody to remember what had really happened. Jessica advised Brody to go carefully over what had happened the night that the boy had been shot. When Brody sat down and started going over the events in his mind, he realized that the boy had not been holding a gun. \n\n\nBrody became distraught over the idea because it didn't make sense with what he knew to be true. He told Jessica that they had found a gun and it had been turned over to the proper authorities. Afterwards, an investigation had been launched, which verified that there had been a gun in the boy's hand. Jessica asked what if that had not been true. Brody quickly dismissed the possibility. He said that it didn't make any sense. Just then Jessica heard Tess tell her that it was a lie. Brody sensed that Jessica was momentarily distracted and asked her if she was okay. Jessica brushed off his concerns and focused on Brody. They were interrupted when a nun stepped into the room to remind Brody that it was time for his medication. \n\n\nWhile Brody left the room to take his pills, Jessica had a vision of Tess holding Chloe and telling Jessica, \"It's a lie.\" The incident rattled Jessica. When Brody returned, he realized that Jessica was upset, and asked her what had happened. Jessica told him about the vision. She believed that she needed to return to the cabin to see if she could figure out what Tess was trying to tell her.\n\n\n",
