She sympathizes with him because the house doesn't feel like home to her either. She assures him he'll be okay, but says she's signed him up for a group therapy session. He is angry when she suggests that his mom would have wanted him to go and he is against the idea. He's not sleeping, unpacking, or talking.  She explains that she'd like him to attend at least one session. He agrees to go.\n\n\nDorian starts the morning by trying to improve Langston's choice of clothing, and makes some adjustments in front of the mirror to tone her down. She confesses to Langston that she despises Todd, but loves his family, so she's willing to sacrifice.  \"Keep your enemies closer,\" she explains. The story in Paris, Texas, is on The Sun's front page. Upstairs, Addie comes on to Charlie in bed, wearing nothing under the kimono that she pulls open. Charlie manages to get away to report the intruder in the house. Addie admits it was an accident that she landed in his room, but not that she pulled her robe open. She continues to flirt with him as Dorian tries to keep the newspaper hidden from him. Langston learns that child services insists she attend a group therapy session, and she is not happy until Cole arrives, looking for Starr (who is out of the house early). They learn the counselor is expecting both of them, and decide maybe it won't be so bad. They agree to meet up at the diner for breakfast first. Charlie has plans to meet Jared for lunch but Dorian comes up with an idea to keep him busy. She wants to make a bid on some land on Llantano Mountain and would like Charlie to accompany her-she could use his contracting skills to build a cabin. He is suspicious and tries to get out of it, but Dorian won't take no for an answer. Addie is dressed in her swimming gear to take a plunge with the Polar Bear Club.\n\n\nSarah fills Cris in on the Texas scene as he helps out at the diner. He was busy all night and had no idea of what was going on. She's feeling sad that everyone leans on Viki and something might have happened to her. She tried to reach her mom as well, but Tina was nowhere to be found. Cris wants to reschedule a date but Sarah can't pick a new time immediately. As if by magic, Markko arrives, short on cash and hungry. Cris gives him some chores to last an hour so that he can spend time with Sarah. Cris will make arrangements to pay Markko later. Sarah says she wants a proper date, but is satisfied to spend some time with Cris, especially when he refers to her as \"my girl\" and kisses her. Langston and Cole sit at the counter and Langston mentions that Markko is not to know anything. They're surprised when he appears and, having heard, asks them what's going on. They have to tell him about the group therapy. Langston has Dorian's plastic and says he doesn't need to work. Markko informs her that he has to pay for her Valentine's Day gift. \n\n\nAntonio feels sorry for Todd, because he can relate to his child being taken from him. He flirts with Talia and when Bo arrives, she tells him she's changed her mind about transferring to Cherryvale. Bo reminds Talia of the reasons she wanted to leave. Talia and Antonio awkwardly tell Bo that they've worked things out. Bo says he's sorry, but it's all out of his hands now. He tells her that not only is Cherryvale short-handed, but he's hired someone new. As if on cue, Oliver Fish arrives ready to report for duty. Oliver's geeky and bubbly, used to merely tracking criminals in his video games but says he's ready to get the bad guys for real. Antonio promises Talia that he'll work on Bo, but she wants to protect Bo's reputation as well as her own. She'll report as promised to Cherryvale and they will have to live with it. She turns down his offer to loan her money. \"Call me,\" she says, departing. \n\n\nIt's Lindsay's day in court. She says she's still shocked that Bo and R.J. are fighting over her. R.J. says she won't find herself if she stays with Bo. She, too, would love to stay with R.J., but it's not up to her. Nora arrives as R.J. asks Lindsay if it would be a problem if she lived with Bo. Nora seems to think it's more likely that now Lindsay's getting what she wants. Lindsay apologizes to Nora for everything but admits it will never be enough. Nora says it would be enough if she thought that Lindsay was really sincere. The judge announces that due to R.J.'s record, she's chosen Bo as Lindsay's legal guardian. R.J. is very gracious to Bo, who is grinning from ear to ear. As Nora leaves, she warns Lindsay that she'll be keeping an eye on her. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sarah comes to visit Cristian at the Angel Square diner. She apologizes to him for breaking their date the night before. Sarah lets him know about what had been going on with Viki. Talia and Antonio come into work. They share some intimate moments. Bo comes into work and Talia lets him know that she had changed her mind about transferring to Cherry Vale. Bo lets her know that it is out of his hands and she is to report to work in Cherry Vale. Nora knocks on Cole's door and doesn't get an answer. She opens the door and goes on and falls flat of her face over something on the floor. Langston comes downstairs in a very provocative outfit, but when Dorian sees her, Dorian makes the necessary changes to her outfit. Cole comes to visit Langston. Addie awakens Charlie from a sound sleep so he can teach her out to ride. Dorian is completely beside herself when she finds out everything that Addie had done in Charlie's bed. Nora, Bo, and R.J. all appear in court for Lindsay's custody hearing. The judge awards custody of Lindsay to Bo.",
