    "soap_central": "\n Sex, Drugs and David's Soul \n\n\nJessica said goodbye to Brody, explaining that she had taken his advice and was heading to her cottage to try to remember the night of Chloe's birth. She was worried that Tess would return and stay for a long period, like she did in the past. Brody admitted that he hadn't seen the boy since the two had shared their journals. He sadly told her that she had to come back. Jessica promised to do her best. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Marty met with Wes and advised him that she would be out of his hair soon. Wes was happy to know that it would get John off his back, as he explained that John was his new boss. Their conversation was cut short when Wes received a call from Brody, imploring that he stop by to see him at St. Anne's. Getting up to leave, he left his phone number for Marty. Natalie and Jared were at a table close by, discussing their attempts at getting David out of town before he learned of his fortune. Overhearing his name, a nearby David made his way to the couple's table. Caught like deer in headlights, the pair breathed sighs of relief when David declared that he wasn't interested in what they had to say about him. He only wanted to pray over baby Chloe. \n\n\nDavid carried out his chant, with Natalie and Jared wondering if he was faking, while Noelle was impressed with his praying. Jared told Natalie that it was only a matter of time before Beaver Calhoun followed leads back to Llanview and David. Jared was determined to find a way to get David out of town before that happened. \n\n\nSummoned to La Boulaie, Madame Delphina advised Dorian that she knew of Dorian's attempts to get Charlie drunk and the events that followed. Dorian was more concerned with whether Viki was still on the warpath after those events. The psychic assured her that Viki had other things on her mind. Delphina made it clear that she was aware of Dorian's search for David Vickers and that she needed to locate him before he learned of his true identity. Seemingly having a conversation with someone above her, Delphina divulged that David was \"very far away and close.\" She also told a flustered Dorian that she was aware of Dorian's need to have the \"last laugh on Clint Buchanan.\" \n\n\nChowing down, Delphina came up for air, advising Dorian that David was \"here and not here.\" She confirmed that he was in Llanview physically, but on another plane spiritually. She reassured Dorian that David was still unaware of his new family ties. She advised her that Beaver Calhoun was searching for David and would be on his way to Llanview. Dorian made it known that she was planning on taking David to bed and then the altar, causing guffaws to emanate from the psychic. They were interrupted by none other than David, walking through the door. \"What happened to your clothes?\" asked a baffled Dorian. \n\n\nHearing of David's vow of poverty caused Dorian to chuckle. He explained that he had a \"clear conscience and an unsullied soul.\" Dorian summoned Moe, requesting that he bring them caviar and champagne. Delphina assured Dorian that her plan wouldn't work and that David had found something greater than himself and money. She quickly asked Dorian for her one thousand dollars in payment. Dorian refuted Delphina, pointing out that David only cared about money. He was not there to seek approval, David announced. He wanted forgiveness because he had merely married Addie to get back at Dorian, after she cut him out of their deal. He pointed out that karma had caused her to lose the company. \n\n\nTrying to break down David's defenses with the champagne and caviar, Dorian told Moe to leave for the day, promising him a month's bonus. As soon as Moe left, Dorian was all over David, kissing him and touching him, as he tried to resist. He admitted to a happy Dorian that he and Addie had never had sex, but had acted as though they had to drive Dorian crazy. \n\n\nViki informed Nora that Jessica would be heading back to the cottage accompanied by her parents and the doctor. She was hopeful that Tess would not return, but they needed to discover what had happened when the baby was born. Cole learned that Bo was driving Matthew to school, and that Nora had found a joint in Matthew's book bag. Cole offered to speak to Matthew himself, though he emphasized that the boy was a good kid. Nora wondered if Cole would be able to tell her who had sold Matthew the drug, but Cole firmly voiced his lack of knowledge. He enlightened Nora to the fact that he had found Marty in the Angel Square Hotel, staying with an unknown man. She had told him she couldn't live with her son. Nora wondered if she had said it was Cole's fault and exclaimed that Cole needed his mother. Momentarily, Cole flashed back to taking one of the pills he had purchased at school. In the midst of their conversation, Marty returned to the mansion. \n\n\nPreferring not to speak to his mother, Cole quickly departed. Nora urged Marty to go after him, but Marty held back, even after Nora told her to try. An angered Nora complained that Cole deserved more than a mother who disappeared and shacked up with a stranger. Marty took offense at that, but Nora tried to clarify that she didn't want anyone taking advantage of Marty. She thought that Marty was exhibiting destructive behavior and needed a therapist. Marty snickered at that, reminding Nora that Marty herself was a therapist. The women argued over Marty's choices, including her drinking when she suffered from lupus. Nora didn't fail to mention that Marty had been on the route of self-destruction once before, when she was younger. \n\n\nArriving at class early, Starr encountered Schuyler Joplin and explained her reasons for not doing her homework. She admitted to visiting her baby's grave and then spending the night thinking about her. She supposed that he spent his time thinking about his mother, she added. Schuyler spoke out quickly, admitting that he didn't get to say goodbye to his mom. Attempting to end the conversation, he mentioned the Code of Ethics, stating that he didn't think it right to be talking to her. Starr countered with the fact that they were only talking and Schuyler opened up. He admitted that he had been \"pretty messed up, on drugs or something\" when he was younger. He added that his mother had covered up for him often. He wondered if her death was related to him in some way, having heard that she had something on her mind before she died. He thought it possible that perhaps she had made a mistake because of him. \n\n\nStarr quickly reassured her teacher that he could not have been responsible for what happened. He went on to talk about his mom and how he broke her heart. He even bought her new earrings to replace the pair he had stolen from her years before, but he had never gotten the chance to give them to her, he confided. He again brought up the boundaries between student and teacher. \n\n\nArriving at school, Cole stopped to see the student who had sold him drugs previously. Grabbing him, he berated the boy for selling the joint to Matthew. The boy denied it, wondering if Cole was Matthew's brother. Cole demanded to know who the seller was. The boy insisted that there was someone else selling drugs to the younger set. \n\n\nSchuyler mentioned that he had an appointment with a lawyer and Starr realized that it was probably T\u00e9a. He thought that his mother was being investigated, but Starr filled her teacher in on Todd's plot and T\u00e9a's defense of her dad. Schuyler promised to help Starr in any way that he could, though he knew nothing of his mother's involvement with Todd. A thankful Starr gave her teacher a hug as Cole walked in on them. He demanded that they separate, pointing out that Joplin's mother was the reason their baby was dead. Starr attempted to calm him down. \n\n\nBrody told Wes about seeing the dead boy from Iraq and that the boy had told him, \"It's a lie.\" He questioned Wes about the lack of a gun and if the boy was really unarmed. Wes reminded him that their entire company had testified on the existence of a gun and that everyone had seen it. He urged Brody to put the incident behind him and to move on. \n\n\nJessica arrived at the cottage, and, breathing heavily, recalled being there with Nash. She remembered her parents being present after the baby's birth, but could not summon up any images of the time in between those two memories. Suddenly, sobbing, she pictured Tess in the throes of labor. She wondered what had caused Tess to leave and Jessica to return. Unexpectedly, Tess resurfaced, with the memory of her baby not crying. Turning to Viki, she pleaded for help in remembering everything that happened the night of Chloe's birth. \n\n\nWes stopped at the Buchanan mansion to pick up Marty after she put in a frantic call to him. Nora tried to stop her from going off with him, to no avail. \n\n\nBrody began to see the boy again but this time the views differed from each other. First he had a gun, and then he didn't.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr's new teacher (Dr. Joplin's son) admits to her that his mother got really \"messed up\" by bailing him out of his messes such as drug addiction. And that could have contributed to why Starr's baby died. She finds out that Tea has been contacting him in order to build Todd's case. Cole starts taking pills after his mother admits to him that she needs to stay away from him since she remembers nothing. Marty admits to Cole and to Nora that she'd rather spend time with Wes and live with him than be around them. Brody talks to Jessica about her upcoming meeting with her parents and doctor. She goes with them to the place where she (as Tess) gave birth. And she admits that Tess realized the baby was not crying. It's too painful for her to know what really happened. And she turns into Tess again. David Vickers comes to visit Dorian. She does not believe that he has \"changed\" and tries to seduce him and serve him caviar and expensive champagne. Natalie and Jared want to make certain that David never finds out that he inherits all of Asa's fortune. But Dorian has another plan where she marries him and lets him find out about his inheritance so that she can take it from Clint.",
