Upon realizing that John had abducted her, Dorian ordered him to release her immediately.  John agreed to release Dorian once she admitted that Mitch Laurence had blackmailed her into hiring Lowell as the new police commissioner.  \n\n\nInsisting that she hadn't committed any transgressions, Dorian exclaimed, \"There's nothing that Mitch could use against me!\"  With a knowing look, John responded, \"Your girls!\"  Dorian's jaw dropped.\n\n\nAdvising Dorian to fire Lowell and to reinstate Bo, John assured her that Mitch would be prosecuted, but Dorian refused to reverse her decision.  John suggested that Dorian step down as mayor and allow Viki to assume her duties.  In a fit of rage, Dorian inadvertently admitted that Mitch had threatened her girls.   Hoping to appeal to Dorian's sense of decency, Brody related Mitch's attempt to kidnap Stacy and steal her unborn child.  After receiving little emotion from her, Brody warned Dorian that Lowell might revert to his old ways and attempt to harm Starr and Hope again.\n\n\nAlthough moved by Brody's plea, a frustrated Dorian declared, \"Nothing is going to stop Mitch until he's dead.  Are you going to kill him, John?\"  After releasing her, John warned, \"Mitch has already committed one murder, are you going to be responsible for the next?\"\n\n\nInside Ford's new apartment, Markko flew into a rage after discovering Langston sitting beside a shirtless Ford.   With David by his side, Markko questioned Ford's motives and demanded to know why Langston was there.  While Markko argued that Ford had his sights set on Langston, David informed the director that David was suing him for copyright infringement.  David was humiliated by Ford's decision to recast him with a nerdy-looking actor in Ford's Internet film.\n\n\nPulling Markko aside, Langston criticized him for his constant jealousy toward Ford.   An irate Markko explained that Ford had cast a young girl who bore a strong resemblance to Langston as Ford's love interest in his new film.  Although shocked by Markko's revelation, Langston pleaded with him to trust her and end his feud with Ford.  Assuring him that she only had eyes for him, Langston urged Markko to apologize to Ford.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a few feet away, Ford listened to David's ramblings, but also paid attention to Markko and Langston's discussion.  David was outraged that Ford hadn't given him a fair share of the film's earnings and insisted that he would file suit against Ford.  After explaining that David had no claim to any future residuals, Ford appeared to overhear Langston tell Markko that Ford was a nice guy.  To David's surprise, Ford changed his mind and agreed to split the film's royalties with David.  David was overjoyed when Ford announced, \"You'll receive a hefty 87!\"  An elated David accepted Ford's offer.\n\n\nOnce Ford walked away to draft a check for David, Langston commented that Ford had done the right thing concerning his dispute with David.  A disgusted Markko frowned.  Moments later, Ford returned and presented David with a check.  Without looking at the document, David told Markko that the deal was sealed.  \n\n\nAfter reminding David to forward him his share, Markko insisted that Langston leave with him.  Langston agreed to leave once Markko apologized to Ford.   Markko apologized in a sarcastic tone, but once Langston was out of earshot, Markko added, \"Your film stinks!\"   After Markko and Langston had left, David was stunned when he examined the check and realized that Ford had paid him eighty-seven cents.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Viki listened as Charlie confided in Natalie and Jessica that he had started drinking again.  While Viki tried to convince Charlie that he hadn't done anything wrong, Natalie was adamant that Mitch had driven Charlie to drink again and had caused her to nearly commit murder.  Agreeing with her mother and sister, Jessica announced, \"We need to find a way to get rid of him!\"  As the family discussed Mitch, they were horrified when he entered the caf\u00e9 and approached them.\n\n\nAfter directing several snide comments at Viki and her daughters, Mitch set his sights on a disturbed Charlie.  When Mitch began to antagonize him, Charlie responded by attacking Mitch.  With a tight grip on Mitch's shirt, Charlie threatened to kill him, but Viki and the girls convinced Charlie to release his hold on Mitch.   Afterward, Mitch smiled and exclaimed, \"I can't stay dead!\"  \n\n\nA distraught Charlie ran out of the caf\u00e9, and Viki followed close behind.    Meanwhile, Mitch took a seat at a booth.  When the waitress asked if she could take Mitch's order, he replied, \"No thanks, I believe I'm satisfied!\"\n\n\nOutside the caf\u00e9, Natalie and Jessica left Viki alone with Charlie.  Viki did her best to calm Charlie, who had flown into a rage.  Charlie was outraged that Mitch was allowed to walk free after murdering Jared.  When Charlie vowed to seek revenge against Mitch, Viki pleaded with her husband to end his vendetta against Mitch.  Unable to contain his anger any longer, Charlie stated that he needed time alone and rushed off.  Afterward, Viki stared through the window of the caf\u00e9 and locked eyes with Mitch.\n\n\nNatalie and Jessica paid John and Brody a visit at Rodi's.  Jessica appeared hopeful when Brody informed her that he believed the argument he and John had presented to Dorian had moved her.\n\n\nLater, a disguised Dorian walked into a seedy bar and ordered a martini.  Smelling the rose that she had received from Mel, Dorian mumbled to herself, \"You told me to find my way out of this mess, and I think I've found it!\"  Sipping on her martini, Dorian studied the room and hoped to spot an unsavory character she could convince to kill Mitch.  Moments later, Charlie entered the bar and ordered a scotch.\n\n\nAs Oliver attempted to enter his apartment, Rex approached him and enlisted his help in protecting Stacy.  Oliver listened as Rex detailed Mitch's kidnapping attempt and Mitch's desire to steal Rex and Stacy's unborn child.   Rex asked Oliver to provide Stacy with security.  Recalling his past involvement with Stacy, Oliver suggested that Rex hire another police officer for the job.  \n\n\nCiting that both Bo and John trusted Oliver, Rex was adamant that Oliver was the only cop who Rex knew wasn't under the control of Lowell and Mitch.  Pleading with Oliver to reconsider, Rex stated, \"You wouldn't hesitate if it were your baby!\"  Finally, Oliver reluctantly agreed to accept the job.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Stacy and Schuyler were speechless when they discovered that Kyle had entered the room and overheard Schuyler's admission that Schuyler, not Rex, was the father of Stacy's baby.  Stacy demanded that Kyle keep quiet, but Kyle was appalled at her recent plot.  Kyle criticized Stacy for her desperate attempt at capturing Rex's heart.  \n\n\nWhen Stacy reminded Kyle that he had helped her alter a DNA test in the past, Kyle stated that he had done it for Stacy and regretted his actions.  Citing that Rex's mother was a close friend, Kyle urged Stacy to tell Rex the truth, but she refused.  Schuyler reminded Kyle of his obligation as a resident doctor -- Kyle couldn't compromise a patient's privacy.   Before exiting the room, a disgusted Kyle announced that he had gotten his life together and didn't care what either Stacy or Schuyler did.\n\n\nAfterward, Stacy was convinced that Kyle couldn't be trusted to keep their secret.   Uncertain of Kyle's promise to keep quiet, Schuyler left the room in search of the resident doctor.   Meanwhile, Stacy rubbed her stomach and spoke to her unborn child.  Stacy promised her child a happy life that included Rex.\n\n\nAlone with Kyle, Schuyler attempted to explain the situation regarding Stacy's pregnancy.  When Kyle criticized Schuyler for sleeping with Stacy, Schuyler informed Kyle that Stacy had drugged and seduced him the night that she had become pregnant.  Recalling that Stacy had attempted to seduce him, too, Kyle believed Schuyler's explanation.  Declaring that he was happy with his own life, Kyle promised never to reveal Stacy and Schuyler's secret.   After his conversation with Schuyler, Kyle received a call from Oliver, requesting to speak with Kyle in person.\n\n\nSchuyler returned to Stacy's examination room and informed her that Kyle would remain silent regarding her child's paternity.  As Stacy gave a sigh of relief, Rex barged into the room and lashed out at Schuyler.  Stating that Schuyler had stolen Gigi from him, Rex questioned if Schuyler wanted Stacy and his baby as well.  After giving Schuyler a piece of his mind, Rex told Stacy that he would wait for her in the hall.  Before leaving, Rex informed Stacy that he had hired a police officer to protect her from Mitch.   Once Rex left, Schuyler still had reservations about Mitch, but Stacy was convinced that Rex had saved the day.\n\n\nWhen Kyle showed up at Oliver's apartment, he noticed his boyfriend's nervous demeanor.  Oliver told Kyle that he wouldn't have much time to spend with his lover because Oliver had accepted a job to protect Stacy from Mitch Laurence.  Kyle was speechless.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Mitch sat in a room and read Bible verses aloud.\n\n \n\n\n",
