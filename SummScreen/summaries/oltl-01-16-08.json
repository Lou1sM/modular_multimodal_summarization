Dr. Gibson starts the session and some of the kids share, but Cole and Langston aren't into it at all. They do say they feel defined by the fact that they've lost a loved one. Cole grumbles that the session is lame, and Dr. Gibson tells him to speak up. So he stands up and starts ranting about the way his dad put his family in danger for years, and there was nothing \"natural\" about watching his mother die. Langston looks worried about him. When Cole wants to leave, she stands up and takes a turn telling how her parents died. The session is over, and Dr. Gibson thanks them for sharing. She knows it's difficult. Cole and Langston see that they're going through the same thing, but they vow that what's said in therapy stays in therapy. They agree that they'll continue with the therapy as long as they can do it together. \n\n\nAntonio arrives at the diner and notices that Cristian's happy. It's because he has a date with Sarah.

Oliver continues to annoy Antonio, who reminds him they can hang out later, when their shift starts. Antonio calls Talia back and suggests Monday instead of Thursday. No go.
