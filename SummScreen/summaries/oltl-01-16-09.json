When David continued to rebuke her advances, Dorian realized that she needed to take drastic measures. David insisted that he was on a spiritual path that Dorian could never understand. Claiming that her life had been in turmoil ever since he left, Dorian shared that she sought inner peace and begged David to save her. When David stated that she would need to give up everything of value, Dorian agreed and asked him to show her the way. Unconvinced, David dropped one of Dorian's valuable vases and waited for her reaction. After having a brief fit, Dorian maintained that she had gained spiritual enlightenment. A doubtful David thanked Dorian for teaching him a valuable lesson then he left. Falling to her knees, Dorian declared that she would succeed at convincing David to marry her. Vowing to destroy Clint and Nora, Dorian announced that she would take back control of Buchanan Enterprises. \n\n\nLater, David chanted at his house of worship. Someone entered the room and joined in the ceremony. To his surprise, David looked over and observed Dorian dressed in a robe and sitting beside him. \n\n\nInside of Mr. Joplin's classroom, Starr prevented Cole from attacking the teacher. Starr informed Cole that Mr. J was actually Dr. Joplin's son and that she was only comforting him. An angered Cole blamed Dr. Joplin for killing his child and even accused Schuyler of being at fault. Starr maintained that Mr. J was also experiencing pain because he had lost his mother. Schuyler acknowledged that his mother had made a fatal mistake, but argued that she had killed herself because of her negligence. Schuyler said that his mother was a good person, and apologized for the pain she had caused Cole. Cole accepted Schuyler's apology and the two made peace with a handshake. Embarrassed, Starr excused herself and led Cole out into the hall. Alone, Schuyler locked some papers inside his desk drawer. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Starr demanded to know what had caused Cole to react in an irrational manner and questioned whether he was on drugs. Cole denied taking drugs and insisted that he was uptight due to the problems he was experiencing, but Starr was certain that Cole was under the influence of some drug. Assuring Cole that she understood what he was going through because she had lost both Hope and her father, Starr demanded to know where Cole had gotten the drugs. As Cole continued to deny possessing any narcotics, Starr reached into Cole's pocket and recovered a plastic bag filled with pills. Confessing that he needed something to take the edge off, Cole claimed that he would never become addicted. Holding the pills in her hand, Starr warned Cole that the drugs would only make his problems worse. While Starr and Cole continued to argue, a teacher approached and demanded that Starr divulge the contents of the plastic bag. Starr opened her hand and revealed the pills. Cole admitted that the pills belonged to him, but Starr lied to her teacher and insisted that she was the culprit. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Brody experienced another flashback of the little boy in Iraq. His thoughts were briefly interrupted when Gigi paid him a visit. Hoping to cheer him up, Gigi showed Shane's glowing report card to Brody and told him of the progress the child had made. When Gigi mentioned that Shane wanted to visit him, a cautious Brody admitted that he was experiencing problems and didn't want to frighten Shane. Divulging the details of his visions of the shooting, Brody told Gigi that he had memories of the little boy holding a gun, but he also had visions of the little boy being unarmed. \n\n\nGigi wondered if Brody had discussed his concerns with Wes. Brody shared that he had spoken with Wes, but was unable to gain any insight into the shooting. Reminding Brody that the government reports confirmed that the little boy was armed, Gigi assured Brody that his actions were justified. Before leaving, Gigi advised Brody that he wasn't alone, because she and Shane cared for him. Attempting to encourage him, Gigi told Brody that Wes was also concerned about his well-being. \n\n\nA disgusted John watched as Marty and Wes entered Rodi's. Wes revealed to Marty that he had come to Llanview to help his friend. Wes said that he wanted to protect his friend, but feared that he was only causing him problems. Explaining that his friend was consumed with guilt, Wes maintained that the incident wasn't Brody's fault. Wes said that his friend needed answers, but Wes believed that if he told Brody the truth that it would only make him feel worse. Drawing from her own personal experience, Marty advised Wes that it was difficult for a person to recover upon learning that someone they trusted kept secrets from them. Moved by Marty's insight, Wes excused himself to phone Brody. As Marty played a game of pool, John approached. John wondered if Marty had showed up at the bar for his benefit. \n\n\nOutside of Rodi's, Gigi ran into Wes after he had placed a call to Brody. Wes mentioned that he had tried to call Brody, but was told that his friend was meeting with someone. When Gigi informed Wes that she had paid Brody a visit and was certain that he was probably speaking with his doctor, Wes appeared concerned. Upon learning that Brody was still experiencing conflicting visions of the shooting, Wes was noticeably bothered. He listened as Gigi revealed that she feared that Brody might be in real trouble if he didn't receive closure. \n\n\nBack inside Rodi's, Marty flirted with John. Hoping to gain Marty's trust, John accepted her offer to play a game of darts. As the two played, Wes returned and told Marty that he needed to check on his friend. Marty understood and assured him that she would be fine. Afterward, John asked Marty why she had deserted her family and was behaving in a destructive manner. She told him that he was witnessing the real Marty. She was no longer the Marty who hung onto Todd. Taking a swig of beer, Marty asked John if he didn't approve of the old Marty. John related that he never knew the old Marty. Revealing that the old Marty was selfish and self-destructive, Marty planted a kiss on John. \n\n\nWes paid Brody a visit and stated that he had a confession to make. Brody revealed that the child Brody killed in Iraq wasn't armed. \n\n\nAt the cottage, as Clint and Dr. Levin looked on, Tess begged Viki to help her find out what happened the night she gave birth. When Dr. Levin tried to help Tess uncover the details of that night, Tess recalled that Niki Smith helped her deliver the baby. Viki negated Tess's claims, but Tess assured Viki that Niki was in her subconscious that night and had helped her through the labor. Explaining that Niki knew about Tess's plan to kill Natalie and Jared, Tess revealed that Niki had pleaded with her to save them. As Tess attempted to leave the cottage and help the couple, Tess confessed that she was overcome with pain and Niki had helped her deliver the child. In a panic, Tess insisted that she didn't believe that her baby was breathing. Attempting to calm Tess, Viki told Tess that she didn't hear the baby cry because she was in shock. Tess disagreed and argued that the baby never cried. As a look of horror crossed Tess's face, she exclaimed, \"Oh my God, I know what happened!\" \n\n\nMeanwhile, in her subconscious, Jessica had an encounter with Bess. Informing Jessica that Tess had surfaced, Bess blamed Jessica for Tess's actions. Jessica pleaded with Bess to tell her the truth about her baby, but Bess refused and insisted that Jessica was fragile and needed her protection. Jessica assured Bess that she could handle the secret no matter how devastating it was. Shaking her head, Bess was certain that Jessica couldn't accept the truth. As Jess and her alter ego continued to argue, Bess leaned down and whispered into Jessica's ear. A teary eyed, Jessica cried, \"No!\" \n\n\nAs Tess struggled with the revelation, Dr. Levin asked Tess to come back but Jessica surfaced instead. Jessica was desperate to learn what Tess had told everyone. When Clint stated that Tess didn't say anything of importance, Jess assumed that Tess didn't know the truth about the baby. She related that Bess told her the truth and she knew what had happened to her baby. Jessica said that it was all her fault. \n\n\nBack in Jess's subconscious, a caged Tess asked, \"My baby is dead isn't she?\" With no emotion, Bess replied, \"Yes.\" As a distraught Tess cried, Bess said that it was Tess's fault.\n\n\n",
