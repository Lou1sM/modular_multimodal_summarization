Although Cole made every attempt to confess, Starr lied and said that the pills belonged to her. Claiming that the drugs were anti-depressants, Starr managed to convince her teacher that she had been given a prescription for the pills after the loss of her baby. \n\n\nAfterward, Starr begged Cole to find another way to deal with his pain, but he argued that his troubles were overwhelming. Admitting that she was also dealing with her own difficulties, Starr revealed that Dr. Joplin had actually written her the prescription for the anti-depressants, but she had chosen not to fill the order. Explaining that she didn't want to cope with her loss by using drugs, Starr urged Cole to think about the consequences of his actions. Cole watched as Starr walked away. Moments later, he removed a pill from the plastic bag and placed it in his mouth. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Wes revealed that the young boy that Brody had killed in Iraq wasn't armed at the time of the shooting. When Brody argued that he remembered seeing the gun in the child's hand, Wes decided that it was time to tell his friend the truth. Remembering the horrific incident, Wes related that Brody had gone into a fit of hysterics after the shooting. Wes had taken Brody into another area and investigated the scene for himself. Wes discovered that the boy had a flashlight in his possession, not a gun. Convinced that Brody wouldn't be able to live with the guilt of killing an unarmed child, Wes retrieved a weapon and planted it on the young boy. With the help of another soldier, Wes covered up the truth revolving the shooting. Apologizing for keeping the truth from Brody, Wes insisted that he was only trying to protect his friend. After Wes left, Brody had a vision of the dead child. In tears, Brody cradled the little boy in his arms. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, John was startled when Marty kissed him. Declaring that she was merely conducting an experiment, Marty confessed that she was posing as the party girl that she once was. In an attempt to belittle John, Marty insisted that John's kiss had no effect on her and she couldn't believe that they were once lovers. As John tried to convince Marty that she was headed down a dangerous path, Marty reached over and kissed him again. To their surprise, John and Marty turned around and discovered that Blair had witnessed the kiss. \n\n\nAn angered Blair demanded to know what was going on between John and Marty. Admitting that she was playing games, Marty lashed out at Blair and John and condemned them for saving Todd's life. Reminding Marty that she had talked Todd into committing suicide, Blair asked Marty if she wanted a man's death hanging over her head. Marty continued to verbally attack Blair. She accused Blair of rescuing Todd because she still loved him. John listened silently as Blair denied having any feelings for Todd. As the two women argued, Marty remarked that Blair was jealous of her. Marty announced that Todd loved her and not Blair. She insisted that Blair hated the idea of Todd loving anyone other than herself. Fed up with Marty's antics, Blair demanded that John toss Marty out of the bar, but John objected and said that it wouldn't solve the problem. Infuriated, Blair stormed out. \n\n\nMarty teased John about Blair and continued to flirt with him. An annoyed John walked away. Wes entered the bar and approached Marty. When she asked what was bothering him, Wes explained that he believed his friend was in trouble. \n\n\nAt the cottage, a terrified Jessica announced that Bess had told her the truth. When Viki and Clint asked her for details, Jessica advised them to contact Natalie and Jared. She insisted that they needed to be present when she revealed the truth. \n\n\nAfter Chloe's doctor appointment, Natalie and Jared ran into Marcie and Michael at the hospital. When Marcie remarked that Chloe was a beautiful baby, Natalie asked Marcie if she wanted to hold the child. Michael watched as Marcie happily accepted the baby. As Marcie and Michael admired Chloe, Natalie received a call from Viki. Viki stated that Jessica had asked to see Natalie and Jared at once. The couple left Chloe in the care of the McBains and headed to the cottage. \n\n\nWhile enjoying their time with Chloe, Marcie assured Michael that she was aware that the child wasn't theirs. Marcie admitted that her interaction with Chloe left her feeling the loss of baby Hope. To Marcie's surprise, Michael stated that he understood her emotions. Michael promised Marcie that they would always be a family. Marcie wondered what life would be like had Hope survived. \n\n\nIn Jessica's subconscious, a caged Tess demanded to know what had happened to her child. Bess told Tess that her child had died during childbirth and that Tess was to blame. As a distraught Tess listened, Bess informed her that Tess's obsession with killing Natalie and Jared had led to the death of her child. Bess suggested that Tess had been negligent. Bess reminded Tess that she had missed several doctor's appointments and failed to go to the emergency room after having the contractions. Bess revealed that she had switched the dead child with Starr's baby. When Tess insisted upon knowing what Bess had actually told Jessica, Bess stated that she had told Jessica the truth. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared arrived at the cottage to see Jessica. In tears, Jessica said that she had a confession to make. Jessica told Natalie and Jared that she had tried to kill them. As Natalie defended her sister by blaming Tess, Jessica announced that she was aware that Tess was attempting to take over and she did nothing to prevent it. Insisting that she was furious with the couple and held them responsible for Nash's death, Jessica declared that she had allowed Tess to surface because she knew her alter ego would kill them. Jessica maintained that she wanted Tess to commit an act that she incapable of committing - murder. \n\n\nAdmitting that she didn't tell Jessica about the baby's death, Bess stated that Jessica wouldn't be able to handle the loss of her baby. When Tess chastised Bess for taking Starr's baby, Bess was adamant that Starr could cope with losing her baby, but Jessica would be devastated. Bess insisted that there was only one resolution - they would have to integrate. Bess stated that Jessica would be released from St. Anne's and allowed to raise her two daughters. Bess told Tess that her work was done and urged her to allow Jessica to experience a breakthrough. Unlocking the cage and reaching for Tess's hand, Bess suggested that Tess was in desperate need of rest. Acknowledging that she was growing tired, a defeated Tess walked off with Bess. A drowsy Tess told Bess that she was very tired. Bess helped Tess into bed. Placing a sheet over a sleeping Tess, Bess declared, \"Now we can all rest!\" \n\n\nBack at the cottage, Jessica grew very tired and told her parents that she needed to rest. While Natalie looked at her sister with deep concern, Viki was suspicious. When Clint stated that he was thankful that the truth had been revealed, Viki insisted that something was terribly wrong. Reminding Clint that Tess was adamant that something had happened to the baby, Viki argued that no information involving the child had been divulged. Viki feared the truth hadn't been exposed. As they watched their troubled daughter, Clint wondered if they would ever learn the truth.\n\n\n",
