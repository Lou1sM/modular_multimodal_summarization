As he walked down the stairs, Todd smiled when the pair awkwardly attempted to make up an excuse for Elijah's visit. Todd asked about Danielle and T\u00e9a, and Elijah advised him sadly that the mother and daughter would probably never return to Llanview. After Elijah was gone, Todd informed Blair that he had heard Elijah and her having sex all night. Blair denied it, even when Todd found Elijah's tie in the couch. Pulling on Todd's arm, Blair declared that she wanted to give Todd some happiness. She didn't mean heading upstairs with him as he assumed.\n\n\nStarr's roommates surprised her with a special meal for her 18th birthday. Starr learned that Addie was looking after Hope so that Starr and Cole could spend some quality time together. Cole spoke to Markko out of earshot and teased him about hearing Markko and Langston having sex all night. Markko divulged that Langston had been really wild. Starr told Langston that she had heard her friend and Markko all night, and noted that she was only worried about all the noise in the apartment. She was afraid the landlord would find out how many people were actually living there. Langston confided that she had a secret to tell Starr.\n\n\nBlair and Todd interrupted Langston and Starr when they showed up to surprise Starr for her birthday. The young people apologized for the place being so crowded, and Blair assured her daughter that things would be better one day. Todd wondered out loud how long the entire situation would last. He also apologized for being in a bad mood. He handed Starr a large check for her birthday and told her he was proud of her and she was terrific. He mentioned that things never went as planned. \"T\u00e9a?\" Starr asked her mother. \"Among other things,\" Blair replied. Todd left the birthday celebration. Markko told Langston that they had been too loud the night before, but they would have their own place soon.\n\n\nAs Starr and Cole headed out, Langston advised Starr that her secret had been about dying her hair. Markko left and Langston remained behind with Blair. Langston admitted that she missed Dorian but she couldn't condone Dorian's actions. Blair offered to listen anytime that Langston had anything to talk about, and Langston accepted her offer right away. She admitted that she had to talk to someone about something that had been bothering her.\n\n\nRex and Stacy showed up at Oliver's apartment so that Rex could pay Oliver for his time spent watching over Stacy. Rex assured both Oliver and Kyle that he was protecting his baby from Mitch. Stacy excused herself to walk out to the hallway to answer the phone.\n\n\nAfter Stacy and Rex left, Kyle appeared out of sorts, though Oliver said he felt sorry for Rex. Oliver thought that Stacy was seductive and he admitted that she had even taken advantage of him during his period of confusion. Kyle teased him, but Oliver reminded him that he had his \"non-gay\" moments. Looking thoughtful, Kyle wanted to know if Oliver had ever slept with Stacy. He gave Oliver the third degree until Oliver described his past with Stacy. He admitted sleeping with her on Valentine's Day of the year before, but that was only the first time.\n\n\nAppalled, Kyle listened as Oliver revealed that he had slept with Stacy again the night before he \"came out.\" He was confused because Kyle continued to push for all of the facts and Oliver related how he dated Layla and was jealous of Kyle and Nick. He was drunk and ended up with Stacy. The next morning he had a hangover, and after that he \"came out.\" Kyle was worked up and appeared on the verge of hyperventilating. He had something to tell Oliver. He explained that the event at the hospital that he was unable to disclose due to patient confidentiality involved Stacy and Schuyler. He had walked in on them in an exam room and had heard that the baby was not Rex's. Schuyler had said it was his.\n\n\nKyle divulged that Stacy had lost Rex's baby and she had a plan to get pregnant again. She tried Kyle who had been involved in other scams with her, but he had refused her. She went to Schuyler and then Oliver. \"Oh my God,\" Oliver proclaimed. Kyle pointed out, \"Look at the timing.\" He recapped that Stacy had lost the baby and had gone after three different guys. \"Bingo, she's pregnant,\" he concluded. \"So you're saying that the baby could be mine,\" Oliver stated in disbelief.\n\n\nAs he headed out the door of his new apartment, Schuyler quickly told Rachel about all of the activities he had planned for the day. He received a call from Kim, who asked him to do her a favor and stop by the Buchanan mansion. He was unaware that Stacy listened in via three-way calling.\n\n\nShortly after Schuyler left, Rachel welcomed T\u00e9a and Danielle into the apartment. Rachel had lots of questions for T\u00e9a, who hesitated and faltered over her words. Finally, T\u00e9a just acknowledged that it \"felt right coming back.\" She confided that Danielle knew that Todd was her biological father. She stated that Tahiti had been complicated, but she'd had a revelation. Danielle wanted to get to know Todd. T\u00e9a felt that she had to focus on her daughter and not think about her own relationship with Todd. Rachel thought that T\u00e9a was giving Danielle too much power over the situation, and was concerned about Danielle learning about Todd's history.\n\n\nAs the women chatted, Danielle eavesdropped nearby. T\u00e9a explained that she wanted Danielle to meet the new and changed Todd first before she learned of his past. T\u00e9a headed out and Rachel urged the young girl to make herself at home. Danielle admitted that the news about Todd was a shock, and she thought he was a \"real jerk.\" Rachel made it known that she was all too familiar with Todd, because she had attended college with him. She attempted to change the subject and asked Danielle if she had tried to reach Matthew yet. Annoyed, Danielle stated that she deserved to know what Todd was like.\n\n\nDanielle worried that Todd was a monster since everyone was concerned about her reaction to him. She wanted to know what Rachel's opinion of Todd was, but a phone call interrupted Rachel. Speaking to someone briefly, Rachel ended the call and advised Danielle that she had to head to her office. Danielle spied the laptop and walked straight over to it. She typed Todd's name into the search engine and waited for the information to appear.\n\n\nMatthew ran into Destiny at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 and sat down at her table. He wondered if she was avoiding him because of Danielle, but Destiny disagreed, insisting that she had been busy. She wouldn't be avoiding Matthew since Danielle was gone anyway, she added. She wondered if Matthew missed his new friend, but Matthew didn't want to talk about it. He confessed that he and Danielle had kissed but it hadn't been anything that was planned. They had gone through a lot together, Danielle was leaving, and they were saying goodbye. He didn't think he'd ever see her again.\n\n\nMatthew was getting used to the idea that he had lost Danielle, and he didn't know how things would have turned out if Danielle had remained in Llanview. He did know that he didn't want to lose Destiny, too, and he had missed her. Destiny had missed Matthew as well. They agreed to be friends again.\n\n\nRex and Stacy entered the caf\u00e9 and Rex spotted Elijah. He advised the attorney that he and Gigi were working things out and he would not be filing for Shane's custody. He wanted to make sure that his second child didn't fall into the wrong hands though. Stacy introduced herself to Elijah as Rex explained what he and the lawyer were talking about. Rex wanted to discuss paternity and guardianship of his new child, and wanted to make sure that all ties with Mitch were severed. Elijah thought it was a good idea for the couple to have wills that detailed the custody of the child if something should happen to them.\n\n\nRex suggested that one of his sisters would be able to take care of his child, but Stacy voiced a loud dissension of his idea. She noted that his sisters hated her. She also shot down his suggestion that Gigi would be a good choice and added that she didn't want anyone in Rex's family to take care of her baby. Rex advised that he would get back to Elijah regarding the baby's potential guardian, but he also wanted a paternity test. Elijah offered to draw up the papers for the wills.\n\n\nMarkko sat at a table and looked at a brochure that advertised one-bedroom apartments that were \"perfect for young couples.\"\n\n\nSchuyler arrived at the Buchanan mansion and quietly observed as Kim and Nigel had words. Amused, he advised Kim that Nigel obviously hated her. Getting right to the point, Kim asked Schuyler to steal some drugs from the hospital for Stacy's baby. Kim explained that she needed some oxytocin. Disgusted, Schuyler realized that it was for Stacy's labor to be induced, permitting her to have \"Rex's baby\" on time. He refused to steal the drug and jeopardize his position at the hospital. Kim reminded him that if the baby weren't delivered on time, Rex would be suspicious.\n\n\nSchuyler suggested that Stacy leave town, cite a distant aunt, and deliver the baby elsewhere. Kim rejected that idea and pointed out that Gigi would know there was no aunt. Again, Schuyler refused to steal the drug, and explained that it was for women who were late. He stressed emphatically that the baby's health would have to take precedence over Stacy's love life. Kim ordered Schuyler to do it, but Schuyler responded that he would tell Rex the truth first.\n\n\nAnnoyed, Kim reminded Schuyler that Rex would call Gigi right away if that happened. Kim wondered how Gigi would handle the news. Schuyler continued to refuse Kim's request. Kim stressed that Stacy was too close to the baby and would never do anything to harm it. She assured Schuyler that if he didn't get the drug for them, she'd be able to find someone else to get it and she would administer it herself. Schuyler called her the \"devil incarnate\" and she urged him to \"step up.\" Stacy and Rex showed up at the mansion, which interrupted them, and Kim ordered Schuyler to leave through a back door.\n\n\nRex asked permission to leave Stacy at the mansion while he headed to Ultraviolet. He didn't have security available at that time. Kim assured him it was fine. She whispered to Stacy that Schuyler had been there and she had told him he'd lose Gigi if he didn't get the drug.\n\n\nTodd arrived home and found T\u00e9a waiting for him. Smiling from ear to ear, he told her he had forgotten about everything that he wanted to say to her except that he loved her. They kissed and he murmured, \"You're back.\"  They both said they missed each other, but T\u00e9a firmly told him there was something they had to do. She revealed that Danielle knew about Todd and was nervous to meet him.\n\n\nDisclosing that her problem had to do with sex, Langston waited as a surprised Blair settled herself down to chat. Blair received a text message from Elijah, but she ignored it in order to hear about Langston's predicament. Langston mentioned that Ford was back in town, and Markko was highly jealous of him. She admitted that during sex with Markko, she had suddenly thought about Ford.\n\n\n",
