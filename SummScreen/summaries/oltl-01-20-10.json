    "soap_central": "\n \nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Markko greeted Cristian, who was visiting on his day off.  Cris didn't want his friend waiting on him, but Markko said he needed the hours before taking off for Starr and Langston's dual birthday bash at Capricorn.  Just then, Ford, ready to ruin Markko's day, arrived and sat down beside his new roommate.  When Ford asked about the party, Cristian suggested he check out Capricorn, but Markko pointedly informed the hunk that it was a private engagement.  Oblivious to the boys' animosity, Cristian offered to give Ford a spare ticket.\n\n\nFord begged off and said he had to work on Markko's class syllabus, but Cristian encouraged him to delay his assignment one night and give Capricorn the once-over.  Ford grinned at Markko, and said he'd only go if it were okay with Markko and Langston.  Irritated, Markko called Ford's bluff and invited Ford to the party as his personal guest - the party would be so full, he promised Langston wouldn't even know Ford was there.\n\n\nAfter Markko left, Cristian quizzed Ford about the tension between the two.  Ford claimed it was only about Markko's documentary, then admitted it might have more to do with Langston.  He'd had an encounter with Langston the last time he was in town, and Markko had been jealous, but he had no real interest in the girl.  Cristian was skeptical, but Ford insisted, \"Markko has nothing to worry about.\"\n\n\nBack at Langston and Markko's place, Blair laughed off Langston's fears about Ford, and told the girl that fantasies about other men were common and natural.  She asked Langston if Markko was bad in bed, but Langston insisted that he was great-a great lover, a great boyfriend, a great guy-and yet she couldn't stop thinking about Ford and his body.  Langston laced into herself for her roving eye, but Blair assured the girl that she had nothing to worry about, so long as she didn't have real feelings for Ford.  Langston swore up and down that she didn't.\n\n\nLangston asked if she needed to tell Markko about her illicit thoughts of Ford.  \"Absolutely not!\" Blair cried; Langston needed to stay away from Ford, it needed to be their little secret, and she couldn't tell Markko.\n\n\n\"Tell me what?\" Markko asked, walking into the apartment.  Blair covered by claiming that she and Langston were conspiring about Starr's birthday gift, and told the kids she'd see them at Capricorn.  As Blair exited the apartment, she took another glance at her text message from Elijah and beat feet.\n\n\nInside, Markko told Langston that Cristian had taken over his shift at the caf\u00e9, so he was free for more time with his ladylove.  He told her that he'd seen Ford at the Buenos Dias, but had taken the high road, and had even gone so far as to offer him an invitation to Capricorn.  \"Why'd you do that?\" Langston cried.  Markko said he was being neighborly, and claimed Ford had looked \"pathetic\" and lonely.\n\n\nConflicted, Langston sat down on the couch, as she wrestled with her thoughts.  Markko's mind was on lovemaking, but Langston stopped him and asked if he knew how much he meant to her.  She said he was a wonderful boyfriend, loving and supportive, and Markko told her she made it easy.  Langston embraced him, confused.\n\n\nStarr and Cole arrived at the Hallowed Grounds coffee shop, still on their birthday spending spree.  Starr couldn't believe Todd had been so generous with his money, but Cole said he could understand a father spoiling his daughter on her special day, just as he wanted to when Hope was Starr's age.  He admitted he couldn't blame Todd for wanting to shower Starr with love and material comforts.\n\n\nMitch Laurence's untimely arrival interrupted the lovers' birthday bliss. Mitch handed the teens pamphlets for his cult while clucking about the sin of their child born out of wedlock, and calling both of them \"lost souls.\"  Starr ordered him to leave them alone, but Mitch continued holding forth, and suggested that they couldn't have turned out any less dysfunctional. He cited the sins of their parents and referenced Blair as \"the town tramp\" and Todd as the rapist.  He asked Cole how he could stand to forgive Todd's trespasses against Marty, and reminded him that she'd been \"ruined forever\" by Todd's actions.  Enraged, Cole attacked Mitch and shoved him to the floor.\n\n\nA security guard stepped in, but Mitch told the rent-a-cop there was no problem; he was merely spreading \"the word of the Lord.\"  The guard told Mitch there was no soliciting on the property without a permit, so Mitch took his leave, but not before wishing the shaken Starr a happy birthday.\n\n\nStarr and Cole cuddled together, and Cole apologized for letting Mitch ruin her day.  Starr said that Mitch couldn't ruin her best birthday ever; she had Cole and Hope, and everything she ever wanted.  Outside the restaurant, however, Mitch continued to watch the young lovers from the street.\n\n\nAt Todd's, T\u00e9a gave Todd the good news: Danielle knew he was her father, and had returned to Llanview to get to know him.  Todd was stunned, and angered that T\u00e9a had let him believe she'd be gone for an extended period.  He questioned what could possibly make Danielle want to know him after he'd killed Ross, but T\u00e9a told him that was just it; he hadn't killed Ross.  Recounting Ross's miraculous resurrection in Tahiti, T\u00e9a told Todd that her ex was the one who had convinced Danielle to go back to Llanview and get to know \"the real Todd.\"  Todd wasn't sure that Danielle learning all about her father was the best idea, but T\u00e9a reassured him that she'd seen through his \"flaws\" and their daughter would, too.\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd he was lucky, and that Ross's intervention had given him and Danielle a second chance.  When Ross had heard about Danielle pulling a gun on Todd, he'd decided she had to know the truth and not follow in Ross's footsteps.  Thanks to Ross, Todd and Danielle could start all over.  Todd reminded T\u00e9a that if Danielle knew the truth, then she'd want to know everything about him.  T\u00e9a admitted that Todd's past was a minefield, but they both agreed that he had to be the one to tell Danielle.\n\n\nCradling T\u00e9a in his arms, Todd thanked her for returning to him.  T\u00e9a thanked him for being there to return to, instead of rekindling the home fires with Blair.  Just then, Blair rushed into the house and called out for Todd.  She stopped short when she saw Todd and T\u00e9a's romantic clinch.  \"What the hell are you doing here?\" the two women said in chorus.\n\n\nT\u00e9a instantly assumed the worst, but Blair said she and the boys were only staying with Todd until they found better accommodations.  Smirking, she assured the steamed T\u00e9a she no longer had any interest in Todd.  She asked what T\u00e9a was doing back in town, but the lady lawyer blew her off.  T\u00e9a told Todd she'd retrieve Danielle, and she stomped out of the house and slammed the front door.\n\n\nBlair asked Todd why T\u00e9a had returned from Tahiti so soon, and sarcastically added, \"Were they out of sunscreen?\"  Todd told her that Danielle knew the truth about him, and it was time that he, T\u00e9a, and Danielle became a family.  Blair was surprised that things were moving so fast, and warned Todd not to rush; she had a feeling his building a relationship with Danielle would be harder than he thought.\n\n\nAt Rachel's apartment, Danielle began to browse the \"Llannet\" search engine for information on Todd.  She got more than she bargained for, and was horrified by a flurry of articles about Marty's gang rape, Todd's posing as Walker Laurence, the murder of Margaret Cochran, and Marty's second rape in 2008.  As the articles began to print, Danielle stared at the computer screen, dazed.  There was a knock at the door; from the hallway, Matthew called for Rachel.  Overcome, Danielle opened the door to face the surprised boy.\n\n\nMatthew was stunned to see Danielle back in Llanview and staying at Rachel's, but Danielle said the details didn't matter; what mattered was that she was back because Todd Manning was her biological father.  Holding up the ream of printed documents, she asked Matthew if he'd known about Todd's sordid past, and realized that everyone in Llanview had-everyone but her.  Matthew was flabbergasted, and admitted he didn't know what to say.  Danielle told him there was nothing that could be said when you learned your life was a lie.  Matthew alluded to his own identity crisis over Bo and Sam Rappaport, but said he'd tell Danielle the story another time.\n\n\nDanielle couldn't believe that a man like Todd was her father, but the biggest question in her mind was how T\u00e9a could have gone back to him or wanted him after everything he'd done.  She didn't know who was sicker: Todd, for all the crimes he'd committed, or T\u00e9a, for still loving him.  Todd had raped, murdered, escaped prison, even terrorized Matthew's mother, and yet T\u00e9a had seen him as more fit to raise Danielle than Ross was.  \"He's not good enough to be my dad but Todd is?\"\n\n\nMatthew told her that Bo and Nora had fought many times to put Todd in prison, but he'd always walked away from his crimes.  Danielle wished she could walk away from Todd and Llanview, but Matthew said that if she did, he'd miss her.  Danielle said she didn't want to leave him, or anyone else, but she also had no interest in a relationship with Todd, and T\u00e9a was en route to take her to their \"family reunion.\"  Matthew asked Danielle what he could do to help her, and swore he'd do anything.\n\n\nSometime later, T\u00e9a arrived at the apartment, and called out for Danielle.  She couldn't find the girl, and failed to notice the open laptop, full of open browser windows all about Todd's dark past.\n\n\nAt Oliver's apartment, Kyle warned Oliver that Oliver could, in fact, be the father of Stacy's baby.  When he quizzed his boyfriend on the timeline of their last sexual encounter in August, he realized the dates matched as well; Stacy could be carrying Fish's child.  She'd told Rex that she was going to deliver in February, but instead she'd deliver in March.  She'd miscarried Rex's baby, and had prowled the town looking for another man to impregnate her, first Schuyler, then Oliver.  Oliver was horrified at the thought that he could have spawned Stacy's demon seed.\n\n\nNeither Kyle nor Oliver could understand why Stacy would've told Schuyler he was the baby's father, or why Schuyler would've gone along with her scheme.  They wondered what Schuyler's agenda was. Oliver held out hope that Schuyler truly was the father, but Kyle said they had to be sure, and promised he'd stand with Oliver every step of the way.  He said that Oliver needed to use his policeman's instincts and follow the trail of evidence to the source.  Oliver continued to grapple with the thought that he could be a father.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Kim was ready for a big lunch of Rodi's takeout, and asked a distant Stacy for her order.  Stacy, lost in thought, said, \"I'm gonna die.\"  She told Kim about her meeting with Rex and Elijah regarding a living will, and said the discussion had reminded her of the danger she faced from Mitch.  Stacy was determined to find someone who could be there for her child in the event of her death, and neither Rex's choice of his \"biased\" sisters nor Gigi would do.  Stacy had her own person in mind for her child's legal guardian: Kim.\n\n\nKim was taken aback by Stacy's proposal, and said Stacy needn't worry about dying so young, but Stacy wasn't convinced.  She felt that Kim was the only person who would keep her alive in her child's eyes, the \"real\" her, not the person Natalie, Jessica, or Gigi saw her as.  Kim was touched by the gesture, but said she'd do anything for Stacy-lie, cheat, steal-yet \"I draw the line at diapers.\"\n\n\nStacy pleaded with Kim to reconsider, and said that after Kim won Clint and married him, she could get a squad of nannies and maids to look after the child, so long as Stacy knew the baby would be cared for.  Kim reluctantly agreed to sign on the dotted line but said there was no need, as Stacy and Rex weren't going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n\nJust then, Oliver and Kyle burst into the drawing room.  Stacy was put out and told Oliver she didn't need round-the-clock protection at the Buchanan mansion.  \"No, what you need is an ass-whoopin'!\" Kyle snapped.  Oliver demanded answers from Stacy about why she had not told him he could be the father of her child.\n\n\nStacy denied that they'd had sex the previous summer, but Oliver remembered her confirming their second tryst.  \"You've known me long enough to know that just because I say something doesn't mean it's the truth,\" Stacy huffed.  Besides, she said, he was too drunk to remember.  Oliver didn't buy it, but Kim doubted Oliver had a wealth of experience with the fairer sex to draw on, and said, \"You wouldn't know your way around a woman with a GPS!\"  Kyle warned the stripping duo that if he and Oliver didn't receive confirmation that Schuyler was the baby's father, they'd go straight to him and Rex with what they knew.\n\n\nKim called Kyle a once and future blackmailer, and said, \"You really give gays a bad name.\"  \"You and Stacy ain't exactly doing strippers and sluts any favors, either,\" Kyle shot back.  Kim told Oliver the women wouldn't give Kyle and Oliver any information, and added that if either Oliver or Kyle attempted to go to Rex or Schuyler, she would retaliate by going to the hospital board and informing them that Kyle had used privileged information to blackmail a patient.  \"Check and mate, bitches!\" Stacy chirped.\n\n\nKyle told Kim and Stacy they had no shame.  \"And proud of it,\" Stacy replied.  Enraged, Kyle accused her of putting her obsession with Rex before her own safety and that of the child she was carrying; without her claim that Rex was the baby's father, Mitch Laurence would have no interest in her.  Before Kyle could totally lose his temper, Oliver pulled him away, and told Kim and Stacy they were leaving.\n\n\nAfter Oliver and Kyle exited, Stacy was shaken as she recognized the force of Kyle's words.  Kim told her not to worry; Kyle and Oliver wouldn't tell, because Kyle had as much to lose as Stacy did.\n\n\nOutside the mansion, Kyle was still furious, and was ready to go to Rex and Schuyler regardless of the consequences for his medical career.  But Oliver refused to let him jeopardize his future, and said that they'd wait until the baby was born, and then get a DNA test.  In the meantime, he said he'd protect Stacy-and the child that could be his-from Mitch with his life. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Stacy asks Kim to be her child's godmother. Kyle and Fish demand to know if Oliver is the child's father. When Stacy and Kim refuse to answer, they threaten to tell Rex and Schuyler. Stacy reminds Kyle that he can't divulge private medical information.

Fish tells Kyle that he can wait until the baby is born and then have a paternity test. Mitch Laurence expresses an interest in Cole and Starr joining his congregation and bringing baby Hope along.
