R.J. invites himself in, but Lindsay is nervous that Bo could come home at any time and she would have to explain R.J.'s presence.  R.J. makes a toast to Lindsay getting away with killing Spencer Truman; he tells her that he realizes she was fully aware of her actions and compliments Lindsay on fooling everyone.  Lindsay becomes uncomfortable and attempts to deny R.J.'s claims.  Finally, Lindsay admits to faking her breakdown and begs R.J. to keep her secret; he agrees.  When R.J. informs Lindsay that Marcie is still in jail and that Sam has been returned to Todd, Lindsay is saddened and feels her actions accomplished nothing.  R.J. tells her that she prevented Blair from being raped.  Lindsay tells R.J. that was not her reason for killing Spencer, and she would do it all over again if it would help Marcie.  R.J. tells Lindsay that she had better be careful because she has a target on her back.  Lindsay is confident and states that because she was found innocent by reason of insanity, she cannot be charged twice.  R.J. is not convinced and tells her that Nora will be watching and may find a way around it all.  Lindsay tells R.J. that in order for Nora to nail her she would have to prove that she was not insane when she killed Spencer and that she was faking her mental breakdown.  Lindsay is shaken up when R.J. informs her that she may have fooled Bo, but not Nora. He is convinced that Nora will never give up especially now that Lindsay is living with Bo.  R.J. tells her not to slip up because if he saw though her act, it is very possible that Bo will also.  He further states that if Bo finds out that Lindsay has been lying, he will turn her in.

Lindsay informs R.J. that Bo does not want to suspect her because he wants to believe in her.  R.J. questions if she feels Bo is in love with her.  Lindsay says that he cares about her.  When R.J. asks if she cares about Bo, Lindsay tells him that she is grateful to Bo for being so supportive.  R.J. is worried that Lindsay will not be careful.  Lindsay admits if Bo ever sees through her, she will lose everything.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Enterprise board meeting, Pamela tells the family that Asa never conceived a child with Valarie Banks.  While Bo, Clint, and Nash display a knowing reaction to the news, a shocked Jared begins defending himself.  Jared tells everyone that Valarie Banks was indeed his mother and questions how Pamela would have any knowledge of whether she and Asa had a child together.  Before Pamela can answer, Jessica and Natalie arrive and announce that they returned from Paris, Texas, with Viki.   Jessica immediately questions why Pamela is at the board meeting. Bo informs the girls that Pamela has information that proves Asa never conceived a child with Jared's mother.  When Pamela confirms that Valarie never had a relationship with Asa, Natalie tells Jared that maybe he really is not a Buchanan.  Pamela shocks the entire Buchanan clan when she tells them that Valarie Banks was her sister.  Bo immediately reacts to the news and tells Pamela that she never mentioned this important information during any of their conversations concerning Valarie.  Pamela apologizes for misleading Bo and tells him that she never meant to do so, but felt she needed to explain her knowledge of the situation in person to the entire family.  Pamela tells the Buchanans that Jared is Asa's child and she is his mother.  Pamela goes on to tell the Buchanans that she had a son with Asa but gave the child to her sister Valarie to raise as her own. She felt that she would lose Asa had she kept their son.  Jared tells Pamela that his mother would have never kept such a secret from him.  Pamela states that his mother never wanted to lose his love by revealing the truth.  She tells him that Valarie kept her informed about his life up until the time of her death.  While the entire family appears horrified by Pamela's revelation, Sarah shows no interest as she puts on makeup in preparation for her date with Cristian.  Bo does not believe Asa would have ever gone along with such a thing.  Clint questions why Pamela waited so long to come forth with the information.  Pamela states that she never intended to reveal the truth, however, when Bo told her about Asa's letter, she felt it was time.  When Bo informs Pamela that he has serious doubts about her story, she offers him an envelope that she claims contains a picture of Jared as a baby and a lock of hair.  Bo accepts the envelope and looks at the picture.  However, when Jared begins to dispute Pamela's claims further, she takes the envelope from Bo and hands it to Jared and tells him her business card is included in case he has any questions for her.  As Clint and Bo continue to express doubt, an upset Natalie interjects that everyone should accept the fact that that Jared is Asa's son.  Before leaving, Pamela tells Jared that Asa obviously wanted \"their\" child to be accepted into the Buchanan family.  Pamela leaves the Buchanans in complete shock.  Sarah announces that she has a date and asks that the board meeting continue.  Jared gives the board his profitable proposal to sell the vineyard and Nash offers his objections.  When Clint asks for the board to vote, Jessica nervously votes in favor of Jared.  A disgusted Nash immediately bolts from the room and Jessica runs after him.  Out in the hall, Jessica begs for Nash to understand her position but Nash tells his wife that she betrayed him and leaves.  Meanwhile back inside the board room, the rest of the Buchanans vote against Jared's proposal.  Jared cannot believe the outcome.  Before leaving, Natalie tells him that he lost as well as the entire family.  Bo warns Jared that there will be repercussions if he learns that Jared is lying and leaves him alone in the board room.  As Jared sits alone, Pamela enters the room.  Pamela smiles lovingly at Jared. She hugs him and tells him how great it is to see him after all these years.  Jared is at a loss for words.\n\n\nAn upset Todd arrives at Llanfair and questions why Viki is not pressing charges against Marcie for holding her hostage.  Viki wonders why Todd is not at home with Sam after being away from him for so long.  Todd demands to know why Viki would allow Marcie to get away with hurting his family.  Viki tells Todd that Marcie has suffered enough and he should focus on having Sam and not on vengeance.  Viki expresses to Todd that what Marcie did was wrong, but she believes Marcie saved the child's life by taking him into her home and Todd should understand that.   Todd continues to try to convince Viki to change her mind, but Viki refuses.  Todd lashes out at Viki and tells her that this is not the first time she has turned against him--he reminds her that Miles Lawrence is residing in her guest house.  Viki tells Todd she loves him and is doing this for Sam and not Marcie.  Viki says if Sam is ever going to have a chance at a normal life, the adults around him are going to need to grow up and learn to forgive.\n\n\nSarah panics when she returns home and finds Layla is not there. She has no idea what she will wear for her date with Cristian.  When Cris arrives at Sarah's apartment, she yells for him to come in.  He enters and finds Sarah nowhere in sight.  Moments later she appears wearing a seductive evening dress. Cris is pleasantly surprised.  Pamela tells Jared she thought of him often but only has memories of the shy little nine-year-old boy she last saw. She tells him how proud his mother would have been.  Jared tells Pamela he appreciates her doing this for him.  He knows how shocked she must have been when Bo contacted her. He cannot believe she came to Llanview and lied to the Buchanans without knowing what he was involved in.  Pamela tells Jared she knows him and reminds him that she told him she would always do anything to help him.  Jared tells her she does not owe him anything.  Pamela feels she does, considering what her brother once did to his family.  As Jared attempts to explain how things unfolded, Pamela tells him she does not need any details and would never judge him.  Jared promises her a share of his inheritance.  Pamela quickly explains that it's about the Buchanan name, not the money.  Before she leaves, Jared asks her if she really believes that.  Pamela explains that he will figure it all out and tells him to keep in touch.  Jessica catches up with an angry Nash.  Nash is disgusted that Jessica sold him out in front of her entire family.  Nash tells her that Jared is Asa's son and the game is over.  Jessica believes Jared is lying and still feels Tess can prove it.  Nash tells Jessica she has gone too far.  Lindsay tells R.J. that Bo has been good to her, and he reminds her that one slip can put her on trial for murder. Lindsay asks R.J. to leave before Bo returns home.  As Lindsay and R.J. share a hug goodbye, Bo walks in and finds them in an embrace.  He does not look pleased. \n\n\n",
