    "soap_central": "\n Like a Bridge Over Troubled Daughter\n\n\nBursting into Marty's office at Llanview Hospital, Todd proclaimed, \"I need you.\" He added that he wanted Marty's help with his daughter. Marty misunderstood at first, since she thought that Todd meant Starr, but he clarified it quickly. He wanted Marty with him when he and T\u00e9a met with Danielle because he wanted Danielle to know about the real him. Sarcastically, Marty asked if he wanted his daughter to meet the woman he had raped. \"Yes,\" Todd replied almost cheerfully.\n\n\nHe wanted Marty to \"step up\" for him for all that he had done to make things up to her. He thought that Danielle could visit Marty's office and see how well she'd done and how she had been able to get past everything. Marty declared emphatically that she had not forgiven Todd and would never forgive him for anything. Todd wanted Danielle to know that he hadn't ruined Marty's life and she had been able to move on.\n\n\nScornfully, Marty hissed that she had been civil to Todd only for the sake of their children and granddaughter, but she didn't trust him or like him. She tolerated him, but she was unable to make things better just because he wanted her to. Todd tried a different tack and suggested that Marty just talk about herself. Marty declined. She was extremely angry and yelled that she didn't owe Todd anything.\n\n\nJohn ran into Natalie sitting outside of Marty's office and gave her a big hug. Natalie admitted that she was upset and angry, and recognized that she had to do something about the way she had been feeling. She realized that she was spending all of her time thinking about Mitch and how much she hated him. She was obsessive and thought she would take Marty up on her offer to talk about it. She didn't have an appointment because she wasn't sure she was ready to talk, Natalie confessed. She asked John why he was there, and he replied that Marty had forgotten her lunch.\n\n\nLooking down to his hands, Natalie noted that John didn't have a brown paper bag with him. He laughed and suggested that he was taking Marty out to lunch. Natalie had another idea, and she guessed that John was working on a case. He reminded her that he was no longer a cop, but she pointed out that he was \"once a cop, always a cop.\"  John agreed that he thought the most about stopping Mitch who still had his private nurse on his payroll. Natalie realized that the real reason for John's visit to the hospital was to try to find information on Mitch's nurse.\n\n\nShe offered to help John sneak around as he played detective and asked him if he thought it was a bad idea for her to speak to Marty. She noted that Marty hadn't been thrilled to see John and Natalie together. John assured her that Marty was fine with it, and Natalie agreed that she and John were good friends.\n\n\nStarr and Cole struggled to pull a large box into their apartment. Cole thought that Todd would be upset to find out that Starr had used her birthday money to purchase a playhouse for Hope. Starr disagreed and thought that Todd would clearly understand. \"His kids always come first,\" she pointed out. As the young couple assembled the house, they talked about Todd. Cole was worried about Todd's role in Hope's life and promised that he would always have his daughter's back. Starr thought that while Todd had done some horrible things in his life, he could also be sweet. That was the reason that she kept forgiving him.\n\n\nTheir talk turned to their friends, and Cole was certain that Markko and Langston were cramped and unhappy in the apartment with all of them living together. Starr was convinced that the couple's unhappiness might be due to some other issues. She cited the musical that Langston had wanted to write about Starr and Cole. The couple named the differences and similarities between their story and Shakespeare's  Romeo and Juliet. Starr was sure they would have a happy ending, unlike the famous Shakespearean couple. She put her arms around Cole and suggested that they skip her birthday party at Capricorn. Cole thought they had to attend, with so many people on the guest list, but noted that they could probably be a \"little late.\"\n\n\nA distracted Charlie was oblivious as Viki directed her comments towards him at Llanfair. As he looked over some blueprints, he received a phone call from Dorian, who wanted to see him at the \"sleazy bar\" they had met at once before. She asked him to do the \"right thing.\" Charlie advised Viki that he needed to meet with a client and he left. Noticeably regretting her choice, Viki grabbed her coat and followed her husband.\n\n\nAs Brody prepared to leave for work, he stooped to pick up an envelope that someone had slid under the front door. It was addressed to Jessica from her father. Brody wasn't happy about Jessica's desire to see it, but they read it together. Mitch apologized for upsetting Jessica's family, but he had merely wanted to see her. He bad-mouthed Brody and called him insensitive, untrustworthy, and predictable. He assured his daughter that her relationship with the \"beast of burden\" wouldn't last. He knew Jessica and was part of her, he wrote. He was willing to forgive her for trying to kill him, but she would have to accept him as her father. He promised to stay away from her family if she would meet him at the docks.\n\n\nBrody insisted that Mitch was lying, and he pleaded with Jessica to stay away from the man. He had arranged to have one of his fellow police officers, Jason, guard the house. Jessica felt obligated to meet with Mitch, but Brody attempted to make her understand that Mitch just wanted to get her alone. He grabbed the letter, with the intention to make a case against Mitch at the police station. He was sure that the letter was a tactic and told Jessica that Mitch is \"working you.\"\n\n\nJessica wanted to kill Mitch for criticizing Brody, and she stressed that she loved Brody. She hated Mitch and she apologized for dealing with him. Brody emphasized that he loved Jessica and that Clint was her father, not Mitch.\n\n\nBoth Rachel and T\u00e9a returned to Rachel's apartment and were dismayed to find that Danielle was gone. Finally, they glimpsed the laptop with windows open to articles about Todd. T\u00e9a was frantic. She realized that her daughter had learned about Todd on her own, and T\u00e9a was worried about the repercussions.\n\n\nDanielle and Matthew sat at the docks as Matthew listened to his friend lament the fact that Todd was her real father. She acknowledged that she didn't want to meet her father, \"the rapist.\" She related all of the facts that she had learned about Todd since researching his life on the Internet. She thought that if she were Cole, she'd kill Todd for what Todd had done to Cole's mother. She refused to allow Todd to be her father and wondered how he could be anyone's father.\n\n\nDanielle tightly clutched the papers she had printed out about Todd's life and Matthew gently took them from her. She advised him that she wanted to go back to Tahiti, though he reminded her that there was nothing there for her any longer. He thought that she needed to deal with Todd because it was a fact that wouldn't go away. He told her that the worst thing to happen would be that her mother would ship her off to boarding school again. If that happened, Matthew would miss her, he said sadly.\n\n\nSuddenly Matthew's phone rang. Rachel was calling to ask if he had seen Danielle. Matthew played dumb and told his sister that he didn't even know about Danielle and T\u00e9a returning to Llanview. He told Danielle that her mother was worried, and Danielle and T\u00e9a needed to talk to each other. Danielle stressed that she couldn't talk to her mother or anyone else, but Matthew had an idea. He knew of someone who would understand Danielle's plight.\n\n\nCharlie met with Dorian at the bar and advised her that the rest of his life would be ruined if he killed Mitch. She countered that his life would be ruined if he continued to drink. She urged him to kill Mitch for Viki, and she tenderly unwrapped a gun that she removed from her purse. She explained that the gun couldn't be traced, and she stressed that he had to do it.\n\n\nWhen the waitress approached their table, Dorian stopped Charlie from ordering a drink, but she ordered a second one for herself. Nervously, she reasoned that the drinking helped to steady her nerves, though normally she only drank socially. Dorian told Charlie that she felt dirty in the bar and excused herself to freshen up in the ladies' room. Viki walked through the front door and spied Charlie with the empty glass in front of him.\n\n\nThe waitress returned with Dorian's drink and Charlie flashed back to his encounters with Mitch, who called him a drunk. He remembered how Mitch had taunted him. Viki lightly tapped him on the shoulder and Charlie returned to the present. \"You followed me?\" he asked in disbelief. She apologized and explained that it was the only thing she could think of. She accused him of lying to her about meeting a client. They began to argue about her lack of trust. She insisted that she understood his pain but assured him that drinking wouldn't help, even though Charlie attempted to make it clear that he wasn't drinking. She pointed to the drink on the table and asked him to explain.\n\n\nCharlie asked for Viki's trust and suggested she head home. In order to appease her, he asked her if she wanted him to admit that he was drinking again. She insisted that she wanted to help him, but again he told her to go home. He complained that his meetings and prayer didn't help him. He wouldn't go with her. He urged her to forget about him because he couldn't be what she needed him to be. Dorian returned from the ladies' room but spied Viki and remained out of sight.\n\n\nCharlie firmly told Viki that he had something to settle, and he didn't want her to be mixed up in it. She wanted to help him because they were married and they had promised for better or worse, Viki began. Charlie gruffly stated that he had broken promises before. A dismayed Viki told her husband that her heart was broken. She left the bar. Dorian returned to the table and apologized to Charlie. He had decided that he would kill Mitch, Charlie informed her.\n\n\nTodd received a call from T\u00e9a while he was in Marty's office and learned that Danielle was missing. He stormed out of the office. Marty saw John and Natalie and told them it was \"Todd's just being Todd\" when they asked if everything was okay. She wanted to know what John and Natalie were doing there. \"I assume it's not for couples' counseling,\" she said jokingly. Natalie quickly assured Marty that Natalie and John had run into each other. Natalie was thinking about taking Marty up on her offer of help. Marty welcomed Natalie into the office. John kissed Marty goodbye and they promised to see each other later on.\n\n\nTodd showed up at Rachel's place and tried to blame her for leaving Danielle unsupervised. T\u00e9a strongly informed him that it was not Rachel's fault and, pointing to the laptop, informed Todd that Danielle had taken it upon herself to learn about Todd. T\u00e9a had checked the history of pages searched and she was sure that Danielle knew everything. Upset, Todd sat down. He would have made Danielle see that he was no longer the same person as the one in the news. It was obvious to him that Danielle would not want to know him. \"It's over,\" he muttered\n\n\nAs Cole and Starr embraced, there was a knock at the door. They were surprised to find Matthew with a girl, and Starr wondered if he was there for Cole. Matthew said no and introduced Starr and Danielle to each other. Starr cheerfully stated that she had recognized Danielle because her father had a picture of the girl. Before Starr could continue, Matthew told the girls that they were sisters. Starr opened her mouth but closed it again quickly. She looked shocked but not very surprised.\n\n\nJessica called the police station and asked to speak to Brody, but he was not there. He had not reported for work. Concerned, she called John and asked him for help. Outside, Jason stood on guard duty. Nurse Charles crept up behind him and plunged a syringe into him.\n\n\nAs Mitch sat at the docks and read his Scriptures out loud, Brody sneaked up on him and grabbed him from behind.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Mitch writes Jessica a letter asking her to meet him on the docks and promising to leave Viki, Charlie and Natalie alone if she does so. Brody does not want her to do it and warns her. He then goes off to find Mitch. Meanwhile, Charlie secretly meets with Dorian and she persuades him to take a gun and kill Mitch. Viki finds him and is worried that he will drink again. He does not tell her what he is doing and asks her to stay away from him until he \"fixes\" things. Dani does an internet search on Todd Manning and finds about the rape of Marty Saybrooke and all of Todd's shady history. She leaves and goes to the docks alone. Tea and Rachel don't know where to find her or how to deal with how she's found out this information regarding Todd this way. Matthew finds her. She informs him what she has just found out, wants nothing to do with Todd and remarks that Marty's son has good reason to want to kill Todd. Right then, Matthew takes Dani to meet Starr and Cole so that she can meet Todd's daughter (her sister) and Marty's son.",
