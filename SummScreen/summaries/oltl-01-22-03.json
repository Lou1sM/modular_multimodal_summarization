Sam is positive that he shook the person off so at first Blair agrees to stay.  She appears uneasy when Sam holds her and promises to keep her safe all night.  Blair is a million miles away when Sam calls her back to reality.  She feels bad that he went to so much trouble but she's worried about an awful lot going on.  Sam calls her bluff when she begins to cry that she can't be with him and he wonders if it's because of Todd.  Blair admits it's true as she tells him about their earlier kiss.  She feels obligated to tell Sam everything and maybe if the situation were normal they would be alright together.  She asks Sam to wait for her but he's not confident he'll come out a winner.  He understands that Todd is part of her life and that she can't change things even if she wants to.  She wants to love Sam, she moans.  He needs her to love him without having to try.  She doesn't want to end it but Sam thinks it's for the best.\n\n\nTodd has called Shawna and invited her over, planning to get her lipstick on a wineglass.  When someone is at the door, he assumes it's her but it's Viki who's come to tell him that Jess has gone.  She also wants to thank him for saving Jess from Mitch and wants him to just let his problem with Mitch go for now.  Shawna arrives and an amused Viki looks on as Todd hands her a glass of wine, grabs it from her after she drinks it and tells her to leave.  Shawna can't believe how weird Todd is as she heads out.  Viki realizes that Todd is trying to make Blair jealous though he denies it.  Viki then gets him to admit that he loves Blair.  She suggests he tell her or show her and quit playing stupid games.  Viki receives a call from Bo and leaves, but not before telling her brother that she wants him to be happy and doesn't want to lose him.  She hugs him and he does the same, awkwardly. \n\n\nLiz and R.J. reconnect and she asks him to stay.  Making their way to the bedroom, they recall their past.  He pulls away from their embrace when he spies Steven's wedding ring and asks her if she's ready for this new relationship.  She'd like to be with him, she replies, but she's not sure.\n\n\nLindsay and Troy are in the middle of a kiss when Nora calls and leaves a message that prompts the doctor to pull away abruptly.  He tells Lindsay that he won't sleep with her tonight.  He wonders what Lindsay has on R.J. since the man won't tell on her; Lindsay advises him that R.J. has something on him now and she's sorry for telling about their affair but she was excited.  The doctor assumes that eventually he'll be able to find something to use on her to end this situation but she imagines differently.  Underneath the nice outside, he's after whatever he wants and he can only be himself when he's with her, she cautions him.  He reminds her that he's only sleeping with her because of Nora.  Again, Lindsay sees another side and tells him that Nora doesn't know the real him, he's really like her and she's not letting go.  She will never judge him.  Declaring that he doesn't want to be with her and that he's just doing what he has to in order to shut her up, he walks out of his office.  When Emily wanders in looking for her brother, she finds Lindsay instead.  She orders her to stay away from Troy.  Lindsay wonders aloud if that's what Troy really wants.  It's not, she tells Em.\n\n\nAt the police station, Nora learns that Carlotta will be ok and that Allison has been transferred to Statesville.  Hank is positive that Allison and Mitch are behind what looks like a murder attempt.  He urges Nora to get home to Troy.  She confides that there seems to be something fishy going on with Lindsay; she's claiming that R.J. is her new boyfriend.  Hank certainly doesn't buy it, especially with the way that he's seen R.J. look at Liz and proposes that they're up to something.  \n\n\nNat offers to sleep with Mitch but doesn't want Cris to know about it.  It's a one-time offer, she advises him, for his witness to see.  Then she wants her divorce.  Mitch hesitates but is interrupted by Bo, who has come looking for Natalie.  Mitch advises Bo that his wife is there by choice but Bo figures it's probably because Mitch has threatened her.  He assures Nat that Carlotta is fine and Mitch feigns surprise at hearing what has happened to her.  Bo is well aware that Mitch is behind the latest goings-on and though he has no proof yet, they are working on it.  He knows the reason Nat is there is because of Mitch's trying to get at her through Cris but he's taking her out.  Nat tries to get rid of Bo as Mitch denies all knowledge of anything that Bo is talking about.  Mitch suggests that Nat leave with Bo but behind his back he motions to her to keep quiet.\n\n\nHanks advises Nora to worry about her wedding instead and not R.J. and Lindsay.  When Troy arrives, he tells her he just wants to get home.  Viki also arrives at the police station and learns that Nat was upset about Carlotta but she promises to stay away from Mitch from now on.  When Viki checks in with Bo to thank him for getting Nat, he informs her that he believes Nat was there to bargain with Mitch.  Nat receives a phone call from her husband and he warns her that he can get anyone to get to Cris, maybe even a guard.  They'll meet tomorrow and he will make her his wife in every sense of the word.\n\n\nAfter Liz and R.J. make love, they decide it's definitely better than it was in their early years.  He's become grown up, he announces while she tells him that this time around she'd tell him about their daughter.  He wants to make it up to her, he pleads and wants to help with the new baby.  Will she make her life with him?  She gives him a resounding no.\n\n\nBlair and Sam return to the penthouse where she still insists she wants to be with him, nice guy that he is.
