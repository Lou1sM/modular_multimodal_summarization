She throws a minor fit and declares that the messy apartment is all Layla's fault, but Cris reminds her that they used to live together. She admits it's all her mess, that she's a slob and a difficult person. She's wearing Layla's dress to impress him and she's very nervous about their date. She's used to dating rockers, not guys with steady jobs and places to live. Cris discloses that he's not scared off by her but is nervous too. They both confess to thinking about each other when they were at the Palace with different people. They head to the hotel for dinner. \n\n\nBo walks in on R.J. and Lindsay embracing. They part quickly and Lindsay explains that R.J. was just leaving after stopping by to see how she was. Bo advises his competitor that if he's there to cause trouble, he'll be banished from Lindsay's life forever. Lindsay walks R.J. out and asks him again not to say a word to anyone about what he's figured out. R.J. is pretty sure that Bo will eventually catch on to Lindsay's act. He just doesn't think she belongs with him. Bo says he's sorry for being upset but he's figured it out and wants the truth. Lindsay is startled until he merely asks if something is going on with R.J. She is quick to tell him no, that they are only friends, despite their previous relationship. He was there with custody of Jamie at the same time she lost Jen, so it had all fit into place. She's no longer interested in him, but needs to trust someone and he accepts her as she is. Bo points out that it used to be the two of them. Lindsay doesn't think that necessarily means that they would get together again. \"No, it doesn't,\" Bo responds. He also mentions that he's not concerned with Clint and Nora. Lindsay offers to buy him dinner and they head for the Palace. \n\n\nAt the Palace, Clint gives Nora a warm kiss hello. She hears about Pamela's visit and Clint mentions how it's a bad day for Bo. Nora believes Bo is uncomfortable that she and Clint are seeing each other but Clint disagrees. She tells him that he's a man and so would never pick up on it. She only relates to Bo because of Matthew, and if Bo has feelings about something, then Matthew would, too. She in turn doesn't like that Bo and Lindsay are together, though she insists she's not jealous. Clint admits that Dorian was always forbidden so that's what started his relationship with her, as well as that with Lindsay. Both woman also knew how to get under his skin. His kids didn't like it, and therefore he understands her thoughts about Matthew. Nora herself is nervous and uncomfortable but says she feels like she can be herself around Clint. She thinks that Matthew will be fine. Nora and Clint engage in a public display of affection but decide they really shouldn't be doing that. Cris and Sarah arrive for dinner and stop by the table to chat for a minute. They sit at their own table and proceed to ask each other questions to get to know each other better. Cris asks about Sarah's being a vegetarian and she asks him where he'd be if he could go anywhere. His answer of \"here\" makes her smile. She discloses that she's been working on song lyrics since she's been so happy. Bo and Lindsay arrive and when they are advised that there won't be a table for quite some time, Clint asks them to join him and Nora. \n\n\nJared tosses objects around his room, furious at the way things transpired at the board meeting. Nigel wonders if it's a celebration. Nigel confesses that he's uncomfortable, and says if Jared doesn't tell everyone the truth, then he will. He is sure the Buchanans will forgive him because he wanted to keep them from David Vickers. He points out that now Jared has neither love nor money and he thinks he should go for the love. Jared threatens to go to David himself if Nigel opens his mouth. Jared says he'll be getting over Nat and will date others. Nigel tells him to clean up the room himself. \n\n\nNash shares his displeasure with Jess over her siding with Jared. She knew her family would all vote against Jared, she insists. She still wants to pretend to be Tess so that she can expose Jared's fraud, and the only way she can do that is to side with him. She knows that Pamela was lying, and Tess is the one who can bring Jared down. Nash cannot get over the feeling that it's dangerous for her to do this and even suggests she's happy about playing Tess, because her life with him is boring. Jess takes offense at this and tries to make him understand how happy she is and how much she loves him. Nash figures out that Jared has already asked her to have sex with him, but she insists she won't let him touch her. Nash is afraid of the consequences. He's still angry over being made to look like a fool in front of her family since they are not aware of what Jess is doing. He's also afraid of what Jared will do when he finds out that Jess is merely playing with him. He wonders if Jared might force the sex next time. She tries to apologize for hurting him but she is steadfast in her desire to be Tess one more time. He storms off, complaining that she has no respect for him. When Nash is gone, Jess calls Jared and asks to see him. \n\n\nNat visits Roxy at the hair salon for some mood uplifting. She's still down about Jared and swears she's not interested in Miles. Roxy sits her in the chair for a manicure and tries to give her some solid advice. \"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,\" she quips, bringing some much needed cheer to Nat's life. Roxy decides the way to go would be an online dating service, but she's unable to find anyone to meet Nat's needs. The guys Roxy finds in her search are definitely \"too not Jared.\" A little later, Nash shows up and asks Roxy for a drink. He says he feels that his life is spinning out of control. Roxy is in the \"mother mode\" and is ready to listen. \n\n\nWhen Jess shows up to see Jared, he's waiting for her -- in bed.\n\n\n",

Nash and Jessica argue over the fact that Jessica had voted for Jared against him. Nash begins to believe that Tess has come out in control again. Nigel tells Jared if he doesn't tell the Buchanans who he really is then he will. R. J. pays Lindsay a visit at Bo's. Bo comes home and catches R.J. there. Bo orders R.J. out. Cristian and Sarah prepare to go on their date. Natalie has a talk with Roxy concerning Jared and Natalie's love for him. Nora meets Clint at the Palace dining room for dinner.
