    "soap_central": "\n My Sister, My Daughter \n\n\nWith Shane gone for the evening, Rex presented Gigi with a romantic date, filled with candles, wine, and frozen crab cakes he heated himself. He expressed his love, his happiness at their finding each other, and his gratefulness that Shane was his son. \n\n\nT\u00e9a found a depressed Todd mooning over a picture of Marty. She gave him a tongue-lashing for his presumed inactivity and apathy, while she in turn was doing all she could to keep him out of jail. She was further enraged when she saw that the picture was not of Marty, but Blair. Todd insisted that he was looking at his kids, also in the picture, not Blair. He admitted to seeing his sons earlier, which did nothing to calm T\u00e9a's mood. She accused him of violating his restraining order as his trial was about to start. She felt sure that Blair had set a trap in some way. \n\n\nTodd also admitted to running into Starr at the cemetery. As Todd stood by his belief that he was responsible for the baby's death, T\u00e9a demanded to know if he had admitted that to his daughter. He planned the kidnapping so he was responsible, he emphasized. T\u00e9a was worried that Todd would ruin his day in court and she began to cry. Todd mentioned that Starr told him how difficult it was to hate him and T\u00e9a solemnly agreed. Todd asked her to stay and the pair pulled out an old board game they had played in the past. T\u00e9a wanted a rematch but warned Todd there were no \"do-overs\" either in the game or in life. She confirmed that she was his friend and attorney and was confident he'd get away with his latest scheme as long as Janet Ketring/Lee Halpern was not found. \n\n\nJohn visited Blair at La Boulaie, where she confided that she was extremely upset not only to have found him kissing Marty, but also that he hadn't come to her aid when she and Marty had argued. She further added that she was not in love with Todd as Marty had suggested and that he was merely the father of her children. Confirming that he believed her, John admitted that he hadn't thought his aid was necessary and he believed that Blair was quite capable of taking care of herself. He wondered what Blair was afraid of. \n\n\nBlair demanded to know why John put up with Marty kissing him. His response took her by surprise. He wanted to know why Blair had a restraining order against Todd if she was only going to allow him to see his kids anyway. A stuttering Blair explained that her sons missed their dad, while John made excuses for Marty's behavior. He pointed out that Marty's behavior was all a result of other people's actions. He emphasized that Marty had kissed him, but that he wanted to kiss Blair. She admitted to being jealous of Marty and didn't want her anywhere near John. As John began to kiss her, she weakly fought him off. They headed upstairs. \n\n\nMarty accompanied Wes back to his place and disclosed that she was confused over her behavior with John. Wes thought she should not worry about her past behavior but start fresh. She turned her attentions to Wes, noting the change in his usual easy-going behavior. He was drinking and seemed on edge. \n\n\nWes confessed that he had distorted the truth in Iraq to protect Brody, but had decided to tell him the true story. He told her that the war was never over for him. He likened his lying to Todd's, though Marty was quick to jump to Wes's defense. She called him heroic in protecting his friend's soul, while Todd was only protecting himself when he told her lies. Taking it a step further, Marty professed Wes to be her guardian angel and a good person by taking her under his wing. Telling her that she didn't have to stick around, Marty advised him that she preferred to look after him, the way he did for her. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Jessica filled Brody in on her trip back to the cottage and her discovery, from Bess, that she had planned on killing Natalie and Jared. Brody found it hard to believe, even though he'd only known Jessica for a short time. Jessica declared that she didn't know herself, and found it impossible for anyone else to know her either. Brody felt that Jessica couldn't be held responsible. In turn, he divulged the results of his visit with Wes, when he learned that the dead Iraqi boy was holding nothing more than a flashlight. \n\n\nBrody admitted that he still felt guilty and Jessica admitted the same. She was sure that Natalie would never forgive her and she didn't fault Natalie for those feelings. Brody hoped that things would eventually work out for both of them. \n\n\nAt Llanview, Natalie informed Viki that she was sick of her mother making excuses for Jessica, especially since they learned of her sister wanting Natalie dead. A confused Charlie thought that Tess had been responsible for that, but it was explained that Jessica controlled the personalities, she knew what was going on, and refused to confide in anyone. Viki continued to defend Jessica, bringing Natalie to angry tears. She noted that her parents did not support her until she was found prisoner in the secret room, but they always supported Jessica. \n\n\nViki adamantly continued to defend Jessica, pointing out that it was Tess who did terrible things. Natalie reiterated that Jessica knew and pulled the gun, and that Tess was merely the trigger. Viki disclosed that Tess was about to let Jared and Natalie out of the room when she went into labor. Natalie refused to buy it and suggested that her mother would still feel sorry for Jessica, even if she had successfully blown them up. Viki agreed, but felt that Natalie was lucky. She was alive and could express her feelings and be productive. Refusing to discuss Jessica any longer, Natalie admitted to being tired of always having to be the strong one. Viki asked her if she wanted to trade places with Jessica. \n\n\nViki pointed out that life was not fair for either Natalie or Jessica, but she loved Natalie very much and would do anything for her. She praised her for getting angry but always having the ability to forgive people. Calling her a role model, Viki suggested that Natalie would be able to forgive Jessica when she understood that Jessica wasn't responsible. Bringing some firewood into the house, Jared told Charlie that he preferred that Jessica blame him for Nash's death, because he was worried about Natalie. Jared followed a distressed Natalie upstairs early. Charlie felt that Natalie would get over her feelings in time. Viki hoped that Jessica would successfully integrate her personalities, but was worried that it would cost her sister. \n\n\nAs Jon McLaughlin sang \"We All Need Saving\" there was a montage of scenes. T\u00e9a and Todd played their game, while Gigi and Rex, and Blair and John made love. Marty covered up a sleeping Wes and kept watch over him while Jess and Brody looked at personal photos. As Jared slept soundly, Natalie lay awake, lost in thought. Charlie tried to cheer up a contemplative Viki.\n\n\n",
