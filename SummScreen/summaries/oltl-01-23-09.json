    "soap_central": "\nThe Tao of David\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr, Langston, and Addie heard a strange clamor coming from the living room and decided to investigate.  They discovered Dorian dressed in a robe and conducting what appeared to be a religious ceremony.   Dorian announced that she had instructed Moe to prepare a special meal for the guests that she had invited over to join her in the Buddhist Day of Observance.  When the Cramer women expressed their concern over Dorian's weird behavior, she stated that David's influence had caused her transformation and encouraged her family to join her on the path toward enlightenment.  As the family sought answers from her, Dorian ushered in a large group of homeless people to attend the services.  At Dorian's insistence, Starr, Langston, and Addie left her to her own devices.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Carlotta and Noelle listened as David gave them a lesson on love and humility. Carlotta was suspicious of David's true intentions, but Noelle sought his advice.  Concerned by a past statement that Madame Delphina had made, Noelle wondered what David saw concerning her future.  When David criticized the ability of all psychics, an angered Madame Delphina approached and suggested that he was concocting a scam.  The psychic stated that David could experience a life of wealth if he gave up his ridiculous charade, but David assured her that he didn't desire material wealth and walked away.\n\n\nAlone with Madame Delphina, Noelle asked the psychic to clarify her past statement \u2013 \"Go back to Texas before it's too late!\"  Madame Delphina warned that great danger was on the arisen \u2013 but not for Noelle.  Advising Noelle that great wealth was in store for her, Madame cautioned that money caused corruption.  An amazed Noelle remembered that David had given her the same warning.  She wondered how she would obtain the great wealth that Madame Delphina had prophesied.  \n\n\nDorian asked her guests to join her in a chant, but was startled when an enraged David appeared and accused her of committing blasphemy.  Reminding David that he had advised her to serve others, Dorian argued that she was following his instructions.  David remarked that Dorian had no idea of what it meant to live the life that he had chosen.  He urged her to publicly relinquish all material possessions to someone that wasn't related to her.  After a brief struggle, Dorian exclaimed, \"I Dorian Lord give all my earthly possessions to Maurice Stubbs!\"  Moe stared at her in disbelief.\n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio and Talia listened as Bo and Nora advised Janet to give them the proof that they needed to convict Todd of attempting to kidnap Starr's baby.  A confident Janet assured them that she had evidence that would put Todd away for a long time.  Janet stated that Todd had forced her to help him kidnap the baby.  She said that she possessed the fake credentials that he had provided her to gain access into the delivery room in order to carry out his devious plan.  When a smug Janet displayed the fraudulent materials and suggested that they offer her a deal, Bo and Nora informed her that they needed more.\n\n\nTodd woke up and was surprised to find T\u00e9a asleep in his bed.  T\u00e9a announced that they had slept together.  Explaining that they had fallen asleep while watching television, T\u00e9a informed Todd that they didn't have sex.  Pleased that Todd was in a good mood, T\u00e9a suggested that they discuss the upcoming trial.  T\u00e9a stated that Nora's only evidence was Starr's testimony.  She was certain that Todd would win the case because Nora had been unable to obtain any other witnesses.  As T\u00e9a prepared to leave, Todd smiled and remarked, \"Thanks for sleeping with me.\"\n\n\nTodd was startled when he returned to his bedroom and found Janet. When Todd demanded to know why she was in his home, Janet insisted that he pay her for her silence.  She promised to give a statement to the police unless he provided her with financial support.  Meanwhile, Antonio and Talia sat in a van outside of Todd's house and recorded the entire conversation.  \n\n\nJanet rehashed Todd's kidnapping plan in great detail.  As Janet tried to talk him into a confession, a suspicious Todd grabbed her and tore open her blouse, exposing the wire that Janet was wearing.\n\n\nBack at the police station, Bo and Nora discussed the change in behavior that Matthew was undergoing.  While Bo wondered what had gone wrong, Nora argued that Matthew was a teenager and was expected to test his parents in some way.  Bo vowed that he wouldn't lose his son to drugs.\n\n\nAt Llanview High School, Starr told Langston that she wouldn't speak with Cole if she discovered that he was high again.  Nearby, an obviously drugged Cole fumbled with the bag of pills in his locker.  Matthew approached and inquired about the pills, but Cole lied and said that they were aspirin.  Matthew began bragging about meeting up with Becca at Ultraviolet.  To his surprise, Becca was standing behind him.  The two walked off and left Cole at his locker holding his drugs.   Upon noticing Starr and Langston, Cole stashed the pills back in his locker.  \n\n\nStarr approached Cole and realized that he was still high.  When an angered Starr chastised him about his addiction to the pills, Cole lashed out at her and accused Starr of trying to control him.  He insisted that he needed her friendship and criticized her for refusing to talk to him.  Starr held her ground and told Cole that she had no intention of being his friend as long as he remained on drugs.  \n\n\nA few feet away, Matthew assured Becca that he could handle his parents and that his punishment wouldn't last long.  Another student joined them and began teasing Matthew about his lack of knowledge of drugs.  As the bell rang, Becca suggested that Matthew head to class before he found himself in more trouble.   Matthew watched as Starr and Cole continued to argue.  Fed up with Cole's denial, Starr stormed off.  A distracted and frustrated Cole slammed his locker door but didn't realize that he hadn't locked it.  After Cole walked away, Matthew opened the locker and removed the bag of pills.\n\n\nAt Cris's loft, Vanessa confronted Lola about the letter that she had received from her father.  She warned the teen that Ray was dangerous and would kill them both if Lola decided to trust him.  Instructing Lola to hand over the letter, Vanessa insisted that she wanted to show the document to Cris.  Vanessa was certain that Cris would want to present the evidence to the authorities.  Appearing conflicted, Lola gave Vanessa the letter and informed her step-mother that she had an errand to run.  When Cris arrived, moments later, Vanessa quickly hid the letter and sent him upstairs.  Believing that she was alone, Vanessa retrieved the letter and lit a match to it.  As she watched the letter burn, Cris appeared and demanded to know what she was doing.  Admitting that the letter was from Ray, Vanessa told Cris that she was afraid to show him the letter because she feared that Ray would harm them all.  Cris vowed to protect Vanessa but insisted that she be honest with him.  Giving him a big hug, Vanessa promised to be truthful with Cris.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Lola met at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.  T\u00e9a told Lola that her school records had arrived from Colombia and that she was able to enroll in Llanview High.  Sensing that the teen was troubled, T\u00e9a asked if she were all right.  Reminding Lola that she was her lawyer, T\u00e9a informed Lola that a lawyer couldn't divulge any information that a client provided.  Lola confided in T\u00e9a that she had received a letter from her father.  When T\u00e9a asked if there was anything about the case that Lola was withholding, Lola confessed that she wasn't certain that her father killed her mother.\n\n\n\n\n",
