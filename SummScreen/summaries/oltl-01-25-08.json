When Adriana mentions she and Rex recently met a Charlie Balsom, Viki quickly dismisses the idea that Charlie B would be living in Llanview. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica is horrified to discover she has been admitted to St. Ann's. She begins banging on the door screaming, \"I'm Jessica.\" Dr. Bonner informs Jessica that she has been placed on restricted access and may possibly be released in the spring, if she responds to treatment. He reminds Jessica of the paperwork she signed agreeing to be committed to St. Ann's if Tess ever surfaced again. Jessica attempts to convince Dr. Bonner that she was pretending to be Tess, to no avail. She becomes combative and demands that the doctor rescind her earlier request. When Dr. Bonner leaves to get her a sedative, Jessica retrieves her cell phone and calls her mother.\n\n\nWhile Viki is speaking with Rex and Adriana, she receives Jessica's alarming call. Jessica quickly tells her mother she has been taken to St. Ann's, but before she can explain, Dr. Bonner appears and takes her cell phone. Viki excuses herself and heads to St. Ann's. Once Viki leaves, Adriana and Rex discuss the strange coincidence - that Viki is looking for a Charlie B and they recently met a gentleman with the same first name and last initial. The conversation is cut short once Rex's Aunt Corrine joins the couple. Conversation quickly turns to the upcoming nuptials. Rex asks Corrine for information concerning their relatives; he would like to invite them to the wedding.

Nash tells Roxy his intentions were to teach Jessica a lesson. He hopes she will come to realize she has been playing a dangerous game involving her mental health. Roxy questions Nash's actions and tells him that in the past, many people have had a difficult time being discharged from St. Ann's. Nash feels Jessica will come to her senses concerning Jared, and she will be released without incident. As Nash leaves to visit Jessica, Miles enters the beauty salon. At first Roxy is not pleased to see Miles, but later warms up to him. She tells him she understands he did not share her same feelings, and the two agree to remain friends. When the conversation turns to Mitch Lawrence, Roxy tells Miles he is an angel but Mitch was the devil. They discuss Natalie's bad luck with men. Roxy tells Miles she believes Natalie will have a difficult time getting over Jared Banks. \n\n\nJared enters Natalie's office at Buchanan Enterprises and requests she hire him. Natalie admits she cannot stop thinking of him but realizes she must learn to. Natalie fears working together would be a huge mistake; she would rather they saw very little of one another. Jared explains that perhaps they could learn to become friends. He believes spending time together at work could accomplish this goal. Jared tells Natalie he is convinced that together they can raise Buchanan Enterprises stock. After much persuasion, Natalie agrees to work with Jared again. As they discuss strategy, Jared leans close. Natalie becomes uncomfortable and immediately realizes that working with Jared will not be an easy task. Jared expresses his need to tell Natalie what he did the night before. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Charlie admits to Dorian that letting Viki go will be difficult for him. Charlie feels torn between lying to Viki and sending Jared to prison. As Charlie contemplates his dilemma, Dorian attempts to convince him that his relationship with Viki is doomed. When Charlie tells Dorian his heart will always be with Viki, Dorian tells him that Viki received a heart transplant from her late husband, Ben. Dorian explains that Viki is very fragile, and the truth could possibly place her health in danger. After flirting with Charlie, Addie tells Dorian she would like to go to Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven.

I hate you.\" As Todd looks around the room, he sees Sam playing alone on the bed. Todd questions why Blair is screaming at Sam. When Blair responds that she was screaming at Margaret, Todd stares at her in complete shock. Blair admits to seeing Margaret Cochran, ever since Sam came home to live with them. She tells him that Margaret continues to tell her that she will never be able to love Sam. Todd feels she may be hearing Margaret's voice, but he states the thoughts belong to Blair. After much debate, Blair admits she may be seeing Margaret because she has fears about raising Sam. Blair and Todd come to the agreement that the real problem is not about Margaret, but about the two of them. As they discuss their recent marriage, Blair tells Todd if Marcie never stole Sam, they would probably be divorced by now. Todd agrees but sees the bigger picture. Todd notices how Blair treats Sam; he says she shows him the same love she shows Starr and Jack. When Blair expresses her concerns about not being Sam's birth mother, Todd states Margaret is dead and Blair is the only mother Sam has. Todd questions whether Blair wants to end their relationship. \n\n\nBack at St. Ann's, Viki arrives and is shocked to find her daughter a patient at the mental facility. Viki begins questioning Jessica about the events that transpired, but Jessica is not completely truthful. Jessica tells Viki that Nash allowed her to be placed in St. Ann's, but fails to mention her deceptive actions. Nash arrives in time to hear Jessica's explanation, and demands that she tell Viki the truth. Jessica admits to Viki that she has been pretending to be Tess, in an attempt to prove Jared is lying about being Asa's son. Upon learning of her daughter's recent behavior, Viki stuns Jessica by telling Nash that he did the right thing. Viki reminds Jessica that her disorder is not one to fool with. As a nun looks on, Jessica lashes out at Nash for having her locked away. Angrily, Jessica tells her mother she must have her released because she cannot spend another day institutionalized. When Jessica tells Viki she never came close to relapsing and Viki questions her, Jessica shouts hysterically at her mother. Jessica tells Viki to stop telling her what she does and doesn't know. The terrified look on her mother's face forces Jessica to question whether or not Viki believes she is truly Jessica and not Tess. Instantly, Jessica realizes the hurt she is causing Viki and apologizes. Viki tells her daughter that she knows she is Jessica but is disappointed in her decision to portray Tess, considering the damage it could possibly cause. Viki explains to Jessica her pretense could have resulted in a far more dire result than being admitted to St. Ann's. When Jessica tells Viki that it would have been worth it to prove Jared a liar, Nash becomes enraged. Nash cannot believe his wife-he feels Jessica is justifying her actions. Jessica responds by demanding Nash have her released immediately. Viki attempts to reason with Nash, by telling him Jared is obviously aware of Jessica's scheme and it really makes no sense to have her locked away. When Jessica questions her mother about how long she will stay in the facility, Viki tells her that decision is up to Nash. Lovingly, Nash tells Jessica he never really wanted her placed in St. Ann's but felt he needed to make her realize the error of her ways. Jessica tells Nash to do whatever it takes to have her released. They confess their love for one another and he leaves to sign the paperwork for her release. \n\n\nWhen Dorian and Addie arrive at the hair salon, Addie is delighted to meet Miles. Charlie enters the salon and tells Dorian that he didn't see Jared at the diner. Roxy verbally attacks Charlie when Dorian introduces him and reveals his last name is Balsom. Roxy accuses Charlie of being responsible for Rex's sudden interest in his family's background. Charlie tells Roxy he never meant to cause any problems between her and Rex. Dorian comes to Charlie's defense and explains it is a mere coincidence they share the same last name. Meanwhile, Addie is staring intently at Miles. Addie tells him she is certain she knows him from somewhere. Aunt Corrine refuses to give Rex any information concerning his family. Once Adriana leaves to meet up with Layla, Rex continues to press Corrine for the answers he seeks. When Corrine mentions she must leave for her cruise, Rex threatens her. Rex tells Corrine he is an excellent investigator and will eventually learn the truth. He tells her he will not allow her to leave for the cruise until she reveals the family's secrets. Corrine tells Rex that she is not certain if Walter was really his father. Rex is shocked. \n\n\nJared tells Natalie he has something to tell her and he is anxious to tell her before she hears it from someone else. Seconds later, the phone rings. Nash has information for Natalie. Natalie thanks Nash for informing her of the situation and hangs up the phone. In disbelief, Natalie states, \"You had Jessica committed?\" Jessica attempts to find Nash, but a nun stops her and states she is not allowed to go anywhere until she receives her release papers. As Jessica stares out in the hall, she is shocked to see Allison Perkins, who appears to be a patient. Smiling, Allison approaches Jessica and sings, \"I know something you don't know.\" \n\n\nBlair tells Todd she has been running on pure emotion ever since Margaret ruined their lives. Blair states she has been trying to make things right and can no longer continue to do so. Blair says the solution to the problem is for Todd and Sam to pack and move out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
