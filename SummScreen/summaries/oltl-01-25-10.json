Blair's suspicions were aroused when Markko related that he had invited Ford to the event.  Realizing that Langston had disappeared, Markko set out to find her, but Blair insisted that she would locate the teen.   While searching frantically for Langston, Blair recalled the conversation in which Langston admitted that she was physically attracted to Ford.\n\n\nIn a secluded area of the club, Langston and Ford shared a passionate kiss.  Suddenly, Langston pulled away and declared her love for Markko.  When Ford suggested that Langston spend the remaining hours of her birthday with Markko, Langston hesitated for a brief moment, and then pulled Ford into an embrace.  Blair appeared and interrupted Langston and Ford's private moment.  Ford quickly excused himself, and Blair demanded answers from Langston.  Admitting that she had experienced a lapse in judgment, Langston insisted that she loved Markko.  After promising that she wouldn't reveal Langston's secret to Markko, Blair warned the teen to be careful.\n\n\nAs Markko approached Ford in the club and asked if the director had knowledge of Langston's whereabouts, Blair arrived on the scene with a visibly shaken Langston.   When Blair suggested that Langston and Markko head home, Ford also attempted to leave, but Blair stopped him.   Ford was stunned when Blair planted a kiss on him, and asked if he wanted a relationship with Langston.  Smiling devilishly at Blair, Ford stated that he could be persuaded to forget about Langston.   Pulling away from him, Blair snarled, \"You don't give a damn about Langston, you're just a sleazy playboy!  You hurt Langston, I'll hurt you!\"\n\n\nAt the apartment, Cole and Matthew watched as Starr presented Danielle with photos of their little brothers, but Danielle appeared to show little interest.  Disgusted by the news of Todd's past, Danielle wondered how Starr had managed to remain sane while growing up as Todd's daughter.  Displaying a picture of Blair, Starr stated that her mother had always kept peace within the family.   \n\n\nStudying Blair's photo, a stunned Danielle related that she had met Blair in Seattle.  Recalling Blair's conversation regarding her daughter, Danielle told Starr that Blair loved her.  With a loving smile, Starr assured her sister that T\u00e9a also loved Danielle.   Expressing her fear of running into Todd at Rachel's apartment, Danielle asked Starr if she could stay with her.  Starr agreed to provide shelter for her sister only if Danielle promised to contact T\u00e9a and inform her of Danielle's whereabouts.   Starr assured Danielle that T\u00e9a wouldn't force Danielle to face Todd until the teen was ready.\n\n\nAt the police station, Todd, fearing that Danielle had left town, and told T\u00e9a that he intended to contact a private security company to locate Danielle. However, T\u00e9a was convinced that their daughter was still in Llanview.  Both Todd and T\u00e9a were shocked when several officers escorted a cuffed John into the station.   Todd directed a snide comment at John, but was caught off-guard when John stated that Lowell had arrested John in an attempt to prevent John from rescuing Jessica from Mitch Laurence.   Todd immediately recalled the conversation in which Mitch subtly threatened Danielle.   Todd related that Mitch had offered to eliminate Cole if Todd helped Mitch gain control of Jessica.   Upon receiving a call from a contact, Todd informed T\u00e9a that he had located Danielle.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Todd arrived at the apartment, just as Starr had convinced Danielle to call her mother.  Todd appeared hurt when Danielle announced that she would speak with T\u00e9a, but not Todd.   Starr allowed T\u00e9a to enter, but refused Todd entry.  Stepping out in the hall with Todd, Starr told her father that she had attempted to help Danielle understand his past, but had been unsuccessful.  Giving her dad a hug, Starr pleaded, \"Give her some time!  Don't push, or you'll lose!\"  Back inside the apartment, Danielle questioned how her mother could love a rapist.  T\u00e9a pleaded with Danielle to give Todd a chance.\n\n\nAs Todd remained out in the hall, Starr stepped back inside the apartment.   T\u00e9a agreed to allow Danielle to stay with Starr and her friends.  T\u00e9a thanked Star for supporting her sister.    Alone with Todd, T\u00e9a informed him that Danielle had requested to stay with her sister.  Later, when T\u00e9a returned with Danielle's belongings, the teen barely looked at her.  Danielle watched silently as Starr and T\u00e9a shared a loving moment.  Starr promised T\u00e9a that things would work out.\n\n\nAfterward, Langston and Markko returned home and were stunned when Starr introduced them to her sister, Danielle.   Langston and Markko watched as Starr, Cole, Danielle, and Matthew played a video game.  When Markko suggested that he and Langston retire for the evening, a nervous Langston insisted that she wanted to spend time with Starr and Danielle.  Meanwhile, a faint smile crossed Danielle's face as she observed her sister and the others.\n\n\nInside Marty's office, Natalie received counseling from the doctor.  When Natalie related how she had blamed John for Jared's death and later fell apart inside John's apartment, Marty stated that it was perfectly natural for Natalie to feel safe around John because of their past relationship.  Natalie grew alarmed when Marty suggested that Natalie was using John to compensate for the loss of Jared.  When Marty warned Natalie to stay away from John, Natalie became enraged and lashed out at Marty.  Convinced that Marty feared that Natalie was trying to steal John from her, Natalie reminded Marty that Jared had recently died and insisted that she had no interest in John.  Marty watched helplessly as Natalie stormed out of her office.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody frantically searched for Jessica.   As Brody attempted to question the drugged officer outside, Viki appeared and questioned what had happened.   Brody told Viki that Mitch had lured him away from Llanfair and kidnapped Jessica.  Viki suggested that they contact the police, but Brody advised her that Lowell was involved in the kidnapping.  After Brody detailed what had taken place, Viki wondered if John had escaped Lowell and his men on the docks.   Realizing that John was their only hope, Brody placed a call to John.\n\n\n Lowell paraded around and the police station with John's cell phone and berated John.   Lowell answered John's ringing cell phone.  Recognizing Lowell's voice, Brody questioned where Mitch had taken Jessica.  Alerting Brody that John was in police custody, Lowell suggested that Brody might locate Jessica at St. Ann's.  \n\n\nAfterward, John had a warning for Lowell.  John was certain that Mitch would attempt to kill Lowell and his family, once Mitch had completed his work.  Referring to Lowell as a snitch, John stated that Mitch would eliminate Lowell out of fear that Lowell would expose Mitch's crimes.  Ignoring John's warning, Lowell instructed his men to place John in leg irons.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Brody informed Viki that John was in custody.  When Viki appeared to lose all hope, Brody reminded her that Jessica was capable of taking care of herself.  After promising to locate Jessica, Brody left.  Moments later, Natalie arrived at home and was horrified to learn that Mitch had kidnapped Jessica.  When Viki related that John was in police custody, Natalie announced that she had business to attend to at the police station.\n\n\nTodd showed up at Llanfair and asked Viki for help.  Displaying a photo of Danielle, Todd stated that the teen was his daughter.   Viki listened in amazement as Todd related that Danielle had recently learned of his past and that he was afraid that he might lose her.\n\n\nArriving at the station, Brody discovered John shackled to a chair.  Lowell approached and ordered Brody to book John.  Lowell answered John's phone again, and smiled when he recognized Marty's voice.  With an evil laugh, Lowell stated, \"You're boyfriend is indisposed!\"  Meanwhile, unnoticed by Lowell, John gave Brody the phone number of one of John's contacts.  Certain that Mitch's letter contained physical evidence, John advised Brody to present the letter to his contact.  John believed that his friend might be able to provide clues to Jessica's whereabouts.   Afterward, Lowell told Brody that he was fired.\n\n\nLater, Natalie arrived at the police station and attempted to attack Lowell when he made a derogatory comment about Jessica.  Before she could assault Lowell, John stopped her.   Giving John a loving hug, Natalie whispered in his ear, \"Don't worry, I'm going to bust you out of here!\"  At that moment, Marty entered the room and observed the embrace.\n\n\n",
