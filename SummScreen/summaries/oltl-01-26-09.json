While Todd restrained Janet with great force, Antonio and Talia rushed into the bedroom with their weapons drawn. Upon noticing Janet with her blouse ripped, the officers held Todd at gunpoint. As Antonio placed him under arrest, he advised Todd that he was being arrested for the attempted rape of Lee Halprin. \n\n\nInside Mr. Joplin's classroom, Markko became annoyed when Langston commented on their teacher's sex appeal. As Schuyler called the class to order, vice principal Dickenson interrupted and announced that she was aware that drugs were being sold on the school grounds. She informed the students that an investigation would be conducted and any offenders would be subjected to criminal action. \n\n\nOnce Ms. Dickenson had left, Schuyler urged his students to reveal any knowledge of drug activity at the school. When Schuyler continued to question the class about exposing any known violators, Markko and several other students criticized him for asking them to snitch on their fellow classmates. Noticing the look of worry on Starr's face, Langston spoke up. She told her teacher that it was extremely difficult for a teenager to tattle on another. Schuyler forewarned the teenagers that keeping silent only enabled a drug abuser. Frustrated with his students' lack of cooperation, Mr. Joplin instructed his class to compose a long essay on the effect that drugs have on the human body. After Schuyler dismissed the class, Starr asked to speak privately with him. She stated that she knew someone who was using drugs. \n\n\nA nervous Schuyler suggested that they include Ms. Dickenson in their meeting, but Starr said that she wanted his advice. Reminding Schuyler of his confession that he once battled a drug addiction, Starr requested help in aiding someone who was using drugs. Starr confided in her teacher that someone she cared about had become addicted to drugs and she wanted to save him. To Starr's dismay, Schuyler admitted that a drug addict couldn't be helped unless the person actually wanted help. A devastated Starr listened as Mr. J educated her on the horrors of drug abuse. Realizing that Cole could possibly be a loss cause, Starr changed the subject and asked Mr. J if T\u00e9a had contacted him again. Disclosing that he hadn't been in contact with T\u00e9a, Schuyler was certain that his mother hadn't been involved in Todd's kidnapping scheme. \n\n\nCole discovered his locker opened and realized that his drugs had been stolen. Out of frustration, Cole banged his fist on his locker door. Witnessing Cole's erratic behavior, Langston called out to him but he brushed past her. \n\n\nNearby, Becca watched as another student teased Matthew about being the police commissioner's son. When the student suggested that Matthew had no knowledge of drugs, Matthew held up the bag of pills and bragged about his ability to obtain drugs. Becca remained silent as their classmate asked Matthew to prove that the bag contained real drugs. Agreeing to prove that he actually had drugs in his possession, Matthew didn't want to get caught and asked his classmates to join him on the baseball diamond. \n\n\nAs Matthew and his friends prepared to head outside, Cole approached and asked for a moment alone with Matthew. Cole pulled Matthew aside and accused him of stealing the drugs from his locker. When Matthew denied any involvement, Cole warned him that Ms. Dickenson had been urging students to turn in any offenders. Cole told Matthew that someone would eventually turn him in if he continued to brag about using drugs. As Cole chastised him about the stupidity of using drugs, Matthew lashed out and informed Cole that he was aware of Cole's drug problem. Noticing the angry exchange, Ms. Dickinson approached and asked what was going on. Cole insisted that everything was fine, but the vice principal was certain that trouble was brewing. \n\n\nRelating that she was aware of Matthew's recent experience with marijuana, Ms. Dickenson suggested that Cole be a role model for the freshman. After Ms. Dickinson left, Matthew panicked and begged Cole to help him. Seizing the pills from Matthew, Cole admitted that he had made a mistake and urged the younger teen not to follow in his footsteps. A frightened Matthew promised to make better choices, and headed off to catch up with his friends. Upon spotting him, Matthew's classmates gave him a knowing stare and walked away. Matthew was humiliated. \n\n\nLater, Langston met up with Cole and mentioned that she was aware of his recent troubles. An angered Cole approached Starr and demanded to know whom else she had told. As Starr tried to explain, Cole displayed the drugs and shouted, \"I don't need anyone! I only need this!\" Starr begged Cole to reconsider his decision, but Cole stormed off. Starr admitted to Langston that she was angry with Cole and his choice to ruin his life. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, T\u00e9a assured Lola that the teen could trust her and asked Lola to tell her about her mother's murder. Lola recalled the fateful night that she discovered her father leaning over her mother's dead body. A tearful Ray had told his daughter that an intruder had killed her mother and fled. Years later, Vanessa and Lola found the murder weapon hidden in the house. Believing that her father had discarded the knife, Lola and Vanessa took the evidence to the police and Ray was arrested. A tearful Lola admitted that it bothered her that she had never actually witnessed her father kill her mother. \n\n\nT\u00e9a asked what made Lola believe that her father might not have committed the crime. At that second, T\u00e9a's phone rang. Todd informed her that he was being arrested. After promising Lola that they would continue their conversation later, T\u00e9a headed off to Todd's house. Later, Markko discovered a sullen Lola. When he asked her what was wrong, she embraced him and begged him to hold her. \n\n\nInside the kitchen, Carlotta noticed that something was bothering Noelle. After telling Carlotta about Madame Delphina's prediction, Noelle expressed her fear that great wealth would destroy her relationship with Moe. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian bequeathed all her worldly possessions to Moe. Believing that she had lost her mind, Moe accused David of brainwashing her, but Dorian insisted that she had discovered true inner peace. Unconvinced, Moe stated that he couldn't accept Dorian's offer. Expressing his concern that Dorian wanted to give her possessions to Moe because she believed that she could retrieve them later, David suggested that she give everything to charity. Determined to change Moe's mind, Dorian pleaded with him to accept her offer. \n\n\nNoelle arrived at La Boulaie to see Moe. To her surprise, Moe greeted Noelle and told her that they were rich. After Moe explained that Dorian had presented him with a generous gift, Noelle related her conversation with Madame Delphina. Pulling Moe aside, Noelle stated that she didn't want to risk her relationship, and informed Moe that she believed that Dorian had an ulterior motive. As Dorian worried that Noelle would change Moe's mind, David urged Dorian to give Noelle her diamonds. Dorian gasped. \n\n\nDavid watched as Dorian handed Moe a case containing a priceless diamond necklace. As Moe placed the jewels on her, a speechless Noelle stared at her reflection in the mirror. \n\n\nAs Antonio manhandled a cuffed Todd, T\u00e9a arrived and warned Antonio that she would file charges of police brutality. Insisting that Antonio's conduct was improper, T\u00e9a advised Antonio that the charges against Todd would be thrown out and Antonio would face suspension. Removing Todd's cuffs, a frustrated Antonio promised to make Todd pay. \n\n\nAlone with Todd, T\u00e9a worried about the upcoming hearing. She asked Todd if he was certain that he hadn't admitted anything on the tape. Todd assured her that he hadn't. T\u00e9a was certain that Janet's testimony wasn't enough to damage Todd's case, but warned him that he was in trouble if anyone else had knowledge of his kidnapping plot. \n\n\nBack at the high school, Schuyler opened the letter that his mother had sent him before her death. The letter began - \"I have to tell you something. I entered into a shameful arrangement with a man named Todd Manning.\" \n\n\nFearing that Todd would harm her, Janet begged Antonio and Talia to protect her. Displaying very little sympathy for her, the cops reminded Janet of her decision to conspire with Todd. Arguing that she didn't have any knowledge of the facts at the time, Janet expressed her concern that Todd's conviction hinged on her testimony.\n\n\n",
