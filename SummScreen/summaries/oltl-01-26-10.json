    "soap_central": "\n Escape to Buchanan Ranch \n\n\nSchuyler removed his shirt and stared at himself in the mirror. Not liking what he saw, he proceeded to work out until he broke a sweat. He headed back to the mirror, removed his shirt again and smiled. \"You stud,\" he said. He proceeded to put together various outfits but settled on his usual jeans and t-shirt. He began to light candles for a romantic evening with Gigi. He received a phone call from Stacy who demanded to know if he had retrieved the drug to induce her labor. She threatened to talk to her \"big sis\" if Schuyler didn't follow through.\n\n\nGigi arrived, tired and ready to spend the night in front of the television. She noticed the candles and the table set for dinner. She asked if Rachel was having company, but Schuyler assured her that his roommate was out for the evening. He wanted Gigi to relax. He grabbed her phone and placed it on a table with his. He wanted no interruptions.\n\n\nAfter dinner, a preoccupied Schuyler assured Gigi he was fine, but he had thoughts of previous threats from both Kim and Stacy.\n\n\nBo and Nora stood in the middle of a messy room in a deserted house. They kissed but were disappointed that Delphina didn't leave a bed behind when she left town. Nora began to remove Bo's jacket and insisted that she didn't want to wait any longer to make love.\n\n\nLater, as the pair gorged on Chinese food, Nora wondered why the sex was \"better than ever.\" She began to discuss the reasons, but Bo quickly shushed her. He wasn't interested in hearing her analyze their lovemaking. Nora admitted that she should never have married Clint, but Bo felt that his brother should never have asked her in the first place. They were sorry about Clint, and Bo hoped that in the future, his feelings of happiness and guilt wouldn't \"go hand in hand.\"\n\n\nBo's phone began to ring, and Nora insisted that he answer. It was Viki, and she explained that she was frantically trying to locate Clint. She advised Bo that Mitch had taken Jessica. Nora urged Bo to take care of more important issues, and she would be able to talk to Clint. She learned from Nigel that Clint had returned to the mansion.\n\n\nKim admired herself in a mirror. \"Looking good Kim. I'd do me,\" she said to her reflection. She dressed in several outfits in her attempts to decide which looked the best for seducing Clint. Finally, she decided on some sexy lingerie and waited for her boss to arrive home. She struck a pose on the couch by the door. \"Welcome home, Daddy,\" she purred when he walked in.\n\n\nClint couldn't decide if the surprise was good or bad as Kim wrapped her arms around him. She told him how grateful she was for her job and home, and added that Clint was an attractive man. She admitted that she liked rich and powerful men. Clint reminded her that he was old enough to be her father. Kim advised him that he was happy that she was around and, grabbing his phone, tossed it aside. Clint acknowledged that Kim was good company and \"easy on the eyes.\"\n\n\nThey began to kiss but Clint pulled away. He uttered that while Kim was sexy and beautiful, he had shared his bed with his wife not too long before. Kim reminded him that Nora hadn't been his wife since she had looked at Bo, and she wouldn't be returning to Clint. She urged him to \"get back in the saddle\" and make himself happy. Clint wasn't too sure he'd be able to do that, so Kim suggested that he go out of town. \"Cheer the hell up,\" she ordered. She herself would prefer a warm body next to hers, she admitted. He pulled her into a kiss.\n\n\nThe couple moved up to Clint's bedroom but Nora interrupted them when she burst through the door. She was horrified to find the couple in bed again. She explained that Nigel had let her in, and both Clint and Kim began to complain. Clint advised Nora to talk to his lawyer if she had anything to say. Finally, Nora out-shouted the couple to advise Clint that Jessica had been kidnapped. Clint jumped up and headed out the door with Nora. \"Kimberly, don't wait up,\" he called out.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki was near hysterics as she worried about Jessica's kidnapping. Todd offered to use his newspaper in an effort to impeach Lowell, get Bo his job back, and locate Jessica. T\u00e9a arrived, worried about Viki and the possibility that Danielle could be in danger too. She admitted that while she was against capital punishment, she would push for it in Mitch's case. Viki thought the only thing they could all do was pray.\n\n\nTodd wondered where Charlie was, and Viki was evasive, noting that her husband would be around if he could. Todd again demanded to know where Charlie was, but Viki again stated that her husband would be around if he was aware of what was happening. Suddenly, T\u00e9a led Bree into the room, and announced that the little girl had been looking for her mother. Viki told Bree that her mother was on a trip. \"Is she sick again?\" Bree asked. Viki assured the girl that Jessica wasn't sick and would be home soon. T\u00e9a advised Bree that Jessica was thinking about her daughter and how much she loved her. T\u00e9a suggested that Bree draw a picture for her mother and T\u00e9a and Todd took the child to her room.\n\n\nGreg was pleased when Rachel showed up with a picnic basket dinner at the hospital. She quickly assured him that it was takeout, as she followed in her mother's footsteps when it involved cooking. The pair shared a kiss in the empty exam room, though Rachel was concerned about getting caught. She thought she should leave to help T\u00e9a with her concerns over Danielle.\n\n\nStacy left Schuyler a threatening message, and was annoyed that he had ended their phone call. Her mood changed when Rex returned home, and she placed their food on the table. He was pleased that she was honest when she admitted to having their meal delivered.\n\n\n\"So how's the baby,\" he asked. Stacy suggested that they decide on a name for the baby, but they were unable to agree on any. Rex refused to name their daughter Kim and suggested that the baby not be named after anyone at all. He didn't think his baby needed a \"hand-me-down\" name. He fantasized about the baby's future. He put a damper on the dinner by mentioning the fact that Gigi was alone during her pregnancy. Stacy reminded him that their baby would have both parents around.\n\n\nAfter dinner, Rex began to undress for bed, and Stacy invited him to share the bed with her. She insisted it was only because the bed was bigger than the one that he had been sleeping in that was Shane's. Rex didn't think it was a good idea, even though Stacy promised that she wouldn't \"come on\" to him. She felt ugly because she was pregnant. Rex assured her that she was beautiful. He added that all pregnant women were beautiful. Stacy's smile turned into a frown when Rex clarified his statement. She thought it would be nice for Rex to spend some time with the baby.\n\n\nWhen a knock sounded on the door, Rex hurriedly replaced his shirt and answered it. It was Bo, who didn't mince words. \"Your sister Jessica is missing,\" he advised Rex. Bo wanted to make sure that Shane and Stacy were safe. He decided that he would be taking Shane to the Buchanan ranch in Texas, where his employees would be up to the task of protecting the boy. He invited Stacy and Rex to join them, but Stacy advised him that she was unable to fly so late in her pregnancy. Bo assured Rex that he and Nora would take good care of Shane. An upset Rex spoke to Gigi on the phone and filled her in.\n\n\nGigi ended the call and informed Schuyler that she had to leave. She explained quickly that Bo was taking Shane out of town for protection from Mitch. She had to pack a bag for her son. Schuyler asked about Stacy being included, but Gigi glared at him. Stacy wasn't her problem, she retorted. Schuyler offered to go with her, but Gigi declined. She needed to say goodbye to her son, and it would be difficult enough.\n\n\nClint and Nora arrived at Llanfair, and Viki embraced Clint. Nora quietly left the study and stood in the foyer to call Rachel. She advised her daughter that she was heading to the ranch with Bo and wanted Rachel to look after Matthew. Stacy, Bo, Rex, and Shane entered, and Nora enthusiastically told Shane all about the ranch. She was sure he would love being there. She told Bo that her visit to Clint's house had been \"informative.\" Gigi arrived with Shane's belongings. Rex told a curious Shane why they were sending him to the ranch and assured him it was safe. Shane wanted his parents to go with him. Stacy rolled her eyes.\n\n\nViki blamed herself for the kidnapping, and cited how things would have been different if she had retained her position of mayor instead of allowing Dorian to take over. Clint was certain that Mitch would have found another way to make his moves. Viki was worried that Jessica would have another breakdown. Bo and Nora walked into the study, where Bo announced that he had an idea. He thought that Bree should go with them. The others joined them. Rex explained to his son that he couldn't leave Stacy. Clint asked Shane to keep an eye on Bree, and Rex reminded Shane that by the time Shane returned, he'd have a new brother or sister.\n\n\nA cynical Shane declared that Texas wouldn't be any safer than Llanview. He thought that they could run, but they wouldn't be able to hide from Mitch. The adults all looked at each other quietly.\n\n\nStacy remained in the foyer and chatted to Kim on the phone. She was worried about Schuyler not returning her calls and the baby not being delivered on time.\n\n\nDuring a musical montage, everyone at Llanfair said goodbye as Nora, Bo, Shane, and Bree headed to Texas. Shane put his hand on Stacy's stomach before he left. He hugged his parents as Stacy shook her head. Schuyler listened to his phone message and threw the phone against the wall. Greg and Rachel kissed goodbye. Kim stared at a photo of Clint and Nora.\n\n\n",
