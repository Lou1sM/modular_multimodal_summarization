    "soap_central": "\nOne Way or a Mother\n\n\n \nAt Llanview Hospital, Kim spoke on her phone with Clint, and promised him that she could handle Buchanan Enterprises affairs in his stead as he continued the search for Jessica.  After hanging up, she grabbed the passing Schuyler and ordered him to get the oxytocin Stacy needed in order to induce early labor.  Schuyler remained queasy about the prospect of returning to his old habits, and reminded Kim of how he'd disgraced his mother and hit rock bottom by stealing drugs from the hospital to support his addiction; Kim told him that if he didn't do it he stood to lose Gigi forever.  He warned her that no matter what he did, their deception would not end with the drug, and Rex would demand a paternity test.  Kim told him she could handle the paternity issue, and before she left, she suggested he think of doing the theft for Gigi, not for Stacy.\n\n\nAt the loft, Rex returned home without news about Jessica.  Stacy reacted with muted concern as Rex feared for both his sisters, and told her that Natalie seemed to be coping with their sibling's disappearance.  Tired of sitting on his hands, Rex resolved to head for Llanfair to see if he could help Viki with the search efforts, which perturbed Stacy, who'd hoped for more individual attention for her and their baby.  Rex promised an uneasy Stacy that Oliver would watch over the baby like it was his own.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Oliver was standing guard when Kyle arrived with a hot meal.  Kyle told his boyfriend that he was also there to confront Stacy about their suspicions regarding the baby's paternity, but Oliver pleaded with him not to reopen old wounds.  Kyle was sure that Stacy was playing Schuyler for a fool about being the child's father in order to secure his cooperation, because they knew he'd do anything to keep Gigi.  Oliver said he didn't know and didn't want to know, as he'd never thought about being a father.  Kyle told him it was time for him to start, but Oliver insisted that Kyle's suspicions were all merely theories.\n\n\nJust then, Rex opened the apartment door. Kyle and Oliver ended their hushed conversation and glancing awkwardly at Stacy.  Rex greeted Kyle before leaving for Llanfair, and Kyle headed to the hospital for his rounds.\n\n\nOliver joined Stacy inside the loft and told her of Kyle's suspicions, only for Ms. Morasco to laugh them off.  Oliver asked how she could be sure Schuyler was the baby's father and not Oliver, and Stacy claimed she could \"feel it.\"  When pressed, she claimed that the doctor had nailed down the exact date of conception, and in any event, none of Kyle or Oliver's theories mattered, since Rex would be the only father her child knew.  Oliver admitted that he was relieved to hear Stacy reassert Schuyler's claim to the child, as he wasn't ready to be a father.\n\n\nKim rushed back into the apartment, and was jabbering a mile a minute about Schuyler and the hospital; upon seeing Oliver, she fell silent, then covered, claiming she was talking about plastic surgery options.  Oliver exited the loft to resume his watch duties, while Stacy and Kim resumed conspiring.  Stacy complained about Rex's concern for everyone but her, while Kim was more concerned about Clint's worries over Jessica.  When Kim said she wished she could take his pain away, Stacy realized Kim was talking about more than just \"sexual healing,\" and accused her friend of falling for Clint.  Kim scoffed and said she cared for Clint; that was all.\n\n\nAs Kim rubbed Stacy's feet, Stacy continued her laundry list of complaints.  She was irritated at Schuyler's continued concern for the baby's health, especially because it wasn't even his.  Kim assured her that Schuyler would work with them in order to keep Gigi.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody reported to a concerned Viki, Clint, and Gigi on the status of the forensics expert's examination of Mitch's letter to Jessica.  He said the investigation was ongoing, but they expected results soon.  Clint told Gigi that he'd heard from Shane in Texas, and the boy was doing fine with Bo, Nora, and Bree.\n\n\nAs Brody and Clint stepped into the foyer to talk, Gigi comforted Viki, and reassured her that Jessica would be found.  Noticing a conspicuous absence, Gigi asked where Charlie was.  \"I have no idea,\" Viki said softly.  Her face fell as she told Gigi that Charlie hadn't returned home the night before, and she feared that Jared's death and Mitch walking free had broken both his sobriety and his spirit.  Gigi was sure that Viki and Charlie could weather any storm, and that he'd return to her.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Brody told Clint that the forensics report on the letter would be back shortly, and that without Lowell or the police department's help, it was their only lead on finding Jessica.\n\n\nWhile Gigi joined Brody in the foyer, Clint returned to the drawing room to speak to Viki in private.  He also noted that Charlie hadn't been back all night, and asked her point-blank if Charlie had fallen off the wagon.  Viki admitted that Charlie was in a tailspin, but he didn't know Jessica was missing; if he did, she was sure he'd be at her side.  She pleaded with Clint to understand Charlie's pain, and said that the only way Charlie would be able to move forward would be to find someone who he could share his rage against Mitch with, someone who could relate to him in his grief and fury.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Brody and Gigi answered the door to see Rex waiting there, eager to help with the hunt for Jessica.  Noticing the tension between the exes, Brody quickly left the room.  Fumbling through an awkward conversation, Rex and Gigi compared notes on Shane's well-being in Texas.  Gigi extended an olive branch, and told Rex she was glad they could still work together in a time of crisis for the sake of their child, just as Viki and Clint had; though she was still angry about Stacy, she was glad to hear her potential niece or nephew was being protected from Mitch as well.  She reacted with reservation as Rex told her he'd changed his will to include the baby in case anything should happen to him, and that the child would go to either Jessica or Natalie.\n\n\nAs Brody returned and Viki and Clint reentered the foyer, Gigi made her exit, and told Rex she hoped they found Jessica soon.  Just as Gigi walked out, however, Commissioner Lowell walked in, ready to gladhand the Buchanan family over Jessica's disappearance, full of insincere promises about using the full force of the department's resources.  Brody and Rex weren't buying Lowell's line, while Viki and Clint were outraged at his insinuation that Jessica had suffered another mental break and disappeared on her own.  Clint told Lowell that they all knew Mitch was responsible, and that Lowell wouldn't lift a finger to help Jessica.\n\n\nLowell sneered that Mitch had an alibi for the abduction, since Brody and John were assaulting him on the docks.  Brody knew the real purpose of Lowell's visit; he was there for information on the family's independent investigation of Mitch.\n\n\nDown at a darkened shooting range, Charlie was unloading a pistol into a series of practice targets, and envisioning Mitch standing before him in the shadows.  Inexperienced with firearms, Charlie found that his aim was lacking, which led to a hallucination of Mitch mocking his prowess.  \"Not even close,\" Mitch purred.  Charlie told the specter that he was just getting started.\n\n\nAs Charlie began again, Dorian arrived and encouraged him to keep practicing.  He'd need to be ready when it was time to pull the trigger on Mitch once and for all.  She offered him something to steady his nerves, but Charlie said no, expecting her to whip out a flask; he explained that he'd gotten back on the wagon the day he'd committed to killing Mitch.  Instead, Dorian offered a card from Jared's memorial service, but Charlie said he didn't need that either; he thought of Jared everyday, as well as the injustice of Mitch's undeserved freedom, and everything the man had done to his family and to Viki's.\n\n\nCharlie told Dorian he was forcing himself to ignore Viki's phone calls, because he knew that if he heard her voice, and the love in it, he wouldn't be able to do what was necessary: shut her out, shut his life out in order to wipe Mitch Laurence off the face of the earth.  He knew he couldn't be forgiven for his endangering Jared, or for betraying Viki's trust, but destroying Mitch was the least he could do.  \"You're ready,\" Dorian marveled.  Charlie told her she had to fulfill her end of their bargain, and locate and isolate Mitch.  Dorian said she was having trouble finding their quarry, but had an idea about who might know Mitch's location.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Lowell was still verbally jousting with Viki and Clint when his phone rang; it was Dorian, looking for Mitch.  Lowell put Dorian off, but Dorian heard Viki yelling at the commissioner over the line.  When Dorian mentioned Viki by name, Charlie's interest was piqued.  Lowell hung up on Dorian and quickly left Llanfair.\n\n\nOnce Lowell was outside, Dorian called him again, to berate him for hanging up on the mayor of Llanview.  Lowell told Dorian he had no idea where Mitch was, but he'd been at Llanfair to speak to Viki, as Jessica was missing.\n\n\nDorian was shocked and dismayed by the news, which she relayed to Charlie after hanging up on Lowell.  Charlie was furious, sure that Mitch had Jessica.  He told Dorian he had to get back to Viki's side immediately, but first, he turned back to the target range for another go-round to vent his anger.  \"Laurence, you're a dead man,\" he snarled, and pulled the trigger.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Rex was still infuriated by Lowell's intrusion, and told Viki and Brody that Lowell or no Lowell, he'd find Jessica and Mitch, and he hurried out.  Brody briefed Viki and Clint on the finished forensics report, which had found obscure trace minerals on the letter Mitch had written to Jessica, minerals not usually found in the country.  What they needed to be looking for, he concluded, was an area nearby which contained these rare minerals.\n\n\nAlone at the shooting range, Dorian examined Charlie's latest target sheet.  On his final try, he'd shot the target through the heart.  \"Mitch Laurence, you are indeed dead,\" she purred, poking her finger through the bullet hole and then tearing the sheet apart.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Marty was in a session with her colleague, Dr. Levin, and was recounting her disastrous experience counseling Natalie.  She said Natalie was an aggressive, determined woman who had suffered a terrible loss, one Marty could understand, and she also understood Natalie's growing reconnection to John.  Levin probed at Marty's choice of words, and asked her to dispense with the official report and focus on how she really felt about John and Natalie's relationship.  Marty explained that she and John had fallen in love when he'd filled the role of her protector and white knight, and she feared that he was doing the same for Natalie.  She wondered what would happen if John's protection developed into something more, just as it had for him and Marty.\n\n\nAfter finishing her session, Marty exited Levin's office just in time to run into a nurse with a medicine cart.  As Marty grabbed a prescription for a patient, Schuyler watched with interest, as he spotted his chance to steal the oxytocin Stacy needed.  As the nurse wheeled her cart down the hall to a patient's room and left it unguarded in the corridor, Schuyler approached, ready to grab the drug.\n\n\nBefore the theft could be completed, Kyle arrived, anxious to speak to Schuyler.  He asked Schuyler if he was sure he was the father of Stacy's baby, and Schuyler said yes, and asked who else it could be.  Unwilling to get into his suspicions any further, Kyle clammed up and walked away.\n\n\nAlone again, Schuyler picked up a medical requisition form and checked off \"oxytocin.\"  Struggling with his conscience, Schuyler stopped, then moved to throw the form into the trash.  Before he could, Gigi entered the corridor and startled him.  Gigi vented her troubles to her boyfriend, and told him about her encounter with Rex at Llanfair and the news about Rex putting the baby into his will.  Schuyler was perturbed to hear about Rex taking more measures to claim \"his\" child, but hid his discontent in front of Gigi, who admitted that her anger about Stacy's pregnancy had lessened for one particular reason: the baby had allowed her and Schuyler to find each other.\n\n\nAfter Gigi left, Schuyler reconsidered his choice, and returned to the medical cart with the requisition form just as the nurse returned to the corridor.  Schuyler handed over the form in exchange for the dose of oxytocin.\n\n\nNearby, Kyle called Oliver, and apologized for their quarrel over Stacy.  He said there had been a botched operation at the hospital, and it had made him think of Oliver and how much he valued Oliver's love.  Oliver told Kyle not to worry about Stacy, because she'd assured him that the baby was Schuyler's and not his.  Oliver thought it was just as well, because he had no interest in parenthood, and wanted it to just be the two of them.\n\n\nIn the police station cellblock, Natalie arrived at John's cell.  John inquired about the search for Jessica, but Natalie had other things in mind, like breaking John out of prison so he could help her stop Mitch and save her sister.  John refused to let Natalie do anything crazy, but Natalie said she had it all figured out.  Undoing the top buttons on her blouse, she reminded him that the guard on duty had always had a thing for her, and she was going to get his keys and spring John in no time flat.\n\n\nJohn pleaded with Natalie not to endanger herself for him, but Natalie reminded him he'd done the same for her after she'd stabbed Mitch.  John warned her that even if she did break him out, he refused to run.  Natalie told him that she couldn't help Jared or Jessica, but he could do something about Mitch, and she needed to help him.  John asked her to go home.  Reaching through the bars, he took her hands and asked if she trusted him; Natalie said she always would.\n\n\nJust then, Marty arrived, spotting John and Natalie's intimate moment.  As Natalie moved away, Marty asked her about Jessica.  Natalie said there was no news, and quickly left.\n\n\nTurning her attention to John, Marty opted to ignore what she'd walked in on, and focused on the peril to Jessica.  She wished John could help, and John said he'd be out soon.  Marty assured him that Elijah was a good lawyer and would help him at his arraignment, but John seemed oddly confident that no matter what happened, it was his last day in jail.  \"Please tell me you're not doing anything reckless,\" Marty said, noticing the glimmer in his eye, but John merely shrugged.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Clint was reluctant to leave Viki, but Viki assured him she'd be all right.  As Clint left, Viki ascended the stairs, and soon another scene was playing out in the foyer.  Natalie rushed back into the house, ran into Brody, and told him he needed to help her break John out of jail.  To her shock, Brody said that he and John already had his escape covered.\n\n\nAs Natalie and Brody rushed down the hall, Viki walked back down the foyer stairs, and found herself face-to-face with Charlie.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the secluded Fort Osborn Geological Observatory on Llantano Mountain, Jessica awoke from a drugged stupor to find Mitch looming over her.  Jessica asked where she was, and Mitch told her she was finally home.  Noticing that she was in a sterile exam room full of medical equipment, Jessica feared what her father had in store for her, but Mitch said the preparations weren't for her; everything was being done to ensure that they as a family were safe \"when the time comes.\"  Jessica asked what he meant by that, but Mitch was offering no answers.\n\n\nJessica rose to attempt an escape, but was stopped when Nurse Charles sneaked up behind her, and jabbed her with another syringe.  The addled Jessica collapsed into a chair, and cursed the creepy nurse, but Mitch scolded her for her harsh language and said it wouldn't be appropriate around \"the little lamb.\"  With that, Mitch and Nurse Charles unveiled a bassinet sitting nearby.  Mitch told Jessica that the bassinet was for \"our own prince of peace,\" his chosen one, Rex and Stacy's baby.  Jessica said she was the child's aunt, but Mitch informed her she would have a much larger role in the baby's life than she'd previously intended: \"You're going to be his mother.\" \n\n\n",
