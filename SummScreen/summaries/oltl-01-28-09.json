    "tvmega_recap": "At Rodi's, Cole looks at a packet of little white pills as he remembers a conversation that he had had with John. John walks up and asks Cole as to what he is doing here. At the Angel Square diner, David is just about to sign away the Buchanan fortune when Rex comes in and interrupts. At a table in the Angel Square diner, Blair questions Todd as to why he is trusting Tea. Tea visits Star at La Boulaie and tells her that Todd had tried to kill himself on New Year's. In Rodi's, Cole attacks Wes and hits him in the face over Marty. Blair urges Todd to confess to what he had done to Star. Rex stops David from signing away the Buchanan fortune. Viki tells Natalie that she is taking Chloe to visit Jessica at St. Anne's. Natalie objects. Jared suggests that they move out of Llanfair. David questions Dorian as to why she hates Rex so bad. John tries to talk to Cole about his problems, but Cole refuses to listen and then pops another pill. Jared tells Natalie his feelings about them moving out of Llanfair into their own place, but finally gives in to Natalie's wishes for them to stay at Llanfair . Viki realizes that something is wrong when Jessica doesn't remember Chloe being born. Tea tells Star that Todd had forbade Tea to cross examine Star on the witness stand. Tea is determined to win the case for Todd. She goes and talks to Starr privately and milks sympathy from her by informing her that her father tried to take his own life. At that point, she establishes that Starr may not testify against her father. Todd also makes it clear that he does not want to let her damage Starr on the witness stand. Not knowing what to do and finding she cannot contact Cole or Langston, Starr rushes to the high school and seeks comfort from her new teacher, Mr. J. (Dr. Joplin's son). Rex goes to find out what is up with Dorian and David. He cannot find out any information from them about what they are up to. But he lets Natalie and Jared know that he can clearly see that Dorian wants to find a way to get all of David's wealth when he inherits it. Natalie admits to her mother and Dr. Levin that she does not want Jessica to come home and be able to care for her two children after being homicidal recently. Viki goes to arrange for her daughter to come back. But she admits to Dr. Levin that she realizes something is not right with her daughter and questions whether she has really integrated or not.",
