    "soap_central": "\n My Three Dads \n\n\n \nTodd awakened abruptly from a nightmare and knocked a tray full of dishes off the bed. Hearing the clatter, T\u00e9a rushed into his room. He thought he had lost T\u00e9a, Todd said. He dreamed that Mitch had killed her. T\u00e9a assured him that he hadn't lost her and she had also spoken to Starr about Danielle. Their daughter was fine, though there was no news of Jessica. T\u00e9a mentioned that she hadn't slept very well in the guest room.\n\n\nTodd felt somewhat better after showering, but he was still concerned about Danielle. He was worried that his daughter would have nothing to do with him. T\u00e9a pointed out that their daughter was almost as stubborn as someone else she knew. The couple drew close and were about to kiss, but T\u00e9a broke away. She needed to get dressed, she told him. As she headed to the door Todd called out to her. \"Nothing,\" he said, changing his mind.\n\n\nStacy and Kim anxiously waited for Schuyler to show up with the oxytocin. Kim was reluctant to sign the paper that would name her the baby's guardian in the event that something happened to Stacy. She stressed that while she would always look out for the child, she didn't \"do kids.\" She finally agreed to sign if Stacy would stop talking about dying.\n\n\nHearing approaching footsteps outside the apartment door, Oliver whipped out his gun when Schuyler arrived. Schuyler informed Oliver that he was an old friend, and a sarcastic Oliver noted that Schuyler wasn't that old. He was aware that Schuyler was the baby's father. An angry Schuyler accused Kyle of breaching the patient confidentiality law and stressed that none of it was Oliver's business. The men entered the apartment and Oliver made sure that it was okay for Schuyler to be there. Stacy asked him for privacy and Oliver stepped out.\n\n\nSchuyler had the drug but he was still reluctant to be involved with it because of his past. He still felt responsible for his mother's death as a result of his past involvement in stealing drugs from the hospital. Stacy made it known that Rex would go back to Gigi if they didn't take the planned action. Schuyler was worried that Rex would go back to Gigi, anyway, even after they did everything to prevent it. He was concerned that his baby wouldn't have a father and even a mother if Stacy went back to her pole dancing.\n\n\nStacy took exception to that and tried to explain that Schuyler couldn't understand, but she had grown very attached to her baby. She was different than before and loved her baby. She vowed to prove it to Schuyler, who turned his attention to the baby's guardianship. He refused to allow Kim to put her name down on the form and insisted that his own name belonged there. Stacy refused, but Schuyler stood firm and Kim had to separate the pair. If they wanted the baby to be delivered on time, they would follow his demands, Schuyler informed the women. He would give them the drug but Stacy would have to submit to a physical first. She would have to pretend she was in labor and go to the hospital. He wanted to make sure the baby was okay.\n\n\nSchuyler also wanted his name on the form. He signed it and grabbed it for himself. He would make a copy and get it to Stacy. Hiding the paper under his coat, he left the apartment. He stopped to chat with Oliver and advised Oliver that he wanted his visit kept secret. He threatened to expose Kyle and his scams if Oliver mentioned it to anyone. Stacy sadly told her girlfriend that Kim was \"off the hook\" for having to look out for the baby. She appreciated Kim agreeing to it. She had one more favor to ask and Kim reluctantly agreed to listen. She didn't want to hear the \"d\" word anymore.\n\n\nStacy promised to stop talking about dying but asked that Kim find the baby, her daughter, if something ever happened to her. She asked Kim to tell the baby all about Stacy. She was afraid that the baby would hear things about her mother and how she used the baby as a \"tool.\" She wanted her daughter to know that things changed and she really loved her, she was an angel and the most perfect thing. She really loved her.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi and Rachel chatted about Schuyler and the new apartment that he shared with Rachel. Gigi wondered if everything was okay with Schuyler since it seemed that something was bothering him. She asked Rachel if she was aware of any problem that Schuyler might have. Gigi felt that Schuyler was covering something up, though she stressed that she didn't want to harm the secrecy that Rachel shared as Schuyler's counselor or co-counselor. Rachel stressed that she wouldn't want to harm the privacy of friendship either. Gigi swore that she could tell from Rachel's face that something was wrong.\n\n\nRachel asked if Gigi would be with Schuyler if Rex hadn't gotten Stacy pregnant. Gigi realized that Schuyler thought their relationship was all because of Rex. Rachel wanted to know if Gigi and Rex would get back together in the event that Stacy's baby wasn't Rex's. Gigi had no doubt that it was his, and she was not planning on leaving Schuyler. She cared about him way too much, she promised. Rex still slept with Stacy, she pointed out. She added that even though Schuyler had slept with Stacy \"back in the day\" he was too good for her \"skanky sister.\" Rachel asked if Rex wasn't too good for Stacy.\n\n\nGigi ignored the question and stated again that she would never leave Schuyler. Rachel explained that she and Schuyler were former addicts and they had difficulty in trusting people. They were still compulsive and would cheat, lie, or steal. Gigi admitted that she couldn't picture Schuyler that way. Rachel advised her, \"Don't overestimate your power over him.\"\n\n\nAt Mitch's hideout at the Fort Osborn Geological Observatory, he advised Jessica that she would have a child to call her own, one that was a great gift. As Jessica sat in a drugged stupor, Mitch deemed that Stacy was not the proper individual to take care of her own baby. He thought she was a \"soulless, Godless creature.\" Jessica retorted that he could not take Stacy's baby, and Jessica refused to be a part of it. Mitch thought that Jessica should be willing to cooperate because she wouldn't like the consequences if she didn't.\n\n\nHe believed that Jessica needed to heal after losing Chloe, and he knew how painful it was to lose a child. Jessica pointed out that she had been wrong to take another child, but Mitch disagreed. He thought it was the right idea but the wrong child. It was God's plan that Jessica was meant for greater things, and she would be the mother of the new messenger, he added. Again, Jessica promised that she would have no parts of Mitch's plans, but he assured her that she deserved a baby and this one would need her.\n\n\nBecoming clearheaded, Jessica stressed that she wanted to go home to be with Bree who needed her. Mitch would see to it that Jessica only wanted and needed him. He assured her that soon, she wouldn't miss everyone else and would forget about her family. Jessica was on her feet and she spit in his face. She told him to \"rot in hell.\" She would never forget her real family. Mitch promised to make sure that she did.\n\n\nJessica attempted to get away, but a couple of security guards grabbed her and detained her. Nurse Charles injected another dose of the sedative to quiet her down. Before she fell asleep, Jessica advised Mitch that she would hate him until the day she died. She would not do his bidding, she said. Nurse Charles told her boss that Jessica was disrespectful. Mitch ascertained that she needed training. The nurse wondered what would happen if Jessica didn't do what she was told to do. She noted that Jessica was strong and willful and using up much of the sedative. Mitch was certain Jessica would be fine when he was finished. He would see that she was happy and forgot everyone she used to love.\n\n\nRex ran into Dorian at the shooting range and wondered what the mayor was doing there. He sneered and said that she had lots of enemies. He had applied for a license to carry a concealed weapon, he revealed. He was a good shot but denied that it was for the purpose of going after Lowell. He mentioned that Mitch had taken Jessica and would be returning for Rex's baby. Dorian noted that she had heard about the incident. \"Incident?\" Rex asked incredulously. He advised Dorian that Mitch had a plan, and Rex was certain it had to do with his baby.\n\n\nDorian was sorry that Mitch had targeted Rex's family, but Rex didn't want to hear it. He wondered if she thought Mitch was just going to disappear after she saw to it that he was let out of jail. She was sorry that people were getting hurt. Rex instantly blamed her by noting that if Bo were still the police commissioner, Mitch would have remained behind bars. Rex was worried that they would have to wait for Mitch to make a move since no one knew where he was. Dorian didn't think that Lowell knew of Mitch's whereabouts. She offered to place guards or police at Rex's disposal but Rex assured her that he had already taken care of that. \"Thank you for throwing us into the pit,\" he scoffed.\n\n\nCharlie returned to Llanfair and Viki made him aware that there was still no news of Jessica. He apologized for what happened, but Viki wasn't clear on what he was apologizing for. She asked him if he was sorry about Jessica or the two of them. \"It's all wrong,\" he said. He wanted to help her. An indifferent Viki advised him that she was fine and coping. He was sober and there and hadn't been drinking, he assured her. He suggested that she have him tested and he insisted that he had never lied to her. Viki was reluctant to trust him, and maintained that he had lied about everything. He told her he loved her, but she wanted to know where he had been.\n\n\nShe reminded him that she had followed him to a bar where he sat with a martini. She had asked him to leave with her, but he didn't and instead ordered her to leave alone. Charlie admitted that it wasn't his drink. \"Let me help you,\" Charlie pleaded, indicating that it was most important that they find Jessica. Viki declined, citing the fact that Charlie had his own problems, like grieving for Jared. Charlie acknowledged that he would grieve until he was in the ground beside Jared, and he was still capable of being there for her. He wanted her to lean on him.\n\n\nViki began to cry and walked over to hug him. Suddenly, she caught herself and pulled away. She wanted to know the truth. She wanted to know where he went because she felt that he wasn't the same man that she already knew and loved. He told her he loved her and agreed that he had changed since Mitch had entered their lives. Viki took a call from Clint, and Charlie slyly pulled the gun from his coat. As he turned it over in his hands and looked at it, his own cell phone went off. It was Dorian and she demanded that he return to the shooting range. She had a plan. He refused at first, but Dorian insisted that she knew how to get Jessica back. Viki revealed that Clint had nothing new to tell her.\n\n\nViki was worried that Jessica had been hurt or worse because she knew how insane Mitch was. Charlie reluctantly informed her that he had to leave. Stuttering, he said that he had to help look for Jessica. Viki told him to go because she didn't have the energy to play his game. Charlie promised that one day she would understand, and they would have Jessica returned to them.\n\n\nCharlie turned up at the shooting range, and Dorian divulged her plan. They would give Mitch what he wanted the most. \"What can we give Mitch that he wants more than Jessica?\" Charlie asked. Dorian claimed to know what Mitch's weak spot was, and they had no choice. It wouldn't be easy but they had to do it, she emphasized.\n\n\nSchuyler arrived at Rodi's and as he stowed his things under the bar, Gigi asked to speak to him. She told him that she was ready to commit and that she and Rex were over. She told him she loved him and Schuyler was speechless. \"It wouldn't hurt to hear it back,\" Gigi kidded him. \"I love you too,\" Schuyler told her as they embraced. He was not looking happy.\n\n\nOliver flashed back to Stacy telling him that the baby wasn't his, but was on his toes quickly when he heard someone arriving. Rex announced himself and asked if anyone had been there to visit. Oliver made a face and told him that Kim was there. Rex understood Oliver's expression and Oliver assured him that no one else had been by. Rex told him he could leave, but Oliver volunteered to stay off the clock. Rex expressed how useless he felt without a weapon and wished he could stand guard on his own. After all, he was the baby's father, he stated.\n\n\nMitch vowed to take drastic action.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Schuyler concludes that if something happens to Stacy or to Rex, he needs Stacy to sign over guardianship to him. She does so in exchange for his helping her to induce labor so that Rex will believe the baby is his. Rex runs into Dorian and tells her she needs to do something about Mitch. She then contacts Charlie and tells him that she has an idea about how to get Rex to let Jessica go, involving \"somebody\" who is more important to Mitch than Jessica. Mitch and the nurse hold Jessica captive, drug her and intend to brainwash her to forget all the people she loves and raise Rex and Stacy's baby with him.",
