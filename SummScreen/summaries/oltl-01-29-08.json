He told her he knew she'd be a great mom to Sam and wanted her to stop thinking about Margaret. Before they could get up and go about their day, Addie burst in, wearing an aikido outfit and carrying a tray with breakfast. Todd wondered if she had forgotten to take her medicine, but she only replied, \"New and improved.\" As he laughed uncontrollably, Blair went off to see to the baby, and Todd's mother-in-law informed him that she wanted a heart-to-heart talk. \n\n\nAddie said she was sorry she hadn't been aware of Todd's dry sense of humor all that time. She wanted \"to forge a mature relationship\" with Todd and refused to leave until he took care of that. He asked her to avert her eyes while he got out of bed and got dressed, and he suggested they hold the conversation off for a few years. She wanted to know how Sam would be integrated into the family. When he tried to put her off, she grabbed him in a quick movement, pinning him to the wall. She threatened to hurt him if he hurt her daughter and didn't listen to her immediately. \n\n\nTodd gave in, and Addie stated that she wanted Blair to have happiness and success. She loved Todd, as Blair did, but thought that Blair was not the most important thing in Todd's life. Todd was quick to disagree, pointing out that when he had said otherwise in the past, he had only been lying. His wife and children were the most important things to him, and he would make the marriage work. She warned him again as Blair returned and was informed that they were \"bonding.\" \n\n\nDownstairs, Starr attempted to make plans with both Cole and Langston, who had the day off from school. Both of her friends were quick to make other excuses. When Cole put Starr on hold to answer another call, it was Langston. Both Langston and Cole told Starr they were speaking to Markko. Langston mentioned that she was meeting Dorian to work on wedding plans for Adriana. \n\n\nStarr encountered Blair in the kitchen and wondered where she had been, since she hadn't been in her bedroom. She wanted to know where Blair was staying in case of a future emergency. Blair announced that the marriage was no longer in name only. \"Congratulations?\" was all that Starr could muster. \n\n\nStarr said she thought the arranged marriage had been working out just fine, but things would be screwed up again. She said her parents were just too exhausting, and Blair agreed but wanted to keep trying for that happiness. She was as happy as she had ever been, she informed her daughter. She vowed to make it work. Starr discovered via Blair that Dorian had needed to run out of town for the magazine and so couldn't be making wedding plans with Langston. \n\n\nNatalie and Rex met for breakfast at the diner, neither of them looking especially awake. They said that between Jessica being committed and Rex learning that Wally might not have been his dad, it was debatable over whose evening had been worse. Rex wanted Natalie's help in finding his real father and asked her to recall anything at all from their childhood. The only thing she remembered were various uncles who had been in and out, but it was of no help to Rex. She said he should focus on his future with Adriana instead. \n\n\nNatalie reluctantly agreed to help Rex, though, since he'd always be her brother, and she was far too curious to not be involved. He suggested that they should look for something Roxy might have hidden at the hotel. Langston and Cole, who were actually there on the sly to plan a surprise birthday party for Starr, interrupted Natalie and Rex. Rex presented them with an estimate to have the doings at Ultra Violet, but it was beyond their means. \n\n\nLangston decided to go through Adriana, as it would be a big feather in her cap if she could get Adriana to reconcile with the Mannings. They all said they felt good about Starr's party. She'd also mention it to Dorian. As Langston and Cole shook hands on it, Starr walked in. \n\n\nJohn ushered Gigi and Shane into his small digs, and they tried to figure out where everyone would sleep until Ramsey and Marcie could be taken care of. John talked about teaching Shane some wrestling moves if he was disciplined and well behaved, but Gigi said she would prefer the nonviolent way of life. Shane was worried about his mom testifying at a trial for Marcie, but Gigi assured him that \"Morascos don't squeal,\" and she would refuse to sell Marcie out. John thought that Todd would help them. He advised Gigi to lock up after he left to see Todd. Later, on the prowl for food, Gigi remembered seeing a deli down the street. She told Shane she wouldn't be gone for very long. \n\n\nAt the police station, Michael tried to make a deal with Bo but was unsuccessful. Antonio removed Marcie's handcuffs, although Fish was entirely against it and stated it was not in the rules. Marcie was sure that things wouldn't work out, but Michael was insistent that a lot had happened, and she was back home, where everyone knew and loved her. Nora was not able to make any promises and mentioned that the case was always prominent on the Sun's front page along with the news that the entire school board had been forced to resign because they had hired Marcie as a teacher. Nora said she felt forced to prosecute, since the alternative was to recuse herself. \n\n\nMichael continued to be optimistic while his wife was the exact opposite. Nora and Bo watched Michael and Marcie and decided that they each hated their jobs sometimes. Michael assured Marcie that she hadn't lost him, but she asked to be taken to her cell. Nora wanted to speak to Bo, who thought it was not the time, as she showed him the coverage on the food fight in the Sun. He asked if she was \"planning on keeping up this nonsense with Clint,\" which threw her for a loop. \"Excuse me?\" she responded. He rephrased it, \"Are you going to keep dating Clint?\" \n\n\nNora pointed out that he hadn't said exactly that the first time. Bo said he wanted to speak to Matthew, but Nora thought that Matthew had an inkling of what was going on. Bo wanted to know why and what they had been doing. She thought there was definitely some tension showing even though Bo insisted he didn't care that Nora was dating his brother. \"You're in denial,\" she said. He accused her of starting the food fight, and they argued over it all. It was really about them, she told him. \n\n\nRex and Natalie went through one of Roxy's boxes at the hotel. They wondered if they were still Sam's godparents. Rex doubted it. He sent Natalie off to work, staying behind to continue searching. Suddenly, someone else was in the lobby, and he hid until he was challenged. \"Morasco,\" Rex blurted. \"Balsom,\" she replied. \n\n\nJohn walked into La Boulaie, where Todd thought John could be charged with breaking and entering.  \n\n\n",
