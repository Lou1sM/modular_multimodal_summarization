After stating that she had no knowledge of Todd's location, Blair joked about T\u00e9a and Todd's night of passion.  T\u00e9a was appalled by Blair's comment and asked when Blair intended to move out of Todd's home.   In an attempt to smooth things over with T\u00e9a, Blair related that Todd had missed T\u00e9a during her time in Tahiti.   \n\n\nUnmoved by Blair's friendly gesture, T\u00e9a informed Blair that T\u00e9a and Todd were working things out, and hadn't reunited.   Realizing that her presence might cause problems for Todd and T\u00e9a, Blair offered to move out with Jack and Sam.  After a long sigh, T\u00e9a announced that she didn't want to disrupt the boys' lives, and insisted that her only concern was Danielle.\n\n\nTodd arrived at Starr's apartment and an unforgiving Danielle greeted him.  As Todd tried to explain that he didn't want to upset her and that he wanted to check on Starr, Danielle slammed the door in his face.    After witnessing the scene, Starr stepped out in the hall to speak with her father.   Starr reminded Todd that Danielle needed time to process the revelation that he was he father.  Assuring Starr that he didn't want to pressure Danielle, Todd informed Starr that Mitch Laurence was on the loose and had kidnapped Jessica.  Todd stated that he had paid the girls a visit out of concern for their safety.  While Danielle listened from inside the apartment, Starr told Todd that she loved him and that one day Danielle would feel the same.\n\n\nOnce Todd had left, Danielle reminisced about the loving moments that she had shared with Ross, and was adamant that she wouldn't ever feel the same way about Todd.    When Cole entered the room with Hope, Starr introduced Danielle to her niece.  Danielle smiled as she became acquainted with the little girl.  Later, Starr announced that she would skip school in order to spend the day with her little sister.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was surprised when Todd returned home and mentioned that he had paid Starr and Danielle a visit.   Todd was convinced that Danielle would never accept him as her father, but T\u00e9a was adamant that Todd would play a role in their daughter's life.  Reminding Todd that Danielle would have to eventually enroll in school, T\u00e9a made it clear that the teen couldn't live with Starr forever.  Stressing that she had developed a bond with Danielle, Blair offered to speak with the teen, but T\u00e9a rejected Blair's offer.    \n\n\nPointing out that T\u00e9a had helped Starr over the years, Blair stated that she wanted to help Danielle.  Although Todd urged T\u00e9a to listen to Blair, T\u00e9a announced that she intended to deal with Danielle herself.    Later, alone with Todd, Blair offered to move out and give Todd and T\u00e9a their privacy.  Todd thanked Blair for her offer and stated that she was welcome to remain at his home as long as she wanted.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at the apartment and asked to speak with Danielle.  When Danielle criticized Todd for pestering her, T\u00e9a apologized for his actions.  Danielle was pleased when T\u00e9a announced that she wanted to enroll Danielle into Llanview High School, along with Starr.  Thrilled, Danielle rushed off to dress for her first day of school.\n\n\nInside the courtroom, Elijah smiled as he read Blair's text.  When approached by Marty, Elijah admitted that he was concerned about John's hearing.  Stating that Nora had left town, Elijah was convinced that the Assistant District Attorney was affiliated with Police Commissioner Lowell.\n\n\nLowell smiled as he watched a guard usher a cuffed John down the hall.  As Lowell approached John and joked about his impending doom, a clumsy janitor bumped into Lowell.  While Lowell focused his attention on the weird character, John wrestled with his handcuffs.  Once everyone had entered the courtroom and the hearing began, the clumsy janitor assaulted the officer that was standing guard outside the courtroom.   The clumsy janitor was Brody.  After rendering the guard unconscious, Brody stole his revolver.\n\n\nBack inside the courtroom, citing that Lowell harbored a grudge against John, Elijah asked the judge to drop the charges against John, due to a lack of evidence.  Pointing out that Mitch Laurence wasn't present, Elijah insisted that his client had a right to face his accuser.  Unmoved by Elijah's plea, the judge denied John bail, and announced that John would be transferred to Statesville Prison to await trial.\n\n\nAs a grin crossed Lowell's face, Brody burst into the courtroom and pointed his gun at Lowell.  Blaming Lowell for setting Mitch free, Brody insisted that Lowell was responsible for Jessica's kidnapping.  Brody threatened to kill the police commissioner, unless Lowell provided him with Mitch's location.   Both John and Marty attempted to reason with him, but Brody refused to listen.  Brody insisted that his life had no meaning without Jessica.   When a terrified Lowell maintained that he didn't know where Mitch was hiding, Brody pointed his weapon at Lowell and replied, \"Wrong answer!\"  As Brody fired a shot in Lowell's direction, Lowell quickly took cover behind John.  Grabbing his chest, John fell to the floor.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Rex questioned Stacy about her due date.  When Rex commented that he expected Stacy to go into labor any day, Stacy stated that their baby might arrive later than anticipated.   Appearing troubled, Stacy worried about what would happen to her once the baby was born.  Rex promised to continue to provide shelter for Stacy and their child.   Placing Rex's hand on her stomach, Stacy asked, \"Do you think there's a chance, there could be something between you and me?\"   As Rex stared at her in disbelief, Stacy wondered if they could be a real family.  Before Rex could answer, Stacy gave him a passionate kiss.  Pulling away, a nervous Rex stated that he didn't want to lead her on, and stepped away to place a phone call.\n\n\nAs Rex received an update on Jessica's disappearance, Stacy phoned Kim.  Insisting that something special had taken place between her and Rex, Stacy told Kim that she wanted to put their plan into motion immediately.   While Rex's attention was diverted, Stacy poured a glass of water on the floor.  Standing in the puddle of water, Stacy yelled, \"Rex come quick, my water just broke!\"\n\n\nAt the gun range, Charlie listened in disbelief as Dorian announced that she wanted to lure Mitch out of hiding by kidnapping Stacy.  Explaining that Mitch was obsessed with stealing Stacy's baby, Dorian related that Mitch intended to raise the child in his cult.  Convinced that Mitch would surface if he learned that they could provide him with Stacy's location, Dorian assured Charlie that neither Stacy nor her baby would be placed in danger.   When Charlie refused to kidnap a pregnant woman, Dorian reminded him that Jessica was in trouble and needed their help.  Charlie demanded to know what Mitch was holding over Dorian's head.  Upon learning that Mitch had threatened to kill Dorian's family members, Charlie agreed to kill Mitch.\n\n\nAt the Fort Osborn Geological Observatory, while Jessica lay unconscious, Mitch insisted that it was necessary to take measures to persuade Jessica to care for Rex's child as her own.  When Mitch announced that he planned to perform an electric shock treatment on Jessica, a nervous Nurse Charles cautioned that administering the treatment without anesthesia could result in memory loss or cognitive impairment.  Mitch stated that he could help Jessica understand her true calling once her memory was erased.   Unconcerned by the possible outcome, Mitch instructed Nurse Charles to prep the patient.   Hoping to discourage Mitch, Nurse Charles stated that she had never performed the procedure.  With an evil grin, Mitch declared that he intended to perform the procedure himself.\n\n\nFearing for Jessica's safety, Nurse Charles warned that a high voltage could possibly kill Jessica, but Mitch ordered the nurse to follow his instructions.  After Nurse Charles had prepped Jessica and placed her in restraints, a groggy Jessica awoke.  When a frightened Jessica asked what was going on, Mitch assured her that she would be fine after her treatment.  Terrified, Jessica promised to do as Mitch instructed, but Mitch insisted that he couldn't trust her because she loved Brody.  \n\n\nSmiling loving at her, Mitch declared that Jessica would be the perfect daughter once he administered the treatment.  When Nurse Charles pleaded with Mitch to reconsider performing the procedure without anesthesia, Mitch flew into a rage and declared himself the messiah.  Afterward, Mitch regained his composure and calmly remarked, \"Now shall we begin?\"  Meanwhile, Jessica whimpered uncontrollably.\n\n \n\n\n",
