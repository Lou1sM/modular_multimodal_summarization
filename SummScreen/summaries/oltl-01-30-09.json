    "soap_central": "\nDeath Becomes Her\n\n\nIn the courtroom, everyone was stunned when Starr announced that Todd had never admitted to her that he had planned to kidnap her child. Cole exploded and shouted at her, \"Why are you lying?\" The judge threatened to have Cole removed, but he continued to shout obscenities at Todd. Attempting to calm him down, John warned Cole that another outburst would land him in jail. Blair and Todd both watched as Starr struggled to conduct herself on the stand. Refusing to accept Starr's statement, Nora told her that she was committing perjury and urged the teen to repeat what she had told the court during the preliminary hearing. In tears, Starr replied, \"He said that he wasn't going to steal my baby.\" Nora turned toward T\u00e9a and Todd and exclaimed, \"What did you do to her?\" While Cole glared at Starr, Marty threw her hands up in disbelief. \n\n\nThe judge advised Nora to terminate her debate with T\u00e9a and continue questioning her witness. A disheveled Nora continued to urge Starr to recant her statement, but Starr insisted that she had lied on the stand during the preliminary hearing. She claimed that she had wanted to hurt her father. A teary-eyed Starr looked at Todd and exclaimed that her father was hurting the night she paid him a visit at the hospital. She maintained that he had never wanted to kidnap her baby. Todd demanded to know what T\u00e9a had said to Starr. Denying any involvement, T\u00e9a told Todd that Starr was perjuring herself because she loved him. Fearing that the case was damaged, Antonio whispered to John that he was leaving to bring Janet in to testify. \n\n\nInside her motel room, Janet checked the pulse of an unconscious Talia. Upon realizing that the officer was still breathing, Janet apologized for attacking Talia, and declared that she did what was necessary for her own survival. Rummaging through Talia's purse, Janet retrieved some money and expressed her regret at returning to Llanview. After collecting her belongings, Janet headed for the door. Exiting the motel room, a terrified Janet declared, \"I'm not sticking around and waiting for Todd or someone else to take me out!\" \n\n\nAntonio placed a call to Talia, but received no answer. Unable to contact Talia, he headed over to the motel. Upon arriving at the motel, Antonio knocked down the locked door and discovered Talia on the ground bleeding. Talia apologized for allowing Janet to get away, but Antonio assured her that it wasn't her fault. \n\n\nAfter warning Starr that he would deal with the perjury aspect of the case at a later date, the judge asked Nora if she wanted to continue questioning Starr. A disgusted Nora had no further questions for Starr. Nora asked the judge for a recess while her star witness was transported to court. As she exited the stand, a weeping Starr looked at her father. Blair asked Starr why she had lied. Cole looked at Starr with disgust. Cole couldn't believe that Starr would allow her father to get away with trying to steal their child. Crying, Starr apologized to Cole and fled the courtroom. When Todd tried to run after his daughter, T\u00e9a stopped him. John also prevented Blair from running after Starr. He said that Starr needed time to deal with things. Blair warned T\u00e9a that she would be sorry if Blair ever learned that T\u00e9a was responsible for Starr's condition. Blair then turned her attention toward Todd. She told him that Starr was suffering because of him. Todd insisted that Starr wouldn't suffer because of him. \n\n\nAfter receiving the news from Antonio, Nora alerted Marty and Cole of Janet's escape. Both Marty and Cole were discouraged by the news. Moments later, T\u00e9a overheard Nora telling John about Janet's escape. A smug T\u00e9a smiled at Nora. \n\n\nCole noticed Schuyler sitting in the hall of the courtroom. Cole approached the teacher and demanded to know why he had shown up at the trial concerning his dead child. Schuyler tried to explain, but Cole lashed out at him and blamed Schuyler's mother for killing Cole's daughter. Moments later, Schuyler received a call. He asked, \"What do you want?\" After receiving an answer, he replied, \"I'll be right there.\" \n\n\nWes stood outside of Brody's room at St. Anne's and glared at the copy of the Sun that featured Janet Ketring on the cover. Before knocking on Brody's door, Wes crumbled up the newspaper and tucked it away in his pocket. Carrying the football that he had received from Jessica, Brody greeted his friend. Brody told Wes that Jessica had been released from St. Anne's. Admitting that he missed her, Brody mentioned that Jessica had been the only patient that truly understood the turmoil that he was experiencing. Brody realized that something was troubling Wes and asked what was wrong. Wes presented Brody with the crumbled up newspaper. He told Brody that Janet had ruined his family. \n\n\nWes explained that during her days as Lee Halprin, Janet had seduced his father and convinced him to leave Wes's mother. After stealing his money, Lee had left his father. Too embarrassed to return home to his family, Wes's father had resorted to living on the streets. Wes had no idea if his father was still alive. He told Brody that Lee had disappeared off the face of the earth. Admitting that he had always wondered what he would do if he ever encountered her, Wes remarked that they were both in the same town. Brody pleaded with his friend to place his anger aside before it caused him pain. Wes thanked Brody for his advice and left. Alone, Brody picked up the football and thought about Jessica. \n\n\nAs Viki, Clint, and Jessica stood outside of Llanfair, Viki noticed that her daughter was troubled. Jessica told her parents that she worried that Natalie wouldn't be able to forgive her. Meanwhile, Jared and Charlie were caring for Chloe in the living room. Reaching for her daughter, Jessica was delighted to see Chloe. Moments later, Natalie appeared holding Bree's hand. In a sarcastic tone, Natalie acknowledged her sister. When Jessica approached Bree and tried to speak to her, the child clung to Natalie. Jessica asked her daughter to spend some time with her, but the child ignored her mother's request and asked Natalie to read her a story. As Jessica tried to become reacquainted with her children, Natalie made snide comments and ushered the girls upstairs. \n\n\nAfter Natalie and Jared had taken the girls upstairs, a devastated Jessica told her parents that Bree was afraid of her. Although Viki and Clint tried to reassure Jessica that Bree loved her, Jessica was convinced that her relationship with the child had been shattered. Jessica was also certain that Natalie hated her. Jessica believed that her sister would never be able to forgive her for allowing Tess to torture and nearly kill her and Jared. A few supportive words from Charlie gave Jessica a renewed sense of hope. As Jessica appeared to regain her self-confidence, Natalie returned and interrupted the discussion. When Jessica asked for a few moments alone with her sister, Viki advised against it, but Natalie assured her mother that they wouldn't \"kill\" each other. \n\n\nAlone with Natalie, Jessica tried to thank her sister for helping out with the girls while she was away. Natalie rudely remarked that Jessica had gone away because she had tried to kill Natalie and Jared. Jessica insisted that Tess was responsible, but Natalie reminded her sister that Jessica had admitted that she allowed Tess to surface in hopes that she would kill them. Jessica continued to apologize, but Natalie told her sister that she didn't intend to forgive her just yet. Natalie believed that Jessica was dangerous and still wanted her dead. \n\n\nJessica admitted that she needed Viki's help, and was instructed to remain at Llanfair as a condition of her release. Realizing that Natalie wasn't comfortable living under the same roof, Jessica suggested that Natalie and Jared move out. Natalie informed Jessica that she didn't want to leave Bree and Chloe in Jessica's care. When Jessica reminded Natalie that Bree and Chloe were her daughters, Natalie commented that she didn't trust Jessica around the girls and believed that she was better equipped to care for them. Natalie demanded that Jessica stay away from the girls. Jessica argued that Natalie had gone too far, but Natalie reminded her sister that she almost killed Bree and Chloe during her stint as Tess. Viki interrupted Natalie's rant and ordered her to stop harassing Jessica at once. \n\n\nViki chastised Natalie about her treatment of Jessica. When Jared interrupted, Viki offered to help Jessica unpack. After Viki and Jessica had retreated upstairs, Natalie told Jared about her confrontation with Jess. Natalie asked Jared if he thought she had gone too far, but he assured her that he understood how she felt. \n\n\nAs Marcie stood near Hope's gravesite and placed fresh flowers on the child's grave, she was startled to discover Michael standing beside her. Michael reminded Marcie that they were still married, and he also felt a connection to Hope. Marcie thanked Michael for understanding her loss. The couple expressed their love for one another. When Michael asked Marcie if she were going to Todd's trial, Marcie explained that she couldn't witness Todd get away with committing another murder. When Mike asked if she believed he would get away with murder again, Marcie stated that he always did. Marcie said that she would have rather had Todd steal Hope, because there would be a possibility of getting her back. Mike comforted his wife as she mourned the loss of Hope. \n\n\nLater, Starr lay at Hope's grave. She cried, \"I'm so sorry. I couldn't do it. I needed to protect him. I just wished I could have protected you, too.\" Nearby, Cole watched silently. Without a word, he walked away. \n\n\nThree hours later:\n\n\nT\u00e9a approached Todd's home and discovered that his front door was ajar. She entered and found Todd, twirling a bloody knife in his hand and kneeling beside Janet Ketring's bloody body. A look of horror crossed T\u00e9a's face.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr finds she cannot testify against her father. So, in court, she announces that Todd never intended to kidnap her child and she merely lied because she was angry at him. At that point, Nora realizes that Janet is her last hope. But after Janet has discovered the headline in the Sun where Todd has exposed her, she has escaped. And, we find out that Wes knows Janet. She slept with his father and took all of his money when Wes was a child. Meanwhile, Jessica returns home and is welcomed by everybody in the house except for Natalie and Bree. Natalie lays down the law to her that while being Tess, Jessica abandoned Bree and it's a miracle that Chloe did not die after Tess gave birth without going to a hospital since she was too concerned about blowing up Natalie and Jared to let them out so they could help her when she went into labor. Starr then goes to her \"allegedly\" dead baby's grave telling her how sorry she is and the dilemma of whether to protect her or Todd in the courtroom. Little does anybody know what really happened in regard to the two babies (Chloe and Hope).",
