It was Antonio, who'd put a lot into researching Talia's schedule so that they could meet and spend some time together. She had bad news, though; she was pulling a double shift to cover for someone else and would be working until 6:00 a.m. the next day. He had to be back in Llanview for his own shift at the same time. \"Nice hanging out with you for these two minutes,\" she told him. \n\n\nTalia agreed to administer a sobriety test at Antonio's request. \"I'm under the influence of you, \" he said, putting his arms around her and kissing her. He took it a step further and asked her to arrest him for resisting arrest so that they could spend even more time together. She thought he'd gone to a lot of trouble to see her, but she agreed, frisked him, and put on the handcuffs. She tried to read him his rights, but he stopped her. He already knew them. \n\n\nBlair tried to calm down a howling Sam but wasn't very successful. She promised him that things would get better. Dorian and Charlie arrived home, and Dorian asked about Charlie's meeting with Jared. He thought it was too late to be a father and that he should just walk away. Dorian didn't believe that Charlie should take such a major step, and she was sure that Jared really cared about him. She didn't want Charlie to surrender and wanted to help him fix things.  \n\n\nBlair walked through the kitchen where Charlie and Dorian were, looking for a cookie to help quiet the baby. Dorian voiced her disapproval, but Charlie quickly defended Blair. He even played with Sam and helped to distract the baby from his crying. Dorian took Blair aside and warned her that Todd would be banished from the house if he made any more moves like he had with Rex when he'd held Rex over the stove burner. Blair didn't feel sorry for Rex and advised her aunt that she would leave if Todd did, since she was married to him. Dorian wondered how long the marriage would last \"this time.\" \n\n\nAn indignant Blair grabbed the baby and stalked off. Dorian praised Charlie for his handling of Sam and pleaded with him not to give up on his own son. She recommended an A.A. meeting in town that he could go to, that her former husband had attended. She said she would like to honor his memory by getting Charlie and Jared back together. He again told her that he didn't want her help. \n\n\nLee went to see Todd and realized that John had paid a visit to Todd and threatened him. Todd said that he didn't have a choice; he either helped Marcie or went to jail. Lee thought that John was just setting Todd up to go to jail anyway and that he did have a choice, since they were in it together. He could guarantee Gigi's silence by eliminating her, and he wanted Todd to go along. They didn't want her testifying for Marcie or letting it be known that they had kidnapped her. He would also be able to return to the FBI. \n\n\nBlair interrupted Lee and Todd when she wanted to know why Lee was in their house. Todd claimed to owe him money; she wanted him paid and gone. She was angry about him firing his gun at Marcie while she had held the baby. Lee told her it had been accidental. When she walked off, he got back to Todd, trying to get Todd accept the plan of getting rid of Gigi. He would wait for a while outside for Todd to make up his mind. When Todd went outside, he suggested that the former FBI agent leave town. Todd wanted Lee away from his family.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Roxy and Rex fought over the piece of paper that he had found in her stuffed animal, Morris. Michael stopped on his way upstairs and said that he would be cleaning out everything that had belonged to Tommy and would donate it to charity before Marcie got home -- if she did. He wondered how his son was doing. Rex mentioned that he had seen the baby the night that Todd had manhandled Rex, and the baby had been doing fine. \n\n\nIn response to Michael's reaction, Rex reassured him that Blair had removed the baby from the room before the incident had occurred. He added that the baby would be great because of Michael and Marcie. Roxy tried to leave with Michael, but Rex prevented her from doing so. He hurt her feelings when he told her that if she didn't divulge his real father's name, he would never see her again, she could give up the tacky dress she had bought for his wedding, and she would never do Adriana's hair. He was a \"big boy now,\" he told her, and he was after the truth. \n\n\n\"Wally's not your father. It's Charlie Balsom,\" Roxy blurted out. She proceeded to tell him that he had arrived home with Wally one night, drunk, and they'd had a one-night stand. She knew Rex wasn't Wally's because he hadn't touched her in a very long time. She assured Rex that Charlie didn't know about Rex's existence. Rex was amazed and shocked. He told Roxy how Charlie had saved his life the night that Todd had been trying to harm him. He was anxious to share the news with Charlie, but Roxy didn't think it was wise. She would prefer to keep it between the two of them. \n\n\nUpstairs in John's apartment, Shane promised not to leave again without Gigi. John told Gigi that he had visited Todd and given him some options, and he had really enjoyed seeing Todd squirm. He asked if she had a problem with Rex because she should let him know if it happened again. She divulged that she had not only attended school with Rex but had dated him as well. \n\n\nMichael stopped by with the dinner that John had ordered, having seen the delivery boy wandering around. John revealed that his plan to help Marcie was progressing. Shane found the dartboard that Marty had made for John before she died. It had Todd's picture as the bull's-eye. Shane asked many questions about who had given the gift, and Gigi finally sent him on an errand to the other room. John admitted that it was still difficult to talk about Marty. After thinking about it for a few minutes, Rex decided not to talk to Charlie, but he was glad that Roxy had finally been honest with him. \n\n\nRoxy went to La Boulaie to see Charlie. She told him she needed his help, and it was a matter of life and death.\n\n\n",
