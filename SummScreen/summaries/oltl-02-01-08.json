After John explained his feelings over losing Marty, Gigi remarked she could never imagine how she would feel if someone she loved were killed. Shane overheard his mother's confession and questioned whether she had loved his father. John had a heartfelt talk with Shane about losing his own father as a child. \n\n\nAfter Shane left the room, John asked Gigi if she had told Rex to keep her living arrangements to himself. Gigi said Rex had been told that no one was to know that she was staying at John's apartment. She also told him that Rex had no idea she had a son, and Gigi would like to keep it that way. John agreed that it was best Rex knew very little about what was going on. He told Gigi that they could not risk Ramsey finding out her whereabouts. \n\n\nWhile visiting Bo at the police station, Rex told Bo that his life was over. When Rex began to reveal the reason for his visit, Adriana burst into the office and told Bo that Rex was in serious trouble. As Rex listened, Adriana informed Bo that Todd had nearly killed Rex. Moments later, Rex received a call concerning an emergency at Ultra Violet, and he left. \n\n\nLeft alone with Adriana, Bo admitted to knowing the truth about Rex keeping Sam's true identity from Todd. Adriana begged Bo to intervene. Bo warned Adriana that if Todd's hand were forced, he might do everything he could to put Rex behind bars. Bo offered to talk with Rex and warn him that it would be in his best interest to leave Todd alone. Adriana thanked Bo for protecting Rex. Bo told Adriana that he would do anything to protect Rex because Rex was like a son to him. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Roxy visited Charlie and told him she needed to discuss a life-and-death matter with him. Charlie was flabbergasted when Roxy asked him to pretend to be Rex's father. Roxy refused to tell Charlie why she needed his help but revealed Rex had already been told that Charlie was his father. Charlie told Roxy he could not become involved in her scheme. Roxy begged Charlie to reconsider and told him he had no idea what it was like to have a child hate him. \n\n\nCharlie tried to convince Roxy that Rex would uncover the truth. As Roxy told Charlie about her past relationships with men, he felt compassion for her but still refused to help. Charlie felt it would be unfair to lie to Rex. Roxy pleaded with Charlie to help her and even offered to give him her hotel. Roxy asked Charlie to consider her request and told him that she would lose Rex forever if he ever learned the truth. Once Roxy left, Charlie sat deep in thought. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora and Clint informed Jared he was being evicted because he'd had Jessica committed to St. Ann's. As Nora gave Jared one hour to pack his belongings and leave, Dorian entered the room. Dorian requested an interview with Jared to discuss his new role as a Buchanan. Both Clint and Nora were disgusted by Dorian's terrible timing and asked her to leave immediately. Jared told Clint and Nora he was not the only one to blame for Jessica's problems and reminded them that Nash had signed the papers to have her committed. \n\n\nClint told Jared that both his daughters had been through hell since Jared had arrived in Llanview. While Dorian looked on as Jared argued with Clint and Nora, Rene entered the room and demanded to know why Jared was being asked to leave. Rene appeared a bit startled at the revelation of Jared having Jessica committed but took Jared's side after he explained his reasons. Rene threatened to leave the mansion if Jared was forced out. \n\n\nAfter Rene's ultimatum, Clint and Nora allowed Jared to remain at the mansion. Before leaving, Nora warned Jared that he would have an uncomfortable time as long as he remained at the mansion. Left alone with Jared, Dorian admitted that she was a friend of Charlie's and would like for Jared to consider forgiving him. When Jared refused, Dorian told him that Charlie deserved a second chance from his son. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki and Nash watched lovingly as Natalie fed Bree. Nash was concerned because Bree missed her mother. Viki reminded Nash of Jessica's decision to remain at St. Ann's. Both Nash and Viki realized Jessica had had a reason for refusing to leave the institution but had no idea what it was. As the family discussed Jessica, Miles arrived and was surprised to learn his niece was at St. Ann's. \n\n\nEveryone was stunned when Addie entered the room, dressed as a chef, and inquired about what was going on. Addie mentioned that La Boulaie had become overcrowded; she told Viki about the residents, including a handsome stranger who Dorian had taken in. Addie thanked Viki for being so kind to Blair throughout the years. Viki was delighted to see Addie and told of her plans to visit Blair and Sam at La Boulaie. \n\n\nWhen told that baby Sam was a night owl, Viki stated she would stop by and see her nephew that night. Nash expressed his concern for Jessica being at St. Ann's, but Addie comforted him. She told him that St. Ann's had been her home for many years, and Jessica was safe there. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica played a game of chess with Allison. Jessica questioned Allison about Allison's comments concerning a Buchanan family secret. Allison made a point of telling Jessica about her family's past problems. Allison teased Jessica about her and Viki's mental health battles and the turbulent relationship she and Natalie had once shared. When Allison referred to Jessica as Tess, Jessica admitted she suffered with a mental disorder but told Allison that part of her life was over. Allison continued to taunt Jessica. Fed up, Jessica demanded to know Allison's secret about her family. \n\n\nWhile Gigi and Shane were left alone in the apartment, there was a knock at the door. Standing on the other side of the door, Adriana heard Shane call Gigi \"Mom.\" Adriana told Gigi her name and remarked about the little boy's comment. Gigi opened the door and told Adriana that Shane was her son. Adriana was stunned. \n\n\nAs Charlie sat and replayed Roxy's pleas in his mind, Rex stood on the other side of the door. Rex attempted to knock, but he began to hear Roxy's voice beg him to leave the situation alone. Rex walked away. Seconds later, the doorbell rang. Charlie opened the door, and Viki stood there. Both Viki and Charlie were in complete shock. Meanwhile, Rex visited Bo again and said he needed advice concerning his father. \n\n\nMiles told Natalie that he still felt uncomfortable around Viki because of the trouble he had caused. Nash and Natalie told Miles that Mitch Laurence had caused the Buchanan family problems, not Miles. Natalie reflected on how successful her family had been at getting past all the heartbreak. Natalie told Nash that she and Jessica never thought about the fact that they had different fathers. Nash added that Jessica considered Clint her father in every way. \n\n\nBack at St. Ann's, Allison told Jessica the secret concerned her father. When Jessica assumed Allison was referring to Clint, Allison informed Jessica she was speaking of Jessica's real father -- the great Mitch Laurence. Jessica told Allison that Mitch was dead and could no longer hurt anyone. Allison told Jessica that Mitch might be dead, but the secret hadn't died with him; it was very much alive.  \n\n\n",
