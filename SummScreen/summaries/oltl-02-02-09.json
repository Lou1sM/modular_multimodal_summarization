Nora was certain that her case against Todd would be damaged without Lee's testimony. Antonio assured them that Lee couldn't have gotten far. \n\n\nBo received a call and was given a tip concerning Lee, but soon realized that he had been given false information. Bo believed that someone was deliberately trying to point him in the wrong direction. He suspected that Lee might seek out Todd in hopes of obtaining money for her getaway. \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a entered Todd's home, she discovered him twirling a bloody knife and kneeling over Lee's dead body. Todd exclaimed, \"She's dead!\" A frightened T\u00e9a asked if Todd had murdered Lee. Todd divulged that he had returned home and found his door opened. Inside, he discovered Lee had been stabbed to death. He stated that he picked up the murder weapon out of shock, but assured her that he hadn't murdered Lee, although he wished that he had. T\u00e9a insisted on calling the police, but Todd reminded her that no one would believe that he was innocent of the crime. T\u00e9a agreed that Todd would be considered the prime suspect. \n\n\nTodd insinuated that T\u00e9a might have committed the murder because she believed that Lee could possibly cause her to lose a case. T\u00e9a denied that she could murder anyone, but accepted blame for encouraging Todd to publish the damaging article concerning Lee's crimes. T\u00e9a feared that one of Lee's past victims had killed her out of revenge. Picking up her cell phone, T\u00e9a attempted to phone the police but Todd stopped her. He announced that he wanted her help in dumping Lee's body where the body would never be found. A terrified T\u00e9a tried to reason with him, but Todd was determined to conceal the crime. As Todd headed upstairs to make plans, T\u00e9a phoned Antonio. Todd overheard T\u00e9a informing Antonio that Lee had been discovered at Todd's home. Feeling betrayed, Todd grabbed T\u00e9a and demanded to know why she had turned against him. Todd made an attempt to flee, but T\u00e9a instructed him to shut up and do exactly as she asked. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston checked in on Starr. Langston was concerned when Starr insisted that she had betrayed Cole. Starr told Langston that she had learned that Todd had attempted suicide. She revealed that she had wrestled with the guilt over sending her father to prison. Admitting that she had needed someone to talk to, Starr told her friend that she had discussed her fear of testifying against her father with Mr. Joplin. Because Schuyler had lost his mother, Starr claimed that he understood her dilemma. Langston couldn't understand why Starr hadn't confided in her, and asked her friend about her experience on the witness stand earlier. Langston was outraged when she learned that Starr had lied about Todd's intention to steal her baby. Starr pleaded with Langston to understand her need to protect her father, but Langston expressed her belief that Todd would do anything to avoid prison. \n\n\nLangston reminded Starr that she had committed perjury, and warned her that Nora might possibly make her pay, but Starr didn't believe that Nora would seek revenge against her. Before storming off, Langston told Starr that Todd had caused pain to everyone - even Starr's own child. \n\n\nMarkko found Cole drinking a beer in Angel Square Park. Realizing that his friend was in great pain, Markko offered to take him home, but Cole replied, \"I can't go home after what I've done!\" When Markko pressed the issue, Cole admitted to taking painkillers. Markko suddenly recalled several instances in which he observed Cole in the presence of Asher, the school drug pusher. Believing that Markko was judging him, Cole accused his friend of interfering. Markko assured Cole that he had no intention of reporting him. He only wanted to be a friend. Cole admitted that he had entertained the thought of purchasing a gun and killing Todd. He said that he didn't care if he had hurt Todd or the person who had helped him commit the crime against his mother and child. Cole stated that someone still needed to pay for his pain. When Markko expressed his fear over Cole seeking revenge, Cole held up his bag of pills and replied, \"I don't need revenge because I have these!\" \n\n\nMarkko wondered if Cole would continue his drug use if the problems in his life grew worse. A troubled Cole pointed in the direction of the Angel Square Hotel and stated that his mother would rather spend time with a stranger than with her son. Markko pleaded with his friend to think about his future, and finally convinced Cole to allow Markko to drive him home. \n\n\nSchuyler visited his mother's grave. Grasping the letter that she had written before her death, Schuyler spoke to his dead mother. He acknowledged that she had allowed Todd to blackmail her in an attempt to protect him. Schuyler was determined to protect his mother's reputation. Schuyler read his mother's letter. Dr. Joplin revealed to her son that Lee Halpern was an accomplice to the crime, and believed that Lee had more knowledge of Todd's wrongdoings than she did. He said that Todd deserved to pay for his crime, but not at the expense of Schuyler's mother. Vowing to keep his mother's secret, Schuyler insisted that the only person who knew of his mother's involvement would never tell. Schuyler maintained that the only witness was gone, and the only thing that could implicate Todd was the letter. Schuyler received a call from Starr. She thanked him for his help and for understanding her need to protect her father. Afterward, Schuyler lit a flame to his mother's letter and watched as it turned to ashes. \n\n\nAppearing defeated, Marty entered Wes's apartment and picked up a bottle of liquor. Wes prevented her from taking a drink and asked what was bothering her. When Marty revealed that Lee Halpern had escaped, Wes wondered if the police had any leads concerning her whereabouts. After Marty told him that Starr had recanted her testimony, Wes informed Marty that he had a confession to make. Wes revealed his connection to Lee. Although stunned by Wes's revelation, Marty realized that they shared many things in common. \n\n\nMarty was surprised when Wes related that Lee could never hurt either of them again. Wes said that Lee had a habit of finding a victim and causing pain to the person. Marty revealed that she had paid Lee a visit. She said that Lee had assured her that she wanted to testify against Todd and put him behind bars. When Wes told her that she couldn't believe Lee, Marty related that she did believe Lee. With a look of sadness, Marty recalled that she had also believed Todd. She then insisted that she had a bad habit of trusting the wrong people. Marty expressed her fear that Todd would get away with yet another crime. Wes told Marty that people always got what they deserved, and insisted that there were other ways to hurt someone other than putting them in jail. Wes told Marty that she was a good person and insisted that good people always won in the end. \n\n\nWhen Marty tried to take a drink, Wes stopped her. She asked, \"How am I going to feel better?\" Attempting to kiss her, Wes remarked that he wished that he could take away Marty's pain. \n\n\nBack at the station, Nora and Bo waited to hear from Antonio and Talia. \n\n\nInside Todd's house, T\u00e9a held the bloody knife and smeared the blood across her hands and face. Todd was unsure of T\u00e9a's plan, but she told him to trust her. Meanwhile, Antonio and Talia arrived and rang the doorbell. When Todd opened the door, Antonio and Talia were shocked by what they witnessed. Covered in blood and holding the murder weapon, a teary-eyed T\u00e9a exclaimed, \"Lee Halpern is here and I killed her!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Langston admits to Starr that she is very disappointed in her for lying in court to protect Todd. Starr tells Langston she does not understand. Only \"Mr. J\" does. Yet she doesn't tell Langston just how she knows that Schuyler Joplin (Mr. J) is \"in the same boat\" as her the way nobody else is. Schuyler goes to his mother's grave and asks her what he is supposed to do and why she did not tell him that Todd blackmailed her by threatening to expose her son if she did not help him kidnap Starr's baby. After Janet has been murdered in Todd's living room and it looks like he did it, Tea comes and asks him what happened. They are both suspects for the dead body. But there is another suspect who is Wes. He admits to Marty that Janet was his father's mistress. She ruined his family and took all Wes's father's money. And Wes is very angry at her. It looks like Todd may have gotten away with intending to kidnap Starr's baby since she has refused to incriminate him in court. But the murder of Janet incriminates both him and Tea.",
