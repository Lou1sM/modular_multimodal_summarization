He was in the midst of firing one of his private investigators who had no luck in locating Jessica. T\u00e9a cheerfully informed him that Dani had been registered for classes at Llanview High School and was \"in good hands\" with her big sister. Todd regretted stopping at Starr's apartment, and T\u00e9a commended him for developing a conscience. He didn't think it was good enough to just regret his past actions, but T\u00e9a felt certain that Dani would forgive him in time.\n\n\nTodd was uneasy and explained that he didn't know where he stood with either T\u00e9a or Dani. T\u00e9a thought that everything would be okay. She confessed that she had wanted to kiss him again. Todd was encouraged and, leaning over, kissed her gently.\n\n\nCurious about John's arraignment, Cole turned on the television for an update. He panicked when the newscaster announced that John had been shot and wounded during a melee at the courthouse. Cole advised Starr and Dani that he needed to get to the scene to learn more since his mother was there. He grabbed his jacket and left. The girls decided to concentrate on choosing an outfit for Dani's first day at school. Their brief discussion of John McBain marrying Blair turned to Todd and an impasse. Dani didn't want to talk about her father and his exploits again.\n\n\nStarr asked about Matthew since it appeared that he and Dani were more than friends. Starr declared that she had known Matthew since she was small and he used to follow her around. Dani was taken aback and admitted that it was hard to share her feelings because  she had always been alone as a child. She confessed that she and Matthew had kissed, but she hadn't heard from him since he saw her \"freaking out\" about Todd. He probably thought she was crazy. Just then, there was a knock at the door. It was Matthew.\n\n\nHe disclosed that there had not been any news about Jessica yet, and Starr turned to Dani with excitement. She had forgotten to tell Dani about the rest of her family members. She assured her that though Viki was Todd's sister, she was nothing like her brother. Jessica was their cousin. Dani was overwhelmed and admitted that she was still getting used to the idea of having two brothers. Starr made an excuse to leave the room.\n\n\nOutside of the courthouse, Marty taunted Lowell who wanted to know why Marty wasn't in the ambulance with John. Lowell realized that Brody and John had planned John's escape, and he urged his men to be on the lookout for the ambulance. He accused Marty of being in on the plan. She denied it, but Lowell ordered her arrest. Cole arrived and threw Lowell up against the wall.\n\n\nAn enraged Cole screamed and yelled at Lowell until Marty was able to calm him down. She assured her son that John was okay and the shooting had been staged. \"Cuff me,\" she ordered Lowell. The former mayor accused Cole of trapping his son, Justin, and making it look like he was buying drugs. Cole disagreed, stating that he had done it for Justin's own good. As Lowell hesitated, Marty asked how he would feel if Justin was in either Jessica's or Jared's shoes. She wanted to know if Lowell would have let Mitch walk. Lowell retorted that his first loyalty was to the law. Marty accused him of being loyal only to himself.\n\n\nShe warned Lowell that once he outlived his usefulness, Mitch would turn on him. She was certain that John would find Mitch and Jessica. Before she was led to a cell, Marty told Cole that while she hadn't known about John's plan, he had filled her in before he escaped. The paramedics on the ambulance were fellow cops in on the ruse. Cole planned on hanging around and assured his mother he would obtain a lawyer. She wondered who the driver of the ambulance was because the person looked familiar.\n\n\nJohn was aggravated when Natalie revealed herself as the driver of the getaway car. Brody explained there was no way to prevent her from being involved in their scheme because she was determined to help. John resigned himself and urged her to \"quit driving like an old woman and floor it.\" Brody disclosed that he had received a call from Jessica, but he had no further clue as to her whereabouts. John was worried that he left Marty \"holding the bag.\"\n\n\nBrody explained that Fish had given him a tracking device with a global positioning system. He had inserted the device into Lowell's phone. If Lowell spoke to Mitch on the phone, they would be able to find Jessica. Suddenly, a police car with its screeching siren began to follow the getaway car. As John shouted out directions to Natalie, he and Brody began to shoot out of the back window. Natalie seemed to enjoy the reckless ride as she called out, \"Eat my dust, bitches!\" She gave a loud whoop.\n\n\nJohn assumed that Mitch and Jessica were close since Mitch was most likely waiting for Stacy's baby to be born. Brody wondered why Jessica was taken, and John pointed out that it had something to do with the baby. Natalie added that Mitch had always been obsessed with Jessica.\n\n\nAt his hideout in the geological observatory, Mitch reassured an unconscious Jessica that she needed to sleep and rest up. He advised her that by the time she awakened, she would have forgotten all about her \"false family,\" and she would be able to create new memories and love Rex's baby as her own. He spoke of a baby's miraculous birth but observed that there would be no joy for the \"fallen woman,\" only anguish.\n\n\nNurse Charles revealed that Stacy had gone into labor and had arrived at the hospital. Mitch ordered her to get to the hospital because he wanted the \"vessel\" fetched and taken to the hideout. They had everything they needed for the delivery there. He wanted Jessica to be the first person that the baby bonded with, and he was hoping that Rex would join his \"true family.\" He told the sleeping Jessica that her heart would mend.\n\n\nIn the hospital examination room, Kim and Stacy were horrified to hear Schuyler announce that he had changed his mind about administering the oxytocin to Stacy. The women refused to accept Schuyler's decision, and they did their best to persuade him to follow through. Kim noted that they had no time to develop a new plan, but Schuyler didn't want to take the chance of harming his child. He added that he had intended to give Stacy the drug but, after having the needle filled with the drug in his hand, he had reconsidered. He wanted to tell Gigi the truth. \"Have you lost your mind?\" Stacy asked him.\n\n\nSchuyler was hopeful that Gigi would forgive him for sleeping with Stacy, especially since he had been drugged. The women taunted Schuyler, and Kim stated firmly that Gigi would never forgive him. As Schuyler held out his arm and began emptying the needle, Kim grabbed his wrist. She tried to wrest the needle from him without success. Kim was sure she'd be able to obtain more of the drug, and she berated Schuyler. She was sure he'd pay a steep price for confessing to Gigi, and if he loved Gigi, he wouldn't do it. Schuyler emptied the needle and tossed it onto the floor.\n\n\nSchuyler advised the women that he was heading up to Viki's cabin to be with Gigi, and he would tell her everything. Kim was sure that Gigi would be destroyed, but Schuyler thought that Gigi was strong. Kim thought that Schuyler would just turn out to be another typical guy to Gigi instead of the rescuing type, and he should think about saving Gigi, not hurting her. She yelled at Schuyler for stringing them along. Schuyler agreed that he wouldn't say anything to Rex, but he thought that Stacy should if she really loved him. Kim was certain she'd figure something out and advised Schuyler that he'd better \"step up\" if Rex learned that he wasn't the father. Schuyler assured her he would, and he walked out.\n\n\nRex ran into Gigi as he headed back to the exam room with Stacy's lollipops. He wanted to make things right for all concerned, but Gigi advised him he was \"a little late.\" They  moved into a nearby waiting room to talk. Gigi exclaimed that she knew the day would arrive when Stacy delivered the baby, and all of the pain was rushing back to her. It hurt to see Rex looking after Stacy when Gigi had been alone when Shane was born. Tears filled her eyes as she recalled wondering where Rex might have been so that she could have summoned him to be with her.\n\n\nRex acknowledged that he would never stop regretting that he wasn't there for her. Gigi advised him that she was \"alone and scared.\" She continued that things couldn't be changed, and it was no one's fault. She just wished that she had the best of him like Stacy did. Rex noted that while his heart was with his new baby, it wasn't with Stacy. It would always belong to Gigi. \"Stop,\" Gigi urged him.\n\n\nHer sister was having his baby and his feelings for her wouldn't do anyone any good, Gigi pleaded. She waited for Rex for years and while they had some perfect time together, they agreed that they also had a rough time. Gigi was convinced that Rex had put them out of their misery, and they were better off. She announced that she was heading to Viki's cabin. Rex asked if Schuyler was going to be there, too, and he wanted to know if Gigi loved Schuyler. Rex wanted to start a new life, so \"put me out of my misery,\" he told her. A tearful Gigi said, \"Yes, I love Schuyler.\"\n\n\nRex admitted that he loved Gigi and would never change. He disclosed that he felt the same way about seeing Gigi and Schuyler together as Gigi felt about seeing Stacy and Rex together. He only hoped that Schuyler was good to her, and Gigi agreed that he was. Gigi thought that things would work out, and Rex would be fine once he held his baby. He would love it from the minute it was born, she promised. It was a gift, and she wished Rex and Stacy luck and happiness. She walked out in tears.\n\n\nUnbeknownst to anyone, Nurse Charles entered the hospital.\n\n\nBack at Starr's place, Matthew admitted he had been worried about Dani but she assured him she had been staying with Starr and was fine. They both confessed to thinking about the other and as they began to kiss, Starr's phone rang. Apologizing profusely, Starr ran out of the bedroom. It was Cole who updated her on what had been happening at the courthouse. She shared the news with Matthew and Dani and headed to the bedroom again. Dani told Matthew that Llanview was \"off the hook,\" and she was happy to be there.\n\n\nJust as the pair began to share a kiss, Starr burst from the bedroom again. She had forgotten her phone. Matthew and Dani decided that it was a good idea to go out and look for something to eat.\n\n\nLowell received a call and was advised that the tires on the patrol car following the getaway car had been shot out. He began to make a phone call but changed his mind.\n\n\nIn the hospital exam room, Stacy worried about Schuyler changing his mind. Kim declared that she would go after him and talk some sense into him before he spoke to Gigi. She suggested that Stacy advise Rex that she had only had a false labor and she was going home. After Kim left, Stacy remained alone in the exam room. She reassured her baby that everything would be okay and that Schuyler would remain quiet.\n\n\nRex ran into Schuyler and advised him that Gigi had left for the cabin. Schuyler awkwardly noted that he wanted to get there before the snow. Rex made his way to Stacy's exam room but spotted Kim first. Angrily, he asked if Kim had left Stacy alone. As they spoke, Nurse Charles headed into Stacy's room.\n\n\nLowell couldn't resist and placed a phone call to Mitch. He advised Mitch that Brody and John had escaped. Mitch was sure that the men would never be able to find him. \"Gotcha,\" Brody announced in the back of the car as he watched the GPS screen.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr encourages Dani to believe that Matthew likes her and she is correct. He comes over and admits that he's been thinking about her and they seem to have mutual interest. Dani is not ok with knowing that Todd is her father however. And he's discouraged. Mitch has Jessica unconscious and believes she is ready to be the mother to Stacy's baby. Kim and Rex go with Stacy to the hospital. He still believes that Stacy is really going into labor with his baby. So does Gigi. But Schuyler, who knows what they are doing, tells them he refuses to go through with their plan. If it means Gigi finds out he got Stacy pregnant and she breaks up with him, he will accept that. Gigi admits to Rex that she is not ok with the fact that she had Shane all by herself without him and Stacy can have his baby with him there. She admits to Rex that she loves Schuyler. But he does not love Stacy. Meanwhile, Charlie and Dorian are trying to find Stacy and her baby in order to force Mitch to let Jessica go. But they cannot find her.",
