Marty didn't blame him, and said her relactance was because of Todd having taken advantage of her. She told Wes she wasn't ready to be intimate with anyone. Wes had another theory, however: he suspected she was hung up on John McBain. Marty vehemently denied his accusation, and insisted she couldn't stand John. She ranted about John's inability to separate the Marty he knew from the Marty she had become, and his constant attempts to keep her from living her life on her own terms. Wes was skeptical, and said that her passionate rebuttal just furthered his case. He challenged Marty to admit her confused feelings for her former lover, suggesting it would bring some peace to her chaotic mind. \n\n\nMarty was still angry that John had saved Todd from drowning below the Palace Hotel, but Wes said John had only done it because he knew Marty was not a remorseless killer. Wes told her John had done her a favor, and as a soldier, he knew: \"Killing changes people.\" Marty didn't agree with Wes's assessment of her personality; she said she was neither gentle nor law-abiding, and she was not the woman John remembered. Marty said that \"the new her\" was capable of anything, and that she wished Todd and Lee Halpern nothing but the worst in life. She admitted she felt a residual connection to John, but said there was no point in exploring it or reconnecting to those memories. Marty told Wes that she could not trust John or anyone the way she had trusted Todd and Lee, because it would only get her hurt. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Cole, still \"under the influence,\" staggered up to his bedroom only to find Matthew inside, ready to light up a joint. Furious, Cole snatched the joint out of the boy's hands, and threatened to bust him to his parents. Matthew pleaded with Cole, and said he'd only bought the joint to impress his would-be girlfriend, Becca, whose attention was being stolen by rival student, Justin. Matthew accused Cole of being a hypocrite for lecturing him when he was using pain pills. He warned that if Cole \"narced\" him out, he would expose Cole's own drug use. \n\n\nThe boys' stalemate was interrupted by  Renee's arrival, which forced Cole to hide Matthew's joint in his dresser. Renee chewed Matthew out for lying to her about his being grounded in order to sneak out and go to the concert at Ultra Violet. After sending Matthew to his room, Renee questioned Cole about the tension between the boys. Cole covered by saying that he was still angry about Starr lying on the stand at Todd's trial. When the topic turned to Lee Halpern, Cole muttered that Lee would get what was coming to her. Renee tried to comfort Cole, but he was still outraged by Starr's betrayal and said that their relationship would never be the same. After Renee exited, a stormy Cole impulsively reached for the joint that Matthew had left behind. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair paid a visit to Starr's bedroom to check on her daughter. Starr expected Blair to be furious with her after her performance in court, but Blair said she wasn't angry; she simply wanted to know why Starr had done it. Blair asked if Todd or T\u00e9a had gotten to her before the trial and influenced her in any way, but Starr claimed she hadn't spoken to either of them. Starr told her mother she couldn't have lived with putting her father in prison forever, and, in Starr's position, Blair couldn't have done it, either. Starr accused Blair of feeling the same ties to Todd that she did. Blair said she understood Starr's feelings, but warned her daughter that perjury was a serious offense. Blair reminded Starr that she would be in trouble if Lee Halpern were found and contradicted her testimony. She comforted Starr, and said she would always be on her side. After Blair left, Starr was surprised by a visit from Jack, who gave her back \"Freddy the Magic Frog.\" Jack told her he'd eavesdropped on her argument with Langston, and wanted to thank her for \"saving Dad\" from prison. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Antonio and Talia found the blood-drenched T\u00e9a's tearful confession extremely dubious. T\u00e9a insisted that she had killed Lee Halpern in self-defense. While Talia inspected the crime scene, Antonio grilled T\u00e9a on her story. T\u00e9a spun a wild yarn about how she had come to Todd's to go over the case, only to find a hysterical Lee brandishing a knife; T\u00e9a said that she accidentally stabbed the con artist during a physical struggle. Antonio asked T\u00e9a if she really wanted to go with that statement, and accused her of trying to protect Todd from a murder rap. Talia warned her that lying would make her an accessory to murder, but T\u00e9a turned it around, accusing Talia of negligence by allowing Lee to escape police custody. Antonio asked Todd about his alibi, and found it wanting when Todd repeated his story about going to La Boulaie to see Starr, but speaking to no one. T\u00e9a was adamant that Todd was innocent, and reiterated that she had killed Lee to defend herself. Antonio responded by promptly placing her under arrest as the forensics team swooped in to photograph and tag Lee's corpse. Defiant to the last, T\u00e9a told Antonio to get her booking over with, as she and Todd had court to prepare for in the morning. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler mused aloud to anyone who would listen about his mother. Behind the bar, John began to subtly question him about Dr. Joplin's connection to the Manning case. Schuyler told John that his mother was a good person and a devoted doctor who took pride in caring for healthy children. He said Lee Halpern's testimony would have destroyed his mother's reputation, but fortunately, Lee was \"gone.\" Just as Schuyler recognized John as the cop who had saved Marty from Todd's clutches, Blair arrived. She greeted John and Mr. Joplin, and Schuyler skulked away to continue drowning his sorrows. \n\n\nNearby, Gigi waited on Rex and Jared as they conspired about the \"David Vickaroshi\" situation. Rex related to Jared what he'd learned about Dorian's scheme, and explained that she had handed La Boulaie over to Moe before trying to get David to follow her example and sign any future assets over to a shell company. Jared didn't understand how Dorian could have learned the truth, but Rex suspected that Beaver Calhoun was involved. As Jared attempted to contact Clint and Bo, Rex tried to figure out a way to preempt Dorian before she could get control of David's newfound fortune. Jared reluctantly concluded that they had to beat Dorian to the punch by telling David the truth about his heritage before Dorian could take control of Buchanan Enterprises. \n\n\nBack at the bar, Blair asked John about Lee Halpern's whereabouts, but John told her there was no news. Blair continued to fear for Starr's future if Lee turned up and challenged Starr's perjured testimony, but John reassured her that Nora would not turn on Starr just to get to Todd. Blair agonized over the hold Todd continued to have on his children, and counted herself lucky for being free from his sway. John didn't look so sure. As John turned the bar over to Gigi for the evening, he exited with Blair, only to shoot Schuyler a final glance on their way out. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, David and Dorian descended from their triumphant pilgrimage to Llantano Mountain, with David luxuriating in the glory of nature as Dorian froze to death in a red hoodie. Dorian attempted to share in David's enthusiasm, but David saw through her act and asked her to tell him the truth about her sudden fascination with the Buddhist path. Dorian insisted that she had changed, and was desperate to find the same inner peace that he had. David was sure she had another motive, and Dorian admitted he was right; she was still in love with him. Dorian said she was following David on his difficult path in order to prove herself to him, and asked him if he didn't regret leaving her at the altar on Spencer's orders several years before. David assured her he regretted giving her up. Dorian emotionally explained that after losing Mel, she'd given up hope for love, only to find it again with David, and she wasn't willing to give it up so easily. Dropping to one knee, she popped the question: \"David Vickaroshi, will you marry me?\" \n\n\nStunned, David admitted his desire for his ex, but reminded Dorian that he had dedicated himself to celibacy. Dorian countered that the vow of celibacy was only for monks, not a \"traveler\" like David, and said that their love was pure and true. She told David that she respected his path, that she would be the one to change for him, and that their love would be the vehicle for her own spiritual journey. Urging him to allow them to \"walk towards nirvana\" together, Dorian begged David to accept her proposal. Struck, David told her he needed to \"meditate on it\" until morning, and promised he would give her an answer the next day. After he'd left, Dorian gloated aloud that she would soon be \"Mrs. David Buchanan,\" as a passing Rex listened in. \n\n\nA musical montage began as different citizens of Llanview faced the night: At the Angel Square Hotel, Wes tucked Marty into bed and brooded by the window, while John and Blair headed for John's apartment. When John paused outside Wes and Marty's door, Marty found herself staring back at his direction from inside. In his room at the Buchanan mansion, Cole raged about Starr, and stared mournfully at a cell phone picture of the two of them together. At La Boulaie, Starr lay on her bed with Freddy the Magic Frog, and was pleased to see a text message from Mr. Joplin asking how she was. She texted him back, thanking him for understanding, while Schuyler continued to sit alone by the bar at Rodi's. And at Todd's, the forensics team wheeled Lee's body out of the house, while Antonio and Talia escorted the handcuffed T\u00e9a away, leaving Todd to look on helplessly. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Many people are \"in limbo\" not knowing what will happen with Todd's trial or where their star witness, Lee Halpern is. Only Todd, Tea, Antonio and Talia know that Lee/Janet has been murdered. Marty and Wes talk about both of their association with this woman. Blair warns Starr that if they find Lee Halpern and she testifies against Todd with evidence, Starr could get charged with perjury. Schuyler Joplin is not certain what to do knowing his mother's involvement in Todd's attempt to steal Starr's baby, the fact that she complied with Todd in order to protect her son, or her untimely suicide. He goes into Rodi's and talks to John. Cole catches Matthew with a joint in his room. Matthew argues that he only smokes pot and odes not pop pills. Renee tells them both they need to shape up. Cole reveals to her that he has \"motives\" to get revenge upon Lee Halpern. It appears there are many suspects in the murder investigation of Lee/Janet. But Tea confesses to the murder. Antonio and Talia do not believe her but they take her down to the station. She still wants to represent Todd and win the case for him.",
