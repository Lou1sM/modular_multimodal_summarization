    "soap_central": "\nDesperately Seeking Stacy\n\n\n \nAt Todd's, Todd and T\u00e9a fell into each other's arms, but T\u00e9a pulled away from their embrace, unsure of where they stood after all their trials and tribulations.  Todd drew her back in, but T\u00e9a again pulled back.  Todd told her he wasn't sure where they were or what they were to each other anymore, but he knew he wanted to hold her and make love to her.  T\u00e9a admitted she still wanted him, and wanted to go to bed with him.  \"Deal,\" Todd cracked, holding out his hand to seal the deal.\n\n\nT\u00e9a laughed, but asked him if they were making a mistake.  \"Won't be our last,\" Todd replied, and with that the lovers dove onto the bed.\n\n\nAfterwards, Todd and T\u00e9a cuddled, and again pondered if they were making a mistake by reuniting so soon.  Reveling in their intimacy, they agreed that, mistake or not, they didn't care.\n\n\nAcross town, Markko returned to the apartment he shared with Langston, Starr, and Cole to find Starr on the phone with Cole, discussing Marty's bail.  After hanging up, Starr told Markko about John's escape from police custody, and how he and Brody had faked a shooting to evade Lowell's clutches.  The film geek in Markko lit up, sure it would make a great movie, and Starr suggested he get Langston to write the script; unfortunately, Langston was nowhere to be found.\n\n\nAs Markko went over his notes from his film class, Starr said she was surprised he still took something of value from the course despite Ford's presence.  Markko told her that Ford wouldn't stop him from learning about the craft he loved.  He was confident that the \"thing\" between Ford and Langston was a one-way street, with only Ford interested, and felt sure that with Langston rebuffing the older hunk, Ford would move on to another conquest.  Starr bit her tongue, as she remembered Langston's infatuation with the handsome teaching assistant.\n\n\nStarr asked Markko if he really wasn't worried about Ford at all, and Markko insisted he wasn't.  He trusted Langston; it was only Ford's overt advances that had worried him.  He recounted the incident where he and Langston had run across Ford while apartment hunting, and he was inadvertently forced to admit to Starr that he and Langston were looking to move out.  Markko assured Starr that, though he and Langston needed more space, they weren't moving out any time soon.  As he continued with the story of how he found Langston alone with the half-naked Ford, Starr blanched as she realized that Langston had kept the close encounter from her.\n\n\nMarkko was surprised to hear that Starr had never heard the story about their apartment search, but Starr downplayed its importance and said she agreed with him; it was no big deal, and Langston was devoted to him and only him.  Oblivious to her concerns, Markko bemoaned his lack of quality time with Langston since the new semester had begun, and said that she'd also been preoccupied with her latest musical.  Starr was still vexed that Langston wanted to write about her real-life story with Cole and Hope.\n\n\nAt Llanview University, Langston breezed into the film department and was looking for Markko.  Instead, she found Ford alone in an empty classroom.  Langston was surprised that she'd gotten the time wrong, but Ford didn't believe she'd made a mistake.  Putting the moves on the young woman, he suggested that arriving late to Markko's class had all been part of her plan to see him again.\n\n\nLangston laughed off Ford's accusation and refused to entertain a serious conversation about their kiss at Capricorn.  Ford said the kiss was passionate and exciting, but Langston claimed she'd only been caught up in the moment and the adrenaline of her birthday bash.  Ford didn't buy it; he suspected that, like him, she couldn't stop thinking about their intimate moment.\n\n\nLangston primly informed him that Markko was the man she wanted, that he was everything she'd ever needed.  Ford asked if that meant she'd told Markko about their kiss, and Langston admitted she hadn't.  She said the kiss wasn't important, and hadn't meant anything, so she felt no need to hurt her boyfriend unnecessarily.  Ford said that it had meant something to him; he'd felt \"consumed\" with passion for her, and he couldn't stop feeling it.  Langston was shaken by his words.\n\n\nFord told her that if she didn't want to explore the feelings their kiss had stirred up, then there was nothing else for them to say to one another but goodbye.  Langston grasped at straws, as she pleaded with him, and asked if they couldn't still be friends.  Ford wasn't sure platonic male/female friendships worked, but Langston was suddenly sure they could, just like the one she had with Cole.  Ford agreed to attempt a friendship if she wanted one.\n\n\nIn their first act as \"friends,\" Langston and Ford changed topics to her struggle with the next Llanview High musical.  Langston still wanted to write about Starr and Cole's fight to be together, but the real-life couple was having none of her plans.  Ford suggested that she could get away with it by changing their names and slightly altering the situation.  When Langston mentioned how little space she had to work at the crowded teens' apartment, Ford offered to let her use his often-empty office at the university, and handed her a spare key.  \"Works for me,\" Langston said, eyeing the key.\n\n\nLangston returned to the apartment, and greeted Starr and Markko in high spirits.  She apologized for missing Markko at the university, but said she'd gotten his schedule and \"everything else\" figured out, and wouldn't make the same mistake again.  As she kissed Markko, Ford's office key dangled from her bag.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Nurse Charles skulked through the halls, as she approached Stacy's exam room in the hopes of ambushing her quarry.  Entering the room, she found it empty.  Moments later, Rex and Kim dashed in and found it empty, as well, only with no sign of Nurse Charles, either.\n\n\nRex demanded to know where Stacy had gone, but Kim said she didn't know.  Playing for time, she told Rex that the doctors had discovered that Stacy was only in \"false labor,\" and suggested that Stacy had simply headed back to the loft.  Rex noted that Stacy's bag was still there, and said she wouldn't have left without it, or without telling either of them.  He called Stacy and left a terse voicemail, even as Kim attempted to allay his fears.  After heading to the admissions desk, Rex discovered that Stacy hadn't even checked out.\n\n\nRex was frantic with worry, but noticed that Kim's reaction was muted at best.  He asked her why she wasn't more concerned about her best friend, when she knew the danger Stacy faced from Mitch.  Kim said she was attempting to be calm and rational, but Rex suspected it was more than that.  Kim flashed back to her and Stacy's confrontation with Schuyler, and remembered how Stacy had felt there was no hope once Schuyler told Gigi the truth about her pregnancy.  Rex smelled a rat, and ordered Kim to tell him if she knew of another reason why Stacy might have disappeared of her own free will.\n\n\nKim sidestepped his question, and lashed out at Rex; she told him that he and his father were the same, and that both he and Mitch only cared about Stacy for the baby she was carrying.  Rex countered that, unlike Mitch, he would not want Stacy harmed.  Stacy knew Mitch was dangerous, and feared for her life; Rex knew she would not have left the hospital alone, unless there was some other, secret motivation he wasn't aware of. He pleaded with Kim to tell him the truth.\n\n\nKim admitted that she had no idea where Stacy was, and apologized for leaving her alone.  Agreeing that Stacy could be in danger, she told Rex to call his friends in the police department.  When Rex mentioned that he'd left a note for Oliver, Kim remembered that she'd tossed the note aside as they'd left the loft.  She ordered him to call Oliver immediately.\n\n\nLittle did Rex and Kim know Stacy was closer than they thought.  In the underground parking lot beneath the hospital, Dorian hurried Stacy down the stairwell and onto the sub-level, all the while assuring her that she was there to protect her from Mitch Laurence and take her to a safe place.  Stacy struggled with Dorian, and was clearly skeptical of Dorian's claims, but Dorian insisted that she was acting in her capacity as mayor of Llanview to get Stacy to a safe house where Mitch couldn't find her.  Stacy remembered that Dorian and Rex had a rocky relationship, and didn't buy that Dorian was helping a stranger out of the goodness of her heart; she was sure Dorian wanted to stick it to Rex.  \"Who cares?\" Dorian sighed, exasperated. \"Let's go!\"\n\n\nCharlie emerged from Dorian's nearby car, and demanded to know what was taking them so long.  Dorian introduced Charlie to Stacy as a member of her \"private security detail\" and said that all they wanted to do was keep Stacy safe.  Stacy wasn't sure that she should travel in her delicate condition, but Dorian said that, as a doctor, she could monitor Stacy's pregnancy.  \"No way are you a doctor,\" Stacy mumbled.  \"Way!\" Dorian shot back, and begged Stacy to accompany them before it was too late.\n\n\nSuddenly, Nurse Charles materialized behind Stacy, grabbed the girl, and trained a gun on Dorian and Charlie.  Ordering them to their knees, Nurse Charles excoriated Dorian for \"betraying the Messenger,\" and asked her which of her \"Cramer girls\" would pay the price for her disobedience.  Dorian offered the nurse a bribe for Stacy, but Nurse Charles didn't put a price on her faith.  As Nurse Charles hurried off into the night with Stacy in her grasp, Charlie told Dorian to get in the car; they would follow Nurse Charles back to Mitch.\n\n\nSomewhere in the winter night, Natalie, John, and Brody were still speeding down the back roads of Llanview, on the run from the law and on the hunt for Mitch.  As the snow began to drift down, Brody cursed at having lost Mitch's GPS signal from his call with Lowell.  Using Oliver's borrowed technology, he managed to use his laptop to trace a peripheral \"vector\" on the signal, and narrowed it down to within five miles of a spot on Llantano Mountain.  John suggested they cross-reference the location with details from the forensic report on the letter Mitch sent to Jessica in order to find his location.\n\n\nAs Brody began his research, John worried aloud about Marty, who he'd left at the mercy of Lowell.  Natalie suggested he call Marty, but John told her he refused to put her in danger, either, and ordered Natalie to get out at the next gas station.  But Natalie refused to be shut out of the hunt; she'd lost Jared to Mitch and wouldn't lose her sister as well.  She was going with them to finish Mitch off, once and for all.\n\n\nJohn protested, but Natalie told him to shut up and help Brody with his work.  Brody said he didn't need the help, but backed down in the face of Natalie's icy glare.  \"Chicken,\" John muttered.  He reminded Natalie that Viki would be worried about her, but Natalie said guilt wouldn't work and promptly called her mother to inform Viki that they were searching for Jessica and would be okay.  After hanging up, Natalie told John he was out of excuses to get rid of her, and they were all stuck with each other.\n\n\nBrody was still looking over the forensics report, and again noted the trace elements of two obscure types of rock that were found on Mitch's letter; neither rock was from the United States, which suggested that Mitch's location had to be near a place where such unique minerals might be found together in Llanview.  John couldn't think of any such place and couldn't find it on their maps, then concluded that the location was unmapped.  Seized by inspiration, he remembered the search for Natalie in 2005, when she'd been abducted by Hayes Barber, and recalled that the search teams had discovered a decommissioned military geological station, the Fort Osborn Geological Observatory.  Checking their map, John said he could direct them to Fort Osborn, and told Natalie to make a wild U-turn.\n\n\nAs they continued to race up the mountain roads, John commended Natalie on a good driving job despite the accumulating snow and ice.  \"It's beautiful,\" Brody said, watching the snow fall.  He mused about how he and Jessica had planned a winter vacation with Bree in the mountains, and how Jessica had been making him a full part of her family.  It felt so normal to him, so everyday, and he marveled at how she accepted him as a good person despite his troubled past.  \"She saved me,\" Brody murmured, and swore that Mitch would never take Jessica away from him.\n\n\nElsewhere on the road, Charlie and Dorian were following Nurse Charles's car into the darkness.  Dorian wanted Charlie to speed up, but he insisted on keeping a safe distance so as not to tip Nurse Charles off.  Dorian reminded him that if the nurse got Stacy to Mitch, it was over, not only for their plan but for Stacy herself.  Charlie ordered her to let him handle things his way; Dorian's way had put everyone in danger, including Stacy, who he referred to as \"that poor girl.\"  Dorian scoffed at his sympathy for Stacy, and said that if not for them, Stacy would have no chance at all.\n\n\nCharlie said he knew she didn't care about Stacy; she was only worried about stopping Nurse Charles from reporting Dorian's betrayal to Mitch.  Dorian admitted that she feared for her girls, and Mitch's wrath.  Lost in thought, she wondered how an evil like Mitch was born, and wondered if there was a fate worse than death awaiting her if she crossed him.  Charlie said the only thing worse than death, sometimes, was surviving.\n\n\nDorian reflected on Mitch's latest return, and admitted that she'd thought she would be able to stop him by using the powers of her office; instead, he'd almost poisoned her girls over the holidays, and she'd had to find another way.  Staring at the Cramer family holiday card that Mitch had vandalized, she admitted she couldn't imagine losing one of the Cramer women, or losing a child, and asked Charlie how he was able to wake up in the morning.  \"Slowly,\" Charlie replied.  Dorian said it couldn't happen to her, and Charlie assured her it wouldn't, once they took care of Mitch for good; they'd find Mitch before he got to her girls.  Dorian thanked Charlie for aiding her in her quest.\n\n\nNot far ahead of them, Nurse Charles continued to speed down the road in her car, with Stacy, her prisoner, in the passenger's seat.  Stacy begged her to slow down, but Nurse Charles said that Dorian and her \"puppy\" were tailing them, and she had to lose their shadow.  She ordered Stacy to concentrate on her \"little boy,\" but Stacy informed her that she was having a girl.  \"That's not the prophecy,\" Nurse Charles declared, and called Stacy a blasphemer for suggesting that Mitch would not have a male heir.\n\n\nNurse Charles wanted Stacy to focus on her contractions, but Stacy said she wasn't in labor at all, and told the nurse she wasn't due for a month.  As the wheels began to turn in Nurse Charles' mind, Stacy asked if the woman remembered when she'd slept with Rex.  Nurse Charles said the cult had \"the chosen one's\" conception marked down to the hour, and Stacy said that she knew that meant that her baby was not Rex's, or Mitch's heir.\n\n\nNurse Charles didn't want to believe the truth, and told Stacy she'd examine her at their destination.  Stacy said Nurse Charles couldn't take her to Mitch, otherwise they would both pay dearly for the deception, but Nurse Charles said Stacy would be the one in real danger.  Just then, Kim called Stacy's phone.  Nurse Charles ordered Stacy to answer, but not let on where she was.\n\n\nKim asked Stacy where she was, and the frightened girl lamely claimed she'd returned home.  Kim called her on her lie, and said they'd checked with Oliver, who was still at the loft, where Stacy wasn't.  Collapsing into tears, Stacy told Kim she'd been kidnapped, and begged her to \"help me!\"  As she attempted to describe where they were driving, Nurse Charles grabbed her and began to wrestle with her for the phone.\n\n\nAs Nurse Charles's car weaved across the treacherous mountain road, Charlie, Dorian, Natalie, John, and Brody noticed the out-of-control vehicle in their paths.  Each driver swerved to avoid the other vehicles, but failed as the automobiles collided in a screeching crash.  In Charlie's car, the Cramer holiday card fluttered to the ground.\n\n\nBack at Llanview Hospital, Kim continued to yell into her phone as her connection to Stacy dropped.  Rex asked what had happened, and the tearful Kim told him that Stacy was in trouble.  \"They got her.\" \n\n\n",
