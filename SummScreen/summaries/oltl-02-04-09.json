She told him that she had been questioned about Lee Halpern's death, but was not charged with a crime. However, T\u00e9a didn't underestimate Nora. She expected Nora to come after her, with guns blazing, if she could build a case against T\u00e9a. Todd asked T\u00e9a if she regretted taking responsibility for Lee's stabbing. T\u00e9a was silent for a long moment before she softly replied, \"No.\" T\u00e9a said that she believed Todd was innocent. Todd pointed out that whoever killed Lee, intended to frame him. That person also knew that T\u00e9a's confession was a lie. \n\n\nMarty stopped by Rodi's before going to court. John was there to pour her a cup of coffee. When he realized that Marty had not heard about Lee's demise, John showed Marty the morning edition of the paper. Marty was stunned to learn about Lee's death and T\u00e9a's confession. Wes walked up as John and Marty were discussing the possibility that Todd had killed Lee. Marty was convinced that Todd murdered Lee to keep her from testifying against him. \n\n\nWhen John stepped away to take a phone call, Wes quietly thanked Marty for not telling John about his connection to Lee. Marty brushed his concerns aside. She told him that he could trust her. Wes reciprocated the sentiment. John stood nearby and watched Marty and Wes intently. \n\n\nWes walked Marty to the door as she prepared to leave for the courthouse. He told Marty that he hoped that Todd would get what he deserved. Marty appreciated his support. She promised to return to Rodi's after court let out. When Wes returned to his duties, John commented that he found Wes's reaction to Lee's death curious. John said that he had the impression that Wes personally knew Lee. Wes remained silent as he continued to work. A short time later, John called his friend Fish to ask him to run a background check on Wes. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint was shocked when Rex told him that Dorian intended to marry David to get her hands on the Buchanan fortune. He was only marginally relieved when Rex went on to explain that, from his point of view, David didn't appear to buy Dorian's act. Renee's entrance interrupted their talk. Renee was upset and guilt-ridden after learning of Lee's violent end. Clint pointed out that Lee had many enemies; there was nothing Renee could have done to save her friend. \n\n\nRenee received a second blow when Clint changed the subject to inform her of Dorian's scheme to marry David. Clint and Rex warned Renee that Dorian wouldn't waste any time throwing the entire family out of the mansion. All agreed that the best course of action would be to go to David with the truth about his paternity. Clint thought it was better than the alternative-welcoming Dorian into the family. \n\n\nDavid went to Llanfair to ask Viki for advice about Dorian's proposal. Viki didn't understand why David would be willing to risk his newfound inner peace to be with Dorian. David explained that Dorian was a changed woman. She had given up all her worldly possessions to show him that she was sincere. Viki burst out into gales of laughter over the idea of Dorian embracing David's new lifestyle. David was hurt by his trusted friend's reaction. Viki sobered instantly. She reminded David that Dorian had a long history of lying and cheating to get what she wanted. Viki was certain that Dorian had some kind of agenda. David was disappointed; he loved Dorian. Realizing that David had feelings for Dorian, Viki amended her advice. She told David to follow his heart, even if it told him to marry Dorian. \n\n\nShortly after David left, Rex showed up at Llanfair's back door. He was frantic to find David. At first, Viki was reluctant to say anything to Rex about David's private business, but when she realized that Rex knew about the proposal, she relented. She told Rex that if she had to guess, David went to see Dorian. Rex took off like a flash. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian left a message at the center for David. The message was: If you say yes, the world will be our \"illumined\" oyster. \n\n\nAfter she ended the call, Dorian strolled into her living room. She stopped short when she saw Moe and Noelle, dressed to the nines, being served breakfast by a Swedish butler named Sven. Her good mood evaporated when Moe announced that he would like for her family to move out of his new home as soon as they could. Things went from bad to worse when Moe revealed that he intended to rename the mansion \"La Maison du Stubbs.\" \n\n\nDorian's temper erupted. She ranted that Moe and Noelle were hillbillies who didn't have the sense to know that the new name that Moe had chosen for the mansion wasn't even proper French. Mid-tirade, David walked in. Dorian's attitude made a complete 180-turn the moment she spotted David. Dorian flashed a radiant smile as she told David that he had arrived just in time to witness her sign legal papers that would make the transfer of her wealth and belongings to Moe official. Dorian backed up her words by signing Moe's papers. At David's request, Dorian followed David into the foyer. \n\n\nOnce they were alone, David went down on bended knee to assume the \"traditional bow of acceptance\" position. Dorian was overjoyed when David told her that he would marry her. \n\n\nLater, Rex arrived at La Boulaie. In a combination of broken English and pantomime, Sven managed to let Rex know that Dorian and David had flown to Las Vegas to get married. \n\n\nIn the hallway of the courthouse, Blair talked to Starr about Lee's death. They were discussing the ramifications of Lee's death to Nora's case when Cole walked up. His anger was palpable. When Starr asked to have a private word with Cole, Blair seemed reluctant to leave her daughter's side. However, Starr insisted until Blair relented. As Blair walked into the courtroom, Starr turned to Cole. \n\n\nUnfortunately, nothing that Starr said managed to mollify Cole. He was furious because Starr had lied on the stand to help Todd's case. Starr tried to explain that she couldn't send her father to jail after she had discovered that Todd had attempted suicide. She feared that prison would give Todd the opportunity to carry through with his plans to kill himself. As they were talking, T\u00e9a and Todd arrived at the courthouse. \n\n\nIn the courtroom, Bo and Nora talked about T\u00e9a's confession. Neither believed that T\u00e9a had killed Lee. Nora was convinced that Todd was ultimately responsible for Lee's death. When Blair walked in, they shared their suspicions with her. Nora couldn't understand what would motivate T\u00e9a to confess to a crime that she did not commit. \n\n\nAs people began filtering into the courtroom, the judge arrived. He didn't waste any time bringing up Lee's death. Nora demanded that he remove T\u00e9a as Todd's counsel because of the circumstances surrounding Lee's death. T\u00e9a, meanwhile, asked the judge to dismiss the charges against Todd. Marty, who had walked in while T\u00e9a was talking, made a snide remark. The judge didn't appreciate Marty's outburst. He asked her to \"please be seated and silent.\" before he turned his attention back to the two attorneys. When they approached his bench, T\u00e9a pointed out that she had not been charged with a crime, so there was no reason for her to step down as Todd's lawyer. \n\n\nNora opted for a different method of persuasion. She turned to the courtroom to ask anyone who didn't believe that Todd was guilty of killing Lee and that T\u00e9a was covering up for his \"sorry ass\" to speak up. No one spoke up in defense of Todd. The judge was not pleased with Nora's stunt. Nora ignored his ire and asked for a continuance so that she could reorganize her case. The judge didn't think that Nora had a case against Todd. He ordered both attorneys to return to their places, then asked Todd to rise. When Todd stood, the judge rendered his verdict. He said that the state had failed to prove their case against Todd so he had no choice but to find Todd not guilty. Marty was shattered. She dropped her head into her hands as Todd looked over at her. \n\n\nNora refused to be thwarted. Disbelief rippled through the courtroom when Nora ordered the bailiff to arrest Starr Manning.\n\n\n",

Everybody is furious. John is concerned about Marty's relationship with Wes. But neither believe it's his business. David goes to inform Viki that Dorian proposed to him and asks Viki what she thinks he should do. She replies that she thinks his crazy to want to marry Dorian nor to believe that she wants to give up her life and lead a \"pure\" life. She tells David she knows that Dorian is up to something. Rex spies on Dorian and David for Clint and informs him that Dorian is determined to marry David before he finds out that he is a Buchanan. And he goes rushing to stop them but it appears to be too late. Dorian reveals to Moe and Noelle that she resents them taking over all of her wealth before David comes and accepts her marriage proposal.",
