    "soap_central": "\n Guilty As Sin \n\n\nAs Nora demanded that Starr be arrested for perjury, everyone looked on in disbelief when the teen was handcuffed. Nora dramatically pointed out that the girl knew right from wrong when she changed her story. She further accused T\u00e9a of silencing one witness and killing another, and wondered if there was anything that the attorney wouldn't do for her client, Todd. She added that everyone in town knew that Todd was guilty of murdering Janet, but she was placing Starr in jail instead, since Todd was exonerated from all of his crimes. Both T\u00e9a and Blair reacted strongly to Starr's arrest, protesting loudly. Todd spoke up quietly, asking the district attorney what she wanted. Nora was ready, responding quickly. She wanted a full admission of guilt from him, on every issue that had been covered in court. \n\n\nT\u00e9a immediately objected, citing the judge's ruling that there was no evidence to support Nora's claims in the first place. Exasperated, Nora pointed out how that was always the way with Todd, but she wanted retribution for Marty. She wanted justice for Starr's baby. She also accused T\u00e9a of making a mockery of the justice system. If Todd cared about these people, he would do right by them, Nora stated. She suggested, \"Look them in the eye and tell them what you did.\" Todd was momentarily pulled in two directions as both sides continued to argue about what should happen next. \n\n\nSpying the Bible nearby, Todd placed his hand on it and swore to tell the truth. His first declaration was to admit that what he did to Marty was wrong and he knew it all along. He got the idea when he first found her at Ramsey's place and thought that he could erase his sordid past. Speaking in a halting voice, Todd confessed that he thought about Marty and had hated himself every day of his life since their college days. He wanted to start over but thought only of himself. He praised her for the decent life she had created for herself and confessed how he had manipulated her by never mentioning any of that life. He made her feel that the outside world was unsafe, even as he told her she was free to go, he went on. He knew that she would never leave. She never got to make her own decisions about him because he never gave her enough information in order to make those decisions. He professed his love, but realized that her love couldn't be real, since she hadn't known the truth of their past. Even though she said she loved him, it couldn't have been with her full consent. Therefore, he knew what he had done to her was rape. \n\n\nT\u00e9a's attempt to quiet Todd was unsuccessful as he continued to talk. He ended by stating that because he didn't force Marty, he thought things were different. He apologized. A tearful Marty ran out of the courtroom with John in close pursuit. As Todd turned his attentions to Starr, she attempted to leave, not wanting to hear what her dad had to say. He yelled at her to stop. Reluctantly, she returned. He owned up to his plan of wanting to steal her baby, the reason being that he thought she would regret giving it up some day. He was planning on giving the baby back when she was ready to raise it herself, he clarified. He put an end to the plot but it was too late, as Janet had already taken the baby. He never expected the child to be sick, and would live with her death hanging over him for the rest of his life. \n\n\nAt the conclusion of Todd's confessions, Nora had Starr released. Starr shrugged Blair off, telling her mom that she needed to be alone. She saw Cole taking another pill out in the hallway. Nora congratulated T\u00e9a on beating the system again. Sarcastically, T\u00e9a asked if Nora wanted Todd to open a vein. \"Not close,\" she replied. T\u00e9a told her client he was a free man. He thanked her and tenderly brushed her hair out of her face. Blair lingered nearby. As T\u00e9a turned to go, Blair stepped up and slapped her. \n\n\nRoxy brought Shane to Rodi's for a lunch break and did her best to pry information from Gigi regarding the case that Rex was working on. She immediately guessed that it was for the Buchanans. In response to Roxy's questioning, Gigi replied that she knew about it because she was Rex's wife. She cut herself short before the entire word was out of her mouth. The conversation quickly turned to marriage, with Shane wondering when his parents would tie the knot. \n\n\nSeated on the airplane to Vegas, Dorian continued to impress David with her happiness regarding her new beliefs. David began a chant to promote positive energy on the plane while Dorian daydreamed of the day she would burst into the Buchanan mansion and toss its residents out the door. \"My future has never looked brighter,\" she informed her future husband. \n\n\nIn anguish, Rex made it to the Buchanan mansion and related that Dorian and David were on their way to Las Vegas to be married. He had just missed them. Clint's first thought was to stop the plane. As he put in a call to the airline, his cell phone began to ring. It was Dorian, who wanted him to know that she had fallen in love again, with someone who would give her everything. She added that her new man reminded her of Clint. Moreover, she also was feeling the thrill of winning. Before hanging up, she advised him to enjoy what he had while he had it. \n\n\nClint had a new idea after hearing Dorian flaunt her knowledge and actions under his nose. He made an enticing offer to Rex, betting that the young man would be able to stop the marriage using any means available. He would give Rex a bonus of $100,000 on top of his regular fee. Eyes lighting up, Rex accepted the proposal. \n\n\nReturning to his seat with a cup of tea for Dorian as she ended the call, David wondered who had been on the phone. While she thought maybe David was jealous, he informed her that he no longer had the capabilities for those types of feelings. She was happy about the rebound sex she had with him after she broke up with Clint, she explained, as he asked about her smile. He asked again about her phone call with Clint. Answering that David had inspired her, she had called Clint to make amends. David expressed how proud he was of her. He added that he really liked Clint, but thought the man was under too much stress by running his company. He felt that if Clint lost the company he'd get some relief. \n\n\nArriving in Vegas, the flight attendant congratulated the pair on their upcoming nuptials. David urged \"Mrs. David Vikeroshi\" to follow him off the plane. \"Mrs. David Buchanan,\" Dorian mumbled. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Bree sat and colored with Natalie while still ignoring any comments directed at her by Jessica. When the new nanny was summoned into the kitchen to take Bree and Chloe, Natalie expressed her displeasure. She could have helped take care of the girls, same as usual, she told her sister. Jessica reminded Natalie that Jessica was their mother, not Natalie. She felt that Natalie was judging her, and while she didn't owe her an explanation, she reminded Natalie that she needed to have therapy several days a week and needed the extra help. She felt that Natalie was making it difficult for her. She was grateful to both Natalie and Jared for looking after her daughters while she was away, but she had been declared well, she continued. \n\n\nNatalie assured her sister that while she and Jared made sure to keep their bedroom door locked from the inside, they were not going anywhere. They also would not let their guard down around Jessica ever again. While Jessica wanted to move on, Natalie revealed that she still had anxiety attacks every night. As voices became raised, Jessica yelled that the only thing she could do was apologize and state again that the children were not Natalie's. She accused Natalie of being cruel and driving a wedge between Jessica and her children. She was trying to be a good mother, she insisted. Natalie decided that Jessica had the same look about her that she did when she tried to kill Natalie and Jared. \n\n\nJessica insisted that Tess was gone, and felt that Natalie should stay out of her face if she didn't want to see Jessica angry. Natalie maintained that Jessica was lucky that baby Chloe was even alive, considering that she never went to a doctor regularly during her pregnancy. Once again, Jessica reminded Natalie that the baby was Jessica's. \n\n\nLeft alone, Jessica gave herself a pep talk, muttering that no one could take her children away. Looking up, she saw Starr standing in the doorway. \n\n\nRex stopped at Rodi's to let his family know he was leaving unexpectedly, on a \"search and rescue\" mission. Gigi confided that she had a bad feeling about the trip, as Roxy teased the pair. She urged Gigi to go with Rex, offering to watch Shane while they were gone. She'd even fill John in on Gigi's sudden job desertion. Gigi agreed to go and the couple departed. Shane and Roxy made a wager on when the couple might marry. Shane was happy to spend time with his grandmother. \n\n\nJohn followed Marty to the pier. Slowly, she walked to him and embraced him. \n\n\nOn the flight to Vegas, Rex felt confident that he would be able to locate Dorian and David and stop their wedding. He had his lucky charm with him, he told Gigi.\n\n\n",
