Near Llantano Mountain, Natalie and John's vehicle burst into flames at the bottom of the ravine.\n\n\nAs Charlie and Dorian trekked up Llantano Mountain, Charlie spotted Viki's cabin up ahead.   Charlie noticed the cabin light and was certain that Viki was inside.  Concerned for the occupants of the vehicle that had fallen in the ravine, Charlie insisted that they enter the cabin and call for help, but Dorian was determined to locate Mitch Laurence.   Reminding Dorian that her toes were frostbitten, Charlie pointed out that Dorian wasn't physically able to search for Mitch.   Dorian screamed, \"My girls are in danger!  We must find Mitch!\"\n\n\nInside the cabin, Gigi tried frantically to contact Schuyler, but couldn't receive a signal. Meanwhile, an unconscious and badly injured Schuyler lay inside his disabled vehicle.\n\n\nFighting the terrible driving conditions, Rex and Oliver drove toward Llantano Mountain.  Citing that the trip was a dangerous one, Rex offered to drop Oliver off at the next exit, but Oliver insisted on helping in the search for Stacy.  Rex thanked Oliver for showing concern for Rex's child, and the two men continued in the direction of Llantano Mountain.\n\n\nSchuyler regained consciousness and realized that he couldn't receive a phone signal.  Desperate to reach Gigi, a badly injured Schuyler stumbled up the mountain.\n\n\nInside Viki's cabin, Gigi became concerned when she was unable to reach Schuyler.   Gigi's sprits were lifted when she heard a knock on the door.  Hoping that Schuyler had made it through the snowstorm, Gigi raced to the door, but was shocked to find Charlie, who was carrying an injured Dorian Lord.\n\n\nAfter lying about their presence at the cabin, Charlie told Gigi about the car that had fallen into the ravine, and asked to use her phone to contact help for the injured parties.  Gigi related that she didn't have phone service at the cabin.  Convinced that Schuyler was the occupant of the wrecked car, Gigi grabbed her coat and announced that she intended to rescue Schuyler.   Charlie attempted to leave with Gigi, but Dorian insisted that it was crucial that Charlie help her locate Mitch and Jessica.   Reminding Charlie that Jessica needed his help, Gigi assured him that she would be fine and rushed out the door to find Schuyler.\n\n\nAlone with Charlie, Dorian insisted that her girls were in danger and pleaded with him to locate and kill Mitch.  Grasping the gun, Charlie promised to kill Mitch before Mitch had the chance to hurt Dorian's girls.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, while Viki and Clint awaited word on Jessica and Natalie, Todd arrived to speak with Viki.  After relating that Mitch had tried to blackmail Todd into convincing Jessica to accept Mitch, Todd stated that he wished that he had killed Mitch, and Clint agreed.  Shaking her head in disgust, Viki insisted that murder wasn't the answer.  Once Clint had left, Todd questioned Viki about Charlie's absence during her time of crisis.  After relating that Charlie left without an explanation, Viki recalled Charlie's vow to get Jessica back.   Viki stated that Charlie had acted in a strange and peculiar manner.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Starr tried to comfort a tense Cole, who was worried about his mother.  After Starr had finally managed to cheer Cole up, he received a call from Elijah, who stated that Marty had been arraigned.  As Cole and Starr headed off to pick Mary up from the police station, Cole related that he believed everything would finally work out.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Kyle was shocked when Kim informed him that Mitch had kidnapped Stacy, and that Oliver had joined Rex in the search.   Upon learning the news, Kyle placed a frantic call to Oliver.  Although the connection was weak, Kyle managed to make contact with Oliver.  Stating that the situation had spiraled out of control, Kyle insisted that Oliver tell Rex the truth -- either Schuyler or Oliver had fathered Stacy's baby, not Rex.   Insisting that Kyle's career would be in jeopardy, Oliver asked if Kyle was sure about his request.   As Kyle pleaded with Oliver to do the right thing, the phone connection was lost.\n\n\n As Rex and Oliver continued up the mountain, they encountered two wrecked and abandoned vehicles.  After searching both vehicles and locating identification, they were surprised to learn that Schuyler and Dorian were the registered owners.  Rex recalled that Schuyler had mentioned that he was spending the weekend with Gigi at Viki's cabin.\n\n\nRex was anxious to continue the search for Stacy, but Oliver suggested that they look for Dorian and Schuyler also.  Unconcerned with Schuyler's well-being, Rex insisted that Stacy was in a dire situation.  Pointing out that the wrecked vehicles were blocking the road, Oliver stated that they had to continue the search on foot.  Agreeing to look for Dorian and Schuyler along the way, Rex searched Schuyler's vehicle for a pair of gloves.  Rex was unable to locate gloves, but discovered a form inside Schuyler's car.  Rex realized that the document was Stacy's will.  As he studied the paperwork, Rex was stunned to discover that Stacy had named Schuyler the legal guardian of her unborn child.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Kyle was speechless when an anxious Roxy arrived at the hospital with balloons and announced that she wanted to congratulate Rex on the birth of his child.  When Kyle related that Mitch had kidnapped Stacy, Roxy flew into a rage and demanded to know where Mitch had taken Stacy and her unborn grandchild.   Upon learning that Mitch was holding Stacy captive on Llantano Mountain and that Rex and Oliver were on his trail, Roxy was consumed with guilt and blamed herself for the possible deaths of all the involved parties.\n\n\nFighting back tears, Roxy stated that she felt it necessary to clear her conscious.  Declaring that Rex, Oliver, Stacy, and the unborn child might die because of her, Roxy insisted on revealing to Kyle how Mitch had impregnated her.   Unwilling to allow Roxy to accept the blame, Kyle told her that he had a secret of his own to reveal -- Rex wasn't the father of Stacy's child.   After learning that Stacy had duped Rex, Roxy blamed Stacy for Rex and Gigi's breakup.   Gritting her teeth, Roxy snarled, \"That bitch is dead!\"\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Kim told Clint that Mitch had kidnapped Stacy.  Relating that she had left Stacy alone, Kim stated that she had failed Stacy.   Unnoticed, Nigel listened as Kim blamed herself for the kidnapping.  Afterward, Nigel approached Kim and offered her a cup of tea.  Nigel expressed his concern for Kim's friend.  Recalling how rudely she had treated him in the past, Kim was amazed by Nigel's generosity toward her.\n\n\nLater, as Clint tried to console her, Kim inadvertently mentioned that Rex wasn't the father of Stacy's baby.  When Clint asked her to clarify her statement, Kim lied and covered her tracks.\n\n\nAt the observatory on Llantano Mountain, as a dazed and confused Jessica stood nearby, Stacy tried desperately to convince Mitch that she wasn't carrying his grandchild.  Backing up Stacy's claim, Nurse Charles related that the results of Stacy's examination suggested that Stacy's child wasn't due for several weeks.  Enraged, Mitch grabbed Stacy by the throat and shouted that Stacy was of no use to him since she wasn't giving birth to the \"messiah.\"  To Mitch's surprise, Jessica stated, \"Father, stop!\"  In a slow and stern voice, Jessica remarked, \"God's creation shouldn't be killed for the sins of his mother!\"\n\n\nJessica, Nurse Charles, and a terrified Stacy listened as Mitch called out to the Lord.  Referring to Stacy as the Whore of Babylon, Mitch wondered how he could punish Stacy for her evil actions.   Suddenly, Mitch announced, \"I know what I must do!\"  Stacy asked if Mitch intended to release her.  Manhandling Stacy, Mitch thanked his daughter for showing him the light and proclaimed that he would allow God to judge Stacy.  Pushing her out the door and into the storm, Mitch declared, \"If you survive the storm, it is God's will; if you don't, then that is God's will also!\"  Stacy pleaded with Mitch to give her a ride down the mountain, but he responded by slamming the door in her face.\n\n\nBanging on the door, Stacy begged Mitch to let her back inside.  Realizing that she was safer in the storm, Stacy rubbed her stomach and assured her unborn child that Rex would find them.  Cold and frightened, Stacy trembled as she trekked down the mountain.  Moments later, Stacy cried out in pain.  Rubbing her stomach, Stacy screamed, \"This can't be happening!\"\n\n\nBack inside, Mitch recalled the Lord's promise that Mitch would raise \"the chosen one\" with his daughter, Jessica.  A bewildered Jessica asked Mitch if she would have a child of her own.  Instantly, Mitch received a word from God.   Bowing at Jessica's feet, Mitch announced, \"You will have a child to raise, and he will be my flesh and blood!  Together we will create the chosen one!  I will give you a child!\"   Jessica had no expression.\n\n \n\n\n",
