Blair puts the flowers in water and apologizes that the transition with Sam has been rough. She mentions that it hasn't helped that Todd has been distracted. He says he's been distracted by his dealings with Lee. He lies and tells Blair that Lee's been paid and sent packing. \n\n\nLee, in Todd's penthouse, unpacks a rifle with a nasty-looking scope. \n\n\nTodd opens the door at La Boulaie. Nora and John are on the other side. Nora says that John's been telling interesting stories about Todd. They enter and Nora tells Todd that without his testimony, she doesn't have much of a case. Blair comes downstairs. She is shocked to hear from Nora and John that Todd is planning to ask the judge for leniency on Marcie's behalf. John brings up Gigi, which confuses Nora and annoys Todd. \n\n\nLee is still playing with the rifle when there's a knock at the door. It's Markko delivering food from the diner. He recognizes a photo of Starr with Todd. \n\n\nBlair tells Todd that she would be proud if he went easy on Marcie, because Blair feels sorry for her. John asks what Todd plans to do. Todd says it's a big decision and stalls for more time. Nora, frustrated by Todd's refusal to answer, glares at John, who tells her he'll get it straightened out. \"Do that,\" snaps Nora, \"and don't ever drag me back to this house again!\" Nora leaves. John tells Todd that he plans to bring Gigi and Shane to the police station the next day and have them tell how Todd and Lee kidnapped them. John says if Marcie goes down, Todd will go down with her. Todd gets a phone call, apparently about the newspaper. Blair comes downstairs with Sam. John is all smiles to see the little boy. Todd leaves, and Blair wants to know why. \n\n\nMarkko, at Todd's penthouse, asks Lee if this is Todd's place. Lee pays him rudely and slams the door in his face. Todd arrives to find Markko at his front door, looking at a map. Markko introduces himself as Starr's friend and Langston's boyfriend. Todd tells him to get lost and goes inside. Todd tells Lee that Nora and John just double-teamed him, wanting to know if he'd go easy on Marcie. If he doesn't cooperate, Gigi is going to talk. Lee tells him not to worry. He reaches for the rifle and tells Todd that with his rifle, a fellow can \"tap a busy waitress from 10 clicks and disappear before you know it\". \n\n\nBlair tells John he shouldn't put much hope in Todd supporting Marcie. John thinks Todd will see the light by morning. John turns his attention to Sam, telling Blair he's beautiful. He asks Sam if he remembers his Uncle John, and jokes that he's still picking oatmeal out of the carpet. Blair asks if John misses him, and you can tell by his face that he really does. He goes to the door and Blair asks him to tell Marcie that she's going to love Sam as if he were her own. John leaves. \n\n\nTodd tells Lee that he would like to kill Marcie, but not Gigi or Shane. He goes further and tells Lee he's not going to let Lee kill anyone. \n\n\nFish declares the computer system at the Cherryvale PD \"a relic from the Mesozoic age.\" Antonio asks if he can recover the computer's files, telling the Chief that computers self-destruct when Talia gets near them. That's why they were in such a hurry to let her go. The Chief sticks up for Talia. Antonio and Talia plot that Talia will convince the Chief that she is a menace to the equipment, and Antonio will convince Fish that he wants a spot in the Cherryvale PD. Talia asks if Bo will take her back in the Llanview PD, and Antonio assures her he will. Talia next breaks the coffee maker, and tells the Chief that she's broken the thermostat, and that's why it's so hot inside the station. Fish recovers the lost files from the broken computer. Antonio suggests that Cherryvale needs a guy like Fish. Fish says he can't bail on Bo, and that he's too valuable to the LPD. The Chief discovers the phones are broken, and Talia tells how she was in the basement and knocked a mop handle into a panel, causing sparks. Fish packs up and heads for the door, and the Chief asks him where he's going, because everything is still broken. Antonio suggests that Fish stay in Cherryvale and Talia return to Llanview with him. The Chief says if Antonio can make that happen, his speeding record will be expunged. Antonio calls Bo and asks for a favor. Bo says he's lucky he's not getting fired for the stunt he pulled in Cherryvale. Bo says he'll make it happen, then tells Antonio one more thing. Antonio and Talia say their goodbyes to Fish, and thank the Chief for expunging Antonio's record. Talia asks what Bo had to say. Antonio says Bo recited the LPD guidelines about fraternizing to him. It means they can't do it, ever. \n\n\nAdriana arrives at the diner to meet Vincent and Layla. She shows off her new engagement ring. The girls start to work on Adriana's dress, and Vincent excuses himself. Adriana tells Layla that she thinks Rex has a son with Gigi, one he knows nothing about. Layla asks if Adriana asked Gigi directly about it. Adriana did, and Gigi denied that Shane is Rex's son. Layla says that Gigi might have good reason, like her possible jail time, for keeping Shane a secret. Layla tells Adriana that she has to talk to Rex about it. \n\n\nRex asks Charlie if Roxy told him that Rex is his son. Charlie agrees hesitantly. Rex is glad the secret is out, but observes Charlie's hesitation, and wonders if maybe he's not happy about finding out he has a grown son. Rex tells Charlie that he will get lost if Charlie tells him to. Rex says he's gotten on a long time without a father, and he'll be fine, but he looks sad. Charlie says he has it all wrong: he's not denying that he's Rex's father and that he's already told Viki about it. Charlie's still conflicted about the situation, though. Charlie says he's not trying to hurt Rex. Charlie feels bad about getting Rex's hopes up. Rex says \"no hopes, no disappointments\" but Charlie tells him that's no way to go through life. Rex says that Charlie's starting to sound like a dad. Charlie apologizes and Rex says not to worry, it's not his fault. He tells Charlie that it was nice having a father for 5 minutes. Rex asks why Charlie told Viki about their relationship and says he doesn't judge Charlie. Charlie says he hasn't always been a great guy. \"Like father, like son,\" replies Rex. Rex says they can take it slow and get to know each other. Adriana arrives home. Rex tells her that he and Charlie have decided to try things out and get to know each other. Charlie leaves. Rex gets excited, realizing that Father's Day is coming up. He's excited about the idea of his and Charlie's first Father's Day together. Adriana looks sad, and Rex wants to know what's going on. Adriana says she's been keeping something from him and she needs to tell him. She tells him Gigi has a son. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki asks Dorian why she is wandering around in Viki's bedroom. Viki tells her to go away, but Dorian wants to talk about Charlie. Viki's not interested. Dorian asks if Viki \"got lucky last night.\" Viki looks horrified, then shrugs and says, \"I know you're frustrated\" since Clint walked out on her. Dorian asks if Charlie shared his secret with Viki. Viki confirms that she knows all about Charlie's son. Dorian is surprised he took the risk, especially given the connection with Viki's children. Viki wonders why it should bother her that Rex is Charlie's son. Dorian says she's happy Charlie told Viki, who doubts Dorian's happiness. She asks why, and Dorian says that Rex is going to be her son-in-law, and when Charlie and Viki hear wedding bells, they will all be one big, happy family. Viki asks how Dorian conned Charlie into believing that she is a really nice person with good intentions, but says she should quit while she's ahead. Viki tells Dorian to go home and get a life. Charlie arrives. Dorian goes on about Charlie being the father of the groom. Then she invites them, effusively, to the Go Red Valentine's Ball. Dorian leaves. Charlie tells Viki that he talked to Rex. Viki is happy for him. \n\n\nBo and Lindsay arrive at the diner. He tells her he likes having her around. Markko takes them to Vincent's table. Lindsay thanks Vincent for keeping the gallery running while she was at St. Ann's. They talk about her living situation with Bo. Then the conversation turns to the project she's been working on with Vincent. Heart-shaped boxes will be placed around Llanview. People can write their secrets on a piece of paper and put it into the box. Donations will also be accepted for the \"Get It Off Your Chest\" fundraiser. Bo is happy that Lindsay is involved in work again. Adriana comes up to them and thanks Bo for giving Gabrielle's engagement ring to Rex. Lindsay is touched to hear this, and compliments Bo because he is an amazing guy. Vincent returns with one of the heart boxes. Layla asks what happens to the secrets people will place inside. Lindsay says they'll all be destroyed at the Go Red Ball. Lindsay gives Vincent a hug. Layla and Vincent leave. Bo and Lindsay trade sweet smiles. Bo tells Lindsay she has to lead by example and put a secret in the box. She asks why he thinks she has a secret and he replies that we all have secrets.  \n\n\n",
