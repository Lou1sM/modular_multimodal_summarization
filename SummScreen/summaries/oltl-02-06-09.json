To her surprise, Jessica turned around and discovered Starr standing in the room. Starr wondered why Jessica was afraid that someone would take her child away from her. Jessica explained that she had been away from her daughter for such a long time and often feared that she would lose the child. \n\n\nJessica apologized for stirring up memories of Hope, but Starr believed that her dead child was still with her. When Jessica inquired about Todd's trial, Starr stated that she had paid a visit to Llanfair to discuss the matter with Viki. After informing Starr that Viki was unavailable, Jessica offered to take her mother's place. Starr updated Jessica on what had taken place at the courthouse. Starr blamed herself for allowing Todd to get away with trying to steal her child, but Jessica took responsibility for it. Jessica told Starr that her alter ego, Tess, had knowledge of Todd's plan to abduct the child, but explained that Jessica didn't remember any of the details. \n\n\nWhen Starr mentioned that Lee Halpern had been murdered, Jessica experienced a flashback of the night she overheard Todd instructing \"Janet\" to be present in the delivery room. After hearing Chloe's cries from the baby monitor, Jessica excused herself to check on the child. Alone, Starr listened to Chloe cry and cradled the little girl's toy. Starr was delighted when Jessica returned with Chloe. The sight of Chloe made Starr remember saying goodbye to Hope inside Dr. Joplin's office. Upon learning that Hope had been taken to Dr. Joplin's office, Jessica had a memory of Tess pleading with her baby to cry. Jessica appeared troubled and confused. After allowing Starr to hold Chloe, Jessica remarked that Starr's interaction with the child seemed natural. Starr suddenly became upset. She handed the child to Jessica and ran off. \n\n\nJessica received a call from Dr. Levin. He requested that she pay him a visit as soon as possible. Assuring him that she was fine, Jessica promised to come right away. \n\n\nOn the flight to Vegas, Rex and Gigi discussed locating Dorian and David. After assuring Gigi that they would arrive in time to prevent the couple from exchanging wedding vows, Rex mentioned that perhaps he and Gigi might exchange vows of their own during the trip. Rex was surprised when Gigi informed him that she wanted to wait awhile before they wed. Gigi said that she wanted to have Shane with them on their big day. Gigi also expressed her regret that her parents would never attend her wedding. She informed Rex that her father had kicked her out of the house after learning that she was pregnant with Shane. Rex was appalled that Gigi's parents didn't support her during the pregnancy, and vowed that Shane would always have loving and concerned parents by his side. \n\n\nRex and Gigi arrived in Vegas. Rex believed that he had tracked Dorian and David to their hotel but was uncertain of their actual whereabouts. Rex noticed a poster that featured a stripper whose stage name was \"Gigi.\" As he teased Gigi about sharing a striking resemblance to the stripper, the woman in the poster stood nearby and observed the couple. Noticing a nearby wedding chapel, Rex grabbed Gigi and announced that they had located David and Dorian. Swinging open the chapel doors, Rex screamed, \"Stop the wedding!\" The woman from the poster continued to watch them. Pointing to his watch, a man interrupted her thoughts and said, \"Gigi, you're on in five.\" Realizing that she was preoccupied, the man stated, \"What's wrong with you? You look like you've seen a ghost!\" The woman replied, \"Something like that!\" \n\n\nAntonio, Cris, Vanessa, Lola, and Layla celebrated Talia's birthday at Rodi's. Upon overhearing Talia state that she wanted to learn the truth surrounding Lee Halpern's murder, Wes appeared extremely nervous. He continued to listen as Lola inquired about the knife that was used to kill Lee. Lola informed the group that her mother had also been stabbed in the heart. Angered by Lola's statement, Vanessa chastised the teen for bringing up her mother's murder, and reminded her that Ray was the culprit. As Vanessa ushered Lola away to discuss the matter in private, Layla commented on Vanessa's rude behavior. Cris defended his wife, but Layla suggested that Vanessa wasn't a good parent. Although Talia attempted to quiet her friend, Layla ridiculed Cris for marrying Vanessa and abandoning Sarah. Cris was relieved when Fish arrived and turned the focus of the conversation away from Cris. Fish related that he had made arrangements to meet John at the bar. \n\n\nWhen Fish learned that Layla had plans to attend the Go Red Ball, he asked her to save him a dance. A nervous Layla agreed. \n\n\nNearby, Vanessa demanded to know why Lola was being disrespectful towards her. Lola expressed her concern that Ray might be innocent of her mother's murder, but Vanessa continued to tell the teen that Ray was guilty. Vanessa reminded Lola that they had begun a new life with Cris. When Lola mentioned that Cris had only married Vanessa so that they could remain in the country, Vanessa informed her stepdaughter that her relationship with Cris had developed into something deeper. Insisting that she needed some time to herself, Lola asked to be excused. \n\n\nInside the courtroom, Blair slapped T\u00e9a. Blair was certain that T\u00e9a had caused Starr to commit perjury. Blair also blamed T\u00e9a for allowing Todd to escape prison time. She wondered if T\u00e9a had saved Todd because she wanted to sleep with him. Denying any involvement in Starr's actions on the witness stand, T\u00e9a suggested that Blair devote her time to keeping up with John's whereabouts and stop worrying about Todd. Realizing that she was striking a nerve, T\u00e9a remarked that Blair should be concerned about John's feelings toward Marty. After threatening to physically harm T\u00e9a, Blair assured T\u00e9a that she was secure in her relationship with John. Blair stormed off. \n\n\nMeanwhile, T\u00e9a received a call from Ray, who wanted to know if she had made any progress in convincing Lola that he was innocent. When T\u00e9a mentioned that she had been preoccupied with Todd's case, Ray reminded her that Todd's case was meant to be a cover for the real reason she had returned to Llanview. T\u00e9a told Ray that Lola had become suspicious of Vanessa and believed that he could possibly be innocent. T\u00e9a informed Ray that she was responsible for Todd being a free man and promised that Ray would receive the same result. Concerned about Lola, Ray asked T\u00e9a about Cristian's character. With a tone of regret, T\u00e9a stated that Cris was a great person. She feared how the Vega family would react to the news that she had been using them. T\u00e9a was certain that they would never forgive her. Before hanging up with Ray, T\u00e9a promised, \"I will get Lola to talk one way or another!\" As she turned to leave, T\u00e9a was startled to discover Lola standing nearby. \n\n\nAt the pier, John and Marty shared an embrace. Pulling away from John, Marty acknowledged that she was confused about her feelings for John. Still reeling from Todd's confession, Marty blamed Todd for ruining her life and lashed out at John for saving Todd's life on New Year's Eve. John explained that he saved Todd for Marty's sake, but she maintained that she wanted him dead. Marty became agitated when John remarked that she wasn't the type of person who would cause someone's death. As a frustrated Marty announced that she had feelings for John, Blair appeared in the shadows. Unnoticed, Blair listened to John and Marty's conversation. Marty told John that she didn't understand her feelings for him because they belonged to the \"old\" Marty. John urged her to express her feelings, but Marty insisted that it didn't matter because John was dating Blair. To Blair's horror, John announced that he wasn't concerned with Blair - he wanted to discuss the situation between him and Marty. Unable to handle her emotions, Marty pleaded with John to leave her alone at the pier. John reluctantly agreed and left. \n\n\nAs Marty tried to collect her thoughts, Blair approached her and demanded that she stay away from John. Although Marty assured Blair that she had no interest in John, Blair wasn't convinced. In an attempt to hurt Marty, Blair rehashed Marty's past as a party girl. Marty listened as Blair reminded her that she enjoyed playing the victim and hoping that someone would rescue her. Fed up with Blair's ranting, Marty stated that the men who rescued her obviously had a strong desire to do so. Blair warned Marty to back off and insisted that John belonged to her. In a snide tone Marty replied, \"Are you sure about that?\" Blair reached out to strike Marty, but Marty ducked and Blair fell into the lake. \n\n\nBack at Rodi's, John noticed a deep cut on Wes's arm. When John asked how the bartender had injured himself, Wes claimed that he had cut himself on a beer bottle while working. Moments later, John asked Fish if he had completed his investigation of Wes Granger. Fish presented John with a file of Wes's personal history. Fish informed John that Wes didn't have any criminal history and wondered why John was interested in him. John told Fish that he was worried about a friend that was involved with Wes. As John continued to search Wes's file, he was shocked to learn of Wes's connection to Lee Halpern. John discovered that Lee had seduced Wes's father and later cheated him out of his money. Lee Halpern had destroyed Wes's family. John stared at an unsuspecting Wes.\n\n\n",
