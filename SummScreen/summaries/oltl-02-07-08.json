Lindsay wonders if writing down secrets will make peace. Addie and Miles are there for a cooking class and pose for a picture that Lindsay snaps. Just as Addie gives Miles a kiss on the cheek, Roxy walks in. She's curious to know if there's any female in Llanview NOT after Miles. Addie assures her that they are just friends, having a similar background of being institutionalized. She's too old for him, she adds. The three women decide to add their secrets and donations to the box, but at the last minute Lindsay thinks it better that the \"secrets stay hidden.\"\n\n\nNash is curious to know what will happen the next time Jess decides to play Tess and tries to reinforce that there will be no more \"risky business.\" Nat and Jared show up at the vineyard at the same time which proves somewhat awkward. He apologizes for all of the business involving committing Jess to St. Anne's but she doesn't want to hear his apology, especially the part about him being her uncle. She has plans with Jess, who makes up a story about helping Viki with the Go Red ball. Nash discloses that he and Jared are now 50/50 partners in the vineyard, to which Jared responds that Nash deserves it. He apologizes again for what he did to Jess in committing her. The guys toast to their new partnership. Jared, full of compliments, tells Nash what a good man he is. Nash quickly agrees. He still has reservations about Jared being an asset to the Buchanans. Jared promises to make a practice of consulting his new partner in the future. After she receives a call from Allison, lying to Nash that it's her mom on the phone, Jess hastens Nat out the door. They are on their way to break Allison out of St. Anne's, though Nat is doubtful that it will work. She especially wonders about breaking in to get Allison back inside after the secret is divulged. Jess is sure that Allison's secret is important and this is the only way to hear it. \n\n\nRex and Adriana have a heated discussion about the fact that Rex could be the father of Gigi's son Shane. He can't believe that she even has a son or that she hid that fact from him. He admits that \"Shane\" was their favorite movie when they dated and according to Adriana, the boy resembles him a great deal. Rex recalls how they both left town though Adriana points out that he left first, possibly leaving Gigi pregnant and alone, which in turn forced her to leave. Gigi was always honest and fair and he would have stood by her if he had known, he insists. He still strongly refuses to believe that Shane is his and is sure he would have known about him if he was really the dad. He doesn't know why Gigi would lie, even now. Adriana points out how they are engaged which is why Gigi would have lied now.  Furthermore, Rex is going through father issues of his own, they've both had parent problems  and Adriana can't believe that he would deny Shane knowing his father. Adriana wants to know where she stands. Rex tells her that even if he is Shane's dad, it changes nothing. She doesn't want these questions hanging over their heads and no matter what the answer, it's all good. He finally agrees to see Gigi. \n\n\nJohn informs Gigi that Ramsey hasn't been spotted in Llanview yet but he's still working on Todd. When Markko arrives with a dinner delivery, he mentions the man that he met when he delivered food to Todd's penthouse. Upon further questioning from John, it's determined that it is indeed Ramsey. John heads out to investigate. Rex arrives shortly after. \"Adriana told you?\" Gigi asks. He and Shane eye each other wordlessly.\n\n\nAt Todd's penthouse, Ramsey does his best to try to convince Todd that Gigi and Shane should be killed. In fact, he wants Todd to be the one to pull the trigger as he's caught so many breaks, he'll be able to get away with it. Todd knows that the cops would look for them if the Morascos are found dead. Ramsey aims the gun at Todd and then out the window, demonstrating how easy it would be to shoot someone clear across town and no one would be the wiser. He talks about changing targets. Todd asks if his family is being threatened. He just wants to point out all of the options to Todd, Ramsey explains. Todd is sure his interests will be protected if he doesn't go against Marcie and nothing will happen to his family. \"You just keep thinking that way and see what happens,\" Ramsey says. He adds that if Todd doesn't do it, he will. Todd in turn threatens Ramsey. He tells him that he will kill him with his bare hands if he even goes near his family. Todd leaves and misses John by a split second. The door to the penthouse is open and John walks in. Ramsey, who is standing behind the door,  knocks him cold with the butt of the gun. \n\n\nAt St. Ann's, Jess and Nat, dressed as nuns, are on the way to getting Allison out of the institution. They are stopped by one of the resident nuns and Allison manages to invent a cover story, with Nat elaborating on it by her side. Nat is not too happy about going along with her sister's latest escapade and points out her own generousness. \"Keep polishing up that halo,\" Allison says sarcastically. They plan on making it look like she's in her bed before they can leave.\n\n\n",
