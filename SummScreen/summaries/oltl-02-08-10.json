    "soap_central": "\nFire and Ice and Brimstone\n\n\nThe lives of several Llanview residents lay in the balance on Llantano Mountain.\n\n\nOn Llantano Mountain, Stacy grabbed her stomach after experiencing a sharp pain.  Once the pain had subsided, Stacy told her unborn child that Rex would rescue them.  Stacy assured herself that everything would be fine if Schuyler didn't tell Rex that Rex hadn't fathered her child.  Nearly frozen, a helpless Stacy attempted to make her way down the mountain, but fell into the snow.\n\n\nNot far away, Rex discovered Stacy's will inside Schuyler's car and was shocked to learn that Stacy had name Schuyler the legal guardian of her child.  Noticing Oliver's strange reaction, Rex questioned whether Oliver had any knowledge of the revelation.   Rex tried to make sense of the discovery, but he couldn't.   Suddenly, Oliver spotted an object in the ravine, and he and Rex rushed off to locate any possible survivors.\n\n\nAfter completing their search, Oliver and Rex discovered that the charred vehicle didn't contain any victims.   Concerned about the passengers who had been inside the vehicle, Rex wondered who the car belonged to.  Relating that he had recovered a tracking device inside the vehicle, Oliver stated that it was the same device that he had planted inside John and Brody's vehicle.  Rex was shocked when Oliver announced that John, Brody, and their unknown getaway driver had been the occupants.   Unaware that Natalie had been the driver, Rex was desperate to locate Stacy.\n\n\nAcknowledging that Stacy's rescue was of extreme importance, Oliver stated that he was also obligated to make every attempt to locate John, Brody, the getaway driver, Dorian, and Schuyler.  While Oliver canvassed the area for signs of life, Rex continued the search for Stacy.\n\n\nMeanwhile, snow had completely covered Stacy's body.  As Stacy lay unconscious in the snow, Rex walked by and called out her name.   For a moment, Stacy regained consciousness and thought that she had heard Rex's voice.  Convinced that she was hallucinating, Stacy closed her eyes.  Meanwhile, Rex walked further up the mountain.\n\n\nA badly injured Schuyler struggled to reach Gigi, but had a difficult time trekking up Llantano Mountain.  After several failed attempts up the mountain, a near delirious Schuyler called out, \"I'm the father!\"  Afterward, he lost consciousness and fell in the snow.\n\n\nInside Viki's cabin, as Dorian sat patiently and awaited the news that Charlie had managed to locate and murder Mitch Laurence, an apparition of Mel appeared before her.  Mel chastised Dorian for convincing Charlie to murder Mitch.  Explaining that Mitch had threatened to kill her girls, Dorian defended her decision to persuade Charlie to do her dirty work.\n\n\nMel asked Dorian to consider what would happen to Charlie if he actually killed Mitch, but Dorian was adamant that it was necessary for Charlie to avenge Jared's death.  Insisting that Charlie wasn't a murderer, Mel expressed his concern for both Charlie and Dorian's souls.  Mel feared that Charlie would rot in prison, while Dorian went on with her life.   When Dorian promised to protect Charlie, Mel stated that the only way to protect Charlie was to prevent him from pulling the trigger.\n\n\nWith Dorian's gun in his pocket, Charlie wandered around Llantano Mountain and searched for any clues leading to Mitch.   Suddenly, an apparition of Jared appeared before him.  Insisting that Charlie was a good man, Jared criticized Charlie for contemplating murder, and suggested that Charlie reconsider his decision.  Charlie argued that Mitch had destroyed Charlie's opportunity to enjoy a happy life with Jared.  \n\n\nQuestioning what Charlie had to gain by committing murder, Jared related that Mitch's murder wouldn't bring Jared back.  Unwilling to put an end to his vendetta against Mitch, Charlie asked if Jared wanted to rest in peace.  Charlie hoped to receive a response from Jared, but Jared had disappeared.   Grasping the gun in his hand, Charlie declared, \"I know what I have to do!\"\n\n\nBack inside Viki's cabin, Mel managed to convince Dorian to talk Charlie out of killing Mitch.  As she headed out the door, Dorian exclaimed, \"I hope I'm not too late!\"\n\n\nInside the observatory, Mitch told Jessica that they would create a child together.  Mitch announced that the prophet child would unite them as a family.   Although she appeared dazed and confused, Jessica mumbled, \"I don't think this is what I want!\"  Mitch tried to convince Jessica that they loved each other, but Jessica was certain that she loved someone else.  In a stern voice, Mitch informed her that he was the most important person in her life.  Disgusted by his perverted suggestion, Jessica stated, \"You're my father!  This doesn't seem right!\"\n\n\nAs Mitch guided her to the bedroom, Jessica pulled away and ran to the door.  Banging on the door, Jessica called for help, but Mitch grabbed her and injected Jessica with a needle.  Instantly, Jessica lost consciousness.\n\n\nLater, as Jessica slept, Mitch stroked her face and attempted to kiss her.  At that moment, Brody burst into the room.  Pointing a gun at Mitch, Brody yelled, \"Get the hell away from her!\"\n\n\nJohn had managed to pull Natalie from the burning vehicle and relocated her to a safe dwelling on Llantano Mountain.  John tried desperately to revive an unconscious Natalie.  Once she regained consciousness, Natalie believed that John was her dead husband, Jared.  John was shocked when she referred to him as Jared and stated that she loved him.  \n\n\nFearing that Natalie had suffered a slight head injury, John tried to explain that she was hallucinating, but Natalie insisted that he proclaim his love for her.   Staring down at the frightened woman, a conflicted John told Natalie that he loved her.  John wrapped a shivering Natalie in a blanket and held her tightly to keep her warm.  Afterward, Natalie pleaded, \"Jared, kiss me!\"  John responded by giving Natalie a passionate kiss.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Todd and Clint sat with Viki and awaited word on Jessica.  Marty, Starr, and Cole arrived and offered their support.  Alone with Clint, Viki mentioned that Charlie was searching for Jessica.  Surprised that Charlie was attempting to locate Jessica alone, Clint wondered if Charlie was keeping something from Viki.\n\n\nMarty appeared stunned when Viki announced that Natalie was helping John search for Jessica.  Noticing his mother's reaction, Cole pulled Marty to the side and questioned her about her feelings concerning Natalie and John.  When Marty denied her concern about Natalie accompanying John on the search, Cole reminded his mother that John loved her.  Marty informed her son that John had never declared his love for her, but Cole insisted that John loved Marty.\n\n\nLater, Marty received a call from Oliver, who related that John had been in an accident.  After hanging up with Oliver, Marty informed everyone that John and Brody had been involved in an accident and were missing.  To everyone's surprise, Todd chimed, \"Everyone who was in that car is dead!\"  Clint and Viki stared at each other in disbelief.\n\n\n",
