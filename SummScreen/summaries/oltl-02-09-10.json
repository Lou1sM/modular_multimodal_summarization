It was mostly snow-covered and he excitedly rushed over to it. He was surprised to find Schuyler and not Stacy lying there. He awakened Schuyler, who jumped up and tried to hobble away from Rex. He was desperate to get to Gigi, but Rex told him it was imperative that they locate Stacy instead. She was in danger. Schuyler was angry when he learned of Stacy's kidnapping and reminded his rescuer that Rex should have protected Stacy. He agreed that locating Stacy was the first priority and that Gigi would have to wait. Suddenly they heard a noise.\n\n\nGigi was astonished when she found her sister in the snow and did her best to get Stacy up and moving. Stacy told her that she had been kidnapped, first by Dorian and her attempt at kidnapping, then by Mitch and the crazy nurse. As Gigi tried to lift Stacy up, she thought that her pregnant sister was hallucinating. Stacy wanted to sleep, but Gigi wanted her to move. Stacy mentioned that she saw a car, and Gigi thought it might have been Schuyler. He was on the way to tell her something. They stopped talking when they heard a strange sound.\n\n\nOliver wandered around the mountain and discovered he was in trouble. He was unable to find anyone, and no one responded to his calls.\n\n\nJohn kissed the unsuspecting Natalie as they lay in the empty dwelling on the mountain. He pulled away abruptly. \"I can't,\" he proclaimed. Natalie, still thinking it was Jared, told him how much she had missed him. John bent and began to kiss her again. Suddenly, he heard a sound. He thought it was a truck but realized he must have been mistaken.\n\n\nAfter the sounds that were heard, there was no additional warning. There was an avalanche and it appeared that Oliver was down. His hat was laying in the snow.\n\n\nAfter the avalanche, Schuyler thought that he and Rex should head for the road. Rex unsuccessfully tried to get a signal on his phone and yelled for Oliver. He wanted to head to the observatory, though it wasn't on the map. Schuyler was sure that there was no way up the mountain after the avalanche. The men found themselves back at Schuyler's car, and they climbed in. Rex noticed that Schuyler was bleeding, and he refused to leave Schuyler alone. He wanted to know why Schuyler was interested in Stacy and recalled her will that named Schuyler as guardian of her baby.\n\n\nThe men had words over the \"piece of paper.\" Schuyler insisted that he was named guardian because he and Stacy went \"way back.\" Rex refused to buy it and advised Schuyler that he would never allow Schuyler to take care of his kid. He accused Schuyler of being obsessed with Rex's family, and he suggested that Schuyler get one of his own. He wanted to know why Schuyler was pursuing Stacy and the baby so avidly. Schuyler insisted that he couldn't tell Rex but had to talk to Gigi first.\n\n\nGigi finally managed to get Stacy to Viki's cabin, and the women dried off. Stacy declared that Jessica was a \"lost cause\" and was no more than a zombie. She explained how Dorian and Charlie had tried to kidnap Stacy first, and Rex was lucky that Mitch hadn't kidnapped him too. Gigi was surprised to hear of Dorian's behavior. She scoffed when Stacy noted that she had been in labor at the hospital. Gigi reported that Schuyler had already filled her in about Stacy's false labor. The women argued, and Stacy claimed that it was a \"simple mistake.\"\n\n\nGigi acknowledged that she had been waiting for Schuyler to arrive in the blizzard because he had something important to tell her about the baby. She demanded to know what Stacy was hiding. Stacy ordered Gigi to get off her back after her trying time. She had been kidnapped twice. She wanted to know why she was considered the bad person. \"You ARE a bad person,\" Gigi emphasized. Gigi let her have it and yelled about what Stacy had done to Shane. Stacy confessed that since she was pregnant, she knew what it was like to want to protect a baby. She almost told Mitch and Nurse Charles, she started, but stopped short. Gigi wanted to know what she had almost told them.\n\n\nNatalie advised John that they needed a plan to save Jessica. He comforted her but noted that there was nothing they could do for Jessica. He did his best to keep Natalie awake as she desperately tried to go to sleep. He wanted her to keep talking, and she spoke about the first time they met. She recalled her meeting with Jared, since she thought it was still Jared with her, as John flashed back to his own first meeting with Natalie and his lesson on shooting pool. She knew he was \"bad news,\" but she fell in love with him then, she recounted.\n\n\nAs Natalie continued on about the good times and bad times with Jared, John thought back to all of his own times with her. She noted that her good times were full of special moments. \"Mine too,\" John agreed.\n\n\nAt Mitch's hideout, Brody burst through the door as Mitch lay beside a sleeping Jessica. Cornered, Mitch grabbed a syringe from the bedside table and threatened to kill Jessica. He noted that the afterlife was more desirous for his daughter than her life with Brody.\n\n\nBrody doubted that Mitch would harm his daughter, but the older man retorted that Brody had no idea what he would do. \"You're right,\" Brody admitted as he shot his gun at Mitch.\n\n\nAs a wounded Mitch ranted about the messenger being shot, Brody secured him to a chair. Suddenly, Nurse Charles appeared from behind and began to strangle Brody with a cord. As the pair struggled, Mitch yelled encouragement to his follower. \"Die already,\" he called out to Brody. Jessica slowly began to awaken, and Brody encouraged her to grab the gun that he had laid down beside her while he tied Mitch to the chair.\n\n\nOut of nowhere, a shot rang out. Oliver rushed through the door and his bullet found the nurse. She was dead. Brody rushed to Jessica's side as Oliver placed Mitch under arrest. Mitch smirked when he heard Oliver declare that there was no trace of John or Natalie near their car. Mitch was sure they were dead. Oliver replied by slugging Mitch. Brody realized that there was no sign of Stacy and wanted to know where she was. \"Ask God. She's in his hands now,\" Mitch replied.\n\n\nHe left her to \"her own devices,\" Mitch continued. He threw her out after she lied about the baby's father. As Oliver threatened him, Mitch wondered why Oliver would care so much. Were Oliver and Stacy \"birds of a feather\" or did they \"share a deeper bond?\"\n\n\nOliver was determined to search for Stacy while Brody chose to stay behind with Jessica. He reassured her as she was more fully awake. He told her he was there. \"Brody? Do I know you?\" she asked him. \"Yes, Lord,\" Mitch yelled.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, a discouraged Roxy sat with Kyle. She was thinking about all of the good that babies created along with their dirty diapers. She had been looking forward to Rex's new child but was happy that he wouldn't have to deal with Stacy any longer. \"Good riddance to bad relish,\" she proclaimed. She felt sorry for the real dad, whoever that was.\n\n\nKyle felt sad for Roxy and admitted that he trusted her because she was his best friend. He knew that Roxy wouldn't reveal the fact that he was the one who had told her about Rex not being the baby's father. Roxy was proud, pointing out that she had never had a best friend. Kyle thought it was about time. He hated to see her suffering. Roxy felt the urge to take her grief out on someone since Stacy wasn't around.\n\n\nAs Todd walked Starr and Cole down the hallway to their apartment, he fired another private investigator over the phone. He admitted that he had lost count of the total of his employees who had been fired for their inability to locate Jessica. He confessed that he was hoping to catch a glimpse of Dani, along with making sure that Starr and Cole arrived home safely.\n\n\nWhile Cole went to check on Hope, Todd divulged that he didn't know where he stood with T\u00e9a. Starr was surprised since she thought that her father and T\u00e9a were back together. Todd teased her about making assumptions. As he began to tell her about the great sex he and T\u00e9a had shared the night before, Starr cringed and ordered him to stop. He was worried that it wouldn't work out if Dani hated him forever. Starr advised Todd not to give up on either Dani or T\u00e9a.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion Clint yelled at someone over the phone regarding the search for Jessica, and Marty assured Viki that her girls would be safe. Marty pointed out that John was with Natalie, and Brody was searching for Jessica. Kim tried to reassure an enraged Clint but panicked when she learned that Oliver had found an empty and exploded car without locating John, Natalie, or Brody.\n\n\nClint informed Viki and Marty that they would not be receiving any help from either the National Guard or the governor's office. They would be on their own in their attempts to find Jessica and Natalie. Kim stepped outside to phone Stacy and left her girlfriend a message. She stated that she knew that Stacy would be all right and she hoped that Schuyler had changed his mind about telling Gigi the truth about the baby and Rex.\n\n\nBefore she was able to finish her sentence about Rex, Kim was interrupted when Roxy approached her. Roxy finished the sentence for her and confirmed that she knew the truth about Rex's non-paternity. Kim denied it, but Roxy insisted that she knew the truth. She advised Kim that it was over for both Kim and Stacy.\n\n\nClint hurriedly got dressed so that he could find someone to help in the search for Jessica and Natalie. Kim threatened both Kyle and Roxy. \"I could totally take you out. I have  been known to cut a bitch,\" Kim snapped.\n\n\nRoxy left a message for Rex as Kyle left one for Oliver. \"I had to do it,\" Kyle explained. He had to tell Roxy the truth. He added that the only unhappy people in the entire mess would be himself, Oliver, and Schuyler. Roxy knew that Rex hated to hear her sound \"mushy,\" but she was worried about him. She had to do it, she added.\n\n\nCole finished checking on Hope and Dani and noted that they had the world's best babysitter. He added that he had heard from Marty and there was no word on John.\n\n\nGigi continued to demand that Stacy tell her the truth. Stacy stumbled on her words and explained that her water had broken. Gigi pointed out that a woman's water didn't break during false labor. She'd be the first in history, and she should have been fully dilated and demanding drugs, Gigi added. She wanted to know what else Stacy was faking and reminded her that she owed her life to Gigi. She wondered why Schuyler would be rushing up to see her in a blizzard.\n\n\n\"I just saved your life, you miserable bitch,\" Gigi exclaimed as she started to put everything together. She realized that Stacy wasn't having Rex's child.\n\n\nSchuyler rushed from the car, but Rex followed and grabbed him. Rex accused him and Gigi of planning to take Rex's baby from him. \"I saved your life, you bastard,\" Rex reminded him. He again demanded to know why Schuyler was interested in his child and why he needed to talk to Gigi. Finally, Schuyler gave in. \"It's not your child. It's mine,\" he gasped. \"It's mine.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While stuck in the snow, Rex runs into Schuyler and demands to know why Schuyler is so concerned about Stacy and Rex's baby and why she would name him as the guardian of their child. After evading the question, Schuyler finally confesses it's because it's not Rex's child. It's his. Gigi manages to put two and two together and concludes that Stacy is lying about her water breaking when she's having false labor and that could only mean that she's lying and the baby is not Rex's. Brody first goes to find Jessica and rescue her from Mitch. Then Oliver is not far behind him. He also enters, pulls a gun on Mitch and demands to know what Mitch did to Stacy. Everybody wonders why Oliver is so concerned about Stacy. Natalie believes that John is Jared and is reliving being with him. Hearing her confessions of love for him.
