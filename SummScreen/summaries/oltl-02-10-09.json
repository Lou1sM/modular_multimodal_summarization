Before they could find her camped out on the floor with Fish, Stacy yelled up to them to stop because she wasn't decently dressed. Rex was determined to get his cup of morning coffee so he offered to close his eyes. Stacy threw the covers over Fish then plopped onto the sofa before Rex and Gigi made their way through the living room with their eyes closed. \n\n\nAs soon as Gigi and Rex were in the kitchen, Stacy tossed Fish his clothes then hustled him out of the door. She explained that she didn't want her nephew coming downstairs to find his aunt with her lover. Stacy slammed the door in Fish's face before he could say more than a few words. \n\n\nA short time later, Stacy returned to the living room, properly dressed. Stacy was worried that Gigi was mad because of the way that Stacy had broken the news about their parents' passing. Gigi reassured her sister that she wasn't angry, otherwise she wouldn't have invited Stacy to stay with her. \n\n\nAs Gigi and Rex sipped coffee, Gigi flipped through a family photo album that she had taken when she had left home. Gigi was teary-eyed as she reminisced about the past. Rex told Stacy that he and Gigi had discussed tracking down Gigi's parents before their wedding. Gigi used the opportunity of her upcoming marriage to Rex to ask Stacy if there was someone special in her life. Stacy made it clear that she was unattached. She went a step further when she told her sister that every guy she had met at the ball, with the exception of Rex, had seemed like losers. \n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Layla and Talia were going over the receipts and talking about everything that had transpired at the ball. Layla announced that, despite all the drama, they had taken in quite a bit of money. Talk of the fight between Wes and Todd gave Talia the opportunity to mention how impressed she had been with the way Fish had handled the situation. Layla agreed with Talia, but noted that Fish had disappeared afterwards. Layla had no idea where he had gone. \n\n\nLater, Layla was pleasantly surprised when Fish showed up at the hotel; he had left his PDA behind the night before. While Talia went to fetch it, Fish told Layla that he couldn't see her any more. Layla was stunned when Fish explained that he believed he had met the love of his life the night before. \n\n\nDavid, sporting a nasty hangover, woke up in the Palace Hotel's conference room. Dorian was on hand to confirm David's suspicions that they had made love. Unfortunately, David didn't remember much of what happened the night before. Dorian was happy to help him out. As she recounted the events for him, David's memory slowly returned. \n\n\nHe recalled learning that he was a Buchanan and Dorian's confession that she had married him for the wrong reasons. He also remembered Dorian's offer to leave David alone so that he could think things through. Dorian didn't get far though. Before she could get on the elevator, David had stopped her. After they shared a passionate kiss, they returned to the room, drank champagne, ate strawberries, danced, and then made love. \n\n\nWhen Dorian noticed the sad expression on David's face, she asked him what was wrong. David explained that he was sad because he would miss his morning prayers. Dorian was delighted when, in the next breath, David declared that he found comfort in knowing that he had inherited the Buchanan fortune. Just like that, David Vickeroshi was no more. \n\n\nDorian and David made arrangements for Dorian's personal shopper to bring them designer clothes to change into. Among the items that Dorian's shopper brought was a cowboy hat, which David immediately took a shine to. \n\n\nNora woke up in the Buchanan mansion's living room with a playing card stuck to her forehead. She turned to Clint to ask him how they had ended up on the sofa, only to discover that her sleeping companion was Bo. Clint walked into the room a heartbeat later. He seemed just as hung over as Bo and Nora. Clint, too, wondered how Nora and Bo had ended up on the sofa together. Nigel, equally as miserable as the rest of them, didn't have any answers when he joined them a short while later. Nigel was carrying a tray of glasses containing a hangover remedy. It was Renee, who breezed after Nigel, who had the answers to all of their questions. \n\n\nAfter Renee gratefully gulped down Nigel's banana concoction, she explained that they had decided to raid the wine cellar after the ball. Things took a wild turn when a game of cards turned into a game of Strip Poker at Nigel's suggestion. Clint laughed as he recalled them all stripping down to their undergarments before staggering off to bed. Nora had passed out near the sofa. When Bo had stumbled in from the barn, it had woken Nora up. Unfortunately, Nora only managed to stagger a few steps before she passed out on the sofa next to Bo. \n\n\nLater, after everyone cleaned up and got dressed, they gathered in the living room. When they heard the doorbell ring, the family realized that it was probably David and Dorian. They were correct. Nigel announced, \"Mr. and Mrs. Vickers\" seconds later. Dorian was quick to remind Nigel that they were now Buchanans, not Vickerses. \n\n\nDavid made a show of telling Clint, Bo, and Nora how much he admired them and how delighted he was that they were family before he ordered them to \"get the hell out of my house!\" \n\n\nBlair woke up with a headache. When she asked John for a couple of aspirin, she was aghast to discover that she was in bed with Todd, not John. Todd found her reaction amusing. Blair ignored Todd's chuckles at her expense, as she demanded answers. She wanted to know how she had wound up in bed with Todd. Todd explained that Blair had gotten drunk after John leapt to Marty's rescue when Wes had put his hands on Marty. \n\n\nBlair's memory slowly returned to confirm that Todd had told her the truth. When John had tried to talk to Blair, she rebuffed him then kept on drinking. Finally, after John had left and the bar had closed, Todd had approached Blair. He refused to let her drive after she had been drinking. Since Blair wasn't in any condition to walk, she had accepted a ride from Todd. \n\n\nTodd told Blair that he had taken her to his house, instead of to La Boulaie, because he did not want their kids to see Blair drunk and making a fool out of herself. When they had arrived at Todd's place, Todd had offered Blair the choice of one of his five bedrooms. After Todd had turned in for the night, Blair stumbled around looking for the bathroom. She found the bedroom that Todd was sleeping in instead. When Blair recognized it as Marty's room, Blair had teased Todd for sleeping in it. They bickered back and forth briefly until Blair had flopped down on the bed then promptly passed out. \n\n\nAs Blair got dressed, they talked about the fight between Wes and Todd the night before. Blair recalled the look that Todd had given Wes. She told him that if looks could kill, Wes would be dead. Todd didn't deny that he had been furious with Wes. \n\n\nBefore she left, Blair told Todd that she did not want anyone to know that she had spent the night at his place. \n\n\nAs John made his way to his rented room, Marty woke up next to Wes. When she turned over to wake Wes, Marty realized that she was covered in blood and that Wes was dead. John heard Marty's screams in the hallway. He rushed to the room she shared with Wes and banged on the door. When Marty didn't open it, John kicked the door open. He found Marty crouched against the wall with a look of complete horror on her face. John found the reason for the expression when he turned to see Wes's bloody body on the bed. \n\n\nJohn asked Marty what had happened. Unfortunately, Marty's memory was spotty. She told John that she and Wes had been drunk when they returned to the room. They were also arguing. Wes was livid because Marty had used him to get to John. While they argued, Wes's temper flared. Marty told John that Wes had revealed that he had seen Lee Halpern the night that she died. Marty recalled thinking that Wes might have killed Lee, which had infuriated her, because it meant that Wes had killed the only person who could have secured Todd's conviction. Marty feared that in her anger, she had killed Wes. However, she did not recall actually killing Wes. \n\n\nJohn was quick to defend Marty. He told her that he knew her and that he believed she couldn't have done it. Marty scoffed at his reasoning. She reminded him that she was a changed person who was perfectly capable of murder. She cited the incident with Todd on the rooftop, when Marty convinced him to jump and end his life, as evidence of her homicidal tendencies. \n\n\nWhile the two were talking, Blair arrived to see John. She noticed the door to Wes's room was ajar. When she heard voices, Blair crept closer. She took in Marty's blood-drenched clothes as Marty asked John not to call the police. Marty wanted John to help her. Blair decided to take matters into her own hands; she called the police to report a murder. John and Marty turned when they heard Blair place the call. Neither looked pleased by Blair's interference.\n\n\n",
