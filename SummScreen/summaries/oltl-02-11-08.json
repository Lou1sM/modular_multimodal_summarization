On the roof, Rex threw Gigi to the ground when he discovered the laser pointed at her. Simultaneously, Todd began battling Ramsey for the rifle in the empty office building across the street. As Todd and Ramsey wrestled, the rifle fired, and the bullet struck John's apartment window. Ramsey gained the upper hand and pointed the rifle at Todd.\n\n\nJohn pushed Shane to the floor and shielded the child with his body. Both watched as the bullet was lodged into John's slot machine. Upon hearing the gunfire, Gigi pushed Rex away and ran downstairs to find Shane. Before following Gigi, Rex observed Todd and Ramsey in the office building. Once downstairs, Gigi was reunited with Shane and John.\n\n\nAs John ordered everyone to hide in the bathroom, Rex questioned both John and Gigi about what had just taken place but received no answers. Rex directed John to the office building, where he'd observed the two unidentified men. As John headed across the street, Rex demanded answers from Gigi. Gigi told Rex about the kidnapping and revealed that Todd and Ramsey wanted her and Shane dead. Rex admitted Todd was a terrible person but didn't believe he was capable of killing a woman and her child.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Todd pushed Ramsey against a wall, and the two struggled over the gun again. When Ramsey heard footsteps, he fell to the ground and allowed Todd to take control of the gun. As Todd pointed the weapon at Ramsey, John entered the room. Ramsey told John that Todd had just tried to kill Gigi and Shane, but he'd prevented it.\n\n\nAfter their date, Cristian and Sarah arrived at her apartment. The two discussed their wonderful evening together and shared a passionate kiss. Both agreed it was rather exciting how their relationship had evolved, and how they continued to enjoy each other's company. While Sarah and Cristian shared a romantic moment, Layla entered the room and interrupted the couple.\n\n\nOnce Layla left the room, Sarah invited Cristian to the Go Red Ball. Cristian accepted Sarah's invitation and gave her a loving kiss goodbye. After Cristian left, Sarah was elated. When Layla asked Sarah if she was falling for Cristian, Sarah happily announced that she already had.\n\n\nUpon entering the Lord mausoleum, Allison was excited to be in the presence of the late Victor Lord and perched herself on top of his crypt. When Allison told Jessica and Natalie that it was possible Victor's heart might still be beating, the sisters demanded that Allison quit playing games and reveal her secret. Allison told them, \"People think their secrets die with them if they remain unspoken, but it's not true.\" Allison then sprawled her body over Victor's crypt and smiled.\n\n\nFed up with Allison's antics, Jessica threatened to take Allison back to St. Ann's immediately if she refused to cooperate. Natalie pulled her sister to the side and suggested she give up her quest for answers from Allison. Natalie didn't believe Allison knew anything about the family and was simply playing a sick game. Jessica told Natalie that Victor was her father, and she needed to learn the truth. When Natalie asked Jessica to return Allison to the mental institution, Jessica stated that was not an option at that time.\n\n\nJessica threatened Allison one last time. Jessica told Allison that Tess was very much a part of her. After Allison continued to speak highly of Mitch and made awful statements about Viki, Jessica became frustrated. Jessica gave Natalie a signal, and the two locked Allison in the crypt. Jessica told Natalie that perhaps Allison would decide to talk in the morning, after spending the night with corpses. Natalie was doubtful and told Jessica that Allison had had worse things happen to her.\n\n\nAs Jessica and Natalie walked away, Allison screamed hysterically and pleaded with the girls to let her out. Jessica smiled to herself, but Natalie appeared worried.\n\n\nAt the jail, Bo allowed Michael to spend some time alone with Marcie before her arraignment in the morning. While Bo told Michael that he and Marcie had serious issues to discuss, he received an important call and excused himself. Michael told Marcie he wanted her to change her mind and plead not guilty, but she was determined to enter a guilty plea.\n\n\nMarcie appeared distraught and told Michael that everyone had witnessed her behavior on national television, and no one would ever believe she was innocent. Michael begged Marcie to reconsider and told her that a guilty plea would leave her with no options. Michael told Marcie he didn't want to lose her. As Marcie and Michael continued to disagree, Marcie had memories of Tommy.\n\n\nBack at the office building, John told Todd to give him the weapon, but Todd refused. Todd told John that Ramsey was the one who'd attempted to shoot Gigi and Shane and continued to point the gun at Ramsey. As Todd ordered Ramsey to be still, Ramsey disregarded Todd's statements and denied his claims. Moments later, Bo and several police officers entered the office and ordered Todd to put down the gun. Immediately, Todd relinquished the weapon and put his hands in the air.\n\n\nTodd told Bo that he'd stopped Ramsey from killing Gigi and Shane and explained that the gun had accidentally gone off. Todd expressed concern when John informed him the bullet had gone through his window. Ramsey continued to accuse Todd of attempted murder. Todd asked Bo if he realized what Ramsey was actually capable of and insisted that he'd prevented a murder.\n\n\nWhen John accused Ramsey of hitting him with the rifle, Bo felt he would get answers, since traces of John's blood would be on the weapon. Ramsey stated that along with John's blood, Todd's fingerprints would also be on the gun. After listening to Ramsey's accusations, Todd asked Bo if he realized Ramsey was lying, and Bo stated he did. Bo ordered his men to handcuff both Todd and Ramsey and stated the matter would be handled at the station. As Todd and Ramsey were escorted out of the building, Bo gave John a knowing look.\n\n\nAs Rex continued to press Gigi for more answers, Gigi blurted out that she blamed Rex for what had happened. When Rex questioned her statement, Gigi apologized for being so harsh. She stated that if she had not gone to the roof with him, she would have been with Shane at the time of the shooting. Shane told his mother he was fine and not to worry. As Rex inquired about Gigi's involvement with Todd, Shane appeared suspicious and asked his mother exactly who Rex was.\n\n\nRex told Gigi to tell Shane who he was; Gigi was speechless. Gigi told Shane that Rex was an old friend. When Shane questioned her reaction to Rex, Gigi attempted to change the subject and received help from Rex. Rex began complimenting Shane on his bravery, and Shane appeared to bond with him. Rex told Shane his father would be proud of him if he were there. Sadly, Shane admitted he'd never met his father but hoped he would be proud. As she listened to their conversation, Gigi was heartbroken.\n\n\nJohn returned to the apartment and told Gigi and Shane they were safe. John told Gigi about Todd's claims and revealed that he believed Todd had prevented Ramsey from shooting her and Shane. John promised Shane that he would not allow anyone to hurt him or his mother. When Rex asked John if Todd was in jail, John told Rex he was -- and would be forced to help Marcie.\n\n\nAs Michael continued to persuade Marcie to fight for her freedom, Todd and Ramsey entered the holding room. When he saw Marcie, Todd laughed. Bo ordered his officers to take Todd and Ramsey to separate holding rooms. Upon seeing Todd in jail, Marcie became excited and suggested to Michael that Todd might lose Tommy if he had committed a terrible crime. Michael quickly told his wife that Todd's crimes would not return Tommy to them. He gave her one last warning to plead not guilty.\n\n\nGigi apologized to Rex and told him Shane was not his son. Rex didn't appear to believe her and left. Out in the hall, Rex told John he'd saved Shane's life. John said Shane was a special little boy, and he would never want to see anything happen to him. Rex sadly stated he wouldn't, either, and walked away. John appeared to have something on his mind as he watched Rex leave.\n\n\nLeft alone in the mausoleum, Allison appeared quite calm. She began talking to Victor. She said that it was too bad Jessica and Natalie had left because she had something to show them. Allison stood against a wall and began knocking on a particular section of the wall.\n\n\nSuddenly, a stone popped open, and Allison removed a gun from the opening. She stated, \"Mitch, you've thought of everything.\" She then removed a plastic bag, containing a box, and said, \"Hello, gorgeous.\" She looked intently at the package.\n\n\n",

Shane lets John know that Gigi had left with some man. Rex questions Gigi if he is Shane's father. Before Gigi can answer, Rex sees a gun aimed for Gigi and he pushes her out of the way. Todd sneaks into the room where Ramsay is with the gun. Rex tells Gigi that the laser of a rifle was on her. Todd and Ramsay struggle as the gun goes off. Ramsay knocks Todd down and aims the laser rifle on him. Cristian takes Sarah home. Natalie and Jessica take Alison to their grandfather's crypt and leaves her. Todd and Ramsay are both arrested. John tells Gigi and Shane that he has Todd dead to rights now that he will have to help Marcie.",
