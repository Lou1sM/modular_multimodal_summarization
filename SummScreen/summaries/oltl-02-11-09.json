    "soap_central": "\nTeenage Wasteland\n\n\nAt Llanview High, Cole faced Matthew's accusation against him. As Bo and Nora began to fire off questions, a mute stare-down ensued between the boys. Bo and Nora were skeptical of Matthew's explanation, unwilling to believe that Cole would turn back to drugs. As a guilty Cole struggled to speak, Matthew's classmates, Becca and Justin, watched from across the hall. When Matthew heard Justin mock him for being an innocent, he spoke up, interrupting Cole's attempt at a confession. Anxious to impress Becca, Matthew defiantly told his parents that the pot had been his, after all. \n\n\nOutraged, Bo dragged Matthew out of the school, leaving Nora to cluck her tongue about her son's out of character behavior. Cole once again tried to stick up for his friend, but Nora talked right over him, fretting about Todd's acquittal and Marty's behavior. Cole promised he would always come to Nora with his problems, but couldn't work up the nerve to exonerate Matthew before she left to rejoin Bo. After Nora was gone, Cole ran into drug dealer, Asher, who asked him if he still wanted the pharmaceuticals he'd requested. Tortured, Cole said yes. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi and Rex arrived as Gigi began her shift. Desperate to find David and Dorian, Rex still held out hope for beating Beaver Calhoun to David's side and saving the Buchanan empire. After checking with some contacts, Rex determined that Dorian was back in Llanview and preparing for the Go Red Ball. He beat feet to continue his quest, but not before reassuring Gigi that her ticket to the ball was back at the carriage house. \n\n\nGigi greeted Michael and Marcie at a nearby table, sharing her delight about being able to attend a fancy gala with a beautiful red dress. Michael attempted to engage Marcie in more enthusiastic conversation, but Marcie couldn't help brooding about Todd's acquittal and Starr's suffering. Michael told Marcie she couldn't keep herself a prisoner of her past regrets, and reminded her that she had her whole life ahead of her. He said he still slept on the couch every night because he remained devoted to her, and their life together. Michael suggested they start over by going on a date together, and attending the Go Red Ball arm in arm. Marcie was charmed by the idea. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Beaver Calhoun leaned on Roxy for information about David's whereabouts. As Beaver ratcheted his reward amount higher and higher, Roxy's eyes got wider and wider. When Beaver took a call, Roxy retreated below her desk for a private consultation with \"Morris,\" the stuffed beaver, which held not only Dorian's bribe money, but also the secret of Rex's paternity. Suddenly, \"Morris\" began to \"speak\" to Roxy, miffed that she would compromise her dubious morals and go back on her promise to Dorian for the possibility of a bigger payoff. Roxy marveled at Morris gaining the ability of speech: \"I didn't even drink today!\" Morris reminded Roxy of her word to Dorian, but when Beaver returned to the desk, Roxy appeared ready to crack. She told Beaver she knew exactly where David Vickers was. Just then, Dorian flew into the lobby, steering Beaver away from Roxy as quickly as possible. As Roxy bemoaned losing a big score, Morris spoke up again, reminding her in Roxy-speak that she \"still had [her] integration.\" \n\n\n\"Morris, sometimes I've got no idea what the hell you're talking about,\" Roxy groused. \n\n\nAs Dorian and Beaver shared a cozy reunion, Dorian told the attorney that she knew where David was, or rather, where he would be: at the Go Red Ball. Turning on the charm, Dorian provided Beaver with a ticket to the ball and told him to break the news there. After Beaver left, Dorian turned on Roxy, demanding her money back. Then, she changed her mind, telling Roxy her payoff would be \"chump change\" after the ball. After Dorian stalked out, Roxy told Morris that Dorian was clearly keeping a deep, dark secret. \"Hello!\" Morris chirped. \"Like we're not?\" \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki, Charlie, Jared, and Natalie were preparing for the ball, but Natalie balked at the idea of leaving Chloe and Bree alone with Jessica for the evening. While the men fed Chloe, Viki took Natalie aside and reassured her that the girls would be fine with Jessica and Lois. She reminded Natalie that Jessica needed their love and support during her re-integration into society. Viki said Jessica would never harm the girls, but Natalie brought up Tess's rampant neglect during her schemes for vengeance. Viki told Natalie that without her family's forgiveness and understanding, she herself could never have gone forward after DID. Viki urged Natalie to reconsider her harsh stance on her sister. Viki asked Natalie to be with her at the celebration that evening, and Natalie relented. \n\n\nAfter Natalie left, Viki and Charlie sat down together. Viki was still annoyed that Dorian had done nothing to fulfill her duties as co-chair of the Red Ball, and said she smelled a rat: Dorian was planning something that involved David. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Brody and Jessica shared a difficult truth-telling session. Jess was despondent that she couldn't relate to Chloe properly, and was unnerved that Starr had seemed so much more natural with the baby than she had. Jessica asked how Brody was doing with treatment. Brody admitted he missed having her to talk to, and Jessica said she'd missed him as well. Jessica despaired at her issues with Natalie and the family walking on eggshells around her; she said she only felt open and unencumbered when talking with Dr. Levin and Brody. Jessica couldn't understand why Chloe's birth remained a total blank in her memory, but Brody told her that the pieces she'd already begun to recover meant that the rest of the alters' memories would come soon. Jessica thanked Brody for listening, and told him she'd be back again soon, maybe just to listen to him. \n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Natalie and Jared pondered her mother's words, and agreed that they needed to give Jessica another chance. Just then, Rex burst in, demanding to see Viki. Racing into the drawing room, Rex begged Viki to tell him where David was, but Viki had no clue. Viki asked Rex what all the secrecy was about, but Rex apologized and said he couldn't say. Viki threw up her hands, exasperated to have her suspicions about Dorian confirmed. \n\n\nAs Jared ushered Rex out, Natalie was surprised by the arrival of a construction worker from Nash and Jessica's vineyard; the man was there to return Jessica's wallet, which had been missing since the night of Chloe's birth. Upon examining the wallet, Jared and Natalie were surprised to discover a Llanview Hospital parking pass, dated the night of the birth. \n\n\nBack at Llanview High, Starr and Schuyler continued their heart-to-heart discussion. Starr told Schuyler that she'd felt very connected to Chloe when holding her, almost as if \"she could've been mine.\" She grew anguished as she talked about trying to get past Todd's misdeeds and Hope's death, and said that she couldn't keep up with her friends and classmates anymore; she wanted to be a kid again, but found it wasn't the same as before. Schuyler admitted that Starr was more mature than his other students, and said it would take time for the rest of the class to catch up to where she was after her traumatic life experiences. \n\n\nStarr said she'd felt unconditional acceptance when holding Chloe, something she could no longer find from Langston or Cole. She wanted to find a way to segue back into regular life and escape from the turmoil of the past, but didn't know how. \"Mr. J.\" had an idea, however, and offered Starr the position of teacher's assistant as he began work on his master's thesis on genetics, a field that interested Starr. Schuyler told Starr it would be demanding work after school, but Starr was eager for the distraction, and thanked Schuyler for thinking of her. \n\n\nIn the outside corridor, Cole was pocketing Asher's new drugs just as Starr exited Mr. Joplin's classroom with her good news. When she saw Asher and Cole, Starr stopped short, and simply walked away. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Bo hauled Matthew into the drawing room and tried the soft sell, begging him to talk to his father and open up about his issues. Matthew rejected Bo's overtures and said he couldn't talk to someone who didn't trust his word or listen to him. As Nora arrived on the scene, Bo gave Matthew a dose of \"adult problems;\" he said the Buchanans were on the verge of losing everything, but they didn't turn to alcohol or drugs to numb the pain. Bo and Nora continued to try to meet Matthew halfway, but Matthew grew increasingly combative and then blew them off, storming out of the room. Nora was seething, but Bo had a better solution to their newfound discipline problem: a brochure for military school. \n\n\nAt the carriage house, the mysterious Stacy went through Rex and Gigi's mail before snagging the spare key under the mailbox and entering the house. Giving the home the once-over, Stacy examined the Morasco family pictures before taking a shine to Gigi's gorgeous red dress. Grabbing the dress and the ball ticket, Stacy hid as Gigi returned home to change, then dashed out the front door unnoticed. Gigi was horrified to realize her dress, and ticket, were both missing. \n\n\nAt his wit's end, Rex arrived at the Angel Square Hotel to cry on Roxy's shoulder about his failure to locate David and Dorian. When Roxy perked up at the mention of David's name, Rex sensed something was amiss, and pleaded with his mother to give him any information she had. Glancing at Morris for advice, Roxy confessed to Rex that she knew exactly where David was: \"He's right upstairs!\" \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jared and Natalie mused over the mysterious hospital pass. Natalie wondered how Tess could have been at Llanview Hospital on the night of Chloe's birth. The time stamp on the pass was faded, leaving them no clue to Tess's movements. Jared dismissed it, and told Natalie that nothing Tess or Jessica had done that night had mattered to the final outcome. As Viki, Charlie, and Jared rushed upstairs to get dressed for the ball, Natalie remained in the foyer, mystified by her strange discovery. \n\n\n",
