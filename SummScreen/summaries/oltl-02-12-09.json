    "soap_central": "\n Something in Red \n\n\nArriving early for the Go Red Ball, Dorian showed David the special meditation room she had created especially for him. He wondered if she was up to something and if she was hiding him from the other guests. She explained that she merely wanted his appearance to be a big surprise at just the right moment. Viki and Charlie entered, with Charlie hoping that the ball wouldn't be as crazy as the previous year's. Jokingly, he asked Viki if Allison Perkins was still in a coma. Spying Dorian acting oddly, Viki wondered what she was up to. Viki reminded Dorian that she herself had completed all the tasks for the ball, to which Dorian remarked that the only thing left to do was relax. \n\n\nDorian asked Bo if he was ready to give up his fortune, and a tense Bo flinched at the question. Clarifying that she merely meant that money could be donated for the evening's cause, Dorian left the Buchanans in an uncomfortable state. \n\n\nAs Gigi searched frantically for her gown and ticket at the carriage house, she was unsuccessful in her attempts to reach Rex on the phone. Stacy showed up at the ball and identified herself as Gigi Morasco. The woman at the front door, Eunice Burns, admired the young woman's gown. Back at the carriage house, Gigi, dressed in blue, which was a definite no-no, was ready to head to the ball. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Rex was ecstatic to learn from Roxy that David was there. A mad dash upstairs was a downer though, when he couldn't locate the man. Roxy pointed out a back door, assuming that David had left via that exit. Rex left his phone behind in his haste to catch up. A quite handsome John impressed Roxy, who wanted to know which lucky lady he was sacrificing for. On his way out, John ran into Marty, who was headed into the hotel. She was surprised at his appearance, noting that he didn't seem to be the $500 a plate type. He agreed that he wasn't. \n\n\nOnce John was gone, Roxy, being Roxy, went on and on about John to Marty. She even mentioned Natalie being his former girlfriend until Marty came along. Annoyed, Marty asked her to stop. When Wes walked in and asked Marty what was wrong, she blew up at him, tired of everyone wanting to know how she was. Obviously regretting her tone, she quickly asked Wes if he was scheduled to work. She wanted to go to the ball and dance, and without an invitation, she expressed her desire to crash it. \n\n\nAs the Buchanans arrived en masse, Nora wanted to talk to Bo about the possibility of Matthew being shipped to military school. She attempted to defend her son, pointing out that things would be worked out. As far as Bo was concerned, it was a done deal that Matthew would be transferred. He preferred that they not talk about it at the ball. \n\n\nRex, out of breath, reached the ball but was denied entrance without his ticket and his tuxedo. Mentioning that his girlfriend was already inside, Eunice's face lit up when she heard Gigi's name. She praised the gown that Gigi was wearing, causing Rex to confide that he had been the one to purchase it. He made a dash for the Buchanans to share his unfortunate news of not locating David. Beaver Calhoun showed up and Dorian assured him of David's presence. Stacy flirted with Fish until he uneasily spied Layla and made his way to her. \n\n\nEunice looked down her nose at the dressed-in-blue Gigi. The young woman attempted to explain that her dress and ticket were both missing. When she identified herself, she was informed that Gigi was already inside. Hastily looking in her purse for her driver's license, Gigi was horrified to see that the identification was also among the missing. \n\n\nOver at La Boulaie, Blair, dressed in a robe, informed Moe and Noelle that she would not be attending the ball. She declined Noelle's request that she accompany them. When asked about John, she merely shrugged, assuming that John would only be cheating on her. In response to their questions, Blair pointed out that John was not her man, but his own. He had talked to Marty about his feelings, she continued. Stating emphatically that she was over John, Blair was surprised to see John in the doorway, holding a beautiful bouquet of flowers. \n\n\nNot happy to see John, Blair told him that he should have called first. Responding that he knew she liked to dress up caused Blair to begin to melt. She wondered if John preferred to take Marty to the ball after all the things he said to Marty about her, but he assured Blair that he wanted to take her and not Marty. He stressed that he did not have his best suit on for Marty, even though Blair felt that he allowed Marty to pull him around by his nose. She stressed that she wouldn't change her mind about that, even if he disagreed. The flirting began, they admitted that they liked each other the way they were, and Blair agreed to change into a red dress. Asking what the meaning of their relationship was, John confirmed that they just didn't want to forget each other. \n\n\nT\u00e9a finally located Todd, holed up in Marty's old bedroom and watching game shows. She admitted that she had been concerned about him, but wanted him to attend the ball with her. Todd asked that T\u00e9a return his house key, but she refused, citing their need for each other, which Todd promptly denied. Gravely, she mentioned the other case that she was working on, and Todd swiftly offered her money or the use of his newspaper, in her quest for justice. Her demand puzzled him instead, as she reiterated her request that he join her at the ball. \n\n\nRefusing to go, Todd agreed to a game of \"Money\" with the ball attendance on the line. T\u00e9a won and insisted that he keep his end of the bargain and accompany her to the ball. She also admitted that she thought he was coming from a good place when he committed his various misdeeds, even if she didn't understand him. Todd laughed at her confession. \n\n\nViki was called to the podium as everyone was seated. She thanked the sponsors of the Go Red Ball. Dorian, called to the podium as Dr. Dorian Lord, informed the crowd that she had a new name. Calling to David hidden away in his meditation room, Dorian introduced the crowd to her new husband, David Vikeroshi. She spoke of her new view on life, and her new belief to give selflessly. As Dorian spoke, Beaver made his way to the front of the room. Stacy approached Rex, who did a double take when he saw the gown she was wearing. Out front, Gigi continued to argue with Eunice as the woman blocked her way. Finally, she was able to run past the ticket taker to the inside, as Eunice called for security. \n\n\nDavid thought it was a great idea to engage the crowd in a chant, but Viki quickly grabbed the microphone. Layla was unable to dance with Fish, referring to the gift bags that she had to hand out. An astonished Rex told Stacy that his girlfriend had the same dress. Dorian insisted that the Buchanans extend their good wishes to her. She mentioned her newfound spirituality and the fact that money and material goods no longer meant anything to her. Beaver wanted to speak to David, and Dorian introduced herself. Playing along, Beaver acted as though they had never met. Gigi ran from Eunice and came to a stop, spying a woman in the same dress that she had. \"You?\" she asked incredulously. \n\n\nAwkwardly, three couples arrived at the same time. John and Blair, Todd and T\u00e9a, and Wes and Marty, all stepped off elevators and into the entrance to the ball. Beaver droned on about following Asa's will, until Clint, jumping in, urged him to get to the point. Beaver informed David that his real name was David Buchanan. Dorian smiled as the Buchanans looked on with expressions of discomfort.\n\n\n",
