Michael told her he had given everything away to charity so she wouldn't be reminded of Tommy because he'd thought it might help. Marcie cried that she'd wanted to see his crib and highchair.\n\n\nMarcie thought Michael wanted her to pretend Tommy had never happened. Michael just wanted her to start letting go. Marcie didn't know how to do that. Michael said maybe he could get some of Tommy's things back from Roxy. Next, Michael and Marcie went through the box of Tommy's things, piece by piece, remembering their son.\n\n\nBlair read Sam a story as Todd watched. She asked Todd where he'd been. He told her he had been at Marcie's arraignment and further related that he'd paid Marcie's bail. Todd told Blair that John had blackmailed him into it. Blair made him tell the entire story. Todd said that after she heard the story, she might not want to have their marriage continue.\n\n\nTodd told Blair that he and Lee had held Gigi and Shane hostage in Texas, and John had found out, which had given John the leverage he'd needed to make Todd support Marcie's release. Todd also told Blair that Lee had wanted him to kill Gigi and Shane. Todd assured her he hadn't planned to go through with it, but then Lee had threatened Blair and the kids. Todd said he'd tried to stop Lee, and it had been just in time to save Gigi. He told Blair he had been arrested, but John was protecting Todd, since he'd helped Marcie.\n\n\nTodd told Blair he'd let her and the kids down. Blair said the old Todd would have lied and covered up what he'd done. She said she was not happy about what he'd done, but she was glad he hadn't covered it up. Blair said their marriage was not over because he had been honest with her. They hugged then kissed.\n\n\nBo told Talia and Antonio that they needed to be clear about the Llanview Police Department fraternization policy. Lindsay arrived and interrupted the meeting, delivering Bo his dry cleaning and asking if they were still on for the Go Red Ball that night. Bo nodded uncomfortably. Antonio and Talia left so Bo and Lindsay could discuss their date. Lindsay insisted it was not a date; they were just going to the ball together. Lindsay told Bo she wanted to do something nice for him.\n\n\nNora, listening outside the door, made a face and pretended to stick her finger down her throat. Then she coughed so they'd know she was outside. Nora wanted to talk to Lindsay about Todd posting bail for Marcie. As she started, Mayor Lowell arrived and said he was stunned that Marcie had gotten bail. He was upset because he'd promised the community that Marcie would be prosecuted. He said that when the case went to trial, there very well might be a new D.A. prosecuting.\n\n\nNora looked shocked, but Lindsay gave a small smile. Bo leaped to Nora's defense. The mayor was unimpressed and mentioned Daniel Colson, another of Nora's mistakes. Nora asked if they could have the conversation outside Lindsay's presence. Lindsay said she'd wait outside. The mayor told Nora he'd get rid of her if she didn't get Marcie's conviction. Nora told the mayor she didn't work for him -- she worked for the Commonwealth.\n\n\nNora left in a huff. Bo asked the mayor if he had maybe been a little hard on Nora, and the mayor said Bo was not in a position to judge. Then the mayor went off on Bo about being Lindsay's guardian. Bo told the mayor he was out of line; the mayor growled that Bo needed to clean up his mess. And further, unlike Nora, the mayor could fire Bo. Lindsay heard the entire exchange. She offered to move in with R.J. Bo refused her offer. He said they shouldn't worry about what the mayor said. He said he'd meet her at the ball. Lindsay thanked him.\n\n\nJared sat at the bar at the diner and wrote his secret on one of the cards: \"Natalie, I made it all up. I'm not your uncle!\" Then he put the card into the clear box as Natalie watched. Jessica arrived. Neither Buchanan girl had found Allison yet. They knew she hadn't shown up at Llanfair. Adriana and Rex arrived at the diner. Rex explained that saving Gigi's life had been no big deal -- he had just been in the right place at the right time. Rex said he thought Gigi was telling the truth about Shane not being his son. Adriana said that meant he could concentrate on his own father, Charlie.\n\n\nRex went over and said he needed to talk to Natalie. Natalie guessed it was about the news that Charlie was Rex's real dad. Jared overheard that part of the conversation. Jessica and Natalie left in a hurry to find Allison. Jared confronted Rex, asking if he'd just heard correctly that Charlie was Rex's father. \"What's it to you?\" asked Rex.\n\n\nJessica suggested they look for Allison at Lion's Heart and other places Mitch had hung out. Natalie suggested getting Bo involved. Jessica insisted they shouldn't tell Bo because if they did, they'd never learn Allison's secret. Adriana asked if Jared knew Charlie. Jared played it off, saying he'd thought Natalie had been upset in reaction to the news about Rex's real father.\n\n\nNash arrived. He spotted Jessica and said he'd been looking all over for her. He wanted to know what she'd been doing. She tried to kiss him and run off, but he stopped her, wanting to know what she and Natalie had been up to. Jared received a call from the person he and Nash were to meet -- they needed to reschedule. Jared invited Jessica, Natalie, and Nash to lunch. Natalie and Jessica declined, saying they had to get dresses for the ball.\n\n\nNash said it was going to be a surprise, but he'd already bought the red dress Jessica had had her eye on. Nash wanted to go home with Jessica. Adriana said it was a coincidence that both Jared and Rex had recently found out who their real fathers were. Adriana and Rex left. Nash and Jessica left, and Natalie found herself alone with Jared. Jared told her about the box and asked if she had any secrets she wanted to share. Natalie stalked off.\n\n\nRoxy and Allison arrived at the Hair Haven, arguing. Roxy wanted her to leave town. Allison grabbed a pair of scissors and held it to Roxy's throat. She said she was not going anywhere. There was a knock at the door. Allison told Roxy to get rid of whoever it was. It was Nash, carrying Bree, and he wondered why the salon was closed.\n\n\nRoxy made some excuse about being alone, and Nash disagreed. He had seen her go inside with another woman. Nash needed Roxy to watch Bree for a while. She tried to get out of it, but Nash wouldn't take no for an answer. He had a meeting with Jared at the diner.\n\n\nAllison walked out from behind the wall and took the baby from Roxy. Allison said she looked like a Buchanan then contradicted herself, saying that Bree couldn't look like a Buchanan, since Jessica wasn't one. Allison said it made all the difference in the world who someone's father was. Roxy grabbed the scissors like a weapon, and Allison put Bree between them.\n\n\nRoxy told Allison not to hurt Bree, and Allison said she would never hurt Mitch's granddaughter. They traded barbs. Michael arrived and introduced himself to Allison. Allison introduced herself as Laura Mitchell, Roxy's new trainee. Michael asked for Tommy's things back. Roxy had the items and gave Michael the key to the storage area. Jessica and Nash arrived at Roxy's to pick up Bree. Allison hid with Bree on the other side of the wall.\n\n\nCharlie had something he needed to tell Viki, but Lois interrupted and said there were visitors. Gigi and Shane arrived, getting big hugs from both Viki and Charlie. They made jokes about Viki's mansion. Gigi asked how they'd hooked back up, since they hadn't even known each other's last names, and Viki proudly told Gigi that they had learned each other's last names. Viki announced, \"This is Charlie Balsom.\"\n\n\nGigi looked shocked and asked if he was related to Rex, and Viki told Gigi that Charlie was Rex's father. Gigi laughed and said that was impossible. They asked how it was impossible. She told them she had gone to high school with Rex in Michigan. Charlie explained how he'd never known about Rex and had just found out he had a son. They asked what she was doing in Llanview.\n\n\nGigi explained she was in town to help Marcie. Viki and Gigi had differing opinions on Todd's character. Viki said Todd was a wonderful father. Gigi told Viki that Todd had paid Marcie's bail. Charlie asked how long she was going to stay; Gigi didn't know. Viki invited her to the Go Red Ball. Viki arranged to have Shane stay with Matthew and Nigel.\n\n\nBo arrived at Llanfair. Viki introduced Charlie to Bo and confirmed that Charlie was Rex's father. Bo said Rex was a great kid, and maybe he and Charlie could talk sometime. Bo needed to talk to Viki. Charlie offered to take Shane to Asa's mansion, and Gigi left with Lois to find a gown.\n\n\nBo told Viki that Allison had escaped from St. Ann's.\n\n\nTalia and Antonio met at the end of their respective shifts. They looked at their watches and saw that they were off duty. Talia grabbed him, and they kissed passionately.\n\n\nLindsay arrived at the diner and wrote her secret on a card: \"I faked insanity to be cleared of murder charges,\" then put the card into the heart box.\n\n\n",

Blair reads Sam a story when Todd comes into the kitchen. Blair wants to know where Todd had been. Todd lets her know that he had been to Marcie's arraignment and he had been the one responsible for bailing her out of jail. Blair is more than a little confused by Todd's actions.
