Blair groaned in disgust, \"This is going to be interesting!\" At that moment, Marty rushed into the room with a tight grip on Wes's arm. With a devilish smile, T\u00e9a grinned at the couple and exclaimed, \"No, this is going to be interesting!\" Claiming that she was Blair Cramer and that Wes was John, Marty crashed the ball and dragged Wes behind her. While John and Todd appeared concerned by Marty's reckless behavior, T\u00e9a laughed and Blair glared at Marty. \n\n\nWhen Todd inquired about Wes's relationship to Marty, Blair took great delight in revealing that Wes was Marty's new \"boy toy.\" Walking away, Todd stated that he was leaving because he refused to watch Marty embarrass herself. After T\u00e9a's urging, Todd agreed to stay at the ball, but decided to keep his distance from Marty and her friend. Angered that Marty had stolen their tickets, Blair instructed John to fix the situation. While John purchased more tickets, Blair grimaced as Todd and T\u00e9a headed into the ballroom. \n\n\nMeanwhile, inside the ballroom, Dorian and the Buchanans listened as Beaver Calhoun informed David that he was Asa's long-lost son. David was certain that Beaver was mistaken, but Asa's lawyer explained that Asa had indeed fathered David. Observing Clint and Dorian's behavior, Viki surmised that both had knowledge of David's lineage. With the Buchanan clan trailing behind, Beaver, Dorian, and David retreated to a nearby conference room to discuss David's paternity in greater detail. When Viki expressed her displeasure over Clint's secret, Charlie suggested that she join the discussion. He believed that David had surfaced because he also knew that he was Asa's son. Viki and Charlie decided to take part in the family meeting. \n\n\nAs the discussion unfolded, David appeared thrilled to learn that he was part of a family. Beaver disclosed that Asa had left David the entire Buchanan fortune. Dorian immediately began to advise David of his rights as a Buchanan heir. Clint, Bo, Nora, Natalie, and Jared all accused Dorian of marrying David because she had an ulterior motive. Suspicious of them all, Viki shook her head in disgust. As a heated argument ensued, a conflicted David asked for a moment alone with his new bride. David asked Dorian if she knew that he was a Buchanan, and wondered if she married him out of love. Admitting that she knew about his ancestry all along, Dorian remarked, \"You need me now more than ever!\" \n\n\nOut in the hall, Viki listened in disgust as Clint tried to devise a plan to reclaim the family fortune from David. Viki wanted to know why Clint never revealed the truth to her. He said that he didn't tell her because he knew that she would have exposed the truth to David. \n\n\nGigi was shocked when she discovered her sister, Stacy, at the ball. The sisters had been estranged for the previous ten years. Gigi couldn't believe that Stacy had stolen her dress and tickets. After recovering from the initial shock of learning that Stacy was a stripper in Las Vegas and had followed her and Rex back to Llanview, Gigi was touched when her sister admitted that she loved Gigi and wanted to be a part of her life again. Once Gigi expressed her love for Stacy, the sisters discussed their parents. As Rex listened, Gigi informed Stacy that their father had thrown her out of the house when he learned that she was pregnant. \n\n\nWhen Gigi inquired about her parents, Stacy appeared uncomfortable. Gigi was horrified when Stacy announced that their parents were both dead. Apologizing, Stacy stated that she thought Gigi knew about their deaths. Unable to accept the news, Gigi ran off in tears. Rex located Gigi and tried to comfort her, but Gigi regretted that she had never made contact with her parents after their last meeting. As Gigi cried in Rex's arms, Stacy peered around the corner at them. \n\n\nClint argued with someone on the phone about the Buchanans' dilemma, but was unable to receive any satisfaction. Handing her father a drink, Natalie informed him that it was over and that there was nothing that anyone could do about David's inheritance. The frustrated Buchanan family members all held their glasses in the air and offered a toast to Asa. Clint used an unkind word to describe his late father. \n\n\nA disgusted Blair watched as John continued kept his eye on Marty's erratic behavior. Blair stormed off. Nearby, Todd took a drink and looked depressed as he watched Marty interact with Wes. \n\n\nMarty consumed several glasses of wine and flirted with Wes. Wes tried to stop her, but Marty insisted that she wanted to have a good time. Frustrated by Marty's wild behavior, Wes questioned how long she intended to use him in an attempt to hurt John. Admitting that he cared for her, Wes said that he refused to allow her to embarrass herself. Wes told Marty that she was using him to torture Todd and to provoke John. Feeling some guilt over her treatment of Wes, Marty revealed that she was bothered by Roxy's comments about her relationship with John. With a look of concern, Wes gave Marty an affectionate hug. \n\n\nAfter a run-in with Talia, T\u00e9a observed John alone and asked him to dance. John accepted. Watching Cris and Vanessa dance nearby, T\u00e9a asked John about his thoughts of Vanessa being free while Ray was wrongfully imprisoned. Unable to get John to reveal any thoughts on Vanessa, T\u00e9a questioned John about his desire to help Antonio nail Todd. John asked T\u00e9a if Todd had killed Lee, but T\u00e9a reminded him that she had killed the woman in self-defense. John made it clear that he didn't believe that T\u00e9a had killed Lee. Once T\u00e9a realized that John suspected someone other than her or Todd as Lee's killer, T\u00e9a questioned him about any leads he had concerning the case, but John refused to reveal any information. \n\n\nAs Cris and Vanessa danced nearby, Vanessa scowled at T\u00e9a. She told Cris that she didn't trust her. \n\n\nJoining Todd at the bar, Blair teased him about Marty and her date. Annoyed, Todd taunted Blair about being jealous of Marty. When Blair observed T\u00e9a and John dancing, she became upset. A livid Blair attempted to go after T\u00e9a, but Todd stopped her by pulling her close to him. Blair broke away from Todd and continued to insinuate that Marty and Wes were romantically involved. \n\n\nLater, a drunken Marty spotted John dancing with T\u00e9a. Dragging Wes on the dance floor, Marty purposely bumped into the couple and asked T\u00e9a if she could cut in. John ignored Marty's comment, but Marty continued to taunt T\u00e9a. Wes insisted that he and Marty leave, but she refused and pulled away from him. When Wes grabbed her and instructed her to come with him, John ordered him to stay away from her. Annoyed by John's interference, Wes attempted to strike him. Before John could react, Todd punched Wes. As the two men fought, T\u00e9a tried to intervene, but Marty grabbed T\u00e9a's arm and prevented her from doing so. An out of control Marty laughed and remarked, \"Not so tough outside of the courtroom, huh?\" Fed up, T\u00e9a punched Marty. \n\n\nMichael and Marcie enjoyed themselves at the ball. Marcie related that she had decided to move on with her life, despite the fact that she would always think about Hope. When Michael's' co-worker and his wife joined the couple, Marcie was bothered when she learned that the woman was named Hope. Alone together, Marcie admitted that the doctor's wife made her think about baby Hope. Out of concern, Mike suggested that they head home. At the apartment, Mike presented Marcie with a Valentine's Day gift. Marcie was pleased with the beautiful necklace. Michael informed her that the stone was a yellow topaz - Hope's birthstone. Mike stated that he knew that Hope would always be a part of Marcie. Mike revealed that he missed Marcie and wanted to be close to her again. The couple embraced and shared a passionate kiss.\n\n\n",
