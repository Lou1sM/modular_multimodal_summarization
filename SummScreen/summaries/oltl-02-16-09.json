After hesitating for a brief moment, Stacy informed her sister that their parents had been killed in a traffic accident several years earlier. Their father died on the scene, but Mrs. Morasco lingered for quite some time. Gigi was devastated to learn that her mother asked for her from her deathbed. When Gigi expressed shock that her mother thought about her during her dying moments, Stacy related that their mother never forgot about Gigi. Mrs. Morasco had been afraid to turn against her husband, but had secretly wished for Gigi to return home. As Gigi and Rex listened, Stacy rehashed her life after her parent's deaths. Stacy's parents hadn't left her any inheritance, so the young girl was forced to earn money as a stripper. Gigi regretted the time she had lost with her mother and sister. Happy to be reunited, the sisters embraced. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Clint, Nora, Bo, Rene, and Nigel discussed the possible scenarios involving David and Dorian. While Clint tried to convince himself that the Buchanan fortune could be spared from David, Nora urged him to face facts. Nora stated that David was a Buchanan and that the family couldn't stop him from claiming his inheritance. Drowning their sorrows in liquor, the Buchanans tried to forget about the family's problems and joked about their circumstances. \n\n\nAlone in the living room, Clint and Nora shared a drink. As Clint thanked Nora for bringing him back to reality, a drunken Bo and Rene interrupted the couple. Seconds later, Nigel joined the festivities. While Bo, Nora, Rene, and Nigel continued to drink and dance, Clint was deep in thought. He murmured to himself, \"You won, old man!\" \n\n\nInside a conference room of the Palace Hotel, Dorian admitted to knowing the truth about David's paternity. She insisted that he needed her to claim his inheritance and the life that he was entitled to, but David was hurt once he learned that Dorian only showed an interest in him because of the Buchanan riches. David accused Dorian of making a mockery of his religion, but Dorian claimed that she wanted to help David find his true self - as a Buchanan heir. \n\n\nDorian cited the many ways that David could enjoy his newfound wealth, and pleaded with him to share his fortune with her. To Dorian's surprise, David wondered why he should allow her to partake in his riches. Dorian struggled for answers when David reminded her of how she had turned her back on him when she took control of Buchanan Enterprises. David said that he couldn't forget how Dorian had left him penniless. Dorian begged David to forget about the past and share his wealth. Apologizing, Dorian admitted that her hatred for Clint clouded her judgment and caused her to hurt David. She insisted that she really loved him. David realized that Dorian was giving him a snow job. Expressing her regret that she wouldn't be a part of his future life, Dorian kissed David and exited the room. Alone, David pondered his dilemma. \n\n\nAt the Go Red Ball, Todd and Wes fought and T\u00e9a struck Marty. When Blair attempted to provoke T\u00e9a, the women began arguing relentlessly. Meanwhile, Todd broke a beer bottle over Wes's head and Wes responded by placing a knife to Todd's throat. Wes expressed his hatred for Todd and, in a menacing voice, he said, \"Maybe this will shut you up!\" Antonio broke up the altercation and ordered both men to leave. \n\n\nJohn asked to take a look at Wes's knife. Examining the knife, John surprised everyone when he questioned why Wes wasn't carrying the same type of knife that he had used to kill Lee Halpern. An angered Wes denied any involvement in Lee's death and accused John of seeking revenge because of Wes's relationship with Marty. Ignoring Wes's remarks, John informed everyone of Wes's connection to Janet. When he asked if Marty was aware of Wes's secret, Marty related that she knew all the details, and she defended Wes. T\u00e9a maintained that she killed Lee in self-defense, but John didn't believe her. He stated that he considered Wes a suspect. A frustrated Wes stormed off. As Marty attempted to run after him, John suggested that she reconsider her relationship with Wes, but Marty responded by walking away. \n\n\nAfter attempting to break up the fight between Todd and Wes, Fish suffered a slight injury. For a brief moment, Layla gave him some attention, but she was called away to complete her assigned duties at the ball. Afterward, Fish asked Talia if Layla was impressed by his heroics. \n\n\nA sarcastic Blair wondered why John didn't run after Marty. Attempting to change the subject, John suggested that they spend some time alone at Rodi's. Frustrated, Blair told John that he would only be consumed with thoughts of Marty if she agreed to go with him. \n\n\nPulling her close, Antonio danced with T\u00e9a. He urged her to come clean and refute her claim of killing Lee. Realizing that Antonio had cornered tea, Todd interrupted their dance. Alone with Todd, T\u00e9a expressed her theory that Wes had killed Lee and framed Todd. Todd blamed himself for driving Marty into Wes's arms. \n\n\nInside his room, Wes frantically packed his bags and lashed out at Marty. He charged her for using him to make John jealous. Wes blamed Marty for the disaster that transpired at the Go Red Ball - the altercation with Todd, and John publicly accusing him of murder. He believed that Marty had only defended him because she wanted to hurt John. Wes was certain that she believed that he had murdered Lee. As a shocked Marty listened, Wes admitted that he had searched for Lee on the night of her murder. Recalling the pain that Lee had caused his family, Wes told Marty that he knew where to find Lee because Marty had told him the location of the safe house where the police had been holding her. Marty attempted to calm Wes and assured him that she didn't believe that he had killed Lee. Staring at her, Wes remarked, \"How could you possibly know that?\" \n\n\nThe Next Morning... \n\n\nThe janitor cleaned the debris left over from the Ball. Staring at the trashed ballroom, he exclaimed, \"That must have been some party last night!\" \n\n\nDressed in a slip, Nora woke up with a hangover. She was shocked to find a dazed Bo lying beside her. \n\n\nA naked David awoke and discovered Dorian by his side. Smiling and exposing her bare back, Dorian told a dazed and confused David, \"Zip me up!\" \n\n\nLying in bed, Blair rubbed her eyes and begged John for an aspirin. A familiar male voice said, \"Yeah, baby. I'll get you whatever you need.\" Blair cringed when she discovered that Todd was her bed partner. \n\n\nGroggy, Marty rolled over in Wes's bed and was shocked to discover her hands covered in blood. Observing Wes lying on his side, Marty reached out for him. Marty let out a bloodcurdling scream when Wes's limp body rubbed against her. To Marty's horror, Wes had been stabbed in the chest.\n\n\n",
