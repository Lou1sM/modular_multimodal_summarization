She related the message she had received from Cassie that suggested they be wary of strangers. Just as Kelly convinced herself that Adriana was probably off having fun with Emil, she decided that on the contrary, perhaps her cousin was with a killer.\n\n\nAfter leaving several additional voicemails for Adriana, Kelly made a call to London for help. She wanted to speak to one of her family members, but Neville assured her that no one was around except for David. She preferred not to speak to David, but she gave in. David was annoyed and busy and didn't have time for Kelly. When she offered him a free trip to Paris, he advised her that he'd leave right away.\n\n\nBlair arrived at Cole's apartment and demanded that all of its residents pack up to leave. Starr refused to listen to Blair and said that she wasn't taking orders from her mother. A frantic Blair didn't want to take the time to explain it all, but she advised Starr and Cole that everyone related to Dorian was in danger. She thought it was a good idea for them to relocate to Todd's house.\n\n\nMarkko returned home and found Starr and Cole in a state of confusion. Blair explained that she had received the warning from Cassie, not Dorian. She was willing to take Cassie's advice as good advice. Markko headed to his bedroom to retrieve Langston and was beside himself when he discovered that she was not there.\n\n\nEveryone was concerned about Langston, but Blair didn't think it was a good idea to call the police since Lowell and Mitch controlled many of the officers. Starr assured her mother that Dani was safe with Rachel and Matthew. Markko thought it was worth a try to call Langston.\n\n\nLangston arrived at Llanview University and let herself into Ford's darkened office. As she made her way inside, she was grabbed from behind. Langston used her instincts and managed to fight her assailant off. As he fell to the ground, she turned on the lights and was shocked to see a half-naked Ford.\n\n\nLangston apologized for using her kickboxing skills but she had defended herself against a potential rapist, she explained. She had been unable to sleep and thought she could work on her musical since she had the office key. Ford thought she was a burglar. He informed her that he was spending the night in his office because his apartment was without heat.\n\n\nAs she collected her things to leave, Ford attempted to persuade Langston to stay but Langston advised him that she preferred to be alone when she worked. Ford reminded her that she had his work schedule and she should \"plan accordingly\" for her return visit. As she was about to walk out the door, Ford leaned over and began to kiss her. She returned his kiss, but they pulled apart when Langston's phone began to ring.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Dorian spotted Viki and insisted on speaking to her. Viki was less than thrilled to see her archenemy. \"How's Jessica?\" Dorian asked. Viki snapped that Jessica was in surgery and fighting for her life, no thanks to Dorian. Viki realized that it was Dorian who had put Charlie up to shooting Mitch, but Dorian insisted that she had good reasons. Jessica might die, Viki added. Viki noted that Dorian always had reasons for her actions but was selfish and unthinking.\n\n\nDorian apologized and blamed Mitch for all of her actions. She tried to explain that there had been \"dire underlying circumstances\" for all that she had done. While Viki accused Dorian of being nothing more than Mitch's pawn, Dorian tried to explain that it was to save the lives of her girls and she was desperate.\n\n\nViki faulted Dorian for allowing the entire town to suffer as a result of her actions. Dorian acknowledged that she thought she would be able to fix things eventually. Viki was disgusted that Dorian had seen Charlie as an \"easy mark\" to use as her \"fix.\" Dorian believed that Charlie would have achieved some peace if he had been able to shoot Mitch. Viki felt that Dorian was willing to trade the lives of her girls for everyone else's.\n\n\nDorian admitted that she had made a mistake and she had been trying to stop Charlie from ruining his life. Viki only hoped that Dorian's girls would be safe from Dorian some day. Dorian thought that Viki would be happy to hear that the Cramer women had cut Dorian out of their lives after she had hired Lowell.\n\n\nNearby, Brody explained the chain of events at the observatory to Clint and how Charlie accidentally shot Jessica when Dorian intervened. Clint was convinced that Dorian was actually trying to protect Mitch and he was ready to kill the \"bitch.\" Just then, Lowell stepped off an elevator with a couple of his officers and advised Brody he was under arrest. As Clint threatened the police commissioner, he too was placed in handcuffs.\n\n\nThe men were walked out to the area where Viki and Dorian stood. Lowell informed Dorian that her friends had broken the law. After some words between them, Dorian advised Lowell that he was fired. She ordered the accompanying police officers to release Brody and Clint. \n\n\nLowell ordered the men not to listen to her. Dorian announced his termination again and requested his badge. She told him it was effective immediately. She accused him of misusing his office and waging a personal vendetta. When Lowell suggested that Dorian had no proof, she retorted that she didn't like him. She held out her hand for his badge.\n\n\nDorian apologized to Clint but he turned his back and walked away. She promised Brody that Lowell would not trouble him and his partner any longer. \"If you think this squares us, you are so wrong,\" Viki spat at her. Dorian replied that she hadn't done it for Viki but thought that Lowell was a menace. \n\n\nViki advised Dorian that she would never vote for her in the future, but Dorian was sure she might be impeached anyway. She advised Viki that Mitch was a threat to everyone and that if Viki wanted to join forces with her, Viki knew where to find her. Viki couldn't believe that Dorian thought Viki would unite with her. Dorian felt that things would get done if they were together. She pointed to her head and wordlessly mouthed \"Think about it,\" as she left the scene.\n\n\nViki was angry at the guys for their exploits. She wondered what would have happened to them if Dorian hadn't fired Lowell. Viki cried on Clint's shoulder that she just wanted to have her babies home.\n\n\nAt the lake, Schuyler performed CPR on an unconscious Gigi after Rex pulled her out of the water. Finally, she revived and coughed up some water. She screamed for the baby but she was assured that the infant was safe. She told Rex that his daughter was named Sierra Rose. Suddenly, Stacy walked towards the group and called out for her daughter. She unknowingly began to cross the cracking ice. The others shouted out to her to stop but she didn't appear to comprehend. She wanted her baby.\n\n\nIn a matter of seconds, Stacy plunged into the icy water. Schuyler was insistent that Gigi and the baby get to the hospital and he led them to a car. Rex and Oliver remained to help Stacy, but they were unsuccessful in getting her to grab onto the same rope that they tried to recover Gigi with. Stacy cried out that she didn't want to die as Rex made his way to her slowly. More of the ice began to crack. She wanted him to know the truth and she told him she was sorry. Suddenly, she disappeared below the surface.\n\n\nRex removed his shoes gingerly. He wanted to jump into the water after Stacy. Oliver attempted to talk him out of it, but it was no use. Rex dove in and searched for Stacy. Oliver called out to them both and finally Rex appeared, alone. Oliver was insistent that Rex would die if he remained in the frigid water any longer. He reminded Rex that Shane needed his father. Rex allowed himself to be pulled to safety.\n\n\nSchuyler made a phone call as he drove Gigi and Sierra Rose towards the hospital. He informed Gigi that a rescue team was on its way to the lake. Gigi was worried about leaving the scene, but Schuyler assured her she had been right. He was concerned about the baby and he was sure everyone would be okay. Gigi explained that she had been outside looking for Schuyler, but she found Stacy lying in the snow. She had accused her sister of not being pregnant with Rex's baby, but after Stacy went into labor, Gigi realized she had been wrong.\n\n\nGigi wondered what Schuyler had originally wanted to tell her as he made his way up the mountain. Schuyler was sure that it could wait. He promised that the baby would get help at the hospital. Gigi thought that Sierra Rose was strong, just like her mother and father. Schuyler made another call and advised Gigi that the emergency room was waiting for their arrival.\n\n\nLangston took Markko's call and advised Ford that she needed to leave right away. She thought it was best to take a cab. When she returned home, she found her roommates packed and ready to go. Markko filled her in on the latest turn of events. In response to Markko's questioning, she stated that she had been at the university library to work on her musical. Blair looked at her skeptically. Before everyone could leave, Dorian arrived accompanied by two FBI agents. She announced that she had fired Lowell and she had some explaining to do.\n\n\nAs a rendition of \"You Belong to Me\" played on the car radio, Gigi shared with Schuyler that she used to sing the song to Shane.\n\n\nRex and Oliver stood by the lake helplessly as a rescue unit arrived. Oliver did his best to comfort Rex. He said that Rex did what he could, but it was an impossible situation. They couldn't believe Stacy was gone. \"That little girl doesn't have a mother,\" Rex pronounced.\n\n\nDorian shared a photo with her family. They saw the holiday greeting with the Cramer women's faces crossed out.\n\n\nViki, Clint, and Brody waited for word on Jessica as Gigi and Schuyler arrived at the hospital with Sierra Rose in tow. Gigi told the nurse that the baby's parents were on the way. \n\n\n",

But Stacy appears and falls through the ice and they fail to save her. They all assume that baby Sierra Rose is without a mommy. And we can only guess who will be her guardian. Dorian confesses to Viki, Clint and Brody that she put Charlie up to shooting Mitch and that's how Jessica got shot. They are not going to forgive her. But she fires Lowell and reinstates Brody to the force. Blair tells Starr, Cole, Langston and Markko she needs them to come with her and stay at Todd's where there is top security, after Cassie has contacted her to inform her what Dorian has warned them off regarding Mitch's threat.",
