Knowing they won't have a cent to their name, they all wonder what to do. David and Dorian appear and tell them it's time to get the hell out of their home. Stacy stays at Gigi and Rex's home. But she brings Fish over. She has seduced him the previous night but doesn't want anybody to know. At that point, he announces to Layla that he's found somebody else assuming Stacy is serious about him. Blair and Todd wake up together in his bed. She asks how that happened. He reminds her that he wasn't going to let her drive home drunk, have their kids see her in the state she was in and he couldn't go to Dorian's house since he has a restraining order. And they both know that John and Wes have been fighting over Marty. At Wes's, Marty awakens with blood on her hands and freaks when she sees that somebody stabbed Wes to death. John attempts to help her. Blair goes and observes them standing over Wes's dead body and calls the cops to report a murder.",
