He told them there was no news on Jessica, who was still in surgery.  Just then, a nurse walked in and told Viki she had news on her other daughter: Natalie had arrived at the emergency room.  Viki and Clint were loath to leave Jessica, but Brody promised to stay and alert them to any news.\n\n\nNearby, in the ER, John and Marty helped the wounded Natalie hobble towards an exam room.  Sensing the tension between the trio, Natalie pleaded with John to leave her alone, but John was determined to make sure she was all right.  After they moved Natalie into the exam room and Marty remained in the corridor to call Cole, Kyle examined Natalie's sprained ankle.  He asked John about Oliver, and John told him that Oliver was still searching for Stacy on Llantano Mountain.  Natalie urged John to check on Marty.\n\n\nAt Cole and Starr's apartment, Dorian unspooled her story to the assembled Cramer girls, along with Cole and Markko, while the FBI agents stood by.  Blair, Langston, and Starr remained skeptical on key points, such as why Dorian had appointed Lowell as Commissioner of Police, and why she hadn't told any of them the truth about Mitch's threats.  Dorian whipped out the defaced Cramer Christmas card once more, and explained that Mitch had not only threatened them, but poisoned the holiday eggnog in December, after which she'd agreed to his demands to fire Bo and hire Lowell.  Langston and Starr didn't believe Mitch could've been a threat while under lock and key in the hospital and then prison, but Blair agreed with Dorian: due to Mitch's worldwide network of followers, he was a threat no matter where he was.\n\n\nAs Dorian and the girls talked, Cole took Marty's call, and, after hanging up, he informed the others that John, Marty, and Natalie were all right.  Dorian was delighted to hear the good news, and hoped that they would all emerge alive from their ordeal with Mitch.  She assured Langston that the entire Cramer family was safe, as Cassie, Kelly, and Adriana had all been forewarned.  She added that she'd fired Lowell, but the reparations weren't enough for Blair, who blasted her aunt for not telling them about Mitch's threats sooner and for endangering the entire town.  Dorian swore she'd done it all out of love for her family, and Langston and Starr found themselves softening to her pleas.\n\n\nGrabbing Langston and Starr for a huddle, Blair asked them if they were willing to forgive Dorian.  As Dorian awaited their answer, the FBI agents told her it was time to go.  The other Cramers broke their conclave, curious as to why Dorian was being escorted away.  Speaking haltingly, Dorian was forced to explain to the girls that she'd pulled Charlie's gun on Mitch.  The girls were stunned when the agents explained that Charlie had accidentally shot Jessica.\n\n\nBefore Dorian could go into more detail, the agents hustled her out of the apartment.  As Dorian left, rambling about how she'd been forced to partake of Viki's closet during the snowstorm, she told the girls she'd wanted to do the right thing, for their sakes.\n\n\nWith Dorian gone, the Cramers and their beaus struggled to deal with everything she'd told them.  \"This is so Aunt Dorian,\" Starr said with a sigh, suspicious that Dorian had something to do with Charlie's attack on Mitch.  Blair was sure Dorian had been in on it but wasn't  able to speak in front of the FBI agents, while Cole said he could understand why a good man like Charlie had been pushed too far by the death of his son.  Blair said that Mitch got inside people's heads, and was probably the most dangerous man she'd ever met.  \"Well, that's saying something,\" Cole replied.\n\n\nStarr feared for Jessica, and Blair suggested she call Viki for news.  As they checked the time, Starr and Langston realized that Cole and Markko were due at their morning classes.  The boys were reluctant to leave the girls unattended, but the girls said they'd be fine, as they were aware of the danger and Mitch was in custody.  After they left, Starr continued to fume about Dorian's manipulations, but Blair said she could understand Dorian's motives, if not her methods; she suspected the only way to deal with Mitch once and for all was to do something drastic.\n\n\nStarr headed into her bedroom to feed Hope, which left Blair and Langston still absorbing Dorian's news.  Blair surmised that Langston had more on her mind than Dorian, and grilled her about her \"night at the library.\"  Langston admitted that she'd gone to Ford's office; she hadn't expected to find him, but they'd ended up kissing again.  Blair warned the girl to put a stop to things with Ford before someone got hurt.  Langston said she would never hurt Markko, but as Blair left to check on Starr and Hope, she told Langston that she hadn't meant Markko - she'd meant Langston herself.\n\n\nIn the offices of the film department at Llanview University, Ford held Langston's scarf and reminisced about their intimate encounter the night before.  Cristian arrived to inform Ford that the heat was back on in their building.  When he noticed the scarf, Ford told him he'd had a lady visitor while staying in the office overnight.  Ford sneered that his \"visitor\" was playing hard to get, but he'd wear her down.\n\n\nCristian asked if university students were throwing themselves at him, and Ford didn't deny it.  Apprehensive, Cris asked Ford if he was really involved with someone from LU, but all Ford would say was that it was not one of his own students, and, after all, he was only a teaching assistant.  Cristian said that dating students was nothing but trouble, and added that he was on the grounds to pick up his teaching certificate; he was taking over Nick Chavez's art class at Llanview High while Nick was on leave.  Cristian suggested he and Layla double date with Ford and his new lady friend, but Ford quickly said it wouldn't be a good idea.\n\n\nAs Cris left Ford's office, he ran into Cole and Markko, who were on their way into the building.  As Cole headed for the cafeteria, Markko stopped to speak to Ford.  When Markko entered, Ford shoved Langston's scarf into a desk drawer, and hustled Markko out to talk to him about his latest project.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, John left Natalie's exam room to look for Marty, but found Mitch being dragged out by two FBI agents.  John told the agents to lock Mitch up.  Mitch taunted John, and needled him about John's feelings for Natalie, who Mitch still considered his wife.  As Marty finished her call to Cole and listened in, Mitch said he'd always be with John.\n\n\nAfter Mitch was carted off, Marty made a beeline past John, but John stopped her and asked her to wait.  Before they could start talking, Viki and Clint rushed down the corridor, and asked after Natalie.  John and Marty led them back into the exam room, and Viki and Clint raced to Natalie's side.  As Marty seethed, Kyle reassured them that Natalie would be fine thanks to John's assistance during the storm.\n\n\nClint and Viki told Natalie that Mitch was in federal custody, but Jessica had been shot.  Natalie assumed that Mitch was the culprit, and was shocked when Viki told her it had been Charlie.  Viki said the details didn't matter yet, but insisted Jessica would be fine.  Turning to John, she thanked him again for saving Natalie.  Disgusted, Marty left the room.\n\n\nJohn followed Marty into the corridor and again asked her to wait, but Marty wasn't having it.  Pulling away, she told him she was going to check on Jessica.\n\n\nInside the exam room, Natalie continued to worry about Jessica.  As John reentered, he suggested Viki and Clint go back to the operating ward for news on Jessica, while he stayed with Natalie.  Anxious about Marty, Natalie disagreed, but Viki told her that \"fugitive\" John was not likely to be a priority for the police department with Lowell ousted and no commissioner seated.  After Viki and Clint left, Natalie told John he shouldn't be there - he needed to find Marty, and make things right.\n\n\nJohn said that he and Marty would work things out, but Natalie feared that Marty would never forgive him for the kiss she'd walked in on.  John asked Natalie why she'd lied for him, and Natalie said she'd merely stretched the truth; she had kissed him while hallucinating, but only the first time.  Natalie dismissed their second kiss as a desperate act in desperate times, but John wasn't so sure.\n\n\n\"You're right,\" Natalie admitted. \"It could only have been you.\"  But it was only a weak moment, and it didn't matter; she was still in love with Jared, who had her heart, and John had a good thing with Marty if he didn't screw it up.  She urged him to go to Marty and save his relationship.\n\n\nIn the waiting area outside Jessica's operating room, Marty visited Brody,to look for news.  Brody didn't have anything to report, but told Marty there was more to fear than Jessica's gunshot wound.  He explained that Mitch had used electroshock therapy on Jessica, and that when he'd found her, she couldn't remember him or Bree.  Marty was horrified that an amateur like Mitch could have wiped out Jessica's memories.  Brody didn't know what it meant for Jessica, or for their life together; he asked Marty if he'd lost Jessica forever.\n\n\nMarty told Brody that most electroshock patients suffering from amnesia recovered in twenty-four hours, or only had partial memory loss, but it was difficult to be sure.  Brody admitted that he hadn't told Viki or Clint about the amnesia because he wasn't sure they could take that on top of what he'd told them about how he'd found Jessica.  He explained to Marty that Mitch had attempted to rape Jessica.  Stunned, Marty feared the worst due to Jessica's compounded traumas.\n\n\nMarty told Brody that he needed to tell Viki and Clint everything, and assured him they'd only be more hurt by finding out when they saw Jessica.  Viki and Clint returned to the waiting area, and Marty headed to her office.  As Brody worked his way up to telling them about the amnesia, Viki told him that Natalie was all right, and thanked God for their good fortune; she couldn't take any more bad news.\n\n\nBrody stood silent as Viki and Clint went over family concerns, such as calling Bo, Nora, Shane, and Bree back from Texas.  He winced as Viki spoke about reuniting Bree with her mother.  Unable to hold it in any longer, Brody explained to the concerned parents that there was something they needed to know.  Before he could spill the beans, however, the nurse returned and told them that Jessica was out of surgery, and that Greg would meet them in the recovery area.  As Viki and Clint hurried out, Brody's shoulders sagged, and he trudged after them.\n\n\nDown in the ER, Kyle returned to Natalie's exam room and sent John packing.  In the corridor, John ran into Marty; he asked about Jessica, while she asked after Natalie.  John said Natalie would be all right, but Marty questioned whether their relationship was all right.  Then, she dismissed her concerns, and said it wasn't the time or the place.  Before John could get a word in edgewise, Marty stormed off.\n\n\nAt the police station, Charlie endured a rapid-fire interrogation from the federal agents who had taken over Mitch's case.  The agents asked him why he'd shot Jessica, and Charlie insisted it had been an accident; overcome, he said he didn't care what happened to himself, and he'd give his life to save hers.  Before Charlie could say any more, Elijah entered and told Charlie to keep quiet.  He introduced himself as Charlie's attorney.  Charlie assumed Viki had hired him, but Elijah informed him that Dorian had hired Elijah to represent both Charlie and herself, and took Charlie down to the waiting area for a private talk.\n\n\nIn the waiting area, Charlie couldn't understand why Dorian needed a lawyer, and Elijah explained that she'd attempted to kill Mitch as well.  As Charlie asked if Dorian succeeded, Mitch, shackled and accompanied by armed guards, sauntered into the station.  Mitch warned Charlie that his retribution was nigh, and said Charlie would pay dearly if Jessica died.  Elijah ordered the agents to take Mitch away, but Mitch continued to verbally assail Charlie, and called him a man with nothing to live for.  Jared was gone, Viki would leave him, and he was facing charges; Mitch suggested Charlie simply curl up into a bottle and die.\n\n\nMitch and Charlie continued to lock eyes from across the room as Dorian was escorted into the station.  Shortly thereafter, Mitch was hauled down to the cell block, and he taunted Dorian with promises of their sharing adjoining cells once more.  Elijah greeted Dorian and told her that the Feds had all but taken over the station, while the LPD were in chaos.  As he left to start moving Dorian and Charlie's cases along, Dorian took a seat beside her co-conspirator.\n\n\nCharlie told Dorian he didn't need a lawyer, and didn't deserve any help; he deserved to pay for what he'd done.  Dorian disagreed, and said he had nothing to apologize for.  Charlie reminded her that his hand had held the gun, but Dorian said hers might as well have; she'd pushed him into their alliance to kill Mitch.  All Charlie could think about was Jessica, and Dorian said she feared for her, as well, but didn't regret stopping Charlie from committing murder.  She told Charlie that he reminded her of her late husband, Mel, and said she knew that he was a good man who wouldn't have been able to live with taking a life.\n\n\nDorian suggested they pray for Jessica's recovery.  Charlie wasn't sure prayer worked, but Dorian said it had helped her keep her girls safe.  \"Are you sure about that, Dorian?\" Mitch purred as he was led back through the station by the guards.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Paris, France, Kelly greeted David at the entrance to Caf\u00e9 Maisonette.  David assumed he had been summoned on an emergency shopping trip to counter-balance what he called Kelly's terrible fashion sense, but Kelly said she'd called him because there was a real emergency and no one else was available.  \"Well, let's put our heads together and if we end up making out, I won't get mad this time,\" David suggested.  Kelly told him to get serious; Adriana was in danger, and Mitch Laurence was gunning for the Cramer family.\n\n\nDavid was skeptical that Mitch's reach extended to Europe, but Kelly said that Dorian and Cassie's warnings had convinced her of the imminent peril to all the Cramer women.  David told Kelly to give him the whole story; as the former star of television hit Supermodel Crime Club, he was uniquely qualified to crack the case.  Kelly explained that she'd let Adriana leave the cafe with Emile Moreau, the handsome Frenchman they'd met.  Emile had told them he'd worked for a \"powerful man,\" a phrase that set off alarms for David.  Kelly told David she'd called Adriana over and over but received no answer, and feared the worst  - that Emile was one of Mitch's minion.\n\n\nDavid said their solution was to trace Emile's whereabouts since the caf\u00e9, but Kelly couldn't figure out how to do so.  Nodding at the waiter, David pointed out that the receipts of the most recent customers would still be at the nearby wait station, and that if they could get Emile's receipt, they could track him using his credit card number.  Kelly didn't see how the last four digits of Emile's credit card were relevant.  \"Oh, Kelly,\" David sighed, \"you would be a terrible detective on television.\"  He told her to let him handle things, after she created a diversion.\n\n\nSnatching up a box of raisins, David told Kelly to use one of the oldest tricks in the book to distract the waiter's attention.  Kelly wasn't convinced their plan would work, but David said the raisin gag would work like a charm: \"These people love Jerry Lewis.\"  As David crept over to the wait station, Kelly distracted the waiter by making a scene; dropping the raisin in her soup, she told the waiter it was a fly.  As the waiter took the soup away, David quickly grabbed Emile's receipt and headed back to their table.\n\n\nDavid told Kelly they were hot on the trail of Emile Moreau, \"kidnapper and purchaser of fine French champagne.\"  He quickly called Emile's bank, adopted an overwrought French accent, and attempted to bluff his way through a call to track Emile's purchases since the cafe.  Unfortunately, David ran into more stumbling blocks with the bank representatives than he'd foreseen, as they requested information he did not have: \"'Maiden name of ma m\u00e8re?  This is a trick question!\"  Fed up, Kelly grabbed the phone and told the bank representative her story about Adriana's potential kidnapping, and begged for information about Emile's last location and purchase.\n\n\nKelly was in luck; the bank representative gave her Emile's last known location.  David still didn't approve of her methods, though: \"Only an amateur would resort to the truth.\"  After she hung up, the duo sprang to their feet.  Kelly told David that if Mitch had Adriana, they had to find her fast, and David agreed.  With that, they raced out of the caf\u00e9. \n\n\n",
