    "soap_central": "\nKarma's A Bitch\n\n\nAs David ordered the Buchanans to \"get the hell out of my house,\" pandemonium ensued. Clint attempted to reason with David, but found himself frozen out when he refused to address his new brother as \"David Buchanan.\" When Matthew returned home from school and asked what was going on, David and Dorian gleefully informed the teen that he had a new \"Uncle David\" and had become a cousin to Starr and the rest of the Cramers by marriage. \"Malheureusement, your half of the family will be living elsewhere!\" Dorian trilled, reveling in her malaprop of French. Dorian told the family that federal marshals were waiting outside and that they had an hour to vacate the premises or be evicted. \n\n\nDisgusted at losing two homes in two years, Matthew shunned Nora's comforting shoulder and stormed off to pack his things. Clint asked David what had become of his Buddhist faith, and David explained that he'd discovered his true calling: running Buchanan Enterprises. Clint appealed to David's sense of family, reminding him that Buchanan Enterprises was a complicated business and he would need his brothers' guiding hands. David rejected Clint's overtures, and attacked him and Bo for hiding the truth from him for months based on who he was. David said he wouldn't be a pushover anymore; \"for once in my life, I'm gonna look out for myself!\" \"Karma's a bitch, ain't it?\" Dorian cackled. \n\n\nRenee raged at David, angered that he would evict them from the home Asa had meant for her and Matthew to keep forever. She said they would simply move into the Palace Hotel, but was horrified when Dorian produced documentation from the will codicil indicating that all Asa's previously bequeathed assets deferred to David. Dismayed, Nora verified the document's legitimacy. David tore into Renee for refusing him room, board, and service over the years, and looking down upon him. He told the family they could try to get suites at the Palace: \"Too bad for you we'll be booked for the rest of your lives.\" \n\n\nAs the Buchanans prepared to pack and leave, David stopped Nigel, requesting that he continue as the faithful family butler. Nigel refused, and explained that he had been responsible for keeping the secret of the heir since Asa's death. He said he had felt David was too dangerous and irresponsible to be allowed near the Buchanan billions. Head held high, Nigel said David was not worthy of the Buchanan name. Clint said they would also need a second round of DNA evidence to verify David's claim, leading Bo to tear some hairs out of David's scalp, much to Dorian's chagrin. \n\n\nWhile the Buchanans exited the mansion with their bags, Clint warned Dorian that their fight wasn't over, and they would be back. Dorian laughed in his face, and, as the doors shut, she and David gloated in their victory. Heading straight for Asa's liquor cabinet, they toasted, as Dorian asked to be called both \"Dr.\" and \"Buchanan.\" \"Here's to you, Dr. Buchanan,\" David said as Dorian drew him into a passionate kiss. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Starr ran into Cole eyeing the front page of the Intruder, which showed the brawl at the Go Red Ball between Todd and Wes. Both teens were embarrassed for their parents, and while Cole was pleased to see Todd over a barrel, he admitted he hated Wes as much as he hated Todd. He complained that Wes continued enabling Marty's destructive behavior instead of encouraging her to return home to her family. Cole confessed that he'd gone to see Marty the night before, but said he had left before knocking when he'd heard Wes's voice from inside. \n\n\nChanging subjects, Cole let Starr open his letter from Llanview University. Starr was overjoyed to discover that Cole had been accepted for the fall semester, and embraced him before apologizing for violating his space. Cole said it was all right, and that he didn't really hate her for perjuring herself on the stand. Starr asked if Cole would consider giving up drugs, since he had a future to look forward to. Cole remained ambivalent. Starr asked Cole if he wanted to talk some more, but Cole told her he was all right, and urged her to go to her afternoon session with Mr. Joplin. \n\n\nJessica arrived at St. Anne's to see Brody, but received only a barrage of taunts from one of her former group therapy colleagues. As the fellow patient harangued Jessica about her close relationship with Brody, one of the nuns knocked on Brody's door, but got no answer. When the trio entered the room, they found no sign of Brody, and a perfectly made-up bed. Just as the nun phoned security, Brody turned up in the hallway. He apologized to the irate nun for his disappearance, and said he'd only been taking a walk around the grounds. \n\n\nWhen questioned about the bed, Brody said he'd made it up in the morning in accordance with Navy discipline. After the nun and the fellow patient left, Jessica told Brody to fess up; she didn't buy his story. Brody admitted he'd been gone since the previous evening, and had broken out, needing to get away from St. Anne's and get some space. Jessica told Brody she could relate to his need for freedom. She presented him with a gift: homemade cookies and an Ernest Hemingway novel, because she felt Hemingway wrote about war better than anyone else. Brody was touched by Jessica's gesture. He said it got lonely at St. Anne's without her, and explained that Wes had not been back to see him since confessing his lie about the \"friendly fire\" incident with the Iraqi child. \n\n\nGrowing upset, Brody told Jessica he wished Wes had just told him the truth in the first place; maybe that way, Brody wouldn't have ended up alone in St. Anne's. Jessica told Brody she hoped he would be free like her soon, ready to move forward with his life. As Brody began to walk Jessica out of the facility, the two ran into the pesky patient in the hallway. The addled woman told Brody and Jessica she had bad news: Brody's friend Wes was dead. \n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at Todd's house and entered his bedroom just as Todd began a fresh round of whining about Wes, staring at the Intruder headline on their website. Todd told T\u00e9a he badly wanted a piece of Wes, who he, ironically enough, claimed was \"taking advantage of Marty.\" Todd asked T\u00e9a why she'd come, and T\u00e9a said she was there to say goodbye. His case was concluded, and their business relationship was at an end. As she handed Todd her large fee, T\u00e9a said she'd awarded herself a bonus for taking the rap on Lee Halpern's murder. \n\n\nAmused by T\u00e9a's entrepreneurial spirit, Todd signed her check, as T\u00e9a noticed Blair's earrings on the bedroom floor. Growing edgy, T\u00e9a demanded to know how Blair's wardrobe got into Todd's bedroom. Todd admitted that the intoxicated Blair had slept it off at his place the night before, and assured T\u00e9a there had been no romantic reunion. He noticed T\u00e9a's frazzled demeanor, and asked if she was jealous. T\u00e9a vehemently denied any jealousy, and said she was through with any romantic relationship with Todd. Growing forlorn, she asked if they could be friends. Todd said he didn't have- or want-any friends, but accepted T\u00e9a's overture. When T\u00e9a suggested they get a bite to eat, Todd agreed, but said he needed to shower first. Todd exited for the bathroom, leaving T\u00e9a alone with Blair's earring, and her thoughts. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Marty and John were shocked to see Blair step into the doorway of Wes' apartment and call 9-1-1. When Talia answered at the police station, Blair told her Wes Grainger had been murdered, and she was staring at the culprit: Marty Saybrooke. After she'd hung up, John attacked Blair, and told her to let him handle the situation. Blair shot back that the gory scene seemed to speak for itself, while the shell-shocked Marty said nothing. Blair said she'd come to see John to apologize for her conduct at the Go Red Ball, but was angered to find him once again playing Marty's white knight. Blair castigated Marty for being a violent and irresponsible woman who neglected her own son and tried to drive men to suicide. She challenged Marty to tell them that things weren't as they appeared, and that Marty hadn't killed Wes. Dazed and confused, Marty could only stare into space. \n\n\nAs the Llanview Police Department arrived at the hotel, Antonio and Talia took charge of the crime scene. Talia ushered the bloodstained Marty out to change her clothes, while John held a furtive conference with Antonio. He explained how he'd come upon Marty, and said that the door had been locked when he'd arrived. When Antonio asked Blair how she'd gotten involved and where she'd spent the night, Blair hedged on the details. She demanded they arrest Marty for murder, and a clean-scrubbed Marty arrived just in time to agree with her. Marty told Antonio she couldn't remember the details of the previous evening beyond her fight with Wes, and said she couldn't be sure whether or not she'd killed him. John advised her to get a lawyer, but Marty said she wouldn't need one. \n\n\nAs the cops prepared to take Marty in for questioning, Blair asked John to leave with her. John was reticent, and Antonio told them they also needed to come to the station for questioning. John told Antonio he knew he wasn't a cop anymore, but put his two cents in, fingering Todd for the murder. He said Todd had motive, and that the knife Wes was killed with was the same one he had brandished on Todd at the Go Red Ball. Blair defended Todd, and refused to believe that he could have committed such a savage act. She trashed John and the cops for refusing to look at Marty, the obvious perpetrator. \n\n\nOn her way out of the hotel, Marty said a tearful goodbye to Wes as he was zipped into a body bag, and told him she was sorry. As Marty and the cops exited the scene, Antonio asked John how many people could have wanted Wes Grainger dead. John admitted it could've been any number of Llanview citizens. The news report hit television screens across town in a montage; Cole saw the report at the Buenos Dias, while T\u00e9a turned on Todd's TV and was hit with the news. As the police hustled Marty out of the building, John comforted her, leaving Blair to watch. \n\n\n",
