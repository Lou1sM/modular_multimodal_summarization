    "soap_central": "\n On Frozen Pond \n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, John led Mitch to his maximum-security cell. \"Enjoy your new home,\" John smirked at the prisoner. \"I won't be here long,\" Mitch responded. Mitch was sure that Jessica would pull through, and he denied that he had been trying to rape his daughter. He was merely \"trying to keep his covenant alive.\"\n\n\nMitch announced that he wanted both Dorian and Charlie to pay for their misdeed. As he toyed with his Holy Bible, he declared, \"What goes around comes around.\"  John had enough of Mitch. \"Enjoy your new digs,\" he scoffed at the inmate.\n\n\nDorian and Charlie, anxious to hear their fate, sat in the waiting room. Dorian tried to get hold of her girls in Paris, as she was beside herself with worry over their safety. Unable to reach them, she called Cassie in Savannah. Cassie assured Dorian that her windows and doors were locked tight. \"We're all fine,\" Cassie told her mother.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Brody was about to tell Viki and Clint about Jessica's imprisonment with Mitch, but Greg emerged from surgery and gave everyone the good news. Jessica was a strong and lucky woman who would make a complete recovery, he advised them. Viki and Clint were overjoyed, but they noticed that Brody was quiet. He needed to prepare them for the worst, he explained. He recounted his arrival at Mitch's hideout and his discovery that Mitch had given Jessica an electroshock treatment. She had no idea who Brody was when she saw him, Brody confided to her horrified parents.\n\n\nClint was ready to kill Mitch after he heard the news. Brody noted that Mitch wanted Jessica to be rid of \"unnecessary details.\" \"Like her family?\" Clint asked. Greg advised the family that they would be able to visit with Jessica, and Viki and Clint nervously made their way to their daughter's side. A sleeping Jessica opened her eyes and spotted her parents. \"Where am I?\" she asked them. She didn't recall being shot but she recognized her parents. Viki and Clint were pleased and told her that there was another person waiting to see her.\n\n\nThey left the room and sent Brody in. Viki was sure that Jessica's memory loss was temporary.\n\n\nGigi and Schuyler hovered over baby Sierra Rose as she lay wrapped up in an incubator in intensive care. They were waiting for test results, and Schuyler thought it was a good idea to hunt for the doctor. Gigi opted to stay behind with the infant. Kyle looked through the window and watched as Gigi spoke quietly to the baby girl. She whispered that she admired Schuyler for showing concern for another man's baby. Schuyler ran into an anxious Kyle in the hall. Kyle wondered if Oliver knew about the baby, and Schuyler responded affirmatively.\n\n\nKyle admitted that he had confided the truth to Roxy about the baby's father because he cared about her too much. He thought it would be fair if Schuyler reported him for violating patient confidentiality. Schuyler admitted that he had also informed Rex of the truth, but he hadn't had the opportunity to tell Gigi. Kyle suggested that Schuyler tell her before someone else did. Kyle wondered to himself if the baby could belong to Oliver.\n\n\nGigi continued to speak to her brand-new niece and confided that she never thought she'd be able to look at the baby. She admitted that her heart didn't care about Sierra Rose's parents, and she loved the baby girl. The birth had reunited Gigi and Stacy, and Gigi realized she had missed her sister. Sierra Rose's birth had been two miracles in one, Gigi cried. She wanted to establish a new relationship with Stacy.\n\n\nIn Paris, Kelly and David located the hotel where Emile had made his last credit card transaction. Thanks to the credit card company, they knew that he had booked a room. A worried Kelly blamed herself for sending Adriana off with a stranger. She had only been trying to help her cousin get over Rex, she said despondently.\n\n\nKnocking on all of the hotel room doors proved a difficult task. Kelly continued to ignore Dorian's phone calls. When they encountered a maid in the hallway, David offered her some money in exchange for some information. The maid proved to be an excellent informant and Kelly and David were soon standing before one of the rooms. When Kelly didn't receive an answer to her knock, she asked David to kick the door in.\n\n\nDavid proved incapable and Kelly took it upon herself to do the deed. With all of her might she gave a kick and the door flew open. \"Oh my God,\" she yelled. Adriana was half-clothed and tied to the bedposts. A shirtless Emile emerged from another room, and Kelly proceeded to chase him with something heavy that she picked up quickly as she ran around the room. \"Your days of working for Mitch are over,\" she yelled.\n\n\nAdriana finally managed to calm Kelly down as she explained that she was tied up at her own request. She and Emile were playing a \"sex game\" that was one of her fantasies. An impressed David blurted, \"Wow, you really can take the convent out of the girl.\" Adriana explained that the important man that Emile worked for was the prime minister.\n\n\nAs the search-and-rescue team looked for Stacy in the icy water on Llantano Mountain, they had no luck. The officer in charge called the search off. He advised Rex and Oliver that they had done all they could, and Stacy would not have survived. She was in the water far too long. Rex was upset that the team was giving up, but he calmed himself down knowing that at least the baby's father was with his new daughter at the hospital.\n\n\nOliver needed to file a death certificate and he was anxious to get to the hospital to check on Sierra Rose. Rex wanted time alone and advised Oliver that he couldn't be around people. Oliver agreed to inform Gigi of Stacy's death. After Oliver left, Kim wandered into the area in search of Stacy. She was worried that her best friend was lost, she added. She was confused when she saw the rescue team, and Rex began to explain what had happened.\n\n\nAt first Kim misunderstood and thought that Stacy was at the hospital. Rex finally convinced her that Stacy was gone and that she hadn't made it out of the water. Kim shook her head in denial, and she accused him of giving up the search because of his feelings toward Stacy. Soon after, her anger took over as Rex half-heartedly tried to comfort her. \"How can my girl be gone?\" Kim asked. Rex told her that the baby was at the hospital with her father and Gigi. He then began to press for more information from a grieving Kim.\n\n\nHe wanted her to agree that he was right in stating that Schuyler was the baby's father. As he grew angrier about the ploy that Kim and Stacy had carried on, Kim broke down. She insisted that everything Stacy had done was because Stacy had loved Rex. Kim wanted to take the blame instead. Rex wondered what kind of person Kim was to go along with the plan and wanted to know if she and Stacy had laughed at him. He asked if Stacy had actually mourned his baby that she had miscarried or if she had just moved on quickly to make a new one. He thought that the joke was on him.\n\n\nArriving at the police station, Oliver filed his report and revealed what had occurred on Llantano Mountain to a curious Dorian. Elijah had good news for Charlie and Dorian. As he suspected, the FBI had turned their case over to the Llanview Police Department; Dorian and Charlie were free to go but needed to stay in the jurisdiction. Dorian's first thought was to head to Paris to search for Adriana.\n\n\nElijah didn't want to know about Dorian leaving because he didn't want to see Dorian back in jail. Dorian pointed out that Mitch's followers were everywhere, even though Elijah assured her that the FBI was trying to round them up. He thought that Mitch could be bluffing, but Dorian felt differently. \"He's a psychopath,\" she uttered. She needed to know that Adriana was safe. Dorian successfully booked her flight to Paris. \"I didn't hear that,\" Elijah called out as Charlie bid her farewell. Dorian was confidant that Viki would forgive Charlie.\n\n\nAdriana finally called Dorian and assured her mother that she was safe. She was sorry to cause Dorian worry and she made excuses for both herself and Kelly not taking Dorian's calls. She promised to stay in touch with her mother. Kelly apologized for ruining Adriana's date.\n\n\nDorian called Cassie to give her the good news about Adriana and Kelly. Cassie was happy and was certain that Mitch's followers couldn't be everywhere as Dorian believed. She told Dorian that she was enjoying the special tea that she had received from Addie.\n\n\nOliver left the station for the hospital and hugged Kyle as soon as he saw him. He broke the news about Stacy to Kyle but was unaware that Schuyler overheard. Oliver explained that search-and-rescue had done everything they could. A shocked Schuyler spoke up and advised the men that he needed to tell Gigi. Kyle thought that Oliver could possibly be the only parent that Sierra Rose had.\n\n\nGigi continued to speak to Sierra Rose. She confided that she had broken up with the baby's father, but it was okay. She thought that Schuyler was taking care of the infant like she was his own, but she knew that the baby would love her parents. Schuyler wandered into the room and broke the news about Stacy to Gigi. As she began to lament her sister's death, a doctor approached. He had some bad news about the baby.\n\n\nBrody was thrilled to see Jessica and told her how he had prayed. A speechless Jessica looked on in confusion as Brody was showed his elation to be with the woman he loved. \"Who are you?\" she asked.\n\n\nAs Viki and Clint lingered in the hallway outside of Jessica's room, Charlie stepped off the elevator. He immediately asked Viki about Jessica and she advised him that her daughter would be fine. Charlie sadly explained that he never meant to hurt Jessica, especially after Jared was killed. He wanted to kill Mitch to settle the score, and he wanted everyone to be free of Mitch. He knew he had been wrong, and he would never forgive himself. He would also never stop loving Viki. She turned away and began to cry.\n\n\nAs Rex continued to bully Kim, she blurted out that Schuyler wasn't the father any more than Rex was.\n\n\n",
