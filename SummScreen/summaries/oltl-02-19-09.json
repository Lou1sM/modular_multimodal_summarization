    "soap_central": "\n Do You Want To Tell Them or Should I? \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cole heard the news of Wes and Marty, and took off for the police station. Noelle confided to Markko that she was still working as a waitress because her husband was rich, not her. She added that Moe had been driving her crazy by giving all of his attention to his portfolios. She wondered why Markko was having his mail sent to the diner. Grabbing the envelope, Markko ripped it open and yelled in glee. He was accepted to his first choice college in California. As Jared and Natalie arrived for a meal, they continued to ponder the parking stub from the hospital that Jessica had in her possession from the night of Chloe's birth. \n\n\nNatalie was perplexed as she described a possible scenario from the hospital, based on the times on the parking stub. She found it difficult to believe that Jessica would have been at the hospital for 30 minutes, then headed to the cottage to have her baby. She wondered what Jessica could have been doing there. Jared felt that Jessica was better and that they should be supporting her, instead of delving into what happened in the past. While he agreed that the entire parking stub issue was weird, he suggested other alternatives as to why Jessica was at the hospital for such a short time after planting the bomb. \n\n\nNatalie felt that she couldn't trust Jessica until she resolved the matter. While Jared expressed his happiness for the way things were, Natalie believed that she couldn't let the matter go. Jared hoped she would get the answers she was searching for and be able to drop the incident. He thought Jessica deserved a break. \n\n\nLater, Langston was thrilled to hear that Markko had been accepted to Llanview University. Noelle wondered why he had lied to his girlfriend. He explained that he couldn't leave Llanview and his dream girl, even if it meant forgoing his dream college. Noelle looked on disapprovingly, as Markko assured his girlfriend that he wasn't going anywhere. Langston longed to share the good news with Starr. She wondered if Cole was accepted, too, thinking that he and Markko would be great roommates. \n\n\nUpset over his best friend's death, Brody wondered if he was the one responsible for Wes's murder. He was worried because he couldn't remember his activities from the previous night. Jessica thought that Brody would indeed remember if he had killed Wes, and pointed out that his clothes and hands were clean, and he had not suffered a blackout. Nevertheless, Brody blamed himself since Wes had been in Llanview for him in the first place. He admitted that he couldn't remember the incident on Llantano Mountain with Shane and Rex, either, which further caused him to question his own innocence. \n\n\nJessica felt sure that Brody was merely in shock and that, while he was angry at Wes for his lie regarding the killing of the boy in Iraq, she knew that Brody wouldn't have become violent over it. She felt that Brody was much better since he took up residence at St. Anne's. She again jokingly pointed out his clean fingernails and ordered him to fight against his doubts of himself, just as she did constantly with herself. She confirmed that she knew Brody and trusted him, and that she knew he couldn't have killed Wes. \n\n\nSinging the praises of St. Anne's for getting her stronger, Jessica was also thankful for meeting Brody, who quietly thanked her. She ordered him to stop being polite and get angry. Brody agreed that he was angry at Wes, but he also loved him as a best friend who protected him. Solemnly, Jessica urged Brody to mourn. Before she left, she told Brody to give her a call. \n\n\nLearning of the death of Wes, T\u00e9a thought it best to contact the police first, assuming that they would be looking for Todd after the men fought at the ball. She agreed to bring Todd in for questioning. With Blair's forgotten earring in hand, T\u00e9a was confident that Todd had his alibi. Todd wasn't too sure of that, as he didn't expect Blair to back him. \n\n\nArriving at the police station, John voiced his opinion that Todd should be brought in as the likely suspect. As Marty's attorney entered, Blair expressed her own opinions on Marty's obvious guilt. Cole showed up in support of his mother and conveyed his concern and worry. He didn't want to lose his mother again, he pronounced. Learning that she was merely going to be questioned, the young man insisted on waiting. Marty was happy that Cole was present, as he assured her he'd look out for her. Wondering why his mom was being questioned in the first place, John agreed that she didn't do anything, but Antonio explained that others were being questioned as well, if they had been in the vicinity. \n\n\nCole announced that he would have to be questioned, too, as he had attempted to visit his mom the night of the murder. He never saw her, though, he continued, because he heard Wes talking. He didn't hear specific words, only the voice, he stressed. He made it clear that his mom had been through enough and he wanted her left alone. Todd arrived and agreed with Cole. Talia, Marty, and the attorney stepped into the interrogation room to record Marty's statement. Marty recapped her story, clarifying that Wes was dead when she awoke and she had no clue as to what happened. \n\n\nTalia wanted to pursue the argument the couple had but Marty quickly made it clear that she had too much to drink, not Wes. He was being protective, and she was being stupid, she said. She added that John had shoved Wes at the ball, which caused him to bump into Todd. The knife that Wes carried was something he needed for his bike. Wes was gentle, understood what she had been through, and tried to help her. Their relationship was not physical. Marty was angry at Talia's insinuations of Wes being forceful in any way. John admonished an angry Cole to \"be cool\" when he saw Todd, and convinced the young man to go home. He said he'd let Cole know when Marty was released. \n\n\nAntonio asked an evasive Todd about his evening and was angered at T\u00e9a, who appeared to be covering for Todd once again. A smirking T\u00e9a assured Antonio that there was someone else who would be able to vouch for Todd. As Todd summarized his evening after leaving the ball, a doubtful Antonio found it difficult to believe that Todd went home and to bed. Blair was beside herself, yelling that Marty had killed Wes, not Todd. Still being questioned, Marty ended it all, advising Talia that she had been exhausted and drunk and she had gone to bed. There was nothing else for her to add and she began to cry. \n\n\nThe attorney summarized everything that was said and Talia thanked Marty for being so cooperative. They were finished and Marty was free to go. T\u00e9a, enjoying herself immensely, assured Antonio that Todd had not been alone after the ball. As Blair cringed, T\u00e9a grinned. \"There was someone else with Todd that night, wasn't there Blair? Should I tell them sweetheart, or would you like to?\" she asked. All eyes were on Blair. \n\n\nStarr ran into the science room and apologized for being late, knocking over a beaker in the process. She confided to her teacher how upset she was at not being able to speak to Cole like old times and how he never looked her in the eye like he used to, whenever they did meet. Schuyler empathized with Starr's feelings of loss after such a loving relationship, confiding that he knew exactly how she felt. Starr wanted to know what went wrong in Schuyler's situation and asked if it had anything to do with his drug problem. \n\n\nAn uneasy Schuyler felt it inappropriate to talk about his love life and wanted his privacy respected, though he confirmed that he hadn't been involved with drugs in a very long time. He didn't want Starr to tell anyone what he had told her. He understood, though, that Starr was concerned about her own friend who was doing drugs and was looking for some help and comparisons. She felt that her friend's behavior had altered. Arriving to school late, Cole lost his temper, banging repeatedly on his locker. Making sure the coast was clear, he took another pill.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Blair calls the cops to report a murder, they take Marty to the station. Talia questions her. But she has a lawyer on her side. John and Antonio do not believe she did it and express that Todd had the best motive to kill Wes. But Blair, knowing, unequivocally that he did not, protests that they must know that Marty killed Wes. They ask her how she would know that and she hesitates to admit that she spent the night with Todd until Tea asks her to tell them how she knows that Todd could not have done it. Starr talks privately to Schuyler about how she feels isolated from Cole and has a concern about his drug usage. He reveals to her that he had a similar situation with a relationship not working because of a similar situation. Jessica talks to Brody who admits to her that he's distraught over losing his best friend and believes he might have killed him. She gives him a pep talk to know that he could not have done it. Natalie tells Jared she has to get to the bottom of the mystery of how they found a parking voucher in Jessica's purse that proves she went to the hospital the night Chloe was born. Markko gets accepted to UCLA and does not know how to tell Langston that he is moving far away.",
