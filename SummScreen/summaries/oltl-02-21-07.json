After their game, Viki rants about how Dorian made Lindsay try to distract Viki from her date with Clint so Dorian could take Viki's place. Clint doesn't want to talk about Dorian. Viki feels a pain in her sprained wrist, and brings up Dorian again. Viki is amazed that Clint can continue to take the high road where Dorian is concerned, given how infuriating Dorian can be. She then wonders what Dorian would think if Dorian knew that Viki was spending the night with Clint. Clint asks Viki if she'd like to spend the night. Viki asks Clint if he's serious, which he is. Asa then storms in to tell them that Nora's house burned down. He tells them that Matthew and Nora will be staying at Asa's for a while. Viki thinks that's very nice of Asa, to which he responds that Nora is family. Viki asks how the fire started. Asa tells her that it was arson, but they don't know who the arsonist is. Asa then wonders what exactly he walked in on, thinking that Viki and Clint were on a date. Clint confirms this, which thrills Asa. He says that they belong together and it's about time they realize that. He then leaves Clint and Viki alone and promises not to disturb them anymore. Clint and Viki end their date with a kiss and Clint walks Viki out. \n\n\nAt the Sun, Cristian asks Jessica if it's true that she and Nash came close to having sex. Jess is shocked that Nash would be spilling about that to Layla, while Cris tells her that she should be more worried what Antonio will do when he finds out. Jess begs Cris not to tell Antonio, but Cristian wants to because she was cheating on Antonio. Jessica insists that she didn't go all the way with Nash, while Cris thinks that kissing and nearing sex is enough to be considered cheating. He tells her that it's not going to go away if she just doesn't think about it, and asks her outright if she almost had sex with Nash. She admits that it nearly happened, but they stopped themselves before they went too far and agreed that it will never happen again. Cris thinks Antonio doesn't deserve being lied to, and Jessica agrees, saying she feels incredibly guilty and punishes herself for it every day. She then accuses Cris of acting morally superior, to which he replies that he's trying to be a better person. Jess begs him again not to tell Antonio because it would break Antonio's heart. Cristian tells her that she should have thought of that before this happened. Jess tells him that she just wants time to figure this out. Cris relents and tells her that he doesn't want to hurt her or Antonio, but is still worried about what will happen if Antonio finds out. He agrees to keep quiet for a while, but hopes Jess will do the right thing and tell Antonio. \n\n\nBo tells Antonio and Talia that Matthew only had some minor smoke inhalation and is fine now. Because Matthew was nearly killed in the fire, he wants the arson case to be the top priority. Antonio asks Bo a little more about Matthew and Bo starts to get upset, which Antonio understands and assures Bo that he wants the arsonist caught just as badly as Bo does. They then discuss that they have no new leads on the arson case. Nora's fire fit the M.O. of the arsonist, but it doesn't fit the pattern that had been previously established. Bo, Antonio, and Talia throw some ideas around, including that this fire could be due to a copycat, or to a perp that Nora busted sometime in the past, or to a possible robbery cover up, or to a pyromaniac. Bo tells Antonio and Talia to go out and talk to their snitches and offer a large reward to the first person to give them a name. Bo then goes to his office to talk with Matthew.\n\n\nIn Bo's office, he tells Matthew that Nora is getting some stuff to bring to Asa's. Matthew asks him why they can't stay at Bo's place. Bo tells Matthew that he and Nora discussed that option, but they both think it's best for Matthew and Nora to stay at Asa's mainly to stay away from the media. Matthew wants to know who could do something like this. Bo doesn't have an answer for him, but vows to find the arsonist. While waiting for Nora, Bo asks Matthew if he wants to talk a bit more about the fire. Matthew tries to downplay it and realize that he and Nora are very lucky to be alive. Bo concurs, but also tells Matthew that he has every right to be upset. Matthew can't believe that most of his stuff is gone, especially the videos that Jen made for him. Bo calms him down and tells him that they'll talk to Will, Lindsay, and Rex to get more pictures of Jen for him, because he really wants to fix this for Matthew. Bo tells Matthew that he's glad that Matthew is safe and he wouldn't be able to live if anything had happened to Matthew. Matthew doesn't want Bo to tell Nora that he was being a baby, which Bo scoffs at. He tells him that Matthew is no baby and that he's very proud of Matthew. The fire chief then enters bringing in a rather small box with all the belongings that they could save from the fire. Matthew is shocked by how little was salvageable. Bo and Matthew sift through the remains together, finding a picture of Bo, Nora, and Matthew, some ruined videotapes and photo albums, and a picture of Matthew and Jen. Bo can see that Matthew is getting upset and wants to save the rest for later, but Matthew is determined to continue to save Nora from any sad memories that the box might contain.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Talia is down on herself for hesitating when she had found the arsonist, and worries about what might have happened if Matthew or Nora died. Antonio tells her that she needs to let it go. Talia wants to go to Bo to tell him what happened that night because it's weighing heavily on her mind and it's driving her crazy. \n\n\nJessica then shows up at the police department to see Antonio, who asks her about her interview with Miles. She says it was interesting and asks him about his day. Antonio says it was rough and they'll talk more when they get home. He wants to hear every little detail of her day. \n\n\nAt the diner, Todd is sitting alone looking sadly at the death certificate Rex gave him. Marcie, who was taking Tommy out for a ride to calm him down and get him back to sleep, arrives at the diner and asks Todd if she can sit with him. At first Todd refuses, but after some prodding, he relents and tells Marcie to sit down. She asks Todd to watch Tommy while she goes to the bathroom and he adamantly tells her that he won't. She asks him why he's being so rude, and he shows her the death certificate. Marcie apologizes and tries to sympathize with Todd, but he asks her to leave him alone, which she does. After Marcie leaves, a random boy asks his father why Todd looks so upset. His father tells the boy that he doesn't know but they shouldn't ask Todd either.  \n\n\nWhile Marcie is away, John asks Michael if he knows who killed Spencer. Michael tells him that he'll be sorry when he finds out who is the murderer. John wants to know what that means. Michael refuses to answer any more questions, but John wants Michael to come clean. Michael says that whoever killed Spencer did the world a favor. John agrees, but he still wants to find the person before anyone else does. Mike knows John is only doing this to honor their father's memory, but he says that their father is wrong and John should just let the case go. John wants to know why Michael is so determined not to answer any questions, so Mike spills that he knows who killed Spencer. John demands to know who the murderer is, and Mike hedges a bit, asking John if he really wants to know that badly. He tries to convince John that he should just leave it alone because the killer is most likely someone they know. John asks again who the killer is, and Michael says that he doesn't know specifically. John is getting frustrated by Mike's lack of answers and all the generic theories that he's come up with so far. Mike tells John that if he really loves him, John will let the case go. John tells Michael that the evidence is pointing towards Mike and asks him point blank if he killed Spencer. Michael is shocked that John could think he's capable of murder, and again asks John to let go of the case because pursuing it could ruin the lives of people they care about. John asks one more time what Michael is hiding, but Mike refuses to say anymore. John warns him that he should be safe and that he can't let the case go.\n\n\nMarcie comes back from the diner because Tommy is finally starting to fall asleep. She tells Michael about Todd, and thinks about how she can't imagine what it's like to lose a child. Michael reassures her that that will never happen. Marcie then asks what John wanted, and tells Michael that John won't give up until Spencer's killer is found. \n\n\nAt Capricorn, Layla tells Nash that he needs to stay away from and forget about Jessica. As he's flashing back to how he almost had sex with Jessica, he realizes that he probably can't do that.\n\n\nNash sees Tate at Capricorn and refuses to let him pay for his drinks. Nash tells Tate that he's a big fan, but Tate wonders if Nash has a business proposition for him. Nash asks him if that would be so bad. Tate only thinks that because Nash bought his drink for him, but Nash insists that he's just a fan. He'd also like Tate to sign a ball for Bree. They then chat a little bit about how Tate got into baseball and how Nash got into winemaking. Tate is surprised that there is a vineyard in Pennsylvania. After their little chat, they agree to see each other again.\n\n\nEvangeline then walks into Capricorn and asks Layla if she's seen Cris. Layla tells her that he left a while ago, and didn't say much of anything before he left. As Evangeline flashes back to kissing Todd, Layla asks her what's wrong. Evangeline thinks that Cris is mad at her for taking off to see Todd, and insists that she needed to be there for Todd. Layla thinks it's a good thing that Cris is jealous and that he'll get over it. Evangeline that spills that she and Todd kissed. Layla's shocked at this announcement. Evangeline says that she was caught up in the moment, but they both realized it was a mistake. She vows that it will never happen again. Evangeline wants to tell Cristian about the kiss. Layla thinks her sister has lost her mind because Cris will flip out over this news. Layla give Evangeline three reasons not to tell Cris. He's a man, he hates Todd, and he's Puerto Rican. Layla explains that Latin men tend to be jealous and possessive. Layla tells Evangeline that if she tells Cris that she kissed Todd, he'll freak out. At that moment, Cris returns to Capricorn. \n\n\nLayla tells Cris that Evangeline was worried that Cris was freaked out that Evangeline was gone for so long. Cris tells them that he's tired and just wants to take Evangeline home to talk.\n\n\nJohn heads to Capricorn to get a beer and tries not to think about the fact that Michael may have killed Spencer.\n\n\nMeanwhile, we see the arsonist about to start another fire.\n\n\n",
