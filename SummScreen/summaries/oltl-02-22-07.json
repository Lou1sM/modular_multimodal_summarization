He confuses Nat when he says that Spencer will ruin a whole new generation. She asks if he's referring to Tommy. No, he quickly covers up. It's just that his family has suffered enough. Nat is pretty sure that she can't stop John, even when Michael blurts out that he won't like the ending. John is right, Natalie just enjoys controlling, he says angrily. She is pretty angry in return and notes that she and John are not doing very well and she'll lose him if she pushes on this. He apologizes but is pretty sure that John will be destroyed when he learns the identity of the killer. John already has a suspect in mind, she informs him. He wonders who. She finally consents to speak with John. \n\n\nA visit to Dr. Crosby is called for but John learns that the doc is on a leave of absence. Marty is taking his place and urges him to talk to her in confidence. He grudgingly admits that he thinks he knows Spencer's murderer and it's his own brother. He doesn't really believe it but the little evidence that he has points to Michael. He thinks he did it for him. He feels that after a smart Michael left home on a scholarship, he felt as though he were abandoning John and is making it up to him. Marty notes that John has an exaggerated feeling of responsibility for both his brother and the law. What will he do? Cole pays his mom a visit and refuses her offer to see a movie together; he suggests that she hang out with adults for a change and go to this thing called a club. She reluctantly agrees to go to the concert at Capricorn, provided he behave. Once she leaves, he makes a quick call to Starr, who is babysitting.\n\n\nJess makes a phone call to Cris, again pleading with him to keep quiet regarding her close encounter with Nash. Evangeline listens to Cris rant about Jess and the fact that he's keeping quiet for Antonio, not her. He's so appreciative of Evangeline and her high standards, he continues. Reflecting on her own close encounter with Todd, Evangeline decides she'd better tell him the truth. She kissed Todd, she professes, but it wasn't romantic, he was in pain. She attempts to explain in all honesty but Cris goes ballistic and shouts that they are a lie. He wants no part of it. She can't believe it's all over after one kiss. She cheated on him; she didn't slap him or push him away, he yells. He doesn't believe that she's not attracted to Todd and storms out.\n\n\nMiles visits Jess and Antonio learns of his relation to her. He has a funny feeling about the man, he admits. Miles confesses that he sees his old self when he looks into a mirror, never met his brothers or saw a picture of his own mother. Spencer gave him a new life but he's dead now and therefore Miles is all alone. He didn't ask for Spencer's money. He's ecstatic to know that he now has family and he wants to meet Viki. Antonio agrees that he deserves a chance. He also learns that Miles has never been to a concert or club and will provide him a ticket for the Nelly Furtado concert at Capricorn that night.\n\n\nTodd pays his sister a visit and shows her the death certificate for his son. Viki tries to persuade him to grieve and move on, though Todd is feeling badly about not wanting anything to do with the child when Margaret was pregnant. Reminding him that she was crazy, Viki assures him that he's not alone and is resilient. It's all an act, Todd replies. Jess and Miles arrive and a shocked Viki learns of his identity. Todd is amused. Miles would like to make up for Mitch and never even knew he had family. She reminds Todd that it was his idea for her to meet Miles for the interview in the first place. He thinks Miles' story is fake but Viki is willing to wait and see. \n\n\nEvangeline cries her eyes out; she refuses to answer any of Todd's calls.\n\n\nBlair heads into Capricorn looking for a job as a singer. Nash is reluctant but agrees to have her audition. He's sold and tells her she can start immediately. Cris and Antonio both arrive and a venomous Cris states that he doesn't like Nash and doesn't trust him, as Antonio sticks up for him. He doesn't like guys who move in on other men's women, he continues. Antonio wonders if he means Nash, but Cris states that he's referring to Todd and Evangeline. Blair overhears. Antonio thinks that if Evangeline was honest, then Cris should accept it. What if Jess kissed someone else, he asks. They're interrupted by Nash and the conversation is put on hold. \n\n\nSomeone sets fire to a Nelly Furtado at Capricorn poster.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nash comes out of the back room of Capricorn. He sets the box down on the bar when he sees someone standing there. He informs them that the club isn't open yet. Blair turns around, and tells him that she is there to ask him for a job. Nash lets her know that they do not have any openings. Blair lets him know that she knows that they have no singer, and she would like to audition for the job. This surprises Nash. Jessica calls Cristian, and begs him again not to let Antonio know that her and Nash had just about made love. Cristian promises yet again that he will not let Antonio know, but he isn't doing it for her sake, but for Antonio's. Evangeline walks out of the bedroom, and overhears Cristian talking to Jessica on the phone. Evangeline remembers the kiss that she had shared with Todd. She feels guilty. Natalie meets Michael at the Angel Square Diner. Michael, immediately, asks her to get John to back off the Spencer Truman case. Natalie is confused by Michael's request. John comes to visit Dr. Crosby, but finds out from his secretary that Dr. Crosby had taken a leave of absence. Marty Saybrooke comes out of the office, and asks John if she can help. John hesitates about talking to her about this, but he finally agrees to talk to her. Todd visits Viki at Llanfair, and Viki immediately wants to know about Blair. Todd shows Viki the death certificate of his dead son. Viki shows concern for his grief. Todd talks to Viki about Margaret and the child that she was carrying, and how he had lost two children (counting the one that Blair lost) The phone rings, and Viki takes the call in the study. Todd gets on his cell phone, and calls Evangeline. Once again, he gets no answer. Evangeline braves up, and tells Cristian about the kiss that she had shared with Todd. Cristian blows his top, and tells her that she had cheated on him. He leaves her apartment . Blair auditions at Capricorn for the \"singer\" position. She is given the job. Antonio and Jessica have a visitor from Miles. Antonio is reluctant to trust him, but decides to give it a try for Jessica's sake. They invite Miles to go the nightclub that night to hear a rock star. Miles lets them know that he wants to see Viki to let her know the news before she hears it from someone else. Jessica agrees, and goes to get dressed. This gives Antonio and Miles a chance to talk. Natalie, at first, refuses to help Michael, but then she decides to try to get John to back off this Spencer Truman case. Michael is thrilled. They show the arsonist with a picture of the rock star (who is appearing at Capricorn), in his hand. He flicks a lighter, and burns the picture.",
