John warned Todd that he would regret printing the story, but Todd ignored his threat and accused John of planning to seduce Natalie.  When John inquired why Todd was concerned about John's relationship with Natalie, Todd claimed that he was simply looking out for Marty's best interest.  John informed Todd that Viki would be furious if Todd printed a damaging article about Natalie in the Sun.  After a brief hesitation, Todd agreed not to print the story. \n\n\nOutside of Jessica's hospital room, Clint, Viki, and Brody told Natalie that Mitch had performed electric shock treatment on Jessica.  Natalie was shocked to learn that Jessica had no memories of Natalie, Bree, or Brody.  Relating that she was unsure of the lasting effects of Jessica's condition, Marty asked Jessica's family members to be gentle with Jessica.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside her hospital room, Jessica panicked when a nurse informed her that the year was 2010.\n\n\nAs Jessica tried to process the fact that she had no knowledge of the previous thirteen years, Viki, Clint, Natalie, Brody, and Marty entered the room.  When Natalie referred to Jessica as her twin, a panicked Jessica declared that she didn't have a twin.   Informing Viki that the nurse had given her the correct date, Jessica pleaded with her mother to be honest with her.   Marty suggested that Viki and Clint speak privately with Jessica.  Reminding Viki and Clint that Jessica trusted them, Marty urged them to tell Jessica the truth.\n\n\nAlone with Jessica, Viki and Clint explained that Jessica and Natalie had different fathers.  Consumed with fear, Jessica couldn't believe she had lost memories of thirteen years.   Viki told Jessica that she had experienced a trauma, which had caused her to forget many things.  In tears, Jessica asked, \"Who's Bree?\"   Jessica was terrified to learn that she had a daughter who she didn't remember.\n\n\nBo and Nora arrived at the cottage with Shane and Bree.  While Shane expressed the desire to see his baby sister, Bree stressed that she wanted to see her mother.  Bo agreed to stay at the cottage with Shane while Nora accompanied Bree to the hospital to see Jessica.   Afterward, Shane continued to await news about his little sister.\n\n\nAs they sat outside of Jessica's room, Natalie and Brody wondered if Jessica had suffered permanent memory loss.   Marty stated that if the police recovered the equipment that Mitch had used to perform Jessica's procedure, it might be possible to determine which brain cells had been effected.   Marty encouraged them to remain prayerful.  While they discussed Jessica's condition, Nora arrived at the hospital with Bree.  When Bree asked to see her mother, Natalie told Nora that there was a problem.\n\n\nAs Viki and Clint attempted to calm Jessica's nerves, Marty entered the room and announced that Bree wanted to see her mother.  Hoping that the child would trigger some memories, Jessica agreed to see her daughter.   Before allowing Bree entry, Marty advised Jessica that Bree needed her mother's reassurance -- even if Jessica didn't remember the child.\n\n\nAs Marty, Viki, and Clint looked on, Bree rushed into the room and presented Jessica with a picture she had drawn for her.  Realizing that the little girl was thrilled to be reunited with her, Jessica pretended to remember the child.  Everyone had high hopes when Jessica told Bree that she would be home soon and asked the child to wear her pretty flowered dress at her homecoming.  Once Bree had left the room, a teary-eyed Jessica displayed the photo that Viki had given her of Bree dressed in the flowered dress, and stated that she didn't remember the child.\n\n\nLater, Jessica confided in her parents that she was afraid.\n\n\nAfterward, Marty informed Natalie and Brody that Jessica had covered for Bree's sake, but didn't remember her daughter.  Brody told Natalie that he couldn't bear to watch Jessica suffer.   When Natalie insisted that there wasn't anything they could do about it, Brody declared, \"Yes, there is!\"\n\n\nIn the hospital corridor, as Rex, Oliver, and Kyle watched, Gigi was speechless when Schuyler announced that he, not Rex, was Sierra's father.   Gigi stared in disbelief as Rex explained that he had recently learned that he hadn't fathered Stacy's child.   As Schuyler signed the consent form, Gigi asked for a moment alone with Sierra before the baby was prepped for surgery.  After Schuyler thanked Oliver for his help, Oliver ran off, with Kyle following close behind.\n\n\nAlone with Schuyler, Rex berated him for using Sierra to destroy Rex's life.  Insisting that his only concern was Sierra, Schuyler refused to argue with Rex.   After receiving a call from Bo and Shane, Rex promised to return to the cabin and update Shane on his baby sister's progress.   Afterward, Rex informed Gigi that Shane was concerned about Sierra.  Rex advised Gigi that Shane needed honest answers, and Gigi agreed.  She promised to return home after Sierra's surgery.    Moments later, Gigi sat in the corner and wept.\n\n\nWhen Rex arrived at the cottage, Shane inquired about Sierra and offered his condolences for Stacy.  After relating that Sierra was undergoing heart surgery, Rex told Shane that he didn't have a baby sister after all.  Explaining that Stacy had lied about him being the father of her baby, Rex told his son that Schuyler was actually Sierra's father.  Rex reminded Shane that although he didn't have a baby sister, he did have a baby cousin.  Rex encouraged his son to show Sierra as much love as possible, and Shane agreed.\n\n\nAfter sending Shane upstairs to unpack, Rex gave Bo a detailed account of Stacy's drowning and the revelation that Rex wasn't Sierra's father.   Rex admitted that he was worried about the child's health and Gigi's emotional state.  While Bo offered his support, Rex was disgusted by the fact that Schuyler had used Sierra to seduce Gigi.\n\n\nOnce Bo had left, Shane wondered when his mother would return home.  Rex stated that Gigi would remain at the hospital until Sierra was out of danger.  Citing that there wasn't a baby to keep Rex and Gigi apart, Shane begged his father to reunite with his mother.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Gigi lashed out at Schuyler and accused him of being romantically involved with Stacy.   Detailing how Stacy had miscarried Rex's baby, Schuyler recounted how Stacy had drugged and seduced him.  Insisting that he didn't remember the incident, Schuyler told Gigi that he had attempted to tell her the truth several times.  Gigi's heart dropped when Schuyler admitted that he had known that he had fathered Stacy's baby for the previous three months.  Outraged by Schuyler's admission, Gigi pointed out that Schuyler knew the truth at the time she had left Rex and confessed her love for Schuyler.\n\n\nSchuyler insisted that he had kept silent because he thought Gigi would leave him.  Schuyler pleaded, \"The day you told me that you loved me was the greatest day of my life! We love each other so the truth doesn't have to change anything!\"  In a disgusted tone, Gigi replied, \"Schuyler, it changes everything!\"\n\n\nWhen Kyle and Oliver arrived at Kyle's apartment, Kyle noticed that Oliver was visibly upset.  Pointing out how Oliver had rushed out of the hospital when Schuyler claimed to be Sierra's father, Kyle questioned why Oliver hadn't mentioned the child since they had left the hospital.  Oliver insisted that Schuyler was the child's father, but Kyle continued to remind Oliver that Sierra might possibly be Oliver's child.    Kyle pleaded with Oliver to allow him to perform a DNA test, but Oliver refused.\n\n\nInsisting that Sierra had suffered enough, Oliver remarked that Sierra should be raised by normal parents.  Oliver was adamant that Gigi and Schuyler would make excellent parents for the child.   Reminding Oliver of the scene they had witnessed at the hospital, Kyle doubted that Gigi and Schuyler would remain a couple.  Frustrated by Oliver's statement, Kyle informed Oliver that Oliver was an honorable man who had a loving partner.  Kyle was convinced that Oliver would make a terrific father.  Kyle questioned whether Oliver doubted he would be a good father because he was gay.  Deflecting Kyle's question, Oliver begged, \"If you love me, you'll drop it!\"\n\n\nMoments later, when an aggravated Oliver rushed out of the room, Kyle spotted a water bottle that Oliver had left behind.   Kyle retrieved the bottle and placed it inside a plastic bag.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gigi finds out for the first time, the startling news that Rex is not the father of Stacy's baby. Schuyler is. Hearing that, she assumes the only way that could happen is for Schuyler to have slept with Stacy. He protests that he did not. She was initially pregnant by Rex but then miscarried and told nobody. And shortly thereafter, she had to find a way to hold onto Rex and make him think that she was still pregnant with his child. So she went to drastic measures to drug him. But when Gigi finds out that Schuyler has known that he's the father of Stacy's baby since before she and Rex broke up and before she started seeing him, she feels betrayed and cannot accept that. Jessica only remembers her life up until her senior year in high school. She has no recollection of finding out that Natalie is her sister, nor of having Bree, nor meeting Brody.",
