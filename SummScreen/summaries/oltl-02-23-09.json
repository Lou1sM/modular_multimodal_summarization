When the Buchanans told her that David and Dorian had tossed them out of the mansion, Viki offered her family refuge. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, David and Dorian joked about claiming the Buchanan fortune. While they made plans to redecorate the mansion, the doorbell rang. When David answered the door, Addie greeted him, and threw a pie in his face. \n\n\nDeclaring that she had come to save their souls, Addie chastised Dorian and David about kicking the Buchanans out of their home. When the couple continued to defend their actions, Addie reminded David of the vow of poverty he took as a Buddhist. Ignoring Dorian's protest, Addie told David that he still had the opportunity to change his mind. Fed up with Addie's pleas, Dorian threatened that she wouldn't allow Addie to move into her new home if she continued to argue her point. Citing the tragedies that occurred when Dorian took over Buchanan Enterprises the first time, Addie feared what disaster could possibly occur the second time around. \n\n\nJessica sat in the library and prepared to read Chloe a story. When she opened the book and read the dedication that Natalie had written to the child, Jessica was saddened. In her inscription, Natalie expressed her pleasure of being a part of the little girl's life, and promised to always care for her. \n\n\nJessica joined her family in the study and was surprised to learn that David was a Buchanan. Vowing to make Dorian pay, Clint assured his family that he and Bo had options concerning David and Dorian. \n\n\nJessica pulled Nora to the side and inquired about Wes Granger's murder. Jessica was stunned to learn that Marty had been arrested for the crime. Jessica blamed Tess for Marty's troubles, but Nora assured her that it wasn't Jessica's fault and blamed Todd. Before walking away, Nora asked Jessica to let her know if Jessica ever discovered who had actually killed Wes. \n\n\nJessica placed a call to Brody, but he was unavailable. Viki overheard Jessica attempt to reach Brody and wondered what was going on. Jessica changed the subject and questioned her mother about Marty. Sensing that something was troubling her daughter, Viki assured Jessica that she didn't need to prove anything to her. With a look of sadness, Jessica declared that she needed to prove some things to herself - and to others. \n\n\nAt the parking garage of Llanview Hospital, Jared urged Natalie to reconsider checking on Tess's whereabouts the night that Chloe was born. Determined to learn the truth, Natalie insisted on discovering what actually happened the night of Chloe's birth. As Jared tried to reason with Natalie, Bo interrupted their discussion. When Bo asked what the heated conversation was about, Natalie lied and claimed they were discussing details about their upcoming nuptials. Bo informed them of David and Dorian's takeover, and revealed that he planned to have another DNA test administered. \n\n\nAfter Bo left, Natalie approached the garage attendant and asked for his assistance in determining the exact time and date that Jessica's parking ticket was used. The attendant obliged and presented her with the necessary information. Observing the startled look on Natalie's face, Jared wondered what information she had uncovered. A shocked Natalie stared at the paperwork and proclaimed, \"This doesn't make sense!\" \n\n\nNatalie and Jared retreated to the caf\u00e9 to go over the evidence. At the caf\u00e9, they realized that Tess had been at the hospital just a short time before Viki and Clint had discovered her at the cottage with her newborn. They determined that Tess had arrived at the hospital after Chloe's birth. Stating that she needed to discuss the revelation with Viki, Natalie insisted that she and Jared head home. \n\n\nBo later returned to the garage and told the attendant that he had misplaced his parking pass. After gaining entry, Bo ran off in a hurry. \n\n\nBo arrived at Llanfair. He instructed his family to pack their bags and proclaimed that they were going to the Buchanan mansion to confront David and Dorian. Bo announced that he had received the DNA results and that the Vickerses were in for the surprise of their lives. \n\n\nJared and Natalie returned home. With a blank stare, Natalie observed Jessica holding Chloe. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Langston and Markko were alarmed to learn that Lola had chosen to confide in T\u00e9a. Citing that she had a history of working with criminals, they questioned her motives. When they asked if Lola believed that she could trust T\u00e9a, Lola stated that she could, because T\u00e9a had trusted her enough to reveal the truth about Ray. \n\n\nUnable to reach Cris, T\u00e9a phoned Antonio and left him a message. She begged him to return her call because she needed to locate Cris immediately. T\u00e9a entered the caf\u00e9 and asked Lola if she had seen Cris. Realizing that T\u00e9a was distracted, Lola wondered if something had happened. The teens were alarmed when T\u00e9a informed them that Ray had escaped from prison. Admitting that she had become preoccupied with her defense of Todd, T\u00e9a feared that Ray believed that she had abandoned him. T\u00e9a claimed that she needed to fix things before it was too late. Lola insisted on accompanying T\u00e9a back to the loft. \n\n\nAt the loft, Cris lay unconscious downstairs with blood dripping from his head. \n\n\nUpstairs, Vanessa was frightened when Ray entered the bedroom brandishing a knife. In a rage, Ray accused Vanessa of brainwashing his daughter and allowing him to rot in prison. Terrified, Vanessa asked Ray what he wanted with her. Ray said that he had broken out of prison just to see her. When Vanessa asked what Ray had done to Cris and proclaimed her love for her husband, Ray's anger intensified. As Cris began to regain consciousness, Ray threatened to cut Vanessa the same way he had supposedly killed his first wife. \n\n\nVanessa told Ray that he would appear guilty of the deceased Mrs. Montez's murder if he were discovered in Vanessa's bedroom with a knife. Ray claimed that he only wanted to see justice served for the murder of his former wife. While Ray continued to accuse Vanessa of murder, Cris appeared in the doorway. Holding the knife, Ray informed Cris that he was leaving with Vanessa. Vanessa watched in horror as the two men struggled over the knife and tumbled down the stairs. \n\n\nAs Ray gained control of the knife and threatened Cris, Vanessa rushed downstairs and T\u00e9a and Lola entered the loft. Lola begged her father to put down the weapon. Ray smiled at his daughter and said that he was glad to see her. He refused to put down the knife and stated that no one would ever take his daughter away - including his lawyer. A confused Cris questioned what was going on. T\u00e9a admitted to being Ray's lawyer and said that she had been fighting to free him for over a year. \n\n\nCris was outraged to learn that T\u00e9a had encouraged him to marry Vanessa, while acting as Ray's lawyer. T\u00e9a promised to explain, but was more concerned with calming down Ray. Stating that he no longer trusted T\u00e9a, Ray refused to allow Vanessa to win. In tears, Lola said that she believed him and realized that Vanessa had actually murdered her mother. Vanessa was speechless. \n\n\nT\u00e9a told Ray that Lola intended to recant her testimony and that he would be a free man. In disbelief, Cris demanded to know if Vanessa had lied to him. Ray remarked, \"You married the devil!\" Cris listened as T\u00e9a lashed out at Vanessa. She accused Vanessa of murdering Lola's mother and framing Ray. Citing that Vanessa only wanted Ray's money, T\u00e9a criticized her for using Lola in the process. Vanessa maintained her innocence, but T\u00e9a continued to rehash the details of the woman's crimes. In a fit of anger, Cris grabbed her and demanded, \"Tell me the truth!\" A frightened Vanessa responded, \"Ok, I did it!\" \n\n\nDorian phoned Langston and told her that they had a new home. Langston divulged that Ray had escaped from prison. Upon learning the news, Dorian ordered her home at once. After hanging up with Dorian, Langston wondered if Ray was innocent. After closing the caf\u00e9, Langston told Markko how proud she was of him gaining admission to Llanview University. Langston noticed a letter fall from Markko's pocket. Realizing that the letter was from UCLA, she asked, \"What is this about?\" \n\n\nDorian pleaded with Addie to move into the mansion. Addie remembered the time she spent at the mansion as Asa's mother-in-law. She said that Asa was a hateful man and that she didn't want to live in his home. Walking towards the door, Addie wished Dorian luck in finding someone who would be willing to live in Asa's miserable home. She warned Dorian that the same evil that lived in Asa's heart was probably in David's, as well. As Addie opened the door to leave, Clint, Bo, Nora, and Nigel stood on the doorstep with their luggage. Dorian demanded to know why they were there. With a devilish smile, Clint stated that David wasn't Asa's son.\n\n\n",
