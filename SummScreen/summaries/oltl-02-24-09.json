Markko downplayed the opportunity as he busied himself with closing up the caf\u00e9. Langston didn't understand Markko's lack of enthusiasm. She also wondered why Markko had not mentioned that he had applied to the prestigious university. Markko explained that his teacher had initiated the process; Markko didn't think the application would be accepted. Langston suddenly realized that the other reason Markko had kept quiet was because the school was far from Llanview. \n\n\nMarkko admitted that the distance posed a problem. He refused to consider moving to California if it meant he had to leave Langston behind. Langston reminded Markko that attending UCLA was an opportunity of a lifetime for someone who wanted to pursue a career in the film industry. Markko pointed out that, despite the career advantages, he didn't have the money to pay for tuition to a school like UCLA. Markko insisted that he had no intention of accepting the offer. To emphasize his point, Markko took the acceptance letter from Langston, crumpled it up, and tossed it away. \n\n\nAt the apartment, Vanessa made a full confession to Cris. She admitted that she had seen Ray's picture in the newspaper a year after his wife had been murdered. When she discovered that he was a wealthy man, Vanessa decided to seduce Ray. Her intention had been to frame him for his wife's murder so that she could have unfettered access to his fortune after he was sent to jail. Cris was disgusted that she had sent an innocent man to prison. Vanessa insisted that Ray had not been innocent; she claimed that Ray had killed his wife. \n\n\nT\u00e9a, Lola, and Ray stood nearby taking it all in. Each felt vindicated, as Vanessa's lies unraveled. Cris remained focused on Vanessa. He demanded to know the whole truth from Vanessa, including how she had obtained Ray's fingerprints on the murder weapon. Tearfully, Vanessa told him that she had found the knife in the tool shed. One night, after Ray drank himself into a stupor, Vanessa slipped the knife into his grip, then planted it for Lola to find. \n\n\nLola was furious because Vanessa had callously used her to destroy Ray. Vanessa continued to insist that Ray was guilty of the murder. Her proof was her intuition. It was not enough to convince Cris of Ray's guilt. When he accused Vanessa of using him, Vanessa cried that she had grown to love him with time. Cris was horrified when Vanessa revealed that seducing men had been a way of life for her before she had met Cris. \n\n\nCris had heard enough. He called Antonio as Vanessa begged Cris to let her walk away. Her cries for compassion fell on deaf ears. When the police arrived, Ray was arrested for escaping jail while Vanessa was handcuffed and carted away. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica reached out to Natalie when she asked her sister to help with a fussy Chloe. Natalie snapped at Jessica. She asked if Jessica was afraid that she would steal Chloe. Jared tried to diffuse the situation, but it wasn't necessary. Jessica told Natalie that she trusted Natalie completely with Chloe. After Jessica left the living room for a moment, Jared and Natalie talked about Natalie's determination to discover why Tess had gone to the hospital after Chloe's birth. Natalie made it clear that she would not back down from her quest. When Jessica rejoined Natalie and Jared, she heard the tail end of their conversation. \n\n\nJessica assumed that they wanted to talk about what Tess had done. Jessica once again apologized for what she had put Natalie and Jared through. Jessica went on to assure them that she would never hurt her daughters. When Jessica admitted that she wanted her sister back, Natalie softened. Natalie confessed that she wasn't ready to forgive and forget, but she hoped to get there eventually. \n\n\nNatalie then asked Jessica about the night Chloe was born. Jessica willingly answered Natalie's questions. Unfortunately, Jessica only recalled feeling as if something had been wrong with Chloe. Before Natalie could probe further about Jessica's uneasy feeling, Jared cut her off. Jessica let the matter drop, then left the room with Chloe. When they were alone, Natalie asked Jared why he had stopped her. Jared said that he was worried that they could inadvertently push Jessica too far by forcing her to remember things she wasn't ready to deal with. Natalie understood and agreed with Jared's reasoning. \n\n\nWhen Jared admitted that he didn't think they could find out why Tess had gone to the hospital following Chloe's birth, Natalie disagreed. She said that she knew of a way to find out what had happened, but she did not elaborate beyond that. \n\n\nDavid and Dorian were stunned when Bo told them that DNA tests confirmed that David was not a Buchanan. Dorian refused to believe Bo; she accused him of falsifying the tests. Bo informed Dorian that the tests were accurate and had been verified twice. Dorian pointed out that not only did they have the original test which disputed the results of Bo's new tests, but also Asa had acknowledged David as his son in the will. \n\n\nBo suggested that the sample Jared had used had been compromised in some way, and that Asa had been misinformed. Dorian decided to contact the lab so that she could order a fourth DNA test. While they waited for a technician to arrive, Dorian, David, and the Buchanans adjourned to the living room. They spent their time trading barbs and hostile glances until Kyle Lewis, the lab technician, was shown in. \n\n\nKyle confirmed Bo's results, but he had a surprise for David. Kyle ran the DNA sample through the police department's database to see if it matched anyone on file. Nigel dashed off to fetch celebratory champagne while Kyle dropped a bombshell. David's father was Rex Balsom! \n\n\nNora, Clint, Bo, Dorian, and David were shocked. When David recovered, he pointed out that Rex was much younger than he was. It was impossible for Rex to be David's father. Kyle explained that the results only showed a father/son match, not who the father was. Since Rex was younger, Kyle said that the results meant that David Vickers was Rex Balsom's father. \n\n\nDorian was outraged. She demanded another test. Meanwhile, Bo decided to call Rex. When Nigel walked in, carrying a tray of champagne, his smile slipped when he noticed all the somber expressions. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi sat down at Marcie's table while Michael stepped away for a moment. Marcie beamed as she hinted that she and Michael had marital relations the night before. Gigi was happy for her friend. Her good mood turned sour when Stacy, Rex, and Shane walked into the bar. The trio was singing and carrying on after the hockey game. Gigi tried to hide her irritation, but Rex picked up on it. \n\n\nAfter Gigi greeted her family, she returned to work. Rex followed Gigi to the bar. He told her that they would have had more fun if Gigi had been with them. Gigi's mood lightened considerably when Rex presented her with a souvenir from the game, a stuffed bear, which he claimed he had bought during the game's halftime. \n\n\nWhen Shane suffered a mild asthma attack, Gigi went into mommy-mode. Stacy was forced to stand on the sidelines as Gigi took care of her son. Later, Gigi asked Michael about Shane's asthma. Michael told her that it was treatable, then assured her that Rex and Gigi had the problem under control. \n\n\nRex received a call from Bo. Before Rex left, he promised Gigi that he would return as soon as his meeting with Bo was over. Holding the stuffed bear that Rex had given her, Gigi watched Rex leave. Stacy waited until Rex was gone before she approached Gigi. When she spotted the bear, Stacy commented that the bears had been given away at the gate to the first 500 people who had entered the game. \n\n\nLater, Gigi confided to Marcie that her relationship with Stacy was a bit strained. Gigi explained that since the time when they were little girls, Stacy had always wanted what Gigi had. \n\n\nWhen Shane overheard Stacy mention that she was searching for an apartment, he invited his aunt to stay with them. Gigi said nothing, but her expression was tense. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Rex learned that David Vickers was his father. At first he thought Bo was jesting, but when Bo offered to order another test, Rex realized they were serious. David tried to talk to Rex, but Rex left without saying a word. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Dorian decided that she and David were going to stay at the Buchanan mansion until everything was straightened out. Nora suggested that they all fasten their seatbelts; they were in for a bumpy night. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rex walked in with a shell-shocked expression. When Gigi asked him what had happened, Rex told her that she wasn't the only person who had been reunited with a family member. \n\n\nThis episode was dedicated in loving memory to Clint Ritchie: 1938 - 2009.

    "tvmega_recap": "Bo tells Dorian and David that he's found DNA proof that David is not Asa's son. So that means that David and Dorian have no claim to their family's fortune. A DNA technician comes to the house and informs him that he's ruled out the possibility that David is Asa's son. But he found a DNA father and son match between David and Rex Balsam. They then conclude that means that Rex is David's son. Bo calls Rex to inform him and it blows Rex's mind. Yet there's no legal action anybody can take about whether or not David and Dorian inherit Asa's estate. Gigi reveals to Marcie that she is not comfortable with her sister back in town getting so chummy to Shane and to Rex. Natalie is determined to get to the bottom of the mystery of how it is that Tess drove to the hospital shortly after giving birth to Chloe. Yet, nobody has an answer for that. Markko tells Langston that even if he's been accept to UCLA, he is going to stay right in Llanview with her because he is in love with her. After Cristian hears Vanessa admit that she framed Ray for the murder of Lola's mother, took her from her father and used him the same way, he calls Antonio and Talia to take her away. Ray goes with her. But she pleads with Cristian that he is the love of her life and begs his forgiveness.",
