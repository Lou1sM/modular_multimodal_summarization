    "soap_central": "\nDo the Dogg\n\n\nCruising into Llanview in his pimped-out limousine, rap superstar Snoop Dogg pondered his return to his hometown.  \"This town has always had some fine sceneries,\" he mused aloud. \"Blonde, brunette, light, dark, and mocha!  Well, look out, ladies of Llanview: the boss is back!\"  Snoop noted that Blair was a foxy lady and he couldn't wait for his gig at Capricorn, but first he had to see an old friend.  \"Llanview, what it do?\"\n\n\nLangston returned home to the apartment she shared with her friends, and fumbled with her keys.  As she searched for the apartment key, her hand found Ford's office key instead, and she flashed back to her intimate encounter with the handsome teacher during the blizzard.  Suddenly, Markko's intimate caress interrupted her fantasy. Markko was delighted to have found some free time with his girlfriend again, but Langston upset him by shrugging him off.  Langston said she was overworked and distracted, but Markko suspected Langston's distance was more than that, and asked if she was deliberately pulling away from him.\n\n\nLangston told Markko she didn't mean to be distant, and blamed her writer's block over the high school musical.  Markko was understanding, but even as he gushed about spending time with his lady love, all Langston could think about was Ford.  Breaking from her reverie, Langston apologized for being unfocused; she claimed she'd been \"obsessed\" with the musical, and said all she wanted to do was go to Capricorn, put her obsession out of her mind and find a way to be close to Markko again.\n\n\nInside the apartment, Starr dazzled Cole with her outfit for Snoop Dogg's concert at Capricorn.  Cole was amused to hear that Danielle had helped Starr pick it out, and wondered what would become of Danielle since T\u00e9a had forced the girl to move back in with her at the Palace Hotel.  Starr said she liked having more space, but admitted she missed having Danielle around everyday.\n\n\nBefore they could leave for Capricorn, Starr took a call from Hope's babysitter: she wouldn't be available, as she too was going to Capricorn.  Starr was disappointed to think that she and Cole would lose their only night out together in weeks, but Cole suggested she look on the bright side, as they were alone in the apartment at last.\n\n\nJust as Cole pulled Starr in for a kiss, Langston and Markko arrived to interrupt the intimate moment.  Deflated, Cole gave their friends the bad news about the sitter.  Langston immediately offered to babysit, which stunned Markko.  Langston claimed she needed peace and quiet to work on the musical, and urged the others, including Markko, to go to the concert without her. Grudgingly, they agreed.\n\n\nMatthew returned to Bo's garret apartment to find Bo and Nora awaiting him with a heaping pile of donuts.  Matthew was thrilled to see his parents had returned from Texas.  Bo told him that with Mitch Laurence in jail and everyone safe, their lives could finally get back to normal.  Nora asked Matthew what they'd missed in his life while they were away, and Matthew hedged and told her there wasn't much to say.\n\n\nNora's eagle eye told a different story, however; she spotted a smudge of Danielle's lipstick on Matthew's cheek, and quizzed him about it.  Nervous, Matthew lamely explained that he and Danielle had shared a \"platonic hug\" and that there was no more to it, then ran to his room to do homework.\n\n\nBo was amused by Matthew's nerves, but Nora found the idea of their son \"fraternizing with the spawn of Satan\" to be no laughing matter.  Bo told her he'd known about the kids' relationship, but didn't find it to be a big deal.  Nora said that Danielle was a sweet girl, but she wasn't sure letting Matthew into close proximity with anything Todd Manning was a good idea.  Bo reassured her that he wouldn't let anything happen to Matthew, but Nora remembered well what Todd had done to Cole when he'd found the boy in bed with Starr.  Bo believed that Matthew and Danielle's teenage flirtation would fizzle out, and told Nora to relax.\n\n\nAs Nora attempted to de-stress, Bo answered a knock at the door and found none other than Snoop Dogg - or, as Bo called him, \"Calvin Broadus\" - on his doorstep.  \"Bo Buchanan, we meet again,\" Snoop marveled.  Bo and Snoop shared a hug, and Snoop explained he was back in town for a concert at Capricorn.  Bo began to introduce Nora to Snoop, but Snoop kissed her hand and told the flustered lady lawyer that Bo's \"baby mama\" needed no introduction; he was glad to see that Asa had finally gotten his wish for the long-lost lovers to reunite.  \"Is there anyone Asa didn't tell?\" Nora mumbled.\n\n\nSnoop asked Bo and Nora how they'd found their way back together, and surprised them with his knowledge of her marriage to Clint.  Before Snoop could explain how he knew so much, Matthew returned to the living room and promptly stopped dead in his tracks at the sight of the hip-hop legend.  \"You're...\" Matthew began.  \"Fo'shizzle!\" Snoop replied.  He greeted \"Kid Buchanan\" and said it was a pleasure to meet him.\n\n\nSnoop explained to the family that he'd heard all about their reunification thanks to \"Shauny-Shaun\" Evans, his former security man.  He invited Bo, Nora, and Matthew to Capricorn to see the show, but Nora was hesitant as it was a school night.  \"Is Lil' B gettin' Fs?\" Snoop asked. \"Then don't say no, No-ra!\"  Nora relented and agreed; they would all go to Capricorn for a night out with Snoop and his crew.\n\n\nBefore the show, Snoop, Bo, and Matthew shared a pizza.  Having heard from Shaun about Matthew's romantic entanglements with Destiny and Danielle, Snoop called the teen \"a playa from the Himalayas.\"  Snoop warned Matthew to always \"keep it real\" with the ladies and let them know how he felt, in order to avoid any future misunderstandings like the one he'd had with Destiny.  Matthew told Snoop that he and Destiny were still friends, and his love life was in perfect working order.  He asked Snoop if he could take his new friend to the concert at Capricorn.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd was shouting orders into his phone at his private investigators, determined to keep an eye on Danielle.  Blair interrupted Todd's outburst by entering his room with her bags packed; she was ready to move back to La Boulaie, but was still missing one crucial piece of luggage: Jack.  Blair asked Todd where Jack was, but Todd had no idea.  After they checked the boy's room, Blair feared the worst, and suspected Mitch, but Todd, still distracted by Danielle, wasn't concerned.  When Blair called him on his casual attitude, Todd screamed at her that Starr had always gone missing as a child and it hadn't been a big deal, so he saw no need to worry about Jack.\n\n\nOver at the Palace Hotel, Danielle walked into T\u00e9a's bedroom to find T\u00e9a storing the empty bottle of oxytocin in her wall safe.  Danielle asked T\u00e9a about it, and T\u00e9a said it was an exhibit in a case and was confidential.  Danielle sneered at T\u00e9a's love of secrets, and needled her mother about how long she'd kept the truth about Todd from the people she loved.  T\u00e9a asked Danielle if the girl was going to hold T\u00e9a's deception against her forever.  \"Probably,\" Danielle replied.\n\n\nDanielle answered a knock at the door; she was expecting Matthew, but instead she found Jack.  \"Who the hell are you?\" Jack asked.  Danielle recognized Jack from Starr's pictures, and was instantly dismayed to have a rude little brother, who reminded her all too much of Todd, on the premises.  She explained that she was his sister, but Jack couldn't quite believe it. \"Who were you expecting,\" she snapped, \"Taylor Swift?\"\n\n\nJack told Danielle he'd overheard his parents talking about her, but given the timeline of events, he'd expected a little girl, perhaps eight or nine years old.  To have another older sister seemed somehow bizarre. \"This makes no sense!\" he said.  \"Get over it,\" Danielle shot back, and told him that she wasn't thrilled at having a \"mini-Todd\" for a bratty younger sibling, either.\n\n\nBefore the kids could start tearing each other apart, T\u00e9a entered the living room and asked Jack if Todd knew he was there.  Jack explained that he was alone, and mangled a turn of phrase by declaring that he was \"going commando\" as opposed to \"going solo.\"  He reasoned that if Todd hadn't told him about Danielle, who Jack called \"the soulless princess of adolescent fury,\" Jack didn't need to tell his dad about his comings and goings.  As Danielle and Jack argued over his improper use of slang, T\u00e9a called Todd.\n\n\nStill angry, Todd received T\u00e9a's call in ill humor and asked her if she'd forgotten that they'd broken up yet again.  T\u00e9a explained that Jack was with her, and asked why Todd hadn't told Jack about Danielle before.  Hanging up, Todd gave Blair the news.  Blair had the same question as T\u00e9a, but Todd said it no longer mattered if Danielle knew Jack; she hated Todd, and they wouldn't be a family.  Todd and Blair left to head for the Palace, and were still bickering about their family's future.\n\n\nAfter Todd hung up, T\u00e9a interceded to break up the argument between Jack and Danielle.  She told them it wasn't their fault, or Todd's, that they hadn't known each other before; it was only hers, and at least they could be unified by their disdain for their parents.\n\n\nTodd and Blair arrived to retrieve Jack. T\u00e9a was none too pleased to see her rival and instantly assumed that Todd had taken back up with Blair on the rebound.  Blair told T\u00e9a she was only there for her son.  Jack and Danielle were miserable to see their mothers bickering once more.\n\n\nDanielle got a call from Matthew inviting her to Capricorn.  \"I'd go see Kenny G. if it'd get me out of here!\" she exulted, and immediately hung up and asked T\u00e9a's permission.  Todd stepped in, however, and told Danielle he forbade her from spending time with Matthew Buchanan.\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd that she would accompany Danielle to Capricorn and chaperone, but Danielle was appalled by Todd's presumption.  She asked him what he expected Matthew to do to her; get drunk with his frat buddies and then do \"Todd knows what?\"  Todd claimed he wanted to protect her, but Danielle saw through him: \"You're trying to control me, and you can't even control yourself.\"  She told him she was tired of kids at school mocking her for having him as a parent, and insisted she would go to Capricorn whether he liked it or not.\n\n\nTodd announced that if T\u00e9a and Danielle were going to Capricorn for the concert, then he was going also. He said he'd meet them there.  Jack counted himself in, as well, and continued bickering with his parents as they headed out into the hallway and onto the elevator.  Jack told Blair and Todd they owed him a night on the town for not telling him about Danielle.  Unable to argue with the boy's logic, Todd and Blair stayed silent.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Ford pitched in to help Cristian prepare the club for Snoop Dogg's concert.  Cris lamented that Layla was ill and unable to attend, but suggested Ford ask his new girlfriend along.  Ford insisted that the lady in question was not his girlfriend, but Cristian sensed a rat, and asked his roommate why he was hiding the girl. He asked if she had another guy. Ford said it wasn't like that, and explained that his new love was a private person who chose to move slowly.  Cristian asked if she was just a girl who'd left Ford her scarf, and Ford smirked that she'd return to him for it, and more, soon.\n\n\nAs the club began to fill up, Cristian asked Ford to take over door duty, and reminded him that Starr, Cole, Langston, and Markko were Blair's guests for the evening.  When the kids arrived, Ford played a mean trick by asking for tickets, then finally let them inside.  Ford asked about Langston, and Starr told him that she'd stayed home to work on the musical.\n\n\nHatching a scheme, Ford approached Cristian and claimed he was feeling sick.  Cristian told him to head home and feel better.\n\n\nGreg and Rachel arrived at Capricorn, ready for a night out with Snoop Dogg.  They resolved to avoid an argument and not talk about Schuyler's case, but the topic seemed forced on them when Greg got a call from the hospital regarding Sierra Rose's heart operation.  After hanging up, Greg told Rachel about Sierra's heart defect, and warned her that if Schuyler had forced premature labor, he could be responsible for Sierra being in jeopardy.  Remembering her conversation with T\u00e9a about the oxytocin, Rachel reminded Greg that he had no proof against Schuyler, only circumstantial evidence and one nurse's word.  Growing upset, she ordered him not to convict an \"innocent man\" without proof.\n\n\nAs Destiny walked over, Greg and Rachel broke away from their heated conversation.  Destiny showed off her slimmer figure and her new dress; she was decked out for clubbing and ready to meet Snoop.  Greg was impressed with his little sister's spunk, as well as her commitment to moving on from Matthew.  As Greg headed for the bar, Rachel told Destiny she was sorry things hadn't worked out with Matthew, but Destiny said she and Matthew were still friends, and she found that she liked Danielle as well.  When she asked Rachel about the tension between Rachel and Greg, however, Rachel was at a loss for words.\n\n\nAt the bar, Greg turned around to find Dr. Vivian Wright, his colleague from the hospital and ex-lover, standing beside him.  Vivian congratulated Greg on his hard work during the snowstorm, and asked if he was alone at the club.  Greg mistook her question for an advance, and was floored when he saw Shaun approach Vivian and take her in his arms for a passionate kiss.\n\n\nShaking off his surprise, Greg awkwardly re-introduced Rachel to Vivian, who explained that she and Shaun had met at a club in Philadelphia.  Destiny was delighted to see her brothers with dates, but Shaun was clearly enjoying Greg and Rachel's discomfort.  As the Evans parents, Richard and Phylicia, arrived, Rachel mistook their warm greeting as being directed at her, only to be snubbed when Phylicia and Richard flocked to Vivian's side.  Rachel listened helplessly as Phylicia clucked over Vivian and invited her to Sunday dinner.\n\n\nThe party was on when Snoop arrived at Capricorn, ready to reunite with Shaun and meet his family.  Snoop turned on the charm with Destiny, who he called \"prettier than Beyonc\u00e9,\" and told Phylicia he felt he'd seen her somewhere before; she reminded him of someone who \"always delivered the goods.\"  Snoop asked Shaun where Greg was, but Shaun said he couldn't care less.  Destiny warned Snoop that Greg and Rachel were talking in private, and she sensed the wrong kind of \"heat\" between them.\n\n\nAt the bar, Rachel was seething about her ostracization from the Evans family proper.  She recalled the many family holidays Phylicia had all but ignored her at, and Greg told her that his mother probably would have disinvited her from Kwanzaa if the family celebrated it.\n\n\nFrustrated, Rachel headed for the ladies' room, only to run into T\u00e9a on the way.  She told T\u00e9a that she feared Greg suspected she knew more than she was telling about Schuyler and the oxytocin, and T\u00e9a said there was only one solution for Rachel's problem: tell Greg the truth.  As the ladies spoke, their eyes were drawn to Matthew and Danielle's reunion near the stage.\n\n\nNot far away, Blair greeted Starr and Markko.  She asked them about Langston, and was disappointed to hear her cousin had stayed home to work on the musical.  Fearing the worst, Blair suggested Markko rush home and surprise his girlfriend, but Starr shot the idea down and told them that Langston needed space to conquer her writer's block.\n\n\nBy the stage, Danielle chafed under Todd and T\u00e9a's watchful eyes, and told Matthew how disgusted she was with Todd's disapproval of him.  Overhearing their conversation, Cole told Matthew he could relate to Matthew's position; Todd hated Cole for being with Starr.  Matthew told Danielle that Todd would have to hate him too, because he cared for her and wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\nTodd watched Matthew and Danielle from a distance, but Starr interrupted his dark mood.  Starr warned her father not to make the same mistakes with Danielle and Matthew that he'd made with her and Cole.\n\n\nTodd wasn't the only one watching the kids, however; Bo and Nora couldn't keep their eyes off Matthew.  Bo told Nora not to worry about Matthew, or interfere, and drew her close for a kiss. He reminded her that any attempt to hide romantic passion would only make the fire burn stronger.\n\n\nSuddenly, Blair took the stage to welcome Snoop Dogg back to Llanview, and Capricorn went wild as Snoop performed a blazing set, with everyone from Jack to Phylicia Evans on the dance floor.  \"Llanview, what it do!\" Snoop crowed at the end of his performance.\n\n\nBack at the teens' apartment, Langston was hard at work on the school musical; answering the door, she found Ford, scarf in hand.  Langston took her scarf and nervously attempted to send him away, pleading workload.  Ford asked her if she was working on the musical, and offered a helping hand.  Langston agreed and returned to her laptop, but Ford nuzzling against her shoulder was too much for her to bear.  She rose from her seat, faced Ford, and kissed him. \n\n\n",
