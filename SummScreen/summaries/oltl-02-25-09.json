    "soap_central": "\nColor Him Father, Color Him Love\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi chatted over the phone with Marcie about the shocking twist in Rex's paternity quest. She was concerned that he'd have a bad reaction to the news that David was his father. After hanging up, Gigi answered the doorbell to find Oliver Fish on her front step. The smitten Fish asked for Stacy, explaining to Gigi that he and Stacy had \"fallen in love\" at the Go Red Ball. \n\n\nUpstairs, Stacy watched as Rex tossed and turned in bed, caught in the throes of a perverse nightmare. He envisioned himself as an overgrown baby in a crib, coddled by Dorian and David's suffocating familial embrace. As he woke, Stacy comforted him, copping a feel of his bare chest while she was at it. Just then, Gigi arrived to find the two in a compromising position. Gigi icily told her sister that Fish was there to see her. Confused, Stacy asked, \"Fish who?\" \n\n\nAfter Stacy headed downstairs, Gigi attempted to console Rex, who couldn't get over the idea that David Vickers was his father. Rex wondered if his grifter days had been a reflection of David's DNA, but Gigi told him he was nothing like David, and urged him to speak to Roxy for the truth. \n\n\nOver at the Angel Square Hotel, Roxy clucked over the damaging newspaper headlines about Wes's murder, telling \"Morris\" the stuffed beaver that the headlines were bad for business. Just as she began to bemoan having spent all of Dorian's \"hush money,\" Dorian herself flew into the hotel in a rage, demanding the facts on David's son. Roxy was shocked to hear the allegation that Rex was David's child: \"Are you saying I slept with a dog?\" Dorian clarified that she meant the human David, and explained the DNA tests that had linked the two men. Roxy was baffled and in the dark, but Dorian wasn't listening. She warned Roxy not to try to horn in on her piece of the Buchanan fortune, and reminded her that David was her man. \"How in heaven's name did you ever get David into your spandex?\" Dorian asked. As Dorian stormed out, Roxy returned to Morris' side, struggling to take in the bizarre situation. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Moe prevented Langston from heading outdoors, warning her that Dorian had ordered him to protect her from the nefarious Ray Montez. When Starr arrived in the kitchen, Moe forced the two reluctant girls together, pushing them to talk it out and resolve their differences. Langston and Starr were surly, but Moe wouldn't take no for an answer. \n\n\nAs the girls sat and ate, they gossiped, swapping notes about Ray's return and Marty's arrest, and what it would all mean for Lola and Cole. Langston suggested Starr call Cole and comfort him, but Starr begged off. Sulking, Langston commented that Starr only confided in Mr. Joplin of late. The conversation grew heated as Starr reminded Langston that she hadn't been able to rely on anyone else after Langston had turned on her during Todd's trial. Langston said she could understand Starr's reasons for protecting her father, but said she'd been angry and frightened at the possibility of losing Starr to jail over a perjury charge. Her eyes tearing up, Langston said Starr was still her best friend, and Langston needed Starr to be part of their family. Touched, Starr embraced Langston. \n\n\nHaving settled their differences, the girls discussed the men in their lives. Langston explained that Markko had been accepted to UCLA, and she feared she was holding him back by asking him to stay in Llanview. Both of the girls were saddened at the loss of \"the Fantastic Four\" with Cole and Markko ready for college. As they reflected on how their lives had changed in the past year, Starr said that she and Cole had shared the same dreams until her pregnancy, and the loss of Hope. She feared for him in the wake of Marty's arrest and his drug problem. Starr confessed that she had sought Schuyler Joplin's counsel about Cole, though she'd left his name out of it. She told Langston that Schuyler was a good listener, like Cole used to be. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, the Buchanan brothers bickered over David's shocking DNA results while David skimmed the Intruder. Bo and Clint ordered David out of the house, but David insisted that he was not Rex's father, and was certain that the truth of his heritage would come out when the test was rerun. \"Bo, how many times do I have to tell you,\" he said with a sigh. \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman!\" \n\n\nIn the foyer, Nora touched base with Cole, attempting to reassure him about Marty. Cole wanted to visit his mother, but was upset to learn she'd asked for no outside contacts. As Nora tried to lift his spirits, David entered and promptly taunted Cole about his mother's \"crimes.\" Furious, Cole rushed out, leaving Nora to harangue David about his casual cruelty. \n\n\nDown at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Noelle was full of praise for Markko's acceptance into UCLA, but the young man was unmoved; he told Noelle he was staying in Llanview and going to Llanview University to be with Langston. Markko couldn't understand why Langston was upset with him for choosing her over school, but Noelle told him that Langston didn't want to keep him from his dreams. \n\n\nCole arrived at the caf\u00e9 to visit Markko, still seething about Marty. He told his buddy that he'd been at the hotel the night of Wes's death, but hadn't entered the apartment. Markko backed Cole up, assuring him that Marty was innocent. Noticing Markko's acceptance letters, Cole was pleased to hear Markko had also gotten into UCLA. Markko said it was a non-issue, since he was staying in town. He said he was still devoted to Langston, as he felt Cole should be to Starr. Cole told Markko that he and Starr were over, and warned Markko to make sure that he wanted what Langston wanted. Markko thought it was ironic that he was staying, but the circle of friendship between the four teens had still fallen apart. He urged Cole to try to work things out with Starr, but Cole said he couldn't see his future with her anymore, not the way he had in the past. Markko remained optimistic, and reminded his friend that \"it ain't over 'til it's over.\" \n\n\nNoelle waited on Layla at a booth, and praised her for her wonderful stewardship of the Go Red Ball. Layla complimented Noelle on her grand \"coming out\" at the shindig, and commented on her expensive eveningwear. Noelle confessed that her and Moe's newfound riches came from Dorian, who had divested herself of material wealth upon her conversion to Buddhism. Layla's radar went up, and she warned Noelle that she'd dealt with Dorian one too many times not to be suspicious: \"Watch out.\" When Noelle brought up romance at the ball, Layla wistfully said that she'd had a man who'd wanted her, but she'd ignored him and lost him for good. \n\n\nBack at the carriage house, Rex left for Roxy's as Fish and Stacy shared an awkward reunion. The love-struck Fish suggested they become an official couple, but Stacy told him she wasn't interested. She said he'd been a one-night stand, and their encounter had meant nothing to her. Crushed, Fish left with a broken heart, and Gigi, who'd listened to the entire conversation from the landing, confronted her wayward sister. \n\n\nGigi laid into Stacy for using and abusing Fish, and bringing her hookups home to her family's house, where Shane could've borne witness. Stacy blew Gigi off, and said it had been no big deal. She apologized for her rash choices, claiming that she'd gotten carried away. She told Gigi that she didn't want loose ends like Fish getting in the way of her getting to know her sister again-and her nephew and Rex. Gigi pondered Stacy's words with consternation. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, the Buchanan boys continued to clash, as Bo paced, waiting on a court order to evict David and Dorian. David reminded the angry Bo that nothing had been verified, and David was still a true blue \"Buke.\" Dorian returned, along with forensic technician Kyle Lewis, who told the family that he'd re-run David's DNA test and discovered a major error. He apologized, and said that computer trouble had led David to be matched incorrectly with Rex: David Vickers was not Rex Balsom's father. Bo rushed into the foyer to tell Rex the news. \n\n\nBack at the Angel Square Hotel, Rex confronted Roxy, who asked if David was his father. Roxy's surprising response was \"yes.\" She hastily improvised her way through a backstory, claiming that she and David had had undeniable sexual chemistry, and she had kept the paternity hidden from Rex for fear of his emulating \"Dad\" and going back to the wild ways of his youth. Rex seemed prepared to accept Roxy's story, only to receive the call from Bo, confirming he was not kin to David Vickers. Outraged, Rex hung up and confronted Roxy. He told her that DNA had just proven her to be a liar, and demanded the whole truth and nothing but, leaving Roxy sputtering. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Bo rejoined Clint, Nora, David, and Dorian in the drawing room to hear Kyle's revised DNA results. The technician explained to the foursome that David was indeed a Buchanan, leading David and Dorian to high-five, until Kyle revealed that David was not Asa Buchanan's son, but Bo Buchanan's. As the room went into shock, all eyes went to Bo, who balefully turned to look to David. \n\n\n",
