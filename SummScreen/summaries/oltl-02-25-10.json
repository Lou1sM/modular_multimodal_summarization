They wondered where Schuyler was, and Gigi assumed he had rejected his daughter, the same as he had for months. Gigi felt stupid for believing in Schuyler all along, but Rex declared that both he and Gigi had been lied to for quite some time. He assured her that Shane was doing well and reminded her that their son was still related to Sierra, though no longer the baby's brother. He also advised her that he was doing well himself though Gigi didn't believe him. She knew how excited he had been at the thought of being a new dad.\n\n\nGigi admitted that she had given Schuyler \"holy hell\" for playing with their lives. Rex was curious to know how she had learned to deliver a baby, and she divulged that it was \"on-the-job-training.\" She had been exhausted afterwards and it felt like she had given birth herself, she said. She had been determined to help her sister. Rex couldn't believe she had done everything for Stacy after all that Stacy had done. He thought that Gigi had heart, one of the biggest there was.\n\n\nAs they waited for news of the infant's surgery, Rex asked about Sierra's name. Gigi explained that Sierra Rose had been the names of the dolls that she and Stacy had played with as children. Stacy had thought about her childhood after the baby had been delivered, Gigi noted. She and Rex spoke of family matters, and Rex assured her that he would be around for Shane forever. Gigi wondered if Schuyler would always be around for Sierra in the same way, and Rex was sure that Schuyler would. He reminded Gigi that Schuyler would always be a part of her life, too, because of the baby.\n\n\nBrody arrived to pay Jessica a visit, and Natalie explained to Viki that he had an idea to try to help Jessica remember him. \"It's you,\" Jessica exclaimed when Brody entered her hospital room. He was stocked with photos and a DVD of the two of them together that he had put together for Jessica to see. He wanted her to see how happy they had been. He also had to explain what a DVD was, since her memory was stuck in 1997.\n\n\nBrody started the DVD and Jessica watched as the two of them joked around and then kissed. She went through some of the photos as Brody tried to strike a chord by telling her the story of how they met. Jessica was pretty sure she didn't know the Jessica on the DVD and didn't want to waste more time. She couldn't believe how old she looked on the video. She felt numb. Brody asked for a kiss before he left, sure that Jessica would respond to it, much as she had on the mountain. He was sure that the Jessica he knew had to be inside of her somewhere.\n\n\nHe leaned over and kissed her deeply but Jessica finally pulled away and chuckled. His kiss didn't trigger anything, and it was like they never happened. Brody was visibly upset. She felt she owed him for saving her life, but he just wanted her to keep looking at the photos. They would tell her everything she needed to know, he told her.\n\n\nIn another waiting area, Rachel advised Schuyler that she was there for him because she knew he needed a friend. He exclaimed that Stacy was dead because of him, and Rachel was taken aback. He clarified that it was because he hadn't told anyone the truth. Rachel asked him point-blank about the oxytocin, and it was Schuyler's turn to be surprised. He admitted he had taken it. She was disappointed and had been praying it wasn't true, she proclaimed.\n\n\nSchuyler made it clear that while he had taken it, he hadn't used it or given it to Stacy. \"Hell no,\" he exclaimed as he noted that too many things could have gone wrong. He wasn't about to destroy any lives, he added. \"I knew it,\" Rachel shouted. \n\n\nRachel advised Schuyler that she had stopped Greg from going through Schuyler's things in the apartment as he had searched for evidence regarding the vial of oxytocin. After Greg left, however, she couldn't stop herself and found the empty vial in Schuyler's bag. She admitted that she gave it to T\u00e9a, who promised to hide it so that no one could use it as evidence. That worried Schuyler, but Rachel disclosed that while she was T\u00e9a's friend, she was also a client. Schuyler confessed that he no longer cared about his career.\n\n\nViki acknowledged that she couldn't get over Charlie hurting Jessica or that he had tried to kill someone to begin with. Natalie reminded her mother that she, too, had tried to kill Mitch. While Viki understood that the behavior was acceptable because Natalie was full of grief, her daughter had to remind her that Charlie shared that same grief. Viki only knew how worried she had been, and she was thankful that Natalie was okay. Natalie assured her mother that John had gotten her and himself through it all. Viki had no doubt that John would keep Natalie safe.\n\n\nNatalie revealed that she had even turned John into someone else. She proceeded to explain how she thought that John was Jared. She had kissed him because of that, she told her mom. The first time, she added. After that, she knew it was John when she kissed him again. Viki wanted to know if her daughter was falling for John, but Natalie assured her mother that she and John were just friends. It was just that their past relationship had been so intense, she concluded.\n\n\nAs Ford tried to get close to Langston in her apartment, she pushed him away and told him to leave. Ford's opinion was that she was too young to be tied down, but she stressed that she had made a commitment to Markko and she loved him. He asked why she kept returning Ford's kisses if that were the truth. He wanted to know if she really wanted him to leave, and she replied that part of her wanted it and the other didn't. He wondered if she thought it or wanted it, because part of it was just noise in her head and the other was from somewhere else. \"Talk to me from there,\" he ordered.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Markko confided to Starr and Cole that he really missed Langston, but they refused to allow him to call her. They wanted her to have the time and space alone to work on her musical. One of Cole's college classmates showed up and asked to speak to Cole about a class project. As Cole went off with Hannah, Markko accused Starr of being jealous, which was pretty evident by her reaction. He reminded Starr that she once told him that Langston chose Markko because she loved him, and the same went for Starr and Cole. Markko couldn't help himself because he missed his girl. He left to check up on Langston.\n\n\nCole finished his conversation with his classmate and returned to Starr. He couldn't believe that Markko had left. Cole explained that he and his friend would be working on a class project together, one that involved the students working in pairs. Starr gulped and asked if Cole had to be the girl's partner. He asked Starr if she was okay, and Starr insisted she was. He told her not to worry, though he wondered how things would be if the tables were turned and she needed to work with a guy. He offered to switch his partner if it was a problem and said it was Starr's call.\n\n\nStarr began to get upset and questioned Cole. She asked him what the project involved, and he quickly responded \"human sexuality.\" When he saw her face, he could tell she didn't think it was funny and assured her he was kidding.\n\n\nCristian expressed his concern about Jessica to John, and noted that the Cristian and Jessica used to mean a lot to each other, and he still cared about her. Marty surprised John when she showed up at the club. She told him about Jessica's memory loss, though she noted that Natalie was apparently difficult for anyone to forget. Marty apologized for being distant with John and realized she should have accepted Natalie's explanation about the kiss Marty had found John sharing with Natalie. John confessed that he had let Natalie believe that he was Jared, the first time.\n\n\nHe didn't know why he let it happen but maybe it was because he thought they might die, he acknowledged. He thought that he had gotten caught up in his past with Natalie, but he was certain they didn't have anything going on in the present. Marty asked how far things would have gone if she hadn't walked in on them. John was sure that things would have gone no further, and he advised Marty that he wanted to be with her, not Natalie. He wanted to fight for them to get through this and asked for her forgiveness.\n\n\nFord thought that Langston wanted him to stay and suddenly she turned and locked the door, and made sure to put the chain on. They began to kiss passionately and fell onto the couch. As Ford removed his shirt, Langston stopped him. She realized that they didn't have protection. Ford whipped a condom from his pocket. \"Well, aren't you prepared?\" Langston muttered. Ford wanted to go to the bedroom, but Langston wasn't keen on that idea.\n\n\nLangston removed her blouse and the air grew steamy. As she and Ford were about to go to the next level, Markko turned his key in the lock. He was unable to get into the apartment as the secured chain held fast. He called into the apartment and a panic-stricken Langston ordered Ford to hide in the closet. She hastily adjusted her clothing and opened the front door. She told Markko that she had heard a noise in the hallway and felt safer with the chain on the door.\n\n\nShe assured him she wasn't alone, but changed her mind in what she was about to say. She told him the television had been on because she hadn't been able to concentrate on writing her musical. Markko thought that Langston felt warm, and she agreed. She asked him to get her some aspirin and as soon as he left the room, Langston raced to the closet and ordered Ford to hurry and leave. \"Like it or not, tonight happened for a reason,\" he told her. She relocked the door and nervously told Markko that she thought she was getting sick, and he needed to stay away from her. She tried to avoid him as he reached out to touch her more than once. He appreciated that she was being so kind to him and thinking of him by not getting him sick too.\n\n\nMarkko admitted that he had been thinking about the two of them making love that night and he was sorry that Langston had missed Snoop Dogg's performance at the club. She should have been there, he told her. As she continued to push Markko away from her, Langston agreed that she should have gone to the club.\n\n\nGigi was tired of talking about Schuyler and just then the doctor emerged from the operating room and announced that the baby's surgery was over. Schuyler wandered over and joined the group. The doctor told them the surgery went well and the baby's heart had been repaired, but all they could do was wait. The next 24 hours would determine the effectiveness of the surgery. Gigi headed to the couch and plopped herself down. Awkwardly, both of her beaus made a move to sit next to her. Rex reached her first and sat down on one side of Gigi. Schuyler, ill at ease, planted himself on the table's edge by Gigi's other side, as there was no more room on the couch.\n\n\nViki returned to Jessica's room after Brody left. She didn't want Brody to force Jessica to try to remember him, but she didn't blame him for being upset. Jessica knew that things \"sucked\" for Brody, but Viki assured her they would live with Jessica's loss of memory if they had to. Jessica thought she was getting close, though, and remembered having feelings after she looked at one of the photos. She looked at it again and her eyes landed on Cristian.\n\n\nBrody and Natalie headed to Capricorn. Marty, John, and Cristian extended their sympathies for Jessica's plight. Natalie and Marty felt sorry for Brody. John resumed his conversation with Marty, and she agreed that it was time for them to move forward. As he leaned over to kiss her, Natalie looked on unhappily.\n\n\nCole and Starr shared a kiss, and Hannah interrupted them because she wanted to say goodbye to Cole. Cole introduced the girls, and Hannah learned that Starr was not yet a college student. Starr decided that Hannah was quite nice. Cole told Starr he loved her, and they agreed they should trust each other.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gigi is worried about the fate of her baby niece and about Stacy's death. She is furious with Schuyler and is getting along much better with Rex. The await the outcome of surgery and are not certain what to expect. After the Snoop Dogg concert at Capricorn, Starr, Cole and Markko miss Langston who has not joined them. She tells them that she has work to do. But she keeps \"running into\" Ford. and it looks like she has him on the brain. Together, they are ready to go at it when Markko comes home to be with her. She cannot tell him what almost happen but seems to be obsessing over Ford. Jessica has no memory of Brody or their relationship but indicates she remembers \"feelings\" about somebody. She just can't think of who. Dani admits to Matthew that she has some real difficulty dealing with the reputation of being the rapist's' daughter. He tells her he wants to be there for her. And it looks like in time, the two of them will be a couple. Kim is with Clint who wants to be supportive to her after she's lost her best friend. Gigi is furious with Schuyler for lying and denying that he was the father of Stacy's baby and declares that she cannot trust him. Rachel is concerned about what could happen to Schuyler after finding the oxytocin that he gave to Stacy to induce labor now that she knows the baby is in critical condition. Tea promises to handle it for them and hides it so that there is no evidence to hold up in court if it comes to that.",
