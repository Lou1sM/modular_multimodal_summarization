An elated Nash shared the news: his credit line was extended and he was ready to start expanding the vineyard and develop marketing. He was feeling very proud because he did it all himself, without Jared, which made the deal that much sweeter. Jess wasn't feeling it at all as she shared her own news. Allison was in a medically induced coma due to her severe injuries and Jess would probably never hear Allison's secret. Nash was convinced that there never was a secret to begin with. He felt that the smashed DVD was meaningless also. He reminded Jess that she'd said she wasn't going to obsess over Allison and her secret, and with the vineyard being solid and Jared no longer a thorn in their sides, the black cloud was being lifted. Jess couldn't stop thinking about Allison and Nash tried to cheer her up. She was also feeling guilty. As the couple got cozy, Jess received a disturbing call from Clint and headed out to see him. Nash received a phone call also, contradictory to his earlier call. He was advised that his loan was not approved. He attempted to argue with the person on the phone but was unsuccessful. After being hung up on, he immediately placed another call. He asked the party on the other end to make a deal. \n\n\nMarcie looked at old pictures as Michael announced it was time to head for her hearing. He was hopeful that her sentence would be light. \n\n\nIn the courtroom, Nora hounded Todd until he signed the statement saying he would not press charges against Marcie. Bo showed up to tie up some loose ends. Todd asked Bo what he was going to do about Lee being his replacement, but Bo advised him that it would work out eventually. Bo said that it was inevitable that Lee would trip himself up. Nora chuckled when she realized that she and Todd finally agreed about something-getting rid of Lee. Todd pointed out that she had it good with Bo being the commissioner previously, though she assured him that Bo was the most ethical man ever. Nora reminded Todd that Bo helped him out many times in the past. She begged Todd to give her something on the new police commissioner; she was positive that Todd knew something about Lee. Todd would only tell her that the man was not to be trusted. Nora recalled Todd backing off from his previous accusations of Lee shooting at Gigi and Shane, and pleaded with him to help her bring Lee down, to just give her one thing. Todd offered to think about it but he rejected the idea, having remembered Lee's threats to his family. He said he would if he could.\n\n\nMarcie received a sentence of two years on probation plus community service. She and Michael were told they could not adopt a child during that time. Their lawyer pointed out that the mayor and new police commissioner would not be happy. She hoped that Nora would keep her job since it all depended on her recommendation. \n\n\nJohn was at the police station fuming when he learned of Lee's appointment as police commissioner. \"How did this happen,\" he asked vehemently. He said he only wanted to storm into Lee's office and rip his head off but Antonio tried to talk some sense into him. John learned that the mayor appointed Lee. John complains that the mayor was always in someone's back pocket and was a very crooked man. John was quite adamant about not working for Lee. Antonio informed him that Bo fast-tracked John's reinstatement and that they were all staying there out of respect for Bo. Antonio asked John to leave before Lee saw him. Talia decided to create a diversion and walked into Lee's office to ask for a file. She learned that he was handling all current cases and all cold cases were in the trash. Lee was extremely rude and condescending and proceeded to show himself as both racist and sexist. He asked about the Hispanic officer that she was friendly with and wondered how her family was taking it, since Arab families normally kept their women under tight wraps. He commented on her big blue eyes. Thoroughly disgusted, she told Antonio she needed a shower after leaving Lee's office. Antonio threatened to take him out but Talia was offended. She pointed out that she was able to take care of herself as she had shown on several recent busts she'd made. She considered Lee a hatemonger. \n\n\nRex was hanging out with Shane at Llanfair. He had a chat with Gigi and they reminisced about old times. \"What was it like, meeting the father you never knew,\" she asked quite suddenly. Rex was curious as to why she wanted to know but told her there were all kinds of feelings ranging from joy and wonder to a let-down. She told him she merely found the whole thing interesting. \n\n\nMichael learned that he was reinstated at the hospital, when he and Marcie arrived at the court for her hearing. Todd berated Marcie and tortured her by holding up pictures of his happy family. He told her that everyone had a happy ending except for her. Nora ordered him out of the courtroom. Marcie's eyes filled with tears, the only sign that she was even aware of her surroundings. She was speechless and staring. John met up with Bo and assured him that he would be fired when Lee found out that he was back on the force. The former commissioner reminded John that there would have to be just cause and beseeched him to stay and help because he would greatly be needed. He advised that John, Antonio, and Talia would need to keep an eye on Lee. He added that he was trying to find out how Lee obtained the position and wanted to check with Washington, where Lee previously worked for the FBI. John vowed that he would kill Lee. He told Bo that he had already been to Washington and was able to learn nothing, and that Lee must have something on everyone. They thought that they should locate someone to testify against Lee. Just then Todd walked up and, having overheard, said that he hoped \"you don't mean who I think you mean.\" Todd felt that Gigi could not speak against the former agent, and as for him, he said it wasn't his problem. Nora entered the conversation and she, John, and Bo felt that Todd was scared of Lee. Both Nora and Bo received strange phone calls from Clint and had to leave. \n\n\nTodd phoned someone and asked to make a deal. \n\n\nMichael and Marcie arrived home and she headed straight for the family pictures again, wordlessly. An angry Michael instructed Marcie to snap out of it. \n\n\nJohn headed back to the station where Lee spotted him as he went through a file. John tried to tell him that he was back on the force but Lee was pretty sure that wouldn't happen as long as he was there. John accused him of being overconfident, held up his badge and advised him that he wasn't going away. \n\n\n",
