    "soap_central": "\n Won't Get Fooled Again \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Markko listened as Lola related everything that had happened during the confrontation between Vanessa, Cristian, Ray, and T\u00e9a. She confided that she hoped her father would be released from jail soon, but wondered if he really wanted to see her. She wanted to see him, but wanted to stay in Llanview and not return to Colombia with him. \n\n\nJohn headed to the empty room at the Angel Square Hotel most recently shared by Marty and Wes. He was determined to find a clue to Wes's homicide. Down in the lobby, Rex's confrontation with Roxy was momentarily delayed when Blair arrived looking for John. She knew that she'd find John in the vacant room when he didn't answer his own door. She reminded him that he was no longer a cop and that the police had already checked the room out. \n\n\nJohn refused to \"get into it\" with Blair, and asked about her running back to Todd instead. She retorted that she had expected him to believe that nothing had happened and that she was very eager to \"get into it.\" Once again, she told him that she had not had sex with Todd. John admitted he believed and trusted her. She trusted him, also, she confirmed, but not Marty. She disclosed that she had come to apologize for her behavior at the ball, but when she didn't find him at home, she knew where he would be. She made it known that she had been honest with him about her fears, and she admitted to being too jealous. She thought that Marty wouldn't come between them, and felt that John wasn't lying to her, but was lying to himself about his true feelings. \n\n\nThey both admitted that things were going well with them before Marty was found, but John insisted that he could never stop caring about anyone who was in his life. It was a fault of his, he added. He accused Blair of ruining their relationship, not Marty, and refused to discuss it further. Blair didn't want to drop it, advising John that while she knew that he tried to do right by her, he should have told her everything that was going on as it was happening, back when he first suspected that Marty might be alive. Blair insisted that everything was Marty's fault. \"Enough,\" John said firmly. \"You're right, it is,\" Blair replied. \n\n\nBlair continued, though, telling John that she didn't like to be used. While John denied it, she pointed out that Marty had used Wes, and John had used Blair, to deny their true feelings for each other. John insisted that he cared for Blair, but she pointed out that he loved Marty. Crying, John maintained that Blair was not able to tell him how he felt. Blair professed that she wanted and deserved more from a relationship. She told him to go and save Marty. She cried, too, and told him not to say anything at all, and that he did that the best. \n\n\nNot able to stall any longer once Blair headed up the stairs, Roxy blurted out that she lied about Rex's real father because David would have been better than the real one. Roxy admitted to lying about Rex's father once again and just agreeing with the lab results because it was much easier than telling Rex the truth. Cornered, she began to cry, and told Rex about the awful man that his real father was. He hurt lots of people while pretending to be something he wasn't, and she had hated him, she declared. As Rex continued to press for his father's name, Roxy screamed that the man was gone. She had killed him, she confessed, and didn't want it known. \"Are you happy now?\" she asked her son. \n\n\nA tearful Roxy said that she had to save herself and that the man was a horrible and disgusting person. She refused to tell Rex his name, stating that they would lose everything if people found out. Looking into his mother's eyes, Rex saw that she was finally telling him the truth. Roxy felt that Rex was trying to hurt her by continuing to ask for information. She wanted the entire issue buried and forgotten. She was concerned that her son would hate her all over again, but he assured her he didn't. He promised not to say a word to anyone and vowed to let it go. Giving her a hug, he told her his search was over. \n\n\nAs a bewildered and speechless Bo took in the information that David was his son, the remainder of his family refused to accept the revelation. \"We should probably hug,\" David said, wrapping his arms around his newly identified father. Grabbing him and roughly pushing him away, Bo found nothing to joke about. Dorian accused the Buchanans of pulling another stunt, though, when Bo grabbed the test results and read them. He quietly admitted that it might all be true. \n\n\nHe recalled the big party the night before he left for Vietnam when he was 20 years old. He recollected all of the people, the drinking, and that he had gone to bed with a woman whose name he didn't even know. It was entirely possible that it could have been David's mother. David was angry that Bo hadn't even taken the time to learn the woman's name. Clint asked that additional samples be taken for new DNA testing, but Bo was confident that things wouldn't change. Happily, Nora announced that she would procure an injunction to have Dorian and David removed from the house. She declared the addendum to Asa's will to be null and void. Dorian vowed to fight the Buchanans. \n\n\nAn almost worshipful David was honored to believe that such a decent, kind, and honest man could really be his father. He wondered what he would have turned out to be if he had Bo in his life when he was young. Trying to lighten the mood, he asked his recently found father to go outside for a game of catch, calling him Dad. Bo, hardly in a joking mood, quickly bolted from the house. Before leaving, he noted that being upset couldn't come close to describing what he felt. Clint realized that while it was hardly good news, it might save the family. \n\n\nAt the police station, hearing the news that Vanessa would be deported for all of her crimes, Antonio blamed T\u00e9a for betraying everyone in the Vega family. T\u00e9a denied forcing Cristian to marry Vanessa, but he accused her of taking advantage of Cristian. She knew exactly how Cristian would react to the situation, Antonio believed. She admitted to sending the threatening letter, but wanted forgiveness from the brothers. Cristian felt partly to blame, since he was the one who brought Vanessa to the United States. \n\n\nInsisting that she loved the Vegas, T\u00e9a found herself rebuked by Antonio instead. \"You have a lot to learn about family,\" he told her. Vanessa was brought in wearing handcuffs and she attempted to talk to Cristian. He made her want to change, she told him. She praised him for being such a good man. Cristian had nothing to say, other than to inform Vanessa that he was filing papers for an annulment. \n\n\nSitting in his jail cell, Ray voiced his hope that Vanessa would enjoy Plato Prison as much as he did. As he proclaimed his innocence, Marty, in the cell next to Ray, advised him that they were in the same boat. While she, too, was accused of a murder, she had no recollection of it, she explained. When she added that the evidence pointed towards her, Ray assured her that \"evidence can lie,\" and he told her about his own murder conviction. \"Prison is no place for the innocent,\" he said solemnly. He asked what was in her heart and whether she thought she could have committed a murder. He doubted himself at one time, too, he divulged, because crazy thoughts began to consume him. He knew he couldn't have killed his wife, though. \n\n\nConfidently, Ray told Marty that one could identify murderers by their hands and eyes, and she did not have those of a murderer. She revealed that she couldn't imagine herself killing someone, especially Wes, her friend. He ordered her to fight and take matters into her own hands, just as he had. T\u00e9a stopped at Ray's cell, advising him that she planned on going to all of the news bureaus due to the latest revelations in his case. She doubted that he would be extradited to Colombia, pointing out that the staff at the prison there was probably sick of him. She counseled that he would have to speak to a judge and that she was filing to have his conviction overturned. Turning to Marty on his way out, Ray suggested she hire T\u00e9a, the best attorney money could buy. Drolly, Marty noted that she was familiar with T\u00e9a's work. He told her to fight and to do whatever needed to be done to gain her freedom. \n\n\nHeading their separate ways, Ray and Vanessa faced each other in the station. Vanessa insisted that Ray killed his wife, but Lola, who showed up in spite of her father's wishes, called Vanessa a liar. She hugged her dad and told him she missed him. Vanessa apologized for all that had transpired with Lola. The teen blamed herself for all of Ray's problems but Ray assured her that it wasn't her fault, just Vanessa's. Antonio pointed out that the real murderer could still be around. As both Ray and Vanessa were escorted out, Lola tearfully pulled a picture of her family from her purse. Speaking to no one in particular, she said that it was her fault that she made her papi pay for everything she had done to mami. \n\n\nRex ran into Bo at the caf\u00e9. \"Why couldn't you be my dad,\" Rex asked. Bo wondered why Rex couldn't be his son. \n\n\nBack at the hotel, Roxy turned to speak to Morris. She confided that it was better to lie and let Rex think that his real father was dead instead of alive and close by. \n\n\nBlair showed up at the Buchanan mansion where Dorian was happy to see her. Ready to gush on about all of the current issues, she stopped dead in her tracks when she saw the tears streaming down Blair's face. \n\n\nJohn received a phone call from Marty, who wanted his help. She insisted she was innocent.\n\n\n",
