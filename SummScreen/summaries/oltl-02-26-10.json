    "soap_central": "\n \nAt the hospital, Clint encountered Brody, who had spent the night outside of Jessica's room.  Recalling how hard he and Jessica had fought to get their lives back, Brody was heartbroken that Jessica had no memories of him.   Reminding Brody that Jessica loved him, Clint urged Brody not to give up on her.  A determined Brody declared, \"I'll never give up on her!\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside her hospital room, Jessica studied the picture that Brody had given her.  The photo displayed Brody and Jessica sitting at a table at Capricorn, and Cristian tending bar in the background.  Ignoring the image of Brody, Jessica smiled as her eyes locked on Cristian.\n\n\nLater, Charlie approached Brody, who informed Charlie that Jessica had survived the surgery.   Brody noticed Charlie's guilty demeanor and reminded Charlie that he had aimed at Mitch and hadn't intended to shoot Jessica.  Filled with contempt for Mitch, Brody expressed his hatred for Mitch and insisted that he would've taken the same action.  \n\n\nWhen Brody told Charlie that Mitch had performed electric shock treatment on Jessica and she had lost thirteen years of memories, Charlie expressed concern for Viki.  Brody suggested that Charlie contact Viki, but Charlie didn't want to upset her.  Insisting that Viki loved Charlie, Brody pleaded with his friend not to give up on her.   Suggesting that Brody take his own advice, Charlie asked Brody not to give up on Jessica.  Brody promised to fight for her.\n\n\nAs Jessica continued to study the image of Cristian, Clint entered the room and inquired about her mood.  Stating that she was ready to receive some answers to some very tough questions, Jessica asked, \"Is it true, you're not my biological father?\"  After Clint explained that he loved Jessica regardless of their blood ties, Jessica asked about her grandfather.   Jessica was shocked to learn that Asa had passed away.   As Clint detailed Asa's final night, a heartbroken Jessica burst into tears.   Clint and Jessica shared special memories of Asa.  Recalling the beautiful prom dress that Asa had purchased for her, Jessica remembered that she had worn the gown to her senior prom, and that Cristian had been her escort.\n\n\nUpon receiving a call from a specialist that he had contact concerning Jessica's condition, Clint stepped away.   Retrieving the photo of Cristian, Jessica dialed information and asked for Cristian Vega's phone number.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Cristian teased Ford about leaving Capricorn the previous night to meet up with his mystery woman.   Layla interrupted the conversation and inquired about Ford's mystery girl.  When Cristian related that Ford was dating a student, Layla warned Ford that he might regret his decision to date a student, and advised him not to break the young girl's heart.   When Ford exited the room to shower, Cristian pulled Layla into an embrace and pleaded with her to take the day off from work.    Layla succumbed to Cristian's charms, and the two shared a passionate kiss.   Afterward, Layla rushed off to work.\n\n\nMoments later, Cristian was surprised when Jessica phoned and chimed, \"I'm at the hospital, you want to come and see me?\"  A confused Cristian agreed to pay Jessica a visit. At the hospital, Brody encountered Cristian and was surprised to learn that Jessica had contacted Cristian.   Brody sulked as he watched Cristian enter Jessica's room.\n\n\nUpon noticing Cristian, Jessica discreetly placed his photo under her pillow.  Displaying a seductive smile, Jessica moaned, \"Ahhh, Cris!\"   Pleased that Jessica remembered him, Cristian told her that she meant a lot to him.   Gazing at him, Jessica replied, \"You mean a lot to me too!\"   As Cristian leaned down to give her an innocent kiss on the cheek, Jessica pulled him close and gave him a passionate kiss.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Langston studied herself in the mirror and had a flashback of her near sexual experience with Ford.  Starr observed Langston's weird behavior and questioned if Langston was sick.  Langston attempted to divert Starr's questioning, but Markko entered the room and informed Starr that Langston was experiencing flu-like symptoms.   As Markko explained that he had discovered Langston in a terrible state the previous night, Langston burst into tears and apologized for her behavior.   While Markko showed concern for Langston's health, Starr appeared suspicious.   When Markko suggested that Langston not attend Dorian's reunion party, Langston reminded him that he had an early class and pushed him out the door.\n\n\nAlone with her Langston, Starr demanded answers from her friend.   Convinced that Langston was hiding something, Starr wondered if her friend was sick or pregnant.   After denying that she was keeping an awful secret, Langston blurted out, \"I'm feeling guilty!  I'm not the person I'm supposed to be!\"  \n\n\nStarr insisted that Langston was a good person, but Langston disagreed.  Assuming that Langston was concerned about the progress of her musical, Starr suggested that Langston ask Ford for advice.   When Starr mentioned that Ford had asked about Langston at Capricorn the previous night, Langston flew into a rage.  Realizing that Ford had arrived at her apartment, fully aware that she was alone, Langston rushed out the door.\n\n\nWearing a towel, Ford answered the door and smiled when he observed Langston.  An irate Langston accused Ford of attempting to seduce her.    With a sly grin, Ford declared, \"If your boyfriend hadn't walked in, I would've!\"  An emotional Langston responded by slapping Ford.\n\n\nAfterward, Langston insisted that she loved Markko, but Ford was adamant that they shared a special connection.  Unable to suppress her feelings, Langston kissed Ford.\n\n\nCole listened as Starr expressed concern for Langston.  When Starr teased Cole about Hannah, his classmate, Cole offered to drop Hannah as his partner, but Starr assured Cole that she didn't have any concern about Cole working with Hannah.\n\n\nRoxy arrived at the maximum-security prison, and was surprised to learn that Destiny's dad, Mr. Evans, was the head guard.  When Roxy announced that she wanted to see Mitch Laurence, Mr. Evans suggested that Roxy reconsider her request.\n\n\nApproaching Mitch's cell, Roxy related that she was pleased that Mitch was incarcerated and unable to hurt anyone else.    Avoiding eye contact with her, Mitch happily replied, \"Hello Roxy!  What are you talking about?   I wouldn't hurt a flea!\"  Infuriated, Roxy lashed out at Mitch and screamed, \"We both know what you did!\"    Referring to Jessica and Rex, Mitch declared, \"I'd never hurt one of my own!\"\n\n\nGloating, Roxy told Mitch that he would rot in his jail cell.   Mitch stunned Roxy when he replied, \"Are you sure about that?\"    A terrified Roxy demanded to know the meaning behind Mitch's statement, but he simply smiled and announced that he planned to write his memoirs while imprisoned.   \n\n\nIn a threatening tone, Mitch stated, \"I think there are many people who would be interested to learn about my past!  Don't you think so, Roxanne?\"    Mitch's threat struck an intense fear in Roxy.   In a wild fit, Roxy raced toward the door and screamed, \"Let me out of here!\"   Afterward, Mitch displayed a devilish smile and reached for his Bible.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair watched as an ecstatic Dorian prepared for the reunion of the Cramer girls.   Dorian instructed Blair to locate Cassie's favorite flower.  Beaming, Dorian declared, \"I can't wait to show all my girls just how important they are to me!\"  Expressing her relief that Mitch was behind bars, Dorian maintained that her girls were safe at last, but Blair feared that Mitch's followers might have orders to carry out his devious plan against the Cramer women.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly and Adriana sat on a plane headed for Llanview.   Apologizing for chasing Emil away, Kelly stated that she had thought that he was one of Mitch's followers.  As Adriana complained that she would never see Emil again, a slight turbulence struck the plane.\n\n\nAt that very moment, Cassie sat on a plane and waited for takeoff.  A nervous Cassie asked a flight attendant for a cup of water for her tea.  Retrieving a tea bag from her purse, Cassie told the flight attendant that her Aunt Addie had sent her the soothing tea.  Placing the cup to her mouth, Cassie exclaimed, \"It's guaranteed to cure whatever ails you!\"\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Dorian asked Blair to check on the girls' flights.    Dorian grew concerned when Blair informed her that Kelly and Adriana's flight was on schedule, but Cassie's flight had been delayed.\n\n\nBack on Cassie's flight, while Cassie was missing from her seat, her cup of tea sat nearby.  As the tea bag floated in the cup, the pilot could be heard over the intercom making an urgent request for a doctor.\n\n\nLater, Dorian was pleased when Kelly appeared at the front door.  After a brief reunion, Dorian wondered what had happened to Adriana.   In a nervous tone, Kelly informed her that there had been an accident.  Moments later, Adriana staggered to the door on crutches.  Insisting that she was okay, Adriana told Dorian that she had sprained her ankle on the plane.  Dorian beamed with pride when Adriana stated that she was excited to see her mother.\n\n\nWhile Blair and Kelly exchanged unpleasant words with one another, Starr entered the room and greeted her cousins.  When Starr informed Dorian that Langston would be late for the party, a disappointed Dorian stated, \"I guess Langston had more important things to do, but at least she's safe!\"    Sensing her mother's concern, Adriana reminded Dorian that Mitch couldn't hurt anyone because he was in a maximum-security prison.\n\n\nLater, everyone was surprised when Andrew arrived at the house.  When Dorian asked if Cassie had accompanied him, in a somber voice, Andrew announced, \"I have some bad news!\"\n\n\nBack at the maximum-security prison, Mr. Evans ended his shift and another guard sat at his post.  Moments later, a woman with a raspy voice approached and stated, \"My name is Roxanne Balsom and I need to see Mitch Laurence!\"   Examining the visitor's log, the guard related that she had already paid Mitch a visit.  Sporting a long blonde wig, Allison Perkins replied, \"I forgot to tell him something!  It's important!\"\n\n \n\n\n",
