It wasn't until they heard Antonio's shouting that they stopped and put their clothes back on. Talia went outside to call the police and was knocked out by an unidentified assailant. \n\n\nVincent found Natalie on the rooftop \u2014 the same rooftop where they kissed \u2014 and immediately told her she looked beautiful. \"I look like hell,\" responded Nat. \"Not to me,\" he said, and tried to explain that she has the wrong idea about him, that he's \"just a regular guy.\" Nat admitted that she told John what she'd been keeping from him and that it could cost her John and her job; Vincent said he wouldn't lose any sleep if she and John called it quits. Tiring of his smooth talking, she tried to walk away, but he grabbed her arm and asked what it would take to prove that he genuinely cares about her well-being. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Rex and Adriana filled in Layla on the Nelly Furtado performance when suddenly Marcie barged in to tell them that Michael was at the police station. Rex claimed to know nothing about the investigation; Marcie begged him to call Bo and try to get some information. Rex tried to comfort Marcie and suggested that this whole \"in for questioning\" thing is just brotherly code. Like code for everybody come to the police station! Marcie, Rex and Adriana decided to take a field trip there. Layla looked on silently, then showed up on the rooftop and interrupted John and Nat's convo to tell them about Michael. After Natalie left, Layla snarked that it was a nice night for stealing another man's girlfriend. \n\n\nAt the station, John demanded to hear the truth about Truman's murder. Michael argued that the situation isn't simple and that it's not just about Truman, it's about protecting his family. John failed to get answers out of his bro and accused him of lying. A fiery Michael pleaded with John to close the case, especially if he cares about his nephew, Tommy. John threatened that Mike's \"talking in riddles\" is just going to put him behind bars. John wasn't pleased to see Rex, Adriana and Marcie at the police station, but he told Marcie he doesn't want to believe that Michael would kill anyone. John flashed back to previous cryptic conversations with Rex and Michael at the P.D. and decided to put them a room together and watch the sparks fly. Instead, they frustrated him by speaking \"pig Latin.\" Rex accused him of being paranoid and maintained that he doesn't know anything about Spencer's murder. \n\n\nAt the diner, Paige told Bo that she'd been offered a job overseas and was consulting with Dorian and Lindsay on whether she should take it. Bo and Paige took a seat by themselves and Lindsay reamed out Dorian for blabbing to Paige about her scheme to get back Bo. Paige apologized for telling Bo about the job offer in front of Dorian and Lindsay and broke the news that the job is in Pakistan. She said she felt the job might be a way to make amends with her shady drinking-and-doing surgery past. A hopeful Bo said he and Matthew could get along okay without Paige for a few months, but she said she didn't know how long she'd be there for. Dorian joked that she's surprised Lindsay isn't over at Paige's table buying her an airline ticket. Bo asked if Paige was breaking up with him and said it sounded like her mind was already made up about Pakistan; she denied both. After Bo left, she threatened to kill Lindsay if she ever hurt Bo. \n\n\nAntonio managed to keep his clothes on while rescuing Nash and Jess ... and drape himself in a tablecloth and find a makeshift staff so he could kick the door open Moses-style. Nash told Jessica to go out first, but she refused to leave without him. Talia continued to lie unconscious outside. Antonio went to help Nash, and suddenly a giant, industrial air shaft fell from the ceiling onto both of them. \n\n\n",
