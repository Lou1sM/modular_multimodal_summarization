As Jess screams in vain for them to get up, Talia wakes up outside and calls the fire department. She runs in and attempts to get Jess out; Antonio comes to but is in great pain. He manages to rouse Nash and get him up and out from under the equipment. As they make their way, the ceiling caves in even more. Antonio passes out but the firemen arrive and everyone is saved and taken to the hospital. As Antonio lies gravely injured Talia questions Jess on the chain of events. She's confused when she learns that Jess and Nash were in the storage room. Nash gives the nurse a hard time but Jess berates him after Antonio risked his life for him. They wonder what they've done to Antonio, how they can be in love behind Antonio's back.\n\n\nNora argues with a creditor on the phone and confesses to Renee that she feels like she's worn out her welcome. She's concerned that all she can do is spend time on the phone with all of the agencies and people revolved around everything she's lost in the fire. Matthew misses his stuff and she should be taking care of him, she laments. Renee can't wait to tell her off, starting with the fact that Matthew is a remarkable young man, thanks in part to Nora, who is mother of the year. She needs to both \"suck it up\" and stop being a control freak. She has family who is willing to help out and she needs to let them. Later, when Matthew returns, he and Nora talk about how uncomfortable they are in Asa's home, how they can't make a mess or leave things lying around. They decide to order take out food and eat in the bedroom, even if it makes crumbs.\n\n\nJohn continues to question Michael and Rex and gets nowhere, as Marcie and Adriana wait. Rex asks, hypothetically, what would happen to a person who knew something. That person would want guarantees, he continues. John thinks they're in it together and he and Michael argue; Michael figures that John is just angry that he wasn't the one to kill Spencer. John loses his temper and decides to have Michael locked up. He questions Rex on his willingness to cover for Michael and tells him that all deals are off the table. John definitely knows that something is up and it's only a matter of time before he figures it out, Michael tells Adriana while waiting. He'll figure out that Tommy is really Todd's son. He's concerned about having to lie now everyday for the rest of his life. John's had enough and he decides to lock Rex up as well. They try to tell him that he needs to look the other way on a couple of things but he just wants them to work with him. Michael has nothing to say. John tells Nat that the ball is in their court. Maybe she was right to cover up when she thought that he was the murderer. Marcie gives John a piece of her mind and wonders if he really thinks that Michael committed this act. Spencer took John's father and now he'll take his brother. He will lose his family and he's got to make it right. Nat comforts him. Michael tells Rex that the most important thing is that they need to protect Tommy and that he's safe with Marcie. Maybe they're better off without me, he mutters; if I'm out of the picture. What are you saying? Rex asks. Maybe it's time I confess, Michael says. \n\n\n",
