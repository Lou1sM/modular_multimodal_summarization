Even little Sam was wearing a flowered shirt amidst the coconuts, flowers, and tropical drinks. Starr eagerly asked if Cole would be able to go on vacation with them. \"No Cole,\" Todd responded. He informed them that there would be no vacation. He announced that the family would be moving to Hawaii and that it would be forever. An excited Jack was up for it, but Starr emphatically stated that she would never go. She didn't care for Todd's reasons, which he cited as family and business. Starr thought she'd live with Dorian, but Todd vowed to force her to go. Suddenly, she challenged her dad and asked if it was because of Cole. He told her that it had nothing to do with her boyfriend and that he could have easily gotten rid of him before if that were true. Starr didn't believe him and neither did Blair. She asked if she had a choice and refused to accept that Todd even wanted to go near a beach after his past experience with Tea, long ago. He claimed to be over that and pointed out that he was interested in a newspaper there. Blair found it quite a coincidence that he announced all of this right after Lee Ramsey was sworn in as police commissioner. Todd insisted that his entire family would be going, and he and Jack went upstairs to look at houses on the Internet. \n\n\nAt the diner, Cole and Langston waited for Rex so that they could give him the final payment for Starr's party. Cole apologized for freaking Langston out at the church. He received a call from John, belatedly returning his call. John told him to wait for him. Charlie and Viki arrived for a meal. Charlie still didn't feel like a hero but Viki assured him that she was proud of him. She also told him how special he was to her and that their being together felt right. Charlie told her that he was planning to stay in Llanview and, though he enjoyed waking up to see her every morning, he thought that he should look for his own place. Rex showed up and collected his payment, then stopped to see Viki and Charlie. He made sure that Charlie was feeling okay after his rescue effort and hoped that maybe he had hero potential in his genes too. Gigi walked in after dropping Shane off at a youth activity and was asked to join them. She and Rex appeared uneasy. John made it to the diner after making a phone call about a police sketch, and he and Cole were happy to see each other. John reassured the teen that he would be safe and protected from Ramsey, and that the new police commissioner was being watched. He confided that he was back on the force. Cole told John that everything was fine with him but as he looked over at Langston, John thought otherwise. \n\n\nA furious Nash told Jared off and compared him to his \"bastard father.\" Jess and Nat were upset and took offense as Nash tried to explain that he wanted to buy out Jared's shares of the vineyard. He continued to berate the Buchanans, mostly Asa, pointing out the lack of morality and how people were always treated like crap so that Asa could get what he wanted. He compared Jared and Nat to Asa, pointing out that they were selfish and did what they wanted, while Jess was safe, since she wasn't really related. Jess was disconcerted and couldn't understand what happened to her husband's happier mood from the last time she saw him. She demanded to know what was wrong with him, as Nat asked to speak to Jared in another room. Jess thought it was a terrible time to pick a fight with Buchanan Enterprises in crisis. Nash confided that his deal fell through and while he made another one with an investor who was only interested in the business aspects, Jared had to be removed. Jess reminded Nash that Jared had just risked his own life to save hers and that he was part of the family. He stopped her from speaking when she started to point out how wonderful Jared really was. She assured her husband she believed in him. In the other room, Natalie sung Jared's praises, though he thought that she was wrong about him. He was grateful to be given the chance with the family and the business. She thought she was right about him, especially given the fact that he had been trying to save the business. She thought that he should give up the shares of the vineyard though, for the sake of the family. She empathized with Nash for trying to have something of his own, without the Buchanan name attached. \n\n\nAntonio and Talia tried to get some work done, but it was difficult as they kept stopping to \"play.\" They realized they had an important job, though, as they searched through files trying to find something on Lee. Antonio received a call from John regarding the sketch artist who was helping in the search for leads on who sprung Allison from St. Anne's. \n\n\nA working Markko told Langston about the time he spent with Starr, making a sauce for Cole. He asked her if the person she had to meet with was Cole, but then apologized, realizing that if it were true, she would have said something. \"Right?\" he asked. John invited Cole to a hockey game. Cole told John he didn't have to feel responsible for him, then accepted after John showed annoyance. Both Langston and Cole received an urgent phone call from Starr. They left together and Markko didn't look too happy. Rex told Gigi that he was sure Shane would find his way, being in a new town. \n\n\nJohn headed to Antonio's place, where he learned that Jess had shown up at the Ball looking for Allison and that Nat was looking for Jess before anyone knew that something was wrong. He and Antonio headed for B.E. to question the sisters. \n\n\nJared decided to make it Nash's lucky day and sell his shares because he was busy at B.E., and wanted to do it for the sake of the family. He learned the wine business had made a profit and was happy with that, he revealed. He said that he actually did want to be like Asa in some ways. The guys shook hands. \n\n\nBlair was informed that Todd and Jack had found a great house. She ignored Todd, spoke to someone on the phone, and left. Todd sat with his boys and murmured that he had everything he wanted and was going to hang on to it this time. Cole and Langston showed up and heard about the move. Starr was afraid she'd never see them again. \n\n\nBlair met Viki at the diner and asked for her help. \n\n\nAntonio and John asked to see Jess and Natalie, separately, at Buchanan Enterprises. Antonio made a phone call regarding the police sketches and they were faxed to him. John asked an uneasy Natalie when she had seen Allison. Jess wondered why Antonio wasn't with Nat, and John with her, but a cold Antonio told her he could work without having personal feelings. After treading gently, Antonio asked Jess point blank if she had anything to do with Allison's escape. \n\n\n",
