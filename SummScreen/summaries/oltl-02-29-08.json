When Natalie refused to admit guilt, John demanded the truth from her. Meanwhile, the sketches of the culprits came across the fax in the very next room. The sketches were of two women dressed in nun's attire. The composites were an exact likeness of both Jessica and Natalie. In a nearby room, Antonio asked Jessica if she helped Allison escape from St. Ann's. Jessica lashed out at Antonio, and began reminding him of the tragedy Allison caused her family. Antonio attempted to reason with Jessica. He warned her that there were two witnesses that could possibly identify her-the nun she encountered the night of the break out, and Allison Perkins. Jessica told Antonio that Allison might never wake up and until she did, he had no proof of her involvement. Antonio realized that Jessica didn't want Allison to recover out of fear that she could offer information that would implicate Jessica. Antonio reminded Jessica that Ramsey was the new police commissioner, and Bo couldn't help her. Antonio told Jessica that Ramsey was out for blood. Antonio advised Jessica that she should obtain a lawyer. Unable to reason with Jessica, Antonio angrily warned her that she could possibly face a long sentence at Statesville prison. Jessica accused Antonio of attacking her because he was upset about their breakup. Antonio became enraged. He admitted to not being completely over the breakup, but assured her that he would never use a criminal investigation to seek revenge against her. \n\n\nRamsey stood in Allison's hospital room. As he looked down at an unconscious Allison, Ramsey expressed a strong desire to know what information she could provide. Michael was shocked to find Ramsey in Allison's room. When Michael told Ramsey that Allison might never recover, Ramsey stated, \"There's more than one way to get answers.\" \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian entered the room and overheard Todd attempting to sell his penthouse. Horrified by the Hawaiian d\u00e9cor in her living room, Dorian inquired if Todd intended to stay at La Boulaie indefinitely. However, when Todd informed her that he planned to move his entire family to Hawaii, Dorian became concerned. She pleaded with Todd to stay at La Boulaie, even claiming to enjoy his company. When Todd showed no sign of reconsidering, Dorian demanded to know exactly what was going on. Todd refused to give Dorian any information, and warned her to mind her business. After Todd left, Dorian began watching the videotape of herself reading the secrets at the Go Red Ball. Dorian laughed to herself; she was embarrassed by her actions and stated that she intended to destroy the tape. While watching the tape, Dorian received a call from a contact. The person told Dorian that the Buchanan's were facing a major crisis at BE. Dorian was not pleased to learn Nora was present, and insisted a camera crew meet her over at BE immediately. As Dorian spoke to her contact, she unknowingly fast-forwarded the tape. The tape was frozen on a frame of Nora sprawled over the floor, ravaging through the secrets box at the Go Red Ball. When Dorian realized the damaging information she had uncovered about Nora, she was elated. When Todd entered the room, Dorian frantically placed the tape in her purse and told Todd she had a present for the DA. With the videotape in hand, Dorian headed off to Buchanan Enterprises. \n\n\nBlair met with Viki at the diner. Blair informed Viki of Todd's sudden desire to move the family to Hawaii, then enlisted Viki's help. Viki was stunned by Todd's decision, and asked Blair what would possibly give him such a bizarre idea. Blair told Viki that Todd claimed he was bored managing The Sun, and wanted a challenge. When Viki pressed the issue, Blair admitted her fear that Todd wanted to leave Llanview in an attempt to protect the family from Ramsey-Llanview's new police commissioner. When Viki asked if Ramsey was threatening the family, Blair admitted to not knowing what was going on. Blair pleaded with Viki to speak with Todd to uncover the truth. Viki promised to help. Before leaving to meet with Todd, Viki spoke with Nash at the diner. Viki and Nash discussed Jessica's state of mind, as a result of her encounter with Allison. Nash promised Viki he would protect Jessica and never allow her to be placed in danger again. When Nash abruptly ended their conversation to meet with a stranger, Viki appeared concerned. Nash approached the business investor and told him that Jared agreed to sell out. The investor was happy to hear the news and gave Nash the contract that required Jared's signature. Meanwhile, Cris was in the diner speaking with Sarah over the phone. Cris wanted to know when he would be able to see Sarah, who was at Buchanan Enterprises with the entire family, attempting to thwart a hostile takeover of the company. Sadly, Sarah informed Cris that she didn't think they would be able to spend the evening together because things looked bleak for the Buchanans. Sarah abruptly told Cris goodbye, after she heard Clint arguing with some of Asa's enemies over the phone. After hanging up with Sarah, Cris was disappointed. \n\n\nIn the Buchanan Enterprise boardroom, Bo entered the room in time to hear Clint threatening an associate of Virgil Webster,  Asa's old friend who was believed to be the center of the sabotage of BE. Nora was also present. Both Nora and Bo realized Clint was having a difficult time handling the family crisis. When Lindsay arrived to bring Bo his cell phone, Nora grimaced. Sensing a problem, Lindsay questioned Bo if everything was okay. Bo gave Lindsay a hug, but was vague about the crisis. Lindsay decided to stay and provide any help she could, which didn't sit well with Nora. When Jared entered the room and provided Clint with relevant information, Clint was horrified by the findings. Clint stated there was trouble and wanted to know Natalie's whereabouts-she was in possession of vital information. In an attempt to protect Natalie, Jared offered to locate the necessary information. Clint stormed out of the room. While Jared looked for the information that Natalie was supposed to provide, he shared a conversation with Sarah. Sarah asked Jared how serious the company's problems were. Jared warned the situation was dire. Sarah was surprised to learn sabotage was involved. Jared explained that Asa's enemies began surfacing right after his death, and planned to destroy Buchanan Enterprises. Jared advised that the family needed to take action immediately to prevent the takeover. When Sarah stated the Buchanans must stick together, a look of guilt crossed Jared's face. \n\n\nAn angry Clint returned to the boardroom. Nora attempted to calm him down and suggested he consider cutting his losses. Clint was shocked by Nora's attitude, and stated he would never give up. Highly upset, Clint wondered why Natalie and Jessica were nowhere to be found at such a critical time. Clint ordered Jared to find the paperwork Natalie was in possession of. Meanwhile, John continued to confront Natalie about Allison's escape. When Natalie adamantly denied any wrongdoing, John became enraged. As John shouted at Natalie to stop her lies, Jared entered the room. Jared demanded that John end his interrogation of Natalie, and questioned how he could treat someone he claimed to have once loved, in such a manner. John showed no fear and told Jared to mind his business. When Jared threatened to throw John out of the office, Natalie calmed him down and explained that John would never hurt her. Natalie supplied him with the information Clint neded, and convinced an angry Jared to leave them alone. \n\n\nCris arrived at BE to surprise Sarah. The two began kissing in front of the fax machine that contained the sketches of Jessica and Natalie dressed as nuns. As Cris and Sarah embraced, they bumped into the fax machine, and the sketches fell to the floor. Cris and Sarah never noticed, and ran off into another room to continue their rendezvous. \n\n\nNash arrived at BE and presented Jared with the release papers. They were only a few feet away from the sketches that Sarah and Cris had dropped. As Jared signed the contract, Nash appeared skeptical. Jared noticed the sketches on the floor. Jared showed the sketches to Nash, and exclaimed, \"The nuns that broke Allison out of St. Ann's were Jessica and Natalie.\" While Nash watched, Jared used his computer skills to totally change the appearances of the two women in the sketches. When he finished, the caricatures, looked nothing like Jessica or Natalie. Jared convinced Nash to go along with his plan. John offered to help Natalie, but she refused his help. John promised to run interference for Natalie, if she told him the truth. Meanwhile, Jessica's accusations angered Antonio. He received a call advising him that the sketches were faxed. Antonio was upset that he wasn't notified sooner, and walked toward the fax machine. Jessica nervously followed. Antonio encountered an empty fax and wondered what happened to the sketches. Jessica offered to help, but Antonio stated he could recover the sketch in the machine's memory. As John continued to plead with Natalie, Antonio and Jessica entered the room. As John and Antonio privately looked over the sketches, Jessica and Natalie were panic-stricken. John and Antonio revealed the sketches to the sisters. Jessica and Natalie were stunned and relieved. Natalie and Jessica declared that as long as Allison remained unconscious, they could never be implicated. Before entering Allison's hospital room, Nash placed the actual sketches in his pocket. Nash stood over Allison's apparently lifeless body. As he removed his scarf and moved closer to Allison, he stated, \"You will never hurt Jessica or her family ever again.\" Suddenly, Allison opened her eyes. \n\n\nUnable to contribute to the discussion, Lindsay left the boardroom and began speaking with Sarah. Sarah mentioned to an unaware Lindsay just how serious the problem was. When Sarah told Lindsay the culprit was named Virgil Webster, Lindsay appeared interested. Meanwhile, Bo, Clint, and Nora discovered pertinent information. Nora advised Clint and Bo that a legal precedent existed that may save BE from bankruptcy. As the group discussed strategy, Dorian barged into the room with a photographer. When Clint and Bo removed the photographer from the premises, Dorian approached Nora and demanded that Nora meet Dorian in the hall. When Nora refused, Dorian stated, \"If you don't, you will live to regret it. \n\n\nViki visited Todd at La Boulaie. Viki demanded answers from Todd. When Viki suggested Todd was afraid, Todd appeared bothered. \n\n\nRamsey approached Blair at the diner. Ramsey implied Todd and Blair were afraid of him. He told her that Todd had been very lucky so far. Blair asked if Ramsey were making a threat. \n\n\n",
