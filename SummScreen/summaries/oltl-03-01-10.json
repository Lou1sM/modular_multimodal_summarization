    "soap_central": "\nFirst Love, Last Love\n\n\n \nAt the maximum-security prison, the guard informed Mitch that Roxanne Balsom had returned for a visit.  Mitch was pleasantly surprised when he spotted Allison Perkins sporting a blonde wig.   Thrilled to see her, Mitch exclaimed, \"Nice to see you on your feet again, Allison!  You've always been my most loyal subject!\"    With a devilish smile, Allison replied, \"It's nice to be at your service again, Messenger!  All I want to do is fulfill your mission!  I have news for you!\"\n\n\nWhen Mitch questioned her about Jessica's condition, Allison appeared nervous, but Mitch warned her not to lie to him.   Allison regretfully related that Jessica had lost all recent memory.  Mitch was disturbed to learn that Jessica had no memories of him.    To Mitch's surprise, Allison informed him that her visit didn't relate to Jessica; her news involved Dorian -- a Cramer woman was dead.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian panicked when Andrew entered the house and informed her that he had bad news.  Convinced that something terrible had happened to Cassie, Dorian screamed, \"What happened to her?  Did Mitch Laurence hurt her?\"   Blair, Kelly, Adriana, and Starr were horrified.  While the Cramer girls watched Dorian lose control, they were all shocked when Cassie entered the room and announced that she was fine.   Relieved to see her daughter, a hysterical Dorian hugged Cassie.\n\n\nAfterward, Dorian questioned why Andrew had made such a frightening statement.  In a serious tone, Cassie stated, \"I have some bad news! There's been a death!\"   A terrified Dorian asked if Langston was dead.  Dorian's jaw dropped when Cassie replied, \"No, it's your sister!\"   Assuming that Addie had died, a horrified Dorian watched as Blair and Starr comforted one another.  Cassie told everyone that Addie was fine, but Melinda had died the previous night.  As Kelly stared in disbelief, Cassie related that the clinic had phoned Kelly to tell her the news because they had been unable to contact her.\n\n\nRelieved that Addie was fine, Starr and Blair discussed Melinda's death.  When Starr commented that she felt terrible for Kelly and Dorian, Blair wondered where Langston was at that very moment.   Starr placed several calls to Langston but received her voicemail.  Unable to contact Langston, Starr hoped her friend was all right, but Blair insisted that Langston was fine.   Starr wondered if her mother had any information regarding Langston.  Directing Starr's attention to their grieving family members, Blair advised, \"We don't need to upset Dorian today.  What she needs now are all the Cramer girls by her side.\"\n\n\nAt Ford's apartment, Langston pulled away from him, and stated that she wished that she hadn't walked out on Markko to be with Ford.  Remembering Dorian's reunion party, Langston insisted that she should be with her mother.   Referring to her as a little girl, Ford suggested that Langston explore her wild side.  A confident Ford told Langston that she wanted to make love to him, but Langston denied having feelings for him.  Langston listened as Ford stated that she was missing out on life in an attempt to remain with Markko.  Declaring that Langston was living a boring existence with Markko, Ford advised her to get out of her comfort zone.\n\n\nFord mentioned that Langston had an adventurous spirit trapped inside her, and questioned if Langston had abandonment issues.  Reliving her parents' deaths, Langston wondered if Ford was right.  Langston recalled the period in which she lived completely alone and how Dorian had saved her from a life of loneliness.  After learning the story of her parents' deaths, Ford told her that she couldn't live in her safe existence forever.   As Langston questioned her feelings, Ford warned, \"If you go, you'll always wonder what we could've had!\"  Langston responded by giving Ford a passionate kiss.   A shirtless Ford removed Langston's blouse and gently placed her on the bed.\n\n\nAfter they made love, Langston's phone rang and she wondered if it was Markko.  Retrieving her phone, Langston was horrified when she read Starr's text message, informing her that Melinda had passed away.  As she quickly dressed, Ford stopped her and pleaded with her not to feel guilty about their intimate encounter.  Once a frazzled Langston rushed out the door, Ford laughed devilishly to himself.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Andrew and Cassie consoled a grieving Kelly.  Once Andrew left to make funeral arrangements, Dorian listened as Cassie explained that Melinda had suffered a massive coronary.  Cassie's announcement left Dorian stunned.\n\n\nNoticing her mother's demeanor, Adriana pulled Dorian to the side.   Pointing out that she had kept abreast of Melinda's health records, Dorian informed Adriana that Melinda didn't have a heart condition and that she had been in perfect health.  Terrified, Adriana asked, \"So what are you saying?  What do you think happened to her?\"\n\n\nKelly blamed herself for putting off several visits to her mother, but Dorian assured Kelly that Melinda loved her.  In tears, Kelly stated that she couldn't recall the last time that she had told her mother that she loved her.  Hugging her niece, Dorian exclaimed, \"She loved you the same way I love all my girls!\"\n\n\nLater, Langston entered La Boulaie and rushed into Dorian's arms.   As Dorian embraced her, Langston cried, \"I'm so sorry about your sister!  I should've been here!\"\n\n\nAs a grief-stricken Kelly sat alone on the couch, Blair approached, but Kelly stood up and walked away.  Displaying a genuine concern for her cousin, Blair approached again.  Citing her own experiences with Addie, Blair assured Kelly that she had done right by her mother.  Kelly responded by hugging her cousin.\n\n\nBack at the maximum-security prison, Mitch was delighted to learn of Melinda's death.   When Mitch questioned how she had died, Allison displayed a devilish smile and remarked, \"Natural causes, of course!\"  Mitch replied, \"This will send Dorian a message!  God is always watching and he'll act if someone crosses me!\"   Mitch informed Allison that he had another task for her to complete.  Allison promised to do his bidding once again.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Brody spotted Roxy pouring liquor in her coffee.  Joining her in the booth, Brody related that he was worried about Jessica.  Pouring some liquor in Brody's cup, Roxy stated that Jessica was lucky to have no memories of Mitch.  Realizing that Brody was troubled because Jessica didn't remember their life together, Roxy told him that Jessica would one day remember the love they shared.\n\n\nInside Jessica's hospital room, Cristian pulled away after Jessica gave him a passionate kiss.  When a confused Cristian questioned what was going on, Jessica related that she had lost all memories after her senior year of high school.  Mentioning Brody's claims that she and Brody were romantically involved, Jessica told Cristian that she only remembered being in love with Cristian.\n\n\nAs they discussed the past, Cristian showed compassion for her, and Jessica stated that he always knew the right thing to say to her.    Reliving the past, Jessica reminded Cristian that he would always refer to her as the love of his life.    Cristian informed Jessica that things had changed since their high school years, but Jessica pleaded, \"But that doesn't mean that things have to change!  Don't you still love me?\"  When Jessica asked why they had ended their relationship, Jessica was stunned to learn that she had cheated on Cristian, and was adamant that they would still be together if she hadn't.    \n\n\nJessica was convinced that Cristian hated her for her betrayal, but Cristian informed her that they were good friends.     A curious Jessica asked if Cristian was single.   When he informed her that he was romantically involved with someone, Jessica appeared hopeful when Cristian admitted that the relationship was new.   However, when Cristian declared his love for Layla, Jessica became emotional.   Apologizing for cheating on him years before, Jessica was certain that they would still be a couple if she hadn't strayed.   Jessica stated that she never imagined being with anyone other than Cristian.\n\n\nStating that first loves never lasted, Cristian reminded Jessica of the wonderful life she would one day remember, and wished her the best.  As he gave her an innocent kiss on the cheek, Jessica closed her eyes and appeared to want more from him.  Once Cristian had left, Jessica mumbled, \"I love you, Cris!\"\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Layla interrupted Brody and Roxy's conversation, and inquired about Jessica.   Layla was surprised to learn that Jessica had asked Cristian to visit her at the hospital.   Upon learning that Jessica had no memories past high school, a curious Layla wondered if Jessica believed that she was still in love with Cristian.  Out of concern for Brody, Layla assured him that Jessica would regain her memory and fall in love with him all over again.\n\n\nA cocky Ford entered the caf\u00e9 and demanded that Markko serve him at once.  When Markko remarked that Ford would have to wait his turn, Ford gloated, \"I just had a killer workout!  I'm starving!\"\n\n\nWhen Cristian met Layla at the caf\u00e9, he informed her that Jessica had lost her memory and believed that they were still a couple.  Layla wondered how Cristian had handled the confusing situation.   Cristian stated that he had told Jessica that he had a girlfriend that he loved.  Cristian was confident that Jessica had taken the news well.\n\n\nAs Jessica slept, Brody entered her room and noticed a notebook nearby.  Brody was shocked to read the words, \"Mrs. Jessica Vega.\"\n\n\nWhen Hannah arrived at Cole's apartment to work on their school project, she was surprised to learn that he had a child.    Curious about Cole's life with Starr and their child, Hannah questioned Cole about his domestic life, and wondered if he felt that he was missing out on the college experience.  As he walked away to check on Hope, Cole remarked that he loved the life that he shared with Starr and their daughter.\n\n\nLater, Hannah mentioned that she had once looked forward to a life similar to Cole's.   Hannah told Cole about the ex-boyfriend that had left her once she left town to attend college.  Cole recalled how terrible he had felt when he and Starr were apart, but Hannah was adamant that the breakup with her boyfriend was the best thing that had ever happened to her.   Hannah remarked how she enjoyed a life of freedom.\n\n\nAs Hannah updated Cole on her college experiences, Cole received an urgent call from Starr.  Upon learning that Melinda had died, Cole offered to pack up Hope and head over to La Boulaie, but Starr was concerned about the sick child infecting anyone else with her cold.  Starr thanked Cole for his concern, and advised him to stay at home with Hope.  Hannah listened as Cole told Starr that he loved her.  Afterward, Hope continued to cry as they tried to study.   When Hannah made a comment about the noise, Cole stated that he was happy with his life and child.   Gathering her belongings, Hannah suggested their next study session take place inside her dorm room, since her roommate was never there.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Andrew returned and inquired about Dorian's state of mind.  Dorian warned, \"Mitch was behind Melinda's death, and we all have to be on guard!\"\n\n\nAt the maximum-security prison, Mitch stood in his cell and murmured, \"I'm not through with you Llanview! My work is not done!\"\n\n\nAs a drunken Roxy exited the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, she expressed her hatred for Mitch Laurence.  As Roxy stumbled away, she didn't notice Allison Perkins trailing her.\n\n\n",
