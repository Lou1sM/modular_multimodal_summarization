While Rex was certain that the baby would be okay, Gigi wasn't so sure. In the meantime, she asked him to help her with a plan for a memorial service for Stacy. Rex volunteered to pick up a change of clothes for Gigi who refused to leave the hospital.\n\n\nSchuyler appeared so he could check up on Sierra, and Gigi was curious as to why he was there suddenly, especially after all of his months of denial. Schuyler explained that he had wanted to stay out of Gigi's way.\n\n\nKim arrived at the hospital with Clint; she was nervous to visit Sierra with everyone else hovering around the infant. She was afraid of what people might say to her regarding the chain of events that led to the baby's hospitalization. Clint was more than happy to provide her with the \"moral support\" that she desperately needed and advised her that she had as much right to see the baby as anyone did. He added that she shouldn't allow anyone to give her a hard time.\n\n\nJessica announced her determination to win Cristian back as a dismayed Viki tried to explain that the couple had dated many years previously and both of them had moved on. Jessica described how she was unable to make connections to people in the present and she was living day to day as if in a dream. She told her mother that she and Cristian had kissed and, seeing Viki's look of horror, she quickly defended him. She explained that it was she who had made the move but she was sure that Cristian had felt something for her.\n\n\nGreg stopped by to check on Jessica and she asked him to release her. Viki attempted to explain to her daughter that her emotional recovery was as important as her physical recovery. Greg informed the women that he and Marty had been working on a plan, and they needed time to figure out exactly how to help Jessica.\n\n\nClint and Viki met with Greg outside of Jessica's room. Viki expressed how happy she was that Greg and Marty were pursuing Jessica's condition, but she was upset over her daughter's behavior. Jessica was acting like a teenager and seemed to be getting worse. She appeared to be going after a time that was safe in her life. Viki was sure that it was not a new personality, as Jessica had been integrated. Inside her room, Jessica fixed her hair and applied some makeup.\n\n\nA grinning Ford informed his roommate that he had slept well the previous night and he wanted Cristian to press him for details. Cristian wasn't interested but that didn't stop Ford from providing the particulars. He had \"finally gotten that girl into bed,\" Ford proclaimed. He had almost given up, but, as it turned out, he had given her a \"new lease on life,\" he added. Ford was a \"great humanitarian,\" Cristian scoffed. He asked Ford if it had been merely another conquest.\n\n\nCristian explained his own situation with Jessica and how she thought they were dating as if they were still in high school. Ford's immediate thought was to ask if Jessica was \"hot\" and Cristian was annoyed. He emphasized that he was not interested in Jessica and thought it was rather weird to think about being kissed by a high school girl. Ford was more interested in the kiss.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, the saddened Cramers did their best to provide emotional support for Kelly after the loss of her mother. Kelly wondered how her mother's heart could have given out so suddenly, and Dorian agreed that they had never been told anything about Melinda having any type of heart condition. Kelly was sorry that her mother hadn't gotten to really know her grandchild, Zane.\n\n\nLangston relived her clandestine meeting with Ford and looked longingly at her phone. Blair watched her curiously. Adriana announced that she had something to take care of and left. Dorian put her own coat on, and advised her girls that she had something to do that would honor Melinda. She warned Blair to be good. When the doorbell rang shortly after, Kelly was shocked to see Kevin standing on the other side of the door.\n\n\nKevin explained that both he and Zane had missed Kelly, and his reason for visiting Llanview was Kelly. He handed her a bunch of old photos of her mother that he had found. After Kevin left to visit his family, Kelly looked through the photos and cried.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the maximum-security prison to visit Mitch. \"May she rest in peace,\" Mitch declared. \"May you rot in hell,\" Brody replied. Mitch made it known that he had been waiting for Brody's visit and thought that they needed to talk since they both cared for Jessica. Brody was thrilled that Jessica couldn't remember Mitch, and it was worth it to him even if Jessica had forgotten Brody as well. Mitch had an offer to put on the table for Brody; he explained that he would be able to get Jessica's missing years back. He had prayed for help and he was sure that he could undo his daughter's memory loss.\n\n\nBrody advised Mitch that he couldn't possibly love his daughter if he had stolen everything from her that she cared about. Mitch wanted Brody to get him out of jail and he would see to it that Jessica returned to Brody. He pleaded with Brody to give him the chance to help Jessica. Brody turned to leave and bumped into Dorian in the outer room.\n\n\nHe blamed her for all that had happened because of her move of setting Mitch free. Dorian attempted to explain that she had not had a choice. He angrily told her that she didn't care what happened to anyone else's family but her own. He thought that he and John could have protected Dorian's family from Mitch. Dorian calmly told him that her sister was dead. Brody stormed out of the prison.\n\n\nDorian headed back to see Mitch, who extended his sympathy over Melinda's death. \"How did you kill my sister, you monster?\" Dorian demanded to know. Mitch reminded her that Melinda had died from a heart attack, and he insisted that he had threatened Dorian's daughters, not her sister. \"There's a difference,\" he told her. Dorian accused him of going after her sister and wanted to know \"Are we even?\" Mitch declared that he \"might leave them alone. Then again, I might not.\"\n\n\nRex arrived at his loft and was shocked to find Adriana waiting there for him. She pointed out that the door had been unlocked, and he remembered the last time he had been there. It had been the night of Stacy's false labor. Adriana wanted to know how he was, and made it known that she was up-to-date on all of his trials and tribulations. She was surprised that Rex and Gigi had broken up and she asked how the baby was. Rex stunned Adriana when he disclosed that the baby wasn't his. Taken aback, Adriana asked him if he and Gigi would be getting back together.\n\n\nThe pair agreed that they weren't losers, though it seemed that way. Suddenly, Adriana pulled Rex into a deep kiss. After the kiss, Adriana realized that Rex still loved Gigi, and she was sorry that he was going through hell. Rex filled her in on the details of Stacy and the baby and how he had been keeping Gigi company at the hospital. Adriana thought that Rex was a good person who had been taken advantage of.\n\n\nLangston's behavior puzzled Blair and she called the girl on it. She wanted to know why Langston was so intrigued with the phone. Langston attempted to cover up by mentioning a phone call from Starr, but Blair asked her if she had spent time with Ford. \"You didn't, did you?\" Blair asked her. Langston broke down and admitted that she had slept with Ford and was remorseful it had happened. Blair gave the young woman a hug as Langston lamented the fact that she had cheated on Markko who was nothing but \"good, kind, and decent.\" She loved Markko and couldn't believe that Ford hadn't even expressed sympathy over the death of Dorian's sister.\n\n\nBlair's advice was that Langston needed to get over Ford as quickly as possible. As if on cue, Langston's phone began to ring. It was Ford, and he wanted Langston to know that he missed her. He wanted to see her, and he invited her to visit him; he noted that Cristian would be leaving and they'd have the place to themselves. Blair attempted to coach Langston in what to say and finally urged her to hang up. Langston thought it was best for her to visit Ford so she could tell him in person that what had happened between them could never happen again. Blair didn't want her to use that as an excuse to see Ford and stressed that she needed to end the relationship over the phone.\n\n\nFord was pretty confident that Langston would be visiting.\n\n\nBlair advised Langston that she understood \"bad boys\" but felt certain that they would break hearts every time. She disclosed that she had conducted an experiment at Capricorn with Ford and had kissed him passionately. She was convinced that he had liked it and wanted more. Langston didn't believe her so Blair decided that she would perform another test. Entering Ford's number into her own phone, Blair placed a call to him.\n\n\nFord answered and, when he heard that it was Blair, thought that her call was about Langston. Blair assured him it wasn't but was rather about the \"intimate moment\" they had shared previously. She admitted that she had been thinking about him and she wanted him to visit to put her out of her misery.\n\n\nBlair changed her clothes and put on an attractive and sparkling evening dress. Langston was sure that Ford wouldn't notice or even show up at the house. Blair was sorry that Langston had to learn the \"hard way.\" Suddenly, the doorbell sounded.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor arrived to give an update on Sierra. He explained to Gigi and Schuyler that the baby had taken a turn for the better, but he wasn't sure that her heart would continue working on its own. The infant's premature birth was working against her, he added. The doctor left and urged Schuyler to stop by the accounting office to provide his insurance information. Gigi knew that Schuyler didn't have insurance but Schuyler vowed to figure out how to provide for his daughter's care. Gigi promised to help out.\n\n\nGreg encountered the couple and, after asking about the baby, advised Schuyler that he wanted answers on the missing oxytocin. He noted that Schuyler had missed a meeting of the Ethics Committee and there was another one scheduled. He ordered Schuyler to be present. Gigi was confused and pressed Schuyler for the facts. \"They think I stole it and they're right. I did,\" Schuyler informed her. At that point, Kim was lurking nearby and continued to listen to the conversation.\n\n\nSchuyler explained that he had forged another doctor's signature because Kim and Stacy wouldn't leave him alone. They had threatened him, and he thought it would be better for him to get the drug than for the women to administer the drug on their own. Gigi stared at him in disbelief as she realized that it was his fault that the baby had been born early and was in the state that she was. She refused to listen to Schuyler as she ranted and raved at him.\n\n\nHe finally managed to speak and reminded her of the day he had been on his way to see her at the cabin. There had been a turning point that day, he declared. He saw how far he had fallen in his attempts to keep Gigi and realized he couldn't go on with it. He insisted that he had not given Stacy the drug. He wanted Gigi to believe him and love him. Gigi reminded him that she had loved him before, but she had learned that it was based on lots of lies. She didn't know how she could believe in him again.\n\n\nSchuyler insisted that he hadn't seen Stacy right before her real labor and there was no way he could have administered the drug from the time he actually did see her. Gigi advised him that she had no idea how it all worked. She knew nothing, she stated, as she walked away. Schuyler spotted Kim nearby and realized she had heard the conversation. He was angry at her for not interceding and defending him. He wanted her to see the baby and told her that she was one of the only people who could help him with Gigi.\n\n\nKevin paid a visit to Jessica with his parents, and her behavior baffled him. Jessica didn't know that Kelly had a baby, she told them. She asked if Joey was the father. She wasn't aware that Kevin lived in London either. She was happy when she was called to take some tests, because she knew that she'd be released from the hospital soon. Kevin and Clint decided to get some coffee. Kevin was interested in hearing about the stripper his father was living with who was young enough to be Clint's daughter.\n\n\nBrody returned to Jessica's empty room and sadly picked up her book where she had been practicing her signature with Cristian's last name.\n\n\nRex returned to the hospital with some fresh clothing for Gigi who advised him she had made a promise to Sierra. She would never let Schuyler near the baby again.\n\n\nJessica arrived at Cristian's apartment and smiled happily when Cristian, fresh out of the shower, answered the door.\n\n\nKim returned to Rex's apartment and cried, \"Oh God Stacy, what have I done to you?\" She sank to the floor and looked at the pictures of the two of them. \"Oh God, I wish you were here,\" she cried. \"Your wish is my command,\" she heard Stacy say. She turned around and a smiling Stacy was standing there. She was wearing Kim's left-behind boots.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica is still living her senior year in high school in love with Cristian. Mitch tries to \"tempt\" Brody by telling him that he has the power to restore Jessica's memory so that she remembers Brody if he uses his Navy SEAL training to spring Mitch out of jail. But Brody resists the temptation. Dorian and the family get ready for Melinda's funeral. Gigi finds out for the first time that Schuyler stole the Oxytocin and at least \"considered\" using it to induce Stacy's labor in order to pass of the baby as Rex's. And it could have killed both Stacy and her baby. Adriana appears out of nowhere and indicates she might want Rex back assuming that he's broken up with Gigi. Blair tells Langston she wants her to see Ford for the creep he is. Blair calls Ford to see if he will take the bait with her so that she can show Langston that he'd sleep with Blair or any other attractive woman who offers herself to him.",
