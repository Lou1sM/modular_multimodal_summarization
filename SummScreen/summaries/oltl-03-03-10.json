Kim apologized for letting Stacy down, but Stacy said that Kim could make it up to her by being Sierra's mother.\n\n\nStacy couldn't understand why Kim wasn't with Sierra, but Kim explained that the baby was at the hospital after undergoing an operation.  Kim didn't think she could be a good mother, but Stacy explained that she had thought the same thing.  Once Sierra was born, something clicked and Stacy knew what she needed to do to be a good mother.  Stacy was sure the same thing would happen for Kim.\n\n\nAll Kim wanted was her best friend back, but Stacy said that she would always be there for Kim and so would Sierra Rose.  Kim agreed to do everything she could to keep her word to the best friend she ever had, and she would fulfill her promise to become Sierra's legal guardian.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rex explained to Gigi that Schuyler had confessed to stealing the drugs, but he swore he hadn't administered them to Stacy and caused her premature labor.  Rex believed Schuyler's story, and he didn't think it was that far-fetched to think Kim and Stacy had been behind the entire situation.  Rex understood that Gigi hated Schuyler, though.  Schuyler had done quite a number on Gigi in the past, but he was Sierra's father.  Gigi knew Rex was right, but she still didn't like it.\n\n\nRex told Gigi he had a bag of things for her, and Gigi was thrilled to see two dolls at the bottom of the bag of things he had delivered to her.  They were Gigi and Stacy's dolls from when they were younger, and the dolls had been named Sierra and Rose.\n\n\nGigi became emotional as she reminisced about younger days with Stacy.  She told Rex that the few hours of bonding between her and Stacy certainly hadn't made up for all the bad things her sister had done to her throughout the years, but she was determined to make sure Sierra Rose knew the good side of Stacy. Later, Gigi visited baby Sierra and showed her the dolls Stacy and Gigi had played with when they were younger.  When the baby was healthy and released from the hospital, the dolls would be hers.  Gigi told Rex that she wanted to become baby Sierra's legal guardian.  Rex said the first step would be to get a lawyer.\n\n\nIn another corridor of the hospital, Kevin and Clint talked about the younger woman Clint had living with him.  Kevin asked if they were sleeping together, but Clint wasn't about to reveal any information about that relationship.  Besides, Clint knew his wife had been having an affair with his brother.  Kevin was shocked that Clint knew the deep secret.\n\n\nClint changed the subject and wanted to know what was going on between Kelly and Kevin.  He couldn't understand why Kevin stayed with Kelly.  It couldn't be because of Zane, because the child was already in secondary school and a separation couldn't be too drastic for him.  Kevin decided to leave the hospital, but Clint remained while more tests were being run.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the church, Todd ran into Kelly. He handed her a check, but when Kelly turned around, he realized his error.  Kelly couldn't figure out what her cousin had ever seen in Todd.  She was grateful something made her cousin reach her senses, though.  That comment made Todd realize what a \"bitch\" Kelly was, and he promptly told her so.\n\n\nTodd and Kelly sat in the church and talked about their relationships and their past.  Kevin and Kelly were still together, raising Zane, and Kevin had forgiven Kelly.  Zane had pulled them back together, it had seemed.\n\n\nTodd made excuses for his past and said he was his father's son.  Kelly didn't buy that excuse and said Todd's father was evil.  He had tried to steal his own grandchild.  Kelly thought things could work out if Todd and T\u00e9a worked together, but Todd said that ship had sailed.  Todd and T\u00e9a were over, and nothing would put them back together.  Kelly told Todd that if he wanted to prove to his daughter that he really was a good person, he would really have to become a good person.\n\n\nLater, after Todd had left, Kelly and Kevin reunited.  To Kelly's surprise, Kevin asked her to marry him.\n\n\nClint, however, was still at the hospital when Kim arrived to see baby Sierra.  She looked in on the baby from the glass windows into the nursery and promised the child she would take care of her.  It wasn't hard for Kim to track down Clint, but she was surprised to see he had a gift for her.  Kim thanked him, but she needed something else from him.  Kim wanted Clint to marry her.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Blair told Langston that Ford was a dog.  Although Blair tried to set Ford up, her plan got sidetracked when Eli showed up.  Blair kissed Eli and took him into the living room to talk.  Langston decided she was going to leave, but as soon as she opened the door, Ford greeted her.  Ford said he was there to see Blair, but then he changed his story and said he was really there for Langston.  She became confused, so Ford used the situation against the young girl and told her he was tired of playing the high school games.  He stormed off, but it didn't take long for Langston to run after him.\n\n\nFord had played his cards well, so he was expecting Langston when she arrived at his apartment.  His shirt was unbuttoned when he opened the door, and he demanded to know what she was doing.  Langston apologized for Blair and the set-up, but she promised to make it up to him.  Langston threw herself at Ford and started kissing him.\n\n\nBlair had no idea what was going on with Langston and Ford while she concentrated on her conversation with Eli.  Blair explained she had worn the sexy dress to set Ford up, because she wanted Langston to know what a scumbag Ford was.  During their conversation, Eli revealed that he had not been sleeping with anyone else besides Blair, and that information impressed her.  They decided not to let the good dress go to waste, so they wanted to see exactly what it looked like on the floor.\n\n\nJessica left the hospital and arrived at Cristian's apartment.  She was thrilled to see him answer the door in nothing but a towel.  Cristian was less than pleased and wanted to know how she had found his apartment.\n\n\nJessica was impressed with the bigger place that Cristian was living in, and she told him that it seemed like just the other day when they were planning on making love after the prom.  That was a long time before, though, and Cristian revealed that he had a live-in girlfriend, Layla.  That information deeply upset Jessica, and she doubled over in pain.  Cristian tried to tell her all the wonderful things about her life, specifically her child.  Jessica wasn't interested in hearing it, though.  She said that all she did was sit at home with a kid.  Jessica wanted to finish the life that she had started.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Marty was trying to convince Brody to lessen the pressure on Jessica.  Brody was determined to get his life back with Jessica, though.  They were going to raise Jessica's daughter and have their own children together.  Marty warned him that he needed to back off.  The life he had with Jessica was gone.  She didn't think it would be best if he was there when Jessica arrived back at the hospital.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Brody was still there when Jessica and Cristian returned to the hospital.  Cristian explained that Jessica had arrived at his door, so he had taken her back to seek treatment.  Marty told Jessica she wanted to help the young girl, but Jessica said that Marty wouldn't be able to help her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marty advises Brody to back off Jessica and not try to make her remember him. Jessica goes to see Cristian and tells him she wants to get back what they had. She says she understands that for him it was a long time ago but explains that for her, it was yesterday. She has a tantrum when he tells her that he lives with Layla. Gigi decides that she wants to raise her niece because Stacy would want her to do it. Stacy's apparition visits Kim and asks her to raise Sierra Rose. Kim finally goes to see the baby in the hospital and decides to keep her promise to Stacy. Clint buys Kim an expensive pair of boots to replace the ones she left for Stacy. Kim says she cannot accept the boots but asks Clint to marry her instead. Todd goes to the church to make a million dollar donation and runs into Kelly. Kelly wonders what he is trying to make up for. He tells her about Dani and that he wants her to see the good in him. Kelly advises him that big donations will not make him a good person. Later, Kevin finds Kelly in the church and asks her to marry him.",
