Natalie was anxious about Rex's less than legal investigation technique, but Rex told her not to worry and picked the lock on the storage room door with ease. The Balsoms were dismayed to discover mountains of discs of hospital surveillance footage, but before they could begin sorting through them, none other than Officer Fish confronted them. \n\n\nRecognizing Fish from his tryst with Stacy, Rex asked Fish what he was doing back in town. Fish explained that the Cherryvale police force had let him go due to cutbacks, and was on the hospital security detail. Having caught the siblings red-handed, Fish demanded to know what they were doing in the storage room. Natalie quickly bluffed her way out of the situation, claiming they'd been lost and that the door had been wide open. \n\n\nFish bought their story and escorted them out, forcing Rex, as soon as the young security guard left their sight, to resort to Plan B: pulling the fire alarm. As the hospital cleared out, Rex and Natalie dashed back into the empty storage room, located the time-stamped surveillance disc, and loaded it into the computer. They were able to see Bess enter the hospital from the east wing carrying a baby. Natalie was under the assumption that the woman was Tess and the baby the live Chloe. When Rex loaded the second disc from the evening into the computer, they got a clearer look at \"Tess\" exiting. Noticing the glasses, Natalie realized they were staring at Bess, and wondered aloud what had drawn the second alter out and sent her to the hospital that night. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Gigi ran smack into Stacy, who was grinning like a Cheshire Cat. When Gigi confronted Stacy about her job application, Stacy covered. Skeptical, Gigi sat Stacy down and got her a new application, making sure to stay and watch as Stacy filled it out and turned it in. Playing innocent, Stacy asked Gigi if she'd done something wrong. She asked if Gigi was angry at her for some reason, like Rex and Stacy's \"Pilates workout.\" Gigi told her sister that she knew Gigi had nothing to fear from Stacy regarding Rex or anything else, and insisted nothing was wrong. \n\n\nWhile Gigi exited, Cristian entered, looking for Carlotta; instead, he found Layla at a nearby booth, greeting him with a frosty glare. Cristian tried to make nice, but Layla wasn't having it, and called him \"the biggest jackass on the planet.\" Cristian admitted he'd made a terrible mistake trusting Vanessa, and said he felt horrible about how he'd treated Sarah. Layla said she and Sarah had thought Cris was one of the good guys, but she'd learned he was like all the rest: Vincent, Rex, and even Fish, who she didn't mention by name. As Stacy's ears perked up from across the room at the word \"Rex,\" Cristian asked Layla for Sarah's phone number so he could call his ex and make amends. Disgusted, Layla gave Cristian the number, and Cris rushed off to a private corner to make his call. \n\n\nSeizing the opportunity, Stacy sidled up to Layla, making small talk about Layla's handbag. She quickly introduced herself as Gigi's sister and said she wanted to get as much background as she could about Rex Balsom, in order to protect her family. Layla was hesitant to open up to a Morasco, but eager to dish the dirt on the man who'd broken Adriana's heart. As Layla laid out the sordid tale of Rex, Gigi, and Adriana, she warned Stacy that Rex had been quite the \"player\" before settling down, first with Adriana, then with Gigi. She told Stacy that the next time a pretty young thing crossed his path, Rex would jump on her, too. \"Once a cheat, always a cheat,\" Layla sighed. Stacy took her newfound information in with great glee. \n\n\nAt a corner booth, Cristian dialed Sarah's number. When Sarah picked up, Cristian begged her not to hang up, and hastily made his apologies. He told Sarah she had been right about Vanessa, and said he was sorry for how he'd treated her. Cris admitted that he'd made a big mistake, and that she deserved better. Before Cris could get any further, Sarah hung up on him. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica returned home to find Viki feeding Chloe in the kitchen. Jessica thanked her mother for taking good care of her daughter, and said she appreciated Viki's support throughout her homecoming and the conflict with Natalie. Viki reassured Jess that things would get better, and Jessica said she felt that she and Natalie already were making headway. She told Viki that she still missed Nash every morning, and her pain was still fresh, but things were finally beginning to look up. \n\n\nAs Jessica took Chloe upstairs for a bath, Viki answered the door to find Gigi, anxious for a \"Paris, Texas, coffee talk.\" Gigi confessed that she had a problem: Stacy. As Gigi explained the circumstances of her sister's arrival in town, Viki said she could relate to sibling issues, having dealt with Tina and Todd for years. Viki asked Gigi what exactly the problem was with Stacy, and Gigi admitted that she felt threatened by Stacy's familiar behavior and intimacy towards Rex. \"I don't trust my own sister,\" she blurted out. Viki said that she couldn't trust Tina, either, which was why she'd cut her out of her life. Yet she still cared about Tina, and worried about her. Viki told Gigi to simply trust in Rex's love for her, and watch her back around Stacy. \n\n\nAfter Gigi left, Jessica returned with Chloe. Jessica delighted in her growing rapport with her \"daughter,\" but Viki said she wasn't at all surprised: \"Babies know their mothers.\" \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Lola, Langston, and Starr reacted with horror as Dorian felled Ray with a vase. Dorian was irritated that everyone was angry with her; after all, Ray was the dangerous criminal. As Ray came to, he explained that he was not a criminal, and complimented Dorian's style. \"Your taste in weapons is amazing,\" he mumbled. \"Austrian crystal!\" \n\n\nAs Langston castigated Dorian, Ray defended the good doctor's maternal impulse; he knew she had no reason to trust him after his previous actions. Ray told Dorian he'd been cleared of all charges in his wife's murder and was a free man. Turning to Lola and Langston, he told them that he intended to stay in the States with Lola to raise her in America. Overjoyed, the girls hugged Ray, then dashed upstairs to dress for the March Mixer. \n\n\nAlone at last, Dorian and Ray began a verbal sparring match. Dorian was reluctant to believe Ray's claims of innocence, but Ray proposed a truce for the sake of the family; he would apologize for his scheme with Clint, if she would apologize for hiring a hit man to kill him. Dorian sputtered with outrage and fervent denials, but Ray persevered and suggested they simply pretend to believe each other's apologies for the sake of peace. He promised not to hold it against her that she'd almost killed him. \"And that would've been such a shame,\" Dorian scowled. \"I would've regretted it,\" Ray deadpanned. \n\n\nAs Ray gave \"Dr. Lord\" his mea culpa, she corrected him and said it was \"Dr. Buchanan;\" she was married to Clint's nephew, David. Ray was disappointed to hear that Dorian was a married woman, and said any man would be saddened to learn that such a strong female was unattainable. Dorian rebuffed Ray's charms, but Ray remained drawn to her. \n\n\nIn Blair's bedroom, Blair was doing her makeup as John walked in and confronted her with the latest issue of the Intruder, complete with the cover story about Marty, which Blair had been interviewed for. John demanded to know why Blair had done such a petty thing to hurt Marty's case, and if she was really that insecure. Blair said she truly believed Marty had killed Wes, and that she was prepared to fight for John's heart any way she could. John asked if she thought putting Marty behind bars would get Marty out of the way, but Blair said it was more than that. She said that the scheming, dangerous side of Blair was \"the real me,\" and that John needed to get used to it. \n\n\nBlair told him that he'd been the one that had changed when Marty came back, and accused John of being unwilling to admit that he'd simply been marking time with her, waiting for Marty to return to him. John said that wasn't true, and Blair asked what the truth was. \"This,\" John replied, sweeping her into his arms for a passionate kiss. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Marty was shocked to discover Cole's stash of pills, and found herself speechless when Cole walked in. Cole glowered at his mother, and asked what she was doing in his room, going through his things. Marty wanted to know what Cole was doing with dangerous pharmaceuticals, and warned him that the drugs could kill him. Marty asked Cole how long he'd been using, and Cole said there had been many triggers: the end of his relationship with Starr, the loss of his child, but most of all, Marty's abandonment of him. \n\n\nCole unloaded on Marty, screaming that she'd shut him out and turned to a stranger when he'd needed her most. Marty said she wanted to help him, but Cole was unreceptive: \"Take your fake mother act and go straight to hell.\" \n\n\nMarty said she knew she hadn't been the mother he needed when she'd returned from captivity, but she wanted to be there for him. Cole scoffed and said she was only there because Wes was dead. He asked if she'd killed him; Marty was taken aback that he'd believe she was capable of murder. Cole said he didn't know what Marty was capable of, since \"you're not my mother.\" He said he didn't know the woman who stood before him, raising hell all over town with a vendetta against Todd and no time for her son, ignoring Cole even when he tried to visit her in prison. \n\n\nPleading with him, Marty told Cole she didn't know who she'd been, but she knew who she wanted to be; she wanted to be his mother, to try to re-forge their bond, to make a connection any way they could. Begging, Marty told Cole, \"I want my son back.\" Past the point of listening, Cole demanded his pills back. When Marty refused to hand them over, he stormed out. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston and Lola persuaded a reluctant Starr to come to the March Mixer with them by suggesting Cole might show up, as well. As the teens got decked out in fancy dress, Lola admired Starr's \"Hope necklace,\" and told her she was sure she would meet the one she wanted at the dance. Starr just toyed with her necklace, full of melancholy. \n\n\nUpstairs, Blair and John sank onto her bed in a passionate embrace. As things got hot and heavy, John's cell phone suddenly rang. Blair snatched it up, and saw the call was from Marty. Informing John, she left it up to him: \"You choose, her or me.\" \n\n\n",
