Dani was not happy when Todd walked in, but shortly after, T\u00e9a arrived. The principal informed them that a math teacher's desk had been broken into and test answers had been stolen. Dani had been seen leaving the classroom shortly before the break-in. Dani insisted that it wasn't her doing and refused to allow the principal to search her things. Speaking as an attorney, T\u00e9a seconded her daughter's refusal and advised the principal that he would need a search warrant.\n\n\nThe principal announced that he had no choice but to suspend Dani. Todd quickly gave his permission for Dani's things to be examined. He added that he trusted his daughter, and she was a smart and good person. T\u00e9a agreed but admitted that she also knew Dani. Just then Matthew walked into the room and confessed that he had been the one to steal the test answers.\n\n\nDorian sent for Bo and Nora and they turned up at La Boulaie where Dorian waited for them with John by her side. She assured Bo that Llanview needed him and so did she. She wanted him to take back his job of police commissioner. She also wondered why Nora was there and not at work. Nora quickly advised Dorian that she was indeed working and handed Dorian a list of charges that Nora had drawn up against the mayor. \"Read it and weep,\" the district attorney called out.\n\n\nDorian was perturbed and wondered if that was the thanks she got from Bo. Nora hastily explained that it was all her responsibility, and perhaps Dorian should give her a reason not to pursue it. Mitch threatened her girls, Dorian protested. Bo thought that he would have been able to provide protection if Dorian had only seen him about it. Nora decided to overlook the charges because she didn't really want to implicate Charlie; she cited the fact that Dorian had used the man after he had lost his son. Dorian muttered that her sister had been murdered, but poor Charlie, he lost Jared. \"Dorian, don't look a gift horse in the mouth,\" Bo ordered.\n\n\nNora received a phone call and learned there was a problem at school. She and Bo had to leave. \"What about the charges?\" Dorian called out. \"What charges?\" Nora answered. \"What about the job?\" Dorian called out again. \"I'll take it,\" Bo yelled.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Marty ran into Natalie and suggested that they have a talk. Natalie was reluctant since they had already chatted, but Marty informed her that she knew about the second kiss that Natalie and John had shared because John had told her everything. Marty knew that the second kiss had nothing to do with Jared, and Natalie had known what she was doing. She wanted to know why Natalie had lied about it.\n\n\nNatalie assured Marty that she hadn't lied; she just hadn't volunteered the information. Marty accused Natalie of hiding it because Natalie and John had a history. She understood why it happened, though, she offered. She knew that Natalie and John had been scared and it just happened. She had thought about it and knew it wouldn't happen again. She and John had talked about it, and he said the kiss didn't mean anything, Marty continued. She wondered if it meant something to Natalie, though, and if Natalie had feelings for John.\n\n\nNatalie conceded that she and John had spoken to each other also. She knew it had been a mistake. Marty stressed that she just didn't want to see Natalie getting hurt. Marty rose and had to catch herself. She felt dizzy but chalked it up to a missed meal. She went off to get a glass of water. John arrived looking for Marty and was concerned that she had been feeling ill. He knew she had a habit of not eating, though, and he didn't seem too concerned. Natalie asked him if he had told Marty it was a mistake when he kissed Natalie. He admitted that they had spoken about it. It didn't mean it was a mistake about their feelings, he emphasized.\n\n\nMarty returned with a glass of water. She found some aspirin to take and she was feeling better. Natalie headed to Jessica's room while John asked Marty to have dinner with him. He thought they should work on the two of them. Natalie stood hidden and listened to the couple as they spoke quietly to each other. Marty received a package delivery as she spoke with John. She opened it and peeked into the bag to look at a pregnancy test kit.\n\n\nKim asked Clint to marry her as he presented her with a new pair of boots to replace the pair she left behind for Stacy. \"They're nice but they're not that nice,\" Clint retorted. \"I'm serious,\" Kim replied. Clint asked why she was in a hurry, and Kim explained that she needed help. She and Stacy had no one but each other, and she had promised Stacy that she would take care of Sierra Rose.\n\n\nClint pressed for more information and the facts as Kim saw them spilled out. She didn't think that Gigi could support two children on the salary she made as a waitress, plus Stacy hated Gigi. Schuyler was a recovering addict who was fired from his previous job, and the baby was probably in the hospital because of Schuyler. Kim was the only one left for the baby, she concluded. She added that girls like herself and Stacy didn't have families. Clint wondered what any of it had to do with him.\n\n\nKim tried to explain that there was no way she'd get custody of Sierra as Kim Andrews, but she would have no problem if she were married to Clint. He asked about her dreams and wondered if she just wanted a ring. Kim denied his charge, noting that all of his friends from Texas had asked for her phone number. She'd be with one of them if that were all she wanted, she snapped. She didn't want to ruin their good times but she thought that if she married him, she'd be able to hold her head high. Clint asked what he would get from this \"marriage of convenience.\" He would have her, Kim laughed.\n\n\nClint understood Kim's feelings perfectly, as well as the commitment that she made to Stacy. She had herself a deal. He would marry her. She had helped him keep his sanity. Besides, he joked, Asa had been married 14 times and Clint needed to catch up.\n\n\n\"Will you marry me?\" Kevin asked a shocked Kelly at the church. He hastily explained that he never should have let her go, and they had already enjoyed a life together taking care of Zane. Kelly reminded him that they had also divorced for a good reason. \"Have you forgiven me fully?\" Kelly asked him.\n\n\nKevin remarked that they had shared their life, even if it wasn't in the bedroom. They had raised Zane together. Kelly noted that moving on and forgiving were not the same thing. She cried as she reminded him that she had slept with his son. She was grateful that Kevin had helped with the parenting. They spoke of a time when Kelly had kissed Kevin, but she acknowledged that it had been a \"moment,\" one of many. \"Let's build on that,\" Kevin implored her. She refused but admitted that she would always love him.\n\n\n\"So you love me but you can't marry me,\" Kevin clarified. Kelly sadly explained that he couldn't make things better for her right then because her mother had died. Kevin suggested that they talk about it at a later date but Kelly turned him down. She didn't think they could hide behind Zane forever. They had made many mistakes and they needed to see what they really wanted. Kevin insisted he wanted Kelly. She assured him she would always be Zane's mother and he would always be the boy's father in almost every way. Kevin was embarrassed that he had made a mistake, but Kelly thought he was sweet and she would never forget his proposal.\n\n\nKevin thought that Kelly knew him better than he knew himself. He said he'd see her later at the funeral. They bowed their heads together and shared a tender moment. Dorian arrived and comforted Kelly. She advised her niece that Kelly had a beautiful future ahead of her. \"I hope so,\" Kelly replied solemnly as she wiped her tears with Todd's handkerchief.\n\n\nCharlie stopped at Llanfair to retrieve some of his belongings and ran into Viki unexpectedly. He had hoped she would be visiting Jessica at the hospital. They made small talk about the family, though Viki was aloof. She advised Charlie that she didn't know if any of them would ever recover from all that had happened. She gave Charlie the details of Jessica's memory loss.\n\n\nCharlie assured Viki that he wasn't going anywhere and she hadn't lost him. He was in recovery and would stand by her if she'd allow him to. He loved her and thought she might need him. He was trying to find his way again and wanted her to give him one more chance. \"I can't,\" Viki replied. She had tried to help him but he had shut her out and turned to Dorian, she explained. Charlie pointed out that Dorian was only \"the means to the end,\" but Viki didn't want to hear it. She was horrified that he would have used Jared's memory to commit murder.\n\n\nShe had every right to want to murder Mitch, as well, Viki continued, but she didn't try. She explained all that Mitch had done to Jessica before Brody had rescued her. Jessica already had the personality disorder and she was hanging on to her safe teen years. Charlie apologized and admitted that he had made a mistake. He had made a bad choice but wanted to make it up to her. Viki cried that she couldn't afford to give him another chance. She wanted a divorce. Charlie packed a suitcase and left Llanfair.\n\n\nBo and Nora arrived at the high school and heard about Matthew's confession. Bo wanted the proof while Nora promised that Matthew's confession was inadmissible since he didn't have a parent present. She grilled her son on his actions and wasn't convinced that he was telling the truth. \"I think this is a load of crap,\" Bo exclaimed as Todd got his digs in at Matthew. Suddenly, Dani spoke up. She admitted that Matthew was covering for her, and she had the stolen answers.\n\n\nT\u00e9a couldn't understand her daughter's actions. The principal announced that Dani was expelled. Todd defended his daughter and explained that she had been through hell lately. He told the principal of all that had gone on with Ross and said Dani had then learned about Todd. He was the one to blame for all that Dani went through at school with other students making fun of her because of Todd. He understood why Dani was upset and breaking rules, but they needed to support the children. He thought that a check for one million dollars to the school would be a fine way to cancel the discipline.\n\n\nThe principal was appalled and demanded to know if Todd was bribing him. Todd explained that he was a \"practicing philanthropologist\" and the principal could call St. James to check. He had just donated a large sum to them as well. The principal accepted the check and, before he could say anything further to Dani, Todd ordered him to go. Dani and T\u00e9a could only look on in disbelief. T\u00e9a wasn't too thrilled about the way Todd had handled the expulsion. She immediately grounded her daughter. \"Whatever,\" Dani said sullenly.\n\n\nTodd was annoyed that Dani had spoken to her mother so gruffly. T\u00e9a didn't deserve it, he admonished Dani. It was Todd's turn to be pleasantly surprised when Dani thanked him for standing up for her.\n\n\nNora wanted to know if her son wanted to go to college after making such a noble gesture that would go into his records. Bo thought it was a foolish gesture. Matthew advised them that he would go to college if Dani did. \n\n\n",
