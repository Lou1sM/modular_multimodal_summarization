Bo brings up that Cole shot Miles. Nora insists that it was an accident. Bo knows that John covered for Cole, and thinks Cole needs some close attention. Matthew arrives and asks if they're fighting. Bo doesn't want Matthew to suffer if Cole makes any more mistakes. Nora reminds Bo that Cole is in grief counseling. Then she wonders why he hasn't called in yet. She assures them she'll ask John to help keep Cole on the right path. Bo compliments Nora as a mother, then in the same breath wonders if she doesn't have too much on her plate.

Nora leaves with Matthew. \n\n\nLindsay arrives at Buchanan Enterprises and hands Clint a folder. He wonders where she got it. Clint is amazed at the information she brought him; if even a fraction of it is true, they can destroy Webster. He again wonders how she got the information. Lindsay has connections with Sam's former clients. Clint says he won't stoop to blackmail. He wants to know why Lindsay gave him the information. She wants to help Bo, but he would never use that kind of information. Lindsay says Bo holds himself and everyone else to a high moral standard, while Clint is more like Asa. He would do whatever he needed to do to save the company. Clint says he won't use the information-no matter how you spin it, it's blackmail. Lindsay just wants to help Bo keep the company. Bo arrives and Lindsay hides. Bo, laughing, asks who Clint was talking to. Bo compares his corporate skills to Clint's. The brothers are glad to be working with each other. Bo asks for the \"unexpected news on Webster,\" reaching for the folder. Clint says the information isn't relevant and tells Bo not to waste his time. Bo leaves because Lindsay's going to be wondering where he is. Lindsay comes out and says she thought Clint was going to tell Bo the truth.

Clint reminds Lindsay that he's not going to use the information. \n\n\nAntonio, Talia, and John are going over case folders looking for dirt on Lee. They agree that someone's covering Lee's tracks. Antonio is frustrated because they don't know what Lee is hiding. John, also frustrated, says they'll keep looking until they do. He says if they don't, people will end up dead. \"You mean Marty?\" asks Talia. There's a pained silence. Talia asks if what happened to Marty is affecting John's judgment. John says his feelings about Lee are for good reason. John says Lee has someone watching his back and that's why they can't find any information on him. Talia apologizes for being insensitive about Marty and offers John a drink. John catches Antonio checking out Talia's curves as she walks away, so he declines the drink and leaves. Talia asks Antonio why John left in such a hurry. They kiss, and then Carlotta arrives with a very sleepy Jamie. Jamie missed Antonio and Talia, especially Talia. Talia puts Jamie to bed. Carlotta tells Antonio that Jamie is very attached to Talia, and wonders how it will affect Jamie if Talia disappears, just like Jessica did. \n\n\nLangston runs into the parlor at La Boulaie, hysterical.

It's Nora, wondering if he knows where Cole is. She asks if John has time to chat about Cole, so he offers to come over. John arrives at the Buchanan Estate. Neither he nor Nora has heard from Cole yet. Nora relates her conversation with Bo. John says he thinks Cole is handling the loss of his mother, but it's hard to tell. John says Cole is lucky to have Nora. Cole feels like he's part of the family. John says he'd do anything for Cole; he owes Marty that. Cole sneaks in the front door, obviously hurt. Matthew sees him and shouts for Nora. Nora and John see him and are shocked at his bloody face. They help Cole to the sofa. Cole refuses to tell them what happened.

Once around the corner, she leans up against the wall. \"I hate lying to that kid,\" she moans. Todd arrives home at La Boulaie and rudely tells Markko to leave. Markko leaves, clearly worried about Langston. Todd asks if Langston knows what she did to her friend tonight. Todd is especially rude to Langston, making her cry, and Dorian tells him if he doesn't behave, she will call the police and have Todd kicked out of the house. Todd says it's Langston's fault that Starr is hurt. Langston is shocked: how could Starr be hurt? Just then, Blair and Starr arrive. Todd says he's going to call the police so Starr can make a statement. Blair yells at him that he's not going to have Cole arrested. Todd insists that Cole raped Starr, even though Blair and Starr keep shouting that nothing happened. Starr yells at her father that she loves Cole and she wanted to sleep with him. Todd raises his hand to strike Starr and she runs upstairs. Blair watches Todd in absolute horror. Starr and Langston, upstairs fill each other in, tearfully, on what happened at Langston's house. Langston tells Starr how Todd figured out where she and Cole were. Blair tells Todd that if he ever raises a hand to Starr again, he will never see any of his kids again. Todd says he knew Cole was trouble and now he's attacked Starr. Todd insists again that Starr was raped. Blair tells Todd he needs to face reality. Todd says if Cole goes near Starr again, he's going to kill him. There's pounding at the door. Todd opens the door to see a furious John.
