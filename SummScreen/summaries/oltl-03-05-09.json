Declaring that he did not want to leave things tense between them, he refused to move. She denied that she was tense, but stated that she merely didn't want anything to do with him. A booming voice interceded and Moe reminded Dorian that it was his house and that she was the one who was trespassing. \n\n\nFinding it funny, Dorian thanked Moe for housesitting. An irritated Moe jogged Dorian's memory, whipping out the papers she had signed, the ones that stated she was turning the house over to him. It was merely a ruse for David's benefit, she advised him. Ignoring Dorian, Ray and Moe began to bond over Moe's favorite topic of food. Dorian threw a fit, ripping and stamping on the papers in the process, and calling Moe a hick. \n\n\nAngrily, Moe pointed out that he was talking to a guest in his home. Dorian apologized for calling Moe a hick. Moe invited Ray, along with Lola, to stay in his house while they were in town, much to Dorian's displeasure. \n\n\nUpstairs in Blair's bedroom, as John's cell phone continued to ring, Blair gave him a choice when she saw that it was Marty calling. \"You choose, her or me.\" Ignoring the phone, grabbing Blair and kissing her passionately, John's choice was apparent. When the ringing began again, Blair answered soundlessly and cut Marty off quickly when she began to speak. \"John's busy,\" Blair abruptly told her. \n\n\nMarty hung up before John grabbed the phone from Blair's hand. Feeling that while he and Blair were important, Marty must have been upset if she felt the need to call back, John dressed and prepared to leave. An amazed and furious Blair told him not to return. \n\n\nAn amused Nora and Bo waited while Matthew made preparations to attend his school dance. Bo was pretty sure that Matthew was trying to impress a girl, which had led to his previous problems. He assured Nora that he and his son had a good talk. Sending Matthew to military school was out, since it was obvious that Bo had made mistakes in his life, too. Bo wondered aloud how David might have turned out if Bo had been in his life. \n\n\nA surprised Marty opened the bedroom door to find John standing outside of it. He mentioned that Nigel had let him in. The disarray of Cole's room shocked John, and he was further surprised when Marty presented him with the bag of pills and the letter from school. John expressed the thought that there was still hope for Cole, even as Marty explained that they had fought. Cole blamed her for everything and she was distraught, not knowing where he might have gone. She was petrified that his extreme anger would cause him to do something he'd regret. John had an idea. \n\n\nFinally, Matthew was ready for the dance and asked his parents to drop him off a block before the school. He posed his dad a question, wondering if it was okay if he asked someone to dance if she had attended the dance with a date. \"All's fair in love and war,\" Bo told him. Nora snapped a picture of the loving father and son. \n\n\nLola, Langston, and Starr arrived at the dance, but Starr's constant lookout for Cole put a damper on things. She was miserable and didn't really want to be there. Spying Schuyler on chaperone duty, she headed in his direction. Mentioning Cole's anger at her regarding Schuyler's confrontation with Cole, the teacher disclosed that he knew that Cole was high without anyone having to tell him. He felt that Cole was in denial of being an addict and the young man would have to be honest with himself before he was able to get any help. \n\n\nAs the dance continued, Langston spoke of Markko's choice to remain in Llanview for college. Markko stood firm in his belief that he was doing it for them and would do anything for Langston. Looking over to a sulking Lola, Langston asked him to dance with her cousin as a favor to her. Starr sent Cole a text message but heard nothing in response. \n\n\nArriving at the dance, Matthew found Becca, but a rude Justin pulled her aside and they walked away. Matthew's new friend was happy to see him and suggested he find someone to like him for who he was. Langston wondered what Starr was talking to Mr. J about, finding it difficult to believe their conversation was about the science project. She thought that her friend should start dating others to make Cole jealous. Starr didn't like the idea and, looking around, didn't see anyone that she was remotely interested in. Then her eyes lighted on Schuyler. Lola asked Markko to take her to a water fountain and, once out in the hallway, she pulled him into a kiss. \n\n\nMarkko, horrified, demanded to know what Lola was doing. She immediately apologized and, since it was a mistake, they agreed to keep it from Langston. Justin approached Asher to score some drugs, but Schuyler interrupted them. He arranged to meet with Asher later. Starr, needing some air, headed out to the hallway. Unsuccessful in another attempt to get to Cole via phone, she punched a locker and sat herself down on the floor. \n\n\nAn extremely high Cole found himself at Todd's place and demanded that Todd return everything that Todd took from him. Forcing himself into the house and knocking over furniture, Cole blamed Todd for everything that had happened in his life. Cole accused Todd of ruining his relationship with Starr, not once, but twice. Pointing out that Starr hated him, Todd proclaimed that there was little he could do to help the young man. He denied being responsible for the actions of others. \n\n\nCole accused Todd of pulling the strings with both Starr and his mom, especially with Todd's omission of any mention of Cole in Marty's life. Todd defended his actions where Marty was concerned, claiming that he did what he thought was right. He loved Starr more than anything in the world, he confirmed. He also felt strongly, because he knew her well, that Marty did not kill Wes. His mother was a different person thanks to Todd, Cole pointed out. Todd felt quite the opposite, that he had helped Marty. He ordered Cole to get a life and get out of his house. \n\n\nCole spotted a framed picture of Todd and Marty, which caused him to become even angrier. Taking hold of the picture, he yelled, \"What the hell's this?\" and threw it to the ground, causing it to crack. Calling Todd a sick son of a bitch, he refused to listen to Todd's insistence that he cared for Marty and that he understood how Cole felt regarding Starr. Cole threw Todd against the wall, placing his hands around Todd's throat. Todd accused him of blaming everyone else for his horrible life, and thought they were alike. Cole retorted that he'd rather be dead than be like Todd. \n\n\nCole finally stormed out. Todd called Starr but she refused to answer his call. Schuyler, finding her on the floor, asked to sit with her. She confessed that she felt different from the other kids because of all of the events that had consumed her life, and she no longer fit in. She managed to change the topic of conversation as it related to Schuyler when he was on drugs. The teacher chuckled but didn't want to talk about himself. She explained that he was the only one she was able to talk to, and he understood, realizing that he had made many of the same mistakes. \n\n\nShe continued that she was no longer able to trust Cole and he didn't understand the moves she had made to protect her father. Schuyler again understood how it was to protect a parent, and confided the details of his mother's letter and her involvement with Todd and the baby. He explained that she did it for him because Todd had learned of Schuyler's involvement with drugs and was blackmailing her. In order to protect his mother, Schuyler admitted to burning her letter. Starr realized he did that so that people would remember Dr. Joplin for her goodness. The teacher and student were amazed that they really did understand each other so well. Starr leaned in and kissed Schuyler, just as Cole arrived. \n\n\nMatthew finally made his move and cut in on Becca as she danced with Justin. The boy moved away and made a nasty comment to Matthew's new friend. Langston danced again with Markko. She was happy that her cousin would be sticking around Llanview. Markko was less than thrilled. \n\n\nUnable to reach Starr, Todd called Blair instead. She reminded him of the restraining order and advised him that the old Blair Cramer was back. Todd, under the impression that things were better between them, yelled at her and called her a bitch but she refused to have a change of heart. Blair decided to \"wash John out of her hair\" and climbed into the shower. An unknown person, dressed in black and carrying a knife, made his/her way to the bathroom and attacked Blair. \n\n\nBo and Nora praised each other on their parenting skills. They realized they needed to step back and allow Matthew the chance to grow up on his own. \n\n\nJohn and Marty arrived at Todd's and, getting no response to their knocks on the door, broke in. The first thing John spotted was the cracked frame with the picture of Marty and Todd. Hesitatingly, he showed the item to Marty.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr is alone at the school dance, depressed about what Cole is doing. The only person she seems interested in talking to or being with is her teacher, Mr. J. Cole goes to confront Todd. He is very angry, on edge and under the influence of pills. He later goes to the dance to see Starr and her teacher kissing. This is after Mr. Jo. has revealed to Starr that his mother revealed to him that she was ready to help Todd kidnap Starr's baby because Todd threatened to expose her son's drug addiction. Starr does not judge her teacher for that. Dorian reveals to Moe that she does not intend for him to own her house and he is merely \"housesitting\". He reminds her that he and his wife legally own everything that she has signed over to him. He tells her that he wants for both Lola and Ray Montez to live in his house since Langston wants her family close by. She is infuriated to hear that. Blair is upset that John jumps whenever Marty contacts him. And when Todd calls her to appeal to let her see the kids again, she tells him no way. And while Blair is alone in her room and showering, an unseen person enters and carries a knife.",
