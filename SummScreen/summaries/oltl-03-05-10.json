    "soap_central": "\nAuntie Up\n\n\nIn John's apartment, as John lay alone in bed, he dreamt about making love to Natalie.  Marty stood nearby and watched as a sleeping John tossed and turned in bed.  With a look of concern, Marty clinched a home pregnancy kit in her hand.\n\n\nWhen John awoke, Marty quickly placed the pregnancy test back into a paper bag.  Concealing the kit, Marty stated that she noticed that John appeared restless in his sleep and wondered if he had experienced a bad dream.   After recalling the kiss he had shared with Natalie in his dream, John denied having a bad dream.   In an attempt to change the subject, John asked if Marty was feeling any better.\n\n\nWhen John asked if she had taken any medication to ease the symptoms of her bout with the flu, Marty assured him that she was fine and asked him not to worry.   Noticing the bag of medication that she had discreetly put away, John reached for the package, but Marty pulled the bag out of his grasp.  Making up an excuse, Marty dropped the bag in the trash when John looked away.\n\n\nAs he prepared for work, John suggested that Marty take the day off and rest at his apartment.   Marty agreed, and John promised to return that night.  A troubled Marty mumbled to herself, \"Good, I should be better by then... one way or another!\"\n\n\nOnce John left the apartment, Marty retrieved the pregnancy kit out of the trash bin.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie appeared troubled when she observed an article relating to John in the morning paper.\n\n\nAs Cristian prepared for his first day of teaching at Llanview High School, Layla paid him a visit in his classroom.  Presenting him with a photograph of the two of them, Layla informed Cristian that she had discovered the frame of the photo shattered into several pieces.  Layla was surprised when Cristian informed her that Jessica had damaged their photo.\n\n\nLayla listened as Cristian explained that Jessica had showed up at their apartment and became enraged when she learned that he and Layla were living together.   Concerned for Jessica's well-being, Layla suggested that they hide their relationship from Jessica.  Declaring his love for Layla, Cristian refused to keep their relationship a secret for Jessica's benefit.   Before heading off, Layla joked, \"Watch out for those teen-age crushes!\"  A self-assured Cristian replied, \"Don't worry, I'm spoken for!\"\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Viki and Clint escorted Jessica home from the hospital.   When Jessica noticed a photo of herself and Bree, Jessica grew discouraged about the years she had missed.   However, Jessica was pleasant when Natalie entered the room and welcomed her home.  Viki suggested that Jessica rest, but Jessica asked Natalie to help her get adjusted.   Once Jessica and Natalie left the room, Clint worried about Jessica being lost in her teenage years, but Viki reminded him that Jessica's earlier years contained many happy memories.\n\n\nIn the library, Jessica asked Natalie questions about Jessica's lost years.   Natalie described their family's terrible ordeal with Mitch Laurence and Allison Perkins, but Jessica appeared to have very little interest in the matter.  Stating that she didn't remember any facts relating to Mitch or Allison, Jessica sighed, \"I'm glad I don't remember Mitch!\"  Meanwhile, Allison stood on the terrace and observed the two sisters.\n\n\nJessica noticed the article about John in the paper and questioned Natalie about their breakup.   Admitting that their breakup had been a difficult experience, a sullen Natalie recalled how she later met and fell in love with Jared.  Commenting that she had been shocked to learn that Viki was no longer married to their father, Jessica wondered if Viki and Charlie were happy together.   Meanwhile, Allison continued to spy on the women.\n\n\nAnnouncing that he had an errand to run, Clint suggested that he and Viki get the family together for dinner.   When Clint asked if Viki intended to invite Charlie, Viki informed Clint that she had asked Charlie for a divorce.    Clint expressed concern for Viki's domestic problems.   Thanking Clint for standing by her side, Viki told him that he was her best friend, and Clint related that he felt the same.\n\n\nViki was stunned when Clint informed her that he was marrying Kim.  Citing that he had only recently met Kim, Viki questioned if Clint was making a wise decision.   Relating that Kim was a breath of fresh air, Clint responded, \"I know what Kim is about and I'm going into this with my eyes wide open!   If it's a mistake, I'm going to make sure that no one gets hurt!\"   Afterward, Clint headed off to meet up with Kim.\n\n\nFlipping through the pages of her high school yearbook, Jessica reminisced about her senior year.    Discouraged, Jessica stated that she wished that she could go back in time.   Jessica searched frantically for Cristian's photo.  Smiling at Cristian's image, Jessica told Natalie that Cristian was teaching a class at Llanview High.   Detailing her visit to Cristian's apartment, Jessica admitted that she had flirted shamelessly with him.  Natalie assured Jessica that Cristian wouldn't hold it against her, but Jessica was convinced that Layla might have a problem with Jessica's behavior.\n\n\nNatalie appeared suspicious when Jessica questioned her about Cristian's life, but Viki appeared and interrupted the discussion.   Viki suggested that Jessica get settled in, and Jessica agreed.  Afterward, Jessica stood in the hall and smiled as she stared at Cristian's picture.\n\n\nAlone with Viki, Natalie expressed her concern over Jessica's fixation with Cristian.   Natalie was relieved that she didn't have to tell Jessica that Natalie had once been married to Cristian.  A concerned Viki wondered if Jessica had been troubled by the thought of Mitch and Allison's terrible deeds.  When Natalie revealed that Jessica didn't appear bothered by the mention of the two, Viki declared, \"I think things are going to get a lot worse before they get easier!\"  As Viki turned her attention toward the terrace, Allison hid.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang and Natalie excused herself to answer the door.  Natalie was stunned when she discovered John at the door.  Meanwhile, Viki noticed that the terrace doors were open.  As Viki closed the doors, Allison quietly observed.\n\n\nBack at John's apartment, a troubled Marty held a pregnancy test in her hand.  The test displayed a positive result.\n\n\nCharlie spotted a distressed Brody at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.   When Brody inquired about Charlie's relationship with Viki, Charlie related that Viki had asked him for a divorce, and that he intended to abide by her wishes.  Reminding Charlie of the love that existed between Viki and Charlie, Brody advised Charlie to fight for his wife.  Ignoring Brody's plea, Charlie urged Brody to stand by Jessica.  In a stern voice, Brody replied, \"I'm not giving up on her!\"\n\n\nNearby, Rachel and T\u00e9a reminded Schuyler that the hospital board had scheduled an ethics meeting to address the allegation that he had stolen the labor-inducing drug from the hospital.   As Rachel and T\u00e9a tried to convince Schuyler that he was in desperate need of a lawyer, Schuyler maintained that his only concern was Sierra.  T\u00e9a offered to defend him at the meeting, but Schuyler was determined to go to the hospital and check on the sick child.  While Schuyler maintained that the ethics meeting wouldn't result in criminal charges, T\u00e9a advised him that the hospital board might refer the case to the District Attorney.\n\n\nRealizing that his career was on the line, Schuyler decided to accept T\u00e9a's help.   Convinced that Schuyler could fight the case, T\u00e9a related that the ethics board didn't have any hard evidence, only the testimony of one nurse.  When a nervous Schuyler informed T\u00e9a that Kim was aware that he had stolen the drug, T\u00e9a stated that she wasn't overly concerned about the possible threat of an ex-stripper.   However, the revelation that Schuyler had also admitted his crime to Gigi and Rex caused T\u00e9a to worry.\n\n\nT\u00e9a admitted that their case could be jeopardized if Rex or Gigi had knowledge of the review board hearing.   Expecting Gigi and Rex to make an appearance at the hearing, T\u00e9a advised Schuyler to deny any claim that he had stolen the drug.  Schuyler had reservations about referring to Gigi as a liar.   Reminding Schuyler that she was fighting to keep him out of jail, T\u00e9a informed him that she was in possession of the drug, and as his lawyer, she wasn't obligated to turn over the evidence.  T\u00e9a suggested that Schuyler heed her warning and deny Gigi's allegations.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Rex discovered Gigi waiting for word on Sierra's condition.    Concerned for Sierra's well-being, Gigi told Rex that she wanted to do everything possible to protect the sick child.  To Gigi's surprise, Rex introduced her to Elijah and insisted that he could help her protect Sierra.   After relating that she was Sierra's closest relative and explaining Schuyler's possible role in Sierra's premature birth, Gigi asked Elijah if she stood a chance of winning custody of the child.\n\n\nOnce Elijah had gathered the details of the case, he regretfully informed Gigi that they would need concrete evidence that Schuyler wouldn't be an acceptable father for the child.  Citing that Stacy had named Schuyler as Sierra's guardian and the fact that the courts generally favored the side of the biological parent, Elijah asked if Schuyler had a criminal record.   Gigi listened as Rex gave Elijah a detailed account of Schuyler's checkered past, but when Rex referred to Schuyler as a drug addict, Gigi spoke up and maintained that Schuyler had been clean for years.\n\n\nRealizing that Gigi was having second thoughts, Elijah warned her that a custody case could become vicious.  Elijah advised Gigi to pursue the case only if she could view Schuyler as the enemy.  Pulling Gigi aside, Rex asked if she was willing to hurt Schuyler if it meant that she could gain custody of Sierra.  Conflicted, Gigi stressed that she wanted to raise Sierra, but didn't want to go to war with Schuyler.  As Rex promised to stand by Gigi, Schuyler and T\u00e9a approached.   With a newfound confidence, Gigi told Elijah that she had decided to fight for custody of Sierra.\n\n\nKim arrived at Oliver's apartment with news for both Oliver and Kyle.  The men were shocked when Kim announced that she was marrying Clint, and together they would raise Sierra as a Buchanan.   While Oliver remained silent, an outraged Kyle objected to Kim raising the child.  Reminding Kim that either Oliver or Schuyler had fathered Sierra, Kyle was adamant that the child's biological father should raise her.   Kim referred to Schuyler as a drug addict and denied that Oliver could be Sierra's father, but Kyle was skeptical.  Insisting that Stacy would want her to raise Sierra, Kim threatened to end Kyle's medical career if he interfered in her decision to raise Sierra.\n\n\nOnce Kim left, Kyle tried to convince Oliver that he would make a great father, but Oliver stated that Sierra would be better off with Kim and Clint.  While Oliver argued that he wasn't the child's father, Kyle was convinced that Oliver was Sierra's father.   To Oliver's surprise, Kyle displayed a sealed envelope and stated, \"Let's find out the truth!\"  Oliver was stunned when Kyle informed him that the envelope contained a DNA test.   Kyle related that he has taken a DNA sample from Oliver and compared it to Sierra's DNA.\n\n\nBack at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Brody encountered Clint and inquired about Jessica.  After informing Brody that Jessica was fine, Clint thanked him for giving her space, and offered Brody future support.  Afterward, Clint stepped away to speak with Kim, who sat at a nearby booth.\n\n\nOnce Clint sat down, Kim began to discuss wedding plans, but Clint quickly interrupted her.  To Kim's surprise, Clint declared, \"Before a wedding takes place, there are a few things that we must get straight!'  Kim's jaw dropped when Clint presented her with a prenuptial agreement.\n\n\nNearby, Layla approached Brody and asked about Jessica.  After informing Brody about Jessica's impromptu visit to her apartment, Layla assured Brody that Cristian would never allow Jessica to get the wrong idea about Cristian's feelings for her.\n\n\nAt that moment, Cristian was startled when Jessica entered his classroom and announced that she had registered to take his class.\n\n \n\n\n",
