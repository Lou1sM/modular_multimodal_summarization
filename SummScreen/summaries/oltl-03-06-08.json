    "soap_central": "\n\n\"Touch the kid again and I'll kill you,\" John warned Todd as he threw a punch. The rest of the household members rushed to the front entrance as the men tussled. Todd promised to charge Cole with rape as Starr yelled, \"Dad, are you serious?\" She told her dad that Cole didn't hurt her but that Todd did-he taught her hate. Not getting anywhere with Starr, who ran upstairs, Todd turned to John and threatened him. He also told him that Starr was lying about what happened with Cole. John left but not before he warned Todd about staying away from Cole. Blair tried to convince Todd to let it all go if he had any love for Starr. \n\n\nRex asked Gigi to meet with him at Capricorn. Learning that she was unable to get a job at the diner, he suggested she take a job at Buchanan Enterprises. He knew that Natalie was looking for an administrative assistant. Gigi didn't think it was a good idea, not having used her secretarial skills since high school. Rex played up the perks and convinced her that Shane needed her to have a job with medical insurance. He called Natalie and asked her to meet with them. He introduced Gigi to Cris, Antonio, Sarah, Layla, and Talia. \n\n\nClint learned that Virgil Webster, the man trying to bring his company down, had a less-than-stellar private life. He was tempted but decided against using the information. His thoughts were interrupted by Jared, who was working late. Both men expressed pleasure that Natalie saw fit to rehire Jared. \n\n\nEncountering Charlie in the library, Natalie told him that he was a mystery, much like the books he was reading. She was surprised that they had so much in common, the places they'd been to and the people they knew. She began to bombard him with questions, and asked why he never received any phone calls or mail, not even bills. Even when Viki entered and tried to stop her daughter, Natalie pointed out how unusual it was for her mother to know so little about the man she was dating and letting live in their house. Natalie deemed Charlie charming and thought that he reminded her of someone she already knew. He suggested that maybe it was a Balsom relative. He also pointed out that having been a practicing alcoholic, he had alienated friends and family long ago, hence the reason for no mail or calls. He mentioned that he had already discussed moving out and that he had a Post Office Box for mail. In turn, he admired Natalie for being a \"straight shooter\" and advised her that he would never hurt Viki. Natalie surprised herself by believing him and thought him the most straightforward person she ever met. She just didn't want to see Viki's heart get broken, she told her mom later. Jared arrived to give Natalie some work-related files. First, he told Charlie that he was very happy as a Buchanan. He was sorry for using people and didn't consider himself a good person. He warned Charlie that he hoped Charlie wouldn't lose Viki if their cover were ever broken. Natalie thanked Jared for putting his ass on the line by altering the police sketches of herself and Jessica. It was for family, he told her. \n\n\nA bruised and battered Cole arrived home but refused Nora's suggestion to go to the hospital. He recounted the chain of events. Nora was convinced that he didn't deserve being beaten and told him that John had gone to see Todd because it was John's battle too. To Nora's dismay, an equally bruised John returned to the house and shared that Todd was going to press charges of rape against Cole. Citing the fact that Starr was now 16 years old and that both she and Cole had the same story that their being together was consensual, John and Nora realized that rape charges would not hold. John swore that he would not let Todd screw up Cole's life. \n\n\nLangston apologized to Starr again for divulging her whereabouts to Todd. Starr didn't hold her responsible and made a decision that she didn't want Todd in her life. Todd told Blair that it was his job to protect his family and believed that Cole had a plan all along to exact revenge on him for Todd raping Marty so many years ago. Todd appeared to have snapped and Blair didn't think he was being rational. She tried to explain that Cole and Starr loved each other. He still insisted she was raped, especially since Cole took her to an abandoned house. He wanted to prove what happened and determined that he would take his daughter to the police station. Blair went ballistic and kept yelling at her husband that it was not rape. Starr decided to call Cole to make sure he was okay. He was sorry for what happened. She told him that she would never listen to Todd again and that she wasn't going to Hawaii with the family. Blair knocked on Starr's bedroom door and tried to comfort her daughter. Starr insisted again that nothing happened, and that her father was a mean person with no heart. She stated that he didn't know the difference between love and rape. She thought things would be beautiful with the right person but now she was feeling nothing but regret. She hoped she was not like Todd in any way. Blair tried to explain how their family had been through a lot but Starr began to scream that she would never forgive Todd and she hated him. She kept on screaming, barely coming up for air. In the study, Todd sat in the dark, scaring Langston when she walked into the room. \"You're all gonna pay for what you did to my daughter,\" he muttered. \n\n\nLater, at Capricorn, Natalie listened to Rex as he promoted Gigi's skills for the job. Natalie had gotten into trouble previously, for hiring Jared on her own, so she promised to set up an interview for Gigi through proper channels. She ran into Jared there but abandoned him when John showed up, looking like he had walked into a door. He told her it was someone's fist and she moved quickly to help him. A forlorn Jared left. Layla and Sarah invited Talia to move in with them after hearing about her dumpy apartment. They told her they had a third bedroom, previously used for business, though it was rather small. Talia accepted happily. \n\n\nNora still felt bad about her behavior with the secrets box at the Ball, but she was determined to get the goods on Lindsay. Clint quickly told her that he had forgiven her, especially since he had been married to Lindsay and knew how she could drive someone so crazy. Nora thought that he was extremely generous. She received a phone call and had bad news for Antonio. \n\n\nViki felt like she had to apologize for Natalie's behavior but Charlie understood. He was wondering why Viki herself had never asked him questions, especially being a journalist. She had no answer, but wanted to respect his privacy. She knew they were on a great journey and would get to know each other on their own terms. She figured she already knew all his secrets. Rex took Gigi home and they reminisced about old times, like when Rex accidentally broke her nose. He pointed out that her new nose was great, and that everything about her was great. The moment turned awkward and they quickly said goodbye. \n\n\n",
