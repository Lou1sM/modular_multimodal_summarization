Antonio is starting to get suspicious about Jessica and Nash, but Jess calms the situation for a while by saying that the whole fire thing really freaked her out.

Jessica stops by on her way home from the hospital to drop off her story about Miles. Todd wants her next assignment to be to find out everything she can about Evangeline. Jessica assumes that Todd just wants to get Evangeline in bed, and refuses to take this assignment. She thinks that Todd is the reason Cris and Vange are breaking up, and tells him that Evangeline still loves Cristian. She also says that Todd is wrong for her because he still loves Blair, and that he's too complicated for Evangeline. Todd guesses that Jessica isn't really talking about him at all and thinks something is going on with her. Jessica avoids talking about herself.

Marty tells him that he shouldn't have to buy friends by buying drinks for everyone. Miles doesn't understand the problem, and Marty explains that they're not real friends. He says that he'll take any friends he can get and toasts his and her friendship. Marty tells him that they can't be friends while he's her patient. He then jokingly fires her, and she tells him not to stop therapy. He tries to drink her wine, but she stops him, warning that he shouldn't mix his drinks; otherwise he'll end up sick. He then orders another beer, and Marty warns him about hangovers. He says that can be his new experience for tomorrow. Marty asks Miles why he chose beer. He says that it's so he can enjoy being drunk and thinks being drunk is fun. Marty tells him that beer can pack a big punch, too. Miles is impressed with her alcohol knowledge, and she reminds him that she was quite the party girl in college. Miles tries to get the attention of the bartender to order yet another beer. When he gets his drink, he falls off his barstool, very happy that he is drunk. Marty then helps Miles to his room, and as he enters, he collapses. Marty helps him up and onto the couch. They both fall on it, Miles reaches out and kisses Marty, and he tells her that that was another first for him. Marty is surprised that that was his first kiss.

Vange tells Layla that she and Cris broke up. Layla placates her and tells her that they'll make up, but Evangeline says it's really over. She explains that Cris came to her apartment and found her and Todd saying good-bye, but Cris misinterpreted it as them being together and wouldn't let her explain what he walked in on. Then she tells Layla about what happened between her, Cris, and Todd at the hospital, and how they all kind of blew up at each other. She continues on saying that she went to Todd's and he got her a fancy lunch and a massage. Layla wants to know if Todd sees them as friends. Evangeline felt like Todd was seducing her. She then talks about how Starr showed up at Todd's penthouse and thought that Todd and Evangeline were having sex. Vange says she felt like she was cheating on Cris, and Layla reminds her that she and Cris aren't together anymore. Evangeline's hurt by that comment. Layla tells her not to feel guilty, and Evangeline repeats that she loves Cris, not Todd. Layla reminds her that she tends to have a thing for complicated men, bringing up her relationships with R.J. and John. Evangeline insists she's changed and doesn't want to change Cristian.

After Layla leaves to check up on Nash, Evangeline pulls out her cell to call Cristian, and is sad that he ignored her call.\n\n\nNash ends up at the Palace after leaving the hospital, and orders a scotch and asks to keep them coming. When Layla comes to talk to him, he tells her that he and Jessica realized they were in love when they were trapped together in the fire. He says that it's Jessica he loves, not Tess, and declares that Jess is amazing. He then wants Layla to tell him that he has to avoid Jessica, but he doesn't know if he can do that, or even if he wants to do that.\n\n\nWhen Antonio is done with his tests, Cristian arrives to visit. Cris asks Antonio how Jessica is doing, and he's surprised that Jess and Nash left together. Antonio thinks that Jessica and Nash are spending too much time together, which prompts Cristian to ask if Antonio thinks Jessica and Nash are having an affair. Antonio is shocked that he'd immediately go there, but Cris explains that it's a residual from what happened between him and Evangeline. Antonio wants to know if Cris really thinks that Evangeline is hooking up with Todd, and Cris wants to know what Antonio thinks the deal is between Jess and Nash. Talia then stops by, bringing Antonio a gift and asks for input on what to do for the arson investigation. After getting some advice, she leaves. Once she's gone, Cris says that Talia is a looker, and Antonio is confident in her ability to track down the arsonist. Cris asks Antonio again about Jess and Nash, and Antonio wants to know if Cris knows something that Antonio doesn't. Cris then gets a call from Evangeline, which he ignores because it's over between him and her, and he almost slips about Jessica and Nash's affair. Antonio explains that he knows what Cris is going through, but he'll get over it and move on. Antonio tells him that he trusts Nash, and more importantly, he trusts Jessica. Cristian compares his situation with Evangeline with Antonio and Jessica.\n\n\nOn the tropical island, John accuses David of killing Spencer.

She tells him that she took evidence from the Truman murder crime scene. He angrily asks her why she'd do that. She tells him that she found evidence that would have incriminated John in the murder. Bo wants to know what evidence she took. Nat tells him that she took a couple fibers that looked like they belonged to John's scarf. She explains that she instinctively protected John because she doesn't want to lose him again. He then tells her that the fibers could still be relevant, but she says that she got rid of them. Bo is very disappointed in Natalie and even more disappointed that John helped her cover it up. Nat asks him if he's going to arrest her. He tells her he won't, but that she's no longer in the forensics program. He says she can also keep her desk job, but if the murder goes unsolved, he'll have no choice but to arrest both Nat and John and they'll both face criminal charges. \n\n\n",
