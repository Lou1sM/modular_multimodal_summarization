Suddenly, Roxy barged into the apartment, and Marty did her best to hide the test.   However, Roxy announced that she had noticed the positive pregnancy test result, and remarked, \"You've got a bun in the oven!\"\n\n\nAdmitting that she was pregnant, Marty told Roxy that John wasn't aware of the news, and asked Roxy to keep her secret.  Realizing that Marty intended to keep John in the dark, Roxy questioned if Marty and John were experiencing problems.   Marty stated that she and John had never discussed having a child.    Roxy asked Marty if she believed that John had unresolved feelings about Natalie.\n\n\nWhen John arrived at Llanfair to speak with Jessica, Natalie informed him that Jessica had stepped out, but Natalie invited John inside.   John listened intently as Natalie informed him that she had dreamed about him.  Natalie was surprised when John related that he had experienced a similar dream about her.\n\n\nJohn believed that they shouldn't take their dreams seriously.  With a look of uncertainty, Natalie recalled the kisses they had shared and insisted that it had all been a mistake, and they would never allow it to happen again.   Natalie told John that she was convinced that something special still existed between them.   Admitting that she often thought about escaping into John's arms, Natalie insisted that the timing was off.  Natalie stated that she was still grieving the loss of Jared, and she reminded John that he wanted to be with Marty.   John agreed that he wanted to continue to pursue his relationship with Marty.\n\n\nAfter concurring that they shared unresolved feelings for one another, Natalie asked John if they should avoid each other and ignore their feelings.    Maintaining that dreams didn't have any hidden meaning, John stated that he didn't want to go through life avoiding her.   They agreed to forget about the dreams and shook hands.  After a brief handshake, John and Natalie embraced.  Staring into each other's eyes, John and Natalie shared a passionate kiss.\n\n\nAfterward, Natalie asked John if they had made yet another mistake.  To her surprise John remarked that it wasn't a mistake.  Stating that he didn't want to complicate her life, John insisted that they needed to figure out what was happening between them.   Before leaving, John stated, \"We can't keep going around in circles!\"  A confused Natalie watched as John reluctantly exited the house.\n\n\nBack at John's apartment, Roxy encouraged Marty to tell John about the baby, but Marty maintained that she didn't want to trap John.   Opening the door, Roxy asked Marty if she was considering terminating her pregnancy.  Before Marty could respond, Roxy blurted out, \"Don't get rid of it without telling John!\"  They were both shocked when John appeared and asked the topic of their conversation.  Once Roxy bolted out of the apartment, John asked, \"Is there something you want to tell me?\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Natalie was consumed with romantic thoughts about John.\n\n\nInside Oliver's apartment, Oliver was stunned to learn that Kyle had stolen a DNA sample from Oliver and had compared it to a sample of baby Sierra's DNA.   When Oliver maintained that Sierra didn't deserve to be raised by gay parents, Kyle objected.   Reminding Kyle that he had illegally obtained both DNA samples, Oliver chastised his lover for committing a crime.   Stating that he knew Oliver didn't want another man to raise his child, Kyle insisted that he had conducted the test because he loved Oliver, and wanted them to find out the truth together.   Kyle pleaded with Oliver to open the envelope and learn the truth about Sierra's paternity.  To Kyle's horror, Oliver walked toward the door and announced, \"You're on your own!\"  Kyle watched sadly as Oliver left the apartment.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Rex, Schuyler, and T\u00e9a listened as Gigi announced to Elijah that she intended to seek custody of Sierra.  Schuyler insisted that he loved his daughter and wanted to raise her, but Gigi was convinced that Schuyler was an unfit father and didn't truly love Sierra.  Schuyler refused to give up his daughter.  Gigi suggested that if Schuyler loved Sierra, he would allow Gigi to raise the little girl.   When Schuyler asked to speak to Gigi alone, Rex objected, but Gigi agreed to talk to Schuyler.\n\n\nPulling her aside, Schuyler begged Gigi to consider raising Sierra with him.  Declaring his love for her, Schuyler pleaded with Gigi to give their relationship another chance, but Rex appeared and interrupted the conversation.  Reminding Schuyler of his confession about stealing the drug to induce Stacy's labor, Rex stated that he doubted that Schuyler loved Sierra.  Denying that he had administered the drug to Stacy, Schuyler was adamant that Kim would clear him of the accusation that he had induced Stacy's labor, resulting in Sierra's medical condition.   Upon learning that Kim was Schuyler's alibi, a disgusted Gigi stormed off.    Calling out to her, Schuyler yelled, \"I didn't use the drug!  Kim will vouch for me!\"  While T\u00e9a gave Schuyler a disapproving look, Elijah listened intently to Schuyler's confession.\n\n\nIn an attempt to prevent Schuyler from incriminating himself any further, T\u00e9a reminded him of his appointment.    When a confused Schuyler inadvertently mentioned the scheduled ethics board meeting, Elijah chastised T\u00e9a for trying to keep the meeting a secret, and commented that he was aware that Schuyler had stolen the drug from the hospital.   Upset to learn that Gigi had confided in Elijah, Schuyler asked if Gigi was only seeking custody because she wanted to punish him.\n\n\nAlone with Schuyler, Rex told him that they could fix the entire mess without a long drawn-out custody battle.  Rex stated that he wouldn't inform the ethics board of Schuyler's crime, if Schuyler stepped aside and allowed Gigi and Rex to raise Sierra.   When Schuyler refused, Rex insisted that Schuyler didn't love Sierra.  An irate Schuyler nearly attacked Rex, but Oliver arrived on the scene and prevented Schuyler from striking Rex.\n\n\nOliver listened quietly as Rex maintained that Schuyler was only using Sierra to keep Gigi in his life.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Schuyler approached Gigi in Sierra's hospital room and insisted that he wanted to raise his daughter.   A determined Schuyler declared, \"I don't want to do this, but I'll walk out of here with Sierra.  She's my daughter and she's all I have left!\"  Oliver appeared conflicted as he watched Gigi and Schuyler argue over Sierra's crib.\n\n\nLater, when Elijah asked Gigi if she still wanted to seek custody of the child, Gigi stated that she was unsure.  Shocked, Rex reminded Gigi that Schuyler was manipulating her and was pretending to care for Sierra in an attempt to impress Gigi.  Rex pleaded with her not to fall for Schuyler's lies again.  Affected by Rex's statement, Gigi told Elijah that she had decided to file for custody of Sierra.  Rex promised to stand by her.\n\n\nWhen Oliver returned home, Kyle apologized for betraying him and offered to burn the DNA test.   As Kyle lit a match, Oliver asked him not to do it.\n\n\nInside Cristian's class at Llanview High School, Cristian tried to explain to Jessica that it wasn't a good idea for her to take his class.  With a sly grin, Jessica assured Cristian that he would one day realize that they belonged together.\n\n\nAs Jessica drew hearts on the blackboard, Cristian pulled the principal aside and explained the situation with Jessica.  Cristian informed him that he expected a problem to result from Jessica being enrolled in his class.  Reminding Cristian that Jessica was a Buchanan and recalling the large cash donation that Todd had made to the school, the principal suggested that Cristian accept Jessica as one of his students.\n\n\nA reluctant Cristian entered the classroom and welcomed Jessica to Llanview High School.   With a smile, Jessica replied, \"It's nice to be back, Mr. Vega!\"\n\n\nStarr, Cole, Langston, and Markko enjoyed breakfast at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.  Langston received a sexually charged text message from Ford.  As Langston hid the text message from Markko, she was terrified when Ford entered the caf\u00e9 and announced he wanted to speak to his favorite student.  When Ford engaged in conversation with Markko, Langston quickly excused herself.   After observing Langston's strange behavior, Starr noticed Hannah enter the caf\u00e9 and decided to join Langston.  Before heading off, Starr teased Cole about his sexy sociology partner.\n\n\nFord glanced at Hannah for a moment, but soon turned his attention to Langston, who was waiting outside the caf\u00e9 for Starr.   With a devilish look, Ford watched as Langston walked away.\n\n\nLater, Cole attempted to discuss the school project with Hannah, but noticed that she couldn't keep her eyes off of Ford, who was sitting at a booth with Markko.\n\n\nAs Markko detailed his film project to Ford, Markko noticed that Hannah was fixated on Ford.  When Markko directed Ford's attention on Hannah, Ford grinned.   Markko tried to discuss his film project with Ford, but Ford was preoccupied with sending a text message.  Ford told Markko that there was girl that he just couldn't get off his mind.\n\n\nAt Llanview High School, Langston received a text message from Ford.  Starr interrupted her thoughts and mentioned that Hannah had dropped by their apartment to work with Cole.  When Starr asked if she should be concerned about Hannah, Langston had a flashback of her sexual encounter with Ford.    Starr was convinced that something was bothering her friend.\n\n\nStarr was pleased when she realized that Cristian was her new art teacher.  When Jessica noticed Starr, Jessica approached her cousin and asked, \"Are you a high school senior, too?\"  Starr was stunned to learn that Jessica had no memories beyond high school.  Once class started, one student asked if Jessica was a student teacher and another referred to her as a \"cougar.\"   Upon learning the definition of a \"cougar,\" Jessica informed the class that she had a boyfriend.  As Cristian gave his lecture, Jessica moaned, \"Isn't he a hunk?\"\n\n\nBack at the caf\u00e9, Hannah suggested that Cole find a babysitter so that they could study at his apartment.  Gathering his belongings, Cole informed her that they would hold their next study session at the library.\n\n\nAs Ford continued to send Langston text messages, Hannah grabbed his phone.  Hannah accused him of leading her on and then abruptly ending the relationship.  Retrieving his phone, Ford informed her that he never promised her anything.  As a cocky Ford exited the caf\u00e9, Hannah declared, \"And I never promised that I'd let it go!\"\n\n\nAt a nearby booth, Clint told Kim that he wouldn't marry her unless she signed a prenuptial agreement.  Insisting that she wasn't marrying Clint for his money, Kim maintained that she only wanted to give Sierra a happy home.  Clint related that he was protecting his family' fortune and refused to marry her unless she signed the prenuptial agreement.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marty is stunned to find out that she is pregnant by John. She does not know how to tell him and senses that he is \"incomplete\" about something. And right at the same time, John and Natalie declare that they still have feelings for each other even though they've both \"moved on\" since they were together. Gigi and Rex have Eli represent her while Tea represents Schuyler. They are ready to go to battle to get custody of baby Sierra. Oliver and Kyle realize that Oliver could be the father and Kyle demands that Oliver finds out and tells him that he knows he won't be able to let it go even if he says he can. Jessica goes to the high school to see Cristian while still living as a high school student. Clint tells Kim that he will only marry her if she signs a prenuptial agreement which is obviously the deal breaker for her.",
