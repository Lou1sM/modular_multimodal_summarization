Stacy became annoyed when Rex stated that he wished that Gigi were by his side. When Stacy questioned Rex's love for Gigi, he assured her that Gigi was the love of his life. As the drugs began to have an effect on Rex's state of mind, Stacy told him the sad story about the man who broke her heart. Rex suggested that she move on, but Stacy argued that it was difficult to forget your first love. While Rex continued to chug on the beer, Stacy implied that perhaps Gigi was the wrong girl for Rex. \n\n\nWith Matthew in the passenger seat of his car, Cole fell asleep at the wheel. Meanwhile, Gigi and Shane were driving on the same road. Realizing that the driver had lost control of his vehicle, Gigi tried to swerve and avoid an accident, but she was unsuccessful. Cole's vehicle collided into Gigi's car. \n\n\nWhile Gigi and Shane lost consciousness and were trapped in their vehicle, both Cole and Matthew were ejected from Cole's car. As Cole lay on the ground with his legs trapped under his vehicle, Matthew lay unconscious out of sight. Once Gigi and Shane regained consciousness, Gigi was horrified when Shane began to suffer an asthma attack. \n\n\nNearby, John and Marty discussed Cole's possible whereabouts. Upon hearing the impact of the crash, John and Marty rushed to the scene of the accident. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Blair was rushed into the emergency room. As Dorian attempted to accompany Blair into the ER, Todd tried to join her. Observing Bo nearby, Dorian demanded that the police commissioner arrest Todd for Blair's stabbing. While Dorian headed into the ER, Bo prevented Todd from entering. Bo wanted to know what had taken place at La Boulaie. \n\n\nTodd told Bo and Talia that he had gone to La Boulaie in hopes of convincing Blair to allow him to see his children. Upon entering Blair's bedroom, he observed Dorian trying to revive Blair, who had been stabbed. While Talia continued to interrogate Todd, Bo received a call informing him of the crash. Stating that he needed to check on Shane and Gigi, Bo asked Talia to put pressure on Todd to find out exactly what had happened to Blair. Before leaving, Bo phoned Nora and asked her to pick Matthew up from the dance. \n\n\nTodd continued to deny that he stabbed Blair. Seconds later, Blair was transported from the ER on a gurney. Talia immediately asked a groggy Blair who had stabbed her. Moaning in distress, Blair took one look at Todd and passed out again. As the doctors rushed Blair off to another room in the hospital, Talia advised Todd that he was lucky that Blair lost consciousness before she had the opportunity to identify him as her attacker. \n\n\nTodd refused to accompany Talia to the police station to be questioned. He insisted on remaining at the hospital until he knew that Blair's condition had improved. Talia agreed to allow Todd to give his statement at the hospital. Surprised by Todd's behavior, Talia acknowledged that Todd appeared to truly care about Blair's condition. Filled with emotion, Todd reminded Talia that Blair was the mother of his children. He told Talia that she couldn't understand how he felt seeing Blair lying in a pool of blood. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Dorian observed as a team of doctors treated Blair. Promising to protect her, Dorian pleaded with Blair to pull through. \n\n\nAt the high school, Starr thought about the trouble Cole had caused at the dance. \n\n\nAs Cole lay unconscious on the ground, his cell phone rang. \n\n\nStarr left Cole a voicemail in which she lashed out at him for causing Mr. Joplin trouble. She stated that she no longer cared about what happened to Cole anymore. As Starr ended her call, Mr. Joplin appeared. Reminding her that the school dance was over, Schuyler asked why she hadn't gone home. Racked with guilt, Starr inquired about Schuyler's meeting with the vice principal. Schuyler informed a shocked Starr that his meeting didn't go well. He had been suspended from teaching indefinitely, the board was launching an investigation into his past drug use, and he had been ordered to give an account of every moment he had spent with Starr. Starr regretted causing Schuyler embarrassment, but he blamed himself. \n\n\nAcknowledging that he was her teacher, Schuyler said that he shouldn't have confided in Starr. She insisted that they were friends and that he had every right to divulge his secrets to her. Schuyler stressed that he was her teacher and had to maintain boundaries in regards to their relationship. He stated that the kiss would have never happened had he kept his distance from her. When Starr continued to imply that they shared a connection, Schuyler advised Starr that she was a special girl and that she was in love with Cole. Refusing to accept Schuyler's decision, Starr asked him if she was imagining the idea that he felt something special toward her. He insisted that she was in love with Cole-- whether she realized it or not. \n\n\nBack at the crash scene, John discovered Gigi and Shane, and ran to assist them. He instructed Marty to tend to the victims in the other car. Unable to open Gigi's car doors, John grabbed a crowbar and gained entry. \n\n\nMarty was stunned when she discovered Cole badly injured and trapped underneath his car. When Marty pleaded with Cole to answer her, he began to regain consciousness. Unable to move, he begged his mother to help him. As Cole cried out to her, Marty experienced a memory of him as a child. In tears, Cole asked his mother if he was going to die. Holding her son's hand, Marty cried, \"You are my son! I'm here and will take care of you!\" Without a second thought, Marty lifted the car and screamed, \"John help me save my son!\" A shocked John ran over and pulled Cole's legs from under the vehicle. \n\n\nMarty pleaded with her son to continue to fight for his life. Meanwhile, a badly injured Matthew lay unnoticed nearby. Bo arrived on the scene as the paramedics assisted Shane and Gigi. When Gigi inquired about Cole's condition, Bo remarked that that Marty might have saved his life. As John looked on, Marty realized that Cole wasn't breathing - she was convinced that he had overdosed. As a result of hearing his mother's voice, Cole regained consciousness. \n\n\nWhen Bo insisted that Gigi and Shane go to the hospital, Gigi agreed. She placed a call to Rex to ask him to meet them at the hospital. When Gigi was unable to reach Rex, Shane demanded to speak with his father. \n\n\nBack at the cottage, Rex didn't hear his cell phone ring. Instead, Rex continued to drink. A drugged Rex maintained that he loved Gigi, which disappointed Stacy. Stacy expressed her regret that she had never found love. Rex told her that she was beautiful and assured her that any guy would agree. When Stacy wondered if Rex would ever have an interest in her, Rex informed her that he was spoken for. Stacy reminisced about the very first time that she had met Rex as a child. Stacy said that it was ironic that he had ended up with Gigi although she had met him first. As Rex began to feel the effects of the drugs, Stacy disrobed and stated, \"How about I show you how it's done?\" \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Langston, Markko, and Lola enjoyed a late night snack. Markko was shocked that Starr had kissed Mr. Joplin. Langston believed that there was more to the story. She questioned whether Mr. Joplin had taken advantage of Starr and wondered if Starr was protecting him. While Langston and Markko both agreed that the entire situation was bizarre, Lola believed that it was romantic. Upon listening to Lola's observation, Langston began to wonder if a mutual attraction between Starr and Mr. Joplin existed. Markko expressed his concern over Cole's state of mind if Langston's revelation was correct. The teens worried about Todd's reaction to Starr's interest in her teacher. \n\n\nThe crash victims arrived at Llanview Hospital. \n\n\nMarty handed Michael the bottle of pills that she discovered in Cole's possession. Michael announced that Cole's stomach would be pumped. Inside Cole's hospital room, Marty comforted her terrified son. In order to give mother and son a few moments alone, John exited Cole's room. As he stepped out into the hall, he observed a frightened Dorian. Assuming that John knew about Blair, Dorian told him that she was worried about her niece. John demanded to know what had happened to Blair. \n\n\nWhile Shane and Gigi waited for a doctor to examine them, Gigi assured her son that his father was probably trying to reach them. \n\n\nTalia interrupted Todd as he attempted to make a call. Todd declared that he was going to call his daughter to tell her about her mother. \n\n\nWhile Starr tried to convince Schuyler that he might have feelings for her, her cell phone rang. Schuyler used the interruption as an opportunity to escape the situation. As Schuyler walked away, Starr realized that the caller was Todd. She shouted, \"What does he want?\" When Starr answered the phone, Todd advised her that he was calling about Blair. \n\n\nAt the cottage, Stacy stripped for Rex. As Rex fell asleep, his phone rang again. Ignoring the call, Stacy sat on Rex's lap and declared, \"Sorry Gigi, Rex can't come to the phone!\" \n\n\nAs Marty sat by Cole's bedside, she assured him that everything would be all right. Cole asked, \"What about Matt?\" \n\n\nBack at the crash scene, Bo instructed his men to find out exactly who was at fault. As he examined the scene, Bo noticed Matthew's hat on the ground. In a panic, Bo frantically called out Matthew's name. Meanwhile, a bloody Matt lay unconscious out of sight.\n\n\n",
