    "soap_central": "\n Heart Appreciation \n\n\nAs Rex and Gigi continued their vigil at the hospital for Sierra, Elijah stopped by and informed them that things had been set in motion for Gigi's custody hearing. Gigi was sure that she would be a much better parent than Schuyler, and Rex assured her that she was right to make the choice. He didn't think that Schuyler had any right to raise a child with everything else he had going on in his life. Gigi wondered if Rex really wanted to be involved in the custody battle, as she was sure that things would get ugly.\n\n\nOliver returned to Kyle's place at the Angel Square Hotel after checking in on Sierra at the hospital. He still felt the need to protect the baby, especially after he had protected her during Stacy's pregnancy. Kyle offered up the sealed envelope with the DNA results again and vowed to support Oliver no matter what. Oliver was uncomfortable and declared that he needed some air. He walked out.\n\n\nRoxy left Marty and John to talk as Marty quickly hid the home pregnancy test. In response to John's questions, Marty stammered and admitted that she didn't feel well. He handed her a container of chicken soup that he had picked up and mentioned that he had stopped at Llanfair to see Jessica about the shooting but visited with Natalie instead. Marty was less than pleased to hear that, and she wanted to know what John saw for himself and Marty in the future. \"Like marriage and family?\" John wanted to know. \"Yes,\" Marty replied.\n\n\nBefore John was able to reply, there was a knock at the door. It was Oliver, who wanted some advice from John. Marty needed to get dressed for work, and she left the men alone. She stopped short and out of sight when she heard Oliver's question. \"What would you do if you found out you were going to be a father?\" Oliver asked John. Marty was clearly interested in John's response.\n\n\nWithout revealing too much, Oliver explained that there was a baby who was possibly his own, and he and Kyle were thinking of raising it. John thought that the baby would be lucky to have Oliver as a parent. Oliver thought that perhaps there were some people who should not be parents, but John thought that Oliver wasn't one of them. Oliver noted that Kyle was okay with having a child. John decreed that both adults involved should be \"on the same page\" because it wasn't up to one person to make the decision. Oliver asked what should happen if one person might not be ready. John was adamant that there shouldn't be a child if there was a choice to be made.\n\n\nOliver apologized for taking up John's time. John thought that Oliver wasn't too sure of what he wanted, but Oliver thought that he should accept responsibility if need be. John thought it was natural for Oliver to have doubts and pointed out that his brother, Michael, was unprepared, but he turned out to be a great father. Oliver hoped he would make the right decision, and John assured him that Oliver would have to see if it was what he wanted and then he would know what to do when the time approached. Marty received a call from Viki during the men's conversation and left, telling John their own conversation would have to wait.\n\n\nAs Cristian's art class at the high school drew to a close, Jessica asked him for some extra credit homework. Cristian assured her that he had given out his assignment and there was nothing additional for her to do. He stressed that he would not fraternize with the students. Jessica felt that everyone else was okay about her returning as a student except for Cristian.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Clint urged Kim to sign his prenuptial agreement. He advised her that it was a good deal and there would be no negotiating. He headed out and left Kim to contemplate her next move. She began to read it, but it was clearly worded in jargon over her head. As she mentally undressed her waiter, Stacy \"appeared\" and warned her to knock it off and get back to the agreement. Stacy wanted her friend to get things moving so that Kim could take care of Sierra for her.\n\n\nShe told a confused Kim that worrying about specifics on the agreement could be handled later. Suddenly, Elijah arrived, and a flirty, teasing Kim asked him to look over the prenuptial for her. She envisioned him in a state of undress. He agreed and sat down in the booth. He was stunned to see that Clint was the groom-to-be. He perused the document and decided that it was a well-written contract, though there was an infidelity clause that Kim should be aware of. If she were unfaithful, she would receive nothing in a settlement, not even the clothes on her back, Elijah warned. He added that there were no loopholes. Stacy \"joined\" them and wondered if Kim was willing to give up a chance to sleep with other guys.\n\n\nAn excited Carlotta finished icing a congratulations cake for Cristian as Layla looked on. Carlotta was thrilled that her son had a new career and a beautiful woman in his life. Layla updated Carlotta on Jessica's latest plight as a teenager who still had feelings for Cristian. She was certain that Jessica was \"on a mission.\" She showed Carlotta the photo that had been on display until Jessica broke the frame in a \"hissy fit.\" She was emphatic that Cristian had no intentions of sacrificing his relationship and his future with Layla. Just then Jessica walked into the caf\u00e9 and introduced herself to Layla.\n\n\nCarlotta was thrilled to see Jessica, who was astonished at the made-over eating spot. Carlotta enlightened her on the changes that Charlie had made and watched as the young woman's confusion grew when she heard that her mother had been a waitress in Texas. Jessica asked Carlotta for her \"usual\" and, noting Carlotta's own bewilderment, clarified that she wanted a root beer and fries. Jessica asked Layla to sit with her and share her fries.\n\n\nLayla made Jessica aware of the fact that the two of them were friends previously and she mentioned that she worked with Jessica's boyfriend, Brody. Jessica assured her that Brody wasn't her boyfriend. She offered Layla money for a new picture frame, but Layla refused to take it. She sneered that she would be able to replace the picture if she needed to because she had plenty of them. Jessica grinned that she had lots of pictures with Cristian too.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie daydreamed about her recent kiss with John as Allison lurked outside and peered through the doors. Bree asked about her mommy, and Natalie assured the girl that Jessica was upstairs resting. Viki suggested that Bree color a picture and asked Natalie where her mind had been. Natalie was evasive as Viki asked about John's visit but talk was cut short as Viki received a call from Cristian, who asked her to see him. Allison snapped a photo of Bree with her cell phone. Roxy arrived to have a private chat with Natalie. \"What's up with you and Johnny McBain?\" she hurriedly asked her daughter.\n\n\nStumbling over her words, Roxy declared that she knew that Natalie and John cared for each other but she wanted Natalie to leave John alone. She did not want her daughter to be a home wrecker. Natalie pointed out that it wasn't like the couple was married with children. Roxy shouted that she didn't say anything about children, but she thought it was a bad time for Natalie to be \"making a play for John.\" Annoyed, Natalie denied that she was after John, but she did want to know why her mother was protecting John and was suddenly a \"card-carrying member of the fidelity police.\"\n\n\nRoxy shouted that it was since she found out that John and Marty were...Suddenly, she stopped. She tried to change the subject but finally spat out that John and Marty were spending lots of time together. She didn't want Natalie to waste her time. Bree approached them, and Roxy pointed out how great Natalie was with kids. \"Too bad you're not the one with the baby,\" Roxy stated. Natalie thought she was referring to Stacy's baby, and she told her mom she hoped that Gigi and Rex got back together because of Sierra.\n\n\nShane arrived at the hospital and announced that he wanted to see his sister. He quickly corrected sister to cousin, but Gigi informed him that it was possible he could be a big brother, after all, because she wanted custody of Sierra. Shane was perplexed as Gigi made it clear that she would not be with Schuyler but would have custody on her own. Rex shed more light on it for the youngster and noted that Gigi wanted Sierra to be in a loving home. Gigi wanted to know Shane's feelings on the subject before she went any further.\n\n\nShane reminded them that he had expected the baby to live with them originally, so it was all acceptable to him. He wondered how Rex would feel about the baby since she was part of Schuyler and part of Stacy, two people he disliked intensely. Rex assured his son that he would be able to see the baby as an innocent child and see her for who she was, which was herself. He pointed out that people didn't hate him because Mitch was his father.\n\n\nGigi was summoned to see the doctor, and Rex accompanied her. Shane wanted to stay behind and look in on Sierra. He noticed Allison snapping his picture and called her on it. She told him she was a nurses' aide and was taking pictures of the babies for the parents. Shane pointed to Sierra and Allison agreed to take a picture of the two of them together. Shane stood by the glass window as Allison focused. \"Heed the messenger,\" she told him to say. She hastily said it was like \"cheese\" in her family. She would get his email address and send him a copy, she told him.\n\n\nGigi returned and Shane turned to give Allison his email address but she was gone. She had vanished quickly. \"I think the messenger will be quite pleased,\" Allison told no one in particular as she looked at the pictures she had snapped. Elijah arrived and advised Gigi that papers had all been filed and the fight would begin as soon as he had the date. Gigi had her own good news; Sierra was going to be released soon.\n\n\nCristian welcomed Clint and Viki to his classroom and told them of Jessica's return to school. The couple was dumbfounded that Jessica had enrolled and unsure of their next move after Cristian asked them to talk Jessica out of it. Clint wondered how his daughter was able to enroll in the first place, and Cristian mentioned the large donation that Todd had recently given the school. He was certain the principal was afraid of losing it so he allowed Jessica to attend class. Cristian wanted Jessica out of his classroom, though, as things were getting uncomfortable for him. He wanted her to get better, but it was all a bit much. Clint and Viki were undecided on what they should do. They were concerned about Brody, who wasn't handling things well.\n\n\nMarty met with Viki at Llanfair and assured her it was okay for Jessica to be a high school student again as she didn't know the exact cause of Jessica's memory loss. She thought that Jessica was feeling secure as a teenager, during a time when she was still a virgin and didn't have all of her problems. Viki thought that Jessica was \"retaking the journey.\" Marty felt that Jessica needed to experience life since she had no recollection of it.\n\n\nViki and Marty wondered where Jessica was and Marty assumed she was hanging out like a teenager. She wanted to leave before Jessica arrived, because she wanted Jessica to think of her as a friend, not a doctor, and to trust her. The phone in her purse began to ring, but Marty didn't hear it because it was on the table in the foyer. As Natalie and Bree ran by, the purse was knocked to the floor and its contents spilled out. Natalie picked up the phone and saw that it was John calling. She didn't answer it. \n\n\nNatalie picked up Marty's things and began to stuff them back into the purse. She spotted the pregnancy test with the plus sign shining brightly. She hastily shoved it into the purse and ran upstairs. Marty grabbed her things on the way out. \"Oh my God, Marty and John are going to have a baby,\" Natalie gasped.\n\n\nJohn left Marty a phone message. He promised that they would pick up where they had left off earlier.\n\n\nLayla grew indignant and told Jessica that she was insecure. Cristian entered the caf\u00e9 as the tension between the two women began to grow. Carlotta asked about the first day at school, and both Cristian and Jessica replied. Bordering on outrage, Layla couldn't believe that Jessica had returned to school. A bubbly Jessica announced that she had homework to do and needed to get home. She and Layla glared at each other as Jessica headed for the door. Cristian maintained that he was keeping a teacher and student relationship with Jessica, but Layla noted that Jessica was at school to look for more than an education.\n\n\nKim continued to sit in the caf\u00e9 and pictured all of the men without clothing. Stacy stressed that it was important for Kim to raise Stacy's daughter and she had to sign the prenuptial. Kim thought that forever without other men was a long time. Stacy assured her that she would understand if someone else had to raise Sierra. Clint returned and Kim handed him the signed prenuptial. \"Let's do it, cowboy,\" she purred at him.\n\n\nOliver returned to Kyle's room and advised his partner that he needed time to think. He wasn't ready to look at the DNA results yet and requested that Kyle put them away for safekeeping. Kyle agreed that he would wait for Oliver to decide to look at them, but he was nervous putting it off. Oliver acknowledged that in time he would get to where he needed to be. Kyle assured him that he would wait for as long as it took.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marty does not have a chance to get around to telling John that she is pregnant. And she overhears him talking to Oliver about whether Oliver is ready to be a father. Oliver has mixed feelings about whether he wants to claim Sierra as his daughter if the test results confirm that she is. Clint tells Kim that he will not marry her nor raise the baby with her unless she signs the pre-nup. At first, she hasn't a clue what to do. But Stacy's ghost tells her she must find a way to sign it so she can raise Stacy's baby. Allison Perkins is spying upon both Bree and Shane and takes both of their pictures to give to Mitch.",
