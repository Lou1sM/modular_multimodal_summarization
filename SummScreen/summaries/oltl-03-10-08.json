Nora explained that the victims of the Santi crime family had filed a lawsuit and were seeking restitution. The victims were asking for Antonio's inheritance. When Antonio read the victims' claims, he was horrified to discover the extent of the Santi crimes. Antonio felt the litigants were entitled to damages, but was shocked to learn the victims were asking for far more than Antonio's assets were worth. Nora informed Antonio that the diner wasn't named in the suit, and suggested that Carlotta remove Antonio's name from all the related accounts. Antonio became emotional when he realized the lawsuit threatened Jamie's future. When Antonio stated that Jamie was his primary concern, Nora informed Antonio that he could fight the case in court. Antonio refused. Antonio stated that his father had already put the family through too much, and he didn't intend to do the same. Cris suggested that the recent chain of events might be for the best. Cris stated that this was a way to cut all ties to the Santi crime family. Antonio continued to worry about Jamie's future. While Carlotta and Cris attempted to reassure Antonio that the family would survive the crisis, Talia and Sarah expressed their concern for the family. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr had a nightmare about Todd ruining her special night with Cole. When Starr attempted to contact Cole, she discovered that her father had cut her cell phone, landline, and Internet service. Downstairs, Blair argued with Todd. In an attempt to keep Cole away from Star, Todd was intent on moving the family to Hawaii immediately. Although Todd was convinced that Cole raped Starr, Blair knew that Cole didn't force himself on Starr. In fact, Blair believed Starr's confession that nothing sexual took place that night. Blair told Todd he could take Sam to Hawaii, but Starr and Jack weren't going anywhere. After much debate, Blair convinced Todd to remain in Llanview for Starr's sake. Todd begrudgingly conceded, but warned Blair to back up his efforts to keep Starr and Cole apart. Meanwhile, Langston felt responsible for Starr's troubles, and asked Dorian to check on Starr. Dorian found a distraught Starr, who begged Dorian to help her contact Cole. When Dorian refused, Starr stated that she was lost without Cole in her life. When Dorian stated that Starr was too young to be involved in a sexual relationship, Starr insisted that Todd showed up before anything happened between her and Cole. Later, Blair told an elated Starr that Todd decided to keep the family in Llanview. Before Blair could explain any further, Starr ran downstairs to speak with her father about Cole. As Blair attempted to run after Starr, Jack approached her. When Blair informed him that the family wasn't going to Hawaii, Jack stated that it wasn't fair and began to cry. \n\n\nAt the police station, Ramsey called John into his office. Noticing the bruise on John's face, Ramsey suggested that he might have grounds to get rid of John. When John stated that he might get rid of Ramsey first, Ramsey became agitated. Ramsey stated that he was aware of every attempt John had made to find damaging information concerning Ramsey. Ramsey offered to answer any questions John had. Although Ramsey's answers were vague, he mentioned that the key to his success was that he knew many people and important information about them. John took one last parting shot, and asked Ramsey why he attempted to kill little Shane Morrasco. Ramsey hesitated, but blamed the shooting on Todd. Before leaving, John told Ramsey that John intended to cause him a great deal of trouble. \n\n\nAt the diner, Cole waited to meet with John. Markko wasn't surprised to see the result of Todd's rage on Cole's face. After hearing about Markko and Langston's encounter with Todd, Cole was concerned about Starr and wanted to locate her. Markko warned Cole to stay away from Starr or face Todd's wrath again. When Langston called Markko, Cole grabbed the phone and began questioning Langston about Starr. Langston told Cole she had very little information because Todd had banned her from going anywhere near Starr. Langston advised Cole to keep his distance from La Boulaie because Todd had threatened to make them all pay. Despite Langston's warning, Cole was intent on seeing Starr. Before Cole could head off to La Boulaie, John stopped him. Cole told John that he planned to see Starr before she left for Hawaii. John advised Cole to stay away from Starr, but Cole insisted that he couldn't lose the girl he loved. When John mentioned that he understood how Cole felt about losing someone he loved, Cole realized that John was referring to Marty. Cole began to tell John that Starr was the only person who never judged him. John became alarmed when Cole mentioned that Starr wanted to protect Cole after he shot Miles Laurence. John warned Cole that he should never mention shooting Miles to anyone. John told Cole that Ramsey would definitely reopen the case if he learned that someone else had knowledge of the shooting. Langston and Markko watched as John spoke with Cole. Langston and Markko expressed their sadness over losing Starr. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Starr attempted to make peace with Todd. Starr thanked her father for reconsidering the move. Barely looking at Starr, Todd spoke coldly to his daughter. When Starr suggested that they discuss the situation, Todd informed Starr that he would have Cole thrown in jail if she ever saw him again. An angered Starr told Todd she would never tell the police that Cole raped her. Todd approached Starr and stated that he wasn't talking about sending Cole to jail for rape. When Todd told her that he would send Cole to jail for shooting Miles if she ever saw him again, Starr was stunned. \n\n\nDorian was delighted to learn that Blair and the children would be staying in Llanview. After hearing the news, Dorian told Blair that she wanted Todd to move out of La Boulaie at once. Blair defended Todd and told Dorian that Blair would not remain at La Boulaie if Todd were forced to move out. Defeated, Dorian agreed to allow Todd to stay, but warned Blair that Todd was a ticking time bomb. \n\n\nAfter being summoned to Ramsey's office, Nora was surprised to find Todd's lawyer there. When Nora questioned why Ramsey was speaking with Todd's lawyer, Ramsey changed the subject. Ramsey informed Nora that the mayor was upset with Nora's conviction record. Ramsey began reminding Nora of her recent failures. Ramsey told Nora that she let Cole get away with shooting Miles. When Nora stated that Miles refused to press charges, Ramsey told her that he was an eyewitness and that fact was ignored. Before Nora left, Ramsey informed her that she had better start doing her job or else the mayor would find a new DA. \n\n\nJohn promised Cole that Ramsey would pay for causing Marty's death. John asked Cole to be careful concerning Ramsey. \n\n\n",
