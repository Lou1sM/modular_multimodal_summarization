Blair's fate was unknown because she remained in surgery. Starr arrived while Dorian was talking to John. Dorian and John were furious when they realized that Todd had called Starr from the hospital. John stormed off to confront Todd. \n\n\nJohn found Todd in a nearby waiting lounge. Talia and another police officer were nearby. John didn't hesitate to throw Todd up against the wall. John demanded to know if Todd had stabbed Blair. Todd vehemently denied the accusation. John turned to Talia to ask why Todd had not been arrested for the brutal assault. Talia explained that Bo had instructed his police officers to hold Todd at the hospital until Bo returned. \n\n\nStarr listened as her aunt recounted the events following Blair's stabbing. Dorian was convinced that Todd had stabbed Blair because Dorian had seen him standing in the bathroom after she had found her niece. Marty interrupted their conversation when she asked Dorian if she could borrow Dorian's cell phone. Marty explained that Matthew had been in the car with Cole at the time of the accident, but no one had realized it. Marty was desperate to reach Bo. Dorian immediately handed over her cell phone while Starr absorbed the shock of discovering that Cole had been in a car accident. \n\n\nBo was frantic as he searched for Matthew at the scene of the accident. Matthew slowly came to while Bo stood in the distance calling for him. Luckily, Bo quickly located Matthew. Matthew tried to reassure his father that he was okay, but Bo refused to let his son move. Bo shrugged out of his coat then covered Matthew. Next, Bo called 9-1-1. While they waited for help to arrive, Marty called Bo to advise him that Matthew had been in the car. Bo assured Marty that he had found Matthew and that an ambulance had been dispatched to the accident site. After Bo ended the call, approaching sirens could be heard. \n\n\nAs Matthew was loaded into the back of an ambulance, Nora called Bo. She had gone to the school to pick up their son but he had not been there. Nora wanted to know if Bo knew where Matthew was. Bo gently broke the news that Matthew had been involved in a car accident. \n\n\nStarr went to check on Cole after she learned about his accident. She was relieved to see that he was, for the most part, unharmed. Cole was anxious to hear how Matthew had fared. Fortunately, Marty came into the room a moment later with the news that Matthew had been located. According to Marty, Matthew appeared to have suffered only minor injuries. Starr and Cole were relieved when they heard the news. \n\n\nShortly afterwards, Starr excused herself so that she could check on her mother. Marty and Cole were surprised to hear that Blair was in the hospital. Their surprise turned to disbelief when Starr told them that Blair had been attacked. Starr added that Dorian suspected Todd of the foul deed. \n\n\nAfter Starr left, Marty and Cole discussed Todd's possible guilt. Cole was certain that Todd had stabbed Blair, while Marty remained unconvinced. Marty didn't think Todd would kill the mother of his children. The two did not agree, so Marty deftly changed the subject. Marty confessed that, when she had seen Cole at the scene of the accident, all of her memories of loving her son had returned. Cole was overcome with emotion as he reached for his mother. The two shared an emotional embrace. \n\n\nAfter Starr's visit with Cole, Starr rejoined her Aunt Dorian in the hallway. John approached them a few minutes later. He asked Dorian why Todd had been at LaBoulaie earlier that evening. Dorian admitted that she had no idea why Todd had stopped by. Starr decided that she needed answers. Despite Dorian's protests, Starr sought out Todd so that she could hear his side of the story. \n\n\nTalia left Starr and Todd alone so that they could talk. Starr demanded to know if Todd had stabbed Blair. Todd was saddened because his daughter felt that she needed to ask him such a horrible question. Todd denied the charge; he did not stab Blair. Starr wanted to know why Todd had been at the house. Todd said that he had gone there after Cole had shown up at his house, stoned. Todd had gone to LaBoulaie because he wanted to find Starr so that he could warn her about Cole's erratic behavior. Todd claimed that when he arrived at the mansion, the front door had been unlocked. He walked upstairs just as Dorian found Blair. \n\n\nTodd then praised Dorian's reaction to the situation. Todd credited Dorian's quick action with saving Blair's life. Starr wasn't convinced of her father's innocence. She insisted that Todd swear he did not try to kill her mother. Todd swore on the lives of his children, the only people who truly mattered to him, that he did not attack Blair with a knife. Starr dissolved into tears. She wanted to know who would hate Blair enough to kill her. Todd didn't have any answers for his daughter. He offered her what little comfort he could by assuring her that Blair had been alert before surgery. The revelation seemed to help Starr. \n\n\nLater, John offered Dorian some coffee before questioning her about Todd. To his surprise, Dorian admitted that she might have been wrong to accuse Todd of stabbing Blair. Dorian explained that she had overheard Todd and Starr talking. What Todd said to Starr resonated with Dorian. Dorian didn't want to risk someone getting away with the crime because they were wrongly focused on Todd as the prime suspect. \n\n\nJohn approached Marty when he saw her step out of Cole's room. Marty updated John on Cole's condition. She also told him that Matthew had been located. John was happy to hear that everyone appeared to have escaped the crash without serious injury. Marty agreed, then changed the subject. She was filled with remorse because she had pulled John away from Blair at a time when Blair had needed John. John told Marty not to think in those terms; he reminded Marty that because of her, he had been available to help Gigi, Shane, and Cole. \n\n\nJohn returned to question Dorian about her change of heart regarding Todd's guilt. Dorian made a startling announcement-Dorian was certain she knew who had tried to kill Blair. \n\n\nNora arrived at the hospital moments after Matthew was taken into an examination room. Nora was upset when she realized that a doctor had not checked out Matthew. Bo explained that it had been a hectic night, fraught with confusion. Nora was dismayed when Bo revealed that they had not initially known Matthew had been a passenger in Cole's car. \n\n\nMichael walked into Matthew's room a few minutes later. Bo and Nora had their first inkling that something was wrong with Matthew when Michael refused to let Matthew take off his neck brace. While Michael continued his examination, Nora distracted Matthew by making plans for his homecoming. Bo watched as Michael tested the bottom of Matthew's feet for reflexes. When Matthew failed to respond to the stimulation, Bo's expression turned grim. Bo and Michael exchanged a long look as the significance of Matthew's lack of movement sank in. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Gigi's frustration mounted each time she failed to reach Rex on the phone. Gigi was desperate to get word to him about the accident, so she tried to call Stacy. Unfortunately, Stacy's phone went to voicemail. After the doctor gave Shane a clean bill of health, Gigi and Shane headed home. \n\n\nStacy was frustrated when she realized that the drug she had slipped to Rex was working a little too well. Rex was sleepy more than he was receptive to her sexual advances. When Rex's cell phone rang, Stacy made sure that Rex didn't answer it. When her cell phone rang, Stacy ignored it. She decided to move her little seduction scene to the bedroom. \n\n\nIn the bedroom, Stacy made quick work of stripping Rex down to his underwear. Rex was in and out of consciousness; he was completely unaware of what was going on. After Rex passed out in his bed, Stacy climbed in next to him. While Rex slept, Stacy talked about how much he loved Rex. Stacy also reminisced about falling in love with him at the age of 13. As she talked, Stacy revealed that she believed that she and Rex were destined to be together. Stacy was certain that fate had brought them back together when she saw Rex in Las Vegas. \n\n\nStacy also revealed that her plan was for Gigi to find Rex and Stacy in bed together. Stacy realized that it would be an ugly scene, but she was certain the payoff would be well worth it. \n\n\nGigi and Shane found a mess in the living room when they arrived home. Gigi immediately sent Shane to bed. While Shane went to his room, Gigi slowly made her way up to her bedroom. Gigi opened the door just as Stacy leaned over Rex's prone body to confess her love for him.\n\n\n",
