    "soap_central": "\nBaby, Baby, Who's Got the Baby?\n\n\nClint sat in a booth at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, and chatted on his phone with his attorney about the pre-nuptial agreement for his impending marriage to Kim.  As he finished his call, Kevin arrived, still wearing his black suit from Melinda Cramer's memorial service.  Clint inquired about Kelly, and Kevin said she was faring as best as could be expected; unfortunately, their relationship was over, as she'd turned his marriage proposal down flat.  At the nearby lunch counter, Todd overheard Kevin's tale of woe.\n\n\nSeizing the moment, Todd sauntered over to the Buchanans' booth and began to taunt Kevin about Kelly; Todd was incredulous that his old nemesis was still in love with his ex despite her lies, infidelities, and even having his son's child.  Enraged, Kevin launched himself at Todd, and socked him on the jaw.  Clint and a waiter pulled the old rivals apart, just in time for Danielle to walk into the restaurant and witness the scuffle.\n\n\nAs Kevin and Clint retreated to their corner, Todd nonchalantly strolled over to Danielle.  Danielle recognized Kevin's picture from Starr's photo albums, and asked Todd why he was assaulting his own nephew.  Todd glossed over the issue and asked Danielle why she wasn't in school, then quickly deduced that she was cutting class.  Defiant, Danielle told him he couldn't tell her what to do or where to go.\n\n\nTodd attempted to make headway with his taciturn daughter, and asked her about her hard times with the kids at school; he specifically asked if they were still taunting her about being Todd Manning's child.  Danielle replied that the other students weren't the issue, he was: \"I'm not gonna have a father-daughter chat with a rapist!\"  Todd claimed he was attempting to become a better man, and presented her with The Sun's front page story about his charitable endeavors to prove it.  Danielle was unimpressed, but Todd pressed on; he promised not to turn her over to the principal if she spent the day getting to know him.  Danielle considered the offer, then left, choosing school over Todd.\n\n\nAt the lunch counter, Kevin licked his wounds, and mused that Todd still hit like a girl.  Reflecting on his unfortunate visit, he told Clint he'd been foolish to keep pursuing Kelly, and hoping to rekindle what they'd lost; instead, it was time for him to go back to London and move on with his life.  As Bo and Nora entered the restaurant, Clint told Kevin to stay in Llanview long enough to attend his wedding -- to Kimberly Andrews.\n\n\nThe Buchanans were stunned to hear of Clint's engagement, but Kevin managed to take it in stride and agreed to be there for his father.  As Kevin left for the mansion, Bo and Nora approached Clint, concerned; Clint gloated that his relationship with Kim had blossomed in their absence, but Bo feared Kim was taking him for a ride.  Insulted by the condescension, Clint told Bo he'd made Kim sign a pre-nuptial agreement, and the \"happy couple\" wouldn't need to trouble themselves worrying about the man they'd lied to, or the family money.\n\n\nBo put his best foot forward, and told Clint he only wanted Clint's happiness as he still considered Clint his brother.  Clint grudgingly agreed that there was still a connection between them, but reacted coldly when Nora asked him if he really loved Kim: \"None of your business!\"  Bo and Nora congratulated Clint and hastily exited the cafe.\n\n\nOutside, Bo asked Nora if she was slightly jealous of Kim, and Nora replied by giving him a big kiss.  She said she was only worried about Clint's well-being, but Bo reassured her that the brothers' bond was rebuilding itself, and with the pre-nup, Clint had Kim well in hand.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, two of Kim's oldest and dearest friends, Sin City strippers Laudine and Leah from Las Vegas, greeted Nigel at the door.  As the exotic dancers asked what time the wedding was and where the DJ was set up, the clueless Nigel could only ask what wedding they meant.  \"Mine,\" Kim replied, descending the staircase in the foyer to embrace her girls.\n\n\nAs Kim escorted her long-lost friends into the drawing room, Nigel scurried off to make brunch.  Kim was troubled that Clint hadn't told Nigel about the wedding, and Laudine and Leah wondered if her rich groom had backed out.  Kim was confident that the wedding was still on, and told the girls that once she was Mrs. Clint Buchanan, they'd have the run of the house.  Jealous, Laudine looked down on Kim for settling on a marriage of convenience, and claimed she'd only marry for love.  Kim insisted that her marriage to Clint was about more than money, but she couldn't quite articulate what that meant.\n\n\nLaudine and Leah asked after Stacy, and received the tragic news that Ms. Morasco had died.  Kim explained that she and Clint would raise Stacy's daughter together, and told them that together, she, Clint, and Sierra Rose would make a family.  After Nigel served brunch, Leah lauded Kim for landing the ultimate social position of trophy wife, who could have her pick of male affections along with a large bank account.  But Kim claimed she wouldn't cheat, and told the stunned girls that she'd signed a pre-nup barring against all infidelity -- cheat, and she'd lose everything.\n\n\nKim strove to convince her old friends that she could be happy with Clint without lies, schemes, or multiple partners, but Leah and Laudine remained skeptical.  Their tune changed, however, when Kevin entered the drawing room to meet his new stepmother.  The girls mistook Kevin for Clint, and were amused to learn Kim was about to become his \"mother.\"\n\n\nKevin graciously greeted Kim, welcomed her to the family, and embraced her.  As they hugged, Kevin whispered in her ear that if she hurt his father, he'd crush her.  After Kevin left, Kim continued to talk up her whirlwind relationship with Clint to her fellow strippers; she swore she didn't need any outside distractions, just Clint and their new family.  Laudine agreed that that was what Kim really needed, love, not sex or money, but Kim still looked queasy.\n\n\nLater, Kim found herself alone in the drawing room, and was examining the fine furniture.  Clint's arrival shook her from her reverie.  Clint asked Kim if she was ready to get married.\n\n\nFollowing Melinda's memorial service, the Cramer women returned to La Boulaie.  As Dorian, Kelly, and Blair entered the living room, Dorian wondered aloud where Kevin had driven off to so quickly after the service, but Kelly seemed glad to be rid of her ex.  When the doorbell rang, Dorian rushed off to answer it, while Kelly quietly prayed Kevin had not returned for another confrontation.  Sensing her cousin's anxiety, Blair shut the living room doors and took her to task, asking why Kelly had turned down Kevin's marriage proposal.\n\n\nBlair didn't understand Kelly's choices; she and Kevin had raised Zane together for years despite Kelly's mistake with Duke.  They'd gotten past that, so Blair wondered why they couldn't they find their way back to each other.  Irritated, Kelly brought up Kevin's own mistake of sleeping with Blair, but Blair warned Kelly not to blame her personal problems on ancient history.  Softening, Kelly explained that raising Zane had only sustained her and Kevin's bond for so long; with Zane in secondary school, there wasn't enough to keep them from falling apart.  She needed to move forward with her life.\n\n\nBlair asked Kelly what was next for her, if not Kevin.  Kelly wasn't sure, but remained grief-stricken over her mother's death.  As she dabbed at her eyes with Todd's handkerchief, Blair noticed the monogrammed initials, \"T.M.\"  Snatching the hankie, Blair asked Kelly if Todd had given it to her.  Kelly explained her encounter with Todd at St. James, and how she'd felt pity for his sad situation with Danielle and T\u00e9a, but Blair had one piece of advice for her on sympathy for Todd: \"Don't!\"\n\n\nIn the foyer, Dorian answered the door and greeted Charlie.  She was surprised to see him, because she figured she'd gotten him in enough trouble already, but Charlie had only stopped by to offer his condolences regarding Melinda.  Dorian thanked him, but admitted she suspected foul play, and Mitch.  Charlie warned her not to go after Mitch again, as fighting violence with violence had already cost him everything, including a second chance with Viki, who wanted a divorce.\n\n\nDorian was saddened to hear about Viki and Charlie's split, and blamed herself for dragging him into her scheme. However, Charlie said it was his fault and his choices, and despite Dorian's entreaties, he was sure Viki would not reconsider her decision.  Nonetheless, Dorian was sorry about him and Viki, and Charlie was sorry for Melinda.  Exchanging knowing glances, they said their goodbyes.\n\n\nIn the living room, Kelly asked Blair if she was jealous of Todd spending time with other women, and Blair said she was over Todd for good.  Kelly surmised that someone else was in her life instead, and asked who it was.  Blair remained cagey, and said it wasn't serious; she reiterated for Kelly to be careful if spending time with Todd, as he was always most dangerous when wounded.\n\n\nBlair wondered if her cousin was returning to London, but Kelly said no; Zane and Kevin had their own lives, and she needed to find a new path.  Blair urged Kelly to give herself time to regroup, and Kelly considered doing just that, in Llanview.  As Blair left to run errands, Kelly answered the front door and found Todd standing there, smiling at her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at Llanfair to see Viki, who told her she had need of T\u00e9a's legal skills to handle the Banks divorce.  T\u00e9a was surprised to hear of Viki and Charlie's breakup, and asked if it was only because of Jessica's shooting.  Viki said the split was more complex; Charlie had shut her out after Jared's death, and put his revenge against Mitch before their marriage, before her, before everything.  He hadn't trusted her with his pain, and hadn't let her be there for him, or vice versa; her love hadn't been enough.\n\n\nT\u00e9a felt sure that Viki's love was more than enough for Charlie, but Viki said she was also hurt by his dependence on Dorian instead of his wife; she needed a fresh start.  T\u00e9a admitted she could relate to the idea of a clean break like the one she'd had from Todd over Danielle, but Viki suggested T\u00e9a keep her options open: it was possible that one day, Danielle could accept Todd, and open the door for Todd and T\u00e9a to reunite.\n\n\nAt Schuyler and Rachel's apartment, the roommates worked together to assemble a crib for Sierra Rose in anticipation of her going home with her \"father.\"  Both were thrilled at the prospect of Schuyler immediately taking custody, but Rachel warned her friend that the judge might not rule in his favor, and the results of the hospital ethics committee hearing could sink his chances for parenthood.  Schuyler agonized over how he'd let T\u00e9a and Rachel stretch the truth for him and conceal the oxytocin from the hospital board, and said he'd \"squeaked by\" on dishonesty.  Rachel rationalized her actions, insisting that Schuyler was working hard to right his wrongs, and deserved a second chance.  All Schuyler could think about was how Kim was the only one available to testify that he did not administer the oxytocin to Stacy.\n\n\nSchuyler told Rachel she should be furious with him for his foolish, desperate actions, and reminded her that her boyfriend, Greg, wanted him drummed out of the hospital.  \"I don't,\" Rachel replied.  Schuyler asked what would become of Rachel and Greg's relationship if Dr. Evans learned Rachel was keeping her roommate's secrets.\n\n\nJust then, Greg arrived with news about the ethics hearing: Schuyler had been cleared of all charges due to lack of evidence.  Schuyler and Rachel were overjoyed and embraced each other, but Greg was less than thrilled and quietly commented that he'd voted against Schuyler retaining enrollment in medical school.  As Schuyler raced off to the hospital to retrieve Sierra, Greg asked Rachel to think the situation through: was Schuyler with a baby and access to a pharmacy really a good idea?  Greg said he knew that Schuyler had stolen the oxytocin, and he knew Rachel knew it too.\n\n\nRachel grew angry at her beau's \"baseless allegations,\" and asked Greg if he believed Schuyler didn't deserve to be a doctor or a parent.  Greg shot back that Schuyler's actions proved he was unfit; \"he's an addict, people don't change!\"  Rachel was struck by his words, and asked if that meant she was still a crack whore and a prostitute, or that Greg was still a cold, heartless ladies' man.  Greg attempted to defuse the argument, but Rachel told him he had no proof of Schuyler's guilt.  Greg said he was sure Schuyler was guilty, and asked Rachel to tell him the truth: did she know for a fact that Schuyler had stolen the oxytocin?\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Gigi and Rex waited outside the nursery, and were anxious to learn who would be taking Sierra Rose home: them, or Schuyler.  Gigi reminded Rex that they'd been barred from Schuyler's ethics hearing, unable to testify about the oxytocin; if he was cleared of those charges, their custody challenge would be much more difficult.  Rex took a call from Elijah, who was speaking to a judge about a temporary custody arrangement to block Schuyler from taking the baby.  As Rex spoke, Gigi stared at Sierra Rose from behind the nursery's glass window, and marveled at the infant's beauty.  Turning to Rex, she thanked him for being there, and they shared an intimate moment as Rex told Gigi he'd missed her and wanted to be with her.\n\n\nRex and Gigi drew in for a kiss, but Elijah interrupted them as he rushed into the corridor.  He told them the judge was still deliberating, but Sierra could possibly go with Schuyler for the time being; they had only a slim chance to take the girl, as the courts favored biological parents, though the ethics hearing results could help if the hospital staff voted in their favor.  As Elijah hurried off to speak to the judge again, Gigi and Rex waited alone in the corridor, only for Schuyler to arrive with baby gear, ready to take Sierra home.  Gigi watched in despair as Schuyler explained that he'd been cleared by the hospital, and the nurse handed him Sierra to cradle in his arms.\n\n\nJust as Schuyler turned to leave with Sierra, Elijah rushed in and told him to stop: Sierra wasn't going with him.  Instead, after reciting the litany of Schuyler's misdeeds to the judge, Elijah had obtained temporary custody for Gigi and Rex.  Elijah ordered him to hand Sierra Rose over to Gigi.  Desperate, Schuyler called T\u00e9a at Llanfair, and T\u00e9a told him she was on her way.\n\n\nAfter T\u00e9a said goodbye, Viki was left alone with her thoughts at Llanfair, and found herself flashing back to Charlie's marriage proposal.  Across town, at the Buenos Dias, Charlie entered the restaurant he'd rebuilt, and remembered his wedding night alone in the cafe with Viki as his bride.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Schuyler clutched Sierra to his chest, and winced as Gigi, Rex, and Elijah needled him to hand his daughter over.  Heartbroken, Schuyler finally relented, speaking softly to Sierra and telling her he loved her before passing her to Gigi.  Gigi promised Schuyler she'd take good care of the little girl.  As Gigi and Rex headed for the exit, T\u00e9a stopped them in their tracks, and told them they weren't going anywhere with Sierra Rose. \n\n\n",
