Cris told Blair all about Antonio losing Capricorn, and how they needed to find someone to buy the club despite the bad market.  Blair paused at mention of this, and promised to try to help if she could.  Blair thought it would be a great investment for someone, and they discussed how Sarah's skills at booking talent upped the club's profile.  Blair said she could tell Sarah was good for Cristian.  Cristian added that the latest round with Todd seemed to be agreeing with Blair, noticing that no one had been kicked out yet.  Blair became quiet and reserved, and Cristian realized something was wrong.  He asked her what was going on, and Blair downplayed it, saying it was just \"kid stuff\" and that if she didn't hear any slamming doors or screaming, perhaps that meant things were being worked out.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, however, nothing was being worked out.  Todd coldly reiterated his warning to Starr that if she contacted Cole at all, Todd would send Cole to prison over the Miles Laurence shooting.  Starr tried to deny Cole's part in the crime, but Todd wasn't buying it.  Starr begged her father to leave Cole alone.  \"If you do, I will,\" Todd said evenly.  He asked her, \"Is seeing Cole more important to you than his freedom?\"  Starr insisted the Miles case was closed, but Todd said that the case could be reopened at any time.  Especially, he added, if someone came forward claiming to have heard a confession from Cole.  Starr protested that Todd would be lying.  Todd assured her that Lee Ramsey wouldn't know that, or care.  \"You wouldn't do that to me,\" Starr muttered tearfully.  \"I'd do it to Cole,\" Todd answered.  An icy Starr said that for the first time, she understood what everybody thought about her father.  For years, she had defended him, but now she realized they were right, and told him, \"You are that bad person!  You are that rapist!\"  She ran from the drawing room.\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Blair and Cristian were finishing their conversation when Starr ran in, hysterical.  Cristian made a discreet exit, and Blair tried to calm her frantic daughter.  Starr ranted about how horrible Todd was being to her and to Cole, and Blair struggled to soothe her.  Leaving Starr in the kitchen briefly, Blair intercepted Todd on his way out and tried to talk some sense into him.  Todd warned Blair to stay out of it, and insisted that Cole and McBain had to pay for what had been \"done\" to his daughter.  Exasperated, Blair started to urge Todd to \"stop making this about what you did to Ma-\" but Todd yelled that it wasn't what he did, but what Cole did!  He swore that Cole would pay, and stormed out of the house.\n\n\nAfter speaking with Charlie, Blair returned to the kitchen to console Starr.  She said she agreed that Todd was being totally over the top, but reminded Starr that she and Cole also had to take some responsibility-they had a choice to go off together that night.  Starr, outraged, said Blair was no better than Todd, and tried to leave.  Blair begged her to stop, and appealed to her daughter, trying to understand both sides of the situation.  Starr told Blair that she had been very happy to learn they were not going to Hawaii, but that everything was even worse than before.  She said that her father was completely out of control, and they both agreed that Todd was out for blood.\n\n\nJohn arrived at Nora's office just as she finished a phone call to Antonio.  John and Nora discussed Antonio losing everything due to the Santi restitutions, and John said he had to admit that he admired Antonio not fighting the Santis' victims in court.  Nora asked why he'd come by, and John handed her some files about allegations of \"corruption in City Hall.\"  Nora's interest was piqued and she said she'd look into it.  John's mood turned somber when he said he'd talked to Cole about Starr, and Nora agreed that they had to find a way to work through the situation with the young lovers.  John reminded Nora that Lee Ramsey being in charge of the LPD made everything that much more difficult for Cole-and virtually everyone else.  Nora said she knew John and Ramsey had issues.  \"No issues,\" John said, \"we just hate each other.\"  John explained that when Ramsey was around, people ended up hurt or worse, like Marty.  He'd hoped he was rid of him after he left the FBI.  John and Nora struggled to figure out what Ramsey's angle could be-why he came to Llanview and left the Bureau, and who helped him get to where he was, even after Ramsey's dirty past.  \"Someone's covering for him,\" John said.  Nora suggested that his benefactor really was Mayor Lowell, but John dismissed that: \"Lowell is someone's lackey.\"\n\n\nWith that, Todd arrived unannounced to confront Cole's guardians.  \"Can one of you girls tell me why you're protecting a known rapist?\" Todd snapped.  Nora said that was rich coming from Todd.  John and Todd traded barbs, but Todd made it clear that they had better keep Cole away from his daughter.  He also warned John that he had plans to file assault charges against John, and that McBain would be losing his badge.  John and Todd almost came to blows before Nora stepped in to referee.  Nora coolly reminded Todd that John being off the LPD would only help Lee Ramsey, which was not in Todd's interest.  Todd attempted to play it off, saying he didn't care, but Nora countered that she thought he cared a lot.  She therefore suggested to Todd that it might be better for everyone if he kept his mouth shut about Cole, about John...\"just keep your mouth shut.\"  Todd insisted that he still had plans for John and Cole, and that John was first on his list to go down.  Ramsey entered the office and asked John where he was going, but Todd covered for John and neglected to explain further.  He warned John and Nora once more to keep Cole Thornhart away from Starr, and left.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica inquired about Charlie's moving plans while toting Bree on her hip.  Charlie said he wasn't sure where he was going to stay just yet, and Jessica asked where he'd been when he first came to Llanview.  Charlie offhandedly mentioned that he'd been living with Dorian, which threw Jessica for a loop.  Jessica asked Charlie what Dorian had told him about her relationship with Viki, and Charlie reiterated Dorian's claim about the two women being \"the best of friends.\"  Jessica was reluctant to spill the beans without clearing it through Viki, but finally broke down and explained some of the history between Viki and Dorian.  She retold the story of how Dorian married Victor, had Viki abducted, went after some of Viki's men-and said that those men Dorian couldn't have, she would usually try to destroy.  The dumbstruck Charlie wondered what \"game\" Dorian was playing telling him her version of events, and Jessica said she didn't know.  Charlie decided he had to find Dorian, and headed off to La Boulaie.\n\n\nShortly after Todd's departure, Charlie arrived at La Boulaie to find a worn-out Blair, who said it was a bad time.  He asked if Dorian was there and learned she was at the Palace.  Blair asked if there was any tension between Charlie and Dorian due to his moving in with Viki, reinforcing the truth of the tale Jessica had just told him.  Charlie said he wasn't sure yet and thanked her for the information.  On his way off the property, he made a call on his cell phone, urging someone to meet him at the Palace.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Cristian met with Jessica.  Jessica explained that Nash had new partners in the vineyard and would be launching a new line of wines, and that they wanted something eye-catching for the labeling.  Cristian understood this-having worked behind the bar at Capricorn, he said people would often go for the wine with the nicest art design up front.  Jess was eager for Cristian to design the wine labels and work as a graphic artist for the various new lines.  Cris initially rejected Jessica's proposal, saying he didn't want charity, only to learn that Jessica had no idea that the Vegas had been cleaned out financially.  Jessica was shocked to hear of the family's misfortune, and asked Cris what he would do.  Cristian, reconsidering, grinned and said he would be designing wine labels.  Just then, Viki arrived home from the Palace; she greeted Cristian as he left, and asked Jessica where Charlie was.  Jessica hesitantly admitted that she had told Charlie about \"the Dorian issue\" and that he was on his way to confront her.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Dorian lunched with Mayor Lowell.  Lowell asked Dorian what she had been up to recently, and Dorian coyly said she was involved with a number of projects that all required \"patience.\"  Lowell reminded her that patience was a virtue.  Lee Ramsey arrived and was greeted warmly by the Mayor.  Dorian reminded Lowell that she and Ramsey were acquainted: \"The Commissioner once searched my house!\"  She added that he had been kind and reasonable.  Ramsey modestly said he could have been more courteous, but was glad that they could let bygones be bygones.  Dorian explained that La Boulaie was a featured home in many local magazines and journals.  \"Llanview Home Of The Year?\" Ramsey asked.  \"Runner-up,\" the deflated Dorian replied.  The topic of Ramsey's caseload came up, including Miles's shooting, and Dorian expressed her relief at Cole being cleared of the charge.  \"Eventually,\" Ramsey interjected, \"technically.\"\n\n\nDorian spotted Viki several tables away, and excused herself to confront her.  Viki was on the phone with her editor at the Banner, who Dorian assumed was Charlie standing her up.  Viki sweetly assured Dorian that she and Charlie were just fine.  Dorian waxed rhapsodic about how wonderful it must be for Viki to have found a man like Charlie after so much heartache-like Clint's rejection of her-but Viki reminded Dorian that she could certainly relate to that.  Dorian slyly said she hoped Viki was fully appreciating Charlie for who he was.  She said they seemed so in love, so oblivious, it was like Dorian didn't even exist.  \"Oh my God, if that were possible,\" Viki mused.  Dorian asked when they would begin to plan the wedding, and Viki scoffed that it was far too early to be thinking of marriage.  The topic turned to Rex and Adriana's nuptials, which made a nauseous Viki realize that soon, Charlie and Dorian would be \"related.\"  Viki promptly left the Palace, saying that with her business meeting called off, she would only be left to eat with Dorian, which appealed to her \"not so much.\"  \"Who asked you?\" Dorian trilled as Viki exited.\n\n\nBack at their table, Ramsey and Lowell discussed Ramsey's putting Nora and John \"on notice.\"  Lowell also urged Ramsey to get a handle on the dangerous City Hall case that was developing, and not to let John outwit him.  Lowell had to leave, and asked Ramsey to make his apologies to Dorian.  Ramsey explained the situation to Dorian as she returned, then made his own phone call inquiring about the whereabouts of Detective McBain, and headed off to Nora's office.  Dorian was left to eat alone, only to be confronted by a furious Charlie, who said they had to talk.\n\n\nAt the diner, Michael and an apprehensive Marcie faced the public.  Noticing the customers' eyes on her, Marcie wanted to leave, but Michael urged her not to be afraid.  The McBains spotted Gigi, who greeted Marcie happily, overjoyed to see her free.  Marcie was puzzled, and said she didn't know why Gigi would want to talk to her, after everything she did.  Gigi reminded Marcie that she was still her friend, and a parent too.  The trio sat down to eat, and Gigi put in a call to Shane to see how he was doing, then filled Marcie in on the Morascos' current activities, discussing the strains of being a working mother.  Noticing that her talk of family had shaken Marcie, Gigi apologized for being insensitive.  Marcie said she understood why people hated her now, but Gigi reminded her of everything Todd had done, asking, \"Who is the villain here?\"  She said that in her book, Todd was the bad guy, not Marcie.  Michael tried to lift Marcie's spirits up, reminding her of all the friends they still had on their side - Gigi, Rex, Adriana...  Suddenly, a young mother came up to their table carrying a small Asian child, asking Marcie if she was Marcie McBain.  Assuming it was another angry citizen, Michael tried to get her to leave them alone, but the woman gently asked if she could have a moment of the McBains' time.  The woman explained that her oldest son, Carter, had been one of Marcie's students last year at Llanview High, and had learned to excel in English due to Marcie's dedication as a teacher.  Marcie remembered Carter, and said \"he was a great kid\", and perked up and asked how he was.  Carter's mother explained that he had an early acceptance to college and possibly a good scholarship, and attributed her son's academic improvement to Marcie's care and attention.  She said she just wanted to thank Marcie for her hard work, then stopped short, adding that she understood what Marcie had gone through recently.  Emotionally, the young mother explained that both her own children were adopted as well, and that if she had had to go through what Marcie did, she didn't know what she would have done.  She thanked Marcie again for all she had done, and said her goodbyes.  As the woman left, Michael comforted Marcie.  \"You see?\" he said. \"People understand.\"\n\n\n",
