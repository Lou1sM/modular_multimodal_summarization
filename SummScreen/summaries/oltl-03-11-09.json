Instead, she offered up an alternative suspect: Ray Montez. John reminded Dorian that he was no longer on the police force, and suggested she share her suspicions with Talia instead. Indignant, Dorian accused John of having already cast Blair aside, and asked if he only cared about Marty. John countered that he cared deeply for Blair, and added that Dorian would understand that if she truly knew him. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, the Llanview Police Department continued to sweep the crime scene as Moe, Noelle, and Ray stood by helplessly. Noelle was mortified that an intruder had been able to come into their home so easily, and prayed for Blair's swift recovery. Langston, Markko, and Lola arrived home from the dance just in time to discover the phalanx of cops, and Moe and Noelle gave them the bad news about Blair. \n\n\nLangston called Dorian at the hospital for information on Blair, and Dorian asked if Ray was there with her. She ordered Langston and the teens not to leave the property, and quickly raced back to La Boulaie to mete out Cramer justice. \n\n\nIn Cole's room, a police officer brought Cole his cell phone while Marty tried to comfort her frightened son, who kept asking about Matthew. Marty reassured Cole that Matthew was fine, and told him to stay in bed and rest while she checked on Matthew's condition. Alone and afraid, Cole checked his voicemail and listened to Starr's angry message, deeply ashamed. \n\n\nIn Matthew's room, Bo and Michael were dismayed to see no reaction from the boy as Michael tested his reflexes. Oblivious, Matthew continued to chat with Nora, and said the worst that had happened to him during the accident was having his legs fall asleep. Michael told Matthew to tell him when he felt something as he pressed a pin against the sole of the boy's foot, but much to Bo and Nora's horror, Matthew's only response was, \"Feel what?\" \n\n\nMichael quickly hustled Bo and Nora out of the room as the frightened parents grilled him for answers. Michael said it was too soon to determine the full extent of Matthew's condition, and that more tests were needed. When Bo asked him for a worst-case scenario, Michael admitted that Matthew could be paralyzed from the point of injury down. Michael urged them not to panic, and said much more work needed to be done; a rattled Nora agreed to file the paperwork while Bo accompanied Matthew through another battery of tests. As the trio reentered the room and Michael sedated Matthew, Matthew guilelessly told his mother they'd gotten lucky, \"I could've gotten really hurt.\" \n\n\nInside the hospital lounge, Starr quickly recoiled from her embrace with Todd, disgusted with herself for having caved in to her father and letting him comfort her. As Starr began to reel off Todd's recent misdeeds again, she added another crime to his rap sheet: blackmailing Dr. Joplin to conspire with him to steal Hope. Todd tried to deny it, but Starr informed him that Schuyler Joplin had told her all about his plans, thanks to a letter Dr. Joplin had left for her son. She told Todd the letter was gone, along with any proof of his guilt, so he'd get away scot-free once more. Starr told him that the absence of evidence wouldn't stop her from remembering what he'd done, and tore out of the room. \n\n\nTodd tried to follow Starr down the corridor, but Talia and her partner stopped him at the door. As Michael passed by, Starr and John stopped him to ask about Blair's condition. Michael explained that Blair's trauma had caused swelling on her brain, forcing the doctors to put Blair into a chemically induced coma in order to promote her recovery. As Starr rushed to the ICU to see her mother, Todd asked to go, as well, and appealed to John. John reluctantly agreed, and Todd headed for the ICU. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Dorian burst into the drawing room and, with grand flourish, demanded that the police officers on the scene arrest Ray. Frazzled, she accused him of having attacked Blair just like he'd \"killed his wife.\" The put-upon Mr. Montez once again reminded Dorian that he had been cleared of all charges, while Moe and Noelle raced to his defense; Noelle informed Dorian that Ray had been with them in the kitchen at the time of the attack, helping Moe cook tamales. Defeated and deflated, Dorian stumbled out into the foyer, trying to regain her wits and control of her emotions. Ray soon followed, offering his condolences about Blair, and holding out an olive branch as he said he understood the need to lay blame. Ray told Dorian he would pray for her niece's speedy recovery. \n\n\nIn Blair's room in the ICU, Starr wept at her mother's bedside. Starr begged Blair to wake up, and said she couldn't go on without her. As she recounted her pregnancy saga, she remembered how Blair had always supported her and backed her up in the most trying of times. Starr pleaded with her mother to \"keep going,\" just as she'd helped the other Cramer women to keep going through adversity. \n\n\nAs Starr poured her heart out to the comatose Blair about Cole and her troubles, Todd watched in silence from the observation window. Todd wanted to go into Blair's room, as well, but Talia refused to allow it. When Todd tried to force his way past her, Talia promptly charged him with assaulting an officer and carted him off. \n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Nora watched helplessly as Bo accompanied Matthew for another round of tests. Dazed, she stumbled down the hall and ran into Marty. As the women comforted each other, Nora asked about Cole, and was upset to hear that he blamed himself for the accident, until she discovered the mitigating circumstances. When Marty revealed that Cole had overdosed on drugs during the evening, Nora hit the roof. \n\n\nStorming into Cole's hospital room, Nora confronted her foster child, demanding to know how long he'd been using drugs. \"Do you know what you've done?\" she asked him. \"Matthew has no feeling in his legs!\" The Thornharts were horrified at the news, but Nora would not be denied her rage. She asked Cole if the pot they'd found on Matthew was actually his, and Cole tearfully admitted it was. Nora asked why he'd never come forward, and batted aside his feeble excuses. \n\n\nCole said he'd told Matthew not to get in the car with him, but Nora countered that he shouldn't have been driving, period. As Marty attempted to defuse the situation, Nora turned on her: \"You stay out of it! Like you always have! I've treated this kid like a son when you would have nothing to do with him, so you stay out of it!\" Grabbing Cole by the collar of his hospital gown, Nora grew hysterical as she asked Cole how he could have done what he did to Matthew. \"He loved you, he worshipped you, he trusted you, he lied for you, and what did you do? What did you do? You stupid, stupid, stupid boy!\" \n\n\nMarty stepped in, and told Nora to leave her son alone. She said that Cole would face the consequences of his actions, and Nora vehemently agreed. As Nora stalked out, Marty held Cole, who dissolved into tears. \n\n\nDorian returned to the hospital with Langston and Markko in tow, meeting up with Starr in a nearby corridor. Starr explained that Blair had been put into a coma, and Dorian hurried to the ICU. \n\n\nBefore Langston and Starr could compare notes, the teens watched in shock as Matthew was wheeled past on a gurney. Starr informed Langston and Markko of Cole and Matthew's accident, and said that Cole had been high behind the wheel. Nora, passing by, overheard the teens' conversation, and asked if they'd known Cole was using drugs. Starr admitted that they had, and Nora unloaded on them. Furious, she asked the trio what kind of friends they were to let Cole spin out of control without any help or supervision. Before she could go further, Bo returned, and Nora told him she had news about Cole. Thoroughly chastened, Starr, Langston and Markko hurried away to the waiting area. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, the LPD forensic team finally evacuated, leaving the house to Moe and Noelle. Noelle was deeply shaken by the violence that had been done inside their home, and said she couldn't imagine what it would be like if Moe had been a victim, as well. Moe hugged his wife and told her she'd never find out. \n\n\nAt the Morascos' cottage, Gigi walked into her bedroom to find Stacy atop the drugged Rex. Apoplectic, she screamed at Stacy and asked what was going on. As a disoriented Rex came to, he had the same questions, but Gigi was loath to buy his claims of being confused and out of it. When Gigi informed him that she and Shane had been in an accident, Rex staggered out of the room to check on his son. \n\n\nGigi demanded answers from her sister, and Stacy presented a wildly skewed version of events: she claimed Rex had gotten wasted and come on to her. As Rex returned to the bedroom, he rebutted Stacy's accusations, but Stacy had a twisted answer for everything. She told Gigi that Rex had been hitting on her all night, that he'd expressed doubts about getting married, and that he'd convinced her to do an exotic dance routine for him. \n\n\nGigi asked Rex why he hadn't picked up his phone when she'd called; Stacy claimed it had been set on silent mode, but Rex said he would never have kept his phone muted. Rex swore to Gigi that he loved her and would never lay a hand on her sister. Gigi suspected Stacy was distorting the truth, but Stacy responded with a vigorous defense, mockingly laying out her own \"supposed\" misdeeds with derision, even though she'd actually done each of the things she was laughing at. \n\n\nStacy warned Gigi to take another look at her relationship with Rex, and said the evening's events were a major red flag. After storming out in a huff, Stacy gleefully danced off to her bedroom once out of sight. \n\n\nWith Stacy gone, Rex reiterated his innocence to Gigi, and asked about her accident. Still suspicious, Gigi explained what happened, and began to break down as the shock hit her. Rex hugged her, and said that without her and Shane, he'd have died, as well. He said he was glad they were okay, but Gigi still wasn't sure that their family was all that okay, and said that she'd needed him and he hadn't been there. Rex insisted he hadn't touched Stacy, and said he'd only had one beer. As Rex collapsed onto the bed complaining of sickness, Gigi dismissively told him to take an aspirin. Listening outside their door, Stacy smirked in triumph. \n\n\nIn the hospital ICU, John was at Blair's side, holding her hand. Anguished, John told Blair that he shouldn't have left her that night, and said he'd learned his lesson about taking off on her for other distractions. He admitted that he'd thought she could handle anything and didn't need him, but he'd come to know better. \"I could have stopped this,\" John murmured, and pleaded with her to come back to him. He promised to never stop making it up to her, and kissed her hand. \n\n\nAcross the hospital and across town, other scenes played out: Dorian watched John and Blair inside the ICU and struggled to contain her grief, while Ray put a comforting hand on her shoulder. Moe and Noelle, and Gigi and Rex went to bed in their respective homes, as Gigi turned away from Rex, lost in thought. Bo and Nora stayed by Matthew's side as he slept, while Talia placed Cole under arrest. As the police swung the doors to Cole's hospital room open, the teens in the waiting area locked eyes with their injured friend. \n\n\nMeanwhile, back in Blair's room in the ICU, John discovered something lodged beneath one of Blair's lacquered fingernails. Tweezing the foreign object out carefully, John discovered that it was a small scrap of paper, with a single letter on it: \"D.\" \n\n\n",
