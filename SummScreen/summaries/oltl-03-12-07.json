At the gym, Layla helped Cristian get over Evangeline with some weight-lifting therapy. Todd marveled at how good his birthday gift of a diamond necklace looked on Evangeline. Meanwhile, Nash advised Jessica to choose between him and Antonio. \"I already did,\" she claimed to a bemused Nash. \n\n\nDavid posed a \"riddle\" to Dorian, asking what would make it worth his while to kill Spencer. Dorian said she'd understand if David had killed Spencer, but he continued to deny it. He asked where the devious mind he had grown to love was as he stroked Dorian's face. Suddenly, it hit her: someone was paying him to confess. He explained that Asa had offered the bribe, so he had left town and let \"the old coot\" think that he had done the deed. Dorian offered her help, reminding David that she loved him and would do anything for her ex. \n\n\nOver dinner at the Palace, Evangeline thanked Todd for the necklace and insisted that he'd done enough for her, especially saving her eyesight. When he revealed the one million dollar price tag, she freaked out and demanded he remove it from her neck. She declared that she just wanted friendship for her birthday. He lied that he was cool with whatever. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Layla told Cristian that Evangeline planned to stay home on her birthday and watch television. Evangeline suggested Todd feed the homeless in Philadelphia with the necklace, just as Layla and Cristian walked in. Todd managed to clear the vicinity by gloating to Cristian that he had paid a fortune for the necklace. \n\n\nBo continued to question Rex about who he was protecting. Rex explained that it was not a simple situation, and he couldn't tell Bo what it was that he was hiding. He then gave Bo tickets for the Phillies season opener to cheer up Matthew. Meanwhile, Tate and Adriana discussed his future after baseball. \n\n\nAdriana said she had an idea for Tate, but it would only work if he took his pants off. It involved being the Marky Mark of Exposed and modeling underwear. He agreed, but only if Adriana handled all the fittings personally, saying he trusted her to make him look \"hunky, ripped, and straight.\" Rex then walked in on them shaking hands on the deal, although it looked a bit more like holding hands. Adriana gave Rex the \"good news,\" which seemed to make Rex a bit nervous. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Michael and John patched things up, and John asked Michael not to tell Mom about locking his little brother up. John said he knew Michael wasn't guilty of murder but that he was guilty of something else. Michael refused to tell him but said if it got out, Spencer Truman would get the last laugh. \n\n\nJohn went to see Bo, who asked why he hadn't been made aware of the fact that Natalie had tampered with the evidence in Spencer's murder and why he shouldn't hire a new chief of detectives. John explained his attempt to solve Spencer's murder his own way and said he could prove to Bo that he could be trusted if he just reopened the case. John questioned how the fibers from his scarf had gotten on Spencer, claiming it was a definite possibility that David was not the murderer even though there was evidence against him. \n\n\nJessica lamented to Nash how she hated the way she felt and the way she was making Antonio feel. Nash offered to talk to Antonio for her. There was nothing to tell him, she insisted, because her life was with Antonio. Nash challenged her to convince him that she belonged with Antonio. He accused her of taking her \"misguided\" decision to marry him lightly. \n\n\nJessica screamed, a little too loudly for the hospital, that she loved Antonio and she loved Nash, too, but that she had a history with Antonio. She kissed Nash anyway, proving his point, but bid adieu to any possibility of a life with him. If Antonio was her choice, then he was going to have to keep himself out of her life, Nash threatened, and just have Viki or Clint drop off Bree for visits. Before he left, Nash stated that they were not an accident, and he had no regrets. Jess burst into tears in the hospital lounge, clutching the piece of paper on which she had written who she should be with. \n\n\n",
