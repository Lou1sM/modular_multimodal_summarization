She assured him they were fine and to prove it, slipped him a phone so that he could call and speak to them himself. Shane was thrilled to hear from Brody and Brody was equally pleased to hear that Shane missed him. Learning that Matthew and Cole had also been injured, Brody spoke fondly of Nora. Thanks to her, he had been assigned to St. Anne's after his own incident on Llantano Mountain. \n\n\nBrody had his own news for Jessica. He was waiting for his release papers and was nervously anticipating his move back into the real world, though he would still be seeing the doctor as an outpatient. He insisted his recovery was in large part due to Jessica's help, and he was grateful to her. He added that he would have done the same for her in a heartbeat. Jessica revealed that she and Natalie had begun the healing process and that she and Chloe were bonding, as well. She felt certain that Chloe knew that Jessica was her real mother. \n\n\nWhen Brody realized that he had no home to return to, Jessica jumped at the chance to invite him to stay at Llanfair. An unwilling Brody thought he would be too close to Gigi and Shane if he stayed there and regretfully, he declined her offer. \n\n\nAs Shane described the car accident to Stacy, Gigi brusquely sent him upstairs, wanting to have her own conversation with her sister. As the women discussed the turn of events that led Stacy into bed with Rex, Stacy pointed out the favor she actually had done for Gigi. She reminded her that Rex had already dropped one wife and would probably do it again. As if on cue, Rex walked in and announced that he had gone to the hospital for blood work. He felt confident that Stacy had spiked his beer with a \"mickey.\" \n\n\nShane was unwilling to go to school after his major accident, but Rex convinced Shane to change his mind after suggesting he would be the center of attention. Once the boy left, the adults resumed their discussion. Rex vowed not to allow Stacy to leave the house, assuming that she would somehow distort his blood test records. Gigi admitted that she did not believe that Rex would have gotten into bed with Stacy, either drunk or sober; however, she doubted his story of drugs in his beer, too. Rex decided to camp out at the hospital until his results were in. He told Gigi that he was sorry over how things had turned out. Once Rex was gone, Stacy bragged to her sister that she could have any guy she wanted, and asked why she would she go after Rex. \n\n\nSneering at Stacy, Gigi advised her that she didn't think Rex did what Stacy claimed. Feeling that things had been weird since Stacy's arrival in town, Gigi related all the incidents that Stacy had been involved with, beginning with her breaking into Gigi's home and stealing her dress. Assuring Stacy that she didn't like her or know her, Gigi swore that she would make her pay. When a sudden call from Rex came through demanding that Gigi meet him at the hospital immediately, Gigi turned on her sister. She ordered Stacy to pack her bags and get out of the house. She wanted Stacy gone by the time she returned. Speaking quietly to herself, Stacy whispered that she was not through. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Marcie surprised Michael with some breakfast, but was unable to get any information from him regarding Cole and the news that the teen had drugs in his system. A busy Michael left Marcie at the nurses' station with Cole's chart left behind on the desk. Unable to help herself, she began to look at the records until a nurse berated her and grabbed the chart. She had seen enough to upset her though. Cole's blood type was noted as Rh negative, something that had to be impossible in view of the cause of baby Hope's death. \n\n\nStarr and John kept up their vigilance by Blair's room and talked about the possibility that Todd had been the one to stab Blair. Starr felt certain her father was innocent, though John was obviously skeptical. He admitted that he only wanted to find the truth. They also talked about Matthew and how Nora had screamed at the teens who knew about Cole's involvement with drugs. Starr felt responsible and, while she tried to stop Cole, should have told someone. John assured her it wasn't her fault. Starr was sorry she went to the dance, as Cole wouldn't have seen her and maybe her mother wouldn't have been stabbed. Perhaps she would have been stabbed, too, John suggested. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared continued to ponder the reason for Jessica visiting the hospital the night of Chloe's birth and determined that it had probably been Bess, who had come to have the baby checked out. They wondered why Chloe was still wrapped in Jessica's sweater, unless Jessica had left without seeing a doctor. Natalie admitted that she had once wanted to get back at Jessica, but her sister had shown signs of being a good mother. \n\n\nA confused Marcie stumbled into the waiting area where she found Natalie and Jared. Confused, she disclosed the information she had just learned from Cole's chart. She explained that everyone had been told previously that Cole's blood type was Rh positive, a distinct opposite of Starr's own Rh negative, which had allegedly caused the baby to die. It was impossible for him to be Rh negative, she insisted, though they had been advised that the condition in first babies was rare. She had learned that his blood had been tested many times for the drugs and so the information noted on the chart was correct. She wondered how she would tell Starr-and wondered what did baby Hope really died from. \n\n\nA tearful Marcie recounted the events of the night of Hope's birth. Recalling her actual birth at 7:58p.m., she vividly remembered the hour that she lived, how she had entered the world screaming, and was suddenly gone. She said goodbye to the baby in Dr. Joplin's office and couldn't imagine what could have happened in the hour she was alive. She added that there had been no record of the baby being in the NICU, but things must have been hectic. She shared both joy and sorrow with Starr, and would have to tell her the latest news. The only thing left of Hope was the lock of hair that Starr always kept in the locket around her neck, Marcie confided. As Natalie and Jared listened, the realization of what had happened that night showed in their eyes. \n\n\nJohn asked Michael for information on the autopsy reports of both Wes and Lee. He felt that the killer might have left a calling card. He divulged that he had found a small letter \"D\" under Blair's fingernail. Michael shook his head. John would forever be a cop, just like their dad, he sighed. Perhaps Blair had picked up the type from work, Michael suggested. John assured him that Blair no longer worked at the magazine and the type was not used. Michael refused John's request that he take the autopsy reports home, but gave him two hours to look them over. He grudgingly came up with a magnifying glass at John's request. Jokingly, he asked who would have random extra \"D's\" and if it were Todd. Not amused, John reminded his brother that he couldn't tell him anything. \n\n\nAs John eyed the autopsy photographs, magnifier in hand, he was drawn to the tattoo on Wes's arm. Calling a buddy, he verified the Latin term. There was an extra \"A\" on the tattoo. He stared at another photo and something caught his attention. He pondered the letters that had shown up in each crime. \n\n\nRoxy dropped off some extra towels to Schuyler in his Angel Square Hotel room and talked to him nonstop about the car accident. She also felt that Starr was an at-risk student who needed someone to talk to, and she realized that Schuyler should be the one to help her out. Schuyler did his utmost to get Roxy to stop talking and leave his room. He was finally successful. Brody arrived with Jessica, looking for a room. Roxy brought them to the room that Wes had lived in when he was murdered. \n\n\nStarr received a call from Schuyler, who figured there was no harm, since he had already been suspended. He wanted to know how she was and he asked about both Blair and Cole. Starr admitted that she was alone and scared and wished she could run and talk to him. Unfortunately, that would never happen again. In his attempt to soothe Starr, Schuyler suggested that the accident would be Cole's wakeup call and that he wouldn't be able to hide his problem any longer. He explained that sometimes a person had to hit the bottom in order to get better. He added that he would never call her again, but would be thinking about her. \n\n\nStarr continued to wait for news of her mother, forbidden to enter Blair's room. She asked the nurse to let the unconscious Blair know Starr was there for her. \n\n\nAs Schuyler relaxed, a prolonged and insistent knocking on his door caused him to yell at Roxy to go away. When it didn't stop, he was forced to answer it. Stacy marched in, suitcase in hand, and announced that she was moving in. \n\n\nOnce Marcie left, Natalie advised Jared that she had it figured out. Bess took her baby to Dr Joplin's office at the same time Hope was there. Gigi found Michael and Rex together and wondered what they had learned from Rex's test results. It wasn't Rex they were concerned about, but Shane. His blood work results from the night of the accident were in. It appeared that Shane had leukemia! A shaken Gigi stared in disbelief.\n\n\n",

And Marcie discovers startling information. While visiting Michael, she comes across Cole's chart that confirms that his blood type is not what could have caused the disease this killed his and Starr's baby.

Jessica goes to visit Brody at St. Anne's and helps him to move into Angel Square. Gigi hears Stacy allege that Rex tried to get her in bed. But Rex says it did not happen. She drugged him. And he will have a drug test in order to prove it. But before he can, they get the startling information from the hospital that Shane has leukemia. Starr needs somebody to talk to and has nobody. Schuyler calls her realizing he can't get into any more trouble than he's already in. He tells her he just wanted to find out about her mom and about Cole..
