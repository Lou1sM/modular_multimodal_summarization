While Matthew was anxious to learn the results of his test, his mother assured him that everything would be fine. \n\n\nIn the hall, Bo was alarmed when the doctor related that he needed to speak to both Bo and Nora concerning Matthew's test results, and that his findings weren't promising. \n\n\nThe doctor informed Matthew's parents that he had sustained a serious injury and was paralyzed. While Nora wept hysterically, the doctor explained that therapy might help Matthew gain limited sensitivity in his legs, but he doubted that the teen would ever walk again. \n\n\nClint approached as Bo attempted to console Nora. Upon learning of Matthew's injury, Clint advised Bo and Nora to fight for Matthew. Clint urged them to encourage Matthew that he would eventually walk again. Declaring that he would find a specialist that could help Matthew, Clint rushed off while Bo and Nora checked on their son. When they entered the room, a sullen Matthew insisted, \"Tell, me!\" \n\n\nDown the hall, Marcie comforted Starr, who was distraught over her mother's condition and Todd's possible involvement. Uncertain of the right time to break the news, Marcie chose to tell Starr that she had uncovered a startling revelation concerning Hope. Revealing that both Starr and Cole possessed the same Rh factors, Marcie explained that it had been impossible for Hope to have died from Rh disease as Dr. Joplin had claimed. Marcie insisted that Hope should have been born healthy. \n\n\nUpon learning that she had been given false facts regarding Hope's death, Starr panicked. In tears, Starr related how she had learned to come to terms with the death of her child. She had no idea how she could live without knowing how Hope had actually died. Before leaving, Marcie promised Starr that she would uncover the truth about Hope's death. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Jessica was skeptical as she watched Roxy give Brody a tour of the apartment in which Wes had been murdered. Troubled by the thought of Brody residing at a recent crime scene, Jessica begged him to stay at Llanfair, but Brody refused. He insisted on supporting himself. Realizing that Brody was determined to rent the apartment, Jessica relented and asked Roxy to make some minor adjustments. \n\n\nAlone with Jessica, Brody wondered if he had made a mistake by staying in Llanview. When Brody stated that he had no reason to remain in town, Jessica exclaimed, \"What about me?\" A touched Brody thanked Jessica for helping him in his time of need. Jessica asked him not to leave without saying goodbye. Brody assured her that he planned on sticking around for a while. As they laughed and joked together, Brody and Jessica shared a passionate kiss. \n\n\nBack at Llanview Hospital, a terrified Natalie expressed her fears to Jared - that Jessica's baby was dead and Bess had switched the dead child with Starr's baby. Staring at Chloe, Natalie insisted that Chloe was actually Starr's child. \n\n\nUnwilling to accept Natalie's revelation, Jared asked her to expound on her accusations. Citing that Jessica's first child had died at birth, Natalie was certain that the child that Tess had given birth to had died as a result of the same disease. Natalie also reminded Jared that Tess had experienced terrible labor pains before running off and leaving them locked in the basement. Jared became convinced when Natalie informed him of Todd's plan to steal Starr's baby, which resulted in her child being left alone in Dr. Joplin's office - giving Bess ample time to switch the babies. \n\n\nRealizing that Natalie's accusations might be correct, Jared urged her to let it go. He was certain that the news would devastate Jessica. Suddenly, Jared had a horrible thought - either Jessica knew the truth or Bess was still keeping the secret. Jared stated that either way, Jessica wasn't integrated as everyone believed. \n\n\nAdmitting that she expected to discover a secret, Natalie said that she never thought it would be something as terrible as what they had uncovered. Natalie feared how Jessica would react to learning that her child was dead. She also expressed her pain over Starr and Cole mourning a child that wasn't dead. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Gigi was terrified when Mike informed her that Shane had leukemia. Rex and Gigi listened as Mike related that Shane's white cell count was extremely high and it could be fatal. Citing that Shane wasn't sick, Gigi couldn't believe that her son had cancer. Mike announced that it was necessary to do a biopsy and schedule Shane for chemotherapy treatments immediately. Rex and Gigi were shocked to learn that Shane might need a bone marrow transplant. Mike suggested that they begin looking for a donor. Mike advised the couple that a blood relative would be Shane's best hope. He related that siblings were typically the best donors. Gigi broke down in Rex's arms and cried, \"I can't lose my baby!\" Rex promised her that Shane would survive. \n\n\nGigi blamed herself for being unaware of Shane's illness. She began to recall the difficulties that he had recently begun to experience. Vowing to stand by her, Rex told her that she wasn't alone. He promised that they would deal with Shane's sickness together. \n\n\nStacy barged into Schuyler's apartment at the Angel Square Hotel and insisted on staying with him. Promising that she wouldn't upset his life, Stacy told him that she would be homeless if Schuyler didn't take her in. When Stacy mentioned that Gigi accused her of seducing Gigi's boyfriend, Schuyler was certain that Rex was the guy that Stacy had been pining over. Stacy denied being attracted to Rex, but Schuyler was skeptical and rehashed their past together. Although he was unconvinced by Stacy's claims, Schuyler agreed to allow her to live with him until she was able to get back on her feet. Delighted that she had secured temporary shelter, Stacy headed downstairs to get a soda. \n\n\nIn the lobby, both Stacy and Roxy were less than thrilled to encounter each other. After Roxy ridiculed Stacy about losing her free ride at Gigi's home, Roxy wasn't too pleased to learn that Stacy would be residing at the hotel. As the two women bickered, their phones rang simultaneously. \n\n\nGigi phoned Stacy and Roxy received a call from Rex. Startled to learn that Shane was sick, both women rushed off to the hospital. \n\n\nWhen Roxy and Stacy arrived at the hospital, Rex and Gigi informed them of the news. Roxy promised Rex that she would provide a sample. To Gigi's surprise, Stacy agreed, without hesitation, to be a possible donor. Stacy insisted, \"I would never hold a misunderstanding against my nephew.\" Giving Gigi a hug, Stacy continued, \"You obviously don't know me very well, do you?\" Roxy was overcome with emotion when Mike stated that 75% of patients never found donors. In tears, Gigi expressed her wish that her parents were still alive to test as donors. When Rex expressed his regret that his father was dead, Roxy cringed. \n\n\nA terrified Rex confided in Roxy that he had no idea how to be strong for Shane. Raising her voice, Roxy demanded that Rex get angry. She insisted that his anger would give him an energy that would help him make the right decision. She said that Rex needed to do whatever it took to protect his son. \n\n\nMike informed Gigi and Rex that they needed to bring Shane in for treatment right away. Looking at Rex, Gigi wondered how they would tell their son. Offering Rex his full support, Mike promised to make Shane's case his number one priority. \n\n\nAfter agreeing to give her sample first, Stacy was escorted to the lab. Inside, she noticed Rex's file that contained his blood work results. Left alone in the room, Stacy tossed Rex's file in the trash. \n\n\nAs Stacy took pleasure in her misdeed against Rex, Roxy rushed into the room. Claiming that she had an important errand to run, Roxy begged Stacy to explain her absence to Rex and Gigi. Believing that she was alone, Roxy placed a frantic call. Screaming into the phone, Roxy stated, \"I need to see a patient in room 302...Yes it is a family emergency and a matter of life and death.\" As Roxy ran out of the room, Stacy emerged with a devilish smile. \n\n\nRoxy entered Room 302. With disgust, Roxy looked down at the unknown patient and yelled, \"Our grandson needs your help!\" Meanwhile, Stacy stood on the other side of the door. \n\n\nShane insisted that he was fine and didn't understand why he needed a checkup. As Gigi stood speechless, Rex informed his son that the doctors had discovered a problem with his test. \n\n\nSchuyler was shocked to open his door and discover Starr. In tears, a distraught Starr rushed into his arms. \n\n\nMarcie approached Mike at the hospital. Marcie told him that she had discovered something about Hope.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Nora are told by the doctor that Matthew is likely to be paralyzed for life and they should accept it. But they cannot. Clint overhears and tells them they cannot give up on their son. He tells them he will get all the specialists he can find and they owe that much to Matthew. Marcie admits to Starr that she's found out that baby Hope could not have died from rh disease. Hearing that, Starr is distraught not knowing what to do with the fact that it's now an unsolved mystery that her baby died. Meanwhile, Natalie and Jared figure out that it's highly probably that Tess or Bess took Starr's baby out of the hospital and she is now the baby everybody believes is Chloe, Jessica's baby died as she did not get medical care, and everybody is falsely believing that Starr's baby died when she is alive and well. And they do not know how to tell that to Jessica. Jessica and Brody are getting closer. Gigi and Rex find out that Shane has leukemia, needs a bone marrow transplant and they are dependent upon the rare chance that a family member could save his life. Immediately they rush to the only living family members they have which are, respectively Roxy and Stacy. Both of them rush to get tested. But it looks like Stacy is more concerned about scamming Rex and Gigi and saving her own skin. Starr rushes to Schuyler after hearing the startling news about her baby.",
