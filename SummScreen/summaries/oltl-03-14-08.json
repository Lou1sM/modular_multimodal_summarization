When Cole arrived and was told Langston would bring Starr to the docks to meet him, Cole refused to meet Starr at the pier. In order to speak with Cole alone, Langston sent Markko on an errand. Once alone with Langston, Cole admitted he still felt terrible about shooting Miles on the docks and allowing John to accept the blame. After confiding in Langston, Cole expressed his happiness about the opportunity to spend time with Starr. Upon Markko's return, Langston left to get Starr. Cole and Markko discussed the strong feelings they shared for their girlfriends. Cole was surprised to learn that Markko and Langston had never had sex. \n\n\nWhen Starr attempted to sneak out of the house, Shaun met her at the front door. Shaun told Starr that he was her bodyguard, and would accompany her wherever she chose to go. As Blair looked on, Starr's father informed an angry Starr that guards were posted at the front and back doors of La Boulaie. After Starr lashed out at Todd and ran upstairs, Blair and Todd argued about the situation. Blair told Todd that their relationship with Starr would be ruined if he continued his behavior towards her. Blair was shocked when Todd told her that he had threatened to send Cole to jail for shooting Miles if Starr ever saw Cole again. Concerned about Starr's reaction to Todd's threat, Blair went upstairs to speak with her daughter. Blair told Starr that Todd was serious about having Cole sent to prison for shooting Miles. A distraught Starr pleaded for Blair to understand her love for Cole. Blair questioned whether Starr loved Cole enough to let him go. Langston snuck inside Starr's room, and told her that Cole was waiting for Starr at the docks. Immediately Starr prepared to find a way to meet with Cole, but had a flashback of Todd's threat against Cole. Starr told Langston that she couldn't meet with Cole, but asked Langston to take a note to Cole. As Starr wrote Cole a letter expressing her love for him, she had another flashback-of her mother's recent warning. In tears, Starr crumbled her letter to Cole, and prepared another one. Confused by her friend's actions, Langston pleaded with Starr to reconsider. \n\n\nWhen Rex arrived at Buchanan Enterprises to deliver some documents to Bo, Natalie approached Rex and questioned him about his relationship with Gigi and Shane. Rex informed Natalie that his relationship with Gigi and her son was none of Natalie's business. Before the conversation became heated, Jared entered the room and Rex left peacefully. Afterwards, Natalie asked Jared to expound on his past comment-\"something was missing in his life.\" Jared lied and told Natalie that he didn't feel he was missing anything in life. Rene and Nigel arrived and interrupted the conversation. Rene and Nigel wanted to help with any information they might have concerning any of Asa's past enemies. As Natalie and Jared prepared to interview Rene and Nigel, Natalie discreetly turned on a tape recorder. As the questioning got underway, Rene became emotional when she noticed a picture of Asa. Natalie decided to take Rene for a tour of the building so that Rene could compose herself. Meanwhile, Jared and Nigel discussed Jared's scam of pretending to be Asa's son. Both men were completely unaware that they were being taped. During the conversation, Nigel mentioned that David Vickers was the real Buchanan heir. When Natalie and Rene returned, the questioning continued. After Rene, Nigel, and Jared left her office, Natalie looked down at the tape and said to herself, \"Grandpa was right. Anytime you want to remember a meeting, just get it all on tape. After she rewound the tape, Natalie discovered that she had the entire meeting on tape. Natalie continued to rewind and fast-forward the tape, stopping at particular points of interest. At one point, she heard the very beginning of Jared and Nigel's \"secret\" conversation, but fast-forwarded the portion of the tape in which Jared's scam was revealed. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki explained to Charlie the reason she never told him the truth about her relationship with Dorian. Viki was relieved that Charlie understood her dilemma, and delighted when Charlie told her that he had demanded that Dorian not interfere in his relationship with Viki. When Viki mentioned that Dorian was always looking for a secret to exploit, Charlie appeared uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Gigi helped Shane with his school project in the kitchen. When Shane mentioned Rex, Gigi reminded Shane of the conversation in which Shane almost revealed his birth date to Rex. Gigi instructed her son never to tell anyone his birth date, especially Rex. Moments later, several boxes arrived containing Gigi and Shane's possessions from Texas. As an excited Shane reached for a box, he dropped the box and several photographs fell to the floor. Some of the photographs were of Gigi and Rex back in their high school days. When Shane asked if his dad were in any of the pictures, Gigi became upset and attempted to retrieve the photos from Shane. Before Gigi could gather all the pictures together, Shane noticed a prom picture of Gigi and Rex. Viki entered the kitchen, and Shane was delighted to show her pictures of his mother as a teen. When Viki mentioned how adorable Gigi and Rex were, Viki noticed Gigi's nervous demeanor. \n\n\nIn the library, Roxy confronted Charlie about the charade he was keeping up with Rex. Roxy thanked Charlie for lying about being Rex's father, but wanted to know if he had an ulterior motive for doing so. Charlie attempted to convince Roxy that he wanted nothing from either her or Rex. Meanwhile, Rex arrived at Llanfair to visit Shane and to speak with Charlie. Viki thanked Rex for being kind to Shane, and inquired about his past relationship with Gigi. Rex evaded the questioning. As Roxy accused Charlie of putting on an act, Viki opened the door to the library. Upon hearing Roxy's statement, Rex questioned what Roxy meant by it. Viki was also interested. Charlie made up a believable excuse for Roxy. In a hurry, Roxy left the room. Before leaving Llanfair, Roxy observed Rex speaking with Gigi and Shane in the kitchen. Curious, Roxy also inquired about Rex's past relationship with Gigi. After Roxy left, Gigi watched as Shane enjoyed time with Rex. When Shane corrected Rex about what grade Shane was currently in, Shane came close to telling Rex his birth date. Before Shane could reveal the date, Gigi interrupted her son. Once Rex left, Shane apologized for almost revealing the secret to Rex. Gigi told her son that he did nothing wrong and stated that it was hard for a child to keep a secret. In a somber tone, Gigi stated, \"It's harder to live with them. Maybe it's time for secrets to come out.\" \n\n\nTodd arrived at Llanfair and insulted Charlie. After chastising Todd, Viki convinced Charlie to remain at Llanfair. After Charlie went upstairs to unpack, Todd told Viki that Cole raped Starr. Shocked, Viki questioned Todd. Upon hearing the entire story, Viki suggested that perhaps whatever happened between Starr and Cole was consensual. Viki told Todd that she couldn't believe Cole would ever hurt Starr. \n\n\nBack at the docks, Langston returned with Starr's letter. In the letter, Starr told Cole that it was best if they never saw each other again. Langston told Cole that Todd had hired guards to keep Cole away and that Starr no longer had access to the telephone or Internet. An angered Cole ran off to speak with Starr. Langston and Markko attempted to stop him, but were unable. Outside Starr's window, Cole pleaded with Starr to speak with him. As Starr headed for the window, Blair entered the room. Starr told her mother that she had to see him. Blair told her daughter that she couldn't. Blair told Starr that she had to stay away from Cole if she wanted to protect him. Angrily, Starr continued to say, \"This isn't right.\"\n\n\n\n\n",
