    "soap_central": "\nWho's Child Is This?\n\n\nAt the cottage, Roxy listened nervously as Gigi detailed how she had been forced to hand Sierra over to Schuyler at the hospital.  Suddenly, Roxy experienced a flashback of Allison Perkins ripping a child out of Roxy's arms many years before.  Terrified Roxy muttered, \"I just remembered something that happened a long time ago!\"   Gigi was stunned when Roxy revealed that Allison Perkins had stolen Rex from her immediately after his birth.   Roxy stated that Rex's birth mirrored Sierra's birth.   Roxy explained that Allison Perkins had delivered Rex in a cabin many years before.   Roxy had gone into early labor and Rex had been born with a serious medical condition.   After promising to care for Rex, Allison had stolen the child from Roxy.\n\n\nWhen Gigi began to question her further, Roxy clammed up.  Sensing that Roxy was experiencing problems reliving the past, Gigi reminded her that the story had resulted in a happy ending, but Roxy appeared to be hiding something.   At that moment, Kim burst into the room and demanded to know where Sierra was.    Once Gigi explained that Schuyler had been granted temporary custody of Sierra, Kim criticized Gigi for allowing Schuyler to leave the hospital with Sierra.    Annoyed by Kim's outburst, Gigi ordered her to leave the cottage at once.  Before leaving, Kim glared at Gigi and warned, \"You'd better hope that nothing happens to Sierra!\"\n\n\nAfterward, Gigi wondered why Kim wanted custody of Sierra.  A nervous Roxy took a gulp of liquor and muttered, \"People want babies for all sorts of reasons!\" When Gigi continued to wonder about Kim's motives, Roxy advised her that Kim was dangerous and warned Gigi to stay away from her.  Reminding Roxy that they had been engaged in an important conversation before Kim had rudely interrupted them, Gigi was eager to learn more about Rex's birth, but Roxy ignored her questions and rushed out of the cottage.  A suspicious Gigi watched as Roxy ran off with a bottle of liquor in her hand.\n\n\nInside Schuyler's apartment, Rex criticized Schuyler for hurting Gigi.   When Schuyler declared his love for Gigi, Rex advised Schuyler to prove his love, by allowing Gigi to raise Sierra.   Insisting that he loved Sierra, Schuyler refused to give his daughter up.   Rex became enraged when Schuyler remarked that he would win Gigi back.   Rex attempted to strike Schuyler, but Schuyler landed the first punch and sent Rex crashing onto the floor.\n\n\nAs Rex and Schuyler traded punches, Rachel stormed into the room and demanded an end to the fight.    Lashing out at both Rex and Schuyler, Rachel argued that they were causing more problems for Sierra, who was motherless.    Afterward, Schuyler ordered Rex to leave the apartment and to never return.    Rex was certain that Schuyler would eventually slip up and lose custody of the child.  With a look of determination, Rex vowed, \"You're going to slip up and when you do, I'm going to make sure you lose everything... Gigi, your child, and your career!\"\n\n\nLater, Schuyler held Sierra and promised to be with her forever.\n\n\nAt Statesville, Mitch grew agitated when Allison maintained that Sierra was a valuable resource to them because Schuyler Joplin was her father.   Allison was adamant that Sierra was Mitch's ticket out of Statesville.   Mitch stated that Schuyler Joplin meant nothing to him, but Allison smiled and replied, \"But he will soon!\"\n\n\nAfter hearing Allison's plan, Mitch admitted that her scheme might work.   Allison was convinced that the plan was guaranteed to result in Mitch getting out of Statesville.   However, Mitch believed that Allison was withholding valuable information, and demanded more details.   Allison maintained that Schuyler was an integral part of the plan because he was Sierra's father, but Mitch believed that Schuyler had a deeper significance.    Mitch ordered Allison to tell him why Schuyler was an instrumental part of the plan, but the guard interrupted and told Allison that her time was up.    With a devious smile, Allison promised, \"Just remember the plan and soon you'll know the whole story!\"  Mitch appeared curious as he watched Allison leave.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Kyle told Oliver that Sierra had been released from the hospital and that Schuyler had been granted temporary custody of the child.    Oliver stated that Sierra was safe with Schuyler, but Greg approached and referred to Schuyler as a drug addict and a thief.   A shocked Oliver listened as Greg revealed that Schuyler had been accused of stealing drugs from the hospital and forging a doctor's signature.   When Oliver asked if Kyle was aware of the allegations against Schuyler, Kyle insisted that Sierra deserved a better father than Schuyler.   Announcing that both Kyle and Schuyler were scheduled to work with him the following week, Greg warned that he planned to cause Schuyler a world of grief.  Walking away, an angry Greg remarked, \"I pray for his daughter!\"\n\n\nAfterward, Oliver continued to question Greg's claims against Schuyler, and wondered if Greg had a personal vendetta against Schuyler.  Kyle was convinced that Oliver was attempting to rationalize the fact that he was leaving a helpless infant with someone with a checkered past.    With a look of uncertainty, Oliver maintained that Sierra would be fine in Schuyler's care, but Kyle appeared doubtful.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie listened as Viki expressed her frustration over Jessica's recent behavior.   Viki related that she was traveling to London with Bree, in hopes of sheltering the child from Jessica's strange behavior.\n\n\nRealizing that Natalie was troubled, Viki questioned what was wrong.  Revealing that she had inadvertently informed a clueless John of Marty's pregnancy, Natalie feared that she had given Marty another reason to hate her.   Recalling Natalie's renewed friendship with John, Viki wondered how Natalie felt about John having a child with Marty.    Insisting that her relationship with John was merely friendship, Natalie stated that she didn't present a threat to John and Marty.    Natalie asked Viki if she could join her mother and Bree in London.  Hoping to clear Natalie's mind of thoughts of John, Viki agreed.\n\n\nLater, Clint arrived at Llanfair and informed Natalie that he had married Kim.    A furious Natalie was convinced that Kim had plans to take advantage of him, but Clint maintained that he had entered into the marriage with his eyes wide open.   Stating that Kim made him happy, Clint explained that he had married Kim in order to help her gain custody of Sierra.   Natalie was convinced that Kim would ruin Clint's life.\n\n\nNatalie flew into a rage when Kim arrived at Llanfair and embraced Clint.  When Natalie accused Kim of marrying Clint for his money, Kim stated that Clint made her happy and was the first man that she had ever respected.    Giving Natalie a hug, Kim promised Clint that she and Natalie would work things out.  Natalie glared at Kim.\n\n\nOnce Clint and Kim had left, an angry Natalie tried to convince Viki that Kim had plans to take advantage of Clint.  Viki believed that Kim's primary interest was gaining custody of Sierra.    Citing that she had to keep an eye on Clint and Kim, Natalie related that she had decided to forgo the trip to London.   Viki wondered if Natalie had decided to remain in Llanview in order to keep tabs on Marty and John.  Denying that she had any interest in John and Marty's relationship, Natalie promised to steer clear of the couple.\n\n\nAt the police station, Marty admitted to John that she was pregnant with his child.   Marty was furious when she learned that Natalie had revealed the pregnancy to John.  After relating that Natalie had accidentally discovered Marty's pregnancy test, John suggested that they end the discussion about Natalie and focus on the baby.   John questioned why Marty hadn't revealed the truth to him.   Stating that she had planned to tell him that night, Marty admitted that she had doubts concerning whether she was capable of committing to a child.    A concerned John asked if Marty intended to keep their child.    In a determined tone, Marty declared that she wanted to raise the child, but didn't expect a commitment from John.\n\n\nRevealing that she had overheard John's conversation with Oliver, Marty stated that John had made it perfectly clear that he wasn't ready to start a family.   Marty wondered if she had made the correct assumption.   John admitted that he had little knowledge about children, but after a brief hesitation, he announced, \"Let's do this together!  Marty responded by giving John a loving hug. \n\n\n",
