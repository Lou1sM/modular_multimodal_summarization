    "soap_central": "\n\nA nor'easter stranded winter festival revelers on Llantano Mountain. There was no room at the inn, which made for strange bedfellows. \n\n\nCristian and Todd, who were forced to bunk together, along with Miles and Tate, got into a scuffle over Evangeline and accidentally knocked down Miles. Across the hall, a boozed-up Blair shot insults at Evangeline, who retorted that maybe she would just go after Todd. While Blair sounded off about the humongous diamond necklace Todd had given to Evangeline, which she had refused to accept, the guys found the necklace, which riled Cristian. \n\n\nBack in the ladies' room, Layla's implication that maybe Blair would back off if Evangeline didn't spend so much time with Todd elicited a triumphant smirk from Blair but infuriated Evangeline, who fled the room. When Layla went to shower, Blair turned her attention to Marty, and the foes squabbled over Miles and traded barbs over their mutual disdain for each other. After a while, Layla and Marty both escaped, leaving Blair all by herself.\n\n\nIn the lobby, Evangeline turned on the charm to get a lodge employee to reveal Todd's room number. When she knocked on his door, Todd welcomed her in and kicked out Tate, who went down to the lobby, where he joined Cristian for a drink. When Cristian got up to return to the room, Tate stopped him, saying that Cristian didn't want to be up there. Cristian quickly figured out that Evangeline was with Todd.\n\n\nRex and Adriana got to spend time alone in their room. She reassured him that Tate was not a threat. After a sufficient amount of her talk about how into himself the hunky athlete/model was, Rex relaxed a bit, and the couple began to make out. Miles, who'd gone to get ice for his sore head, overheard Adriana and Rex in an intimate moment and smiled sweetly. \n\n\nWhen Miles ran into Marty, he reported that he'd gotten into his first brawl and had seen his first glimpse of true love. They took a stroll outside. Marty told him that she'd been in love with a wonderful man who had died then they stargazed and did the old \"star light star bright first star I see tonight\" thing. His wish was to have what Marty had had with her husband. \"I hope your wish comes true,\" she said before going back inside.\n\n\nStarr and Cole were alone together in a room, and Starr pulled away from Cole's kiss. She paced and fretted about their parents. He tried to get his girlfriend to relax and pulled her into another smooch. One thing led to another, and it looked like there would be more than kissing going on. While Starr was changing in the bathroom, Cole practiced seductive poses on the bed then pulled a condom from his wallet. \n\n\nWhen Starr emerged, dressed in Cole's shirt, they hit the sheets, but he could tell Starr was tense and gently let her off the hook, promising that they had their whole future ahead of them. In the meantime, Langston worried about what her friends were doing and wanted to return to their room, but Britney insisted they leave the lovebirds alone and just camp out on chairs in the lobby.\n\n\nTate walked in on Adriana and a shirtless Rex, who were getting hot and heavy on the floor. Rex was displeased. The men arm-wrestled while a bored Adriana guzzled champagne and wondered aloud if they'd be \"pulling out the ruler next.\"\n\n\nIn Todd's room, he gave up the bed to Evangeline and prepared to sleep on the couch. Seeing how uncomfortable and cold he was, Evangeline invited Todd to join her in bed. Across the hall, Cristian knocked on the door of the ladies' room, where he informed Blair that their respective exes were having sex. In actuality, Evangeline, wearing a big, fluffy hotel robe over her clothes, and a fully dressed Todd were snuggling for warmth. \n\n\nAfter some lingering glances, Todd stroked Evangeline's face, and they engaged in a gentle kiss. Then the kiss got passionate, and it looked like that robe was on its way off. All of a sudden, they pulled back. Todd said that they just needed each other that night. Neither of them could say what would happen next. \n\n\nTodd remarked that he didn't have many friends then laughingly amended that to \"any friends.\" He said he felt great and wonderful. Still freezing, they spooned and nuzzled. At that very moment, Blair suggested that she and Cristian get even with their exes and pounced on him. Vigorous rolling about on the bed ensued. \n\n\n\n\n",
