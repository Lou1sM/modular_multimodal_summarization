Brody immediately called her back and apologized, but Jessica informed him that the kiss was mutual. Recalling the men that she had hurt in the past, Jessica told Brody that she valued his friendship and didn't want to cause him any pain. Admitting that they both shared a physical attraction for one another, Jessica and Brody agreed that they had personal problems that needed to be sorted out before either could consider pursuing a relationship. They decided to remain just friends. \n\n\nSchuyler was alarmed when Starr rushed into his apartment and sought comfort from him. After inquiring about her mother's health, Schuyler reminded Starr of the trouble that he could face if anyone discovered them together. Stating that he didn't want anyone to assume that there was something improper about their relationship, Schuyler asked Starr to leave. When Starr insisted that she needed a friend to confide in, Schuyler suggested that she divulge her secrets to someone else, and expressed his regret at revealing the contents of his mother's letter to her. Schuyler was curious when Starr informed him that she had learned some information concerning his mother. \n\n\nStarr told Schuyler that her baby didn't have Rh disease. Upon learning that his mother's diagnosis was wrong, Schuyler was devastated. Relating that had his mother known that she wasn't to blame for Hope's death, Schuyler was convinced that she wouldn't have committed suicide. Starr tried to offer Schuyler support, but he declared that he had more questions. Schuyler told Starr that he wanted both Hope and his mother to be at peace, but he realized that their souls could never rest until the truth regarding Hope's death was revealed. \n\n\nWhen Starr observed Stacy's bra in plain sight, she inquired about the owner of the garment. Realizing that he had an opportunity to divert Starr's attention away from him, Schuyler informed her that his ex-girlfriend had moved in with him. Embarrassed, Starr apologized and hurried off. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Natalie feared how Jessica would react when she learned that Chloe was Starr's baby and that her own child had died. Before revealing their suspicions to the family, Jared was adamant that they needed to prove their allegations first. Natalie agreed and suggested that they collect DNA from the involved members. Natalie proposed that they compare Chloe's DNA to Starr's DNA. Acknowledging that it would be relatively easy to obtain Chloe's DNA, Natalie devised a plan to sneak into La Boulaie and collect DNA evidence from Starr. \n\n\nWhen Natalie realized that they would also need the dead child's DNA, Jared recalled that Starr kept a lock of Hope's hair in her locket. Natalie reminded him that Starr kept the locket around her neck and never removed it. Citing that Chloe had very little hair, Natalie prepared to clip the child's nail as a sample, but Jessica arrived and interrupted her plan. \n\n\nHolding Chloe, Jessica told the child that it was time to go home. When Natalie mentioned Matthew's condition, Jessica expressed her sorrow over the tragedy and said that she didn't know what she would do if anything ever happened to Chloe. At that moment, Starr walked in and greeted her cousins. Assuring Starr that Blair would be fine, Jessica urged her cousin to hold onto hope. Grasping her locket containing Hope's hair, Starr said that she would try her best. A look of panic crossed Natalie and Jared's faces. \n\n\nInside Matthew's hospital room, Bo and Nora listened as the doctor explained to Matthew the details of his injury. The doctor stated that Matthew hadn't severed his spinal cord. Although Matthew was paralyzed, the doctor insisted that his condition would've been even worse had the spinal cord been severed. As the doctor tried to convince Matthew that he could still have a productive life, Nora realized that Matthew was in turmoil and asked the doctor to leave them alone with their son. As a distraught Bo listened, Nora tried to give her son hope and stated that they would seek a second opinion. When Matthew demanded to know if he would ever walk again, Bo told his son the truth - it was possible that he would be paralyzed for the rest of his life. \n\n\nNear tears, Matthew asked to be alone, but Bo and Nora begged their son not to shut them out. Condemning himself, Matthew said that he was at fault because he rode in a car with someone who he knew was high on drugs, and he didn't wear a seatbelt. \n\n\nOut in the hall, a confused Shane asked his parents to explain how he had contracted cancer. Gigi was heartbroken when her son asked what he had done wrong. A teary-eyed Gigi listened as Rex explained to Shane that he was experiencing bad luck. He told his son that the bad luck was over and that only good times were in store for their family. \n\n\nRecalling that his friend's father had died from leukemia, Shane was convinced that he would die from the disease, too. Rex and Gigi told Shane that he would receive chemotherapy treatments immediately and that several people had tested to become donors. When Shane asked if a donor had been discovered, his parents regretfully told him that a donor hadn't been confirmed. Declaring that he intended to fight like hell for Shane to live, Rex insisted that his son do the same. Encouraged by his father's loving words, Shane promised to fight. \n\n\nThe nurse arrived to prep Shane for treatment. Gigi nearly broke down when Shane waved goodbye. Holding onto Rex for dear life, Gigi said that she was thankful that Rex was in her and Shane's lives. \n\n\nBack inside Matthew's hospital room, Nora held her son and wept. Bo stood nearby and thought about the difficult times that lay ahead for his son. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Rex cried as he thought about the possibility of losing his son. \n\n\nAs Roxy lashed out at the comatose patient in Room 302, Stacy eavesdropped. Explaining that Shane had leukemia, Roxy stated that the unknown man needed to help his grandson. An angered Roxy yelled, \"After what you did to me and everyone else, you owe me!\" Removing a cotton swab from her purse, Roxy took a sample from the patient. Before leaving, Roxy commented on his evil nature. \n\n\nAfter Roxy left, Stacy approached the door and wondered why Roxy was keeping Rex's father's identity a secret. As Stacy opened the door to Room 302, a look of shock crossed her face. She exclaimed, \"Wow, that's not what I was expecting!\" Observing the family resemblance, Stacy commented that the patient appeared harmless and couldn't understand why Roxy referred to him as evil. Stacy was curious to learn why Roxy was afraid of the man. Picking up her cell phone, Stacy maintained that she intended to find out why. \n\n\nRoxy returned to the hospital with the sample she had retrieved from the comatose patient. She demanded that the technician test the sample, but he told her that he needed a name to go along with the specimen. Roxy insisted that the technician refer to the donor as \"John Doe.\" When the technician relented, Roxy stated that her friend insisted on maintaining his privacy. Meanwhile, back in Room 302, the unknown patient moved his legs. \n\n\nStacy returned home and discovered Starr's glove. Convinced that Schuyler was dating someone, Stacy demanded to know who the article belonged to. When Schuyler refused to tell, Stacy declared that she didn't care to know, because she had enough secrets of her own.\n\n\n",
