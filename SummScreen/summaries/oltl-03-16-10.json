    "soap_central": "\n Teacher's Sweat \n\n\nAt Llanview High School, Langston encountered Starr in the hallway and was elusive on details regarding her finished musical. Langston quickly changed the subject when she saw Dani in the hallway, and pointed Starr in her direction. Starr headed over to her sister, who sarcastically informed her that, since Dani was known throughout school as \"Detention Dani,\"  it was her intent to have Todd give up as much money as he had to in order to smooth things over for her. She promised Starr that she would make sure there was enough money left over for her siblings.\n\n\nLangston could hardly believe it when she received a photo of Ford's abs via text message. \"My office now,\" followed the message on the heels of the photo. \"Oh my God, are you sexting?\" Starr asked her friend when she spotted the photo on the cell phone. Langston hurriedly assured her that it wasn't what she thought, though Starr was under the mistaken impression that it was Markko's photo that she was looking at. Starr was concerned that the photo could end up on the Internet somewhere.\n\n\nA stressed-out Langston pleaded with her friend to understand because she was finding things difficult. Langston wanted time and asked Starr to cover for her. Again, Starr misunderstood and empathized that she and Cole never had time to be together either. Langston wanted to leave and stop the texting. She began to go on about not being able to sleep or eat, and she asked Starr to oversee the musical sign-ups for her. Starr reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nIn Cristian's classroom, a note he had written to Jessica fell to the floor unseen as he spoke to the class. When Dani walked into the classroom late, she spotted the note and pounced on it. She began to read it out loud to her classmates and quickly accused her teacher of dating one of his students. Cristian grabbed the note from Dani's hand and ordered her to start focusing on herself, her homework, and her attitude. He let it be known that the note was none of her business.\n\n\nHe turned to the class and implored them to sign up to work on the school musical for extra credit. He was unable to drum up any business from his apathetic students but asked Dani to see him after class. He wanted to speak to her about her behavior and informed her that she would have to see him in detention. He accused her of being just like Todd. Dani insisted she wasn't, though Cristian told her she was rude and arrogant like Todd. He suggested that she prove she was different and begin to act like a human being.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair informed Dorian that she needed to visit the high school to sign papers for Starr, while, in the foyer, Kelly spoke to her son Zane on the phone and continuously rejected calls from Todd. Dorian was desperate to speak to Langston instead of merely communicating via text message. Blair began to tell her that Langston was \"in way over her head,\" but it didn't involve Markko as Dorian first suspected.\n\n\nDorian refused to listen and immediately stopped Blair. She insisted that she was going to respect Langston's wishes and not interfere. She vowed that she wouldn't offer any advice unless she was asked. Kelly, who was floored to find five phone messages from Todd, entered the room. She and Blair were quite amused over Dorian's promise.\n\n\nThe women laughed and bet that Dorian would be unable to stop her meddling, and they continued to tease her. Kelly announced that she was ready to leave for London, and Dorian spoke up. \"Over my dead body,\" she growled. This caused Kelly and Blair to burst out laughing again when they realized they had already won their bet. Kelly checked her messages and heard that Todd had upped the stakes in his quest for her to work for him.\n\n\nAs Blair left for the high school, Dorian forbade Kelly to return to London. She explained that her niece had just arrived in Llanview and couldn't leave yet. Kelly reminded her that both her son and life were in London, and she thought that Dorian only wanted her to stay because none of the other Cramer girls needed Dorian any longer.\n\n\nDorian maintained that her girls would always need her for the truth. She stated that Kelly was hiding from her future, and preferred to stay hidden in her past in London. She asked her niece to join her administration or to write something other than the ridiculous blog Kelly had been committed to of late. She even thought that Kelly could take over Craze magazine. Kelly admitted that she was retreating since her mother's death. Dorian knew that Kelly was grieving, but Dorian said she would be there for Kelly. She added that Melinda had been extremely proud of Kelly the \"firecracker.\" She wondered what happened to that girl, and she wanted Kelly to find her. She also wanted her niece to stay.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cole and Markko sat at the counter while working on their laptops. Markko was stressed to learn that he and Langston had accidentally picked up each other's school folders and he had her script for the school musical instead of his own work. As Cole waited for Hannah to arrive, he insisted that there was nothing between him and his class project partner. Markko left to track down Langston at school so they could swap folders. Cole continued to phone Hannah, who was late for their meeting.\n\n\nJessica finished dressing for school but was dismayed when an unknown visitor walked into Llanfair. As Todd leaned over to kiss her, she slugged him. With his nose bleeding, Todd identified himself, but Jessica didn't recognize him. Todd showed her various pieces of identification, but Jessica insisted that his face was different. Todd informed her of his plastic surgery and once he began to recall various events in their past that only he would have known about, Jessica realized it was really Todd.\n\n\nShe told him that Viki had gone to London with Bree while Todd spoke about his daughter who wouldn't talk to him. Jessica thought he meant Starr and was shocked to learn that Dani was his daughter. She knew Dani because Jessica had enrolled at the high school, Jessica informed her uncle. Todd asked that she put in a good word for him with both her good friend, Kelly, and with Dani. He had tried talking to both to no avail.\n\n\nJessica thought that Todd had a habit of smothering people. Todd thought that Jessica would do well as his spokeswoman. He was surprised to hear that Dani was getting into trouble but blamed it on himself. Jessica confessed that she wanted Cristian. Todd exclaimed that she could find a nice guy instead, since Cristian was a mistake the first time. He could hardly believe that Jessica was after Cristian again and pointed out that Cristian was dating Evangeline's sister. \"Who's Evangeline\"\" Jessica wanted to know. She knew Layla and she was sure that Layla and Cristian would never last.\n\n\nTodd tried to explain that Cristian had moved on, but Jessica insisted that she and Cristian had been special. She was sure he would return to her when he remembered. \"Don't count on it, sweetie,\" Todd said gently. Jessica was sure that Cristian would return to her as she had seen his face as he looked at the mementos she had packed for him. Todd tried to explain that many things had happened over the years that she couldn't remember. He told her that Blair and Cristian had been together, and Jessica was mortified. She pointed out that the pair had nothing in common, but Todd noted that they were merely both adults.\n\n\nAdamantly, Jessica claimed that Cristian loved her, but Todd quickly pointed out that Cristian had loved her in the past, back in high school. He wanted his niece to forget about the past, especially since she had dated losers. Jessica still contended that she loved Cristian, she had feelings for him, and they were first loves. She began to cry that she couldn't let him go. Cristian was all she knew and she couldn't relate to a family and people that she couldn't remember and didn't know.\n\n\nJessica noticed that some things didn't change as she accused her uncle of making her cry. Todd was sorry and urged Jessica to go after Cristian the way he was still fighting for Kelly and Dani. Jessica agreed to talk to Dani.\n\n\nHannah showed up at Ford's office and demanded that they talk. She was insulted when he asked her if she had an appointment. She reminded him that they had slept together and accused him of ignoring her. Ford coldly informed her that's all it was and she would have to look somewhere else if she wanted a boyfriend. He quickly ushered her out as he waited for Langston to arrive. Langston didn't disappoint, though he demanded to know what had taken her so long. While Langston wanted to talk, Ford began to kiss her and quickly, the pair began to remove their clothing.\n\n\nOnce Ford and Langston had made love, Ford began to dress quickly. He suggested that Langston get dressed, too, as he was in a hurry to teach a class. Langston was annoyed, as she had ditched school for him. She advised him that she couldn't do that again, and she asked him to stop his texting to her. She advised him that Starr had seen his photo text and thought it was Markko. Ford thought it was all exciting, and he welcomed their risky relationship. He kissed her again but stressed that he had to leave. Langston remained behind in a state of undress and seated on the couch.\n\n\nHannah returned to her residence and found Ford's page on the social network \"Myface.\" His profile indicated that he was \"single and looking.\"\n\n\nMarkko showed up at the high school but was unable to locate Langston. He found Starr at the musical sign-up table instead, but Starr was unable to help him. She suggested that Langston had headed to the diner to look for Markko. He left the musical script with Starr and headed back to the diner. Matthew stood at the table and waited for Destiny to sign up for auditions. Blair showed up, signed some papers for Starr, and stopped to say hello to her daughter. After Blair, Destiny, and Starr made fun of Matthew and called him a chicken, he signed up for auditions too. Blair headed to Cristian's classroom.\n\n\nBlair arrived as Cristian finished up with Dani. Blair thought that Cristian should \"cut Dani some slack,\" as she had been through some terrible times. Cristian felt inept, and Blair suggested that he give himself a break as well. He was a wonderful teacher, as she had learned firsthand after he taught her how to use the cash register at Capricorn, she teased. Cristian told Blair about Jessica and how his ex-girlfriend thought they were still in love. He couldn't bear the way she looked at him as he taught his class.\n\n\nBlair laughed, and Cristian admitted that while it was funny, it was also sad. He had gone through the mementos that Jessica had given him and realized that while they had feelings for each other in the past, they were different people. He was happy with Layla, but it was certainly interesting looking back, he added. Blair told him to be careful because things could get dangerous. She declared that was why she stayed away from Todd. She reminded him that Jessica wasn't well, which made Cristian feel that the situation was more difficult. She threw her arms around Cristian in a show of support, but just then Jessica strolled in. \"Get your slutty hands off of him,\" Jessica ordered Blair.\n\n\nDani ran into Starr in the hallway and demanded to know if her sister thought Dani was like Todd. Starr acknowledged that both Dani and Todd were stubborn with no tact, though she thought that T\u00e9a was, too, so it was difficult to see where Dani got her attitude from. Starr thought that Dani should do something different and sign up for the musical. Dani protested that she had never done any acting.\n\n\nStarr opened the folder and looked at the script. She was horrified that her friend had written about Cole and Starr. She was beside herself with anger.\n\n\nUnable to reach Hannah by phone, Cole headed to her room. He received a phone call from Markko, who told him he was unable to locate Langston and her phone was off. Cole approached Hannah's place and, finding the door ajar, walked in. Hannah appeared to be sleeping, but he was unable to rouse her.\n\n\nFirmly, Kelly stated that she needed to see her son and could not stay in Llanview. Dorian advised her that her door was always open. Just then, the doorbell rang, and Kelly realized that the driver was there to take her to the airport. Opening the door, Kelly advised the man to retrieve her bags. On his way out, the driver received a phone call.  \"You know what to do,\" Todd advised him.\n\n\nMarkko arrived at Ford's office.\n\n\n",

Jessica is still obsessing over Cristian since she has no memory of loving anybody else. Todd is determined to get Kelly to work with him for the Sun even though she wants to get back to England. Langston is secretly going off and messing around with Ford. Hannah cannot accept being used by him. Cole goes to find Hannah and finds her unconscious on her bed.",
