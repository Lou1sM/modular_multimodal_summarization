When Roxy implied that Shane could be Rex's son, Rex exploded. Rex told Roxy that Shane's father was a deceased Navy Seal, and insisted that Roxy respect Gigi's privacy. Appearing doubtful, Roxy suggested that Rex's relationship with Adriana would be in jeopardy if Rex turned out to be Shane's father. \n\n\nGigi thanked Marcie for agreeing to look after Shane for the day. When Marcie noticed Gigi observing a picture of Rex holding Tommy, Marcie mentioned the strange coincidence that Gigi and Rex had a past relationship. When Shane told Marcie about the pictures he discovered of Rex and Gigi together, Gigi became slightly irritated with her son. After avoiding much of Marcie's questioning concerning Rex and Adriana, Gigi left for work. Alone with Marcie, Shane sadly expressed his grief over not having a photograph of his father. Shane couldn't understand why Gigi would have so many photos of Rex, but not a single one of his dad. \n\n\nAt the police station, a distraught Antonio told Talia that he felt terrible about losing Jamie's inheritance. Talia told Antonio that Jamie was loved, and that was more important than any inheritance. As Antonio continued to brood, John approached and asked Antonio if he had spoken with Ramsey about assigning them more productive cases. Overhearing part of the conversation, Ramsey demanded answers from John. John criticized Ramsey for placing his top detectives on such a low-level case. John demanded to be assigned to the more pressing cases that plagued the department. When Ramsey belittled John and asked Antonio if he felt the same way, Antonio chose not to side with John. After Ramsey left, John accused Antonio of sucking up to Ramsey, which led to a heated argument between the two. Antonio remarked that John could afford to get on Ramsey's bad side, but Antonio stated that he had a child to support and could not risk losing his job. Later, Antonio wondered if Talia shared John's opinion. Talia told Antonio that she understood his position, but Antonio appeared to be unconvinced and lashed out at Talia. Feeling a touch of guilt, Antonio later apologized to her. When Talia suggested they meet up after work, Antonio stated that he had some business to take care of. Before Talia could convince Antonio to reconsider, Ramsey ordered Antonio into his office. \n\n\nInside the commissioner's office, Ramsey gave Antonio a new assignment. Ramsey informed Antonio that he would head a special task force assigned to the Angel Square area. Ramsey appeared intrigued that Antonio grew up in Angel Square. When Antonio suggested that Officer Sahed be assigned to his team, Ramsey stated that he had other plans for Talia-Talia would soon become John's partner. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Todd told Blair that he wanted to move the family back into the penthouse in an attempt to keep Cole away from Starr. Blair reminded Todd that the prospective owner was preparing to close on the penthouse at any time, and didn't feel the new owner would allow Todd to renege on the deal. Todd was convinced he could make the new owner a deal he couldn't refuse. Meanwhile, Langston demanded to know why Starr broke up with Cole in a letter. When Starr admitted that she heard Cole outside her window the previous night, Langston was appalled that Starr didn't answer him. Adamantly, Starr told Langston that she had to break up with Cole in order to protect him. Realizing that Todd was blackmailing Starr, Langston told her friend that what her father was doing to her was wrong. \n\n\nStarr quietly observed Todd playing with Sam. As Starr listened, Todd told his son that it would kill him to lose Sam again. Minutes later, Starr attempted to leave the house, but was met by Shaun at the front door. After Shaun refused to allow Starr to leave without him, Starr took off with Shaun following close behind. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Cole was depressed. Jared attempted to comfort Cole, but was interrupted by a phone call from Natalie. When he learned that Natalie had taped the entire conversation between Renee and Nigel, Jared was alarmed. After realizing that Natalie had inadvertently taped his \"private\" conversation with Nigel, Jared nearly panicked. Natalie told Jared she was compiling a report based on her findings in the taped recording; she was still in the process of listening to the entire tape. In an attempt to prevent Natalie from hearing his conversation with Nigel on the tape, Jared told Natalie that a particular job required her immediate attention. While Natalie took care of the assignment, Jared planned to alter the tape somehow. Nigel expressed concern when Jared informed him that Natalie recorded the conversation. Before heading to Buchanan Enterprises, Jared asked Nigel to look after Cole. When John dropped by to check on Cole, he wasn't surprised to hear that Starr had ended her relationship with Cole. John advised Cole to stay away from Starr, and warned him that Todd could cause him a great deal of trouble. John promised to check on Cole later, and asked Nigel to keep an eye on Cole. Later, Langston dropped by and asked Cole to attend a counseling session with her. When Cole refused, Langston attempted to cheer her friend up and told him that Starr was still in love with him. Unconvinced, Cole sulked as he walked away. \n\n\nWhen Gigi arrived at B.E., Natalie instructed her to transcribe the taped conversation. Jared arrived and found Gigi listening to the tape. Jared told Gigi that he needed her to deliver some important documents to Rex. Once Gigi had left, Jared listened to the tape. Jared quickly began to erase parts of Gigi's report-the section containing his conversation with Nigel. As Jared attempted to delete the actual tape, Natalie entered the office and demanded to know what Jared was doing there. Jared gave Natalie an excuse, but Natalie insisted that he leave and allow her to finish the report alone. A few moments later, Natalie placed a call to someone and stated, \"How fast can you get down here? I just found something that could affect the whole family.\" \n\n\nWhile Rex was in the shower, Adriana phoned and Gigi appeared at Rex's door. Rex missed Adriana's call, but greeted Gigi at the door wearing a towel. When Gigi presented Rex with Jared's paperwork, Rex asked Gigi to help him search through the B.E. files. As Gigi noticed pictures of Rex and Adriana in the apartment, Gigi had a flashback of her conversation with Shane concerning keeping secrets. Turning away from Rex, a guilt-ridden Gigi stated she had a confession to make to Rex. In tears, Gigi admitted lying to both Shane and Rex. As Gigi blurted out, \"I can't do this anymore. Shane is your son, you are Shane's father,\" she was horrified to turn around and find a stunned Adriana standing in the doorway. \n\n\nMarcie was surprised to open her apartment door and find Starr standing there. Starr had a request for Marcie. Starr stated, \"You need to take your son back from my dad.\" \n\n\nAs Todd knocked on the door of his penthouse, he screamed, \" Open up, I'm here to make you the deal of your life.\" Seconds later, Ramsey appeared at the door and asked, \"What do you want?\" \n\n\nAfter rushing into Natalie's office, Jared was startled to find John there. As John looked on, Natalie informed Jared, \"You should know up-front why John is here. I feel this is a matter for the police.\"\n\n\n",

Jared remembers his conversation with Nigel in which Nigel had suggested that Jared tell the Buchanans that he is not a Buchanan. Natalie asks Gigi to transcribe the meeting that she and Jared had had with Nigel and Renee. Natalie meets up with Jared in the hall. Natalie tells him that she had to go to a meeting. Jared opens the door to Natalie's office and sees Gigi sitting behind the desk, with the tape recorder playing. Jared gives Gigi something else to do just in order to get Gigi out of the office. John and Antonio begin to argue over Ramsey. Natalie walks in on Jared, erasing the tape. She wants to know what he is doing. John visits Cole.
