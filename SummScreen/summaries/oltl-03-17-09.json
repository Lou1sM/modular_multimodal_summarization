It soon became clear that T\u00e9a believed that Todd had stabbed Blair. Todd insisted that he had nothing to do with the crime, but T\u00e9a wasn't swayed. She reminded Todd that Blair had a restraining order against him at the time of the incident. Todd steadfastly denied trying to kill his ex-wife. He claimed that he could never harm the mother of his children. \n\n\nT\u00e9a realized that Todd was still in love with Blair. Todd denied it; he said he was in love with Marty. T\u00e9a told Todd that it was possible to love two people at the same time. T\u00e9a believed that, whether Todd was willing to admit it or not, Todd loved Blair. However, regardless of how Todd felt about Blair, T\u00e9a refused to represent Todd. T\u00e9a promised to refer Todd to another attorney before she turned her back on Todd then walked out of the jail. \n\n\nViki went to the hospital to visit Dorian and check on Blair's condition. Viki had difficulty understanding why Todd would attack Blair in such a brutal manner. Dorian admitted that she didn't believe Todd had stabbed Blair. Dorian explained that she had overheard Todd talking to Starr. Dorian thought that Todd had told the truth when he swore to Starr that he had not attacked Blair. \n\n\nDorian shared her suspicions that Ray Montez had been Blair's assailant. Unfortunately, Dorian's theory had a kink in it because Moe had given Ray an alibi for the time of the stabbing. Viki realized that if Todd and Ray weren't guilty of the crime, then the person who had attacked Blair remained at large. \n\n\nA short time later Addie arrived at the hospital. She brought Jack and Sam to visit Blair. Dorian was reluctant to let the children see their mother, but Addie thought it was important for the boys to talk to Blair. After Dorian relented, Addie took Jack and Sam into Blair's room. Sean, who had accompanied Addie and the boys to the hospital, apologized to Dorian for not being on hand when Blair had been attacked. Dorian waved away his apologies; she told him he had nothing to be sorry for. \n\n\nWhen Addie, Jack, and Sam walked out of Blair's room, Jack was upset. He asked Dorian if his mother was going to recover. Dorian's impulse was to sugarcoat it, but Addie instructed her sister to be honest with Jack. \n\n\nLater, Addie thanked Dorian for being a mother to Blair during the years Addie had been institutionalized. Addie confessed that it had given her great comfort knowing that Blair had been well cared for. Addie welled up with tears as she admitted that she couldn't bear to lose Blair. \n\n\nAfter Viki left the hospital, she went to visit Todd in jail. \n\n\nNora went to Cole's room, where she found him alone. Cole explained that his mother had gone to get something to drink. Nora didn't appear concerned about Marty's absence as she updated Cole on Matthew's prognosis. \n\n\nCole was visibly shaken after Nora revealed that Matthew's paralysis was permanent. Her anger was palpable as she told Cole that it had been Cole's choice to take drugs, but Matthew hadn't been given the same option. According to Nora, Matthew would never be able to engage in sports or do the things he once dreamed of doing. \n\n\nCole told Nora that if he could trade places with Matthew, he would. Nora responded that she would let Cole take Matthew's place in a wheelchair. Nora wondered what kind of person that made her. Cole tried to defend Nora, but she was too angry to care. She warned Cole that he was going to go to prison for his crime. Nora explained that under normal circumstances, someone's first conviction for driving under the influence resulted in a slap on the wrist. However, Cole had caused great bodily harm when he had climbed behind the wheel of a car while high on drugs. \n\n\nNora advised Cole to prepare himself. She told Cole that his doctors were going to release him later that day. Nora suggested that Cole get himself dressed and contact a good attorney because she intended to have Cole taken into custody, transported to the police station, and booked for driving under the influence. \n\n\nIn a nearby waiting lounge, Marty and John talked about Cole's situation. John offered to have some of his friends at the police station look into the matter, but Marty declined John's help. Marty was filled with self-loathing because she had failed her son. Marty also felt guilty because of Blair's fight for life. Marty believed that Blair had been vulnerable to the attacker because Marty had called John away from Blair. \n\n\nJohn assured Marty that what had happened to Blair was not Marty's fault. John speculated that Blair had been a victim of someone who had targeted her; it had not been a random crime of opportunity. John's theory stunned Marty. She couldn't believe that someone had been stalking Blair, patiently waiting to attack her. Marty wondered if Todd could be capable of such a crime. John didn't dismiss the possibility. \n\n\nThe conversation returned to Cole when Marty admitted that her memories of loving her son had returned. Marty also confided that all of the rage she had felt over what Todd had done to her had turned into nothingness. It was that empty feeling that had prompted Marty to act so recklessly in recent months. Marty realized that she needed to find a way to make sense of all of that if she hoped to move forward. \n\n\nShortly after Marty left, John made a phone call. He asked the person on the other end to meet him at the hospital on an urgent matter. Later, T\u00e9a showed up at the hospital. John told T\u00e9a that they needed to talk about Todd. \n\n\nMarty returned to Cole's room. Cole was upset after Nora's visit. When he told his mother that everyone would be better off with him dead, Marty embraced her son tightly. Cole seemed resigned to his fate. He believed that he deserved to rot in jail for what he had done to Matthew. \n\n\nA short time later, Nora went to Cole's room. A police officer accompanied her. When they found Marty alone in Cole's room, Nora was furious. \n\n\nCole slowly made his way to Matthew's room. Matthew was awake and alert when Cole opened the door. As the two young men stared at each other, neither said a word. \n\n\nCris went to Silver Springs, Maryland, to visit Evangeline. Cris told a comatose Evangeline that he missed her. He admitted that Evangeline was the only person who could set him straight. As Cris poured his heart out, admitting to mistakes that he had made with Sarah and Vanessa, he was unaware that Layla eavesdropped from the doorway. When Cris wondered if his attachment to Evangeline was part of the reason that his relationships with other women had failed, Layla spoke up. \n\n\nLayla couldn't believe that Cris had the audacity to suggest that he couldn't keep his zipper up because of his lingering feelings for her sister. She told Cris that Evangeline would be offended. Layla suggested that Cris visit a priest if he wanted to confess his sins. As Layla ranted at Cris, Cris realized that Layla was more upset about men in general rather than Cris specifically. \n\n\nCris told Layla that perhaps it wasn't the men in Layla's life who were the problem, but Layla herself who was. He told Layla that Fish had been infatuated with Layla, but she had not given him the time of day. Cris didn't think Layla had any reason to be upset because Fish had moved on with someone else after Layla repeatedly rejected him. Cris told Layla that she was nothing like her sister. \n\n\nAfter Cris left, Layla returned to Evangeline's bedside. She was worried that Cris might have been right to accuse of her being \"a man-hating bitch.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody wonders what will happen with Blair's injury. Tea admits to Todd that she's withdrawn from being his lawyer and considers the possibility that he stabbed Blair, murdered Wes Granger and murdered Lee Halpern. Nora tells Cole she's going to prosecute him and get him convicted of a felony for what he did to Matthew. Marty wants to help her son but does not know how to. Cristian Vega goes to see a comatose Evangeline while she stays in the private place where her mother is keeping her in Maryland. He confesses to her that maybe he's always been in love with her and so he has failed to commit to Sara or know what he was getting himself into with Vanessa. Layla overhears and rips into him about what a coward he is. He tells her that she has her own problems and shouldn't be judging him. It looks like Evangeline might come back.",
