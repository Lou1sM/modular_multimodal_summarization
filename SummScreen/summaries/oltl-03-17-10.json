    "soap_central": "\n...and Baby Makes Three\n\n\nBo arrived at Rodi's in full dress uniform, ready for a rousing St. Patrick's Day with John and other members of the Llanview police force.  Grabbing a mug of green beer, Bo was eager to celebrate the luck of the Irish, but he couldn't help but notice his top cop's ambivalence and distracted demeanor.  He knew John was focused on something other than the celebration, and pushed him to spill the beans.  After much prodding, John revealed that Marty was pregnant.\n\n\nBo was delighted by the news and offered hearty congratulations, yet John's happiness seemed muted.  Bo gushed about the joys of parenthood, and said that John would be a good father and a changed man.  When he asked about John and Marty making it official and tying the knot, however, John grew taciturn.  He admitted he didn't know when or if he and Marty would marry, and said they hadn't thought through their future plans.  Bo reassured John that, with the new addition to their lives, everything would fall into place.\n\n\nAs John opened a bottle of Irish whiskey, Bo continued to needle him about his anxieties.  John insisted he wasn't afraid of parenthood, and asked Bo to leave it at that.  Ever the detective, Bo kept pushing, and urged John to unburden himself about what was bothering him, if not Marty and the baby.  Lost in his thoughts, John flashed back to his recent kiss with Natalie.\n\n\nOutside Llanfair, Marty left a voicemail message for Cole and asked him to call her for some \"good news.\"  When Marty rang the bell, she got Natalie at the front door.  Perturbed, Marty said she was looking for Jessica, but Natalie explained that her sister wasn't home.  Before Marty could leave, Natalie asked her to wait, as Natalie owed Marty an apology for telling John about Marty's pregnancy.\n\n\nTurning frosty, Marty told Natalie that she would've liked to tell her boyfriend about their baby before his ex-girlfriend, but it was water under the bridge; what mattered was that Marty and John were together, and John was happy.  Noticing Natalie's stricken face, Marty asked Natalie if she was surprised to hear that John was taking the pregnancy in stride.  Natalie played off her discomfort, and admitted that she and John had never discussed children during their relationship.  Her tone icy, Marty told Natalie that she and John were secure, and wanted to pursue a family and a future together.\n\n\nNatalie said she wished Marty and John all the best, then asked if there was a wedding in their future.  Stung, Marty said it was up in the air.  Natalie apologized again, and Marty asked what Natalie was sorry for \"this time.\"  Natalie laid it on thick as she explained that she still felt guilty about the kisses she and John had shared - first when she was delusional, and then again, when they'd both known what they were doing.\n\n\nMarty dismissed John and Natalie's lapse, and said it didn't matter, but Natalie said it did, because it would never happen again; it had only been \"old chemistry\" surfacing during a crisis.  She respected John and Marty's relationship, and she promised Marty that she and John were only friends.  \"Good luck,\" Natalie told her.  As Marty left and Natalie closed the door behind her, both women took a moment to collect themselves from their disturbing encounter.\n\n\nAt Llanview University, Langston was startled when Markko started knocking on Ford's office door.  As Markko called to Ford from behind the closed door, Langston raced to get dressed, and finished just in time for Markko to enter the office.  When Markko asked what she was doing there, Langston claimed she'd been looking for him.  \"In Ford's office?\" Markko asked quizzically.  Langston said she'd thought Markko would be there, working on his film treatment with Ford.\n\n\nMarkko bought Langston's story, but noticed something out of place: the lower button on her blouse had gone missing.  Mortified, Langston said she'd lost it at home, and Markko offered her his coat to cover herself.  Markko asked if she had his project folder, as they'd misplaced each other's at home; Langston handed his over, but asked him where her script for her musical was.  When she realized Markko had left the script with Starr, Langston was terrified, and rushed off to Llanview High to avert catastrophe. She pecked Markko a goodbye kiss.  After she left, Markko stayed behind to leave Ford a note with his project, but discovered something else on the floor - Langston's missing button.\n\n\nIn the dormitories, Cole struggled to rouse Hannah from her drug-induced slumber, and was alarmed to find an empty bottle of sleeping pills on her nightstand.  Cole asked her how many pills she'd taken, but Hannah was groggy and barely responsive to his questions.  Frightened, Cole dragged her to her feet, and carried her to the bathroom in order to flush out her system.\n\n\nAfter helping Hannah cough up the pills, Cole helped her back into the bedroom, and handed her a glass of water.  He wanted to take her to the infirmary, but Hannah didn't want to go, nor did she want his help, or his questions; she pleaded with him to go, and leave her alone to recuperate.  Cole told her he wouldn't leave until she told him the truth about whether or not she'd intentionally overdosed, and why.  Hannah attempted to walk away from him, but collapsed to the floor and sobbed.  As Cole took the hysterical girl in his arms, Hannah wept on his shoulder.\n\n\nAt Llanview High, Starr was horrified to discover that Langston's new musical was all about her and Cole's life together.  Starr felt betrayed, as Langston had promised her she wouldn't write about them.  Danielle told her that Langston obviously couldn't be trusted anymore.  Starr hurried down the hall to call Langston and read her the riot act.\n\n\nIn Cristian's classroom, Jessica ordered Blair to get her \"slutty hands off my boyfriend!\"  Cristian reminded Jessica once more that he was not her boyfriend, but there was no reasoning with the addled Mrs. Brennan, who raked Blair over the coals for going \"cougar\" with younger men. Jessica accused Blair of sleeping around because \"Uncle Todd\" had dumped her and didn't want her anymore.  Blair shot back that Cristian didn't want Jessica anymore, and told her that time had marched on.  Cris reminded Jessica that he was with Layla, but Jessica didn't believe it; she was sure he was merely confused, and that they were meant to be together.  She castigated Blair for standing in the way of her and Cristian's destined love: \"You obviously need some help!\"\n\n\nExasperated, Blair split, abandoning Cristian and Jessica to their argument.  In the corridor, she found Starr, who was leaving Langston an angry voicemail.  When Starr unloaded on her mother about Langston's deceit, Blair believed Starr had uncovered Ford and Langston's affair, but when Starr explained the situation with the musical and realized they were talking about two different subjects, she asked Blair what secret Langston had told Blair instead.\n\n\nJust then, Danielle arrived, overcome by the power of Langston's prose; she told her sister that, real or not, Starr and Cole's story was heartbreaking and would make for great entertainment.  Danielle was particularly impressed with how Langston had nailed Todd's horrible behavior, but for Starr, that was the worst part, as she was forced to recall what Todd had done to Cole when he'd found the teens in bed together.  Danielle couldn't believe that Starr and Blair were so willing to sweep Todd's crimes under the rug for the sake of keeping the peace, but Starr said that was just the way it was; \"he's my dad.\"  As Danielle left for class, she urged Starr to reconsider her opinion of the musical, since it did have a happy ending.\n\n\nAlone with her mother, Starr was still fuming; she couldn't believe Langston hadn't even changed any of the names in her life story.  Blair told Starr to relax, and assured the girl that Starr and Langston could work things out by sitting down and talking about the problem.  Irked, Starr asked Blair if she knew Langston better than Starr, and asked Blair again what secret Blair was keeping for Langston.  Anxious, Blair said it was nothing and hurried off to pick up Jack.\n\n\nBack in Cristian's classroom, Cris informed Jessica that he and Blair were only friends; their romance was long since over, and they'd only been together after Cris and Jessica had broken up.  Enraged, Jessica demanded to know how many other women he'd been with since they'd parted ways, and Cristian admitted he'd been married to Natalie.  Jessica was stunned that Cris had wed her twin sister and dated her little cousin, Sarah, but he told her she had no room to talk, as she'd married Antonio.\n\n\nJessica refused to believe that they'd been so \"untrue\" to each other, but Cristian said they'd merely grown up and lived their lives.  He pleaded with her to understand, but Jessica said she never could and never would.  As she raced down the hall in hysterics, Cristian hurried after her, and passed Langston in the corridor.\n\n\nLangston dodged Cristian and Jessica, but turned the corner to find Starr waiting for her at the musical sign-up booth.  Livid, Starr flung the musical at Langston's feet.  \"How dare you?\" she snapped.\n\n\nAt the Sun, Todd waited patiently at his desk as a burly limousine driver dragged a kicking and screaming Kelly into Todd's office by lugging her over his shoulder.  As Kelly raged about her abduction and imprisonment, Todd told the driver to guard the door while he and his former in-law talked business.  Kelly was furious about being kidnapped, but Todd winced at the turn of phrase; \"kidnap's a bit of a harsh word.\"  He saw his tactics merely as friendly persuasion, and suggested they be friends.\n\n\nDesperate, Kelly called her airline to book another flight to London, but discovered that all recent flights were booked.  Beaten, she turned to Todd, who launched into another sales pitch about her going to work for him at the paper.  Kelly told Todd she'd sooner stick needles in her eyes, and slammed his caveman tactics with women.  \"It worked for King Kong,\" Todd reasoned.  He offered her a lucrative contract, full of options for outside projects, and said he'd even become the primary donor for the charity of her choice.\n\n\nKelly considered Todd's offer, then promptly tore up the contract, and flung the shreds into the air; she told him his \"fake philanthropy\" had nothing to do with turning over a new leaf and everything to do with impressing Danielle.  His cheap theatrics hadn't worked before, and wouldn't work on a second try.  Todd insisted that his interest in Kelly had nothing to do with Danielle; he called her a good person who he wanted on his staff to improve the Sun.\n\n\nKelly scoffed at the platitudes and said she was the furthest thing from a good person - she'd done terrible things, such as cheating on Kevin, stealing Max from Blair, and running Blair off the road, which caused Blair's miscarriage.  Reflecting on her relationship with her cousin, she concluded that Blair hated her because of what she'd done; \"why wouldn't she?\"  With that, a lightbulb went off in Kelly's head, and she accused Todd of using her to get to Blair.\n\n\nTodd said his offer had nothing to do with Blair, but Kelly was unconvinced, and asked him what his latest beef with his ex was.  Todd claimed that Blair had ruined his new life with T\u00e9a and kept the secret of Danielle from him, but Kelly reminded him that if not for Blair's tenacity, T\u00e9a might have kept Danielle from Todd forever.  Todd said it didn't matter. as Danielle would never get to know him. Kelly said Danielle would, eventually.\n\n\nTodd said that Blair aside, Kelly was qualified to help him revamp the Sun, and he wanted to start anew with her help.  However, Kelly wouldn't budge - she didn't want to be a pawn between him and Blair.  As she spoke, Blair burst into the office, shocked to find Todd and Kelly together. \n\n\n",
