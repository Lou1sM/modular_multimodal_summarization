    "soap_central": "\n How Are Things in Glocca Llanview? \n\n\n\n\n\"How dare you,\" Starr furiously shot out at her best friend as they headed into an empty classroom at Llanview High. She couldn't believe that Langston had written her musical about Starr and Cole. Langston insisted that her friends had the \"greatest love story ever\" and while she had attempted to write about other subjects, she had been unsuccessful. Starr thought that a good subject would have been Langston's own story with Markko instead of the intimate details of Starr's life. Langston thought the details were fabulous.\n\n\nStarr was dismayed when she thought about Langston's relationship with Markko. She thought the couple was always fighting and that Langston had been acting strangely. She was also always disappearing. She was pretty sure that Langston was hiding something and shutting Starr out. Langston chalked up her behavior to pressure from getting the musical finished and the fact that Markko constantly wanted to be with her. She added that she loved Markko but wasn't so sure about him being her \"one and only.\" Starr recalled that she and Cole had experienced their own set of problems in the past.\n\n\nLangston was curious and wondered if Starr had any doubts about being with Cole forever. Starr admitted that she no longer had doubts as she had previously. They were together and looking after their daughter. Langston declared that Starr's story was amazing, and Starr reluctantly agreed. She frowned as Langston asked for permission to continue with the love story of Starr and Cole for her musical.\n\n\nCristian chased after a crying Jessica, who asked that he just leave her alone. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" he replied. She sobbed that everything and everyone had changed, and all she wanted was Cristian. She remembered planning their future as if it were only \"yesterday\" and she wanted things back to the way they were as she recalled them. Cristian voiced his concern for her, and Jessica reminded him of how they had met. \n\n\nJessica flashed back to the high school scene when he had bounded to her rescue during a dance. He admitted that he remembered all too well, but it was in the past. He had moved on and so had she, he told her. They were living in different worlds. Jessica thought that they had been in different worlds when they met but that it had been the beginning.\n\n\nCristian shook his head and pointed out that it was not a good idea to take a trip down memory lane. He needed to leave, he told Jessica. She quickly accused him of always running away from her; however, they had also always ended up together, she said demurely. She continued to talk about their early meetings in high school and recalled their first kiss after Cristian had created a sketch of her from memory. Jessica and Cristian looked into each other's eyes.\n\n\nIn her dorm room at Llanview University, Hannah confessed to Cole that she hadn't wanted to kill herself but merely wanted to close her eyes and forget her problems. She sniveled that she had let herself be used, and the teaching assistant she had been close with had refused to let her into his office. It was apparent he was with or waiting for another girl. She was thrown away like nothing, she concluded. Cole offered to call his mother so that Hannah would have someone to talk to, since his mother was a psychiatrist. The young woman refused and noted that she had Cole to talk to.\n\n\nCole didn't think he could be as much help as a professional, but Hannah felt otherwise. She advised Cole that he had saved her life. Cole stressed that no guy was worth what she had done and that she was certainly a better person than the T.A. He assured her that she was beautiful, smart, and funny, and some day she would find the right guy. Hannah looked at Cole adoringly as he spoke.\n\n\nCole admitted that he had been addicted to painkillers and disclosed that he was an addict. He had hit rock bottom when he had no one to talk to, as his mother wasn't available to him. He got through it because of Starr, his counselor Rachel, and lots of forgiving people, he informed her.\n\n\nCole retrieved some snacks for Hannah from the snack machine and again suggested that Hannah speak to a doctor or his mother. Hannah agreed to seek help at the school psychiatric services department. She had one favor to ask of Cole, and she pleaded with him not to tell anyone what she had done. He promised to keep quiet.\n\n\nBlair couldn't believe her eyes when she walked into Todd's office at the Sun and found Kelly there with him. \"What's going on?\" she demanded to know. Kelly kept it short and stated that she had been detained on her way back to England, but Todd advised his ex-wife that Kelly was going to work for him. \"The hell she is,\" Blair snarled. \"What makes you think I won't take this job?\" Kelly countered. Blair pointed out that Kelly's son and life were in London, though Todd insisted that Kelly was going to be his right-hand and he would be expanding his paper's Internet site for her.\n\n\nLaughing, Blair recalled the last time Kelly had been employed for the paper and ruined it, though Kelly was thrilled to advise her cousin that Dorian had also asked her to run Craze. She pointed out how Blair had driven readers away from that magazine when she was in charge. Blair called Kelly incompetent while Kelly informed her cousin that she had many readers on her blog site. Blair was pretty sure that Todd only wanted to hire Kelly to \"piss\" Blair off. Todd managed to get a word into the loud and growing spat and claimed that he hadn't even thought about Blair when he asked Kelly to work for him. Todd could only smile to himself when Kelly accused Blair of being jealous and worried that Kelly was going to sleep with Todd.\n\n\nInsistent that she didn't care who Todd slept with, Blair charged Todd with \"scraping the bottom of the barrel.\" The argument escalated as Kelly reminded Blair that Blair had slept with Kevin when Kelly was married to him. As the women shouted and hurled accusations at each other, Todd remained quiet, short of making a quick business call. Finally, Blair advised Kelly that she didn't like her cousin and didn't want to see her.\n\n\n\"The tramp is right,\" Kelly stated. She did plan on returning to London and had never really considered taking the job with Todd, though she could return after the school year, and Dorian had already offered her a place to stay at La Boulaie. Blair reminded Kelly of Blair's unborn child that Kelly had killed, and Blair was pleased that Kelly was leaving after all. That was all that Kelly needed as she abruptly turned around and signed Todd's contract.\n\n\nAs the St. Patrick's Day celebration grew rowdy at Rodi's, Bo tried to get John to confide in him. He knew there was something that John was not telling him, and he felt certain there was something standing in John's way of happiness. \"Not anymore,\" John stated. He had everything under control, he added. When John made a comment about Marty's pregnancy to Bo, Brody and Oliver overheard and excitedly congratulated him. Brody was depressed when he thought about Jessica and the fact that they had talked about having children together.\n\n\nOliver couldn't believe that he had asked John's advice about being a father, and John was the one expecting a baby. John brusquely noted the coincidence. Bo made a toast to John, who was a hero and had fought his way through several dangerous incidents. He was about to face the scariest but must rewarding road. John made a toast in memory of his father. Bo gently pressed John for more insight into what was bothering him, but John avoided further discussion. He played \"Danny Boy\" on the jukebox, and the inebriated crowd of off-duty police officers sang along.\n\n\nOver at Foxy Roxy's, Roxy was in a celebratory mood and dressed like a leprechaun. She listened as Natalie accused her of knowing about Marty's pregnancy when Roxy visited Natalie at Llanfair. She realized that Roxy was only trying to protect Natalie when Roxie had warned Natalie to stay away from John. Natalie assured Roxy that there was nothing going on with John, and she felt as though the only reason she felt something for John in the first place was because of their history. She was still mourning Jared, who was the true love of her life, and didn't want to be a home wrecker with Marty being pregnant.\n\n\nThe women were interrupted when Nora and Layla arrived and heard part of the conversation. Natalie was feeling guilty when she realized she had just inadvertently disclosed Marty's pregnancy to two more people.\n\n\nRoxy kept the green beer flowing as Nora recollected her past and what she went through when she lost her own memory. Nothing had changed for her, though, she told everyone. Roxy thought it would be a good idea for John to be numbed like Jessica, so that he could just remember his past with Natalie. Horrified, Natalie insisted that was the last thing she wanted. Layla pointed out that Jessica was living in the past and loving it, though Nora quickly pointed out that anyone would want to live in a time that was much easier.\n\n\nLayla confessed that she was not upset about Jessica and Cristian, especially after all that Natalie had been through. She felt badly for Brody, though. Suddenly, there was a piercing scream. Roxy was distraught as she announced that she had run out of beer. The women headed to Rodi's.\n\n\nReluctantly, Starr acknowledged that everyone in school already knew her story and the part of Langston's script that she had read was amazing. Langston felt obligated to write another musical because she didn't want to pressure Starr. Their friendship was too important, she believed, and if she had to write a musical in one day, she would. Starr declared that it would be a good way to leave her mark on the high school and slowly gave Langston the okay to use her musical. \"You did nail my dad, by the way,\" Starr advised her friend.\n\n\nStarr wanted to get Cole's stamp of approval before Langston considered the musical a done deal. She also wanted Langston to work on the Langston and Markko happy ending. After Starr left, Langston made a phone call. She told an unknown person, \"I really need to see you.\"\n\n\nHannah apologized for putting the work on their project on hold, but Cole assured her it was fine. He offered to stay if she needed him to, and she admitted that she didn't want to be alone. Starr called, and Cole told her he was still with Hannah. She offered to meet him at the library, but he advised her he'd see her at home.\n\n\nA plastered Roxy grabbed an equally drunk Oliver to dance at Rodi's while Nora and Bo hit the dance floor to show off their moves. Layla and Brody commiserated with each other briefly and decided to dance instead. \"Good times,\" John toasted Natalie.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Langston admits to Starr that she is envious of Starr and Cole's relationship that seems to be complete. Yet she doesn't let on as to why she is not complete with Markko. Meanwhile Cole helps a distraught Hannah who was popping pills over the hurt of being forgotten by Ford. Jessica relives when she first met Cristian and they started dating years ago as high school students. He remembers but urges her to know they've both moved on. Bo and Nora are successfully together. Yet Brody is incomplete with Jessica's present state. Oliver appears happy. John is incomplete with the fact that Marty is pregnant. Layla wishes Jessica would get over Cristian. And Natalie is not certain what to do with John. Blair and Kelly argue and appear competitive while Todd is determined to get Kelly to work with him on the Sun.",
