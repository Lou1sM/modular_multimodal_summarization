    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Llantano Mountain Lodge, Cris and Blair faced the morning after their sexcapades. Down the hall, Todd and Evangeline had a much more dressed awakening. Blair and Cris agreed that they don't \"looooove each other,\" so the sex was purely revenge on their exes. Blair couldn't admit she does looooove Todd. Todd was eager to change Evangeline's status from \"platonic friend\" but she wasn't so hyped...especially when Todd implied he would tell Cris they \"slept together.\" Blair told Cristian all about her daughter's star-crossed love and kept denying she still loves Todd. \"Do I have to sleep with everybody in this town to prove it?\" Layla, who walked in, was another story. More luckily, she agreed to keep pal Cris' secret. Evangeline walked up on their hug and misconstrued the whole thing! Vange told Cris she hadn't slept with Todd and a wounded Layla decided to let her sister \"believe what she wants.\" When Blair came back, Cris told her about the Vange/Todd non-sex. \"Oops. I guess we got it screwed up,\" chuckled Blair. \"But it was fun, wasn't it?\" Not having much fun, Evangeline told Todd Cris slept with Layla. \n\n\nRex awoke snuggling with Adriana and removed Tate's hand from Adriana's rear. It only got more awkward when they both woke up. The minute third wheel-Tate left, Rex and Adriana lustily celebrated their anniversary. In the lobby, Miles was bummed about the roads clearing, sighing, \"I wish we could stay here forever!\" Marty decided to stay downstairs with Miles rather than tangle with Blair. Nearby, Tate questioned Layla about the object of his affection. Post-coital Rex and Adriana came downstairs and agreed to meet up later. Curious Miles made Rex's acquaintance and asked him about love. Rex gave him a quick chemistry lesson and then Miles tried his new skills on Marty. In search of a shower, Adriana walked in on Tate...who apparently likes to pose in the buff with his hands on his hips. Nonplussed, Tate said they could shower together. He generously included Rex in the invite when he arrived.  \"Nobody is showering with anybody!\" Adriana cried, deciding to wait till she got home. Rex got in a potshot about half-dressed Tate feeling the chill before they left. \n\n\n\"The first time is really the best,\" sighed Starr, kissing Cole. Though they teased the viewers with having \"done it,\" conversation revealed they were glad they'd waited. They had a hot (if you're a teen) makeout session. Starr was sure that vengeful Britney wasn't done plotting against them, though \u2014 and she'd be right! When Marty called to check on him, Cole pretended to be in Llanview. Minutes later, Starr did the same with both parents. How would they get home before their folks did? And couldn't their parents just get along? Outside, protective Langston commenced catfighting Britney. Inside, Starr and Cole actually looked to be done waiting. Unfortunately, Britney won her fight and made sure Marty overheard her talking about the would-be lovers. Marty headed up to Room 316 stat... Just as Starr and Cole finished their smooch session, Marty and Miles burst in. In quick succession, Marty found a hidden Starr and a wrapped condom. When Blair and Todd were added to the equation, fits ensued. Langston swore to make Britney pay for her mean girl machinations, Todd blamed Blair for leading by an example of \"sex and lies,\" and Marty vowed to send Cole to boarding school. \n\n\n",
