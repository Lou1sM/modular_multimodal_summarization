    "soap_central": "\nBad Hair Day\n\n\nWhile washing dishes inside the kitchen of the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Markko was pleasantly surprised when someone approached him from behind and began kissing him passionately on the neck. Assuming that it was Langston, Markko enjoyed the show of affection. \n\n\nLangston showed up at the hospital to visit Starr, who hadn't left since her mother was admitted. Starr informed a surprised Langston that Hope hadn't died from Rh disease. Langston gave Starr an overnight bag, containing her toiletries and a change of clothes so that she could remain at the hospital and by her mother's side. \n\n\nAfter calling out Langston's name, Markko was startled to turn around and discover that Lola had kissed him. She immediately apologized and said that she didn't know what had caused her to do such a thing. Lola continued to repeat that she couldn't help the fact that she had a crush on her cousin's boyfriend. She pleaded with Markko not to tell Langston about the kiss. Markko reminded Lola that he didn't tell Langston about the first time that she had kissed him. To his surprise, an angered Lola retorted, \"And I did something for you, too! I didn't tell her how much you liked it!\" \n\n\nBefore Markko could respond, Langston entered the kitchen and wondered what had taken place. Lola lied and told Langston that they were discussing Shane's medical condition. While Lola gave him a threatening look, Markko announced that he needed to speak to Langston alone. Before leaving, Lola directed a subtle threat at Markko. Sensing the tension, Langston demanded to know what had happened between her cousin and Markko. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Jared informed Natalie that he had managed to remove hair from Jessica's hairbrush. While the couple discussed doing everything possible to uncover the truth about Jessica's baby, Mike and Marcie interrupted their conversation. Marcie reminded them that Charlie had organized a donor drive for Shane at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 and wondered if Natalie and Jared planned to be tested as possible donors. Natalie said that they had stopped by the diner to be tested but the line was long and they intended to return later. \n\n\nMarcie announced that they were on their way to the diner, but they had become sidetracked because of their need to learn the truth regarding Hope's death. Citing the results of the Rh tests, Mike commented that he thought that it was possible that Cole hadn't fathered Hope, but Marcie said that Mike's conclusion was ridiculous because Starr wasn't that type of girl. While Mike stated that there was no other possible scientific explanation, Jared and Natalie appeared extremely uncomfortable. \n\n\nWhile Natalie expressed her sorrow for Mike and Marcie, Jared found it hard to believe that they might possibly have the answers to the couple's prayers. Jared reminded Natalie that they not only needed to prove that Chloe wasn't Jessica's baby - they also needed to prove that Chloe was Starr's baby. Although they had samples of Jessica's and Chloe's DNA, they also needed a specimen from Starr and Hope. \n\n\nAfter deciding that they would discover a way to get samples from Starr and Hope at a later date, Natalie and Jared gave the lab technician the samples that they had in their possession - Jessica's hair and Chloe's nail clippings. The technician promised to have the test results available as soon as possible. Jared stated that they would have to live with the results and so would Jessica. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared encountered Starr at the hospital. Starr told them that her mother's condition hadn't changed. When she stated that she planned to take a shower and get back to her mother, Natalie offered to hold her locket. Handing over her locket, Starr thanked Natalie and commented that she didn't know what she would do if she ever lost the lock of Hope's hair. \n\n\nHolding the locket, Natalie said that if the truth ever came out, they could lose Chloe and Jessica. Natalie removed a strand of Hope's hair from the locket. \n\n\nStarr returned and thanked Natalie for watching her locket. Before walking off, she stated that the lock of hair was the only thing that she had left of Hope. Presenting Natalie with Starr's toothbrush, Jared announced that he had retrieved it from her bag and that they had everything that they needed to prove Chloe's true identity. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Rex, Gigi, and Roxy entertained Shane in his room. When Roxy suggested that Shane take a walk out in the hall, they noticed a small child playing ball outside of Shane's room. The child was apparently a cancer patient, who wore a hat to cover a head that had become bald after chemotherapy. As Rex, Gigi, and Roxy watched, the small child asked Shane about his form of cancer. \n\n\nUpon learning that Shane had leukemia, the child introduced herself as Francesca and told him that she had lymphoma. When Shane appeared shocked to learn that she was a girl because she was bald, she told him that he would also lose his hair. Gigi nearly broke down when Shane asked if he would eventually look like Francesca. Roxy urged her grandson to be strong. \n\n\nDeclaring that he didn't want to wait for his hair to fall out, Shane told his parents that he wanted to shave his head. Shane wondered if he would receive a donor. Gigi assured him that they would find a match and stated that Charlie and Viki were rounding up possible donors at the diner. Shane remarked that he was aware that a blood relative would be his best chance at a match. Roxy listened as Shane stated that he wished that he had a bigger family. Gigi promised her son that they would find every living Balsom and Morasco. Consumed with guilt, Roxy thought about swabbing Rex's comatose father. \n\n\nAfter Roxy shaved his head, Shane was frantic to see his new look. When he observed his bald head in the mirror, Shane sadly said, \"I don't look like dad anymore.\" \n\n\nAlone with Roxy, Rex announced that he wanted to shave his head. Roxy asked if Rex was certain that he wanted to go through with it. He said that there was nothing that he wouldn't do for his son. Taking the razor from Roxy, Rex stated that he needed to do it himself. Rex shaved his own head. \n\n\nGigi and Shane were pleasantly surprised when they returned to Shane's room and discovered that Rex had shaved his head. A pleased Shane thanked his father. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Llanview residents gathered for breakfast and to give samples to become possible bone marrow donors for Shane. \n\n\nWith Chloe in hand, Jessica ran into Brody outside of the Buenos Dias. \n\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, with Viki's help, Charlie was organizing the campaign to help Shane find a donor. Viki thanked Officer Fish for coming to the diner and showing his support. \n\n\nStacy approached Viki and Charlie and introduced herself as Shane's aunt. Appearing wary of Stacy, Viki remarked that Gigi had told her a great deal about Stacy. Stacy stated that she wasn't surprised and admitted that she had a tense relationship with her sister. Viki was surprised when Stacy commented that she didn't know how Gigi was handling Shane's illness, because they had engaged in a terrible fight before it had been revealed that Shane had cancer. \n\n\nStacy said that she had come to the diner in hopes of learning that she was a match for Shane. She announced that she had planned to take the test at the hospital, but something came up. She had a flashback of following Roxy to the room of the comatose patient. Meanwhile, Fish noticed Stacy. \n\n\nEntering the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 together, Jessica and Brody experienced an uncomfortable silence. Brody assumed that Jessica had come to submit a sample, but was surprised when she told him that she couldn't be a donor because Tess had given her Hepatitis C. \n\n\nWhen Cris announced to Charlie that he was next in line, Layla argued that she was next. As Cris tried to calm her down, she lashed out at him and called him a jerk. Fed up with the abuse, Cris told Layla that every man in her life always left her because she was a \"bitch.\" Watching Cris walk away, Layla appeared hurt. \n\n\nFish approached Stacy and expressed his concern for Shane. Layla walked up and asked Fish if Stacy was the woman that he had dumped her for. She then accused Stacy of reaching out to her in an attempt to get close to Fish. Stacy assured Layla that she hadn't used her to get to Fish and quickly excused herself. Viki thanked Stacy for stopping by. When Charlie mentioned that it was fortunate that Stacy had arrived in town when she did, Viki gave a disapproving look. \n\n\nLayla confronted Fish and asked if he had dumped her for Stacy or because she had acted \"like a bitch.\" Fish said that Layla didn't appear interested in him, but he enjoyed when Stacy came on to him in an aggressive manner. She seemed pleased when he stated that he didn't think she had acted \"like a bitch.\" \n\n\nWhile Brody admired how beautiful Chloe was, Viki approached. Brody thanked her for her efforts to help Shane and Gigi. Alone with Jessica, Viki inquired about her relationship with Brody. Jessica told her mother that she and Brody were just friends. \n\n\nMike and Marcie arrived to be tested. Jessica asked Mike if she could be a donor, but Mike told her that her hepatitis status made that request impossible. Jessica was saddened to learn that she couldn't help Shane or anyone else. Viki told her daughter that she could be a help in some other way. Viki told Jessica that Tess had left her with a lot to deal with, but that she had overcome many obstacles - she was a great mother to both Bree and Chloe. \n\n\nMarcie smiled as she watched Jessica hold Chloe. Marcie asked if she could hold the child. Placing Chloe into Marcie's arms, Jessica said that she sometimes felt as though she didn't deserve Chloe. Viki told her daughter that she was a wonderful mother and that Tess would never do anything to hurt her again. \n\n\nMike kissed Marcie goodbye. As Marcie held Chloe, Mike watched through the window. \n\n\nJessica smiled as Brody held Chloe. Noticing that he suddenly appeared worried, Jessica asked what was wrong. Brody stated that holding Chloe made him think of Shane. He felt terrible for Shane and Gigi. He hoped that Shane would be okay. Jessica listened intently as Brody announced that he realized why he held on to a child that wasn't his. \n\n\nAs Brody prepared to leave, Jessica suggested that they hang out together, since they were friends. Brody asked if she thought that they had made the right decision when they chose to be just friends. Citing the emotional baggage that she had in her, Jessica said that she was certain that they had made the right decision. The two said a nervous goodbye and Brody left. When Marcie implied that there appeared to be chemistry between her and Brody, Jessica quickly quipped, \"We're just friends.\" Meanwhile, Brody starred at her as he left the caf\u00e9. \n\n\nStacy showed up at the testing lab and attempted to seduce the technician into taking her sample right away. \n\n\nWhile Stacy stood unnoticed in the hall, Roxy ran into the lab room and asked if her test results were in. Roxy was disappointed to learn that she wasn't a match for Shane, and asked if her friend \"John Doe\" had tested as a possible donor. The lab tech asked for John Doe's identity and stated that he was a match. Roxy flew into a rage. She couldn't believe that Rex's father was a match. \n\n\nThe technician told her that she could keep the identity of the donor a secret from the family but that the hospital needed to know. Roxy screamed, \"My son would do anything to find out who saved his son!\" When the technician asked if she wanted to save her grandson's life, Roxy insisted that John Doe valued his privacy, and ran off. \n\n\nStacy confronted Roxy and expressed her regret that Roxy wasn't a match for Shane. Roxy was stunned when Stacy told her that her friend, \"John Doe,\" could save Shane's life. \n\n\nLayla observed Cris working in the diner and called out to him. When he ignored her and walked away, she followed him. Meanwhile, Lola stood nearby and wondered what was going on in the kitchen between Markko and Langston. \n\n\nMarkko continued to deny that anything had happened between him and Lola. Langston agreed to let it go, but Markko reached out to her and gave her a passionate kiss. He proclaimed his love for her. Touched, Langston told him that she loved him, too. \n\n\nLayla followed Cris into the freezer. Cris refused to talk to her. Closing the door shut, Layla said that he wasn't going anywhere. He announced that she had locked them both inside. \n\n\nCharlie wondered why Viki appeared to dislike Stacy. She told him that Gigi had confided in her about Stacy. Viki said that both she and Gigi had sisters that they didn't trust. \n\n\nPlacing John Doe's test results in her purse, Roxy told Stacy that Stacy didn't know what she was talking about. With a devilish look, Stacy remarked, \"Stop playing games. I know your dirty little secret.\" \n\n\nAs Shane slept peacefully, Mike told Rex and Gigi that Shane was responding well to the chemotherapy treatment. They were surprised when he announced that Shane's circumstances had changed - it was vital that a bone marrow donor be located immediately.\n\n\n",
