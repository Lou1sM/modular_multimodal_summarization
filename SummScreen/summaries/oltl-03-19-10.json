Fuming, an irate Blair insisted that Kelly had accepted Todd's offer because Kelly wanted to upset Blair.  When a joyous Todd asked if Blair was jealous, Blair reminded Todd that she had moved on.  Before storming out of the office, Blair lashed out at Kelly, \"You didn't hurt me, and you're the one stuck working for a jerk!\"\n\n\nInstructing him to tear up the signed contract, Kelly informed Todd that he had accomplished his goal -- he had proved that Blair still had feelings for him.   With a smile, Kelly declared, \"Mission accomplished!\"  However, Kelly was flabbergasted, when Todd refused to let her out of the contract and announced, \"I own you now!\"   An irate Kelly informed Todd that she had signed the contract to infuriate Blair, and stated that she had no desire to leave London and work for Todd.\n\n\nWhen Kelly refused to honor her contract, Todd threatened to expose to the London press that Kevin wasn't Zane's biological father.   Todd was certain that the media would take great interest in learning that Kevin's son, Duke, had fathered Zane.   Reminding her that the contract was ironclad, Todd told Kelly that she would enjoy working at the Sun.  Cornered, Kelly reluctantly agreed, but demanded that Todd relinquish his office.   After a lengthy dispute, Todd and Kelly agreed to share the office.\n\n\nAfter leaving the office, Kelly received a call on her cell phone.  Kelly was startled when the voice on the other end whispered, \"Kelly Cramer, I need to talk to you about your mother's death!\"\n\n\nInside Elijah's hotel room, Elijah informed Gigi and Rex that it was necessary to fight dirty if they expected to receive custody of Sierra.   Citing that they had some evidence that discredited Schuyler, Elijah related that he had arranged for a social worker to conduct a home visit at Schuyler's apartment.  Elijah was convinced that Schuyler's apartment would fail the child safety test.   Insisting that T\u00e9a was using dirty tactics to help Schuyler gain custody of Sierra, Rex pressured Elijah to do the same.  Both Rex and Gigi were stunned when Elijah suggested that they get married.  Gigi and Rex had reservations, but Elijah believed that their marriage would seal the deal.\n\n\nAfter saying goodbye to Gigi and Rex, Elijah was pleasantly surprised when Blair appeared at his door and planted a kiss on him.\n\n\nAfter an intense lovemaking session, Blair told Elijah about her confrontation with Todd and Kelly.   Seething, Elijah related that he was fed up with Blair's obsession with Todd.  Insisting that she often used him to forget about Todd, Elijah declared, \"I'm tired of hearing about Todd. Until you can think about me and not Todd, don't come around!\"   Infuriated, Blair leaped out of bed and responded, \"You've just lost the best thing you ever had!\"\n\n\nAt Schuyler's apartment, T\u00e9a informed a horrified Schuyler that Elijah had arranged for a social worker to conduct a home visit.  Schuyler asked T\u00e9a if he would ultimately gain custody of Sierra Rose, but T\u00e9a refused to offer him any guarantees.   Schuyler expressed concern about the home visit, but T\u00e9a assured him that the social worker would realize that he loved his daughter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, outside of Schuyler's apartment, Allison Perkins observed the social worker as she approached Schuyler's front door.\n\n\nBack inside the apartment, Schuyler told T\u00e9a that he had doubts about taking Sierra away from Gigi.  Frustrated, T\u00e9a warned Schuyler that it was necessary to put his feelings for Gigi aside, if he wanted custody of his daughter.  Recalling her relationship with Todd, T\u00e9a stated that although she loved Todd, she ended her relationship with him in an attempt to salvage her relationship with Danielle.  Schuyler wondered if T\u00e9a still missed Todd.  Admitting that she often thought about Todd, T\u00e9a reminded Schuyler to stick to the plan, and exited the apartment.\n\n\nAfterward, dressed in the social worker's clothing, Allison dragged the unconscious social worker down the hall.\n\n\nAt Llanview High School, Jessica pleaded with Cristian to give their relationship another chance.  While Cristian insisted that their relationship was a part of his past, Jessica pleaded with Cristian to admit that he still had feelings for her.   Confessing that he still cared for her, Cristian stated that he had moved on and declared his love for Layla.  Jessica flew into a rage when Cristian refused to end his relationship with Layla.  Comforting her, Cristian reminded Jessica that she had a bright future ahead of her with Brody.  As Cristian exited the gymnasium, Jessica sat on the bleachers and wept.\n\n\nAt the St. Patrick Day celebration at Rodi's, Natalie told John that she hadn't expected to find him there, and apologized for showing up.   As Natalie spoke to John, a drunken Roxy pulled a nervous Marty onto the dance floor.   Upon spotting her, Nora and Layla approached and congratulated Marty on her pregnancy.    Natalie watched as a humiliated Marty stood silent.\n\n\nAlone with Marty, Natalie explained how Layla and Nora had overheard her discussing Marty's pregnancy with Roxy.   Before Marty could lash out at Natalie, John interrupted and asked to speak privately with Marty.   Meanwhile, Natalie stood nearby and observed Marty and John.  Marty nearly panicked when John related that a few of his co-workers had learned of her pregnancy.   Expressing concern that she hadn't told Cole about the baby, Marty stated that she was uncomfortable with so many people knowing about her pregnancy.  In an attempt to calm her nerves, John reminded Marty that their friends were happy for them.  Touched by John's words, Marty gave him a loving hug.\n\n\nWhile John and Marty embraced, Natalie couldn't keep her eyes off of them.\n\n\nNearby, Layla and Brody discussed Cristian and Jessica.   When Brody wondered why Cristian wasn't at the celebration, Layla stated, \"Wherever he is, Jessica probably followed him there!\"  Admitting their concern over Jessica's obsession with Cristian, Layla and Brody prayed that Jessica would eventually remember her life with Brody.\n\n\nLater, as Layla and Brody shared a dance, Cristian appeared and asked to dance with Layla.  When Brody inquired about Jessica, Cristian informed him that he had left Jessica back at the high school.   Once Brody left, Cristian related his most recent encounter with Jessica.  Cristian stated that he hated that he had broken Jessica's heart, but insisted that he had to.  Pleased, Layla gave Cristian a kiss and complimented him on his sensitivity.\n\n\nWhile dropping off forms for Starr, Blair ran into Jessica at the high school.   Still reeling from their intense confrontation, Blair directed a sarcastic comment at Jessica.  Upon realizing that Jessica was troubled, Blair tried to comfort her.  Apologizing for her verbal attack on Blair, Jessica related that she didn't know how to continue without Cristian.   \n\n\nBlair confessed that she had been unable to forget about Todd, and admitted that her problem was making it difficult for her to develop a relationship with someone else.   Jessica grew frustrated when Blair related that Brody truly loved Jessica.   When Blair suggested that Jessica move on and date someone else, Jessica remarked, \"How can you expect me to do something that you can't do?\"   Moved by Jessica's statement, Blair announced, \"You made me see the light!\"\n\n\nAfter offering Jessica encouragement, Blair phoned Elijah.  Upon receiving his voicemail, Blair left a message.  Blair instructed him to get dressed because she was taking him on a hot date.\n\n\nT\u00e9a showed up at Elijah's hotel room and was expecting an argument, but he surprised her by suggesting that they share a pleasant conversation instead.   When a curious Elijah asked if T\u00e9a and Todd would reunite, T\u00e9a questioned if Elijah was dating anyone.  With a look of disgust, Elijah replied, \"I was, but it wasn't serious!\"\n\n\nAfterward, Elijah offered to take T\u00e9a and Danielle out to dinner.  As Elijah left the room to shower, his cell phone rang.  Noticing that Blair was the caller, Elijah ignored the call.    T\u00e9a phoned Danielle, who related that she had plans for the evening.  Yelling in the direction of the bathroom, T\u00e9a told Elijah that they would be dining alone.   Elijah called out, \"So, it's a date!\"  With a devilish smirk, T\u00e9a mumbled, \"I promise not to talk about the case!\"\n\n\nMoments later, T\u00e9a answered Elijah's door, and was surprised to find Blair.  Before the women could exchange pleasantries, an unaware and half-dressed Elijah appeared and blurted out, \"Ready for our date?\"  While T\u00e9a and Elijah appeared stunned, Blair was livid.\n\n\nLater, Brody observed a distraught Jessica inside the gymnasium.\n\n\nAt the cottage, when Gigi announced that she wanted to visit Sierra at Schuyler's apartment, Rex begged her to reconsider.  Rex explained that he had paid Schuyler a visit and demanded that Schuyler allow Gigi to raise Sierra.  When Gigi thanked Rex for his support, he insisted that his only concern was her happiness.   Reminding him of his vow to help her, Gigi asked Rex if he would marry her.\n\n\nWhen Schuyler answered a knock on his door, Allison introduced herself as the social worker and stepped inside.  While Schuyler held the baby, Allison inspected the apartment.  After relating that his apartment had passed inspection, Allison commented that she knew Schuyler's mother.  When Allison made reference to his mother's suicide, a suspicious Schuyler asked to see Allison's identification.  Schuyler watched as Allison rambled through her purse.  Schuyler was horrified when Allison removed a gun from her purse and pointed it at him.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Tea is determined to win the case for Schuyler. But Eli is determined to win the case for Gigi. He has a social worker come by to inspect Schuyler's home to see if he's fit to raise a baby, assuming he will fail their inspection. Yet unknown to everybody, Allison knocks out the social worker, takes the badge, and tells Schuyler she is from Child Services. She reveals she knew his mother, and she pulls a gun on him. Jessica cannot let go of Cristian. Blair is still not over Todd and Eli is tired of being \"used\". She later decides to go and reconcile with him. But it's too late. He is ready to spend the evening with Tea. Todd is determined to get Kelly to work with him. But she is going to fight him for his office.",

Allison Perkins watched as a social worker conducted a home visit at Schuyller's apartment and dragged the social worker down the hall to the police station. The social worker was later found unconscious in the hall. The police were called to the scene to investigate the home visit and arrest the worker, who was later revealed to be a former social worker for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The case was settled out of court, and the judge ruled in favor of Gigi, but not before sending a letter of apology to Gigi's family. The judge also ruled that Schuyel should be allowed to keep his daughter.\n"
