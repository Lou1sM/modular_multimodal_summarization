At Capricorn, whistlin' Vince was impressed Nash had the place running and was equally impressed by Nash's dealing with his heartbreak. \"It's terminal,\" sighed Nash of his condition. Back home, Antonio offered to be Nash and Jessica's go-between (and not in the Tate way) and then he was welcomed by Jamie, Bree and Carlotta. Vince wondered if Nash was going to \"stand up and take some action.\" As Nash told Vince all about Jessica choosing her family, the camera cut to the Vega's lovely tableau. Vince didn't buy Nash's argument. Fortunately for Nash, Talia called Vince to the station. Meanwhile, Antonio promised his departing mami he'd take it easy as Jamie discovered Jessica's \"Which man do I love?\" envelope. Fortunately, Jessica covered. Just then Nash arrived, asking if they could \"bring all of this into the open.\" \n\n\nClint dropped by Llanfair to tell Viki he had plans with Dorian. \"You're jealous,\" Clint concluded when Viki shrugged things off. Cue a few rounds of firm denials and Clint marveling at Viki's \"mixed signals.\" Huffy Viki gave him a \"free pass\" to date whoever he wanted. Michael hit Foxy Roxy's to meet Marcie. Roxy was doing Dorian's manicure before her hot date and warned Dorian about Viki being competition. Under the hair dryer, Marcie chuckled at Craze's \"Is Your Man a Liar?\" quiz. Under his guilty conscience, liar Michael wasn't chuckling. Moments later, nobody was chuckling because two dudes held up the place! Michael got coshed on the head in the kerfuffle. Roxy and Dorian gave hilariously conflicting descriptions to the cops and were herded to the LPD. Back at Llanfair, Viki and Clint were still arguing like teenagers when Dorian called about the hold-up. Viki cracked up in front of Clint and slammed the door once he left. Nora came by later, sharing the joys of living with Asa and Renee. The topic soon turned back to Dorian, though. \"I fear for his life,\" Viki quipped, before admitting to being \"insanely jealous.\" Nora told Viki that if she wanted Clint, \"you're going to have to take off your gloves and knock her back to the Stone Age.\" As Viki contemplated that, Clint asked Dorian to stay at the station and look at mug shots, and promised their evening wasn't ruined. \n\n\nAt the LPD, Bo generously offered to let Natalie keep her desk job, but she missed CSI \u2014 and John. Nora then burst in asking Bo for a gun so she could murder her insurance agent. She was having trouble proving arson had felled her house. In the squad room, John and Nat ruefully admitted they were avoiding each other, and John asked her out to dinner. Nora vented her frustrations to Bo as Talia came in with a break on Capricorn's fire that pointed to...Vincent. Bo told Talia to bring Vince in. Then, the call came in about the hold-up at Foxy Roxy's and John and Natalie rushed out. Later, Vincent strolled in and told Talia someone had stolen his shoes out of his gym locker but he couldn't prove it. Instead of helping him with his shoe-napping problem, she said he was now her prime suspect. Natalie eavesdropped on the Q&A and then jumped to Vince's defense. Still at Foxy Roxy's, the brothers McBain were hashing things out and Michael wondered if John was dumping Nat at dinner. He called his brother a \"royal pain in the ass\" and told him, \"Natalie deserves the best possible, John.\" John was appalled by the Dr. Phil routine, but took it to heart when Michael said, \"Let her go before you really hurt the poor girl.\" \n\n\n",
