He says that he's crazy about Natalie, but he doesn't know if they can be together. Michael tells John not to get Natalie's hopes up about their relationship unless he's really committed to it, and Mike can see that he's not. They continue talking, and John admits that he comes with a lot of baggage. On the night of the accident, though, he knew he loved Nat, and he felt happy for the first time since Caitlin. However, the night of the accident changed both John and Natalie. Natalie's now so afraid to lose John that she doesn't live her life. Mike wonders if John's version of happiness means that John has to be alone. \n\n\nMike wants to know why John can't make a decision regarding Natalie. John explains that he doesn't want someone to protect and hover over him. Mike says that Natalie just thought she was helping out, and that she loves John a lot. John loves her, too, but he doesn't know if they can live together. Mike tells John that he can't just throw it all away. John agrees, but he needs to make a decision. Mike wants to know what it is, but John says that when he makes the decision Natalie is going to be the first to know. \n\n\nAt the police department, Natalie defends Vincent, while Talia tells Natalie to back off. Nat refuses to abandon Vincent. Talia asks Natalie what authority she has in the arson case. Natalie counters, asking if Talia is going to charge Vincent for any crimes. Talia says she isn't at the moment, and Nat declares the discussion over. Talia tells Vincent not to leave town, and leaves the police department.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Roxy sees a mugshot of a guy she used to date. Dorian is fed up with looking through the photos and wants to leave to get her date with Clint started. They leave, and Marcie and Roxy continue to look through the pictures. Roxy then starts going on about her love life, which exasperates Marcie. She convinces Roxy to focus on finding the pictures of the robbers. Mike arrives and Marcie asks about John. Mike tells her that John stopped off somewhere in the building, and says that's a good thing after getting a glimpse of Natalie and Vincent together. \n\n\nVincent is impressed by Natalie's passion in defending him. Nat asks Vincent what he's going to do about the potential charges. Vincent isn't worried, especially with Natalie vouching for him. Nat wonders if she's taking over Vincent's life, but he tells her not to worry. He thinks it's sweet that Natalie defended him because he has very few people in his corner. He takes her hand, just as John walks in. \n\n\nJohn wants to know what's going on. Natalie explains that Talia was giving Vincent some trouble and she put a stop to it. John asks Nat to dinner at the Palace. She tells Vincent that she's leaving, and Vincent thanks her again for being on his side. Mike and Marcie leave Roxy to look at the mugshots. John and Natalie leave soon after. Before Vincent leaves, he offers his condolences to Roxy. Later on, Roxy identifies the people that robbed her store. \n\n\nJessica wants Nash to leave Antonio's apartment, but he's determined to tell Antonio the truth. Jessica really doesn't want to hear what Nash has to say because she thinks it'll ruin all of their lives. Nash simply tells them that he's quitting his job at Capricorn because he feels that the less time he spends with Jessica the better. Antonio agrees with him, and asks if Nash can give him a few more weeks of work. Nash refuses, saying that his resignation is effective immediately. Nash then goes back to the vineyard. Antonio asks Jessica if she's okay. She replies that she's just mad that Nash is leaving Antonio in a lurch by quitting his job so abruptly. Antonio tells her that everything is going to be taken care of. Talia then stops by to talk to Antonio about what happened at the police department. Jessica leaves to clear her mind, and to give Antonio and Talia some space. Talia wonders if she interrupted something. \n\n\nTalia tells Antonio about the evidence they have against Vincent. Antonio agrees with Bo that it's unlikely that Vincent is actually the arsonist. Talia gets a little angry and asks Antonio what she should have done. She then tells him about her run-in with Natalie. Antonio doesn't understand why Natalie is involved. Talia isn't sure either, and explains how Natalie came after her with a vengeance trying to make her look like a fool in front of Vincent. She's upset that she let Nat get to her. Antonio comforts her, telling her that next time it won't happen. Talia feels better, and agrees that something is off with Vincent being the suspected arsonist. \n\n\nJessica barges into Nash's house, demanding to know what Nash is up to. Nash is quitting his job to keep some distance between them so he can get Jessica out of his bloodstream. He's choosing himself, because he can't choose Tess or Jess. Jessica doesn't believe that's why he's quitting his job. Nash wonders how Jessica wants him to play out this situation. Jessica wants to tell Nash how much their relationship is hurting her, but he doesn't want to hear it. She tells him that she's desperately trying to get rid of her feelings for him, but it's hard because she sees Nash in Bree's eyes and smile. Nash wonders why Jessica is still with Antonio if it's so hard to be with him. Jessica insists that it's because Antonio is her husband. She then accuses Nash of wanting Jessica to know that he can ruin her marriage at any moment. He tells her that it hurts him to not be able to take Jess in his arms and keep her from leaving again. Jessica apologizes for not being able to do anything to ease his pain. He tells her that he doesn't want to make her miserable, he doesn't want to feel miserable, and he doesn't want to pine after her. He also says that the real reason he quit Capricorn is that he doesn't think he can work with Antonio and not say anything about Jessica loving him. He then asks Jessica to leave.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Nora encourages Viki to fight for Clint even though Viki doesn't want to. Nora tells Viki that she has to go after Clint instead of waiting for Clint to come to her. Viki hedges and says that she can live with Clint wanting Dorian instead of her. Nora convinces her that any man would be lucky to have her. Viki tells Nora that she doesn't want to seem desperate, but Nora repeats that she should fight and release her mojo. Viki then tells Nora about Clint coming over to tell Viki about his date with Dorian and how he accused Viki of sending mixed signals. Nora agrees with Clint. Viki realizes that she shouldn't be dumping her problems on Nora because of everything Nora has been through recently, since her problems aren't that important. Nora disagrees; she thinks that finding love is the most important thing of all. She also thinks that Viki loves Clint. Viki denies that, saying that she doesn't know what she feels for Clint. She's worried that she's just feeling lonely, and thinks it would be wrong to pursue Clint for that reason alone. Nora tells Viki that she's just protecting herself from getting hurt. Nora states that if the opportunity for love presented itself to her, she would take it, and she encourages Viki to do the same. \n\n\nViki repeats that she really doesn't know what she wants, and Nora accuses her of dodging her feelings. Nora realizes that Viki is afraid of getting hurt. She then asks Viki if Viki wishes Clint weren't dating other women. Viki admits that that is true, and that she does love Clint. Nora tells Viki to tell Clint this before it's too late.\n\n\nClint and Dorian arrive at the Palace. As they seat themselves, Dorian tells Clint that the whole time the robbers were at Foxy Roxy's she was worried that it would interfere with her date with Clint. Clint is touched, and then mentions that he'll have to call Viki at some point during their date to tell Viki that everything is okay with Dorian. Dorian sarcastically thinks about how worried Viki must be about her. Clint insists that Viki would want to know, but Dorian doesn't believe him. She feels like Viki is a third wheel whenever they're on a date, even when Viki isn't around. She then tells Clint that he has to choose to date either Viki or herself, not both. Clint feels bad that he's been making Dorian uncomfortable and apologizes. He thanks her for her company and they toast their date, just as Viki walks in.\n\n\nNatalie and John run into Viki when they get to the Palace. Nat asks Viki if she's okay with seeing Clint and Dorian together. Viki assures Natalie that she's fine. Natalie tells Viki that they'll talk later. Nat and John go to find a table. Natalie then asks John if he has something to say to her.\n\n\nClint asks Dorian if everything is okay between them now. Dorian is about to say yes when she spots Viki near the bar, and wants to know what Viki is doing there. Viki goes over to their table. Clint asks her if Natalie's alright. Viki tells him Nat is fine. Dorian then accuses Viki of crashing their date, which Viki confirms. Viki asks if she can speak to Clint privately, to which he responds that he's in the middle of a date. Instead of backing down, she tells Clint, with Dorian still present, that she wants to date Clint exclusively.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the robbers from Foxy Roxy's are getting drinks at the Palace bar. They prepare to hold up the entire restaurant. \n\n\n",
