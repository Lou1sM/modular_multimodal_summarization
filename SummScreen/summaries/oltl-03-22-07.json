When he bangs his head on the way up, she's surprised to find Cris, filling in for the now ex-employee Nash. She defends Evangeline's behavior as well as that of Jess and Nash when she learns he overheard the conversation about them almost sleeping together. Almost doesn't count, she tells him. When she tries to help out with the bump on his head, Evangeline spies them and gets the wrong idea again. She goes off on them being together and sleeping together until finally, FINALLY, Cris manages to get a word in. Blair is the one he actually slept with, he informs her; Layla was trying to get him to confess. Feeling guilty, she attempts to comfort her sister. Layla wants no parts of her. She asks Cris to get someone to cover for her and heads home. Evangeline tries to wrap herself around Cris' revenge. He thought the worst of her when she actually did nothing, was just a friend to Todd. They accuse each other of making their choices. \n\n\nJess continues to argue with Nash, while he wants to make one thing perfectly clear. He is only around for his daughter and will pick her up and drop her off when Jess isn't around. She would change things if she could, Jess insists. But you can, Nash retorts. You don't want to. He suggests that Antonio be the one to drop off the baby so that they never have to see each other, unless she wants to change her mind. It's not fair for her to change her mind now, Jess tries to explain. Then she needs to choose him or get out, even if she can't stand the thought of not seeing him any more. They can't be friends. He doesn't care to see her tears.  In fact, he has some new rules. Brennan is their daughter's name, not Bree. And they are her parents. He wants to survive and he's doing it for himself. Voices have begun to escalate and suddenly Nash just loses it completely. He begins to punch the wall until he's made several holes, while yelling that he can't take it any longer. He insists again that Jessica leave. She apologizes for making things difficult. She will never see him again but he can change his mind. Good-bye Jessica, he says. \n\n\nTalia and Antonio decide to continue their investigation into the arsonist by using some undercover surveillance equipment. Talia goes to Nora's house alone while Antonio can monitor her movements and speak to her as well.  Just as she's about to give up, she spies some dripping water from some cracked pipes; apparently it's still on. She follows the water's trail and finds what appears to be a military medal of some kind. She's about to read the inscription but is clunked on the head. Someone very carefully picks up the medal. \n\n\nBlair and Todd run into each other at Viki's house as they return the borrowed ski equipment.  They blame each other for Starr's behavior but agree that someone should talk to her. They rule themselves out as well as Viki. What about Evangeline, Todd suggests. No way will Blair go for that, as she threatens death should that happen. Todd reminds her that she turned down his marriage proposal and so he is therefore free. He taunts her for going out on a date with Miles and Marty and sleeping with Miles.\n\n\nIt's a big night at the Palace as Marty and an awkward feeling Miles meet for dinner. He thinks he needs lessons on dating. Viki barges in while Clint and Dorian are on their date and insists on being honest with Clint, with or without Dorian present. Clint tries to tell her it's not the time or place but she won't take no for an answer. Dorian wonders if Niki has put in an appearance. Nat expects to hear bad news from John. He admits that he can't avoid the relationship talk but they have to figure out what's next. He'll even ignore any calls from the PD. She asks if he's breaking up with her. He doesn't want to lose her, he confides. He does receive a call that Roxy has identified her robbers and he authorizes a warrant. Unfortunately at the same time, those same robbers create some noise and announce that they want everyone's cash and jewelry, at gunpoint. Dorian gives one of the men a difficult time, reminding him that he already robbed her at Foxy Roxy's. John is forced to empty his pockets and there's the engagement ring. He's not carrying his gun. Miles purposely drops his watch as he goes to put it in the man's bag. Bending down, he jumps the man instead and creates some chaos. John enters the fray and manages to jump the second man. As they wrestle with the gun it goes off. Blair has just entered the restaurant and is shot! \n\n\n",

He makes a hole in the wall from his constant banging. He orders Jessica out and that he never wanted to see her again. Through tears in her eyes, Jessica leaves. Viki interrupts Clint and Dorian's dinner. Clint and Dorian can't seem to understand why Viki is doing this now of all times. A waiter passes by, and Viki asks him to bring her a chair that she would be sitting with Clint and Viki a while. Natalie is confused as to why John has invited her out to dinner.

Natalie realizes what John had been about to do. When the robbers approach Miles' table, Miles gets up, and pulls off his watch. Miles pretends to drop the watch in the floor. The robber orders him to pick it up. When Miles stoops down to pick up the watch, Miles grabs the robber by his feet, and pulls him down to the floor. This gives John the chance to gain control over the other robber. John and the robber struggle over the gun, and it accidentally goes off. Dorian looks across the room, and sees Blair, who had just come in. Dorian yells, \"Blair\". Blair says, \"I'm o.k.\" as she slides down the wall. Blair had been shot in the shoulder.",
