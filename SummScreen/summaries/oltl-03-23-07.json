Marcie showed Michael the letter she had written for Tommy, that explains (to Tommy) the details of his adoption. Michael insisted that she tear it up. Marcie wondered why Michael always freaked out when she brings up the topic of Tommy's adoption. Michael explained that he doesn't like to think of Tommy as adopted. \"He's ours, Marcie,\" he said.
