    "soap_central": "\n \nAuditions for \"STARR X'd LOVERS\" began at the high school. Dani arrived late and sarcastically asked Cristian about getting his girlfriend to sign up. He quickly stressed that Jessica wasn't his girlfriend because he had one. He added that he thought the conversation to be inappropriate. He was surprised to see Dani there. but she confessed that the musical was about her sister, so it couldn't be that bad.\n\n\nDani spotted Matthew and Destiny and headed to an empty seat near them. Matthew explained that the audition for the boys wouldn't be held until later in the day. Dani confessed that she had decided to audition, and it would be great if she could play Starr and Matthew won the part of Cole. Darren, a student working on crew, advised Cristian he was only doing it in case the crazy blonde showed up to help.\n\n\nAs Natalie worked on her taxes in the kitchen at Llanfair, Jessica walked in and blurted out, \"Does it bother you?\" Natalie looked at her blankly, so Jessica added, \"Stealing someone's boyfriend.\" She thought that Natalie was a troublemaker. Natalie insisted that she had not been bothering John and Marty, but Jessica noted that she had been referring to Cristian.\n\n\nWhile Natalie pointed out that Jessica hadn't been with Cristian when Natalie had begun to date him, Jessica was sure that Natalie must have stolen Cristian from someone else. She and Cristian had loved each other, Natalie assured her sister that Jessica had even given them her blessing. Sullenly, Jessica stated that while the relationship might have been okay with her in the past, it was no longer sitting well with her. She knew all about Natalie's past, and she was sure that Marty would not be happy that Natalie was pursuing John.\n\n\nNatalie insisted that she was not after John, and she had been a different person when she had first arrived in Llanview. She explained that while she knew that Jessica was angry and barely cared for her, Natalie cared about Jessica and was upset that she had lost her sister and best friend. She hadn't told Jessica about her marriage to Cristian because she wasn't sure how Jessica would react. She didn't know what she could do to gain Jessica's love and trust. \"Help me get Cristian back,\" Jessica proposed.\n\n\nCole arrived home right behind Marty and John, who had wanted to share their news with him. Ecstatically, they announced that they were going to have a baby, and a speechless Starr and Cole hugged them with joy. Marty disclosed that the news had already spread on its own among their friends and acquaintances. Starr frowned when Cole made it known that he had been out all night with his sociology partner, but she bid her goodbyes. She had promised to help Langston with the auditions for the musical.\n\n\nCole reminded her that he wanted final approval on whoever was cast as him in the show. Starr forged ahead and asked Cole if he had been in Hannah's dorm overnight because, according to Karen, the pizza delivery girl, Karen had seen him there. He assured her he hadn't, and he thought that Karen was a \"stoner\" anyway and not someone to be believed. Starr agreed that Markko had said the same thing.\n\n\nMarty asked John where the two of them plus baby would live, and he joked that John and Marty could move in with Starr and Cole. Marty had to leave, and she handed Hope to John, who held the baby awkwardly. Later, quite uncomfortably, he changed Hope's diaper. He thought he would actually do better defusing a bomb and hoped he would have as much success at fatherhood as Cole had. He thought that Cole and Starr would make it as a couple if anyone would. Cole admitted that he was keeping something from Starr.\n\n\nHe told John about the friend of his who had a problem and was depending on him to help get her through it. John thought that Cole should tell Starr all about it in exactly the same way that he had explained it to John. Cole explained that the girl was going through a difficult time, and she had asked Cole not to say anything. Since Starr knew the girl, Cole was afraid things would be worse if it got back to the girl.\n\n\nCole further explained that he hated lying to Starr, but he had promised the girl he wouldn't tell anyone. He and Starr didn't keep secrets from each other, though, and he felt guilty. John felt that Starr was smart and would understand unless there was something more complicated going on. Cole promised that he loved Starr and Hope and would never leave them for anyone else. There was nothing else going on.\n\n\nCole divulged that it was very difficult for him to make some of his decisions. John admired Cole and thought that Cole was doing a great job, though Cole disagreed. He wouldn't listen to himself if he were John. Cole felt like he never knew if he was making the right choices.\n\n\nAs Rex and Gigi waited for Sierra's custody hearing to begin, Rex admitted that he understood Gigi's determination to win. She was sure that Schuyler was at a distinct advantage in the case, but Rex promised to support her.\n\n\nInside the courtroom, Elijah voiced his belief that T\u00e9a's case was full of holes. He remarked that Schuyler hadn't allowed the social worker inside of his apartment when she visited because Elijah hadn't received the report. T\u00e9a was perplexed since Schuyler had advised her the social worker was there when T\u00e9a was at his front door. T\u00e9a remarked that Elijah had been too busy romancing Blair to keep track of the events of the case. Elijah wondered where Schuyler was and thought that T\u00e9a wasn't on top of things either.\n\n\nThe court was called to order and Elijah quickly pointed out that Schuyler was missing. The judge agreed to give T\u00e9a five minutes to locate her client.\n\n\nSchuyler awoke and found himself lying on the floor. \"Sierra,\" he called out. He managed to pull himself to a standing position and frantically began to search the apartment for his daughter. He picked up the social worker's identification badge from the floor and recalled the chain of events that led to his unconsciousness. He stumbled to the phone to call the police, but there was a note attached that read, \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"\n\n\nHe received a message on his cell phone and it was a video of Allison and Sierra. Allison urged him not to do anything stupid and to wait for instructions. Hearing a noise at the front door, Schuyler grabbed an implement and stood waiting. As Rachel entered the apartment, he almost bashed her head in but stopped himself in time.\n\n\nFervently, he asked her if she had seen any strangers or anyone suspicious. Rachel declared she hadn't and had been busy with her ex-boyfriend all night at the counseling center. She had planned on flying to Chicago to help him settle there. She had returned to the apartment to shower and pack some of her things. She immediately sensed that something was wrong with Schuyler but he assured her he was only trying to protect his daughter. Rachel asked where Sierra was.\n\n\nStuttering, Schuyler explained that Sierra was asleep in the bedroom. She had been awake all night and had finally fallen asleep. He hadn't slept, either, which was the cause of his odd behavior. Rachel suggested that he take a nap while the baby was sleeping. After her shower, Rachel offered to watch the baby, but Schuyler insisted that she get going. Once she was gone, Schuyler impatiently waited for the phone call from Allison.\n\n\nRoxy staggered into her salon and realized she needed to have some coffee. She decided that more vodka would be better. As she puttered about, someone watched her from the back room. Suddenly, Roxy heard a noise and grabbed an umbrella as a weapon. She began to look around. \"Back here,\" she heard someone mumble. Shocked, Roxy encountered Allison, who said she had big plans. She wanted her hair done. Roxy proclaimed that she would call the police, but Allison advised her, \"I wouldn't do that if I were you.\"\n\n\nAllison promised to \"rat\" Roxy out if Roxy called the police. \"Don't you remember what happened when Rex was born?\" Allison prodded Roxy's memory. Roxy recalled that the baby was born in a cabin; he was ill and went to the hospital. Suddenly, Roxy heard a baby, and Allison retrieved Sierra. \"Isn't she precious?\" Allison cooed. She gushed that she could eat the baby up, which caused Roxy to comment that she was surprised Allison hadn't done that very thing already. Allison admitted that she had a bad habit and had stolen another baby.\n\n\nShe told Roxy who the baby was. It was Roxy's opinion that Allison and babies didn't mix, and Allison should not be around any babies. Allison sneered that it was usually the other way around as far as mixing babies went.\n\n\nNatalie didn't think Jessica's plea was a very good idea since she didn't think Cristian would listen to her. Besides, she didn't feel very comfortable. She asked Jessica about Brody instead. Jessica insisted that she didn't love Brody and wondered if Natalie was comfortable going after John. For the last time, Natalie insisted that she wasn't after John and wasn't about to take him away from Marty, especially since Marty was pregnant. Just then, Marty walked through the door.\n\n\nJessica danced around, excited to hear about Marty's pregnancy. Natalie apologized for telling yet another person. Marty noted dryly that she would call Natalie if she ever needed a publicist. Natalie asked Jessica if they could continue their conversation soon as Jessica moved towards the door. Jessica responded indifferently, \"Right. Whatever.\" After Natalie was gone, Marty confessed to Jessica that she wasn't worried about Natalie and didn't expect any problems to arise over John.\n\n\nT\u00e9a took her five minutes and called Schuyler. He answered gruffly, as he had expected to find Allison on the other end. T\u00e9a demanded to know where Schuyler was and pleaded with him to show up for his case. She sensed that something was wrong as Schuyler told her that he wouldn't be able to get there and he didn't care. T\u00e9a turned to the judge and advised her that Schuyler's babysitter had cancelled and he was unable to get to court. Against Elijah's protests, the judge agreed to a continuance. She was extending a one-time grace period for the next 24 hours. As T\u00e9a rushed from the courtroom, Gigi and Rex wanted to know what was wrong.\n\n\nThey thought it strange that Schuyler hadn't shown up, and Gigi was worried that Schuyler had taken the baby and left town. Rex suggested that they check it out.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at Schuyler's place but he wouldn't allow her through the door. Angrily, she wanted to know what was going on. He wouldn't tell her at first but reluctantly, he revealed that Sierra had been kidnapped.\n\n\nStarr got to school late and told an annoyed Langston that she had been waiting for Cole to get home. He had been away all night. Starr promised that she was okay, though Langston didn't think that was true. Destiny was called to the front of the room and she performed the song \"The Climb,\" by Miley Cyrus. As Dani began to sneak towards the door, everyone applauded when Destiny was finished singing.\n\n\nDani was called next and Cristian cornered her as she was about to escape through the door. She made various excuses for not being able to audition, but she grew confident with everyone's shouts of encouragement. She headed to the stage and performed the same song that Destiny sang. Starr whispered to Langston that Dani wouldn't be a bad Starr.\n\n\nThe teacher in charge announced that there were lots of tough decisions to be made due to the large amount of talented students. He thanked everyone for showing up as Matthew praised Destiny's audition. He was surprised at Dani's performance and didn't know she was able to sing. Cristian attempted to nab students for crew as they filed out. Jessica showed up and offered her assistance.\n\n\nNatalie headed to her mother's salon, in need of someone to talk to. She called out for Roxy but did not receive any answers. Finally, she found Roxy in a back room as she worked on a customer named \"Vera.\" Roxy urged Natalie to leave, since she was using some products with heavy fumes as she straightened the woman's hair. Suddenly, Natalie heard a cry and asked if there was a baby in the shop. She was met with silence from the two women.\n\n\n",

Cole tells John about a friend of his who had a problem and was depending on him to help get her through it. Rex and Gigi wait for Rex to begin hearing about Sierra's custody battle. Cole and Starr are delighted to learn that they are having a baby. The couple are overjoyed, but Cole is worried that Starr will find out about the baby. They are also worried that the baby will be born with a cleft lip and teeth that won't grow in the right places, and that Cole won't be able to care for the child like he used to. Cole is also concerned that Starr may not like the way he looks at her when she is pregnant with their baby, and he wants to make sure that she is happy. The pair are worried that they will have to give up their relationship when the baby is born, and Cole worries that Starr won't like him as much as he once did.\n"
