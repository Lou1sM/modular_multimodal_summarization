Her disappointment turned to disbelief when Antonio explained that he had to leave town because of an undercover assignment. Talia fired questions at Antonio, but he was evasive. However, Talia eventually figured out that Antonio's new case involved her father, Carlo Hesser. \n\n\nTalia worried that Antonio's life could be in peril. Antonio promised Talia that he had the investigation under control. Antonio assured Talia that he wouldn't have agreed to the assignment if he weren't certain of a successful outcome. Talia wanted to be a part of the investigation, but Antonio explained that the FBI was concerned that Carlo could get to Talia. Antonio asked Talia to take care of Jamie while he was gone. \n\n\nT\u00e9a went to the hospital to tell Nora that Marty had hired T\u00e9a to represent Cole. Nora made it clear that she intended to try Cole as an adult. T\u00e9a begged Nora to reconsider. T\u00e9a believed that Cole needed to be helped more than he needed to be punished. Nora wasn't swayed. She reminded T\u00e9a that Cole had irrevocably altered Matthew's life. \n\n\nTodd went to Llanfair to talk to Viki. He wanted Viki to help him with his quest to regain custody of the children. Viki accused Todd of being despicable. She told her brother that it was wrong of him to take advantage of Blair's coma in such an underhanded manner. Todd didn't show any remorse; he claimed that his intention was to take care of his kids, not to hurt Blair. Viki didn't believe Todd. \n\n\nTodd said that he had sought counseling in order to be a better parent. Viki wasn't impressed; she believed Todd should leave the kids alone. Viki reminded Todd of how he had failed Viki when Jessica's alter, Tess, had wreaked havoc. Todd stormed out of the library when he realized that Viki wouldn't support his bid for custody. \n\n\nOutside, Todd received a phone call. When Todd learned that Blair had emerged from her coma, he demanded to know who had visited Blair and what Blair had said. T\u00e9a walked up as Todd ended the call. Todd wanted to know what T\u00e9a was doing at Llanfair, but then changed his mind. He walked off before T\u00e9a could respond. \n\n\nT\u00e9a rang the doorbell as she watched Todd walk away. Viki gave T\u00e9a a warm welcome as she invited T\u00e9a inside. T\u00e9a told Viki that she had dumped Todd as a client because of his decision to fight Blair for custody of the children. Viki admitted that she was disgusted with Todd; she had turned down his request for help. T\u00e9a congratulated Viki for standing up to Todd. \n\n\nViki ushered T\u00e9a into the library. T\u00e9a explained that the reason she had stopped by to see Viki was because Dorian had asked T\u00e9a to represent Blair during the custody hearing. T\u00e9a admitted that she was tempted to accept the offer, but she was conflicted about her feelings for Todd. \n\n\nViki asked T\u00e9a if she was in love with Todd. T\u00e9a became emotional as she confessed that she was falling in love with Todd. Viki handed T\u00e9a a tissue as T\u00e9a pulled herself together. T\u00e9a was desperate to break away from Todd. Viki asked T\u00e9a if representing Blair in a custody fight would accomplish that goal. \n\n\nT\u00e9a thanked Viki for giving her perspective; Viki was the only person who understood what T\u00e9a saw in Todd. \n\n\nBrody went to Llanfair to talk to Jessica. He felt in need of a friend after learning that he was not a bone marrow match for Shane. Jessica offered Brody words of encouragement. Brody appreciated her support. Their conversation turned to Jessica's recovery. Jessica admitted that there weren't any guarantees that her alter personalities were gone for good. Jessica worried that a catastrophic crisis could destroy the progress that she had made. \n\n\nJessica and Brody decided to go to the hospital. Jessica wanted to visit Blair while Brody wanted to check in on Shane. \n\n\nAfter Jessica and Brody went their separate ways in the hospital, Brody bumped into Rex. Brody was dispirited when Rex told him that they had not found a match for Shane. However, Rex remained hopeful. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Jared and Natalie awaited the results of the DNA test to determine if Jessica's baby had truly died. Natalie debated if they should tell Jessica the truth. Natalie was worried that the shock could compromise Jessica's recovery. Jared believed that they were obligated to tell the truth; they didn't have the right to play God with people's lives. \n\n\nAs the lab technician handed Natalie the envelope with the results, he informed Jared and Natalie that they were not candidates to donate bone marrow to Shane. Natalie thanked the technician. When she and Jared were alone, she opened the envelope. \n\n\nThe DNA test confirmed that Jessica's baby had died; Chloe was Starr's daughter. \n\n\nRex walked into the room moments later. When he noticed her look of dejection, Rex asked Natalie what was wrong. Natalie told Rex that she and Jared weren't a match to Shane. \n\n\nStarr and Addie were delighted when Michael told them that Blair was awake. Addie encouraged Starr to visit Blair. Addie believed that Blair would want to see Starr first. Starr went into her mother's room. Blair was awake, but confused about why she was in the hospital. Starr avoided telling Blair the truth. \n\n\nLater, John went into Blair's room. Blair asked him how long she had been in the hospital. John told her that she had been a patient for several days. Blair suspected that something bad had happened; she saw it in Starr and Addie's eyes when she asked them questions. \n\n\nJohn asked Blair what her last memory was, before she woke up in the hospital. Blair recalled arguing with John then wanting to take a shower. John gently told Blair that she had been attacked; someone had stabbed her. Blair asked John if they knew who her assailant was. John admitted that he had hoped Blair could identify the person. As Blair concentrated, she recalled someone plunging a knife into her. \n\n\nTodd walked up just as John asked Blair if she knew who had stabbed her. \n\n\nJessica was holding Chloe when she spotted Starr outside of Blair's room. Starr played with Chloe while she updated Jessica on Blair's condition. Jessica was happy for her cousin. Jessica invited Starr to the cafeteria. Starr readily accepted the invitation. \n\n\nLater, Jessica and Starr bumped into Natalie and Jared. \n\n\nStacy demanded to know if Gigi would agree to end her relationship with Rex in order to save Shane. Rex walked into the hospital's chapel before Gigi gave Stacy an answer. Rex immediately picked up on the tension in the room. Gigi covered for Stacy; she told Rex that Stacy had proposed burying the hatchet for Shane's sake. Rex believed Gigi. After Rex left, Stacy admitted that she had feared Gigi would tell Rex the truth. \n\n\nGigi was horrified that Stacy was willing to barter a child's life in exchange for a man who didn't even care about Stacy. Stacy insisted that she and Rex were meant to be. Stacy was certain Rex would fall madly in love with her as soon as Gigi broke things off. Gigi accused her sister of being completely delusional. \n\n\nGigi refused to agree to Stacy's terms. Stacy was livid; she demanded that Gigi reconsider. Stacy reminded Gigi that Shane's life was at stake. Gigi refused to let her child be poisoned by Stacy. Stacy resorted to threats. She warned Gigi that the window of opportunity was closing. Stacy vowed to leave town as soon as possible. Gigi called Stacy's bluff; she told Stacy to go back to \"Sin City.\" Stacy switched tactics by accusing Gigi of killing her son. Gigi slapped Stacy across the face then marched out of the chapel. \n\n\nAlone in the chapel, Stacy vowed to find a way to be with Rex. \n\n\nGigi was in tears when she approached Rex. She let Rex believe that she was upset because they had not found a bone marrow match for Shane. Rex assured Gigi that everything would work out.\n\n\n",

She tells her brother she'd like to help him but she finds it despicable that he wants to petition to take the kids away from Blair after what happened to her. Tea goes and informs Viki that she plans to represent Blair in the custody battle. And they both reflect how they both have a habit of having to \"rescue\" Todd. Blair awakens and asks John what happened. He informs her that she was stabbed. Natalie and Jared have gotten DNA proof that the baby known as Chloe is really Starr's. But they haven't a clue how they can tell Jessica. Jessica is getting closer to Brody. Stacy tells Gigi that if she wants to save Shane's life and have her sister donate the bone marrow, she has to give up Rex and \"give\" him to Stacy. Gigi tells her sister she is insane.",
