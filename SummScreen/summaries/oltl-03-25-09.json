    "soap_central": "\nDo The Right Thing?\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, the Vegas prepared for Antonio's departure from Llanview with a farewell party, with Carlotta, Jamie, Layla, Cristian, and Talia as guests. Jamie asked her father if he had to leave, and Antonio promised he'd be back soon, reminding her that Talia and Carlotta would look after her while he was away. Cristian confronted Antonio in the kitchen, where Antonio admitted that he was going on the hunt for Carlo Hesser. Antonio told Cris he couldn't allow Carlo to continue terrorizing their family, and that he wanted to take care of his archenemy permanently. \n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at the Buenos Dias to crash Antonio's party, dodging nagging phone messages from Dorian as she went. The Vegas gave their prodigal daughter a frosty reception, and Antonio assailed T\u00e9a for turning on the family and using Cristian to further her case against Vanessa. T\u00e9a claimed she'd meant no harm, and would never have intentionally put Cristian in danger. Antonio asked for proof that T\u00e9a had changed, and T\u00e9a explained that she was through with Todd Manning. \n\n\nAntonio was skeptical, and asked T\u00e9a what had prompted her sudden change of heart. As T\u00e9a remembered her confession of love to Viki, she insisted she merely wanted to make amends to her friends and family for her foolish choices. Antonio softened as T\u00e9a begged for his forgiveness, and said he hated to see the strongest woman he knew at the beck and call of someone like Todd. The old friends mended fences with a hug. \n\n\nNearby, Layla comforted Talia over Antonio's departure, but when her eyes reached Cristian, she once again turned cold. As Talia tried to referee, Layla told Cris that his brother was a stand-up guy, but \"I hate your guts.\" \n\n\nThe Vegas raised a toast to Antonio as he prepared to leave Llanview behind, and Antonio again promised his family he would not be gone long. Taking a sad Talia into his arms once more, he drew her into a passionate kiss. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Clint paid a visit to Viki, who listened to her ex vent his frustrations about Matthew's paralysis. Clint explained that he'd been flying all over the country, but couldn't find a single specialist able to give Matthew a positive diagnosis for regaining the use of his legs. Clint asked why Matthew had to suffer, and told Viki that he felt helpless; if he couldn't find Matthew the right doctor, he felt he couldn't do anything for Nora or Bo. \n\n\nViki told Clint there was something he could do for Nora: \"Let her lean on you.\" She reminded Clint of their own trials during Jessica's hard times, and said that they'd come through all right. Viki reassured Clint that, in the end, it would all work out. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Jared and Natalie were stunned to come face-to-face with Jessica, Starr, and \"Chloe\" in the hospital lounge. As Jessica asked her stricken sister what was wrong, Natalie fumbled for words, mind racing as she tried to decide whether to tell the truth about Chloe. In her mind, Natalie saw a nightmarish vision of the future where she told Jessica and Starr the truth then and there: Jessica would fall to pieces and descend into psychotic madness, dragged away by men in white coats as Starr took her baby back. \n\n\nSnapped out of her fantasy, Natalie decided to lie, and told Jessica and Starr she was only upset about Matthew and Shane. Jessica comforted her sister, then shared some family moments with Starr and Chloe, snapping pictures with Starr's phone. As they watched helplessly from the sidelines, Jared reassured Natalie about her judgment call and said it wasn't the right time to tell Jessica and Starr. Natalie asked when the right time would be to tell Jessica her baby was dead, and told Jared that if they stayed silent, Starr would never get to know Hope. \n\n\nJared and Natalie returned to Llanfair and spoke to Viki, who was disappointed to hear they were not bone marrow matches for Shane. Viki told the couple that in light of Shane's illness, they needed to count their blessings for what their family had. As she walked away, the impact of her words wasn't lost on the tortured lovers. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Jessica took Chloe to wait for Brody outside Shane's room. As she nuzzled \"her\" daughter, Jessica told Chloe that she and Bree were saving her life. \n\n\nInside, Brody visited with Shane, who was thrilled to see his old friend. Shane tried to keep a game face despite his illness, but said he understood how Brody had felt, facing death. Brody chose to keep things upbeat, assuring the boy that Shane was a trouper and would beat cancer. As Brody and Shane tossed a football back and forth, Brody apologized for not being a donor match, as well as for all he'd put Shane through. Shane told him he had nothing to be sorry for, and that Brody was still a great friend. \n\n\nShane's positivity was interrupted by a fit of nausea and vomiting, but he wouldn't let it get him down. Brody wished he could take the illness and pain for Shane, and said he'd be there for Shane every step of the way. Shane asked him to do one thing for him: \"Get a new girlfriend!\" He suggested his Aunt Stacy, and asked if Brody liked blondes. \"Actually, I do,\" Brody replied, but politely turned Shane's suggestion down and said goodbye. \n\n\nAs Brody stepped outside the hospital room, he found Jessica and Chloe waiting for him. Brody told Jessica that Shane was an inspiration to him, and Jessica suggested they take a walk and talk about it. \n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Bo tended to Matthew, rearranging the covers to keep his son warm. Matthew was sullen, and reminded his father that it didn't matter since he couldn't feel a draft below the waist. Bo urged Matthew not to give up hope, but Matthew said he didn't want to drag his parents down. Bo told Matthew that he wasn't their obligation but their son, who they loved unconditionally. \n\n\nIn the corridor, Nora's sad reverie was interrupted by Matthew's friend, Destiny, who introduced herself and asked if he really was crippled. Nora said it was true, and explained that Matthew didn't want visitors. Destiny said she wanted to see him, and sashayed into Matthew's room. \n\n\nAs the adults cleared out, Destiny presented Matthew with her written notes from their classes. Matthew asked why she was giving them to him, since he wouldn't be going back to school. Destiny told Matthew not to let \"mean girls\" like Becca or bullies like Justin keep him away, and ordered him to stay strong. \n\n\nOutside, Bo tried to calm Nora's fears. Bo told Nora he was impressed with Destiny's forwardness towards Matthew. \"She kinda got up in his grille,\" Nora murmured. \"...It's what the kids say.\" Nora asked Bo about Matthew's mental state, and Bo said that Matthew had been sliding into depression. As Nora broke down, Bo embraced her. \n\n\nAfter Destiny left, Bo and Nora returned to Matthew's side, hoping to cheer their son up. Matthew said he wouldn't need Destiny's notes, since he had no intention of returning to school. Bo and Nora told Matthew not to think like that, but Matthew snapped that all the kids had hated him even when he could walk. As Bo and Nora crawled onto the bed together to comfort the boy, Clint walked up from outside, finding himself on the outside looking in at their tender family moment. \n\n\nIn the ICU, John questioned Blair about what she remembered from the night of her attack, while Todd listened in just outside the door. Blair couldn't recall her assailant's face, but remembered the physical sensations of the assault in vivid detail. She told John she could remember the intruder taking her hand. \n\n\nJust then, Dorian returned to the room with Shaun, and promptly spotted Todd eavesdropping. As the others turned on him, Todd tried to explain himself to Blair, but Dorian wouldn't let him get a word in edgewise, railing against him over his custody scheme. Blair was confused, and Todd admitted he had filed for \"temporary\" custody. As Blair recalled their argument before she was stabbed, Todd said the boys had been scared and that Jack had asked him to step up. \n\n\nDorian accused him of manipulating the child's feelings. Todd told Blair he hadn't been sure she would wake up, and wanted to protect their children. He said he'd seen the scene of the attack, but could never do anything like that to her. Blair reminded Todd that she was awake again, eliminating the need for an emergency custody bid, and Todd hedged as he reminded her that she had a long recovery ahead. With that, John and Shaun hustled Todd away from the room, ordering him to stay away from the Cramer family. \n\n\nDown the hall, Todd again told John he was innocent, and that John and Shaun had no right to keep Todd from his kids. John warned Todd to keep away from Blair, and after some more bickering, Todd finally stormed out after saying that John couldn't stop Todd's plans. \n\n\nBack in Blair's room, Dorian reassured her niece that she had the answer to their custody problem: T\u00e9a Delgado. Blair was understandably leery of Dorian's strategy, and muttered that T\u00e9a was a \"barracuda\" who couldn't be trusted. Blair reminded Dorian that T\u00e9a had helped Todd steal custody from a comatose Blair years before. Dorian said that T\u00e9a had sworn off Todd and would be their ace in the hole. Blair hoped a court confrontation would be avoided, and that Todd would back off because Blair was in recovery. \n\n\nOutside Blair's room, Shaun stood guard. He was surprised to run into Destiny, who turned out to be his little sister. Shaun asked Destiny what she was doing prowling around the hospital, and Destiny told the big man that her friend needed their help. \n\n\nIn the lounge, Starr looked longingly at her phone picture with Chloe, just in time for Todd to walk up and give her the hard sell about his custody plans. Disgusted, Starr laughed him off, and told him that even if Jack and Sam wanted to be with their dad, she'd never live with him. \n\n\nIn the ICU, T\u00e9a arrived with an answer to Dorian's job offer. She told Blair and Dorian that she would take their case. Blair asked if they could win. \"Absolutely,\" T\u00e9a replied, and said she knew exactly how. \n\n\n",
