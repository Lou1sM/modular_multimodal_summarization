Matthew asked his mom to \"go easy on Cole,\" and Bo seconded his son's request. Nora insisted she wasn't after revenge, but only wanted to ensure that Cole didn't hurt anyone in the future, including himself. \n\n\nIn Shane's room, Roxy made her grandson up to look like a rock star, complete with wig and makeup. In the chapel, Gigi continued to talk to God and stressed that she didn't want to give Rex up to meet Stacy's demands. \n\n\nThe physical therapist arrived with a wheelchair for Matthew, but he promptly refused to have anything to do with it. He explained to Bo that if he sat in it, he was afraid that he'd never get out if it. Shane excitedly told Rex that Roxy had mentioned that there was a donor, but when Rex confronted his mother, she told him it was just a feeling she had. She stopped an angry Rex from telling his son the truth, and left abruptly to run an errand. \n\n\nMichael had some good news for Rex. A donor had been located in Australia and, while not the perfect match, it would do. An elated Rex rushed to tell Shane. Excitedly, the boy made plans to go to Disneyworld. A happy Gigi, hearing the news after her prayer, left to run an errand of her own. Rex was perplexed. \n\n\nMatthew pleaded with his father to not force him to sit in the wheelchair. He admitted he was scared, even though Asa had once told him that Buchanans never got scared. Bo, confessing that he was scared too, clarified that Buchanans did get scared, but never told anyone. He only wanted to see Matthew smile and be happy again, and was sorry that he couldn't do anything to help, though he would keep trying. Matthew sadly told his father that he didn't want to stay like he was. \n\n\nAs T\u00e9a prepared for Cole's arraignment, Marty arrived early and thanked the attorney for representing her son. Cole, seated on a bench outside of the courtroom, was taken aback when Asher, his drug dealer, walked off of the elevator and announced that he was Cole's peer counselor from school. Realizing that the boy was only there because of his fear that Cole would disclose his identity, Cole turned down Asher's offer of some pills. \n\n\nAs Asher explained that Cole had to stop the drugs slowly and not go cold turkey, Nora arrived. Pushing the bagged pills into Cole's hand, Asher jumped up and made a quick dash for the elevator. Cole remained silent as Nora asked who Asher was. Instead, Cole told her of a dream he had, in which he and his mom were in Ireland. He was the one trapped instead of Marty, and he explained that it was better that he had burned because then he couldn't hurt anyone. Nora mentioned that Matthew was more concerned for Cole than for himself. \n\n\nInterrupted by Marty, Nora said that her son needed her. In response to Marty's question, Cole claimed that he wasn't in withdrawal because he hadn't been on drugs long enough. After he asked his mom to get him some water, he swiftly downed the pills. \n\n\nT\u00e9a was surprised that Nora planned on going for the maximum sentence. She argued that Cole didn't deserve to be in a place with others who did. \n\n\nOnce the arraignment began, Nora stood to read the charges. Turning to look at Cole, the district attorney had a sudden change of heart. The judge was annoyed when Nora stated that Cole was pleading guilty when it wasn't her place to announce it, but she quickly covered. Maintaining that they had all made a deal, which T\u00e9a denied, she thought it best that Cole plead guilty in order to accept the deal. \n\n\nNora requested a suspended sentence and six months probation. She added that it would be contingent on Cole's satisfactory completion of a program in a residential treatment facility, commencing right away. T\u00e9a gratefully and quietly accepted. \n\n\nAsking to speak before the court, Cole admitted his guilt and how he could have killed several people by being high and behind the wheel of a car. He called Matthew the sweetest boy in the world, a boy who was not able to use his legs because of Cole. He pointed out that Matthew was smart, brave, never hurt anyone, and was like a little brother to Cole. He stressed that Matthew was everything that he wasn't, and wished he could have taken his place. \n\n\nCrying, Cole told the judge that he didn't deserve the break, but would make the best of it. He told Nora that he would spend the rest of his life in trying to make it up. Marty grabbed Nora in thanks. \n\n\nAs Cole spoke, Matthew agreed to test the wheelchair at the hospital. He was gently picked up and placed into the chair. \"Let's roll,\" he said. \n\n\nLangston was unsuccessful with her suggestion that Starr go to school instead of being involved in her parents' latest battle. Starr thought it easier than having to listen to school gossip about herself and Schuyler, though Langston informed her that Starr was tied with Cole and Matthew as the most talked about. Starr disagreed with Langston's proclamation that they should have tried harder to stop Cole from doing drugs. Starr blamed herself, since Cole saw her kissing Schuyler. \n\n\nStarr insisted that she was unable to be there for Cole any longer, even though Langston felt that the couple needed each other. It dawned on Langston that Starr had a crush on Schuyler, but Langston wondered how the teacher felt about Starr. Starr insisted that she and Schuyler \"got each other,\" even as Langston pointed out that the only real connection they had was in the actions of their parents. Once that was taken away, she wondered what could be left. Langston couldn't figure out if Schuyler was a jerk or a nice guy. She decided he was nice and was trying to send Starr a message that he wasn't interested. \n\n\nAs Langston continued her questions, Starr wondered if her friend were performing an intervention. She thought it would be fine if she and Schuyler were to sneak around, much like she used to do with Cole. She was sure it was love and she was sure that there was something between her and her teacher. She was confident that he would see it too, someday. \n\n\nStacy assured Schuyler that she would be out of his hair and into her own place in no time, since she had things under control. As Stacy stood in her underwear, Schuyler turned his back, reminding her that they were no longer boyfriend and girlfriend. She admitted that she would be ruining Gigi's life whether she stayed in town or left. She wondered why Schuyler wasn't at work. \n\n\nSchuyler admitted that he had been suspended, and a suspicious Stacy asked about drugs or if had slept with a student. Confiding that it was for inappropriate contact but a misunderstanding, Schuyler begged Stacy to pretend to be in love with him. After Schuyler left to take his shower, there was a loud banging on the door. Roxy demanded to know what was happening with their deal. \n\n\nRoxy advised Stacy that she wouldn't wait much longer for Stacy to step forward and take the next step in their plan. She would tell everyone the truth if Stacy didn't act soon. Schuyler heard the commotion and wondered what was going on. Stacy lied, admitting that her music had been too loud and a neighbor had complained. Schuyler knew it had something to do with Gigi and asked her to cry on his shoulder, much as he had done with her. Stacy confided that her nephew had leukemia but that she hadn't been arguing, merely letting off steam. \n\n\nSchuyler offered to be tested. Stacy couldn't imagine why he would do that, considering that he wasn't related to Shane. He told her that anyone with a heart would do the same. \n\n\nRoxy returned to the hospital and, upon hearing of the donor, could only exclaim that it was about time \"she got off her butt.\" A curious Rex wondered how Roxy knew the donor who lived on the opposite side of the world. Roxy fled to the chapel. After court, Nora arrived back at the hospital. She was thrilled to see Matthew in the wheelchair and getting around. \"Sweet ride,\" she agreed with her son. \n\n\nOnce inside the chapel, Roxy thanked God for the new donor and outsmarting Stacy. She was happy that her grandson would not have to get bone marrow from a sleaze. Unfortunately, Michael had more news for Rex and it wasn't good. The transplant was off. \n\n\nOutside of the courtroom, the counselor from the rehab facility advised Marty that they had paperwork to do. She handed Cole a cup in a bag and told him to fill it. \n\n\nGigi paid her sister a visit to share the news. Not mincing words, and calling her every name she could think of, she told Stacy that she wouldn't be needed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew and his parents are able to make peace with the fact that he will temporarily be in a wheelchair. Matthew convinces his mother to go easy on Cole.

But Michael later finds out that the transplant cannot happen. Starr and Langston talk about her feelings for Schuyler and the fact that she can see that his ex girlfriend is currently staying with him. Stacy admits to Schuyler that her nephew needs bone marrow.
