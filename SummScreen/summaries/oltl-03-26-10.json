    "soap_central": "\n \nAt Starr's apartment, Starr questioned Langston about whether Langston had sex with Ford, and Langston evaded the question by stating that Starr was her best friend and that Starr should trust her.  Starr wondered why Langston was unable to look her in the eye to tell her that Langston was not sleeping with Ford.  Langston overreacted and said that she would move out, but Starr refused to let Langston go anywhere until Langston informed her of what was going on.  Starr exclaimed, \"I love you.  We all love you.  You're pushing us away right now -- even Markko.\"  After Starr said that Langston could tell Starr anything, Langston finally admitted to sleeping with Ford and that it had happened in Starr's apartment.  After Starr stated that Langston must have been forced or drunk, Langston denied it.\n\n\nIn the kitchen of the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9, Cole told Markko not to worry about Langston, and Markko agreed that he and Langston just needed more time together.  As Cole left the kitchen, he saw Hannah accuse Ford of dumping her to sleep with Langston.  When Hannah asked Ford if he was sleeping with Langston while sleeping with her, Ford questioned if Hannah was having a problem and stated that he had always used a condom.  Hannah asked how a condom was supposed to protect someone emotionally but stated that she could have a problem the way that Ford slept around.  Cole confronted Ford on his treatment of Hannah, and Hannah explained to Cole that Ford dumped her to sleep with Langston.  \n\n\nHannah also wanted to reveal that to Markko but Cole stopped her.  Cole wanted to know if Hannah had witnessed Ford and Hannah together, and Hannah admitted to overhearing them talking about finding a button in his office and revealed that she knew that \"he takes girls there to have sex with them.\"  Hannah then claimed that she heard Ford and Langston having sex in his office as Markko entered from the kitchen into the caf\u00e9 and cried, \"What?\"  Hannah related to Markko that she knew that Ford preyed \"on young girls who don't know any better.\"  Ford explained to Markko that Hannah \"has a thing for him\" and that she had turned into a stalker.  \n\n\nFord yelled at Hannah to get over it and left.  Hannah apologized to Markko and explained that Ford was a serial user who did not care about Markko or anyone else. She walked away.  When Markko told Cole that Hannah did not know Langston, Cole reminded Markko that Hannah did know Ford and his track record.  Cole presented to Markko that Hannah was a really nice girl who got hurt and that she had misunderstood.  After Markko left, Hannah hugged Cole and apologized, but Cole informed her that Ford was not worth it.  However, Cole also warned Hannah that Langston would never do that to Markko because she loved him.\n\n\nAfter Langston admitted to sleeping with Ford, Starr responded that she was trying to figure out how it could have happened and continued with, \"How -- how could you end up having sex on our couch with Markko's teacher?\"  Langston admitted that it had been going on for quite a while, and when Starr asked for how long, Langston answered for a couple of weeks or even a month.  Langston clarified that she was able to relate to Ford because of the musical and then he kissed her and held her and that it continued to happen over and over again.  However she emphasized that it was just an accident but that she could not stop.  \n\n\nStarr related that Ford was not a drug but just a guy and that Langston could stop.  Starr also reminded Langston that Markko gave up film school in Los Angeles for her and that he also stood by her when he had problems with his parents.  Langston stressed that she loved Markko, but Starr emphasized that Langston had to stop cheating on Markko.  Langston replied, \"What if I don't want to?\"  Starr stated that things with Ford were not going to go anywhere, and Langston agreed that maybe she had made a mistake.  But she also explained that she was only 18 and since she had only been with Markko, she did not know what she wanted or who she would want to be in ten years.  \n\n\nStarr reminded Langston that it was still not fair to cheat on Markko and that Langston should tell Markko what was going on.  Frustrated, Langston pointed out that Markko already had the future mapped out for them, but Starr stressed that cheating would not solve all of their problems.  When Starr asked Langston if she still loved Markko, Langston was not sure of her feelings.  However, Langston did not want to break it off with Ford but at the same time, did not want to lose Markko.  Langston explained that she and Ford could connect while Markko worshipped her and put her on a pedestal, which made her feel uncomfortable.  \n\n\nStarr maintained that it would kill Markko to find out and that Langston was going to have \"to choose because you can't have it both ways.\"  Langston begged Starr to keep everything a secret and to please not tell Markko -- just as Markko entered the room.\n\n\nJohn, in search of Roxy, rang the bell in the lobby of Roxy's boardinghouse, but Roxy was nowhere to be found.  Marty greeted John in the lobby with a kiss. John asked about Roxy and explained that he wanted to inform Roxy that her \"old pal, Alison Perkins, is on the loose.\"  Marty remembered Alison as being violent.  John admitted to fearing that Alison was targeting Roxy, Jessica, and Natalie and said that he suggested that they go to London to visit Bree.  Marty exclaimed, \"Good!\"\n\n\nWhen Kyle entered the lobby, John asked first about Roxy and then about Mitch Lawrence.  Kyle did not know where Roxy was but informed John that Mitch still had maximum-security in prison.  John requested that Kyle have Roxy call him, but Kyle wanted to know if Roxy was in trouble.  Marty seemed shaky and mentioned that she was hot.  John asked Kyle to check on her but Marty refused.  Marty told Kyle that she had just had a checkup and that everything was good.  Kyle was satisfied with this information and left.  \n\n\nMarty told John to go find Roxy but John insisted that he would not leave her and to \"get used to it.\"  Pleased, Marty described John as the town hero that people counted on to keep safe.  John agreed to go to work if he could take Marty to the hospital first.  As John received a phone call relating that Roxy was nowhere to be found, Marty fainted in his arms.\n\n\nAs Alison was holding Roxy hostage in Kyle's apartment, Alison showed Sierra Rose a book of fairy tales and indicated to Sierra Rose that she would read about a little girl who grew up to be a princess \"just like you.\"  Alison explained, \"I care about Mitch, and this little brat is going to save his life.\"  When Roxy asked what Alison meant, Alison replied that it was not what Sierra Rose would do for Alison but what Schuyler would do for Sierra Rose.  In order for Schuyler to get Sierra Rose back, he would have to break Mitch out of prison.  Alison revealed that Mitch had a message to deliver, and Roxy suggested that he deliver it from prison.  Alison replied, \"His gifts are wasted in prison but he won't be there long because I'm going to free him.\"  \n\n\nWhen Roxy asked why, Alison claimed that she was loyal and had a foolproof plan to break Mitch out of prison.  Alison explained that Schuyler would do that for Sierra Rose, and all that Schuyler had to do was to get into Statesville and Mitch would do the rest.  Alison told Roxy to sit back and prepare for the arrival.  Roxy reflected, \"The arrival -- that's what you said the day that Rex was born.  You said to prepare for the arrival and you would take care of everything.\"  Roxy also observed that it was a miracle that Rex was even alive the way that they were rushed to the hospital.  \n\n\nAlison yelled, \"You believed the lie I told you the day your son was born.  That precious, little baby -- the boy who almost died -- that lie!\"  Roxy inquired about the lie that Alison had talked about that Mitch did not know.  Alison claimed that the lie would \"blow up your life\" and Roxy hollered, \"Lay it on me, dirtbag!\"  Alison told Roxy not to say that Alison did not warn Roxy just before Alison revealed lie.\n\n\nAt Statesville, Schuyler entered the infirmary where Kyle was treating a patient.  Schuyler announced that he was taking over Kyle's rounds and needed Kyle's badge.  Relieved, Kyle gave him the badge and left.  Schuyler unlocked the medicine cabinet and removed some drugs.\n\n\nRoxy cried that what Alison told her could not be true, but Alison said to think back and that Roxy would remember.  Roxy admitted to maybe knowing but never wanting to believe it.  Kyle entered his apartment and found Roxy crying.  Alison entered the room and introduced herself to Kyle as \"Alison Perkins -- the escaped mental patient.\"  Alison then demanded that Kyle shut up and lock the door.  Alison accused Roxy with \"You told me that lover boy wasn't due for hours and now here he is -- using all of my rope.  I'm at the end of my rope.\"  After Alison was done laughing, she informed Kyle that he would do as he was told because she had something that he wanted.\n\n\nTodd and Kelly went to the prison to visit Mitch.  On seeing Kelly, Mitch exclaimed, \"Hmm...the lovely and talented Kelly Cramer.  To what do I owe this pleasure?\"  Kelly replied, \" I have a question.  Did you kill my mother?\"  Mitch could only reply, \"I'm sorry for your loss, Kelly.\"  Mitch also observed, \"Melinda was quite a woman, that is, until she lost her mind -- but that seems to run in the family.  Tell me, my dear, how is your mental health?\"  \n\n\nTodd defended Kelly with his reply that it was better than Mitch's.  Kelly demanded to know if Mitch put the hit on her mother but Mitch only wanted to know if Todd used the Marty Saybrooke method to win over another Cramer woman.  Kelly informed Mitch that she only worked for Todd, but Mitch stated that Todd had a tendency to blur the lines of the boundary of issues to where a lady could start out working for Todd but end up working under him.  When Kelly questioned him further, Mitch admitted to nothing but stated that did not mean that Melinda was not murdered or that he did not know who did it.  As Mitch started to tell Kelly what he knew, he collapsed in pain.  \n\n\nKelly screamed, \"Tell me -- what do you know?\"  Mitch continued to roll around in pain.  Todd told the guard to let Mitch die as the guard was calling for help.  Kelly begged, \"Please, Mitch, who killed her?\"   Mitch replied, \"Not yet -- there's so much left to do.\"  As Kelly was asking the guard to let her into the cell, Schuyler arrived with his medical bag.  When the guard indicated concern for Schuyler's safety, Schuyler announced, \"Don't worry.  He won't hurt me.  He knows it's my job to save him.  Don't you, Mitch?\"  The guard and Schuyler took Mitch to the prison infirmary. \n\n\nAfter they left, Kelly convinced Todd to \"toss his cell\" in search of evidence of what happened to her mother.  Kelly found Mitch's Bible with a note stating \"3/26 = D day.\"  As Kelly asked Todd for the date, they left the cell.  After Schuyler and Mitch arrived in the infirmary, Schuyler got rid of the nurse first and then the guard.  Schuyler said to Mitch, \"Alison sent me.\"  Todd and Kelly wanted to enter the infirmary, but they and the guard were locked out.  In the infirmary, Mitch stated, \"I assume our transport is waiting at the ambulance bay.\"  Schuyler responded, \"No, you are not going anywhere.  Not until I get my daughter back.\"\n\n \n\n\n",
