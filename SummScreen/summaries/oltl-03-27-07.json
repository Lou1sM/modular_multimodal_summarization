Starr informed him that Cole is on his way to military school and she'll never see him again. Meanwhile, Cole tried to get out of going to military school, but a furious Marty said she was sending him away so that she wouldn't lose him like she lost his father. At the diner, Jessica dropped Bree off for a visit with Nash, who insisted she stay. At the Palace, Adriana looked at photos of Tate, which he interpreted as flattery. Bo called Rex to the police station and offered him a wad of cash. Antonio and Talia informed Nora and Evangeline that they may have a lead on the arsonist. \n\n\nBo explained to Rex that the money was Roxy's, from the salon robbery. Rex told Bo about the crazy underwear photo shoot and how Tate is starting to get in his way with Adriana. Bo advised him to express his concern to Adriana. Rex thanked him and took off to deliver Roxy's money. Meanwhile, Antonio and Talia presented Nora with the photo of the medallion that Talia spotted at the site. Nora was not impressed with the blurry photo. Bo pulled her into his office to let her vent. He calmed her down and she apologized to Talia for blowing up at her. Later, Antonio suggested that Talia get hypnotized to jog her memory.\n\n\nBo visited Matthew, who was home sick and complained about staying at Asa's. Bo invited Matthew to stay with him, but Matthew admitted to being worried about his mom and said he wanted to keep her company. Bo promised to keep an eye on her, too. Matthew told Bo he'd been spending a lot of time with Asa and Clint but missed his friends. Bo offered to handle Matthew's \"social calendar\" so that he could have some friends over to Asa's.\n\n\nTate and Adriana talked about their embarrassing incident at the lodge and he assured her that he'd never make a move on another guy's girl. Tate ran into some lusty female fans who invited him upstairs, and he planted a kiss on Adriana to make them think he was already taken. Afterward, Tate apologized, but made it clear that he'd pursue Adriana if she wasn't with Rex. \n\n\nCole argued that his mom was sending him away to control him, not protect him. Marty explained that she's doing the best she can without her husband. Meanwhile, Todd tried to convince Starr that there would be other loves in her life and that Cole wasn't worthy of Starr's love. He reminded her that she once thought Travis was the only guy she'd ever love, but Starr said this was nothing like that, that she'd never get over Cole. When Cole called Starr, Todd picked up the phone instead and told the teen that he would slap him with a restraining order if he tried to contact Starr again. Todd then threatened to keep Starr's phone and told her that he just wanted to keep her safe and she wouldn't return to school until Cole was out of town.\n\n\nJessica tried to drop off Bree and run, but Nash pleaded with her to stay. Nash created an awkward moment when he noted that Tess used to wake up smiling just like Bree. He apologized and Jessica told him to call Antonio when he was ready to return Bree. After he left, Jessica thought back to Marty asking her to write down who she wants to be with. She opened the piece of paper privately, revealing that the name she wrote down was Nash. \n\n\nEvangeline dropped off a case file for Marty, who was being summoned to testify on behalf of a defendant. Evangeline picked on her for going soft on \"perps.\" Their conversation quickly turned to Todd, and Marty got Evangeline to open up about her feelings, admitting that she's not over Cristian. Vange complimented Marty on how she handled the situation with Starr and Cole, and Marty said she was truly sorry about Vange's breakup. The ladies parted on a good note. \n\n\nRex returned the cash to Roxy, who could tell that something was bothering him. He admitted that Tate might be giving him a run for his money. Roxy wondered if Rex was being \"two-timed,\" but he assured her that he wasn't \u2014 Tate just takes his shirt off a lot for Adriana's job. Roxy tried to convince Rex that his pecs are just as good as this guy's, then put her foot in her mouth when she learned that he was talking about Tate Harmon the baseball player and implied that Rex might not be in the same league. She offered him a \"fancy-schmancy\" lunch at the Palace to apologize. \n\n\nTate continued to butter up Adriana, telling her how unbelievable gorgeous she is just as Roxy and Rex walked in. Rex walked over to their table and asked if he was interrupting something. Evangeline went to The Sun office to see Todd and looked like she was preparing to say something important. Meanwhile, Starr ran over to Cole's house, and he told her he had a plan: They would run away together. \n\n\n",
