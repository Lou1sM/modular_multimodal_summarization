    "soap_central": "\n\nAlone in the office, Jared and Natalie had a heart-to-heart discussion. He told her that sometimes people got stuck doing things they didn't want to and that their reasons could be well intentioned, even if someone accidentally got hurt. She responded that she would be upset to learn that someone wasn't who she thought they were. Feeling sure that she was speaking about him, Jared leaned in close, about to kiss Nat. They pulled apart abruptly when Clint walked in and announced that he wanted all Buchanan family board members to work off-site at the Buchanan cabin, effective immediately. He thought that all of the recent work with the new Cobb acquisition would cause burnout and that some time working away and a change of scenery would benefit everyone. He asked Jared and Nat to head there right away. Viki stopped by to see how Charlie's interview went and learned that he was concerned that Clint was taking too much of a personal interest in him. \n\n\nWhile spending a lovely afternoon off in bed, Jessica worried that Nash was getting in too deep with his new silent partners and the amount of money involved. He asked her not to worry and to trust him because their dream was coming true. She disclosed her fear of his forgetting about her as he appeared to be more obsessed with the vineyard every day. She surprised him with a family photo album that she had made. When Nash received a business call, he assured the party that everything was under control and immediately began to dress. He revealed that his business trip to Napa had been moved up to the next day and he had much to take care of, beginning with a meeting with Sarah. \n\n\nOver at the diner, Blair met with Antonio and Cris to formalize her purchase of Capricorn. She advised Antonio that he still had all owner's privileges, which included free drinks. Spying Markko, Blair decided to have a chat about Cole and Starr, mentioning that she had found Cole sneaking into the house. Markko admitted that it had been his idea but he thought it terrible to keep Starr and Cole apart. Blair reminded him of how Todd would have reacted if he had seen Cole. She only wanted to keep them protected. They decided that Cole might listen to John. A couple of cops sitting at the counter attempted to tease Antonio about Talia spending lots of time with John, but Antonio practically ripped their heads off in anger, suggesting that they had too much time on their hands. Cris was curious about Antonio's reaction and asked his brother if he had a problem with Talia and John working together. An annoyed Antonio cited the fact that the duo was only concerned with getting rid of Ramsey but he felt that the new head cop was doing everything by the book. Ramsey was even willing to provide him with the resources to clean up Angel Square, Antonio told his brother. \n\n\nAt the police station, Ramsey received a phone call that seemed to put him on edge, as he assured the unseen party that he would find a way to come up with the money. John also received a call, which appeared to result in another dead end, as he and Talia tried to find a way to \"stick it\" to Ramsey. Leaving their latest report on the commissioner's desk, John and Talia learned that he was not happy with it and he was not receptive to John's instincts regarding the case. Talia wanted to keep on working another case, while John pointed out that he wasn't used to working with someone else, especially someone on offense. Talia stated that she was a double threat, able to work both offense and defense. As they joked together, Antonio walked in and threw them dirty looks. Later, Ramsey made it known that he liked Antonio's ideas regarding Angel Square, and that Antonio would get funds, but Ramsey also had some suggestions. Talia sighed and rolled her eyes, which enraged Antonio. \"What the hell was that about?\" he asked her. He proceeded to tell Talia off while she in turn told him he was clueless, and that Ramsey was using him. He made it known that he was not happy over her and John whispering and laughing, and that they were not acting like co-workers. As they argued, Ramsey gleefully watched from his office. Antonio took it too far when he suggested that John was out to nail someone else, besides Ramsey. Talia quickly slapped him. \n\n\nClint interviewed Charlie and told him that his interest was not personal. He pointed out that the company would be taking on more work and was interested in knowing if Charlie could handle it. Charlie assured him that his work spoke for him and Clint appreciated the honest answer. He did warn Charlie, however, that the family would not want to see Viki hurt. Charlie quickly told him that he wouldn't want to see that either. Jared tried to pick up where he left off with Natalie, who quickly advised him that nothing happened and stalked off. Nigel, there to help the family with their move to the cabin, asked Jared if he was having a problem with his niece. He cited the epic tragedy in place, so Shakespearean in nature. He reminded Jared that he had betrayed the Buchanans also, though Jared still felt sure that Nigel would be forgiven, especially if it were pointed out that Jared forced him to do what he did. Nigel thought that Jared had turned out to be honorable, and more worthy of the Buchanan name than the real heir, David Vickers. Jared appreciated the butler for watching his back, though Nigel didn't think it would be too helpful when the truth came out. Nat went to see Viki, who was waiting for Charlie, and told her she didn't get it. She wanted to know why something that was so wrong in her head felt so right in her heart. Viki advised her that time would work things out. She admitted that she and Charlie were very happy but that it seemed almost too good to be true. She told her daughter to relax at the cabin retreat. Charlie saw his son and thanked Jared for the honest discussion from the other day. Jared acknowledged that he didn't know how much longer he'd be able to keep up the charade. He also no longer hated Charlie, who offered to stand by him. Charlie felt that their relationship was worth everything to him and he hated lying to Viki. Hopefully, she would forgive Charlie if she loved him. Charlie advised Viki that things went well. Clint caught them kissing. \n\n\nSarah agreed to meet with Nash at the diner. He suggested that Jess head to Cris's place to pick up his artwork for the vineyard. Jess was worried that Nash was going to ask his new partners for more money. She received a call from Clint, informing her of the upcoming Buchanan quality time at the cabin. \n\n\nJess arrived at the studio and admired an old portrait of herself. Cris suggested that she hadn't changed; Jess stated that everyone did. She voiced her concern over Nash and the vineyard and the fact that things seemed to be moving too quickly. \n\n\nSarah learned that the presentation had been moved up. Nash thought his decision to hire Sarah was smart and told her it was an informed decision. He added that she was a knockout, which Sarah took offense to. He assured her she wouldn't be on display and that he had merely paid her a compliment. He apologized. Blair asked John to meet with her at the diner. She filled him in on Cole sneaking into her house to see Starr. She defended Todd. She told John that she was scared for the kids and things were spinning out of control. John wondered if she was talking about the kids or herself and Todd. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "At the police station, Antonio is very uneasy with how friendly Talia and John are becoming. She is very disappointed in how Antonio is afraid to defy Ramsey. He is getting very stressed over losing his business and his personal issues. Blair tells John that she hopes he can talk some sense into Cole before he gets into trouble for what she recently noticed when he snuck into the house to see Starr. Jared is very tempted to tell Natalie the truth. But he's afraid of the consequences. Charlie is similarly afraid to confess to Viki that he lied. Nash is burying himself in business and Jessica feels shut out. Nash is getting friendly with Sarah. And Jessica is getting friendly with Cristian.",
