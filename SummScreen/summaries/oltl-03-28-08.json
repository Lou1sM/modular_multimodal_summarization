Natalie appeared uncomfortable when Nigel and Matthew left the cabin to get additional supplies for the upcoming weekend. After observing Jared starring intensely at her, Natalie threatened to leave. Jared assured Natalie that his only intention was to complete his necessary projects for Buchanan Enterprises. Natalie continued to be annoyed by Jared's apparent feelings for her. When Nigel phoned and stated that he and Matthew were stranded due to the snowstorm, Natalie nearly panicked. Seconds later, the storm caused a blackout in the cabin. \n\n\nAt Buchanan Enterprises, Nora and Clint shared an intimate moment before heading to the cabin. Noticing Clint's somber mood, Nora asked what was bothering him. Before Clint could respond, an upset Bo appeared and stated that he needed to speak with Clint. Alone with Clint, Bo expressed his displeasure with Clint's handling of B.E. business. Bo realized that certain measures were necessary, but didn't agree with the method Clint chose to employ. Clint apologized and assured Bo that other enemies of Asa were making plans to attack B.E. Clint asked Bo to join forces with him, and expose the culprits. Bo agreed and decided to join the rest of the family at the cabin. Nora entered the room and told Bo that Matthew had left his laptop, containing his homework, at the mansion. Hoping to save time, Clint suggested that Nora and Bo retrieve Matthew's laptop and travel to the lodge together. Clint promised to meet them there later. Surprised by Clint's request, Nora asked Bo if he had a problem with the two of them traveling together. Bo stated that the trip would only take a few hours and everything should be fine. Later, Lindsay arrived at B.E. looking for Bo. When Lindsay inquired how business was doing, Clint treated Lindsay coldly and told her that he would no longer need her services. Clint said that he and Bo would handle any further attacks made on B.E. Lindsay reminded Clint that Bo would never approve of the tactics Clint used to gain control over Honeycutt and Cobb. Lindsay told Clint that she had heard B.E. was being targeted by others. Upset that he had allowed Lindsay to influence his decision making, Clint asked Lindsay to leave and told her that he was headed to the lodge. Lindsay was horrified to learn that Bo and Nora were on their way to the cabin alone. On the verge of near panic, Lindsay demanded that Clint take her to the cabin, stating that Bo was her legal guardian and she should be in his care. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr stood in her room staring at a photo of her and Cole. As Starr sadly cradled a small paper bag, there was a knock on the door. Starr quickly placed the bag under her bed and allowed Langston entry. When Langston asked if Starr were sick, Starr nervously asked her friend if she looked sick. Langston was worried because Starr didn't attend class. Starr informed Langston that Todd was home schooling her; he feared Starr and Cole might encounter one another in the school halls. As Starr recounted the restrictions placed on her, an angry Starr told Langston that Todd was ruining her life. When Langston suggested that Cole sneaking into the mansion the previous night might have been a mistake, Starr stated that those few moments were the happiest she had experienced in weeks. Although Starr wanted to be with Cole, she revealed that Todd would send Cole to prison if she made one more mistake. After Langston left, Starr reached under the bed and pulled out the small paper bag. Meanwhile downstairs, Addie approached an aggravated Todd and suggested that he was destroying his family. Addie told Todd that he couldn't keep Starr locked away forever, and expressed her belief that Cole would never hurt Starr. Todd began belittling Addie and even called her insane, but Addie stood her ground with Todd. Addie told Todd that his actions could possibly cause him to lose Starr forever. Addie stated that Blair was becoming afraid of Todd. When Addie reminded him of all the time she had lost in Blair's life, Todd appeared to have a moment of regret. \n\n\nObserved by several other officers, Antonio and Talia argued about her friendship with John. Talia told Antonio that she wanted to help John discover any wrongdoings that Ramsey might be involved in. When Antonio refused to listen to her and suggested that John was interested in her sexually, Talia became enraged and slapped Antonio. Worried by the closeness developing between Antonio and Ramsey, Talia asked Antonio what was actually bothering him. Talia wondered if Antonio was terrified at losing his inheritance and worried about Jamie's future. When Talia expressed the hurt she felt by Antonio suggesting that she would flirt with his friend, Antonio told her that he felt the situation had gone beyond flirting. A saddened Talia watched as Antonio walked away. Peering from his window, Ramsey smiled to himself as he watched the entire interaction between Talia and Antonio. Ramsey called Antonio into his office and asked him to look over John and Talia's file concerning an impending drug transaction. Ramsey wanted Antonio's advice on whether the informant could be trusted. Antonio promised to check out the informant. Ramsey mentioned the argument between Antonio and Talia, and stated that he didn't want personal business to get in the way of police work. Antonio assured Ramsey that his personal life wouldn't interfere with his job. Later, Antonio told Ramsey that all the information concerning the informant and the upcoming drug transaction appeared to be reliable. \n\n\nBlair met John at the diner and discussed Cole's recent pursuit of Starr. As Blair pleaded with John to convince Cole to stay away from Starr, John suggested that Blair was afraid of Todd. Blair insisted that she didn't fear Todd and was worried for Cole. Blair revealed to John that Todd was aware of Cole shooting Miles, and assured John that Todd would convince Ramsey to reopen the case. When John refused to believe that Todd would join forces with Ramsey, Blair was adamant that Todd would do anything to prevent Cole from being in Starr's life. After Blair left, John phoned Cole and requested that they meet at the diner. Seconds later, John became concerned when an upset Talia entered the diner. When Talia told John about her encounter with Antonio, John became upset and told Talia that he intended to set the record straight with Antonio. Talia attempted to stop him, but John stormed out of the diner and headed for the station. At the station, John confronted Antonio and told him that he was hurting Talia. The two became embroiled in a heated argument. An angry Antonio warned John to stay away from Talia. John told Antonio he wouldn't put Talia through such turmoil if he truly cared for her. Unable to reason with Antonio, John left. As Ramsey watched the episode from his window, a smirk crossed his face. \n\n\nWhen Cole arrived at the diner, Markko warned him that Blair had told John about Cole's encounter with Starr the previous night. Cole told Markko that those few moments with Starr were worth any backlash he might face with Todd. Cole stated that no one would ever keep him from Starr. John met Cole at the diner and questioned Cole about his actions. As John continued to plead with Cole to let Starr go, Cole refused to listen. Once John warned Cole that Starr might be forced to lie to the authorities to protect him, Cole contended that he didn't want Starr to experience any more pain because of him. Cole promised John he would stay away from Starr. \n\n\nJohn suggested that Talia steer clear of Antonio for the time being. Talia agreed that perhaps she needed to give Antonio some space. \n\n\nWhile driving to the lodge, Nora and Bo encountered the dangerous snowstorm. When Nora asked Bo about his intense conversation with Clint, Bo refused to give her any information. As they continued their journey, Nora and Bo began relating well with one another. They discussed how proud they were of Matthew. As they laughed and shared special memories from the past, suddenly a look of horror crossed Nora's face and she let out a heart-wrenching scream. As Nora yelled for Bo to look out, Bo attempted to gain control of the car. The screeching of brakes was heard and the glare of headlights loomed in the darkness. \n\n\nOn the way to the lodge, Clint suggested that Lindsay warn Bo that she was on her way to the cabin. Lindsay stated that neither Bo nor Nora would be pleased to have Lindsay and Clint show up. When Clint told Lindsay that Bo and Nora would never consider rekindling their relationship, Lindsay reminded Clint of his recent indiscretion. Lindsay stated that under good or bad circumstances, no one could be trusted. \n\n\nBlair returned home to find a depressed Todd. Todd told Blair that Addie convinced him that he was causing Starr pain. Todd stated that he didn't want to lose Starr and couldn't stand how their relationship was suffering. Todd asked Blair for her advice. Blair asked Todd to give Starr some space. Upstairs, Starr pulled a small box from the bag. Suddenly, Langston opened Starr's bedroom door. A startled Starr turned around-revealing a home pregnancy test. Langston stood in shock. \n\n\nBack at the station, Ramsey placed a call to someone and stated that he hoped to have the money within a week. Talia approached Antonio and attempted to speak with him, but Antonio walked away. \n\n\nForced to build a fire, Natalie and Jared began to relax and enjoy one another's company. Suddenly Jared told Natalie that nothing had changed, and began passionately kissing her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
