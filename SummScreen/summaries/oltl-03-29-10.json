Langston wanted to figure out what to do before anyone found out about her affair. She begged Starr not to say anything to Markko, just as Markko walked in the apartment door. Langston convinced him that she and Starr were talking about casting for the musical and that they had just gotten carried away. Langston was relieved when Starr backed her up. Markko told the girls how everybody had been tense lately. He told them about the run-in with Ford at the Buenos D\u00edas and asked if Langston was sleeping with Ford.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Marty reassured John that Roxy was probably just doing laundry downstairs when Marty suddenly passed out. John caught her and covered her with a blanket. Fish arrived as John called an ambulance. John tried to coax Marty into waking up. When she did, she asked what happened and how long she had been out for. She wondered if something was wrong with the baby. John informed her that he had called 9-1-1, but told Fish to notify Kyle.\n\n\nNatalie hysterically knocked on Schuyler's door and called his name through the door. T\u00e9a, also headed to Schuyler's, saw Natalie and asked what she was doing there. Natalie said that she needed to talk to Schuyler. T\u00e9a wondered if it had to do with the custody hearing, but Natalie said that she was worried about Roxy and wanted to know if Schuyler had seen her. T\u00e9a questioned why Natalie thought Schuyler would know where Roxy was. Natalie, noticeably frazzled, reminded the lawyer that Schuyler used to live in Roxy's hotel. T\u00e9a speculated that Natalie's worry had something to do with Allison Perkins. Natalie denied the assumption, but T\u00e9a suggested that they find the superintendent to let them into Schuyler's apartment anyway.\n\n\nAt the infirmary at Statesville, Schuyler blocked the double entrance doors with a crutch. Mitch inquired about his getaway car, but Schuyler informed Mitch that, unless Schuyler got his daughter back, Mitch wasn't going anywhere. As the prison guard banged on the door to the infirmary, Bo entered with two cops intending to talk to Mitch. Kelly let Bo know that she wasn't leaving until she asked Mitch about her mother's death. Bo enlightened Kelly and Todd about the danger of talking to Mitch, and about the fact that Allison Perkins was at large. Bo ordered the guard to open the door, but the guard was unable to because it was locked from the inside. As the guard attempted to open the door, Schuyler ordered Mitch to call Allison that second, and told Mitch that, if Schuyler didn't get his daughter back, Mitch would be a dead man.\n\n\nAt Rex's apartment, Rex and Gigi tried to relax after getting back from court. Gigi updated Rex on Schuyler's recent odd behavior. Gigi was convinced that it wasn't just because of T\u00e9a that Schuyler wouldn't let Gigi see Sierra. Gigi thought something was wrong with Schuyler and that he was hiding something from her. Rex knew that it was hard to deal with, but he implored Gigi to forget about Schuyler and Sierra for the time being. He assured her that by the same time tomorrow, they would be taking Sierra home. Gigi reminded him that they couldn't count on that, and said they needed to prepare for Schuyler getting custody of Sierra.\n\n\nInside Kyle's room, Allison told the bound Kyle and Roxy that Schuyler was going to break Mitch out of Statesville because she had Sierra. Kyle attempted to convince Allison that there was a good chance of mistaken paternity -- Schuyler might not be Sierra's father. Thinking Kyle was talking about Rex, Allison told him that the baby's paternity was old news, and that Schuyler was definitely the father. Making an effort to convince Allison, Kyle confided that Stacy had tried to seduce him as well. Allison informed him that she was aware Stacy was \"a harlot\" as she pointed her gun at Kyle. She respected Kyle for his distraction attempt, although she didn't appreciate the mind games. Suddenly, there was knocking on the door as Fish arrived to get Kyle's help for Marty.\n\n\nIn London, Viki looked at a picture of herself and Charlie as her phone rang. She answered her phone for the \"unavailable number\" and found that it was Dorian. Viki asked if there was something wrong. Dorian replied by again telling Viki to give Charlie another chance. Dorian asked if, since there were three thousand miles between Viki and Charlie, Viki wanted to spend the rest of her life alone. Viki guaranteed that she was only traveling for the sake of Jessica and Bree. Dorian pointed out that Viki wasn't perfect, and asked why Viki couldn't forgive Charlie. Viki wondered how it was any of Dorian's business.\n\n\nMarkko explained to Langston and Starr the argument he overheard between Hannah and Ford at the diner. He told them that Hannah was convinced that Ford was sleeping with Langston, but the teens attributed the accusation to the possibility that she had become a stalker. Langston wondered where the idea could have come from. Markko believed that, since Ford apparently takes girls into his office, Hannah saw Langston there waiting for Markko and invented the whole thing out of jealousy. Because of this, Markko wanted Langston to stay away from Ford as a favor. As Markko headed off to take a shower, Langston expressed her disbelief that Hannah thought Langston slept with Ford. Starr asked, \"why, if it's true?\"\n\n\nMitch warned Schuyler not to test him. Allison had instructions if Schuyler failed to break Mitch out of jail. Bo's knocks on the door were met with a reply from Schuyler threatening Mitch's life. Since Schuyler knew that Allison wouldn't take chances with Mitch's life, Schuyler upped the ante by stabbing Mitch with a syringe filled with a liquid that could stop Mitch's heart for real.\n\n\nThe warden realized that Schuyler wasn't even on the schedule for that night, and speculated that Schuyler had a score to settle if he went so far out of his way to get Mitch alone. As Todd told Bo to let Schuyler kill Mitch, Kelly revealed that she had been researching the custody case and that there was no connection between Schuyler and Mitch.\n\n\nGigi told Rex that it seemed like Schuyler wanted to tell her something, but T\u00e9a wouldn't let him. Rex said that Schuyler was acting odd because it was probably Schuyler's last night with his daughter. Gigi disclosed that Schuyler had said he needed to protect his daughter, but Gigi was sure he wasn't talking about her. Rex thanked God that Sierra wasn't related to Mitch, who would probably be the biggest danger to her. As the two parents worried about Shane, Gigi headed out to pick her son up at Mo and Noelle's. Gigi walked out, and Rex looked miserable that she was already gone.\n\n\nAs Fish begged Kyle to leave his room and help Marty, Allison pointed her gun at the door. Unexpectedly, Allison's phone rang. She happily greeted Mitch as he implored her to get to Statesville immediately with Sierra or else he was a dead man. Before Allison left, she pointed her gun at her two hostages.\n\n\nAs John and Marty tried to keep one another calm, Marty wondered where the ambulance was. John assured her that it would be there as soon as Marty took the blanket off of herself. John noticed blood on the blanket and tried to hide it from Marty, but she asked him what was wrong. He said nothing was wrong, but Marty started to get upset when she spotted the blood on the blanket. Fish returned to the lobby of the hotel without Kyle. He began to look for Kyle's room key in Roxy's desk as the medics arrived. While Marty worried about a miscarriage, Natalie called John. John ignored the call and comforted Marty while the medics wheeled the stretcher out of the hotel.\n\n\nDorian accused Viki of fleeing Llanview when her family needed her: Dorian enlightened Viki that Allison Perkins was on the loose and, \"anything can happen.\" Viki already knew because Clint had called her, and she wasn't worried because her daughters had police protection. Dorian became frustrated, implying that Mitch had something to do with her sister's sudden death. Viki vowed to return home if her family really needed her.\n\n\nStarr was appalled when Langston told her that Langston needed to hear Ford's side of the story about whether or not he was sleeping with her and Hannah at the same time. Before Starr could leave to find Cole, Langston begged her not to tell Cole. Starr told Langston that she felt bad lying to Cole and Markko. Langston confessed the same, but Starr said Langston apparently didn't feel bad enough to stop cheating on Markko. Against her better judgment, Starr agreed to keep Langston's secret, \"for now,\" and left to find Cole. With Starr gone, Langston and Markko had the beginnings of a romantic night in.\n\n\nSchuyler asked Mitch if he felt the effects of the drug yet, and said that he would give Mitch the antidote as soon as he got his daughter back. After banging on the infirmary door some more, Bo asked Todd and Kelly why they were still there, and promised to arrest them if they didn't leave. Bo decided to put the two into a room with a guard to ensure their safety because, \"anything can happen.\" Suddenly, Allison, holding Sierra Rose, held a guard at gunpoint and demanded to be let into the infirmary. Once she was inside, Schuyler demanded to have his daughter back. Allison pointed her gun at Schuyler and told him that he wouldn't get his daughter back until he gave Mitch the antidote.\n\n\nFish finally got into Kyle's room and found Kyle and Roxy tied up. While Fish untied the pair, Kyle explained what had happened with Allison and Roxy ran out of the room. Fish immediately phoned Bo and informed him about Allison. After getting off the phone with Bo, Fish decided that it was time to find out whether or not he was Sierra's father. He found the envelope and, with Kyle's full support, opened it. Looking shocked, Fish divulged, \"I'm a match. I am Sierra's father.\"\n\n\nAfter the super let the women into Schuyler's apartment, Natalie confided to T\u00e9a everything that had happened with Allison Perkins at Foxy Roxy's that day, including the fact that Allison had disappeared with Roxy and Sierra Rose. Natalie was distraught when John didn't answer her call about Allison, so she left Schuyler's to go find Rex. Rex had no idea where Roxy was. A minute after Natalie walked into Rex's apartment, however, so did a dazed Roxy, telling her children that Allison had Sierra Rose.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Allison holds Kyle and Roxy hostage until she learns that Schuyler could be endangering Mitch unless he gets his baby daughter back. And she's not going to let that happen. Natalie and Tea try to find them. Rex and Gigi don't know what happened to Schuyler or baby Sierra. Marty passes out and gets taken to the hospital afraid she might be miscarrying. Starr finds out that Langston cheated on Markko with Ford and is very disappointed in her. Yet Markko still does not believe what he heard alleged by Hannah that she \"suspected\" that ford was sleeping with Langston.",
