Todd demanded to know who had married Blair. His surprise turned to fury when John stood up and announced, \"That would be me!\" \n\n\nTodd explained to the judge that T\u00e9a had helped him gain custody of Starr by marrying him. An irate T\u00e9a approached Todd and insisted that she married him for love. She demanded to know if he had ever loved her. Todd made it clear that his relationship with T\u00e9a had nothing to do with love. \n\n\nTodd accused T\u00e9a and John of conspiring in an attempt to deny him custody of his children. The judge's suspicions were raised when Todd claimed that John was still harboring feelings for Marty. John swore that he and Marty were only friends. Proclaiming his love for Blair, John insisted that her near-death experience had helped him realize his true feelings. \n\n\nTodd was devastated when Starr took the stand. Starr pleaded with the judge to allow her and her siblings to remain with John. Citing several of Todd's past misdeeds, Starr told the judge that John was a better father than Todd. The judge called a brief recess. \n\n\nAt the recess, Todd accused T\u00e9a of turning Starr against him. T\u00e9a informed Todd that he had caused his own pain. Todd told T\u00e9a that he understood why she walked out on him - she was still in love with him and wanted payback. \n\n\nAfter the recess, everyone returned to the courtroom to learn the judge's decision. Todd was outraged when the judge announced that the children were to remain in the custody of Blair and John. Todd accused John of stealing Marty, Blair, and his children from him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Addie tried to cheer up Blair by reminding her that she was Mrs. John McBain. Remembering the events that led up to her wedding day, Blair informed her mother that John had only married her to prevent Todd from winning custody. The previous day, T\u00e9a had suggested that John marry Blair. Assuring him that the judge would rule to keep the children with Blair if she had a husband, T\u00e9a argued that it was their only hope of winning. \n\n\nAlong with Dorian, T\u00e9a urged John to propose to Blair. After kicking Dorian and T\u00e9a out of her room, Blair told John that he wasn't obligated to marry her, and reminded him that he still had feelings for Marty. Advising Blair that she stood a chance of losing her children to Todd, John insisted on marrying her. Afterward, Blair accepted John's proposal and the two wed, in Blair's hospital room, in the presence of Starr, Addie, Dorian, and Mike. \n\n\nAddie was shocked that the word love was never mentioned. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Jessica approached Marty. Noticing Marty's aloof behavior, Jessica apologized for her role in Todd's scheme. Explaining her illness to Marty, Jessica begged for forgiveness and reminded Marty that they were once good friends. To Jessica's surprise, Marty forgave her. \n\n\nAfter Jessica and Marty became reacquainted, Marty gave Jessica an update on Cole's progress and her troubles with Nora. Jessica asked Marty about her relationship with John. When Marty mentioned that John had been a good friend to her, Jessica pointed out the many instances in which John had helped Marty. Realizing that Marty still had feelings for John, Jessica encouraged her friend to pursue a possible relationship with him. Marty told Jessica that John was involved with Blair, but Jessica insisted that Marty explore her options with John. \n\n\nJessica finally convinced Marty to tell John how she felt about him. Filled with hope, Marty told Jessica that she knew where John was and planned on going to him at once. Marty wondered if Jessica had someone special in her life. When Jessica admitted that she was attracted to someone but they had decided to remain friends, Marty suggested that Jessica take her own advice. Admitting that Marty was right, Jessica decided to locate Brody and discuss their relationship. \n\n\nAs John attempted to phone Marty, she surprised him at the courthouse. An elated Marty stated that she had something to tell him. John told Marty that he needed to talk to her. In a subdued voice, John informed Marty that he had married Blair. \n\n\nTodd phoned Blair and vowed to seek revenge against her and John. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian slapped Ray after he kissed her. When Dorian informed Ray that she was happily married to an aspiring Hollywood actor, he balked at her. As Dorian chastised him for questioning her marriage, David interrupted the discussion with a phone call. While David detailed his adventures to Dorian, she was obviously uncomfortable as Ray stood close and gave her a seductive stare. \n\n\nAfter a nervous Dorian quickly ended her conversation with David, Ray called her a liar and insisted that she had feelings for Ray. Claiming to hate him, Dorian instructed Ray to stay away from her and ordered him out of her house. When Ray reminded her that she no longer owned La Boulaie, Dorian quipped, \"We'll see about that!\" \n\n\nDorian was thrilled when T\u00e9a arrived at La Boulaie with the good news about the custody hearing. As Dorian stepped away to write T\u00e9a a check, she overheard T\u00e9a ask Ray out on a date. Dorian appeared bothered when Ray accepted T\u00e9a's invitation. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Brody encountered Gigi crying hysterically out in the hall. Unable to calm her down, Brody ushered her into his apartment. Gigi told Brody that the Australian donor could no longer help Shane, but that another match for Shane had been located, her sister, Stacy. Brody was appalled to learn that Stacy agreed to save Shane's life only if Gigi agreed to leave Rex in return. \n\n\nBrody encouraged Gigi to be honest with Rex, but Gigi was certain that Rex would confront her and that Stacy would disappear. Insisting that she couldn't risk Shane's life, Gigi told Brody that she had to come up with a plan to convince Rex that she no longer loved him. Gigi was certain that Rex would never believe her. \n\n\nAt the hospital, as Shane asked his father for information regarding his donor, Stacy barged into the room. Although Shane was excited to see his aunt, Rex interrupted the reunion and asked Stacy to step out in the hall. \n\n\nOutside of Shane's hospital room, Rex lashed out at Stacy. He accused her of pretending to care about Gigi and drugging him. Rex told Stacy that he wanted her out of their lives. When Stacy teased him about falling for her, Rex hit the roof. He assured her that he was committed only to Gigi. While Stacy looked on, Rex placed a call to Gigi. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Gigi begged Brody to help her. Rex phoned her several times, but Gigi ignored his calls. Gigi told Brody that she couldn't talk to Rex until she had decided how she would handle the problem. \n\n\nAs Rex placed several calls to Gigi, Stacy questioned him about Gigi's whereabouts. Remembering that Gigi had stated that she had something important to take care of, Rex phoned once more. To his surprise, Brody answered. While Rex asked to speak with Gigi, she cried silently in the background. In a direct tone, Brody told Rex that Gigi was at his apartment and ordered Rex to leave her alone. \n\n\nRealizing that Rex had received troubling news, Stacy tried to pump him for information. A suspicious Rex ignored her and rushed off. Smiling to herself, Stacy returned to Shane's room. When Shane mentioned that he hadn't seen her lately, Stacy remarked, \"We'll be seeing a lot more of each other after you receive your transplant.\" \n\n\nRex arrived at Brody's front door. Calling Gigi's name, Rex opened the door to Brody's apartment. To Rex's horror, he discovered Gigi and Brody in bed together.\n\n\n",
