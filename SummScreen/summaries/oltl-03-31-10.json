    "soap_central": "\n \nOutside the Buenos Dias Cafe, Starr walked up to the door, but stopped short as she spotted Cole and Hannah inside.  Inside the restaurant, Hannah was once again venting her anger and frustration about Ford, who Cole called scum.  Hannah wanted to make Ford pay for his cavalier treatment of women, and ruin his reputation the way he'd ruined hers, but Cole wasn't sure revenge was the best option.\n\n\nStarr walked up to them, interrupted the discussion about Ford, and asked if anything was wrong.  Feeling like a third wheel, Hannah chose to leave, and Cole asked a distracted Starr if she was okay.  However, Starr's mind remained on Langston's confession about her affair with Ford.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Kim was disgusted to find David Vickers at her door.  She asked him why he'd returned to Llanview, and assumed he was there to continue to mooch off the family fortune, but David said he had another purpose: he was there for her.  Uninterested, Kim ordered him to get out, but David reminded her she couldn't kick him out of his \"ancestral home.\"  Kim told him that as Mrs. Clint Buchanan, she had all the power, and he couldn't do a thing about it.  But David begged to differ; he could get Kim to leave Clint, because her lies had finally caught up with her.\n\n\nKim laughed off David's vague threats, and reminded him that her past misdeeds were an open book; Clint had heard them all, and accepted her anyway.  She liked him, admired his integrity and strength, and wouldn't give up her new life with him and Sierra Rose for anything or anyone.  David ignored her bravado, and told Kim she'd be divorcing Clint, \"tonight!\"  He produced several papers and handed them to Kim, who was mortified by their contents.  David asked her how she'd thought no one would find out what she'd done.\n\n\nBack at the Buenos Dias, Clint and Jessica shared a meal of ice cream and compared notes about their day.  Remembering her romp with Cristian at the gym, Jessica told Clint, \"I learned how to paint.\"  She said she was enjoying working on the school stage crew, but that didn't surprise Clint, who'd always felt she'd had an artistic streak.  Jessica credited her newfound prowess to \"a good art teacher,\" who Clint accurately surmised was Cristian.  He was surprised there were only two people on the stage crew, and Jessica neglected to mention that she'd torn down the sign-up form.\n\n\nClint was unsure of Jessica's renewed friendship with Cristian, but Jessica defended herself and asked how he could judge her given his sudden marriage to the very young Kim.  She was angry that he'd kept the news from her, and Clint said he hadn't wanted to upset her during a trying time.  Jess softened, and said she'd always wanted him to reunite with Viki but she was willing to be happy for him if Kim made him happy, to which Clint replied in the affirmative.  He thanked Jessica for her support, and Jessica responded in kind, thanking him for understanding her choice to \"finish\" her senior year at Llanview High so she could correct the \"mistakes\" of the past.  Clint asked her if she was talking about losing Cristian.\n\n\nJessica insisted that she was over Cristian, and that they both had moved on; she was even going out on a date with Brody, a piece of news that thrilled Clint.  Clint called Brody a fine young man, but Jessica feared he was \"too intense\" for her.  Clint reassured her that Brody was right for her even if he seemed \"wrong\" at first, much like Kim hadn't always seemed \"right\" for him.\n\n\nClint got a business call from Buchanan Enterprises and prepared to head into the office.  Jessica told him she'd stay and get a ride with Starr, and Clint left.\n\n\nAcross town, Cristian and Layla returned home, with Cristian ready to relax after a long day at Llanview High.  He couldn't believe how tiring his new job as a teacher was, but Layla couldn't help but wonder if it was one student in particular monopolizing all his time and energy: Jessica.  She warned Cristian she didn't want to have to give a certain high school senior a \"beatdown.\"  Cris was amused by the surreal situation, but Layla didn't find it so funny.  Cristian told her not to feel threatened and insisted that Layla was his girlfriend, end of story. He sealed his words with a kiss.\n\n\nAs Cristian headed to the shower, Layla told him she'd meet him there, but stopped short when she discovered something sticking out of his bag: the old note Cristian had written to Jessica during their high school days.  When Cris returned to the living room, Layla questioned him about the note, and he explained that Jessica had dug it up and given it to him in the hopes of taking him back into memories of their past.  \"Did she?\" Layla asked.  \"No,\" Cris insisted, but when Layla decided to throw the note out, Cris grew hesitant.  Layla wasn't buying his weak protestations, and told him she couldn't handle him holding onto old mementos while hanging around Jessica all the time.\n\n\n\"Fine,\" Cristian snapped, tearing up the note and tossing the scraps into the trash.  Upset, he stormed out of the apartment.  After he left, Layla retrieved the torn-up note from the trashcan and laid the scraps of paper on the kitchen counter, mystified.\n\n\nStill seething, Cristian headed over to the Buenos Dias in search of Carlotta, but found Jessica instead.  She asked if he wanted to share an ice cream with her, but Cristian decided to head home.  Jessica claimed her ride had ditched her, and Cris offered to give her a lift.  Thrilled, she followed him back out of the diner.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Roxy, Natalie, and Rex struggled to process Allison's shocking revelation.  Rex wanted to know who he was if he wasn't Mitch and Roxy's child, and Roxy said she didn't know; all Allison had told her was that Rex's biological parents had abandoned him at the hospital.  Natalie wondered if the story was just another elaborate hoax by Allison, and suggested a DNA test.  Rex agreed, and Roxy said they needed to be sure, but she suspected it would only confirm what she knew in her heart.  Sobbing, she said she'd suspected something all those years before, but her heart and mind had blocked it out, and kept her from realizing that her real child had died without her having the chance to say goodbye.\n\n\nTearful, Roxy said it was ironic that she'd kept what she'd thought was the truth hidden from Rex for years, only for it to turn out to be another lie.  The bright side, she figured, was that he wasn't the son of two lousy parents.  Natalie rushed to Roxy's defense, but Roxy insisted that she was a rotten mother unworthy of either child she'd raised.  Natalie said that she loved Roxy like her mother, blood or no blood, and she was sure Rex felt the same.  Their eyes turned to the shell-shocked Rex, and searched his face for a reaction.\n\n\nGetting his bearings, Rex told Roxy that he was confused, upset, and angry, but the truth didn't change how he felt about her; she was still his mother in all the ways that counted.  Overcome, Roxy embraced him and Natalie.  She told them she needed to leave and get some rest.  After she left, Natalie asked Rex to tell her the truth; she suspected that he wasn't really all right. Broken, Rex shook his head, and Natalie hugged him.\n\n\nAt Statesville Prison, Oliver gave Bo and Brody the good news: Sierra Rose was his daughter.  Bo congratulated Oliver, but told him that didn't change their plans for the assault team, and he was required to step back; no personal feelings could interfere with their strike.  Ignoring Oliver's protests, Bo, Brody, and the warden examined floor plans for the prison, and worked on a way to get into the infirmary.\n\n\nInside the infirmary, Allison told the horrified Schuyler that he was Mitch's son, which made Sierra Rose was Mitch's granddaughter. \"Be a good boy and don't murder your daddy!\" she said.  She demanded the antidote, but Schuyler refused, and said Mitch meant nothing to him.  Brandishing her pistol, Allison asked him how much Sierra meant to him, and said the Messenger had to live on.  Schuyler doubled down on his demand, and told her that if she didn't hand over both the gun and the baby, he'd drain the syringe containing the antidote, and leave Allison nothing to save Mitch.\n\n\n\"Okay!\" Allison cried, frightened. \"You win!\"  She handed over both Sierra and her weapon.  Watching from the gurney, the weakened Mitch was pleased.  \"I look forward to our reunion, son,\" he croaked.  \"Die,\" Schuyler spat, and flung the syringe across the room.\n\n\nHearing Allison's cries from the outside corridor, Bo told Brody that there was no time to find another way in; they had to take the infirmary in a frontal assault, immediately.\n\n\nAs Allison scrambled to reach under a medicine cabinet and recover the syringe, Schuyler opened the infirmary doors and walked out with Sierra.  While Bo, Brody, and the police rushed in, Allison strained to reach for the syringe, but Brody pulled her away.  Allison screamed and ranted, pleading with the authorities to save \"the Messenger\" before it was too late.\n\n\nAs the paramedics began their examination, Allison told them that the contents of the syringe were the only thing that could save Mitch's life.  Much to her relief, Brody recovered the syringe from under the cabinet, and Allison begged him to administer it to Mitch.  \"I don't think I can,\" Brody said, staring at the syringe.\n\n\nIn the outside corridor, Oliver watched helplessly as Schuyler held Sierra and comforted her, promising her that \"Daddy\" would take care of her.  Schuyler vowed never to let anyone take her from him again.  As Schuyler prepared to leave, Oliver stopped him, and claimed Schuyler was needed for more questioning.  Schuyler protested, and said nothing would keep him from leaving with his daughter.  \"She's not your daughter!\" Oliver cried.\n\n\nAt Llanview University, Langston arrived at Ford's office, but rebuffed his seduction attempts.  She had another reason for visiting: Starr knew the truth about them.  Ford was upset, but calmed down when he learned that Langston had managed to keep Starr quiet.  \"Then everything's good,\" he concluded.\n\n\nLangston disagreed; everything was out of control.  She was cheating on Markko, more people knew the truth, and Hannah was talking about them all over town.  She asked Ford if he'd slept with Hannah, and he admitted they'd had a fling, but said he'd given Hannah up for a shot at true love with Langston.  Langston was surprised by his casual attitude to sex, but he reminded her she was sleeping with Markko as well as him.  Langston asked if that bothered him, and suggested that she could break up with Markko.\n\n\nSearching for any sign of commitment, Langston asked Ford if she should break up with Markko, and told him that Starr had suggested she dump him instead.  Ford scoffed at Starr's complaints, and told Langston that her friend was young and immature, ill-equipped to understand adult love.\n\n\nJust then, Hannah arrived outside, knocking on the office door and demanding Ford speak to her.  Ford slipped into the hallway and confronted her, and ordered her to leave him alone and stop making up stories about him and Langston.  Langston listened in to Ford and Hannah's argument as Ford called his ex crazy and a stalker, while Hannah called him a manipulative user.  Hannah threatened to go to the dean, but Ford said it was her word against his, and the administration would side with him.  He told her she was a nice girl who deserved a nice guy, but it wouldn't be him, and she had to get over it.\n\n\nAfter Hannah left, Ford returned to the office, and Langston.  Langston was charmed that he'd stood up for her, while Ford feigned concern for Hannah's well-being.  He claimed he felt bad for the girl, but said Langston was the woman he really cared about.  He told Langston that she didn't need to be torn apart by divided loyalties, and suggested she stay with Markko for the time being, at least until she was finished with high school, as \"people would talk\" if word of their romance got out.\n\n\n\"Are you dumping me?\" Langston asked.  Ford assuaged her fears, and said they'd only stay away from each other until the end of the semester.  He promised to wait for her.  \"Trust me,\" he purred.\n\n\nBack at the Buenos Dias, Starr was still preoccupied by her knowledge of Langston's infidelity, and asked Cole if it was ever right to keep a secret.  Misreading her, Cole assumed she'd discovered he'd stayed with Hannah at the dorms overnight, and began to explain himself.  \"You lied?\" Starr asked, surprised.  Cole explained that he'd stayed with Hannah after she'd overdosed on sleeping pills, and said he'd only lied to protect her reputation.  Stunned, Starr concluded that Hannah needed help, but Cole said what she really needed was a good friend.\n\n\nHannah returned to the restaurant, but stopped in the doorway and watched as she saw Starr and Cole talking.  As Cole vented about Ford's abuse of Hannah's affections, Starr told him she understood why he'd kept her secret, and kissed him.  Devastated by the romantic scene, Hannah turned and left the Buenos Dias.\n\n\nInside, Cole continued beating himself up about his white lie; he was sure Starr wouldn't have kept a secret from him, even for a friend.  Consumed with guilt over Langston and Ford, Starr swallowed hard and turned to Cole.  \"I need to tell you something,\" she began. \n\n\n",
