    "soap_central": "\nHomecomings\n\n\nAt Capricorn, T\u00e9a greeted Cristian and tried to mend fences with him over the Vanessa debacle. T\u00e9a asked for a table for two, and assured Cristian it wasn't for her and Todd, but rather for her and her date, Ray Montez. Cris grudgingly agreed and accepted a hug from T\u00e9a, who called him a good guy. \"You really think so?\" Cristian asked, surprised. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora waged a phone war with contractors who were moving too slowly on retrofitting the house for Matthew's handicapped needs. Just as she seemed at her lowest, she received a surprise visitor: ex-husband Hank \"the Cannon\" Gannon. Hank had taken leave from his teaching position at Georgetown University to come to Bo, Nora, and Matthew's aid in their time of need. \n\n\nAs Hank and Nora got caught up, Nora found herself despairing. She told Hank that Matthew's rehabilitation was different from their daughter Rachel's recovery from drug addiction; there was no certain \"light at the end of the tunnel.\" Hank comforted Nora with a hug. \n\n\nNora mused to Hank about her reasons for letting Cole off the hook at his arraignment. She said that despite her anger, Cole had been like a son to her, and a brother to Matthew. More importantly, she said she had looked at him and seen Rachel, and her own struggle with drugs, and how she'd prayed for someone to help her child, not hurt her. Hank told Nora she'd done the right thing. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, Clint forced a harried Bo to sit down and take a breather. Clint encouraged his brother to unload his worries, but Bo was too anxious, and feared that he would be unable to do everything Matthew needed from him. Clint told Bo to lean on him and the rest of the family for support. \n\n\nBo reminisced about his fellow veterans in Vietnam, and how some had also come back from the war crippled. Before, he'd been unable to fully relate to their suffering, but, because of Matthew, he'd been forced to come to terms. He feared that Matthew would end up angry and bitter like the veterans he'd seen, but Clint told him all he needed to do was continue supporting Matthew, and drawing love and strength from his family. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian fended off a rambunctious Jack and was thrilled when \"Stepdad\" John returned home to look after the boy. When Ray prepared to leave for his date with T\u00e9a, however, Dorian turned green. \n\n\nAs Ray flirted shamelessly with \"Mrs. Buchanan,\" Dorian gave as good as she got, and got in a few jabs at T\u00e9a's expense. The heat was obvious between the two, but neither would give in. Ray told Dorian that T\u00e9a was what he wanted in a woman: bright, beautiful, passionate. \"Enjoy your evening with your nephew,\" he jibed. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, John tried to make inroads with Jack, who wasn't having any of it. Jack said Todd had warned him about John-that he spent all his money on beer and black clothes, that he only came out at night, \"that you spend an hour a day on your hair.\" John rightly asked why his hair looked the way it did if he spent so much time on it. \n\n\nJohn told Jack that he had to be there to protect Jack and the family like he'd promised Blair, but Jack was sure that Todd could do all of that instead. Jack remembered his parents' empty promises of happy families, and declared that \"promises suck!\" \"I agree,\" John mumbled to himself. \n\n\nBack at the Buchanan mansion, Bo and Clint returned home, and Bo and Hank shared a joyful reunion. Clint tried to comfort an emotional Nora, but Nora busied herself with making guest arrangements for Hank. As Clint followed Nora into the foyer, Hank turned to Bo. \"Nora and Clint?\" he asked his friend, skeptical. \"Don't even go there,\" Bo replied. \n\n\nIn the foyer, Clint stopped Nora before she could dive into her frenzied litany of chores. He asked her what he was doing wrong, and why she wouldn't let him help, or lean on him for emotional support like she leaned on Bo and Hank. Nora said she wanted to go to him but she had a lot of responsibilities, and some things had to fall by the wayside. \"Like me?\" Clint asked. \n\n\nNora was at a loss for words. Just then, Hank and Bo entered the foyer, and Bo asked Nora if she wanted to accompany them on a tour of the grounds. Clint told Nora she'd already answered his question, and stalked away. \n\n\nAt Serenity Springs Spa, Llanview wise guy Jackie McNaughton joined Todd in the sauna. Todd had a business proposition for Jackie: give John McBain a \"dirt nap.\" Jackie was scandalized by Todd's request, and said offing John, a former federal agent and ex-cop, was above his pay grade. Todd reminded Jackie that he owed Todd after ratting Todd out during the Margaret Cochran murder investigation, but Jackie stood firm and told Todd to find someone else. \n\n\nIn the Serenity Springs gym, Talia and Layla worked out and commiserated; Talia lamented Antonio's out-of-town assignment, while Layla raged a mile a minute about her nemesis, the one and only Cristian. Layla blamed Cris for ruining her Internet date with \"Fab Booty,\" but Talia didn't think the date's assumption that there was something between Cris and Layla was that far-fetched. \n\n\nLayla rejected Talia's hypothesis, and said Cristian made her feel bad for things that weren't her fault, including Fish's broken heart. She claimed she hadn't wanted Fish, anyway, which was Officer Fish's cue to pop up right beside the ladies. After Fish gave his regards, Layla prepared to launch into another attack on Cristian, just in time for Cris to arrive on the scene. Cris and Layla traded barbs, everything from \"two-faced\" to \"ice queen.\" Cris told Layla it wasn't his fault her blind date had seen her for who she truly was, and as he left for the sauna, Layla was right on his tail. \n\n\nAt the nearby punching bag, Fish found that he had an unwitting sparring partner: hospital technician Kyle Lewis, his former classmate from Llanview University. Fish and Lewis compared notes, but there was an obvious edge to their interplay. Just then, Fish got a call from John, who asked him to come to La Boulaie, leaving Kyle alone to hammer away at the heavy bag. \n\n\nCristian reclined in the men's sauna, only to be confronted by Layla, who immediately began to taunt Cristian about his physique and his \"chicken legs.\" Cristian attempted to escape, only to find that the door was stuck, leaving them trapped in the sauna. \n\n\nAt Capricorn, Ray arrived for his date with T\u00e9a, and complimented her evening attire while casting aspersions on her motives. He asked T\u00e9a whether she was really there for him, or to play games with someone else. As Ray spoke, T\u00e9a glimpsed Todd entering the club, hot on the heels of Jackie McNaughton. When Todd accosted her and learned Ray was her date, he had two words of advice for Mr. Montez: \"Run away.\" Once Todd was gone, Ray asked T\u00e9a why she had asked him out: to get over Todd, or make him jealous? \n\n\nAt the bar, Todd again nagged Jackie to take his contract, but Jackie refused, and warned Todd to stop stalking him across town. As Jackie walked away, Todd got a call from Jack, who told him that \"John McPain\" had said everything Todd had warned him about. Todd promised Jack that he'd take the boy away from McBain, but Jack said his father was full of crap. He ordered Todd to find help, and become their father again, while Todd cast an eye to T\u00e9a. \n\n\nBack at Ray and T\u00e9a's table, Ray assured T\u00e9a that whatever her motives, he wanted them to have a good time, and as he took her hand, he suggested they give Todd a show. Just then, Dorian flounced in, interrupting the couple. Dorian claimed to be looking after Capricorn in Blair's stead, and was dismayed to see Todd on the premises. \n\n\nAfter an awkward attempt to seat herself with Ray and T\u00e9a for some idle conversation, Dorian finally gave up and headed for Todd. Confused, T\u00e9a asked which of them was trying to make someone jealous. Ray told her that he and Dorian were playing a game, and T\u00e9a warned him that Dorian played for keeps. \n\n\nAs Dorian muttered insults towards Ray at the bar, Jackie sidled up to her, and asked if she was looking to plan another hit. Seizing the moment, Dorian said all she wanted from him was a kiss. Jackie happily obliged, while Ray seethed in the distance. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, John ushered Fish into the drawing room to review the evidence in his unofficial murder investigation. Fish was leery of working with a \"civilian\" on a police matter, but John prevailed upon him for his aid. As John reviewed the evidence and motives linking Todd to the crimes, Fish asked if John thought Todd Manning had turned into a serial killer. John told Fish that the killer had left a message on his victims: the letters \"K,\" \"A\" and \"D,\" standing for Todd's college fraternity, Kappa Alpha Delta. Disturbed, Fish told John that he had also been a member of KAD. \n\n\nAt Serenity Springs, Kyle stepped on the treadmill and unzipped his jersey, revealing his own KAD t-shirt. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Fish told John that the KAD fraternity had been disbanded after the gang rape, then reinstated on a probationary basis years later. John said that they had to look into Fish's other frat brothers as possible suspects; he said they couldn't get enough evidence against Todd yet, and had to watch him. Fish asked about other suspects, like Marty, and reminded John that she also had a connection to the fraternity. John offered up two other suspects: Powell Lord and Zach Rosen, Marty's other rapists. John explained that Zach had served his time, and was back on the street. \n\n\nAt Capricorn, a mysterious man took a seat at the bar, glancing at Todd nearby. As the man turned back to the bar, he was revealed to be Zach Rosen. \n\n\n",
