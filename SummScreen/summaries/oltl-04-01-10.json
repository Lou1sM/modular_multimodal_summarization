David figured that if he had been able to find it, then anyone else would, too, and he wanted her gone from Clint's life. Kim insisted she wasn't the same person any longer and she ripped the file up. \"It'll kill Clint,\" she said. David assured her that he had made copies and he wanted her to leave. \"I can't leave Clint,\" Kim pleaded. David made it clear that he was protecting his family and there was room for only one \"gold digger\" and that was him.\n\n\nKim attempted to make David an offer, and she suggested that Vickers move into the mansion. He refused and told her she had to disappear. Kim knew that Clint was a good person who didn't deserve the fallout from her past. David wanted her to leave before Clint's heart was broken and said he had already ordered Kim a car. Kim stated that she had already broken Clint's heart. She picked up a photo and muttered, \"So long, cowboy. Thanks.\" David assured her she was doing the right thing and promised to visit her at her pole in Vegas. As Kim headed out the door, Clint was on his way inside.\n\n\nElijah was set to have a romantic dinner with Blair at La Boulaie, but Dorian interrupted when she found them outside on the patio. An apologetic and embarrassed Blair assured Elijah that she thought Dorian had other plans, as her aunt wanted to understand what Elijah's intentions were. Blair quickly spoke up that the intention was to have dinner, but Dorian all too knowingly pointed out that it merely started with dinner. She reminded the couple that Elijah's brother had held her niece at gunpoint.\n\n\nBlair called attention to the fact that Dorian had promised not to meddle anymore and mentioned that at least Elijah's last name wasn't Manning. Dorian was determined to pursue the couple's relationship, but the doorbell rang and Blair urged her aunt to answer it, as Blair had given the household help the evening off. Dorian vowed to keep her eye on Elijah and ordered him not to hurt Blair. Dorian hurried to the door as someone knocked non-stop from the other side.\n\n\nBlair apologized for her aunt's behavior and explained that Dorian was protective. Elijah understood and suggested that they have dinner out if Blair would feel better. Blair wanted to stay put and warned Elijah that Dorian was part of the package. Elijah wondered how Dorian acted around her own daughters. Blair made a face and promised that things would be different if they moved forward. Elijah assured her he would be able to handle Dorian. Blair asked if he felt the same about her kids, who were her \"heart and soul.\" She declared that her kids needed her and she needed them. \"I would expect nothing less,\" Elijah responded. Blair reminded him that she had lots of baggage, including a crazy ex-husband.\n\n\nElijah recollected that he had arrived in Llanview for family, though it had not turned out so well. He would be able to handle hers and he looked forward to meeting them all. Blair laughed and instructed him not to ever play cards with Jack because her son cheated. The air grew chilly and the outdoor heater wasn't helping much. Elijah grabbed a blanket from indoors and wrapped it around Blair and himself.\n\n\nDorian answered the door and found Markko, who was looking for Langston. Dorian assured him that Langston was not there, but Markko pushed his way inside and refused to take Dorian's word for it. After it was determined that Langston was not there, Dorian worried that her daughter was missing and Mitch might be behind it. Markko thought maybe he had confused the details and, as Dorian frantically searched for her phone to call the police, Markko called Langston. Cole answered Langston's phone and assured his buddy that he and Langston were at the diner.\n\n\nMarkko was sorry for alarming Dorian, who wanted to know if Markko and Langston were having problems. Markko firmly told her that he and Langston had been busy with conflicting schedules, but he loved Langston and they would be sticking together. Dorian admitted that she had been hard on Markko but she knew that he made Langston happy and she wanted them to stay together. After Markko left, Dorian started out to the patio but smiled in spite of herself when she spotted Blair and Elijah wrapped up together and kissing. The couple pulled apart quickly.\n\n\nAs Kelly and Todd waited in the secured room at Statesville, they wondered what was happening in the infirmary. Todd only hoped that Mitch died a \"slow, painful death.\" The pair attempted to leave their guarded room but they were stopped at the door. The guard advised them that Allison and a baby were in the infirmary with the others. Todd explained that Allison was Mitch's \"zombie\" and did Mitch's bidding. Kelly assumed that Allison was involved in Melinda's death and she vowed to look Allison in the eye for details.\n\n\nTodd described Allison's mental state in several ways, among them the fact that she was a \"cup and a saucer short.\" He didn't think Allison would be able to tell Kelly anything, but Kelly was confident that she would be able to look at Allison and just recognize what she needed to. She couldn't ignore the fact that she had received two phone calls from someone who had sounded scared and told her that her mother was murdered.\n\n\nTodd thought that they had made things worse for Kelly by showing up at the prison, and he didn't know if Kelly would be able to speak to Allison. Kelly wondered why he had bothered to go with her if he was so pessimistic. He was trying to help her, he admitted, but her mother was history and she should let it go. Kelly questioned whether Todd would feel the same if it were someone he loved who had been murdered. Kelly continued to press Todd for his answer, even while he protested that it wasn't about him. Todd was all about revenge, Kelly prompted. This was about murder, and she wasn't about to let it go.\n\n\nIn the infirmary, Brody held onto the antidote and refused to inject Mitch with it. Brody was of the opinion that Mitch's life was hardly worth saving after all of the evil he had perpetrated. As Bo attempted to persuade Brody to do the right thing and not ruin his own life, Allison screamed continuously at the top of her lungs and pleaded for someone to save the messenger. Bo remained calm and spoke quietly to Brody. He insisted that Brody wasn't a killer. Finally relenting, Brody stabbed the needle, which held the antidote, into Mitch.\n\n\nMitch opened his eyes almost instantly as Allison shouted her thanks. Mitch demanded that \"Judas\" be kept away from him. She had lied about his son. An hysterical Allison begged for forgiveness, but Mitch demanded that she be taken out of his sight. The remaining cops wondered what had happened to Allison's gun, and they began to search for it without success.\n\n\nOut in the hallway, Oliver broke the news to Schuyler that Oliver was Sierra's father. Schuyler refused to believe him and revealed that he'd already had a bad day and found out that his parents were not the ones he'd known his entire life. He was not in the mood for games. Oliver remorsefully explained that he was trying to fix a mistake and Schuyler had to understand that Oliver was Sierra's father. Oliver had slept with Stacy and he had the DNA results to prove it.\n\n\nSchuyler recalled that he didn't remember sleeping with Stacy himself and had only heard it from Kim and Stacy when he found them putting the padding around Stacy's stomach. Oliver held out the test results to an angry Schuyler. A tear ran down Schuyler's face as he looked at the report. He called himself an idiot as he realized how much this entire episode had cost him because he thought Sierra was his. He had done some terrible things. Oliver gently assured him that Oliver and the baby were not going anywhere and perhaps they could arrange visitation time with Schuyler. Oliver asked Schuyler to give him the baby. Schuyler kissed Sierra and handed her to Oliver, who praised Schuyler for taking good care of the infant and saving her life.\n\n\nSchuyler tucked Allison's gun into his pants when a guard arrived and asked him to give a statement. Allison was led from the infirmary and screamed in protest when she saw that the baby was with Oliver. Todd and Kelly finally emerged from their guarded room and found themselves in Allison's path. She gloated at Kelly as they looked into each other's eyes. Oliver bonded with Sierra. Bo continued to search for the gun and asked Mitch if he had seen it. Mitch reminded Bo that he had been out of it but if he had the gun, he would have made a martyr out of Allison. Bo smirked at Mitch and declared his profound happiness that Rex was not Mitch's son. Suddenly, he sucker-punched Mitch and knocked him out. \"My bad,\" the police commissioner murmured.\n\n\nNatalie comforted Rex at his place and soothingly told him he was still her brother, even if they weren't blood-related. Besides, they'd already known they weren't blood-related and he was still the same guy he'd always been. Rex felt otherwise and indicated that nothing was the same. Natalie thought he should talk to Gigi, who bounded through the door in that instant and proclaimed that she had heard the news. Natalie and Rex were speechless until Gigi anxiously told them that there was a baby at the prison and it had to be Sierra.\n\n\nNatalie divulged that she had seen Sierra at Foxy Roxy's, and the baby had been okay. Gigi, on the verge of hysterics, wanted to go to the prison but Rex assured her that Statesville was probably locked down. He was positive that the baby would be protected as long as Bo was present. Natalie told Gigi that there was something else Gigi needed to be aware of, but Rex tried to stop her. He said he was fine, but Natalie disagreed. Rex surrendered and gave Gigi the good news first. He announced that Mitch wasn't his father, and Shane would not need to send the man a card on Grandparents' Day. His bad news was that there would be no need for a card for Roxy, either, as she wasn't his mother. He didn't know who he was.\n\n\nNatalie and Rex gave Gigi all of the details and Rex agreed that while he would get a DNA test, he believed it all to be true. Gigi assured him that it didn't change the \"important stuff,\" but Rex didn't want to talk about it any longer. Gigi asked how Mitch Lawrence's stem cells had saved Shane if he wasn't related. The trio was perplexed. Rex offered to walk Natalie to her car, and Gigi attempted to find out about Sierra over the telephone. When she heard someone walk in, she assumed it was Rex and turned around towards him. She was shocked to see Schuyler, who hid Allison's gun behind his back.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, Starr was about to reveal her secret to Cole about Langston when Langston herself interrupted them. Langston demanded to know what Starr was doing. Starr firmly told her that she and Cole were talking, but Langston wasn't about to be put off and she requested that Starr step aside and talk to her privately. The girls headed into the kitchen.\n\n\nStarr accused Langston of making things awkward. She explained that Cole had confessed a secret to her and she felt obligated to do the same thing. An angry Langston reminded Starr that they were best friends and Starr had promised not to tell Cole what Langston had been up to. Langston pointed out that they hadn't even known Hannah for very long and Starr's loyalty was to Langston first. Starr thought that Langston might be okay with lying to Markko, but Starr was not going to lie to Cole.\n\n\nStarr was sure that Cole would be quiet about what he heard, but Langston didn't agree. She wanted to tell Markko about her affair herself, but it just wasn't the best time. Langston confessed that she had heard about Hannah from Ford when she went to see him. Starr was annoyed, since Langston was supposed to be with Markko, and Starr expressed her opinion that Ford was a \"creep\" and Langston should break things off with him. Langston adamantly refused and admitted that she believed Ford's story. Hannah was a stalker. Starr disagreed and she acknowledged that she could no longer be a part of Langston's lies.\n\n\nLangston apologized for putting Starr in the middle, but she didn't want to discuss her situation any longer. Starr protested that she merely wanted Langston to see what her new boyfriend was like. Langston assured Starr that she would keep a secret for Starr in the same situation, but Starr noted that she would never cheat on Cole. Sarcastically, Langston uttered that Starr and Cole were perfect. At that point, Cole walked into the kitchen to look for the girls, who had begun to raise their voices. He asked if the girls were fighting.\n\n\nLangston assured him that they had argued over the musical, and Starr added that there was a problem with the Langston and Markko portion of it. Langston promised to fix it. Cole advised the girls that he had heard from Markko, who was looking for Langston. Once Langston walked back into the dining area, Cole asked Starr what the disagreement had really been about. It had been too intense to merely be about the musical, he told her. Markko arrived and wanted to know why Langston had lied to him about her whereabouts.\n\n\n",
