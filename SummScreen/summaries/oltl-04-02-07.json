The late doctor gave Miles a pep talk about going after Marty, adding that Marty's rejection was only \"a minor setback.\" Spencer reminded him that he had encouraged Miles to lead an \"extraordinary life.\" Miles thanked Spencer for \"everything you've done for me\" but wasn't sure he wanted to get involved with something that had anything to do with Todd. Spencer asked Miles to read the letter he'd left for Todd and vanished.\n\n\nNash and Jessica ran into each other yet again. They squabbled. Nash made it clear he didn't think Jessica adopting Jamie was such a good idea. Jessica said her only mistake was letting herself feel anything for Nash.\n\n\nAntonio and Talia discovered the arsonist was involved with a white supremacist group. Antonio asked her if she'd been the victim of a hate crime. \"My family has had some problems, yeah,\" she said, \"especially after 9/11.\" Antonio looked out the window and saw Nash and Jessica in a rather heated discussion. Jessica arrived home, and Talia left.\n\n\nAntonio asked about Nash, saying he had seen Nash and Jessica outside. Jessica explained that Nash was upset about the news about Jamie's adoption. Jessica tried to explain things as best she could, but she wasn't making much sense because she had to lie. \"He makes problems where there are none,\" she said, clearly flustered. Antonio went to bed. Jessica looked out the window and saw Nash sitting there.\n\n\nAt the police station, Starr said she'd avoid Cole if Todd promised to leave him alone and Marty wouldn't send him to military school. Todd didn't think that would work. Starr told Cole that he'd have to lose her, or others would be hurt. Marty thought Starr was doing the right thing. Todd wasn't sure he could trust Starr. \"Look into my eyes,\" Starr begged her dad.\n\n\nCole agreed to go along with Starr's suggestion but wasn't happy about it. Todd told his daughter he was proud of her. \"Someone has to be grown-up around here,\" she growled. Cole wanted a moment alone with Starr to say goodbye. Once alone, Cole told Starr \"that was genius,\" but Starr reiterated it was really goodbye.\n\n\nStarr said she was doing it for Cole, \"for me,\" for Langston, for Jack. \"Anything else is impossible,\" she said. Starr said they couldn't even text each other; their relationship was over. Starr and Cole kissed goodbye. Todd and Marty went back into the squad room and took their respective kids home.\n\n\nJohn found a teary Natalie by the docks. John yelled at her for giving Todd the heads-up about Starr and Cole. \"Getting married is not going to solve any of our problems,\" he yelled. \"Is this relationship dead in the water?\" Natalie countered. John said he didn't like the fact that Natalie always seemed to know what was best for him and, worse, acted on it.\n\n\nBoth John and Natalie agreed that though they loved each other, \"that isn't enough,\" sobbed Natalie. \"Maybe we're too much alike,\" she added. John said they had been friends before. \"My best friend,\" Natalie wept. Natalie went home, packed her bags, and started to leave, but John stopped her, and they began to have breakup sex.\n\n\n\n\n",
