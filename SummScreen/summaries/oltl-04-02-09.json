A sweating Layla began to remove her clothing, pointing out that it was dangerous to stay in the room for more than 15 minutes. Cristian suggested that she stop being melodramatic. She accused him of looking at her ass when she was down to her undergarments. \n\n\nCristian turned his head, trying not to laugh, as the arguing began anew. Layla was certain that he was staring at her body. He agreed that maybe he was looking, and they bickered over her appearance. Finally, he complimented her body and, while she didn't buy it at first, it was obvious that she was flattered. She conceded that Cristian actually had a nice body, too, and not the chicken legs that she had pointed out earlier. \n\n\nLayla felt certain that in light of her most recent experiences with dating, she was meant to be alone. Cristian told her that there was someone out there for everyone. When Layla asked if he meant even for a bitch like her, the squabble began again. Cristian assured her she wouldn't have to settle. Suddenly, the door opened and an attendant advised them that the steam room wasn't co-ed. \n\n\nMarty paid a visit to Jessica at Llanfair, eager to tell her about following her advice to talk to John. She was about to tell him about exploring her feelings for him when she learned that he had married Blair, she told a shocked Jessica, who had her own unfortunate news. Marty was astonished when Jessica confided that she had followed her own advice, but found the man she was interested in \"doing his ex.\" \n\n\n\nThe women agreed that John's marriage to Blair was merely one of convenience, but Marty insisted that she would no longer be able to pursue him. Jessica thought that she and Brody had really bonded, so she was staggered to walk into his sleeping with someone else's girl. She reenacted her encounter with Brody, Rex, and Gigi. Deciding that they really needed drinks, but not able to have them with their health issues, the women settled for some Earl Grey tea. \n\n\nAs they commiserated over their \"tea shots\" Marty told Jessica that she was probably better off without John. She felt that she would be better able to focus on Cole, something that she should have done previously. Feeling funny about saying it, but truthful nonetheless, Jessica admitted that she liked John for stepping up to help Blair. Marty agreed that she did, too. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, John and Fish continued to study pictures of Zach Rosen and Powell Lord. Suddenly, Fish noticed John's wedding band and was taken by surprise to hear that John had married Blair. He quickly extended his congratulations, but John was eager to get back to the case. \n\n\nJohn explained that Powell had attacked other women after Marty's rape and was confined to a psychiatric hospital. While Zach had been out of prison for just a few months, he had many reasons to hold a grudge against Todd, the men felt. Citing Todd's getting a pardon for the same crime that Zach was imprisoned for, Todd's money and marriages, and then being holed up with Marty herself, who had no memory of her rape, would certainly cause Zach to want revenge. \n\n\nFish and John concluded their discussion regarding their unofficial murder investigation, but John noticed that Fish was acting oddly. Fish mentioned his running into his old frat buddy from KAD and how it felt to stay in the house where the atrocity involving Marty had occurred. \n\n\nAt Capricorn, Jackie McNaughton kissed Dorian passionately in front of Ray. Dorian quickly apologized to Ray, who asked about her husband and whether the kiss was for his benefit. Dorian played dumb and accused Jackie of kissing her, and told him he was out of line. Calling her nuts, Jackie stalked off as Ray began to laugh. \n\n\nDorian insisted that she hadn't followed Ray to the club, but was checking on things for her niece, who owned the place. Ray reminded her that she had known he'd be there, but he had made the date with T\u00e9a when Dorian had turned him down. He felt that they shared a moment back at La Boulaie, but he wouldn't pursue her if she loved her husband. He needed her to figure it out and let him know. \n\n\nTodd decided on a plan to retrieve custody of his kids, and sauntered over to T\u00e9a's table. Telling T\u00e9a that he wanted her, he added that he would not allow John to raise his kids. Zach Rosen sat nearby, watching Todd closely. \n\n\nComing on to her, Todd blamed T\u00e9a for what happened, but confided that he wanted her all at the same time. Calling him \"schizo,\" T\u00e9a refused to play into Todd's hands. He insisted that neither of them were normal, but she could have him; he knew that she wanted him and he felt the same. He added that it would cost her. \n\n\nHe also accused her of playing the \"woman scorned\" but he figured he might as well take her. Disdainfully, T\u00e9a told Todd he was a real Don Juan. Again, he said that she could have him, but she'd have to go to the judge and call Blair's marriage a sham. \n\n\nTodd smugly disclosed that Blair and Marty didn't want him, but he knew that T\u00e9a did. A sarcastic T\u00e9a wondered how she could resist his seductive ways. As Todd assured her that things were in her hands, Ray interrupted them. \n\n\nZach Rosen requested that his drinking bill be added to Todd's tab. Jackie realized that while Dorian was trying to make Ray jealous, he was the very same man that she had requested Jackie kill in the past. T\u00e9a finally managed to get Todd to leave Ray and her alone. As Todd prepared to leave the bar, he was stopped and told that he needed to pay for his friend's bar bill. Pointing out that he had no friends, Todd looked towards the bar, but Zach was gone. \n\n\n\n\nAt the hospital, Gigi gently tapped on a sleeping Rex, telling him she needed to talk about Brody. She acknowledged that she never meant to hurt Rex, but that she did it for Shane. She didn't want Shane caught in the crossfire, she explained. A totally confused Rex didn't understand at all, reminding her that things had been fine between them. Gigi disagreed, stating that things had gone on long enough. \n\n\nA saddened Rex understood how much pain Gigi was in and assured her that things could be fixed. Crying, Gigi told him, \"This is killing me.\" She told him it was over between them. Pleading with her, Rex refused to listen, stating that they loved each other and that they couldn't break up. She felt that she couldn't trust him, that he would cheat as he had when he was with Adriana, and almost did with Stacy. \n\n\nHe was either drugged, or drunk and stupid, and couldn't remember what had happened, Rex insisted. He wanted her, didn't care if she had been with Brody, and felt that they could get through it. He wanted her to stay with him. \n\n\nRex asked Gigi to marry him, reminding her that they loved each other and that it would help Shane get well. Crying, Gigi kept repeating that she was sorry, even as Rex repeated that he didn't believe what she was saying. He thought that they were forever, and their meeting up again proved that, he stressed. She no longer trusted him was her response. Pulling her into a kiss, Rex insisted that she and Shane were his life and his world. Gigi returned the kiss but suddenly pulled away. \n\n\nBrody encountered Stacy at the Angel Square Hotel and began to insult her, not mincing words. Stacy gave it back to him, accusing him of sleeping with Gigi. Clarifying that it was all an act, he said that not everyone was a stripper or a slut. He declared that Stacy had no understanding of love. Yelling at her to grow up, Brody refused to listen to Stacy's claims of loving Rex since high school. \n\n\nStacy maintained that she wouldn't be a donor for Shane if Gigi didn't keep her end of the bargain. Brody threatened that maybe Stacy could get stabbed and die, with a serial killer running around. Calling her a monster and not having feelings, he stated that she was also obsessed and delusional, and that she couldn't make Rex love her. He understood, on a certain level, how she felt, since he had loved Gigi and he had been obsessed. He had given it up, though. He urged her to do the same. \n\n\nShe would never win over Gigi, Brody told her. He couldn't believe that she would risk Shane's life, and he firmly believed that she would never have Rex. He accused her of wrecking a family, and contended that she would have to get over it the same as he had to get over losing Gigi. He wondered how she could even live with herself, and maintained that she couldn't have it all, even as she insisted that Gigi would be the one to give up. \n\n\nAs Rachael Yamageta entertained the crowd at Capricorn with her song, \"Elephants,\" residents of Llanview were deep in thought. Dorian and Todd watched Ray and T\u00e9a from opposite ends of the club. \n\n\nReturning to the hospital, Stacy learned that Gigi and Rex had broken up. She had good news for Rex, though, revealing that she was a match and would be able to save Shane's life.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While in another argument, Cristian and Layla end up locked together in the steam room. By the time they get unlocked, they discover they may like each other more than either is willing to admit. Gigi knows she must make Rex believe that she distrusts him, that she thinks he willingly slept with Stacy and that she willingly slept with Brody. But he does not buy that. Stacy tells Gigi that she will save Shane's life under the condition that Gigi does what she wants. Brody confronts Stacy and tells her she's delusional to think that she can \"have\" Rex given these circumstances and she's despicable to endanger a young boy in order to do it. Dorian is at Capricorn, using Jack McNaughton to make Ray jealous while he's making her jealous by being with Tea. Todd tells Tea that she can \"have\" him if she agrees to withdraw from representing Blair and helping her marry John. She does not buy that. Jessica and Marty talk about both of their failed attempts with their respective men. Marty concludes she better leave John alone if he's now married to Blair. Jessica realizes she better back off from Brody if he's back with Gigi although she doesn't understand how that would be since she knows that Gigi is committed to Rex. John and Officer Fish discover that some of the guys who got sent to prison for helping Todd rape Marty many years ago are now free. They have motive to want to get revenge upon Todd and set him up for crimes such as murdering Lee Halpern, murdering Wes Granger and stabbing Blair.",
