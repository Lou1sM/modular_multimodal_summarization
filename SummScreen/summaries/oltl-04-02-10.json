After Starr remembered about promising Langston not to tell Cole about Langston's relationship with Ford, Starr informed Cole that \"it's not just a play, you know, it's about real people.\"  When Cole wondered why Starr was so upset, she said that Langston had made bad choices that would mess up the rest of Langston's life and that Starr did not know what to do about it.  Cole advised Starr to wait it out because Langston one day would need her best friend.\n\n\nIn another part of the caf\u00e9, Langston insisted to Markko that she did not lie.  But Markko reminded Langston that she had said that she was going to Dorian's.  Yet Dorian had claimed that she had not seen Langston all day, stressed Markko.  Insulted, Langston remarked that Markko did not even want to consider that maybe Dorian was not home when Langston had arrived.  Langston exclaimed that Markko just wanted to \"put the worst possible spin\" on the situation to make her seem guilty.  \n\n\nLangston informed Markko that he was just treating her like a criminal; Markko responded that Langston had been treating like him like a stranger.  Markko maintained that Langston and Markko were constantly missing each other throughout the day.  Langston explained that it was because she would just lose all track of time.  Markko asserted that Langston had mentioned sheet music before and then he requested to see the sheet music.  Langston announced that Starr had it just as Starr and Cole walked up to them.\n\n\nLangston asked Starr to show Markko the sheet music, which Starr retrieved out of her bag.  As Markko apologized, Langston stated that she was leaving and that she hoped that Marko didn't hire someone to follow her.  Langston left and Starr followed.\n\n\nOutside the caf\u00e9, Starr warned that Langston could keep lying to Markko all she wanted but that Langston had to quit asking Starr to lie for her.  Langston reminded Starr that Starr had promised not so say anything to anybody, even Cole. Starr replied that she had always kept her promises.\n\n\nInside the caf\u00e9, Markko stated that he knew that something else was going on with Langston and requested that Cole ask Starr about it.  Outside, Starr called Ford and declared that she needed to see him.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Clint caught Kim as she was preparing to leave.  Unnoticed by Clint, David scurried out of the room with an apple in his mouth.  As David listened behind the living room door, Clint asked Kim if she were going somewhere.  Kim exclaimed that she was leaving him and David silently said, \"Atta, girl.\"\n\n\nClint appealed to her by asking what he had done and Kim offered that it was nothing that he had done but more of what she had done.  When Clint insisted on knowing, Kim proclaimed that she just wanted a clean break.  As Clint escorted her back to the living room and as David hid behind the sofa, Clint replied, \"What is best for both of us is for us to put all of our cards on the table because this is just crazy and I deserve an explanation.\"  Kim claimed that she had done something bad and that Clint would never forgive her.  When Clint refused to let Kim leave, David held up the document from behind the sofa to remind Kim that she had to go.\n\n\nKim pleaded that Clint had to let her go because she and Stacy had kept a child from her father.  Kim further explained that she and Stacy had kept Sierra Rose from Oliver Fish while knowing that he was Sierra's biological father.  Clint informed Kim that the information about Fish would take away any chance for custody of Sierra Rose.  Kim remarked that Sierra Rose was the reason for Kim and Clint to be together, so their marriage was over.  Clint replied, \"It doesn't have to be\" while, from behind the sofa still, David mouthed, \"What?\"\n\n\nClint reflected that he was sure that there were reasons for Kim and Stacy to do what they did, but that was over, Stacy was gone, and Kim would never be put in that position again.  Clint continued that since none of it was about them, he urged Kim to give their marriage another chance.  When David frantically waved the document from behind the sofa, Kim informed Clint that she had cheated on Clint with a man from her past.  Clint pointed out that since he and Kim had agreed that infidelity was something that he would not tolerate, Kim sadly kissed him and cried, \"I'll never forget you, Clint Buchanan.\"  Clint stated that he would take a shower and by the time he went into the living room for his brandy, he hoped that Kim would be gone.\n\n\nAfter Clint left the room, David popped out from behind the sofa and told Kim that, for a minute, she had him worried.  Kim vented that all David cared about was the money.  Then Kim exclaimed that she would win her husband back and that once that happened, she would destroy David.  As soon as Kim left, David closed the doors to Buchanan Mansion.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Apartments, Roxy exited the linen closet door with a handful of towels. Natalie found her and asked Roxy what she was doing.  Roxy emphasized that she did not want to lose her business since it was all she had left.  When Natalie hinted that Roxy might not lose as much as she thought, Roxy cried, \"What about my Rexy...see, I can't even say that anymore.  He's not mine and he never was.\"  But Natalie reminded Roxy that Roxy loved Rex like he was her son and that it was not true that Roxy had lost Rex.  \n\n\nRoxy insisted that Rex could only see lies when he looked at her.  But Natalie stated that Rex was trying to deal with what he had just found out and that he was not the only one hurting.  Natalie asked, \"What about you, Rox...finding out after all these years what really happened to your baby?\"  After Natalie commented that Roxy must have a million questions, Roxy handed Natalie the towels while asking her to deliver them to John's room, and, after declaring that she had something else to do, Roxy left.\n\n\nIn John's apartment, as he was informing the police department that he did not want to be disturbed \"unless something broke in Allison Perkins' case\" and that he intended on spending time with Marty at his home, Natalie knocked on John's door to deliver his towels.  When Natalie questioned why so many towels, John announced that Marty was moving in.  After Natalie congratulated him, John informed her that Marty was having complications with her pregnancy, but he also insisted that Marty was fine.\n\n\nJohn commented that he thought that Natalie was in London, but Natalie revealed that she had made it up to get rid of him.  Natalie exclaimed that Allison had a gun pointed at her so Natalie had no choice but to get rid of him.  After John asked why Natalie did not give some sort of signal, Natalie explained that Allison had said that she would kill the baby, Roxy, and John, so Natalie could not take that chance.  Natalie apologized to John for lying but also pointed out that \"sometimes it comes in handy.\"  Natalie related that \"being held at gunpoint was nothing compared to the little bombshell that Roxy dropped today.\"\n\n\nAfter Natalie informed John that Rex was not who he thought he was, she told John of how Allison had switched Roxy's baby for an abandoned baby, and said that Roxy had thought the abandoned child was hers all this time.  When John comforted Natalie, she cried that she needed to leave because \"I need to find a friend who does not have a pregnant, living girlfriend.\"\n\n\nAt Statesville Prison, as Kelly and Todd accompanied the guard who was escorting Allison, Kelly demanded that Allison tell her about her mom's death.  Kelly and Todd both claimed that Mitch had contacted Allison and had ordered Allison to kill Kelly's mom, Melinda.  As Allison yawned, Kelly demanded to know how her mother died and Allison told her to pull up a chair.\n\n\nWhen Kelly asked if Mitch had threatened her Aunt Dorian, Allison replied that Dorian had betrayed Mitch and was the cause of Mitch's daughter being shot.  When Kelly reminded Allison that Charlie was aiming at Mitch, not Jessica, Allison declared that was why Dorian needed to be punished.  Mitch had informed Allison that any Cramer woman would do, and Allison reflected upon hearing the potential candidates, \"I considered Starr first.  But I settled on Cassie.\"  But then Allison had heard that California was sunny, so she headed west - towards Melinda.  \n\n\nWhile Allison did not admit to actually killing Melinda, she admitted to going to Melinda's clinic.  \"It was all planned out.  I was going to sneak past security, find her room.  It was going to be a snap.\"  But Allison insisted that she got caught and that Kelly's mother was already dead when Allison found her.  When Kelly asked Allison about the phone calls from the man stating that Melinda was murdered, Allison emphasized,\" I can't help you there.\"\n\n\nRoxy then barged in to stop Allison from ever hurting anyone else again.  Kelly and Todd left.  Roxy begged Allison to tell her what happened to her baby and where he had been buried.  Allison looked confused and asked Roxy why he would have been buried.\n\n\nStill in the prison, Todd asked Kelly if she thought that Melinda had died of a heart attack as Allison had claimed.  But Kelly did not understand why she kept receiving phone calls from some man saying that her mother had been murdered.  However, Kelly informed Todd, if her mother had died from a heart attack, Kelly needed time alone and would find her own way home.  Kelly then thanked Todd and left.\n\n\nAfter Natalie left John's apartment, John was pulling out a key left by Natalie in an envelope when he heard knocking on his door.  It was Kelly urgently requesting John's help.\n\n\nAt Statesville Prison, Brody and Bo questioned where Allison's gun was, and observed that Schuyler had gone.  Brody told Bo that the guards were escorting Schuyler to the secure area but that they had never gotten there.  Rex called Bo and Bo informed him that Sierra Rose was rescued.  Rex asked when Gigi had been informed of her rescue, but Bo revealed that the news had not been released yet.  Knowing something was amiss, Bo yelled at Brody to find Schuyler Joplin.\n\n\nAt Rex's apartment, Schuyler surprised Gigi, who inquired if he was okay.  Schuyler informed Gigi that something had happened at Statesville Prison.  After Gigi asked Schuyler if Sierra Rose was well, Schuyler lied and remarked that Allison had escaped and that she had taken Sierra Rose with her.  However, Schuyler insisted, he knew where Allison and Sierra Rose were and said he needed Gigi to go with him.  When Gigi requested to call Rex first, Schuyler claimed that there was no time and that they had to leave immediately.\n\n\nWhen Rex arrived, Gigi was nowhere to be found.  Shortly after Rex found Gigi's cell phone in his chair, Bo entered and asked if there would be a reason for Gigi to take off on her own.  Rex informed Bo that Gigi would not leave without her purse.\n\n\nBrody arrived and stated that he'd found the guards locked in the supply closet but that Schuyler had not been found.  Bo immediately put out an APB out on Schuyler, and Rex asked why the police were looking for Schuyler.  Bo informed Rex that Schuyler had just found out something that would be hard for him to handle.  Bo added that Oliver Fish showed up at the prison with a DNA test proving that Fish was Sierra Rose's father.\n\n\nWhen Rex indicated that he understood how Schuyler felt, Bo revealed that he knew about Mitch not being Rex's father.  However, Bo was stunned to find out that Roxy was also not Rex's mother.  When Bo showed Rex his concern, Rex refused to feel sorry for himself and stated that his only concern was to find Gigi.  Bo bet that Gigi was with Schuyler, which relieved Rex because he knew that Schuyler loved Gigi and that Gigi would be safe with him.  When Bo asked Rex if Rex knew of a special place that both Schuyler and Gigi would go, Rex had a clue.\n\n\n At Vikki's cottage, after Schuyler ripped out the phone, Gigi demanded to know where Sierra Rose was.  Schuyler admitted to lying to her about Allison's escape and about Allison taking the baby with her.  Schuyler revealed that Allison had actually been arrested and that Sierra Rose was fine.  He declared that Sierra Rose was with her father.  After Gigi questioned what he meant by Sierra Rose and Stacy's lies, Schuyler declared, \"Without all those lies, I never would have lost you, Stacy never would have died, Sierra would never have gotten kidnapped...but your sister set it all in motion.  She condemned us!\"  He also insisted that none of it would have ever happened because Sierra Rose was not his child.\n\n\nSchuyler revealed to Gigi that Oliver Fish was Sierra Rose's biological father and a DNA test proved it.  Schuyler begged Gigi to give them another chance at the very place where Gigi first told him that she loved him - at Vikki's cottage.  He stressed that he had never slept with Stacy, but Gigi reminded him that he still had lied about the baby.\n\n\nWhen Gigi found the phone dead and requested to use Schuyler's phone to call Rex, Schuyler claimed to have forgotten it, apologized, and told Gigi that she was all he had left.  When Gigi said that she needed to see Sierra Rose and said, \"I'm sorry, I have to go,\" Schuyler answered as he pulled out a gun, \" Well, Gigi, I'm sorry, too, but you're not going anywhere.\"\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Schuyler is devastated after Oliver informs him that Sierra is his (Oliver's) daughter and not Schuyler's. He secretly takes Allison's gun when she is distracted. He declares that he must get Gigi back because she is his life and the only thing that broke them up is a lie. Allison reveals to a devastated Roxy who assumes the baby she gave birth to died all those years ago, that he did not. Yet Roxy has no clue whom her son would be. Starr is really angry at Langston for putting her up to lying to Markko for her and not admitting that she is sleeping with Ford. Markko knows that Langston is lying to him about something and asks Cole what he might know and asks him to attempt to find out from Starr. Kim knows she has to break it off with Clint. So she tells him she's cheated on him after David has blackmailed her in order not to take his birthright from him.",
