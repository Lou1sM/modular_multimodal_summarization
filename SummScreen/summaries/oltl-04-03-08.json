    "soap_central": "\n\nTalia and John spent some time at the diner, talking about their partnership and their difficulties with Antonio because of it. John assured Talia that things would be okay and casually touched her hand, causing a moment of awkwardness between them. When Talia stopped by the counter to say hello to Carlotta, Antonio's mother was short with her.\n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio overheard that Talia and John were seen at the diner together, \"looking pretty friendly.\" The new partnership seemed to be what many of the other cops on the force were talking about. When John returned, he was surprised to find Commissioner Ramsey in his office. The top cop quickly covered and said that he was there to leave the file on a case, a drug bust they were planning on making in a warehouse by the docks. John asked to have a \"little talk\" regarding Ramsey's choice to take the job in Llanview but Ramsey assured him that he was not interested in chatting. John acknowledged that he was pretty sure that Ramsey was hiding something. Talia accused Antonio of telling his mother about their relationship problems but Antonio responded that she should have had her intimate meeting elsewhere, not in his mom's place of business. Talia tried to make Antonio see the light, that Ramsey was getting what he wanted. Antonio replied that Talia was getting what she wanted, by working with John. The group headed down to the docks.\n\n\nDorian barked orders to an unknown person on the phone. \n\n\nCharlie and Roxy arrived at the diner to continue wedding plans with Dorian. They realized that they both knew the same person in Atlantic City. Charlie received a call from Jared, advising him that Natalie knew the truth. Before Charlie could clarify anything, Jared had to end the conversation, but Charlie realized he would have to talk to Viki. Roxy thought that Charlie must have received bad news since he suddenly appeared to be ill. Dorian and Viki both walked in and Roxy pleaded with Viki to join them, since she was the \"classiest\" person in the group. Dorian wasn't happy and Viki was uncomfortable, but they both decided to grin and bear it. After sitting and listening to some of Roxy's outlandish ideas, Charlie received a business call and Roxy decided to talk to Carlotta about catering. Dorian and Viki were left alone in the booth and they were quick to return to their usual demeanor\n\n\nwith each other. Dorian expressed how nice she thought it was that Viki had gotten Charlie a job at B.E., which Viki quickly denied. Since that didn't work, Dorian expressed how wonderful it was that Charlie was laying down roots in Llanview and getting involved in his son Rex's wedding. Viki asked Dorian why she was suddenly so hot on the idea of the wedding when she disliked Rex so much and didn't approve of her daughter's relationship with him. Dorian could hardly believe that Viki considered herself an expert on knowing what she thought. Viki felt unfortunate that she knew as much about Dorian as she did. Dorian confessed that she now liked Rex so much due to the wonderful father that he found, citing Charlie's many wonderful traits. When Charlie returned to the table, she repeated that same information to him. The wedding planning came to an end. Dorian made another phone call and told someone that she didn't want things messed up again. Roxy graciously took her own booth so that Viki and Charlie could sit together. Viki received a phone call from Natalie. \n\n\nUp at the Buchanan lodge, Nora tried to do some work but was interrupted by Lindsay who put down the sound of her rather loud music and then continued to talk. Lindsay suggested that everything was bothering Nora and that she had conflicted feelings about Bo. Nora was unbelievably annoyed and ordered Lindsay to take a pen and paper and write down, \" Nora does not have conflicted feelings about Bo and Clint.\" In fact, she offered that it was really wonderful that the brothers were working together. She cited that she and Bo had a child together and were merely friends with mutual respect for each other.  Lindsay felt that the two were looking at each other with flirty eyes and that ever since they were stuck in the car together, they had a new crush on each other. Nora could hardly believe her ears and went off on how yes, Bo magically created the accident that landed them stuck in the car, causing the deer to jump in front of them. She in turn believed that Lindsay was awfully obsessed with thoughts of Nora and Bo! Lindsay replied that she wouldn't wish Nora on Bo or any other man and Nora's retort was that at least she didn't kill men. The arguing escalated. Jared wanted to know how long Natalie was going to keep \"the secret\" but she could only tell him she'd divulge it when she felt like it. She figured it wasn't a good time with all of the problems that B.E. was having recently. She also cited the pleasure she was getting out of seeing him sweat. Bo, Clint and Matthew returned from a hike and wondered about the conversation. Jared went off with Matt and Natalie lied that they had been talking about a problem at work. The men wondered about the friction they had noticed between Nat and Jared and felt that it was all on Nat. Clint wanted to know what she was keeping from them.\n\n\nAt the docks, John walked into the warehouse with a bag of money, as the other cops kept watch. The drug dealer held a gun on him, wondering where the original buyer was. John advised him that the other guy had been busted; the dealer agreed to count the money while John inspected the drugs he was selling. Still uncomfortable with John being there, the man confessed that he didn't trust John and held the gun on him again. John was able to trick him and took control of the situation, tussled briefly and took the gun. Ramsey suddenly appeared with a gun trained on John, who asked if he was planning on shooting him. Ramsey admitted that would be too easy and summoned the others. Talia was worried about John after the brief fight; Ramsey pointed out her worry. He snidely told John that she'd be more worried about herself if she knew of John's history with women. He told John to stay with the drugs and money while the others escorted the man outside. \n\n\nNatalie freaked out and wondered about her father's new adoration of Jared and why he was suddenly Jared's biggest fan. She pointed out that she was probably no longer needed in the family business and stalked off. Bo and Clint were extremely confused. After receiving a phone call from Phyllis at B.E. advising of a new takeover attempt, everyone decided to head back to Llanview. Lindsay asked for the name of the latest rival but Clint assured her he did not want her help again. She felt that he wasn't being smart, especially since he had already rekindled feelings between Bo and Nora. Matt and Jared were playing a video game together. Matt pointed out how sad it was that Jared was not in any of the family photo albums. Jared didn't mind and felt that his new situation with the family was nearly perfect. Everyone departed, leaving Nat and Jared to wait for Nigel to return from the store. He asked her to play the video games but she quickly assured him that she wouldn't play any kind of game with him. She called her mom and wondered if Charlie was going to propose. She told Jared that Viki was waiting to hear something important from Charlie. \n\n\nJohn recalled seeing Ramsey in his office. Just then, Ramsey walked back into the warehouse with Antonio and Talia and pointed out that John had been left alone with evidence. He ordered Antonio to search him. Antonio found something in John's pocket.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ramsey is obviously scheming something in regard to his three officers. And Antonio is furious at Talia and John for being so friendly to each other and disrespecting him. And it looks like Ramsey wants to set John up to look like he is keeping drugs in his possession so that Antonio can have the chance to bust him. Viki asks Dorian why she is so unrealistically friendly, all of a sudden toward her daughter marrying Rex, knowing that she was totally against it from the start. She knows Dorian is up to something. After Jared has revealed to Natalie that he lied about being a Buchanan, she does not tell the others. But she is furious at him. She doesn't want to forgive him nor \"take advantage\" of the fact that they are not related. Charlie is also very worried about what will happen when Viki finds out he and Jared lied. At that cabin, Nora and Lindsay argue and obsess about the Buchanan brothers as usual. The group leaves the cabin after Clint gets a call that they have to tend to business back at the office.",
