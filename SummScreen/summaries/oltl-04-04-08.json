Natalie explained that Buchanan Enterprises would continue to be under attack if Jared's true identity was ever exposed. Upon realizing that Natalie had no plans to reveal that he wasn't a Buchanan, Jared made a desperate attempt to phone Charlie. Jared planned to alert Charlie of the situation, before Charlie revealed their true identities to Viki. As Jared left Charlie a voicemail, he was interrupted when Natalie and Nigel entered the room. Natalie demanded to know how Jared discovered that David Vickers was Asa's son. When Jared admitted to overhearing Nigel discussing the revelation at the reading of the will, Natalie immediately realized that Alex Olanov also knew the truth. Horrified at the thought of Alex knowing damaging information about her family, Natalie lashed out at Jared and Nigel. After they assured her that Alex was paid to keep the information private, an angered Natalie then accused Jared of paying off Pamela Stuart to keep the secret. When Natalie referred to Pamela as one of Asa's money-grubbing ex-wives, Jared became upset and demanded that Natalie not speak of Pamela in that way. Jared told Natalie that Pamela was a friend of the family and often mentioned her life with the Buchanans. He explained how Pamela's stories about the Buchanan clan gave him hopes of wanting to one day become a part of such a family. Natalie began to remember the day Allison revealed that Natalie was actually a Buchanan. Jared's speech reminded Natalie of her own desires to become a part of such a glamorous family. Jared attempted to convince Natalie that they were very much alike. Natalie asked Jared if he had succeeded at getting everything he had ever wanted. Giving Natalie a knowing look, Jared stated that he didn't have everything he always wanted. In an unsympathetic tone, Natalie replied, \"That was your choice.\" As Natalie left the room, Jared rushed to call Charlie again. \n\n\nAt the diner, Charlie attempted to tell Viki the truth about being Jared's father, but was interrupted by a rambunctious Roxy, who wanted to discuss plans for Rex and Adriana's wedding. Although Charlie and Viki were obviously bothered by Roxy's intrusion, they were kind and allowed her to join them. After listening to several of Roxy's outlandish ideas, Viki politely asked for some time alone with Charlie. While Roxy eavesdropped at a nearby booth, Charlie began telling Viki how special she was to him. Charlie was having a difficult time revealing the truth to Viki about being Jared's father. As Charlie came close to divulging his secret, he was interrupted by Markko, who informed Charlie that he had received an emergency phone call. When a frustrated Charlie excused himself to take the call, Roxy joined Viki. Viki was surprised when Roxy declared that Charlie was trying to propose to Viki. Viki dismissed the idea, but Roxy was certain that Charlie wanted to marry Viki. Across the room, Charlie discovered Jared on the phone. Jared explained that Natalie knew he wasn't a Buchanan, but had no knowledge of Charlie's true identity. Jared begged Charlie not to reveal the truth to Viki. After Charlie returned to the table, Roxy stunned both Viki and Charlie, when she blurted out that Charlie should propose to Viki immediately. Once alone, Viki noticed Charlie's strange behavior and asked if he did intend to propose marriage to her. Charlie sat speechless. Believing Charlie intended to propose, Viki appeared elated and told Charlie she owed him an answer. \n\n\nEscorted by Shaun, a frazzled Starr arrived at the diner to meet Langston. Starr pleaded with Shaun to allow her some privacy, but Shaun refused. When Shaun told Starr that he observed Langston enter the drugstore across the street, Starr became alarmed and wondered if Todd had given Shaun instructions to watch Langston also. While waiting for Langston to arrive, Starr complained to Markko about being guarded at all times and not being allowed to see Cole. Meanwhile, Shaun phoned Todd and reported Starr's whereabouts. Todd ordered Shaun to have Starr home within the hour. While Shaun's attention was diverted and Markko had stepped away, Langston arrived and showed Starr the pregnancy test that she had purchased. A worried Starr admitted to feeling sick recently, but couldn't believe that she might possibly be pregnant. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair praised Todd for attempting to make amends with Starr. Their discussion soon turned to Ramsey. Blair mentioned that Todd no longer seemed concerned about Ramsey. Todd stated that Ramsey's focus appeared to no longer be directed at Todd, but now at John. Meanwhile, Layla arrived at La Boulaie to discuss Adriana's wedding plans and was greeted by Dorian. The two began discussing Adriana's concern with Gigi possibly ruining the wedding. When Layla expressed Adriana's concern that Rex might be Shane's father, Dorian dismissed the idea. However, Dorian became interested when Layla recalled several encounters that she observed between Rex and Gigi. Layla told Dorian that she didn't blame Adriana for being suspicious of Gigi. \n\n\nGigi was visibly shaken when Rex arrived at Llanfair to take Shane to baseball practice. When Gigi demanded to know why Shane would ask Rex to attend his practice, Shane sadly explained that his friends' fathers always came to the games. After Shane left to look for his glove, Rex demanded to know why Gigi thwarted every attempt he made to spend time with Shane. Rex felt that as a single parent, Gigi should allow her friends to help her with Shane. When Gigi told Rex that Adriana would have a problem with his spending time with Shane, Rex stated that Adriana didn't feel threatened by his friendship with Gigi and Shane. Gigi expressed concern that Rex wouldn't have much time for Shane after the wedding, but Rex declared that he would never desert Shane. As Rex and Gigi discussed Shane, Shane bolted downstairs and asked his mother if his glove was with his other birthday presents. Gigi nearly panicked when Rex asked Shane if he had a birthday recently. After diverting Rex's questioning, Gigi agreed to allow Rex to take Shane to practice. Before Shane left with Rex, Shane apologized to his mother for mentioning his birthday in front of Rex. Gigi told her son that everything was fine, but to never mention it again. \n\n\nAt the docks, Antonio followed Ramsey's orders and searched John. As Antonio patted John down, Ramsey had a flashback of entering John's office and planting drugs in his jacket. When Antonio announced that he had discovered something in John's pocket, Talia refused to believe that John would have any illegal involvement. A smirk crossed Ramsey's face, and he stated that John was capable of betraying the public trust. Antonio's search revealed a pack of gum. Aggravated, Ramsey ordered Antonio to conduct a better search. After a second frisk, Antonio told Ramsey that John wasn't in possession of any contraband. Disgusted, John left the docks with Talia following close behind. \n\n\nBack at the police station, John confronted Antonio about helping Ramsey set him up. When Antonio denied any involvement, the two men began to argue relentlessly. Appalled by Antonio's apparent betrayal, John walked away. John entered Ramsey's office and accused the commissioner of planting drugs on him. John suggested that Ramsey wanted him off the force and out of his way. Ramsey never denied the accusations; instead he began to belittle John and joked about John being sexually involved with Talia. Meanwhile, Talia confronted Antonio about his cooperation with Ramsey. When Antonio suggested that Ramsey's suspicions about John might be true, Talia lashed out at Antonio. Talia told Antonio that Ramsey was the criminal, not John. As the two argued, John stormed out of Ramsey's office and brushed past them. In a sarcastic tone, Antonio suggested that Talia go after him. \n\n\nWhen Starr and Langston returned home, Todd approached them. He demanded that Langston allow him to search her purse. As Starr begged her father not to look inside the purse, Todd pulled out the pregnancy test and asked what it was. As Blair looked on, Starr told her father he was embarrassing Langston and stated that the bag contained tampons. At Blair's urging, Todd returned the purse to Langston. A disgusted Langston snatched her purse from Todd and stormed upstairs. \n\n\nAs Nigel finished packing, he reminded Jared that he couldn't expect to date Natalie, while posing as her uncle. Jared didn't appear convinced. He asked if Nigel had ever been in love before. \n\n\nBefore leaving the cabin, Natalie and Jared found themselves alone again. When Jared mentioned how Clint reminded him of Asa, Natalie became disturbed. Natalie stated that Clint was nothing like Asa. Natalie believed that Asa was ruthless, and Clint didn't posses any heartless traits. Natalie admitted that she was worried by Clint's recent handling of B.E. business, but felt her father would never resort to Asa's ways. Later, Natalie placed a call requesting to meet with Pamela Stuart. \n\n\nAs Gigi sat in the library and remarked that she was all alone at Llanfair, Todd appeared and told Gigi that she wasn't alone. When Gigi attempted to walk past Todd, he prevented her from leaving by closing the doors to the library. Todd demanded to know why Gigi remained in Llanview. \n\n\nAfter baseball practice, Rex and Shane entered the diner. Noticing that Shane needed a new baseball glove, Rex asked the little boy when his birthday was. Rex was suspicions when Shane vowed him to secrecy. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian placed a call to someone demanding information on a deceased sailor named Brody Lovett. \n\n\nIn Starr's bedroom, Starr expressed relief that Todd didn't discover the pregnancy test. Langston urged Starr to take the test, and prayed that the results were negative. As Starr held the test in her hand, she and Langston sat on the bed and discussed how Starr's life could possibly be changed forever. Langston promised to stand by Starr no matter what the outcome. As the girls looked down at the test, Starr gasped, \"Oh my God!\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Langston is attempting to \"smuggle\" a pregnancy test into the house for Starr to take, but Todd is watching over both of them. Charlie knows he is going to have to \"drop the bombshell\" upon Viki before she hears it from somebody else and since Jared has dropped it upon Natalie, but too many interruptions prevent him from getting it out. Roxy assumes that his \"big revelation\" to Viki is that he wants her to marry him, and Viki assumes that is his secret. Natalie assures Jared and Nigel that she will not reveal their secret, but she's concerned that if anybody else knows that David Vickers is Asa's real son, it will be revealed. Ramsay is \"playing\" his three officers. He is hoping that Antonio will help him set John up to look like he is pocketing drugs. Antonio seems disappointed that he cannot do what his \"boss\" wants him to do. Talia is very disappointed in Antonio, but she and John are getting along really well. Rex and Shane are growing close, and Gigi is not ok with that. She especially does not want Shane to reveal to Rex when his birthday is and exactly how old he is. And why would that be?",

The two began discussing AdriANA's concern that possibly ruining the wedding might be ruining the idea of Rex and Dorian being together.\n"
