Clint wanted to prevent Viki from making a mistake and believed her actions mostly revolved around stopping him from being with Dorian, not pursuing him herself. She had spoken out in public about a private matter, and in fact, since it was private, he didn't want to discuss it.\n\n\nJessica just remembered how wonderful things had been when she'd been a kid, though it hadn't lasted. She and Antonio would have to make it last, Clint told her. She mentioned the adoption of Jamie, who finally had a stable life, but she felt like she was fighting it. She asked what was wrong with her for having serious doubts.\n\n\nClint reassured Jessica and advised that it was a major decision, but everyone screwed up their kids. He suggested she talk to Antonio if she was afraid of failing. Jessica changed her mind about her parents. She agreed that Viki had been wrong in what she had done.\n\n\nAntonio had the adoption papers ready for Jessica's signature but seemed preoccupied as he and Talia waited for Vincent at the station. He confided that his blended family would be a little more complicated than most. Vincent learned that he was no longer a suspect in the arsons, and it turned out that Sean was familiar with the group attached to the medallion. He remembered his grandfather talking of them back in Chicago. The cops would call him.\n\n\nVincent vowed to find the white trash if Antonio didn't. He also wanted Sean's involvement kept quiet, which Antonio promised to do. Jessica arrived to pick Antonio up for their date, but since he'd be delayed, she agreed to meet with him at Capricorn. She couldn't sign the papers, she confessed, quickly noting that they needed to have a celebration to go along with it. She could sign them at the club later then, Antonio agreed.\n\n\nAt the coffee shop, Marty tried to chat with Starr, who really wanted no part of her since she and Cole had broken up. Marty assured her that she was not happy that they were miserable, and she was sorry things had turned out as they had. Cole had been more alive with Starr, and she was very grateful, but they had no future. Starr told her to shove it because she and Cole were not like Todd and Marty. In fact, she continued, if she were Cole, she'd wire Marty's jaws shut.\n\n\nNatalie sauntered over and thought there was a problem, telling Marty to leave Starr alone because Starr loved Marty's son and was trying to do the right thing. Evangeline was there, too, and stood up for Todd. He was only sorry he'd gotten caught, Marty retorted -- Todd was too protective of his children. Evangeline felt that both Todd and Marty were responsible for what had happened.\n\n\nMarty felt it was necessary to share some of the details of her rape. Evangeline insisted that Todd was a changed man, but Marty saw him as someone who always hurt the people who cared about him. She warned Evangeline that she'd find out herself.\n\n\nStarr learned that Natalie and John had broken up, as well, and that sometimes the problems were too big even if a couple was in love. She and Cole got along fine, Starr insisted. It was her father who was the problem. Vincent and Sean entered the shop. Jones expressed sadness over Natalie's breakup.\n\n\nCuriosity had Todd showing up at Miles's suite for news of his son. Miles insisted his letter from Spencer was real and that the boy was alive. The death certificate Todd had could have been easily forged as well. He could provide Todd with a clue as to the child's whereabouts, but he had to make sure that Todd was deserving. He didn't want to see an innocent child hurt.\n\n\nTodd maintained that he was a good father and loved his children. Miles was trying to accept the fact that Spencer had not been the person he'd thought. After some back-and-forth over whether Todd was a good father or not, Miles finally handed over the part of the letter that he'd copied for Todd. The contents turned out to be disappointing, but it might be enough.\n\n\nJust as Cole was about to take a beating from his sparring partner, John stepped in and broke them apart. It appeared that Cole might have a concussion, but he didn't want his mother to know because she was already freaking out over everything else, the boy confided. \"Do you have a death wish?\" John asked. He was at the boxing ring to prove he could handle Todd, Cole explained. \"Sometimes you can't do enough,\" John countered, agreeing to keep the incident a secret from Marty.\n\n\nJohn and Cole had a nice conversation. Cole explained that he couldn't do sports and would need several recommendations to play again. He also played baseball. He only had school and his feelings, as he needed to speak to a therapist as well. John offered to write one of the recommendations and suggested that Cole stop by the station to talk.\n\n\nNash drank alone at Capricorn as Cristian tended bar. He suggested that Nash go elsewhere, since Jessica wasn't around. He was there for a paycheck, Nash replied. Cristian was pretty rude and said he didn't want Nash around. He got the check and warned Nash to watch his step. As Blair got ready to perform, a drunk harassed her, and things got rather loud.\n\n\nCristian stepped in to help, but Blair was already retrieving a glass to crack on the man's head. Unfortunately, the timing was off, and Cristian was the one to get clunked instead. Nash went behind the bar to get some ice and towels, and Jessica was there. She accidentally knocked a drink over onto the adoption papers. Nash looked it over and wondered why her signature wasn't there.\n\n\nEvangeline arrived at Todd's, but there was no answer to her knock on the door. She remembered Marty's earlier words of advice and figured she should have listened. She turned around and left.\n\n\n\n\n",

Jessica comes to see Clint before she goes to pick up Antonio. Jessica confronts Clint about what he had done to Viki. Starr gets herself a cup of coffee. Marty comes up behind her and pays her a compliment about he drinking all the coffee and not gaining an ounce. Starr tells her not to do this.
