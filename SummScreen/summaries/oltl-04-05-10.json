    "soap_central": "\n \nAt Llanfair, Jessica asked Cristian about the project assigned for his class because she wanted to make sure she had it down. He informed her that the assignment was posted online, but she had no idea what \"online\" meant. She handed Cristian a laptop that her mother gave to Jessica before Viki left for London, and Cristian showed her how to navigate it. Natalie walked in and wondered what the two were doing. Jessica told her sister that Cristian had given her a ride home and was educating her about the world wide web. Natalie sarcastically asked if they were studying biology as Jessica once again accused her sister of stealing other people's boyfriends.\n\n\nCristian explained that he was just showing Jessica how to work the computer, but Natalie asked if Layla knew that he was at Llanfair. His silence indicated a \"no.\" Natalie called the fact that Cristian and Jessica were spending time together inappropriate, to which Jessica replied that Natalie was only thinking about John McBain. Jessica accused Natalie of taking her frustration about John and Marty out on Jessica and Cristian. In order to stop the arguing, Cristian asked Jessica to get him a soda and she obliged. Natalie apologized to Cristian about snapping at them. Cristian asked if it was true that Natalie was hung up on John.\n\n\nNatalie once again apologized for taking her frustration out on Cristian. She told him that she was dealing with drama with Rex and Roxy, but that she didn't want to talk about it. She then informed Cristian that John and Marty had decided to move in together. Cristian asked if it bothered her, to which Natalie initially said no, but then let her true feelings show. She said it would be selfish to not wish them well, but that Jessica was right, \"I am so jealous.\"\n\n\nNatalie explained that after Jared had died, John was always there for her, and that she tried to do the same thing for him. She updated Cristian on everything that happened when she and John were stuck on the mountain. She admitted that she couldn't stop wondering what would have happened if Marty had never gotten pregnant and also wondered if that thought was a terrible one to have. Cristian reassured her that the thought was normal. As Jessica listened in on the conversation, Natalie wondered if the same \"what if\" things happened with Cristian and Jessica.\n\n\nCristian told Natalie that Jessica's condition brought back a lot of memories, but that he had a girlfriend that he loved very much. An eavesdropping Jessica looked disappointed. Cristian updated Natalie on the argument he and Layla had about throwing away the old letter from him to Jessica. He articulated that the letter brought back good memories, so he shouldn't have to throw it out, to which Natalie related. As the two friends shared a hug, Jessica entered with Cristian's soda \"just the way you like it!\" Jessica then apologized to Natalie for being rude and not acting like a sister, and embraced her.\n\n\nJessica offered more soda to Cristian, but he had to leave. He reminded her that he would see her, \"and the rest of the crew,\" bright and early to work on the sets for the musical. Natalie thanked him for the talk, and he left. She assured Jessica that Jessica would get over Cristian. Spitefully, Jessica told her surprised sister that, \"just because you and John are through doesn't mean it's over for me and Cristian.\"\n\n\nJohn opened the door of his room to Kelly. She apologized for barging in, but said that she couldn't reach Bo, and John was the best detective on the force. She wanted him to help her solve her mother's murder. Because John needed to pick Marty up from the hospital, he instructed Kelly to stop by the station the next day to talk. She agreed as John's phone rang. It was Marty, who told him that she was tired and that she was just going to go to sleep. John hung up the phone and agreed to talk to Kelly.\n\n\nKelly reminded John that, after Mitch started threatening Dorian's family, Kelly's mother died of an apparent heart attack, even though Melinda had no heart issues. She informed John about the mysterious, whispering caller who claimed that Kelly's mother was murdered, then quickly proceeded to hang up the phone. Kelly had assumed the murderer to be a follower of Mitch. However, she brought up the fact that Allison admitted to initially going after Cassie then realizing that Melinda would be an easier target. Allison planned the whole thing out, but arrived at Melinda's home to find that she was already dead. John was skeptical, but Kelly believed Allison.\n\n\nKelly mentioned that Todd had his team of private investigators working on the case. Kelly explained to a confused John that she had her old job at the Sun back, and that Todd was there when one of the calls came in. John let Kelly know that she couldn't trust Todd because he only helped people when there was something in it for him. John opted to be at the hospital when Marty woke up, so he implored Kelly to show up at the station the next day to talk more. In the meantime, he attached a device to Kelly's cell phone that could track where any calls were originating, and advised Kelly not to tell Todd if the mystery man called again.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rex and Bo asked Nora, Matthew, Destiny, and Dani if they had seen Schuyler and Gigi. The group hadn't, but wondered why the two men wanted to know. \"Custody stuff,\" Bo replied as he pulled Nora aside to talk to her. When Nora left, the high schoolers started talking about the musical. The girls began to argue about whether or not Dani stole Destiny's audition song. As Dani admitted that she didn't want the part, anyway, Matthew, playing peacemaker, told the girls that they both had great auditions.\n\n\nRex and Bo briefly summarized the night's happenings to Nora, including the fact that Fish was Sierra's father. Nora felt sorry for Schuyler until Rex informed her that Schuyler ran off with Gigi and a gun; Rex called Schuyler a sore loser. Rex reiterated how he wasn't gone from his apartment for very long, and that Gigi never went anywhere without her phone. They ruled out a struggle and the possibility of Schuyler drugging Gigi. Rex reasoned that she would only go somewhere so quickly if there were something wrong with Shane or Sierra. Rex finally realized that Schuyler probably took Gigi up to Viki's cabin. As Rex and Bo dashed out of Rodi's, Nora begged them to call for backup.\n\n\nStill at Statesville, Todd was on the phone, asking who had made the calls to Kelly. T\u00e9a entered and Todd told the person on the phone that he'd call back. He asked T\u00e9a where Dani was, to which she replied that Dani was with Matthew. T\u00e9a asked if Todd had seen Schuyler. Todd updated T\u00e9a on the recent happenings in the prison that had to do with her client, but had no idea what happened to Schuyler or Sierra. T\u00e9a asked a guard about what transpired with Allison, the baby, and Schuyler. He told her that Allison was in custody, the baby was safely with Officer Fish, and Schuyler was on the loose, \"armed and dangerous.\" T\u00e9a blamed herself, lamenting her decision to not call the police when she should have.\n\n\nTodd told T\u00e9a that he was going to take her to Dani because it would make her feel better. T\u00e9a accused Todd of using her to get near Dani, but went with him anyway. Before leaving, she handed the guard her business card and told him to call her with any news about Schuyler. When the pair arrived at Rodi's, T\u00e9a thanked Nora for looking after Dani. The kids, still talking about the musical, filled Todd in on his role as the villain in Langston's musical. Seeing Todd's cockiness in his claims that his actions were to protect Starr, Dani changed her mind. She declared that she did want to be a part of the musical, after all, because she knew how Starr felt and wanted the audience to feel it too.\n\n\nA few feet away, Nora checked her phone for an update from Bo. Nora enlightened T\u00e9a about how Schuyler had run off with Gigi and a gun, and Rex and Bo's mission to catch him. After Nora checked her phone once again, T\u00e9a excused herself to talk to Todd. As Todd and T\u00e9a discussed their daughter, Matthew wondered if his mother were okay. She replied that she was just nervous about Bo, but that it \"comes with the territory.\"\n\n\nRoxy, trying to get answers about her real son, let Allison know that Rex would never be the same after he was told the news about his parentage. Allison, surprised that Roxy actually told Rex, informed Roxy that her real son was alive. Roxy didn't believe her, but Allison insisted that it could be her last chance to tell the truth.\n\n\nAllison claimed that she couldn't tell Mitch that the baby Roxy delivered to him all those years before wasn't his, so she lied about the baby's background. Because Allison's sister couldn't have children of her own, Allison gave Roxy's baby to her because she could give the baby a good life, unlike Roxy. She told Roxy not to complain since she had two kids of her own. Still, Roxy wanted to know where her real son was. Allison claimed he had just been at Statesville a minute before. Roxy inquired if he was in prison to which Allison replied, \"Not yet, but you never know!\"\n\n\nRoxy again demanded to know who her son was, but Allison warned her that she wouldn't like the answer because Roxy couldn't stand the man. Roxy was surprised to learn that she actually knew him. Allison advised Roxy that she hated her son. Roxy asserted that she hated no one but Mitch and Allison. \"Even the guy who stole Gigi from Rex?\"\n\n\nAs Roxy made all the connections, she beat herself up for being so horrible to Schuyler. Allison counseled her that, just because he was family, it didn't mean Roxy's behavior towards Schuyler wasn't just. While Allison was being taken out, she said that it was lucky Mitch never knew about Schuyler, anyway, because he was a druggie, and Mitch saw druggies as weak.\n\n\nAt the cabin, Gigi insisted that she needed to see Sierra, so she was going to leave. Before she could, Schuyler pulled the stolen gun on her and told her that he wasn't going to let her leave. She wondered if Schuyler was going to shoot her, but he claimed that he could never hurt her. While waving the gun around, Schuyler professed that they belonged together and that they had a second chance. Schuyler tried to remind Gigi how they loved each other, but Gigi finally shouted that their relationship was a mistake and based on lies, most of them because of Stacy.\n\n\nGigi walked away from Schuyler as he kept trying to get her to make love to him. He attempted to jog her memory about how happy they had been together but Gigi refused to have any of it. Schuyler started to build a fire in order to help recreate the couple's first night together as Gigi begged to go home. Schuyler vowed that he would never force her into sex, but subsequently told her to take off her clothes to let him make love to her.\n\n\nRex, Bo, and their backup arrived in front of the cabin and saw the smoke coming from the chimney. Inside the cabin, Gigi wouldn't hear any of what Schuyler was saying. Schuyler claimed to have nothing left and held the gun to his head. Gigi screamed loud enough for Rex and Bo to hear. Rex busted through the door as Gigi was stopping Schuyler from shooting himself.\n\n\nRex started to beat Schuyler up. Bo pulled Rex off of Schuyler, who got up and grabbed the gun off the floor. Schuyler alleged that he had lost everything because of Rex. Gigi begged Schuyler to put the gun down so they could talk. Doing the opposite, Schuyler pointed the gun and pulled the trigger.\n\n\n",

Todd finds that his daughter, Dani wants to be part of Langston's play that incriminates him regarding Starr and Cole.

But he does not put down the gun and fires a shot. Jessica is still determined to get Cristian back and Natalie admits that she is not \"complete\" with John and Marty having a baby and living together.
