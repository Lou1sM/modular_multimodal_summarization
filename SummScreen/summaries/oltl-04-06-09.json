As Rex pleaded with Gigi to reconsider the breakup, Roxy interrupted and questioned what was going on. When Rex told her that Gigi had called off their relationship after sleeping with Brody, Roxy grew suspicious. Roxy encouraged the couple to remain a family and support Shane, but Gigi was adamant that she could no longer remain with Rex. \n\n\nNearby, Stacy nearly panicked when Kyle told her that she hadn't tested as a match for Shane. Stating that she had been made aware of several recent mishaps involving the Llanview Hospital lab, Stacy claimed that she'd had a test administered at another site. When Kyle questioned her about the other test, Stacy made up an excuse and ran off. \n\n\nAlthough upset by the news of Rex and Gigi's breakup, Roxy was excited to learn that a new donor had been discovered. When Gigi asked the identity of the new donor, Stacy appeared and announced that she was the donor. Giving Stacy a knowing look, Roxy exclaimed, \"Oh, I see! This is your doing!\" Stacy suggested that they tell Shane the news, but Gigi insisted that Shane learn from his parents. As Gigi watched in disgust, Rex thanked Stacy for saving his son's life. \n\n\nAfter Rex and Gigi had left, Roxy slapped Stacy and accused her of plotting against Rex and Gigi. Stacy threatened to expose Roxy's secret unless Roxy kept quiet. Roxy argued that Stacy could never stop Rex and Gigi from loving each other, but Stacy was convinced that she could make Rex fall in love with her. As Roxy questioned how Stacy intended to make John Doe's bone marrow appear to be hers, Kyle informed Roxy that her friend, John Doe, was a match for Shane. Suspicious, Kyle demanded to know what the two women were up to. \n\n\nExplaining that the family hated John Doe, Stacy said that they didn't want to cause Shane's parents any further heartache. As Roxy looked on, Stacy insisted that Shane could die and pleaded with Kyle to help them. A curious Kyle wondered how he could help. Stacy suggested that Kyle go to the clinic where John Doe was resting and retrieve his bone marrow. Stacy said that she would admit herself into the hospital and Kyle could manipulate the test to make it appear as though she was the actual donor. To their surprise, Kyle agreed to help Stacy and Roxy, but swore them to secrecy. Advising them that he needed to run a battery of tests on John Doe, Kyle instructed Stacy and Roxy to take him to the patient. \n\n\nBefore checking on Shane, Gigi asked Rex not to mention their breakup to him. An angered Rex told Gigi that he would keep quiet for Shane's sake. Rex and Gigi tried to cheer up Shane, but the little boy told his parents that he had learned the truth from Stacy -- there was no donor. When Rex and Gigi told Shane that Stacy had tested as a match, the little boy was elated and grateful to his aunt. As Shane continued to remark how happy he was to have Stacy in their lives, Gigi appeared distraught. Shane asked his parents for a group hug. Rex and Gigi put on a brave front for their little boy. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jared appeared uncomfortable when Charlie mentioned what a blessing it was to have Chloe in their lives. Realizing that Jared was troubled, Charlie questioned his son. Jared admitted that he had information that could change many lives and asked his father how he would handle the situation. Reminding Jared about the tragedies that had occurred the last time he and Natalie had kept a secret, Charlie told his son to make a decision before it tore him apart. Citing that the circumstances were completely different and the secret wasn't being kept for selfish reasons, Jared stated that the secret could do a great deal of damage to many people. Charlie advised his son, \"Do the greatest good to the greatest number of people.\" \n\n\nMarcie was surprised when she discovered Natalie kneeling over Baby Hope's gravesite. While Natalie listened, Marcie opened up about her acceptance of Hope's death. Acknowledging that she had recurring dreams about Hope being alive, Marcie admitted that the child's death had ultimately pulled her and Mike back together. \n\n\nA look of panic crossed Natalie's face when Marcie remarked that she and Jessica were experiencing the same pain. Marcie insisted that the birth of Chloe had helped Jessica get over the loss of Nash. Marcie encouraged Natalie to accept Jessica's offer to be Chloe's godmother. Marcie was certain that Natalie would make a wonderful godmother and act in the best interest in the child. \n\n\nLater, Natalie returned home. She and Jared discussed the best way to handle their dilemma. While Jared was unsure, Natalie related her conversation with Marcie. Stating that Marcie had accepted Hope's death, Natalie was certain that the news would destroy Jessica. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Officer Fish told John and Marty that Zack Rosen had been in Llanview for several months. John instructed Fish to find out where Zack was hiding. Citing that she had sent him to prison, Marty wondered why Zack wouldn't simply go after her. John stated that he didn't believe that Marty was the target. Insisting that the killer was sending a message, John had a theory. Todd had instigated the rape and had also spent very little time in prison. John believed that Zack was angered by spending years in prison and jealous of Todd's good fortune. \n\n\nWhen Marty questioned if they should alert Todd, John said that everyone connected to Rosen should be contacted. John asked Fish if he had contacted the members of his old fraternity. Insisting that not everyone in his fraternity had a criminal mind like Rosen, Fish remarked that he had recently run into an old fraternity brother who was a med student. Marty related that Zack's major in college had been pre-med. \n\n\nMarty wondered what Zack's possible motive could be. John believed that he intended to frame Todd for the murders. Leaving a picture of Zack in her possession, John asked her to keep her eyes open. John was convinced that Zack was no longer the same person that Marty had known in college. \n\n\nAt Todd's office, Zack complimented Todd on his new face. Zack informed Todd that he had been keeping tabs on Zack while Zack had been in prison. Zack expressed his anger that Todd had enjoyed a great life while he had rotted in prison. Blaming Todd for pressuring him and Powell to commit the rape against Marty, Zack said that he had taken a hit for Todd and needed his help. \n\n\nPicking up a letter opener from Todd's desk, Zack announced that he wanted Todd to give him a million dollars. With a smirk, Zack asked Todd about his relationship with Marty. Zack remarked that Todd had better be careful because Marty's friends didn't appear to live very long. Todd questioned how much Zack knew about the killings and asked if he was responsible. \n\n\nTodd refused to give Zack monetary assistance and kicked him out of his office. Zack stood outside of Todd's office and exclaimed, \"This isn't over, Manning!\" \n\n\nAt Schuyler's apartment, a half-dressed Starr begged Schuyler to admit that he had feelings for her. Horrified, Schuyler insisted that there was nothing between them. He instructed her to get dressed and leave his apartment at once. At that moment, Cole started banging on the door. Threatening to break the door down, Cole demanded that Schuyler let him in. \n\n\nWhen Schuyler opened the door, Cole barged inside the apartment. Cole searched the apartment but didn't notice Starr, who was hiding in the bathroom. Cole demanded to know if Schuyler was sleeping with Starr, but Schuyler insisted that Starr was a child and that he didn't have a sexual relationship with her and never would. Accusing Schuyler of taking advantage of Starr, Cole warned him to stay away from her and stormed out of the apartment. \n\n\nStarr emerged from the bathroom and told Schuyler that she didn't believe what he had said to Cole. Starr begged Schuyler to stop denying his true feelings for her. Starr stressed that she thought about him often and insisted that they shared something special. Fed up with Starr's performance, Schuyler screamed, \"There is nothing between us! Face reality! I don't want you!\" Humiliated, Starr grabbed her belongings and ran out of the apartment. Out in the hall, Cole observed Starr leaving the apartment. \n\n\nCole sat at Hope's gravesite. He told his dead child that he would give anything if she were still alive. Cole insisted that everything would be fine if Hope had lived. Stating that he wanted Starr to be happy and for them to be together, Cole exclaimed that things would never be the same and popped a pill in his mouth. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Starr composed a letter to Schuyler. Meanwhile, a frustrated Schuyler sat in his apartment and went over the day's events in his mind. \n\n\n",
