She also had something to show him and she presented him with the taped-up letter to Jessica that he had ripped up earlier. She apologized for being angry about the letter he had written to Jessica in high school, since it was so old. She had thought about it and realized that the letter was \"sweet\" as was the whole \"young love\" that Jessica and Cristian had shared. \"What a great guy you were,\" she told Cristian, who just wanted to forget about the whole thing. In turn, he apologized for walking out on her after their spat over the letter.\n\n\nThe couple hugged and joked about how well they fought. Layla asked where Cristian had been all evening and he said he had eaten dinner at the diner. Having second thoughts, he admitted that he had been with Jessica. He explained that she had been stranded at the diner and he had taken her home. He had helped with her homework and spent some time with Natalie. Visibly annoyed again, Layla was unable to suppress her feelings. Cristian assured her that she had nothing to worry about. \"Can you see why this bothers me?\" Layla asked.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica sarcastically informed Natalie that just because Natalie and John were over didn't mean that Jessica and Cristian were. Taken aback, Natalie expressed her belief that she and Jessica were friends again. Jessica spat that Natalie stood a better chance with John than she did with her sister. Natalie could only wonder why Jessica was taking shots at her but Jessica emphatically advised Natalie to stay out of her business, especially where Cristian was concerned. Natalie advised Jessica that she only wanted to save her sister from heartache, but Jessica suggested that Natalie worry about her own broken heart.\n\n\nQuickly, Natalie denied that her heart was broken but Jessica didn't believe it. She thought that she and Natalie were both in love with men who had complicated situations, but Natalie didn't see the similarity. Abruptly, Natalie warned Jessica that Cristian was in love with Layla and he wasn't about to leave her for Jessica. Natalie was sorry, but she noticed that subtlety wasn't working. Jessica looked as though she'd been slapped as Natalie continued to voice her opinion. Natalie thought that there were many men who would love to go out with Jessica, like Brody, so Jessica shouldn't be wasting her time.\n\n\nJessica was disgusted that people always mentioned Brody to her when she had no feelings towards him. She thought that Cristian had begun to remember what they had meant to each other. Natalie assured Jessica that he was remembering their past only. \"Are we done?\" Jessica wanted to know. She thought that Natalie was miserable and was trying to make Jessica feel the same way. When her phone began to ring, Jessica ignored it when she saw that it was Brody.\n\n\nGreg assured Oliver and Kyle that Sierra was fine and in good health. He urged them to take her home from the hospital so that she could get some sleep. John, who was waiting around for Marty to wake up, was surprised to see the men with the baby and even more so when he learned that Oliver was Sierra's father. \"Wow,\" John managed to say.\n\n\nHe congratulated Oliver and recalled the conversation he had with Oliver regarding fatherhood. John realized that Oliver had been referring to Sierra. Oliver was concerned that he didn't have any time to prepare for Sierra's arrival, but Kyle assured him that he would help. Kyle added that she only needed love, food, and clean diapers.\n\n\nNora anxiously awaited word from Bo as she remained at Rodi's. Matthew was sure that his dad would be fine. He also thought that Schuyler wasn't a bad person, so there was nothing to worry about. Destiny and Dani continued to argue over their possible roles in the high school musical. They attempted to include Matthew in their conversation, but he had already tuned them out as he continued to watch his mother leave messages for his father on the phone.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was at the bar nearby with Todd, and was hopeful that she would hear from Schuyler. Todd pointed out that Schuyler had a gun and was on the run. That didn't sit well with T\u00e9a nor with Roxy, who was within earshot of their conversation, and she announced that Schuyler was her son. Todd thought that Roxy should be cut off from further drinks and reminded her that Rex was her son. Roxy explained that she had heard the news from Allison and, as T\u00e9a heard the details, she believed that what Roxy said was the truth.\n\n\nT\u00e9a explained that Schuyler had a gun, but she assured Roxy that Sierra was safe with Oliver. Roxy rushed from the bar as T\u00e9a remarked that she had no idea why Oliver was the one looking after Sierra. Todd called his paper and told them he had the perfect headline for the next day.\n\n\nAt the cabin, a grief-stricken Schuyler slowly dropped his arm as Bo instructed him to, then suddenly changed his mind and pointed the gun at Rex. Quickly, Bo jumped in front of Rex and took the bullet instead. The backup team rushed into the cabin as Bo slumped to the floor, unconscious. His phone continued to ring as Nora attempted to reach him again. Brody ordered Schuyler to drop the gun and then swiftly, he pushed Schuyler onto the floor and secured the handcuffs.\n\n\nRex and Gigi leaned over Bo and attempted to stop the heavy bleeding while they called his name. Finally, Bo managed to open his eyes for a moment as he muttered, \"Balsom, you owe me one.\" Gigi answered Bo's phone as it began to ring again and gently told Nora that Bo had been shot. As the EMTs wheeled Bo out, Schuyler weakly called out his apologies. Brody punched Schuyler in the stomach to shut him up.\n\n\nAs Layla and Cristian began another heated argument, Oliver and Kyle arrived with the baby. Oliver urged the couple to keep it down, as he needed to get Sierra to bed. The argument was quickly forgotten as Layla began to fawn over the baby, and she and Cristian learned the details of Oliver's new fatherhood. Oliver admitted that he thought the lowest point of his life was when he slept with Stacy, but he had the baby. Layla announced that she would throw a baby shower for Sierra. She suggested that Oliver notify his parents, but the police officer wasn't too sure he wanted to. Just then, Roxy showed up.\n\n\nShe confessed that she had heard the news about the baby from Allison, which confused the others. They tried to figure it out and wondered how Allison would have known that Oliver was Sierra's father. When she heard that fact, Roxy turned and fled. Kyle followed after her and asked what was wrong. A tearful Roxy wouldn't speak to him except to say that she was happy for Oliver.\n\n\nBack inside the apartment, Oliver, Kyle, Cris, and Layla discussed the pros and cons of calling Oliver's parents. Oliver felt that he had more important things to take care of, such as custody of Sierra. He clarified that Schuyler was still listed as the baby's father on the birth certificate, and there was a custody battle going on. Cristian wondered if Oliver was ready to fight Gigi for custody, but Oliver was uncertain of his next move. He assumed that Gigi didn't even know that Oliver had entered the picture. Layla offered to buy baby supplies, but she refused Cristian's offer to take her to the store. She claimed that she wasn't angry at him, but she was too focused on the baby and didn't have time for anything else.\n\n\nAs Gigi finished explaining the news about Bo to Nora, Nora grabbed Matthew, and hastily explained that Bo had been shot and they needed to get to the hospital. Todd and T\u00e9a overheard and T\u00e9a rushed out after them. Todd sauntered over to sit with Dani and Destiny, but they were annoyed at his casual attitude over Bo's predicament. The girls decided they wanted to go to the hospital, and Todd tried to stop them. Dani exclaimed that she didn't have to listen to him, though Todd reminded her that he was her father. Destiny told him off. \"Back up from me, freak show, or we have a problem,\" she shouted.\n\n\nTodd demanded the girls show respect, and Destiny suggested that he had to earn it. She threatened him when he put his hand on her arm, but he convinced them to stay put. His eyes wandered over to Roxy, and he asked for an exclusive from the mother of a murderer. \"Your new son shot Bo Buchanan,\" he told her. She turned and ran out after he tried to bribe her with drinks. He had a new headline for his newspaper.\n\n\nAt the police station, Schuyler was cuffed to a chair. Obviously in shock, he mumbled that the gun had burned his hand and that he had never touched a gun before that time. He continued that he only needed a few more minutes with Gigi. T\u00e9a rushed in and pointed out that her client was injured. Sarcastically, Brody explained that Schuyler had shot Bo and in actuality, people had shown restraint with Schuyler. T\u00e9a asked for privacy to speak to Schuyler alone.\n\n\nUnable to reach Jessica by phone, Brody asked a fellow officer to keep an eye on Schuyler while Brody notified Bo's family. T\u00e9a reassured Schuyler, who muttered that he was afraid Gigi would find out about his life being a lie. He didn't care about jail, and he no longer had a daughter, Schuyler told his attorney. Stacy had lied, too, he continued, and he saw the DNA test that proved that Oliver was Sierra's father. He was very close to getting Gigi back, he maintained. He was indeed his father's son, he said as he laughed. T\u00e9a offered to locate Schuyler's father but Schuyler had some shocking news. He told her that Mitch was his father and had raped his mother, Roxy.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked that a suicide watch be put in place for Schuyler. The cop in charge smirked and asked if they would plead insanity. T\u00e9a angrily advised him that he was responsible for protecting her client. She advised Schuyler that she would work on bail and have him put into a facility for some rest. She explained that he would probably be taken somewhere else, and he was to remain quiet. \"I'm done,\" he uttered but promised to retain his silence. T\u00e9a thought he would be okay, but Schuyler wondered how that was possible. She reminded him that he had saved a baby's life, and she would make sure that no one forgot about it. She left to follow up on Schuyler's hearing.\n\n\nNatalie warned Jessica that Cristian would only take so much from Jessica, and he didn't like being pushed. He would definitely push back. Jessica assured her sister that Natalie would not be the one she went to if there were a problem. She added that she didn't even remember Natalie. Brody interrupted the young women when he arrived and told them that Bo had been shot. The trio headed for the hospital.\n\n\nNora arrived at the hospital with Matthew and saw both Greg and John, but neither was aware of the shooting. Greg went off to check and just then Bo was wheeled in. Nora rushed to his side and touched him gently. As she saw blood on her hand, John put his arms around her as she broke down. Rex and Gigi arrived, and Rex informed John that Bo had taken a bullet for him. Rex suggested that Gigi visit with Sierra, and John mentioned that he had seen her with Oliver. Gigi thanked Rex for his help and headed to Oliver's place.\n\n\nGreg worked over Bo, and suddenly Bo's vital signs began to fail. Greg ordered everyone from the room except for necessary personnel. Matthew confessed that while he had been paralyzed, he had wished for his parents to be hurt like him so they would understand. Nora promised her son that Bo's shooting was not Matthew's fault. Matthew agonized that he had spent a year being angry at his parents. Nora was sure that Bo wouldn't be going anywhere. She and Matthew wrapped their arms around each other.\n\n\nNatalie arrived and saw John. He was there to comfort her again as he enveloped her into a big hug.\n\n\nRex tried to make light of the situation when he encountered Nora and Matthew. Bo would probably be annoyed that they were so upset, he proposed. He wanted to share some news of his own with Nora, but just then Greg invited Nora and Matthew back into the room. Bo had stabilized, and Greg was readying his patient for surgery. They needed to find out the extent of the damage from the bullet, he explained. Suddenly, Bo went into cardiac arrest and Greg called for the crash carts.\n\n\nOliver worried about Gigi's reaction to his new fatherhood status, and Kyle suggested that Oliver invite her over to talk. When there was a knock at the door, they were surprised to see Gigi standing there.\n\n\nRoxy showed up at the police station and stood next to her son. \"Schuyler?\" she said to him tonelessly. He looked up at her wordlessly.\n\n\nDestiny and Dani agreed that Todd had been right when he persuaded them to stay put, since they might have gotten in the way at the hospital. Destiny was sure she wouldn't know what to do if she didn't have her father. Dani glared at Todd sitting at the bar.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Schuyler completely loses it now that he's lost Gigi, baby Sierra and everything. And he accidentally shoots Bo intending to shoot Rex. Bo gets rushed to the hospital OR and everybody is worried. Everybody is ready to nail Schuyler except for Tea who is going to be his lawyer and advocate. Roxy is also stunned now that she's found out that he is her son. Oliver is with Kyle, Cristian and Layla wondering how he's going to handle being the father to baby Sierra. They are all happy that she's there but not certain what to expect. Natalie and Jessica argue about Natalie's issues with John and Jessica's issues with Cristian.",
