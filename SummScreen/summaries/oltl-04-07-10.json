    "soap_central": "\n \nAt Llanview Hospital, Rex waited anxiously outside Bo's exam room.  As Jessica and Brody walked up, they asked for an update, but Rex had no news, other than the single thought on his mind: \"Bo took a bullet for me.\"\n\n\nInside the exam room, Greg worked furiously to save Bo's life after Bo flatlined on the table.  Nora and Matthew were desperate to know what was happening, but Greg ordered them to leave, and called for a crash cart.\n\n\nUpstairs, Marty awoke in her room to find a nurse cleaning up.  She asked if John had gone home, and the nurse explained that John was likely still on the premises, since the commissioner had been shot.  Marty was shocked to hear that Bo had been hurt.\n\n\nBack downstairs, John held Natalie close, and comforted her as she vented her fears for Bo.  Natalie was horrified to see the medical team rush by with a crash cart, and hugged John closer, just in time for Marty to walk into the corridor and see the exes once again in each other's arms.\n\n\nNatalie pulled away from John and apologized to Marty for overstepping, but Marty said it was all right; she understood Natalie was afraid for Bo, and offered her sympathies.  As Natalie rushed over to Rex and the others, John told Marty she needed to get back upstairs.  Marty insisted that Bo, Nora, and Matthew had to be their priority.\n\n\nNatalie approached Rex for word on Bo, but Rex had none to offer.  She asked where Gigi was, and he explained that she'd gone to see Sierra Rose.\n\n\nUpstairs, Hannah entered Marty's room but found only the duty nurse.  Hannah asked the nurse where Marty was, and said she'd been hoping to set up an appointment with the doctor.  The nurse explained that Dr. Saybrooke had an office, but had been admitted for observation.\n\n\nAt Kyle and Oliver's apartment, the new parents faced an awkward moment as they greeted Gigi.  Gigi told Oliver no explanations were necessary; she knew he was Sierra Rose's father.  She explained she'd left Rex at the hospital to see the little girl, and Oliver was stunned to learn that Schuyler had shot Bo.  He concluded that Schuyler had gone over the edge after losing both Gigi and Sierra in rapid succession.  Oliver wanted to go to the hospital to see his boss, but Kyle said he'd call the hospital for news.\n\n\nAfter Kyle checked in with the hospital, Gigi asked the guys if she could hold her niece.  Cradling the baby in her arms, she said she'd missed Sierra terribly since Schuyler had taken custody, and asked Oliver how long he'd known he was the father.  Oliver admitted that he'd suspected for some time, but had been forced to keep Stacy's secret due to her blackmailing Kyle.  Gigi told them she'd have done anything to keep Sierra, and Kyle asked if that meant she intended to fight them for custody.\n\n\nGigi said that her main reason for filing suit had been to keep Sierra from Schuyler, but the little girl was still a part of her heart, no matter who her father was.  Gigi's vague statement troubled Oliver, but the tension in the room broke as Gigi marveled at Sierra's resemblance to Oliver, and they shared a tender moment cooing over the baby.\n\n\nAt the police station, Roxy sat down beside Schuyler and confessed that she was his mother.  \"Yeah, I know,\" he said numbly, \"and you already hate my guts.\"  He asked her why she was there; hours before, she'd been Rex's mother, and had rightly hated Schuyler for destroying Rex, Gigi, and Shane's family by being a party to Stacy's lies.  \"So, please, hate me,\" Schuyler said.  \"Maybe I don't wanna,\" Roxy replied.\n\n\nSchuyler told Roxy he didn't want to make her betray the family she truly cared for, and asked her to get out and forget he was her son.  Roxy said they both had reasons to hate each other, especially him; she should've known that Rex wasn't the child she'd given birth to, because of the birthmark on Schuyler's face.  As she touched the mark on his cheek, she told him that he'd grown up with a wonderful mother, but Leah was gone, and it was time for Roxy to be his mom again.  Schuyler asked her how she could want to be his mother, given what he'd done, and the people he'd hurt.  Roxy said that she was a drunk, and he was an addict; they were both losers, but they were stuck with each other.\n\n\nSchuyler was horrified by his actions on Llantano Mountain, and didn't know how he'd live with himself.  Roxy said what he'd done wasn't okay, but she understood it.  \"I lied to everyone I love to protect what I thought was mine,\" she mused. \"Does that sound familiar to you?\"  She told Schuyler that they were all each other had.  \"And you are flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, and I'm yours,\" Roxy said softly. \"So like it or not, good or bad, we're family.  And I always stick by my family.\"\n\n\nSchuyler was overcome as Roxy embraced him, but accepted her love.  Roxy was pleased at the idea of getting a do-over as a parent, but the term had a darker connotation for Schuyler, who remembered how he'd almost forced Gigi to \"do over\" their relationship at gunpoint.  He had no idea how he'd make up for what he'd done.  A passing officer told Schuyler he'd be arraigned in the morning and would be transported to the cellblock, and Roxy said she'd stay with him.  \"He's my son,\" she explained, \"and I'm his mother.\"\n\n\nAt Llanview University, Starr burst into Ford's office.  She told him that he hadn't answered her calls, so she'd been obliged to pay a visit in order to deliver her message: \"Stop seeing Langston.\"  Ford laughed her demands off and told her his relationship with Langston was not her concern, but Starr said he'd made it her business by having sex at her apartment and making her lie to Cole, whose trust she valued.  Ford doubted Starr and Cole told each other everything, and wasn't buying into Starr's rosy picture of the teens' life together.\n\n\nStarr called Ford a pig who used and abused barely-legal girls as trophies, but Ford said she had no right to judge him; \"You're just some little slut who got herself pregnant in high school!\"  Starr told him he had no concept of her relationship with Cole, and said that they'd conceived Hope out of love, whereas Ford was simply using Langston.  Ford begged to differ; he claimed to respect Langston, and said he was treating her like an adult.  Langston made her own decisions and wasn't a victim, any more than Starr had been when she'd gone after Schuyler Joplin.\n\n\nDisgusted, Starr moved to leave, but Ford continued to mock her.  He asked Starr why his affair with Langston threatened Starr so much, and suggested she was secretly afraid that her and Cole's high school romance was just as vulnerable as Langston and Markko's.  When he needled her about Cole and Hannah, Starr fought back, and told him that Cole and Hannah were only friends.  \"You're as clueless as Markko,\" Ford scoffed.  He reminded her that not everyone got love right on their first try, and asked her how she could be so sure that she and Cole were forever.\n\n\n\"We're done,\" Starr spat, and turned to go.  Ford taunted her and asked if she were afraid of becoming another notch on his belt.  Losing her temper, Starr told him that Langston would eventually wise up and leave him, and he might have all the nubile coeds he wanted, but he'd never know true love.  With that, she stormed out.\n\n\nBack at the teens' apartment, Cole returned home to find Markko at the door, as he waited anxiously for Langston; she wasn't where she said she'd be, and Markko feared the worst.  Cole told him to calm down, but Markko was convinced that Langston was hiding something, and Starr knew the truth.  Cole told Markko that if Starr knew anything about Langston, she would've told him, as \"we don't keep secrets.\"  Markko said he'd tried everything to get Langston to open up, but he felt sure he was losing her.  Cole urged him to relax, talk to Langston, and not act jealous and possessive.\n\n\nCole's words fell on deaf ears as Langston returned home, and Markko shot to his feet.  \"Where were you?\" he demanded.  Defensive, Langston kept her answers vague, and said she'd had enough of the third degree from her boyfriend.  She laced into him for constantly suspecting the worst of her, and not trusting in their love.\n\n\nJust then, Hannah called Cole from the hospital to ask him if his mother were all right.  Cole was shocked to discover that Marty had been hospitalized; he rushed off to see her and left Langston and Markko alone.\n\n\nLangston threw a heavy guilt trip on Markko by telling him she wished they had the kind of trust in their relationship that Starr and Cole possessed.  Then, she trumped his suspicions about her whereabouts by showing him time-stamped phone pictures of her work on the school musical sets.  Markko apologized again for jumping to conclusions, but Langston said she didn't want to talk about it.  Markko begged her to tell him what was bothering her, as he feared they were slipping away from each other.\n\n\nLangston reiterated that she couldn't handle another conversation about their relationship, so Markko made a counter-offer: A round of video games that they both enjoyed.  Langston was touched by the offer and told him so, calling Markko \"a really great guy.\"\n\n\nAs Markko left the room to retrieve the game, Langston got a call from Ford.  Ford explained that Starr had visited his office to pester him about their affair, and asked Langston to head over.  Langston said she couldn't as she was with Markko, but Ford suggested she invent an excuse.  Langston said she couldn't, and didn't want to, then hung up.  Undeterred, Ford promptly made another phone call to Karen, the pizza delivery girl he'd bedded several weeks before.\n\n\nBack at Llanview Hospital, Nora and Matthew emerged from Bo's exam room to greet the crowd of concerned friends and family in the waiting area, with Rex at the head of the line.  As the bereaved comforted each other, Matthew asked about Clint, and Natalie told him she'd make the call to give him the news.  Nora asked Rex about the shooting, and the guilt-ridden young man was forced to explain how Bo had leaped in front of Rex to save Rex's life.\n\n\nJohn and Marty continued bickering about her need for bedrest, with Marty determined to stay on-hand to support Nora and Matthew.  They compromised, and Marty agreed to be taken to her room so long as John returned and watched over Bo.  As she spoke, she failed to notice John's gaze lingering on Natalie across the corridor.\n\n\nNatalie told Brody and Jessica that she'd gotten no answer when she called the mansion, but had left a message for Clint.  The sisters struggled to lift Matthew's spirits, but he was most affected when Brody returned from the vending machine with a soda, just like the one Bo had been giving him quarters for at the police station since he was a kid.  Jessica was noticeably touched by Brody's tenderness.\n\n\nJohn and Marty said their goodbyes and wished Bo well as they headed back upstairs.  Natalie watched with sorrow as John and Marty left, and was surprised to find a sympathetic Jessica at her side.  \"I'm sorry,\" Jessica whispered.\n\n\nUpstairs, Cole arrived at Marty's room and found Hannah waiting.  Upset, he asked where his mother was, but Hannah calmed him by examining Marty's chart.  Glancing at the paper, she concluded that Marty had stepped out but was all right.  Cole thanked Hannah for being there for him, and Hannah said it was the least she could do after all his kindness.  She added how grateful she was that he hadn't told Starr about her overdose.\n\n\nJohn and Marty returned to the room, and Marty assured her son she was fine, but was being kept for observation because her pregnancy had been deemed \"high risk.\"  Cole was concerned, but John said that all that meant was that Marty needed rest and relaxation.  When all eyes turned to Hannah, Hannah introduced herself, and said she'd stopped by looking for Marty because she'd been hoping to see a therapist.  Hannah and Cole were taken aback as the adults informed them that Bo had been shot in the line of duty.\n\n\nAfter the teens left the room, Marty comforted the brooding John, and told him he couldn't blame himself for not being there when Bo was shot.  John said he'd been exactly where he was supposed to be: at home, preparing for the mother of his child to move in with him.  Touched, Marty snuggled up next to him in her hospital bed.\n\n\nOutside Marty's room, Cole told Hannah he was glad she was seeking help, but he remained shaken by the news about Bo.  Hannah gave him a hug, just in time for Starr to walk into the hallway and see the two together.\n\n\nStarr greeted Cole and Hannah, who seethed as she watched the couple reunite.  Hannah quickly said goodbye and walked out, while Starr and Cole compared notes.  Cole told Starr he felt guilty about divulging Hannah's secret to her, but he knew he'd had to, as Starr was always honest with him.  Starr kept mum, but her eyes were pained.\n\n\nDownstairs, Greg was racing against time to save Bo's life, and used defibrillator pads to shock him back from the brink.  Watching from behind the glass outside the exam room, Nora was hysterical, and fell into Rex's arms after he told her Bo was a hero.  \"That's just the kind of guy he is,\" she sobbed.\n\n\nGreg emerged from the exam room, and told the crowd that Bo had stabilized, but was being prepped for surgery, and there were no guarantees.\n\n\nNora rushed into the room to see Bo and cradled him in her arms.  She told him she wouldn't lose him after they'd found each other again, and Bo whispered for her not to worry.  He asked her to let Matthew in.  \"I want to see him before I go,\" he croaked, and Nora was struck by the finality of his words.\n\n\nMatthew and Rex entered the room, and Matthew struggled to keep his composure at his father's bedside.  Bo told Matthew he'd be fine, but Matthew was still choked up.  He said he'd thought up a whole speech, lots of things to say, but all he could manage to get out was, \"I love you,\" and kissed Bo's cheek.\n\n\nRex approached Bo's bed, and was unable to find the words to thank Bo for what he'd done.  Bo grabbed Rex's hand and pulled his surrogate son close to him.  He whispered to Rex that if he'd to take the bullet once more, \"I'd do it again.\"\n\n\nA musical montage began as all across Llanview, various scenes played out.  Langston and Markko enjoyed a video game together, while Hannah watched in despair as Starr and Cole left the hospital floor.  Brody updated John on Bo's \"touch and go\" condition, and John ended the call and curled up with Marty on her hospital bed.  As Bo was wheeled out and taken to the operating room, his friends and family watched helplessly.  Jessica impulsively drew close to Brody, while a heartbroken Nora clutched Matthew and Rex to her chest. \n\n\n",
