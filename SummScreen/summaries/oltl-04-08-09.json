Rachel told Nora that she'd put work and a boyfriend in Chicago aside to be with her mother and her brother in their time of need. \n\n\nWhile Hank paid a visit to Bo and Matthew, Nora and Rachel had a mother-daughter talk. Rachel encouraged Nora to lean on her and begin to take care of herself, in order to better help Matthew. Nora told Rachel she was still wrestling with her conflicted emotions toward Cole. She said she blamed him for what had happened, but also saw him as she'd seen Rachel during her drug addiction, as a young person in need of help. Rachel asked if Cole was clean yet and warned Nora that the rehab facility's rules might not prevent him from relapsing. \n\n\nNora said she didn't have the time to tend to Cole, given Matthew's condition, and she feared Marty wouldn't, either. Rachel said that was why she was there. She asked about Clint, and Nora said she and Clint were having trouble communicating, and she didn't know how to fix it. As Hank returned from visiting with Matthew, Nora thanked her loved ones for going to her aid. Rachel assured Nora that they were still a strong family who could take on anything. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian and Ray's impulsive kiss ended as Jack sneaked in and took a cell phone picture of them in a clinch. Jack told them he knew a cheating spouse when he saw one, and threatened to call David and send him the picture unless Dorian helped him get John out of the house and reunite Jack with Todd. Ray defused Jack's blackmail attempt by intimidating him with a harrowing prison anecdote about the last man who'd tried to blackmail a Montez -- and ended up in the prison incinerator. Cowed, Jack backed down and gave Dorian back her phone then scampered off. \n\n\nDorian thanked Ray for his help and for comforting her during trying times with Blair, Todd, and David. Ray told her he hadn't kissed her because he'd felt sorry for her. He said he knew that in a difficult situation, even the strongest woman would need the support of a man she loved. \n\n\nIn the foyer, Starr and Langston returned home and began another heated conversation about Schuyler. Starr blamed Cole for messing things up between her and \"Mr. J\" and told a skeptical Langston that Blair supported her pursuing her teacher, neglecting to mention that she had left out several crucial details when she had spoken to her mother. Starr told Langston that her relationship with Schuyler was no mere crush and claimed that they had been ready to take things to the next level before Cole had interrupted them. Langston wanted to be supportive of her friend but was stunned when Starr explained that she planned to wait to be with Schuyler until she graduated. She asked if Starr was using Mr. Joplin to try to get over the loss of Cole, but Starr denied it. \n\n\nAs Jack stormed out of the drawing room, he overturned the mail on the end table in a fury and told Langston that her uncle was \"a horse's butt.\" After Jack ran upstairs, Starr and Langston began to sort through the mail, only to find a letter to Blair from Llanview High. Starr was horrified to learn that the school was pursuing disciplinary action against Schuyler and was contacting Todd because they had yet to receive a response from Blair. Starr raced out to try to intercept Todd before he could learn of her dalliance with Schuyler. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, Dorian stared pensively at the cell phone picture of her kiss with Ray. Langston entered, hoping to vent to her foster mom about Starr, but froze when she saw the image on Dorian's phone. \n\n\nOver at Todd's, Talia and Fish questioned Todd about Zach Rosen and his visit to the Sun. Todd asked if Zach was the prime suspect in the serial murder case, and Talia reminded him that he was still on the list of suspects himself. Todd threw the cops out but was unaware of Zach lurking outside. \n\n\nAs Todd toyed with a safe in his study, Zach crept closer to entering the house. The doorbell interrupted Todd's work, and when he answered, he found a drug-addled Cole, who was ready to pick another fight. As Todd and Cole moved into the living room, Zach entered through the front door. \n\n\nTodd assumed that Cole was there to unload on him about Marty again, but Cole told him it was something different: Starr's teacher was \"trying to get into her pants.\" Todd's ears perked up at the mention of Schuyler Joplin's name, and as Cole told Todd about what he'd seen at the dance and then at the Angel Square Hotel, the absentee father became enraged. Todd rushed out, and told Cole to lock up when he left. \n\n\nAs Cole prepared to leave, he ran smack into Zach. When Cole asked who he was, Zach identified himself and called Marty the \"bitch\" who'd put him in prison. Enraged, Cole charged Zach, only to knock himself out when they hit the floor. \n\n\nSomewhere across town, John kicked the door in on Zach Rosen's darkened, dilapidated motel room. As John tossed the room for clues, he found numerous newspapers full of headlines about Todd, Marty, and the murders. He made an anonymous call to the cops about a breaking and entering at the motel and waited until Talia and Fish arrived on the scene. \n\n\nThe officers were surprised that John had taken to petty crime, but Talia soon realized John had staged the break-in in order to give the Llanview Police Department \"probable cause\" to search Rosen's room for clues. Talia told John to leave while the police combed the scene and said they would grab Zach when he returned. John warned Talia to be careful and said that if Zach were their culprit, he was growing bolder and more dangerous. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Blair had a visitor in the ICU: Marty, bearing tulips. As Marty and Blair made awkward small talk about her marriage, Blair flashed her wedding ring and coolly assured Marty that her new life as Mrs. John McBain was about more than her children. When Marty questioned Blair for details about the night of her attack, Blair's interest was piqued. Marty explained that there was a murderer on the loose, and they were all in danger, yet Blair doubted Marty cared much for her welfare. Through trading barbs, Marty told Blair to get well soon and breezily told her there'd be no hard feelings about the time she'd run to the press and called Marty a psychotic killer. \n\n\nAs Marty exited, John walked up to Blair's room. John was concerned that Blair was ill, but Marty assured him she'd only been visiting and that \"she's still the same Blair we know and love.\" John warned Marty that Zach had paid a visit to Todd and told her she needed a police security detail. He felt sure that Zach was out for revenge against anyone who had wronged him and anyone they might care about. \n\n\nSchuyler returned home and found Starr's letter on the ground. At first, he tossed it in the trash, but his curiosity got the better of him, and he began to read. In her letter, Starr told Schuyler that she'd felt something for him since the moment they'd met and insisted that he'd felt it, too, as she'd stripped for him. Starr promised to wait for Schuyler, and asked him to wait for her. \n\n\nMortified, Schuyler resolved to write a letter of his own back to Starr. He made it as far as \"Dear Starr\" before deciding it was a bad idea and tossing the paper aside, only for it to hit Todd, who barged in without warning. Schuyler instantly recognized Todd. Fearful, he told Todd not to look at the paper, but Todd read it anyway then glowered menacingly at the young man. \n\n\nBack at Todd's, Zach picked himself up off the floor, leering at the unconscious Cole, brandishing a knife as he wondered what he could do to Marty's son that would hurt her the most. Just then, Starr rushed in, calling out for Todd. As she entered the living room, she met face to face with Zach. \"Twinkle, twinkle, little Starr!\" Zach sneered.\n\n\n",
