    "soap_central": "\n \nRex perused the Sun's latest headline, \"Curtains for the Commish?\" as friends and family waited anxiously at the hospital for news on Bo's surgery. A worried Nora remained silent when Clint showed up, but she was quickly distracted when Greg arrived with an update. He announced that Bo had lost a lot of blood but would be okay if he made it through the next few hours by breathing on his own.\n\n\nClint thanked Natalie for getting hold of him. After he heard her explanation of the shooting, Clint noted that it all sounded just like Bo. \"Damn fool,\" he added. He admitted that his phone had been turned off earlier because he and Kim had split up. He made it clear that Kim had \"come clean\" about cheating on him, so she definitely hadn't married him for the money. Natalie was sorry she had been so tough on her dad. At the moment, however, Clint was only concerned for his brother.\n\n\nRoxy arrived and told Rex and Gigi that she had more news. The results of a DNA test proved that she wasn't Rex's mother. She described the chain of events that had occurred to allow her to end up with Rex when he was born. She alluded to the fact that her real son was alive but she didn't want to discuss it until some future time. Rex and Gigi pressed her and she finally admitted that Schuyler was her real son. The couple was shocked and more so when Roxy indicated that she needed to hasten to Schuyler's arraignment. Rex wanted to understand why, and she summed it up briefly. She was Schuyler's mother.\n\n\nRex was not happy to hear of Roxy's decision and reminded her of all that Schuyler had done to hurt people, plus, he added, she hated Schuyler. Roxy attempted to explain that it was about her and being someone's mother. She \"blew it\" with Rex and Natalie, and there was a chance for her to have a \"do-over.\" She was all that Schuyler had.\n\n\nGigi advised Rex that she wanted to attend Sierra's custody hearing because the little girl was still her niece. Rex asked if she wanted to take the baby away from Oliver and Kyle, and Gigi admitted that it sounded bad when Rex put it that way. She wasn't sure what she wanted to do. Rex thanked her for being there for him.\n\n\nMatthew and Nora headed to Bo's room to stay by his side. Nora spoke to her unconscious partner first and quietly pleaded with him to return. Matthew reminded his father of how Matthew had behaved when he had his own injury and the fact that he had never thanked Bo for all Bo had done. Matthew felt guilty that he had made Bo look like the culprit, and Matthew wanted the chance to make things up to him. Clint stood silently by the door and finally walked in slowly. He indicated that he was concerned about Matthew.\n\n\nMatthew assured his uncle that Bo would love to hear Clint's voice, even if Clint was still angry at Bo. Clint moved to Bo's bedside and began to talk to his brother. He admitted that while he had threatened to shoot Bo recently, he couldn't begin to imagine a world without his brother. He acknowledged that Bo and Nora back together was \"in the cards\" and everyone should have realized it. He needed to get angry at someone and Bo was his target, since they would always have plenty of time to get over it. Clint thought there had been lots of time to be brothers.\n\n\nClint wanted his brother to know there was a \"hole in the family\" without Bo, and they all needed and loved him. Nora stood nearby, crying quietly. After Clint left the room, Nora stood next to Bo again and leaned over the bed to talk to him. She asked him if he had heard what Clint said. They could all be a family again, and Bo still had a brother.\n\n\nNatalie comforted her father after he left Bo's room. Clint wanted another chance to make things right between them, he admitted to her. Rex was the next person to visit with Bo, and he told his father figure that it was supposed to have been Rex who was shot. He explained that Roxy wasn't his mother, but Schuyler's mother, and he had no idea if Mitch was still his own father or not. He wondered why he told Bo all of that but thought it was because Bo always knew what to say and how to make sense of it all. \"I don't have a prayer of doing this without you. You saved my life,\" a tearful Rex told the unconscious police commissioner. He asked Bo to return to all of them.\n\n\nNora thanked Clint for visiting and saying what he did. Natalie and Rex remembered when they were children and alone because Roxy was always drunk. They grabbed hands and recited a prayer they used to say. Nora returned to Bo's room and told him that many people were lost without him. There was an abundance of love. Suddenly, Bo opened his eyes.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived in court as Schuyler's handcuffs were removed. She advised the police officers that she was sure they had treated her client with the \"utmost care and respect\" during his incarceration. Schuyler wanted news of Bo, but T\u00e9a had nothing new to report. She hoped that Bo would make it so that Schuyler wouldn't face murder charges. Schuyler was worried about Gigi and Sierra and also wondered why T\u00e9a was helping him. T\u00e9a urged him to focus on himself and reminded him that everyone was entitled to a defense. He thought that Roxy might show up for support, but he had told her to forget he was her son, he rationalized to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nHe thought that there was no defense for what he did, so he wanted to know why they should even bother with anything. T\u00e9a informed him that she was planning on pleading temporary insanity so that he wouldn't go to jail-especially not for life if Bo died. She asked if Schuyler had known what he was doing and told him he was an addict who needed help. T\u00e9a assured Schuyler that there were people who cared about him like herself and Rachel. \"Don't forget me,\" Roxy said as she turned up behind them. The judge read out the charges against Schuyler, and T\u00e9a pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The judge asked if Schuyler agreed with the plea. Roxy urged him to \"go for it.\" Gigi walked in and startled Schuyler.\n\n\nA livid Todd showed up at Starr's place and demanded that Langston rewrite the part about the jackass, based on him, in her musical. He wanted to comprehend if it were Langston's fantasy to show up on magazine covers and have her name in lights due to her musical. He had given lots of money to the school, and he vowed to shut her show down. He accused her of character assassination. \"Go ahead Dad, make yourself look worse than you did back then,\" Starr stated as she stepped into the room. She challenged Todd and asked if anything that Langston had written was untrue. Todd suggested that while some of it was true, much of what happened had been based on provocation or had been accidental.\n\n\nStarr proposed that Todd buy a ticket and sit in the first row so that he could see his mistakes and how difficult it had been for her to live through them. He stated that he had made his mistakes because he loved her, and Starr admitted that while she loved him, too, it didn't change what had happened. While things had all worked out, Starr thought he should want to see the past so that he could change the future and not make the same mistakes with Dani. Todd agreed that the show could go on and advised Langston that she could thank Starr for saving it. After he left, Langston advised Starr that it was appropriate for Starr to save the show, since Starr owed her after Starr had gone to talk to Ford behind her back.\n\n\nStarr explained that Langston was her friend and she cared about her. Langston thought Starr's move was all \"so high school,\" but Starr reminded her that they were in high school. Langston attempted to point out that it was similar to the way Starr had acted with Schuyler, but Starr quickly noted that she didn't have sex with him and Schuyler had known that Starr had acted young and crazy. Langston thought that Starr considered her clueless.\n\n\nStarr felt that Langston made little sense when she spoke about Ford, and Langston snapped that Starr probably thought Langston was an idiot. Starr denied that and admitted that she really didn't know Ford. Starr placated Langston and agreed that Ford was probably exciting and had lots to offer, but she thought that Langston loved Markko and didn't want to lose him. While she wasn't judging, she thought that Langston was stuck. She also hated hiding things from Cole.\n\n\nStarr revealed that Ford had called Starr a \"teenage slut,\" and he told her that Cole was probably throwing himself at Hannah. He told her that he didn't think of Langston as a girl but as a woman, and he ordered Starr to stay out of his affairs. Starr confessed that she had asked Ford about his feelings for Langston, but he never answered her. Langston believed that most guys didn't like to advertise but she saw the way that Ford had looked at her, and it was different from the way he looked at Hannah.\n\n\nLangston assured Starr that Langston and Markko would always have a connection and she loved him, but she hadn't told him the truth in a long while. He would never speak to her again if he knew how much she had lied to him. She admitted that she had treated him badly the night before when he had been suspicious of her. She believed that he knew something was wrong and he was trying to trap her.\n\n\nStarr was appalled that Langston thought Markko would set a trap when he loved her. Langston wished Markko would be mean to her because she felt guiltier as time went on. Starr thought that Langston wasn't making sense, and she urged her girlfriend to end it immediately. Langston suddenly agreed that she would break up with \"him\" that day. \"Thank God,\" Starr shouted out. She noted that Ford didn't deserve Langston anyway. Langston corrected Starr. She was planning on breaking up with Markko.\n\n\nElijah was busy cooking breakfast in his pajama bottoms at La Boulaie and thought that it was Blair who sneaked up behind him. It was Kelly in a nightgown and the pair introduced themselves to each other. \"You must be Blair's new friend,\" Kelly said to him. As they tussled over the spatula and the burned eggs, Blair arrived and ordered Kelly to get her hands off of Elijah's spatula. Kelly wondered why Blair felt so threatened, and Blair's response was that Kelly was always after what Blair had or what Blair didn't want any longer. Elijah stood there helplessly and finally stopped the bickering.\n\n\nHe assured Blair that Kelly wasn't making a play for him and, besides, he only \"had eyes\" for Blair. She refused to let the issue drop and stated that Kelly had \"man issues,\" and she always made a fool out of herself. Kelly chimed in and asked if Blair had ever heard the statement about the \"pot and the kettle.\" Just then, there was a knock at the door and it was Todd, whose eyes lit up when he saw Kelly and Elijah in nightwear. \"Threesome?\" he inquired. He was there to see Kelly and an annoyed Blair suggested that Sun business be conducted at the office. Todd assured her he was there for personal reasons.\n\n\nBlair and Todd started their usual bickering, but Elijah promptly pulled Blair aside and kissed her. Blair overheard that Todd was working on Kelly's case and she accused Todd of helping in order to obtain a \"gory headline\" for his newspaper. Todd quickly assured Blair that he was involved because Kelly had been upset, which caused Blair to frown. Todd disclosed that the two calls from the unknown party had been made from the home where Melinda had resided. Kelly wanted to call John immediately to tell him the news.\n\n\nTodd had already helped Kelly and he was disturbed that she would turn to John. Kelly reminded him that it was John's job and the police should be aware of what was going on. Todd insisted that he would be able to get answers more quickly than John. Blair chimed in again and advised Kelly that John wasn't about to drop everything for Kelly, but Blair received another shock when Kelly mentioned Marty's pregnancy. Elijah looked at Blair's face and hoped that Blair wouldn't carry torches for all of the men from her previous relationships.\n\n\nBlair stressed that she hated Marty more than anyone else, and she wished it were someone else. Elijah asked how she felt about Kelly. Blair looked at Elijah confusedly but told him that she had learned her lesson previously when Elijah had given her an ultimatum. She wouldn't repeat it. Elijah agreed that he was fine with history as long as that was what it remained. Blair teased him about his own history and jokingly threatened to delve into it. Kelly assured Todd that she wanted John on the case and there was nothing Todd could do about it.\n\n\nMarty and John returned to John's rooms at the Angel Square Hotel and John enlightened Marty on his attempts to clean up for her. They were interrupted when John's phone rang, and after John was finished, he explained that it was regarding the death of Kelly's mother. He gave Marty the details and the fact he had just learned that the two calls Kelly had received had been made from within the facility where Melinda had lived. Todd had also had his own private investigators checking things out. Marty realized that John would have to fly to California for more information, but John indicated that he would not go. He clarified that he needed to stay where he was to keep an eye on Marty and their baby. Marty refused to hear of it.\n\n\nJohn teased Marty for ordering him around so soon, but she counseled that it was his job to investigate for Kelly, he was the best at what he did, and he loved it. Marty wondered why Kelly would have gone to Todd for help in the investigation, and John figured maybe Todd had volunteered. Marty felt that it was more reason for John to take over so that Kelly wouldn't be involved with Todd too deeply. John made Marty promise to call him if there were any problems that arose while he was gone. Marty advised him not to worry and teased that she could begin to redecorate while John was gone.\n\n\nKelly wanted to know what Todd's issue was with John, and Todd grimaced that he didn't know where to start. He wanted Kelly to cancel John's involvement as there wasn't room for both of them. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door, and Todd was aggravated when he opened it and saw John standing there.\n\n\n",
