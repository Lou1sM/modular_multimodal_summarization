Clint called Dorian and thanked her for a great date, and suddenly Nash was in his living room asking for his help. At the diner, Carlotta was thrilled to hear about the adoption hearing that was schedule for that afternoon. Marcie told Michael that she was put in charge of the school musical, Oklahoma!, which had coincidentally always been her favorite. Blair tried to butter up Starr with breakfast and apologized for not being there for her daughter when she was breaking up with Cole. Layla showed up at Evangeline's door just as she was leaving for Chicago, then recalled how much fun they had in Chicago when a former client of Evangeline took them all over town. Todd soon followed to plead with Vange not to go to Chicago with him. \n\n\nJessica looked as though she were about to lose her lunch as Antonio rubbed her shoulders and beamed about the adoption. Jess requested a moment to \"pull herself together\" while Antonio went to talk with his mom. Carlotta seemed to notice that something was off with Jessica, who quickly bolted so as to evade further scrutiny. \n\n\nClint was less than thrilled about Nash's impromptu visit and stated that Jessica's life was no business of Nash's. Clint seemed surprised to hear the adoption was happening so soon, but reminded Nash that Antonio is Jessica's husband and adopting Jamie is the next logical step. As Nash continued to bug Clint about helping Jessica see what she was doing \u2014 adopting Jamie to cover up her true feelings for Nash \u2014 Clint wasn't having any of it. Clint advised Nash to do the right thing and step aside. Jessica walked in and wasn't happy to see Nash there with her dad. Clint left the two of them alone to talk. \n\n\nTodd tried to convince Evangeline that it wasn't smart for her to go to Chicago with him. Layla agreed, arguing that she'd either get hurt by him or get hurt somehow on the trip. Evangeline told her sister to butt out, but Todd reiterated that he wouldn't allow Vange to put herself in danger. \n\n\nTate explained that he came by to share some exciting news. Rex joked that he's getting a stadium named after him! No, said Tate, he's been offered a job as a sportscaster for channel 7. \"LLANVIEW LIVE!?!\" screamed Adriana, as though it were MTV's TOTAL REQUEST LIVE. Tate gave Adriana a hug, practically giving Rex a coronary. When Adriana went off to take a phone call, Rex advised Tate to back off his girl. Tate said he could see why Rex is concerned, goading Rex into attacking him and making Tate look like the innocent party. As Adriana scolded Rex, Layla burst in to announce that Todd had a lead on his missing son. Rex was immediately concerned, asking Layla to keep an eye on Tate and Adriana while he went off to deal with Todd. Adriana told Tate that she blabbed to Rex about his interest in her, and Tate said it was no wonder Rex attacked him. \n\n\nBlair told Starr how proud she was that she broke up with Cole to stop their families' sparring. Blair asked Starr to go easy on her father because he's been dealing with the loss of TJ and then revealed that TJ might actually be alive. Jack listened in from the doorway and overheard Blair tell Starr that their dad was going off to Chicago to look for his son and that Evangeline would be joining him. As soon as Starr left for school, a concerned Jack asked Blair if Todd was going to marry \"Miss Williamson\" and start a new family. Blair explained that nothing was going to happen between Todd and Evangeline and that his love for Starr and Jack was secure. \n\n\nAs Todd begged Evangeline not to jeopardize her career for him, Rex showed up and told Todd that he had to talk to him about his son. Todd explained that he got a clue from Spencer via Miles. Rex offered to go to Chicago for him, but Todd insisted on doing it alone. Evangeline tried to play the Blair card, but Todd said he didn't care what Blair thought either \u2014 he is going to Chicago and no one can stop him. Meanwhile, Marcie told a pensive Michael how she wished she'd had Tommy from the beginning. \n\n\nAntonio's mami brought him breakfast, while he pushed it away, saying he was too nervous to eat. Carlotta asked if everything was okay with Jessica and Antonio. He admitted that things weren't the same since Tess. Meanwhile, Jessica yelled at Nash, reminding him of Tess. Nash explained that he was talking to Clint because he doesn't have a father of his own. He tried to get her to admit that she wishes she'd chosen Nash over Antonio and that the impending adoption is causing her to realize that more and more.\n\n\nAdriana seemed distracted as Layla talked about Rex running off to help Todd. Rex rushed into the diner and asked to speak with Michael right away. As Todd's plane prepared for takeoff, a stewardess two rows back told Blair to buckle up. \n\n\n",
