She decided to let Pamela keep on talking so that she could dig herself a deeper hole. Eventually, Natalie had enough and stopped Pamela in her deceptions. She demanded to know what Pamela hoped to gain by helping Jared. Pamela wasn't intimidated. She reminded Natalie of her own humble beginnings and less-than-honorable entrance into the Buchanan family. Natalie pointed out that, unlike Jared, she was a real Buchanan. Eventually, Pamela admitted that her brother was Jared's stepfather. She went on to reveal that her brother was a brutal man who abused his wife and stepchildren. Jared had a very difficult time growing up. Things got worse for Jared after his little brother, Jimmy, was killed. Natalie was stunned to learn that Jared had a brother who had died. The hostility eased out of Natalie as she listened to Pamela talk about Jared and what drove him. \n\n\nClint had a meeting with Calvin Jenkins who made it very clear that he intended to wrest control of Buchanan Enterprises in a hostile takeover. \n\n\nRex stopped by B.E. on business. He glanced in as he passed by the conference room and noticed that Shane was sitting in a chair looking bored. Rex decided to visit with his young friend for a few minutes. As they chatted, Rex revealed that he knew Shane had recently celebrated a birthday. He then asked Shane what he had wished for on his birthday. Shane hesitated answering as he had a flashback of his birthday and wishing for a father. Gigi walked in before Shane could answer Rex. She was instantly on edge and blurted out that Rex couldn't give Shane what he wished for. Rex bragged about his resourcefulness and pushed for an answer. Gigi quickly shooed Shane out of the room in an effort to put an end to the birthday wish talk. After Shane left, the conversation switched to Jared. Rex asked Gigi if there was something going on between her and Jared. Gigi said that there wasn't but she was curious why Rex was suddenly so interested in her love life. Just then Shane returned to the conference room and announced that it was time for him to go to school. Rex offered to drop him off. Gigi reluctantly agreed and watched as Rex and Shane headed to the elevator. \n\n\nA short time later, Gigi walked into Jared's office. She became uncomfortable and very defensive when the subject of Rex came up. She denied having any feelings for Rex but she protested just a tad too much. Jared realized that Gigi was far from indifferent to Rex. \n\n\nViki woke Charlie up from a disturbing nightmare. Sensing that he was still rattled by the troubling dream, Viki urged Charlie to talk about it. She listened quietly as Charlie slowly began talking about his past failures as an alcoholic husband and father and the pain his put his children through. As he spoke about the past, he opened up about the heartbreaking loss of his youngest son, Jimmy, in a tragic accident. Charlie also told Viki that his other son carried around a tremendous amount of guilt over his little brother's death. Charlie admitted that he continued to blame himself for what happened to his sons because he wasn't there for them when they needed him most. Viki tried to offer Charlie comfort and understanding. She praised Charlie for trying to build a relationship with Rex. At the mention of Rex's name, Charlie told her that he had plans to meet him later for breakfast. \n\n\nThe dream continued to nag Charlie when he met up with Rex at the Palace Hotel for breakfast. Rex sensed Charlie's melancholy mood and asked Charlie what was troubling him but Charlie remained tight-lipped. He insisted that he needed to work it out for himself. After Rex left, Charlie called Jared and asked him to meet him at the Palace Hotel. When Jared arrived, Charlie tried talking about Jimmy. Jared was reluctant to discuss it. Charlie was undeterred, though. Unfortunately, someone nearby had caught Jared's attention. It was Pamela. Jared was surprised to see her and momentarily excused himself from Charlie to say hello. Charlie and Jared were both surprised when Pamela introduced herself to Charlie as Jared's mother! \n\n\nLindsay and Dorian also met at the Palace Hotel restaurant. While the two ladies were chatting, Lindsay inadvertently let it slip that she had recently helped Clint prevent a takeover of B.E. She swore Dorian to secrecy and unwisely trusted her friend to keep her word. The moment Lindsay walked away, Dorian made arrangements to meet with Calvin Jenkins, her business partner. \n\n\nViki stopped by B.E. to talk to Clint. While she was there, she took the opportunity to see Gigi. Gigi had forgotten her wallet at home that morning and Viki wanted to make sure Gigi had it in the event that she needed it. Gigi was thankful but felt terrible for continuing to impose on Viki's generosity. She promised Viki that she intended to move out shortly. Viki was disappointed to hear that. She confessed that she enjoyed having a house full of people and wasn't eager to see Gigi and Shane move out. After leaving Gigi to return to her work, Viki sought out Clint. She wanted to show him an unsavory article that Todd intended to run in the next edition of The Sun. She was stunned when Clint admitted that the allegations made in the article were true. Viki couldn't believe that Clint would actually resort to using personal threats to deal with business problems. Clint explained that he had to do what was necessary to protect his family and the business from a takeover. Shortly after Viki left, Clint called Lindsay. The moment Lindsay stepped into Clint's office he asked her to dig up all the dirt that she could on Calvin Jenkins. \n\n\n",
