Dorian's insistence that it was not what it looked like gave way to her attempt to change the subject. Langston fell for neither and wanted to know what had happened to change Dorian's prior feelings of hate for the man. \n\n\nDorian explained that she was merely tolerating Ray, since Langston had wanted him to stay in town. Dorian's weak excuse that she was married to David did not fool Langston, who felt that the kiss had been real. She asked if her aunt and uncle were having an affair. Dorian explained that Jack had caught the kiss and had tried to blackmail her into letting him be with his dad. The women wondered if the boy would be like Todd when he was older. \n\n\nTurning back to the photo, Langston asked if Ray was a good kisser. Dorian quickly shouted out that \"it was not like that.\" It had just happened, she explained. Not willing to discuss it any further, Dorian gave in when Langston accused her aunt of only wanting an open and honest relationship when it didn't apply to herself. Dorian insisted that the subject matter wasn't appropriate, but Langston thought that kissing Ray fell into the same category. Dorian admitted that she would have normally discussed things with Blair. \n\n\nSmiling, Langston informed her aunt that Dorian couldn't fight chemistry. She wanted to know why Dorian hadn't deleted the picture from the phone. She figured that David would either rush home if he saw the picture or tell Dorian to go to hell. She wondered what Dorian really wanted but hoped she would be happy like Langston was. \n\n\nRay and Lola settled in for dinner at the caf\u00e9, but it became apparent to Ray that his daughter was flirting with Markko. When he wondered if anything was happening between the pair, Lola told him that something had indeed happened and would again if she had anything to say about it. A perturbed Ray noted how uncomfortable Markko looked and reminded his daughter that he was her cousin's boyfriend. He wondered what had happened to the nice girl he had known his daughter to be. \n\n\nInsisting that she knew how Markko really felt, Lola informed her dad that the young man wanted her, otherwise he would have told Langston about Lola's kiss. Ray believed that Markko merely wanted to protect Langston from finding out what her cousin had done. Lola wanted to know about her dad kissing Dorian. \n\n\nRay gruffly stated that they were talking about Lola. He reminded her that he had stayed in the country because Lola had wanted to stay. He ordered her to not only stop going after her cousin's boyfriend but to march herself into the kitchen and apologize to Markko for her actions. She timidly agreed to stop and leave Markko alone but wanted to know what her father's plans were regarding Dorian. \n\n\nStating that David was not around and that Dorian didn't love him, anyway, Ray reacted strongly when Lola muttered that Dorian had married David. Jumping up, he left the restaurant hastily but not before reminding Lola to make the clean break with Markko. \n\n\nT\u00e9a paid a visit to Llanfair to talk to Viki about Todd's latest infuriating move. Viki was hardly surprised to hear that Todd had offered himself to T\u00e9a in exchange for her admitting to the judge that John and Blair's marriage was a farce. T\u00e9a wondered out loud if Todd really believed she'd throw her career away for him. \n\n\nViki reasoned that T\u00e9a was so upset because she had actually considered Todd's offer. A dejected-looking T\u00e9a wondered what was wrong with her as Viki assured her that she was not the first woman to fall for the wrong man. T\u00e9a knew in her head that Todd's offer was horrible and that he was merely a \"manipulating narcissist.\" However, her heart felt otherwise and longed for the excitement and the feeling alive that a relationship with Todd gave her. \n\n\n\"Sometimes, the heart just wants what it wants,\" declared Dorian to Langston, Lola to Ray, and Viki to Tea. \n\n\nFixing her lip gloss, Lola arose and headed to the kitchen, informing Markko that she had something to tell him. A furious Markko didn't want to hear it and cut her short, reminding her that he was with Langston. As she kept talking, Lola revealed that she had promised her father she would let Markko go. Before Markko could be too happy, she added that she had lied. Langston made her way through the caf\u00e9. \n\n\nViki suggested that T\u00e9a find someone else who would help her get over Todd. Admitting that she had gone out with Ray but had no feelings for him, T\u00e9a expressed her gratitude for Viki's friendship. Viki admitted that her feelings for Todd were similar to Tea's. She was angry at him but loved him the same, especially knowing about his horrid childhood. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Todd glowered at Schuyler after reading the letter the young man had just begun writing to Starr. Todd accused the teacher of being a pervert for writing a love letter. Schuyler attempted to explain that nothing had happened between himself and Starr and that he had not been writing a love letter but telling her that nothing could happen between them as she wanted. Todd was livid that the blame was being placed on Starr. \n\n\nSchuyler turned the tables and accused Todd of being responsible for Schuyler's mother's death, though Todd quickly responded that he had never laid a hand on Dr. Joplin. Schuyler blamed her suicide on Todd's plan and the chain of events that had led to Hope's death. Todd threatened to send Schuyler to prison for his moves on Starr, though the young man insisted he had never touched Starr or crossed the line. Todd wondered exactly what line Schuyler was talking about. \n\n\nThe teacher retorted that Todd had left lines in the dust when he had blackmailed Schuyler's mother. He thought that if Todd liked letters so much, he had a letter from his mom that recounted Todd's entire baby-snatching plot. Todd informed Schuyler that he already knew that the letter had been burned. He blamed Schuyler for going after Starr because of what Todd had done to Dr. Joplin. Schuyler denied that. Todd announced that anyone who hurt his daughter would not live to tell about it. \n\n\nCalling Todd a sick man, Schuyler shouted that Starr had been hurting and had needed someone to talk to. He had confided in her, as well, and regretted that he had said as much as he had. Again, he insisted that nothing had happened. Todd wondered why, if that were the case, Cole had gone to tell him that Starr had left the teacher's room, looking like she had been getting dressed and that Schuyler had looked the same. Schuyler explained that Starr had shown up, but he had told her that nothing would happen. \n\n\nTodd sneered, \"Like nothing happened at the dance?\" Schuyler maintained that Starr had kissed him, he had stopped it, and he had been put on leave. Todd advised Schuyler that for molesting Starr, worse things would happen. He pointed out what had happened to Cole when Todd had found him in bed with Starr. Schuyler realized why Starr was so \"messed up\" and kept falling in love with the wrong guy. It was all due to Todd, he shouted. It was Todd's fault if someone took advantage, he emphasized. \n\n\nEncountering Zach at her dad's place, Starr wondered if she knew the man who apparently knew her. Zach introduced himself as Carl Swift, a friend of her father's. An unsuspecting Starr explained that she was there to check her father's mail, looking for a letter that she didn't want him to see. She added that she was no longer a little girl but all grown up. Zach quickly responded that he could obviously see that was true. \n\n\nStarr explained her situation with an older man as Zach exclaimed what a beautiful young woman Starr had become. He figured that Todd didn't want to share his daughter with anyone, which caused Todd to act as he did, but Todd had his own issues with women, given his history. Zach vulgarly questioned how Todd would have acted if Starr had been around in the past, when Todd had been young. He asked if she wanted to prove that she was no longer a little girl. \n\n\nRattled, Starr headed for the door, but Zach stopped her from leaving. Just then, Cole, who had remained unconscious and out of sight until that moment, jumped up and told Starr to get away from Zach. He was the man who had raped Marty, Cole yelled. Grabbing her arm, Cole began to usher Starr out the door. Just as they were about to cross the threshold, Zach called out to them. He pointed his gun at them. \n\n\nAdvising them that he couldn't let them leave and call the cops, Zach informed them that he wanted whatever Todd had. He was angry that Todd had received a pardon, was rich, and had a family. As he spoke, Cole dialed John's number on the cell phone behind his back. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, John filled Marty in on the latest attempts to locate Zach, the prime suspect in the town's brutal crimes. He was concerned for both Blair and Marty and wanted to make sure they were protected at all times. Marty declined his offer of driving her home but noted how caring of a husband he was for being in an arranged marriage. \"See what you're missing,\" he replied. \n\n\nJohn insisted that Zach was probably not finished with either Blair or Marty, but since Blair had security at the hospital, he was worried about Marty. Changing the subject, Marty asked John if he had married Blair to screw Todd. Assuring Marty that while the marriage wasn't conventional, it was all about Blair and the protection of her kids. He had no regrets. \n\n\nSurprised to find Marty still waiting after he checked in on Blair, John again suggested that he drive her home. When the phone rang, John told her that Cole was calling. Listening in silence, he heard Cole shouting at Zach while leaving clues on the situation at the same time. \n\n\nZach caught Cole with the phone and assured him that he had made a mistake. Not knowing whom Cole had called, Zach grabbed the phone and stated that the kids would be dead if the cops showed up. Hanging up, he pleasantly thought that things were working better than he had planned. He had Todd's daughter and Marty's son. \n\n\nAs Dorian stared at the cell phone picture and played with the phone, she sent the photo to David. \"Oh no,\" was all she could muster as Ray walked in. \n\n\nViki urged T\u00e9a to let Todd go, because she deserved better. T\u00e9a wondered what would happen if she couldn't do that. \n\n\nAs Schuyler continued to accuse Todd of being responsible for Starr's behavior, Todd grabbed Schuyler and slammed his head into the door. Todd urged him to let it be the last time -- that the teacher wouldn't want a next time.\n\n\n",
