Natalie said it didn't matter \u2014 they're broken up. Cole asked John for a letter of recommendation to play on the school baseball team. Starr freaked out at school over her breakup with Cole, and Britney overheard the news. When Rex saw that Marcie was with Michael, he claimed that he really needed to talk to Michael about a fight he'd just had with Adriana. Blair surprised Todd on the plane and informed him that she was there to help him find his baby. \n\n\nNash still couldn't get a straight answer from Jessica about her feelings for him vs. Antonio. Jessica refused to admit that she made a mistake by marrying Antonio. He tried to make her imagine what their life as a family with Bree would be like and to convince her that it's not right for her adopt Jamie. She told him that they'd been through this a million times, and that her decision is firm: She chooses Antonio. Well, then if her decision is made, he'll make his, Nash declared. The only way to make things better for all of them would be for him to leave, he said, even if that means leaving Bree behind. The only reason he'd stay would be for Jessica, he admitted. \n\n\nAfter eavesdropping on Marty's exchange with Natalie, Miles asked Marty why she couldn't trust him with her problems. He then went on to explain that he didn't reveal the contents of the letter because it contained sensitive info regarding Todd's missing son. Marty was amazed to hear that Todd's son might be alive. \n\n\nMarcie excitedly told Michael that she had to run to talk to the principal about the musical. When Marcie was gone, Rex told Michael about the clue that Miles got, and explained that it must be bogus because it sent Todd to Chicago. \n\n\nJohn gave Cole some advice about sparring: Never challenge a guy twice his size. Cole talked about how he loved to be physical, no matter the sport, and John explained that's because of the endorphins and the \"natural high\" they give you and likened it to being a cop. Cole broke down and admitted that the only thing he really cares about right now is Starr. Not so great in the advice department when it comes to love, John continued to give Cole pointers on how to get involved in sports again, likening it to getting back his badge. When Marty saw Cole with John, she immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion \u2014 that her son was in trouble. Cole showed his mom the letter of recommendation, but wasn't willing to accept her apology and ran off. Marty lamented her changing relationship with Cole to John. \n\n\nBritney implied that Langston was a lesbian because of her \"pent-up passion\" for Starr's plight. Marcie broke up the squabble. Britney informed one of her followers that Cole was finally free ... to date her. In class, Marcie could barely contain her excitement as she announced the upcoming musical, then had to explain the difference between the words \"thespian\" and \"lesbian\" to Britney. No one wanted to participate. After class, Cole asked Marcie for a letter of recommendation. She agreed, but under one condition, that he audition for the school musical. \n\n\nBlair asked Todd where his new \"girlfriend\" Evangeline was. Todd made a Freudian slip about Blair playing \"hooker,\" er, hookie, and told her he didn't need her help. Blair insisted that she was there for herself because Todd's son is also sibling to her own children. A dense fog delayed the plane's landing, giving Blair more time to get on Todd's nerves. When she suggested playing a game, Todd cracked about joining the Mile High Club with her. She was talking about mind games, Blair explained. Oh, right. \n\n\nMichael told Tommy his story would end happily ever after, while Rex called Miles to press him about the information he gave Todd. As their plane prepared for landing, Blair told Todd that she sincerely hoped he'd find his son. Jessica challenged Nash to leave if that's what he thinks is best. She stiffened as he leaned in to kiss her, so he walked away, presumably for good. \n\n\n",
