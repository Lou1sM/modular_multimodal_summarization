At that point, Marty realizes that she doesn't know her own son. She's then shocked to learn that Cole talked to John about Starr and that John's talked to Cole before that, too. She wants to know what John is doing that she isn't so she can get Cole to talk to him. John tells Marty that he saw Cole at the gym trying to spar with someone. Marty leaps to the conclusion that Cole is on steroids again, but John assures her that Cole isn't. He tells her that Cole was just working out some aggression. Marty wants to know what else she doesn't know about her son, so John shows her the letter of recommendation he wrote for Cole, which impresses her. She becomes a little upset that she's not the one helping Cole out with getting letters of recommendation and feels that now that Cole needs her, she's doing everything wrong. She asks John for advice on what to do now. John tells her that the only thing he knows about parenting is what he learned by watching his mom, but he convinces Marty that Cole will be just fine. Marty thanks John for listening and writing the letter for Cole. Then she invites him out for a beer.\n\n\nRex goes into Rodi's to get a beer and notices Nash at the bar. Nash mentions to Rex that he's going to get as far away from Llanview as he can to protect Jessica, which surprised Rex. Rex then relates Nash's troubles with Jessica to the time when Adriana had a stalker. He wonders if running away is the best solution to Nash's problems. Nash tries to end the conversation. Rex tells Nash that he is envious of Nash's position. Sometimes he wishes he could just leave town without worrying about who he might hurt by leaving. Rex then asks Nash where he's going to go, but Nash isn't even sure. Then Rex is curious about Bree. Nash insists that Bree would be better off without him in her life. Rex isn't as easily convinced, given his upbringing with Roxy. Nash is certain that this is for the best because he's well on his way to becoming the embarrassing drunken biological father. Rex then asks Nash who is going to take care of the vineyard. Nash offers it to Rex, but when Rex refuses the offer, Nash assumes that Antonio will take care of it. Then Rex asks Nash what it feels like to lose everything, and again worries about Bree missing Nash when he's gone. Nash abruptly ends the conversation and leaves the bar.\n\n\nCole balks about trying out for the play because he'd feel stupid trying to learn to sing and dance. Marcie then asks him how many letters of recommendation he needs to get. He mentions that he needs two more, and has asked other teachers, but they've refused. After Marcie hears this, she refuses to write one for him. Eventually Cole relents and signs up to audition in exchange for a letter of recommendation. \n\n\nOutside Marcie's classroom, Britney tries to eavesdrop on their conversation. As Starr walks by, Britney loudly says that Cole will need someone to lean on now that Starr dumped him. Starr counters by saying that she wants to see Britney go after Cole just to see Cole shoot her down. Henry walks up to offer Britney his algebra notes. Starr continues fighting with Britney, telling her that her plan won't work because Cole hates her. Henry says that Britney's his friend, but Starr tells him that Britney is just using him. Britney says that Henry should become Starr's friend so that Starr could maybe introduce him to her rapist father. Starr then slaps Britney. \n\n\nBritney threatens Starr as Marcie and Cole walk out of the classroom. Langston and Starr walk away as Marcie asks people to sign up to audition. Britney refuses at first until she hears that Cole signed up. When Marcie goes back into the classroom, Henry asks Britney if she wants to work with him on their history project. She blows him off in order to prepare a song for her audition. Britney then puts her name on the sign-up sheet and tells her friend that she's going to let Henry do all the work on their project. She looks forward to spending lots of time with Cole when they're both in the play together.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Langston asks where Starr's assertiveness came from. Starr is simply fed up with Britney's attitude and has nothing left to lose. She wants to get out of the school to avoid seeing Cole again as he walks up to them. Langston leaves them alone by going to Marcie's classroom to pretend that she forgot something. Cole tells Starr that he's worried about her, but she assures him that everything is fine. She then leaves before they can talk some more. As Langston is leaving Marcie's classroom, Marcie tries to convince her to sign up to audition. Langston isn't persuaded, but then Marcie mentions that Cole and Britney already signed up. Langston feigns interest, and then when Marcie walks away, she signs Starr up to audition instead.\n\n\nJessica meets the Vegas at the diner before their appointment at the courthouse. Jess bought Jamie a bracelet that has Jamie's and Keri's names on it. Jamie and Cristian made her a collage of happy memories between Jamie and Jessica. When Carlotta, Jamie, and Antonio go to check on something, Cris asks Jess if she's happy about becoming Jamie's adoptive mother. Jessica insists that she's happy and that she's fighting for her marriage to Antonio. She also says that she only put Keri's name on the bracelet so that Jamie wouldn't think Jess was trying to take Keri's place. Cristian isn't convinced that Jessica is being completely honest and asks her if she is having, or wants to have, an affair with Nash. He presses her to tell him the truth because he can see she's hurting. She tells him that Nash finally took the hint and is leaving town. Cris can't admit that he's sad to see Nash go. Jessica wants Cristian to back off of her now that Nash is out of their lives. Cris apologizes for pressuring her. Antonio, Carlotta, and Jamie come back from the kitchen and they all prepare to leave for the courthouse.\n\n\nViki and Natalie are preparing to go to the courthouse. Natalie is worried about Viki having a headache, and about Viki's reaction to seeing Clint at the courthouse. Viki assures Nat that she's handling things well, and that she's not going to change her life just to avoid Clint. She asks Natalie if she'd quit her job to avoid seeing John. Nat admits that she's considered it because she dreads the next time she has to see him. Viki comforts Natalie, and tells her that this may be for the best. Natalie can now focus on remembering who she is. Natalie then comforts Viki. She says that she thinks Clint is making a huge mistake and that he's an idiot. At that moment, Clint walks in.\n\n\nNatalie apologizes to Clint for calling him an idiot, but she still thinks that he made a terrible mistake. Viki tells Nat to go get her stuff so they can go to the courthouse. Once Natalie leaves, Clint asks Viki how she's doing. Viki snips that she's fine. Clint wonders if they can possibly be friendlier. Viki tells him that that isn't possible because he took back his offer of becoming more than just parents right when she had decided that that's what she wants. Clint would like to talk things out with Viki, but she'll have none of it. They start to fight, but Viki cuts it off and asks him to leave. Before he goes, he asks Viki if they can at least be civil while at the courthouse. Viki tells him that he doesn't know her as well as he thought if he has to ask her that. \n\n\nAt the courthouse, R.J. is livid about Jamie becoming a member of the Buchanan family. While he's ranting, Dorian starts waxing poetically about the Buchanans, which tips R.J. off to the fact that she's seeing Clint. R.J. is surprised by this development. He tells her to be careful because he doesn't want to see her get hurt. He then wonders how Clint is going to explain things to the Buchanans. Dorian states that Clint will simply tell them that whatever feelings he had for Viki are now dead and buried.\n\n\nThe Vegas arrive at the courthouse for the adoption proceeding. R.J. gives Jamie a hug and tells Antonio and Jessica that Keri would approve of the adoption. Clint enters the court room and is surprised to see Dorian there. She explains that she feels really close to the Vega family. They walk to get a seat together as Viki and Natalie arrive. Dorian congratulates Viki, but Viki blows her off. \n\n\nJessica is looking at her picture as Antonio comes up to her, which startles Jessica. Antonio mentions that he'd like Cristian to make a collage of the entire family, including R.J., the Buchanans, the Vegas, and Nash. As the judge enters the court room, Antonio asks Jessica if she's ready for this, and she confirms that she is.\n\n\nThe judge welcomes everyone to the proceedings. She gets the process started and asks Jessica if she intends to adopt Jamie. Jessica hesitates, then says that she can't go through with it.\n\n\n",
