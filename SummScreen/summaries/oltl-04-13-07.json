Rex walked in and demanded to know what the hell was going on! Natalie went to ask yet another Rodi's bartender \u2014 Billy \u2014 about who left with John. Meanwhile, John and Marty toweled off from the rain at her place. At a nearby table, Bo told Lindsay about Paige's new job, while Nora found Paige at the coffee shop and pulled up a chair. Having time to stop for coffee, Antonio continued to grill Cristian about what's going on with Jessica, who was screaming to Nash at the quarry. Nash tried to get her to leave, but Jessica shrieked that she couldn't go back to Llanview and that everything he'd said about them was right. \n\n\nMarty insisted that John stay while his coat dries. They had some coffee, but John seemed antsy about the condition of his leather jacket, which Marty informed him would take HOURS to dry. Well, it doesn't have to be completely dry, he said, and then they exchanged a few more veiled comments about the wet jacket before he escaped the awkward situation. He thanked her for the coffee and she thanked him for helping her with Cole. \n\n\nRex was upset to see Tate and Adriana on the floor ... eating sushi! He claimed that he was just there to get an extra battery for his computer. Tate referred to himself in the third person as he talked about his new sportscaster job, and read a fortune that said something about winning the prize (presumably Adriana). Cool fortune, said Rex, but not as cool as getting one that says you're going to kiss an elephant on the lips ... or something. \"Look out, Bob Costas!\" Rex called out as Tate went off to his new gig. Done with the quips, Rex broke it to Adriana that he has to leave town for a few days to follow Todd. He'd promised Michael that he'll never let Tommy fall into Todd's hands, so he has to go to Chicago.\n\n\nNatalie asked Bo and Lindsay if they'd heard anything about Jessica's whereabouts, but they weren't even aware that she was missing. Lindsay offered to keep Bo company while he sulked about Paige leaving. She remarked about how well they were bonding and reached for his hands, causing Bo to misinterpret her intention. Meanwhile, Nora tried to persuade Paige not to leave Llanview, telling her it was selfish to hurt Matthew like that. Paige interrupted a warm moment between Bo and Lindsay to tell Bo that she had decided to stay in Llanview. \n\n\nAntonio became more and more enraged as he thought about Jessica running out on Jamie. When she wants to talk, she'll call, he tried to assure himself. Nothing's going to change her decision, remarked Cristian. Antonio demanded that his brother tell him what he knows, and Cristian blurted out that perhaps things would change now that Nash is leaving, leading Antonio to believe that Jess must have gone after Nash. As Cris was about to dish more, Antonio got a call about Jessica's empty car by the side of the road. \n\n\nJessica continued to sob and run her hands through her wet hair as she hollered to Nash that she couldn't lose him and that he was right about her marriage and Jamie's adoption. Nash listened intently as she explained that she needs to be with him. They hugged and she made him promise to never leave her again. They declared their love for each other, then got down to some serious lovemaking on top of a giant tarp. \n\n\n\n\n",
