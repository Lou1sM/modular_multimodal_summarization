    "soap_central": "\n \n\"To a beautiful night, just the two of us together,\" Todd said as he raised his glass of wine at a table in the Palace Hotel. His son and date, Jack, thought that Todd would have preferred to be with T\u00e9a in such a setting. He thought that his father was not only grouchy but \"acting out\" since T\u00e9a had \"dumped\" Todd.  Todd disagreed and thought that adults didn't act out but got even. \n\n\nJack accused his dad of hiring Kelly to \"tick off\" Blair as a means of avoiding the real problem that was T\u00e9a. He knew his father had feelings for T\u00e9a. Todd insisted he hated T\u00e9a, but Jack knew that really meant that Todd loved her. Suddenly, Jack spotted his mom, and Todd invited Blair to join them. He claimed that it was Jack's idea.\n\n\nBlair advised the guys that she was waiting for someone, and Jack wanted to know if it was the man she had been sneaking around with. Blair reprimanded her son because he had assumed something about someone, but he retorted that he had seen her and he had to assume when no one told him anything. Blair admitted that he was correct and that she was dating Elijah. Jack asked if her feelings for Elijah were the same as Todd's were for T\u00e9a. Blair acknowledged that she cared for Elijah, who was a kind and thoughtful man. She was hopeful that her children would get to know him better. Todd remarked that it looked like Elijah had stood her up.\n\n\nBlair was sure she had the wrong time or perhaps Elijah had been tied up in court. Todd knew for a fact that the \"stripper kid case\" had been over earlier because he had a reporter there and the \"gay cop got the kid.\" \"What?\" both Blair and Jack exclaimed. Todd thought that something or someone else had probably distracted Elijah. Blair, unable to reach Elijah, sighed that her phone battery was dead. She thought maybe she had crossed wires and had the wrong details for her date.\n\n\nElijah escorted T\u00e9a to the hospital and insisted that she be checked out after she fainted. T\u00e9a was just as insistent that it was low blood sugar and a bite to eat would cure her in no time. Just then, Greg walked by and Elijah summoned him over for some help. Greg agreed that he should examine T\u00e9a. She wondered why Greg was \"slumming it\" in the emergency room, and Greg advised her that the ER was short-staffed. T\u00e9a tried to explain that she had previously had the same symptoms when she was busy and had forgotten to eat. Greg asked if there were a possibility that T\u00e9a was pregnant, which caused her to spit out the water she had been drinking.\n\n\nT\u00e9a assured him that she wasn't pregnant as Todd was the last man she had dated and that had been some time in the past. Greg took her to an examination room and Elijah waited on the other side of the drawn curtain. Greg wondered when T\u00e9a had a physical and while she couldn't remember, she mentioned the extent of the tests she had received when she had been blown up at the fraternity house with Blair. She noted that it was when she and Blair had declared that Todd was the \"love of our lives.\" Elijah's eyes lit up at that remark.\n\n\nGreg determined that T\u00e9a needed a battery of tests, but T\u00e9a accused him of torturing her because she was a friend of Rachel's. For Elijah's benefit, she explained that Greg and Rachel had broken up. Greg quickly retorted that he had been right about Schuyler, and the pair began to argue. Greg thought that Rachel had been indirectly responsible for Bo's shooting, since she had protected Schuyler. T\u00e9a stood her ground and refused to allow tests to be run, but as a concession agreed to make an appointment for the near future. Greg offered to take care of the appointment and, as T\u00e9a dressed, Elijah asked for more information on T\u00e9a's earlier remark about Todd. He wanted to know if T\u00e9a thought he stood a chance with Blair.\n\n\nT\u00e9a conceded that Blair had the same convoluted history with Todd that T\u00e9a did, but hopefully Blair wasn't a fool. She admitted that she wasn't a fan of Blair. She was ready to go and mentioned the food at the Palace. Elijah gasped as he recalled that he had a date with Blair. He quickly called Blair and left her a message that his phone had been on silent while he was in court. He would head over to the Palace immediately and hoped she was still there. T\u00e9a thanked him for his support and for taking her to the hospital.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Blair was sure that Elijah had tried to call her but her phone was dead. She imagined that he had called the house and left her a message. Todd made fun of her, sure that Elijah had done no such thing. His smile quickly evaporated when Elijah, apologizing profusely, arrived and greeted Blair.\n\n\nMarkko found Cole at Hallowed Grounds but was stumped over Cole's concern for him. \"Langston's been...,\" Cole began and stopped. Sensing that Markko was not upset about anything, Cole continued, \"driving us crazy with that musical.\" Markko agreed that Langston was driven when she was involved with something and was very committed and passionate. He understood her behavior and was certain they would get through it. He showed Cole the four tickets that Dorian had given him for the show at Ultraviolet. Markko was thrilled that he and Langston, Cole, and Starr would have an evening out just like old times. He confided that Dorian had been exceptionally nice lately.\n\n\nStarr arrived home and was shocked to learn that Langston had not broken things off with Markko as planned. Langston admitted that she couldn't go through with it, and she wasn't planning on telling him that she had cheated on him. She explained that things had changed. \"You decided to go back in time and not cheat on him?\" Starr asked sarcastically. She wanted Langston to \"stop stringing Markko along.\" She was also tired of lying to Cole, Starr added. Langston announced that she was not going to break up with Markko, after all, but with Ford instead. Langston had decided that it would be a mistake to break up with Markko.\n\n\nA confused Starr wanted an explanation, since Langston was intent on breaking up with Markko when Starr had last seen her. Langston detailed Markko's arrival home with a fantastic gift and how supportive and loving he had been. Dorian had also stopped by and had spoken highly of Markko and Langston had decided that Dorian and Starr were both correct. Her concerns had arisen from her fright of being with one person forever, but she had since decided that Markko was the one she wanted to be with after all. Langston assured a still-confused Starr that things had appeared \"crystal clear\" to her and she would not tell Markko about Ford.\n\n\nLangston made it clear that Markko spent time with Ford, since Ford was his instructor, and she was not about to ruin the semester for him. She was sorry that she asked Starr to lie for her, though Starr promptly admitted that Langston had stood behind Starr and Cole when they had problems. Langston was happy that Starr had made her see clearly and as the girls hugged each other, Cole and Markko returned home. The girls assured them that things were okay.\n\n\nLangston vaguely confessed that she had been wrong and Markko was sure the disagreement had been about the musical. Starr was filled in about the show tickets and Cole assumed the girls had \"some conversation\" if Langston had neglected to tell her friend about the evening out. Cole turned quickly to Starr after Markko and Langston went to their room to get ready for the concert. Starr excitedly told him that Langston had chosen to remain with Markko and to break things off with Ford. Cole agreed that he had suspected as much when he had comforted Markko when Markko didn't appear to need any comfort. Starr thought that things had turned out to be great, but Cole was skeptical.\n\n\nRex and Gigi arrived at Statesville Prison to speak to Allison. As soon as they sat down, Rex demanded to know who he really was. Allison admitted that Mitch had been angry at her for her deceit. Rex demanded to know if Allison was his mother since his birth certificate showed that Mitch was his father. Allison was sorry, but she wasn't Rex's mother, she told him. At Rex's obvious show of relief, she berated him, \"You could have done a lot worse. Actually you did.\" She thought that the people who had \"dumped\" Rex at the hospital would certainly be considered worse.\n\n\nAllison claimed that she had created the birth certificate that cited Mitch as Rex's father but that Stacy had the information that Rex was searching for. She knew that Stacy was dead but had kept an eye on Stacy when Stacy stole the sample of Mitch's blood and hid it. Allison had realized that Stacy wanted to keep it on hand to switch blood later on to prove that Rex was her baby's father. The blood was hidden in an empty soda can at Rex's loft, she told him.\n\n\nRex wanted to know how the stem cells from Mitch had saved Shane if Rex hadn't been related to Mitch, but Allison thought it was pure coincidence. She thought that Mitch was a sacred man, one who was \"touched by God.\" She reminded him, \"Consider the blood in the soda can a gift.\" Rex asked if Allison had seen the people who had abandoned him at the hospital. She only heard the nurses' conversation, she told him, but she had a great memory. She recalled the name of one of the nurses, Wojciehowicz. She even spelled the name out loud for Rex.\n\n\nThe young people of Llanview began to arrive at Ultraviolet to see a performance by Lifehouse. Brody and Jessica walked in as Jessica complained that she had never heard of the group. Brody ordered her to stop complaining, to shut up, and to have a good time. Cristian and Layla turned up shortly after, and Layla's eyes settled on Brody and Jessica, seated at a nearby table. Cristian was hopeful that the other couple would work things out.\n\n\nBrody continued to ask Jessica questions as he tried to get to know her. She told him that her favorite groups were Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync and that she wanted to travel to see the wonders of the world. She accused Brody of trying to get her to remember things, but he assured her that he had considered the evening to be their first date and he only wanted to impress her. He suggested taking her up in a chopper and assured her they had never flown together in the past. He entertained her with a trick and then Jessica spotted Cristian and Layla. She called out to them to join her and Brody. The couples made some small talk and Cristian asked Layla to join him on the dance floor. They declined Jessica's request that they sit with her and Brody.\n\n\nBrody and Jessica headed to the dance floor, too, but as an old song was played, Jessica rushed back to her table. She was upset and explained to Brody that the song had been her song with Cristian. Cristian told Layla the same, and Layla's disappointment bubbled to the surface. Cristian excused himself for a moment, and suddenly the song changed to a more current one. Cristian had quickly left the floor and asked the disc jockey for a switch to Layla's favorite song. She was happy again.\n\n\nBrody recalled a distant memory of a man dancing with a girl on a night when he was unable to attend a wedding with her. He told Jessica that it was about two people in his past and didn't let on that he was talking about himself and Jessica. He advised her to be prepared for their second date.\n\n\nFord was at the club and ran into the pizza delivery girl, Karen. She suggested that they get together later. He attempted to reach Langston on the phone, but he eyed other girls as they walked by.\n\n\nStarr and Langston reached the club ahead of the boys, who were parking the car. \"Uh-oh,\" Starr said when she spotted Ford. Langston advised Starr that she would break things off with him right away. She grabbed Ford and pulled him off to a secluded spot as Cole and Markko walked inside. Starr advised them that Langston was in the ladies' room, and Markko decided to get some drinks. \"This night is too weird,\" Cole said to Starr as they discussed the issue of Langston and Markko. Cole and Starr promised to always be honest with each other, and Starr admitted she had to tell him something else. She disclosed that Langston was off breaking up with Ford at that moment.\n\n\nCole was upset and thought they should talk to Markko right away. He was angry that Langston had \"snowed\" his friend with all of her lies, and he thought Markko should know the truth. Starr successfully advised him against the move. She thought that Langston had made a mistake but was trying to fix it. Furthermore, she thought that Markko and Langston should handle things on their own.\n\n\nLangston hastily told Ford that she had confided to Starr that she wanted to break things off with Markko. Angrily, Ford reminded her that he had suggested they wait until the end of the semester for a multitude of reasons, and Langston assured him she had almost done it but changed her mind. She didn't want to hurt Markko, so she had lied and said she would break up with Ford instead. She actually had no intentions of breaking up with Ford but thought that their affair would have to be even more secret than it already was. Ford was agreeable and pulled Langston into a kiss before she returned to her friends. He looked as pleased as the cat who had swallowed the canary.\n\n\nLangston returned and seemed a little too perky. Cole's suspicions were immediately aroused. It was time for Lifehouse to perform and they sang their hit \"Halfway Gone.\" Langston appeared to be miserable until she spotted Ford across the floor. Just then he received a text message from Karen, \"It's almost later.\"\n\n\nJack and Todd abruptly left the Palace and bumped into T\u00e9a, who was on the way in. Todd ignored her and marched out.\n\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse handed Greg a file. Her nametag read Nan Wojciehowicz.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Langston is able to please her friends by affirming that she is breaking up with Ford and stay with Markko. But Starr and Cole both know that it may not be realistic. And she reveals to Ford, privately, that she's lying to all of them and will stay with him secretly. Blair is at the palace waiting for Eli who has forgotten their date and runs into Todd and Jack. Todd is incomplete about T\u00e9a. Rex and Gigi go to talk to Allison in Statesville to find out if she knows who his real parents are. She admits she does not know. But she remembers the very uncommon name of a nurse who was there when Rex was born who might know.",
