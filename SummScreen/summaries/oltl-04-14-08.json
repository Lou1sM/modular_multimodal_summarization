Recalling the night he found Cole and Starr in bed together, Todd expressed his extreme hatred for Cole. Cole told Todd that the scene he witnessed was two people who loved each other. Cole suggested that if Todd hadn't decided to move without giving Starr a say, the entire night wouldn't have happened. When Todd accused Cole of raping Starr, Cole said that he was nothing like Todd and would never hurt Starr. Todd became enraged when Cole reminded him of Marty, and threatened to kill Cole if he ever came near Starr again. \n\n\nUp in Starr's bedroom, Langston attempted to convince Starr to reconsider having an abortion. Starr was adamant that her father would kill Cole if he ever learned of the pregnancy. Believing an abortion was her only option, Starr told Langston that she would risk everything to prevent Todd from harming Cole. When Langston reminded Starr that she couldn't get an abortion without the consent of an adult, Starr revealed that parental consent wasn't required in New Jersey. Starr begged Langston to help her devise a plan to travel to New Jersey and obtain an abortion. Consumed with guilt, Starr continued to blame herself for having unprotected sex with Cole. Starr made Langston promise to never make the same mistake she did. Langston promised to stand by Starr. When Starr began having cravings, the girls headed downstairs to get Starr some food. Once downstairs, the girls could hear Cole and Todd arguing in the library. As they stood on the other side of the door, Starr worried as she listened to Todd threaten Cole. Grabbing Cole, Todd pulled him close and ordered him to stay away from his entire family. Todd threatened him with prison time or possible death if he didn't. Langston prevented Starr from breaking up the heated argument and the girls ran upstairs when they heard the door to the library opening. Cole showed no fear when Todd demanded that he leave immediately. Enraged, Todd ordered Shaun to throw him out of the house. Back upstairs, Starr and Langston watched as Cole got into his car and left. Starr told Langston that she realized that abortion was the only answer. Starr pleaded with Langston to understand that an abortion was the only way to prevent Todd from killing Cole. Langston agreed to help Starr figure out a way to go to New Jersey. \n\n\nAt Rex and Adriana's loft, Layla overheard Dorian requesting information regarding Brody Lovett, Shane's father. When Layla accused Dorian of attempting to uncover damaging information against Rex and Gigi, Dorian stated that her only concern was learning the truth about the man that Gigi claimed to be Shane's father. Dorian explained that her research revealed that Brody Lovett was indeed a Navy Seal and had died at some point. Feeling this was enough information to back up Gigi's claim, Layla suggested that Dorian end her investigation. Convinced that there was more to learn, Dorian vowed to learn everything she could about Brody Lovett and ensure that Adriana's wedding actually took place. \n\n\nIn a boardroom at Buchanan Enterprises, Gigi admitted to Rex that she still missed Shane's father. When Rex suggested that she put the past behind her and attempt to rebuild her life without Shane's dad, Gigi told Rex that perhaps she didn't have to. Confused, Rex asked Gigi to tell him the truth. Meanwhile, Adriana approached the door to the boardroom. Before she could enter, Adriana received a call from Dorian. Dorian told Adriana that many of the facts Gigi gave about Brody Lovett were true. Brody Lovett wasn't a figment of Gigi's imagination; the deceased Navy Seal was Shane's father. When Adriana demanded to know how Brody actually died and what type of mission he was involved in at the time of his death, Dorian stated that she didn't know yet but intended to learn every piece of information that existed about the former Navy Seal. As Gigi prepared to tell Rex the \"truth\" concerning Shane, Adriana interrupted. Gigi watched nervously as Adriana and Rex shared a kiss. When Adriana made a snide comment about Rex and Gigi always being together, both Rex and Gigi called her on it. Feeling cornered, Adriana made light of the situation and presented Rex with the cell phone he had left behind. Fed up with Adriana's tactics, Gigi asked the couple to allow her to finish her work. Rex and Adriana obliged. As they headed towards the elevator, Rex realized he had missed an important call and told Adriana he would meet her at home. After Rex walked down the hall, Adriana stepped off the elevator and headed back to the boardroom to see Gigi. \n\n\nAs Gigi attempted to complete her work, Adriana confronted Gigi and informed her that Rex wasn't available to be a \"daddy\" for her baby. Frustrated, Gigi tried to convince Adriana that she had no desire to interfere in Adriana's relationship with Rex. Adriana suggested that the conversation she walked in on earlier appeared to be an intense one. When Adriana demanded to know why Gigi and Rex were discussing Shane, Gigi reminded Adriana that she was a single mother and talked about her son all the time. Seizing the opportunity to discuss Shane's father, Adriana began questioning Gigi about Brody. Realizing that Gigi intended to offer no information, Adriana mentioned that she spoke to Shane about his dad at the diner earlier. Upon learning that Adriana had questioned Shane about his father, Gigi lashed out at Adriana. Gigi begged Adriana to stay away from her and Shane, but Adriana stated that she couldn't grant that wish because Rex was so concerned about them both. Adriana attempted to explain how her conversation with Shane began, but unnerved Gigi when she commented that Shane might learn his father was not really a hero. \n\n\nMarcie enjoyed spending time with Shane at the diner, but became somewhat withdrawn when thoughts of Tommy surfaced. When Michael took time from his busy schedule at the hospital to join Marcie, her spirits lifted. However, when he mentioned an abandoned baby being admitted to the hospital, Marcie began thinking about Tommy. Marcie was surprised to learn that Michael gave Shane a baseball card that he had intended to give Tommy when he grew up. When Marcie inquired about the card, Michael told her that he felt Shane needed the card because he didn't have a dad to hand him down a memento. Marcie understood. Later, Gigi arrived at the diner to pick up Shane. When Gigi expressed her displeasure with Adriana, Marcie defended Adriana's actions by stating she was a nervous bride. Gigi asked Marcie if Adriana had asked her to be in the wedding. Sadly, Marcie stated that Rex told her Adriana intended to ask her, but Adriana neglected to mention it when she saw her earlier. \n\n\nAdrian rushed into the loft and ordered Dorian and Layla to leave before Rex came home. Before they could leave, Rex entered and wondered why Adriana was returning home just before him. He expected her to have arrived home earlier since she left B.E. long before he did. After Dorian and Layla left, Adriana made up an excuse for arriving home late. Later, Adriana and Rex made love. Afterwards, Rex asked Adriana if she had asked Marcie to be a bridesmaid. Rex was surprised when Adriana stated that she didn't want Marcie to be in the bridal party. When asked for an explanation, Adriana said that she felt Marcie might be uncomfortable after the publicity of her ordeal with Tommy. Accepting Adriana's explanation, Rex told her that she was a thoughtful person. \n\n\nUpon finding Talia and John together at the Cambridge Motel, an infuriated Antonio punched John. As the two men violently fought, an undressed Talia begged Antonio to listen to her. Outside of the motel, Eddie watched the altercation and reported to Ramsey. When Eddie asked Ramsey if he should break up the fight, a delighted Ramsey ordered him to let the two men battle it out for themselves. Appalled by Talia's actions, Antonio refused to listen to her explanation. Enraged, Antonio stated that Ramsey had been right about John all along. Antonio felt he should have listened when Ramsey told him that John did the exact same thing to Ramsey. John denied all claims, but offered no explanation. Before leaving, Antonio warned Talia that John had destroyed the life of every woman he was ever involved with-they were either severely damaged or dead. In a fit of anger, Antonio headed for the police station. Alone in the motel room, John told Talia that he realized the situation was hard on her. Talia replied that the situation was difficult for everyone involved. \n\n\nAt the police station, Ramsey sat in his office and told someone on the phone that he would meet them with the money. As Ramsey ended his conversation, Antonio stormed into the office and demanded to know why Ramsey set him up. Antonio accused Ramsey of making it possible for him to find Talia and John in bed together. Ramsey admitted to orchestrating the chain of events. Ramsey said he felt Antonio needed to realize just what type of man John actually was. After hearing Ramsey's explanation, Antonio apologized to Ramsey and thanked him for opening his eyes to the real John McBain. Afterwards, Talia entered the station and attempted to make peace with Antonio. Antonio ordered Talia to remove all her belongings from his loft immediately. As Talia tried to apologize, John entered the station and approached Talia. In disgust, Antonio glared at Talia and John. As John and Talia walked away, Ramsey, unnoticed, observed everyone's actions.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr tells Langston that she believes she has no choice except for abortion. And as soon as they go downstairs, they observe that Cole has come by to confront Todd. And Todd tells Cole if he ever comes near Starr again, he will die. Starr then concludes that there is no way she can reveal to anybody that she is pregnant with Cole's baby. After Antonio catches John and Talia in the motel room in bed, he believes what Ramsey tells him. Ramsey apologizes for setting him up to catch them. But he tells him he felt he had to let Antonio see it for himself so he doesn't spend any more time being deceived. Adriana is having Dorian investigate Shane's \"real father\" but it's pretty obvious he is probably Rex. Adriana is very concerned about Rex's relationship with Gigi and with Shane.",
