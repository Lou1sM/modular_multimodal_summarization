Stacy quickly explained that Kyle was not Rex. Schuyler was baffled as to why Stacy would need to see a lab tech. \n\n\nStacy fought to find a plausible excuse. She told Schuyler that Kyle had offered to answer her questions. Kyle had noticed that she was nervous about donating bone marrow. Schuyler didn't believe Stacy's lie. \n\n\nStacy tried to act innocent, but Schuyler wasn't swayed. Stacy opted to retreat. She shoved Kyle out the door then followed him. In the hallway, Kyle expressed reservations about following through with the bone marrow switch. Kyle pointed out that his career was on the line. Stacy reminded Kyle that his actions would save a child's life. \n\n\nStacy wondered if it was necessary for her to go through with the actual bone marrow extraction. Kyle was adamant that the procedure was imperative in order to carry off the switch. Stacy hoped that Kyle knew what he was doing. \n\n\nWhen Stacy returned to the apartment, Schuyler's mood wasn't improved. Stacy accused Schuyler of being \"pissy.\" He admitted that he craved a drink, his face hurt, and he was tired. Most of all, though, Schuyler claimed he felt sorry for Stacy. Stacy had chosen a man who didn't love her over a man who did love her. Stacy said nothing as Schuyler walked out of the room. \n\n\nShane wanted to know what was going on between Rex and Gigi. Rex insisted that everything was fine, but Shane didn't believe him. Rex tried evade Shane's questions, but without success. Shane sensed that something was off between his parents. \n\n\nRoxy admitted that she knew Stacy was blackmailing Gigi. Roxy offered to help Gigi outwit Stacy. Gigi pretended that she had no idea what Roxy was talking about. Roxy didn't believe Gigi. As Roxy began ranting about Stacy, she accidentally let it slip that Stacy wasn't a match. \n\n\nGigi demanded to know what Roxy had meant by the comment. Roxy quickly covered her blunder; she claimed that Stacy wasn't a romantic match for Rex. Roxy switched gears by asking why Gigi didn't back out of her promise to Stacy after Shane's transplant. \n\n\nRex stepped out of Shane's room. He realized he interrupted a private conversation between Gigi and Roxy. He wondered what they had been talking about. Roxy distracted Rex by trying to play matchmaker. Rex would have none of it. He wondered why everyone seemed to treat Gigi's liaison with Brody as if it hadn't been a big deal. Before Gigi or Roxy could answer, Rex told Gigi that they needed to talk to Shane about their relationship. \n\n\nRoxy stepped away while Gigi argued that the timing wasn't appropriate for Shane to be given bad news. Gigi suggested that they wait until after Shane's transplant. Rex explained that Shane sensed something was wrong. Gigi offered a compromise; she agreed to tell Shane just enough to appease his curiosity. Gigi promised that after the transplant, when there was no going back, she would reveal the truth to everyone. \n\n\nGigi and Rex went into Shane's room. Gigi explained that she had been under tremendous stress. Gigi took full responsibility for treating Rex poorly because of her frustrations. Gigi promised that everything would be okay after Shane's transplant. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora and Rachel sat down to talk. Clint listened from the hallway for a few moments, then walked away. \n\n\nRachel assured Nora that she intended to stay in Llanview for as long as Nora and Matthew needed her. Rachel was determined to help her family through the crisis. Rachel also expressed concern about Nora's relationship with Clint. \n\n\nNora admitted that her relationship with Clint was a bit rocky. Rachel advised Nora to talk things out with Clint. \n\n\nShortly afterwards, Bo and Matthew came into the living room. Rachel greeted her brother warmly then challenged him to a game of basketball. Matthew reminded Rachel of his wheelchair. Rachel didn't view it as a problem because Matthew's arms still worked. Matthew smiled as he left the room with his sister. \n\n\nBo and Nora were delighted by Matthew's change of attitude. Bo credited Rachel's influence for the turnaround. \n\n\nBo changed the subject to ask where Clint was. Nora's response hinted that things were strained between her and Clint. Bo reminded Nora that Clint and Viki went through a similar crisis when Jessica had suffered a breakdown. Bo's insight made Nora realize that Clint was doing what he thought would help her through a difficult time. \n\n\nNora appreciated Bo's advice. She confessed that she wished Bo had someone special whom he could turn to. Nora adored Bo and wanted him to have love and happiness in his life. \n\n\nCharlie tried to lure Viki up to her bedroom. Viki agreed to join him in bed, but sent Charlie ahead. Viki dashed to the refrigerator as soon as Charlie left the kitchen. While Viki set a container of strawberries on the counter, someone knocked at the backdoor. Viki opened the door to find Clint standing on her doorstep. \n\n\nClint was troubled. He confessed that he felt like an idiot for planning a party for Matthew without consulting Bo and Nora. Viki realized Clint's intention had been in the right place, but she confessed she thought the party had been a mistake. Clint was surprised that Viki hadn't said anything to him sooner. \n\n\nViki reminded Clint that it wasn't her place to tell him when she thought he was making a mistake. Clint disagreed; he insisted that their friendship gave Viki a right to speak up. Viki revealed that she didn't want to get caught up in the middle of something between Clint, Nora, and Bo. \n\n\nClint understood Viki's reluctance. \n\n\nViki reminded Clint of how the two of them had banded together when Jessica had a breakdown. Viki explained that parents needed to be united in order to weather the difficult times with their children. Viki believed that Nora and Bo needed to focus on Matthew, which meant that there might not be a place for Clint. She advised Clint to have patience and to give Nora and Bo time to adjust to the changes in their lives. \n\n\nClint made a hasty exit when Charlie came looking for Viki. Clint apologized for interrupting their evening, but thanked Viki for her sage words. \n\n\nViki tried to lead Charlie back upstairs, but Charlie decided he would wait in the kitchen in the event that Dorian showed up seeking counsel. Viki smiled as she realized that Charlie was jealous. Charlie readily admitted that he was insecure. Viki seductively suggested that they play doctor in her bedroom to make Charlie feel better. \n\n\nClint arrived at the Buchanan mansion. He approached the living room, but changed his mind when he witnessed a private moment between Bo and Nora. \n\n\nTodd held a gun in his hand as he watched John and Zach struggle during a fight. \n\n\nMarty stood at the bottom of Todd's staircase when she heard a shot ring out. \n\n\nUpstairs, John pulled away from Zach. Zach was unconscious and bleeding on the floor. John complimented Todd on the shot. Todd asked John what made him think that Zach had been the intended target. John didn't have an opportunity to reply; the police swarmed into the room. \n\n\nWhile the paramedics attended to Zach's injury, police questioned Todd and John. Moments later, John started to walk away. For the benefit of the police, and to annoy John, Todd made a point of reminding everyone that he had saved John's life. \n\n\nDownstairs, Talia questioned Marty about the events that had led to the shooting. Cole and Starr waited in the foyer for John and Todd. Cole hugged Starr. Starr asked Cole what he had intended to tell her before Zach had intruded into their lives. \n\n\nCole recalled confessing his love for Starr to Marty. However, Cole was spared from having to answer Starr's question when John walked downstairs. Marty ran up to John and threw her arms around him. John pulled Marty aside to update her on what had happened with Zach. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Starr noticed that Cole was shaking. Cole claimed he had a bad headache. Starr offered to fetch something from her father's medicine cabinet, but Cole decided to get what he needed himself. \n\n\nUpstairs, Cole waited until Todd's bedroom was deserted before he slipped into the adjoining bathroom. Cole quickly sifted through the prescription bottles until he found what he was looking for. Cole popped two pills into his mouth then pocketed the prescription bottle. \n\n\nAs Zach was led out of Todd's house he taunted, \"Hello Marty. Remember me?\" \n\n\nMarty had a flashback of Zach raping her. Zach was pulled away before he could terrorize Marty further. Moments later, John escorted Marty out of the house. \n\n\nStarr was relieved when she saw Todd come downstairs. She ran into her father's arms as he told her how sorry he was. Starr assured her father that she was fine because Todd and Cole had saved her. \n\n\nOutside, Marty sensed that John was troubled. She asked him what was bothering him. John confessed that he hoped they had caught the right guy. \n\n\nUpstairs, Todd sat down on the floor. He dipped his finger into a pool of Zach's blood.\n\n\n",
