    "soap_central": "\nGood Cop, John Cop\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Bo and Rachel had breakfast and discussed Zach's arrest and Matthew's return to school. Bo said he was fine with Matthew being late for his first day back after the accident, but Rachel wasn't so sure it was a good idea. \n\n\nAs Matthew wheeled himself into the drawing room, he begged off of school by playing sick. Bo fell for his ruse and headed to work, leaving Rachel alone to call her little brother's bluff. \n\n\nRachel told Matthew not to let fear of teasing keep him from going back to school and facing the world. When she mentioned her own struggle with drug addiction, Matthew was shocked; he hadn't known she had ever had a problem. Matthew told Rachel he wished he'd been able to go to her when he'd learned of Cole's problem, and Rachel told him he could talk to her anytime. Matthew agonized over being unable to play in the new baseball season at Llanview High, and said he couldn't handle re-learning how to live. Rachel told him he had to take it day by day, coming to grips with his new condition. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr searched high and low for her lost locket, and called Todd for assistance. Todd was pleased to hear from his daughter, but told her he hadn't seen the locket after the hostage crisis. \n\n\nIn the foyer, Shaun was preoccupied with yet another plea for help from Destiny, who called from Llanview High, begging her brother to call in their mysterious acquaintance to help the crippled Matthew. Shaun shut his little sister down, and warned her not to bother him on the job again. \n\n\nAt Llanview High, Destiny sauntered up to Justin and Becca and ordered them to attend her impromptu \"planning committee meeting\" after school. Destiny explained that they would be planning a welcome home rally for Matthew. Justin and Becca refused, leading Destiny to remind them of how their actions had indirectly led to Matthew getting into a car accident, making them potential criminal accessories. \"The nicer you are to him, the less likely he is to sue you!\" she chirped. Destiny told her downcast classmates to attend her meeting, or risk \"doing a dime in Statesville.\" Cowed, the kids rushed off. \n\n\nAfter hanging up on Destiny, Shaun stormed into the living room and snatched Starr's phone, ending her conversation with Todd and warning him not to call again. Starr argued with Shaun, but he ignored her pleas and confiscated her phone. \n\n\nAs Shaun\nleft, Langston walked in, having cut class to offer Starr a shoulder to lean on. Langston was surprised that Starr was so eager to reestablish ties with Todd, and reminded her that Cole had been there for her during the hostage crisis as well. Starr made a weak case for her continuing \"relationship\" with Schuyler, but Langston reminded her that Schuyler had not been in touch since she'd sent her letter. Langston said Schuyler was sending Starr a message, and told her not to ignore her lasting feelings for Cole. \n\n\nStarr finally admitted that she did still care for Cole, and that their connection had been rekindled during the hostage crisis. Langston asked her not to throw away what she'd had with Cole for something with a grown man who didn't want her. Starr thanked Langston for her advice, and Langston hurried back to school. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd flew into a rage after Shaun hung up on him, and trampled on his cellphone. In the midst of his tantrum, T\u00e9a let herself in, and Todd told his ex-wife that she owed him a phone on top of the family she'd taken from him. T\u00e9a was relieved to see Todd was all right, but defended John as a decent, safe stepfather to his children. She said that in light of the Zach debacle, Todd's life had proven dangerous to his loved ones. Todd told T\u00e9a that John knew nothing about what his kids dealt with on a daily basis, such as Starr's crush on her teacher. \n\n\nTodd urged T\u00e9a to give up on her defense of Blair's custody, and to expose Blair and John's marriage as a fraud. He promised to make good on his offer to be her \"love slave,\" and dared her to admit she was tempted. Appalled, T\u00e9a grabbed her bag and prepared to leave in a huff, but Todd followed her and pushed her to admit she still wanted him. \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a told him about her conversation with Viki, Todd was unimpressed; he told T\u00e9a he'd seen her outraged routine before, but she still wanted him, ugliness and all. Appealing to T\u00e9a's bleeding heart, Todd said she knew he was a man who loved his children and would do right by them. Smirking, he said she'd tried to fix him before, and could do so again if she liked. \"Let the healing begin,\" Todd purred. \n\n\nAt the rehab facility, Cole met with his counselor, Lauren, who noticed he had Starr's locket. After Lauren left, Cole grew anxious as he waited to be let out of his session. \n\n\nBefore he could be released, he had a surprise visitor, Markko. Cole was frosty to his estranged friend at first, but softened after Markko said he'd thought Cole would need space after the accident. Markko said that Starr still needed Cole, and told him she was torn up by her infatuation with Mr. Joplin. Cole said that Starr and Schuyler were over; he'd seen to that by going to Todd. Markko was shocked that Cole was willing to conspire with Todd again, but Cole said he would do anything to help Starr, and admitted he still loved her. \n\n\nJust as Markko was about to tell Cole about his problems with Lola, Lauren popped in to tell Cole he needed to give a sample for a random drug test. After Lauren exited, Markko prepared to leave as well, but Cole asked him to stay. He explained that he'd stolen pills from Todd's after the hostage crisis to take the edge off, and needed Markko to fake his urine sample so he wouldn't be booted out of rehab. Mortified, Markko reluctantly agreed, but made Cole promise to give his relationship with Starr another chance. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Shaun was shocked when Destiny barged into the house to hector him about the phone number for their mysterious estranged brother, the only one who could help Matthew. Shaun told Destiny he saw through her platonic concern for Matthew, and accused her of having a crush on the boy. Shaun told his little sister that their sibling was no brother of theirs anymore, and refused to give her the number. Frustrated, Destiny left. \n\n\nBack at the Buchanan mansion, Becca and Justin arrived to make nice with Matthew. Rachel gave the kids time to themselves, but Matthew was furious with his peers, who attempted to ply him with video games and sympathy. After Matthew told them to get out, the kids retreated, but Justin told Becca he had an idea. \n\n\nBecca quickly returned to the drawing room to give Matthew the soft sell. She feigned disinterest in Justin, and said she was sorry for spurning Matt at the dance. She told him she missed him at school, and asked him to come back soon. As Becca leaned in to kiss Matthew, Destiny arrived and spotted the two from the foyer. Before she could be seen, Destiny hid, then watched with dismay as Becca left the jubilant Matthew in her wake. \n\n\nBack at Llanview High, Markko and Langston reunited between classes, and shared skip stories about visiting with Cole and Starr. Langston was concerned about Cole getting into more trouble, but Markko promised her that he'd helped Cole handle everything. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Shaun ushered Cole in to see Starr. Starr and Cole beamed at each other as they were reunited. \n\n\nAt the rehab facility, Lauren greeted a new drug counselor who would be working with Cole's difficult case: Rachel Gannon. Lauren asked Rachel if she was ready for a challenge. \"Absolutely,\" Rachel replied. \n\n\nAt the police station, John posed as a \"special consultant\" to listen in on Nora's interrogation of Zach. John warned Nora not to let Zach toy with her, but Nora assured him she knew how to handle her former client. \n\n\nAs John watched from behind the one-way glass and Bo arrived to join him, Nora and Zach shared an icy reunion. Zach still blamed Nora for throwing his defense, while Nora excoriated Zach for having learned nothing from his years behind bars. Nora grilled Zach about the KAD murders, but Zach denied all knowledge. Unconvinced, Nora laid out Zach's possible motives, such as remorse for Marty or hatred for Todd, but Zach insisted he was innocent. He told Nora that if she didn't believe him yet, she would when another victim was found. \n\n\nThe crime scene investigation unit called Bo away, Zach was taken back to his cell, and Nora rejoined John. Nora was upset that she hadn't gotten anything out of Rosen, but John was unconvinced that there was anything to find. He told Nora that the murders had been ritualistic and methodical, whereas Zach's attack on Todd's loved ones had been impulsive and motivated by revenge. The pattern didn't fit, and John told Nora they had to consider the possibility that Zach's return was unrelated to the killings. \n\n\nBo returned from the CSI unit, and John and Nora shared their suspicions with him. Bo told Nora to bring Zach back for another session, and gave them evidence that trumped their fears, a bloodstained knife found under Zach's bed. Bo was convinced they'd found their man. \n\n\nAt Todd's, Todd and T\u00e9a continued their argument as Todd continued to lay on the \"charm\" and T\u00e9a again attempted to leave. Todd followed her out the front door, asking T\u00e9a if she needed him to ritualize their romance the way they had years before, with him pushing her away and her pleading with him for sexual intimacy. \"Get on your knees!\" Todd demanded. \"Beg me! Beg me and you shall receive!\" He grabbed her and wheeled her around, slamming her against the doorframe. \n\n\nThe close proximity ignited the attraction between the exes, but Todd pulled away from T\u00e9a, leaving her wanting. Enraged and aroused, T\u00e9a grabbed Todd's lapels and shoved him back into the house, then stalked after him, slamming the front door behind her. \n\n\n",
