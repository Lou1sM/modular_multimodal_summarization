She was upset over the allegations made against Clint and had hoped that he would deny them. Clint surprised Nora when he quietly admitted that the facts of the article were true. Clint tried explaining to Nora why he felt driven to take such desperate measures to save Buchanan Enterprises but Nora had a difficult time understanding. She was convinced that he could have saved B.E. in an honorable way rather than using tactics that Asa would have used. Clint defended his actions, which led Nora to admit that her feelings for Clint were growing stronger and she was concerned over the possibility of Clint following in his father's footsteps. Clint assured Nora that his actions, while underhanded, were legal. Nora was relieved to hear that since it would have been her job to prosecute Clint if he had broken any laws. Unfortunately, things remained a bit unsettled between them. Nora was saddened to hear Clint admit that if he had to do it over, he'd do the same thing again to save his family's business. Clint was worried about where they stood because as Nora walked out, he asked her if things were ok between them. Rather than answer the question directly, Nora softly smiled and told him that she would see him at home later that evening. \n\n\nJessica went to B.E. to talk to Natalie about the article that Todd printed in his paper about their father. Natalie tried to calm her sister down, but Jess insisted on speaking with Clint herself. Before she could march out to do that, Jared walked into Natalie's office. Natalie was quick to point out to Jessica that Jared had supported Clint's actions completely. Jared readily admitted that he felt that Clint had done the right thing under the circumstances. He understood Clint's desire to save his family from financial ruin and admired the lengths that Clint was willing to go to in order to prevent disaster from happening. Just then Natalie was interrupted by a phone call. As Jared and Jess listened in, it became clear that Natalie was learning about Talia and John's rendezvous at the motel the night before and Antonio's untimely arrival. After Natalie ended the call with her friend at the police station, she started to share the details of the conversation with Jess. Jared wasn't interested in listening to Natalie gossip about her ex so he quickly changed the subject. A few minutes later, Jess dashed off, wanting to be there to welcome Nash home. Once Jared was alone with Natalie, he didn't waste any time revisiting the subject of John. He was curious what Natalie intended to do next. Natalie realized that Jared was jealous. \n\n\nAt the police station, things did not go well for Talia. She approached Antonio as he stepped out of Ramsey's office, desperate to talk to him. Ramsey had primed Antonio well just moments before with another one of his manipulative friendly chats so that everything Talia said only infuriated Antonio more. Antonio tried to walk away but Talia was determined to find a way to work things out. Finally, Antonio had enough and turned on Talia. Things took an ugly turn when Antonio accused Talia of trying to sleep her way through the police station. By this time, both Antonio and Talia's raised voices had attracted quite a few onlookers, including a very self satisfied Ramsey. A short while afterwards, Jessica arrived at the police station. She was looking for Antonio. Talia thought it was the height of hypocrisy that Jessica would show up to check on Antonio, given her own history of cheating on Antonio. Talia told her that she felt Jessica was the reason that Antonio was never able to fully trust Talia. Just then Antonio walked up. The irony didn't escape him. He found it ludicrous that two women who didn't want him were standing around arguing over him. Talia walked away, fed up with everything, while Jessica remained behind to talk to Antonio. He appreciated her concern, but he declined her offer of a sympathetic ear. \n\n\nJohn found a chilly reception at the diner after Cris heard the details of John's encounter with Antonio the night before. Bo's timely arrival kept things from escalating into a physical altercation. It didn't stop Cris from throwing John out of the diner and making it clear that he was not welcomed back. Bo tried to talk to John, but John wasn't in the mood to share. After he left the diner, John headed over to B.E. to see Natalie. Natalie's concern for John was evident from the moment he stepped into her office. As Natalie and John talked, their deep friendship and affection evident in every softly spoken word and touch, neither realized that Jared was standing just outside the door taking everything in and looking none too pleased about any of it. \n\n\nBefore classes, Markko and Cole talked about Cole having gone to see Todd the night before. Markko tried to caution his friend not to push Todd too far and urged him to give Starr's father some space. Cole made it clear that he wasn't afraid of Todd but he didn't want to make things worse for Starr. He also took Todd's threats about sending him to jail seriously. Cole seemed resolved to abide by Todd's stipulations concerning his daughter. Elsewhere at school, Starr stood by her locker looking through the abortion pamphlets she had recently picked up. Langston soon joined her. As the two friends discussed Starr's situation, Starr revealed that she had made the decision to have an abortion. Langston seemed disappointed. Starr sensed her friend's hesitation and asked for reassurance that she wasn't going to tell anyone about Starr's pregnancy. Langston asked Starr when she intended to tell Cole. Starr told her that she didn't have any intention of telling Cole about the baby because it would just make things worse. The reason she decided to have the abortion, Starr revealed, was to keep Todd from getting the ammunition he needed to have Cole thrown in jail or worse. Langston saw the truth in Starr's words and offered the reassurance her friend needed. Later, Starr ran into Cole in the hallway. He told her that he loved her and would wait for her until they could be together. Starr was overwhelmed by emotion and quickly walked away, fighting back tears. \n\n\nNora decided to indulge in some comfort food at the diner after her encounter with Clint. Cole soon joined her and they chatted a bit about his situation with Starr and Todd. A short time later, Ramsey strolled into the diner. He made his rounds. His first stop was at Nora's table to question her ethics and whether or not she would be able to do her job effectively in regards to Clint and any possible criminal wrongdoing. Nora dismissed Ramsey without dignifying his insulting questions with answers. Ramsey then found Cole who was trying to stay out of the corrupt commissioner's sight. Cole was rattled by the realization that Ramsey had been watching him very closely and knew some of his secrets. Before Ramsey walked away, he warned Cole that he should watch his step. \n\n\nAt home, Starr revealed her plans to Langston. Starr asked Langston to be her decoy that very night so that Starr could sneak out to an abortion clinic. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr agonizes over the decision to have an abortion. Langston tries to get her to think of Cole. Its his baby too. Starr is frightened that Todd will put Cole in jail if he even knows about the baby. She asks for Langston's support. Talia faces Antonio in the squad room. He tells her that everything she did was just an act and he wonders if she'll do the whole squad now. She shoves him and walks off. Ramsey watches from the doorway. Nora confronts Clint about the article in the Sun. They argue but then apologize. Clint asks if they are okay now and Nora says she'll see him at home. John stops by the diner and tells Cris abut what happened at the motel with Talia and Antonio. Cris is ready to fight him but Bo walks in and breaks it off. Bo goes to BE and makes peace with Clint about working there. John stops by Natalie's office. She comforts him as Jared eavesdrops. Starr figures out a way to slip out of the houses so she can go get an abortion.",
