    "soap_central": "\n Renouncing Satan...Or Not \n\n\nWhile waiting for Chloe's christening at the church to begin, Jessica and Chloe paid a visit to Nash's grave. On a visit to the graveyard himself to \"talk\" to Wes, Brody overheard Jessica mention the boy she met and how things didn't work out. Inside the church, Clint thanked Charlie for allowing him to talk to Viki about his problems and admitted that he hadn't had a chance to talk to Nora. Jared and Natalie continued to second-guess their decision regarding Hope and Chloe. \n\n\nBrody apologized again for hurting Jessica and asked for her forgiveness. Wanting to celebrate the day without a heavy heart, Jessica agreed to his request. She turned down his appeal that they remain friends, declaring that it was too difficult. They missed each other, though, they concurred. \n\n\nMichael and Marcie arrived and agreed that they were having a difficult time, but feeling happy just the same. Michael couldn't help but remember losing Tommy. Jared told his father that the secret he had mentioned was under control and he was following the advice of the \"greatest good for the greatest number.\" He was sure that his secret was safe. \n\n\nAt the same time Natalie told Viki that the decision for her and Jared to be Chloe's godparents had taken so long because they had to \"settle some things.\" A confused Viki wanted clarification and Natalie claimed they had to resolve their past issues with Jessica. With Jessica being such a wonderful mother, Natalie vowed to \"have her back\" and make sure that Jessica would get to keep her kids. Startled, Viki wondered what her daughter was talking about. Natalie quickly assured her that she was only worried that Jessica could one day have a relapse. \n\n\nStarr was surprised when Cole showed up at La Boulaie to see her. He admitted that the best moment of his life was seeing Starr come down the stairs after Zach held her hostage. They both confessed to suffering from nightmares after the experience. They thought it was a miracle that Cole had even been at Todd's place and Starr wanted to know why he was there. Cole admitted that he had been there to tell Todd about Starr and Schuyler because he had been worried about her. \n\n\nAn angry and frantic Starr picked up her phone to check on Schuyler, which infuriated Cole in return. Explaining that he felt that he had to stop them because Schuyler was too old for Starr and was using her, he pulled out Starr's locket instead. The argument was avoided and an overjoyed Starr asked Cole to put it around her neck. Wondering where he had found it when she had looked everywhere, Cole admitted to picking it up off the floor at Todd's. \n\n\nStarr revealed that she had learned that their baby's cause of death was not what they had been told. An upset Cole wanted to pursue it, but Starr felt it too gruesome to exhume the baby's body. She told him it wouldn't bring Hope back. Cole felt that they had a responsibility to their daughter. Starr remembered the christening and departed. \n\n\nLangston realized that there was something Markko wasn't saying when he told her about his visit to Cole at the rehab facility before school. She guessed that Cole was still using drugs, but Markko was quick to defend his friend. Managing to weasel it out of Markko, Langston could hardly believe her ears when she heard that he had given his own sample for Cole's surprise urine test. \n\n\nLangston was angry and did not believe Cole's claim that he had taken pills after Zach knocked him out. She tried to explain that Cole was an addict and that addicts lied, though Markko kept making excuses for his best friend. Langston agreed that she would do anything for Starr, but felt Markko and Cole's situation was different. \n\n\nAs the couple talked, Lola lurked nearby and listened in. Wandering over, she offered to clear up the misunderstanding they had all had. Markko and Langston refused to listen to her. Vehemently, Langston snarled that her cousin would never get between her and her man. As the couple walked off, Lola vowed to destroy Langston. \n\n\nAt the police station, John, Nora, and Bo pondered the evidence of the knife found in Zach's room and its lack of prints. Upon Bo's questioning, John admitted that the knife probably wouldn't prove anything and that Zach's behavior at Todd's house was not that of a serial killer. Had it been Zach, he would have killed Todd and Starr, not merely taken them hostage, John confidently told them. He also knew for a fact that T\u00e9a did not kill Janet. \n\n\nSuddenly, Nora remembered the christening and made a call to Clint. She explained that she and Bo would not be able to get to the church because they had a major break in the case. Clint cut her short and hung up the phone abruptly. Bo commended John for marrying Blair, but told him to watch his back because Todd wasn't too pleased. \n\n\nOnce inside his house, Todd ordered T\u00e9a to remove her clothes as he unbuttoned his shirt. \"I want you,\" he said matter-of-factly, as she refused. She pointed out that he merely wanted her to go to the judge about Blair and John's marriage. \"For a smart woman, you sure are stupid,\" Todd replied. As T\u00e9a weakly tried to stop Todd's advances, she suddenly jumped into his arms. \n\n\nThe pair made passionate love, but the afterglow was cut short as Todd jumped up and began to dress. He was headed to see the judge and wanted T\u00e9a to do the same. \n\n\nFirmly, T\u00e9a announced that she wasn't going to lift a finger to help Todd. Reminding her of their deal to get his kids back, Todd was surprised to hear T\u00e9a insist that she had never agreed to his offer. He thought it was implied, he responded. She asked him how it felt to be used and told him there was a difference between love and being a good father. She felt that he couldn't accept the possibility that Blair loved someone else, and he didn't deserve to be near his kids. \n\n\nA livid Todd listened as T\u00e9a sneered that she didn't have to make deals for sex and wouldn't do his bidding for one roll in the hay. \"We're done,\" Todd grumbled. T\u00e9a insisted she was fine with it, but wondered about him. Todd thought she was bluffing. He agreed the sex was excellent. T\u00e9a replied that she didn't want to throw it away, but that obviously Todd did. \n\n\nAs Chloe Victoria was christened, Jared and Natalie made their commitment as godparents. Starr walked in late. Jessica asked both Marcie and Starr to hold the baby at different times. As Jared and Natalie looked on, Starr wondered if the baby seemed familiar because they were related. Jessica hoped that Starr would be able to babysit sometime. \n\n\nMichael and Marcie invited Starr to lunch with them, but the teen declined. She felt that things were weird and reminded them that they had all last been there for Hope's funeral. Cole visited Hope's grave and promised to find the truth. Starr showed up and indicated that she needed to know, too. \n\n\nSitting in a pew with her girls after the christening, Jessica told them that there were lots of people to look after them if she wasn't able to. Brody looked on from the back of the church. She felt his presence, but when she turned around he was gone. She thought it was Nash, looking in on them. Jared and Natalie visited Nash's grave and vowed to take the secret to their own graves. They would protect Jessica from losing her baby. \n\n\nSinging John's praises for getting them the knife as evidence, Fish promised to quiet down and keep things to himself. Inside Bo's office, a forlorn Nora had news for the police commissioner. Blair's blood was found on the knife and after another check, a partial print had been found. It belonged to John.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica and all her family and friends get ready for baby Chloe's (really Starr's baby Hope's) christening. Natalie and Jared agree to be the god parents but both are uncomfortable knowing that they are stuck between a rock and a hard place not knowing whether to devastate Jessica by telling her her baby died or keeping it all a secret. Starr attends and she bonds instantly with the baby almost as if they know that they are mother and child. Marcie also seems to bond with Jessica's child in a similar manner. Langston finds out that Markko helped Cole falsify his drug test after Cole took pain pills. She reminds him if Nora were ever to find out, Markko could be in big trouble along with Cole. Lola overhears and knows that she can use that against them since they are both shunning her and she can't \"have\" Markko. Todd and Tea sleep together. He assumes that she will help him prove that Blair and John's marriage is a fake so he can get custody of his kids. But she tells him she won't be manipulated by him ever again. She leaves. And they both reveal that maybe they have feelings for each other more than either wants to admit. Bo, Nora, John and Fish all investigate the stabbings with the belief that Zach Rosen is the culprit. But John reveals that Zach is not.",
