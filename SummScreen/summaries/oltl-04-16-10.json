Cole denied that Hannah was responsible for Todd's attack on Cole and comforted Hannah with a hug.  Starr entered the apartment and saw the hug.\n\n\nCole insisted that the hug was not what it looked like, and Starr stated that she knew that.  When Starr asked Cole about his injured hand, Cole explained that Todd had gone to the apartment and had seen Hannah without her shirt.  Cole related that Hannah had spilled coffee on her shirt and had wanted to borrow a clean shirt.  Starr remarked that she was not shocked that her dad would be upset upon finding Hannah walking out of the bathroom in her bra.  Hannah stressed that it all had been innocent.  However, Starr defended Todd and exclaimed that he was just being overprotective.\n\n\nCole could not believe that Starr was defending Todd and told her what Todd had said about trying to get Starr away from Cole.  When Cole asked Hannah to confirm Todd's statements, Starr screamed, \"Don't even.  I don't need to hear from a complete stranger about my father.\"  After Starr claimed that Hannah and Cole were trashing Starr's dad, Hannah apologized for causing any trouble and left.  Starr then informed Cole that she was not mad at Hannah, she was mad at Cole.\n\n\nCole and Starr continued to argue over the situation, when Cole reminded Starr that it was her dad that was \"the bad guy,\" who was trying to rip them apart.  Hope began to cry from another room, and Cole left to check on her.\n\n\nIn bed at Eli's apartment, Blair continued to harp on Eli for being an hour late for their dinner date, but Eli reminded Blair that he had more than made up for it - and in more ways than one.  Eli asked, \"What more do you want from me, Blair?\"  Blair replied, \"Honestly, well, if you're going to keep making it up to me like you did last night, this morning, and just now, you can keep me waiting any damn time you want.\"  Eli explained that T\u00e9a had held him up, and that when T\u00e9a had fainted, Eli had taken her to the emergency room.  Blair speculated on whether T\u00e9a might be pregnant, too, and declared, \"I can't believe this.  First Marty, now T\u00e9a.  What - is there something in the water here?\"\n\n\nEli asked Blair about what T\u00e9a had mentioned about Todd being the love of Blair's life.  Blair insisted that Todd was the love of her life and stressed the \"was\" as in past tense.  Eli asked if he, Eli, could one day be that for Blair in the future tense.  Blair told him that she liked Eli very much, but that they only had been going out for a couple of months.  When Eli remarked that he thought that the two of them, Eli and Blair, could have something special together, Blair agreed.  Blair stated that she had to leave to have pizza with Jack.  Eli and Blair kissed.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Gigi asked Rex about Bo, and Rex informed her that Bo would be okay.  Rex also informed Gigi that it looked as if Allison had been telling the truth, and that he had found the stolen sample blood hidden by Stacy in his refrigerator.  Rex hoped for answers from the testing of the blood.  When Kyle greeted Rex and Gigi upon entering, Gigi asked Kyle about Sierra Rose.  Kyle reminded Gigi that she was Sierra Rose's family, and that she would be welcome to drop by Kyle and Fish's home at any time.\n\n\nRex asked Kyle about the results from running the tests on the blood, and Kyle informed Rex that \"Mitch Laurence is definitely not your father.\"  Rex had speculated that even though he was not Roxy's son, he thought there was a chance that he might still be Mitch's.  Kyle revealed that the stem cells that had saved Shane's life definitely came from Mitch.  Rex wondered how, and Kyle explained that statistically speaking, a match could be from outside of the family.  Rex, however, still wondered who his parents were.  Rex informed Kyle of Allison's claim to have stolen Rex in the hospital when he was a baby, and Kyle verified that Roxy never knew of Allison's plan.  Kyle was paged and left.\n\n\nGigi insisted that she would help Rex find the answers to his parentage for as long as it took.  Rex and Gigi discussed Nurse Wojciehowicz and, as Kyle had just returned, he mentioned that the nurse still worked in the hospital.  When Gigi questioned if the nurse would be the same nurse, Rex thought that she might, at least, be a relative.  Kyle then led in Nurse Wojciehowicz.\n\n\nDorian greeted Charlie in the restaurant, and after Dorian told Charlie that he looked \"snazzy,\" Charlie informed her that he was meeting with a developer for a job.  Dorian revealed that she was the developer.  Dorian admitted that she had asked her assistant to call Charlie under false pretenses, and that was because she needed a favor.  Charlie refused to do any more favors for Dorian after she has talked Charlie into shooting Mitch Laurence, which resulted in the shooting of Jessica.  However, Dorian claimed that she needed Charlie's \"construction expertise.\"  Charlie emphasized that he did not want to be manipulated again.  Dorian requested that Charlie look over Dorian's plans for a new city center that would be a venue of art, culture, housing, and employment and would create jobs, which would stimulate the economy.  And Dorian wanted Charlie to be in charge of the project.\n\n\nCharlie inquired if the project was legitimate and on \"the up-and-up,\" and Dorian responded, \"Of course.\"  Dorian asked about Viki, and Charlie admitted that he had not heard from Viki since she had put the divorce on hold and had gone to London.  Charlie sadly stated, \"So, at this point, I think I can assume that the marriage is over.\"  Dorian exclaimed that she was appalled at Viki's behavior.  Charlie said that he would never give up on Viki, but that \"the ball is in her court.\"\n\n\nCharlie asked Dorian why she wanted him for the project.  Dorian revealed that not only would the center help Charlie, but that it would help many others in the community.  However, Charlie wondered how Viki would feel if Charlie were working for Dorian.  Dorian then questioned when Viki would be returning, and Charlie answered that Viki would return soon for her family.  Dorian then stressed that Viki would return for her family but not for Charlie.\n\n\nDorian claimed that she was not trying to discourage Charlie or to trash Viki.  Dorian insisted that she and Charlie understood each other because of what they both went through with Mitch Laurence.  Dorian was certain that she and Charlie could both move forward by helping each other out and by undoing any harm that Mitch had done.\n\n\nIn Viki's kitchen, when Natalie was pounding on meat, she reflected back on her conversation with Marty about John not leaving Marty as long as Marty was pregnant.  Natalie then yelled to herself, \"I can't believe that I actually said that\" as Viki walked into the kitchen.\n\n\nNatalie greeted Viki with a hug and asked about Bree.  Viki admitted that Bree would be spending the night with Jessica at Clint's, since Jessica was still not back to being \"her old self.\"  Natalie informed Viki that Jessica still only remembered Christian, and that it must be very hard on Brody because he loved her so.  Viki said, \"She's lucky to have him.  I wish she knew it.\"\n\n\nNatalie informed Viki that Brody had been there for Natalie after Natalie had unfortunately had a \"run-in\" with Marty.  Natalie admitted to Viki what she had said about John not wanting to be with Marty at all if Marty had not been pregnant.  Natalie regretted that she had said that John only cared about the baby, not Marty.  Viki hoped that Natalie had apologized to Marty, but Natalie claimed that Marty had already left.  Viki asked if there was anything she could do to help.  \n\n\nWhen Natalie refused Viki's help, Viki stressed that Viki would always be there for Natalie if she needed her.  Viki then asked Natalie if Natalie was in love with John.  Natalie evaded the question by asking Viki about Charlie.  Viki claimed that she did not want to talk about Charlie, and Natalie stated that she did not want to talk about John, Marty, and the baby.  Natalie requested to go outside to get a breath of fresh air, and Viki thought that would be good for her.  As Natalie left, she said that she was very glad that Viki was home.\n\n\nIn Marty's office, Todd stormed in and demanded, \"What are you doing about your horn-dog son?\"  Todd then informed Marty that he saw Cole with \"his half -naked girlfriend\" and claimed that Cole was \"the same horny pervert he's always been ever since he knocked up Starr and ruined her life.\"  Astonished, Marty remarked, \"A convicted serial rapist just called my son a pervert\" and insisted that when Todd threatened Starr to keep Cole away, Todd had actually thrown them together.  Todd yelled that Starr was still in high school and should not \"be saddled with some kid.\"  \n\n\nMarty then reminded Todd that the kid's name was Hope.  Marty also recollected that Todd had planned to kidnap Hope, so that Marty and Todd could raise her in New Mexico.  Todd stated that the kidnapping never happened, because John McBain rode in like a knight in shining armor.  Since Marty was pregnant, he insisted, Marty, \"McBain, and McBaby\" could live happily ever after.  Marty confirmed that, since Todd wanted an explanation of how she could be pregnant with a man that Todd detested, Marty and John were in love and were \"over the moon happy about\" the baby.  \n\n\nTodd insisted that Marty was not allowed to be happy when he was miserable.  Todd told Marty that he could not have T\u00e9a, because Dani knew what Todd had done to Marty.  Todd then demanded that Marty and Cole leave town.  Todd insisted that Marty never could get over Todd, and that she had returned to Llanview to get revenge.  Marty screamed that he was delusional.  Todd exclaimed that \"you made Cole seduce Starr just to stick it to me.\"  Marty simply asked, \"And what if I did?\"\n\n\nMarty yelled that she must have been \"a genius\" to use her son as a weapon to get Starr pregnant by the son of Todd's rape victim.  Marty was outraged that Todd would blame Marty and Cole for Todd's problems.  Marty declared that Cole did not ruin Starr's life, and that Marty did not ruin Todd's life.  Todd did that all by himself.\n\n\nTodd then calmly asked what he could do about Dani.  Marty said he had caused any problems with Dani, and that he needed to work that out himself.  Marty stated that she and John were having a baby, and that Cole and Starr were going to be together.  Marty exclaimed, \"We are all...all of us going to be happy, and there is nothing you can do about it.\"  Todd said, \"We'll see.  We'll see\" and walked out of Marty's office.\n\n\nViki called and asked if she could meet with Marty regarding Jessica.  Marty and Viki agreed to meet for an early dinner.\n\n\nNatalie tried to stop Marty as Marty was leaving the hospital, and Marty yelled, \"Not now.\"  Marty found an \"Out of Order\" sign on the elevator doors and flung her purse at the sign.  Marty elected to take the stairs.  As Marty started down the stairs, a pair of black-gloved hands pushed her shoulders.  Marty tumbled down the stairs and appeared unconscious at the bottom. \n\n\n",

Natalie and Marty are at odds. Todd comes to confront Marty and demands she gets out of town since he blames her for Dani hating him and after it appeared that Marty's son might be cheating on Todd's daughter. Starr admits to Cole that she is not entirely ok with her friendship with Hannah. Right when Natalie comes to see Marty, Marty takes the hospital stairs and falls down the stairs. Rex and Gigi are determined to get to the bottom of the mystery about who his real parents are who abandoned him at birth.
