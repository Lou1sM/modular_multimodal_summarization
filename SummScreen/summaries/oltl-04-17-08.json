    "soap_central": "\n\nNatalie was disbelieving when she learned that John was found in bed with Talia. He didn't want to discuss details with her, but instead, leaned in for a kiss. A very tense and spying Jared interrupted and attempted to hasten John out, citing business that he and Nat had to discuss. \"Uncle Jared is real protective,\" John voiced sarcastically. Nat insisted that she and John be left alone so that she could ask him about the almost kiss. John merely called it a mistake, though she quickly told him, \"You suck at lying.\" He answered that it wasn't about her and that he would explain someday. Upon John's departure, Jared demanded to know what was going on. Nat quite adamantly, and more than once, told him that none of it was his business. When she referred to him as Uncle Jared, he quickly ordered her to stop calling him that. \n\n\nJess headed to the police station to extend her sympathy to Antonio after hearing about John and Talia. Antonio told her that he and Talia were over and that he obviously had no luck with women. Comparing Sarah and Nash to John and Talia, he asked Jess if she really trusted her husband and cousin on their business trip. She assured him that they were not having an affair and that she and Nash were very happy together. \"So were we,\" Antonio replied. Later, Talia apologized to Antonio for being physical with him, though he quickly assured her he had it coming. Talia agreed to Antonio's request that they no longer talk to each other unless it involved work. Upset, she told John that she was not okay. They agreed to go out for drinks at Capricorn. \"It's hard on you. Wish you never started?\" John asked her. She wished it were easier while John told her that they had to do the right thing, even if people were going to get hurt in their small town. \n\n\nSarah and Nash headed home. She reminded him that she was not able to work for him as she already had a full time job that she enjoyed, and a boyfriend who was her boss and someone she liked working with. Nash suggested she start her own business as an events planner. They checked their phone messages when their plane landed and Sarah learned that she had quite a few from Natalie. She expressed her interest in working with Nash in the future. \n\n\nBlair ran into Cris at the diner and mentioned that she was trying to get hold of Sarah for work scheduling. She asked if Sarah had run off with Nash; Cris found this less than amusing, even though she assured him she was joking. She pointed out that Cris actually looked worried. Nearby, Markko and Cole talked about extra practice that Cole was thinking about skipping. He felt that something was wrong with Starr as he could read it on her face. Jess arrived to wait for Nash and she confessed to Cris that she had seen Antonio. She felt bad and had really wanted him to be happy. Cris guessed correctly that she wanted that so that she wouldn't feel guilty any longer. He told her to focus on her own family. Blair stopped to have a chat with Cole and, while she understood his and Starr's feelings, she also wanted him to heed her husband's warnings or he'd end up in prison and still not get to see Starr. While she didn't agree with Todd's methods, they would have to wait it out and only hoped that they could all get past \"that night.\" She acknowledged that Starr was feeling as miserable as Cole. \n\n\nTodd pumped Shaun for information on Starr's day though Shaun advised him that he had to wait outside while Starr attended school. Todd only wanted reassurance that she hadn't spoken to Cole. Upstairs, Starr asked Langston to switch places with her so that she could travel to New Jersey for an abortion. She was already prepared and had a wig, a favorite outfit and hat in a bag for Langston. Langston was leery of the plan and didn't think that Starr could go through with it herself. Starr strongly told her that she had to. She also had a secret weapon-Jack! Langson didn't think that would work but Starr pointed out that \"he's a Manning and he knows how to lie.\" She also had something on her little brother-he dented his dad's car with his skateboard. She asked Jack to distract Shaun so that she and Langston could leave. He told his sister he understood and assured her that she owed him. She promised to be Jack's slave for life. Starr told Langston that she would never forget her best friend's help, as she also provided the address of the clinic where she was headed. Jack did his part with his baseball bat and ball and Starr and Langston finally managed to get out of the house, though with some difficulty. Lee Ramsey, summoned by Todd, rang the doorbell just as Langston/Starr was leaving but once he headed to the study, the coast was clear. Blair arrived home just as Starr/Langston was about to head out but she, too, headed for the study and the coast was clear once again. \n\n\nJared wanted to know if Natalie wanted to get back together with John. She had some snide comments for him, wondering if he wanted her with him, because it was too late, what with his going after Buchanan money. He hastily denied being in it for the money. She angrily informed him that he knew nothing of her relationship with John. He thought that maybe there would be someone else in her future. Sarah arrived just as Nat was about to be kissed for the second time, as Jared backed off abruptly. Nat reprimanded Sarah for missing company business since she was a board member. Sarah attempted to convey that she was out of town working, for only two days, but Nat hardly let her speak. She practically bit Jared's head off also, when he tried to interject. Finally, Sarah signed the proxy. \"Why does this town have to be so incestuous?\" Sarah wanted to know. She swore she did nothing wrong. After she was gone, Jared asked Nat if they could go back to where they were. They were \"nowhere,\" she told him. He disagreed. They had never been \"nowhere.\" \n\n\nAt the diner, Antonio told Cris to watch his back, because of Sarah hanging around with Nash. Cris could hardly believe that his brother was seriously warning him, and assured him that he trusted Sarah completely. Nash arrived to meet Jess and, watching them, Antonio pointed out that the town was just too small for him. Sarah arrived, thrilled to see Cris. She and Nash had some leftover business to take care of. \n\n\nTodd handed Ramsey copies of statements that he and Gigi made regarding his \"misdeeds.\" He explained that should anything happen to either of them, those statements would turn up and have him put in jail. Ramsey assured Todd that he had \"bigger fish to fry\" and that Todd was hardly a blip on his radar scale. Blair was not happy to find the police commissioner in her house. Todd assured her that there was nothing to worry about. They confirmed that Starr had headed to school for drama club and since they had some time alone, they headed upstairs. \n\n\nLangston made it to school where Markko mistook her for Starr. Stunned when he realized it was Langston, he demanded to know what was going on. He mentioned Cole seeing Starr's car in the parking lot. Speechless, Langston froze when Cole appeared. He decided to risk it to see what Starr was hiding. He, too, was startled when Starr turned out to be Langston. He waited for answers. Langston stuttered that she and Starr were just playing around. \n\n\nStarr waited, crying at the bus station and alone. As her bus was called for boarding, she headed towards it. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr is ready to take a bus to Atlantic City to have the abortion. And she has a plan to have Langston wearing a \"Starr wig\" so that everybody will think she is Starr. But there plan is not likely to work when both Marco and Cole see Langston at school dressed as Starr, know that Starr is gone and ask what is going on. Antonio is very suspicious of not only John but of Nash. He warns Cristian and Jessica both that Nash takes women from their men. Nash and Sara return from their trip to Napa and return to their respective partners. But they clearly look like they might be more than business associates. Natalie confronts Sara for going off with Nash. And it looks like she might be avoiding dealing with her feelings regarding Jared.",
