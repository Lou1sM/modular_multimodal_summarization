Cole was shocked when Starr informed him that she had a change of heart and wanted to investigate their daughter's death. Acknowledging that she understood Cole's pain, Starr said that she wanted to help him find peace by learning what had happened to Hope. \n\n\nAs Starr wept, Cole wiped a tear from her face. Starr made Cole promise to never reveal that they were investigating Hope's death. She didn't want to bring any unnecessary pain to either of their families or Marcie. \n\n\nInside Shane's hospital room, Marcie tried to help cheer up a nervous Shane. When Marcie mentioned that Gigi and Rex were a happy couple, Gigi ran out of the room in tears. Shane told Marcie that something terrible was going on between his parents. \n\n\nMarcie located Gigi in the hall and attempted to comfort her. Upon learning that Gigi and Rex had broken up, Marcie urged Gigi to give the relationship another chance. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Stacy complained while Mike prepared her for her medical procedure. Terrified because she hadn't heard from Roxy or Kyle, Stacy questioned exactly how long the procedure would take. Mike informed her that it would take approximately an hour to retrieve a blood sample. After Mike left the room, Stacy placed a call a frantic call to Roxy and demanded that she return to the hospital at once with John Doe's blood sample. As Stacy argued with Roxy, Rex interrupted. \n\n\nAt the long-term care facility, Roxy watched nervously as Kyle retrieved a blood sample from the mysterious comatose patient. Roxy was angered when Stacy phoned and demanded that they speed up the process. During the procedure, a nurse entered the room and demanded to know what was taking place behind the curtain that covered John Doe. \n\n\nRoxy attempted to distract the nurse, to no avail. Kyle managed to hide his equipment as the nurse entered John Doe's resting area. Unaware of Roxy and Kyle's scheme, the nurse told them that John Doe had no brain activity. After collecting the blood sample, Roxy and Kyle headed off to Llanview Hospital to switch the samples. \n\n\nLater, John Doe's brain activity appeared to make some improvement. \n\n\nAfter assuring Stacy that he hadn't heard any of her conversation, Rex thanked her for donating her bone marrow to Shane. Rex told Stacy that he was grateful to Stacy and had no idea how he would ever repay her for her kindness. With a sly grin, Stacy replied, \"We'll think of something.\" \n\n\nAs Stacy tried to convince Rex that she wanted to help Shane more than anything, Schuyler entered the room and interrupted the discussion. Schuyler handed Stacy flowers and insisted that he had come to check up on her before she underwent the transplant procedure. Appearing uncomfortable by Rex's presence, Schuyler mentioned that he and Stacy were living together. Stacy immediately informed Rex that she and Schuyler were just friends. Crushed, Schuyler told Rex that he wished Shane a speedy recovery and quickly excused himself. \n\n\nAfter Schuyler's departure, a nervous Stacy insisted that she moved in with Schuyler after Gigi had kicked her out of the house. Claiming that she would do anything to save Shane's life, Stacy used the opportunity to speak negatively of Gigi's behavior toward Rex. \n\n\nIntroducing himself as Stacy's friend, Schuyler interrupted Gigi and Marcie's discussion. Upon learning that Schuyler had witnessed Rex inside Stacy's hospital room, Gigi grimaced. \n\n\nRoxy and Kyle arrived at the hospital. Handing Kyle a phone number, Roxy insisted on switching the blood samples and asked Kyle to page the number immediately. Kyle complied with Roxy's wishes. \n\n\nAs Roxy rushed off, Schuyler observed Kyle carrying the container that he had used to transport the sample. When Schuyler made a remark about the case, Kyle appeared quite nervous. Schuyler told him to relax and stated that he was only joking. An anxious Kyle rushed off. \n\n\nBack inside Stacy's room, Rex continued to thank Stacy for her unselfishness. As Rex placed his hand over Stacy's, Gigi appeared and gave Stacy a disgusted look. As Rex listened, Stacy explained to Gigi that the procedure had been difficult to endure but she was determined to save Shane. Giving Stacy a look of disgust, Gigi declared that she was only concerned with Shane getting well. When Mike entered the room and attempted to collect Stacy's blood sample, Stacy insisted that they wait for Roxy. \n\n\nBursting into the room, Roxy claimed that Shane was scared and needed his parents. As Gigi and Rex rushed off to see Shane, Mike received a page. Alone together, Roxy quickly switched John Doe's sample with Stacy's sample. A vindictive Roxy tossed the bag that contained Stacy's sample of blood under Stacy's bed sheets. \n\n\nUnable to reach the person who had paged him, Mike returned and collected the sample. After Mike had left, Stacy demanded to know what Roxy intended for her to do with the sample. Exiting the room, Roxy replied, \"It's all yours! You figure it out!\" Disgusted, Stacy tossed the sample of blood in the trash. Standing in the doorway, Schuyler questioned what Stacy was doing. \n\n\nLater, Rex and Gigi sat with Shane as he prepared to undergo his operation. Shane told his parents that he knew he would get better. When Shane mentioned that he was glad that his Aunt Stacy was in his life, Gigi rushed out of the room. \n\n\nAs Gigi sat outside Shane's room, Roxy approached and encouraged her to tell Rex the truth about Stacy's blackmail, immediately following the transplant. \n\n\nAt the police station, Bo and Nora were dumbfounded to learn that along with traces of Blair's blood, John's fingerprints had also been uncovered on the knife that had been discovered in Zack Rosen's hotel room. When Nora and Bo informed Fish and Talia of the news, Fish immediately defended John and insisted that someone was attempting to frame John for the murders. \n\n\nMayor Lowell stormed into the station and demanded that Bo arrest John for the murders. Lowell insisted that John had stabbed Blair and then married her so that she couldn't testify against him. Citing that there was no real evidence to tie John to the recent murders, Bo refused to arrest John, but agreed to bring him in for questioning. \n\n\nAfter the mayor had left, Bo said that he believed that the mayor was convinced that John had set a trap for Zack. Nora argued that John had no motive and there was no evidence that could place John anywhere near Zack's hotel room. \n\n\nRealizing that Talia and Fish were withholding information, Bo instructed his officers to come clean. Talia admitted that John had placed the breaking and entering call from Zack's hotel room. Both Bo and Nora were angered to learn that Fish and Talia had been giving John insight on the case. Bo ordered Talia and Fish to bring John in for questioning at once. \n\n\nAfterward, Bo told Nora that he was certain that someone was attempting to frame John for murder. Agreeing that John hadn't murdered Lee Halpren and Wes Granger, and had nothing to do with Blair's stabbing, Nora struggled to come up with who could be the killer. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, John returned home to find Marty waiting for him. When Marty mentioned that she needed to speak to him, John assumed that her encounter with Zack had brought back memories of the rape. Marty was surprised when John related that he wasn't convinced that Zack wasn't the killer. Citing that John would never rest until the people he loved were safe, Marty was certain that John would find the person responsible for the murders. Outside of La Boulaie, an unknown person observed Marty and John. \n\n\nMarty insisted that she and John speak on the balcony. Marty stated that she didn't want Starr to return home and overhear their conversation. Marty informed John that Starr was involved with her teacher, Mr. Joplin. \n\n\nSuddenly, John felt the presence of someone. Pushing Marty inside the house, John instructed her to lock the doors while he investigated. As John searched the grounds, Talia and Fish arrived at La Boulaie to bring John in for questioning. While Talia checked for John's car in the driveway, Fish knocked on the front door. Fish asked Marty if she knew John's whereabouts. \n\n\nTalia walked around the back of the estate, and someone approached her from behind. Talia attempted to defend herself, but an unknown person attacked her. As John continued to search the grounds, he spotted blood on the ground. Walking toward the pool, John observed a body in the water. Shocked, John pulled an unresponsive Talia from the pool.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Nora inform Talia and Fish that only John's finger prints were on the murder weapons. Yet nobody believes that for a minute and they believe that John was set up. The mayor obviously wants to nail John. Outside the house, somebody is spying upon John and Marty while they talk and he admits to her that the evidence proves that Rosen did not stab anybody. Starr concludes to Cole that she's changed her mind about letting Hope's mysterious death go. They are going to investigate and find out how she died. Yet, they will not let anybody else know what they are doing. Roxy and the lab technician manage to successfully find the bone marrow of Rex's biological father, sneak it out of the place they found it and bring it to the hospital right before Stacy has to go through with the procedure. Rex and Gigi are still ready to do whatever they need to do in order to save Shane but are very angry at each other.",
