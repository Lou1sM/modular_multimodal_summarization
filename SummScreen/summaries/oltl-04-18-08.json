While Layla and Dorian both attempted to persuade her to let the issue of Shane's father rest, Adriana was determined to prove Gigi a liar. Claiming that Gigi was trying to sabotage her wedding, Adriana insisted on traveling to Michigan and speaking with Brody's parents. Adriana revealed that she and Layla would pretend to be good friends of Gigi's and learn the truth about Shane's paternity. When Layla continued to question how Adriana would extract such intimate information from Brody's parents, a defiant Adriana stated that she was just like her mother and could get the truth out of anybody. As Dorian appeared frustrated by Adriana's persistence, Layla seemed shocked by the change in her friend's behavior. Layla worried Adriana's plans would backfire. \n\n\nAt Buchanan Enterprises, Jared asked Gigi to take some important paperwork to Rex at his loft. Gigi attempted to avoid interacting with Rex by making up excuses, but Jared requested that she assist Rex in obtaining information vital to B.E. After claiming that she needed to hurry home to Shane, Gigi's plans were thwarted when Viki and Charlie arrived with Shane and requested to take the child to a baseball game. Excited, Shane showed Gigi the excellent grade he received on his school project about his father, the war hero. When Jared congratulated Shane on having such a great dad, the little boy exclaimed that his father would always be his hero. Affected by Shane's words, sullen expressions crossed the faces of Gigi, Charlie, and Jared. Forced to meet with Rex, a reluctant Gigi headed to the loft. Charlie stole a moment alone with Jared, and questioned him about his relationship with Natalie. Charlie wondered how Jared could consider pursuing Natalie after revealing his misdeeds to her. As Jared insisted on winning Natalie over, Charlie worried about the possible outcome. \n\n\nBefore heading to the game, Charlie, Viki, and Shane arrived at the diner. Charlie had promised Roxy that he would meet with her and Dorian to make last-minute wedding changes. When Viki questioned whether or not she should be present, Charlie insisted that she join them. While waiting for the group to arrive, Charlie and Viki discussed the love they shared for one another. When Viki mentioned the conversation she observed Charlie having with Jared earlier at B.E., Charlie told her that he was telling Jared how special Viki was to him. Viki admitted to Charlie that she didn't care for Jared in the beginning, but felt he was proving himself to be a true Buchanan. A look of guilt crossed Charlie's face. \n\n\nRex and Natalie met at the diner to discuss wedding details. As a nervous Rex pondered over the upcoming nuptials, Natalie continued to think of her last (near intimate) encounter with Jared. After observing Rex's uneasy demeanor, Natalie questioned what was bothering him. Rex explained that he was worried by Adriana's recent behavior. Rex was bothered by Adriana's decision to exclude Marcie form the bridal party, and worried what her reaction would be to the news that he had invited Gigi and Shane to attend the ceremony. Rex revealed his concern that Adriana was beginning to act like Dorian. When Natalie chastised Rex for continuing his friendship with an ex lover, Rex questioned her behavior with past lovers as well. Frustrated, Natalie left for B.E. in a hurry. \n\n\nNatalie was upset to find Jared in her office. As Jared flirted with Natalie, she warned him to keep his distance. Jared questioned why Natalie was actually keeping his secret. Jared was convinced that Natalie still had feelings for him. Natalie reminded Jared of his scam and stated that she detested him. \n\n\nWhen Rex arrived home, Adriana informed him that she and Layla were going on a business trip. Rex was upset to learn that Adriana planned to leave that night. Dorian and Layla watched as Adriana convinced Rex that the trip was necessary to secure their future. After Dorian left to meet Roxy at the diner, Rex expressed his fear about the wedding plans getting out of hand. \n\n\nAfter kicking Jared out of her office, Natalie continued to think about him. Upset that she couldn't keep her mind off of Jared, Natalie was frustrated when she heard a knock at her door. Believing it was Jared, Natalie yelled for him to go away. When the door opened and Miles stood there, an elated Natalie hugged him. Miles told Natalie that he hadn't seen her in awhile and suggested that they go out for a drink. As Miles helped Natalie with her coat, Jared peered through the door and looked upset. \n\n\nAs Adriana and Layla made plans, Adriana was disgusted when Gigi arrived and announced she needed to discuss B.E. business with Rex. Eager to get to work, Rex suggested Gigi prepare for the long evening ahead. As Rex sat close to Gigi, Adriana scowled at them. Upon learning that Rex had invited Gigi and Shane to the wedding, an infuriated Adriana told Layla she couldn't risk going to Michigan and leaving Rex alone with Gigi. Adriana asked Layla to keep an eye on Rex and Gigi while she attended to an important matter. After Adriana left, Layla sat nearby and kept a close eye on them. Feeling uncomfortable because of Layla's presence, Gigi tried to focus on her work. As Layla looked disapprovingly at Gigi, Rex whispered and told Gigi to ignore Layla. Sadly, Gigi told Rex that Layla didn't like her. Rex leaned close to Gigi and replied, \"But I do.\" Layla was appalled. \n\n\nUpon arriving at the diner, Dorian and Viki immediately exchanged cunning remarks. When Viki introduced Shane to Dorian, Dorian gave the child an annoyed glance. As Dorian discussed where the wedding would take place, she was surprised when Shane announced that he and his mother would be in attendance. Adriana interrupted the conversation and asked to speak privately with Dorian. Adriana informed her mother that Dorian would be going to Michigan with Layla; Adriana had already booked Dorian a ticket. As Adriana gave Shane a disgusted look from across the room, she told Dorian about Gigi's visit and explained why it was necessary for her to remain in town. When Dorian refused to go, Adriana reminded her mother of their deal-Adriana would forgive her for her past deeds if Dorian ensured Adriana's wedding took place. Adriana suggested that her wedding would fall apart if Dorian refused to take the trip. Feeling guilty, Dorian agreed to go to Michigan with Layla. Afterwards, both Dorian and Adriana left the diner. As discussion of the wedding continued, Roxy commented how lucky Rex was to have Adriana in his life. Viki, Charlie, and Roxy were stunned when Shane remarked that he didn't like Adriana. When Viki asked Shane why he would say such a thing, he told them that Adriana asked questions about his father all the time and that made his mother sad. \n\n\nAfter finding Langston dressed as Starr, Cole and Markko demanded answers from Langston. Although Langston continued to make up excuses for the ruse, the boys remained unconvinced. Realizing Starr was in trouble, Cole told Langston he would find out the truth for himself if Langston didn't come clean. Cornered, Langston handed Cole the contact information that Starr had given her. The paper only contained the address of the abortion clinic. When Cole inquired why Starr would travel to Atlantic City, Langston's only words to him were to hurry. Confused, Cole headed off to locate Starr. By distracting Shaun, Markko helped Langston leave the high school unnoticed and head for the diner to await word from Starr. \n\n\nA terrified Starr arrived at the abortion clinic. Trembling, Starr announced to the receptionist that she was there to receive an abortion. As Starr sat in the waiting area, she struggled with her decision to end her pregnancy. Starr became emotional as she looked around the room and observed the other patients. Meanwhile, Cole drove towards Atlantic City. As he exited the expressway, Cole made a wrong turn and had no idea where he was. Frustrated, Cole conceded that he was lost. As Starr was prepped for the procedure, she caressed a photo of Cole. Before the doctor began the procedure, she asked if Starr was ready. In tears, Star shook her head. \n\n\nBack at the loft, Layla was upset when Adriana informed her that she would be taking the trip with Dorian. When Layla questioned what Adriana was doing, Adriana said she couldn't leave Rex alone with Gigi and pleaded with Layla to join Dorian in Michigan. Reluctantly, Layla agreed. Moments later, Adriana interrupted Rex and Gigi and announced how happy she was that she didn't need to leave town. As Gigi watched, Adriana hugged Rex and glared at Gigi. Rex received a call from Roxy, requesting to meet with him immediately. Once Rex left, Adriana told Gigi, \"Stay the hell away from my man.\" Meanwhile, Dorian and Layla boarded the plane to Michigan. Dorian told Layla that they weren't leaving until they learned everything there was to know about Brody Lovett. \n\n\nLangston and Markko arrived at the diner. Believing Langston was Starr, Shaun entered and sat at a nearby table. As Langston kept her face covered, she told Markko that she hoped Cole found Starr in time. \n\n\nCole arrived at the clinic and asked for Starr. After realizing that he was in an abortion clinic, Cole began screaming Starr's name and banging on the door to her room. \n\n\n",

Adriana has some major trust issues involving Rex's situation with Gigi. She first wants Layla to accompany her to find out if Brody Lovett (Shane's supposed real father) really exists. But when she sees Gigi and Rex together, she is not able to go and leave them alone. So she tells Dorian she better go in her place with Layla to Michigan. Rex admits to Natalie that he is having some suspicions about what Adriana is doing behind his back. Natalie tells Jared she is not interested in him and never will be.
