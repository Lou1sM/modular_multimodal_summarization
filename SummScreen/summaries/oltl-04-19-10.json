    "soap_central": "\n \nAt the Palace, Viki looked surprised to see Charlie sitting at a table with Dorian. Dorian informed Charlie that it was his moment and that he should talk to Viki. Viki told Charlie that she had planned to call him, but she had just gotten back from London that morning. Dorian related that it was good to see Viki back in Llanview and that it would have been a blow to the community if she had decided not to return. However, it would have been a blow \"to some more than others.\"\n\n\nViki asked if the pair had been spending time together, which Dorian affirmed. She told Viki they had been helping each other out because \"that's what friends do.\" Viki apologized for interrupting but asked to talk to Charlie in private. Charlie wanted to clear the air about him sharing Dorian's company, but Viki didn't want to talk about Dorian, and Charlie agreed.\n\n\nCharlie asked Viki how she had found him. She let him know that she was actually there to meet with Marty to talk about Jessica's condition. Charlie hadn't seen Marty there but said that he would take a rain check for later to talk to Viki. Viki admitted that she had not only returned from London for Jessica, but for Charlie as well. \n\n\nAs Dorian spied on the pair, Charlie asked how London had been. Viki said that it had been lonely, even with her family around her. She confessed to thinking a lot about whether or not their marriage could be saved. Charlie confessed to the same and wondered what Viki had decided.\n\n\nDorian, wanting to hear that part of the conversation, shushed a woman talking loudly to Renee in the background. Dorian walked away, anyway, as Viki told Charlie that she hadn't figured out a solution. She declared that time and space just made things more complicated, but she missed him. Charlie confessed to missing her, too, and believed that there was a way to make their marriage work. Viki began to get upset and admitted that she was afraid of going through more hurt and disappointment.\n\n\nViki realized that they had both been through a lot since Jared had died but wondered if it was too much. She didn't know if she could endure something else causing Charlie to drink again. She admitted that she had returned because she had recognized that walking away from Charlie had been the biggest mistake of her life.\n\n\nViki explained about a side trip to Paris that she and Bree had taken. She had finally recognized her mistake when they had visited the Eiffel Tower. She went on to say that he was a builder at heart, and every time something went wrong with their relationship, he was the one to put it back together. She was scared when she had walked in the Palace and found Charlie sitting with Dorian with her hand on his, because Viki didn't want to live without him. She thought that they deserved a chance to rebuild and asked if he was willing. In response, Charlie kissed her.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Nurse Wojciehowicz entered and asked Rex and Gigi how she could help them. Rex wondered how long she had worked at the hospital in Llanview, to which she replied since she had gotten out of nursing school. Rex hoped the nurse could help him find his real parents. The nurse explained that he would have to go to the agency from which he had been adopted, but Rex gave her the details about the night he had been born. He gave a picture of Allison to the upset nurse, which jogged her memory of that night.\n\n\nThe nurse explained that she was supposed to have gone out with her husband for his birthday that night but had gotten called into work because of a huge accident. At one point during the night, she had gone outside to meet an ambulance. In the confusion, she had found a bundle on the gurney with no one around it. Suddenly, she had seen someone run to a car and get in. She had tried to yell to the person, but they had sped off.\n\n\nRex asked the woman to describe the person, but she disclosed that it had been dark and she hadn't even been able to make out whether it had been a man or a woman. Hours later, Allison had arrived to claim the baby as her own. Assuming that Allison had been the person in the car, the nurse had believed Allison when she had said that she had been young and scared, but had had time to think and had actually wanted her baby. Rex asked if Allison had given the nurse any proof of her parentage, but she admitted that she had been new at the time and had thought giving Allison the baby had been the right thing to do.\n\n\nThe nurse asserted that if she had known the truth, she wouldn't have given Rex to Allison, but Allison had seemed very sweet. Gigi assured the nurse that it wasn't her fault and that Allison might have hurt someone if the nurse had refused to give her the child. Rex again inquired about the person that had sped away in the car. Nurse Wojciehowicz apologized that she hadn't been able to make any details out, but she remembered that Rex had had something with him the night he had been in the hospital. The nurse had held on to it after all the years and went to get it to show Rex.\n\n\nWhile the nurse was out, Rex reasoned that maybe it was better that he didn't know who his real parents were. He wanted to stop looking because every clue he had gotten had led him to a dead end. He even suggested that his real dad could end up being worse than Mitch. As the nurse walked in, Gigi insisted that wasn't possible.\n\n\nNurse Wojciehowicz handed Rex an envelope. Rex opened it and took out a silver necklace with a half heart charm. Before leaving, the nurse told Rex that no matter who his real parents were, they would be proud of him because he seemed to have turned out all right. Rex was convinced that he was out of leads, but Gigi encouraged Rex that his real parents were still out there, waiting to be found.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Bo was on the phone when Nora walked in and caught him. Thinking he was talking to someone from the station, she reminded him that he shouldn't be working. As the pair started to talk about their upcoming nuptials, a surprised Matthew walked into the room and asked if he had heard them correctly. He was a little annoyed that it had taken them a couple of days to tell him but admitted that it was something he'd wanted for his entire life. Bo then asked Matthew to be his best man, which Matthew gladly accepted. As Matthew asked about Clint, Clint walked in, requesting to know what was going on.\n\n\nClint had arrived to give Asa's lighter to Bo and reminded him that there were cigars that went along with it. Nora told Matthew that he had homework to do, which a confused Matthew denied. However, he finally got the hint and left the room. Clint wanted to know what Bo and Nora wanted to talk to him about. Nora informed Clint that she and Bo were going to get married but that they hadn't planned it. A bitter Clint replied that it figured, and that things always \"just happened\" between the two of them.\n\n\nBo described how, after he had gotten shot, he had realized how much time he had wasted and that he didn't want to wait anymore. Nora explained that they weren't asking for a blessing but for peace between the three of them that included being a part of each other's lives again. She said the four of them, she and Bo, and Kim and Clint, should have dinner together soon. However, Clint informed the couple that he and Kim weren't together anymore.\n\n\nClint told them that they were free to say, \"I told you so,\" because he knew they were thinking it. He told them that it was no secret how they felt about Kim, but Nora insisted that they just wanted to see him happy. Nora queried if there were anything she or Bo could do for him, but Clint just wanted them to concentrate on their own marriage instead of his. He told Bo to enjoy the gift and left the room as Nora shook her head.\n\n\nBo couldn't help but to think about Kim and Clint. Nora related that, although most people, including her, had thought nasty things about Clint and Kim, she did think that they'd had a connection. Nora also believed that she and Bo were shoving their happiness in Clint's face, and she felt guilty all over again. Bo agreed but said Clint would move on soon.\n\n\nMatthew entered the room and asked how it had gone with Clint. The couple said that it had gone as well as it could have and that the wedding was still on. \"Good, so you won't have to return this box,\" Matthew said as he handed a bag to Bo. Bo took out the ring box and apologized for not getting on one knee \"this time.\" He slipped the engagement ring on Nora's finger, to Matthew's delight.\n\n\nAt the hospital, T\u00e9a literally bumped into Todd. She noticed that Todd was acting strangely so she asked him what was wrong. He played the question off and asked why T\u00e9a was there. She replied that she had a checkup, but she was fine, and told him not to change the subject. He finally let T\u00e9a know that Marty was his problem.\n\n\n\"You're at it again?\" T\u00e9a retorted. Todd sarcastically thanked her for the support. T\u00e9a made it clear that she was cynical because she was worried that another run-in with Marty would lead to yet another arrest. He asked why everything was always his fault. Todd explained to her how he believed Cole was cheating on Starr and said that it was Marty's fault. He said he thought Marty had returned to Llanview just to \"stick it\" to him and that everyone would be better off if she were dead.\n\n\nTodd left the hospital to sit at the bar at the Palace and drink. As the bartender asked if Todd wanted a refill, he had a flashback. He thought about Marty saying how, even though Todd was miserable, everyone else was going to be happy, and there was nothing he could do about it. Dorian was surprised to see Todd at the bar and sarcastically asked if he was there to atone for his sins.\n\n\nTodd told Dorian to get lost, but she insisted on knowing what \"evil plan\" of his had misfired. She told him to confide in her because no one would appreciate his agony more. Todd told Dorian to concentrate on her own life, and he left the Palace.\n\n\nAs Marty walked out of her office, she ran into Natalie, who intended to apologize. Marty yelled, \"Not now!\" and ran to the elevator. Marty was angry to notice that the elevator was out of order so she gave in and took the stairs. As she stood at the top of the stairs and tried to get something out of her purse, two black-gloved hands pushed her down the stairs. As she lay unconscious on the landing of the stairs, John, intending to check on Marty at the hospital, walked up and found her. He looked up and saw Natalie standing at the top of the stairs.\n\n\nAs John tried to wake Marty up, Natalie rushed down, asking what had happened. Natalie ran back up the stairs to get help. She found Greg at the nurses' station while he flirted with a nurse and told him what had happened. He hurried to the stairs with her. Greg and Natalie reached Marty and John as Marty stirred and woke up, although very groggy. While Greg determined that she had no serious injuries, the nurse entered, notifying them that a gurney was on the way.\n\n\nNatalie looked on while Greg checked Marty out. John asked if anything was in pain. Marty got upset and said she was cramping, and she thought she might be bleeding. When asked how she fell, Marty replied, \"I didn't fall. I was pushed.\" Greg insisted that Marty couldn't answer any more questions and wondered where her obstetrician was. John exited the exam room and demanded that the nurse call the doctor at home.\n\n\nOutside the room, Natalie asked about Marty. John said that she was banged up, but they weren't sure about the baby. Overhearing, T\u00e9a asked if there was something wrong with Marty. John said yes and that it hadn't been an accident. T\u00e9a looked nervous, obviously believing that Todd had had something to do with it.\n\n\nJohn informed T\u00e9a that Marty had been pushed down the stairs. Just as T\u00e9a asked who had done it, Marty's doctor arrived. John told her that he and Marty were worried about the baby and quickly ushered her into the room. Greg discussed Marty's minor injuries and said he was just about to check on the baby with a sonogram. As John tried to calm Marty down during the checkup, the doctor became silent. She couldn't find the baby's heartbeat.\n\n\nT\u00e9a opened the door to the staircase that Marty had fallen down and saw police tape marking it a crime scene. She flashed back to Todd's earlier, nasty words about Marty. \"What have you done?\" she said quietly. \n\n\n",

Todd has also informed Tea that he believes that Marty and her son are in town to get revenge upon him and he wants her dead. Viki comes back and tells Charlie she has her reservations about getting back together but wants to give them another chance. Bo and Nora are ready to get married. Matthew is happy but Clint is not. Rex and Gigi find the nurse who remembers when he got abandoned at the hospital as a baby. She does not have a clue who his real parents are. But she's kept a necklace with a moon and star that somebody left when Rex got left at the hospital as a baby.",
