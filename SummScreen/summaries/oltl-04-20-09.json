Feeling Gigi's pain, Roxy encouraged her to expose Stacy's scheme to Rex, once Shane had fully recovered. Recalling her promise to give up anything if God saved her son, Gigi insisted that she had to keep quiet about Stacy causing her breakup with Rex. Roxy assured Gigi that God would never want to destroy the love that Gigi and Rex shared for each other. Staring lovingly at Rex and Shane, an emotional Gigi promised that she would tell Rex the truth about Stacy's blackmail. \n\n\nIn her hospital room, Stacy tossed the plastic bag, which contained her blood sample, in the trash. Afterward, Stacy was startled to find Schuyler standing in the doorway. When Schuyler asked what Stacy had thrown away, she claimed that she had discarded a tissue. Pointing out that the container was a medical waste pail and not a refuse basket, Schuyler was convinced that Stacy was lying. In an attempt to deflect Schuyler's questioning, Stacy accused him of harassing her and being jealous of her relationship with Rex. Schuyler insisted that Stacy give up on her attempt to win Rex's heart, but Stacy refused. \n\n\nInside of Shane's hospital room, Gigi, Rex, and Roxy celebrated the success of Shane's transplant procedure. Although he couldn't promise that there would be no complications, Mike was optimistic and assured the family that the procedure had gone well so far. When Shane mentioned that he wanted to see Stacy, Roxy offered to locate her. As Shane fell off to sleep, Gigi promised her son that his parents would never leave him. Rex reached for Gigi and the two shared an embrace. \n\n\nRoxy barged into Stacy's hospital room and interrupted the argument between Stacy and Schuyler. Fed up with Stacy's antics, Schuyler stormed out of the room. Alone with Stacy, Roxy warned her that Gigi would tell Rex about her misdeeds. Stacy was certain that Gigi would never reveal her evil plot, but Roxy stressed that Stacy's days were numbered. \n\n\nWhile Stacy prepared her makeup, Schuyler returned to her room. When Stacy insisted that she needed to see her nephew, Schuyler suggested that she allow the child some time alone with his parents. Before exiting the room, Stacy reminded Schuyler that Shane was alive because of her good deed. \n\n\nWith a liquor bottle in hand, an intoxicated Roxy arrived at the long-term care facility. Hurling insults at the comatose patient, Roxy exclaimed, \"I got what I needed and I'll never have to see your ugly mug again!\" The comatose patient raised his arms and began chocking Roxy. Upon hearing Roxy's screams, the nurse entered the room and questioned what was going on. Roxy insisted that the coma patient had attacked her. Convinced that Roxy was drunk, the nurse dismissed her claims and ordered her to leave and never return. \n\n\nAlone, inside his darkened hospital room, the comatose patient lifted his arm in the air. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Gigi asked Rex if she could speak with him outside of Shane's hospital room. While Gigi struggled to tell Rex about Stacy's blackmail, Stacy peered around the corner and listened. As Gigi prepared to tell Rex the truth, Shane screamed out in pain. Gigi, Rex, and Mike ran to assist the little boy. As Mike examined Shane, Stacy eavesdropped from the opened door. Mike advised Rex and Gigi that Shane would have good and bad days. Mike assured the parents that he would manage the child's pain as best he could. \n\n\nWhile Rex was distracted by Shane's pain, Stacy approached Gigi and escorted her out into the hall. Stacy told her sister that she was aware that Gigi had nearly exposed Stacy's scheme to Rex and warned her against it. Suggesting that Shane might need another transplant, Stacy threatened to disappear if Gigi told Rex the truth. Stacy said that Gigi would be responsible for Shane's death. \n\n\nAs Stacy continued to pressure Gigi, Rex interrupted and asked Stacy if everything was okay. With a look of concern, Stacy asked Rex if Shane was feeling any better. When Rex informed her that Shane's pain had subsided, Stacy smiled and said that she knew the child would be fine. While Rex was appeared pleased with Stacy, Gigi gave her a look of disgust. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Schuyler entered the hospital room that Stacy had occupied. He reached inside the medical waste container and retrieved the bag that contained Stacy's blood. Schuyler placed the bag inside his knapsack. \n\n\nAs Rex, Gigi, and Stacy gathered inside Shane's room, Roxy returned. Realizing that Gigi hadn't told Rex the truth, Roxy pulled Gigi aside and questioned why she had chosen to remain quiet about Stacy's evil plot. In tears, Gigi told Roxy that she tried to tell Rex the truth but couldn't. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Stacy enjoyed her time with Rex and Shane. \n\n\nViki and Charlie enjoyed a meal at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9. While Viki mentioned the day's events, Charlie appeared troubled. Charlie said that things were different between them. He reminisced about their days in Paris, Texas. Viki told Charlie that she loved him. To her surprise, Charlie informed Viki that he wanted to live together. \n\n\nViki insisted that Charlie move into Llanfair. Citing that he was a simple man, Charlie was skeptical about living at the estate, but decided to comply with Viki's wishes. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Fish asked Marty if John was on the premises. \n\n\nMeanwhile, outside, John discovered Talia facedown in the pool with a knife in her chest. Fish arrived at the scene and observed John carrying Talia's limp body from the pool. As Fish looked on in horror, John told him that Talia was dead. \n\n\nAs Fish ran off to search the grounds for the killer, Marty was horrified to witness John leaning over Talia's dead body. John noticed that Zack Rosen's fraternity ring was on Talia's finger. When Fish returned and spotted the ring, he related that Zack's ring was last seen in the evidence room at the police station. \n\n\nTo John and Marty's surprise, Fish questioned if John had killed Talia. Fish explained that the knife that had been discovered in Zack's room had traces of Blair's blood and John's fingerprints. Marty couldn't believe that Fish suspected John of the murders. Fish stated that he didn't believe that John was guilty, but warned that the mayor had demanded that John be arrested for Blair's stabbing and the murders of Lee Halpern and Wes Granger. John insisted that Fish report Talia's murder to Bo immediately. \n\n\nAt the police station, Bo and Nora discussed the possibility that John had been set up. Mayor Lowell barged into the office and demanded to know why John wasn't in custody. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Fish warned John that Mayor Lowell would order his immediate arrest and that John would never get the opportunity to clear himself. Fish and Marty pleaded with John to escape in order to search for the real killer, but John refused. Fish placed a call to Bo and informed him of Talia's murder. \n\n\nBo, Nora, and the mayor arrived at the scene. Mayor Lowell ordered Fish to place John under arrest for capital murder. Bo, Nora, and Marty looked on as Fish read John his rights.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Charlie and Viki talk about where their relationship is going. And she invites him to live with her at Llanfair. The stabber is still on the loose. John, Fish and Marty discover that he's murdered Talia. Yet they still haven't a clue who he is. The mayor is on the warpath and ready to nail John for the murder. Fish and Marty urge John to run, but he does not resist arrest. When it looks as though everything has gone well for Shane after the bone marrow transplant, Roxy encourages Gigi to tell Rex what Stacy did and realize that they are no longer at her desperate mercy. But right when she's ready to do that, Shane has a fatal reaction to the treatment. At that point, Stacy reminds Gigi that she still needs her. Schuyler knows that Stacy is up to no good and notices that she may not have donated her own blood for that transfusion.",
