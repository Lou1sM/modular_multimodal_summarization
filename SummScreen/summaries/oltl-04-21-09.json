Bo assured Cris that Antonio had been notified; he was on his way back to Llanview. \n\n\nMarty asked Nora if she intended to charge John with Talia's murder. Nora admitted that she didn't think that John had committed the crime. Nora blamed the mayor for the arrest. \n\n\nMayor Lowell arrived at the police station a short time later. He informed Bo and Nora that he had written an announcement about John's arrest. Bo read the statement, which pretty much declared that John was the serial killer. Bo crumpled the piece of paper as he threatened to write his own press release. Mayor Lowell invited Bo to take his time; the mayor's statement had been sent to all of the media outlets. \n\n\nJohn sat behind bars in the Llanview jail. Zach wondered what had led to John's arrest, but John didn't volunteer any information. Later, T\u00e9a visited John in jail. She told him that Marty had asked her to represent John. T\u00e9a warned John that the police had a compelling case against him. Zach was elated when he overheard T\u00e9a mention that the police had found John's fingerprint on the knife used in Blair's attack. Zach believed that the evidence exonerated him of the murders. \n\n\nJohn insisted that he didn't have a motive to kill Talia. T\u00e9a revealed that the police suspected that the motive was tied into Marty. John declared that Talia was his friend. John was certain that Todd had framed John for the murder. He pointed out that Todd had been at Dorian's that day. T\u00e9a did not discount the possibility that Todd had framed John. \n\n\nJohn was curious about T\u00e9a's sudden change of heart in regards to Todd. T\u00e9a explained that she had been married to Todd twice; she didn't have any illusions about him. T\u00e9a was confident that she could successfully defend John against the murder charges. John agreed to let T\u00e9a represent him. He asked her to find a way to get him out of jail. \n\n\nShortly after T\u00e9a left, Marty paid John a visit. At the same time, Zach was being taken to his arraignment. Zach took the opportunity to taunt Marty. Marty ignored Zach's comments, but John attempted to reach through the bars to assault Zach. After Zach was dragged away, John confessed that he did not think that Zach was the killer. John also admitted that he didn't think Todd had committed the crimes, either. \n\n\nViki went to the Sun to talk to Todd about T\u00e9a. Viki asked Todd to stop playing games with T\u00e9a. She told him that she knew all about Todd's proposition to have a romantic relationship with T\u00e9a if she agreed to testify that John and Blair's marriage was a sham. Todd insisted that he was not playing with T\u00e9a's heart; Todd didn't believe that T\u00e9a had one. \n\n\nTodd went on to tell Viki that he had slept with T\u00e9a. Afterwards, T\u00e9a had made it clear that she would not hold up her end of the bargain. Viki applauded T\u00e9a's determination not to let Todd manipulate her. Todd vowed not to let it happen again. Viki observed that Todd had protested just a tad too much; Viki suspected that Todd was not as immune to T\u00e9a as he liked to believe. \n\n\nTodd snidely suggested that Viki find T\u00e9a so that the two of them could celebrate. He crudely offered to buy T\u00e9a a bikini wax for the occasion. Viki was even more convinced that Todd cared for T\u00e9a. Todd ignored Viki as he answered his phone. Todd's mood instantly brightened. \n\n\nAfter Todd disconnected the call, he informed Viki that John had been arrested. \n\n\nDorian was frantic when she raced into La Boulaie calling for Langston. Langston emerged from the living room, with Markko close behind. Dorian was relieved when she realized that Langston was fine. Dorian had been worried after she had arrived home to find the police swarming around the house. \n\n\nLangston told Dorian about Talia's murder. Dorian was shocked; she couldn't understand who would want to kill Talia. Ray and Lola joined everyone in the foyer. Dorian pointed the finger at Ray; reminding everyone that two people had been attacked since Ray had moved in. Dorian decided to postpone her trip to visit David in Los Angeles. \n\n\nEveryone adjourned the living room. Dorian immediately sensed the tension between Langston and Lola. Langston told Dorian about Lola's attempts to seduce Markko. Lola denied that she had pursued Markko once he had told her that he wasn't interested in her. Langston accused Lola of being a pathological liar. Lola assured Ray, and the others, that she had followed her father's advice. Markko refused to go along with the lie. He told everyone that Lola had continued with her unwanted advances. \n\n\nLola's temper flared when she realized that everyone believed Markko's version of events. Lola accused Markko of turning her father against her; she promised retribution then stormed out of the room. Ray followed his daughter, while Dorian consoled Langston. \n\n\nA short time later, Ray returned to the living room to apologize on his daughter's behalf. Dorian accused Lola of being a \"skanky ho.\" Ray didn't appreciate Dorian's heartless remarks. He reminded Dorian that Lola was a child. Dorian disagreed; she considered Lola a young woman. \n\n\nAfter Langston and Markko walked away, Ray admitted that he was hurt because his daughter had broken a promise. Dorian asked Ray what Lola had promised. Ray seemed reluctant to confide further, but Dorian prodded him. Eventually, Ray revealed that he couldn't ask Lola to deny her heart's desire if he was not willing to do the same. \n\n\nIn the foyer, Langston worried about Lola's threat. \n\n\nAt the rehab center, Rachel introduced herself to Cole. She told Cole that she was Nora's daughter and Matthew's sister. \n\n\nCole insisted that he wasn't a drug addict, but Rachel was steadfast in her desire to help Cole. Cole finally consented to working with Rachel; he didn't want to go through the process of having another counselor assigned to his case. \n\n\nRachel talked a bit about herself then told Cole about her three rules: total honesty, total commitment, and to follow the first two rules. Rachel then reviewed Cole's recent drug test. She wondered if Cole had asked someone to take the test for him. Cole became defensive as he denied the suggestion. Rachel pointed out that many addicts found ways to bypass their drug tests. She reminded Cole of the consequences if he failed to abide by the terms of his parole. \n\n\nRachel asked Cole if he had difficulty with withdrawal symptoms. Cole insisted that he had never suffered from any withdrawals, implying that he wasn't an addict. Rachel ignored the challenge. As their session came to a close, Cole tried to ask how Matthew was doing. Rachel made it clear that their meetings were only about Cole and Rachel, not Matthew. Cole opened the door to leave, but stopped short when he realized that Lola stood in the doorway. \n\n\nLola apologized to Cole, then turned her attention to Rachel. Lola revealed that Cole had convinced Markko to take Cole's drug test. \n\n\nLayla was rushing around her apartment, trying to get ready for a business appointment. She called Talia, but reached her voicemail. Layla decided to leave a message. She reminded Talia that she had promised to be home to walk the dog. Layla threatened to kill Talia if Layla was late for her appointment because of Talia's broken promise. \n\n\nAs Layla prepared to walk the dog, Cris knocked on the door. Layla was not in the mood to talk to Cris. She assumed he was there to see Talia. Layla told Cris that Talia wasn't home, then tried to leave. Cris stopped Layla. He gently broke the news about Talia's murder. Layla's welled up with tears, but she refused to believe Cris. She warned him not to be there when she returned from walking the dog. \n\n\nCris waited for Layla's return. Layla's pain was etched on her face. She told Cris that Talia had named their dog. The dog's name was Aziza; it was Arabic for 'beloved.' \n\n\nT\u00e9a talked to Nora about John's case. When Nora told her about the mayor's press release, T\u00e9a realized that Todd might know that John had been arrested. T\u00e9a decided that she needed to do damage control. As T\u00e9a walked away, she bumped into Todd. Todd smiled as he addressed T\u00e9a as \"honey\" then asked her what was new. \n\n\nBo accompanied Antonio to the morgue to view Talia's body.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John gets arrested for the murder of 3 people and the stabbing of Blair. Bo, Nora, Tea and Marty all want to help him. But there is no alibi for him or other suspect. The mayor is ready to nail him and announces that he's informed the media. Todd finds out and everybody knows what that will motivate him to do. Langston, Markko and Dorian all tell Lola she is a disgrace for attempting to seduce Markko. Cole has a drug counseling session with Rachel Gannon (Nora's daughter). She is ready to work with him and he trusts her. But right then, Lola enters the office to tell her she happens to know that Markko helped Cole falsify his drug test. Everybody is devastated by the death of Officer Talia Sahib and still clueless as to who killed her and the others.",
