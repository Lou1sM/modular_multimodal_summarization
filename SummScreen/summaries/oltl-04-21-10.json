    "soap_central": "\n \nBearing home-baked cookies for the recovering top cop, Destiny paid a visit to Bo's room at Llanview Hospital. She found Matthew there instead, and he explained that Bo and Nora were at a physical therapy session as part of Bo's recovery process. Matthew told Destiny that Bo wanted to be back in top form soon so he could remarry Nora, a piece of news which delighted the young girl. Unable to resist, Destiny asked Matthew if he'd be taking Danielle to his parents' second wedding. Matthew seemed anxious at the mention of Danielle and hesitantly said he hadn't asked her yet.\n\n\nDestiny quickly honed in on the source of Matthew's discomfort: Nate Salinger. Matthew claimed he wasn't jealous of the older boy but confessed that he'd been uncomfortable watching Nate get close to Danielle in rehearsals and called him a \"pretentious actor.\" Destiny told Matthew he was indeed jealous but comforted him by reminding him that they'd be able to make Danielle jealous as well -- by kissing during the play. She was crestfallen when Matthew dismissed her suggestion of \"kissing practice\" and said that it wouldn't be the same. After all, Matthew reasoned, Danielle knew he and Destiny were \"just friends\" and nothing more.\n\n\nNoticing Matthew's prom tickets, Destiny wondered if he'd asked Danielle yet. Matthew admitted he feared she wouldn't say yes, but Destiny swallowed her heartache and pushed him to pop the question and promised him that Danielle wouldn't turn him down.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Danielle rehearsed her lines as \"Starr\" in the mirror, while she recounted Todd's misdeeds to an invisible audience. As she read the lines, she grew repulsed by her father's lengthy rap sheet and broke character as she called Todd a jerk. Answering a knock at the door, she greeted Nate, who said that working alone wasn't cutting it; he needed to rehearse his lines with his scene partner. Danielle readily agreed to work with him.\n\n\nAs Nate entered the suite, he asked Danielle about her past before Llanview. Danielle explained that she'd left Tahiti to attend boarding school in London and recapped how she'd met Matthew and escaped the Warwick Academy. Nate concluded that Matthew really was her boyfriend, but Danielle seemed uncomfortable with labeling her and Matthew's relationship; they weren't merely friends, she said, but it was \"kind of more.\"\n\n\nNate agreed that \"boyfriend and girlfriend\" was an outdated concept. The teens discovered they shared similarly broken homes with bad role models for romance, but Nate admitted that his difficult father was nothing like Todd. He was at a loss to understand how T\u00e9a could've fallen for someone like Todd. Danielle said she didn't understand it, either, but nonetheless, \"it happens.\"\n\n\nThe kids began to rehearse their scenes as \"Starr and Cole,\" and Nate asked Danielle how he should touch her face in the scene at the hospital, where \"Cole\" examined \"Starr's\" injuries after her fall down the stairs. Unsettled by the intimate contact, Danielle allowed Nate to caress her cheek and her forehead then suggested she ask Starr about it for the sake of \"realism.\" Her mixed feelings deepened as the actors exchanged declarations of \"I love you\" as Starr and Cole.\n\n\nWhen the script reached a point where they were to kiss, Nate suggested they go for it and avoid awkwardness in future rehearsals. Danielle was unsure, but Nate was determined not to stumble in their readings with the full cast. Danielle warned Nate she'd only kissed one other guy, but Nate told her to relax and said the kiss wouldn't be real; they were only playing parts. Danielle agreed to the pretense, and they shared a kiss.\n\n\nAfter they broke away, Nate thanked Danielle for her help. Danielle suggested he leave before T\u00e9a walked in on them together; she feared T\u00e9a would be ready to give him the third degree. Nate said he'd save meeting T\u00e9a for another time, but he was curious to meet a woman who'd married Todd Manning. As Nate left the room with a secret smirk on his face, Danielle struggled with her emotions, shaken by their performance.\n\n\nAt the teens' apartment, Cole was dismayed by Starr's vow never to cut Todd out of her life. He reflected on his argument with Todd and how he'd been warned that Starr would always forgive her father. He reminded Starr that Todd wanted to destroy their relationship and would never give up on breaking them apart. Starr said that she refused to play into Todd's hands and would never choose between her family and her boyfriend. She told Cole they needed to be mature and resolute, even when Todd wasn't; they'd survived all the turmoil Langston had written about in the musical, and Todd would never split them up.\n\n\nCole admitted that the drama with Langston and Markko, and his renewed animosity with Todd, had left him fearful about their future. Todd had believed Cole was cheating on Starr, but Cole swore he didn't want anyone but her. Starr reassured him that they could handle anything together. \"Believe in us, Cole,\" she pleaded. \"I do,\" Cole replied and drew her into a kiss.\n\n\nAs they slid into each other's arms, Starr informed Cole that Langston and Markko were out, and Hope was asleep, which left them a rare opportunity to be together. Seizing the moment, they fell onto the couch and began to make love.\n\n\nBack at the Palace, Langston approached the door to the suite she and Ford were sharing and was unaware that Markko stood in the hallway outside, as he rehearsed his introduction to famous director Alfonso Del Toro. Inches from the door, Langston stopped abruptly and said she couldn't greet a bellboy half-dressed. Instead, Ford did it for her, and answered the door in his ubiquitous boxer briefs. He was shocked to find Markko standing there, while just behind the door, Langston cowered in fear. Markko was equally perplexed to find the half-naked Ford in Del Toro's suite but quickly figured things out for himself: \"I know exactly what you're doing!\"\n\n\nMarkko concluded that Ford was holding Del Toro's suite for him, and Ford replied that the director would arrive in the morning. Ford promised to put in a good word for Markko and invited him inside, much to Langston's horror. As Langston raced to the bathroom, Markko, none the wiser, entered the suite with his room service tray. Examining the room, Markko realized Ford had a guest with him. Gloating, Ford told Markko he was right again.\n\n\nAs Markko began to ramble about his and Langston's magical evening at the Palace the previous year, Langston noticed her bracelet on a nearby desk. Exchanging a furtive glance with Ford from her hiding place, she watched as Ford put the bracelet inside a wooden box to conceal it from Markko's eyes. Ford wished Markko the best of luck in meeting his favorite director and bid him goodnight. No sooner was Markko out the door than Langston strode over to Ford and kneed him in the groin.\n\n\nFurious, Langston asked Ford if he'd meant for her to be found out by Markko. Clutching his groin, Ford said he had just been having a little fun, but Langston didn't find it amusing and accused him of making Markko look like an idiot. \"I'm not the one doing that,\" Ford shot back, \"You are.\"\n\n\nLangston blanched as she realized he was correct; she was the one playing Markko for a fool, and it was all her own fault. Overcome, she moved to leave. Ford asked her to stay. \"Go to hell,\" Langston snapped, shoving past him and stalking off into the night.\n\n\nBack at the apartment, Starr and Cole were a tangle of arms and legs under blankets as they searched for their clothes in the aftermath of their lovemaking. Starr teasingly told Cole she had another very important question for him and asked him to go to prom with her. They hadn't been able to go in the previous two years, and she wanted one more special night at Llanview High. Cole immediately agreed.\n\n\nAs Starr and Cole dressed, Starr pointed out her four prom tickets, including two for Langston and Markko. The couple was touched by Markko's gesture for Langston, and his plan to rent the same suite at the Palace that they'd had the year before. Cole was leery, however, and asked Starr if they could be sure Langston was done with Ford. Starr insisted Langston had learned her lesson; \"She's with Markko!\" \"Who's with me?\" Markko asked quizzically, bursting through the front door.\n\n\nStarr quickly covered and told Markko that Langston was with him for prom night. Both Starr and Cole grew nervous as Markko recounted his expedition to the Palace to reserve the room and his chance meeting with Ford, who'd had \"a girl\" with him. When Markko asked where Langston was, Starr and Cole claimed she was working on the musical.\n\n\nAs Markko headed to his room to call Langston, Starr and Cole were left alone with their private concerns. Cole was sure Langston was with Ford and told Starr he knew she suspected the same. Just then, Langston, talking into her phone, entered the apartment. She stopped dead as she noticed Starr and Cole watching her.\n\n\nAt the Sun, T\u00e9a told Todd about Marty's fall down the hospital stairs, and informed him that Marty was pregnant. \"Probably tripped over her own self-righteousness,\" Todd said as he sneered. As T\u00e9a fished for information on the last time Todd had spoken to Marty, Todd asked her if someone thought Marty had been pushed and if he were a suspect. T\u00e9a reminded him that she'd seen him after his fight with Marty, but Todd pushed T\u00e9a to admit it: \"You think I did it, don't you?\" \"I suspect you, yes,\" T\u00e9a replied.\n\n\nAs Todd reeled at T\u00e9a's lack of trust, she reminded him that he'd also pushed Starr down a flight of stairs, and she'd been pregnant, as well, not to mention his daughter. Todd told her to get out, but T\u00e9a refused. Todd accused her of poisoning Danielle against him and having no faith in him. T\u00e9a told him that whatever had or hadn't happened, he needed a lawyer and that if Marty's child died, he was in a lot of trouble; in order to help him, she needed to know if he'd pushed Marty.\n\n\n\"You think I'm a monster,\" Todd mumbled, but T\u00e9a disagreed; she said she knew his emotions overwhelmed him and made him do terrible things and again asked for the truth. She demanded to know if he had done it. \"Yes,\" Todd replied. After watching T\u00e9a's horrified reaction and listening to her begin to make plans for his defense, Todd lunged at her and gripped her in his arms. He screamed at her and asked if that was what she'd wanted to hear and if that was what she'd wanted to believe.\n\n\nSobbing, T\u00e9a told Todd she was there for him no matter what he'd done, but Todd rejected her claim of devotion. He told her that after everything she'd put him through, the only person he wanted to hurt was her. He revealed that he hadn't pushed Marty but said she didn't believe him, so it didn't matter. He again ordered her to leave.\n\n\nT\u00e9a said she did believe him and that he needed her help in case John turned on him as a possible suspect. Todd refused to listen to her pleas and told her to \"go to hell.\" At her wit's end, T\u00e9a left the office, but not before tossing everything on the nearby table to the floor in frustration.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, John asked Natalie if she was truly sorry about Marty's fall. He explained that Marty had told him what Natalie had said at Hallowed Grounds about their relationship and coldly asked Natalie if she really believed he was only with Marty because of the baby. Natalie insisted she hadn't meant her rash words at the coffee shop, but John pressured her and asked if she'd wished the baby dead so they could be together. Natalie swore she hadn't wanted any harm to befall the child.\n\n\nJohn told Natalie that Marty hadn't fallen; she'd been pushed. He reminded his ex that she'd been on the scene when he'd arrived, and Natalie said she'd only been there a couple of seconds. She claimed Marty had been on the ground when she'd gotten there. Natalie said she hadn't seen anyone else in the stairwell, and John asked her about meeting Marty outside her office just before the incident. Natalie was stricken as she realized what John was driving at, and pushed him to say it -- he thought she'd pushed Marty. \"Did you?\" John asked.\n\n\nNatalie was horrified that John could think her capable of pushing a pregnant woman down a flight of stairs. \"You don't know me at all,\" she mumbled, shell-shocked. John told Natalie he knew that when she was angry, she lashed out and became her own worst enemy. Natalie replied that there was a world of difference between rash decisions and attempted murder, and insisted she'd only visited the hospital to apologize to Marty for what she'd said at Hallowed Grounds. She asked if Marty suspected her, but John had no answer.\n\n\nCrushed, Natalie told John to go and be with Marty. \"We're done,\" she said softly. As John walked away, she stopped him again. Tears streaming down her face, Natalie told him that no matter what he thought of her, she was truly sorry for Marty and the baby.\n\n\nA musical montage played as the people of Llanview went about their lives: At the teens' apartment, Langston passed the suspicious Starr and Cole without a word as she entered her and Markko's room. At the Sun, Todd called the hospital for information on Marty's baby but got no news and hung up then stood surveying the night sky. At the hospital, Destiny and Matthew polished off her cookies and shared a hug as Destiny left, silently heartbroken; meanwhile, Matthew stared at his prom tickets. At the Palace, Danielle flashed back to her kiss with Nate, while just outside, T\u00e9a stopped on her way to the door and was lost in thoughts of Todd. At the hospital, John left Natalie alone in the corridor, and Natalie, weeping with sorrow, collapsed against the wall. \n\n\n",
