    "soap_central": "\n\nAn all-out melee broke out at Capricorn between John and Cristian after Cristian swung the first punch. As the two men grappled with each other, Talia and Eddie pleaded with them to stop, while the rest of the evening's clubbers looked on, stunned. Antonio was strangely silent as Blair rushed over and begged him to break the fight up, but he stood by and did nothing. Watching the scuffle, Jared turned to Natalie and cracked, \"They used to fight over you like that?\" As Rex rushed over to try to intervene between the two gladiators, Adriana didn't miss a beat and called Dorian, who was en route to Michigan with Layla on a private jet. Dorian told her daughter that she and Layla would be staying at a hotel for the evening and meeting with Brody Lovett's family in the morning, but Adriana demanded that her mother see the Lovetts that very night, or else-time was of the essence. Cowed, Dorian obeyed, and ended their conversation. \n\n\nThe fight in the club raged on, with patrons being pushed back and forth as John and Cristian tumbled over tables and chairs. When a patron stumbled into Gigi, causing her to fall to the floor, Rex raced to her side, much to Adriana's chagrin. Meanwhile, Eddie scrambled over to a corner to call Commissioner Ramsey at the penthouse, explaining the out of control situation. Upon hearing that Cristian started it, Ramsey ordered Eddie to bring him in for assaulting an officer. Eddie hung up, ready to comply, but as he advanced on Cristian and John, Cris was shoved backwards, and his lunge at John spun around to clock Eddie in the face, sending him crashing to the ground! As Eddie began to pick himself up, wiping at his bloodied mouth, he told Cristian that he was under arrest. \n\n\nAs Miles, Natalie, and Jared watched the fallout of the brawl, Jessica rushed in to stand beside them, shocked at the scene that was unfolding. She explained that she had been dropping by with more winery revisions for Cristian, and was stunned to hear he was headed to jail. Jared gloated about John's loose ways with other men's women, and sneered that he could see what Natalie saw in McBain. Irritated, Natalie sent him back to Gigi. \n\n\nAt the penthouse, Ramsey finished a mysterious phone call, and said that he'd made \"payment\" and expected swift \"delivery\" as soon as possible. Hanging up, he prepared to head for work to meet Eddie, while Janet, his hired nurse, descended the staircase leading upstairs. He asked Janet to stay late while he attended to some police business. Janet asked about his phone call, hopeful that it was \"good news?\" \"I'm optimistic,\" Ramsey replied. \n\n\nBack at Capricorn, Antonio pleaded with Eddie to lay off his brother, claiming it was an accident, but Eddie pressed the issue, reminding Antonio that Cristian had assaulted two officers, and that he was even going to try to charge him with \"attempted murder!\" Eddie took Cris off to be booked at the LPD and Talia and Jessica followed, leaving John and Antonio to argue over who was responsible for the fiasco. Before tempers could overheat, Blair stepped in to mediate, whisking John off into a back room to tend to his cuts and bruises, while Antonio headed for the station. \n\n\nAt her table, Rex and Jared fretted over Gigi, who insisted she was fine, while Adriana watched and seethed over Rex's TLC for his ex. She told Rex to stop worrying about Gigi, and said she could tell the single mother was all right-life just had a way of \"knocking you on your ass\" sometimes. Adriana smirked and said she had a feeling Gigi was used to bar fights after all her years waitressing in Texas. She urged Rex to leave Gigi's care and protection to her date for the evening, Jared, and Gigi and Rex both convulsively reacted at once-\"He's/she's not my/his date!\" Rex's proprietary feelings for Gigi only raised Adriana's hackles higher, however, and she and Gigi bickered ceaselessly until Rex broke their tiff up. Gigi and Jared beat a hasty retreat towards the bar while Adriana called after them to continue having a wonderful evening, just as she and Rex would. Rex, perturbed, asked Adriana what was wrong, why she was so angry. \"Nothing at all,\" Adriana simpered unconvincingly, insisting that \"I want everyone to be as happy as you and me!\" As she embraced her fianc\u00e9, Rex looked put out. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in Michigan, Dorian and Layla made their way through the night to the Lovett house, where Dorian fumbled with an antiquated doorbell before a miffed Layla tutored her in the fine art of simply knocking first. Nadine Lovett, the late Brody's sister, answered the door. Nadine was surly, taking Dorian and Layla for salespeople, and warned that \"we don't want any,\" but Dorian insisted that they were \"friends of Gigi Morasco,\" looking for Brody's family. Nadine remembered Gigi; she said Gigi had had a \"thing\" with her brother before he left for Iraq. She cracked that she'd always gotten on with her since Gigi hadn't liked her mother either. Dorian explained that Gigi was anxious to find out what had become of Brody's relatives, and had sent them in her stead with some important questions. She asked to see Brody's mother, but Nadine explained that the abusive Mrs. Lovett was long dead. Nadine reminisced, recalling that \"Mama\" couldn't stand Gigi either. Dorian claimed to be \"horrified\" by this news, and said she could only imagine the tension that erupted between the two families when Gigi gave birth to Brody Lovett's little boy. \"What little boy?\" Nadine asked, confused. Dorian and Layla learned that the Lovetts had had no idea Gigi was pregnant, and Nadine assured them that her mother would never have \"done what she did\" had she known the truth. When Dorian and Layla pushed for details, Nadine became emotional, recalling how demanding and cruel Mrs. Lovett had been, and how jealous she was towards any woman who threatened to take Brody, her favorite child, away from her. Dorian produced a wad of cash, hoping this would ease Nadine's \"pain,\" and Nadine finally admitted that Mrs. Lovett had lied to Gigi: Brody was alive! Dorian and Layla were floored. Nadine was surprised to hear about Brody's son, and told the women that Brody had been \"head over heels\" for Gigi, but when he'd come home from a tour of duty in Iraq, Mrs. Lovett had told him that Gigi had run off with another guy. This, she said, had led Brody to disappear completely. Dorian asked if he was still in the service, and Nadine was sure he was-\"Iraq, and Afghanistan.\" When asked about Brody's whereabouts, Nadine waited on more cash before revealing that an Army buddy of Brody's had said he was last seen near Norfolk, Virginia. Dorian and Layla thanked Nadine for her assistance and hustled off into the night. Nadine told them to say hello to Gigi, and said that she was sure Gigi would be happy to hear that \"Shane's dad\" was alive. \"She won't be the only one!\" Dorian replied gleefully, leaving the house and closing the door behind her. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, Miles and Natalie were still at Capricorn sitting at a lonely table. Miles could tell that, despite her denials, Natalie's feathers were ruffled by the conflict between John and Cristian. Natalie insisted that it wasn't so much that she was upset as confused. She explained to Miles that John did not like \"public displays of affection.\" She'd barely been able to get him to hold hands with her in public when they were together, let alone dance or make out as he'd done with Talia that evening-especially in front of Antonio. She said it was like this unfamiliar version of John who was some kind of \"pod person,\" leading Miles to jokingly conclude that John had been \"snatched and replaced.\" He asked if she still had a hard time seeing John with another woman, but Natalie reminded Miles that their break-up was some time ago, and that John had been with Marty since, and was still recovering from her loss. She changed the subject, asking Miles to elaborate about his possibly leaving town. Miles admitted he wasn't sure what he was going to do yet, but said he would be moving out of Viki's carriage house, insisting that he was tired of imposing on Natalie's mother's hospitality. Natalie begged him not to leave, saying she needed him to vent with, but Miles assured her that \"we'll always be friends.\" Despite their bond, though, he knew he needed to get his own life. \n\n\nFrom afar, Jared spied the closeness between Natalie and Miles with envy, which was misunderstood by Gigi as Jared's \"protectiveness\" towards his \"niece\" while she was on her date. Jared huffily insisted that Miles and Natalie were not dating, echoing Gigi and Rex's assurances about himself and Gigi to Adriana. Jared warned Gigi that \"Rex is too interested in your love life\" to be just a good friend who was about to get married. \n\n\nAt the LPD, Eddie hauled Cristian in to be booked and processed, with Talia, Jessica, and Antonio all trailing behind him, full of protests. The trio pleaded with Eddie for mercy on Cristian, but Talia and Jessica couldn't stop bickering amongst themselves about Antonio and who was responsible for the fight. The women continued to argue until Ramsey arrived and ordered them all to be quiet. He asked Jessica what she was doing there, and Jessica said she wanted to post bail for Cristian. Ramsey said that could wait and summoned Antonio and Talia into his office for a private chat. Alone, Cristian grumbled to Jessica that he could take care of himself and that she didn't need to do anything for him. Jessica said she wanted to. Cristian blamed the whole mess on John, disbelieving McBain's behavior and attitude. Jessica warned him that he should've stayed out of the rift between John and Antonio, but Cristian protested that he couldn't stand by and watch his brother be disrespected. Jessica worried about Cristian's fate, and suggested calling Sarah; Cristian reminded her that Nash and Sarah were working late on winery business. Jessica urged him to let her call them, but Cristian insisted that it wasn't important enough, and tried again to get her to leave. \"I'm staying,\" Jessica declared, her mind made up. Touched by her support, Cristian was bashful as he thanked her. \n\n\nIn the Commissioner's office, Ramsey laid into Antonio and Talia, and said he'd been far too lax about the intra-office fraternization policy. \"I failed to predict that Ms. Sahid was going to fraternize her way through the entire department.\" Talia was shocked and appalled as Ramsey continued to spout double entendres about her supposed \"bed hopping\" throughout the LPD, and was even more stunned when Antonio simply stood aside and didn't defend her honor. Talia bristled at Ramsey's accusations, and said he couldn't treat her in such a way. Ramsey blamed the entire incident on John and Talia's lack of discretion and respect for Antonio in a public environment, much less a club formerly owned by him, and ordered Talia to \"get a hotel room\" the next time. Ramsey sent her packing, leaving him and Antonio alone in the office. Antonio again asked for clemency on his brother's behalf, explaining that Cristian was just trying to defend his honor, and didn't mean to hit Eddie. Reviewing the facts aloud, repeating that Cristian's hitting Eddie was an accident, Ramsey finally told Antonio that Cristian would be held overnight but no charges would be filed. \"This is between us,\" Ramsey cautioned Antonio, who gratefully agreed. Ramsey and Antonio stepped back into the main office, where Ramsey ordered Eddie to finish processing Cristian to be put in lock-up for the evening, then left for the night himself. Jessica objected, but told Cristian she would be there in the morning to spring him. After Eddie ushered Cristian away, Jessica remained angry and confused. She told Antonio that Bo would've let Cristian off, given the circumstances: \"any decent person would do that!\" Antonio was pensive and uncommunicative, and glanced back at Ramsey's office door, which read \"Commissioner of Police.\" \"Yes,\" Antonio said to himself. \"Any decent person would...\" \n\n\nBack at Capricorn, Blair hustled the moody and monosyllabic John into the back room, and began cleaning and dressing his wounds. She chastised John for his behavior on her big night, and said she didn't understand where the trouble with Antonio and Talia had come from. Remembering his recent tussle with Todd, she reminded him that Cole looked up to him, and suggested that his recent actions were influencing the teenager's foolhardy behavior regarding Starr. \"Stop acting like a jackass!\" she demanded, and explained that kids learned from adults how to act. John insisted that he hadn't been around Cole enough to be such an example for the young man. Blair told John that Cole had probably heard around town about him and Talia. She reminded him of his promise to Marty to care for her son, and said she couldn't figure him out anymore. John wistfully said that there wasn't \"much to figure.\" \n\n\nAs John and Blair went back into the club, Talia returned from the LPD with an update on Cristian's status. Blair was disappointed to hear that Cris was in lock-up, and headed off to take care of club business. Talia looked over John's bruises, but before they could get a moment alone, Natalie walked up, still wanting answers for what was causing John's strange behavior of late. Talia angrily told Natalie that it wasn't John's fault and they had a right to go where they pleased. Natalie retreated to Miles's side, and again prevailed upon him not to leave Llanview-\"You're my only sane friend left!\" With that, the two friends headed out for the night. \n\n\nJared watched Miles and Natalie go, while an oblivious Gigi continued to prattle on to herself about Shane's sports practice. Jared tuned back in and told Gigi that he'd seen Shane's great work on his comic book for school. He said it was obvious Shane was proud of his \"late\" father, and added that it was a shame Shane had never gotten to meet him. Gigi sadly agreed, staring directly at Rex and Adriana from across the club. \n\n\nAt their table, the manic Adriana pushed Rex to talk about locations for their honeymoon, but Rex chafed at Adriana's overbearing attitude and said they both needed to relax and focus on each other for the rest of the evening. Adriana agreed, but when Rex's ears perked up at the sound of Gigi's laughter, he couldn't resist complaining about Jared again. Rex groused about Jared's unprofessional interest in his employee, and said that he wouldn't let Jared hurt Gigi. \"I hope he does hurt her,\" Adriana snapped, losing her patience. \"...I hope he hurts her so bad she leaves town.\" When Rex asked to know where her anger was coming from, Adriana exploded that she couldn't take any more talk of \"Gigi this and Gigi that,\" and was sick and tired of hearing about \"poor Gigi.\" She said that deep down Gigi was a \"cocky smartass,\" but Rex just couldn't see it somehow. Rex said she was misreading his old friend and being unfair. The couple struggled to change the subject, and Adriana apologized, blaming her edginess on wedding and work stress, and said she missed him terribly when she was going back and forth to Paris. They resolved to just try to enjoy their evening from then on, and Rex headed for the bar to grab some champagne. In his absence, Adriana took a call from Dorian, who revealed that \"Brody Lovett is alive and well!\" Adriana was overjoyed, and hung up just as Rex returned. Rex inquired as to her newfound good mood, and Adriana covered, saying she'd gotten positive business news from Layla. Bubbling with triumph, she smirked at Gigi from across the club. \n\n\nJohn and Talia were still at the bar, fuming with Ramsey's behavior towards Talia and upset about the fracas with Cristian. Talia bemoaned the fact that Ramsey had taken Antonio's side and gotten him under his sway. John corrected her, and said that Ramsey wasn't on Antonio's side. \"He doesn't care about anyone but himself.\" \n\n\nAt the penthouse, Ramsey sent Janet home for the evening, then ascended the stairs to see his mysterious roommate. From the bedroom, he again admired the moonlit view of Llanview's skyscrapers. \"You're a lot more familiar with this skyline than I am,\" he reminded himself, speaking to his mystery guest and smiling at him or her. \"It must feel good to be home...\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After John and Talia flaunt their affection in public and Cristian sees that it is humiliating his brother, he goes and decks John. At that point, Eddie presses charges against Cristian. Ramsay puts Cristian in lock up. Dorian and Layla go to find Brody Lovett's sister, after Adriana demands that they do it right away. The sister informs them that she knows that Brody had a relationship with Gigi but their deceased mother disapproved of it. And after Dorian bribes her to give the information, she reveals that she knows her brother is alive and has misled people into believing he died. Adriana is very happy to hear that new information. But she's very bitter about Rex's interest in Gigi.",
