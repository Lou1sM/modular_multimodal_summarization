He even pretended to be Cole, but his attempt was unsuccessful when he was asked for the special family code. Kelly walked in and was immediately suspicious of his behavior, so she asked him what kind of trouble he was in. Todd lied and explained that he was following up on a story, but his mind wandered away as he recalled his last conversation with Marty at the hospital. Kelly realized that Todd was far away, but he attributed it to having lots on his mind. Kelly was certain that Todd would be able to handle it.\n\n\nTodd shuddered as Kelly revealed the vase that her mother had made. \"Like father, like son,\" she muttered when she saw his reaction. She shared her annoyance that Todd had not offered any comments or asked any questions about her trip to California. \"We can sleep together,\" Todd said in response. He thought it would make him feel better. She brushed him off, and was annoyed even more. He proceeded to bombard Kelly with questions about her trip, but it was obvious to Kelly that he really didn't seem interested in her.\n\n\nTodd began to ask questions about John, and he assumed that John had not gotten anywhere with Kelly's case because of Marty. He wondered if John knew about it, which prompted Kelly to ask what Todd was talking about. Todd thought quickly and admitted that he wondered if John knew if his baby was a boy or a girl. Kelly couldn't understand Todd's preoccupation with John, but he suggested that she needed to talk to someone who was focused on her mother's death and not other problems. Kelly was sure that John had everything under control.\n\n\nKelly told Todd about the \"mute\" man she and John had met in California, and Todd made light of the fact that such a man might have made the phone calls in question. Adamantly, Kelly insisted that she believed in John. \"He always gets his man,\" she said firmly.\n\n\nLater, Todd studied the website of the Llanview Police Blotter and found an article on Marty. Kelly continued to talk about her trip, oblivious as to what Todd was doing. Suddenly, he got up and said he had to leave because he had something to take care of. Kelly plopped some new flowers into her vase and had the shock of her life when Rodney, the man from California, sneaked up behind her.\n\n\nStarr was excited about the new prom dress she had to buy and accepted Cole's assurance that he didn't mind attending the prom with her, as it would be a special night. Langston and Markko walked into the apartment as Cole and Starr kissed. Jokingly, Markko told them to get a room and turned to Langston to ask if there was something she had to tell him. Langston was unnerved, but just then, she received a text message from Ford, who wondered if she were still angry at him. She ignored it as Markko teasingly told her that he knew about the prom tickets, and he accepted her invitation. He promised that it would be a better experience than the last one. He headed back out.\n\n\nCole mentioned the experience that Markko had had the previous night at the Palace Hotel when he had found Ford in a hotel room meant for the guest lecturer. Curtly, Cole noted that Ford hadn't wasted any time in finding a replacement girlfriend for Langston, though Cole was curious to know if Langston had truly \"dumped\" Ford. He accused her of being the one in the hotel room with Ford, especially since she had been gone all night. Langston quickly denied the charge and suggested that it was Hannah who had been with Ford. Cole thought that was ridiculous. Langston assured him that she wouldn't be anywhere near Ford because she was \"so over him.\"\n\n\nStill living with her father at the Buchanan mansion, Jessica checked out a high school page on the online social network \"Myface\" and stared thoughtfully at a photo of Cristian. She was thrilled when Viki paid her a visit, though she told her mother that things were \"so awful.\" Viki reported on Bree's antics in London, but Jessica felt detached and politely asked how the little girl was. She lamented the fact that she couldn't be more of a mother to Bree, but Viki assured her that it wasn't her fault because Jessica was really living as a 17-year-old. Jessica dejectedly informed Viki that Cristian had asked someone else to the prom, and so she no longer wanted to attend.\n\n\nViki reminded Jessica that Cristian was a teacher, but Jessica explained that he would be a chaperon. She had thought of going by herself, but she had ripped up the ticket instead. Viki thought that Jessica should attend. Jessica disclosed that Marty blamed Jessica for the way she was, and Viki agreed that the prom time had been an important time in Jessica's life. She thought that Jessica needed to see it through. Jessica thought she would look like an idiot if she went by herself, and Viki suggested that she take someone else.\n\n\nJessica whined that she wanted to go to the prom with Cristian and didn't think Viki could understand how it felt to not remember someone. Viki assured her she could relate, and Jessica felt like a bad person. Viki assured her it wasn't her fault, but Viki had heard via Natalie that Jessica had had a date with Brody, so maybe Jessica could ask him to the prom. Jessica called Natalie a boyfriend-stealer and blabbermouth, and while Brody was nice, he wasn't who she wanted.\n\n\nAs Viki got ready to leave, she assured Jessica it was okay for her to stay with Clint, but they would have to make some decisions regarding Bree in the near future. Viki was sure they could make it work no matter what, and she promised Jessica that Viki and Clint would always be there for her. She told her to think about the prom. After Viki left, Jessica taped the ticket back together. She looked at Cristian's photo again on the school Internet page.\n\n\nNatalie visited her new best friend, Brody, and complained that John had accused her of killing Marty's baby. Brody was unaware of what had happened, and Natalie filled him in. Dismayed, she stressed that John believed that she was the one who had pushed Marty down the stairs, and she couldn't accept the fact that John had accused her. \"Cut him some slack,\" Brody suggested. He thought that it was John's duty as a cop to question her.\n\n\nNatalie tearfully exclaimed that she missed John and had wondered where their relationship might have gone. She admitted that she had been at the scene when Marty had been found because she had gone to the hospital to apologize to Marty for her hurtful words. Brody assured her there was no evidence that she had been the one to push Marty, but Natalie was certain that Marty would convince John otherwise.\n\n\nNatalie admitted that she often did crazy things and could be compulsive, but she would never commit such an act as pushing Marty down the stairs. Brody explained that John had an obligation to ask Natalie questions, but John hadn't arrested Natalie, and neither would he. Brody believed that Natalie was innocent. Natalie wished that John would believe her, as well, and she couldn't understand why he didn't, since she thought she and John had a connection. Brody continued to look over longingly at a photo of himself and Jessica as Natalie spoke. He made it clear that John was a cop and was \"leaning on procedure.\" John had asked questions and noted Natalie's response, but he hadn't pursued her further.\n\n\nNatalie thought back to what John had been like previously, and she pointed out that John wouldn't stop until he obtained the truth. Just then, Brody received a call from John, who asked Brody to get to the hospital to take Marty's statement. Natalie wondered if she should get herself a lawyer, but Brody assured her he would give her a \"heads-up\" in the event that should be necessary. An appreciative Natalie wrapped her arms around Brody, and he hugged her back tightly.\n\n\nAt the hospital, John and Marty tearfully comforted each other as Marty recuperated after surgery. She wanted to know if John had arrested Natalie and was perturbed that he hadn't. She strongly felt that Natalie had made them lose their baby and that Natalie belonged in jail. John assured her he had questioned Natalie, and there wasn't any evidence to support the idea that Natalie had been the one to push Marty.\n\n\nMarty disagreed and wanted Natalie to pay for what she had done. She had heard Natalie say that the baby was in the way, and John had seen Natalie at the top of the stairs. A nurse interrupted when she arrived to give Marty a code for family members who called about Marty's condition. Marty acknowledged that the only family would be her son, and she would tell him in person after she arrived home. The nurse related that Cole already knew, as he had called the hospital, seeking information.\n\n\nMarty was sure that she would fall apart when she saw Cole, who had been looking forward to having a sibling. She thought it best to contact Cole immediately, and after she spoke to him, she told John that Cole had not known about her hospitalization. The nurse had likely made a mistake, she told a thoughtful-looking John.\n\n\nFord ran into Cristian and Layla at the diner just as Cristian was about to ask Layla an important question. They teased Ford when they heard about his overnight at the hotel, and Layla was sure she knew who the girl was that had spent the night with Ford. He sat down at their table with his back to the counter. Layla thought it was Karen, the pizza delivery girl, who always ventured to Ford's bedroom to make change. Ford laughed as Markko took a seat at the counter behind Ford. \"That's who you think I was with,\" Ford began as Markko turned to listen.\n\n\nFord moved into another seat next to Layla and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Markko. He admitted he had been with Karen. As Ford got up to get his order, Layla called him an operator. Layla was glad that Cristian wasn't a \"player.\" Cristian returned to his question and asked Layla to go to the prom with him. \n\n\nLayla was disappointed and admitted that she had thought it was going to be a different question, but she would be honored to go to the prom with Cristian. She wondered about Jessica, and Cristian verified that Jessica had purchased one ticket. Jessica knew he'd be with Layla, and he was proud to be seen with Layla. He would buy Layla a greenhouse full of flowers, he joked.\n\n\nLayla confessed that she had never made it to her senior prom because she had been sick, and Cristian promised that she had a second chance. He would see to it that it would be a special time for her and the best night of her life.\n\n\nAs Markko handed Ford a takeout order, he mentioned the conversation he had overheard. Karen was a friend of his, and he didn't want Ford to hurt her. She was a nice girl, and he wanted Ford to treat her right. Ford froze as Markko added that he had something to say about Langston, but Markko only wanted Ford to know that Markko was taking Langston to the prom and had reserved that same hotel room for the night. He didn't want Ford to mention it to Langston in the event he saw her. \n\n\nFord asked Markko to keep it a secret that Ford had used the hotel room in Del Toro's name. Markko agreed, though he had mentioned it to Langston, since the two of them didn't have secrets. Ford smiled to himself.\n\n\nMarty's phone call interrupted Cole's accusations of Langston. He was shocked to hear her news and verified that she was okay. Dejectedly, he told Starr and Langston what had happened. Starr and Langston were sad, and Starr quickly tried to comfort her boyfriend. Even though Marty had told him to stay home, Starr surmised that Cole would head to the hospital immediately, and she was right. He asked Starr to give Hope a kiss from him when she woke up. Langston was sorry, too, but Cole evaded her as she reached out to hug him.\n\n\nAfter Cole left, Langston voiced her concern that even though Cole hated her, she hoped he knew she was sorry. Starr clarified that Cole only cared about his good friend Markko. Langston again insisted she was finished with Ford, but she could tell that Starr didn't believe her. Langston challenged Starr and asked when she had ever lied to Starr in the past. Starr didn't have to think very hard as she recalled the lies after Langston's parents had passed away. Langston defended herself and said it was different. She pointed out that she had tried to save herself from being put into foster care.\n\n\nStarr thought it was similar and that Langston was lying because she was afraid of losing the apartment, Markko, and her friends. Starr understood that Langston was under lots of pressure and assured Langston that she wouldn't lose their friendship. She wanted to know if it was Langston who had been in the hotel room with Ford. Langston maintained that she hadn't been with Ford, but Starr asked her to swear on their friendship. Langston found it difficult to find her voice, but finally, she swore on their friendship that she was done with Ford. She grabbed her things and left, obviously quite upset.\n\n\nJohn promised to find the guilty person, but he insisted there was no evidence that Natalie had perpetrated the crime. Marty wondered if John was just protecting Natalie and insisted it wasn't because she was jealous. She pointed out that Natalie had stabbed Mitch and gotten away with it, due in part to John's cover-up of the act. John told her the situation was different, but Marty was sure it wasn't. John insisted he wasn't covering for Natalie and only cared about Marty, who was surprised. John assured Marty that he was concerned about her, and he would continue checking on the crime. He vowed to find out who had pushed Marty, even it if was Natalie.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the hospital and expressed his sympathy to John regarding the baby. John was curious how Brody knew about it, and Brody mentioned that he had heard about it from Natalie. He recognized that John was looking at Natalie for the assault on Marty.\n\n\nUnseen by the two men, Todd looked over the crime scene and knocked down the official tape that blocked off the top of the stairs. He made his way to the nurses' station and began to look for Marty's file when no one was around. As he found the file and picked it up, Cole arrived and wanted to know what Todd was doing.\n\n\nBrody made his way into Marty's room, and Marty assured him that he knew who had pushed her. She reminded him that he had heard the conversation between her and Natalie. He wondered if she had received any other threats or if she had any enemies. Suddenly, Marty recalled that there was someone else she'd had a problem with, and it was Todd.\n\n\nJohn entered the staircase and found the police tape down on the ground. He drew his gun and aimed it toward the person he saw standing there. It was Natalie. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Suspicion about who pushed Marty down the flight of stairs and made her lose her baby casts over both Natalie and Todd. After Marty demands that John arrests Natalie, he calls Brody to take a statement from Brody. Natalie protests to Brody that she did not do it but follows him to the hospital and the scene of the crime and makes herself look very suspicious. Todd is completely distracted and calls the hospital disguising himself as Cole in order to find out information about Marty. Langton looks suspicious to Starr and Cole when Ford makes it clear that he was sleeping with somebody. Langston wants to prove that she's done with Ford. But is she really? Jessica still can't get Cristian out of her mind. So she doesn't want to go to the prom knowing that he will take Layla. Viki hopes that she will get back to her life in the present but encourages her daughter to go the prom.",
