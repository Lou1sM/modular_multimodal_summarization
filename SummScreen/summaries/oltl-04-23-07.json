He lamented not bringing something for good luck, and stunned Adriana with a big kiss on the lips. Meanwhile, Rex left a message for Adriana about what was going on in Chicago. After agreeing to leave Chicago, Todd told Blair that he wouldn't leave without answers regarding his son, and reminded her that he'd never let the law stop him before. Evangeline admitted to Layla that she might be pregnant. Cristian caught Nash hanging around Angel Square and questioned him about why he was still in Llanview. Antonio asked Jamie what Jessica meant when she apologized for \"the kissing.\" \n\n\nCole bolstered Starr's confidence after her audition. Marcie sent Starr on her way as Cole began his audition, whose song was sung in the key of Michael Bolton. Starr stuck around to gaze at Cole, who wowed the audience and Marcie. Britney then nailed her audition song and Henry gave her a standing ovation. Marcie thanked everyone for their hard work and wished them luck. Henry excitedly talked about spending more time with Britney now that they'd be working on the play and going to Heather's Sweet 16 together. Britney got Henry to agree to help her with a paper and stay home the night of the party. If he helps her with the paper, she'll give him a \"special thank-you,\" she promised. He ran off to the library, and Britney revealed to a friend her scheme to ditch the study session. Marcie then returned to the auditorium to tell the students that a lack of funding might prevent the show from going on. \n\n\nBlair tried to talk some sense into Todd, arguing that there's no way they'll get more info on TJ from the adoption agency. Todd called Evangeline for some legal advice. Layla assumed Evangeline might be pregnant with Todd's baby, but Vange scolded her sister for jumping to conclusions. If there's any baby, it'd be Cristian's, Evangeline insisted, then admitted that there was this one time.... \"It only takes one time,\" said Layla, and advised her to tell Cristian right away. Evangeline admitted that she didn't want Cristian to find out because she didn't want him to get back together with her out of pity. \n\n\nJamie told her daddy that \"the kissing\" refers to all the attention Jessica showers on Bree, but that Jessica explained it doesn't mean she loves Jamie any less. When Antonio left to take a call, Jamie asked Jessica if she loves Nash more than she loves her papi. Jessica answered that she loves Antonio and Jamie very much, then sent the girl off to play in her room. Once alone with Antonio, Jessica began to explain her reasons for not adopting Jamie, but Antonio wasn't hearing any of it. His patience waning, he demanded a straight answer. An eavesdropping Jamie shuddered at her father's raised voice. Outside in the square, Nash cryptically declared to Cristian that if he leaves town again, it won't be alone. \n\n\nTate was late to the stage as he apologized to Adriana for the abrupt kiss and said they'd discuss it later. Adriana nervously watched backstage as Tate told hosts Joy Behar and Elisabeth Hasselbeck that there was someone special in his life \u2014 his first-grade teacher, and he wanted to wish her a happy 70th birthday! \"But are you seeing anyone under 70?\" the hosts asked. Tate then turned the audience's attention to the Exposed line, and the terrific designer who truly inspires him. The hosts asked for more info, like a name, and Tate yelled out, \"Adriana Cramer!\" He told everyone how she is talented and brilliant, then couldn't help himself and jumped up onto the sofa and screamed, \"Adriana Cramer is the most incredible woman I have ever known!\" Adriana covered her face in shame. \n\n\nTodd accused Blair of going to Chicago to disrupt his search, but Blair insisted that she was there to support him. Todd stormed out, and found Rex outside the hotel room. Rex claimed to be there to offer his assistance. After persuading Todd to leave town and let him do the work, Rex left Adriana another message. A woman from the adoption agency showed up at Todd and Blair's door, saying she might have more information on the missing tot. \n\n\nTate couldn't contain his enthusiasm, and after some Tom Cruise-style fist-pumping, excitedly ran off to the green room to get Adriana and pulled her onto the set against her will. Rex was lying on his hotel bed and awoke to see his girlfriend on national TV ... and Tate introducing her to America as \"my Adriana.\" Rex's jaw dropped as Tate summoned a shower of confetti onto the stage. \n\n\nAs Jessica and Antonio's arguing became more heated, Jamie sneaked out the back door. She wandered out into the square just as Nash told Cristian that he and Jessica are in love. \"Antonio and Jessica are married,\" Cristian reminded him. \"Maybe they still are,\" said Nash, as Jamie ran out and the sound of tires screeching were heard. In the loft, Jessica was about to confess to Antonio what happened at the quarry when she heard sirens and Nash burst in to tell Antonio that Jamie was hit by a car! \n\n\n",
