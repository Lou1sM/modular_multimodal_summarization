Jess was forced to tell Sarah about the altercation with John the night before that had ended with Cris's arrest. Sarah was upset that no one had called to tell her about it. Jess explained that Cris had forbidden it. Irritated, Sarah abruptly ended the call and headed to the police station to see Cris. Jess turned to Nash, ticked because Sarah had rudely disconnected their call. Jess was worried that Sarah would make things worse for Cris, so she decided to head to the police station. Nash wasn't thrilled with the announcement. He asked her why she felt compelled to run to her ex-husband's brother's defense. Jess was surprised by Nash's reaction. She returned to the bed and tried to explain. She told him that the Vega family was still important to her and she missed being a part of their lives. She enjoyed being able to reconnect with Cris recently, as friends. She wanted to be able to help him when he was in trouble. Nash was understanding and offered to go to the station with her. \n\n\nAntonio paid his brother a visit in jail. Cris had spent the night behind bars awaiting his arraignment. Antonio was furious that Cris had gotten into a fight with John. He told Cris that it wasn't his battle to fight. Cris didn't express any remorse over the incident. After Antonio left Cris, he went up to the squad room where he saw John and Talia standing close together in a private conversation. John had just discovered some interesting information about Ramsey that he was eager to share with Talia. Antonio approached John with a determined step. He didn't mince words but simply asked John if he intended to press charges against Cris. Talia was surprised when John said no. She immediately spoke up. Talia felt that Cris had not learned a thing from his incarceration and was taking advantage of his brother's position on the police force. \n\n\nThings were a bit tense between Sarah and Cris when she first arrived at the jail. Sarah was hurt that Cris had kept her in the dark about his arrest while Cris was irked to learn that Nash was the first person she called when she realized that Cris had not been home. They had a brief spat but made up easily. They were kissing when Nash and Jess walked up. Shortly afterwards, Cris was taken up through the squad room on his way to face a judge. Ramsey was waiting for Cris and his small army of supporters. Everyone was shocked when Ramsey announced that Cris would not be facing charges. Ramsey felt that the incident would reflect poorly on the police department. He didn't want to have to deal with the embarrassment. After Cris and his friends cleared out, Ramsey took a moment to speak to John. He made it clear that he intended to see John out of a job very soon. \n\n\nCole was taken aback when Markko asked him if Starr was pregnant. It took him a moment to recover but when he did, he decided to tell Markko the truth. Cole seemed almost relieved to have someone to confide to but he was curious about how Markko found out. Markko had figured it out on his own based on how everyone had been behaving recently. With the secret out, Cole opened up to Markko about what he was feeling. He told his friend that he intended to be there for Starr and the baby. Markko offered to help his friends in whatever way he could. Cole took Markko up on the offer immediately. He asked Markko to help him get two fake identification cards. Markko agreed to do what he could. After Markko left, Cole called John. He wanted to borrow $150.00, claiming it was for football camp. \n\n\nBlair walked into the kitchen to find Todd eating breakfast at the table alone. They spent a couple of minutes talking about Blair's evening before Todd gave her an edited version of what happened at the diner with Starr the night before. He told her that he had spent quality time with Starr and that it appeared she was starting to accept things. Blair seemed unconvinced. \n\n\nStarr and Langston huddled in Starr's bedroom before starting the day. Starr was having second thoughts about not following through with the abortion. Langston was encouraged by the fact that Cole knew about the pregnancy. Starr wasn't as optimistic about things. Langston was undeterred and suggested that Starr consider letting her parents know about the baby. Just then Blair knocked on the bedroom door. Langston quickly made herself scarce, leaving mother and daughter to talk. Blair fussed over Starr a bit until she realized that something was deeply troubling her daughter. She tried to get Starr to open up but Starr remained tightlipped. Blair reminded Starr that she loved her and could be trusted with Starr's secrets. It was clear that Starr wanted to talk to her mother but fear of her father learning her secrets held Starr back. Blair didn't give up. Eventually it seemed that Starr was on the verge of telling her mother about the baby but just then Todd walked into the bedroom, carrying a breakfast tray. Starr clammed up immediately. Blair was irritated by the interruption and tried to get Todd to leave. Todd refused to budge. He insisted on talking to Starr and didn't want to wait. While they bickered, Starr tried to hide the bout of morning sickness that hit her when the tray of food was brought into her room. When Blair decided to leave, Starr made sure she took the tray with her. Alone with his daughter, Todd took the opportunity to apologize for barging into the ladies room of the diner the night before. As they talked, Todd opened the door to the possibility of Starr seeing Cole again. He told Starr that if she kept her distance from Cole for six months, he would consider letting them date again. \n\n\nMarkko stopped by to see Langston. He told her that he had figured out that Starr was pregnant and suggested that if he was able to figure it out so easily, Starr's parents were bound to find out soon. Before he left, Markko gave Langston a note to give to Starr. It was from Cole. Langston went up to Starr's room after Todd left and gave her friend the note. \n\n\nAntonio took a moment stop by Ramsey's office to thank him for keeping his word about Cris. As Antonio stepped out of the office, Michael McBain approached him. He told Antonio that he needed to speak to him immediately. Antonio was stunned when Michael went on to tell him that Jamie was very sick. Talia was sitting nearby, at her desk, and overheard the exchange. \n\n\n",
