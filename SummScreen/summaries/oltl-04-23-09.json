After seeing the photo of her locking lips with Ray, he felt that it shouldn't have been a surprise at all. With Dorian insisting it was merely a joke, David wondered what the punch line could be. Dorian asked Ray to leave them alone. She informed an angry David that there was nothing between her and Ray, even though Ray was attractive and available. She reminded David that he was unavailable. \n\n\nAsking if he would move back to Llanview, Dorian heard her husband reply that he figured she wanted out of their marriage and was pushing him so that he would make the decision. He told her that he would not be able to continue acting while living in Llanview, even if she felt that he could. David insisted that he had been faithful to her, unlike Dorian. They agreed that they loved each other, though David wanted to know if she had feelings for Ray. \n\n\nLola eavesdropped on Langston and Starr talking about her. Langston declared that Lola would not take Markko away from her. The girls turned their conversation to the upcoming prom. Starr felt that she didn't want to attend, since the entire school blamed her for Mr. Joplin's suspension. \n\n\nAfter Starr left, Lola advised Langston that Markko would probably be in jail and would not be attending the prom. As she flaunted that fact, Ray walked out of the study and heard her. She quickly accused Langston of being mean to her. \n\n\nPulling his daughter aside, he advised her that she was not raised to be like that and that she was not to use the past as an excuse for her behavior. Admonishing her, Ray told her that it wasn't right. Lola apologized and insisted that she had merely been lonely and angry. Langston left for the caf\u00e9 and Lola told her dad that she wanted to make it up to both Langston and Markko. \"Papi, you have no idea what I'm capable of,\" she uttered after her dad left. \n\n\nDavid and Dorian agreed that they would always have a connection but they had grown apart with their different lives. Dorian admitted that she had meant it at the time when she said she was willing to move to California to be with David. She stressed that Ray had nothing to do with her change of heart. David felt that their timing was always off, and declared that he was dumping her. They said goodbye and affirmed that they'd still be David and Dorian. \n\nRunning into Ray, David said he was leaving. He suggested that Ray take care of Dorian or he'd break Ray's legs. Ray asked Dorian to go out to dinner with him and she accepted. \n\n\nAs Bo and Fish mourned Talia's passing, they learned that John was gone from his cell. Suddenly, Bo received a phone call from Fish's cell phone, and it obviously wasn't Fish. John apologized for taking Fish's phone and told Bo he was calling to say goodbye. Bo was unsuccessful in getting John to change his mind. He ordered Fish to put out an APB on John. \n\n\nAfter word got out about John's escape, Bo responded to a call from the mayor. Angrily telling the official, \"...we all have to do what we have to do,\" Bo exclaimed that he didn't want to see innocent people behind bars. \n\n\nAt the rehab facility, Nora was surprised to find Rachel. Explaining that she needed a job while in Llanview, Rachel astonished her mother even more when she divulged that she was Cole's counselor. Taken aback, Nora insisted that it had to be a conflict of interest, but Rachel stood her ground, making it clear that with her experience she felt sure that she would be able to help Cole. Dead set against her daughter helping the person who put her son in a wheelchair, Nora tried to talk Rachel into stepping aside, but Rachel wouldn't hear of it. While her mother blamed Cole for putting Matthew in the wheelchair, Matthew himself didn't, Rachel stated. \n\n\nRachel reminded her mother of how she had hurt people when she had been on drugs, but Nora had faith in her. She, in turn, had faith in Cole and wanted to help him. She warned Nora not to force her to make a choice. Insisting that she would be hard on Cole, Rachel finally heard Nora agree to deal with it, even though she didn't like it. As the women came to an understanding, Lola burst into the room and interrupted them. She demanded to know why Rachel hadn't done anything about Cole's faking his drug test. \n\n\nRachel told the girl that everything had been handled to her satisfaction. After Lola stormed out, Nora was angry in turn. Rachel cited the confidentiality between her and her client and, while she had a legal duty to report it as Nora quickly pointed out, Rachel maintained there had been no proof. She reiterated that she was handling things as she saw fit and was sure she'd have a positive impact on Cole. Nora was concerned that he would only ruin someone else's life if he were still using drugs. \n\n\nArriving at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 to meet Starr, Cole stopped to talk to Markko first. He demanded to know why Markko had confessed details of Cole's deceptive drug testing to Lola. Swearing that he had only told Langston, Markko explained that he could no longer keep any secrets from Langston after hiding Lola's advances towards him. He assumed that Lola had overheard their conversation. \n\n\nCole assured his buddy that he had been given a free pass and was not going to jail. He apologized for doubting his friend. Markko was hopeful that Cole and Starr were getting back together since they were meeting, but Cole advised him, \"It's not like that.\" \n\n\nWhen Starr arrived, the couple grabbed a booth. Starr inquired about Cole's recovery and was proud to hear that he had passed his drug testing. She admitted to reading all about the recovery process. Langston called Markko to warn him about Lola's threats, but he assured her that everything was fine. \n\n\nStarr and Cole needed to make a plan to find out what happened to Hope. Cole quickly shot down Starr's idea of asking Schuyler for help, and negated Michael since Starr wanted to keep things from Marcie. She grabbed the locket and thought they could start with that and the baby's lock of hair inside. \n\n\nLangston arrived and was happy to see Markko, and surprised to see Starr and Cole together. Markko assured her they weren't talking about the drug test, but it was something important. Langston shared Lola's apology for being a bitch and felt certain it was all an act for her father. Markko suggested that Langston forget about Lola as he pulled two tickets to the prom from his pocket. \"Dare to Dream\" was the theme. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Lola looked at a prom program and declared, \"Make your dreams come true. You bet I will.\" \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Blair received an unexpected guest when Todd showed up, ready to discuss custody of their kids. Chomping at the bit to tell her of John's imprisonment, Todd was disappointed when Blair informed him that she already knew. She was sure that John would be vindicated and that Todd would still be an idiot. She knew that John would never hurt a woman the way that Todd would. Todd advised her he was on his way to speak to the judge who would side with him about custody. \n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Michael was surprised when John sneaked up and grabbed him from behind \"You didn't?\" asked Michael. \"I did,\" replied John, \"and now I need your help.\" \n\n\nAt Michael's insistence, John hid while Michael went off to get the items John had requested. Leaving Blair's room, Todd ran into the pair, but did not recognize John, who was clothed in scrubs and a mask. John dashed into Blair's room as Michael advised the guards that they were not to allow anyone into the room. \n\n\nBlair was happy to see John, but worried and upset when she learned that he had escaped his jail cell. John understood, but stressed that he needed to clear his name and find the psycho responsible for the murders and Blair's stabbing. He apologized for not being around for Blair and the kids. She urged him to go, take care of business, and return. He kissed her soundly. \n\n\nSurprised to see RJ in the courtroom, T\u00e9a awkwardly asked him to pull up her zipper. Feeling uneasy himself, RJ wondered if she and Todd were back together. T\u00e9a insisted that she was in control and had even gone out on another date with a client, though it didn't work out. The man liked Dorian anyway, she explained. RJ agreed that it was dangerous to be between Dorian and her man. He suggested that T\u00e9a would be better off with anyone other than Todd. They reminisced about their old times together and how Todd had caught them together in the past. \n\n\nAs T\u00e9a and RJ comfortably sat next to each other and chatted, Todd walked in and spotted them. Coming up behind them, he hooked arms with T\u00e9a, just as she had with RJ. He mentioned how cozy they all were with T\u00e9a in the middle. RJ and T\u00e9a promised to meet with each other and catch up as T\u00e9a provided him with her private phone number. She and Todd proclaimed that another round of love-making was not going to happen. \n\n\nAnnouncing that he was there to see the judge because John had escaped, Todd declared that everything was falling into place. T\u00e9a was dismayed to hear of John's actions. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Michael received a call from Bo, but advised him that he had not heard from John. Bo headed to the hospital, anyway, sure that Michael was lying. Marching into Blair's room, he grabbed the doctor in the scrubs and mask. He was disappointed to find that it was Michael. \n\n\nSneaking into his room at the Angel Square Hotel, John grabbed a gun he had hidden away. Opening a door inside, he was greeted with a photo of Marty, held in place with a knife. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nora makes it clear to Rachel that she does not approve of her being Cole's drug counselor. But she accepts her daughter's decision until Lola barges into the office and demands to know why Rachel hasn't acted on the case of Markko helping Cole to falsify his drug test. RJ Gannon comes back and visits Tea. She admits to him that she still has feelings she wishes she didn't have for Todd. Todd is confident that he will win custody of his kids now that John has been charged with murder. John gets Antonio to help him bust out of jail and gets Michael to help him say good bye to Blair and investigate hospital evidence unseen. David comes back to surprise Dorian. But they both realize that they don't have a future together and she is interested in Ray.",
