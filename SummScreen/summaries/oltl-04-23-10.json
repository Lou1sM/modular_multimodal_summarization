Once Blair had finished the song, she noticed Eli, who applauded and told Blair that she had a beautiful voice. As Blair and Eli kissed, Ralph, the piano player, suggested taking a break. Eli explained to Blair that the deposition from his case had been moved back on the court docket and that he had wanted to find out what Blair actually did at Ultra Violet. When Blair teased him, Eli pretended to leave, but Blair stopped Eli with a kiss. Eli asked Blair about her pizza night with Jack, and Blair informed Eli that \"my dear, sweet, dear cousin Kelly, the killjoy\" had ruined it.\n\n\nBlair then related that Kelly and John had not yet found Melinda's murderer. Blair stated, however, that Kelly had taken questionable pottery made by Melinda to La Boulaie, and that Blair had informed her cousin that the vase had needed to be put in a closet. Insulted, Kelly had taken the vase away. Blair informed Eli that families fought. Eli said that he felt there was a lot more to it than just a family fight. Blair revealed that she had lost a baby in the past because of Kelly.\n\n\nAs Blair showed Eli her dead baby's birthstone on her bracelet, Blair told him that the car she had been riding in had hit a tree because Kelly, devastated from a breakup, had swerved into their lane. When Eli told Blair that he was sorry for the loss of Blair's baby, Blair insisted that she was lucky to have \"three beautiful children.\" However, Blair admitted that \"if push came to shove,\" Blair knew that Kelly would be there for her and vice versa.\n\n\nLater, as Blair sat at the piano, she looked at her bracelet and gazed off in the distance as she remembered her lost child.\n\n\nAs Starr was leaving her apartment, she found Hannah at the door. When Hannah realized that Cole was not home, she started to leave. Starr stopped her and suggested that they talk about how Hannah had been \"going after Cole.\" Starr told Hannah to make herself at home, and as Hannah walked into the living room, Starr asked if she could take Hannah's shirt. When Hannah tried to leave, Starr told her that she wanted \"to have this out.\" Hannah insisted that nothing was going on between herself and Cole and that they were just friends. Starr agreed and informed Hannah that since nothing would be going on between Hannah and Cole, Hannah could go back to obsessing over Ford.\n\n\nMaking two points very clear, Starr demanded that Hannah \"stop coming onto him\" and for her not to \"make him your knight in shining armor.\" Hannah replied that she just was there to talk to Cole, and Starr wanted to know why Hannah was \"so desperate to see Cole\" that time. Starr suspected that Ford was still stringing Hannah along. But Hannah said that if anyone was stupid enough to fall for Ford, it was Langston.\n\n\nIn the school hall, as Langston gazed at a poster for the prom, Ford asked if she had missed him. While Langston pushed Ford down the hall, Ford insisted that he felt that Langston wanted to forgive him. Langston reminded Ford that she was still mad at him. Langston explained that Markko had informed Langston, Starr, and Cole that Ford had entertained a girl in his room, and that Cole and Starr had guessed it was Langston. \n\n\n\"Starr made me swear on our friendship that I wasn't with you last night,\" exclaimed Langston, \"and that it was over between us.\" When Ford wanted to know if it was \"a pinky swear,\" Langston insisted that even though she had lied to Starr about the first part, the second part was true. Langston reminded Ford that he had indicated, when they first met, that her world was too narrow, and that she needed to open up her eyes. Langston claimed that her eyes were open, and it was time to move on. Ford declared, \"So, you used me.\"\n\n\nFord announced that he was falling in love with Langston. Langston and Ford both admitted to be stunned by his declaration, and Ford stressed that when Langston had left the hotel room, he had thought that she would return. Ford then whined that Markko received all of Langston's time, yet Ford was only allowed a few stolen moments with Langston. However, Ford told Langston, since Ford finally realized that he wanted more, it was too late. Ford exclaimed, \"You don't want me anymore, do you?\"\n\n\nFord admitted to Langston that he should have been honest about his feelings all along. Ford assessed that he and Langston could have been \"a real couple\" after Langston graduated. Ford then wished Langston the best with Markko and started to leave. Langston stopped Ford and pointed out that Ford had never told Langston about the way that he felt. \n\n\nLangston cried that it changed everything and that she was willing to give Ford another chance. Langston firmly stated that she would not go the prom, but Ford quieted her. Ford expressed his desire for Langston to go to her prom as long as she returned to him. Langston and Ford kissed.\n\n\nAt the hospital, John asked Natalie why she was in the stairwell. Natalie sarcastically responded that she was planning another murder, that she had returned to the scene of the crime, and that John had caught her \"lying in wait for my next victim.\" Natalie then warned John that he might be next. When John suggested that Natalie not be in the stairwell, Natalie emphasized that it would look like Natalie was responsible for Marty losing her baby, since Marty was in the process of being interviewed by Brody. Natalie insisted that she did not want to be around for a lynching, yet she had to stay in the stairwell to look for evidence. \n\n\nNatalie was trying to prove her innocence, but she questioned if John was trying to prove her guilty. John simply stated that he was just trying to find the truth. Natalie requested that John just \"look at his gut,\" and John agreed that he could not imagine Natalie wanting to hurt Marty. However, John explained that he had to look at the evidence and that he could not ignore all of the evidence against Natalie. Natalie was amazed that John could ever believe that Natalie would be capable of hurting the baby. Natalie stormed off, and John followed.\n\n\nIn the hospital elevator, John told Natalie that he knew Marty was telling the truth. Natalie cried that she also had been truthful and declared that she had already admitted to John about saying all of the bad things to Marty. As they walked off the elevator, Natalie reminded John that she and John had kissed, and that, at the time, John had promised Natalie a chance for the future as a couple. John tried to evade that by stating that it was not the time or the place for the discussion. Natalie announced to John that \"the minute you accused me of hurting Marty, you destroyed any future we could have had.\"\n\n\nLater, John found Natalie in the hospital hall. Natalie recognized that she understood that John had been in pain and had been suffering from the loss of the baby at the time of his questioning. However, Natalie was stunned that John would actually consider that she could hurt a pregnant woman, especially the mother of his child. She proclaimed that the man that she fell for could never consider that possibility and would know in his heart that she was innocent. She stressed, \"The longer you consider me a suspect, the longer the real perp has to cover his tracks.\"\n\n\nLater, in the stairwell, as John was searching for evidence, he found a hair caught in a crack on the stairs.\n\n\nIn the hospital lobby, Cole confronted Todd and demanded to know what Todd was doing. When Todd taunted Cole about cheating with \"some slutty coed,\" Cole warned Todd about not getting anywhere near Marty, especially after her miscarriage. Todd insisted that he was just at the hospital to ensure that Marty was all right, but Cole yelled that Todd had never cared about Marty or her family. Cole screamed, \"You think that I believe for one second that you care about my mom. You're not her friend...just some guy that raped her.\" After Todd called Cole an idiot, Cole declared that Todd lived just to see Marty suffer.\n\n\nIn Marty's hospital room, Brody stated that Marty had already told him about Natalie but questioned if Marty had seen Todd Manning also. Marty reflected back onto seeing Todd barge into her office and demand that she do something about Cole.Marty insisted to Brody that Todd had left, and that she had run into Natalie after that. Marty claimed that the next thing she had known, someone had pushed her down the stairs. Marty then asked Brody why Natalie was not yet in custody. Brody stated that he was simply interviewing Marty, and that he just had a few more questions regarding Todd. \n\n\nMarty reflected that Todd's threats had been first about Cole but later had been about the baby. Marty cried that Todd had blamed her for all of his problems. \"It's my fault he raped me. It's my fault he tormented me. It's my fault he can't maintain a normal relationship and that his children hate him. He blames me for everything wrong in his life,\" she said. Marty remembered telling Todd that no matter what Todd did, Marty, John, and their baby would be happy. And she also remembered Todd's comments of \"We'll see. We'll see.\" Brody and Marty heard a ruckus in the hall.\n\n\nCole and Todd were scuffling in the hall, with Cole yelling, \"You want my mom to lose the baby.\" Brody ran into the hall and broke up the shoving match. Brody demanded that Cole go into the room to see his mother.\n\n\nOnce Cole entered Marty's room, he told his mother that he was very sorry about her baby. Marty acknowledged his sorrow but made Cole promise that he would stay away from Todd. Marty then admitted to Cole that she had been pushed down the stairs, as John entered her room. Cole asked John who had pushed Marty. When John stated there was one suspect, Marty claimed that there were actually two. Marty, John, and Cole then speculated on who actually would have pushed Marty down the stairs.\n\n\nMarty made Cole promise that when he left her room, he would not go looking for Todd. Cole agreed not to and stated that he would call her later. After Cole left, Marty pondered to John why she would accuse Natalie when \"no one in this world would want to hurt us more than Todd.\"\n\n\nIn the hall, Brody asked Todd where he had been at 6:00 p.m. the previous night. Todd told Brody to talk to his lawyer as John walked out of Marty's room.\n\n\nHannah stated to Starr, \"If I would have known something so small would make you so insecure,\" she would not have bothered to reach out to Hannah's friend, Cole. Starr then announced that Cole's mom had just lost her baby, and that Cole needed time to heal. Starr insisted that the healing would be from her and not from Hannah, who should just stay away from Cole. Hannah indicated that Starr's message had been received. Cole arrived at the apartment and informed the girls that Todd had pushed Marty down the stairs, which had resulted in her miscarriage.\n\n\nIn the lobby of Melinda's institution, Kelly ran into Rodney. As Kelly picked up the phone and informed Rodney that she wanted to call his doctor, he grabbed her arm. Nervously, Kelly stated that she understood and that Rodney was right. Kelly further claimed that she and Rodney could talk or that she could talk, and Rodney could just listen. When Kelly informed him that she was going to get them water, Rodney begged, \"Wait...you can't go.\" Shocked, Kelly asked, \"Rodney, you can talk?\"\n\n\nRodney apologized for scaring Kelly and asserted that Kelly needed to know that Melinda had been murdered. When Kelly asked Rodney if he had been the one calling her, Rodney nodded. Kelly pleaded with Rodney to tell her who had killed Melinda. Kelly stated that since Rodney had been Melinda's friend, he needed to tell Kelly, so that nobody else would get hurt. Kelly asked, \"Did you see who killed her? Can you tell me her name?\" Rodney showed her John McBain's business card.\n\n\nRodney stuttered that he wanted to talk to John, and Kelly claimed that she would get John \"pronto.\" As Kelly left to get her car to take them to John, Rodney looked at the vase that Melinda had made for Kelly and said, \"Melinda.\"\n\n\nAs Kelly reentered the institution lobby to get Rodney, she remarked, \"Okay, Rodney, all set. Ready to go?\" Kelly gasped as she found Rodney on the floor, covered in flowers, while the water from Melinda's tipped-over vase dripped on him. \n\n\n",
