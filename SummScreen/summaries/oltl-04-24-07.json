Henry interrupted Britney and her friend to say that he thought of a way they could attend Heather's Sweet 16 together. Marcie returned and explained that the school board couldn't pay for the rights to use Oklahoma! or any other play. Before everyone left the auditorium, Marcie thanked the students for their help and challenged them to the rise to the occasion. No one seemed to care, so Marcie used a little reverse psychology herself to lay a major guilt trip on the kids. Henry surprised Britney by coming up with a great idea: Write the show themselves! Starr volunteered Langston, suggesting that her poetry would be great for songs. Just moments later, everyone was reading photocopies of Langston's work and praising its musical potential. Langston reluctantly gave her OK for them to use the work. \n\n\nThe woman from the adoption agency, Ms. Bromley, said she was willing to share information on a particular adoption case, but only if Todd could prove that the child is his. Todd admitted to Mrs. Bromley that he'd never even seen his son and has no way to prove anything other than that he really cares about his son. Todd started to get angry so Blair stepped in, talking about the disreputable agency that sent her from foster home to foster home as a child. Mrs. Bromley was sympathetic as Blair explained how wrong it is to keep a child away from their loving parents. Blair was sweet as pie as she convinced Mrs. Bromley that she'd be doing the right thing by retrieving the file. She left behind a photo of TJ, which Blair handed to Todd. \n\n\nRex frantically called Adriana, while flashing back to Tate's display on THE VIEW, then threw his phone at the TV. Adriana was asked to sign a release for her unscheduled appearance on THE VIEW and seethed over how Rex would react to the footage. Jamie was rushed into the hospital and Michael attended to her. Cristian held an emotional Antonio back as he tried to intervene. Rex regretted throwing his phone once he realized it didn't work. \"If that dumb jerk has hauled her off to his private batting cage...\" he mumbled as he called directory information to reach THE VIEW. Meanwhile, Adriana reamed out Tate for parading her around on national TV like she was his trophy girlfriend. Tate tried to pass it off as a publicity stint. Adriana was especially furious because of how Rex might interpret the situation. Tate threw her for a loop when he claimed that everything he did on set was for real. Rex reached Adriana via the hotel phone and asked if he'd just been dumped. Rex accused Adriana of wanting \"the Tate,\" and jumped up and down on his hotel couch as he asked what all that jumping was about. Adriana explained that it was out of her hands, and Tate asked to speak with Rex. \"The Rex\" requested to speak first. Rex threatened to doctor some photos that would ruin Tate, which seemed to rouse a little fear in Tate. Adriana and Rex smoothed things over, and Adriana headed to the limo. A dejected Tate replayed the footage while the production assistant informed him that he still had his mic on when he was arguing with Adriana. \"You were fun,\" the PA commented. Adriana sighed and got into the limo. \n\n\nVincent showed up at the Palace and approached Viki, asking if she'd seen Natalie lately. Viki remarked how odd it was that Vincent had such an intense interest in her daughter, then balked when he asked if it was odd that Natalie was friends with a black man. He apologized, saying he was keyed up over the hate-crime arsons. They turned the conversation back to Natalie, and Vincent expressed his concern over Natalie's breakup with John. Natalie needs to focus on herself now, he declared. \n\n\nAntonio cried and flailed around as Jamie was wheeled off to the trauma unit. Jessica, Antonio and Cristian sat outside wringing their hands as Antonio questioned how this could have happened. Carlotta and R.J. arrived after hearing the news. R.J. was livid to hear that no one was supervising Jamie when she left the loft. A guilty Jessica told R.J. that if he wants to blame someone, he can blame her. Playing the blame game is pointless, they all agreed. Paige arrived to deliver the good news that Jamie had pulled through, but Michael explained that she wasn't out of the woods because of pressure around her brain. Nash asked Jessica if he could stay, but Cristian pushed him aside. Meanwhile, Antonio told Jessica he needed her to be there. They agreed to not fight anymore, and Jessica stated that Jamie's all that matters now as Nash looked on. \n\n\nAfter Mrs. Bromley left, Todd and Blair toasted beers to the potential good news. Blair offered to look at the photo first, but Todd seemed more concerned with Blair's history in horrible foster homes. It could be worse, Todd noted. \"What if the people who adopted my son are turning him into ... me?\" he pondered. Blair assured Todd that she would provide a good life for his child. Todd told Blair that Starr and Jack only turned out okay because of Blair, which she took as a compliment. Alone, Todd looked at the photo of TJ as an infant, while Michael called Blair to tell Marcie he loved her and would be home soon.... Antonio and Jessica's hands touched as they sat vigil over Jamie and Antonio whispered a Spanish lullaby. Nash watched from the window. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex tries, frantically, to get in touch with Adriana after she had been on \"The View\" with Tate, and Tate had pretended that Adriana was his girlfriend. The secretary from the adoption agency comes to visit Todd and Blair. She lets him know that she remembers the case quite well, and she could supply him with valuable information about his son. She informs him that he has to supply her proof that he is the biological father. Marcie is on the phone with the school board. She argues with them when the board won't agree to the musical, \"Oklahoma.\" Marcie walks off from Starr, Cole and the other students. She comes back and informs them that the board will not appropriate the funds for the musical, \"Oklahoma.\" Jaime is brought into the hospital on a stretcher and a neck brace. They immediately take her into an emergency room. Vikki has a talk with Vincent concerning Natalie. Christian and Nash argue over Jessica. Nash informs Christian that he is going to say good-bye to Jessica and nothing is going to stop him. Jessica and Antonio share an intimate moment unbeknownst that Nash watches them. Vincent lets Vikki know that when Natalie makes up her mind what she wants to do, then the sky is the limit. Antonio and Jessica sit down by Jaime's bedside. Antonio holds Jaime's hand while Jessica places her hand on top of Antonio's . Rex finally manages to get through to Tate and Adriana. He blackmails Tate into leaving Adriana alone or he will be sorry. Adriana gets back on the phone with Rex and tells him that she loves him and he tells her that he loves her. After they hang up, Adriana confronts Tate about what he had done on stage to her in pretending that she was his special someone. Adriana signs a release order for her appearance on \"The View.\" Blair tries to hand Todd the picture of his baby that is in an envelope, but Todd refuses to take it. Blair tries to help him know that he is a good father to his other children. He pays her a compliment that the children wouldn't have turned out as good if it weren't for her. She thanks him for the compliment. She hands him the envelope and then leaves the hotel room. He opens the envelope and looks at his baby.",
