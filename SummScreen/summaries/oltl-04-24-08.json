She quickly called Dorian to learn that there was still no news on Brody Lovett's whereabouts. Dorian explained that she and Layla were hitting various eating spots in their search. Layla felt that something weird was definitely going on. Rex returned to Adriana and informed her that he had to leave. Doing her best to keep her man by her side, she tried to prevent him from departing. Adamant, he advised her that he had to get to B. E. to see Clint. \"You mean Gigi,\" Adriana replied brusquely. Once he was gone, she called Dorian again and learned the women were headed to the Norfolk Bar and Grill. \n\n\nAs Gigi and Shane had a meal together, Gigi watched as her son worked on a new comic book. She learned that he had received some ideas from Rex. She also found out that Shane was being teased at school for telling stories that no one believed about his hero dad. She suggested he avoid those kids. Shane asked why Gigi no longer spoke about his dad like she did before they moved to Llanview but she came up with an abundance of excuses. Looking more closely at her son's drawings, Gigi was alarmed that the bad guy, who was actually a woman named Evelyn Evil, resembled Adriana. Suggesting he change the face a bit, Shane refused. On their way out of the coffee shop, to drop Shane off at school, they stopped to exchange greetings with Nora and Renee. Nora immediately recognized the character but Gigi cut her short. Renee and Nora chatted about B.E. and Clint's taking on Asa's less than moral characteristics in his defense of the family legacy. Nora felt that she wouldn't be able to support Clint if he continued to use illegal methods in the business. Renee felt that Nora would have to accept him or lose him, much like it happened with herself and Asa. Renee also admitted that she originally felt uneasy about the relationship between Nora and Clint due to each of their past histories, but she was wrong, as they appeared to be happy together. She shared her motto of having to \"compromise, live and let live.\" \n\n\nAt B.E., Bo and Clint discussed the handling of Calvin Jenkins who was on his way over. Clint didn't agree but decided to let Bo play \"good cop.\" When Jenkins arrived, Bo chatted about old times and mentioned how Asa had always believed in him. Suddenly, Calvin asked to be left alone to make a phone call. The Buchanan brothers pondered Jenkins' motives for the call. Rex arrived and stopped to see Gigi as he waited for Clint. He asked her about her non-date with Jared and the kiss that they shared. He persisted in details until Gigi finally stopped him cold. She was tired of Rex telling her what to do with her life and decided that she and Shane would not attend his wedding. Rex was stunned, mentioning how much he loved Shane, and what a great kid he was. Gigi suggested that it wasn't right for him to say that because she didn't want to see Shane hurt. Eventually, Rex would have his own family and Shane would be forgotten, she reasoned with him. Rex assured her that he would always be there for Shane, even as Gigi replied that he wouldn't have the time. Also, she knew that Adriana didn't like her, Gigi told Rex quickly. She added that Adriana hated her because of their past together. Rex thought she was wrong and when his phone rang because Adriana was checking up on him, he asked her as much. He told her to tell Gigi she didn't have a problem with them being friends, as Gigi cringed.\n\n\nAntonio heard Michael tell him that Jamie was ill, and that he had conducted some additional tests after her last visit to him. She was suffering from a neurological disorder and if the illness ran its course, she wouldn't be the same kid. Antonio swore it was a mistake, even as Michael told him otherwise. He informed him that the disease was caught early and while there were lots of advances made, the treatments were considered experimental. This would mean that they weren't covered by insurance. Antonio promised that he would do whatever it took. The police station was silent as everyone within hearing distance was dismayed and overwhelmed. Talia looked at Antonio wordlessly and helplessly. He vowed that he would try to get the money together. Michael apologized that the hospital was already looking for an idea of when payments would be made. He also promised to deliver materials to Antonio on the illness. Antonio wanted it clear that this be kept quiet and ordered people nearby to keep it to themselves. Lee ordered Antonio to go home to be with Jamie. John tried to reassure Talia, telling her that it was not her fault that Antonio's life was a mess. Lee looked on and then made one of his puzzling phone calls. He told the party that he was handling things himself, that nothing would go wrong and that it would be him and Detective Vega. \n\n\nAntonio picked up Jamie at school and took her out for an ice cream sundae.\n\n\nCalvin called Dorian and told her that he wasn't able to do it and that it wasn't right. She coldly replied that she owned 35% of his company and would withdraw her support if he failed. The company would also look for a new CEO. He asked her why she was so hateful, to which she responded that he'd respect her if she were a man. Clint received the file from Rex and read some disturbing news on Jenkins' son. Rex wasn't very happy with the information that he shared though Clint called it the motherlode. He suggested that Rex wasn't in the right business if he wasn't happy with that. Bo returned to Calvin and learned that things weren't going too well and that Calvin wouldn't be able to back off. He left abruptly. Bo and Clint figured that someone was twisting Calvin's arm with Clint deciding it was time to break it off. \n\n\nDorian quickly spoke to Adriana, advising her that they had found Brody Lovett. Adriana told her to hurry home with him so that he and Gigi could reunite.\n\n\nAt the bar and grill, Layla and Dorian headed to the man dressed in uniform, as they presumed him to be Brody. The man agreed to sit and talk to them. The trio shared a table as Dorian went on and on about Gigi and her son and about Brody's dead mother who lied to him. As they talked, the place became noisy. The man was confused. He mentioned that he had just spoken to his mother that very morning and she wouldn't lie. He finally heard that the women thought that he was Brody. As a fight broke out behind them, he assured them that he was not Brody. He pointed to a man in the middle of the melee and enlightened them that he was their man. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Michael goes to the station and gives Antonio startling information that Jamie has a serious disease. And it' will be very expensive for him to get medical care. John, Talia and Ramsey overhear and are concerned. Ramsey tells Antonio that he'll let him take a medical leave and will hold his job for him. Dorian and Layla are on their way to finding Brody Lovett for Adriana. She is very insecure about Rex spending so much time with Shane. Clint and Bo are admitting that they do business differently. But Bo and Nora have concerns that maybe Clint is turning into Asa. Calvin Jenkins is considering backing out of his agreement with Dorian after Bo has talked to him diplomatically. And he can't decide which direction he wants to go in.",
