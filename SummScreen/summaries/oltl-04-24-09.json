After retrieving his revolver, John spotted a picture of Marty affixed to the closet door, with a knife pierced through it. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Fish questioned Roxy concerning John's whereabouts. As Roxy argued that John would never kill anyone, Kyle entered the hotel and referred to John as the KAD killer. When Fish insisted that John wasn't the murderer, Kyle stated that he hoped that none of their fraternity brothers were implicated. Frustrated, Kyle ran upstairs in search of John. \n\n\nFish approached the officer standing guard outside of John's apartment. The two men both agreed that John would never return his apartment. \n\n\nIn order to preserve any fingerprints, John removed the knife and picture from the wall with a towel. John carefully placed the items in his bag and exited the apartment through the window. Upon hearing noises from the apartment, Fish and the other officer entered with their guns drawn. There was no sign of John. \n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Marty watched news reports that named John as the suspected serial killer and detailed his escape from prison. Marty was shocked to turn around and discover John in her room. When John showed Marty the knife and the photo of herself, Marty realized that she was possibly the killer's next target. John related that he would attempt to recover any prints left on the weapon. \n\n\nMeanwhile, outside of Marty's hotel room, an unknown person, dressed as a hotel attendant, pushed a food cart toward Marty's door. After positioning the cart in front of Marty's door, the killer hid a knife under a napkin. \n\n\nBack inside Marty's room, John insisted on finding a safe retreat for her, but Marty refused to allow John to search for the killer without her. Realizing that he couldn't change Marty's mind, John agreed to allow her to help him. John insisted that they exit her hotel room through the window. At that very moment, the killer used a passkey to open Marty's hotel door. With a knife in hand, the killer entered the room. Once inside, the killer picked up the photo of Marty and realized that she had escaped with John. \n\n\nRoxy told Kyle that she needed his help concerning John Doe. As Roxy informed Kyle that the patient was no longer unresponsive, Rex interrupted and demanded to know if the patient that they were referring to was Shane. Roxy denied keeping secrets from Rex. Attempting to evade Rex's interrogation, Roxy questioned why Rex was carrying a bouquet of flowers. \n\n\nBack upstairs, Stacy, insisting that the blood transfusion had left her physically exhausted, attempted to get Schuyler to wait on her. To her surprise, Schuyler presented Stacy with her blood donation, which he had retrieved from the medical waste bin. Schuyler was certain that Stacy's blood was in the medical bag and that Shane had actually received a donation from another source. A nervous Stacy tried to convince Schuyler that he was mistaken, but Schuyler continued to press Stacy for the truth. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Gigi tried to make conversation with Jessica, but Jessica treated her coldly. Gigi looked sad as Jessica brushed past her and joined Jared. Reminding Jared that she had set up a meeting with both him and Natalie, Jessica wondered where her sister was. Jared related that Natalie was upset by Brody's treatment of Jessica and she had decided to pay him a visit. Horrified, Jessica ran off to prevent her sister from confronting Brody. \n\n\nIn the lobby of the Angel Square Hotel, Gigi entered the room just as Rex admitted that the flowers in his possession were for Stacy. Gigi remarked, \"That didn't take long!\" When Gigi made a negative comment about Stacy, Rex quickly reminded her that Stacy had saved Shane's life. After informing Gigi that Shane had requested that Rex bring Stacy flowers as a thank you gift, Rex commented that Gigi appeared jealous and questioned why. \n\n\nAs Gigi and Rex continued to bicker, Kyle pulled Roxy to the side and related that he needed a place to stay. Threatening to reveal her secret to Rex, Kyle demanded that Roxy give him a rent-free apartment in exchange for his silence. Roxy and Kyle made plans to discuss the matter at a later date. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Rex was frustrated by Gigi's anger toward Stacy and stormed off. As Rex walked away, a saddened Gigi insisted that she only wanted to see Rex happy. Overhearing the argument, Roxy approached Gigi and pleaded with her to expose Stacy's scheme to Rex. Gigi continued to state that she had made a promise to God and feared that Shane's condition might regress if she went back on her word. \n\n\nWhile Roxy tried desperately to turn the tables on Stacy, Jessica entered the hotel. Spotting Gigi, Jessica frowned and headed up to Brody's apartment. Consumed with guilt, Gigi said that she regretted causing Jessica pain. Finally, Roxy convinced Gigi to tell Rex the truth. Roxy smiled as Gigi headed upstairs to expose Stacy's misdeeds. \n\n\nAlone with her thoughts, Roxy spoke out loud. Recalling her encounter in which John Doe choked her, Roxy said that she needed to speak with Kyle about John Doe's apparent recovery. As Roxy continued to express her fear of the patient regaining consciousness, the chipmunk began to speak to her. The chipmunk suggested that Roxy pull the plug on the ailing patient. \n\n\nAs Brody opened his front door, Natalie greeted him with a punch to the chest. Natalie chastised Brody for hurting Rex and Jessica by sleeping with Gigi. Brody tried to convince Natalie that things weren't as they appeared to be, but Natalie continued to rant at him. Jessica arrived and quickly put a stop to Natalie's tirade. Jared arrived moments later and convinced Natalie to leave Jessica and Brody alone. \n\n\nBack inside Schuyler's apartment, Schuyler continued to accuse Stacy of lying about donating her stem cells to Shane. As Stacy denied Schuyler's accusations, Rex knocked on the door and called out to her. Glaring at Schuyler, Stacy headed toward the door and snapped, \"I'll kill you if you tell him!\" \n\n\nEntering the apartment, Rex received a warm welcome from Stacy and a cold stare from Schuyler. Stacy was pleased that Rex brought her flowers, but he quickly informed her that the bouquet was from Shane and that he was only the messenger. As Stacy tried to engage Rex in conversation, Schuyler looked upset and made his presence felt. Stacy suggested that Schuyler leave, but he refused and began questioning Rex about Shane's medical procedure, and Stacy's role as bone marrow donor. An uncomfortable Rex insisted that he needed to get back to Shane, and left the apartment. Stacy ran after him. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Stacy thanked Rex for checking on her and gave him a loving hug. As Stacy and Rex shared an embrace, Gigi emerged and stared into Stacy's cold eyes. Stacy smiled as tears welled up in Gigi's eyes. Stacy's smile grew wider as Gigi turned and walked away. \n\n\nMoments later, Schuyler stepped out into the hall just as Rex pulled away from Stacy. Holding the bag of blood that he had retrieved from the medical waste bin, Schuyler told Rex that there was something that he needed to see. \n\n\nAs Gigi wandered down the hall, she overheard Brody and Jessica's discussion. Unable to reveal the truth to Jessica, Brody tried to convince her that he had feelings for her as well. Unwilling to cause Jessica any more pain, Gigi begged Brody to tell Jessica the truth. Brody ushered Jessica back inside the apartment and stepped back out to converse with Gigi. Gigi insisted that Brody tell Jessica that they never slept together. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Starr and Cole discussed learning the truth surrounding Hope's death. Starr told Cole that they could use the lock of Hope's hair to conduct a DNA test. She was certain that the test could provide them with some answers. \n\n\nWhen Starr mentioned that she had conducted a DNA experiment with Schuyler and suggested that he could help them, Cole was outraged and stated that Starr couldn't seem to ever stop thinking about Mr. Joplin. Starr reminded Cole that they had agreed to put their differences aside in hopes of finding justice foe Hope. Starr noticed that Cole was sweating and appeared to be under the weather. When she questioned if he was still using drugs, Cole denied being under the influence. Starr assumed that he was possibly exhibiting withdrawal system and wondered if he needed medical assistance. \n\n\nStarr and Cole arrived at the hospital lab. Starr explained the circumstances surrounding Hope's death to Kyle and asked him to conduct a DNA test. Kyle related that he could conduct a genetic profile that would tell if the child died of a genetic disorder. Starr was certain that her request was a strange one, but Kyle informed her that another couple had conducted the very same test recently. Cole excused himself and stepped out into the hall. After spotting a tray containing a bottle of pills, Cole stole the medication. \n\n\nAfter Starr and Cole had left, Kyle had a flashback of Natalie and Jared asking him to perform the very same DNA test. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Jared wondered if Natalie was feeling guilty about their decision to hide Chloe's true identity. Natalie and Jared both admitted that they had second thoughts, but agreed that they had done what was best for all the concerned parties. As Natalie reminded Jared that Starr hadn't planned on keeping her child, Starr and Cole entered the caf\u00e9. \n\n\nCole continued to sweat profusely and exhibit signs of sickness. Cole excused himself again and headed for the restroom. Once inside, Cole removed the bottle of pills from his pocket and stared at the medication. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Cole placed the bottle back in his pocket and returned to Starr.\n\n\n",
