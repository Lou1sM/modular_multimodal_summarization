But she just can't see herself shuffling papers for the rest of her life though she has no idea of what she might do instead. They will miss each other. Vincent is at the station on behalf of Sean's grandparents and the arson case and runs into Evangeline. He can tell that she's preoccupied but she doesn't want to talk about it.  She does advise him not to do anything stupid as far as the arsonists go. He sees Natalie packing her things and is happy to learn that she's quit but Nat is quite cynical about it. She has no other job. Vincent is quick to give her some encouragement by pointing out all of her great traits. This gives her an idea. Before he heads out, Vincent stops in Bo's office and offers his services on the arson investigation. He has resources that the police don't have and he'd like to join forces. Bo expresses his thanks but would like the charges to stick and wants everything legal. Vincent understands and only hopes that Bo finds the suspects before he does.\n\n\nJohn runs into Marty at the Palace bar and they end up discussing a case. When John is able to read Marty's psych profile on a suspect, he immediately calls it merely generic and ruffles Marty's feathers. She calls him rude and he does apologize but she offers to hear him out; she can tell that something is bothering him. He thinks that Michael is involved in something. She thinks it's something else and asks about Nat, calling him \"snarky.\" He is not amused and she promises not to tease him again. She was trying to get a reaction out of him. They move to a table; she thanks him again for helping Cole, mentions her own somewhat turbulent teenage years that she won't mention to her son, and learns that John never had the chance to be anything other than the man of the house, much like Cole has to be now. John assures her that things will be better for Cole than they were for him. Marty says one has to move on and not have regrets which sparks quite a reaction in John. He hates the term moving on and it's not always possible. Things will be fine for Cole thanks to her, he says. Upstairs, Miles receives a visit from a hooker named Jordan. He asks her to teach him how to pleasure a woman because he's in love. She finds it quite difficult to believe that he's a virgin. She guides him step by step and he does extremely well, while Miles praises her teaching skills.\n\n\nTodd insists that the baby's picture is merely that, a picture of a baby. There are no distinguishing features. He and Blair argue over her being there but she insists that she's there to help and they're not leaving until they get answers. She looks at the picture and swears she sees a resemblance to Jack which causes another argument. She's just trying to get him to have feelings, he complains. And he's just been failing his son from the beginning. Blair keeps urging him to look at the picture again but he refuses. He can only see Margaret and believes that holds true for Blair as well. She really doesn't see Jack or Starr. She sees hope and promise, she replies. He thinks that's very touching but how would he explain to his son how he came to be? That wouldn't be any kind of hope or promise. It's better if they don't find him. Plus, he wouldn't be able to raise the boy by himself. She points out all of the support that he would have and tells him what a wonderful father he is. He's only lacking as a husband and human being, she teases. He asks her to help him raise the baby if they find him and she promises she'll be there. For as long as he needs her, she cries. When Todd holds the baby they will know each other. \n\n\nCris is sitting in Angel Square and having an erotic daydream about Evangeline when he sees Layla. When he mentions that he's upset about the baby, Layla is shocked that he knows but quickly recovers and asks what baby? She  learns about Jamie's accident but Cris heard what Layla said. He pushes, she won't answer. Finally, he asks if Evangeline is pregnant. He's advised to get in touch with her himself. He tries to reach her by phone and is unsuccessful. Suddenly, there she is and he asks her point blank. She has nothing to tell him, she retorts and as she walks away he grabs a bag from her hand. Inside is a home pregnancy test. \n\n\nThe Buchanans celebrate the good news that Jamie will be alright and there's good-natured teasing going on regarding Nora's continued residence at the Buchanan mansion. Renee receives a phone call that a high class hooker has been spotted on the premises of the Palace and apologizes for having to leave. As she heads out, Natalie arrives to see Asa alone. She wants to work at B.E. she tells him. He's thrilled. \n\n\nRenee runs into Jordan as she exits Miles' suite and demands to know what she's doing there. She knows who Jordan is as she has quite a reputation. Jordan is quite surprised and first says she was visiting a friend. After Renee compliments her and agrees to let her slide this time, she admits to feeling badly at taking money from Miles since he's such a sweet guy. \n\n\n",
