    "soap_central": "\n \nT\u00e9a found Blair at Capricorn as Blair remembered and missed her unborn son, Brendan. Blair was surprised that T\u00e9a wanted her help, as T\u00e9a explained that she had convinced Todd that Dani's role as Starr in the school musical would help Dani to understand and learn more about Todd. Blair thought T\u00e9a had been right to say that, but T\u00e9a had begun to doubt herself.\n\n\nBlair thought that T\u00e9a had made the right move and was certain that the musical might get Dani and Todd to feel closer. Blair noted that similar steps like art therapy, writing her feelings, and expressing herself with acting had helped her when she was in foster care. She knew it all had saved her life and put her in touch with all of her music. T\u00e9a was surprised to learn this about Blair, who informed T\u00e9a there was a lot about Blair that T\u00e9a didn't know. Blair thought the play was real, fair, and actually pretty good, and thought it would help Dani to understand Todd better.\n\n\nDestiny was shocked to see Langston and Ford kissing in the school gymnasium when she walked into the room for the musical rehearsal. Quickly, she changed her mind and headed back out to the hallway, where she saw Matthew. Inside the gym, Langston and Ford hated to say goodbye to each other.\n\n\nDestiny stopped Matthew from going into the gym and explained that she had \"butterflies.\" Thinking twice, she opted to tell him the truth and told him that a couple was \"making out.\" Matthew assumed it was Dani and Nate if it involved a kiss, but they turned up for rehearsal just at that moment. Awkwardly, Matthew claimed that he and Destiny were talking about the musical.\n\n\nMarkko arrived next and Destiny tried to prevent him from walking into the gymnasium without success. Fortunately, Ford left through another door and Langston was the one who remained behind. Stuttering, Langston advised Markko that she was there early for some \"regrouping\" while Markko announced that he planned on recording everything for a video diary. He wanted Langston to always remember the musical she had written and everything about it. He loved her and was proud of her, and no one loved her like he did. Destiny stood by and sadly shook her head.\n\n\nMr. G showed up and told the group that he would be playing Todd, and he wanted to rehearse the Todd and Starr scenes again. He thought they were very important, and they needed to see where Todd was \"coming from.\" Dani said wryly, \"I can't promise I'll be feeling the love.\"\n\n\nKelly was distraught when she found Rodney on the office floor at the Sun. She tried to wake the man up without success, realized he was dead, and finally decided that she should call John.\n\n\nNatalie stood in Marty's hospital room and expressed her sorrow over Marty's loss of the baby. She insisted that while she had said some awful things, she would never have hurt Marty or her baby, and she wasn't the one who had pushed Marty down the stairs. She knew she had a big mouth, but she was only there to apologize. Natalie explained that Marty had already fallen when she first saw her. Marty remained silent during Natalie's discourse but finally, she spoke up. \"Shut up!\" she hollered. She wanted to know if Natalie was really there to apologize or to see if the baby was the only reason John had been with Marty.\n\n\nNatalie agreed that she deserved that remark and advised Marty that she hadn't meant what she said, and she knew she had been hurtful. She was sorry that Marty had heard Natalie's remarks to Brody, and she asked if Marty believed her. Angrily, Marty shouted that it wasn't about Natalie. All she knew was that the day before she was pregnant and then she wasn't, Marty said as she began to weep.\n\n\nMarty advised Natalie that Natalie didn't get to clear her conscience or \"wipe your slate clean.\" She pointed out that Natalie's life would go on the same as ever while Marty's life had changed. She had finally accepted the fact that the baby was real after three months; Marty wept. She had wondered who it might look like or if it would play sports or the piano. Tears began to roll down Natalie's face as Marty spoke. Marty stopped suddenly and recalled that John hadn't heard the baby's heartbeat, and she had wanted that for him on her next doctor's visit. She cried that one minute she was \"full of life\" and the next she was empty.\n\n\nJohn bombarded Todd with questions as he and Brody had Todd cornered in the hospital. While Todd remained silent, John yelled and asked if Todd were only a tough guy when he was with Marty. He wanted to know if Todd was trying to show Marty that she was still a victim. John accused Todd of hurting the baby because Todd was unable to raise Starr's baby with Marty and he didn't want Marty to have one of her own with John. Todd couldn't stand to see Marty happy, John shouted.\n\n\nA phone started to ring and Todd finally spoke and pointed out that it wasn't his phone, so it was obviously Brody's or John's. The cops ignored it as they questioned Todd, who questioned whether the men had a warrant or if they were arresting him. He laughed that they didn't have evidence and he walked off. The phone began to ring again, and John answered Kelly's call. She told him about Rodney, and he assured her he was on his way. He handed Brody the bagged clothing fiber he had found in the stairwell as evidence in Marty's assault. Brody promised to get it to the lab immediately.\n\n\nNatalie tried to comfort Marty, who leaned over with her head down on the bed. Marty waved her off just as Brody arrived. He explained that John had left on an emergency. Marty asked Brody and Natalie to leave her alone, and the pair walked out into the hallway. Brody wondered why Natalie was there, and she sighed and said that she was apparently \"making a bad situation worse.\" She wasn't sure if she had gone to apologize to Marty or pronounce her innocence, but she didn't think that Marty believed her. Brody thought it was possible that Marty did believe her and didn't blame Natalie anymore. There was a new suspect, and Marty was focused on Todd.\n\n\nCole arrived home to find Starr and Hannah together, and he informed them that Marty had been pushed down the stairs, which had caused her to lose her baby. Hannah made her way to the door and cited that Cole and Starr needed to have privacy. Though she ran out into the hallway, she stood outside of the door, which remained slightly ajar. She listened intently to the conversation inside of the apartment.\n\n\nNot in the best of moods, Cole growled that both he and Marty believed it was Todd who had pushed Marty down the stairs. He revealed that Todd had probably wanted to know that Marty's baby had been \"finished off,\" as Cole had seen Todd looking at Marty's chart in the hospital. Adamantly, Cole remarked that it had been Todd's \"life mission\" to hurt Marty because Todd had always hated Marty and Cole. He reminded Starr about Todd's desire to see Cole and Starr break up. Todd had also informed Marty in her office that he wanted Marty, Cole, and the baby to disappear, Cole revealed.\n\n\n\"Your dad has lost it,\" Cole told Starr, who couldn't believe that Todd would have committed such an act as pushing Marty. She suggested that it had been an accident, which didn't sit well with Cole. He asked if everything that Todd had done had also been accidental. She suggested they wait for an investigation to show some evidence of Todd's guilt, but Cole accused her of taking Todd's side. He asked if Starr believed that Marty was a liar. Starr had enough, gathered her things, and left the apartment. Hannah hid until Starr was gone and then walked back into the apartment.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the Sun, and Kelly explained how Rodney had shown up suddenly and told her that Melinda had been murdered. Yes, Rodney was able to talk, Kelly added quickly. She blamed herself for leaving the man alone when she went to call John.\n\n\nJohn spoke to Mrs. Stevens at the California facility and learned that the police had been searching for Rodney. A devastated Mrs. Stevens had no idea how Rodney had traveled to Llanview alone. Kelly told John that Rodney had wanted to speak to John, and Rodney was there to find justice for Melinda and peace for Kelly. John was certain that Melinda's killer had also killed Rodney to keep him quiet. He leaned over the body and pulled a couple of cards from Rodney's hand. One was John's business card and the other was a baseball card of Carl Yastrzemski. Kelly wondered if it were a clue. She also wanted to know why John hadn't answered his phone. He disclosed that he and Marty had lost their baby.\n\n\nA saddened Kelly gave John a hug and expressed her sorrow. She wondered how he was, and he replied, \"You know me, I'm fine.\" She knew he was looking forward to being a father. He quickly changed the subject and vowed to find the killer.\n\n\nAs Mr. G and Dani rehearsed their lines, Todd peeked into the gym and caught Dani's eye. Mr. G, as Todd, told Dani, as Starr, how he had loved her from the minute he had seen her and worried that he was a bad father if he loved her too much or made some mistakes. He would die for her and, even if she hated him, he would still be her father, Mr. G said as he read his lines. Dani continued to look at Todd, who stood at the door. She recalled a similar conversation she had previously with Todd.\n\n\nAfter they were finished, Nate exclaimed that Dani had been very intense, and he could tell she was \"feeling\" the scene. Dani explained that she had seen Todd at the door and it was like she had seen him for the very first time. Nate thought that she looked like she could really believe that Todd loved her. He called her performance seamless, and he could really feel something in the scene. Dani admitted that she had felt something too. Nate realized that it was more than just acting.\n\n\nNext up, Matthew and Destiny rehearsed their scene as Markko and Langston as the real couple looked on. Up on the stage, as \"Langston\" voiced her love for \"Markko,\" the real Markko remembered how that had been the happiest day of his life. He pointed out to Langston that every day he was still just as happy. Mr. G gave some direction and told Matthew that he had to \"put it all on the line\" for his girl.\n\n\nThe teacher advised Destiny, obviously grumpy, to get into Langston's character and show her vulnerability. It was at a time when Langston had just lost her parents and this young man was there for her. It was a very poignant time, Mr. G pointed out. Destiny proclaimed that she was \"working out the kinks,\" but she continued to look in Langston's direction with extreme loathing. Matthew wondered if Destiny was angry at Langston. Destiny told him that Langston was \"the biggest hypocrite on the planet.\"\n\n\nStarr and Todd ran into each other in the school hallway. Starr revealed that she already knew what had happened and that Cole had accused Todd of pushing Marty. Todd inquired whether Starr believed Cole and if she thought Todd would have done it. \"Did you?\" she asked him. He denied that he had pushed Marty and swore that he would never do such a thing. He swore on his life and his love for Starr. \"Tell me you believe me,\" he demanded.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was concerned and worried that Dani might learn to understand Todd but then have another reason to hate him. \"Did Todd do something?\" Blair asked right away. She realized that the real reason for T\u00e9a's visit had been to talk about Todd. They were interrupted when Ford arrived to talk to Blair and T\u00e9a received a phone call.\n\n\nBlair was brusque with Ford, who asked for a corner and very private table for that evening. He had someone special to take to dinner, he confided. Blair gruffly threatened to \"slap him silly and that's a start\" if she learned that his date was Langston. Ford swore that he and Langston had broken things off. He was going to accompany a noted film director, Alfonso del Toro, and he wanted everything to be special. He also wanted a bouncer to protect the man from ogling fans and the paparazzi.\n\n\nBlair returned to T\u00e9a, who was about to finish up her phone call. She wondered if everything was all right with T\u00e9a, who had mentioned test results to someone. T\u00e9a assured her she was fine and Blair wanted to get back to the matter at hand. T\u00e9a told her about Marty, and Blair wanted to know what it had to do with Todd. T\u00e9a confessed that she thought Todd might have been the one who had pushed Marty down the stairs.\n\n\nFord left Capricorn and sent a text message to Langston, \"R U ok? Did M see me?\"\n\n\nMarkko asked Langston if she had any water, but Mr. G asked to speak to Langston about one of the scenes. She told Markko she had plenty in her bag and he could help himself. Markko left the camera on and began to rifle through Langston's purse. Her cell phone began to flash as he put it down on the table. \"New message from Ford,\" it said.\n\n\nDestiny confessed to Matthew that she had seen Langston \"making out\" with someone earlier, and it wasn't Markko. She believed that Langston was only using Markko. As she spoke, the camera continued to record the scene.\n\n\nHannah wanted to comfort Cole, and she told him she had something to tell him about his mother. She had been at the hospital when Marty had fallen, as she had gone to set up an appointment with Marty. She began to cry as she told him she had seen Marty take the stairs and had followed her. As Hannah drew out the turn of events, Cole demanded to know if she were the one who had pushed Marty. She felt that it was all her fault, but she insisted that she wasn't the one who had committed the crime. Cole urged her to get on with her story and finally, Hannah admitted that she saw who had pushed Marty.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marty is distraught to have lost her baby regardless of who pushed her. Cole tells Starr he knows that her father did it. She asks him how he can assume that without proof. Hannah reveals to Cole that she knows who pushed Marty. Kelly and John notice that Rodney travelled all the way from the California hospital to find her and tell her who killed her mother and somebody killed him. And they assume it's the same person who killed her mother. Langston and Ford are making out assuming they are alone in the high school gym when Destiny sees them. They don't know that and Langston continues to play her \"role\" with Markko. But Destiny informs Matthew what she saw and admits she had problems playing Langston in the school musical now that she knows she's a hypocrite.",
