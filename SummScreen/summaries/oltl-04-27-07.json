Jessica covered by advising Jamie not to worry about anything but getting better. Jamie told Jess that she still wants her to be her mommy. Natalie found Nash at the hospital and asked what he was doing there. He insisted that he wasn't there to harass Jessica, he just wanted to see how Jamie was doing. \"Send a card next time,\" Nat advised him. Natalie informed John that she quit her job at the station. Layla found her apartment door slightly ajar ... and Vincent sitting inside in the dark. Cristian confronted Evangeline about why she hadn't mentioned that she might be pregnant. He asked whether Evangeline was even sure that he would be the father, suggesting it might be Todd's. \n\n\nBlair and Todd advised Starr to have fun at the party, but stay away from Cole. Starr told her father to be careful on his search. After Blair settled in for a nap, Todd received a call from Mrs. Bromley and wrote down some info on a notepad. Todd stroked a sleeping Blair's face before heading out. \n\n\nAt the party, Cole gazed at Starr from across the room. Clad in a straw skirt and two coconut shells, Britney was staring at Starr, too. Henry called Britney's cell and wondered about the noise in the background. She coughed and pretended to be sick. Langston overheard Britney lie to Henry and thank him for finishing the paper. Heather explained to Starr that she invited Starr and Cole when they were still dating, then pointed out some other potential hook-ups. Langston called out Britney on her deception. Britney countered by saying she'd blab Langston cheated on her mid-term. Starr and Cole both seemed miserable. Langston informed Starr about what Britney was doing to Henry. \"Well, sometimes people will do stupid things when they like someone a lot,\" Starr commented, just as Cole approached. \n\n\nJessica seemed anxious in Jamie's hospital room. \"We still need you,\" he told her. Jessica was saved by a call from The Sun office and told Antonio she had to go help out in Todd's absence. Jess ran off, and Natalie remarked to John how stressed her sister seemed. \n\n\nEvangeline was upset that Cristian would even ask about her and Todd, but he felt it was a valid question. She tried to kick him out, but he apologized for not believing her and said whatever the outcome was, he would support her. Evangeline went to take the test. \n\n\nVincent told Layla he was there to make sure she was okay since there was a racist arsonist on the loose. They discussed Tate's move on THE VIEW, and Layla noted that the Exposed phones hadn't stopped ringing. Vincent pointed out that everything in Layla's life seems perfect \u2014 except that she doesn't have a boyfriend. \"I don't need a man,\" she declared, prompting him to turn her words into song lyrics. He advised her to think about giving the men of Llanview a shot ... and to think about locking her doors. \n\n\nJohn pointed out that it was kind of a coincidence that Natalie quit right after their awkward moment in the locker room. She said it had more to do with her and her future, like getting involved in Buchanan Enterprises. John said he thought she was making a big mistake by putting herself Asa's thumb, but she said she was actually excited about working for her grandfather. \"As long as you're happy,\" he told her. \"That's all I've ever wanted for you.\" \n\n\nLangston threatened to embarrass Britney by \"planting a hot one\" on her at the party. Henry called again to tell Britney that he finished the paper ... and that he misses her. Langston then made another comment about \"sucking face\" with Britney if she didn't stop staring at Cole and Starr. Cole admitted to Starr that it felt right to be hanging out with her and asked her to dance. Starr was torn and admitted that she didn't know how much longer she could go on without giving in, but asked if it was really worth it. She started to walk away, then turned to face Cole as a ballad played and everyone watched. \n\n\nAntonio flashed back to Jamie saying Jessica was sorry about the \"court and the kissing.\" He thanked God for saving Jamie and bringing Jessica back safely. \"I don't know what I would have done if I'd lost them,\" he said aloud. Meanwhile, Nash burst into The Sun offices to say he couldn't stand being without Jessica for another second. After some convincing, Jessica locked the office door and jumped Nash. They got down to business on Todd's desk. \n\n\nTodd wandered around a dirty tenement building following the sound of a baby crying. Getting closer to the sound, he broke down the door and spotted a bassinet across the room. Blair sighed Todd's name in her sleep, just as a masked person stabbed Todd in the side and left him lying on the floor. \n\n\n\n\n",
