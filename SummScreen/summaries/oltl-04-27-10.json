    "soap_central": "\n \nAt Llanfair, a clueless Viki left a message for Marty and apologized for having missed her at dinner the night before. Just as Viki hung up the phone, an unsuspecting Gigi walked through the kitchen door and was both shocked and happy to see that Viki had returned. Gigi laughed and said that she was returning the cookie cutters she had borrowed in the fall, though Viki assured her they weren't missed. Viki admitted there had been no change in Jessica, who was still stuck in the past. Viki was hopeful that Marty would find the key to unlock Jessica's memory so that Jessica could remember events and people from her past like her brother Rex.\n\n\nGigi sighed as she confessed that there had been lots of happenings while Viki had been gone. One of them was that Rex and Jessica were not really brother and sister, since it turned out that Roxy and Mitch were not Rex's parents. Allison had provided the information and Rex's real parents were an unknown. \"Oh, my God, poor Rex,\" Viki groaned. Gigi explained that Roxy hadn't known so it wasn't her fault. Gigi couldn't understand Rex's moods, since he either didn't seem to care or would get quiet as if he felt ashamed. Viki stated that everyone wanted to know where they were from, but Rex was lucky to have Gigi.\n\n\nGigi wasn't too sure that Rex wanted help from her, but Viki disagreed. Gigi remembered how happy Gigi and Rex had been before Stacy showed up, and Viki quickly blamed Stacy for all that had happened. She believed that Gigi shouldn't feel guilty about anything and that Gigi should get on with her life either with or without Rex. Gigi confessed that she couldn't picture her life without Rex, but they were only connected by their son. Viki made up different scenarios, like waking up in the middle of the night after a bad dream, and asked Gigi who she would call. Gigi admitted that Rex was her best friend.\n\n\nViki made it clear that she had felt the same way towards Charlie because he had let both Viki and himself down. She thought that Charlie had lost sight of who he was but then he found sobriety and made his way back. They were reunited, she informed Gigi, and she thought there was a lot to say about the \"power of love.\" People would always make mistakes and people would have to learn to forgive. She concluded that the first step was to \"know what you want.\"\n\n\nGigi reflected that she doubted herself sometimes but thought that maybe she should leave town with Shane. After all, it had worked for Viki, she pointed out. Viki quickly voiced her opinion that it was a bad idea for Gigi and things had been much more involved. She believed that Gigi could get past all that had happened, and whatever was right for Charlie and Viki was not necessarily right for Gigi and Rex. She thought that Gigi and Rex had a good beginning and that Gigi could help Rex with his newly found awareness of not knowing who his biological parents were.\n\n\nDuring a break in the musical rehearsal in the high school gymnasium, Destiny divulged to Matthew that she had seen Langston \"making out\" with an unknown \"dude\" and it definitely wasn't Markko. Matthew was shocked and suggested that perhaps it was Mr. G. \"Ugh,\" Destiny shuddered as the video camera that Markko had set to record rehearsals continued to run. Destiny thought that it might be a teaching assistant from the college named Ford. \"Poor Markko,\" Matthew exclaimed. He couldn't believe that Langston would do such a thing.\n\n\nAs Markko sat nearby drinking a bottle of water that he had obtained from Langston's purse, Langston's phone flashed on and off that she had a message from Ford. Markko had pulled the phone from the purse and set it down as he rummaged for the water. He informed Langston of the text and asked her who it was from. Langston looked at the message quickly and informed Markko that it was a girl from one of her classes.\n\n\nDestiny admitted to Matthew that it was difficult for her to play the role of Langston when everything was a lie. Langston overheard part of the conversation and wanted to know what Destiny was talking about. Destiny and Matthew stuttered like crazy as they tried to make up a reason for their conversation. Destiny claimed that the whole scene didn't feel real and felt like a lie. Matthew tried to clarify that because he and Destiny weren't a real couple, they couldn't relate to the words. Langston snapped at the pair, \"That's why they call it acting.\" She stalked off. Markko suddenly noticed that the video camera was still running and jumped up to turn it off. He grabbed the camera and began to watch what had been recorded.\n\n\nNate praised Dani for her acting skills, though they both realized that after Dani had spotted Todd, she hadn't been acting at all. Dani thought that T\u00e9a would be happy to hear that after the scene they had been rehearsing hit home, Dani might give Todd a chance.\n\n\nDown the hall, Todd continued to swear to Starr that he did not push Marty, and he needed to know that Starr was on his side. \"Why do you do this to me, Dad?\" Starr asked. She confessed that she wanted to believe him, but it would mean that she was hurting Cole. She reminded her dad that the issue involved Cole and his mother, but Todd was livid and yelled that he didn't care what Cole thought, only Starr. She asked him to swear again and he did. \"I swear I didn't do it,\" he said solemnly. Starr told him she believed him.\n\n\nA relieved Todd hugged his daughter. \"Don't make me regret it,\" Starr threatened him. Just then, Dani approached them, and Todd complimented her on the scene he had watched her rehearse briefly. Dani assured him she still had plenty to do and it was amazing to be able to play her sister in the show. She offered to drop out of the show, though, if Todd didn't approve of it. Todd didn't want Dani to quit and allowed that sometimes the truth hurt. He acknowledged that he had heard it all before anyway.\n\n\nDani invited Todd to watch the rest of the rehearsal. They walked over to the gym, but Mr. G had called rehearsal for the day. Dani shrugged and invited her dad to stay and talk for a while instead. Starr couldn't hide her grin.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Blair couldn't believe that Todd might have been the one to push Marty down the stairs. T\u00e9a wanted Blair to convince her that Todd couldn't have been the one, but T\u00e9a had bumped into Todd in the hospital and the timing was suspect. He had denied pushing Marty, but T\u00e9a didn't know if he was lying about it. Blair admitted that Todd was capable of doing horrible things and lying about them. Personally, she was sick of trying to figure out what the mood of the day was when it concerned Todd, Blair told T\u00e9a. She was relieved that she didn't have to deal with it anymore because her new man was able to \"say it like it is.\" No more Todd drama, Blair concluded.\n\n\nT\u00e9a pointed out that they weren't the only ones involved and it wasn't that easy. She noted that Todd's actions could affect their children also. Blair moaned and admitted that T\u00e9a was right, and if Todd had pushed Marty it would be a terrible blow to all of the kids. T\u00e9a thought they should lay the foundation to soften the blow in the event that it was true. The women decided to head over to the high school to meet the girls after rehearsal.\n\n\nHannah was almost crazed as she told Cole that she saw who pushed Marty down the stairs. She admitted that she was scared to tell him sooner because she was afraid the person would try to harm her too. Cole promised to protect her.\n\n\nMarty sat in her bed at the hospital and debated with herself over whether Todd could have been the one to push her down the stairs. Nora peeked in on Marty and expressed her sadness over the loss of Marty's baby. She was confused when Marty mentioned an ongoing investigation until Marty revealed, \"Someone pushed me.\" Marty confessed that she thought the suspect had been Natalie but then she thought it was someone else. She told Nora of the huge fight she had with Todd prior to her fall.\n\n\nNora thought that Todd belonged at the top of Marty's suspect list, and she would \"nail his butt to the wall\" if he had committed the assault. Marty felt relieved that she had managed to talk to someone about the attack, and Nora assured her that she would always be available to Marty. Suddenly, Marty spied Nora's engagement ring and she showed her delight. Nora was in awe that Marty was happy for Nora after all that Marty had been through, but Marty was glad to have something else to think about.\n\n\nNora disclosed that her wedding date was June 1, and she wasn't thrilled that Bo wanted a large wedding. Marty assured her that she would be there. Nora pointed to her heart and told Marty that Marty had a lot of healing to do there. Nora promised to make someone pay for the evil deed.\n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Rex visited with Bo, who revealed that he was getting married to the woman of his dreams. Rex was happy for Bo and thought that Bo deserved it. Bo thought that Rex deserved to be happy, too, but Rex was annoyed that the subject had been changed. Bo joked that he had been wounded and Rex should \"cut me some slack.\" Rex showed him the broken heart necklace that had been found in his blanket when he was taken to the hospital as a baby. Bo suggested that Rex drop it off at the police station and Bo would have it checked out. He didn't want Rex to have a broken heart, and he wasn't just talking about the necklace.\n\n\nSarcastically, Rex asked if everyone should pair off like on Noah's Ark just because Bo was engaged to be married. \"Tough guy,\" Bo teased. He asked if it were true that Rex didn't need anyone. Rex assured him that he didn't have a broken heart and that he and Gigi had gone through a lot to be together, but there had been one too many bumps in the road. Bo pondered the fact that Rex loved Gigi but wasn't with her and thought there was something broken about it. Rex pointed out that he and Gigi shared a son and that was the end of it. He had trusted her, but once the trust was broken, everything fell apart. He wasn't willing to risk it again. Bo called him a jackass and disclosed that he was certainly not a stranger to issues involving trust either.\n\n\nBo spoke about his falling out with Nora in the past, when she had cheated on him because she loved him. He hadn't been able to see that then but had realized that if a person really loved someone, they could forgive them for anything, he advised. He had been a jackass, too, and had listened to his pride and not his heart. He had paid for it by not being with Nora for years and, though he was still scared of getting hurt again, he wouldn't stop living. Bo thought that a life without Nora would be the same as no life.\n\n\nBo apologized for telling Rex what to do, but he didn't want Rex to waste years of his life. He thought that if there were still a chance with Gigi, then Rex should go for it. Bo accused Rex of thinking too much, and Rex agreed that he still loved Gigi.\n\n\nNora encountered Bo as he walked down the hallway, and she made the correct assumption that he was on the way to the vending machine to buy a bag of chips. She advised him that she would not allow him to have junk food because she needed him to promise he'd be around for a long time. She thought she was lucky to be so happy, especially after seeing Marty, who was both brave but devastated. Bo vowed they would find the person who pushed Marty, and Nora agreed they were a good team. She planned to put the responsible person away.\n\n\nGigi and Viki chatted and puttered around the kitchen as they tended to Viki's plants. Rex arrived. He had been looking for Gigi and thought she might be there. He asked if she wanted to attend a sporting event with him and Shane. Rex welcomed Viki home, and Viki noted that it was the \"best feeling to know where you belong.\"\n\n\nAs everyone stood or sat around the gymnasium after rehearsal, the calm was broken when Cole burst through the doors loudly. He screamed out that Todd was a murderer and headed to the man. Starr managed to get in between them, and she tried her best to push Cole away. Cole bellowed that Todd had pushed Marty and killed her baby. Commotion ensued as Starr shouted that Todd had sworn that he didn't push Marty. Cole was astonished that Starr had believed her father, and he assured her she'd be disappointed. He announced that he had a witness.\n\n\nStarr put her arms around a distressed Dani, and Todd sneered that Cole's friend was a liar. Todd turned to leave, but Cole went after him and knocked him to the floor just as Blair and T\u00e9a arrived. As Todd remained on the ground, an out-of-control Cole began to beat him severely. Markko did his best to pull Cole off of Todd, and Starr pleaded with Cole to stop. Everyone stood around aghast at what was happening.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hannah knows how to get Cole to believe that she is telling the truth about who she saw push his mother down the flight of hair and cause her to lose her baby. Right then, Dani is beginning to consider bonding with Todd and invites him to join her and Starr and the others at the auditorium to talk. But before they can do that, Cole comes after Todd and is ready to kill him believing his \"friend\" is a credible witness that Todd killed his mother's baby. Meanwhile, Destiny reveals to Matthew that she has a problem playing Langston knowing that she's cheating on Markko and lying about it. Gigi talks to Viki and Rex talks to Bo about their uncertainly. They both get pep talks about Viki and Charlie getting past their issues and getting back and the same for Bo and Nora.",
