Starr thought Cole's plan was crazy and told him that two teens would never survive on the run with a baby. Unwilling to accept no for an answer, Cole explained that he would get a job and they would eventually marry. Surprised by Cole's revelation of marriage, Starr was still hesitant and fearful that Todd would find Cole and kill him. Starr reminded Cole about the events that transpired when they tried to run away before. Starr expressed her concern about being on the run and pregnant. She also feared leaving her family and life behind. As Cole attempted to persuade Starr to reconsider, Markko interrupted and told Cole that his coach needed to see Cole right away. Fearing the coach would call Nora if he failed to show up, Cole begged Starr to wait for him and ran off to meet with the coach. Markko told Starr that Cole was taking care of everything, but Starr exclaimed, \"I can't do it!\" and ran off. \n\n\nA series of events unfolded at Buchanan Enterprises. As Rex told Gigi of Jared's intentions towards her, he attempted to kiss her. An infuriated Gigi slapped Rex. Shocked by Gigi's reaction, Rex explained that he didn't intend to kiss her, but was only demonstrating Jared's actions. Unconvinced, Gigi reminded Rex that he was getting married in a few weeks and suggested that perhaps she should be wary of him instead of Jared. Meanwhile, down the hall, Viki and Charlie bumped into Marcie and Shane. Feeling proud of his comic, Shane showed Viki and Charlie his new villainess, Evelyn Evil. Stunned that the character shared an exact likeness to Adriana, Viki and Charlie suggested that Shane didn't show the comic to Rex. Shane didn't understand their apprehension and stated that Evelyn Evil was Rex's idea. He insisted that the character wasn't intended to look like Adriana; it just turned out that way. Marcie and Shane headed off to find Gigi, and Viki attempted to locate Natalie. In Natalie's office, Natalie and Jared were involved in a passionate kiss. As Viki approached the door, Jared tore off his shirt and Natalie began unbuttoning her blouse. \n\n\nBefore Rex and Gigi's argument could escalate any further, Shane and Marcie interrupted them. While Marcie and Gigi watched nervously, Shane presented his comic to Rex. Although he hesitated upon seeing the character, Rex didn't appear bothered by the fact that the villainess resembled Adriana. When Rex suggested that he and Shane make copies of the comic, Marcie and Gigi were left alone in the boardroom. Realizing that there was some tension between Gigi and Rex, Marcie wondered what was bothering Gigi. After Gigi confessed to a surprised Marcie that Rex almost kissed her, Marcie questioned Gigi about her feelings concerning Rex. Gigi admitted to caring about Rex, but told Marcie she needed to get over those feelings because Rex was marrying Adriana. Marcie believed that Rex had some unresolved issues concerning Gigi. When Gigi asked Marcie if she felt Rex was having second thoughts about marrying Adriana, Marcie suggested that Gigi speak with Rex about their relationship. \n\n\nWhile Rex and Shane made copies in the copy room, Shane told Rex that he didn't know much about his father because Gigi didn't like to talk about him very much. As Marcie encouraged Gigi to discuss the kiss with Rex, Rex entered the office without Shane. When Rex stated that Shane was in another room, Marcie excused herself to go and get the little boy. Alone with Gigi, Rex suggested that they talk about Shane's father. Rex wanted to know why Gigi panicked every time he mentioned Shane's father. Rex told Gigi that her inability to discuss Shane's father was affecting the child. Rex revealed that Shane told him that it bothered him that Gigi never talked about his dad. Gigi remarked that Shane's father was the most amazing man that she had ever met. In tears, Gigi told Rex that she didn't like to talk about Shane's father because it hurt too much. \n\n\nAs Natalie and Jared straightened their rumpled clothing, Viki knocked on the door and asked Natalie if she were all right. Charlie's meeting had been delayed and he joined Viki at Natalie's office door. Terrified, Natalie wouldn't respond, and Viki continued to knock and call out to her. After regaining their composure, Natalie pretended to be working and Jared opened the door. Upon witnessing Jared in a locked room with Natalie, a look of shock and suspicion crossed the faces of both Viki and Charlie. Jared made up an excuse about being on a conference call. While Jared and Natalie spoke in cryptic code about their encounter. Viki and Charlie didn't appear convinced. When Jared left the office, Charlie nervously excused himself and tracked down Jared. Charlie tried to convince Jared to end his pursuit of Natalie, but Jared refused. Charlie believed Jared's secret would be exposed if Jared continued to make advances towards Natalie. When Charlie told Jared that he could never have a life with Natalie, Jared stated that he no longer believed that. Charlie was appalled when Jared suggested that Natalie felt the same way. Alone with Natalie, Viki demanded to know what had taken place between Natalie and Jared. When Viki began questioning Natalie about Jared, Natalie said that Jared was an asset to B.E., but admitted that she often had difficulty working with him. The conversation soon turned to Calvin Jenkins' hostile takeover of B.E. and the effect it was having on Clint. Realizing Viki was friends with Jenkins, Natalie urged her mother to contact him and come up with a solution to save B.E. from the takeover. Although she was still worried about Natalie, Viki agreed to contact Jenkins and left to meet up with Charlie. When Viki left, Natalie had a flashback of her intimate encounter with Jared. A look of horror crossed Natalie's face and she exclaimed, \"Oh my God, what am I doing?\" \n\n\nExcited to resume their intimate moment, Jared entered Natalie's office and suggested they have a little fun. Natalie explained that she had a lapse in judgment, but realized that she could never make that mistake again. As she prepared to leave the office, Jared told her to sleep well, if she could. \n\n\nAt a Michigan bar, Dorian and Layla were shocked when Brody kissed a surprised Adriana. As Dorian punched Brody and demanded that he unhand Adriana, Brody realized he had mistaken Adriana for Gigi. While Dorian was angered by Brody's actions, Adriana forgave his mistake and attempted to convince Brody to go to Llanview. Brody refused to come to Llanview and told Adriana that Gigi and Shane were probably better off without him. Refusing to leave town without Brody, Adriana presented him with Shane's comic and stated how much the little boy admired the father he had only heard about. After viewing Shane's comic, Brody became emotional and stated he wasn't a hero. Adriana told Brody that Gigi hadn't been with another man since Brody and mentioned how Gigi was struggling as a single mother. When Brody asked how he would explain appearing in Llanview all of a sudden, Adriana revealed her plan. Adriana told Brody that Gigi and Shane were involved in an incident several months earlier in Texas and their names had been circulated in the media. She suggested that Brody could have easily located them through media reports. Adriana warned Brody that Gigi thought he was dead. After confirming that Gigi was still attractive and learning that Dorian would finance his trip to Llanview and beyond, Brody agreed to go to Llanview with Adriana, Dorian, and Layla. After Brody left to prepare for his trip to Llanview, Dorian remarked that Brody was a shifty character. Adriana told Dorian not to worry because she intended to clean him up and make him look like the hero Shane believed him to be. When Adriana received a call from Rex, she told him that she had to leave town to help Layla with their important business deal. Giving Brody a scheming glance, Adriana stated that she would be home in a few hours because the deal had been signed, sealed, and was soon to be delivered. \n\n\nAs Viki entered the coffee shop, she placed a call to Calvin Jenkins and made plans to meet with him. Upon noticing Starr, Viki approached her and soon realized her niece was distressed. Starr explained how she was suffering under Todd's strict rules and expressed her need to see Cole. When Starr mentioned that Todd ordered her to stay away from Cole for six months and that she didn't have six months to wait, Viki became suspicious. Starr covered her tracks and made up an excuse. Viki assured Starr that if her relationship with Cole were really meant to be, they would reunite one day. When Viki told Starr to lean on her family because nothing was more important than family, Starr suddenly cheered up and told Viki that she had helped her a lot. After saying goodbye to her aunt, Starr ran off to meet Cole back at the high school. Later, Charlie met Viki at the coffee shop. Charlie grew nervous when Viki told him that she knew what had taken place earlier between Natalie and Jared. Viki said that Natalie was uncomfortable working with Jared, and believed Natalie should stop working at B.E. \n\n\nStarr returned to the school and told Cole that she wanted to run off with him and start their family. Starr said that she realized that Cole was her family. When Starr asked how long it would take for Cole to get everything organized, Cole told her that they needed to leave that night before anyone became suspicious of their plans.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cole is ready to run away with Starr together. He has fake IDs and everything they need. But she has her doubts that their plan will work. She doesn't want to leave everything behind. Natalie and Jared, once again go around the \"possibilities\" that they could have together. Both Viki and Charlie can sense that there is something going on between the two of them. Rex is still interested in Gigi's personal life and specifically about Shane's real father. Adriana meets with Dorian and Layla in the country bar in Michigan where they've found the living Brody Lovett. They attempt to encourage him to go to Llanview and reunite with Gigi and Shane. At first he doesn't want to and questions why they want him to. But when they offer to pay his travel expenses, he considers it.",
