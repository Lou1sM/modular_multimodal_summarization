Ramsey called Antonio in to his office and explained that he would be accompanying Antonio on the evening's undercover drug bust. Antonio was surprised but grateful that he would not be partnered up with McBain and his ex. Carlotta and Jamie arrived in the main office, and Jamie rushed over to embrace Talia, leading to an awkward moment between John, Talia, and Antonio. Carlotta pulled Jamie away from Talia, pointedly commenting that she was very busy was Detective McBain, and Talia withered under Carlotta's scorn. Antonio reassured his mother that he could take Jamie to her checkup the next day, but didn't mention her dire condition to Carlotta, a fact not lost on Ramsey. Ramsey was pleased to see Jamie and seemed to soften up around the little girl, kneeling down to her level and doing magic tricks for her, and giving her change for the candy machine. John and Talia watched the new commissioner's display of affection, silent and disgusted. After Carlotta and Jamie said their goodbyes for the evening, Antonio and Ramsey headed out for their undercover operation, leaving McBain and Sahid to sulk. When their colleague, Eddie, chimed in with another taunt about John and Talia's new relationship, John lost it, yelling at him to \"back the hell off!\" Later, they stewed about Ramsey's kindness to the Vega family. Talia mused that Ramsey seemed \"almost human,\" but John was convinced it was all an act, a ploy to make Antonio into Ramsey's lapdog. Having overheard their latest remarks, Eddie harangued his colleagues about their insults towards Antonio and Ramsey, and challenged them, saying that Ramsey was not nearly as bad as they said and that the police force could do far worse. \n\n\nDown on the docks, Cole and Markko met up, and Markko handed Cole his and Starr's fake IDs. Cole thanked him for all his help, but feared Todd's wrath falling upon his friends. Markko told Cole not to worry, but jokingly urged Cole not to name him as the baby's godfather. The two boys admitted they would miss each other. \n\n\nAt the Hallowed Grounds coffee shop, Viki met with Calvin Jenkins, while Langston crept in, awaiting the arrival of Markko and Cole. Viki reminded Calvin of their long friendship, and pressed him about the motivations behind his takeover attempt against Buchanan Enterprises. Calvin was pleasant but evasive, fearing that his business dealings would end up splashed across the front page of the Banner. Viki brought up Todd's article in The Sun about Clint's business tactics, and assured Calvin that Clint meant business. Viki said she knew Calvin wasn't like Virgil Webster or Warren Cobb, that he was a decent man, and she pleaded with him to tell her why he was after BE. Seeing that Calvin was pained and grappling with his choice, Viki ushered him out of the coffee shop so they could talk more \"privately.\" \n\n\nMarkko and Cole arrived in Hallowed Grounds to meet with Langston, and Cole gave Langston a parcel-a letter for Starr, and her new fake ID. Cole refused to let Langston open the package, and asked her not to get involved. When Langston protested, Markko reminded her that their not knowing what Starr and Cole had planned was necessary, \"so that when people ask us questions, we have no answers.\" Langston finally agreed, and Cole thanked her. He said that Langston had \"[gotten] me when no one else did\" after his mother's death, and said he would never forget what she did for him. After Cole embraced her and left, an uneasy Langston asked Markko, \"Why did that feel like 'goodbye forever?'\" \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Bo and Clint clashed about what to do about the Calvin Jenkins takeover bid. Bo wanted to appeal to Calvin again while Clint was determined to break out the big guns. The brothers clammed up when Nora entered.  She cannily deduced that they were discussing Buchanan Enterprises' business strategy, questionable legality and all. Clint insisted that nothing he had planned was illegal, and Nora reminded them that Calvin's record was clean. \"There's always dirt,\" Clint proclaimed triumphantly. The trio continued to wonder about Calvin's mystery backer, but were interrupted by a call from Calvin himself. He was headed over to the mansion to confront Bo and Clint, while Nora left the men alone for the showdown. \n\n\nIn the foyer, Cole snuck in and then out, only to be stopped by Nora at the door. Cole lied to Nora, claiming he was meeting some friends, and promised not to be out late. Nora fretted about her guardianship of the boy, worrying that she wasn't spending enough time with him, but Cole said she'd been wonderful. Nora admitted that Cole reminded her very much of Marty and her friendship. \"Thank you for everything,\" Cole told her, and gave Nora a hug, then bid her goodbye, rushing out into the night. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, Bo tried to draw Calvin into reminiscences of old times with Asa, but Clint was in no mood for pleasantries, cursing at Calvin and warning him not to go through with his attack. The Buchanans were disarmed and shocked when Calvin revealed that he'd in fact changed his mind, and would not be making an attempt on BE. Calvin refused to elaborate on his reasons for the change of heart, and said his goodbyes, leaving the brothers mystified as to why he'd backed off. When Nora returned, she was pleased to hear the news. After Bo left to help Matthew with his homework, Clint and Nora shared a private moment together. Clint admitted to Nora that he was relieved and didn't much like playing \"hardball,\" and they kissed after Nora remarked that she knew him better than she'd previously thought. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr nervously packed her things to run away with Cole, gazing at his picture and clutching a pregnancy \"how-to\" book. She wondered aloud which parent their child would come out looking like. When the rest of the Manning family entered, Starr hid her bags under the bed. Starr's family urged its fourth member to come down to the living room for \"poker night\" with pizza, and despite her protests of homework, Starr finally relented and joined them downstairs, taking time to hide her book under her bed as well. As \"game night\" got underway, Starr found herself enjoying the family togetherness, trying to teach the oblivious Baby Sam the fundamentals of poker. While Todd took picture after picture for posterity on his camera, Starr's newfound maternal instinct kicked in as she chided Jack for trying to feed their baby brother soda. Todd was thrilled to see his family happy and resolved to make \"poker night\" a weekly event, but Starr suffered in silence, her doubts about leaving her family weighing heavily on her heart. When Langston returned home for the evening, she and Starr made tracks for Starr's bedroom. Before Starr left her family for the night, she hugged a surprised Todd and Blair, and told them, \"I love you. I love you all.\" \n\n\nOn the docks, Ramsey and Antonio awaited their perpetrator, and Ramsey broached the subject of Jamie's illness. He offered Antonio flexible work hours or financial assistance, but Antonio refused any special treatment and swore he would do whatever it took to hold onto Jamie, after losing both his fortune and Talia. When the drug dealer arrived on the scene, Ramsey and Antonio went through with the buy, then drew guns on the dealer and arrested him, calling in a backup unit. The dealer called Ramsey a \"bastard\" and swore he'd get him, and Ramsey pulled his pistol and shoved it in the perp's face, saying he wouldn't let him \"screw this up for me.\" Antonio got Ramsey to back off, and the backup officers hauled the dealer away. Ramsey regained his cool and stormed off, telling Antonio to grab the evidence and the prop money and take them back to the lock-up. Suddenly, Antonio found himself left all alone with a knapsack full of money, seemingly pondering his options. \n\n\nIn Starr's bedroom at La Boulaie, Langston handed Starr the package from Cole. Starr read Cole's letter detailing their escape plan, and as she hustled around to finish her packing, Langston finally deduced that Starr and Cole were running away together to have the baby. Starr admitted that she'd had second thoughts after sitting down for dinner with her family, and that she'd remembered her love for her father. She reminded Langston that Todd would still be dangerous if he learned the truth, and worried that Langston and Markko would also be in jeopardy by association. Langston told Starr not to worry about them, and embraced her. A tearful Starr asked Langston to \"say goodbye to them for me.\" \n\n\nDownstairs, Viki arrived to return Starr's scarf from where she'd left it at Hallowed Grounds, and greeted the joyful Mannings. As Todd reveled in his genuinely happy family, Viki held her tongue, remembering her conversation with Starr. While Todd and Blair carried Jack and Sam off to bed, they told Viki to head into the kitchen to check out Jack's sparkling report card, and the foyer was left empty. \n\n\nWhen the coast was clear, Starr snuck down the stairs, preparing to make her getaway. She dashed out onto the lawn from the living room, seeing Cole's laser pointer signal on the walls. Before she could go to Cole, however, Viki returned to the living room and called out to her. \n\n\n",

She sees that they love her and she has her doubts. Cole says good bye to all his friends without actually telling them what he is doing. At B.E., they are all wondering what to do in regard to Calvin. Viki talks to Calvin. He announces to Bo and Clint that he does not plan to take them down after all. Clint admits he did not really want to play hard ball after all. Nora and Bo are relieved. Ramsey is up to his dirty tricks. He wants to make nice to Antonio and pit him against John and Talia.",
