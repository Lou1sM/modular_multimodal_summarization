Bo wasn't surprised by the news. Bo was certain that John had left clues to let Bo know that the killer was after Marty. Bo questioned Fish about what John had been working on before the arrest \n\n\nFish was reluctant to confide the details to Bo. Bo revealed that John had shared his theory about the serial killer. Fish relaxed as Bo assured him that he was determined to find evidence to exonerate John of the crimes he had been accused of. \n\n\nAt a motel in Rochester, New York, Marty stepped out of the bathroom. John stood by a window, scanning the parking lot. Marty admitted that John's behavior made her nervous. John assured Marty that he was merely being cautious. \n\n\nJohn explained that the police probably suspected that John would try to flee into Canada. He was positive that the police were watching the nearby Canadian border. However, John was equally certain that the killer was in Rochester. John believed that the murders were connected to the rape. Talia just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\n\nJohn showed Marty a picture of Powell Lord. John explained that Powell had been institutionalized in a facility in Rochester. John intended to question Powell. Marty insisted on accompanying John. Marty snatched John's car keys before he could stop her. She refused to return the keys until John agreed to her demands. \n\n\nA short time later, John and Marty arrived at the institution where Powell was a patient. They spoke to Ellen Kwan, the person in charge of family relations at the facility. John and Marty claimed to be Powell's cousins. When Ellen asked for identification, John supplied her with an ID, which identified him as a Buchanan. As Ellen left the office, to confirm the ID, her computer screen updated. The Intruder's headline proclaimed John and Marty as fugitives on the run. \n\n\nJack went to Starr's bedroom, looking for his MP3 player. Starr refused to let Jack into her room. She insisted that she didn't have his MP3 player. She shooed her brother away before he realized Cole was hiding inside Starr's room. \n\n\nInside Starr's room, Cole was suffering from the early stages of drug withdrawal. He tried to pull himself together when Rachel called. Rachel confessed that she thought Cole sounded awful. However, she was more curious about where Cole was. Rachel knew he had not spent the night at the treatment center because his bed had not been slept it. Cole let Rachel believe that he was at Marty's apartment. \n\n\nRachel reminded Cole that he had a supervised drug test scheduled for later that day. \n\n\nCole went into a panic after he ended the call with Rachel. Cole didn't think he would be able to fool anyone, especially Rachel, in his condition. Starr reminded Cole that they had time before he was due to take the drug test. Starr was confident that they had enough time to get Cole through the worst of his withdrawal, so that he could hide the true state of his condition. \n\n\nCole pleaded with Starr to go to Marty's apartment. Cole had a stash of drugs hidden there. Cole was certain that he just needed a pill to take the edge off, which would help him hide that he was going through drug withdrawal. Starr refused to give in to Cole's demands. \n\n\nCole's symptoms worsened as time passed. He broke out in a sweat, and then began hallucinating. Starr did all she could to help Cole through the crisis. Eventually, she managed to calm Cole down. She told him the story of their romance as a romantic fairytale. At the end of the story, Starr promised Cole that she would not let anything bad happen to him. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora overheard Rachel on the phone with Cole. Nora was disappointed that Rachel continued to cover for Cole. Rachel refused to confirm or deny the accusation. She reminded her mother that Cole was a kid in trouble who needed her help. Rachel refused to turn her back on Cole. \n\n\nAs Nora and Rachel's argument about Cole escalated, Clint and Matthew entered the foyer. Clint suggested that Nora and Rachel find a private setting for their argument. Rachel insisted on telling Matthew the truth. She explained that Nora was upset because Rachel was Cole's drug counselor. Matthew surprised Nora by supporting Rachel. Matthew thought Rachel would be able to provide Cole with the help that he needed. \n\n\nBo arrived shortly before Matthew received a package from his brother, David. Matthew opened the package. It was a lifetime supply of Have-A-Seat hemorrhoid treatment, which David had been hired to endorse. Matthew realized that David gave him the gift because Matthew sat all day. Everyone enjoyed a chuckle, including Matthew, at David's choice of gift. \n\n\nAs Matthew prepared to go to school for the first time since his accident, Nora hovered. Matthew was determined to be independent. As Nora and Bo watched Matthew head to the school van, sent to pick him up, Nora admitted that no one understood how she felt. Bo reminded her that she was not alone. Clint stood nearby, listening to Bo and Nora's exchange. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian was frustrated when she was unable to reach T\u00e9a on the phone. Dorian was worried because the custody hearing was scheduled for later that morning. \n\n\nJack walked into the living room. Dorian wanted to know why Jack wasn't in school. He reminded his aunt that she had given him a written excuse, so that they could work on a school project. Dorian offered to get someone else to help Jack with his diorama. Jack assumed Dorian meant Addie; he pointed out that Addie liked to put glitter on everything. Dorian turned to Ray for assistance. Ray revealed that he was quite knowledgeable about Native American history; he offered to help Jack. \n\n\nLater, as Ray and Jack finished the diorama, Jack decided to add more blood to the depiction of Custer's Last Stand. Ray asked Jack why he had picked that particular moment in history. As Jack spoke, Ray realized that Jack equated the violence of the event to his father. According to Jack, Todd made people pay for the wrongs done to him. \n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, T\u00e9a woke up to her alarm clock's loud buzzing. Todd was in bed with her. Todd kept T\u00e9a from getting out of bed, and ready for court, by making love to her. Each time T\u00e9a tried to get ready, Todd would initiate lovemaking. \n\n\nA knock at the door, followed by Dorian's demands for T\u00e9a to open the door, finally forced Todd to let go of T\u00e9a. Dorian tried to enter the room when T\u00e9a opened the door, but T\u00e9a blocked her. When Dorian spotted signs of an intimate breakfast for two, Dorian assumed T\u00e9a's lover was R.J. T\u00e9a didn't correct Dorian's mistake. She convinced Dorian that she was ready to face Todd in court. Satisfied, Dorian left. \n\n\nAt court, T\u00e9a received her first surprise when she learned that the previous judge had stepped down from the case and a new judge had been appointed. The hearing did not go well. Todd insisted that he deserved custody of the children because their stepfather had been arrested as a suspected serial killer. T\u00e9a pointed out that Todd had gone for an extended period of time without contacting his children, had been involved in an auto accident with a child not properly placed in a car seat, and had pushed his pregnant daughter down a set of stairs. \n\n\nThe judge was not impressed with T\u00e9a's arguments. The judge pointed out that, despite Addie and Dorian's willingness to care for the children while Blair recuperated, neither was fit to be a proper guardian. The judge granted custody of the children to Todd. \n\n\nDorian returned to La Boulaie. Ray had Sam on his lap while he read the young boy a story. Jack was nearby, secretly exchanging text messages with Todd. Dorian admitted that a part of her had the urge to pack the children up and flee town. Ray tried to offer words of encouragement. He had faith that T\u00e9a would prevail in court. \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a arrived at La Boulaie, Todd was close on her heels. Before T\u00e9a could break the news to Dorian, Todd announced that he had been granted custody of the children. Starr, returning from the kitchen, overheard her father. When she walked into the room, Todd instructed Starr to pack her things. Starr looked to Dorian for help.\n\n\n",
