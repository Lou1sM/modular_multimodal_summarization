When Miles opened the door to his suite, it was clear that he'd been drinking as he wrapped Jessica up in a big, long hug. She saw the trashed room and immediately asked if he'd been robbed; he thought back to his earlier outburst. Evangeline asked Talia for an update on the arson case. Vincent found Natalie crying on the pier. John and Marty drove off in search of Starr and Cole before Todd could get to them, unaware that Todd was strangling Cole at that very moment. \n\n\nNatalie admitted to Vincent that she was beginning to trust him, despite his \"gangsta-cool\" fa\u00e7ade. As he pried into what was bothering her, she held her gaze elsewhere until she finally cried out that it was over between her and John, recalling the disappointing moment when John admitted the truth to her about his intentions. Vincent asked what kind of game John was playing and said he would never do something like that to a woman. She revealed that she dropped the bomb about Starr and Cole to Todd so that he'd go nuts and upset Marty, who had just taken John away from her in a crucial moment. She assured Vincent that she was fine so that he would leave her alone. \n\n\nA lot of screaming ensued as Marty caught Todd strangling her son and John pulled Todd off of Cole, who looked understandably shaken. A security guard showed up and John tried to quiet down the warring families. Todd admitted to planning a GPS tracking device in Starr's purse, to her great disbelief, and told Starr that she was grounded until her teeth fall out. \n\n\nEvangeline pushed Talia for details on the case, saying it had become personal for Nora. Talia snapped back that she'd been attacked twice by the perp, so it's personal for her, too. Vange asked to see the sketch and was stunned that it was a familiar symbol. She recalled seeing it when she was growing up; a white supremacist group had painted it on her family's house to scare them out of the neighborhood. Vange suggested they involve the feds. Talia took off for Antonio's. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Antonio and Nash sat down for a beer and discussed Antonio's job, the arsonist, anything but the obvious. Nash pointed out that the arsonist's targets were random, but Antonio argued that they weren't and the cops are getting closer to finding out why. Antonio changed the topic and told Nash that Jess was thinking about adopting Jamie. Nash sarcastically commented that they would be one big, happy family. Talia interrupted at just the right time.\n\n\nMiles confessed to Jessica that he trashed his own room because he was angry and that he'd had a really rough night, starting at with the Palace robbery. He recounted telling Marty that he was attracted to her and planting a kiss on her only to receive a slap in the face. Jessica advised him on the importance of a woman's consent. What she was getting at was that Marty has a painful past, so she asked him to make a strong pot of coffee and clear his head to hear the story. Jessica stunned Miles with the truth that Marty was gang-raped in college. When he said he hoped the rapists would rot in prison, Jess revealed that they had all done their time and that one had even turned his life around: Todd Manning. Miles was upset, but became calm. As Jessica left, Miles told her she was a wonderful niece and asked her permission to kiss her on the cheek. \n\n\nA bellhop delivered a letter to Miles. When he left, Miles was chilled to see the sender's name: Spencer Truman. He began to read the letter, which said that Spencer had something of utmost importance to confide in Miles. Talia informed Antonio of the supremacist group's motto: Unus Putus Populus, or \"One Pure People.\" When Talia said she didn't see Nora's connection to the arson targets, Antonio informed her that Nora's Jewish, and they concluded that it is a group of white supremacists causing the fires. John dragged the Manning/Thornhart gang back to the station and chaos broke out as soon as he left the room. Starr made a deal with her dad: She'd break up with Cole if Todd left him alone. Meanwhile, Natalie sobbed on the pier and came face to face with John. \n\n\n\n\n",
