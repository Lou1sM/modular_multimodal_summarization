Michael refused to discuss it. He reminded Talia that, as Jamie's physician, he was ethically bound to respect his patient's privacy. He suggested that Talia talk to Antonio if she had questions about Jamie's health. John respected his brother's position and pulled him aside to have a private word with him about Marcie. John told Michael that he was concerned after a recent talk with Marcie. He sensed that things were off between the couple and asked if Michael's extra shifts at the hospital were his brother's way of dealing with his marital problems. Michael admitted that things weren't perfect but insisted that he loved his wife and they were working everything out. \n\n\nAs Ramsey lurked nearby, Antonio played right into his hands and took some money from the drug bust that they had just completed. Once Antonio had the money safely tucked away, Ramsey made his presence known. Pretending to be oblivious to the theft, Ramsey updated Antonio on the suspect's transfer to the police station and then showered Antonio with praise about his performance during the bust. He then cleverly switched the subject to Jamie, admitting that he had overheard Michael discussing the medical cost of Jamie's treatment. Feigning friendly concern, he also urged Antonio to tell his family about Jamie's condition. Antonio refused to consider the idea. He felt that it would be best for everyone to wait until he had everything under control. Shortly afterwards, they returned to the police station. Antonio went into his office and pulled out the stolen money. As he was holding it, John knocked on the door and entered. Antonio was startled and dropped the money but John didn't notice. While Antonio carefully maneuvered the money out of sight with his foot, John tried to talk to him about Talia. Antonio wasn't interested in what John had to say and ordered John out of his office. Once John was gone, Antonio quickly gathered up the money. As he locked it away, Ramsey buzzed him on the intercom. He said that he wanted to see Antonio about the money. When Antonio joined Ramsey in his office, Ramsey questioned him about the amount recovered. He claimed that it seemed strange that there was only $220,000.00. Ramsey said that he was used to seeing more even amounts of drug money. Antonio didn't flinch. He said that he hadn't counted the money at the scene and then signed off on the paperwork confirming the amount taken in. As Antonio left Ramsey's office, Talia tried once again to talk to Antonio about Jamie. Antonio didn't mince words. He made it painfully clear to Talia, and everyone else in the squad room, that he didn't want to see or talk to her ever again. \n\n\nEddie continued to verbally harass Talia at every opportunity, much to John's growing ire. \n\n\nWhile Jessica, Nash, Jamie, Sarah, and Cris were sharing a booth at the diner, Carlotta joined them. She thanked Jess for being a good friend to Cris after he was arrested. Jess was touched and expressed her desire to renew their friendship. Carlotta let Jess know that she was open to it as she took Jamie into the kitchen. Once the adults were alone, Nash looked over Cris's designs and was impressed with his work. Just then one of Nash's investors stepped into the diner, so Nash had to excuse himself. Cris also stepped away from the table, leaving the ladies chat. Sarah took the opportunity to ask Jess if she was bothered by her cousin's relationship with Cris. Jess insisted that she wasn't. Later, Jess joined Nash as he finished up his business meeting with the investor. She was somewhat concerned about the exact nature of the investor's involvement in the vineyard but Nash assured her that he had everything well in hand. \n\n\nLangston covered for Starr when Todd and Blair came looking for her. She told them that Starr had gone to the kitchen for a snack. Meanwhile, Starr was about to meet up with Cole on the back patio to run away with him when Viki spotted her. Starr was forced to turn around and join her aunt in the living room. Cole was worried by the delay and headed to the diner. Inside the living room, Viki questioned Starr about her odd behavior. Starr decided to be honest with Viki but only up to a point. She admitted that she had been trying to sneak out to see Cole. Viki continued talking to Starr but every time Starr seemed on the verge of opening up, Blair and Todd would walk into the room and Starr would clam up. As soon as Starr was able to, she took refuge in her room where Langston was hanging out. Langston was shocked to see Starr was still in the house. As Starr explained what had happened, Langston's cell phone began vibrating. It was Markko. He was with Cole at the diner. Langston immediately handed the phone to Starr while Markko handed his phone to Cole. Cole told Starr that they couldn't delay their plans by even one day. He had borrowed money from people and was worried that once they figured out what he had done, they'd realize he was intending to run away with Starr. Cole instructed Starr to sneak out through the kitchen and to meet him at the docks. While Starr was heading to the docks, Cole returned to the patio to retrieve the bags that Starr had dropped when Viki spotted her. Starr and Langston said their goodbyes before Starr once again tried to slip out of the house. This time she was successful. Cole was lucky too. He was nearly discovered by Todd but managed to get Starr's bags and dash away, unnoticed. When Langston heard Blair and Todd head to bed, she turned off Starr's bedroom light and stepped out into the hall. Before heading to her own bedroom, she told them that Starr had turned in for the night. Blair stuck her head into Starr's room and assumed that the carefully arranged blankets were her daughter. She softly closed the door and went to bed with Todd. \n\n\nAt the docks, Starr and Cole reaffirmed their love and commitment to each other and their baby before leaving Llanview. \n\n\n",
