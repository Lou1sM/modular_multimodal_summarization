    "soap_central": "\n Don't Leave Me This Way \n\n\nRejecting Todd's demands that she and her brothers accompany him to his house, Starr pleaded to be allowed to stay at La Boulaie. She pointed out that it was her home and she wasn't a child. She added that she had been sick and throwing up all morning. Todd firmly and rudely refused to heed her wishes, suggesting that he would call the police if Starr didn't listen to him. T\u00e9a offered to help her pack. \n\n\nUpstairs, a suffering Cole, thick in the throes of his withdrawal, prayed for Starr to hurry back to him. As the minutes ticked by, he panicked and kept reassuring himself that everything would be okay. \n\n\nDorian took up Starr's cause and accused Todd of being a miserable excuse for a human being. She pointed out that Starr's entire life was in that house, but her appeal fell on deaf ears. Todd yelled that Dorian should have found herself a better lawyer and he ordered Ray to shut up as Ray started to voice his own opinion. Starr stormed upstairs and slammed her bedroom door shut, then began pulling food and drinks out of her bag. She explained to a frightened Cole that she had to leave and he needed to eat, drink, and sleep. \n\n\nAs Cole begged her to stay, Starr informed him of Todd's threats to call the police and what a terrible chain reaction that would cause. She felt that Cole would be better off without any of that happening. As the couple spoke quietly, Todd made his way upstairs and, unable to open the locked door, threatened to kick it down. Starr quickly informed Todd that she was sick again and changing clothes. \n\n\nShe had an idea that she and Cole could escape through the window, but Cole was unable to stand. Downstairs, Dorian blamed the results of the custody case on T\u00e9a for not preparing properly. After Dorian's reprimand, T\u00e9a headed upstairs and found Todd shouting threats at Starr through the closed door. \n\n\nDaring him to act like a Neanderthal and force his way into his daughter's bedroom, T\u00e9a thought that would be the best way for Todd to quickly lose the custody he had just gained. As the pair flirted and challenged each other, Todd refused to play into T\u00e9a's hand, pointing out that she would go to the judge if he did. She couldn't help but notice how upset Starr was, T\u00e9a confessed, and perhaps Todd should think about his daughter for a change. Taking her advice, Todd sweetly knocked on the door and apologized to Starr for his behavior. \n\n\nOutside of school, Nora and Bo sat in the car, feeling the need to watch and wait during Matthew's first day back at school. Bo pacified a nervous Nora, assuring her that it wasn't his first stakeout and he felt confident that their son would be fine. He agreed to wait a few minutes longer. \n\n\nInside, Marcie welcomed Matthew back and thought they could watch out for each other, since she was newly returned to school, as well. All eyes were on the boy in the wheelchair as Matthew wheeled through the hallways to his first class. Destiny was happy to see him. Once inside the classroom, Marcie began to clear a path for Matthew and his wheelchair. \n\n\nMatthew assured Destiny that he was cool with Becca and Justin, though he didn't totally trust the boy. Destiny voiced her concerns that the pair was merely playing him, due in part to her threatening them for being liable for Matthew's condition. She thought they were afraid of the Buchanans and were really not his friends. An angry Matthew accused her of being jealous because they were cool and popular and she wasn't. He blamed her for making him hate nice people. \n\n\nOut in the hallway, Becca and Justin agreed that they were tired of being nice and no longer wanted to pretend. Justin disclosed that his dad had assured him that the Buchanans would not sue them. Once inside the classroom, Justin was full of insults and jokes directed at Matthew. \n\n\nAs the day wore on, Nora prayed that Matthew was doing okay. Bo decided to head for the corner hotdog stand to get some lunch for both of them. They complimented each other on their coping with their son's condition. Bo admitted to feeling better and more in control of all of the unknowns. He explained that at least they still had their son, as opposed to the alternative, which he had already been through, having lost Drew. Nora confessed that things sounded better when Bo said them, even though others had said the same thing. \n\n\nBo expressed how happy he was that Rachel was back in Llanview and how good she was for Matthew. Nora admitted that she and her daughter were at odds due to Rachel's counseling of Cole, but acknowledged that Matthew was fine with it. She was not forgiving like her son, she declared. Bo blamed Cole and wasn't sure how he would react upon seeing him. He did think that Nora was right in not pressing charges, because things would still be the same. \n\n\nBack inside the classroom, the students began to discuss \"Lord of the Flies\" and how cruel people were. Marcie finally had enough of Justin's verbal attacks on Matthew and ordered him to write a 3,000-word essay on tolerance, due the next day, in addition to the regular assignment. She also promised an F if things continued. Justin was bent on seeking revenge. \n\n\nLeft alone, Marcie apologized to Matthew and suggested that some kids were insecure and acted mean to others. In the hallway, Matthew asked Becca if she was \"full of it\" like Justin was. He asked her to hang out after school. Becca wanted to know what the point was, since he wasn't able to do anything. \n\n\nAt Sitwell Institute in Rochester, an anxious Marty and calm John waited while their IDs were verified. At last, Ellen Kwan returned, but advised them there was a problem. She stated that Powell Lord had not received any family visits during his time there and she was worried about his reaction when \"Jessica\" and \"Kevin\" were brought in. She added that he had been sedated and confused at different times, but was a danger only to himself. She preferred that only one person go in at a time. \n\n\nAfter some disagreement, Marty finally persuaded John to allow her to go first. After the women left, John headed to the computer. Spying the article related to the search for himself and Marty, John quickly deleted it and attempted to search the hospital records for information on Powell. When an orderly abruptly entered and demanded to know what John was doing, he assured the man that he had been merely checking his email. The orderly directed John to get away from the computer and to read some magazines if he was bored. \n\n\nOnce alone again, John spied the cabinet marked \"patient files\" and pulled Powell's folder from the drawer. Rifling through the papers, he grabbed one and put it into his pocket. Down the hall, Ellen agreed to allow Marty to visit with Powell on her own, deeming him harmless to others. \n\n\nAs Marty entered the padded room, she found Powell sitting on the floor, restrained by a straitjacket. \"Hello Powell,\" Marty greeted him. \"Do I know you?\" Powell asked her. \"I'm not sure, do you?\" she replied. He meekly responded that he knew she wasn't a cousin because his family never came to see him. \n\n\nHe admitted that he had been bad and hurt girls, especially one. He wanted to see her to apologize, he continued. He added that if he could get out again for good, he would. Marty abruptly cut him short and asked if he ever left the facility. Powell acknowledged that he went to the showers and the dining room but not out. He added that if he were to get out, he wouldn't hurt people like he did in the past. \n\n\n\"You sure I don't know you?\" he asked Marty. \"You're not my cousin.\" Powell smiled as Marty left his room. \n\n\nEllen thought that Powell had enough excitement for one day and suggested that John return the following day for a visit. Marty expressed her feelings that Powell was confused, but admitted to John that she remembered him. Back in their motel room they determined that even if Powell was passive and pumped full of meds, it was possible that he could still be a killer and faking it. Sociopaths were skilled at appearing harmless, they agreed. \n\n\nJohn pulled the paper from his pocket and advised Marty that a doctor had been visiting Powell. The times and dates coincided with the murders and Blair's stabbing. Looking at the paper, Marty gasped. It was her name on the paper! \n\n\nFinally tossing some clothes into a bag, Starr was ready to leave. Todd immediately noticed that she was still wearing the same clothes and didn't change them at all. \"I changed a lot Dad,\" she replied. He ushered his kids out the door, directing Starr to stop texting until she was in the car. Responding that she was telling Langston goodbye, she sent her message to Cole. He picked up his phone after vomiting into the trashcan. Starr promised to be back. \n\n\nNora thanked Bo for being understanding. He related how he had looked at pictures from the past and realized that Matthew would not be standing up again and that things would never be the same. Nora expressed her conflicted emotions; she was angry but felt relieved. She was very confused. Bo tipped her face towards his. He proclaimed that things hadn't turned out the way they thought they would.\n\n\n",
