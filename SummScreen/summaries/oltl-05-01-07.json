Rex assured Michael that Todd and Blair had been banished from Chicago and that all roads would lead Todd to that \"phony death certificate.\" Michael headed back to the hospital and Rex continued to do online research about Tate. He eventually found a little tidbit: Tate had been married. \n\n\nAdriana began to open up to Dorian about Rex; she was worried that he hadn't returned any of her calls. Dorian thought Adriana was working too hard to prove to Rex that there was nothing between her and Tate. Dorian reminded her daughter that \"Rex adores you.\" Dorian shared \u2014 or shall we say gushed \u2014 that she had been seeing Clint. She would not go so far as to say they were in love. \n\n\nJessica explained to Antonio how she ended up at the quarry the day of Jamie's custody hearing. However, she then keeled over with a killer headache. She said she had run into Nash. \"It was fate,\" she said. Jessica kept getting dizzy but insisted on telling Antonio about Nash. Antonio kept putting words in Jessica's mouth. \"He has feelings for you, Jess,\" he said. Jessica collapsed in Antonio's arms before she could continue telling him the truth. She was admitted to the hospital and Michael began running tests. Jessica's family gathered at the hospital and started to look very worried. \n\n\nA dapperly dressed Nash ran into Vincent at the bar. Nash remained certain that Jessica would be leaving Antonio to start a future with him. Vincent wished him the best as Nash waited and waited and waited. \n\n\nNatalie told Viki she was going to be working for Buchanan Enterprises. Viki asked Natalie if she was ready to get involved in another relationship, perhaps with Vincent. Natalie dodged the question, saying she was looking forward to working with Asa. \n\n\nBlair rang Viki and asked if she'd heard from Todd. Viki promised she get back to Blair if she did. An exasperated Blair tried to think through what might have happened. She used that old detective trick of rubbing a pencil over a piece of paper, thereby revealing the address where Todd had gone. Blair headed to said address and gingerly entered the room. \"Todd, are you in here?\" she said. She saw blood on the floor and then looked down the barrel of a gun. \"Get up slowly,\" demanded a man's voice. He turned out to be a detective who encouraged Blair to leave. \"This is a dangerous part of town,\" he said. Blair left. They took a sample of Todd's blood (or what Blair thought was his blood) and were going to test it at the lab. Blair, we soon saw, didn't left the building. She returned to the room and stared at the blood on the floor. While talking to herself, she found an old photo of herself and the kids, and realized Todd had been there. \"Oh Todd, where are you?\" she wondered aloud. \n\n\n",
