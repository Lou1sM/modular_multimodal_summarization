As Bo leaned in close to Nora, Marcie appeared. At first glance, Marcie assumed the occupants of the car were students, who had snuck away to make out. Upon observing Bo and Nora in the car, Marcie apologized for accusing them of groping each other. Marcie joked that they would never do such a thing. Bo and Nora shared a nervous laugh. \n\n\nWhen Bo and Nora mentioned that they were checking on Matthew, Marcie related that a student had directed awful remarks at Matthew. Nora said that she wanted to take Matthew out of Llanview High, and Bo demanded to know the name of Matthew's harasser. Marcie urged Matthew's parents to allow him to fight his own battles. After considering Marcie's argument, Bo convinced Nora that Marcie was right. \n\n\nBefore walking off, Marcie laughed when she thought about Bo and Nora making out in the school parking lot. After composing themselves, Bo and Nora drove off. \n\n\nJack and Sam were thrilled to return home with Todd, but Starr was consumed with anger. Todd showered his sons with gifts and urged Starr to join them in a family celebration. Worried about Cole, Starr went upstairs to check on him. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Cole lay on the floor in Starr's bedroom at La Boulaie, suffering withdrawal symptoms. After receiving a call from Starr, a terrified Cole begged her to return and mentioned that he needed something to ease the pain. Warning him not to take any pills, Starr pleaded with Cole to go to bed and sleep it off. As Starr tried to calm Cole's nerves, Todd yanked the phone out of her hand. Assuming that Schuyler was on the other line, Todd screamed into the phone, \"Stay away from my daughter, you drug addict!\" \n\n\nWhile Cole wrestled with his demons, Dorian stood on the other side of the bedroom door. With her hand on the doorknob, Dorian phoned Langston and informed her that Todd had taken Starr away. Dorian told Langston that she was going to gather some of Starr's possessions to ensure that she would be comfortable at Todd's home. As she continued to rant about Todd, Dorian decided that she wouldn't give Todd the satisfaction of believing that he had won. Walking away from the door, Dorian told Langston that she would leave Starr's possessions inside her bedroom. \n\n\nLashing out at her father, Starr accused Todd of attempting to steal her baby, and chastised Todd for ruining Cole's life. To Todd's surprise, Starr said that she had a sudden revelation -- she realized that she had wanted to give Marcie custody of Hope just to get back at Todd. Starr was certain that she had inherited Todd's evil traits. Refusing to believe that Starr could be that spiteful, Todd said that Starr was a better person than he was. \n\n\nWhen Todd remarked that Starr hated him, she surprised him by revealing that she actually loved him. In tears, Starr revealed that she wanted her old dad back, not the awful person that he had become after she became pregnant. \n\n\nInsisting that Todd was once a good person, Starr challenged him. She stated that if Todd loved her as much as he claimed, he would allow her to leave. Todd asked Starr to stay with the family for the day. When Starr maintained that she needed to leave immediately, Todd wondered why Starr was in such a hurry. Starr blurted out that Cole needed her or else he would die. \n\n\nAs Cole continued to fight his demons, he had a flashback of the night that Todd had beaten him. A mirage of Todd appeared and referred to him as a loser. Cole began to have hallucinations of Marty, Markko, Nora, Matthew, and Schuyler. The apparitions chastised Cole about his drug use and blamed him for Matthew's accident. While Cole's hallucinations grew worse, he screamed for the images to go away. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica met Brody on the patio and the two shared a passionate kiss. Brody said that he had to see her and that he hated sneaking around. The two discussed that it was necessary to keep their relationship a secret until Shane had fully recovered and Stacy's blackmail was exposed. \n\n\nMeanwhile inside the library of Llanfair, Viki received a call from Ellen Kwan, the administrator of the Sitwell institute. Ellen asked Viki to make a donation to the clinic, and related that Viki's children, Kevin and Jessica, had paid a visit to Powell. A suspicious Viki later phoned Kevin in London. Afterward, Viki called out to Jessica, but the doorbell interrupted her. Dorian barged into Llanfair and demanded that Viki prevent Todd from taking the children away from Blair. \n\n\nInside their motel room, John presented Marty with the sign-in rooster that he had stolen from the Sitwell Institute. Someone had signed in to visit Powell. The visitor had signed the name, Marty Saybrooke, and the times and dates corresponded to the stabbings that had occurred in Llanview. Stating that someone had obviously forged Marty's signature, John was certain that the culprit was attempting to make it appear that John and Marty were both involved in the murders. \n\n\nAt the Sitwell Institute, someone dressed in a doctor's jacket, bearing the name Dr. Marty Saybrooke, entered. Greeting the impostor, Ellen Kwan announced, \"Your patient received a visit from family members.\" After observing the names on the log, the unknown person angrily tossed the clipboard. \n\n\nFrom a pre-paid phone, John placed a call to someone that he believed could give them a lead on who might have forged Marty's signature. \n\n\nWhile Dorian continued to lash out at Viki, John phoned Viki. Realizing that John desperately needed her help, Viki escorted Dorian out of the house. John maintained his innocence and told Viki that he was being set up for the murders. Viki surmised that John and Marty had posed as Kevin and Jessica at Sitwell. Admitting that he needed information concerning Powell, John asked if there had been a special woman in Powell's life. Viki remembered a particular woman that had played an important part in Powell's life. \n\n\nAfter hanging up with John, Viki went looking for Jessica. When Viki stepped out on the patio, Brody hid in the bushes. Viki smiled as she noticed a glow on Jessica's face that she hadn't seen in a long time. Hearing a noise in the bushes, Viki picked up the phone to call the police. Cornered, Jessica told Brody to show his face. \n\n\nBack at the motel, John told Marty that Powell, before suffering a breakdown, had been engaged to a woman named Rebecca Lewis. Rebecca had also been involved with Todd. Marty had no recollection of Rebecca Lewis. John advised Marty that they needed to find Rebecca Lewis at once. \n\n\nAfter conducting an Internet search, John and Marty discovered that Rebecca was also a doctor. She quit her job at the clinic six months prior. John phoned his contact at the Bureau to learn more about Rebecca. John's contact had no information regarding Rebecca's whereabouts over the past six months. \n\n\nBack at Sitwell, the unknown person signed the register as, \"Marty Saybrooke.\" Allowing the imposter inside Powell's room, Ellen mentioned that Powell always seemed more relaxed after \"Marty's\" visits. After Kwan had closed the door and left the imposter alone with Powell, he looked up, and with a huge grin responded, \"Hi Rebecca!\" \n\n\nAs Rebecca helped Powell out of his straitjacket, she asked Powell about his recent visitors. Powell informed Rebecca that Marty had paid him a visit, but he was convinced that she wasn't aware of their plans. Powell was certain that John McBain was the other visitor. Powell told Rebecca that John was a smart ex-cop. Powell stated that he knew John would follow the trail back to him. Powell insisted that things were going according to plan. \n\n\nMarty had a difficult time believing that Rebecca could be responsible for the murders. John suggested that they get some sleep. Marty and John looked over at the single bed. \n\n\nRebecca and Powell embraced. Expressing her love for Powell, Rebecca said that there wasn't anything that she wouldn't do for him. In a stern voice, a very lucid Powell replied, \"That's' why you're going to get me out of here soon. I've got places to go and people to kill!\"\n\n\n",
