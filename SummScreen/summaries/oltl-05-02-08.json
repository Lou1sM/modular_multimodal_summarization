    "soap_central": "\n\nStarr and Cole arrived at their destination-an oceanfront property. Cole hugged Starr and proclaimed, \"This is where we are going to start our new life together.\" Upon entering their room in the boarding house, Starr and Cole were under the assumption that they would have the room to themselves but were told by the guy in charge that several other teens would be sharing the room. When Cole attempted to make other arrangements, Starr intervened and agreed to share the room with the other boarders. Starr told Cole that the room was cheap and they wouldn't attract any unwanted attention because they could blend in with their roommates. Starr and Cole were given advance notice by their tour guide, Winter, that activity around the grounds was pretty dead, but once Memorial Day approached things were expected to liven up. Winter suggested that Starr and Cole's roommates would be in the mood to party practically every night once they arrived. Alone in their new surroundings, Starr worried if they would be able to survive on their own. As Starr looked around the barren room, Cole attempted to convince her that they would be able to make a lot of money waiting on tables. He promised that this lifestyle would only be temporary. Cole said they would be able to afford a nice apartment by the end of the summer. Cole told Starr that they would leave immediately if it appeared that anyone was onto them. Cole reminded Starr of their aliases, Dan and Mindy, and expressed his certainty that no one would ever learn their secret. Starr asked Cole if he regretted giving up his life, but Cole stated that Starr and the baby made him feel so much better about his life. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, Todd barged into Ramsey's office and demanded to know John's whereabouts. Todd told Ramsey that Cole had kidnapped Starr and blamed Ramsey for his troubles. Todd believed that had Ramsey arrested Cole for shooting Miles Laurence and not allowed John to take the blame, Cole wouldn't have been able to abduct Starr. When Ramsey laughed at Todd's reasoning, Todd gave him an ultimatum-either find Starr or press charges against Cole for the shooting. Refusing to take Todd seriously, Ramsey kicked Todd out of his office. Before leaving, Todd threatened to enlist Gigi's help and take down Ramsey once and for all. Realizing that he wouldn't receive assistance from Ramsey, Todd warned Ramsey he would get what was coming to him, and left. \n\n\nAt Blair's request, John arrived at La Boulaie to discuss finding Starr and Cole. Blair blamed Todd for causing Starr to run away and told John that she wanted to do whatever she could to bring Starr home, but without Todd's interference. John agreed to help and suggested that speaking to Langston would be the best place to start. As Blair expressed her fear that Starr might never return home, Dorian entered the room and was stunned to learn that Starr had run away with Cole. When Blair blamed Langston for helping Starr run off, Dorian refused to believe Langston was involved. Dorian blamed an emotional Blair for being unable to communicate with Starr. After realizing that Langston assisted Starr in running away, Dorian became enraged and stated that she expected so much more from Langston. John said that he wanted to speak with Langston and Markko after he followed up on a few leads. Believing that she could get the truth from Langston, Dorian asked John to allow her to question Langston first. \n\n\nAs John prepared to leave, Todd arrived and began blaming John for Starr running off with Cole. Refusing to argue with an irate Todd, John left. Dorian told Blair that she intended to get the truth out of Langston, but Todd suggested that he should have a chat with Langston. Dorian warned Todd to stay away from Langston and threatened to kill him if he didn't. As Dorian headed upstairs, Todd began to rant about everyone who would pay for his troubles with Starr. Unable to take anymore of Todd's attacks, Blair blamed Todd for Starr's troubles and suggested that he accept responsibility and stop placing blame on everyone else. Todd and Blair continued to argue about Todd's behavior. When Todd suggested that Blair give Starr some tips on great sex, Blair became enraged and slapped him. Blair told Todd that she was done and was through with his \"crap.\" \n\n\nUpstairs, Langston helped Markko sneak into Starr's bedroom. Langston told Markko that Todd left La Boulaie in a fit of rage after learning that Starr had run off with Cole. Langston worried that Todd would eventually find their friends and hoped that Starr and Cole had gotten far away from Llanview. When Langston expressed her desire to speak with Starr, Markko appeared suspicious. Realizing that Markko knew more than he was saying, Langston accused him of knowing exactly where Starr and Cole had gone. Markko denied knowing where they were, but admitted to having the ability to contact them. Markko told Langston that Cole had purchased two prepaid cell phones. Cole had given one to Markko to use in case of an emergency. Because no one other than Markko was aware that the phones existed, calls placed between Cole and Markko would be untraceable. Upon learning that Markko had the phones, Langston persuaded Markko to call Cole so that she could warn Starr of the situation at home. \n\n\nAs Langston spoke with Starr, Dorian knocked at the door. While Markko hid in the closet, Langston quickly hung up the phone and placed it in her book bag. Upon entering the room, Dorian asked Langston why she was in Starr's bedroom. When Langston claimed to be looking for clues that would lead her to Starr's whereabouts, Dorian wondered what she had hidden in the bag. As Langston continued to make excuses and Markko was in a state of panic in the closet, Dorian opened the bag and began searching through it. When Dorian picked up a book, a terrified Langston begged Dorian to put it back. Dorian asked Langston why she would have a book regarding pregnancy in her possession. While Langston stood speechless, Markko exited the closet and announced that Langston was pregnant. A stunned Langston stared at Markko. \n\n\nWinter joined Starr and Cole in the room. As Winter continued to predict that soon there would be non-stop partying at the boarding house, Starr appeared disturbed. After refusing a beer from Winter for the second time, Starr told him that she was pregnant. After Winter left the room, Cole lashed out at Starr for mentioning her pregnancy. When Starr announced that she made the decision because she was the one who was pregnant, Cole asked her if she blamed him for the pregnancy. \n\n\nAt the police station, Eddie harassed Talia about her affair with John. As Antonio approached, Talia admitted to having a hot date with John later. Realizing that Antonio had heard her statement, Talia apologized to Antonio. Antonio told Talia that he couldn't care less if she chose to ruin her career by having an affair with John. Frustrated with Antonio, Talia stated that she wasn't having an affair and insinuated that she might be in love. After telling Talia that he wanted nothing more to do with her, Antonio entered Ramsey's office and asked to leave early. Antonio claimed he wanted to spend some time with Jamie, and Ramsey gave his approval. When Ramsey asked Antonio how he was handling the situation with Talia and John, Antonio stated, \"It's not my problem, commissioner.\" As Antonio exited the office, he approached Talia and John and wished them a good time on their date, commented that their behavior would never cause him to quit, and walked away. John told Talia to pretend that her conversation with Antonio never happened and they left to begin their date. Having witnessed the entire incident, Ramsey approached Eddie and ordered him to follow John and Talia. Ramsey demanded that Eddie make sure that John and Talia were actually together. As Eddie headed off to tail John and Talia, Ramsey looked suspicious. \n\n\nJohn and Talia arrived at their destination, near the ocean. As they walked along the boardwalk, Talia asked John if he thought they had lost Eddie. John believed they had and stated that he was glad they were finally alone. Putting her arm around John, Talia said, \"Just as we planned!\" As they continued down the boardwalk, John and Talia discussed how beautiful their surroundings were. John stated, \"What a beautiful place to be with someone you love.\" Hearing the sound of a boat, John and Talia looked out into the ocean. Neither seemed surprised to see Antonio approaching in the boat. John approached Antonio and asked if he was sure he wanted to do it because he was taking a real risk. Stating that it was worth it, Antonio embraced Talia and they shared a passionate kiss. John smiled as he watched the couple enjoy a special long overdue moment. \n\n\nIn Texas, Natalie and Jared arrived at the Buchanan Ranch and were greeted by Chuck Wilson. Expecting to find Clint and Bo at the ranch, Natalie wondered where they were. After Jared admitted to lying to Natalie about a meeting with Calvin Jenkins taking place, Natalie became infuriated and demanded to know why Jared would go to such extremes to get her alone. Jared told Natalie that he loved her, but a distraught Natalie responded by running out of the mansion. Jared chased after Natalie and located her in the yard. Natalie expressed her feelings about Jared choosing to be a Buchanan over his so-called love for her. Natalie demanded to know why Jared insisted on getting her up to the ranch. Jared told Natalie that he brought her to the ranch because that is where he fell in love with her. Jared believed that Natalie fell in love with him at that very place as well. In tears, Natalie continued to deny her feelings for Jared. After much pleading, Jared told Natalie that he would leave the decision up to her. Breaking away from Jared's grasp, Natalie told him that it was too late because he had already made his choice. Feeling he had lost her for good, Jared was heartbroken. Taking a look back at Jared, Natalie could no longer deny her love for Jared and pulled him into an embrace. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr and Cole have arrived at the first place they plan to stay. It's a tiny room in a cheap spring break motel. It's not like what they are used to. But they determine that they want to be together forever no matter what. Langston and Cole keep in contact with them via a pre-paid cell phone. Todd and Blair are both frantic about Starr disappearing and arguing with each other. Dorian is also upset and disappointed with Langston for keeping the secret. Jared gets Natalie to meet him at Asa's ranch in Texas. She assumes it's for a business meeting. But he reveals to her that it's because he wants to take her back to the place where he first fell in love with her and she-him. She tells him it's over between them. But he does not want to believe that.",
