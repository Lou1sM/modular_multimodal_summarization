He will be available 24/7 should she need anything. She refuses to leave the abandoned building though and Dorian promises to stand by her. Blair wonders who could have done such an awful thing to Todd, who could hate him so much. As she ponders her question, she comes up with an answer. Spencer. There's no proof that he's actually dead, she insists.\n\n\nViki, Natalie and Antonio wait for some news concerning Jessica's tests, talking quietly in her room. Sedated for the tests, she awakens slowly, asking \"Is he here?\" She looks directly at Antonio and confirms a little too quickly that she was looking for him. She wonders what time it is and admits she's tired and achy. Natalie steps into the hallway to speak with Clint on the phone and runs into Miles, who had been visiting Marty. She makes him aware of Jess' condition. A little later, when Nat is alone with Jess, she questions her on the real scoop with Nash. She reminds her sister that she's Antonio's wife. Jess claims that she and Nash are only close due to their daughter. John stops by Marty's office to tell her that Cole visited him. He thinks she should know that he was at the firing range, not an especially great place for kids to be. He knows how anti-violence Patrick was and how his son follows in his footsteps. Marty is quite surprised that her son has opened up to John but thinks that maybe his troubling days are behind him. They agree that he's really a good kid. She believes that Cole looks at John as a role model, having been through a similar situation. John is looking pretty ill at ease over that thought, but thinks it'll be good for both of them. He receives a call from Blair and offers to fly to Chicago to help in the search for Todd. \n\n\nAs a frantic Nash waits at Rodi's for Jessica, making phone calls, Evangeline meets up with Layla. She confirms that she's not pregnant though it appears that neither of the women are actually relieved about it. Evangeline was nervous but excited, she admits, though it's probably better this way. Layla was kind of looking forward to being an aunt and she can see that her sister was really ready to step up if need be. When Miles arrives and overhears Nash asking about Jess, he is quick to let him know that Jess has collapsed and is in the hospital. Shortly after, Evangeline receives a call from Blair, asking if she's heard from Todd and to please let her know if she does. When Miles hears that Todd is missing, he runs out of the bar. Layla turns the tables on Evangeline and decides she's not good parent material after all; here she is now, all concerned with Todd. She and Cris aren't good together anyway, since they were fighting all of the time. Big sis is annoyed and points out that they never fought until Todd came into the picture and she thinks Layla is being rather blunt. Mr. Right is out there, Layla assures her. At least now she knows she does want a baby, states Evangeline, but agrees that she should take care of herself for awhile. Everything else will fall into place, Layla confirms.\n\n\nStarr and Langston feel pretty badly over Britney's treatment of Henry and when Cole arrives and gets filled in, he berates Britney as well. She's only thinking that perhaps she and Cole will be the leads in the school show. Henry returns to the park with a gift for Britney; he's bought a pair of earrings that she liked. Britney is her usual ugly self and tells him how ugly they are, that she never really liked them. She is rude and brutal and makes fun of him. The good guys point out what a worthless bitch she is and try to tell Henry as much. He really can't hear them but can only go on about how no one ever likes him, that it's always the same no matter where he goes. All of it will go to crap, he's a loser and an idiot to think she liked him, he continues. No matter what Cole or Starr or Langston say to him, it's of no use. They're worried that he'll do something extreme. He flees the park and at home on his computer, writes of his plan. He ignores the phone when Starr tries to call him and instead, grinds the earrings into his hand, cutting himself. Stick to the plan, he tells himself as he types.\n\n\nMiles runs to Marty, telling her that it's his fault that Todd is missing. He gave him the clue from Spencer. Marty tries to assure him that he's not responsible, that trouble finds Todd always. Jess goes back to sleep while Nat and Viki discuss her stress levels and the unhealthy situation with Nash. Nash shows up at the hospital also but when Antonio sees him, he yells at him to leave. Nash gives him a hard time but when security shows up, Nash is physically removed. \"JESSICA,\" he yells. \"Nash,\" Jess mumbles. \n\n\n",
