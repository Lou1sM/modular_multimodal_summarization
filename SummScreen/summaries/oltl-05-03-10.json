Greg tried to interrupt multiple times and finally succeeded. He revealed that she had a brain tumor. T\u00e9a was skeptical, but Greg assured her the tumor had shown up in the many tests that were run. Hastily, she pulled her planner from her purse and advised him that she would clear her schedule so that surgery could be performed on May tenth.\n\n\nGreg gently advised T\u00e9a that they could not remove the tumor because it would kill her. There were various methods such as chemotherapy and drugs that would shrink the tumor, but it was Stage Four and growing fast. They could reduce the size of the tumor, but it would grow back, Greg explained. They would keep her comfortable and as free of pain as possible, but she would die from it, he concluded.\n\n\nGreg continued his explanation that the tumor was complex and difficult to diagnose. He would try to buy her time and lessen her suffering. He offered to call someone because he thought it was important that T\u00e9a have a support system. T\u00e9a declined and announced that she would get a second opinion. Greg had assumed she would and had a copy of her records to give her. T\u00e9a asked how much time she had, but Greg stated that it was different with every person. She asked again and Greg replied apologetically. Three to six months, he told her.\n\n\nBlair and Kelly were finally forced to share their innermost feelings when they found themselves alone on the elevator. Kelly was sure that Todd hadn't pushed Marty down the stairs and killed her baby. Blair snapped that decent people didn't kill other people's babies, but her baby died because of Kelly. The anniversary of that event had just occurred, Blair reminded Kelly.\n\n\nThe women continued their conversation in a waiting area as Kelly assured Blair that if it were possible, she would have given the baby back to Blair. Kelly had apologized too many times to count, but she thought of her own lost baby all of the time too. She thought that Blair was fortunate to have someone to blame for her loss, while Kelly could only blame herself for her own miscarriage. She often thought about the one thing that she might have done to cause the miscarriage, and she blamed herself for that and Brendan's death. Her mother was murdered recently, and she wanted to know if that was enough payback for Blair.\n\n\nBlair insisted it wasn't about payback but about having to see Kelly at all. She was annoyed that Kelly had stuck around and figured it was probably to \"stick it\" to Blair, especially after Kelly accepted a job with Todd. Kelly denied Blair's accusation and revealed that she had been so desperate that she would have accepted a job with anyone. She had hidden in London, but after Zane left for boarding school, she couldn't hide any longer. She felt worthless and then her mother was murdered.\n\n\nBlair charged that Kelly had \"glommed onto John,\" but Kelly pointed out that he was a good detective and she hadn't tried to hurt Blair by her association with John. Blair thought that Kelly should leave Llanview because that would help Blair to make her life better. Kelly indicated that Blair had her children and a great guy, and she thought that was something Blair should settle for. \"I'd take it,\" Kelly said. Blair looked pensive as Kelly continued. She wanted to have the support of the Cramer women, but all Blair had done was reject her, time and time again, Kelly stated. A thoughtful Blair appeared to have a sudden change of heart.\n\n\nKelly knew that things were tough for Blair too, especially given the situation with Todd and Cole. She needed Blair's forgiveness and maybe they could help each other out, Kelly pleaded. Blair admitted that she had been through the \"ugly dance\" with Todd and Cole many times but this had been the worst. She couldn't find the words to explain it all to her other children, especially Jack. She thought that Kelly always made things look easy. Kelly disclosed that she had learned everything from Blair. She told Blair how sorry she was, and Blair echoed her sentiments. The women shared an honest hug for the first time in years.\n\n\nMarty entered Todd's room and demanded that he drop the charges against Cole. She had fought successfully against all of the other distresses he had forced upon her, but he had killed her baby and she wanted Todd to do that for them. Todd insisted he wasn't the one who had pushed her. Marty advised him that she and Cole weren't going anywhere, but Todd would be headed to prison. Todd would lose everyone and everything. Todd was certain that Hannah had lied for Cole because Cole had cheated on Starr. Marty thought it was ridiculous to think that Cole had planned on pushing Marty down the stairs.\n\n\nAgain, Marty told Todd to drop the charges and Todd repeated that Cole was behind the entire episode. Cole had Hannah lie to get rid of Todd, but Todd was the only one who loved Starr more than Cole, Todd whispered. Marty accused Todd of being \"paranoid and delusional\" because Cole could not have planned his mother's fall. She was sorry that Cole had put himself in the position that he had, but she wouldn't have cared if Todd was dead. John should never have saved Todd when Todd jumped off the Palace Hotel years before. She was not able to give Todd the redemption he sought from her.\n\n\nMarty thought that Todd had been upset that John had ruined Todd's fantasy when he found Marty with Todd, but John had given her a new life. They were happy until Todd pushed her. Todd denied that he had committed the assault and claimed that a \"half-baked tramp\" had made up the lies. \"I didn't do it this time,\" Todd declared. Marty reiterated that Hannah saw and would testify in court, and Marty would tell everyone what Todd had said prior to the fall. She would live with the result and celebrate, and she was sure that lots of people would rejoice with her.\n\n\nTodd didn't think everyone would celebrate, but Marty was certain that no one would stick with Todd. Even Starr and T\u00e9a would walk away and he would wish he were dead, she snapped.\n\n\nNate encountered Dani at Angel Square Park when he retrieved her phone that had narrowly missed his head when Dani threw it. He sat by her side as he noticed that Dani was obviously in distress. Suddenly, she leaned over and began to kiss him but, embarrassed, she stopped as quickly as she had begun. She told him it was about her father. She told Nate that she had invited Todd to rehearsal because he was \"human-like\" and it was nice for her not to be angry for a change. She had seen Todd for the first time and she had seen herself in him and vice-versa. Nate joked that Dani was prettier but she didn't laugh.\n\n\nDani was upset that whatever it was in Todd that had caused him to push Marty existed in herself as well. Everyone told her there was good in Todd,  but he was a monster and she was confused again. Nate put his arms around her. Dani acknowledged that she had tried to do what T\u00e9a and Starr wanted her to do and that was to love Todd for who he was, not what he had done. Nate confidently told her that people were faced with agonizing decisions and choices all of the time and their choices defined them. Dani was impressed, but Nate joked that he had learned that from Woody Allen in Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n\nDani wasn't sure what she would do, but she thanked Nate for being there for her. As she walked away, she turned to look back at him but he was already engrossed in his script. Later, Nate smiled to himself as he recalled the kiss.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian opened the door to a charming Englishman who handed her his card. His name was Reed Wagner and he wanted to see Kelly. Abruptly, Dorian tried to explain that it wasn't a good time, but Reed was aware of Kelly's mother's death. He mentioned the great work that he had heard about the civic center thanks to David Vickers. Reed revealed that he had attended several Buchanan Enterprises functions and, at a charity event, David had attempted to involve Reed in an unsavory endeavor. In between talking about that, David had ,sung Dorian's praises, and it was evident that David really cared about Dorian.\n\n\nDorian's tone and demeanor suddenly changed, and when Reed replied in French to something that she said in the language, she almost melted. She insisted that Reed stay behind to wait for Kelly, but Reed declined. Dorian apologized for the third degree she had put him through. Reed left his contact information with Dorian and told her he could be found at the Palace.\n\n\nKelly returned home and faced Dorian as soon as she walked through the door. Dorian said Kelly \"looked like hell,\" but she wanted to know about Todd. Kelly assured her aunt it had been a long day and that Todd was in bad shape. Excitedly, Dorian told Kelly that a man had been looking for her. Kelly's face fell when she heard it was Reed Wagner.\n\n\nJohn escorted Cole to a cell in the police station. Cole swore he'd stay there his entire life if it would keep Todd away from Marty. He would have killed Todd if he could have, Cole confessed. John understood Cole's feelings, but Cole's life would have been over if he had killed Todd. He was worried about Cole and reminded the teen that was why they had laws.\n\n\nJohn noted that things had looked tense between Cole and Starr. Cole revealed that Starr had seen him beat her father, and he regretted that. John pointed out that Starr always stuck with Todd. Cole replied that this time Todd had killed a baby, and Hannah had seen him do it. Cole asked if Todd would be able to get out of the charges, but John was sure that Nora would be able to make them stick, especially after the conversation that Todd had with Marty prior to Marty's fall. Cole was sorry about John's baby, but John told him, \"Forget about it.\"\n\n\nJohn wanted to talk about it, though, and he admitted that he had been scared when he learned he would be a father. He didn't think he'd be a good one. Cole reminded him that fathers learned as they went along. John had begun to realize that he could do it, and he thought about taking his little boy to a baseball game or how beautiful and smart his little girl would be. Cole requested that John check on Starr even though she was angry at Cole. He wanted to make sure she was okay. John left Cole in his cell for the night.\n\n\nStarr pulled Hannah into an empty room and accused her of lying about Todd because Hannah wanted Cole for herself. Starr accused her of trying to break the couple apart. Hannah mentioned several of the crimes that Todd had committed previously and insisted that she had been scared of Todd after she saw him push Marty and he saw Hannah. She had gone to Cole instead of the police as a favor to Starr. \"Oh, how thoughtful of you,\" Starr retorted. Hannah thought that it would be better to hear about Todd's crime from Cole and that way Starr could have decided whether they should go to the police.\n\n\nHannah felt that Starr always let Todd off the hook, but he should be in jail, especially after all of the other wrongs he had been responsible for. She began to cite the incidents, but Starr shouted that it was none of Hannah's business. Hannah cited that it was all a matter of public record, and Starr would let Todd get away with murder. Starr couldn't believe what she heard as Hannah suggested that it would be difficult for Starr to choose between her \"blind loyalty\" to Todd or Cole, the guy Starr allegedly loved.\n\n\nHannah thought that Starr needed to think that Hannah was lying but she wondered how Starr could look Cole in the eye. Starr thought that Hannah figured it would be difficult for Starr and Cole to stay together after all of this, or maybe she just wished for them to break up. She was sure that Hannah had lied. Cole had attacked her father because of Hannah's lies, and Cole was in jail. Soon her dad would be in jail, too, Starr raged. She urged Hannah to talk to John or else end up in prison for lying. Starr assured Hannah that Cole and Starr would still be together, and Hannah would never break them up.\n\n\nAfter she heard the diagnosis, T\u00e9a asked Greg to leave her alone for a time. She suggested he save someone else's life. Once he was gone, the denial and anger set in. T\u00e9a groaned and knocked all of the items off of Greg's desk. Hearing the noise, Blair walked into the office to see if things were all right. She was surprised to see T\u00e9a.\n\n\nStarr paid a visit to Cole and he apologized for what had happened and for what she had seen. She handed him a photo of their little family to keep with him. She told him she loved him and Cole reciprocated. He was happy to see her, since he thought she would have left long before. Starr confirmed that she had been with Hannah, and she was positive that Hannah had lied about what she had seen at the hospital. She had no proof yet, but she was determined to get to the truth.\n\n\nHannah made sure to find John after her discussion with Starr. She inquired whether Todd would be out and about any time soon, since she was nervous about that. John assured her that Todd would be imprisoned after he left the hospital, and he found it highly unlikely that Todd would make bail.\n\n\nJohn had another visitor when Marty showed up. He told her that Cole was \"hangin' in,\" but John wanted to know how Marty was. She made it known that while she was doing well physically, she wasn't as good in other areas. He wrapped his arms around her.\n\n\nAs a nurse looked after Todd, he offered her one million dollars to remove his handcuffs. Dani lurked nearby and listened to the nurse's refusal. When the nurse had gone, Dani walked into the room and pulled aside the drape surrounding Todd's bed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dr. Greg tells T\u00e9a that he's run many tests on her and she has an inoperable brain tumor and only 3 to 6 months to live. Meanwhile, Hannah wants to convince Starr that she saw Todd push Marty down the stairs. But Starr does not believe it and tells her she just wants Cole to believe that so that she can take him from Starr. Cole and Marty both believe that Todd pushed Marty and caused her to lose her baby. Dani is wondering what to do and talks to Nate.",
