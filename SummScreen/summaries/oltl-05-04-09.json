After begging her father to trust her, Starr convinced Todd to let her leave. \n\n\nBlair staggered into Todd's house on a cane and ordered him to return her children. Admitting that she had left the hospital without being discharged, Blair chastised Todd for obtaining custody while she was hospitalized. When Todd refused to bring the children downstairs, Blair attempted to walk up the staircase, but collapsed in Todd's arms. \n\n\nOnce Blair composed herself, Todd suggested that she return to the hospital. When Blair refused to leave without her children, Todd teased her about marrying a murderer. Disturbed by the mention of John, Blair acknowledged that John was gone, but stated that she planned to get her children back. Todd informed Blair that he had no plans of relinquishing custody, and asked her to leave. Blair announced that as long as her children remained under Todd's roof, so would she. \n\n\nAt the motel, Marty noticed that something was bothering John. Marty was stunned when John admitted that the motel room reminded him of the place where they had made love. Marty listened intently as John detailed that special night. John explained that their brief affair ended abruptly after Marty was kidnapped and presumed dead in Ireland. \n\n\nMarty wondered what would have happened if their relationship had been given a chance. John admitted that he often had the same thought. Appearing very comfortable together, the two shared a quiet moment. \n\n\nLater, John was consumed with emotions when he noticed Marty preparing for bed. While Marty made herself comfortable under the sheets, John lay on top of the covers. Marty reached over and touched John's hand. John responded by holding her tightly. \n\n\nInside Starr's bedroom at La Boulaie, Cole's hallucinations grew worse. An apparition of Matthew appeared and insisted that Cole jump out of the window. The image informed Cole that he could make things right with Matthew if he leaped out of the window and became paralyzed. Distraught, Cole crawled to the window and announced that he would jump. \n\n\nBefore Cole could leap to his death, Starr entered the room and convinced him to listen to her. Starr helped Cole realize that, as a result of the detox, he was suffering hallucinations. Starr assured Cole that Matthew would never want Cole to receive payback for the accident. Starr helped Cole into bed and stroked his hair. Looking up at her, Cole thanked Starr for saving his life and expressed his love for her. Cradling him in her arms, Starr told Cole that she loved him, too. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody listened as Jessica attempted to explain their relationship to Viki. After admitting that she was involved with Brody, Jessica begged her mother to keep their relationship a secret. Jessica was touched when Brody assured Viki that he truly cared for Jessica. As Viki demanded answers from the couple, Natalie interrupted and accused Brody of taking advantage of Jessica. \n\n\nViki was shocked when Natalie revealed that Brody had slept with Gigi. Jessica and Brody made several attempts to explain, but they eventually gave up and staged a fight for Natalie's benefit. After Brody stormed off, Natalie offered Jessica her sympathy. \n\n\nAlone with Viki, Jessica thanked her mother for keeping her secret. Viki was dumbfounded when Jessica admitted that nothing had happened between Brody and Gigi. Jessica told Viki that Brody was a great guy and that Gigi was involved in a terrible situation. \n\n\nShane was visibly shaken when his parents escorted him home from the hospital. Rex and Gigi tried their best to ease Shane's fears, but the little boy was devastated that his parents were breaking up. As tears welled up in Gigi's eyes, Rex promised to maintain a close relationship with Shane. \n\n\nUnable to convince his parents to remain together, Shane bolted up the stairs. Gigi called out to Rex as he walked toward the door. A disappointed Rex stared at her and left the cottage. Gigi wept over losing the love of her life. \n\n\nHoping to get some answers, Viki paid Gigi a visit. Reminding Gigi that she had been happy before Stacy's arrival, Viki questioned if Gigi's breakup with Rex somehow involved Stacy. Gigi maintained that she was the cause of the breakup and insisted that she had slept with Brody. Refusing to accept Gigi's explanation, Viki stated that she knew that nothing had happened between Gigi and Brody. Viki continued to ask Gigi to be honest with her, but Gigi refused. \n\n\nAfter Viki left, Shane came downstairs and apologized for his outburst. Accepting Shane's apology, Gigi hugged her son and told him that she would die for him. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jess received a text message from Brody and ran outside to meet him. Jessica rushed into Brody's arms and the two shared a passionate kiss. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, Stacy sat on a park bench and complained about her predicament. A homeless woman took pity on Stacy and gave her a lesson on how to lure a man. Stacy was shocked when the homeless woman referred to her as \"sluty\" and advised her to play the role of the damsel in distress. \n\n\nA dejected Rex returned home and poured himself a drink. While consumed with thoughts of Gigi and Shane, Rex was startled when he opened the door and discovered Stacy on his doorstep. After explaining that she was broke and temporarily homeless, Stacy asked Rex if she could stay with him. Citing that she had saved his son's life, Rex agreed to allow Stacy to stay with him for a few days. \n\n\nCertain that she was making progress, Stacy smiled and remarked under her breath, \"Well, this is going to be easier than I thought!\" However, Stacy's happiness turned to disappointment when Rex handed her several blankets and directed her to the couch. Rex admitted that he was miserable over losing his family, and walked away. Stacy was heartbroken.\n\n\n",
