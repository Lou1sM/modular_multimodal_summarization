    "soap_central": "\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian spoke highly of her brief encounter with the \"divine\" Reed Wagner. Kelly wasn't impressed, even when Dorian noted that the man spoke \"gorgeous French.\" Dorian told her niece that Reed expressed his sympathies about Melinda's death and the women assumed Reed had heard the news from Kevin. Dorian persisted on finding out everything regarding the relationship between Kelly and Reed, but Kelly explained that she had only met him through entertaining clients for Kevin and Buchanan Enterprises. Dorian thought the man was quite handsome and charming, but Kelly insisted she hadn't noticed.\n\n\nDorian continued to push Kelly in Reed's direction and mentioned that Reed was at the Palace. Kelly wondered why she should care. Dorian felt that Kelly had spent too much time around Todd. Dorian continued on as she always did when meddling, but Kelly assured her aunt there was nothing going on between her and Reed. She had other news, though, and told her aunt that she and Blair had declared a truce. They were officially \"best buds.\" Dorian admitted she wouldn't hold her breath.\n\n\nReed sat at a table in the Palace and searched the Internet for information on Kelly. Jessica and Clint arrived for a meal and bumped into Brody. Jessica ignored the police officer while Clint chatted with Brody briefly. Brody promised Jessica he'd be in touch with her about the prom and was disappointed when Jessica continued on her way to her table without looking at him.\n\n\nJessica and Clint chatted about the prom, and Jessica admitted that she was taking Brody because Cristian would be attending with Layla who looked \"so old\" and Jessica didn't want to go alone. She felt she should go and both Viki and Marty agreed with her. Clint admitted that he hated to see someone with a broken heart and, while Jessica thought he was referring to Brody, he clarified that he meant Jessica. She conceded that Cristian had already \"stomped on\" her heart. As the two chatted, Reed approached their table to greet Clint.\n\n\nThe men chatted, and Clint introduced Reed to Jessica. The man questioned Jessica about her work, but Jessica disclosed that she was a high school senior. Reed looked at her oddly before he bid his farewell and returned to his own table. He returned to his fixation on learning about Kelly online.  Jessica thought it was peculiar that Reed had treated her as if she were a woman.\n\n\nFather and daughter returned to their prom discussion, and Clint offered to help Jessica to find a dress. They joked about the old dress from Asa that she had retrieved, and Clint assured Jessica he had experience in choosing clothes. Jessica didn't want to offend Asa, but Clint was sure that Asa would only want Jessica to be happy, the same as everyone else in the family. Jessica thanked Clint for forcing her to go to the prom. She admitted to feeling scared and excited. \"Everything is riding on prom night,\" she said.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rex sat with Natalie and showed her the necklace with the broken heart charm that had been found in his baby blanket. He explained that Bo had helped him to contact various jewelers through the police database for information on the jewelry. Natalie pointed out that she considered both Viki and Roxy to be mothers to her, and she knew that Roxy would always be Rex's mom. Rex realized that he hadn't seen Roxy for some time and reluctantly, Natalie admitted that Roxy had been spending time with Schuyler.\n\n\nFord sat at a nearby table and sent a text message to Langston. He wondered if he'd be able to see her. When he heard back from her that she wasn't available, Ford began to flirt with Gigi when she stopped at his table. She told him that while she was flattered, she wasn't interested.\n\n\nGigi sauntered over to Rex and Natalie, and Natalie filled them in on what had happened to Marty. She was happy to report that a witness had seen Todd push Marty down the flight of stairs, but Natalie had been John's prime suspect originally. Brody was the only one who had believed she was innocent, Natalie divulged. Rex was surprised to learn about John, but Gigi pointed out that people changed all of the time. She wanted Rex to know that there were all kinds of people who loved him.\n\n\nNatalie spotted Brody and jumped up to join him. She told him how relieved she was that she was off the hook for Marty's assault. Brody didn't think that John believed she had committed the crime but had only been doing his job. They praised each other for being a good friend. Brody mentioned the prom and admitted that he was sure Jessica was going with him to make Cristian jealous. He hoped that he would have another chance to get Jessica to remember her past.\n\n\nMarkko and Langston tried to get some work done at their apartment, but they disagreed about Cole's predicament and the circumstances surrounding it. When Karen arrived with a pizza, Langston took the time to text Ford that she was unable to meet with him. Outside in the hallway, Markko assured Karen that her secret about the Palace hotel was safe with him. Karen was confused as she walked away.\n\n\nMarkko exclaimed that he wanted to take a vacation with Langston because he was tired of everyone's problems, and things were stressful. Langston remained silent as she looked sullenly away from Markko. He was excited about the prom and promised that it was going to be better than the year before. Suddenly, Langston jumped up and yelled that she couldn't do it any longer. She admitted she had been lying.\n\n\nShe needed something different, and she had lied about the way she felt. She explained that Ford had helped her with her musical and it just happened, they were in love. She didn't want to hurt Markko. Things got ugly as he demanded to know how long she and Ford had been together, and Langston shrugged her shoulders to indicate that it had been awhile. She was sorry, she cried. Markko grabbed his beloved camera in a fit of anger and threw it against the wall. Langston was aghast that he had ruined his project and his future. Markko claimed that he had no future without her.\n\n\n\"Lying?\" Markko asked. Abruptly, Langston snapped out of her daydream and admitted that she had lied about the two of them studying together. She found it too distracting and couldn't concentrate. She had to finish her rewrites for the musical before the next rehearsal. Markko understood, since he had his own work to complete. He headed to their bedroom. Langston texted \"nite\" to Ford.\n\n\nDani entered Todd's room at the hospital and kept her distance as he asked if it were okay with her that he was fine and would stick around. She told him she was happy that he didn't die because no one should die. She would be concerned about Cole, Marty, and Starr whose lives would be ruined if that happened. Todd wondered if he and Dani had shared a moment at the musical rehearsal before he had been attacked. He thought that Dani might have been willing to give him a chance. Dani acknowledged that was true.\n\n\nTodd started to talk about the fight that he hadn't started, but Dani didn't want to discuss it. She explained that she had been rehearsing as Starr and had tried to understand more about herself. She thought maybe she had been too hard on Todd and had missed something like the reason to allow him into her life. Todd responded that he had only wanted a chance to be her father, but Dani replied that things were different with all that had happened. Todd assured her he hadn't attacked Marty.\n\n\nHe confirmed that he had been at the hospital and had an argument with Marty, but they had gone their separate ways and he had not pushed her. Dani reminded him that he had pushed a pregnant Starr down the stairs, but Todd quickly stated that Starr had forgiven him and it had been an accident. He was sure that Dani had felt something for him. Dani accused him of brainwashing Starr to love him. Todd stated that the witness had lied, and he wanted Dani to take a \"giant leap of faith.\" He knew she wanted to trust him. He assumed that was why she was there.\n\n\nHe continued to speak with great effort as he told her he was a different person than he had been before. Dani started to interrupt to argue the point, but Todd asked her if she was the same person as before. He emphasized that everyone changed and hopefully for the better. He was optimistic that everyone learned from their mistakes. He thought that Dani owed them a chance. Dani cried out that she couldn't help it, but she thought about Cole and Marty. She knew they were scared of Todd. He wanted to know if she was scared of him too. She replied honestly that she didn't know, but she couldn't be like Starr who always forgave him. Todd asked whether it was \"over before it starts.\"\n\n\nTodd thought that he had succeeded in getting to her and Dani was able to see the real Todd. He knew it was easy for her to hate him. He thought that T\u00e9a did a \"lousy job\" of raising Dani because Dani had no manners and ran hot and cold just like her mother. He was Dani's father, and that wouldn't change. He would be there if she ever needed him. Dani advised him not to wait for her.\n\n\nBlair found T\u00e9a virtually destroying an office when she walked in to see what the noise was. She asked what was wrong, but T\u00e9a insisted she was fine, had stopped to use the phone, and had lost her temper. She slid her medical file out of sight as she spoke. Blair figured that Todd was the reason T\u00e9a had lost her temper, and she suggested that T\u00e9a find a more reasonable way to show it next time. Blair admitted that she was upset about Todd, too, but she couldn't understand why T\u00e9a wanted to defend him. T\u00e9a expressed her feeling that Todd was innocent. She thought that all of their children needed a father.\n\n\nBlair was confused, since T\u00e9a had approached Blair in the beginning with the belief that Todd was guilty. T\u00e9a said she had to defend Todd for Dani, and he couldn't go to prison. Blair didn't think Todd should get away with the crime, since he always seemed to get out of his messes. She asked why T\u00e9a had to save him again. T\u00e9a clarified that she wanted to save Dani and she wanted her daughter to see that Todd really had a good side. Blair sniffed that he kept it hidden under a rock and Dani was better off without Todd.\n\n\nBlair pointed out that her children had grown up with Todd around them, but Dani could make a \"clean break.\" She suggested that T\u00e9a and Dani return to Tahiti because Dani would have a better life with just her mother. T\u00e9a inquired what would happen if she couldn't be there for Dani. Blair was reluctant to pay T\u00e9a a compliment, but she bit the bullet and admitted that T\u00e9a was a good mother and that Dani was lucky to have her.\n\n\nShe thought that T\u00e9a was irrational with her feelings for Todd and, before T\u00e9a could accuse her of the same, Blair noted that she herself had broken away. She thought that T\u00e9a should do the same. T\u00e9a was doubtful that she could and insisted that she needed Todd. She thought that life was unpredictable, and she didn't know if she'd be around. Blair called her \"tough as nails.\" T\u00e9a had something to say but then she hesitated.\n\n\nFinally, she stated that Dani needed to have someone around for her after everything with Ros, and T\u00e9a alone wasn't enough. She wouldn't be around forever, and she thought that Dani and Todd needed to connect with each other. She knew that he could be loving and devoted as a father. \"It is your funeral,\" Blair responded cynically, if T\u00e9a thought she needed to keep Todd out of jail.\n\n\nKaren arrived at Rodi's and sat down with Ford. She revealed that she had delivered a pizza to Markko, someone she had known since they were children. She urged Ford to give Markko a good grade, since Markko had worked hard and was stressed out. She thought it strange that Markko had mentioned something about keeping her secret regarding the Palace. The pair left the bar together, \"making out\" as they walked.\n\n\nNatalie topped Brody in a game of pool and revealed that she had met John over a game. Brody asked why she was at John's bar if she didn't want to talk to him. Natalie insisted that she knew John wouldn't be there and she had wanted to catch up with her brother. She instructed Brody on some finer points of the game as Brody asked how long she planned on staying angry at John. \"As long as it takes,\" she replied.\n\n\nShe changed the subject and asked if Brody was planning on taking a limo to the prom. They laughed about how funny it was that Brody and Jessica would be attending the prom at their ages. Hopeful that would strike a chord with Jessica, Brody planned to wear his dress whites. He had to get through to her and thought it might be his last chance. Natalie hoped that Jessica would remember everything else in her life if she remembered that she loved Brody.\n\n\nRex wandered over to Gigi as she tended bar and declared how lucky he was to have Bo in his life. He revealed that Bo and Nora were getting married. He and Gigi admired the fact that those two people had loved each other and found their way back to each other. Just then, a girl sitting at the bar asked Rex about his pregnant girlfriend. She ruined the good mood that Gigi and Rex had been enjoying, but Rex advised Gigi that he valued her support. Gigi thought it was important for Rex to locate his parents and Shane's grandparents. Just then, Rex received a phone call from one of the jewelers.\n\n\nRex told Gigi that a silversmith in Santa Fe had recognized the necklace. He would travel to that area to pursue the lead.\n\n\nKelly walked into the Palace restaurant and spied Reed sitting at a table, as he worked diligently on his laptop. She had a change of heart and turned and walked out.\n\n\nT\u00e9a walked to Todd's room and saw Dani running out of it. T\u00e9a broke down and sank to the floor.\n\n\nBlair walked back into the room she had been in previously with T\u00e9a. She picked up the phone to make a call but spotted T\u00e9a's medical folder. She looked at it curiously. \"Oh, my God, T\u00e9a's dying,\" she said, horrified.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After discovering the devastating news that she's going to die, T\u00e9a does now know what will become of Dani. Not knowing about her news, Blair tells her she needs to get over Todd and it might be better for Dani to be rid of him the way it's too late for her kids to be. T\u00e9a knows she does not have that choice yet doesn't know how to come out and tell Blair. Reed Wagner, a friend of Kelly's from Europe comes to see her. he seems to be very interested in her personal life. Dorian wants her niece to start seeing him but Kelly is less enthused. Langston finally confesses to Markko that she can't be with him and is in love with Ford. Little does she know, however, that Ford is sleeping with Karen and not committed to her. Gigi promises Rex she will be there for him while he looks for his real parents. Brody and Natalie are getting along really well, becoming friends and it looks like they might become more than friends in the future.",
