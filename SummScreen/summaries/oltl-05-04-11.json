Todd cracked that Viki and the Banner could go back to enjoying a third of the Sun's circulation, and Viki said she was glad to see time in a coma hadn't mellowed him.  He reminded her to be sure to name Tomas as the gunman in the pages of her paper, but Viki said she would wait on police evidence; she bid her brother goodbye.\n\n\nTurning to Starr, Todd asked for an update on current events.  Starr explained how the Manning clan had rallied around him, but Todd was more interested in what was going in her own life.  With a bit of reluctance, Starr recapped the Deanna situation -- James's ex-girlfriend was in Llanview.  \"What's she want?\" Todd asked.  \"Him, I think,\" Starr muttered.  \"What are you gonna do about it?\" Todd replied.\n\n\nTodd said there were ways to neutralize Deanna, and suggested the least \"invasive\" was to have her hire T\u00e9a as the attorney to help her find her birth mother.  It would keep Deanna close, but end her reliance on James.  Starr was touched by her father's magnanimous gesture on behalf of her new boyfriend, but Todd said he was feeling generous to the boy his daughter cared for, and told her not to get used to it.  In the worst case, he promised to have some of \"his associates\" escort Deanna out of Llanview.  Starr was glad to hear her old dad wasn't totally gone, and pecked his cheek.\n\n\nSuddenly, Todd's cell phone rang.  Noticing the caller ID, Todd promptly ignored it, and claimed he simply wanted to take a nap.  Starr hugged him and left, but Todd remained mysteriously preoccupied with his phone.\n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Echo was in the elevator, heading for Clint's room.  Speaking to Charlie on her phone, she said she was busy \"running errands.\"  She claimed to have been kept up the night before by caffeine, and lied that nothing was troubling her.  Flashing back to her confrontation with Niki over the recorder, she stepped off the elevator and quietly prayed that she wouldn't lose \"Chuckles\" over her incriminating secret.\n\n\nIn Clint's room, the Buchanan patriarch faced off with his doctor about his prognosis.  The doctor wanted to discuss the ramifications of Clint's unnamed condition, but Clint said no discussion was necessary; he knew what he needed to do.   Before they could talk further, Echo burst into the room, furious at Clint.\n\n\nDismissing his physician, Clint admitted to Echo that he had given Dorian his audio recording of their conversation.  He explained that he had taken Echo's advice and attempted to be a \"human being\" to spare Charlie's feelings, but once Clint had suffered his stroke, Dorian had held his life in her hands, and he had been forced to give up the recorder.  Echo was aghast at the thought that Dorian Lord, the most vindictive woman Echo knew, had been armed with evidence that could destroy Echo, and had handed it to Niki Smith.  Echo blamed Clint for the potential ruination of her rekindled romance.\n\n\nClint mentioned that Viki hadn't seemed upset when he saw her earlier, and Echo saw a chance -- perhaps Viki had no recollection of the recording, and Niki had disposed of it.  Echo still had time to find Viki and determine what, if anything, her rival knew; she still had a chance to be happy with Charlie, so long as Viki never heard the recording.  When Clint told her that Viki had been in the hospital to see Todd, Echo fled the scene, desperate to find Viki before it was too late.\n\n\nAfter leaving Todd's room, Viki ran into Dorian and her bodyguard in a nearby hospital corridor.  Viki assured Dorian that she was herself again, and Dorian was relieved to not have another unfortunate run-in with Niki.  Realizing that Viki didn't recall anything Dorian had discussed with Niki, Dorian explained that she had confessed to knowing about Charlie and Echo's affair for weeks.  Viki was shocked, but Dorian insisted she had kept mum to spare her former rival's feelings.\n\n\nRecovering from the shock, Viki admitted that she had known the moment Echo returned that her marriage was in deep trouble.  Charlie had gravitated to Echo, thanked to Clint's deception, which had tricked both Charlie and Echo.  Dorian quickly corrected her friend: \"Clint did not trick them both.\"  She explained that she had given Niki Smith a recording that proved her claim about Echo's role in Clint's cover-up, and asked if Viki still had it.  Viki wasn't sure, so Dorian promptly upended Viki's handbag, spilling its contents onto a medical tray until she discovered the audio recorder among them.\n\n\nTriumphant, Dorian played the recording back for Viki's stunned ears.  She recalled how Charlie had been so sure Echo was innocent, and Dorian had told Viki to play the recording back for Charlie so he could dump the countess for good.  \"Show Echo what kind of woman you really are,\" Dorian urged Viki.\n\n\nArmed with the recorder, Viki boarded the elevator as Echo ran down the corridor.  She pleaded for Viki to wait, and said she needed to speak to her rival.  \"About this?\" Viki asked, holding up the recorder as the elevator doors closed in Echo's face.\n\n\nDeflated, Echo turned to Dorian and asked where Viki was going.  \"Take a wild guess,\" Dorian replied, smirking.  Echo insisted she needed to talk to Viki, and said there had been a \"mistake.\"  Dorian told her that she and Viki could clear it up with Charlie, as that was where Viki was headed.\n\n\nBlanca Morales entered the Buenos Dias Cafe and instantly spotted Destiny sitting alone in one of the booths.  Hitting on an idea, she flipped open her phone and loudly pretended to be talking to her producer; she said that she was going to tell the world who had killed Eddie Ford, and since \"Ms. Evans\" hadn't called her back, she was going to have to go with her theory of Nora Buchanan being the culprit.  Upon hearing the news, Destiny sprang from her seat and insisted that Nora was innocent.\n\n\nBlanca reminded Destiny that she had promised to call, and suggested they work together and compare notes in order to find the real killer.  Even if they didn't learn the truth, Blanca said they would at least get to know each other -- after all, she was impressed with Destiny's moxie.  Charmed, Destiny sat down with the tabloid reporter and agreed to dish the dirt.\n\n\nBlanca couldn't understand why Bo and Nora had dropped the Ford case entirely after Clint had been released, and said she could only conclude that meant they were protecting someone.  She asked Destiny for the scoop; she knew the girl was tight with the Buchanans, especially Matthew, \"who you locked lips with.\"  Destiny insisted she and Matthew were just friends, and said their single kiss had only happened because he had been going through a rough time.  \n\n\nAs Blanca pressed for details, Destiny slowly unspooled the entire story about Clint's frame-up of Bo and Nora, and what Matthew had been led to walk in on between Bo and Inez, followed by his driving through the night.  As Destiny told what she knew of that night and Matthew's whereabouts, a picture began to form in Blanca's mind: Matthew Buchanan had killed Eddie Ford.\n\n\nBlanca told Destiny she intended to go on the air with her theory about Matthew as Eddie's murderer.  Horrified, Destiny said Matthew was no killer and begged her not to do it, but Blanca wouldn't be swayed.  \"You're a bigger gossip-mongerer than Phyllis Rose ever was!\" Destiny cried, but to Blanca that was only a compliment.  She smiled to herself as Destiny stormed out of the diner.\n\n\nOver at the Buchanans' garret apartment, Nora and Matthew reacted to the Access Llanview report they had just seen about Clint's heart attack.  They couldn't believe it was true, but Bo admitted it was, and said he had kept it from them because he didn't see how it was their problem anymore.  His family was stunned as Bo explained that after everything Clint had done to them, he couldn't consider the man family.  Despite everything, Matthew feared for Clint, and said that he knew what Clint had done, but his uncle had cared for him after the incident at the Minute Man Motel.  Bo begged to differ -- Clint had set Matthew up to kill Eddie Ford.  He couldn't forgive his brother for that, and he suggested Matthew shouldn't either.\n\n\nNora understood Bo's anger and said she shared much of it, but Matthew was still worried about his Uncle Clint.  Clint had done wrong, but nonetheless he was family who could be facing death.  Over Bo's objections, Matthew insisted on going to see Clint, and asked Bo if he was really capable of letting his brother die unforgiven.\n\n\nAs Matthew stormed off to his room, Nora told Bo he couldn't fool her; he could pretend not to \"give a damn\" about Clint, but she knew better.  She remembered his complicated relationship with Asa, and how Bo and Asa had loved each other despite everything his father had done to Bo.  Like it or not, Clint was a part of him, just like Asa.  Bo reminded Nora of everything Clint had done to her, to Matthew, and to their marriage, and insisted Clint wasn't his brother anymore.  \n\n\n\nNora recalled how Clint had visited Bo after his shooting the year before.  Clint had given up his anger and resentment against Bo and begged for his brother's life out of love.  Nora asked Bo if he could do any less with the tables turned. \nStruggling with his anger, Bo accompanied Nora to the hospital to see Clint.  She urged him on and told him he didn't have to punish Clint for what had happened with Matthew; they would find a way to protect their son.\n\n\nAs Bo entered Clint's room alone, Clint greeted his brother with surprise, wondering if Bo was a drug-induced hallucination.  Bo admitted he was surprised to be there, as well, and asked what the doctors had to say about Clint's prognosis.  \"They say I'm dying,\" Clint replied matter-of-factly.\n\n\nBack at the Buchanan garret, Matthew opened the front door to a hysterical Destiny and asked her what was wrong.  Sobbing, Destiny told him she was sorry, that she had made a terrible mistake.  \"Blanca Morales thinks you killed Eddie Ford!\" she cried.\n\n\nOver at the Salingers' apartment, Ford awoke in Inez's arms.  Inez wanted to call 9-1-1, but Ford refused to go to the hospital -- he had to find Tess before it was too late.  He couldn't stop his mother from calling the police, however, and within minutes, Brody was on their doorstep.  Brody was amused by Ford's pain and suffering and utterly unsurprised when Inez informed him that Tess had assaulted her new husband.  Ford explained that he had planned to have Tess committed to St. Anne's.  \"Finally,\" Brody remarked.\n\n\nInez pleaded with Brody to convince Ford to go to the hospital and get checked out.  After she retired for the night, Ford told Brody he had no idea where Tess had gone.  Brody warned Ford that he had no one to blame but himself for Tess's rampage; he had caused her return by choosing to exploit Jessica's DID for everything it was worth.  Ford had stolen Jessica's life from her and her children because of what he wanted.  Ford defended himself and insisted all he had wanted was a chance to raise his son.  He asked if Brody wouldn't go to any lengths to fight for Liam if John had attempted to lay claim to Brody's son.\n\n\nOver at the Minute Man Motel, Tess burst in on Cutter.  She told him she was in trouble and needed his help; she was sure she had killed Ford.  She explained that her erstwhile husband had cut a deal with Joey and Aubrey to re-commit her in exchange for access to Ryder, and she had no choice but to stop him.  \"And all Aubrey cares about is what Joey cares about,\" Cutter growled.  Tess wished she had nailed Aubrey and exposed the Wentworths' secret in open court when she had the chance.  Cutter said Aubrey wasn't his problem anymore -- he was focused on Tess, and getting her out of her dangerous situation.\n\n\nTess was suddenly galvanized by guilt over what she had done to Ford, fearing for both him and Ryder despite herself.  Before Cutter could stop her, she called Ford's phone and was stunned when her very put-out husband answered.  Snarling and calling her a bitch, Ford demanded to know where Tess was.  Upon hearing Brody's voice in the background, Tess hit the roof and immediately hung up on Ford.\n\n\nTess raged to Cutter that Ford had called the cops on her, and impulsively pulled her latest lover onto the bed.  She told Cutter that everyone was in on it together to take them down -- Joey, Aubrey, and Ford.  \"We got screwed, Cutter,\" Tess purred, sliding into his arms, \"so let's give 'em a taste of their own medicine.\"  Cutter was tempted, but quickly cut their makeout session short.  He told Tess he wasn't going to turn her in -- he had a better idea.\n\n\nBack at the Salinger apartment, Ford was furious that Tess had hung up on him.  He spouted off about how at risk she was, as Tess's drinking and carousing could inflame Jessica's hepatitis C.  \"Unbelievable,\" Brody said with a sigh, and added, \"You're falling for her.\"  Ford insisted he wasn't, and pleaded for more time on his decision to send Tess to St. Anne's.  He couldn't trust Aubrey and Joey to give him Ryder with Tess gone, and promised to decide after they found his wife.  Fed up, Brody said he was heading to Cutter Wentworth's motel to find the lovebirds, and Ford insisted on going along for the ride.\n\n\nSpeeding across Llanview, Brody and Ford soon arrived at the Minute Man Motel.  Brody pounded on Cutter's door, and the men called out to Cutter and Tess, but got no answer.  Brody kicked in the door, and he and Ford burst into Cutter's motel room.\n\n\nBack at Llanview Hospital, Todd wasn't sleeping as he had promised Starr he would; instead, he was reading the Sun.  Receiving another mysterious phone call, Todd answered it.  He told the caller that he hadn't been able to speak before as his daughter had been in the room, and asked the voice on the other end of the line what it wanted. \n\n\n",
