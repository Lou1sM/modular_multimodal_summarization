    "soap_central": "\n\nAs friends and family watch Michael and Marcie's wedding ceremony, Natalie realizes that Cristian's sketch portrays none other than David Vickers.  Shocked, she stands up at the most inopportune moment: just as the reverend asks if anyone has a reason why Michael and Marcie should not be married!  Natalie covers for herself, but then walks over to Evangeline and drags her out of the ceremony.  Evangeline is annoyed with Natalie's selfishness, but Nat lets her know that this is big business: she knows who shot John's father!  Van is shocked, and she and Natalie debate whether to tell John right away.  Meanwhile, Cristian has followed them out of the ceremony and demands to know what they are discussing.  Within moments, all three of them are sharing the secret of David Vickers's dirty deed.\n\n\nMeanwhile, David is in a Thailand jail, trying to talk some sense into Margaret Cochran.  Margaret appears to have lost her memory of everything that happened from the moment she was fired from Buchanan Enterprises.  She does not recall terrorizing Todd Manning, nor does she recognize the name Spencer Truman.  Worst of all, Margaret does not remember giving birth to a baby boy!  David mentions her son, and Margaret seems to be pained by a flashback.  She tells him that she had a dream in which she gave birth, and when David tells her the details of the warehouse, including Spencer and Paige as the team that helped her give birth, Margaret admits that this information mirrors her dream.  However, she doesn't think it's possible that she has a baby boy.  David finally persuades her to drop the charges against him so that he can be released from jail and help her find her son.  Margaret agrees to drop the charges, but she still insists that she's never had a child.  When David is released from his cell, he takes a picture of himself hugging Margaret and immediately sends it to Spencer via his cell phone.\n\n\nBack at St. Jude's, Michael and Marcie share tender, heartfelt wedding vows just before the storm causes the electricity to go out.  Marcie starts to panic, but Michael immediately comforts her by saying that Irish tradition calls for a happy marriage in the wake of a storm.  The guests light candles, and the two of them are pronounced husband and wife by candlelight.  Lindsay looks on lovingly, serving as the matron of honor in place of dearly departed Jen.  After the ceremony, as the guests mill about waiting for the reception, the storm continues to rage.  Blair tells Spencer that this whole wedding is causing her painful memories of Todd and that she's not going to stick around to party.  She leaves, and Spencer muses aloud that Todd's execution \"can't come soon enough.\"  The doctor squirms when he receives the picture of David and Margaret and realizes that his brother now knows a big part of his secret.\n\n\nAdriana reveals to Rex that her stalker has been sending her text messages throughout the ceremony.  Rex wants to protect her, and he feels that the stalker is in the church because of the nature of the messages, one of which refers to Adriana's necklace.  Rex takes her away from the church to the basement of his apartment building.  The storm continues to rage, and when the power goes out, Rex leaves Adriana unattended so that he can go fight with the fuse box.  As she stands alone, someone walks up behind her ... is it the stalker?\n\n\nIn the wake of the ceremony, John wants to know why Evangeline and Natalie walked out right before the vows.  They are forced to tell him the truth: that David Vickers killed his brother.  \"I'm going to kill him,\" John shouts, and begins to storm out of the church.  At this point, John, Cristian, Natalie and Evangeline are the only people left in the main part of the church.  Suddenly, John stops and looks around, realizing that the tornado is about to hit in full force.  The other three seem to sense danger at the same time, just as John screams \"Everybody get down!\"  The whole side wall of the church explodes as the tornado slams into Llanview.  Church pews fly everywhere, and part of the roof caves in.  Evangeline is attacked by glass from a broken window, which she tries to keep out of her face to no avail.\n\n\nAcross town at the hospital, Antonio and Nash look at the sleeping baby as they wait to find out who is the father.  Nash says that he can't wait to know for certain so that the two men can stop doing this war dance.  Tess arrives on the scene, ready to take her daughter home.  Antonio points out that the baby is sleeping and that she shouldn't remove her from the hospital.  Tess becomes angry, reminding Antonio that she is the mother and that she is the one with the equipment to feed the child.  Antonio says that he has rights too, assuming he is the father.  Tess practically spits in his face as she says that Jessica gave up all rights to the child when she allowed Tess to carry her to term.  Antonio storms out, leaving Tess and Nash alone.  Nash tries to comfort Tess, who says that she will disappear forever if Antonio ends up being this child's father.  Nash reminds Tess that she never thought anyone could fall in love with her, and that perhaps the odds of life are turning in her favor.  Before they can take the baby, Antonio arrives back at the hospital with a court order.  He explained to the District Attorney that Tess is mentally ill, and he was able to procure an order (in night court) stating that the baby must remain in the hospital until her paternity is proven.  Tess glares at Antonio with the fury of one thousand suns.\n\n\nKevin and Kelly have the biggest fight in the history of their on again, off again relationship, resulting in them missing Michael and Marcie's entire wedding.  Kevin wants to break off their engagement, feeling powerless because he can't give Kelly a child.  Kelly reminds him that they have been very good together until recently, which causes Kevin to explode: \"You mean until I found out that I have a low sperm count and that my son's in love with you,\" he shouts.  Kelly makes the mistake of saying that Duke doesn't know what he's doing, which causes Kevin to erupt in an utter fury.  He screams that of course Duke knows what he's doing, and then he accuses Kelly of liking the attention.  She says that she hasn't received very much positive attention from Kevin lately.  Kevin goes off on a vicious rant, letting off steam from months of pent up anger.  He tells Kelly that everyone thinks she's perfect and that it's such a shame that she can't have a child, but that the two of them know better.  He reminds her that she was a mess with Ace, and he goes so far as to say that maybe God is raining judgment down on them ... that maybe Kelly can't have a baby with him, because she would make a horrible mother.  \"That's the cruelest thing you've ever said to me,\" Kelly stammers through her tears.  Kevin tells Kelly that Duke is ready and willing to give her a child, so maybe she should go have a baby with him.  Kelly is hysterical by this time, and she demands to know whether Kevin is trying to make her hate him.  Kevin wants to know if she hates him, and she says, \"At this moment, Kevin, yes I do.\"  Kevin demands the engagement ring back, and when Kelly refuses, he grabs it off her hand, forcing her to the floor and ignoring her cries of pain.  He storms out, leaving Kelly a heaving mess of sobs.  Meanwhile, Duke has been concerned that Kevin and Kelly never arrived for the wedding, and he takes of looking for them.  He finds Kelly alone in the rectory, and he asks what Kevin did.  She says that she doesn't want to talk about it, but ends up breaking down when Duke asks her how long it's been since Kevin has held her, or been gentle with her in any way.  Suddenly, Duke pulls Kelly into a passionate kiss and she responds ... as the storm rages outside.\n\n\n",
