Talia proclaimed her love to Antonio. John, Antonio, and Talia discussed the fact that they had done everything possible to trick Ramsey into believing John and Talia were involved and that Antonio had stolen money that was supposed to be inventoried in connection to a drug bust. John and Antonio were confident that they would uncover Ramsey's wrongdoings and help Bo get reinstated as police commissioner. \n\n\nWhen Antonio asked John what they should do next, John informed Antonio and Talia that they would have to handle Ramsey on their own for a while because he had to search for Starr and Cole. John stated that he had booked Antonio and Talia a room at a local motel and encouraged them to enjoy their long-overdue night together. John said that he had booked the room under his name in case Eddie was on their trail. \n\n\nAfter Antonio and Talia headed off, John placed a call to Nora. He thanked her for the information on Cole's car and asked her to keep an eye on Todd while he was away. John said that if Todd stayed out of the way, everyone would return safely, but if Todd interfered as expected -- all bets were off. John took off in the boat in search of Starr and Cole. \n\n\nOutside of Antonio and Talia's motel room, Eddie stood by the door. When Talia placed a \"do not disturb\" sign on the doorknob, Eddie called Ramsey and informed the commissioner that Talia was inside the room with John. Eddie then left the motel. Meanwhile, Antonio and Talia expressed their love for each other and enjoyed their time together. After they made love, Talia told Antonio that he needed to get the goods on Ramsey quickly because she didn't know how long she could stay away from Antonio. Antonio responded by telling Talia that she didn't have to wait any longer, and he smothered her with kisses. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, an angry Blair slapped Todd and expressed her displeasure with his recent actions. Todd felt he had done everything right concerning his treatment of Starr and Cole, but Blair believed otherwise. Blair reminded Todd of how he had kept Starr isolated from her friends and caused her to run away to escape his rule over her. Blair told Todd that he believed he could treat people any way he pleased because he had been hurt but stated that he was not alone -- everyone had experienced hurt in their lives. \n\n\nBlair stated that she and Todd had been similar when they had first met, but she had changed after having the children. Blair had believed that Todd had changed after finding Sam, but she had since realized that he was still the same old Todd. Blair tried to convince Todd that his bullying tactics would only force Starr to stay away forever. Todd continued to defend his actions, and criticized Blair for running to John for help. Blair told Todd that she was going to call John and ask him to continue his search for Starr -- and planned to tell John that he had Todd's full support. A speechless Todd watched as Blair stormed out of the room. \n\n\nMeanwhile upstairs, Markko told Dorian that Langston was pregnant. Shocked, Dorian asked Langston if it were true. Surprised by Markko's sudden \"revelation,\" Langston hesitated and then in a faint voice told Dorian that she was pregnant. Upon hearing that Langston was pregnant, Dorian warned Markko to run and then threw a book at him. Dorian attempted to attack Markko several times and accused him of ruining Langston's life. \n\n\nDorian told Langston that she was surprised that Langston would get herself in such a situation; she didn't expect that behavior from a Cramer woman. Frustrated by Dorian's attack on her and Markko, Langston informed Dorian that she didn't care to be a Cramer woman. Langston mentioned how she had been told that the Cramer women always supported each other. Langston reminded Dorian that Dorian and Blair had allowed Todd to lock Starr away in Dorian's own home, and Dorian hadn't tried to intervene. \n\n\nRealizing that Dorian was feeling guilty, Langston revealed that she had attempted to contact Dorian several times in the few weeks prior and had never been able to reach her. Langston stated that perhaps she and Starr were the only true Cramer women left, since they did everything possible to support each other. Consumed with guilt, Dorian apologized for not being there for Langston and Starr during their time of need. Dorian hugged Langston and assured her that they would handle the situation together. \n\n\nCole asked Starr if she blamed him for the pregnancy. Cole became alarmed when Starr confided that she did blame him to some extent, but Starr also accepted guilt. She told Cole that she hated to use the word blame because she didn't feel that they had done anything wrong by making love. Starr admitted that she wished she weren't pregnant, but she had meant every word that she had said to Cole the night they had shared together. Starr said that she didn't regret having sex with Cole but wished they had discussed using a condom. Cole appeared somewhat bothered by her statement but agreed to support her. \n\n\nCole told Starr that if she decided to have an abortion, he would drive her to the clinic. Starr thanked Cole for being a great support system for her. Cole said that he had never thought he would be happy after losing his mother, but that night with Starr had made him realize that he would do anything for her. Touched by Cole's words, Starr asked Cole if she could fall asleep in his arms. As Cole ran his fingers through her hair, Starr tried to fall asleep but looked troubled. Later, Cole asked Starr if she were asleep, but she said nothing although her eyes were wide open. \n\n\nAfter responding to Natalie's kiss, a surprised Jared questioned whether it was a kiss goodbye. Natalie shocked Jared by telling him that she was in love with him. An elated Jared expressed his love for Natalie and stated that he had wanted to be a Buchanan for a long time, but he realized that all he really needed was her. When Natalie informed Jared that they could never be together, Jared was dumbfounded. \n\n\nNatalie reminded Jared that he could never reveal his true identity or else he and possibly Nigel would go to prison. While Jared continued to protest, Natalie mentioned how they could never take the relationship anywhere because the family could never learn the truth about Jared's scam. Frustrated, Jared begged Natalie to forget all their problems and relive the night they had fallen in love at the ranch. Natalie agreed to put their problems aside for the night, and the two made love. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "We see many couples together when it looked like they were through. Natalie and Jared sleep together and she reveals she wants to be with him even though she previously vowed it was over and she'd never forgive him for what he did. Antonio and Talia are seen together and reveal that they were only scamming Ramsey into believing they'd broken up and she was now seeing John. Starr and Cole are together away from everybody and everything. But they admit that they might not be able to go through with having a baby together. Blair admits to Todd that she blames him for what happened. He argues and wants to do everything his way.",
