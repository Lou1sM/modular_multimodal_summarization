Nora and Matthew warned him not to overdo it, and said it was important he took his recovery one day at a time.  As Bo and Nora bickered over his outpatient care, Matthew answered a knock at the door and retrieved a package from Rex, to Bo - a bottle of \"Old Philly\" scotch, along with a card thanking Bo for saving Rex's life.  Bo downplayed his heroism, but his loved ones were exceedingly proud of him.\n\n\nMatthew noted that Bo and Rex were like father and son, and told Bo he didn't have a problem with that; after all, his dad was the best around.  Nora began to cluck over Bo.  She added blankets to his spot on the couch and ordered him not to overexert himself.  She informed him that she wanted him back in marrying shape in time for their wedding.  Enjoying a stolen moment of domesticity with her family, Nora wished she could stay, but she had to head for the courthouse, and Cole's plea bargain hearing.  She admitted that she wished it were Todd she was prosecuting instead.\n\n\nMatthew asked Nora if he'd have to testify under oath about Cole's attack on Todd, and Nora said she doubted Cole's case would go to trial; in the event it did, all Matthew needed to do was tell the truth.  But the truth was what worried Matthew, as he recalled how Cole had brutally beaten Todd within an inch of his life.\n\n\nAfter Nora left for court, Bo stopped Matthew on his way to school, and asked for an update on the Danielle situation.  Matthew explained that Danielle hadn't gotten back to him; she'd been avoiding him ever since Cole and Todd's confrontation.  Bo told him not to worry, and to let Danielle meet him halfway.  Matthew resolved to head to school early, in the hopes of catching her before class.  He asked his father what he'd do with the rest of his day, and Bo said he'd be planning his wedding.\n\n\nAfter Matthew left, Bo stared longingly at his and Nora's old wedding photo, with them standing before Little Richard at the altar.  Remembering the good old days, Bo mused aloud about how their first nuptials would be a hard act to follow.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair re-read her copy of T\u00e9a's fatal diagnosis, but was caught off guard when Elijah entered the drawing room.  Blair attempted to cover, but Elijah sensed she was hiding something and playfully snatched the paper from her hands.  His smile faded as he read the file on T\u00e9a's brain tumor.\n\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" Elijah murmured, stunned at the news, and asked Blair when T\u00e9a had told her.  Blair admitted that no one had given her the news, and she'd happened to see the file in Greg's office after her run-in with T\u00e9a.  Elijah chastised her for copying the file and violating doctor-patient confidentiality, but Blair said she'd had to know what was eating at her longtime rival.  Growing emotional, she admitted that T\u00e9a was a good mother, and recalled with shame the hurtful things she'd said to T\u00e9a, how she'd spoken about life and death and parental responsibility.  She hadn't understood T\u00e9a's cryptic response then, but after reading the file, she understood all too well - Danielle was liable to lose both parents.\n\n\nElijah took Blair into his arms and held her as she wept.  He wanted to go to T\u00e9a, but Blair asked him not to; she wanted more time to face T\u00e9a on her own, in case neither Todd nor Danielle knew.  Elijah reluctantly agreed, and prepared to leave for Cole's court hearing.  Before he left, he comforted Blair, and promised her they'd work things out.  After Elijah exited, Blair sat down, staring at T\u00e9a's file.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Greg spotted T\u00e9a dining alone, examining her latest diagnosis.  Before he could approach her, Destiny walked up, ready for another brother-sister breakfast.  As they headed for their table, Destiny asked why they were having another family meeting, and deduced that he was worried that she was traumatized by Cole's assault on Todd.  Greg told Destiny he didn't like her being a witness to such brutality, but Destiny said that though it'd been frightening, it was far worse for Starr and Danielle, Todd's daughters.  She concluded that she and Greg were lucky, as they'd been raised by two wonderful parents.\n\n\nOver at T\u00e9a's table, Danielle arrived, seething in silence.  T\u00e9a began by saying she had something to tell her daughter, but Danielle cut her off.  She was sure T\u00e9a was going to justify her defense of Todd, and her mother's weakness for a man who Danielle felt was wholly evil disgusted her.  Danielle's temper raged out of control as she ranted at T\u00e9a about her vulnerability for a rapist and abuser of women.  T\u00e9a attempted to get a word in edgewise, insisting that no one was totally good or bad and Todd's case was not black and white. Danielle vehemently disagreed, and challenged T\u00e9a to admit she was only giving Todd the benefit of the doubt about Marty because of how she felt about him.\n\n\nAs the family quarrel intensified, Destiny picked that moment to walk up to T\u00e9a and Danielle's table and say hello.  Destiny told Danielle she was sorry about Todd's injuries, but Danielle said she wasn't - she didn't have a father, and wanted nothing to do with Todd ever again.  Castigating T\u00e9a for coddling and excusing Todd at every stage of his life, she stormed off with Destiny. The girls headed for school before Greg could break up the fight.  T\u00e9a watched helplessly as the girls walked out, calling after them, \"Dani, I love you!\"\n\n\nGreg took a seat beside T\u00e9a as she regained her bearings, and explained that she hadn't gotten a chance to tell Danielle about her illness.  Greg suggested she get a second opinion, but T\u00e9a held up her new file and said she already had.  It confirmed what Greg already knew - \"I'm dying.\"  T\u00e9a promised to set up another appointment, but asked Greg to keep the truth quiet for a while longer.  Greg agreed and said goodbye, leaving T\u00e9a to stare at her diagnosis.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a prepared to leave the Palace, she got a call from Blair, who asked her to stop by La Boulaie.  Blair insisted it wasn't about Todd, but they needed to talk, in private and not over the phone.  T\u00e9a reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rex and Gigi filled Shane in on Rex's trip to New Mexico, and explained that he was searching for \"a client's\" birth parents.  Rex beat around the bush, but Shane quickly surmised from other talk he'd overheard that Rex was, in fact, searching for his own blood relations.  Rex said he needed to know the truth, but he'd always be Shane's dad.  Gritting their teeth, Rex and Gigi unspooled the whole sordid story of Mitch and Alison, and explained the part about Rex being switched at birth.\n\n\nAfter hearing the tall tale, Shane asked his parents what the news meant for Roxy's place in their lives - she wasn't really his grandmother, but he wondered if she would still be around.  Roxy sauntered into the restaurant just in time to overhear the discussion, and melted as she heard Rex tell Shane that Roxy would always be his \"real grandma,\" no matter what biology said.  Overjoyed, Roxy rushed over to the Balsoms' table and clutched Shane to her breast, and promising to be there for her grandson forever.\n\n\nRoxy joined the family circle as Rex discussed his traveling plans; he was going to Santa Fe in order to track down the local artist who'd created the two-part necklace found among his personal effects, in the hopes of tracking down whoever had the other half of the locket.  Gigi chimed in by asking Roxy if she could watch Shane for a few days, as Gigi intended to accompany Rex to New Mexico.  She quickly reversed herself, apologizing for being presumptuous about the status of their relationship, but Shane and Roxy were all for it, and Rex agreed: Together or not, he wanted Gigi to go with him.  Gigi promised to finish packing before him, and the exes raced out of the restaurant.\n\n\nAfter the lovebirds left, Roxy and Shane put their heads together.  Shane asked Roxy if his parents would ever reunite, and Roxy said she wasn't sure, but it was a pretty good bet.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, John and Marty waited outside the courtroom for Cole's plea bargain hearing to begin.  Marty couldn't believe Cole had totally lost control with Todd, but John said Manning had a habit of making people go beyond their limits.  Marty disagreed, and blamed herself; it was her fault for bringing her family back to Llanview, and setting events into motion.  Years later, Cole was still paying for her mistakes.  John told her that all she'd done was fall down the stairs - it was a crime, and he promised Todd would go to prison for it.\n\n\nCole arrived in handcuffs, and John got the guard to unshackle him.  Marty embraced her son, and Cole said he'd made it through the night in jail thanks to the family picture Starr had left behind.  Gazing into the courtroom, he noticed Starr wasn't there.  Marty was sure Starr was delayed in traffic and would be there.  \"Yeah, probably,\" Cole said doubtfully.\n\n\nMarty asked Cole why he thought Starr wouldn't be at the hearing, and Cole said it was obvious she'd chosen Todd over him once and for all.  He explained that Starr thought Hannah was lying about seeing Todd, in hopes of breaking Starr and Cole up.  Listening in, John grew curious, and asked Cole if there was any possibility Starr could be right.  Marty and Cole lashed out at him, and said there was no reason for Hannah to lie.  Entering the courtroom, Nora agreed, and promised to do her best to keep Cole from landing any prison time.\n\n\nElijah's legal associate, Phillip Shaw, arrived to represent Cole in Elijah's stead, and took Nora aside to discuss the plea bargain agreement.  He believed they could get the lenient plea past the judge, but Nora wasn't so sure given the severity of Todd's injuries.\n\n\nThe judge entered the courtroom and the plea hearing went into session, with both Shaw and Nora arguing on Cole's behalf for the plea bargain agreement.  The judge examined the agreement, but told the lawyers that given Todd's brutal beating, he had no intention of allowing Cole to walk without jail time.\n\n\nArriving at Llanview High, Danielle made a beeline for the gymnasium.  Destiny pleaded with her to avoid the dark memories inside, but Danielle ignored her and entered the gym.  As Destiny dithered in the corridor, Matthew arrived, asking after Danielle.  Destiny directed him to the gym, and congratulated him on Bo's homecoming.  She watched with pained longing as Matthew retraced Danielle's steps.\n\n\nInside the gym, Danielle huddled on the bleachers with a grim look on her face.  Matthew walked over to her and put his hand on her shoulder, and asked her why she was by herself.  Danielle said Destiny had warned her, and she was right; all the memories of the attack were flooding back.  Walking over to the stage steps, she brushed off Matthew's concerned inquiries about her emotional state.  Turning on him, she told him not to worry - Todd Manning was dead to her, and her mother would be, as well, if she persisted in defending him.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, T\u00e9a arrived to see Blair.  She thought Blair was going to read her the riot act about Todd's defense, but the crestfallen Blair produced the copy of T\u00e9a's file and said her concern had nothing to do with Todd.  It was all about T\u00e9a, and what they both knew was happening to her.  As Blair held out the file, T\u00e9a's eyes grew sharp with the realization that her secret was out. \n\n\n",
