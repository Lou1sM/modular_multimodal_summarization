    "soap_central": "\n\nStarr walked up to James's apartment door to hear James and Deanna laughing at the blasting television. She knocked on the door, but decided to go in when no one answered. \"Am I interrupting something?\" she asked. Starr had thought that Deanna was staying at La Boulaie. Deanna explained that she felt like she was imposing because Starr was always at the hospital.\n\n\nWhen Deanna said that she had been making calls about jobs, Starr was hopeful that Deanna would find her own place. However, Deanna needed money for the lawyer in Dayton first. Starr suggested that Deanna use T\u00e9a, because she would help Deanna for free. Deanna replied that the lawyer in Dayton was the only one who had the information that she needed. James added that T\u00e9a had her hands full with Todd's issues anyway.\n\n\nDeanna's phone rang, and she left to answer it. James complimented Starr's good idea, but Starr wondered why he'd shot it down if it was such a good idea. Deanna returned and said that the people at the Italian restaurant were hiring, and wanted to see her right away. She excitedly ran out the door. \"At least she's trying,\" James stated.\n\n\nJames promised that Deanna wouldn't be a problem. \"She already is!\" Starr cried. She continued that they never had any privacy. She was worried because their relationship was so new. They hadn't even been on a real date, and their entire relationship had revolved around helping others. Their only real night together had been the night they'd spent with Nate and Dani. Starr wondered how they would be able to spend time together while Deanna was there. \"She's not here now,\" James said, and kissed her.\n\n\nBo asked Clint how he was doing. Clint replied that he was dying, but the doctors hadn't given him a timeframe. Clint wondered why Bo wouldn't say that it served Clint right. Bo was surprised that Clint would think the news would make Bo happy. Clint said that, with him gone, no one would ever know that Matthew had killed Eddie.\n\n\nBo wondered how Clint could ever live with himself after all he'd done, including setting Matthew up to kill Eddie. As the two began to argue, Clint started coughing. Bo got his brother water, and said that they would never have to talk about Eddie again. Bo informed Clint that, when Bo had found out that Clint was in the hospital, he hadn't even told his family. Bo wondered if Clint even had a heart. He continued that he hadn't even wanted to visit Clint, but Nora had thought that Bo had to because Clint was his brother.\n\n\nBo hadn't wanted Clint in the hospital, or to even be fighting with Clint. He wanted a brother that he could trust and depend on. \"I could say the same thing,\" Clint replied. As Bo turned to leave, Clint asked for a favor from Bo. Clint didn't want his family to know that he was dying, because they had enough going on. They couldn't do anything about it, and he had caused enough pain anyway. Bo related that it was the first he'd heard Clint worry about someone else in a long time. \"Too bad it's too late,\" he added.\n\n\nBo didn't want to keep secrets from his family. Clint didn't want Bo to tell \"the kids\" or Viki, but Bo thought that they deserved to know. Bo said that Clint should tell them himself. Clint told Bo that Bo won, and Bo left the room.\n\n\nMatthew opened his door to an upset, apologizing Destiny. Destiny explained how the reporter Blanca thought that Matthew could have killed Eddie. Destiny had tried to discourage the woman, but she wouldn't listen. Destiny suggested that Matthew could sue for slander. Matthew replied that no lawsuit was necessary if it was true. Matthew confessed to a confused Destiny that he'd been the one to kill Eddie.\n\n\nMatthew didn't think much of himself because he'd been ready to let Nate take the fall for him. Destiny reasoned that, although Eddie hadn't threatened Matthew, he'd provoked Matthew. She rationalized that he'd just seen Bo with Inez, and Eddie had kidnapped Nora, so Matthew had snapped. Matthew thought he was a coward for not telling anyone, but Destiny assured him that he was just a kid, and a scared one at that.\n\n\nMatthew said that his parents had just found out. He chided himself for being the son of the district attorney and the commissioner of police, and a murderer at the same time. He informed her that only Destiny, Bo, and Nora knew. Destiny said he should have told her, because she was his friend. She expressed her sorrow that he had been alone, and promised that she wouldn't tell anyone. She promised that she would never leave him, and the two shared a kiss.\n\n\nDestiny pulled away and apologized. She picked up her bag and walked toward the door. Matthew reminded her that she had said she wouldn't leave. She promised to always be his friend. \"Then why don't you stay?\" he suggested. He held out his hand to her, and she took it. He led her to his bedroom.\n\n\nBrody pounded on Cutter's motel room door. When no one answered, Brody kicked the door in. Brody and Ford entered the empty room and looked around, finding no one. Tess entered with Cutter, and said that they'd been expecting the two men. Tess wondered why there weren't orderlies to take her to St. Anne's, but Ford confessed that he hadn't called. He'd wanted to find Tess first.\n\n\nRight in front of Tess however, Ford took out the commitment papers and signed them, promising to call immediately. As Brody called Dr. Levin, Tess was angry at Ford for wanting to have her committed. \"You could have killed me!\" he reminded her. Tess informed the men that they were wasting their time, because she had papers of her own. Tess showed Ford proof that she'd had their marriage annulled. Brody reminded her that Viki and Clint would have no power to have her committed. Tess informed Brody that she had gotten married to Cutter.\n\n\nBrody angrily demanded to know what Cutter got out of the marriage. Cutter sarcastically claimed to love Tess. Tess informed Brody that Jessica was never going to return. She wanted to kick Brody and Ford out because she and Cutter had \"celebrating to do.\" Brody said that, if he weren't a cop, he would punch Cutter out. \"Allow me,\" Ford said, and knocked Cutter to the floor, to Brody's amusement.\n\n\nCutter got up and told Brody to arrest Ford for assault. \"I didn't see anything,\" Brody claimed. The two men left, and Tess got Cutter some ice. They related that Tess got her freedom, and Cutter would get the Buchanan money. \"Do you want to break the news to your sister, or should I?\" Tess asked.\n\n\nOutside the room, Ford told Brody that \"I want in\" on whatever Brody was planning to do to get Jessica back. Brody was confused as to why. Brody related that he loved Jessica. However, Ford had married Tess to use her, so they hadn't even had anything real.\n\n\nEcho instructed Dorian to get out of her way, or she would run Dorian over. Dorian said that Echo wouldn't reach Charlie in time to stop Viki from playing the recording for him. Echo claimed not to know what recording Dorian meant, so Dorian elaborated. Echo wondered how it was any of Dorian's business.\n\n\nDorian said that Echo and Charlie would not live happily ever after. Echo warned Dorian not to mess with her, and wondered if Dorian had told Viki about Dorian blackmailing Clint in order to get the recording. Dorian reasoned that Clint was alive, so there had been no harm done. Dorian told Echo to go to Charlie, because Viki had probably already delivered the news.\n\n\nCharlie was stunned to open Echo's motel room door to Viki. He invited Viki in, and said that he'd heard about the custody hearing. He asked if she was all right after having her alters wreak havoc. Charlie related that it must have been Niki who'd seen Echo earlier, and that Echo probably had no idea. Viki countered that she was sure Echo had known that it was Niki. Charlie defended Echo, and said that she wouldn't lie. \"She must have shown Echo something she didn't want you to know about,\" Viki stated about Niki, and showed Charlie the recorder.\n\n\nViki wouldn't play the recording for Charlie. She didn't want to hurt him, even though she believed that he deserved to know the truth. She informed Charlie that it would show him \"who Echo really is.\" Viki continued that she'd tried to warn Charlie, but he hadn't wanted to listen. It was no longer her job to protect him, so she left the recorder with Charlie, telling him to do with it what he wanted. Charlie hit the play button. Echo entered as she heard her voice on the recording. \"How could you do this to me?\" Echo screamed at Viki as Viki walked away. Charlie closed the door solemnly, and kept listening.\n\n\nEcho tried to explain away what Charlie was listening to, but he knew that it was her voice. Echo claimed to have been tricked, because she hadn't known that Clint had been recording the conversation. Charlie was astonished that Echo had known about Rex not being his son. Echo promised that she could explain if Charlie would give her a chance to.\n\n\nEcho swore on her life that she had never meant to lie to Charlie. She filled Charlie in about how she'd told Clint about Rex being his son, but he'd already known. She told how Clint had threatened to send Rex to jail if Echo told anyone about Rex's true paternity. She claimed to have no choice in the matter, and said that she wished Charlie had turned out to be Rex's father. She'd done anything she could for her son, and knew that Charlie would do the same. \"I don't have a son!\" he yelled at her.\n\n\nEcho offered to go to counseling, or do anything that Charlie wanted her to do in exchange for forgiveness. Charlie screamed that she'd used him and his addiction to worm her way into his life. He regretted turning to Echo when he'd found out about Clint being Rex's father, because the whole thing was her fault in the first place.\n\n\nCharlie remembered how Viki and Dorian had warned him about Echo. He'd trusted Echo because she'd convinced him that they understood each other. Charlie blamed Echo for destroying his home and his marriage. He accused the \"lying, cheating, manipulative\" woman of taking away his reason to stay sober. He called her \"morally bankrupt,\" and called himself stupid for believing her.\n\n\nEcho reminded Charlie that they loved each other, and begged him for forgiveness. Charlie told her that he wouldn't forgive her, and that they were over. He never wanted to see her again. A short while later, Charlie had his bags packed, and he was ready to walk out the door. Echo tried to stop him from leaving, but he told her that she was the worst mistake he'd ever made, and walked out the door.\n\n\nEcho yelled and begged him to stay, hysterically crying. Wiping away tears, she blamed everything on Dorian and Viki. She vowed to make the two women pay.\n\n\nViki arrived at the hospital, and Dorian wanted to know what had happened. Viki admitted that Charlie had heard what he'd needed to, but Viki had gotten no pleasure out of it. However, she had enjoyed the look on Echo's face when Echo had entered the room. Viki confided that she'd left \"before the fireworks.\" Dorian advised Viki that Charlie would want to return to Viki. Viki admitted that she hadn't even thought of anything that could happen past playing the recording for Charlie.\n\n\nDorian asked if Viki would want Charlie back. Viki loved him, but didn't know. Viki admitted that something had to have been wrong in the marriage in order for Charlie to turn to Echo, have an affair with her, and then lie about it. Dorian assured her that there was something wrong in every marriage, \"even mine and David's.\"\n\n\nViki didn't think that her marriage could be fixed. Dorian asked if things were over, but Viki wished it were that simple. Dorian related that they had a big problem in Echo, because she would be a dangerous enemy. Dorian said that, if she was a betting woman, \"and I am,\" she would put her money on herself and Viki against Echo. As the two women walked out of the hospital, Dorian said that they'd won the first round.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew admits to Destiny, for the first time, that he did shoot and kill Eddie Ford. There is no excuse or justification and his life is ruined. But she is not going to let him give up on his life because of that. And they end up kissing. Bo goes to talk to Clint and they talk about what would happen if he died. Viki goes to see Charlie and \"reluctantly\" leaves the tape of Echo confirming with Clint that she has lied to Charlie, Rex and Shane that he is Rex's father when she's known all along that he is not. Dorian encourages Viki to know that Charlie will get back with her after finding out what kind of a person Echo is. But Viki is not as confident. Charlie is devastated and furious when he hears the tape and tells Echo he never wants to see her again. She urges him to give them another chance. But he is adamant about not considering doing that. Robert and Brody go to find Tess at Cutter Wentworth's motel room, agreeing to have her committed to St. Anne's so that Jessica will come back. But she and Cutter have a trick up their sleeves and reveal that her marriage to Robert is annulled and she is now legally married to Cutter. She tells the two men that neither of them have any power over her ever again no matter what they say or do.",
