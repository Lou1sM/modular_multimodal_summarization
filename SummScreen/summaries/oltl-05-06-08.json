Left alone to their own devices, Viki and Gigi shared coffee and confidences. Gigi expressed apprehension about Rex's easy friendship with Shane. She told Viki she knew Rex's priorities would change after his wedding to Adrian, and said she didn't want Shane to feel abandoned. \n\n\nViki didn't see the harm in Rex's friendship with Gigi and her son but picked up on Gigi's growing unease with the topic. Viki asked Gigi if she still loved Rex. Gigi hedged, saying that she and Rex had been \"kids\" back in Michigan. Viki asked if that meant things had been over when Rex had left town. \"For him it was,\" Gigi answered softly. She tried to dismiss her feelings as residual emotions, saying it was \"wishful thinking\" because Rex was a good man and a good friend to Shane. \n\n\nGigi hesitantly added, \"He watches me. I can feel it. I keep catching him.\" She admitted that she suspected Rex still had feelings for her, too, and mentioned his almost kissing her at Buchanan Enterprises. Viki probed Gigi for the details and wondered if Rex was having second thoughts about marrying Adriana, but Gigi refused to consider it, saying that she couldn't get hopeful for more. Gigi mused that back in Paris, she'd been the one who'd had it together, but in Llanview, Viki was the one with the happy ending with Charlie. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan ranch in Texas, Natalie and Jared were blissful in each other's arms. Jared thanked Natalie for being there with him, and Natalie said she wished she could turn the clock back to 2007. Jared wanted them to just enjoy being together, but Natalie feared what the rest of the world would say when they learned \"I slept with my uncle.\" As they dressed, Natalie said they had to tell the family the truth, while Jared explained the finer points of his Buchanan scam to Natalie, running through his heist of David Vickers' hair sample and the role that Pamela had played. \n\n\nNatalie raised the question of whether or not they should tell the Buchanans that David was Asa's heir. She said yes; Jared said no, that it would be better for everyone and for the business. He swore he would protect Nigel from the fallout of his lies and agonized over what his deception had done to Renee and the rest of the family. Natalie said she hated deceiving her mother, to which Jared replied, \"Oh, boy.\" \n\n\nAs Jared revealed Charlie's identity and explained the evolution of his involvement in Jared's scheme, Natalie was horrified and incredulous. She was pained for Rex and Viki, who had both grown to love Charlie. Jared said they didn't need to know, but Natalie warned Jared that everyone would find out the whole truth once his initial lie was revealed, and Charlie would be discovered. She insisted that they had to tell Viki, even if it broke her heart. \n\n\nAt their hotel suite, Talia awoke with Antonio by her side once more, but Ramsey pounded on their hotel door, demanding \"John\" and Talia open up. John intercepted him in the hallway, saying he was just returning. Antonio hid in the bathroom, and Talia followed after a brief confrontation with Ramsey, who turned his attentions back to John. Ramsey demanded that John find Cole Thornhart and Starr, reminding John that he'd promised Marty he'd look after her son. \n\n\n\"You don't wanna go there,\" John warned, but he agreed that he'd find Cole one way or the other. Ramsey departed, and Antonio and Talia crept out from the bathroom to discuss their situation with John. Antonio ached to be with Talia, but the trio agreed they had to pick up the pace in their scheme to shut Ramsey down. Antonio and John decided that they'd given Ramsey enough cause to believe that Antonio was teetering on the edge of corruption, with his claims of Jamie's illness as well as his theft of the drug buy money. \"It's time to reel him in,\" Antonio said. \n\n\nAfter Antonio left, Talia sympathized with John about the Cole situation, and John said he'd mishandled the teens' conflict with Todd. Talia admitted that though Ramsey was a pig, sometimes he seemed almost kind and sweet, as he was with Jamie. John warned Talia that Ramsey had only been playing her and that there was no good in him. \n\n\nAt the boutique, Michael and Cristian met up to be fitted for the tuxedos they would wear as Rex's groomsmen and traded notes about Marcie. Michael was anxious about his wedding anniversary and said they were just trying to put their lives back together. Rex, Charlie, and Shane arrived, and Rex introduced Shane to Cristian. The boutique's clerk ushered Shane off with Cristian and Michael to be fitted. \n\n\nAfterwards, Shane squirmed in his new tuxedo as he, Michael, and Cristian checked themselves out in the mirror. \"When I get married, I'm wearing jeans,\" Shane proclaimed, and he complained that he looked like a penguin. Cristian told Michael he had nothing to worry about where he and Marcie were concerned, but Michael wasn't so sure they could make it. He told Cristian that unless a person married someone he really loved, there would be no lasting chance, a comment that ruffled Rex's feathers when he overheard. \n\n\nDuring the fitting, Rex and Charlie chatted privately about the wedding. Charlie apologized for not going to Rex's alcohol-ready bachelor party but noted Rex's nerves about the impending nuptials. When the subject of Gigi and Shane arose, Rex seemed to protest too much that Gigi was just a friend and that there was nothing more to it, then added, \"but if there were...\" \n\n\nRex asked Charlie if marriage changed people, and he said that Adriana had become different somehow. He confessed that he'd almost kissed Gigi. Charlie asked if Rex wanted to lose Adriana, but the agitated Rex didn't answer and insisted it was all just typical \"cold feet,\" desperate for Charlie to agree with him. Charlie said he'd been a terrible husband to Valerie but warned Rex not to go into a marriage with any doubts. \n\n\nBack at the Llanview Police Station, Eddie entered Ramsey's office and complained that Antonio was late again. He suggested Ramsey fire him, drawing a sharp rebuke from the new commissioner for being unsympathetic to a single parent. Eddie was banished as Antonio entered and gave Ramsey back the money he'd stolen from the bust. Ramsey's reaction was reserved, and Antonio claimed that he would've kept it if he'd thought he could get away with it. \"Next time, take it all,\" Ramsey replied, referencing Jamie. Antonio insisted he had to find another way, and Ramsey wondered if perhaps he could help.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Brody awoke and found himself tied down, with Adriana looming over him. Adriana explained that he'd passed out in an alley after another drunken bender. Brody freed himself from his binds and asked Adriana why she was really involved in Gigi and Shane's lives. Adriana tried to play innocent, but Brody saw through her act. Adriana said all he had to do was keep Gigi away from Rex -- and start a family with her and Shane out of town. \n\n\nBrody said he didn't want a wife and kid, and he finally revealed that Shane wasn't his son but Rex Balsom's. Adriana flew into a rage as Brody retold the whole story; he said Gigi had been pregnant when she'd met him and that they'd lived together for a time before he had shipped out to Iraq. Brody said he wasn't \"Daddy material.\" Adriana wrote him a big check and told him he'd learn. She said Brody didn't have to settle down with Gigi forever, just long enough for Adriana and Rex to be married. With that, she flounced out of the hotel room. \n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Charlie and Shane returned from the boutique, and Viki and Charlie swapped notes about their revealing conversations with Gigi and Rex. Before they could discuss it further, Natalie called from Texas with something to tell her mother.\n\n\nIn the boutique, Rex struggled with his feelings when Gigi suddenly entered, and their eyes locked. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody is getting ready for Rex and Adriana's wedding. But there are some issues. Adriana meets with Brody alone, urging him to find Gigi and Shane and take them back to where they came from, especially knowing that Shane is his son. But at that point, he reveals to her that he knows Shane is not his son. He knows that Rex Balsam is. Rex talks alone to Charlie revealing his \"uncertainty\" about committing to Adriana. He also reveals that Gigi and Shane are important in his life. Gigi has a similar conversation about the same thing with Viki. After Jared and Natalie have slept together and he sees that she's forgiven him about lying to her family about being one of them, he drops the next \"bombshell\" upon her, that Charlie is his real father. Antonio and Talia reveal that they are still together and only scamming Ramsey to believe that they have broken up and that she is now seeing John. But the three of them are all concerned that Ramsey might be able to hurt them before they can pull off their scheme upon him.",
