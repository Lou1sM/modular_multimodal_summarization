    "soap_central": "\nNever Lose Hope\n\n\nRex and Gigi continued their make out session in the carriage house, only for Rex to pull away. Angry and confused, he told Gigi she couldn't have it both ways by sleeping with Brody and kissing him. He asked her to tell him where her surge of passion had come from, but Gigi was at a loss for words. Rex begged her once more to tell him why she'd left him for Brody; in agony, Gigi didn't answer and instead hurried to work. \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Shane refused to believe his mother would cheat on his father, but Stacy insisted it was true, and named Brody as the third party. Stunned, Shane left to confront his mother, but before Stacy could dress, she had another visitor-Stan her old boss from Vegas, who greeted her with a chokehold. \n\n\nStacy wrenched free from Stan's grip as he demanded the money she had stolen from him on her way out of town. Stacy claimed she had none, and Stan threatened to take it from her new \"boyfriend,\" who Stacy promised would defend her. Noticing the Morasco family photo, Stan asked Stacy if she'd stolen her latest man from another woman. Stacy countered that she and Rex were meant to be together, and that she'd seen him first. Stan warned Stacy that she had twenty-four hours to pay up, or he'd come after her, her boyfriend, and her little nephew. After he left, Stacy grabbed her suitcase and unzipped it. \n\n\nJessica ran into Brody at Rodi's, where Brody had just regained his job. Brody wanted to take Jessica up on her offer to spend time with him, but Jess warned him she was there with her family. As Viki, Charlie, and Jared walked in, Jessica had an idea: \"Let's give them something to talk about.\" With that, she slapped Brody across the face. \n\n\nBrody left while Jessica covered to the others, claiming that Brody was still trying to put the moves on her after sleeping with Gigi. She struggled to keep her composure when Brody texted her, teasing her by asking if the slap was foreplay. Turning to Viki and company, she made excuses about heading for the florist and rushed out. Jared and Charlie were fooled by Jessica and Brody's act, but Viki wasn't so sure. \n\n\nBack at the carriage house, Natalie walked in on the lovelorn Rex, still pining for Gigi. Hoping to cheer him up, she told him to be ready for her wedding, and Rex promised he'd be there. Natalie informed him that Gigi was un-invited and would no longer be a bridesmaid. Rex felt a pang of sympathy, and told Natalie that the pieces didn't fit; he wasn't sure Gigi had actually slept with Brody. He wondered if Brody was manipulating Gigi in some way. \n\n\nNatalie told Rex she felt Brody was a user, and complained about his \"harassing\" Jess. Seizing on his hunch, Rex raced out and told Natalie to lock up behind him. \n\n\nAt Llanview High, Marcie held forth over her class, warning them to get their homework done in time for the big dance. As she promised her students a night to remember, Langston and Markko's eyes met, envisioning their evening to come. They Instant Messaged back and forth, talking about preparations for \"Operation: Deflower.\" Markko told her they'd go to the Palace Hotel, and he'd pay the bill with some of his college funds, making sure they had the best on their special night. He told Langston to get the condoms. Shocked, Langston whispered to him: \"You didn't get the condoms?\" \n\n\nAfter class, Marcie spoke to Langston and Markko, congratulating herself on her matchmaking skills two years before and encouraging them to come to prom. The lovebirds said they wouldn't miss it. Heading into the hallway, Langston urged Markko to pick up condoms as soon as possible, before they sold out to other kids. Markko promised Langston he'd take care of it, and said prom night would be their best night together. As they parted ways, Lola listened in nearby, sneering that she'd see to Langston and Markko's \"big night.\" \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Kyle dropped a bombshell on Starr and Cole: his tests had revealed that Hope Manning McBain was not their biological child. Starr was flabbergasted, handing him her locket and asking if he'd tested the hair from inside. Kyle instantly recognized the locket and asked Starr if she was sure her baby's hair was inside it; Starr again said yes. Flashing back to his previous tests for Starr and Natalie, Kyle began to silently put the pieces together. \n\n\nLeaving the lab, Cole comforted Starr, suggesting Dr. Joplin had given the nurse the wrong lock of hair. Starr despaired that they had nothing left of Hope. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Jessica arrived for another tryst with Brody in his room. Afterwards, they basked in the afterglow as Jessica reassured Brody that he was a good man trying to do the right thing by Gigi, and assured him that soon everyone would understand. Kissing Brody one last time, Jessica headed for the shower. \n\n\nAs soon as Jessica closed the bathroom door, Rex barged in to confront Brody, but immediately noticed his Rodi's uniform, mistaking it for Gigi's. Believing that Gigi was in the shower, Rex became furious and railed at \"Gigi,\" calling her a liar and a slut for going back to Brody again. Overcome, he punched Brody in the face and stormed out. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi arrived late for her shift and went to wait on Viki's table, but got an icy reception from Natalie, who came on the scene at the same time. Natalie told Gigi she was no longer a bridesmaid or a friend of the family. Dejected, Gigi slunk away, while Viki warned Natalie not to judge appearances so quickly. \n\n\nBefore Gigi could catch her breath, Shane rushed in, loudly asking his mother if it was true that she'd cheated with Brody. In an impossible position, Gigi was forced to say yes. Hysterical, Shane told his mother he was moving in with Rex and tore out. \n\n\nThe Lord/Banks family watched in horror as the domestic scene unfolded between Gigi and Shane, but Natalie felt Gigi had gotten what she'd deserved for her \"two-timing.\" She fell silent when she and Jared noticed Starr and Cole walking into the restaurant. \n\n\nGrabbing a booth, Starr and Cole were still struggling with the shocking news about Hope. Starr wanted to know whose hair was in the locket if not Hope's, but Cole was fixated on memories he had of the baby, and dreams they'd had about their daughter's future. Cole told Starr there was one more way they could find the truth: exhuming Hope's body. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Kyle continue to remember his encounters with Natalie and Jared, and how Starr's locket tied into everything he'd learned. Doing a search for Jessica and Natalie online, he read about Jessica's mental breakdown and her kidnapping of Natalie. Testing the DNA evidence Natalie and Jared had given him against Starr and Cole, he discovered a genetic match. \n\n\nKyle placed a call to Natalie, ordering her and Jared to come to the lab immediately. Spooked, Natalie and Jared made their excuses and said goodbye to Viki and Charlie. \n\n\nAt the carriage house, Shane packed his things as Gigi begged him not to go. Shane told her she'd destroyed their family, and said he hated her; she'd broken his heart. Toting his backpack, Shane ran out as Gigi screamed for him to come back. \n\n\nBack at the Angel Square Hotel, Jessica emerged from the shower, worrying over Brody. Brody said he hated keeping the secret of Stacy's treachery from Rex, but he had made a promise to Gigi. Jessica couldn't believe Stacy would be so cruel and heartless towards her own sister. \n\n\nAt the lab, Jared and Natalie met with Kyle, asking what was wrong. Kyle said, \"plenty:\" Jessica had stolen Starr Manning's baby. \n\n\nBack at the loft, Rex returned just as Stacy hid her suitcase. Ranting and raving about Gigi and her promiscuous ways, Rex said he'd dreamed of patching things up and finally marrying Gigi, but he knew there was no longer any chance. Stacy was shocked to hear that he'd found Gigi with Brody again. Cuddling up to the jilted boyfriend, Stacy told Rex that Gigi didn't deserve him. \n\n\n\"Gigi's just a slut,\" Rex snapped, and then glanced at Stacy. Wondering aloud what Gigi would think, he impulsively pulled Stacy into a kiss. \n\n\n",
