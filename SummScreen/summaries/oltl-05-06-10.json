He expressed his sympathy for her mother's death and apologized for not attending her service. Kelly quickly advised him it had been a private ceremony. He indicated that he was in Llanview for business and accused her of running and hiding to get away from him. He was sure there was something between them, but Kelly snapped that nothing had happened. \"And that was a damn shame,\" Reed replied.\n\n\nKelly sat with Reed at his table but confirmed that she wasn't comfortable. Reed surprised her when he made it known that he had been \"lost ever since\" he first met her two years, one month, three weeks and two days before. Kelly flashed back to the day when Kevin had returned to their London home harried and busy, and had asked Kelly to entertain a business associate while Kevin cleaned up. Kelly was annoyed but had been pleased to see Reed, and it was obvious they were attracted to each other immediately.\n\n\nReed called it a \"movie moment,\" and Kelly admitted she had fun that night. She remembered she had done her best to explain her relationship with Kevin. Reed admitted that he hadn't even negotiated his business properly that night because he wanted to be finished with it. Kevin had called Kelly a star after Reed left and was thrilled that she had helped him seal a deal for Buchanan Enterprises. He had been glad they were still friends and a team.\n\n\nKelly and Reed recalled the next night when Reed had stopped by again. He asked her out, but Kelly strongly advised him that Kevin would have to be included. They were a solid team and raising a child together, she explained. Reed was sorry he had misunderstood the signals, but Kelly assured him he hadn't misunderstood. She just couldn't.\n\n\nReed wanted the rain check for a date two plus years later. Kelly was reluctant, and Reed accused her of leaving him hanging again. Kelly pointed out that it wasn't she who had left. She remembered that when she last saw him, he had planned on moving to Hong Kong. Reed had wanted to stay in London with her, but Kelly was uncomfortable talking about it when Kevin was near. Kevin showed up with a toast, and Kelly walked out of the room. She wanted to leave the Palace too. Reed asked what she was afraid of. Kelly insisted she had no time and she had a job. Reed got extremely close to Kelly and stopped her as she prepared to leave.\n\n\nNora and Shaw wanted lesser charges for Cole, but the judge refused to allow their plea agreement. The judge didn't feel that the deal served the community and there could have been a murder charge involved if Todd hadn't recovered. Both Nora and Shaw argued with the judge, to no avail. The judge was adamant that \"vigilante justice\" would not go unpunished. The judge announced that the charges would be assault and attempted murder. He called the attorneys for a sidebar.\n\n\nNora wanted the judge to recuse himself because she believed that the hearing had been tainted. She made it clear that she thought Todd had paid the judge off. The judge was angry at Nora's accusation and suggested that she should recuse herself as well. He knew that Nora didn't like the victim and had close personal ties to the defendant and his family. The judge spoke of filing misconduct charges against Nora. Shaw spoke up and advised the judge that he, too, wanted to argue the judge's charges. He didn't feel that his client belonged in jail. John told Marty that things didn't seem right with the judge and he left the courtroom. Cole was happy to see Hannah show up.\n\n\nNora considered her dilemma and announced that the charges against Cole would be assault and attempted murder. Shaw said his piece and both he and Nora wanted Cole to be released on bail. The judge was still antagonistic, but Nora thought that John could vouch for Cole. She added that while Cole had been arrested on drug charges, he had served his time and had been commended when he worked undercover. The judge said he'd make note of the commendation but wondered where John was. He wasn't even in attendance.\n\n\nThe judge sarcastically suggested that Shaw and Nora change seats, since Nora was defending the person she was supposed to be prosecuting. The judge declared that Cole was a threat to the community and there would be no bail.\n\n\nStarr visited Todd at the hospital but refused to talk about Cole. Todd snarled that he wasn't about to let Cole ruin Todd's last chance with Dani. He thought that Starr had chosen Cole over him, but Starr pointed out that she was there with her father. Todd wanted to make sure that Cole was punished for what he had done. Todd repeated that he did not push Marty down the flight of stairs and Hannah was lying. Starr agreed and wanted to find a way to prove that Hannah had made up the story about Todd.\n\n\nStarr thought that Hannah had lied to get Cole, and so far it had worked. Starr and Cole had argued on the day of the assault. Todd wondered if Hannah was crazy or dedicated if she was willing to risk being charged with perjury. Starr thought that Hannah was definitely crazy and while she knew something to back it up, she wasn't willing to share it with her father. Todd was irritated and claimed that everyone kept secrets from him, but Nora wanted him on death row for a baby's murder.\n\n\nStarr sighed and informed Todd that Hannah had overdosed on pills over some guy, and Cole was the one who had found her. Todd understood that Hannah had then attached herself to Cole and wanted Starr gone. Starr pointed out that Cole believed Hannah's story and Todd noted that the girl's scheme had gone according to plan. Just then, John stormed into the room. \"What the hell did you do with the judge?\" he asked Todd. He accused Todd of paying off the judge, though Todd denied it. \"Justice is coming for you, one way or another,\" John snapped. As he departed, he vowed to keep an eye on Todd.\n\n\nStarr advised Todd that she needed to check on Hope. She wanted to know if her father had paid off the judge, but Todd declared that he hadn't. He wanted Starr's help, since he could be in prison for a worse crime than the one Cole had committed.\n\n\nIn the school gym, Dani advised Matthew that she didn't want to talk about her parents. Matthew asked her if she had a date to the prom. Dani confessed that she thought everyone would go as a group, but people were pairing up. Just as Matthew was about to ask her to go with him, they were interrupted when a fellow student, Darren, pulled Matthew aside and asked, \"Are you getting with my woman?\" Matthew was confused, but Darren pointed to Destiny. \"That piping hot pot tart over there,\" Darren clarified.\n\n\nMatthew quickly assured the other teen that Destiny was just a good friend. Darren was glad to hear it because he wanted to ask Destiny to the prom. Nate handed Dani a gift. \"Happy Cinco de Mayo,\" he said. It was a phone to get in touch with her parents and to replace the one that Dani had unintentionally thrown at Nate. Dani declared that her mom would be the only parent she'd be on the phone with. Nate was impressed that Dani had acted so quickly to cut Todd from her life. Dani noted that she had made her choice, unlike T\u00e9a, who wanted to continue a relationship with Todd. The pair referred to their previous conversation about making choices in life. Nate pointed out that there would be other bad ones along with good ones.\n\n\nAs Nate was about to ask Dani to the prom, Matthew returned, and Nate walked off. Suddenly, Darren had a microphone and he sang an off-key song to Destiny, who looked horrified. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Destiny asked him when the song was finished. She turned down his invitation to the prom and cited the fact that he wasn't her type. Nate began to chat with Whitney, one of the cheerleaders standing around. Whitney asked Nate to the prom just as Matthew asked Dani. Dani looked over towards Nate and watched as Whitney handed Nate a pair of prom tickets. Dani accepted Matthew's invitation.\n\n\nDarren continued to pester Destiny, who said she was going to the prom with Nate. Darren called out to Nate, who denied that Destiny was his date. Darren assured Destiny that Matthew would go with Dani. As Destiny continued to say no, Darren threatened to sing all of the songs from the Michael Bolton catalogue. He took a breath and Destiny hastily agreed to go.\n\n\nDani asked Nate if he would be going to the prom with Whitney. He replied that he was, just as Dani would be attending with Matthew. He told her he'd see her at the prom.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair admitted that she knew about T\u00e9a's medical condition. T\u00e9a was irate as she screamed at Blair and inquired how her private file had gotten into Blair's hands. \"You have no right to steal my personal records,\" T\u00e9a shouted at the top of her lungs. Blair stammered and tried to explain that it had been an accident. She didn't steal it, though she did make a copy of it. T\u00e9a was prepared to call the police and sue Blair's \"skinny ass.\"\n\n\nBlair thought that T\u00e9a could put her final days to better use and perhaps it would behoove T\u00e9a to put her affairs in order instead. T\u00e9a confirmed that she was dying, and she asked if anyone else knew. As Blair recalled telling Elijah about T\u00e9a's illness, she stated that no one else knew. She added that it was T\u00e9a's personal business. A cynical T\u00e9a clarified that it was both T\u00e9a's and Blair's business. Blair confided that she had been sick when she saw the report. T\u00e9a asked why Blair was putting on an act of concern when she had always hated T\u00e9a. The door would be \"wide open\" for Blair and Todd after T\u00e9a was gone, T\u00e9a yelled. She knew that Blair couldn't wait for her to die.\n\n\nT\u00e9a got into Blair's face and hissed, \"Stop trying to act concerned, bitch.\" Blair couldn't believe that T\u00e9a couldn't see that Blair was really concerned. T\u00e9a continued on her tirade as she painted the picture that Blair didn't have to take any further actions to get rid of T\u00e9a. All Blair had to do was wait. Blair and T\u00e9a both cried and suddenly T\u00e9a lost all control and the anger took over. She began to hit Blair as Blair tried to grab her and calm her down. Blair finally managed to ask a hysterical T\u00e9a, \"How can I help you?\"\n\n\nBlair hugged T\u00e9a. They both cried but then had to laugh at the strange situation. Blair promised that she really wanted to help, even though she had always hated T\u00e9a's guts. She said it all went away after she saw the report. T\u00e9a told her that she had a second opinion and it agreed with the first one. Blair urged her not to give up and stressed that Dani wouldn't let her give up either. T\u00e9a had no plans to tell Dani.\n\n\nBlair was certain that would be impossible as physical symptoms would start to appear. T\u00e9a wanted time to figure things out. She did not tell Todd, either, since he was busy. Blair was adamant that Todd cared for T\u00e9a, and he was also Dani's father. Just then, T\u00e9a received a call from Todd. He requested her presence at the hospital. Blair urged T\u00e9a to tell Todd and maybe he'd surprise T\u00e9a with his caring. T\u00e9a could use a surprise, Blair added. T\u00e9a thanked Blair for keeping the secret to herself, though she called her a \"dishonest snoop\" as she walked out the door. \"Anytime,\" Blair called out.\n\n\nElijah turned up at La Boulaie and Blair asked him to hold her.\n\n\nMarty couldn't believe her ears that there would be no bail for Cole. She tried to remain upbeat as John returned. She knew that John had gone to see Todd. John stated that Todd knew they were on to him and if he made a wrong move, John would be there to stop him.\n\n\nHannah approached Cole. She was shocked that Cole would remain in jail. She didn't see Starr, but she was sure Starr would have been there if she could. Cole didn't seem so confidant and didn't see Starr as she walked up behind them.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at the hospital, and Todd expressed his happiness at seeing her. He wanted to talk about Hannah. T\u00e9a had something to tell him first.\n\n\n",

Starr goes and talks to Todd and admits that she believes that Hannah is lying to say she saw him push Marty.
