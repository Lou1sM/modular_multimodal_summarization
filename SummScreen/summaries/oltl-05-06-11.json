James explained that he had promised Starr that he wouldn't stay in his apartment with Deanna any longer. Nate couldn't understand why Starr was so insistent about it, until the young men entered the apartment. They found a skimpily clad Deanna sitting in a chair, reading a magazine. \"Okay, I get it,\" Nate announced.\n\n\nIntroductions were made, and Deanna, admitting that she had just woken up, ran off to put some clothes on. \"She's hot,\" Nate stated. James maintained that he was only interested in Starr, even though he had been in love with Deanna at one time. James understood why Starr had been upset, but he no longer loved Deanna. \"Are you sure?\" Nate asked as Deanna listened from the other room. James emphasized that Starr was his future and the girl he wanted to be with.\n\n\nDeanna returned and announced that she hadn't gotten the job she'd applied for at the restaurant. She had no money, and she didn't know what she would do. Nate offered to help her obtain a job at the country club for the warmer weather, but James was worried about where Deanna would stay.\n\n\nDani and Starr arrived at the hospital in order to visit with Todd. Dani revealed that she had fought with Nate about the innocence or guilt of her Uncle Tomas, and she'd trusted that her boyfriend would have been on her side. Dani firmly believed that Tomas was an artist and not a killer. The girls ran into Blair and Jack, and Blair announced that she wanted to take Jack to see Todd first, because they had lots to talk about. The girls agreed to wait, and they resumed their conversation about Tomas.\n\n\nStarr declared that she only wanted the shooter to be caught, and she didn't want to see Dani get hurt. Starr had no idea whether Tomas was innocent or guilty, only that Todd had claimed to have seen Tomas at the scene. Dani was confused about believing someone close to her. She recalled how badly Eli had hurt them with his lying. Starr noted that speaking of liars, she was certain that Deanna was lying to James.\n\n\nStarr explained the situation to Dani, and Starr admitted that she felt like a bitch, because Deanna had claimed she was staying in Llanview in order to earn money for an attorney. Starr was certain that Deanna was there to get James back too. Dani admitted that she'd be upset if a former girlfriend of Nate's showed up, and she understood why Starr was so concerned. Starr was worried about where Deanna would be staying, and she had offered Deanna some money. Starr had also offered to ask T\u00e9a to help Deanna out. Deanna had declined everything.\n\n\n\"This is my life we're talking about, and you owe me,\" Todd said to someone on the phone as Blair and Jack entered Todd's room. Todd quickly ended the call. He was pleased to see his son and noted that he hadn't seen Jack in some time. \"I've been under house arrest,\" Jack advised his father. \"Is that right? What'd he do?\" Todd asked Blair. \"Did you bribe a teacher or something?\" Todd addressed his son. Blair acknowledged that Jack had done far worse.\n\n\nJack stated that Shane was only a geek, but Blair lost her temper. She wondered if her son had learned his lesson. Jack admitted that he'd only teased Shane on the Internet, but Blair added that it had been \"vicious, awful stuff.\" Todd began to defend his son, but Blair prodded Jack to continue. As Jack haltingly confessed his deeds, Blair kept pushing him to tell all of it. Jack finally confessed that he'd taken a video of Shane without clothing, posted it on the Internet, and then Shane had tried to jump off of the school roof to kill himself. \"It's not my fault the kid's a psycho, right dad?\" Jack asked Todd.\n\n\nTodd asked how Shane was doing. Jack replied that Shane was fine. Blair thought that was hardly correct, and Shane was lucky to be alive. Jack tried to defend himself and pointed out that he hadn't been the only one to give Shane a hard time. Blair named her son as the ringleader. \"Is that true?\" Todd asked. Jack announced that he'd been bullied as well. \"Rex sent some thugs to beat me up. Mom's boyfriend took care of the guys,\" Jack explained to his father.\n\n\n\"Boyfriend? Oh you mean Tomas Delgado,\" Todd confirmed. Blair retorted that Tomas only happened to be on the scene, and he wasn't her boyfriend. She also wasn't certain if Rex were the one responsible, and she didn't blame him. Jack accused his mother of not caring about him. \"Why don't you just hit me again,\" Jack challenged Blair. \"I slapped him,\" Blair admitted. It hadn't been her best moment, but Jack had told her that Shane had \"asked for it\" just as Marty Saybrooke had.\n\n\nTodd was perturbed. Jack claimed that he'd heard his father say the exact same thing, but Todd denied it. Jack announced that he wanted to be just like his father who was \"rich, powerful, and successful.\" Todd confirmed that he'd always done what he wanted to, and he had been called a bully himself. Jack assumed the people who had said that were losers. Todd emphasized that they were people they loved, like Jack's sisters, his aunt, and his mother. Todd was aware that it was easy to take advantage of weaker people but those actions had harmful consequences. Todd didn't enjoy seeing Jack behave like Todd, and Todd confessed that it was the last thing he wanted.\n\n\nTodd added that he was familiar with both sides of the coin. He knew what it was like to be a bully, as well as how it felt to have nothing to live for. He'd been on that roof, he confessed to his son. Blair nodded her head in agreement. Todd was sorry that he hadn't been there for his son, but he hoped he could help Jack turn out to be someone that everyone could be proud of.\n\n\nTodd asked to speak to Blair alone, and Jack left the room. \"Thank you for backing me up,\" Blair stated. \"Do you think it's over?\" Todd inquired. Blair wasn't sure, and she wondered if it would have been over for Todd. She noted, \"Jack shows no signs of remorse,\" and Todd clarified that he had observed the same thing.\n\n\nBlair added that she was sorry, that Tomas was not her boyfriend, and Jack had been trying to make trouble. She'd only gone out with Tomas to try to obtain information from him regarding the shooting. Blair wondered how they could make Jack understand what had happened. Blair felt somewhat responsible, as she'd always \"indulged him.\"\n\n\nJack wandered out into the hallway and advised his sisters that they should consider leaving and returning later. \"The bullet did something to his brain,\" Jack said, referring to his father. Todd was sounding like a \"sitcom dad,\" Jack added. The girls were confused, but Starr received a call from James. He'd figured things out. Starr and Dani headed to James's place. Jack received a phone call also. It was Brad. Jack advised his friend that he hadn't seen Brad's latest maneuverings, but he wanted to tell Brad what should happen next.\n\n\nShane and Gigi arrived at the hospital for their scheduled appointment with Dr. Buhari. They were waiting for Rex to park the car. Rex spoke to Natalie on the phone as he walked to Dr. Buhari's office. He advised her that he would try to return the swiped tape, and Natalie agreed that it had been a sign of some kind that she hadn't been able to listen to Marty's tape. Rex felt relieved about not listening to Shane's tape, and he also saw it as some kind of sign.\n\n\nMarty walked into John's office at the police station as she spoke to Rex on the phone. She left the office door open, and she advised Rex that she still wondered what was going on with Marty. \"Did I hear my name?\" Marty asked loudly, walking into the office. Abruptly, Natalie turned around to face her foe, and she proclaimed that she had been talking about a forensics test and a certain party. Marty wondered why Natalie was present, but Natalie ordered Marty to stop eavesdropping. Natalie reminded Marty that Natalie was there doing her job.\n\n\nMarty announced that she was there to see John, because the two of them were back together. Natalie laughed. Sarcastically, Natalie added that Marty had given birth to Natalie's son too. Marty admitted that she had been delusional in the past, but she was clear. Natalie informed her that John was dating Kelly, but Marty called that relationship meaningless, and she advised Natalie that John had broken his date with Kelly to be with Marty. \"This time you won't come between us,\" Marty declared. Natalie deemed Marty crazy.\n\n\nIn an interrogation room, John attempted to interview Tomas, although T\u00e9a, representing her brother, insisted that John had only circumstantial evidence in Todd's shooting. John noted that he had a syringe with Tomas' fingerprints, and Todd had seen Tomas in the window during the shooting. T\u00e9a maintained that her client didn't have to say anything. \"But I will,\" Tomas announced.\n\n\nTomas wondered if Todd had actually stated that he had seen Tomas at the scene of the crime at the time that it had happened. Tomas also informed John that Todd had wanted Tomas deported, because Todd hated Tomas. John asked about the syringe, but T\u00e9a wondered if there were other fingerprints on it. John affirmed that there were, and they belonged to Dani. John tossed a file onto the desk. It was noted classified, and T\u00e9a flipped through it. \"How'd you get that?\" Tomas inquired. \n\n\nT\u00e9a noted the encrypted file, and John wondered why the CIA was interested in Tomas. John noted that encrypted files were \"high-level spook stuff.\" Tomas maintained that he'd traveled the world as an artist, and perhaps he was on some kind of \"watch list.\" John was skeptical. T\u00e9a asked to speak to her brother alone, and John departed. \"Who are you?\" T\u00e9a asked Tomas. She demanded an explanation, and she wondered if he were some kind of international criminal. \n\n\nTomas confessed that he'd done some awful things, but he hadn't tried to kill Todd. T\u00e9a explained that she couldn't use the file, and she wanted the truth as Tomas' sister, not his attorney. Tomas confessed how happy he'd been to reconnect with his family, and he was afraid that he'd lose them if they were aware of what he'd done.\n\n\nStill in John's office, Marty insisted that she and John were real. \"Real nuts,\" Natalie muttered. She was sure that Marty and John were not together and never would be. Marty suggested that Natalie ask John about it. \"Ask me what?\" John wondered as he stood in the doorway. Natalie explained that she'd heard that he and Marty were \"an item.\" \"Go ahead, John, tell her,\" Marty urged. Annoyed, John stated that his personal life was none of Natalie's business. Marty suggested that Natalie leave, but both John and Natalie announced that they had work to do. It was Marty who had to go.\n\n\nBefore she left, Marty dropped off some dessert that John hadn't eaten the night they were together. \"Are you serious?\" Natalie asked after Marty had gone. She couldn't understand why John was seeing Marty, but she realized that he didn't trust Marty. John refused to discuss it. Natalie told him that it was okay to date or even marry Marty, but he might want to ask Marty why she believed she'd broken up Natalie and John first. John continued to ignore Natalie and turned the topic over to business. He wanted more information on the syringe.\n\n\nNatalie confirmed that there had been nothing in the syringe, which meant one of two things. Either Tomas had not gotten around to filling it, or he had planned to inject plain air into Todd's veins. John was curt and thanked Natalie for the report. Natalie was finished with work and was heading to the hospital to visit her dad. She paused at the door. \"Whatever it is that you're up to with Marty, be careful,\" Natalie warned John.\n\n\nRex got to Dr. Buhari's office, and the doctor announced that she wanted a private session with only Shane's parents. Shane was left behind in the waiting room in order to do homework on his laptop. The doctor wanted to know how Shane seemed to Rex and Gigi, and Gigi noted that her son appeared to be quiet, but less stressed out. Rex added that it was a help that Shane hadn't returned to school. The doctor announced that Shane's private session tape had seemed to be missing, but it had turned out that it had only been mislabeled. The doctor acknowledged that she had been worried about the session's confidentiality.\n\n\n\"Okay, she's onto us,\" Gigi pronounced. Gigi admitted that she'd taken the tape. She had realized that it was wrong and she hadn't listened to it. She had been worried about Shane's suicide attempt, and she'd felt she needed to hear what her son had talked about. The doctor explained that she would have addressed any such issues, especially if Shane had shown that he might be a danger to himself. The doctor firmly believed that \"the process worked,\" and she didn't want Shane's parents to try to fix things themselves. Rex divulged that he had taken \"extreme actions\" himself. He'd gone crazy, but he was certain that he'd gotten his point across.\n\n\nSitting in the waiting room, Shane slowly opened up the site for MyFace. There were new comments on Shane's page that poked fun of him. There was mention of Shane's comic book heroes, and someone wondered if Shane could fly like one of them. Someone else wrote, \"Drama Queen. Didn't get very far.\" Another wrote, \"You couldn't even do that right.\" Shane slammed the laptop closed. The doctor summoned Shane into her office.\n\n\n\"I took the law into my own hands,\" Rex confessed, though he wouldn't go into detail. He apologized. Shane was angry that his father had stepped in once again. It was Gigi's turn, and she disclosed that she'd stolen Shane's tape, but she hadn't listened to it. Shane could hardly believe it. He showed them the MyFace page. \"What's the point of expressing my feelings when nothing's changed?\" Shane raged. Rex was livid at Jack, but Shane explained that kids changed their online names all of the time, so he couldn't be certain that Jack was behind it. \"Therapy is not going to stop these idiots,\" Rex shouted.\n\n\nDr. Buhari explained that there would always be bullies, and Shane's therapy was helping them to work on strategies in dealing with it. Shane declared that he would never return to school. The doctor acknowledged that it wasn't the proper time, and that the entire bullying scenario had taken time to develop. It would take time to work through it. She wondered why Shane had checked his MyFace page, and Shane admitted that he had hoped that the bullying had stopped.\n\n\nDr. Buhari made it clear that whatever the bullies said about Shane did not define Shane. For his next session, the doctor wanted Shane to make a list of his strengths. She also wanted Rex and Gigi to make their own lists of their son's strengths and why they were proud of him. She wanted to hear from them if Shane showed signs of stress. The family left the office, and they ran into Jack, who was waiting in the hallway for his parents. Rex accused him of writing on Shane's MyFace page again, but Jack denied it. His mother hadn't allowed him to keep his account.\n\n\nJust then Blair, and then Todd, emerged from Todd's room. Everyone stood there awkwardly. Todd revealed that he'd heard what had transpired between Jack and Shane, and he was sorry about it. Todd forced Jack to apologize, and Todd maintained that he would deal with his son. Blair hoped that it was all over. As Shane and his family walked away, Todd pulled Rex aside. \"If you or anyone you know ever lays a hand on my son again, I'm going to give you a beating.\" Todd assured Blair that he had merely extended a personal apology to Rex. Gigi advised Rex that she didn't think it was over.\n\n\nDani and Starr arrived at James's apartment, and they found Deanna packing her things. Nate took the credit for finding Deanna a new place to stay. She would be staying at his place. \"Isn't that great?\" Nate exclaimed. \"Yeah great,\" Dani replied.\n\n\nJohn returned to the interrogation room. Tomas expressed his appreciation for his sister standing by him, but he'd understand if she changed her mind. Tomas was escorted back to his cell. John advised T\u00e9a that he was able to see how well T\u00e9a really knew her brother.\n\n\nNatalie stopped by Dr. Buhari's office, but hid quickly when Marty went inside. Natalie heard the doctor state that Marty's tape had been found and placed in Marty's file. Marty was happy. \"No one else can know what I did,\" Marty exclaimed. Marty and the doctor went to the doctor's inner office, and Natalie sneaked over to the filing cabinet. She found Marty's file, removed the tape and left.\n\n\nMarty and the doctor continued to chat. Marty was ecstatic that John had told Natalie to mind her business regarding his relationship with Marty. There wasn't anything that Natalie could do about it, Marty gloated. The doctor pointed out that was because Natalie didn't know that John was Liam's father. \"And she never will,\" Marty stressed.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie knows that Marty has some secret that she is not revealing about Natalie, John and their baby. And she tells John that he needs, at the very least, to find out from Marty why she has told people that she is the reason why Natalie and John broke up, when everybody assumes it's because Natalie got pregnant by another man and lied to John about it. Dr. Buhari gets the correct respective tapes of Marty's and of Shane's private therapy sessions. Shane gets on his computer to find out that Jack's friends still want to torment him and Jack still feels no remorse. When Todd awakens, he affirms to Jack that he does not believe that it's ok for his son to be a bully to Shane regardless of Todd's own past behaviors in his life. John interrogates Tomas Delgado, very certain that he shot Todd although he has no substantiated proof. Tea represents her brother but privately asks Tomas what he is hiding from her. James knows that Starr is not ok with Deanna staying at his home and wants her to leave town. Nate then offers to let Deanna stay with him and his mom. And Dani reveals that she is not ok with that.",
