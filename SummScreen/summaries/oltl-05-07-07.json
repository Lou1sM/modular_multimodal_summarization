In Chicago, Detective Morris brought John a garbage bag from the crack den. Amber came running into the gymnasium and ran into Marcie, blubbering that Henry stole the drivers' ed car and sped off with Britney in the passenger's seat. Meanwhile, Cole and Starr were also in the car, and pleaded with Henry to turn the car around. Britney whispered something into Henry's ear that distracted him and made him slam on the brakes. \n\n\nMichael explained to Viki that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) could have been dormant for an extended period of time and asked if Jess had ever worked anywhere where she might have been exposed to the virus. The most common way to get it is through sharing needles with someone who has it, the doc explained. \"Needles? Like HEROIN!?\" Viki balked. \n\n\nMarty said she was sure there was a reasonable explanation for Todd's disappearance, and even though she's had her past with Todd, she genuinely hopes he's alive. Miles headed out to talk to the police commissioner. \n\n\nBlair and John got on their rubber gloves and started rummaging through the bag for anything that would have a partial print. John pocketed a broken cassette tape. Dorian wanted Blair to return to Llanview with her, but Blair was afraid of worrying the kids by coming back without their father. Blair changed her mind when she received a call from a panicky Marcie about Starr and the drivers' ed car. \n\n\nOver lunch at the police station, Bo suggested a weekend away with Paige and Matthew. Paige pointed out that the next weekend is Mother's Day and she feels weird considering she'd lost Hugh before she ever got to spend the holiday with him. Instead, she planned to go to California to visit Hugh's grave with his adoptive mother. Paige talked about she'd prayed for Hugh so many times before she met him, praying that she did the right thing by keeping him away from Spencer. Bo thought it was great that Paige wanted to visit Hugh's grave, but reminded her that Llanview (and Bo's house) is her home. He gave her a passionate kiss good-bye, then received a call from John before Miles could have a word with him. Miles thought back to the letter from Spencer, while Detective Morris told an inquisitive cop, \"The longer he's missing the more likely that he's dead,\" referring to Todd. \n\n\nBritney tried to calm down Henry after he sped through a stop sign, saying she never realized how much he cared about her. Henry went through another stop sign as Britney lied through her teeth about liking the earrings that he gave her. Starr told Henry not to believe one word out of Britney's mouth and yelled for him to keep both hands on the wheel as he reached in his pocket for the earrings. Britney modeled the earrings, while Cole found a pill that Henry took. Blair called Starr, but Henry instructed everyone to throw their cell phones out the window before Starr could tell her mom what was going on. Henry admitted that it had been two weeks since he'd slept and had been popping the pills like candy. Cole tried to relate to Henry by talking about how using steroids affected him, but Henry didn't feel that Cole's life was as bad as his. Suddenly, Henry complained of sharp chest pains. \n\n\nViki went into Jessica's hotel room to tell her about the HCV. Michael explained that drug therapy would help treat the virus, but that they'd need a biopsy of her liver. Michael asked her to remember what caused the virus, and she worried that she might have passed it on to her daughter. Once alone with Michael, Jessica candidly asked him if she was going to die. Outside, Viki told Natalie and Antonio that no matter how they felt about it, someone would have to tell Nash. Viki ran off to call Clint. Meanwhile, Paige walked in on Nash telling God that he'd leave Jessica alone if it meant she'd recover. \"I don't think it works that way,\" the doc interjected. \"Are you really willing to make that sacrifice?\" She advised him against making promises to God that he can't keep. \n\n\nBlair, John and Dorian got on the first plane out of Chicago so that Blair could see Starr. John said he'd try to have the tape fixed to see if there was anything on it that could give them answers about Todd. \n\n\nAntonio visited Jessica, who apologized for putting him through so much. The nurse informed them that Jessica needed to remove her jewelry before the surgery and handed Antonio her wedding ring. Then Natalie came in and talked to a sleeping Jessica, asking her sister how she could have gotten mixed up with someone using heroin. Jessica awoke from remembering an encounter with a slimy-looking guy as Tess, and told Natalie to believe it. Meanwhile, Nash asked God not to punish Jessica for loving him, then turned around to see Antonio standing in the doorway. \n\n\nHenry kept driving despite the pain, and threatened to drive the car to the end of the world. Britney pleaded with him to pull over, and it became more and more apparent that the side effects of the pill were causing Henry major problems. Cole offered to drive, but Henry wouldn't let him. \"We're going to do it my way or no way at all,\" Henry threatened. His chest pains got worse as he lost control of the car and everyone screamed. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nash is in the chapel at the nurse and he asks God to make Jessica well. Marty comes into the police station and meets up with Miles. Marty asks Miles what is wrong. Miles tells her that he knows what had happened to Todd Manning. Blair tells Dorian and John matter-of-factly that they can go back to Llanview, but she is staying here in Chicago until Todd is found. The police brings in a garbage bag full of things. One of the girl students tells Marcie that Henry is in the car with Starr, Cole and Britney and he is driving 90 miles an hour. Marcie goes to notify the principal. Britney, Starr, and Cole are still in the car with Henry and he is driving extremely fast. Starr notices something up ahead that Henry has to slam on his brakes. All in the car start to scream. Michael tells Vikki, Antonio, and Natalie that Jessica has Hepatitis C. Natalie wonders how you catch this. Michael asks Vikki if Jessica had ever had any blood transfusions. Michael explains how you get Hepatitis C from sharing a needle with a heroin addict. Nash tries to make a deal with God that if he will make Jessica well, then Nash will give Jessica up for good. Bo and Paige make plans for the next weekend, but Paige reminds him that next weekend is Mother's Day. Miles wonders why Marty would care if Todd turned up dead. John, Blair and Dorian go through the bag of garbage that the police had brought in. Everyone in the car tries to talk Henry into turning the car around and going back to the school, but he will not agree. Marcie calls Blair and lets her know what is going on with Starr. Starr calls Blair, but there is a bad connection. Henry orders all of them to throw their cell phones out the window. Michael lets Jessica know that she has Hepatitis C.
