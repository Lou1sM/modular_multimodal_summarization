    "soap_central": "\n The Doctor is In...sane \n\n\nDropping by Todd's house unexpectedly, T\u00e9a unbuttoned her coat to reveal that she was only wearing underwear. As an amused Todd looked on, Jack walked in and gleefully asked to take T\u00e9a to school for show and tell. He couldn't wait to tell everyone what he had seen. A horrified Blair grabbed her son and ordered him to leave the room. Attempting to apologize to Blair for her behavior, T\u00e9a was perplexed when she noticed that Blair was wearing Todd's bathrobe. Snidely, Blair informed T\u00e9a that she had spent the night there. \n\n\n\"Don't tell me you slept with her,\" T\u00e9a pleaded with Todd. Blair remained elusive but told T\u00e9a she was fired as her attorney. She thought that T\u00e9a should have had a better case. She also suggested that the attorney stop throwing herself at someone who didn't want her. Those last words came to a sudden halt when she looked at both Todd's and T\u00e9a's faces and realized that they were indeed lusting after each other. \n\n\nSickened, Blair accused T\u00e9a of throwing the custody case. Blair proclaimed she had every intention of reporting T\u00e9a to the bar association. Feeling disgusted herself, T\u00e9a stalked out, informing Todd that she was finished with him and that he could have Blair if he wanted her. \n\n\nFollowed outside by Todd, T\u00e9a insisted that she wasn't jealous but merely concerned. She pointed out that if Todd was sleeping with Blair then she was, too, and through association, Todd was sleeping with John. She indicated that he would soon be sleeping with R.J., as well, since she was heading off to meet him. She wondered who was really jealous when she noticed Todd flinching. \n\n\nClaiming he wasn't jealous, Todd expressed how sleeping with both T\u00e9a and Blair would be one thing, but he wasn't too happy at the prospect of R.J. in the picture. He admitted that he and Blair had not slept together and began to undo T\u00e9a's coat. \n\n\nAs Todd began to nuzzle T\u00e9a's neck, a man approached them and produced an envelope for Todd. T\u00e9a admitted that she had received a similar envelope earlier. \n\n\nAs Rex continued to kiss Stacy, the phone calls from Gigi went unanswered. She frantically left him a message that Shane was headed his way. Suddenly, Rex came to his senses and pulled away, cautioning Stacy that it was wrong for them to be kissing. Much to her dismay, he assured her that it would never happen again. \n\n\nShane arrived and announced he was moving in because his mother was sleeping with Brody. Appalled, Rex wanted to know how the boy knew. An uneasy Stacy was relieved when Shane claimed to have heard it from Gigi. Rex thought that Shane should stay. \n\n\nGigi finally managed to reach Rex on the phone. While she maintained that Shane shouldn't be \"running the show,\" Rex defended his son's desire to process all that had happened and be away from her. He thought it best that Shane stay with him and Stacy for a few days. He was shocked that Gigi had told Shane about her affair with Brody. \n\n\nStacy in turn, felt that Shane should accept what had happened and return to Gigi's house. Rex wanted his son to trust him. Trying again, Stacy felt that Gigi would be the one best able to cope with all of Shane's pills and his schedule. Rex thought they'd have fun and that he would be able to take care of his son capably. An annoyed Stacy was not happy to see Shane with her hair dryer, soaking wet from falling into the toilet. She looked at the family picture of Shane, Gigi, and Rex and envisioned herself in Gigi's place. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Kyle confronted Jared and Natalie, advising them that he knew what had happened to Starr's baby. He wondered if they would share the truth with everyone that Jessica had stolen Starr's baby because her own baby was dead. Horrified, Natalie convinced Kyle that neither Starr nor Jessica needed such a call, pointing out that Starr had been hurt enough and that it would kill Jessica to learn what one of her alter egos had done. Natalie defended her actions of keeping things quiet. She asked him if would protect his own sister if something similar had happened to her. \n\n\n\"How much?\" Jared asked point-blank. Kyle figured that $100,000 was a fair amount to keep him quiet, and should be enough to cover his med school expenses. Jared and Natalie wanted time to think about it, and Kyle advised them he would give them 24 hours. If he didn't hear from them, he would call Starr, Jessica, and the police, he added. Natalie hoped that his own sister was never threatened. \n\n\nIn Rochester, John placed a call to the Sitwell Institute and identified himself as \"Kevin.\" Ellen Kwan told him she was not familiar with a Dr. Saybrooke looking after Powell. Hanging up the phone, she received praise from Rebecca Lewis, known to her as Dr. Saybrooke, who explained that her treatment of Powell needed to remain confidential. She added that she felt sure Powell's family wanted him to remain locked up, but he would get his life back with her looking after him. \n\n\nAssuming that Ellen either had a gun to her head or had been \"turned,\" John was concerned. Marty couldn't believe that, after being a respected doctor, Rebecca had killed people or had gotten Powell to commit the crimes. He realized that Rebecca and Powell would be waiting for him to show up. He also mentioned that Rebecca had a brother, Kyle Lewis, living in Llanview. \n\n\nHanding Marty a gun, John refused to allow her to accompany him to Sitwell. Awkwardly, he gave her instructions on using the gun. He told her to phone Bo if he was not back in one hour. \n\n\nMaking her way to Powell's cell, Rebecca let herself in. Powell expressed his happiness that \"Dr. Saybrooke\" knew him well. Hearing that John would probably be showing up, Powell indicated that he would be waiting for him. He confirmed that he wanted them to stick to their plan; he wanted the invitations sent out. \n\n\nJohn placed a quick call to check on Blair and informed her that he had an idea about the killer's identity. She told him that Todd had gained custody of the kids and that T\u00e9a had thrown the case. She admitted that she had checked herself out of the hospital. John promised to return soon and that they would get her kids back. He was not happy to hear that Blair was in Todd's house, but confirmed her belief that he himself was with Marty. \n\n\nHe assured Blair that he was merely protecting Marty. Blair indicated that she in turn was protecting her kids. While John was on the phone with Blair, Marty called Cole. She assured him she was safe and that the newspapers indicating her kidnapping were entirely exaggerated. Cole expressed his admiration for Starr and her aid in helping him get through a tough time. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Cole and Starr deliberated on their next move regarding their baby's cause of death. Cole stuck by his decision to exhume baby Hope's body, hoping that it would provide them with clues. Starr felt that they should confide in someone else and, spying Michael, decided he was the one. \n\n\nNearby, Gigi took Marcie into her confidence, explaining all that had been going on with Rex, Shane, and Brody. She was worried that both Rex and Shane would hate her together. A sympathetic Marcie pointed out that Rex would never turn Shane against her and that Rex would be hurt, while Shane would be angry. \n\n\nArriving at Rodi's, Jared and Natalie saw Starr and Cole and thought they looked happy. They knew that Jessica was happy and realized that they didn't have a choice. They knew what their decision would be. \n\n\nCole, Starr, and Michael pulled Marcie aside and explained their desires for exhuming Hope's body. Marcie was against it, but felt that if the others needed to have it done, then she was okay with it. She learned that the hair in Starr's locket didn't belong to Hope. \n\n\nAfter Natalie and Jared left, Kyle felt the need to check in with his sister. He advised Rebecca that he would no longer be needing a loan from her. She ended the conversation abruptly, just as he mentioned Todd's name. She turned at the sound of John's voice. \"Dr. Saybrooke?\" he asked. \"Do I know you?\" she responded back. \"You will,\" John replied. \n\n\nT\u00e9a and Todd anxiously opened their matching envelopes. Todd's envelope included an invitation for Blair, as well. They were invitations, with the symbol of KAD fraternity on the outside. It announced that the traditional Spring Fling was being resumed. Blair noted that Marty was raped at that function. Suspiciously, they all wondered what was going on. \n\n\nAs Marty awaited John's return, there was a knock at the motel door. A brown envelope was slid underneath it. Pulling the invitation from the envelope, she dropped it in horror when she saw the fraternity insignia. \n\n\nGrabbing Rebecca's keys from her hand, John let himself into Powell's cell as Rebecca tried to stop him. Spying Powell in the corner, in the straitjacket, John gently lowered to the ground. It wasn't Powell; it was Ellen. Turning to the door, John yelled as Rebecca slammed it shut. He demanded to be released.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr and Cole inform Marcie and Michael that they need to exhume baby Hope in order to find out why she died. And the reason is, they were told by Kyle Lewis, at the hospital lab, that the lock of hair that Dr. Joplin gave them is not that of Hope. Meanwhile, Kyle informs Natalie and Jared that he happens to know that Jessica stole Starr Manning's baby and they are covering for her. And they have to pay him in order to silence him. His sister, Rebecca Lewis is at the institution where Powell Lord is posing as Dr. Marty Saybrooke in an attempt to bust him out of the institution. John and Marty are on to her but she and Powell are onto him. Powell sends an anonymous invitation to Todd, Marty and Tea to attend the frat party where they belonged many years ago. Stacy is successfully working both Rex and Shane to believe that Gigi is sleeping with Brody and convincing them that she is no good.",
