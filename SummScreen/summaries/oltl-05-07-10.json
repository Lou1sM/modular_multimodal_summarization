After the clerk had left, Rex apologized to Gigi, because he could \"not spring for two rooms.\"  Gigi expressed hope that they could find Rex's parents in even less than two hours, yet Rex did not appear to be enthusiastic.  Rex was unable to believe that his biological parents would care if he were dead or alive, since they had wanted to get rid of him.  Gigi said that she would support whatever decision Rex made, but since they were already in Santa Fe, she wondered, \"Would you be able to move on with your life if you don't explore every lead there is?\"\n\n\nWhen Rex and Gigi entered the jewelry store, at first, the store appeared to be deserted.  Rex admitted that he was glad that Gigi was with him.  A lady walked out and mistook Rex and Gigi for the couple who had wanted the wedding bands.  After the lady questioned whether Rex and Gigi were married or were, at least, together, Rex showed her the necklace.  The jewelry store lady indicated that the necklace looked like something that her granddad used to make.  \n\n\nGigi asked if any records existed of the grandfather's jewelry, but the lady stated that any records of his jewelry would have been in her grandfather's head, and that he was dead.  When the lady stated that her dad was the only one who would know anything else about the jewelry, Rex asked to speak to her father.  The lady indicated that her father was busy.  Gigi exclaimed that she and Rex needed to find their son's only living relatives, and that the necklace was their only clue.  The jewelry clerk left to talk to her father.\n\n\nThe father followed the lady back into the store and demanded to know where Rex had received the necklace.  Rex told the dad of how his biological parents had left the necklace with Rex, after they had left him as a newborn at the hospital.  The dad asked Rex about the location of the other half of the necklace, and Rex indicated that one of his biological parents might have it.  Rex asked the father if he could tell Rex anything about the necklace, and the dad replied, \"Yes, I can.\"\n\n\nIn the dining area at the Palace, Reed attempted to kiss Kelly, as she covered his mouth.  Reed told Kelly that he had been wanting to kiss her since they had first met to prove that there was feelings between them, and Kelly admitted that she would probably like the kiss.  However, Kelly claimed that she was trying to start her life over, and that she needed to find who killed her mother.\n\n\nReed told Kelly that she needed to have some fun, and that she should go out and just have a good time.  Reed assured Kelly that if she went out to dinner with him, just once, Kelly could get rid of him once and for all.  Reed questioned what was the worst that could happen, and Kelly answered more than he could possibly know.\n\n\nKelly felt that due to what had happened to her mother and to Rodney, if Kelly and Reed were to start any kind of relationship, Reed could end up dead too.  Reed was willing to risk death to be with Kelly, and he just wanted to protect her.  Reed insisted that Kelly take the first step into her new life, and that she have dinner with him.  When Kelly agreed to dinner, Reed informed her that he would pick her up at 8:00, and because \"it is a good thing,\" she could relax.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion in London, Kevin greeted Natalie at the door.  As they visited on the sofa, Natalie speculated on what it would have been like to have been raised with the Buchanans instead of by Roxy.  When Kevin inquired why Natalie was in London, she responded that she was on an assignment to deliver Jared's death certificate to Kevin, since Jared's name was on a contract to be signed.  However, Kevin saw through this explanation as an excuse for Natalie to get away from Llanview.\n\n\nNatalie told Kevin about Marty's pregnancy and the loss of the baby.  Natalie then revealed to Kevin that Marty had believed that Natalie had pushed Marty down the stairs.  Natalie admitted that she had said some nasty things to Marty on the day of the incident.  Kevin speculated if it were true that John would not have been with Marty, she would not have been pregnant.\n\n\nNatalie insisted that John had told Natalie that he was going to figure out what to do about Natalie and John as a couple, but then Marty got pregnant.  Natalie laughed with Kevin at her nickname, \"Miss Perfection\" and stated, \"Anyway, Marty took her tumble right after that, and I was the number one suspect.\"  Natalie informed Kevin that the police had moved on to Todd as a suspect, and Kevin asked why John and Marty would suspect Natalie, if there was even a remote chance that it could be Todd.  Natalie replied, \"Because Marty wanted it to be me.\"\n\n\nNatalie vented that John had believed Marty, when Marty had accused Natalie of the push down the stairs.  Kevin explained that John's questioning of Natalie was part of John's job as a cop, yet Natalie could not get past the fact that John would think that she could do something like that.  Kevin asked Natalie if she was honestly done with John.\n\n\nWhen Natalie did not answer right away, Kevin asked if the two of them should check out London's single scene.  Natalie then responded that she did not think that there was anything that she could do about her and John.  Kevin insisted that Natalie not sell herself short and stated that she could always \"fly out\" to John, as she had just done with Kevin.  Natalie replied, \"You mean like you do with Kelly?\"\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Eli was concerned about Blair, and Blair explained that she had just seen T\u00e9a .  Blair declared that she had hoped that T\u00e9a would tell her that her prognosis had been a mistake, but that did not happen.  Blair cried, \"She has stage four cancer...and it's inoperable.\"  Eli expressed to Blair that he would like to talk to T\u00e9a, but Blair declared that T\u00e9a had sworn Blair to secrecy.  Blair insisted that T\u00e9a did not want anyone to know about her condition, especially Dani, and that T\u00e9a did not want Todd to know either.  Eli believed that Todd would need to know the truth about T\u00e9a, and Blair agreed that Todd loved T\u00e9a and would want to know.  Eli and Blair felt that Todd would be all that Dani had left unless Todd went to prison.\n\n\nBlair speculated on what would happen to her children if something happened to her.  \"It's a mother's nightmare,\" she cried.  Since she knew that T\u00e9a was dying, Blair exclaimed, \"Actually, I just always thought that she was going to be around for me to kick around.\"  Blair had always blamed T\u00e9a for everything and acknowledged, \"Who am I going to be mad at?  Who am I going to hate?\"  Blair reflected that she had always hated three women:  Marty, Kelly, and T\u00e9a.  But Marty had just lost her baby, and Blair had just made peace with Kelly.  Eli commented that Blair had a big heart, even if she did not want to admit it, and asked Blair what she was going to do about T\u00e9a.\n\n\nIn the courthouse lobby, Marty asked John why Cole could not return home to stay with Hope.  John stated that he was certain that Todd had paid off the judge to have Cole put in prison.  Marty questioned where Starr had been during the court session and wondered if Hannah was lying.  Marty begged John to please tell her the truth if he knew it.\n\n\nIn the courthouse hall, Cole insisted to Hannah that Starr had chosen to be with Todd rather than to be with him, just as Starr arrived.  When Starr questioned the outcome of the court hearing, Cole showed her the handcuffs and asked her where she had been.  Cole explained to Starr that the judge had refused his plea bargain, had charged him with attempted murder, and would not even let him out on bail.  As Hannah watched, Cole asked Starr if she had been with her dad.\n\n\nStarr admitted that she had been with Todd and yelled that Todd could lose everything.  Cole exclaimed that Todd bribed the judge, but Starr said that Hannah was to blame.  Hannah insisted that she was not lying about what she had seen.  Cole observed that Hannah had been there for him, but Starr related that Hannah was just trying to be \"the supportive friend\" and that she was lying.  Starr exclaimed that Hannah got exactly what she wanted, which was to break Cole and Starr apart; however, Cole claimed that Starr was the one breaking them apart.  Marty ran in to interrupt them.\n\n\nStarr accepted that Marty had been going through a tough time, but that Todd did not push Marty down the stairs.  Starr blared, \"I would bet my life on it.\"  Marty related to Starr that Todd had told her the day of the incident that he had wanted Cole, Marty, and her baby gone.  However, Starr pointed out that Marty had never actually seen who pushed her.\n\n\nJohn, who had been observing this, asked Hannah if she had actually seen Todd push Marty down the stairs, because the wrong person should not be accused of it.  Hannah insisted that she had seen Mr. Manning push Dr. Saybrooke, and that she just wanted Cole to be at home with his wife and daughter.  As she left, Hannah told Cole to \"hang in there.\"\n\n\nStarr asked John if he believed Hannah, and John evaded the question and stated that he had to take Cole back to his cell.  Starr apologized to Cole for not being with him during his court hearing but begged him to consider that Hannah might be making it all up.  Cole reminded Starr that he would have a lot of time in jail to figure it out.  Starr insisted to Cole that no one could change her love for him.  After John informed them that it was time to go, Cole asked Starr to tell Hope that he loved her.\n\n\nIn Todd's hospital room, T\u00e9a informed Todd that she had something important to tell him.  Todd declared, \"No, listen...unless it's about Hannah lying about seeing me shove Marty, I don't want to hear it.\"  T\u00e9a understood that was Todd's main focus, and Todd insisted that it was \"a matter of life or death.\"  T\u00e9a commented that Dani would need Todd soon, while Todd wondered if T\u00e9a had told Dani that Todd was innocent.  Todd knew that T\u00e9a had not, so he exclaimed that he was innocent and demanded that T\u00e9a use Hannah's suicide attempt against her.  \n\n\nT\u00e9a stressed that she could not \"tamper with a witness this time,\" since she was almost disbarred the last time.  Todd demanded to \"do it for Dani.\"  T\u00e9a remarked, \"Yes, I do know how important this is.  You are all Dani has left, all right?\"  Todd wondered what T\u00e9a meant.\n\n\nT\u00e9a informed Todd that Dani was ready to write T\u00e9a off if T\u00e9a defended Todd.  However, T\u00e9a knew that she had to free Todd of the murder charges, or Dani would never feel free to go to either Todd or T\u00e9a.  Todd yelled that he needed T\u00e9a's help to beat the charges, so that maybe, one day, he and Dani could have a relationship.  T\u00e9a insisted that if Hannah were lying, T\u00e9a would prove it.  Todd demanded that T\u00e9a get Hannah to tell the truth, so that Todd and T\u00e9a could be parents to their daughter.  When Todd asked if that was what T\u00e9a wanted also, T\u00e9a sadly stated, \"More than you know.\"  Todd screamed for T\u00e9a to \"get it done.\"  T\u00e9a laughed and stormed out of the room.  In the hall, T\u00e9a burst into tears.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a sat at the bar with a drink, she lovingly gazed over pictures of Todd and Dani.\n\n\nOn his cell phone, Todd said, \"Yes, she's a student at LU, her name's Hannah O'Connor,\" as Hannah walked through the door.  Todd continued, \"I just want you to find her.\"  Hannah announced, \"I'm right here.\"  Todd looked up. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Cole is sentenced, Starr comes to the courthouse and urges Cole, Marty and John not to believe Hannah that Todd pushed Marty. Yet they all believe that Todd must have something to do with the judge having Cole sent away without any leniency for assaulting Todd. Tea attempts to drop the bombshell upon Todd that she is dying. But he is obsessed with getting her to represent him and helping him beat the false charges. So he still has no clue about what has happened to her. Reed tells Kelly he wants to be there for her and she must agree that they have a connection. She then agrees to have dinner with him. Natalie goes to visit her brother, Kevin, in London and tells him about the news involving Marty losing her baby and John's accusing Natalie and the suspicion that now surrounds Todd. Rex and Gigi go to Santa Fe, NM, to find the jeweler who designed the necklace that was left when he was abandoned at the hospital as a newborn baby and hope it will lead them to his real parents.",
