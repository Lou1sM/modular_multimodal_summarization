Digging in the rubble, he finds a badly injured and unconscious Natalie while Cris finds an injured Evangeline lying in another pile of rubble. John tries to keep Natalie calm while he tries to stop the bleeding on her injured leg. Cris sees that Evangeline has glass and cuts around her eyes and tries to go and find water to help her clean them out but she begs him not to leave her alone. After cleaning the glass out of Natalie's wound and applying pressure, he promises not to leave her until help arrives. He then gives her a kiss to help keep her conscious. Cris lends support to Evangeline who has decided to finally open her eyes only to discover that she has lost sight in both of them.\n\n\nMarcie, Michael and their wedding guests are having a good time at the reception, unaware of the accident involving Michael's best man. Marcie sings a love song to her new husband while their guests look on. Fearing that John won't be able to make it due to the inclement weather, Michael asks Spencer to step in and give the toast fearing that he may be paged by the hospital if people are injured by the tornado. Spencer makes a toast wishing Marcie and Michael love, hope, and that the worst of their marriage is getting through the night's storm. Just as everyone drinks up, Michael is called into the hospital leaving his new bride to carry on without him at the reception.\n\n\nSpencer is shell shocked by the photo of Margaret and David that he received via his cell phone. He is in even more shock when David puts Margaret on the phone. Spencer asks David what he wants to keep his discovery a secret and David tells him that Spencer needs to ensure that David's name will never come up in the Thomas McBain investigation (too late for that). David tells Spencer how ironic it is that he went to Thailand to find the baby figuring that Spencer had killed crazy Margaret but instead he winds up finding Margaret alive and well. Spencer warns David to watch his back and after he hangs up, he calls Denton and tells him to eliminate the threat in Thailand. Meanwhile, a suspicious Margaret begrudgingly agrees to let David stay with her for the night but warns him that there will be no funny business.\n\n\nKevin becomes concerned when Kelly fails to show up at Michael and Marcie's reception. He waits patiently at the bar but when the weather threatens to worsen, he informs Layla that he and Kelly got into a huge fight at the wedding and that he is headed to Blair's to make sure that she is ok. Unbeknownst to Kevin, Kelly and Duke are getting undressed and starting to make love as the storm rages on around them.\n\n\nTess is outraged that Antonio has a court order to prevent her from leaving the hospital with the baby. The three of them go back and forth yet again about what is best for the baby and Jessica before Clint walks up on their argument and offers them a compromise. They can all stay with him at Asa's until the baby's paternity is established. Nash (who seems to be the only level headed one out of the trio) agrees to the compromise as do Antonio and finally Tess.\n\n\nAs Rex is working to restore the lights in his loft, Adriana's stalker walks up on her and begins rubbing her shoulders. Believing that those are Rex's hands caressing her shoulders, Adriana is at first getting into it but then she starts to get angry that Rex is using the night's events to try to make a pass at her. She turns around and calls a surprised Rex a jerk. Adriana explains how she is upset that he was trying to seduce her while the lights were out. Rex tells Adriana that he was no where near her, causing them both concern when they realize that Adriana's stalker is becoming bolder and more dangerous.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "A tornado hit's the church where John, Cris, Natalie and Vangie are. Natalie is cut extremely bad. Vangie is blind. Clint separates Antonio, Tess and Nash from arguing.

Duke and Kelly share a very intimate moment.",
