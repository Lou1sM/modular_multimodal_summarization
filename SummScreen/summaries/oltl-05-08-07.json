Nash turned around to face Antonio and explained that he was praying for Jessica. Antonio broke the news that Jess has hepatitis C. Rex thanked someone on his cell phone for doing something on short notice, then covered to Adriana that he was talking to the manager at Ultraviolet and had a certain surprise planned for tonight. Blair and Marty pointed fingers for their kids' crisis when John received word that there'd been a car accident. Back at school, Bo greeted Starr, Cole and Britney, who had survived the accident. Britney cried as she touched one of the earrings, and Marcie and Langston were relieved to see that everyone was Okay. \"Where's Henry?\" cried Starr, and Bo explained that Henry wasn't wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the car and didn't survive. \n\n\nAdriana asked Rex what her surprise was, but he refused to give her any clues. \"I want you to be blown away,\" he told her as she headed to the ladies' room. \"Not as blown away as Tate's gonna be,\" he then mused to himself. When Adriana returned, she confessed that she called the UV hostess, who told her all about the surprise. She was impressed that Rex had planned an AIDS fundraiser, \"outing himself as a humanitarian.\" Rex told Adriana he was going to take her home and teach her a lesson for her naughty behavior! \n\n\nMarcie and the teens lamented that it was unfair that Henry didn't survive and that he was a good kid and didn't deserve this. Blair and Marty arrived to comfort their children. Blair wanted to know why this happened. Marcie asked why Henry would steal a car and why everyone got in it with him. Everyone looked at Britney, who claimed to be a victim and not at fault. Cole told the cops that Henry had been taking Dexamphetamines and started to have severe chest pains when he was driving. John explained that the drug causes hallucinations and panic attacks and is \"not something to mess around with.\" John said it sounded like Henry had a heart attack brought on by a drug overdose. Marcie chastised Britney for making Henry do her schoolwork for her. Starr tried to make Marty and Blair realize that Cole was a hero in this situation. Marty looked on as John comforted Cole, and Starr approached Britney to warn her that she planned to let the whole school know just how responsible she was for Henry's demise. \n\n\nAntonio explained to Nash that hep C attacks the liver and could be fatal, depending on how far along it is. Is it transmitted via sex? Nash asked, but Antonio said it traveled only through the blood. Nash insisted that he never shot heroin or shared any needles with Jess and he didn't know if she ever did. Antonio then pointed out that Jessica's not the only one they should be worried about \u2014 Bree would have to tested, too, and Viki was taking care of it. Antonio argued that Jessica is his wife and Nash doesn't deserve to know anything about her condition, but Nash pleaded to be allowed to see her. Antonio agreed on the terms that Nash not upset her. Natalie found Antonio and told him she hoped he knew what he was doing by letting Nash see Jessica. \n\n\nNatalie stroked Jessica's hair as she recalled making out with the slimy guy in a bathroom stall. Michael came in and told her to fight. Jessica berated herself for putting her daughter in danger. Nash arrived at Jessica's bedside and they shared a tender moment. A disheveled Antonio instructed a random medic to do whatever it takes to make Jessica better. \n\n\nRex was displeased to find Tate at Adriana's apartment, but gloated as he told the sudden newscaster that his station was doing a news piece on the fundraiser. \"It would be just ducky if you could join us,\" Rex cracked to Tate, then made a few innuendos before taking off, suggesting that he must have left his jacket in the CLOSET. At Ultraviolet, Roxy marveled at all the buff, gay attendees, and was shocked when Rex intimated that Tate is gay, too. Later on, Tate's news report ended with a live segment on the UV party and Rex saying he wanted to use the club for good, not evil. The camera panned to a few guys dancing ELBOWS UP! and asked if baseball legend Tate Harmon would be interested in joining the other gay celebrities there. \n\n\nMiles arrived at the high school auditorium to offer Marty his support, while John and Bo discussed Todd's disappearance and the audiotape. They both looked in Miles's direction. Starr asked her mom if Todd knew about the accident. Britney's bitchy mom showed up and complained about how long it took to get into the school, even though Miles seemed to have no problem. Blair broke down and informed Starr that her father is missing. \n\n\n",

Nash is in the chapel and he asks the Lord to not punish Jessica for loving him. Antonio listens to him. Nash lets him know that he was praying for Jessica. Antonio tells him that they all are. Antonio lets Nash know that Jessica has Hepatitis C. Rex is on the phone planning a special evening and he thanks the person for doing this on such short notice. He turns around and sees Adriana. Adriana wonders who that was on the phone. John receives a phone call. Marty and Blair are at each other's throats.
