Starr wondered if Cole was ready to confront Bo. Acknowledging that he was nervous about facing Bo, Cole stated that the time had come for him to face Bo. Cole also reminded Starr that they needed to get answers concerning their baby's death. \n\n\nInside the mansion, Bo noticed that Nora was attempting to avoid him. Realizing that Nora had misgivings concerning the awkward moment that they experienced in the car, Bo suggested that they discuss the matter. Nora was relieved when the doorbell rang. Desperate to avoid any further conversation with Bo, Nora raced to the door. \n\n\nNora was stunned to find Cole and Starr on her doorstep. After inquiring about Matthew, Cole asked for a meeting with Bo. Nora tried her best to prevent any interaction between Cole and Bo, but Bo emerged and agreed to speak with Cole. Stating that he felt terrible about causing Matthew's accident, Cole said that he understood that Bo hated him. Acknowledging that he was still angry with Cole, Bo admitted that he had once hoped that Cole would serve time in jail, but insisted that he didn't hate Cole. \n\n\nNora and Starr listened as Cole continued to apologize for his bad judgment. Cole announced that he was fighting hard to overcome his drug addiction and would never let his carelessness cause harm to anyone again. Admitting that he was still upset with Cole, Bo agreed to give him the opportunity to prove that he had turned his life around. \n\n\nBo and Nora were curious when Cole confessed that he had a favor to ask of Bo. Cole and Starr revealed that they had learned that Hope didn't die of Rh disease. Explaining that they had a DNA test conducted on a lock of what was believed to be Hope's hair, Cole and Starr related that the test revealed that it was genetically impossible for the strands of hair to belong to a child of theirs. Cole requested Bo's help in having Hope's body exhumed. A sympathetic Bo agreed to use his authority to help the teens discover the truth concerning their child's death. \n\n\nInside the gymnasium of Llanview High School, Matthew watched a group of boys play basketball. Spotting Destiny in the corner, Matthew approached her and attempted to apologize for lashing out at her. Destiny was still upset and gave Matthew the cold shoulder. Justin tossed a ball in Matthew's direction and interrupted the conversation. \n\n\nBoth Matthew and Destiny fumed when Justin hurled insults at Matthew and ridiculed him about needing a wheelchair. When Becca approached, Justin used the opportunity to further humiliate Matthew. Justin teased Destiny about being unattractive and overweight. Justin said that Destiny and Matthew should attend the dance together because no one else would be seen with either of them. Fed up with Justin's harassment, Destiny announced that she was indeed attending the dance, and not with Matthew. \n\n\nAfter Justin and Becca had left, Matthew begged Destiny to accept his apology and suggested that they attend the dance together. Destiny snapped at Matthew. Convinced that he didn't believe that she was capable of securing a date for the dance, Destiny angrily announced that she had an escort. Destiny appeared touched when Matthew apologized for not believing her. \n\n\nExpressing his gratitude for Destiny's past support, Matthew said that he hoped that she enjoyed herself at the dance. When Destiny asked if Matthew planned to attend, he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"What's the point?\" Later, Destiny phoned someone and ordered the person to be her date at the dance. \n\n\nBack at the Buchanan Mansion, Nora asked to speak with Cole alone. Nora thanked Cole for accepting responsibility and encouraged him to continue to remain drug-free. When Cole asked if Nora had heard from either John or his mother, Nora assured him that John would never allow anything to happen to Marty. \n\n\nNora joined Bo in the living room. They both admitted feeling sorry for Cole. Acknowledging that a random act had caused a terrible chain of events to transpire, Nora said that she realized that she and Bo needed to discuss what had or hadn't taken place between them that day in the car. \n\n\nAs Cole opened the door and prepared to leave, he was shocked to discover Matthew on the other side of the door. \n\n\nInside the hall of Llanview High, an elated Langston snuck up behind Markko and gave him a hug. The teens happily discussed the exciting night that awaited them. Markko appeared uncomfortable when Langston reminded him to book a room at the Palace Hotel and purchase condoms for their special night, following the prom. Unnoticed, Lola eavesdropped on Langston and Markko's conversation. With a devilish grin, Lola approached the couple and said that she hoped that they had a great time at the prom. \n\n\nAfterward, Langston worried that Lola might be up to something, but Markko didn't wish to engage in any discussion concerning Lola. Langston was certain that her cousin had some evil plot planned. Reminding her that she needed to prepare for the dance, Markko offered to drive Langston home. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian placed a frantic call to Blair requesting that she return home. Lola entered the room and expressed to Dorian the hurt she felt because Langston hated her. In an attempt to reel Dorian in, Lola mentioned that she didn't feel that she was mature enough to date Markko. When Dorian inquired why, Lola detailed the conversation that she overheard between Langston and Markko. Lola said that Markko was pressuring Langston to have sex. Refusing to believe that Langton would entertain the thought of having sex, Dorian insisted that Lola had misunderstood. \n\n\nLangston waited for Starr inside the foyer at La Boulaie. Thrilled, Langston announced to Starr that she and Markko planned to have sex after the prom. An enraged Dorian flung open the doors to the library and declared, \"Not if I have anything to say about it!\" \n\n\nBlair, T\u00e9a, and Todd stood inside Todd's living room and stared at the invitations to the Kappa Alpha Delta Spring Fling that they had all received. While Todd believed that it was a sick joke, T\u00e9a was certain that it was a message from the killer. \n\n\nAs Blair examined the invitation, she suddenly appeared listless. Blair related that John had contacted her and advised her that he was on the killer's trail and warned her to be careful. Moments later, Blair collapsed. Frantic, Todd ran to Blair's side and tried to revive her. Unable to wake Blair, Todd instructed T\u00e9a to call for help. \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a didn't respond to his scream for help, Todd discovered her unconscious body a few feet away. Suddenly, Todd began to feel lethargic and realized that foul play was involved. As he fell to the floor, Todd reached for T\u00e9a's cell phone but was unable to grasp it. \n\n\nInside Powell's cell at the Sitwell Institute, John discovered Ellen Kwan's dead body. The woman had been placed in a straightjacket with an envelope attached. John retrieved the envelope and realized that it was an invitation. As John turned to exit the cell, Rebecca appeared and slammed the door shut. Through the small window on the door, John screamed for Rebecca to tell him where Powell had gone. Rebecca refused to answer John's questions and walked away. \n\n\nMarty opened the invitation that someone had slid under her motel room door. Upon discovering that the invitation referred to the KAD fraternity, Marty grabbed the gun that John had left with her, but was suddenly overcome by the chemical from the letter. \n\n\nUnable to escape from the padded cell, John placed a call to Marty. When Marty informed him that someone had slipped an invitation under her door, John instructed her not to open the door for anyone. Gasping for breath, Marty stumbled to the door. John continued to warn Marty to keep the door locked, but she opened the door to get some air. As Marty collapsed, someone entered the room and closed the door. The stranger picked up Marty's phone and disconnected the call. \n\n\nBack at Sitwell, John began feeling fatigued. Rebecca appeared and advised John that he might as well stop resisting because the drug was too strong to resist. Rebecca informed John that the invitation had been laced with botulism, the form of the chemical that many women injected into their faces because of its amazing ability to paralyze their wrinkles. Rebecca warned John that he would become completely immobilized. \n\n\nFeeling the effects of the drug, John pointed his gun at his captor. Rebecca screamed for help. Seconds later, two hospital guards arrived on the scene and restrained John. Rebecca told the guards that John had wounded Powell, who was in the infirmary, and killed Ellen Kwan. Displaying a wanted poster of John, Rebecca announced that John was an escaped serial killer. \n\n\nRebecca stated that the Llanview Police Department had been notified. Rebecca said that the LPD had requested that John be restrained until their arrival. Exiting the cell, Rebecca claimed that John had been sedated and advised the guards that he was a dangerous criminal, who couldn't be trusted. Rebecca instructed the guards to use whatever means necessary to keep John under control. \n\n\nInside Marty's hotel room, Marty regained consciousness for a moment and recognized Powell. Mocking her for lying to him when she visited him at Sitwell, Powell informed Marty that he was aware of her true identity, but stated that he had no intention of hurting her. \n\n\nTodd managed to reach the ringing cell phone. The caller identification showed Marty's number. After inquiring if Todd, Blair, and T\u00e9a had received their party invitations, Powell informed Todd that he was back in commission and said that he would see Todd at the party. Overcome by the fumes, Todd lost consciousness. Later, Jack came downstairs and discovered his parents and T\u00e9a unconscious on the living room floor. \n\n\nWearing a straightjacket, a drugged John begged one of the guards to contact Bo at the LPD and to tell him that John McBain was being held at the Sitwell Institute. \n\n\nPowell placed an unconscious Marty on the bed. Rebecca arrived and the two shared an embrace. Rebecca told Powell that everything happened the exact way that he said it would. The couple proclaimed their love for one another. Powell said that they would finally have it all. \n\n\nWhile grasping the revolver that Marty had dropped, Rebecca helped Powell drag Marty to the door. Rebecca asked Powell if he was certain that he wanted to carry out the plot. Powell replied, \"Yep! Tonight I'm gonna finish what I started!\"\n\n\n",
