Unfortunately, they have not much time to celebrate being safe, as another is predicted to hit.\n\n\nAdriana is scared after being touched by the stalker and asks Rex to spend the night with her at his place. Not wanting to be blamed for taking advantage, he tells her he'll stay close and keep watch. When the heat goes haywire and he needs to check the boiler in the basement, Adriana is leery but agrees to lock up and admit him after hearing certain words. The windows aren't locked however, and the stalker returns, covering her head and getting her outdoors. When Rex returns he's forced to break his door down when he gets no response. A feisty and screaming Adriana finally manages to get a split second upper hand on her assailant, and with Rex showing up, the man runs off. The young people admit their love for each other.\n\n\nA raging Kevin shows up at Blair's looking for Kelly. She finally manages to convince him that her cousin isn't there. She is also rather skeptical of Kevin's side of the story, thinking that it's more likely his fault that they're having an argument and have broken up. She knows that Kelly has tried to save the relationship because she loves Kevin. She blames his drinking and she's not happy that he's not speaking well of Kelly. She does get him to agree to go and look for her before he blames himself if something bad has happened. Blair tries to comfort Starr also, who is concerned for Todd's well being but the girl wants nothing to do with her.\n\n\nKelly and Duke make love at the rectory. When Kelly awakens, she's pretty disturbed over what they've done. She doesn't get the chance to say much more than that they've destroyed everything. The rectory is hit by the second twister.\n\n\nJohn does his best to keep Nat awake, starting off with a kiss. He admits that they should be together and he'll come through this time. Evangeline is frantic also but Cris vows to remain by her side. He thinks that glass may have gotten in her eyes; there's shattered glass all around them. Cris finally manages to get through to 911 and help arrives.\n\n\nMichael is on duty at the hospital and is there to give orders all around. He's there to receive Evangeline and Natalie and get them into rooms. Natalie has lost a lot of blood but she'll be ok. John tells her that she was right all along. Cris assures Evangeline that he wouldn't be anywhere else. \n\n\nAs Nash, Antonio, Tess and the baby head back to the hospital they are involved in an accident. Upon awakening, they find themselves in the car, hanging over some downed power lines. All but Nash who has been thrown from the car. Antonio calms down a hysterical Tess. He calls to Nash and gets him to respond. He then manages to get through the window since the door is jammed but he falls and is shocked into unconsciousness by the wires. Nash is unable to locate his cell phone but comes up with a plan; Tess doesn't want to remain in the car. He asks her to drop the baby down to him. She refuses but he tries to make her see it'll all be fine.\n\n\n",
