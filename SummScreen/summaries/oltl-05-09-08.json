Todd had asked Starr to return home and be his \"little\" girl again and had promised to allow her to continue seeing Cole. Realizing that Todd would never accept Cole because of her pregnancy, Starr was devastated. Starr admitted that what hurt her more than anything was that she could never go back to being Todd's little girl again. \n\n\nFeeling Starr's pain, Cole said that she could be a little girl for the rest of the night and led her to a huge amusement park. Forgetting her problems, Starr relaxed and enjoyed her night with Cole. Meanwhile, John and Blair searched the boardwalk for any sign of Starr and Cole. When they approached a hot dog vendor and presented him with photos of the kids, Blair became emotional after the vendor stated he had never seen them. \n\n\nAfter John calmed Blair down and promised her that they would find the kids, he convinced her to join him for a bite to eat. As they sat near the hot dog vendor's station, Blair was beside herself when she noticed a homeless teen rooting through the trash for food. After giving the teen food, Blair broke down. John told her that the kids would never end up in that situation, but Blair thought about the terrible situations she had gotten herself into when she had run away as a teen. \n\n\nNearby, Starr and Cole ran into Winter, one of the guys at the boarding house. Cole asked Winter where they could grab a hot dog, and Winter suggested the hot dog vendor around the corner -- the same one Blair and John were at. On the way there, Starr noticed a stuffed animal that reminded her of the one that Todd had given her as a child. Cole suggested that they eat later and promised to win the stuffed animal for Starr. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie a frightened Langston told Dorian that she felt it was too early to discuss having an abortion. Dorian attempted to convince Langston that the pregnancy could ruin the rest of her life and vowed to help her through the ordeal. Fed up with Dorian's persistence, Langston asked Dorian if she were trying to correct a mistake she had made as a teen. Dorian admitted that she had gotten pregnant at a young age but reminded Langston that she hadn't had the options that Langston did. Dorian informed Langston that she had made an appointment for Langston to terminate the pregnancy -- Langston was expected in the doctor's office in the next half hour. \n\n\nStunned by Dorian's announcement, Langston headed off to the abortion clinic with Dorian. Once there, Langston was terrified when the doctor and Dorian left her alone in the examination room. As she looked around the room at the stirrups and other medical instruments, Langston began to panic. When the doctor entered the room to examine her, Langston begged her to tell Dorian that there was a mistake and that Langston wasn't pregnant. As the doctor tried to calm Langston down, Dorian entered the room and demanded to know what was going on. Langston leaped from the table and screamed, \"I'm not the one who is pregnant!\" \n\n\nAt the Bonjour Caf\u00e9, Noelle was surprised when Natalie introduced Jared as her uncle. Noelle had assumed that they were a couple. When Noelle suggested that Jared resembled Charlie, Natalie and Jared grew nervous. As Natalie attempted to convince Noelle that Jared and Charlie weren't related, Noelle continued to point out similarities that both men possessed. Meanwhile in the kitchen, Moe reminded David that he had better shape up, or he risked getting fired. While frantically scratching a lottery ticket, David argued with Moe. \n\n\nLater, David had flashbacks about what had led him back to the Bonjour Caf\u00e9. Thanks to the lottery ticket Viki had given him, David's life had taken a turn for the better. Although the ticket had only been worth one dollar, it had provided him with a string of good luck. He had received a starring role in a television show and a hefty paycheck, but one night at the Playboy Mansion had cost him everything. Ever since receiving the ticket, David had never let it out of his sight -- until the night he had decided to go skinny-dipping with some playmates. \n\n\nWhen David had returned to the spot where he had left his lucky ticket, it had been gone. Afterward, David's life had taken a downward turn, and he had lost everything. He had decided to return to Paris, Texas, in search of another winning ticket and had stolen a motorcycle from a group of bikers. The bikers had followed him to Paris and beaten him senseless in the Bonjour Caf\u00e9. \n\n\nAn angry Moe had demanded that David work at the diner as a dishwasher in order to pay off the damages. Moe interrupted David's daydreaming session and ordered him to get back to work. Noelle entered the kitchen and announced that Natalie and her uncle were in the diner. As David peeked into dining area, he was shocked to see Natalie and Jared at a table, sharing a passionate kiss. \n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, Snoop Dogg performed at Adriana's bachelorette party. Adriana, Layla, Jessica, and Sarah all had a ball as they danced on stage with Snoop. After Snoop's performance, a humiliated Rex expressed his regret at entertaining everyone with his striptease act right before Snoop performed. Rex apologized to Snoop, who appeared amused by Rex's performance. Snoop told Rex that there were no hard feelings. \n\n\nAs Snoop congratulated the happy couple, Bo entered the club and glared at Snoop. In a stern voice, Bo said, \"Calvin Cordozar Broadus! I thought we had an arrangement?\" Snoop slowly turned around and faced Bo. In a grim voice he said, \"Bo Buchanan, we meet again!\" Bo reminded Snoop, \"You're in my town?\" Snoop replied, \"I know where I am!\" Suddenly, the two men smiled and embraced. \n\n\nRex, Layla, Adriana, Sarah, Antonio, Cris, Talia, and Roxy were all surprised to learn that Bo had given Snoop his big break in show business years earlier. Snoop had promised to keep in touch and had assured Bo that if he ever returned to Llanview, he would contact Bo. As the two men reminisced about old times, Snoop gave Bo his condolences over the loss of Asa. \n\n\nAfter performing again, Snoop enjoyed a good time with the Llanview residents. Roxy was especially charmed by Snoop, and even performed a rap for him. After a long night, Snoop said goodbye. As he exited Ultraviolet, Snoop affectionately rubbed a stoop outside of the club, looked up towards the sky, and stated, \"Llanview, what it do.\" \n\n\nRealizing Rex was still intoxicated, Bo drove him home. Afterward, Layla expressed her disbelief that Rex had actually stripped at the party. Sadly, Adriana told Layla that she believed Rex had actually shown up in hopes of finding Gigi. Layla believed Adriana was being paranoid. \n\n\nLayla observed Antonio and Talia bickering at the bar. Layla approached them and suggested that they stay away from one another. Antonio made a negative comment toward Talia and left the bar. As he walked away, he left a napkin on the bar. Pretending to be upset, Talia picked up the napkin, which read, \"Backstage in 15 minutes.\" As she walked away smiling, she dropped the napkin, and it fell to the floor. An unknown person recovered the napkin.\n\n\n",
