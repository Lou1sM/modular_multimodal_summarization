Startled, Tess awoke in the Minute Man Motel and found Cutter looking at her instead. \"You have a nice dream?\" he asked her. Tess insisted it was a nightmare, and she wondered if he might be ready to consummate their marriage. Cutter refused, as he looked out of the motel window for signs of Brody or Ford. He exclaimed that he was waiting for either of the men to show up and break the door down. Tess assured Cutter that neither of the men would be able to commit her, because Cutter was her new husband. She wondered, though, if Cutter were still in love with Aubrey.\n\n\nCutter emphasized that Aubrey wasn't involved, but Tess gloated that Aubrey would be stunned when she heard the news of the marriage. Cutter noted that it would be the same feeling that he'd had after Aubrey and Joey were given custody of Ryder. He was angry at Aubrey, because she had been married to Joey for months already. They had planned to rob Joey and run, but Aubrey had decided to \"play house\" instead, Cutter growled. Tess made fun of Cutter, and she acknowledged that he'd married Tess in order to \"stick it\" to Aubrey. Cutter noted that Tess had also wanted to \"stick it\" to Ford.\n\n\nTess denied Cutter's accusation, and she claimed that she'd only called Ford to make sure that she had killed him. Cutter declared that their reasons for marriage didn't even matter, because they were drawing attention from everyone just like they'd wanted to. Tess advised Cutter that if he didn't want to make love to her, he'd have to make it up to her. She wanted him to find them someplace better to live. Tess recalled the previous deal she'd made with Cutter and Aubrey. \"Ever heard of Plan B?\" Cutter asked.\n\n\n\"Bobby, what's wrong?\" James asked his brother as Ford stormed into the apartment. Ford explained that Tess had \"clunked\" him on the head, and had annulled their marriage in order to marry Cutter. Starr and James were astonished. \"You're free,\" James proclaimed. Starr announced that she would no longer have to worry about Tess \"hitting on\" James, because the woman was finally out of the apartment. Ford looked unhappy, though, and James couldn't help but wonder whether Ford had feelings for Tess.\n\n\nStarr and James tried to understand Ford's situation, but Ford was upset. He claimed that he was only concerned about his son and not anything else. James thought that Ford would have a better chance to obtain custody of Ryder without Tess being around. Ford agreed that Tess had been \"obnoxious,\" and she had been able to annoy him like no one else had been able to. Ford pronounced that he missed his son, and he stomped out of the apartment as loudly and quickly as he had when he'd arrived.\n\n\nStarr felt sorry for Ford, and she could understand how he felt. She'd had a bad experience with her daughter, Starr told James, who was unfamiliar with her previous experience. Starr explained how Jessica had stolen Hope and switched babies after Jessica's own newborn baby had died. James was upset, but Starr assured him that she had gotten her baby back and things were fine. She thought that she and James would be okay, too, especially because they suddenly found themselves alone. \"At this moment, everything is just perfect,\" she said. James and Starr began to kiss.\n\n\nJames picked Starr up, and their kissing grew more passionate. James declared that he'd wanted everything to be perfect for their first time together, and Starr thought that the moment was right. \"Let's go to your room,\" she murmured.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Aubrey and Joey finally managed to get a crying Ryder to sleep. Joey was concerned that Aubrey wasn't happy to have custody of the baby, but Aubrey assured him that she wasn't sorry for anything that had happened in her life with Joey. She was especially glad to have the baby, though Joey expressed disbelief. He'd thought that she never wanted kids. Aubrey stressed that the situation was different, and she'd had no intention of allowing Ryder to go to foster care. She didn't think that any child should be without a pair of loving parents. \"It's just not right,\" Aubrey added.\n\n\nJoey's suspicions were aroused, and he asked his wife if something similar had happened to her as a child. Aubrey didn't want to discuss it, but Joey promised that he loved her, and he wanted to hear about her childhood. Aubrey began to cry. She told him that while her family had been well off, they hadn't been caring. Her mom had never been around, and Aubrey had been raised by a nanny who didn't like Aubrey. Joey was confused. He had been under the impression that Aubrey and Cutter had grown up together.\n\n\nAubrey quickly replied that Cutter had been with their father after her parents had been divorced. Aubrey went with her mother who had done lots of traveling. Aubrey declared that Ryder would never feel alone or unwanted. \"Neither will you,\" Joey responded.\n\n\nKelly visited John's office at the police station, and she began to kiss him. Kelly wanted to make love, but John put a stop to their passion. Kelly agreed that John was right. She suggested that both of them were merely trying to get over other people, and she didn't want that to be the basis of their relationship. John felt that they were past that stage, and they even cared about each other a little bit, but were afraid to admit it.\n\n\nDown the hall from John's office, Marty was on the phone with Cole. She told him how well her therapy was going, and she revealed that she and John had gotten back together. She was making real progress, Marty stated. She ended her call and arrived at the door to John's office. She heard voices, looked inside, and saw Kelly and John hugging each other. She continued to remain hidden while eavesdropping on the couple.\n\n\nKelly admitted that she'd had difficulty in putting thoughts of Joey behind her, and she'd felt worse after hearing that Joey and Aubrey had received custody of Ryder. John reminded her that the custody was temporary, but he understood, because he felt terrible whenever he saw Brody, Natalie, and Liam together. \"How do we stop from feeling this way?\" Kelly wondered. John joked that having sex on his desk probably wasn't the way to do it. \"How about we hook up later?\" Kelly requested.\n\n\nKelly reminded John that she still had possession of his key, the one she'd swiped from Roxy, but she wondered whether John had to see Marty again. John assured her that he wasn't seeing Marty. Kelly suggested that they might jump to dessert first, and they agreed that they wouldn't talk about anyone else when they got together. Kelly proclaimed that she wouldn't \"let that bitch scare me away,\" and she gave John a goodbye kiss. Marty continued to listen.\n\n\nKelly left John's office and checked her phone before she walked away. Marty stood nearby and out of sight. \"You think I'm a bitch? Wait 'til you see me later,\" Marty vowed. Once Kelly was gone, Marty made her way into John's office. John wondered why she was there, and Marty noted that Kelly had been to visit too. John clarified that Kelly had been there on business, and their visit had been professional. Marty made it known that she was there professionally also. She'd been to see the doctor for her therapy session, and she had the signed form for John to review.\n\n\nJohn took the form, and Marty mentioned that she'd been thinking about changing doctors because Dr. Buhari had misplaced Marty's private session tape, though the doctor had eventually located it. John dismissed Marty and told her that he needed to get back to work. Marty suggested that they get together later in the evening, but John revealed that he had other plans. He thought that another day would be good. Marty expressed how happy she was that John was getting out so much. Later, John found his mother's ring in his desk drawer, and he recalled the day that Natalie had returned it to him.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie settled down on the sofa with Liam. She was anxious to listen to the rest of the taped session between Marty and Dr. Buhari. When Brody arrived home, she quickly hid the recorder from him. Brody revealed the latest occurrence with Tess and her marriage to Cutter. Natalie was certain that Brody would be able to convince Cutter to have Tess committed, but Brody wasn't too sure. He explained that Cutter had looked smug after the news had been disclosed, and Cutter didn't care about either Jessica or Tess.\n\n\nNatalie put the baby to bed. Brody lamented his situation to Natalie, and the fact that Jessica was supposed to be his wife. He was frightened that Jessica might never return. Natalie pointed out that she had the same thoughts about John, who was either with Kelly or Marty. As the couple cried on each other's shoulders, they drew closer. All of a sudden, they began to kiss, but they pulled apart abruptly when Liam began to cry.\n\n\nBrody went off to fetch the baby, and when they returned, both Natalie and Brody apologized for the kiss. He admitted that he hadn't been thinking, and Natalie declared that she hadn't been thinking either. They both agreed that the kiss had never happened, and Brody affirmed that he wanted Jessica while Natalie wanted John. Natalie thought that Brody's wish showed promise, while hers would require a miracle. She urged Brody not to give up and to do what he had to in order to get Jessica back. She thought that Brody should not think of Tess as Jessica and to break the rules if he had to.\n\n\nBrody agreed that Natalie might be right. He admitted that he would have \"lost it\" if it hadn't been for Liam and Natalie. Again they agreed to put the earlier moment and lapse in judgment behind them. Once Brody was gone, Natalie heaved a sigh of relief. She was anxious to get back to the tape.\n\n\nRyder was awake again, and Aubrey played with the little boy. She was startled when there was a knock at the door, and Joey answered it. It was Ford, and he had news for them. He revealed that Tess had annulled her marriage to Ford and had married Cutter. Both Aubrey and Joey were speechless. Joey was livid. Ford hurriedly explained that he'd been ready to have Tess committed. An obviously distressed Aubrey ran off to call Cutter.\n\n\nFord inquired about Ryder, and Joey admitted that the baby had been upset, but was feeling better. Ford begged to see Ryder, and Joey finally gave in. Aubrey returned, and she noted that Ford really loved his son. Joey gave Ford a few minutes and then thought it was best for everyone if Ford handed the baby over. Joey thought it would be more difficult if Ford held Ryder for too long. Joey was sad for Ford, and Aubrey noted that Joey was really kind. Joey just felt that he had to do it for Ford. Aubrey said that she loved Joey.\n\n\nCutter noted that Aubrey had done nothing for months, but he would \"get the ball rolling.\" Tess inquired whether Cutter planned to cut Aubrey out. He announced that he was leaving, but his phone rang. It was Aubrey, and Cutter was afraid to answer it. He figured he'd better tell Aubrey about his marriage in person. Aubrey left a message, and after Cutter listened to it, he realized that Aubrey already knew about it. Cutter ordered Tess to lock the door behind him in case someone like Ford showed up.\n\n\nJoey wanted to throttle Aubrey's brother. Just then Cutter arrived, and Joey grabbed him around the neck. Joey demanded to know why Cutter had married Joey's sister, but Cutter merely replied that Joey had married Cutter's sister. Aubrey suggested that Cutter had done a good thing, and his motive was to get Jessica to return. Cutter announced that he'd married Tess for the money, and he meant the Buchanan fortune, not Ryder's trust fund. Once again, Aubrey was speechless.\n\n\nAs James began to carry Starr off to his room, Ford returned. He announced that he'd seen his son and missed him more than ever. James and Starr had been thwarted in their lovemaking attempt. They could only look at each other sadly.\n\n\nTess recalled the dream she'd had about Ford when suddenly there was a knock at her door. It was Brody, and he placed Tess under arrest.\n\n\nNatalie listened to the tape and heard Marty state that she had been involved in John and Natalie's breakup. Natalie turned the recorder off and began to wonder if there was something that Marty might have done. She turned the recorded on again. \"Natalie didn't have another man's baby. She had John's,\" Marty was heard to be telling the doctor. \"Oh, my God,\" Natalie gasped.\n\n\nKelly arrived at John's place with an armful of groceries. She let herself in, but left the front door open. She was startled when she turned around and found Marty grinning at her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Tess has a dream that reveals she may have feelings for Robert and miss both him and baby Ryder. But when she awakens to Cutter, she wants to hide that all and move forward with their plans to mess around and take the money. Yet he senses she may have married him to stick it to Robert Ford as he married her to stick it to Aubrey. He reveals that he is losing his faith in Aubrey and angry with her for what appears to be feeling she has for Joey and wanting to raise a baby with him. Robert goes to see Aubrey and Joey and informs them that Joey's sister has married Aubrey's \"brother\". Joey is not happy with Robert but graciously lets him see his son. Joey and Aubrey are both sensitive to Robert's need to be a father to his child and do not seem to dislike him. And it seems they may be growing closer to each other. Cutter then comes by and furiously admits to Joey that he married Tess to get his hands on the Buchanan money. Marty believes that she has gotten back with John when she overhears that he wants to be with Kelly and still has feelings for Natalie yet she is not in the picture for him. So when Kelly goes to John's home to plan their evening together, Marty gets there first and looks like she might have some insane plan with the woman who has \"taken\" John from her. Natalie finally concludes that she will listen to the tape of Marty revealing her secret to Dr. Buhari. She grows closer to Brody as he has lost Jessica similarly to how she has lost John. She finally plays the tape and hears Marty reveal that Natalie did not get pregnant by another man and that she only wanted them to believe that so that she could break John and Natalie up.",
