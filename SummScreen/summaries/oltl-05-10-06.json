When Spencer leaves to go and consult with the specialist, Cris tries to keep Evangeline hopeful about her prognosis. John comes in to check on her and tells her that he feels that if she hadn't stayed behind to tell him about Vickers then she would not have gotten hurt.

She makes a comment about Viki which leads Clint to inquire about the conversation Dorian and Viki had the morning she returned his cufflinks leading Viki to believe that they had slept together. Dorian insists that she implied nothing of the sort and maybe it was just Viki sensing something between them they don't want to see. Clint reminds her that if there was something between them then no one would have to point it out to them. Dorian concedes as she becomes more and more worried about Kelly's whereabouts. As if on cue, Kevin shows and Dorian lets him have it about his lack of concern regarding Kelly on this stormy night.
