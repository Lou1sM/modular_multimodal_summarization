Nearby, Antonio agonizes over how to explain everything to Jamie as Carlotta gives him a pep talk. \n\n\nA perturbed Adriana orders Rex out of her apartment. She receives a call from Tate requesting a meeting. They get together at the diner, with two unexpected people. Rex insisted on tagging along and Paula, Tate's ex-wife is there. She wants to set the record straight. Tate is not gay and she will sign a statement to attest to that. Many of Tate's deals are ruined and his TV venture is on hold. Rex wants proof, like a long kiss. Adriana suggests that Rex is the only one who can fix it. She wants a retraction and apologies to both her company and the gay community. Rex asks why the couple was divorced.\n\n\nNash spends the night at the Angel Square Hotel with Bree, in order to be closer to the hospital. He hears from Marcie and Roxy that Mother's Day is coming up.\n\n\nViki surprises Jess with a visit from Clint, while she cries on Nat's shoulder. She feels that she shouldn't show her emotion, that they all need to be strong for Jess. She admits that she's angry at herself as she feels responsible for this. She knew she was losing time and should have told someone; instead, Jess went out to the bars with Niki. Jess feels she needs to explain how she got Hepatitis C and wants Clint to stand by Nash since everyone else is against him. \n\n\nAt school, the students and their parents begin to arrive for grief counseling. John orders the press to back off. Dorian has come to be with Starr, who has some aches and pains from the accident, as Blair has gone back to Chicago. Starr shares some tears with Langston. Dorian is happy to learn that Marty won't be leading the counseling. Britney knows that the whole school is holding her accountable for Henry's death. Cole tries to have a decent conversation with her, to explain how familiar he was with what Henry was feeling, but she's her usual self. Britney's parents arrive and announce that they plan on suing the school. They're thrilled to see Dorian and ask her to support them. She's appalled and tells them so. When Britney tries to get them to quit with their loud threats, they tell her to stop whining. Marcie feels obligated to apologize to the students for not seeing how Henry was; she herself was an outcast and was just like him. Cole thinks they each have to carry some of the guilt. It was an accident and no one person was responsible, replies his teacher. Cole and Starr find themselves alone for a moment and admit that they only thought about each other the previous night. Cole wants to go off and talk but Starr is sticking to her guns and refuses to be with him. They almost died and still their mothers couldn't be civil to each other, she responds. Her dad will kill him. She obsesses over him whenever she sees him and it takes a long time to get over it each time. Starr is the only one he cares about in the whole town, he pleads. She feels the same. Then she's not protecting him as she says, he accuses. She's protecting herself. Marcie later consoles an extremely upset Langston. \"I knew,\" she says. \"Not I knew, knew, but I knew and didn't say anything.\"\n\n\nViki, Clint, Nat and Antonio are ready to hear what Jess has to say. She mentions that they're waiting for one more person. Nash arrives with Bree and Clint steps up as he promised he would. Nash is here at Jess' request, he tells everyone. Jess apologizes to her daughter and says, \"Tess, no I, used heroin.\" She relates the details of the one evening that it happened. When she finishes, they learn that the results of Bree's tests are in.\n\n\n",
