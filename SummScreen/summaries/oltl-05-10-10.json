Markko appeared and asked if Cole was \"hoping I was Starr?\" Brody told Markko to hurry it up considering he broke a few rules to get Markko in to see Cole after visiting hours. Cole informed Markko about the \"rigged\" judge, the fact that he wouldn't be able to get out on bail before his trial, and that Markko would probably have to testify at the trial. Over Markko's protests, Cole told Markko not to cover for him again. He did, however, appreciate Markko's support, especially after Starr chose her dad.\n\n\nMarkko was surprised to learn that Starr was at the hospital with her dad instead of with Cole at the hearing. Cole explained how Starr showed up without apologizing, instead opting to take out her anger on Hannah. Markko insisted that Cole would get out of the mess he was in, and that everything would turn out okay. Cole wondered if he was a jerk for being mad at Starr for choosing her dad and for making Hannah out to be the bad guy.\n\n\nMarkko told Cole to have faith that everything would work out. He was still convinced that Starr was the one for Cole and that he should focus on making her happy. Cole felt guilty about having to miss the prom, but assured Markko that he deserved a good night out. Cole told his best friend that he and Langston were lucky to have Markko. After Markko left, Cole daydreamed about happier times with Starr.\n\n\nStarr returned home from the courthouse and thanked Langston for babysitting. Langston wondered where Cole was. She was surprised when Starr informed her that Cole would be in jail until his trial date with no bail. She also mentioned that Hannah was there for Cole at the hearing. Starr explained that she would have been there, but she felt ripped in two because of her belief in her father's innocence. She was distressed about the fact that Todd and Cole hated each other more than ever, and that she was almost being forced to choose between the two men that she loved the most.\n\n\nStarr disclosed that she thought Hannah was lying about seeing Todd push Marty down the stairs. She believed that Hannah deliberately wanted to cause problems in Starr and Cole's relationship because she wanted Cole for herself. Langston wondered if Hannah would go that far, which Starr believed. Starr told Langston about how furious Cole was that Starr appeared to have chosen Todd over him, so he began to accuse Todd again. Starr had defended Todd and blamed Hannah for everything. Langston was convinced that everything would work out and said that Starr and Cole couldn't break up too.\n\n\n\"Too?\" asked Starr. Langston clarified that, between Starr's father's arrest and Cole's arrest, a break-up would be too much to deal with. Starr expressed her regret at not being able to go to the prom the next night, but wondered if Cole would want to go with her even if he wasn't in jail. Because Starr decided not to go alone, Langston said that she wouldn't leave Starr at home alone. Langston vowed to stand behind her best friend for anything, but wondered if it was a little extreme for Hannah to lie about something so huge. Starr confided that nothing was too extreme for a girl who had tried to kill herself over Ford. Starr related that it was a good thing Langston had broken up with Ford because then Hannah might be after her.\n\n\nStarr, trying to take her mind off of everything, begged to see Langston's prom dress. Langston argued that it didn't matter because she wasn't going anyway. Just then, Markko walked in and said that he had seen Cole. Markko and Langston began to argue about whether or not Cole's actions toward Todd were justified, but Starr yelled at them to stop because nothing could be changed. Starr's friends promised to stop talking about it and inquired if there was anything they could do. Starr told them to go to the prom and have fun. As Langston and Markko went to bed, Starr looked at a picture of her and Cole and daydreamed about happier times with her boyfriend.\n\n\nAs Cristian, Layla, and Ford ate pizza, they joked that their apartment single-handedly kept the pizza place in business. There was a knock on the door. Much to Layla's chagrin, Ford opened the door to Jessica, who claimed to have a surprise for Cristian. Because the roommates were in the middle of dinner, Jessica revealed that she was going to go to prom with Brody. Layla questioned why Jessica didn't just post it on her MyFace page, but Jessica insisted that she liked giving her status updates in person.\n\n\nJessica suggested that the four of them share a table, but Layla reminded her that Cristian would be chaperoning and Jessica was just attending. Jessica turned to leave, but Ford insisted that there was plenty of pizza. Ford told her how cool he thought it was that she was redoing high school since there were things he would like to redo himself. Layla wondered if Jessica's parents knew where she was. Jessica assured them that they wouldn't be angry since she was technically an adult. As Layla pulled Cristian away to talk, Ford asked how serious Jessica and her prom date were. She looked at Cristian and said that they were free to date other people.\n\n\nFord was telling Jess a funny story about his prom and warned her to be careful. Jessica asked if he was still with the girl that he went to prom with, but Ford said that high school romances never lasted. As Jessica objected, Cristian and Layla argued. Layla asked why he was being so protective of Jessica, and Cristian explained that Ford was a dog, and Cristian had to protect his friend. Layla thought that he was jealous as Jessica walked over to the couple and asked if they had any more soda.\n\n\nLayla said they were out, but Jessica realized that it was probably time to go, and she wanted to visit her Uncle Todd before she went home anyway. She said she'd see them the next day at the prom and left. Ford thought Jessica was interesting, but Layla hoped she would reconnect with Brody. Layla hated that she was jealous, but she just wanted a night out without Jessica throwing herself at Cristian. Cristian promised her that he only had eyes for her as the couple got closer. Ford walked out, and Layla suggested that the couple move to the bedroom. Cristian said he'd be there after he finished cleaning up. When Layla left, Cristian warned Ford to stay away from Jessica.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the hospital to check on the officer standing guard outside of Todd's room. The officer said that Todd's daughter was in the room with him. The officer said that Todd was being released the next day, but standing outside of Todd's room was better than watching over the kids at prom the next night. He asked Brody if he wanted the shift, but Brody smiled as he informed his fellow cop that he had plans. As if on cue, Jessica arrived in front of her Uncle Todd's hospital room. Jessica and Brody talked about the prom, and Jessica promised surprises for the next night.\n\n\nAs Todd talked to one of his cohorts on the phone and tried to get him to find Hannah, she entered his hospital room. She introduced herself as Todd commented that he didn't recognize her with clothes on. She wondered why Todd wanted to track her down. He answered that he needed her to retract her statement about seeing him push Marty down the stairs. As Hannah stood by her confession, Todd reminded her that lying on the stand in court led to jail time. Todd informed her that he knew why she was there -- she wanted to drive a wedge between Starr and Cole.\n\n\nHannah suggested that Todd had forgotten what he had done to Marty when he hit his head, to which Todd replied that he was innocent. He reminded Hannah that he could have her thrown out of his room at any time. She finally told him the reason that she was there -- she wanted Todd's charges against Cole dropped because it was in Todd's \"best interest.\"\n\n\nHannah explained that Starr needed Cole at home and reminded Todd that he would do anything for Starr. She then recounted that the stairwell was very dark and that she thought it was Todd pushing Marty, but she wasn't totally sure. Todd made sure that Hannah meant to change her story in exchange for Todd to drop the charges. Todd didn't trust Hannah and stated that she only considered changing her story because it was a lie in the first place.\n\n\nTodd explained how T\u00e9a would rip Hannah to shreds in court, and that Hannah should watch her back when he was found innocent. Todd said that he knew she wanted Cole, but she couldn't use him to get Cole. He said that she had no idea who she was dealing with. He had the means to make her life a living hell or even end it. He told her to pray that she went to jail for perjury because then at least she wouldn't have to look over her shoulder for Todd. She said she'd see him in court and left the room.\n\n\nAs Hannah exited Todd's room, Brody demanded to know why she was in there. She said that she didn't know that she wasn't allowed in, and claimed to be helping Cole. Brody warned her to stay away from Todd, and Hannah left. Brody returned to Jessica's side to learn that she wanted to see her uncle. Brody wasn't sure that it was a good idea, but Jessica promised him that Todd wouldn't hurt her. Brody assured Jessica that he would be right outside the room just in case there was any trouble.\n\n\nAt the jewelry shop in New Mexico, Otto, the jewelry maker, told Rex that the necklace was the most special piece his father had ever made. Rex asked if he knew who bought the necklace. Otto went on to say that the necklace symbolized eternal love that was supposed to \"transcend time, distance, and death.\" On the back, a picture of running water was carved to symbolize constant life. Rex again asked if he knew who bought the necklace, to which Otto said yes.\n\n\nThe old man flashed back to a time when he, as a young man, tried to buy the necklace. This caused Rex to ask if Otto was his father. It turned out that Otto's father had refused to sell the necklace to his son and instead sold it to someone else. Otto couldn't remember the name of the person who bought it because it was a long time before. Rex and Gigi thanked Otto and his daughter for their help and left the shop.\n\n\nBack at the hotel room, Rex was on the phone with Shane and told the boy to take it easy on Roxy. Gigi got the phone and told Shane that they couldn't get a flight that night, so they would be back the next day. After hanging up, Gigi asked Rex if he thought Otto was telling the truth. Rex believed Otto knew more than he was saying. The pair couldn't do anything about it, so they decided to just go to bed. As Gigi got ready for bed, she watched Rex get ready. She turned the lights out and apologized for the lack of answers as she and Rex got into separate beds. As Rex looked at the necklace sitting on the dresser, he confessed that he believed the answers he was looking for were in New Mexico. Gigi hoped he was right.\n\n\nBack at the jewelry shop, Otto unlocked a drawer in his desk and took out a box with the same running water carving as the necklace. He opened the box to a collection of jewelry and closed it again. He put the box away and locked the drawer. \n\n\n",
