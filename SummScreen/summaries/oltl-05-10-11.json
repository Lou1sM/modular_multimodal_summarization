He informed John that he would only talk if John had some good food or wanted to announce that Tomas was behind bars. John declared that he had questions to ask. Todd felt that as the victim, he didn't have to answer questions. He suggested that John talk to the suspected shooter, Tomas, instead, because Todd was certain that he had seen Tomas in the window from where the shots had been fired.\n\n\nJohn handed Todd the brown envelope that Kelly and Blair had found in Todd's desk after he pulled out the document it contained that featured Todd's old face with some encrypted information. John noted that Tomas had also possessed a hidden file with a photo of Todd with his old face. John revealed that he'd received a CIA file on Tomas, but it had been encrypted also. Todd's file couldn't be deciphered, and John believed that both men were hiding something. John wondered why both men had hidden files with Todd's old face on photos, but Todd eluded John's questions.\n\n\nTodd claimed that he possessed the file due to his sentimentality, but he assumed that Tomas had been looking for dirt on Todd, because Tomas hated his sister's husband. Just then, Todd's cell phone rang, and John picked it up. He answered, but the caller hung up. John noted that the phone had read \"unknown caller,\" and he disclosed that T\u00e9a had informed him about the strange calls Todd had received prior to the shooting. Todd maintained that the calls had been from his informants, people he'd used for stories that were run in his newspaper.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie continued to listen to the tape that contained the session between Marty and Dr. Buhari. Natalie heard Marty confess that Liam was actually John's baby, and the steps that Marty had taken when she'd looked at the paternity test in the hospital lab. Natalie had possessed everything that Marty had wanted, and Marty had deduced that Brody and Natalie had slept together. Marty had not been prepared to have Natalie and John live happily ever after, so while not planned, the test alterations had been easy. \"Oh, my God,\" Natalie gasped several times. \"Can this be true?\" She was in shock.\n\n\nNatalie thought about how Marty had not only changed the test results, but had tortured Natalie for months. \"Sadistic nut job,\" Natalie said. Marty had been jealous of Natalie and John. Natalie told Liam that she had always thought that he'd looked like John. She would have to tell John the news. Marty had really broken up Natalie and John, after all, Natalie realized. She handed her son the stuffed animal he'd received from Brody, and suddenly she was aware that she would have to find a way to tell Brody the truth.\n\n\nNatalie tried to figure out what to do, and she thought more about Brody and how upset he would be. She wondered how she could tell him the news. She was afraid it would kill him. \"We're all he has,\" Natalie said to Liam. She decided she should try to call John first, but she was unable to reach him. She thought it best to pay John a visit.\n\n\nJohn suggested that Todd might want to cooperate, or Tomas would be set free. John received a phone call, but he didn't answer it. Todd wanted John to leave, and John ordered Todd to call him if he had any information on the document. Todd looked at the file after John left. Out in the hallway, John listened to a voicemail from Natalie. She told him to get in touch with her, because it was urgent. She needed to see him.\n\n\nBrody placed Tess under arrest at the Minute Man Motel. \"Again? You gotta be kidding,\" Tess shouted. Brody was serious and told her that the charge was attempted murder due to hitting her husband over the head with a blunt object. Tess reminded Brody that she was no longer married to Ford, but to Cutter. She hadn't purposely hit Ford, it had just happened, she explained. Tess said she was only happy that she wasn't married to Brody, and she told him she would not go with him.\n\n\nBrody admitted that while he would never lock up Jessica, he was more than willing to put Tess behind bars. He was pretty certain that he'd get Jessica back once she ended up in jail. Brody began to read Tess her rights as he attempted to put the cuffs around her wrists. Tess began to twist and turn out of Brody's grasp, and she accused him of forcing Tess to appear in the first place, after he'd slept with Natalie and they'd had a child. Brody stated that Jessica was well aware that there was more to it than that, but Tess urged Brody to go to Natalie. Brody announced that he loved Jessica and not Natalie.\n\n\n\"Don't you get it, officer? Jessica is gone. She's not coming back,\" Tess said as she sneered at him. Brody pointed out that while he'd \"heard it all before,\" Tess never won. Jessica always returned eventually, and he had no plans of giving up. Tess retorted that Brody had just always wanted a kid, and he had one with Natalie. She added that even if Jessica returned, Brody would still have problems, because Jessica's son was Ford's. Tess professed that Jessica didn't want to return because of Natalie and the baby. Brody stated that he was taking Tess to the jail.\n\n\nWithout warning, Brody grabbed Tess's face and called out to Jessica. He announced that he only loved Jessica, and he wanted her back. He began to kiss Tess, but she pushed him away and told him to give up. Brody cited the fact that Tess kept marrying \"low lifes,\" but he'd gotten Jessica back once, and he would again. He began to talk to Jessica again, and started to kiss Tess once more.\n\n\nJoey was furious to hear that Cutter had married Tess. \"Haven't you figured it out by now? I'm after the Buchanan fortune,\" Cutter bragged as they stood in the study at the Buchanan mansion. Joey couldn't contain his anger, but Cutter wasn't finished. \"Sorry, Aubrey, the jig is up,\" Cutter added. Joey's anger turned to doubt as he looked at his wife. Aubrey denied that she knew anything about Cutter's plan, and she couldn't believe what kind of person Cutter had turned out to be. Joey ranted about how he had welcomed Cutter into the Buchanan home and family.\n\n\n\"I'm a con man,\" Cutter answered. He'd been after the Buchanan money since he'd arrived in Llanview and heard that Aubrey had been engaged to such a wealthy man. He'd married Tess because it was another way to get to that family fortune, Cutter concluded. Aubrey tried to stop Cutter from continuing, but she was unsuccessful. Liam began to cry, and Joey agreed to tend to him, while Aubrey offered to talk to Cutter. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Aubrey demanded to know once Joey was gone from the room. She pointed out that Cutter would ruin everything.\n\n\nCutter disagreed. He believed that Aubrey had been the one to ruin everything after she played house with Joey and took custody of Jessica's baby. He thought that if Aubrey truly loved Cutter, she'd go along with him. He was certain that the Buchanans would give them money to get Jessica back. \"Tell me you're with me on this one,\" Cutter pleaded with his girlfriend. \"I won't use Jessica to blackmail Clint, and neither will you,\" Aubrey stated. She begged him not to hurt Joey and his family. Cutter realized that Aubrey had fallen \"for the mark,\" and was happy with her new little family. That was what she had wanted, he surmised.\n\n\nAubrey was sorry to have things end as they were, but she wanted him to walk away. She didn't want the family hurt. Cutter wondered what would happen when Joey learned the truth about Aubrey. She pleaded with Cutter not to say anything if he had ever cared about her. She didn't want Joey to ever find out that Aubrey and Cutter were not really brother and sister. \"What's going on?\" Joey asked as he walked in and heard Aubrey pleading with Cutter.\n\n\nCutter spoke up first. He stated that Aubrey was angry with him for messing with the Buchanans, and he added that Aubrey had not known that Cutter was after the family fortune. He stated that Aubrey was in shock. Cutter reminded Joey that Tess was still married to Cutter, and there was nothing that Joey could do about it. Cutter expected Clint to make a generous offer with \"lots of zeros.\" Joey kicked Cutter out of the house. \"Sorry I couldn't be the brother you wanted me to be,\" Cutter muttered to Aubrey on his way out.\n\n\nAubrey was apologetic to Joey. She'd had no clue that her brother could be so ruthless. Joey asked his wife if she really had been unaware of what Cutter had been doing, and Aubrey insisted that she'd had no idea. She was just as shocked as Joey, as well as ashamed. \"You believe me, don't you?\" Aubrey asked. \"Of course I believe you,\" Joey replied as Aubrey kissed him. \"Thank you for believing in me,\" Aubrey added as she went upstairs to a crying Ryder. Joey's loving expression was gone, and an icy one replaced it. \"Except I don't,\" Joey muttered to himself.\n\n\nBlair visited Tomas at the Llanview prison, because she wanted to talk to him. She admitted that she'd trusted him when they'd had their date at Capricorn, and if she hadn't received a phone call, they would have probably ended up making love. Todd was convinced that Tomas had been the person he'd seen in the third floor window at the shooting, so things were changed, Blair continued. Tomas continued to deny that he'd shot Todd, but Blair wondered why Todd would lie about it. Tomas noted that Blair knew what kind of person that Todd was.\n\n\nBlair acknowledged that while she was familiar with what Todd was like, she didn't know anything about Tomas. She had no reason to doubt Todd, and she was angry at herself for getting involved with another \"complicated, dangerous man\" like the psycho that Eli had proven to be. Tomas questioned whether Blair truly believed that Tomas had traits similar to those she had mentioned. Tomas realized it was hard for her to consider that Tomas was different, but he was.\n\n\nTomas grasped Blair's hand through the cell bars and conceded that he couldn't tell her why he had been on the scene of the shooting. He swore that he hadn't shot Todd, and he asked for Blair to trust him. Blair inquired whether Tomas couldn't tell her or wouldn't. Tomas didn't want Blair to leave, and he again admitted that he had no \"concrete evidence\" to prove what he'd said. \"I need more than you can give me right now,\" Blair told him. She wasn't able to \"go on blind faith.\" She walked away from him.\n\n\nKelly arrived at John's to get an early start on dinner, but she was surprised when Marty stepped out of the dark. She wondered what Marty was doing there, but Marty stated that she could ask the same of Kelly. \"I told you John belongs to me,\" Marty proclaimed. Kelly tried to make light of the situation, but Marty advised that she wasn't joking. Kelly wondered if John even knew that Marty was in his room. \"I am with John now. Not you,\" Marty repeated.\n\n\nKelly didn't think that Marty had been making much sense lately, and Marty offered to clear it up. Kelly recalled that Marty had claimed to have been responsible for breaking up Natalie and John, and Marty had also claimed that John was not with Kelly, but with Marty. Kelly pointed out that she had been the one invited to dinner, not Marty, so obviously John had made his choice. Marty chuckled. She believed that Kelly had a sexual addiction, and was suffering from both denial and delusion. Marty emphasized that John had only been with Kelly to get back at Natalie, but he was back with Marty.\n\n\nKelly did her best to dismiss Marty so that she could start dinner, but Marty stayed put. She noted that she'd made dinner for John the previous evening, and Kelly couldn't stand it, but Marty and John had a history. Kelly acknowledged that she was aware of the couple's history, and how Marty felt. Marty wondered why Kelly had thrown herself at John in his office. She'd heard all that John and Kelly had said, and she wasn't happy that they'd ridiculed Marty. John was too nice to stop seeing Kelly, Marty said, but he was finished with both Natalie and Kelly. Marty ordered Kelly to get out of John's life.\n\n\nKelly apologized for hurting Marty. She thought she should try to call John, but Marty continued to talk. She thought that Kelly was making a fool out of herself, and Marty was the one who knew John the best. Marty was the one who should be making dinner, Marty stated as she walked over to the groceries to see what Kelly had purchased. Pulling the items out of the bag one by one, Marty found fault with each and every one. While Marty was busy, Kelly pulled a long knife out from the set standing on the counter.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Marty saw her. Grasping the beer bottle that she'd pulled out of the bag, Marty cracked it against John's slot machine so that she was holding a jagged weapon. The two women began to circle around each other with their arms held out and ready to attack. Marty taunted Kelly and the fact that Kelly had mental illness running rampant through the family. The women shouted at each other, and Marty began to scream.\n\n\nBrody kissed Tess and moved away to look at her. She had a softened expression on her face, and he thought it might be Jessica. Just then, Cutter returned to the motel. \"Get your hands off my wife,\" Cutter yelled when he saw the couple. Tess looked confused as the men began to argue. They both called out for the woman of their respective choices to stay with them. Tess turned and pulled all of her hair into a black hat. \"Where the hell am I?\" she asked as she turned back around to face the men.\n\n\n\"Jessica?\" Brody asked. \"Tess?\" Cutter inquired. \"Uh, neither. I'm Wes,\" the young woman replied.\n\n\nNatalie and Liam arrived at John's place, and Natalie knocked on the door. She was able to walk inside, and she looked around in surprise. The place was in disarray. \"John?\" she called out.\n  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cuter goes to reveal to Joey that he married Tess for the sole purpose of taking the Buchanan's money. And he does not care if Aubrey overhears. This obviously casts suspicion on Aubrey sine Joey believe Cutter is her brother and sees how \"close\" the two of them are. How could she not know that a close family member she grew up with could do something like this. And alone, he admits he may not trust Aubrey after all, although he tells her otherwise. Natalie listens to the tape where Marty confirms to Dr. Buhari that she did in fact alter Natalie's medical record to make her believe that Brody is the father of her baby so that John would break up with her and realize that Marty is the right woman for him. At that point, Natalie admits she is not ok to have to break Brody's heart that he is not Liam's father but has new found \"hope\" that John is her baby's father. She goes to John's home. But after Marty overhears John and Kelly talking about seeing each other and that he is not interested in her, she goes to \"surprise\" Kelly.. Marty obviously wants to get revenge upon maybe one or more of the women in John's life who are more important to him than she is. Brody then realizes he needs to take drastic action to get Jessica back. But when she is torn between being Jessica and getting back with Brody vs. her plan, as Tess with Cutter, we see yet another \"alter\" come out. And she appears to be Brody's Army friend, Wes.",
