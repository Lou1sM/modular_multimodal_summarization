He says he won't let anyone hurt her and insists that he didn't tell her he loved her last night just because she was in danger-it's always been the truth.  He tries to comfort her and make her laugh, which leads to him taking most of his clothing off and threatening to jump in the freezing cold lake.  She laughs and the two share a kiss, just before Rex loses his balance and falls in the lake anyway.  Unfortunately, their happiness may be short-lived, as it appears that someone is watching them.\n\n\nViki and Dorian talk about their families.  Dorian informs Viki that Kevin broke off his engagement to Kelly. At that moment, Clint finds them and says that Kelly and Duke are both in the ER.\n\n\nJohn insists that Natalie stay in bed.  The two share a tender moment, but then John informs Nat that he is going to Thailand to find David. Natalie worries what John will do once he finds him.  John answers that he will probably end up beating David until he tells him the details behind the shooting.  Natalie tells him that if he goes, she won't be waiting for him when he comes back.  She begs him to have David extradited, and bring him down through the system.  John refuses, saying it is something he has to do.  Later, John books a flight for the next day, and contacts someone for a concealable weapon.\n\n\nAntonio realizes that Jessica never really came out and that Tess lied to save his life.  He is angry at first, but then relents, even telling her he understands her and Nash's desire to take the baby to a hotel for one night and be alone, as long as they move into Asa's the following day.  Later, Tess brings the baby to Antonio's room and lets him hold her.  They seem to be reaching some common ground.\n\n\nDuke and Kelly are rushed into the hospital.  Kevin must deal with the fact that they could both die-and that they had sex.  Kevin tells his father what has been going on between Kelly and Duke.  Later, he stumbles into the operating room where Spencer and Michael are working to save them.  Doctors force him back out into the hallway, where he hears an EMT gossiping about the way Kelly and Duke were found.  Kevin loses his temper and attacks him.  Clint pulls him off.  Spencer then tells Kevin that Kelly and Duke are suffering from the same injuries, and both need to be operated on immediately.  Unfortunately, Spencer is the only doctor on the east coast who has ever been able to successfully perform the procedure.  He worries that while he operates on one patient, the other will likely die.  Kevin must choose whose life will be spared: the love of his life Kelly, or his son Duke's.\n\n\n",
