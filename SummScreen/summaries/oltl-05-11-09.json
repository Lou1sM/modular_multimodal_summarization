The mere mention of a possible kiss bothered Nora and she insisted that they put an end to the discussion. As the two agreed to conclude the conversation and shared a friendly hug, Clint appeared and questioned what was going on between his girlfriend and his brother. \n\n\nCiting that he had witnessed several close moments between the two, Clint admitted that he was embarrassed by the jealousy he felt, but expressed his concern that Nora and Bo were becoming too close. Nora was horrified when Bo confessed that he had almost kissed Nora. While he commended Bo for his honesty, Clint chastised Nora for failing to be truthful. After defending Nora, Bo blurted out that he was bothered by Clint's decision to date his ex-wife. Bo's revelation caused an intense argument between the brothers. \n\n\nCole encountered Matthew at the front door of the Buchanan Mansion. Aware that Cole still harbored guilt over the accident, Matthew attempted to ease the tension by making jokes about his handicap, but the sight of Matthew caused Cole great pain. Rachel approached and noticed the tense environment. After pulling Cole aside, Rachel told him that Matthew had accepted what had happened and was trying to move on with his life. Rachel advised Cole to do the same. \n\n\nAfter Cole had left, Rachel wondered what was bothering Matthew. Matthew told Rachel that he had asked a friend to the dance, but she turned him down. Matthew said that his friend refused to go with him because he had treated her badly. Rachel encouraged her brother to enjoy his teen years and go to the dance alone. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Bo and Clint continued to argue. Matthew and Rachel entered and announced that Matthew was going to the dance. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian overheard Langston tell Starr that she had plans to have sex with Markko after the prom. Upon learning that Lola had alerted Dorian of her plans, Langston lashed out at Lola. A humiliated Lola listened as Langston advised her that Markko was Langston's boyfriend and that he would never want anything to do with Lola. After Lola stormed out of the room, Langston turned her attention to Dorian. Langston informed Dorian that she was going to have sex with Markko and that Dorian couldn't do anything to prevent it from happening. \n\n\nUsing Starr as an example, Dorian argued why it would be a mistake for Langston to embark in a sexual relationship. Annoyed, Langston attempted to prove to Dorian that she was responsible and detailed how she had prepared for her special night with Markko, including booking a suite at the Palace. Insisting that she was in love with Markko, Langston begged Dorian to trust her. \n\n\nLater, Langston was shocked when Dorian presented her with condoms. Expressing her love for Langston, Dorian told her daughter that she trusted her. Pleased by Dorian's change of heart, Langston promised to be careful. Afterward, Langton told Starr about her conversation with Dorian. Although she was thrilled by Dorian's decision to trust her, Langston admitted that the night would be perfect if Starr attended the prom. \n\n\nRay chastised Lola for continuing to interfere in Langston's relationship with Markko. Lola shouted, \"Why does everyone else in the world get to be happy but me!\" Ray warned his daughter to stop hurting others. He encouraged Lola to develop an interest in another boy and to stop focusing on Markko. In tears, Lola shouted, \"I just want a boyfriend!\" \n\n\nLater, Lola posted a blog on a popular Internet site. Set on revenge, Lola announced that she planned to get even with her cousin. \n\n\nIntent on purchasing a package of condoms for his big night, Markko arrived at the local drug store. Markko's plans were derailed when he ran into his mother's friend, who was working part-time as the store sales clerk. Markko was too embarrassed to purchase his supplies from a family friend and called Cole for assistance. \n\n\nWhen Cole arrived on the scene, Markko explained his dilemma and asked his friend to make the purchase for him. Once Cole agreed to help, Markko applauded him for remaining drug-free. To Markko's surprise, Cole confessed that he tricked Markko into taking his drug test for him and that he had only recently stopped taking drugs. Cole admitted that he was an addict and begged Markko to forgive him. Accepting Cole's apology, Markko expressed regret that he hadn't been able to help his friend. \n\n\nInspired by Cole's confession, Markko decided to accept responsibility and purchase his own condoms. Before walking off, Markko mentioned that he wished that Cole and Starr would attend the prom together. Afterward, a nervous Markko headed to the counter to confront his mother's friend. \n\n\nCole turned to walk away and bumped into a customer. The collision caused the contents of the customer's bag to fall to the ground. As he helped her retrieve the items, Cole noticed that the woman had dropped a bottle of prescription drugs. Although he was tempted, Cole decided to do the right thing and returned the pills to their rightful owner. \n\n\nJack panicked when he discovered T\u00e9a and his parents lying unconscious on the living room floor. After determining that they were still alive, Jack reached for Todd's phone to call for help. Before Jack could make the call, Powell entered the house dressed as a paramedic. When Powell refused to help the victims, Jack realized that the stranger was responsible. \n\n\nJack attempted to run upstairs to rescue Sam, but Powell restrained him. Seconds later, Rebecca walked downstairs cradling Sam in her arms. Rebecca told Jack that they had no intention of hurting him or Sam. They said to do exactly as he was told and no one would get hurt. \n\n\nAs Powell held onto Todd's phone, Starr placed a call to her father. Upon realizing that Starr was the caller, Powell warned Jack to do as he was told to ensure that no one was hurt. Jack lied to Starr and made up an excuse why she couldn't talk to their parents. Informing her that Todd was taking the family out for the night, Jack insisted that Starr remain at La Boulaie. Before hanging up, Jack told his sister that he loved her. Jack's statement left Starr stunned. \n\n\nPowell revealed that the boys would stay at the house with Rebecca, and the adults would be leaving with Powell. While Rebecca held Sam, Jack watched helplessly as Powell dragged his parents and T\u00e9a, one by one, out of the house. Powell told the boys goodnight and advised them to mind Aunt Rebecca. Rebecca asked Powell, \"When will you be back?\" Powell replied, \"When it's over!\" Rebecca assured the boys that everything would be fine.\n\n\n",
