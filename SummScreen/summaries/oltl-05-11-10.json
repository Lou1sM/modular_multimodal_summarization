    "soap_central": "\n\nIn New Mexico, Rex asked Bo over the phone how he was feeling. Bo said he was all right, then asked how Rex's search was going. Rex confided that he thought the jewelry maker knew more than he was letting on, but then got distracted as Gigi walked out of the bathroom in a towel. Later, Rex returned to the hotel room with coffee for himself and Gigi, still clad only in a towel. Rex said that he would take a shower and then they could leave. \"For the airport?\" asked Gigi. Rex replied that they were going back to the jewelry store, and he hoped Gigi would go with him. After Gigi accepted, Rex went into the bathroom, saying that he was taking a cold shower.\n\n\nRex and Gigi arrived at the jewelry shop and found that it was closed. Gigi suggested that they get some food and then return. She asked Rex if he was thinking about breaking in. \"I'm not thinking about it. I'm doing it,\" he replied. Inside the shop, Rex noticed the locked drawer in Otto's desk. Gigi made sure the coast was clear, and Rex picked the lock. He opened the drawer to find the locked box with the same running water symbol carved into it as the necklace had.\n\n\nAt the diner, Nora asked Matthew if he had ordered Dani's corsage yet. He hadn't, but only because Dani didn't know the color of her dress. Nora gave him money for the corsage when Starr arrived and asked to speak with Nora about how to get Cole out of jail. Bo told Matthew that they should give the ladies a minute to talk, so they got up from the booth. Nora informed Starr that the only way Cole could get out was to prove that Todd had paid off the judge, but Starr truly believed that her father was innocent of everything for which he was being blamed. Nora reasoned that it was natural for Starr to want to believe her father, but Starr insisted that Hannah was lying in order to break up her and Cole.\n\n\nOn the other side of the diner, Matthew scoffed as Nate walked in. Bo wondered if Matthew had a problem with Nate, which Matthew denied. Nate noticed Matthew and asked if he wanted to practice lines, which Matthew agreed to do. After running some lines, Nate expressed how nervous he was to take a girl that he didn't even know to the prom. He suggested that Matthew and Dani double date with Nate and Whitney.\n\n\nChanging the subject, Matthew asked why he saw Nate gave Dani a phone. Nate explained that she was in the park one night, got upset, and broke her phone after throwing it. He was surprised that Dani never mentioned the meeting to Matthew since \"nothing happened.\" Matthew got up from the table, and left Nate alone. Nate thought back to the kiss he shared with Dani and smiled.\n\n\nT\u00e9a, on the phone with a doctor, was adamant about refusing any kind of treatment because it was still a death sentence. Dani entered and T\u00e9a asked how much she had heard. Dani replied that she had heard enough to know that her mother was in trouble. She continued that, if Todd could get the death penalty, her mother's job would be way more difficult. Dani then said that she had to leave for school or she would be late. T\u00e9a stopped her daughter and said she would give her a note because there were \"special circumstances\" that were more important than school.\n\n\nDeciding at the last minute not to tell Dani about her tumor, T\u00e9a realized that the prom was later that night and Dani had no dress. As Dani thought about kissing Nate in the park, T\u00e9a said that they had to go shopping. Later, the pair returned to their room with an armful of dresses. Dani said she would try the dresses on after school, but T\u00e9a insisted that she try them on that minute. Dani acquiesced, but then didn't like what she saw in the mirror. When she finally modeled a pretty purple dress for her mother, T\u00e9a cried, telling her daughter that she wasn't a little girl anymore.\n\n\n\"Wait until Matthew sees you,\" a smiling T\u00e9a told her daughter. She went on about how Dani drove Matthew crazy and that they'd have the time of their lives until Dani yelled that T\u00e9a didn't know anything about her. T\u00e9a asked if something had happened, but before Dani could answer, T\u00e9a received a text message from Todd. Dani told her to go because she knew that her mother wanted to.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Todd was on the phone and trying to find out more about Hannah. Blair walked in and took his phone away. Todd denied the blame for Marty losing her baby, Cole going to jail, and the unfairness of Cole's judge. He related that Starr believed him and demanded that Blair give his phone back. She asked who he was talking about on the phone. Todd explained that Hannah had tried to get Todd to drop the charges against Cole in exchange for her changing her story. Todd began to mouth off about T\u00e9a when Blair yelled at him to leave T\u00e9a alone.\n\n\nTodd replied that T\u00e9a wasn't the one being accused of murder and wondered what could compare to that. Blair thought about her emotional conversation with T\u00e9a and responded that Todd should stop whining because T\u00e9a was raising Dani, who had blown up at T\u00e9a for defending Todd, all by herself. Todd believed that T\u00e9a was too busy to care about whether he lived or died, but did notice that she had been acting strangely. He implored Blair to tell him if something was wrong because it would be too late to do anything about it after the trial started. He reasoned that he and T\u00e9a had a child together so he had a right to know. Blair confirmed Todd's suspicions that something was wrong, but wasn't specific.\n\n\nTodd rationalized that if T\u00e9a needed help it should come from him. Blair suggested that T\u00e9a was too stubborn and probably scared to open up to him. John and another officer entered to take Todd, who begged for another minute with Blair, to lockup. John ordered Todd to get up and get dressed.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at the hospital and ran into Greg's assistant Emily, who thought  that T\u00e9a had reconsidered having treatment. T\u00e9a refused and excused herself to see Todd as he was being taken out of his room in handcuffs. She wanted a release form from his doctor, but John left with Todd in tow anyway. Todd yelled that he had to talk to T\u00e9a as he was taken away. Blair, who was still sitting outside of Todd's room, swore that she didn't tell Todd about T\u00e9a's condition, but he knew that something was wrong. Blair urged her to tell him, but T\u00e9a said she would deal with it in her own way after she got Todd arraigned.\n\n\nMarty asked John if she could borrow a book bag to take some books to Cole. She emptied it out and found a baby-sized Phillies jersey. John apologized and vowed that he didn't mean for her to find it. Marty said an apology wasn't necessary and swore she was okay, but said that the loss would always be there. John suggested that he and Marty try to have another baby once they got the all-clear. Marty couldn't try again so soon and just wanted to be alone to pack up all the baby things the couple had accumulated.\n\n\nJohn left the apartment and arrived at the diner to get Marty some breakfast. Nora asked about Marty and expressed her intent to visit. She took the food and left to go see Marty. John hoped that Nora would know the right thing to say to Marty. John told Bo that he had to get to work and that he couldn't wait for Bo to return to the station. Matthew returned to his seat next to Bo and voiced his concerns about Dani spending time with Nate. Matthew left the diner to follow Bo's advice to talk to Dani about it.\n\n\nNora arrived at the apartment with food for Marty. Nora knew that it would take time for Marty to get over losing her baby, but Marty didn't think that John really understood. She explained to Nora how John wanted to try to have another child, but she couldn't get over the pain of losing the first one. She showed Nora a stuffed animal that she had gotten for the baby and subsequently got upset. Nora wondered why Marty was doing that to herself, but Marty swore she was just packing things away. Nora wanted to help, but Marty insisted that she would be all right alone. Once alone, Marty sadly packed away baby clothes, toys, and books.\n\n\nNora returned to the diner and told Bo that Marty was broken-hearted, and needed some alone time. She then reminded Bo that they had a \"mission at city hall\" to take care of. Both felt that they had never been happier.\n\n\nAlone in her room, Dani tried on another dress. She looked in the mirror and imagined Matthew holding her hand. Matthew turned into Nate and Dani smiled. After changing out of the dress, Matthew arrived and wanted to talk to Dani about her seeing Nate at the park. Matthew said that Nate told him nothing happened between the two, but that the statement was out of the blue. Dani confessed to Matthew that she and Nate had kissed.\n\n\nCole returned to his jail cell from the shower to find a drawing done by Hope that said, \"Miss you, Daddy.\" Hannah arrived and asked about Starr. Cole told her that he wasn't there when Starr had been there, but he didn't really want to talk about her anyway. Hannah informed Cole that Todd had threatened to kill her the day before. Cole questioned why she went to see Todd. She confessed that she did it for Cole. Because she couldn't stand watching him being dragged away, she went to Todd to ask him to drop the charges against Cole. It only made Todd angry, and he told her that people who crossed him were never heard from again.\n\n\nCole reassured Hannah by telling her that Todd was just trying to scare her, and that she could have police protection if she wanted it. As Hannah put her hand on Cole's, she said that she wanted to do what Starr wouldn't do for him. Just then, Starr entered and asked if the two wanted to be alone. She thought they were just friends, but she had caught them holding hands. She wondered what lies Hannah was telling to Cole. Hannah decided to leave, and Cole thanked her for everything she had done for him.\n\n\nStarr inquired why he was thanking Hannah but Cole told her that Todd had threatened Hannah, and that she had asked Todd to drop the charges. Starr retorted that she was trying to help Cole the right way by talking to Nora. She explained that there was nothing to be done unless it could be proven that Todd had paid the judge off. Cole wanted Starr to make Todd admit to it, but Starr knew Todd didn't do it. Each accused the other of lying to themselves. Through Cole's protests, Starr left the jail.\n\n\nOn the way to the holding cells, Todd was yelling about suing the Llanview Police Department for brutality. As Cole looked at Hope's drawing, he heard the unlocking of a cell. Todd was put in the cell right across from Cole.\n\n\nAs Hannah was about to walk into the diner, Starr angrily called her name and grabbed her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hannah knows just how to drive another wedge between Starr and Cole by telling Cole that Todd threatened her and revealing that Starr told the secret he trusted her not to reveal about Hanna's overdose, to Todd of all people so he can use it against Hannah to discredit her testimony. Starr is angry with Cole for believing and trusting Hannah and vilifying her. It looks like Cole is stuck in jail. Todd is also going to spend time in jail after he's released from the hospital. But Blair knows that he must be told that Tea is dying before it's too late and she wonders what to do. Tea still has not told either Dani or Todd that she is dying and Dani wonders why she is so emotional when she sees her in her prom dress. Dani also has a dilemma about whether she's interested in Matthew or in Nate. Rex and Gigi are determined to unravel the mystery in Santa Fe about the necklace that was left with him when he was abandoned as a baby.",
