Knowing that he won't be able to talk John out of doing whatever he's planning to do, Bo takes a more subtle tact, reminding John of all that he's accomplished with Dr. Crosby and of the dangers of acting irrationally.  John maintains that he is simply going after justice.  He refuses to divulge the specific information regarding who killed his father, or even whether or not he has to go out of the country to find the person.  Bo does insist that John leave his weapon behind, and he reminds John that he's there for him; John can call him if he feels like he is about to make a decision that will change his life forever.  John makes one request of Bo: that he check in on Natalie.  Bo says that he would have done that anyway.  John leaves a message for Natalie on her cell phone, then takes off for the airport.\n\n\nNatalie has made up her own mind as to what she's going to do to help John.  She has a bedside chat with Michael about the state of her health, but she has no intention of \"taking it easy.\"  Viki also makes a visit to Natalie's bedside in order to fill her in on Duke, Kelly, and Antonio's injuries.  After Viki leaves, Natalie sneaks out of the hospital.  We see John on the airplane, ready to take off for Thailand, when suddenly a voice says, \"Is this seat taken?\"  It's Natalie, having staggered onto the plane with her crutches in order to go to Thailand with John!\n\n\nIn Thailand, David Vickers is becoming increasingly desperate.  He and Margaret have made their way to an internet cafe, where David tries to log online to show Mags some pertinent information.  The internet connection goes down, and David becomes increasingly frustrated.  He wants to make Margaret remember her baby, but her memory has been completely erased.  She says Todd's name aloud, but nothing comes back to her.  When Margaret asks David if she really did cruel things to Todd, he hedges and tells her that sometimes good people do bad things.  Finally, the connection comes back and David logs online to a newspaper article: he points out Margaret's picture, and she realizes that she and her baby are believed to be dead!  Meanwhile, Denton stands outside the cafe, ready to do Spencer's bidding.  He holds a gun in his hand and points it through the window at Margaret and David.\n\n\nSpencer and Michael work frantically to save Kelly's life.  Spencer wants Michael to pay close attention to the experimental procedure, reminding him that if another doctor in the hospital could perform it, then Duke's life would not be in danger.  Outside the operating room, Dorian lashes out at Blair when Blair asks where Kevin is.  Dorian says that Kelly's life is in danger because of Kevin.  When Blair rushes to his defense, Dorian reveals that Kelly and Duke were found naked and entwined.  Blair is shocked, remembering her own words to Kevin when she assured him that Kelly would never cheat on him.  Seeing a moment of shock on her niece's face, Dorian insists that she tried to warn Kelly away from Kevin for years.  Dorian wants to know when her girls are finally going to start listening to her advice about the horrible men in their lives.\n\n\nViki comforts Clint, telling him that an angel has looked out for their family many times in the past; she prays that that angel is looking out for Duke.  Meanwhile, Kevin finally manages to suppress his rage at Duke's portrayal and sit at his son's bedside.  He holds Duke's hand and demands that his son hold on.  As Kevin's tears flow, Duke wakes up for a split second and tells his dad that he is sorry.  Kevin says \"don't worry, buddy\" and tries to comfort his son, but suddenly Duke begins to flatline!\n\n\nSpencer emerges from the operating room to tell Dorian and Blair that Kelly has made it through the surgery alive.  He demands that Duke be prepped for surgery.\n\n\nIn his prison cell, Todd has nightmares about Blair and Margaret.  He dreams that Blair finally accepts the truth about him but says that she can never be with him again, because he doesn't forgive people.  \"I'll forgive you,\" he hollers to Blair, but she runs out of his dream and Margaret comes into it.  Margaret presses her body against him, telling him that she is going to free him from death row.  Todd wakes up, apparently thinking that Margaret's presence in his dream was some sort of sign.  He demands to make a call to Evangeline, but the guard reminds him that this is against the rules.  Instead, the guard hands Manning his calendar and suggests that he check another day off ... Todd insists that something will happen to set him free before his execution.\n\n\n",
