    "soap_central": "\nStarr's and Stripes\n\n\nStacy stopped short when she saw Rex in nothing but a towel. Rex was getting ready for Jared's bachelor party. Stacy took advantage of the opportunity to drop her robe and shout out, \"Oh my God! Don't turn around!\" Reflexively, Rex immediately turned to find Stacy standing in the doorway without a stitch of clothing. Rex looked away in the next instant. Stacy claimed that she had thought that Rex had left for the party. \n\n\nLater, after they were both dressed, Stacy made small talk while Rex gathered a few of his things. She asked Rex where Jared's party would be held. Stacy was stunned when Rex revealed the party was at Rodi's. Stacy asked if Gigi would be working. Rex revealed that it was Gigi's night off. \n\n\nStacy then changed the subject to Natalie's bachelorette party. When she asked Rex what she could expect from the party, Rex realized that he had forgotten to line up a stripper for Jared's party. He asked if Stacy could fill in. Stacy seemed taken aback by the question. Rex took Stacy's hesitancy as a sign that she would rather attend Natalie's party. Rex rescinded his offer then left. \n\n\nMoments later, Gigi called to talk to Shane. Stacy told Gigi that Shane was out with Noelle and Moe. Stacy appeared to take delight in telling Gigi that Shane was heartbroken because his mother had been unfaithful. When Stacy discovered that Gigi was at work, Stacy had a change of plans. \n\n\nCharlie and Jared arrived at Rodi's for Jared's bachelor party. Jared was annoyed when he noticed that Brody was working at the bar. Jared warned Brody that Rex had been invited to the party. Shortly afterwards, Jared discovered that Gigi was also working. One of the waitresses had called in sick with the flu, so Gigi had been asked to cover the shift. \n\n\nBo and Clint walked into Rodi's a short time later. Clint asked if Bo had feelings for Nora. Bo admitted that he did care for Nora, but he equated those feelings to what Clint and Viki had shared since their own divorce. Bo suggested that perhaps Clint wasn't ready to commit to Nora and was using Bo's relationship with Nora as an excuse to avoid facing the truth. \n\n\nGigi pulled Michael aside to ask him how long before Shane was considered out of the woods. Michael explained that it would be months before they could consider Shane in remission. However, Michael assured Gigi that Shane was doing fine. Michael pointed out that Stacy could donate more stem cells if Shane needed another transplant. \n\n\nRex was less than pleased when he walked into Rodi's and spotted Gigi and Brody working. Rex focused on telling Charlie that they didn't have a stripper for Jared's party. Unfortunately for Rex, Charlie misunderstood what Rex had been trying to say. Charlie announced that the party was ready to get started. \n\n\nThe cake was brought out and, to Rex's surprise, Stacy popped out. Stacy did a striptease routine during which she paid special attention to Rex. It didn't escape Gigi's notice. Later, Bo suggested that Rex work things out with Gigi. Bo observed that Rex and Gigi clearly loved each other. \n\n\nMichael asked Bo if he had heard from John. Michael was worried because his brother had not been in contact with anyone, which was unlike John. Bo was equally concerned about John. \n\n\nStan showed up at Rodi's looking for Stacy. Stan threatened to expose her theft to Rex if she didn't return the money immediately. Rex approached the two and asked if there was a problem. To Stacy's relief, Stan left without spilling Stacy's secret to Rex. \n\n\nAt Ultra Violet, Viki advised Jessica to tell Natalie that Jessica and Brody were secretly dating. Viki was certain that Natalie would be happy for Jessica. Jessica insisted that she couldn't make her relationship with Brody public. \n\n\nRoxy, Marcie, and Natalie arrived at the party a short time later. Marcie embarrassed Nora by announcing that she had caught Nora and Bo in the school parking lot, spying on Matthew. Marcie admitted that at first she had mistaken Nora and Bo for a couple of teens making out in a car. \n\n\nNatalie stepped away to call Jared. While the two talked about their parties, Kyle Lewis walked into Ultra Violet. When the stripper for Natalie's party arrived, Kyle offered the man a deal. Later, Kyle stepped on stage as the stripper. He used the opportunity to make Natalie squirm by hinting that he would reveal her secret if she didn't agree to pay him off. \n\n\nAfter Kyle left the dance floor, Natalie called Jared. She told him that Kyle had given her until the following day to come up with the money or else he would tell Jessica that Chloe was Starr's baby. Roxy was concerned about Kyle's presence at the party. Kyle told Roxy to relax; he was after much bigger fish than Roxy and Stacy. \n\n\nMarcie and Jessica talked about Hope. Marcie told Jessica that Hope's body would be exhumed for DNA testing. Jessica had a flash of memory from the night she gave birth to Chloe. Jessica recalled wondering why her baby wasn't crying. \n\n\nViki confided to Nora that Clint admitted he felt unnecessary because Nora always turned to Bo. Nora confessed that it was easy to turn to Bo because he understood exactly what she was going through with Matthew. Nora reminded Viki of the times that Viki and Clint had turned to each other when their children had been in crisis. Viki understood what Nora was saying, but it didn't change how Clint felt. \n\n\nNora was wracked with guilt because she felt as if she were tearing Bo and Clint apart. Viki asked how Nora felt about Bo. Before Nora could reply, Clint walked into Ultra Violet. Nora was stunned when Clint approached them, got down on bended knee, then proposed marriage to Nora. \n\n\nJared arrived at Ultra Violet to warn Natalie that he had overheard Bo on the phone with a judge during the bachelor party. Natalie was shocked to learn that they were exhuming the body of Jessica's baby for DNA testing. Jared worried that it was just a matter of time before the truth about the baby switch was exposed. \n\n\nMarkko arrived at La Boulaie to pick Langston up for the prom. Dorian invited Markko into the living room. In the guise of asking questions about the prom, Dorian revealed enough for Markko to realize that Dorian knew about his plans with Langston after the prom. To Markko's surprise, Dorian didn't yell at him. She told Markko to make Langston's first time special, or else he would have to answer to Dorian. Markko assured Dorian that he loved Langston deeply and that the night was special for him. \n\n\nWhile Starr helped Langston get ready for the prom, they talked. Starr told Langston about the decision to have Hope's body exhumed. Starr explained that they hoped to learn why Hope had died. Langston couldn't understand why Dr. Joplin had given Starr a lock of hair from another baby. Langston wondered if Starr had told Schuyler. Starr admitted that she had realized that her feelings for Schuyler weren't real. Starr also revealed that she had helped Cole detoxify from drugs. \n\n\nLangston was hopeful that things would work out between Cole and Starr. Starr cautioned Langston not to get too far ahead of herself; Starr was just happy to have the old Cole back. Talk of Cole led to talk of Markko. Langston showed Starr the French condoms that Dorian had given her. Neither girl was aware that Lola was eavesdropping on their conversation from the hallway. Lola was livid when she heard that Dorian had given Langston condoms. \n\n\nWhen Lola heard Starr usher Langston into the bathroom to fix Langston's hair for the prom, Lola snuck into the room. Lola quickly rummaged through Langston's purse until she found the condoms. Lola took the thin silver case of condoms back to her room. With the web cam recording, Lola ranted about Dorian's permissiveness. Lola decided to teach Langston and Markko a lesson for life. Lola took a pin then proceeded to poke holes into the condoms. \n\n\nLater, while Dorian took pictures of Langston and Markko in the living room, Lola returned the condoms to Langston's purse. A short time later, Lola's date arrived to pick her up for the prom. Lola didn't want anyone to know that Asher was her date, so she left the house with Asher before they were seen. \n\n\nAfter Langston and Markko left for the prom, Starr noticed that Dorian was down. Starr invited Dorian to a girl's night in. Dorian decided to make hot chocolate, with an extra kick in Dorian's cup. While Starr waited for Dorian to return, Marcie called. Marcie told Starr that Hope's body was being exhumed that very night.\n\n\n",
