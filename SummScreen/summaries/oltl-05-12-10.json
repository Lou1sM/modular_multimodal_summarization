Matthew was floored, but Danielle said she'd been confused and frightened after Todd's near-death experience at the hospital; she'd gone to the park while struggling with her emotions, and Nate had been there to comfort her and make her feel safe.  She insisted that the impulsive kiss hadn't meant anything, and that Matthew meant far more to her.  Matthew asked if that meant that she didn't like Nate.\n\n\nDanielle said Nate was just a friend, but Matthew was unconvinced - he'd texted Danielle that night, but she hadn't replied, as she was with Nate instead.  Danielle swore that she would have called Matthew if she'd seen his messages, and apologized for not being more upfront.  \"I don't deserve you,\" she murmured.  Softening, Matthew told her it was all right; she was going through tough times, and he was sure she wasn't really into Nate.  Danielle reiterated that Nate meant nothing to her.\n\n\nMatthew asked if she still wanted to go to prom with him, and Danielle said yes, pointing out the new dresses strewn across the suite.  Matthew asked which one she'd wear that night, and Danielle said it would be a surprise.  Danielle told him she'd see him at rehearsal after school.  Matthew thanked Danielle for giving him the truth, and said he couldn't stay mad at her.  Danielle promised to kiss only him from then on, and the teens shared a smooch, but after saying their goodbyes, both kids seemed troubled on either side of the door.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Blair confronted T\u00e9a about her unwillingness to undergo treatment for her tumor.  T\u00e9a reminded Blair that her condition was terminal, something she couldn't do anything about, whereas Danielle and Todd still needed her.  \"That tumor has already scrambled your brains!\" Blair snapped.  She begged T\u00e9a to let her help, and asked her rival what she needed to accomplish so badly that she wouldn't fight for her life.\n\n\nT\u00e9a said she needed to make sure Danielle was cared for after she was gone, and that Danielle and Todd were able to forge a loving relationship.  Blair admitted that getting Danielle and Todd to become BFF would be hard work, and it wouldn't happen that night; in the meantime, she urged T\u00e9a to be with Danielle, and let Todd sweat out a night in jail where he generally belonged.  She suggested T\u00e9a use the treatment to buy some time to achieve her goals, and take an evening to rest and regain her strength.  T\u00e9a resisted Blair's ministrations, until Blair put her appeal another way, and asked what she'd say if Danielle or Todd were sick.  Blair asked if T\u00e9a would tell them to fight, or to give up as she wanted to do.\n\n\nT\u00e9a said she wasn't giving up, just prioritizing, but it all meant the same thing to Blair.  She said she'd never known T\u00e9a to give up on anything, and pushed her to stay in the game.  T\u00e9a said it was a pointless endeavor, but Blair insisted miracles could happen.  T\u00e9a grew maudlin as she recalled her pre-prom shopping spree with Danielle, and how they'd spent a decent day together for the first time in ages; she refused to give those kind of perfect moments up for a fruitless ordeal in a hospital bed.  Blair said she understood tough times between a mother and a daughter, but that Danielle deserved all the time T\u00e9a could give her, and suggested that Danielle would want her to fight if T\u00e9a had offered her the choice.\n\n\nBlair gave T\u00e9a an ultimatum: She had twenty-four hours to spend with Danielle enjoying preparation for prom, then reporting to the hospital in the morning for treatment, otherwise Blair would spill the beans about her illness.  T\u00e9a was outraged by Blair's blackmail, but her nemesis had no regrets.  Stymied, T\u00e9a quickly scheduled her appointment with Greg's colleague.  A triumphant Blair followed her down the hospital corridor, nagged her not to bail out Todd yet, and ordered her to focus on Danielle for the night.  T\u00e9a grudgingly agreed, but pointedly withheld Blair's requested hug or \"thank you\" as she strolled into the elevator.\n\n\nOutside the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Starr latched onto Hannah's arm, and was determined to confront her about her lies.  Hannah struggled to wriggle away, but Starr wouldn't budge.  \"I'll let go of you when you let go of Cole,\" she declared.  She said Hannah was messing with her family and playing Cole, but explained that Hannah had made a fatal mistake by attempting to work Todd; he'd be out of jail soon, thanks to T\u00e9a.  \"Her specialty's saving my dad,\" Starr said coldly. \"She lives for it.\"\n\n\nStarr warned Hannah to leave her family alone or suffer the consequences.  Playing the innocent, Hannah asked if Starr was threatening her.  Feigning concern for Starr's mental health and her relationship with Cole, Hannah reminded Starr that she'd made mistakes as well; by telling Todd about Hannah's suicide attempt, she'd broken Cole's trust and betrayed him.  She offered to \"help\" Starr and Cole find their way back together, and Starr called her insane.  Hannah said she'd only told the truth, then asked a hypothetical question. She wondered who the guilty party could possibly be if Todd hadn't pushed Marty down the stairs.\n\n\nAs Hannah taunted her about the mystery, Starr reached a sickening conclusion - she accused Hannah of pushing Marty because Hannah knew that she could frame Todd and create a rift between Starr and Cole.  Hannah swiftly denied it and told Starr that she wasn't only losing perspective; she was also losing Cole.  Commenting on the sadness of her \"friends'\" breakup, Hannah gave Starr her backhanded best wishes.  \"Have fun at prom,\" she cooed, then entered the Buenos Dias.\n\n\nAt the police station, Todd confronted Cole as John ushered him into the cellblock.  Noting that he was in the cell adjacent to Cole's, Todd assured John he wasn't concerned, and said he had nieces more scary than the teen; in fact, he said John knew one of them all too well, and declared that McBain would dump Marty for Natalie in no time flat with the baby out of the equation.  As Cole raged at Todd from his cell, John attempted to calm the boy, but Todd was eager to goad his enemies, and said T\u00e9a would spring him soon.\n\n\nTodd and Cole began to trade barbs, but Todd held the trump card when he revealed that Hannah had visited him at the hospital, and was looking to make a deal.  While Cole derided Todd's claim as a fantasy, John's interest was immediately piqued.  Todd dismissed Cole as \"about as smart as a box of hair,\" and explained how Hannah had attempted to strike a bargain on her testimony in exchange for Cole's freedom.  Cole refused to believe it, singing his friend's praises, but John grew curious.  Todd said Cole had a crazy girl trying to get in his pants, and that the police were wasting time believing her tall tale while Marty's true attacker covered his tracks.\n\n\nJohn asked Todd who he thought could have pushed Marty.  Todd said it could've been anyone, even John's beloved, temperamental Natalie, and said the evidence against him - fibers from a blue jacket - was barely there.  Putting on a confident front, John attempted to dismiss Todd's allegations, but Todd told him they both knew the Llanview Police Department had the wrong man.  As John turned to leave, Cole assured him that \"Hannah's okay.\"  Silent, John exited the cellblock, and left Todd and Cole to their own dubious devices.\n\n\nAfter John left, Todd, anxious to call T\u00e9a and make bail, called for a guard.  When no one responded, Cole jeered that perhaps T\u00e9a was tired of saving her ex's hide.  Cole said that Starr wanted to believe in Todd, but she had no evidence to defend him; Todd was a murderer, and he was going to fry.  Firing back, Todd called Cole an \"ignorant punk,\" a fool who'd lost Starr by believing a \"psycho skank's\" word.  He said he'd be free soon, but Cole would rot on his assault charges, and Starr would never forgive him for what he'd done.\n\n\nOver at Foxy Roxy's, Natalie, who was back from London, entered and reunited with Roxy.  But Natalie had surprising news: she'd liked London so much she'd decided to stay, and she was leaving that night.  Horrified, Roxy told her surrogate daughter she couldn't leave for somewhere so far away.  Natalie said she needed a change, and wanted to be in London with Kevin, Joey, and Cord.  Roxy said it was more than that, and accused Natalie of wanting to escape, to run away from her troubles with John.\n\n\nNatalie admitted that she hated seeing John and holding onto the feelings she still had.  Roxy pleaded with her to stay and said that John would realize he couldn't run from the power of their love. Roxy said Natalie needed to fight for him.  Natalie said it wasn't that simple, and that John had chosen Marty, but Roxy said that the baby's death, while tragic, had severed the last tie between John and Marty.  Natalie refused to stay, and said that baby or no baby, she couldn't take another rejection and humiliation.\n\n\nRoxy realized Natalie hadn't told John about her London plans and urged her to do so, but Natalie wasn't about to put her life on hold for another round of \"John makes up his mind.\"  Roxy asked what would happen if she told him then and there, that night.  Natalie didn't want to give John an ultimatum, but Roxy said she didn't have to, and urged Natalie to put her feelings in a letter, then deliver it to the police station; if John wanted her, he could find her before she flew overseas.\n\n\nNatalie agreed to Roxy's proposal, and wrote her fateful letter.  As she finished it, Roxy reviewed it and called it genius, but told Natalie to add a \"rendezvous point,\" somewhere for John to meet her if he returned her feelings.  Roxy had the perfect choice, and suggested they meet at Rodi's at midnight if they wanted a future together.  Natalie dutifully added the rendezvous point to her letter.  \"You can't miss!\" Roxy cheered.\n\n\nIn New Mexico, Gigi and Rex examined Otto's mysterious lockbox, and wondered what secrets it hid.  Gigi had the answer to all their questions, however: a big hammer to smash the box's lock with.  Before she could slam the hammer down, Otto appeared out of nowhere to grab her arm.  Rex and Gigi apologized for breaking in, but begged Otto to show them what was in the box.  Otto promptly accused them of robbery, and ordered Penny to call the police.\n\n\nAs Rex continued to plead for answers about his parents, Otto softened; he told the couple to leave, and he'd tell the cops they'd escaped.  The dynamic duo refused - they knew Otto had the answers they sought, and they'd take their chances with the cops.  When the boys in beige arrived, Gigi and Rex were taken in.  Rex apologized to Gigi for the trouble, but Gigi promised him they'd get out of their latest mess together.\n\n\nAfter Gigi and Rex were carted off, Penny asked Otto if he truly did know the identity of Rex's parents, and urged him to give the visitors the information they were searching for.  \"It's not my place to tell,\" Otto intoned.\n\n\nBack at the Palace, Danielle agonized over her Starr X'd Lovers script, and was shaken by the stage directions indicating her kiss with Nate.  When T\u00e9a returned, Danielle was surprised to learn that her mother had taken off the day from work and Todd's case in favor of a spa day with her daughter.  T\u00e9a informed Danielle they were going to live the beautiful life together in preparation for her first prom.  \"Awesome!\" Danielle cried.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Blair ran into Starr outside Todd's vacant hospital room.  Starr asked where her father was, and Blair reluctantly informed her that he'd been released and arrested by the police.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, John watched from the front window as Hannah sat at the lunch counter and read a copy of the Sun. Todd's words about the evidence rang in his ears as he noticed Hannah's blue coat.  After Hannah walked off, John entered the restaurant and stared at the Sun, featuring an article on Todd with a headline reading \"SCAPEGOAT.\"  Troubled, John recalled what Todd had said about other suspects.\n\n\nAs John stared at the paper, Natalie entered the restaurant and stopped short as she saw her ex.  Beating a hasty retreat, she walked out unnoticed, then sank against the wall.  Remembering Roxy's advice, she clutched her letter.  \"See you later, John,\" Natalie whispered. \"Please show up.\"  With that, Natalie walked away, leaving the unsuspecting John behind. \n\n\n",

Blair stops Tea from leaving the hospital to get Todd out of jail. She advises her to follow through with the treatment for her tumor because she will be no good to Todd or Dani if she dies.
