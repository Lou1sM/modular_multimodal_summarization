Viki called him on his lie, and said she'd heard Clint say that he was dying. Clint denied it, but Viki pleaded that she couldn't take any more lies from her loved ones. Clint admitted that it had been a bad attack, and that the doctor didn't think Clint would bounce back from it.\n\n\nViki suggested a transplant, but Clint didn't think he deserved a miracle like Ben had given to Viki. Clint related that he was just being realistic. Viki wondered who else knew about his condition, to which Clint replied that only she and Bo knew. He hoped it would stay that way. Viki thought it was a mistake to not tell their children. \n\n\nClint said that the kids didn't need to worry about him, because they all had their own problems. Viki disagreed, saying that the kids loved Clint, and they would want to be there for Clint. Clint just wanted to protect them. \"The way you did before?\" Viki reminded him. She informed him that there was no way to hide from the truth, because it always had a way of showing itself.\n\n\nViki implored Clint to let their kids tell Clint how they felt. Viki let him know that they were angry with him, but they didn't want him to die. Viki remembered how good of a father Clint had been \"for so long.\" Viki wondered if he had gotten the way he was because of Bo and Nora. Clint urged her not to try to analyze him, so she recounted all the things he'd done for the kids over the years instead. Viki said he needed his loved ones around. Wiping away tears, Clint agreed to think about it if Viki would drop the subject.\n\n\nViki stiffened when Clint mentioned Charlie, but she updated him on Charlie's whereabouts anyway. Clint thought that the \"jackass\" deserved what he had gotten for breaking Viki's heart. Viki wondered why Clint had agreed to keep Echo's secret. Clint replied that he had tried to be decent. Viki wondered how Dorian had gotten the recording from Clint, but then decided that she didn't want to know.\n\n\nBrody and Cutter tried to figure out where Wes had gone, but Brody reasoned that no one had any idea what the new alter was capable of. A short while later, Brody entered the room and informed Cutter that the manager of motel hadn't seen anyone of Jessica's description around the area. Cutter tried to call Wes, but no one answered the phone. They knew that they needed to team up, so Brody handed Cutter a list of area bars, and told him to start calling.\n\n\nA short while later, Brody and Cutter had experienced no luck finding Wes. Brody realized that Wes could be at Capricorn, so he called the bar. Cristian answered and confirmed that Wes was there, and \"hitting on every woman here.\" Brody asked Cristian to keep Wes there, and left the motel with Cutter.\n\n\nKelly was put on a stretcher as John assured her that she would be all right. She begged him not to leave. He promised that he would be in his car right behind the ambulance. She was put into the ambulance as John called the police station. He wanted an APB put out on Marty, who he considered armed and dangerous.\n\n\nDorian expressed her happiness that Joey and Aubrey were happy together. She suggested that wedding bells might soon ring for Kelly as well. The thought upset Joey, but Dorian wondered why he cared. He claimed to not have a problem with it, but said that John and Kelly seemed to be moving quickly.\n\n\nCristian walked over to Wes's table as Wes told Rama and Aubrey how \"smokin'\" they were. He began to massage Rama's shoulders as he said that there was \"enough Wes to go around.\" Wes was disappointed to learn that both Rama and Aubrey were married, but said that it didn't put them \"out of the game.\"\n\n\nJoey walked over, surprised to see his sister dressed as a guy, and Dorian followed. Wes told the women that he wasn't going to try to mess up their marriages. Wes called for drinks, to which Cristian replied that he was working on them. Dorian reminded Cristian that he couldn't serve any alcohol to Jessica. Cristian related that was the reason he was taking his time with the drinks.\n\n\nDorian wondered if Viki knew about Wes, so she looked for her phone. Before she could make the call, her phone rang. She answered it to John. He ordered her to get to the hospital immediately. Distressed, Dorian asked what had happened, which Joey overheard. \n\n\nDorian hung up, and Joey asked what had happened. Dorian informed him that Kelly had been stabbed, and was in the emergency room. Cristian promised to watch over Wes, and Joey left for the hospital with Dorian. Rama asked if Aubrey was concerned about Joey running to his ex's bedside. Aubrey claimed to not be worried.\n\n\nWes walked up to the bar and wondered where his drinks were. Cristian informed Wes that, if he drank, he would make a girl named Jessica very sick. Wes turned to \"go somewhere that will take my money,\" but Brody and Cutter entered. Wes explained that he had left earlier than Brody and Cutter to get all the women before they could. However, all the \"good ones\" were married.\n\n\nBrody said that there was only one woman for him. Wes wanted to meet her, but Brody said that he didn't know where she was. Brody showed Wes a picture of him and Jessica on his phone. Wes recognized her as \"the crazy girl from St. Anne's.\" Brody promised Wes that they would go out together, but Brody's phone rang.\n\n\nBrody returned a short while later and said he had to work. He instructed Wes to stay put, but Wes complained about the bartender not serving him. Brody promised to talk to Cristian, because he knew Cristian. On the way out, Brody begged Cristian to keep Wes at Capricorn. He assured the unsure Cristian that he trusted the bartender, and left.\n\n\nCutter asked Aubrey what had happened between her and Joey earlier. She said that they'd agreed to the fact that Cutter was a horrible person. He explained that he and Brody had gotten into a fight in front of Tess, which was what had made Wes emerge. He promised to get Tess back. Realizing that Joey wasn't there, he asked where Joey was. She explained that he had given Dorian a ride to the hospital because Kelly had been hurt. When Cutter said that it looked like Aubrey had chosen the wrong guy, Aubrey declared that she wasn't worried.\n\n\nRama was amused to have met three different people who lived in one body. Cristian informed her that, a year before, Jessica had thought that she was in high school. Cristian explained why he couldn't serve Jessica alcohol, and wondered what to do. Rama suggested serving a virgin drink, but Cristian had an idea. As Wes walked up to the bar, Cristian poured non-alcoholic beer into a glass for him. Cristian said that it was on the house, and Wes chugged it. As Wes passed Aubrey, he told her that Joey's business better have been important to keep her waiting.\n\n\nAt the hospital, John comforted Kelly, and asked if she remembered what had happened. Kelly rasped that Marty had been waiting for her in John's room. Kelly had the knife, but Marty had attacked her and grabbed the knife. Marty had pulled Kelly into the bathroom, and Kelly had suddenly felt lots of pain. He asked where Marty had gone, but the doctor said that Kelly needed rest. Kelly continued anyway, saying that she had heard Natalie enter the apartment.\n\n\nThe doctor told John to wait outside. John kissed Kelly on the head, and left the room. John called Natalie and left a message warning her about Marty. He instructed her to go far away from Angel Square, and to go somewhere safe. He told her to call him back immediately, and hung up.\n\n\nDorian and Joey entered, and asked John how Kelly was doing. He said that the doctor was working. Joey blamed John for what Marty had done to Kelly. John assured him that Kelly would be all right. \"She has to be,\" he said as he walked away. John called the police station and demanded that they keep searching for Marty, and to not stop until she was in custody.\n\n\nA short while later, the doctor exited Kelly's room. He explained that Kelly wasn't conscious, but was getting blood transfusions, and would soon be in surgery. Joey wanted to see her, so he went into the room. Joey told Kelly to stick around, because he couldn't imagine his life without her, and didn't want to.\n\n\nDorian was grateful that John had gotten to Kelly when he had. John wanted to look for Marty. He asked Dorian to call him with any updates, and left the hospital. Dorian vowed that Marty would pay for what she had done.\n\n\nMarty and Natalie fought over the knife, knocking things over. Marty got a hold of it and swiped at Natalie, who dodged it. After more struggling near the edge of the roof, Natalie sat with the knife in hand, and Marty nowhere to be found. Natalie was checking on Liam when she heard Marty's cry for help. She found Marty hanging on a gutter at the edge of the roof. Marty said that Natalie had to help her. \"Do I?\" Natalie replied.\n\n\nNatalie continued that Marty had tried to kill her. Marty apologized, but Natalie didn't believe her. Natalie told Marty that Marty deserved to fall, but Cole didn't deserve to lose his mother. The gutter shifted as Natalie tried to find her phone to call for help. Giving up on the search, Natalie climbed to the edge of the roof and grabbed onto Marty's arm. She promised not to let Marty fall. Marty wondered why she should believe Natalie. Natalie countered that she had to trust that Marty wouldn't pull her over the edge, and ordered Marty to trust her.\n\n\nMarty grabbed Natalie's arm, as Marty found something to step on in order to hoist herself up. Natalie pulled Marty onto the roof, and Marty thanked her. Natalie informed Marty that she was still going to tell John what Marty had done. Marty ran at Natalie and pushed her off of the roof. \"No one can take John from me ever again,\" Marty said as she looked over the edge. \"Especially not you.\" Marty threw her arms in the air in victory, and walked away.\n\n\nA short while later, John walked through Angel Square. He noticed someone sprawled on the ground, and recognized the person as Natalie.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Kelly gets rushed to the hospital after getting stabbed by Marty and tells John what happened while still conscious but badly hurt. He then puts out an APB on Marty and warns Natalie that Marty may be after her. Natalie is on the rooftop in a struggle with Marty while baby Liam is there. At the end, Natalie falls or gets pushed down a flight of stairs and is unconscious. As soon as Joey finds out that Kelly has been hurt, he rushes to be with her, forgetting all about Aubrey while at Capricorn. He furiously blames John for what happened to Kelly and reveals he may have always been in love with Kelly. While at Capricorn, Jessica has come out with yet another alter, a male named Wes who was Brody's friend when he was a Navy Seal. \"Wes\" believes he is a male and has \"interest\" in Aubrey and Rama, disappointed to see that they are both married but mindful that neither are with their husbands. Cutter also notices that Joey seems to have abandoned Aubrey for Kelly. She is not happy with him for what he revealed to Joey not only about himself but also the suspicion cast upon her when Cutter revealed that he married Tess to get the Buchanan money. Clint is in his hospital bed talking to Viki who has found out that he is dying. She urges him to reach out to his kids although he tells her there's no point in worrying them when they all have their own lives and cannot do anything to change what has happened to him. She also asks him how it was that he somehow \"gave\" Dorian the taped confession of Echo telling him that she lied to Charlie about Rex being his son when he told her he did not intend to do that and didn't want to break up Charlie and Echo. He remembers Dorian blackmailing him when he was ready to die but does not tell Viki the whole story about what happened.",
