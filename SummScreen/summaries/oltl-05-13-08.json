    "soap_central": "\nA Lyin' In Winter\n\n\nBefore Gigi could glimpse Brody outside her front door, a drunken Rex staggered up to the cottage and barged in. Brody quickly darted out of sight before he could be spotted by either party. Gigi demanded to know why Rex was there and what he wanted. Rex struggled to articulate his feelings, and insisted that he had to see Gigi and tell her \"something.\" Sensing catastrophe, Gigi bristled at Rex's overly affectionate manner and warned him to keep it to himself, nervously reminding him that he was getting married in the morning and urging him to go home. \n\n\nOutside the cottage, Brody watched the tableau through the windows while being urgently text messaged by Adriana. Lonely at La Boulaie, Adriana texted back and forth with Brody, angry to learn that he wasn't with Gigi. When Adriana asked Brody what he was waiting for, Brody texted back: \"[Gigi's] busy.\" \"Who's over there?\" Adriana wondered aloud. Seized with fear, she called Rex's loft, but got no answer. \n\n\nAt Ultra Violet, Talia watched the maintenance crew leave the abandoned club and then snuck into the back to fall into a passionate tryst behind the curtains with Antonio. The lovers were interrupted by an irate Cristian, who reminded them that he'd spent a night in jail for going along with their scheme against Ramsey, and told them not to take further risks in public to jeopardize their \"mission.\" It was apparent that Cristian's fistfight with John over Talia and Antonio had all been part of the con to fool the commissioner. Antonio assured Cris that Ramsey was busy on business in Chicago and wouldn't find out about Antonio and Talia's secret rendezvous. Cris said he didn't like looking over his shoulder, but understood the couple's need to be together, and told them he'd lock the club up behind them for Rex. \"Try to leave before daybreak,\" he cracked, and hit the lights and music on his way out. Antonio and Talia held each other and danced to the music, and Talia said that their love had to be for real if it could withstand the pressures of their months-long ruse. Gathering blankets for the furniture, champagne, and strawberries, Antonio and Talia sank onto a couch and made passionate love. \n\n\nAt Virginia Beach, on the boardwalk, John and Blair asked Winter whether he had seen Starr and Cole, but were interrupted when Todd swooped in, threatening Winter with bodily harm if he didn't come clean. This only agitated Winter further, and he insisted he'd never seen the kids before in his life. As Todd continued to interrogate the teen, Blair ordered Todd to cool it, then asked Todd how he'd found his way to Virginia. Todd explained that he'd talked to Starr on Markko's disposable phone and deduced her location. He continued to hound Winter down the boardwalk, with John and Blair hot on his heels. As Blair and Todd began to bicker, Winter broke off from the adults and made his escape. John warned Todd that he couldn't pressure Winter and that finesse was necessary; he then took off after the teen himself. Todd and Blair fought on as they stalked across the boardwalk in the night, with each of them blaming Starr's flight from home on the other. Blair told Todd that he was out of control, and that Cole was not the problem in this situation-Todd was. Todd insisted he meant his promise to Starr to let her see Cole if she returned home, but Blair was sure he'd been lying. She said he'd broken every promise he'd ever made to their daughter, and told him it was time to grow up, but she was sure it was too late for that. \n\n\nFurther down the boardwalk, John cornered Winter back at the hot dog vendor he and Blair had visited earlier. John took a calmer approach with Winter, saying he knew Winter was lying. John said that he wasn't going to arrest Winter and that he just wanted to find the kids. Winter chose a very careful answer when looking at Blair's picture of the lovers, saying simply that he had never met anyone by the names of \"Starr and Cole.\" John asked how he'd come to be called Winter, and Winter confessed that it was a street nickname, and his real name was in fact 'Eugene Silverstein.' After Winter took off, John made a call to a friend in law enforcement, asking for a credit check on one 'Eugene Silverstein.' \n\n\nAt their apartment, Sarah and Layla laughed about the events of Adriana's bachelorette party, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Cristian, as well as Adriana calling for Layla. Adriana was furious about being unable to reach Rex and told Layla that she was sure he was with Gigi. Layla tried to calm Adriana and assuage her fears, and told her Rex had probably passed out after Bo took him home. Adriana told Layla that Brody had proven useless despite his hefty paycheck, and declared that she was going to Rex's herself to see what had become of him. After Adriana had hung up, Layla asked Cristian and Sarah to \"remind me: Why do people get married?\" She bid the lovebirds goodnight and headed to bed, while Sarah and Cristian cuddled. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston received a text message to open the front door to find Markko waiting for her. Langston warned Markko that he wasn't Dorian's favorite person at that moment, and hustled him into the drawing room. She explained that she'd been busted by Dorian during the abortion clinic fiasco and had had to confess the truth about Starr's pregnancy. Markko made a joke about Langston's \"abortion\"-\"And no one talked to me about this? I fathered the kid!\" Langston wasn't amused, and said that since Dorian knew, everyone would soon. Langston and Markko wished they had some way to warn Starr and Cole about their secret being compromised. Langston admitted to Markko that she'd romanticized Starr's pregnancy in her mind, finding it mature and exciting, but said that at the abortion clinic, she'd found the reality frightening. Markko added that at their young age, he saw an unwanted pregnancy as a \"trap.\" The sweethearts vowed that they'd never repeat Starr and Cole's mistake, and Markko apologized to Langston for his foolish lie to Dorian. They kissed, and Markko assured Langston that everything would be okay. \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Adriana arrived and let herself in, only to find the apartment empty. Fearful, she decided to call Gigi. \n\n\nBack at the cottage, Rex tipsily rambled about having \"something to say\" to Gigi, while Gigi wrestled with her mixed emotions. \"Rex, please don't make me your cold feet,\" she pleaded. She said she didn't want him to blame her should anything go wrong with his wedding to Adriana. Rex assured Gigi he wouldn't, and grew increasingly emotional and touchy-feely as he moved closer to her. As the exes' mutual passion rose, they were interrupted by Shane coming down the stairs, saying hello to Rex. Shane showed Rex his picture of his \"dad,\" and Rex recognized Brody from bumping into him at UV earlier in the evening. While lurking outside, Brody was relieved when Gigi dismissed Rex's sighting as a drunken misunderstanding and shooed Shane to bed. As Rex again tried to tell Gigi why he'd come, the phone rang. Rex ordered her to let the machine get it, and Gigi recognized the number as Adriana's. She insisted Rex go, and he finally relented, stumbling out of the cottage and into the night. \n\n\nOn the boardwalk, John rejoined Todd and Blair and told them they could fight later but had to find shelter for the night. Blair said she wasn't staying with Todd. The trio found a decrepit motel, leading Todd to comment, \"We've slept in worse, haven't we?\" \"Don't remind me,\" Blair replied. \n\n\nRex returned home to the loft to find an uneasy Adriana waiting for him. Adriana said she'd been worried, and Rex lied that he'd just been out for a walk-alone. The two betrothed made awkward small talk, and Rex tried to get Adriana to leave, citing the old wives' tale of it being bad luck to see the groom the night before the wedding. Adriana kissed Rex and said she wanted to make love, then dragged him into bed with her. \n\n\nA tender musical montage played as Antonio and Talia made love at Ultra Violet, Sarah modeled lingerie and then tempted Cristian into her bedroom, Langston told Markko goodnight, and Gigi wept into Rex's jersey (as Brody watched from afar). But back at the loft, Rex and Adriana lay in bed together, chaste, unfulfilled, and miles apart. Adriana told Rex that it was okay that he couldn't perform, blaming it on wedding nerves. Rex hollowly agreed, saying, \"We've got the rest of our lives...when we're married.\" \n\n\nIn Virginia Beach, an infuriated Blair told John and Todd she would take the motel room furthest from her husband, and as Todd left to handle payment, John assured Blair that they'd find Starr and Cole. Blair thanked John and headed off towards the motel, as John pondered where the kids could be. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd finds Blair and John trying to find Starr and Cole at the Virginia amusement park. He informs her that he got a hold of Starr by phone. They had a positive conversation. But Starr disconnected him and is not coming home. Hearing that, Blair believes the reason for that is because Todd blew it with his daughter. Back in Llanview, Langston talks to Markko about what happened when Dorian thought that she, instead of Starr, was pregnant. And they wonder what is going to happen in regard to everything. Adriana knows that Rex has Gigi on the brain and she is not ok with it. He goes to see her at the carriage house. Brody stands outside the door and doesn't get up the courage to go inside.",
