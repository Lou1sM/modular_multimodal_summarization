    "soap_central": "\nDriving Miss Destiny\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Shaun stood guard only to receive his perennial unwelcome visitor, Destiny. Destiny was decked out in her prom dress, pooh-poohing Shaun's dismay. \"Is that any way to speak to this hotness?\" she asked. \"You mean hot mess,\" Shaun shot back. \n\n\nDestiny told Shaun she needed two things from him: their brother's phone number, and a limousine ride to Llanview High. Shaun reminded Destiny she didn't have a prom date, but was shut down when their cousin Tyrone appeared, posing as Destiny's arm candy for the evening. Relenting, Shaun agreed to drive Destiny and Tyrone to the prom. \n\n\nAt Llanview High, the gymnasium was filling up and Prom Night was in full swing. Langston and Markko danced on Cloud 9, drawing the ire of Lola as she arrived with Asher. Asher suggested she do something about her enemies, but Lola promised she was way ahead of him. \n\n\nLocked in a romantic clinch, Langston and Markko danced together. Langston was fired up for their night of passion, while Markko was worried about tarnishing Langston's reputation. Langston told Markko she wasn't ashamed about what people thought of them. She promised Markko their night would be special. \n\n\nJust then, Lola and Asher sidled up, full of taunts. Lola warned Langston and Markko to be careful, and said that as inexperienced virgins, they could wind up pregnant. Langston told Lola off and gave Asher a hard elbow to the ribs, courtesy of Starr. As the two ne'er-do-wells scuttled away, Langston's feistiness only turned Markko on more. Furious, Lola rejected Asher's advances. Asher suggested she find a different kind of relief, and handed her a tab of acid. \n\n\nAt Ultra Violet, Nora was shocked by Clint's sudden proposal. As Viki ushered Roxy and Jessica away, Nora struggled to find the words to answer Clint. Hesitant, she told Clint that it was Natalie's night and said his timing was ill-advised. Clint pressured Nora to speak her mind and stop equivocating, and Nora finally blurted out that she felt like he was negotiating her surrender. \n\n\nClint was outraged when Nora suggested that his proposal was disingenuous, and asked if she thought he didn't want to marry her. \"Not really,\" Nora replied. She said they hadn't been happy of late, all because of his jealousy over Bo. Clint admitted that he'd argued with Bo at the bachelor party at Rodi's about his commitment to Nora, and Nora asked him if he'd gone there to prove something to his brother, or to make her prove something to him. \n\n\n\"Do you love me?\" Clint asked her. He said he knew he'd been an \"unlikable fellow\" in recent months, preoccupied with the family and the business, but said he understood Nora's relationship with Bo, and was through being jealous. He said he wanted to cement their relationship, which had grown into love and partnership, and was ready to prove his commitment to her and Matthew, and even Bo, once and for all. Getting down on one knee again, Clint reiterated his marriage proposal. Touched, Nora mumbled that she'd need a ring. Overjoyed, Clint embraced Nora, who still looked uncertain. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr and Cole returned home, preoccupied with Hope's exhumation and the need for answers. Starr hoped they'd finally know the truth about their daughter's death before the week was out. Changing the subject, Cole asked about Langston and Markko, and \"Operation: Deflower.\" Starr and Cole were surprised to realize they both knew the sordid details, and laughed as they talked about their friends' quest for contraceptives. \n\n\nCole suggested they pay Langston and Markko a visit at the prom, to get their minds off things. He admitted that before the exhumation, he'd planned to ask Starr to attend with him. Bashful, Starr agreed and donned a beautiful party dress, while Cole grabbed a tux for the occasion. Cole helped Starr put a string of jewels around her neck, and noticed it wasn't her \"Hope\" locket. Starr said she wouldn't wear the locket again until they had the truth about Hope. Thanking Cole for his help, Starr left La Boulaie on his arm. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi endured her final minutes on the job as Rex and Stacy sat nearby, eating and talking. Brody walked in hauling a case of expired mayonnaise, and told Gigi he was going to toss it in the garbage. Seething, Gigi found another use for the condiments, spreading the spiked mayo on Stacy's burger. Walking over to Rex and Stacy's table, Gigi served her sister the deadly meal. \n\n\nMunching happily on her burger, Stacy rubbed her burgeoning bond with Rex in her sister's face, suggesting she take Rex out on the town and get his mind off his troubles. As Rex left to get the car, Stacy turned on Gigi and Brody, gloating to them about her predestined romance with Rex. Gigi told Stacy to get out. After Stacy and Rex left, Brody asked Gigi how she could ever have a sister like that. Once Gigi left for the night, Brody called Jessica, asking her to meet him at Rodi's. Jessica agreed. \n\n\nBack at UV, Charlie arrived with the startling news about Hope's exhumation, which surprised Viki and upset Jessica, who flashed back to the night she gave birth. Making her apologies to Viki, she left. \n\n\nOutside the club, Jared and Natalie freaked out at the news of Hope's exhumation. Natalie's mind raced through options as to how to stop it, but Jared said there was no way they could convince Bo to go against Starr and Cole's wishes, and no way Bo would agree to keep Jessica's secret. Natalie said the truth would destroy Jessica, and agonized over how she'd tell her sister Chloe wasn't hers. \"I can't blow up her life again!\" she cried. As Jared calculated the time it would take to dig up Hope and examine the body, he said it was only a matter of hours or days before the police learned the whole truth. \n\n\n\"We have to tell Mom,\" Natalie said, just as Viki, Charlie, and a very drunk Roxy walked outside. Viki asked Jared and Natalie what they had to tell her, and Jared covered, saying they were considering eloping. Roxy was mortified, but Viki and Charlie told the engaged to follow their hearts. \n\n\nAfter their elders left, Natalie told Jared they were running out of time. Jared suggested they do the right thing: give Jessica one last night with Chloe, and then tell the family the truth in the morning, wedding day or no wedding day. Natalie agreed that if the truth was out, they'd have to cancel their wedding anyway. Jared grinned and told Natalie that regardless of what they needed to do, he wouldn't go to bed one more night without his wife. Joining hands, they hurried away. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Jessica arrived to find Brody dancing while mopping, to his eternal shame. Brody noticed Jessica was distracted, and Jessica embraced him. Shaken, she told him that Starr's baby was being exhumed, and that any mention of Hope seemed to inexplicably upset her. She said she was a mess, and wondered how many people would be looking at her at Jared and Natalie's wedding, wondering if she was truly sane. Jessica said she wished Brody could be there with her, walking her down the aisle as the matron of honor. \n\n\nSeizing on an idea, Brody told her to get her bridesmaid dress from the car. Jessica returned to the bar in her dress to find Brody in his Navy whites. Brody said he couldn't be at the wedding, but they could still have a dance together. After putting a coin in the jukebox, Brody took Jessica in his arms. \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy was feeling the effects of food poisoning, vomiting in the bathroom. She emerged in the living room to get a second wind so she could go out and party with Rex. Rex urged her to rest and stay in. Stacy was anxious to take Rex out on the town and get his mind off Gigi and Brody, but Rex said taking care of her took his mind off of them. Seized with another bout of nausea, Stacy rushed back to the bathroom to continue vomiting. \n\n\nAt St. James' Church, Gigi communed with God, and tore into Stacy. She couldn't believe that the Almighty had sent her Stacy to steal Rex and Shane, and said there had to be another way to save Shane's life without destroying her family and her self-respect. Gigi recalled that Viki had told her to fight for her loved ones, and promised to do just that. Growing determined, she said she was through rolling over for Stacy. \n\n\nAt Llanview High, Rachel and Matthew arrived outside the gym. Rachel hoped to keep Matt's spirits up by offering a dance, but Matthew said he couldn't dance with anyone. Just then, Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls waltzed up looking for the gym. Nicole introduced herself as part of the night's entertainment, and flirted with a flustered Matthew, asking if she could be his date. Before saying goodbye, she told Matthew she expected to see him rocking out during her set. \n\n\nAs Matthew struggled to recover from his brush with a Pussycat Doll, Rachel noticed his \"friends,\" Justin and Becca, nearby. Justin and Becca played nice in front of Rachel, but as soon as she walked away they taunted and teased Matthew. Justin grew silent when Destiny, Tyrone, and Shaun arrived on the scene. \n\n\nBecca and Justin grilled Destiny about Tyrone, who said he went to school at \"Llanview U...\" Destiny quickly finished his sentence by saying he went to \"Llanview Union Magnet School,\" and Matthew covered for his friend by saying he'd heard of the fictional school. After a final insult to Matthew, Justin and Becca walked into the gym, followed by Tyrone. \n\n\nAs Justin walked by Rachel in the corridor, Rachel heard him insult Matthew. Rachel realized that Justin and Becca had been tormenting Matthew all along,  and, joined by Shaun, who said that his sister had a history with Justin, nodded to Destiny and Matthew across the hall. \"You a teacher?\" Shaun asked Rachel. \"A sister, actually,\" she replied. \"Well, I figured that,\" Shaun said, turning on the charm. Rachel said she was Matthew's sister, and Shaun replied that he was Destiny's brother. He introduced himself, and kissed Rachel's hand. \n\n\nDestiny thanked Matthew for covering for her, and Matthew apologized for not believing she'd have a date to the prom. Destiny admitted that Tyrone was her cousin, a substitute for the boy she'd wanted to ask her out. Matthew asked her if she was still angry at him, and Destiny said she was mostly annoyed he hadn't asked her to dance yet. Matthew promptly asked Destiny if he could have the next dance, and Destiny agreed, following him into the gymnasium. \n\n\nAs Shaun and Rachel compared notes about their siblings, Rachel spotted Justin buying drugs off Asher inside the gym. Seeing the adults, Justin quickly walked away before the transaction could be completed, but Shaun busted Asher, and the police hauled him away. \n\n\nAs Langston and Markko danced, Langston asked Markko if he'd bought the condoms. Markko promised her everything was taken care of. The arrival of Starr and Cole surprised the lovebirds. Starr and Cole also took to the dance floor. \n\n\nAs a montage began, Gigi fantasized about a perfect wedding to Rex, only to find herself alone in St. James. Solemn, she walked out. At Rex's, Stacy slept on the couch while Rex sat in the dark, looking at a family photo with Gigi and Shane. Brody and Jessica continued their dance at Rodi's, while at Llanfair, Viki and Charlie kissed their way into the bedroom. \n\n\nAt another church, Jared and Natalie exchanged vows before a priest and were pronounced man and wife. Delirious with joy, Jared took Natalie in his arms and twirled her around. Back at Llanview High, Asher was arrested while Shaun and Rachel looked on. Left alone to her own devices, Lola swallowed the acid Asher had given her. \n\n\nNearby, Starr and Cole continued to dance, and Starr told Cole not to worry about people looking at him. She said she knew they would get through it all together. \n\n\nThe lights dimmed, and the DJ announced that Llanview High had won a radio contest to have the Pussycat Dolls perform at their prom. With that, Nicole Scherzinger and the Dolls took to the stage singing their cover of A.R. Rahman's \"Jai Ho\" from Slumdog Millionaire. As Nicole danced around the gymnasium, the teens looked on. Nicole paid special attention to Matthew, and the Pussycat Dolls finished their performance in a blaze of glory.\n\n\n",
