Reed left to get ready for his date, and Viki informed Clint that she needed to talk about Jessica and the prom. Clint was happy that Jessica would be attending with Brody, and Viki proudly proclaimed that it had been with Charlie's help that Jessica and Brody would be together. Clint was grateful to Charlie, and Viki told him that things were going well with her and Charlie. She was concerned that Charlie was working closely with Dorian, but it was a project that involved a great opportunity for him.\n\n\nViki was upset that Jessica still her had sights set on Cristian, and she was afraid that Jessica would be hurt. She felt that every time Jessica got her life back on course, something happened to ruin it again. She was certain that Jessica's heart would be broken. Clint admitted that he didn't know what was best for Jessica, and he wondered if they should continue to treat her as a teenager. Viki was worried about Bree and speculated when Jessica might accept her responsibilities.\n\n\nViki mentioned that Marty thought that prom night was a critical night for Jessica, and she was anxious that Jessica could be stuck in the past if things didn't work out. They decided to call Marty, and Viki arranged to meet with Marty at the Palace so they could discuss the ramifications of prom night.\n\n\nNatalie arrived at the police station and, finding John's office empty, left her letter in an envelope marked personal, on his desk. She left the office but heard voices and ducked down behind a desk. Layla was talking to John. She told him that she was leaving work early because she was attending the high school prom, but Rita would fill in while Layla was gone. John headed into his office and began to rifle through his mail. Natalie watched him briefly and he didn't notice, but she fled the station when he began to open her envelope.\n\n\nJust then, Rita arrived to take over for Layla, and John received a phone call. Distracted, he placed the envelope on top of his desk. He left the office after the call. Marty arrived and Rita sent her to John's office to wait for him. Spotting the envelope marked personal, a curious Marty removed the note and began to read it. Natalie had written that she was strongly drawn to John, and she asked that he meet her at Rodi's at midnight if he felt the same. If he didn't show up then, she would realize it was goodbye, she had concluded. John returned and Marty hid the correspondence from him.\n\n\nJohn assured her that Cole was okay and that Todd had been taken to the station infirmary. He would make sure to keep the two of them apart. Todd had still denied that he had been the one to push Marty, John summarized. Marty told him she had something to say as she thought about Natalie's letter. She hesitated and finally just apologized for her reaction to John's proposal that they try for another baby. She didn't think they were in the proper position to think about it. She received a phone call from Viki and departed for the Palace. She hid Natalie's letter in her purse.\n\n\nBrody called Jessica while she was at school to find out what type of flowers she wanted for the prom. Jessica ended the conversation abruptly when she spied Cristian in the gym. She advised Brody that she really didn't care what kind of flowers he had for her.  She sauntered over to Cristian and coyly asked him to save a dance for her at the prom. Annoyed, Cristian reminded her that he was a teacher and she was a student, and it wasn't appropriate. Jessica pointed out that he had been jealous when she spoke to Ford on a previous evening. \"Was that appropriate?\" she asked him.\n\n\nCristian insisted he hadn't been jealous and while Ford was a great roommate, Cristian wasn't fond of the way Ford treated women. \"You can't judge a book by its cover,\" Cristian told her. He had merely been protecting her, the same as he would for any other woman. Jess was certain that Layla had noticed Cristian's jealousy, as well, and the fact that Cristian had feelings for Jessica. Just then one of the students, Darren, wandered in and knocked into a ladder, which caused it to topple. Jessica landed in Cristian's arms, and the two stared into each other's eyes.\n\n\nAs Jessica leaned in for a kiss, Darren apologized for being so clumsy, and the moment was ruined. Jessica returned to the previous conversation and she wanted Cristian to swear on his mother's life that he wasn't jealous. Cristian refused, and Jessica triumphantly shouted that she had been right. Cristian was jealous and his silence told her what she wanted to know. She turned to leave because she had to get herself ready for the prom.\n\n\nKelly was mortified when Dorian announced that she had hired a bodyguard for Kelly as long as there was a \"dangerous killer at large.\" She introduced Kelly to Shaun, but Kelly promptly turned down Dorian's offer. She cited the fact that she didn't want a stranger to play babysitter, and she didn't need one, anyway, since she was safe. Dorian declared that she would not negotiate and Shaun was ready to start. Kelly noted that she had a date and her dinner reservations were for two people, not three.\n\n\nDorian was excited to learn that Kelly had a date, especially when she heard that it was with Reed. She was sure that there was a relationship between the pair that Kelly hadn't divulged, though Kelly insisted there wasn't. As Kelly departed La Boulaie for the hairdresser, Dorian ordered Shaun to follow Kelly.\n\n\nAt Roxy's hair salon, Langston ran into Ford, who was there to use the tanning bed. He invited her to spend time with him that evening, but Langston explained that she couldn't abandon Markko on prom night. He leaned over to kiss her, but she backed away. He tried to persuade her to change her mind and rubbed in the fact that he would have the apartment to himself, since Layla and Cristian would be at the prom. Langston turned down the invitation again, and Ford sighed that he would have to live with it.\n\n\nLangston made it clear that it would probably be one of the last times she was out with Markko because she planned on breaking up with him. She didn't want to ruin the evening for him. Ford referred to the empty apartment again, but Roxy called out that the tanning bed was ready for him. Kelly arrived with Shaun and revealed that she was stuck with him even if she didn't like it.\n\n\nAs Kelly sat under a hair dryer, Roxy gave Shaun a manicure. Kelly called John for an update on her mother's case and learned that John had received Rodney's autopsy report. He told her that Rodney had died of a heart attack, but Kelly was skeptical. She stated that Rodney was healthy and had been fine when he arrived at her office. John informed her that the case was closed and his hands were \"officially tied.\" She asked if he would be able to work on it, and he replied that he couldn't \"answer officially.\" She told him of her plan to see him to discuss it and hung up before he could reply.\n\n\nAs Kelly made her way out of the hair salon, Jessica walked in. The young women agreed to meet at a later date for some girl talk, though Jessica confessed that she couldn't remember anything that had transpired with Kelly's life. Kelly was in a hurry because she had a date, and Jessica revealed that she was going to the prom. Kelly seemed perturbed, but she didn't say anything. Jessica had to figure out how to be alone with a different guy than the one she was going with, she said. She showed Roxy a picture of a 90's hairstyle that she wanted.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Brody saw Layla, who had arrived to pick up a boutonni\u00e8re for Cristian that Carlotta had hidden in the refrigerator. Brody revealed that he knew that Jessica had stopped at the apartment to see Cristian and Layla to tell them about her date with Brody. He knew it was to make Cristian jealous, and he was sure that prom night would be the last chance for Brody to win Jessica back. Layla was sorry that Brody was in pain after all he had been through to be with Jessica in the first place, and she hoped all went well. She headed for the kitchen as Natalie walked in and greeted Brody.\n\n\nNatalie announced that she had either been brave or stupid as she explained what she had done with the letter. She had asked John to choose between her and Marty, and it was Roxy's idea. Brody thought she had been brave, and Roxy was the one who had told him to go after Jessica. Natalie thought it was different because John was with someone else, but Brody disagreed. Natalie wanted to flee, but she would have her answer at midnight. She was distressed, since there were still so many hours to wait. They toasted to the evening. Natalie related that she had seen John begin to open her letter and wished she could see his reaction.\n\n\nLayla stopped to talk to Carlotta, who assured the young woman that Cristian was quite happy with Layla. She pointed out that Cristian had taken Jessica to the prom a long time before, and she knew that Jessica had her eyes on Cristian again. Layla admitted that she was worried about how Cristian really felt. Cristian walked in as the women chatted and asked if he had interrupted something. Layla hid the flowers, backed out of the door, and exclaimed that she had to get ready for the prom. Carlotta spoke up and advised him that she and Layla had concerns.\n\n\nCristian knew that Layla was upset about Jessica, but he assured Carlotta that he loved Layla. Carlotta wanted to know if Cristian had any feelings for Jessica.\n\n\nLangston returned to La Boulaie to get dressed for the prom, and Dorian was ecstatic that Langston had made that choice. Langston was sad that Starr wouldn't be attending with Cole and, while Dorian shared her feelings, she thought that Langston should be happy for herself. It was an important night, and Langston was about to be a woman, she gushed. Langston assured Dorian that she was already a woman. She was quiet as Dorian chattered on about the evening's festivities and all she had planned for Langston's preparations and pictures. She suddenly noticed that she seemed to be more excited than Langston.\n\n\nGently, Dorian expressed her sorrow that Langston's parents weren't there for her, but she would do her best to make up for it. She thought that Langston would feel better after she was dressed up, and she was sure the evening would be memorable. Langston recalled that she had a rehearsal for the musical, and she hastened out. She bumped into Reed, who had arrived early for his date with Kelly.\n\n\nDorian was prepared to question Reed and, since Kelly wasn't there, she inquired about his relationship with Kelly. It seemed to be more than a business relationship to her, she stated. Reed advised her that he wanted to get to know Kelly better and Dorian retorted that she planned on getting to know Reed better herself. She invited him in and began to give him the third degree.\n\n\nAfter John received the phone call from Kelly, he placed a call to a friend and former agent. He wanted to talk about toxicology and traceable drugs. Later, he looked through his mail and realized that the half-opened envelope was missing. He asked Rita about the rest of his mail or if anyone had been in his office. Rita wasn't familiar with the mail, but she noted that Dr. Saybrooke had been the only one in John's office while he had been gone.\n\n\nViki, Clint, and Marty met at the Palace. Marty told them that there was something about prom night and the \"rite of passage\" as the reason that Jessica was stuck, both emotionally and mentally. She thought that Mitch's rape attempt and the night that Jessica had originally planned on losing her virginity were related. She spoke of Jessica's attempt to alter past events as a way to change the present, and she was trying to connect sex with love instead of violence. She thought that the two worlds might merge, but she couldn't promise that things would change. It was a significant night, and she thought they should \"let it play out.\"\n\n\nAfter their meeting, Marty pulled Natalie's letter to John from her purse and began to read it again. She read that Natalie loved John.\n\n\nKelly returned home in time to save Reed from Dorian's questions, but she needed to change her clothes. Reed assured her she looked fine and said they would be heading to dinner and a Broadway show in New York City. Shaun asked if they were ready to go, and Dorian ordered him to stick to Kelly like glue because her life was in danger. Shaun wasn't sure what to do about the show, but Dorian suggested he locate a scalper. Outside, Kelly explained her new chaperone to Reed. He was sure he would be able to \"liberate\" them before the night was over.\n\n\nFord was finished with the tanning bed and saw Jessica as he prepared to leave. He told her she was \"smokin' hot\" and suggested they get together some time. Roxy told Jessica he was a \"player,\" and Jessica assured her she wasn't interested in Ford. She owed him her thanks though, since Cristian admitted he had feelings for Jessica because of Ford. Layla had just walked into the salon and heard Jessica's comment.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica is ready for her prom, detecting that Cristian may be concerned or even jealous over hear interest in other guys.
