Rex was saved from having to answer Adriana when the announcer on the radio read a dedication from 'Roxanne' to Adriana and Rex and then began playing Billy Idol's White Wedding. They listened to the song as they started their day. Rex took a moment to apologize to Adriana for not being able to make love to her the night before. Adriana pretended that it wasn't a big deal but the concern on her face, when Rex wasn't looking, told a different story. A few minutes later, Roxy arrived to see her son before the wedding. She was a little surprised to find Adriana at the loft since it was bad luck for a bride and groom to see each other on the wedding morning. Adriana brushed off Roxy's concerns, insisting that she and Rex were not superstitious. After Adriana left, Roxy had a mother-son talk with Rex. She told him that she was incredibly proud of him and that she loved him deeply. \n\n\nDavid Vickers surprised Viki with a visit. Charlie appeared a bit uncomfortable as David and Viki chatted away. David told Viki that the lottery ticket that she had given him proved to be a good luck charm. He had made his way onto television before he had lost the ticket. He decided to replace it with another lottery ticket from the same place the original had come from. Viki was shocked when David revealed that he had returned to Paris, Texas, and the Bon Jour Caf\u00e9. Her jaw dropped when David went on to tell her that he had ended up working at the diner. The conversation took a turn when Viki asked David if he had run into Natalie he was working there recently. David lied, claiming that he had not seen Natalie but he carefully pumped Viki for information about Jared. She also unwittingly provided David with a perfect excuse for being in town: Adriana's wedding. \n\n\nJared and Natalie returned to the Buchanan mansion. Nigel found them outside kissing and assumed that they had decided to tell the family the truth about Jared's deception. Inside, Bo and Matthew prepared to leave for Rex's wedding. Matthew seemed down. He asked his father why people bothered to get married when most ended up divorcing. Bo seemed a little taken aback by Matthew's attitude. He told Matthew that even though couples did split up, there were many who fell in love and stayed married for the rest of their lives. Bo told his son that he hoped Matthew would find that kind of love one day. They walked outside and ran into Nigel, Jared, and Natalie. Bo found Nigel's behavior odd and asked the butler if anything was bothering him. Nigel insisted that he was fine. After Bo and Matthew walked away, the three conspirators made their way inside. Natalie worried that Nigel's behavior would eventually be their undoing. Nigel was more concerned about Natalie and Jared's inability to keep their hands off of each other. Natalie was confident that she and Jared could control themselves until they could figure out a way to break the news about Jared to the family. Shortly after Nigel walked away, the doorbell rang. Natalie was surprised when she opened to the door to David Vickers. David let Jared and Natalie know that he was fully aware of their dirty little secret and intended to use their deception to his advantage. \n\n\nBo and Matthew stopped by to see Rex on their way to the church. While Matthew went to the computer to check his email, Bo sat down to have a few words with Rex. He told Rex about the conversation that he had with Matthew, earlier that morning, about marriage. Rex bristled as he listened to Bo talk about his views on marriage and commitment. He felt that Bo was trying to advise Rex not to marry Adriana. Bo quickly explained that he was just trying to make the point that a successful marriage required work. Bo sensed that Rex was troubled, but Rex insisted that he was fine. Before Bo and Matthew left, Bo offered to hold Rex's wedding vows that he had written for safekeeping. Rex declined the offer and pretended that he had everything under control. Once he closed the door, Rex frantically tried to write down his wedding vows but couldn't seem to find the words. Later, before Rex left his apartment, he gave his appearance a final inspection in the mirror and proceeded to have an argument with his reflection. He insisted that he didn't have conflicted feelings over marrying Adriana because of Gigi. \n\n\nJessica woke Nash up to breakfast in bed. They decided to skip Rex and Adriana's wedding so that they could spend a romantic day together. \n\n\nAdriana stopped by Brody's room. She wanted an update on the previous night's events, when Brody had gone to see Gigi. He told her that he couldn't talk to Gigi because Rex had been there, and afterwards she had broken down and cried. Adriana was furious to have her suspicions confirmed. She reminded Brody of the hefty sum of money that she had given him and demanded that he hold up his end of the bargain. She wanted to make sure that Gigi was too busy with Brody to put a kink in her wedding plans. \n\n\nShane framed the picture he had found of Brody and proudly showed it to his mother. Shane suggested that they have copies made of the picture and offered to frame another one for Gigi that she could keep in her bedroom. Gigi seemed uncomfortable with the gesture and changed the subject when Shane began coughing. She worried that his asthma had started acting up and reconsidered attending Rex and Adriana's wedding. Shane insisted on going to the wedding and promised that he would take his medicine. After Gigi dressed for the wedding, Marcie stopped by for a quick visit. While they talked, Marcie spotted the picture of Brody and Gigi that Shane had left behind. While she looked at the picture, Marcie admitted that she didn't think Shane looked like his father. Gigi began fidgeting and talking nervously. Marcie realized that Gigi was hiding something and pushed for answers until Gigi finally admitted that Rex was Shane's father. Marcie was stunned. When she asked Gigi if Rex knew, Gigi poured out her story. She told Marcie that after Rex had left, she didn't think he would want anything to do with a baby. Then Gigi had met Brody. Brody knew that he wasn't the baby's father but offered to raise him as own anyway. Unfortunately, Brody had been killed in action before Shane had been born. Gigi decided to give Shane the father who had wanted him. Marcie felt that Gigi was making a grave error by not telling Rex and Shane the truth. She pointed out that Shane might not be grateful for his mother's lies when he realized that they had kept him from his real father. Gigi was still troubled by what Marcie had said when she and Shane prepared to leave for the wedding. Gigi seemed to reach a decision and told Shane that she needed to talk to him about something important. Unfortunately, Shane began coughing and before long the cough developed into a full-blown asthma attack. Gigi found Shane's inhaler in his pocket but was horrified when she realized that it was empty. \n\n\nRex went to Llanfair to pick Charlie up for the wedding. He walked into an empty kitchen and called out but didn't get a response so he decided to look for Charlie instead. Moments later, Gigi and Shane burst through the kitchen door. Gigi began to frantically look for an inhaler. She had hoped that Shane had left his full inhaler behind when he'd been at the house earlier that day. When she didn't find it, she called out for help. Rex ran into the kitchen and froze when he saw that Shane was in distress. \n\n\nBrody let himself into Gigi's home. As Adriana tried to reach him on the cell phone, Brody looked around Gigi's place and found the framed picture of him and Gigi. \n\n\n",
