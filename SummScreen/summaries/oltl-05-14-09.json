    "soap_central": "\n Full Circle \n\n\n \nAwakening slowly, Todd looked around a somewhat familiar room. Powell loomed into sight and sarcastically welcomed Todd. They were in Kevin's old room at the KAD house. Powell explained that he had purchased the boarded-up house and had recreated it down to the smallest details. He pointed out that it was where Todd's defining moment had been when he had made Marty pay for \"dissing him.\" \n\n\nTodd was shackled to the bed, in much the same way that Marty had been pinned down the night she was raped. Todd was the one at someone else's mercy this time, Powell added. \n\n\nReminding Powell that he had helped rape Marty, Todd said Powell was insane. Powell replied that he had been forced into it. Opening the closet door, he advised Todd that he was holding three women hostage and that Todd would be the unwilling prey. Inside, the bound and gagged T\u00e9a, Blair, and Marty sat as Powell named them judge, jury, and executioner. He stated that Marty needed justice and he had the knife for her to get it, since she didn't have the knife the last time. \n\n\nTodd pleaded with Powell to let the women go, but Powell pointed out that the entire incident was actually between Todd and the women, and not Powell at all. He merely killed people to get Todd's attention, though he admitted he wanted to kill John and not Sayid, who was in the wrong place. He killed people who had wronged Marty, Powell confessed. \n\n\nContinuing, Powell added that Blair was trashy, not Marty. He accused Blair of living to make Marty miserable, by trashing her in the newspaper and by marrying John, among other things. He stated that Blair was supposed to die. He also felt that Todd had treated Blair like garbage. \n\n\nTodd accused Powell of still being weak and of not being a man. He merely thought he was a tough guy because he threatened women, but he was afraid of facing Todd alone, in Todd's opinion. He ordered Powell to kill him and get it over with, but Powell assured Todd that the women would kill him, not Powell. He demanded that Todd apologize to T\u00e9a, and held the knife to Todd's throat. \"T\u00e9a, I'm sorry. You know that, right?\" Todd said. \n\n\nPowell also felt that Todd should make amends to Marty every day of her life for the way that he had treated her. Tongue in cheek, Todd pointed out that it was Powell who had killed people. Powell felt that Marty should even things up and kill Todd for the pain that he caused her. \n\n\nMarty responded that it wouldn't be justice. Blair's response to the same suggestion was that Powell should go to hell. A quiet T\u00e9a appeared deep in thought when Powell proposed that she take her power back so that Todd couldn't victimize the women again. He deserves it, he urged. When he asked who wanted to be first, T\u00e9a finally spoke up. \"I will,\" she said. \n\n\nAt the Sitwell Institute, a straitjacketed John awoke to the sound of the orderlies outside of his cell talking about him. They said that he had killed four people in addition to Ellen Kwan. Suddenly, his old, blind, and very dead friend Pete appeared and chastised him for getting himself into a mess. As John shrugged off his vision, figuring that he was drugged and losing it, Pete urged him to get out and help Marty. He asked John what his father would do. \n\n\nJohn felt that if he continued to talk to himself, an orderly would appear to sedate him as he had heard the doctor's orders previously. Pete encouraged him, reminding him that would mean that the door would be open. John comprehended what he had to do and began to act out, making noise and talking very loudly. As a pair of orderlies entered the room, John head-butted one and managed to knock both of the men unconscious. Pete assured him that he could see what was happening through John's eyes. \n\n\nAs John contemplated his next step, that of removing the straitjacket, Pete reminded him of a long ago birthday present. John recalled the book from 1910 and the details on Harry Houdini's escapes. He groaned, hardly remembering what he had read so long ago. Chiding him for having read the book at least 200 times, Pete advised John to concentrate and remember the pages as he saw them. As John began to recall the steps to removing the straitjacket, Pete continued to encourage him. \n\n\nAfter much struggling, John finally freed himself. Pete urged him to hurry, to find Powell, and to watch his back. John ran from the room, grabbed his jacket and fled. \n\n\nDorian found Ray softly strumming a guitar in his room at La Boulaie. Surprised to see him, she mentioned how nervous she was thinking about Langston and Markko and their plans for the evening. Ray was waiting for Lola. Dorian invited him to her room, where they could be more comfortable, and told him to bring his guitar. \n\n\nIn Dorian's room, Ray serenaded Dorian as she lamented that she was allowing Langston to have sex. Ray assured her that Langston was delicate but mature. He advised Dorian that she was also delicate, as well as beautiful and desirable. He admitted that he understood why she had attempted to kill him when he had tried to take Langston from her. He wondered if she would be as passionate in her love for him as she was in her hate for him. Dorian wondered if Ray was challenging her. \"Is that a yes?\" he asked. Picking her up, he carried her over to the bed. \n\n\nStarr and Cole lingered at the Llanview High School prom, but were worried about Hope's exhumation. A nervous Langston wasn't quite ready to leave yet, but a loud, obnoxious, and obviously high Lola made fun of her and warned her cousin not to get knocked up. Markko felt they should leave, but Langston was concerned about Lola. Pulling Langston aside, Starr advised her that she was just nervous. She assured her girlfriend that the evening of lovemaking would still be romantic even if it was not spontaneous. \n\n\nAs Michael helped out with the documentation of the exhumation, Marcie appeared, insisting that she needed to be there for Hope and Starr. Michael cited regulations prohibiting her presence, but Marcie promised not to get in the way. She insisted she would be able to handle it and Bo felt that it would be okay. As the casket was dug up, Marcie assured Hope that her mommy was there and that she wouldn't leave her. \n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Markko and Langston awkwardly settled into their room. Markko put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door and pointed out a surprise for Langston. He had ordered chocolate dipped strawberries for her. They took note of all of the room amenities nervously and talked of their days together when they were in third grade. Langston remembered being mean to Markko, who thought even then that Langston was beautiful. \n\n\nBack at the prom, Starr worried about her friends and apologized to Cole for everything that had happened over time. As the last dance was announced, Cole asked Starr to dance. Admitting that she \"dared to dream,\" which was the prom's theme, Starr talked about Hope and how things might have been when their daughter went to her own prom. Then she realized that Marcie would have been Hope's mother, anyway. Arm in arm, the couple decided to head to the cemetery. \n\n\nAs Ray and Dorian made love, Lola waltzed into the room. \"Everyone is having sex,\" she exclaimed to them. Turning her back and twirling around, she kept repeating \"sex, sex, sex.\" As she plopped herself down on the floor, Ray and Dorian asked if something had happened. About to call Langston, Dorian stopped in her tracks. Lola sang that she had fixed them because Markko didn't want her. \"It's done,\" she giggled. \n\n\nAs Markko and Langston began to make love, Langston pulled away and walked over to her purse. Pulling the condom from its case and handing it to Markko, she advised him that Cramer women were always prepared. \n\n\nArriving at the cemetery and finding everyone gone, Starr and Cole felt sure that they would hear some news before too long, though it wouldn't bring Hope back. As they wrapped their arms around each other, Starr declared that Hope would always be their baby.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The prom is underway. Langston and Markko have no clue what Lola did. But she shows up revealing that she let Asher give her some drugs. Meanwhile, Dorian and Ray are together talking about letting their respective daughters grow up. And they end up sleeping together. Starr and Cole are at the prom together knowing that as they speak, their dead baby is being exhumed. Michael, Marcie and Bo go to the gravesite to exhume baby Hope. Powell Lord has taken Todd, Blair, Marty and Tea to the frat house where he, Todd and Zach gang raped Marty. He reminds Todd that he knows all about his history with hurting women. And now Todd is going to be at the desperate mercy of the three women he has hurt. He encourages all three of them to kill Todd in order to \"take back their power\".",
