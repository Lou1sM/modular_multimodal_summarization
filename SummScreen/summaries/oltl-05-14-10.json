Langston spotted Starr in the hall, and they remembered how Cole had saved Starr from \"those jocks.\"  Starr proclaimed that Cole had been the first guy that she had ever been with, had ever trusted, and had ever loved.  Starr cried to Langston, \"I don't know.  What would you do?  What would you do if you lost Markko?\"\n\n\nLangston evaded the question and asked about Cole.  Starr replied that she had found Hannah hanging all over Cole at the jail.  Starr told Langston of her suspicions that Hannah had pushed Marty down the stairs.  Starr emphasized that Hannah had admitted to being at the hospital at the time, but Langston wondered if Hannah could be so desperate that she would push Marty down the stairs just to get Cole's attention.  Langston pointed out that Starr did not have proof that Hannah did it, and Starr responded, \"Yet.\"  When Langston told Starr, as they walked to the gym, that she did not want to go to Roxy's alone to have her hair done, Starr suggested that Langston take Dani.\n\n\nIn the high school hall, after Langston left, Starr imagined Cole asking her to the prom.  Nate strolled through the hall and broke Starr's illusion.\n\n\nIn the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9, Brody revealed to Markko that he was taking Jessica to the prom and exclaimed, \"Just be glad your date doesn't think she's in love with someone else.\"\n\n\nCristian insisted to Carlotta in the Buenas Dias kitchen that he loved Layla, and that it was over with Jessica.  Carlotta begged Cristian not to hurt Jessica, and to look deep in his heart for any love that he might have left for Jessica.  Cristian inquired what if he still did.  Carlotta declared that Cristian could not have it both ways, and that he needed to make a choice.  Cristian stressed that he did not want to hurt Jessica, but Carlotta remarked that maybe Jessica needed to be hurt, so she could snap out of it.  Carlotta advised, \"I'm telling you, you are going to hurt them both, if you don't make a choice.\"  Cristian's cell phone rang.\n\n\nIn the jail, Hannah took cookies to Cole, as she informed him that Starr was suspicious that Hannah had pushed Marty down the stairs, which had killed Marty's baby.  Cole refused to believe Starr's allegations against Hannah.\n\n\nAs Starr watched in the gym, Dani, Destiny, and Nate began the rehearsal for the musical, Starr X'd Lovers, with a song, and the play opened from when Starr and Cole had first met.  Darren and Whitney danced the opening number, while Dani sang the solo and was later joined by Nate.  The dancers included Matthew and Destiny, who later joined in to sing.  Starr loved the opening sequence.\n\n\nAfter the first song was done, Destiny and Matthew pondered how they would react at the prom, once they saw Langston and Markko together, since they knew that Langston had cheated on Markko with Ford.  After Destiny left, Darren walked up to Matthew and exclaimed that he knew that Destiny was \"nuts about\" him.\n\n\nStill in the gym, Matthew walked over to Nate and demanded that Nate keep his lips off of Matthew's girlfriend.  Matthew stressed to Nate that Dani had only kissed Nate in the park, because she was upset.  Nate did not deny it and replied, \"You know, but as far as you and Dani go, it's up to you.\"\n\n\nMatthew located Dani, and after Dani asked Matthew to pick her up for the prom at La Boulaie, Langston told her that it was time to leave for Roxy's.\n\n\nAt Roxy's, Jessica told Roxy that Cristian had admitted that he still had feelings for her, as Layla entered the salon.  Roxy laughed and joked that Jessica must be kidding about what she had just said.  Jessica informed Layla that \"Cristian and I are destined to be together.  You'll see.\"  When Jessica said that she had only told Cristian that Brody would be her date at Layla's apartment to make Cristian jealous, and that later Cristian had been jealous when Ford had flirted with her, Layla maintained that Cristian had just been concerned about Jessica's condition.  Jessica then revealed that Cristian had almost kissed her in the high school gym.\n\n\nAs Destiny, Dani, Starr, and Whitney entered Roxy's, Layla called Jessica a spoiled brat and exclaimed that Cristian would never have kissed Jessica on school property.  Destiny made a comment to Langston that Layla and Jessica were talking about \"cheating people,\" and Whitney demanded to know why Dani had been kissing Nate in the park.  As all of the girls argued, Roxy yelled, \"Quiet!\" and stressed, \"If you want to keep your girlfriends close, button it.\"\n\n\nTo emphasize Roxy's point, Langston sang \"Our Lips Are Sealed,\" by the Go-Go's, and Dani joined in with a solo later.  The girls danced to the tune, and all of the ladies, excluding Destiny and Roxy, were costumed in pink wigs and red dresses.  Langston questioned Destiny on her earlier remark about cheating, and Destiny answered, \"It's the lowest, right?  Uh, see you at the prom...with your boyfriend, right?\"  Roxy asked the girls under the hair dryers, who was next.\n\n\nAt the jail, when Hannah mentioned the prom and asked if Cole wished he could be with Starr, Cole related that a few years back, Starr and Cole had gone to the prom together - but with other dates.  Somehow, Cole explained, he and Starr had made it back together - and in the rainstorm.  At the time, Cole had felt that he and Starr belonged together, but he admitted that he did not know what to believe anymore.  Cole sadly replied, \"So, do I wish I could be with Starr tonight?  If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.  Something my dad used to say.\"  Starr, who had been listening unseen, quietly slipped out of the jail.\n\n\nStill at Roxy's and on the phone, Layla informed Cristian that she was running late, and that she would see Cristian at home.  However, Cristian stated that he would get ready for the prom in the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9 and would see Layla later.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Viki and Clint informed Bo and Nora that Jessica was going to the prom, and they asked if Matthew would be at the prom to support her.  As Matthew walked through the living room door, Clint requested that Matthew keep an eye on Jessica at the prom.  Jessica walked in.\n\n\nJessica insisted that it would not be necessary for Matthew to keep an eye on her, because she had \"a chaperon\" to do just that.  However, as Jessica walked back in the mansion lobby, she said to herself, \"And if I have anything to say about it, he won't be looking at anyone else.\"\n\n\nAfter the young ladies had left Roxy's, Brody made a grand entrance dressed in his navy whites.  Roxy declared that Brody looked nice and left to retrieve her camera to take his picture.  Brody strolled out of Roxy's and sang, \"Keep on Loving You,\" by REO Speedwagon, as Jessica put on her makeup at the Buchanan mansion.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian claimed to Blair that the prom was a once in a lifetime experience, and that Starr should be there.  Blair pointed out that Cole was in jail, just as T\u00e9a walked in.  Dorian expressed her outrage at T\u00e9a's sudden entrance, and Blair stated that she had invited T\u00e9a.  After Blair sent T\u00e9a on an errand within the mansion, Dorian yelled, \"Since when have you been cozying up to the enemy?\"  Blair exclaimed that maybe she was not as mean as Dorian had thought, but then explained that it was for Dani, not T\u00e9a.  T\u00e9a walked into the room, and Dorian stormed out.\n\n\nT\u00e9a thanked Blair for the invitation, and Blair requested that T\u00e9a thank her by going to her treatments, as Dani walked in.  Dani asked, \"What treatments?\"  Blair explained to Dani that T\u00e9a needed hot oil treatments for her dried out hair, as T\u00e9a sarcastically laughed.  Langston and Destiny saw Dani and grabbed her arm to take her upstairs to get dressed for the prom.  T\u00e9a followed.\n\n\nStarr entered La Boulaie through the balcony door and stated to Blair that she did not want to go to the prom without Cole.  Blair insisted that Starr had to go to her senior prom and then, as she hugged Starr, sang a beautiful melody, \"All the Memories Fade Away.\"  As Blair sang, brief clips were shown, where the parents took pictures of Markko, Destiny, Cristian, Jessica, and Matthew in prom attire.  Roxy took pictures of Brody.  The Lord girls led Starr upstairs to help her get ready.\n\n\nAfter Starr was dressed, she went downstairs, just as the doorbell rang.  Starr answered the door to Cole who commented, \"Of course, it's me.  Who else would take you to the prom?  We were meant to be together.  You should know that by now.\"  Cole and Starr kissed - all in her mind.\n\n\nActually, Matthew and Markko were at the door to pick up their dates, Dani and Langston.  As Matthew and Markko walked towards the staircase, Starr sang, \"We Belong,\" by Pat Benatar, as she walked outside in the garden, and clips were shown, where the gentlemen picked up their dates and offered them corsages.  Langston and Dani joined Starr out in the garden to harmonize the song.  The three ladies walked into La Boulaie, and at the same time, as Brody picked up Jessica, Hannah finished the song at the jail, while she thought of Cole.\n\n\nOn the La Boulaie staircase, Dorian took pictures as T\u00e9a and Blair, Langston and Markko, Dani and Matthew, and Starr posed.  Outside on the steps, T\u00e9a and Blair hugged each other, as the youngsters left for the prom.  Inside, as Dorian picked up a framed photo of Starr and Cole, she vowed, \"They belong together...especially tonight of all nights.  And I am going to make it happen.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody is getting ready for their prom. Starr is not planning on going while Cole is in jail, but Blair persuades her to join her friends. The students perform the musical Starr Crossed Lovers. All of the women get their hair done at Roxy's. Jessica still has Cristian on the brain, but Brody is determined to get her back. Blair invites T\u00e9a and Dani to the house before the prom. Although Dorian wonders why, Blair does not reveal the reason.",
