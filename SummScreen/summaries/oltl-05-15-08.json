    "soap_central": "\nMOTHERS OF INVENTION\n\n\n\"That's right. I'm smart. I know everything,\" David informed Natalie and Jared. He proceeded to tell them that he knew that Jared was not a Buchanan and therefore not really Nat's uncle. He added that he was ready to collect and to have a cut of the money that Jared was obviously amassing. He admitted that he was a poster boy for long-lost sons and could easily have committed the scam himself. Nat suggested that there wouldn't be anyone who would believe his story. David planned on recommending a new DNA test. The couple admitted that they had planned on telling everyone the truth in their own time so that they could avoid hurting a lot of people and that it wasn't about the money as David thought. David didn't believe that but confessed that they didn't have to tell anyone at all. He was blackmailing them and merely wanted some of the money. Nat thought it a good time to point out just how disgusting David really was, filling Jared in on David's blackmail attempt when Jess needed a new liver. Having to get to Rex's wedding, Nat left Jared to deal with the situation. They obliged with a passionate kiss when David taunted them into it. Jared appealed to David to hold off, as he didn't have the cash available right away. David mentioned that it was only the first installment and asked about the real heir, wondering if Jared knew who it was. \n\n\nAt the church, Bo and Charlie worried and wondered where Rex could be, while in the women's room, Adriana kept checking her phone. She finally reached Brody and learned that there was no sign of either Gigi or Rex at the carriage house, though he had spotted them together earlier. \"Looks like they left fast,\" he told her. He also suspected they were up to something. She asked him to stay put. When Dorian told her daughter to stop obsessing, Adriana asked her for a favor instead. She requested that her mother fetch Brody and bring him to the church, in case Gigi wanted to divulge the news that Rex was really Shane's father. The bridal party presented the bride with the traditional \"something old, something new....\" which included a necklace that belonged to Langston's mother. Langston felt that they were almost like sisters, she told Adriana. Adriana hugged the girl and told her that they WERE sisters if they both had to deal with Dorian. Roxy gave the bride a blue, lucky rabbit's foot. In the meantime, Antonio and Talia both managed to get away and share some private time together. Getting caught kissing by the priest, Talia promised to refrain from further inappropriate behavior, though Antonio started again, once the priest walked away. He pointed out that he wasn't the one who promised. The church was very hot for some reason and all of the men had to remove their jackets, in order not to melt. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Rex and Gigi searched for Shane's inhaler to no avail. Rex was able to temporarily get the boy calmed down and breathing, as he held him and quietly gave him some suggestions. He promised not to let anything happen to Shane. When the breathing quickly deteriorated again with the boy collapsing, Rex picked Shane up and the trio headed to the ER. \n\n\nBrody tenderly looked at an old, framed picture of himself and Gigi as he waited at the carriage house. When Dorian arrived, she announced that there had been a change in plans. She was about to pay him double what Adriana had paid him and wanted him to do the opposite of what he had been told. She wanted him to go back to where they had found him because she knew what was best for her daughter. Brody realized that Dorian wanted Gigi to stop the wedding. Dorian explained that Rex was not right for Adriana because he had caused her to suffer and to become insecure. She planned on just \"letting nature take its course.\" Smiling sweetly, Dorian headed out the door. Brody removed the old picture from the frame and took it with him. \n\n\nAs Cole unpacked some groceries, describing the food as he did, Starr became ill. She grumbled when Cole attempted to help her out, and asked to be left alone. She cried and told him she wanted her mother. Outside, Blair posted flyers of the missing couple as John told her he did not have any information yet. Todd showed up and accused the pair of sleeping together. A sarcastic Blair responded that yes, they were together all night long. She then snarled that they had been out since dawn, searching for Starr and Cole. As he followed behind Blair, he asked why she had lied about her and John spending the night. Blair was annoyed that he had spoken about that first, instead of inquiring about Starr. She felt that Todd only wanted to blame everyone else for their problems. John headed to the beach and spotted Winter, who still denied knowing the couple. When John revealed that he had learned of a previous record from Winter's youth, Winter admitting to knowing them. He had really counted on them making it, he told John. Blair told Todd that she thought that something else was wrong, that Starr ran away for some other reason and that she needed her mom. \n\n\nAt the hospital, as they waited for word on Shane, Gigi ordered Rex to leave, reminding him of his wedding. Rex refused, citing the fact that he was exactly where he belonged. She asked how he knew about the breathing techniques and he reminded her that he too had had asthma when he was a child, due to Roxy smoking. Michael had good news; Shane would be okay. He suggested that Gigi take him to an allergist because the weather was different from Texas and the air not as dry. He said that only family would be admitted to seeing the boy. Gigi adamantly told him that Shane loved Rex so Michael agreed to make an exception. Shane apologized for losing his inhaler. Out in the hallway again after making sure that Shane was fine, Gigi emotionally told Rex that Shane was all she had. Rex told her that wasn't true. \n\n\nStarr felt better later and apologized to Cole for her outburst. She explained that she was sick and emotional and missed her mom. Cole understood perfectly, as he placed a cold cloth on her forehead. Starr realized that her boyfriend really wanted to have the baby. They talked about all of the good traits it would have. Todd spotted John and Winter on the beach and made a beeline for them. John urged the young man not to say anything. Approaching them, Todd held out some money and Winter spilled his guts. He explained that Starr and Cole had new jobs and were about to start the next day. As Todd stalked off towards the business, Blair could hardly believe it. John confessed that they had sent Todd on the wrong trail. As Todd quizzed a man from the restaurant where he had been sent, the man insisted that he had not hired the couple. \"McBain,\" Todd muttered under his breath. Winter told Blair and John the truth as they headed towards the boarding house where Winter, Cole, and Starr were residing. \n\n\nTalia returned to the bridal party with disheveled hair and at her friends' quizzical expressions, explained that the church had been windy. Dorian returned and told her daughter that she had done what Adriana wanted her to do. Furthermore, everything would be fine, that she loved her, and that she did whatever she did for that love. She exclaimed how beautiful her daughter was, fully dressed in her wedding gown. Bo knocked on the door and announced that they had a problem. There was no sign of Rex. Nat arrived at the church. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd, Blair and John all scrounge to find Starr and Cole. They find Winter, the guy who rented them their room. He is not about to talk until Todd flashes money at him. And he leads them to the rooming house. Inside, Starr is getting sick from the pregnancy and admits to Cole that maybe she needs her mom. But they determine that their baby will be like only the good people in both of their families and not, in any way, like Todd. Right when Rex is supposed to get to his wedding, Shane has an asthma attack. Rex is determined to get him to the hospital and be there for him although Gigi urges him to get to his wedding. Adriana cannot find him. She asks Dorian to help and Dorian \"helps\" by offering to double what Adriana has paid Brody, in order for him to go back to where he came from. Brody concludes the reason for that is because she doesn't want her daughter to marry Rex. And he understands why she is right in doing that. They both know that he has no claim on Gigi and Adriana may have no claim on Rex.",
