    "soap_central": "\nThe Rites and Wrongs of Spring\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, while Dorian and Ray tried to make sense of Lola's gibberish, Lola insinuated that she had done something terrible to Langston and Markko. Ray wondered if Lola had taken drugs. Upon examining Lola's pupils and observing her sweaty palms, Dorian surmised that Lola had taken LSD. Dorian demanded to know what terrible thing that Lola had done to Langston and Markko. Dorian was horrified when a drugged Lola asked, \"Do condoms work when you poke holes into them?\" \n\n\nInside their room at the Palace Hotel, Markko was shocked to learn that Dorian had given Langston condoms. Langston told Markko that Dorian's actions proved that she cared deeply for her. Placing the condom in Markko's hand, Langston reminded him that they needed to protect themselves. Appearing hesitant, Markko stated that he wasn't certain that he could continue with their plans. Placing gentle kisses on Markko's neck, Langston said that she loved him and was ready to have a sexual relationship. Hand in hand, they approached the bed. \n\n\nAs they kissed passionately, Langston ripped open the condom wrapper. They were startled when Langston's cell phone rang. Upon realizing that Dorian was the caller, Langton became enraged and ignored Dorian's call. She was certain that Dorian's call was an attempt to discourage Langston from making love to Markko. After receiving no answer from either Langston or Markko's cell phones, Dorian phoned their hotel room directly. Advising Langston that Dorian would show up at the hotel if they didn't answer, Markko persuaded Langston to speak with Dorian. \n\n\nHysterical, Dorian warned Langston that the condoms were defective and begged her not to use them. Realizing that Dorian's warning was legitimate, Langston promised not to use the condoms. After informing Markko about the condoms, Langston told him that they couldn't have sex unless they practiced safe sex. Presenting her with condoms that he had purchased, Markko told Langston that he didn't feel comfortable using birth control that Dorian had provided them. They kissed and began undressing each other. After making love, Langston told Markko that it was better than she had imagined. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Ray listened as Lola insisted that she had done several bad things. Lola remarked that she had done something awful to her father. Lola's hallucinations grew worse and she had visions that Dorian was her dead mother. Ray listened in disbelief as Lola screamed, \"How could you be here when I killed you?\" \n\n\nLola began to detail the events that led up to her mother's death. After discovering her mother in bed with another man, Lola had murdered her and made Ray pay for her crime. As Lola burst into tears and apologized to her father, Ray cradled Lola in his arms and told her that everything was going to be all right. A look of sadness fell upon Dorian's face. \n\n\nInside Kevin's old room at the KAD house, Powell insisted that Todd deserved to die. Powell demanded that T\u00e9a, Blair, and Marty take charge of their lives. Powell ordered one of the women to take a stand and kill Todd. To everyone's surprise, T\u00e9a asked Powell to untie her and promised that she would be the one to kill Todd. While Marty begged T\u00e9a not to become a pawn in Powell's vendetta, Blair realized that T\u00e9a had a plan and Blair encouraged T\u00e9a to kill Todd. Shackled to the bed, Todd urged Powell to release the women, and commit the act of murder himself. \n\n\nPowell announced that he would allow T\u00e9a to kill Todd. Afterward, Powell would disappear, and Blair, Marty, and T\u00e9a would receive the justice that they deserved. As he untied T\u00e9a, Powell handed her a gun and pointed her in Todd's direction. Accepting the revolver from Powell, T\u00e9a turned the gun on him instead. As Powell laughed, T\u00e9a pulled the trigger and discovered that the gun was empty. Stating that he knew T\u00e9a wasn't capable of killing Todd, Powell retrieved his knife and another gun. \n\n\nWhen Powell placed the knife to T\u00e9a's throat, Todd begged Powell not to harm her. Realizing that Todd had feelings for T\u00e9a, Powell ordered Todd to chose which woman he wanted to live - he announced that the remaining two would die. Marty pleaded with Powell to stop his insane behavior, but Powell insisted that he was doing it for her, and that he could never hurt Marty again. As Marty and Todd looked on, Powell ushered T\u00e9a and Blair out of the room at gunpoint. \n\n\nPowell escorted T\u00e9a and Blair to the basement of the old fraternity house. Upon realizing that Powell intended to lock them inside a small room, T\u00e9a broke away and ran up the stairs. As Blair looked on in horror, Powell shot T\u00e9a, who let out a scream and fell down the stairs. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Marty had vivid memories of the night that she was raped inside the fraternity house. Todd realized that Marty was in trouble. He wanted to help her but couldn't. As Marty screamed hysterically, Todd begged her to tell him what was wrong. \n\n\nKyle was surprised when Rebecca answered Todd's door. Kyle questioned why his sister was at Todd's home, but Rebecca lied and said that she was babysitting Todd's children. When Rebecca asked Kyle what business he had with Todd, Kyle revealed how he had acquired information about Todd's grandchild being alive, and admitted that he wanted to make Todd pay for the information. As Rebecca looked over the proof detailing Hope's identity, she told Kyle that he could get into trouble if he were involved in such a scheme, and insisted that she could help him. Instructing her brother to remain with the boys, Rebecca left. Meanwhile, Kyle wondered where his sister had gone. \n\n\nAfter a secret night out on the town, Jessica and Brody shared a kiss inside the bedroom of a sleeping Chloe. Staring deep into Jessica's eyes, Brody said that he didn't want the evening to end. Hovering over her sleeping child, Jessica said how much she cherished her daughters and that she loved being a mom. Acknowledging that she couldn't protect them forever, Jessica wished that the girls' lives would remain peaceful for as long as possible. \n\n\nWhen Jessica expressed her desire to tell the world that she and Brody were in love, Brody assured Jessica that they would soon be able to reveal their secret, and urged her to attend Natalie and Jared's wedding without him. Jessica said that she was lucky to have an amazing guy like Brody in her life, as well as her two beautiful daughters. An emotional Jessica stated that she once had no hope, but was grateful that she had found hope after all. \n\n\nAs Jessica and Brody kissed goodbye, Bree entered the room and questioned why her mother was kissing Brody. After Jessica explained that Brody was her special friend, Bree begged her to bring Brody to the wedding, but Jessica insisted that the little girl keep Brody a secret. Later, Jessica expressed her regret about asking Bree to keep her knowledge of Brody a secret. While Brody tried to convince her that their secret wasn't hurting anyone, Jessica had a flashback of the night that Tess gave birth to Chloe. Jessica remembered Tess begging the infant to cry. \n\n\nWhen Jessica told Brody that she had a fear of losing Chloe, Brody was certain that Jessica's fears were a result of concern over Shane's illness. Jessica's thoughts turned to Starr and Cole's efforts to have their baby's body exhumed. Brody assured Jessica that she didn't have anything to worry about. \n\n\nLater, Rebecca entered Chloe's room at Llanfair. Standing over the sleeping child's bed, Rebecca smiled at her.\n\n\n \n\n\n",
