Kevin said that there were two people to blame and then shared how angry he had been when he had found Duke and Kelly together. He had been so angry that in his son's final moments, he hadn't told Duke that he loved him. Kevin also revealed that Spencer had made him play God and decide whether Kelly or Duke should be operated on first, since there weren't enough doctors available to do two surgeries. After telling Kelly that he had chosen her, feeling Duke was strong enough to hold on, he forced her to look at a picture of the boy he had lost...his only son. \n\n\nDorian thanked Spencer for saving Kelly's life, but it was a loaded apology. She told Spencer how ironic it was that he had gotten a chance to really stick it to the Buchanans by forcing Kevin to make the choice of who should be operated on first. Because of Kevin's decision, the ultimate pain had been inflicted on the Buchanans, which played out in Spencer's favor with Duke dying. \n\n\nSpencer was appalled that Dorian would think that he had wanted Duke to die, but Dorian stated he had caused pain, destruction, and divisions in families since his arrival in town. She said Duke's death had to be the icing on the cake for Spencer. He accused Dorian of being heartless, and Dorian countered that, although he might have a heart, he had no soul. A usually composed Spencer lost control after Dorian left.\n\n\nThe phone fell on the floor, and Evangeline reached over to pick it up while Cristian tried to help her. Evangeline told him that she had to learn how to do those things for herself, since her sight was gone. She informed him that although she might not be able to help herself, she was more determined than ever to help Todd. Cristian couldn't believe that she would put Todd's well-being over her own recovery, but she argued that despite her injuries, she was still alive, whereas, without her help, Todd's life would end. Cristian's frustration with Evangeline's stubbornness led him to leave, since Evangeline didn't seem to want to hear what he had to say. However, Evangeline asked him to stay. \n\n\nBlair visited Todd in prison and advised him of the storm and the casualties and destruction it had left behind. She told him that Duke had been killed, and Todd asked how Viki was holding up. She hesitantly revealed that Evangeline had been hurt by glass and might be permanently blind, but he didn't believe her, stating that it was another one of Spencer's tricks. Blair eventually convinced him that it was the truth, leaving Todd feeling hopeless, since the one person who cared about him and believed in him could no longer help him. \n\n\nBlair insisted that she, too, did not want Todd to die -- not because she still loved him but simply out of compassion. Todd accused her of lying about her feelings, even though she was sleeping with the enemy, and implored her to make things right between them, since they only had a few weeks left. Blair left and ran to Spencer, who was also in need of comfort after Dorian's hateful words.\n\n\nNash and Tess had to quickly thought up a name when a hospital representative had demanded to know the baby's name as well as the mother's so that she could issue the birth certificate. Tess decided to call the baby Brennan and named Jessica as the mother, since Tess was not legally a person. While Nash was escorting their \"guest\" out, Tess had another encounter with Jessica, who wanted the chance to hold her baby. Tess asked if Jessica were ready to face the truth about what had happened when she had been a child, which caused Jessica to retreat again. \n\n\nNash received a call from Mr. Reston, who issued a veiled threat against Brennan. Tess walked into the room as Nash was hanging up, and she inquired about who had been on the phone. Nash lied and said that it had been a telemarketer. \n\n\nClaudia paid a recovering Antonio a visit in the hospital. She told Antonio that all she wanted was a chance to start over again. Antonio pointed out how coincidental it was that she had decided to start over in the same place that her ex was living. Claudia tried to cover by telling Antonio that she wanted a chance to give back and help others who might also be recovering from addiction and that it also gave her an opportunity to help Antonio protect Tess from Nash. Claudia also asked him for a job in his club, but not as a waitress -- as a singer. Antonio was suspicious, since Claudia didn't need the money, but Claudia told him that her therapist had recommended that she find a reason to get up in the morning -- something that didn't involve Nash or pills. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "A woman from the hospital comes asking for information for the birth certificate. Tess puts Jess's name as the mother and Nash's name as the father. She did that as Jess is considered the real person. She put Nash's name down as that will be a way to claim the baby later. While in the bathroom, Jessica appears thanking Tess for handling things the way that she did, as she would have done the same thing. Kevin is torn. He was told that he had to make a choice between his son and his wife. \"I chose you Kelly! I thought that he was strong enough and he wasn't. I didn't get to spend time with him and that is your fault!\" He doesn't have to tell her all this. She blames herself for Duke being dead. Evangeline tries to take care of herself. She can't. Chris offers to be there for her. He calls his trainer and tells the man that he can't fight that night. He is busy. The man isn't happy. \"If you think that you can bail on me, you have another thing coming kid.\" Evangeline sees that she needs help and allows Chris to escort her out of the hospital, without use of the wheelchair. Todd gets a visit with Blair. \"Are you still sleeping with the enemy?\" he asks. She tells him that Evangeline is blind and he doesn't believe her. She leaves after telling him that she doesn't love him anymore. \"I don't want you killed that is all.\" She leaves to go and be with Spencer who she finds in the shower. Todd, on the other hand gets beaten up by guards before being taken back to his cell.",
