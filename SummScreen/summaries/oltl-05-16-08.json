Adriana surprised everyone when she exclaimed, \"Rex isn't here because he's with her.\" While Layla, Natalie, Sarah, and Talia all attempted to calm the bride's nerves, Dorian did very little to comfort her daughter and even suggested that Rex had \"cold feet.\" Before leaving the room, Bo assured Adriana that Rex was simply running a little late. Alone with her mother, Adriana asked Dorian if she had convinced Brody to come to the church and reunite with Gigi. With a smug look, Dorian stated that she had done everything in her power to \"induce Brody into doing the right thing.\" After Dorian left the room, a nervous Adriana asked Layla if Brody and Gigi were present at the church. Layla advised Adriana that she should focus on Rex showing up and forget about Gigi and Brody. Adriana insisted that it was necessary for Brody to be there in case Gigi came. \n\n\nIn the church chapel, Roxy expressed to Viki her nervousness over witnessing Rex and Adriana together right before the wedding. After convincing Roxy to put her superstitious beliefs aside for the day, Viki spoke with Charlie. Charlie told Viki that Rex was missing and felt his earlier conversation with Rex might have placed doubt in Rex's mind. Marcie overheard Viki and Charlie's conversation, and placed a call to Gigi. On Gigi's voicemail, Marcie asked if she had told Rex that Shane was his son. \n\n\nHolding the picture of him and Gigi, Brody sat at a bus station. Consumed with thoughts of Gigi, Brody had flashbacks about years ago when a pregnant Gigi saw him off on his deployment day. Brody had told Gigi that he loved her and would come back eventually to take care of her and her baby. He claimed to love her, although he knew she didn't love him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Rex and Gigi nearly kissed, but were interrupted by Michael. Showing no reaction to what he almost witnessed, Michael informed Gigi that Shane was fine and would be released soon. When Gigi stepped away, Rex began accusing Michael of suspecting that he had had feelings for Gigi. Rex attempted to convince Michael that he was only concerned about Shane's health and professed his love for Adriana. He adamantly denied having any feelings for Gigi. When Michael stated that he didn't have any thoughts about Rex's relationship with Gigi, Rex told Michael that he felt Michael should know the truth. Michael informed Rex that perhaps he should face the truth himself. Their conversation was interrupted when Gigi appeared and told Rex that Shane wanted to see him. Shane wondered why Rex wasn't at the church. When Rex told the child that he wanted to make sure that Shane was all right, Shane asked Rex if he still intended to marry Adriana. \n\n\nOutside in the hall, Gigi apologized for Shane's questioning about the wedding and reminded a confused Rex that Adriana was waiting for him at the church. Rex, who appeared torn over his true feelings for Gigi, took Gigi's advice and headed to the church. As she watched Rex walk away, Gigi was heartbroken. Once Shane was released, he begged Gigi to take him to the wedding. While Shane dressed, Michael told Gigi that she didn't appear to really want to attend Rex's wedding. Gigi admitted that she had tried desperately to get out of it, but realized that maybe it was a wedding she was meant to attend. Under her breath, Gigi murmured, \"Maybe seeing Rex marry another woman is the only way to forget about him once and for all.\" \n\n\nIn another part of the church, the groomsmen gathered and waited for Rex's arrival. Antonio and Cris vented to Bo about Rex's failure to appear. The brothers threatened to physically harm Rex if he stood Adriana up at the altar, but Bo argued that Rex would never do anything to hurt Adriana. While Bo defended Rex, Dorian entered the room and demanded that Bo make an announcement to the guests informing them that the wedding would not take place. Bo refused to make such an announcement without the approval of either Rex or Adriana. As Dorian persisted, Bo reminded her that Rex wasn't \"Ditch 'em at the altar\" David Vickers. Before a heated Dorian could respond, Rex appeared. Antonio and Cris both punched Rex in the arm, and Dorian glared at him. Antonio and Cris headed to the chapel and Dorian went to inform Adriana of Rex's arrival. As Dorian closed the door behind her, she looked distressed. Alone with Rex, Bo told him that everyone was worried that he wasn't going to show up. Realizing that Rex was out of sorts, Bo asked if everyone had a right to be concerned. Rex assured Bo that there was nothing to worry about, but looked distraught as she stared at himself in the mirror. \n\n\nDorian informed Adriana and the bridesmaids that Rex had arrived. After the bridesmaids had left, Adriana asked Dorian if Rex had been with Gigi during his absence. When Dorian was unable to provide her with an answer, Adriana nervously exclaimed that all that mattered was that Rex was at the church and she would soon be Mrs. Rex Bolsom. As Dorian helped Adriana with the finishing touches, Adriana apologized for the way she had recently treated her mother and told her that she loved her. Dorian appeared touched and accepted her daughter's apology. Dorian headed off to the chapel. Gigi had arrived and was speaking with Marcie. Just as Marcie began questioning Gigi about her conversation with Rex, Dorian interrupted and asked to speak with Gigi alone. Dorian told Gigi that she was aware that Gigi still loved Rex and that Rex was Shane's father. Dorian insisted that Gigi do the right thing and tell Rex the truth. Realizing that Dorian wanted her to stop the wedding, Gigi refused to use Shane to come between Rex and Adriana. Dorian stated that Rex deserved to know the truth and that Gigi would have to make the right decision. \n\n\nThe wedding began. As Rex walked down the aisle, he paused when he reached Gigi and Shane's pew. Shane smiled at Rex, but a nervous look crossed Gigi's face. Rex stared at Gigi and Shane then proceeded down the aisle. Adriana walked proudly down the aisle. When she reached the altar, she smiled happily at Rex, but nervously looked back and glared at Gigi. The priest asked if anyone present had any reason why the couple should not be wed. Dorian looked back at Gigi and silently willed her to interrupt the wedding. Gigi eyed Dorian and attempted to say something. She opened her mouth, but no sound came out. \n\n\nWhile Brody held the photo, the announcement was made that the last bus was leaving for Norfolk, Virginia. Leaving the photo behind, Brody stood up and appeared to have gotten on the bus. \n\n\nIn Virginia Beach, an angry Todd left Blair a voicemail and faulted her and John for leading him on a wild goose chase. At that very moment, Starr and Cole sat in bed at the boarding house and discussed Starr's pregnancy. As they looked through a pregnancy book, Cole and Starr became emotional when they learned that on Starr's next doctor's visit, they would be able to hear the baby's heartbeat. Meanwhile, John and Blair stood outside a room a few feet away from Starr and Cole's room and prepared to enter. When John barged into the room, he and Blair were surprised to discover two teens in bed-who weren't Starr and Cole. The startled female teen let out a loud scream, which was heard by Starr and Cole. Cole quietly opened the door and was shocked to witness John and Blair questioning their neighbors. Cole immediately closed the door and reported his observations to Starr; he told her they needed to leave right away. \n\n\nAfter questioning the teens, John learned that they had arrived in town only hours earlier and had never met Starr and Cole. Blair questioned why Winter would lie about Starr and Cole's location, but John believed Winter didn't lie but had a terrible sense of direction. John approached the room occupied by Starr and Cole and opened the unlocked door. Upon entering the kid's room, Blair discovered Starr's clothing and John surmised that they had recently left. As Blair looked around the disheveled room and wondered why Starr would leave her home and live there, John picked up a pregnancy pamphlet. He read the pamphlet, but said nothing to Blair. \n\n\nStarr and Cole ran off but were unable to get very far because Starr's breathing was labored. Cole was certain that John and Blair hadn't seen them. Realizing Starr was frightened, he held her and said that this was not the life he had planned for her. Cole reminded Starr of her earlier request to be with her mother, and asked if she wanted to go back home with Blair. Starr assured Cole that she wanted to be with him. After noticing the \"missing\" flyers baring their faces, Cole told Starr of his plan to leave Virginia Beach immediately. While the teens attempted to hide their appearances by placing their hoods over their heads, Todd walked past-unaware that Starr and Cole were right under his nose. As Starr and Cole walked along the boardwalk, Todd turned around and called out Starr's name. After turning around and spotting Todd, Starr and Cole fled with Todd following close behind. Believing they had evaded Todd, Starr and Cole hid behind a building and Starr attempted to catch her breath. Cole tried to convince Starr that they had escaped Todd. Suddenly, Todd appeared and tried to coax Starr into leaving with him. Meanwhile, John and Blair prepared to leave the room and continue their search for the kids. John looked out the window and observed Starr and Cole interacting with Todd. John alerted Blair and the two ran off to help the kids. On the boardwalk, Starr screamed for Todd to leave her alone. Todd punched Cole and pushed Starr out of the way. When Starr tried to prevent Todd from assaulting Cole further, Todd pushed Starr again. Starr lost her balance and fell. Blair and John approached, and watched in horror as Starr tumbled down a flight of stairs. Todd stood in shock. \n\n\n",
