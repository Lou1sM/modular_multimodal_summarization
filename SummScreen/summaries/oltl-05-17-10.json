    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the prom, everyone was very excited to be there that they sang \"I Got a Feeling\" by the Black Eyed Peas. During the song, Cristian told Layla how beautiful she looked, but she didn't look very thrilled. Cristian wondered why, and Layla said that she saw Jessica \"staring daggers\" at her. Cristian told Layla not to let Jessica get to her. A few feet away, Brody told Jessica how beautiful she looked. Wanting to be nice, Jessica told Brody that he cleaned up well.\n\n\nMarkko wanted to dance, but Langston said they could dance in a little bit. Starr noticed that Langston didn't seem very thrilled about prom. Langston covered by saying that she felt bad for Starr, but Starr told Langston not to worry and pushed her onto the dance floor.\n\n\nDarren announced that it was time to start voting for Prom King and Queen. He told Destiny that she was his queen, to Destiny's disgust. Matthew and Dani each revealed that they voted for the other. When Matthew got up to put their votes in the box, Nate sat and told Dani that he voted for her as well. He also confessed that he had been very close to asking Dani to the prom, but Matthew had beaten him to it.\n\n\nAs Marty read John's letter from Natalie, John walked into his office. She quickly hid the letter and asked about Cole, and wondered if she could see him. John said that Marty could see her son, as soon as she revealed what was on her mind. Just then, Dorian entered John's office and told the couple that they were going to bust Cole out of jail. When John refused, Dorian reminded the cop that he technically worked for her since she was the mayor. She reasoned that Cole would be back by morning, but he had to go to the prom to be with Starr. They were meant to be.\n\n\nIn his jail cell, Cole was listening to his iPod when John asked if there was anything he could get for Cole. Cole only said that he wished he could do something about the fact that he was supposed to be at the prom with Starr. However, Starr probably didn't want to see him, anyway, and he wasn't sure that he wanted to see her either. He explained to John how Starr had accused Hannah of pushing Marty down the stairs. He thought it was crazy, but John looked skeptical of Cole's opinion.\n\n\nAcross the hall, Todd was being put back into his cell. John asked Cole if he would be all right, and Cole said that thoughts of Starr kept Cole far away. \"The Starr that knows I'm innocent and you're guilty?\" Todd asked. Ignoring Todd, Cole said that no matter what happened, he and Starr would still love each other. John said he would be back later and left. Todd taunted Cole by saying that Starr would always choose him over Cole and that she had probably already found a replacement date for the prom. According to Todd, Starr would never forgive Cole for what he did to Todd and would forget all about him.\n\n\nNatalie entered Foxy Roxy's with a suitcase because she believed John wouldn't show up at Rodi's. Roxy asked what John said after he read the letter, but Natalie admitted to running away before she could see him read it. Roxy assured Natalie that John was crazy about her and that he would definitely show up. Natalie thought it was wrong to send him the letter, but Roxy countered that it was only honest. Roxy said that Natalie was the only woman who ever had a strong hold on John, so Natalie should go to Rodi's after a makeover.\n\n\nIn his apartment, Ford texted Langston, \"Can't you slip away?\" Langston called Ford and told him that she couldn't see him because she was with Markko, and she couldn't hurt him. \"But it's okay to hurt me?\" he asked. He told Langston that he missed her and hung up. A few minutes later, Karen showed up at Ford's door with a pizza.\n\n\nTalking to Matthew, Starr hoped that Dani was having fun. Looking glum, Matthew said he wished he had a time machine to change Langston's mind about writing the musical about Starr and Cole. That way, Dani would never have met Nate. Starr sympathized with him, and wished she could go back in time too.\n\n\nJessica approached Cristian and Layla at their table, and explained that \"our song\" was going to play. Cristian reiterated that he was with Layla and she was the only woman he wanted to dance with. As the couple got up to dance, Jessica began to sing \"If I Could Turn Back Time,\" as she though about Cristian. Brody joined in, having flashbacks of the good times he had with Jessica. Layla thought about how happy she was with Cristian as Langston was conflicted between Markko and Ford. Starr thought about Cole in his jail cell.\n\n\nIn John's office, he explained that, if they got Cole out of prison, even for a night, Todd's lawyers would have a field day. Dorian said that they would just have to be creative. Todd was taken to John's office, where John offered to have Todd file a complaint to Internal Affairs about bad treatment. Todd jumped on the chance, even though he wondered why he couldn't just fill the paper out in his cell. John explained that it was supposed to be done in private and he was doing things by the book.\n\n\nAs Todd was occupied with the papers, Dorian and Marty told Cole that he was going to the prom. Cole wondered why since Starr wasn't even there. Dorian explained that everything was arranged and that he was going to surprise his girlfriend. Cole protested, alleging that things between the two weren't good. Dorian said that was because of other people, but that Starr and Cole were meant to be.\n\n\nAt the prom, Markko explained that he had wanted it to be a surprise, but that he was taking Langston to the same room at the Palace they had the year before. Langston objected, saying that they didn't need a hotel room when they had their own apartment. Claiming she had to splash water on her face, Langston ran out of the room.\n\n\nDarren asked Destiny to dance. She initially refused, but changed her mind when she noticed Matthew and Dani dancing. As Brody and Jessica danced a few feet away, Jessica suddenly had an image of herself and Brody dancing in Rodi's the night before Natalie and Jared's wedding. Panic-stricken, Jessica walked away from Brody. He followed her and knew that she had remembered something about him. Adamantly denying the claim, she walked away from him.\n\n\nNate got Starr some punch and she thanked him. He asked her if she believed that two people could be meant to be. They both admitted to believing it. After Nate got up, Starr said that she believed, even though Cole didn't anymore.  Sadly watching all of the happy couples dancing, Starr sang \"I Can't Live If I Don't.\"\n\n\nLater, Starr danced with Matthew and thanked him for keeping her mind off of Cole. As Markko filmed the fun of the prom, Langston realized that she had to tell Markko about Ford. On her way to find Markko, Langston overheard Cristian and Layla talking about how Ford was probably in the apartment with Karen. They didn't understand why Ford didn't just call Karen over to have sex instead of ordering food every time. Not believing them, Langston called Ford, who didn't answer his phone. She left, leaving Starr and Markko looking for her.\n\n\nStarr told Markko about when she went to the jail and Hannah was there with Cole. She didn't think that she and Cole were meant to be anymore. In order to cheer her up, Markko sang \"We Fall\" to Starr. As the song went on, Matthew was jealous as he watched Dani and Nate dance. Jessica was writing a note to Cristian as Brody looked for her. Cole was getting ready for the prom. Roxy was giving Natalie a makeover. Todd filled out the papers for his complaint as John helped Cole make a clean getaway. When the song was over, Starr hugged Markko.\n\n\nAs Todd was being escorted back to his jail cell, John asked Marty if Cole was happy. When she softly said yes, John realized that she wasn't happy. Handing Natalie's letter to John, she said that she had something that belonged to him.\n\n\nWhitney asked Markko if he was going to be filming the coronation. Markko said he was running low on memory, but he was sure that he could find something to tape over.\n\n\nIn the gym, Cristian wanted to talk to Layla about something. Assuming he wanted to talk about Jessica, Layla shushed him until he stopped trying to talk. \"Just hold me,\" she said, and they danced.\n\n\nAs Starr remembered happier times at past proms with Cole, she sang \"I'm the One.\" During the song, Langston went to Ford's apartment. Seeing the pizza box outside the door, she walked in and saw Karen and Ford getting hot and heavy. Markko, looking for something to tape over, saw the footage of Destiny and Matthew talking about Markko's cheating girlfriend. Jessica left her note at Cristian's table. Matthew pulled Dani close and kissed her as Nate sadly watched from across the room. Todd, back in his cell, looked across at Cole's cell. There were pillows stuffed under the blanket on the bed in the cell to make it look like Cole was there. Natalie, in front of Rodi's, took a deep breath and walked in to find the place empty. John read Natalie's letter while Marty painfully watched. At the end of the song, a police car pulled up in front of the school and confused Starr. Corsage in hand, Cole stepped out of the car.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The prom is underway. Many people sing songs about their love lives. Starr is missing Cole. Dorian arranges for John to let him out of jail so he can be at the prom with Starr to surprise her. It appears that Langston finds out that Ford is not faithful to her and sleeping with Karen while Markko plays the video where Destiny tells Matthew that she saw Langston cheating on Markko with Ford. Brody still wants to get Jessica back but she still has Cristian on the brain. Natalie concludes that since John did not respond to her letter that he's made the decision to be done with her. But Roxy seems to somehow know that that is not true. And all the while John has been unaware that Natalie wrote him the letter since Marty hid it from him. But when she reveals the letter to him, he might be changing his priorities for who he wants to be with.",
