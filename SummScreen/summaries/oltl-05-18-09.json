Starr stated that she had a weird feeling that everything would change as a result of Hope's body being exhumed. \n\n\nUpon entering the house, Starr and Cole were startled to discover Kyle relaxing on the couch. Starr wondered if Kyle had information regarding Hope's DNA test, but Kyle lied and claimed that he had been hired to babysit Jack and Sam. Certain that Kyle was up to something, Cole sent Starr upstairs to check on the boys. \n\n\nMeanwhile, as John drove around in search of Marty, Pete offered advice on how to locate Marty. Reminding himself that Pete was a hallucination, John tried to tune him out, but Pete persisted. Pete gave John clues on where Powell had possibly taken Marty. \n\n\nAlone with Kyle, Cole demanded to know what information Kyle had concerning Hope. Before Kyle could respond, a telephone call interrupted the conversation. Desperate to evade Cole's questioning, Kyle rushed to answer Todd's phone. Assuming that Rebecca was the caller, Kyle called out her name. John suggested that Kyle guess again and demanded to know Rebecca and Powell's whereabouts. When John remarked that Kyle was in serious trouble, a nervous Kyle hung up the phone. \n\n\nAs Cole continued to question Kyle, Starr rushed downstairs with a despondent Jack. Starr related that she had discovered Sam asleep and Jack hiding in an upstairs closet. Citing that Jack was terrified and refused to talk, Starr was certain that something terrible had happened to her parents. Cornered, Kyle tried to run away, but Officer Fish, his old fraternity brother, apprehended Kyle at the front door. \n\n\nKyle attempted to convince Fish to let him go, but Fish refused. Fish revealed that John had phoned and was convinced that Kyle was involved in a crime. John arrived on the scene and demanded answers, but Kyle wouldn't provide any. When Cole inquired about his mother, John didn't give Cole any details. But he did promise to find Marty. \n\n\nAfter Fish placed Kyle under arrest and took him to the police station for questioning, John sought answers from a frightened Jack, who sat in complete silence. Providing him with pictures of Powell and Rebecca, John enlisted Jack's help in finding Todd and Blair. Finally, Jack broke his silence. The terrified child told John that Powell had taken his parents and T\u00e9a away. He said that Powell had threatened to hurt Sam if he told anyone the truth. Jack begged John to find his parents. \n\n\nOutside of Llanfair, Natalie and Jared enjoyed a romantic moment. Natalie stated that she was delighted that they had gotten married. The happy times came to an abrupt halt, when Jared reminded Natalie that the truth about Starr's baby would be revealed in a few hours. Worried about how Jessica would handle the news, Natalie expressed her wish that Jessica would never learn that her child was dead. As Jared reassured Natalie that he would stand by her side, Natalie realized that things would never be the same again. \n\n\nOn the other side of the door, Jessica and Brody shared a goodnight kiss. Brody said that he didn't want to leave, but Jessica reminded him that they couldn't risk Natalie finding them together. Brody decided to leave, and Jessica headed upstairs to check on Chloe. \n\n\nUpstairs, Rebecca smiled as she leaned over Chloe's bed. Rebecca told the child that she was in the wrong house. Rebecca hid when Jessica entered the room. As Rebecca peered around the corner of the room, Jessica wondered why Chloe was awake. \n\n\nWhen Brody opened the door, he discovered Natalie in Jared's arms, as if he were carrying her over the threshold. After spotting Brody, Natalie demanded to know why he was at Llanfair. Accusing him of breaking into the house, Natalie lashed out at Brody and insisted that he was stalking Jessica. Upon hearing the commotion, Jessica emerged and tried to calm Natalie. Unable to reason with her sister, Jessica told Natalie that she and Brody were involved and that it was a complicated matter. Natalie grew concerned when Jessica refused to comment any further. \n\n\nWhen Natalie expressed a concern about Jessica's state of mind, Jessica became alarmed, and wondered if Natalie thought she was having a relapse. After assuring Natalie that she was fine, Jessica noticed the wedding band on Natalie's finger and asked if Natalie and Jared had gotten married. Both Natalie and Jared stood speechless. When Jared denied Jessica's revelation, Jessica was certain that the couple were married. She informed them that they didn't need to lie because they hadn't done anything wrong. \n\n\nJessica observed Natalie and Jared exchange nervous glances. Natalie insisted on locating Viki at once. Sensing that her sister was withholding information, Jessica demanded to know what Natalie and Jared were hiding. Suddenly, Jessica experienced a flashback of Tess giving birth and pleading with the child to cry. Jessica raced off to check on Chloe. \n\n\nNatalie asked Brody to leave. Convinced that trouble was brewing and that Jessica might need him, Brody refused to leave. Meanwhile, Jessica entered Chloe's room and discovered that the child was missing. \n\n\nIn the basement of the KAD house, Powell shot and wounded T\u00e9a after she tried to escape. A panicked Blair told Powell that he had killed T\u00e9a, who lay unconscious on the ground. After checking her pulse, Powell announced, \"She's not dead yet! The party is just getting started!\" \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a regained consciousness, Powell pushed her and Blair inside a small, dark room in the basement. Hysterical, T\u00e9a began verbally attacking Powell. Referring to him as a rapist, T\u00e9a insisted that he was doing the same thing to them that he had done to Marty, several years earlier - holding an innocent woman against her will. Powell became enraged when T\u00e9a remarked that Powell was just as bad as Todd. Fed up with T\u00e9a's harsh words, an angered Powell broke the gas valve, causing a gas leak. As he padlocked the door, Powell laughed and informed the women that they didn't have long to live. \n\n\nAs he headed upstairs, Powell discovered Rebecca at the door, with Chloe in her arms. Rebecca told Powell that Chloe was the ultimate prize. \n\n\nAs gas filled the basement, Blair blamed T\u00e9a for upsetting Powell and placing them in danger. Declaring that her children wouldn't become orphans, Blair ordered T\u00e9a to help her break out of the basement. In an attempt to prevent the gas from escaping, the women removed their clothing and covered the holes in the gas pipe. Upon noticing a window, Blair hoisted T\u00e9a up toward the window. Unable to reach the window, T\u00e9a fell and was knocked unconscious. After Blair managed to wake her, T\u00e9a screamed that they were going to die together in the basement. Blair ordered T\u00e9a to pull herself together and help plan an escape. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs in Kevin's old room, Marty's memories of the night she was raped in the fraternity house came flooding back to her. A shackled Todd watched as Marty began to recall explicit details of that fateful night. Upon realizing that Marty had regained her memory, Todd helped her remember everything about that night. When an angry Marty remarked that she knew what he had done to her and hated remembering, Todd encouraged her to remember everything that had taken place that night. Although he hated the fact that Marty recalled how he had hurt her, Todd insisted that she needed to remember in order to regain control of her life. Todd listened as Marty recounted vivid memories of the night of the rape. \n\n\nWith Todd's assistance, Marty began to remember details about her marriage to Patrick and giving birth to Cole. Marty recalled Patrick's favorite poem, \"Roses in December.\" A smile crossed Marty's face when she realized that she remembered her son. As Marty continued to reminisce about her past, Powell entered the room holding Chloe and interrupted her thoughts. A stunned Marty wondered what Powell was doing with Jessica's baby.\n\n\n",
