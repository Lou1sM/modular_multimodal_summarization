    "soap_central": "\n\nStarr was amazed when Cole emerged from a police car in front of the high school. \"It's the prom. I'm here for you,\" he said to her. He asked her to be his date. She couldn't understand how he was even there and not in jail, and he told her he had a fairy godmother. Starr wanted to be sure to thank Dorian and John.\n\n\nInside the school, Markko looked at the old video that showed Destiny telling Matthew that Langston was cheating on Markko. The disbelief spread across Markko's face. Dani agreed to dance with Matthew but Nate was left alone as Whitney attended to her official prom duties. Darren wanted to dance with Destiny, but she brushed him off. She was saved when Whitney pulled Darren aside so they could count the ballots for the Prom King and Queen.\n\n\nLayla admitted to Cristian that chaperoning wasn't so bad as long as Jessica kept her distance. Brody jokingly accused Jessica of voting for herself for Prom Queen and teased that he was willing to wear a crown for her in the event that she won the contest. Jessica gravely told him he wasn't a student and therefore wouldn't be entitled to wear a crown. Brody grabbed Whitney and Darren and asked them about it, loudly. They told him that a student or the date of a student was entitled to wear the crown. Brody laughed that his vote wasn't in vain.\n\n\nLangston walked into Ford's apartment and stared in amazement. Ford and Karen were unclothed and about to have sex. Langston shouted, \"What is this?\" Karen jumped up and began to replace her clothing as Ford stuttered, \"It's not what it looks like.\"\n\n\nLangston and Ford began to sing \"A Lot to Say,\" while at school Markko threw his camera to the ground and sang and danced in anguish.\n\n\nCole was afraid Todd would cause a commotion when he discovered that Cole was gone from his cell, but Cole hoped that Starr had saved a dance. He knew that things weren't right between them, but they needed to remember how things were before. Cole and Starr each stated how much they had missed the other. Cole told Starr how he had wanted to crawl inside of the drawing that Hope had made for him, just so the three of them could be in their private world. Tears rolled down his face as he declared how determined he was to make that happen. Starr couldn't resist adding that it would happen even if they had to go after Hannah for lying. Cole wanted Starr to drop her charge against Hannah, but he knew she wouldn't.\n\n\nBrody accused Jessica of remembering something from the past. \"The door opened\" and she couldn't run away, Brody continued. Jessica denied that she had a recollection of a past occurrence. Brody thought that Jessica had returned to high school to feel safe but he didn't want her to be afraid. He wouldn't let anything happen to her.\n\n\nAfter viewing the old video, Markko headed straight for Matthew and asked where he could find Destiny. Darren continued to pursue Destiny, who did her best to avoid Darren's clutches.\n\n\nDoing his best Michael Jackson impersonation, Darren played a student to Destiny's role of teacher as the students broke out into song. \"The Way You Make Me Feel,\" originally sung by Jackson, changed Destiny's perception of Darren and she fell under his spell. Markko located Destiny and demanded she tell him \"everything you know about Langston and Ford.\" He hurled questions at her as Destiny murmured that maybe she had the wrong idea and perhaps Langston had gone to Ford for help with the play. Matthew urged Destiny to tell the truth, and Destiny proclaimed that she had seen Langston and Ford kissing.\n\n\nCristian promised Layla that the evening would only get better. Whitney and Darren announced the winners of the contest. Jessica had been elected as the Prom Queen and Mr. Vega was the Prom King. Jessica was elated, but Cristian was not amused. Layla was angry and thought that the entire thing was crazy. She suggested that Jessica had stuffed the ballot box. Layla lost her temper and advised Cristian to live out his fantasy with his former flame as she stomped out of the gym.\n\n\nLangston berated Ford for all she had done and gone through for him while he was busy cheating on her. He wanted her to listen to him but she accused him of  \"playing her\" the whole time. As Karen dressed in the corner of the room, Ford accused the pizza delivery girl of pouncing on him when she had seen how upset he was that Langston wasn't there. Karen stood up for herself and ordered Langston not to believe him. She thought that Langston was crazy for leaving a great guy for \"this jerk.\"\n\n\nWhile Langston accused Ford of cheating on her, Ford claimed it was the first time it had happened, but it didn't mean anything. Langston was hurt and told him how much she had cared for him. Ford maintained that his feelings were the same for her, but Langston didn't see how that was possible if he had jumped into bed with someone else. Ford told Langston she mattered, and it was a problem, as he had never felt like that before. He thought that his night with Karen shouldn't have happened, but it was all Langston's fault.\n\n\nLayla, Starr, and Langston performed a version of Jordin Sparks's \"Battlefield.\" Their outfits included boots, fishnet stockings, and a cropped top for Layla. It was sexy and filled with many male dancers.\n\n\nFord blamed Langston for his slip because she was with Markko for the night and allowing him to touch her while they danced. The thought of Langston spending the night with Markko had him crazed, Ford embellished. He had been upset and called Karen, but it was a mistake and he wanted another chance.\n\n\nDestiny, Markko, and Matthew wondered where Langston could be but then they heard that she had walked out of the school. Markko had an idea of where she was, and he was determined to find her.\n\n\nAn exasperated Layla yelled at Cristian because she knew there had been something going on between him and Jessica. He had almost kissed Jessica and was jealous of another guy getting close to her, Layla shrieked. Cristian wouldn't even swear on his mother's life that he had no feelings for Jessica, she added. She accused him of chaperoning merely so he could keep an eye on Jessica. Cristian followed her and maintained his innocence. He vowed that he was not interested in Jessica, didn't love her and never would. He wanted her out of his life. He hadn't sworn on his mother's life because he would never swear on anyone's life but his own, he asserted. He swore on his life that he loved Layla and only her. As he handed her a small box with a ring, Jessica looked on, unseen and upset.\n\n\nCole urged Starr to forget about the rest of the world and their disagreement. He thought they should close their eyes and dance. They walked into the school and found the gym empty. They saw the king and queen crowns and remembered when they wore them at their first prom together. They began to dance in the silence.\n\n\nDarren and Destiny, Dani and Matthew, and the rest of the students took part in \"Together,\" which was a song from the first prom musical.\n\n\nFord and Langston began to kiss, but they were interrupted when Markko walked in.\n\n\nNatalie waited for John at Rodi's as he read her letter in his office at the police station. The clock struck midnight and Natalie was ready to head to the airport, but Roxy arrived and seized Natalie's airplane ticket from her hand. She told Natalie that she couldn't leave. Adamantly, Natalie stressed that John hadn't shown up and she wanted to go to the airport. John had his chance but he had obviously chosen Marty, she pointed out. She wanted her airplane ticket back, but Roxy wouldn't give it to her. Roxy suggested that there were several reasons why John could be late, including his job or an accident. She wanted Natalie to give John one more night and if he didn't show up, Roxy would purchase Natalie a new first-class airplane ticket.\n\n\nNatalie noted that a new ticket would be expensive, but Roxy was so certain that John would show that she wasn't worried about the payment. She suggested that Natalie go to John's office, but Natalie swore that she'd had enough rejection. Roxy accused her of having too much pride and wanted Natalie to give John a chance. Natalie snatched her things and stormed out.\n\n\nAt the police station, Marty confessed that she had taken Natalie's letter from John's desktop, and that was why he hadn't seen it earlier. Marty knew the letter was from Natalie, so she read it and saw that Natalie had made another play for John. Marty was certain John would choose Natalie over her. John couldn't believe that Marty had taken the letter. Marty explained that Dorian had unintentionally made her see the light when Dorian talked about Cole and Starr and what they had been through to be together in spite of Todd. Marty didn't want to be like Todd and keep John and Natalie apart.\n\n\nMarty was annoyed at herself and thought she should have walked the other way instead of lifting the letter, but John thought that Natalie shouldn't have written it in the first place because he and Marty were together. Marty felt they had been living in denial for months, but she was being honest with herself and she was scared. She was ashamed of her behavior, and she couldn't be with someone who created that in her. She wanted to end her relationship with John. She thought he still had feelings for Natalie but put them on hold because of Marty's pregnancy. John insisted that he cared for Marty but, just as vigorously, Marty insisted that he loved Natalie, and she knew that things hadn't been right since she saw John and Natalie kissing.\n\n\nJohn thought they had gotten past that, but Marty assured him it was because she had been pregnant. They were happy and fell in love with the idea of the new baby, she enlightened him. Natalie had been correct in her assumption and since there was no baby, there was no use pretending any longer. John contended that he had never pretended, but Marty said it wasn't on purpose. She thought they had tried too hard and it wasn't right. John wanted to fix things, but Marty assured him it was too late. She wanted his entire heart, and she would never have it.\n\n\nThe two stood in silence briefly until Marty stirred from her thoughts. \"I should go,\" she said to John. \"I'm sorry,\" John replied. \"So am I. It's time,\" Marty said, bidding John goodbye. The two embraced and shared a final kiss as Natalie appeared in the doorway and saw them.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "At the prom and outside, many revelations are made. After Langston tries and fails to contact Ford and overhears Cristian and Layla saying they know he's back at the apartment sleeping with Karen, the pizza girl, she goes over and catches him going at it with Karen. Markko sees the video for the first time where Destiny reveals to Matthew that she saw Langston cheating on Markko with Ford. And he's devastated. She is ready to realize that Ford cannot be trusted. But he somehow manages to seduce her again. And Ford walk in on them and sees it with his own two eyes. Marty gives John the letter that Natalie wrote to him and admits she was ready to prevent him from ever seeing it because of her insecurities. And she concludes that because of that, she knows that John cannot give her what she wants and needs so she has to break up with him. Roxy finds Natalie and demands that she finds out from John what his true feelings are before going off to London. She seems to somehow know that Natalie cannot give up on John. At the prom, Layla concludes to Cristian that she can see he still has feelings for Jessica. She can't deal with it. So they are through. Jessica still has Cristian on the brain and is ignoring Brody. Starr and Cole still have their very serious issues involving the fact that she believes that Hannah is falsely accusing her father of killing his mom's baby, but they decide to enjoy the night together regardless.",
