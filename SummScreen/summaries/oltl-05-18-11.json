    "soap_central": "\n\nJohn was on the phone with Bo, talking about Marty. John had put an Amber Alert out for Liam. John didn't have any leads on Marty. Bo said that the combination of \"a disturbed woman\" who had a weapon and a young child didn't give Liam good odds. John told Bo that he and Brody were about to talk to Marty's therapist.\n\n\nBrody watched Natalie through the window, and Viki saw him. She walked out of the room and hoped Natalie would stay asleep until Liam was found. Brody warned Viki not to let Natalie watch the television, because Marty was most likely all over the news. John told Brody that they had to talk to Dr. Buhari, so they turned to leave. Before John left, he made a point to look in on Natalie.\n\n\nJohn and Brody arrived at Dr. Buhari's office, and asked to see the doctor. The receptionist informed them that the doctor wasn't in her office. They asked for a contact number. The receptionist revealed that she had already tried calling, but the doctor wasn't picking up the phone.\n\n\nJohn and Brody asked the receptionist when the last was that she'd heard from the doctor, and if the doctor had left a note. The receptionist related that it wasn't like Dr. Buhari to just leave, or to cancel appointments. At John's request, the receptionist saw that the doctor's last appointment that day had been with Marty. When Brody noticed blood on the door to the office, John demanded the key to the office.\n\n\nJohn and Brody entered the office with guns drawn to find blood all over the room. John found Dr. Buhari sprawled in the corner of the office. Brody demanded a doctor, and the receptionist ran from the room to get one. John related that it was too late for a doctor, because Dr. Buhari was dead. John realized that Marty had already killed the doctor when she had seen him earlier and shown him Dr. Buhari's signature.\n\n\nA short while later, the crime scene investigators did their job as John and Brody tried to form a timeline of the night. Brody pushed John against the wall and blamed John for what Marty had done to Kelly, Natalie, and Liam. John told Brody to get off, and ordered him out of the room. Brody attributed Marty's release from St. Anne's to John, and wondered if John hated Brody and Natalie that much. Upset, John threatened Brody's life if he ever said anything like that again. John said that they were wasting time that they could be spending looking for Liam.\n\n\nA short while later, Brody apologized to John for being out of line. \"Let's go find your son,\" John told Brody, and the two left.\n\n\nWes fell on the floor, and Cutter got on top of him and kissed him. Wes pushed Cutter off, and informed Cutter that he didn't \"swing that way.\" Wes continued that there were a lot of gay guys in the Navy, so he was comfortable around them. Wes said that he was straight, but that Cutter should be proud and \"come out.\" Wes didn't think that Cutter was being fair to his wife. \"You are my wife!\" Cutter exclaimed.\n\n\nWes was shocked at Cutter's revelation, and turned to leave. Cutter explained Jessica's illness to Wes, and then began to appeal to Tess. He informed Tess that Brody was gone, and promised to keep her safe. He also told Wes what Brody had done with Natalie, which had made Tess emerge. A disbelieving Wes said that Brody would never do that.\n\n\nWes slowly began transforming, and started to cry. Cutter told her not to waste tears on Brody. Suddenly, Jessica recognized Cutter, and asked where they were. She demanded to know where Brody was. When Cutter realized that it was Jessica, he told her that he understood why she didn't want to be in the world. He continued that Brody loved his child, and didn't care about Jessica.\n\n\nSuddenly, Wes told Cutter to leave him alone. Cutter tried to stop Wes from leaving, but Wes punched Cutter. \"I'm not a chick,\" Wes stated. He continued that it seemed like Brody was doing the right thing with his child. Wes decided that he didn't have a problem with Brody's actions, and left.\n\n\nRick sat in bed, watching his newest movie. He exclaimed at how good it was, but how Deanna would have been better. He regretted that her \"boyfriend\" had walked into the room to save her. Through the wall, Rick could hear Liam crying. He pounded on the wall for someone to \"shut that kid up,\" because he was trying to work.\n\n\nMarty frantically searched the room for the recorder. She knew she had to find it because, in the hands of \"the wrong people,\" John could find out that Liam was his baby and not Brody's. In frustration, she threw a glass against the wall, and it shattered. Suddenly, there was a pounding at the door. \"They found us,\" Marty anxiously told Liam.\n\n\nMarty tried to quiet the baby, and yelled for whoever was knocking to leave them alone.  It was Rick, who threatened to call the cops, so she opened the door to him. She apologized, and claimed that she'd tried everything to quiet the child. Rick walked past her, and into the room. He kneeled in front of the baby as Marty picked up her gun.\n\n\nLiam stopped crying, and Rick explained that Liam had just needed a \"man's touch.\" He continued that Liam probably missed his father. Marty lied that Rick should go, because Liam's father would return soon. Noticing the mess in the room, Rick hoped that the father hadn't been the one to tear the room up. If that was the case, Marty shouldn't want the man to return, in his opinion. He wondered what had happened.\n\n\nMarty explained that she had misplaced something, and had torn up the room, looking for it. She thanked Rick for helping her, and for being a nice guy. He said he'd stay nice as long as Liam stayed quiet, because Rick had work to do. He gave Marty his card, and instructed her to call if she ever needed a job. He left, and Marty thought that it had been a close call.\n\n\nMarty was upset that Rick had gotten a good look at her and Liam. She got all of her stuff together, picked up Liam, and left the room. Outside of the room, Wes walked past. \"Marty?\" he called out to a shocked Marty.\n\n\nViki hid the remote control to the television in a drawer in Natalie's room. Natalie woke up, and Viki asked how she was feeling. Natalie was in disbelief that she couldn't remember \"something that hurt so much.\" Viki hoped that Natalie wouldn't remember that, or anything that Marty had put Natalie through. Natalie didn't want to talk about Marty, so she expressed her happiness that Liam was safe. Natalie wanted to see her son, but Viki didn't think it was a good idea.\n\n\nNatalie told Viki that she needed to hold her son. Viki told her daughter that it wasn't an option, as Clint was wheeled into the room. Viki wondered if it was all right for him to be out of bed, but he replied that no one could \"keep us down.\" Viki and Clint exchanged a look, which Natalie noticed. Natalie realized that there was something that Viki and Clint weren't telling her. As Natalie prodded more, Viki told her that Natalie and Clint needed to rest. A nurse entered and said she needed a few minutes alone with Natalie, so Viki and Clint left.\n\n\nOutside the room, Viki couldn't believe that she had agreed to lie to Natalie for Brody about Liam, and for Clint about his condition. She related that she was a terrible liar.\n\n\nAs the nurse went about her business, Natalie asked if the nurse knew whether or not the police had found Marty. The nurse didn't know, so Natalie asked for the television remote. There was a news report on the television about Marty kidnapping Liam, and that Marty should be considered \"armed and dangerous.\" Natalie yelled for Viki.\n\n\nViki and Clint returned to the room, and Natalie frantically told Viki and Clint what she had seen on the news. The nurse apologized and left the room. Viki promised Natalie that Brody and John were out looking for Liam, and would find him soon. Clint added that the entire police department was out looking for Liam. Viki also promised that Marty wouldn't hurt Liam, because Marty was a mother as well.\n\n\nNatalie had known something was wrong. Viki said she had needed to lie to Natalie because Natalie had needed rest. Natalie didn't care what happened to her. She just wanted Liam. Viki told Natalie to have faith, and to trust John and Brody.\n\n\nMatthew and Destiny walked through Angel Square, and wondered whether or not Marty had been caught. They agreed they were lucky that Marty hadn't used her gun on them, and that Brody was all right after the hit on the head. Destiny was glad that Matthew had been with her during the \"crazy night,\" because she didn't think she could have handled it on her own. She was also glad he thought that their night together meant something to him. \"Because it did,\" he said, and kissed her.\n\n\nAs Destiny and Matthew shared a kiss, Dani passed through. She was shocked to see the two kissing, and hid behind a statue. Matthew pulled away and said that he needed to get home. They agreed to meet the next day, and he left.\n\n\nBo summarized for Nora what had happened with Natalie and Liam. He confided that everyone had agreed not to say anything to Natalie about Liam. There was a knock on the door, and Nora answered it to Blanca. Blanca wanted to give Bo and Nora a heads-up on one of her upcoming stories. She revealed that her next story involved the cold investigation on Eddie Ford's murder. She believed that Bo and Nora were covering for the real murderer -- Matthew.\n\n\nBo and Nora didn't know where Blanca had gotten the information, but they threatened to sue her for defamation if she made the report. Blanca informed them that journalism school had taught her that, if something is true, \"it's sure as hell not defamation.\" She left a worried Bo and Nora.\n\n\nMatthew entered the apartment and wondered why he had seen Blanca Morales. Bo and Nora confided that Blanca wanted to say on her show that Matthew had killed Eddie. They assured Matthew that Blanca had been threatened with lawsuits, so she would be stupid to go along with her plan. Bo and Nora tried to figure out how Blanca had considered Matthew as Eddie's killer. Bo banked on Clint, but Matthew admitted that it must have been Destiny.\n\n\nBo and Nora were surprised that Matthew had told Destiny. Matthew feared that Blanca wouldn't be afraid of the lawsuit threats. Bo stated that Blanca would need evidence in order to report on something so important, but she had no evidence. Matthew said he'd rather be in jail than have the entire town talk about him. He realized that he couldn't keep having his parents cover for him, because they could lose their jobs. Matthew decided that he needed to confess. He didn't want to wait for someone else to figure it out. He related that the secret was like \"a ton of bricks.\" He wanted to turn himself in.\n\n\nDani walked up to Destiny and asked about the kiss Dani had just witnessed. Dani was surprised because she hadn't known that Matthew and Destiny were dating. Destiny denied it as Dani prodded more. Finally, Destiny blurted out to a stunned Dani that Destiny and Matthew had had sex. Dani wanted to know how it had happened, since Destiny and Matthew were apparently only friends. Destiny didn't want to talk about it, especially since Dani had previously dated Matthew. Dani reasoned that it was a long time before, and she had a boyfriend, \"even if I want to throw something at his head.\"\n\n\nDestiny was curious, so Dani explained about Deanna staying with Nate. However, Dani still wanted to hear Destiny's story. Destiny explained that Matthew had been upset, and dealing with things on his own. He had wanted someone to understand him, and someone to help him make everything go away. However, Destiny said it hadn't worked.\n\n\nBlanca appeared and called Destiny her \"number-one girl.\" However, Destiny said that she wasn't Blanca's friend. Blanca explained to Dani that her audience would know who had killed Eddie thanks to Destiny. Dani was curious, so Blanca told her that the killer was Matthew. Destiny yelled that Blanca couldn't say that on television because it wasn't true. Blanca's phone rang, and she walked away to answer it.\n\n\nDestiny related that a person couldn't say whatever they wanted on television, just because it would make a good story. Dani assured Destiny that no one would believe the story, anyway, because it was a lie. \"Isn't it?\" Dani asked as a result of Destiny's silence. Dani babbled on that it couldn't be the reason that Destiny and Matthew had gotten together. However, Destiny's silence told Dani that it was.\n\n\nBlanca answered her phone to Clint. He believed that she owed him for giving her so much material to report on, so he wanted a favor. He wanted her to help get his daughter's baby back.\n\n\nA short while later, Blanca was setting up her equipment in Natalie's hospital room. Viki wasn't sure about enlisting Blanca's help, but Clint insisted that it would help get Liam back. Clint and Viki made sure that Natalie was all right with Blanca's help. Natalie said that she'd do anything to get Liam back.\n\n\nOn the air, Blanca summarized Natalie's story for the viewers. She continued the segment, and showed a picture of Marty.\n\n\nAt the Minute Man, Rick sat in bed and turned on Blanca's show on television. He was stunned to see that he recognized the kidnapper, and that Clint was offering one million dollars for any information about Marty.\n\n\n",
