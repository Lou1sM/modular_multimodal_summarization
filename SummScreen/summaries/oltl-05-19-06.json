Back inside, Tess finally seemed to feel for the Buchanans, and she shared her fears and concerns with Nash as they sat on the steps in the foyer. Nash wanted to know what had happened to her, and Tess said that seeing Duke die so young made her scared that she would lose everything she loved. Nash assured her that it would not happen.\n\n\nIn the living room, Kevin fell apart in front of Viki. She sensed that her son was blaming himself for Duke's death, which was what she had been afraid of from the moment Spencer had forced him to choose between his son and the love of his life. Viki pleaded with Kevin not to torment himself in that way, and she reassured him that all parents fought with their children. Kevin couldn't see past the fact that he had hated his son too much to forgive him for sleeping with Kelly. He told Viki that Duke had apologized to him before he had died, and Kevin also shared his shock over the box of mementos that Adriana had shown him. Viki told Kevin that those mementos were proof of how much Duke had loved his father.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Bo and Clint lent each other comfort as they prepared to tell a sick and weakened Asa that his great-grandson was dead. The brothers agreed that Asa had to learn the truth from them, but after a brief visit to his bedside, neither was able to tell him the devastating news. Clint and Bo returned to the Buchanan mansion, where they joined Viki at Kevin's side, trying to comfort him in his grief. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Nash told Tess that there was a way she could help her brother, and they went to retrieve baby Brennan from her sleep. Tess entered the living room to offer Kevin a chance to hold his niece, warming everyone's heart in the process. Kevin smiled down at the baby, who didn't cry or make any noise; he recalled that Duke had behaved similarly as an infant. After handing Brennan back to Tess, Kevin announced that it was time to bury his son.\n\n\nBlair visited Kelly in the hospital, doing her best to cheer up her cousin. Kelly's depression in the wake of the tragedy had deepened, and Blair became scared when Kelly said that she made herself sick. Spencer joined the Cramer cousins and told Kelly that Jack had been asking about her that morning. Blair offered to visit with the kids, but Kelly said that Blair should keep them away from Kelly if she wanted them to be safe. \n\n\nBlair reminded Kelly that Kevin had broken her heart, but Kelly realized the extent of her actions, and she told her cousin that she had betrayed Kevin in the worst possible way. Outside Kelly's room, Blair expressed her concerns to Spencer. Spencer made the mistake of telling Blair that everything would go back to normal once Todd was executed, and Blair snapped at him, telling her boyfriend that it wouldn't be that easy.\n\n\nAcross town, Todd and Evangeline put their heads together in the hopes of finding one small clue that would get Todd a stay of execution. Evangeline mentioned the night that Todd had met Margaret at the lake, asking him if Spencer could have followed them there. Todd was adamant that Spencer hadn't even known Margaret and couldn't have been at the lake. \n\n\nEvangeline reminded Todd that Margaret had to have swum to shore once she jumped overboard, and suddenly she remembered that Spencer had been the one who had signed off on the autopsy as a second opinion. She and Todd wondered if Spencer might have lied about the cause of death, pretending to go along with the original doctor's diagnosis of strangulation. Evangeline decided that she would approach the district attorney in the hopes of exhuming both Margaret's and the baby's bodies. \n\n\nIn Thailand, Natalie showed David's picture to the same caf\u00e9 waiter who had led David to Margaret. The waiter lied to Natalie, telling her that he had never seen David. At the same time, John busted into David's room and started beating him up. John said he knew David had killed his father, but David denied any wrongdoing, which made John angrier, and he pointed his gun at David. \n\n\nDuring the confrontation between David and John, a frantic Margaret sneaked out the window of the adjoining room into the rainy night, while Denton popped out of the shadows to shoot David. John shot Denton and then demanded to know what he wanted with David. David said that he would explain if John would just put down his weapon. John finally did so, and David stammered that he knew something that would change everybody's life forever: Margaret Cochran was still alive, and that that was why Spencer had hired Denton to kill David. John was hesitant to believe it, but David forged on with the truth. \n\n\nA soaking-wet Margaret popped into the caf\u00e9, where a shocked Natalie laid eyes on her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Margaret and David are packing to get the hell out of Dodge! David goes to the door and he sees John in the hall. John pounces on him and Margaret hears the fighting wondering what the hell is going on. She decides that she has to get out of there, She hears her name mentioned and so she rushes to the window which is the only way out and she climbs out into the pouring rain. Natalie is sitting at a table waiting for John to arrive. She hears someone behind her. She sees the woman soaking wet coming to a table nearby. \"Oh my God!\" Natalie says quietly. \"Is that Margaret Cochrane?\" John holds a gun to David's face to get him to pony up to the crimes that he has committed. He feels that he has gotten the man who helped kill his father. David has no idea what he is talking about. BANG! John's gun goes off. He has shot Denton who was behind David, ready to kill him with a gun of his own. \"Why was he trying to do that?\" John asks. David goes into the room and finds Margaret gone. \"I have information that you want to know,\" David confides. \"Denton was coming her to shut me up!\" He tells how Margaret is alive and living in Bangkok. How Spencer is responsible for this and that Todd hasn't killed anyone.\" Kevin relives the day he found his wife and son injured but clearly in the process of cheating. He blames himself for Duke's death. Tess brings her baby to Kevin and that does make him feel better. \"Love her and cherish her everyday,\" Kevin tells Tess. Clint and Bo went to tell Asa that Duke had died, but once they got a look at him, they decided that they couldn't do it. They have to take care of the family now, as their father isn't a rock anymore. Kevin is ready. \"Let's go bury my son,\" he says walking out confidently. Todd is with Evangeline and they decide to go everything. The first confusing thing is that Margaret can swim but she told Todd that she couldn't. They figure that when she fell into the water, that was all an act. \"I got it!\" Evangeline says. \"Spencer did the opinion autopsy. Remember, you didn't want him to do it. What if he paid off the Medical Examiner to falsify the results? What if Margaret really didn't die the way that we were told she did?\" Evangeline plans next to get the body exhumed right away!\"",
