Blair clung to the hope that John would rescue them. T\u00e9a observed that she and Blair had a lot in common. T\u00e9a went as far as to suggest that she and Blair might have been friends had circumstances been different. Blair scoffed at the idea. Blair insisted that she hated T\u00e9a. \n\n\nT\u00e9a wondered why Blair would waste her dying breath insulting T\u00e9a. Blair recalled how T\u00e9a had married Todd and then had helped him to gain full custody of Starr. T\u00e9a didn't apologize for what she had done. T\u00e9a wondered if Blair had another reason for hating her. \n\n\nBlair considered losing custody of Starr more than sufficient reason to dislike T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a countered that the kids were always Blair's default excuse. T\u00e9a suspected that the primary reason that Blair hated T\u00e9a was because Blair resented T\u00e9a's relationship with Todd. Blair laughed at the suggestion that she was jealous. Blair insisted that she was with John. \n\n\nT\u00e9a pointed out that John had married Blair, so that Blair could retain custody of the children. Blair couldn't dispute the obvious, but she did remind T\u00e9a that John and Blair had been in a romantic relationship before their marriage. T\u00e9a was certain that Blair's feelings for Todd were far stronger than her feelings for John. Blair turned the tables on T\u00e9a; she accused T\u00e9a of being in love with Todd. \n\n\nT\u00e9a freely admitted that Todd was the love of her life. T\u00e9a's forthrightness inspired Blair to acknowledge that Todd was the love of her life, too. T\u00e9a seemed to appreciate Blair's honesty; she dropped her head on Blair's shoulder and smiled. T\u00e9a remained worried that they would perish in the boiler room, so she decided to share a secret with Blair. T\u00e9a warned Blair that it was something that T\u00e9a had not told anyone. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, John questioned Jack. Jack was rattled, so his memories were hazy. John remained patient while Starr offered Jack support. When Jack recalled that he had seen envelopes, containing invitations, John realized the significance of the date. John suspected that Powell had attempted to recreate the night of Marty's rape. Cole didn't understand how Blair and T\u00e9a figured into Powell's plans. John decided to check his hunch out by going to the old KAD fraternity house. John left Cole in charge of Jack and Starr until Fish arrived at Todd's house. \n\n\nLater, Jack and Cole were playing a video game when Starr brought them a snack. Jack apologized to Starr for lying to her on the telephone when their parents had been in trouble. Starr and Cole assured Jack that what he had done had been heroic. Jack decided to get some more cookies to nibble on. Before he left the room, Jack pulled Starr aside to tell her that he loved her. Starr smiled as she told Jack that she loved him, too. After Jack left, Cole approached Starr then embraced her. \n\n\nJohn called the police station when he reached the old KAD fraternity house. He asked to speak to Fish, then Bo, but was told that both men were unavailable. John's frustration mounted as he entered the fraternity house. John's focus was on the phone call, so he didn't hear Rebecca's approach. Rebecca managed to hit John in the back of the head with a heavy object. John dropped the phone as he fell to the ground. \n\n\nRebecca decided to neutralize John by injecting him with an unknown substance. John regained consciousness in time to stop Rebecca from stabbing him with the syringe. They struggled briefly before John gained the upper hand. He was forced to inject Rebecca with the syringe. \n\n\nIn the bedroom, Powell held Chloe in his arms. Powell took delight in tormenting Todd with the baby. Todd begged Powell not to hurt Jessica's daughter. Powell hinted that the baby wasn't Jessica's. He spent several minutes inviting Todd and Marty to guess who the baby's parents were. Todd and Marty were confused by the question. \n\n\nEventually, Powell tired of the game; he revealed that the baby he held wasn't Viki's, but Todd's granddaughter. Marty and Todd stared at Powell with disbelief. Powell insisted it was the truth; he speculated that Jessica, or one of alter egos, had switched babies when something had gone wrong during the birth. Marty reminded Todd that Chloe and Hope had been born on the same day. \n\n\nPowell wondered if the baby had inherited the same gene that had made many of the Lords \"crazy.\" Todd worried that Powell intended to harm Chloe. He asked what Powell wanted from him. Powell revealed that he wanted Todd to redeem himself by returning the child to her mother. Todd thought that Powell meant to release him, but it was all part of Powell's game. Powell refused to free Todd. \n\n\nPowell said that the night of the Spring Fling, Todd had been the one with all of the power, not Powell. Powell relished that he was finally in charge. Todd decided to tell Powell what he wanted to hear. He agreed that Powell had all of the power. Todd begged Powell not to use Blair, T\u00e9a, Marty, and Chloe to punish Todd. Powell began rambling about redemption and how no one could be saved. \n\n\nMarty disagreed with Powell. She credited Powell with saving her. Marty claimed that all of her memories had returned because Powell had brought her to the scene of her rape. She thanked Powell for giving her back her life. Powell apologized to Marty for all he had done to her. \n\n\nPowell asked Marty how he could make amends. Marty pleaded with Powell to give her the baby. Powell slowly handed Chloe to Marty. Marty hugged the child to her then turned to look at Todd. Todd mouthed a thank you to Marty, which Powell saw. \n\n\nPowell was enraged when he saw the relief on Todd's face. Powell stalked over to the bed with a knife. As Powell lunged the knife at Todd, a shot rang out. Marty watched as Powell collapsed on top of Todd. When Marty turned her head to the doorway, John stood inside the room, his smoking gun still aimed in Powell's direction. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica entered the nursery. She screamed when she noticed that Chloe's crib was empty. \n\n\nDownstairs, Natalie and Jared confronted Brody. They demanded that Brody leave their home, but Brody refused to budge. Their argument was cut short when they heard Jessica scream. A frantic search of the house for Chloe turned up nothing. Viki and Charlie decided to call 9-1-1. \n\n\nA short time later, Bo arrived at the house. Bo quickly issued an Amber Alert and reassured Jessica that he had his entire force searching for Chloe. Jessica was distraught by her daughter's disappearance. Bo asked Jessica if there was any reason to suspect someone of deliberately taking Chloe. No one noticed the long look that Natalie and Jared exchanged. Meanwhile, Jessica insisted that she had no idea who had taken her baby. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared remained downstairs while everyone returned to the nursery, hoping to spot a clue. Natalie worried that Kyle had taken Chloe. Later, when everyone gathered in the library, Jessica remained visibly shaken. Natalie stepped forward to admit that she might have information about Chloe's disappearance. Jessica was stunned that Natalie hadn't spoken up sooner. Jessica demanded to know what information Natalie had. \n\n\nNatalie was hesitant to say anything more; she claimed it was complicated. It didn't matter to Jessica; she just wanted her child found. Natalie told everyone that Kyle Lewis had asked quite a few questions about Chloe. Natalie was spared from explaining further when Bo's cell phone rang. \n\n\nAll conversation halted while Bo took the call. Afterwards, Bo revealed that Kyle had been arrested at Todd's house. Bo added that no mention of a baby had been made. Jessica decided that she wanted to talk to Kyle herself. Brody offered to drive Jessica. \n\n\nAfter Jessica, Brody, and Bo left, Natalie asked Viki to wait. Natalie admitted that she had something to say about Chloe. Natalie explained that she hadn't been able to tell the truth while Jessica had been in the room. \n\n\nClint demanded to know what Natalie had to say. Natalie confessed that Kyle had been blackmailing her and Jared; Kyle had proof that Chloe was not Jessica's daughter. \n\n\nIn the car, Brody tried to reassure Jessica. Jessica was haunted by memories of her daughter's birth and Bess's determination to solve Jessica's problems.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John finds Starr, Cole and Jack alone in Todd's home. Jack informs him that Powell and Rebecca were there and kidnapped his parents and Tea. He also recalls the invitation they all got to the \"spring fling\" at the Frat house. At that point, John recalls that he saw the same invitation. So he goes and fins the frat house. Meanwhile, Rebecca takes baby Chloe out of her crib at Llanfair. And Powell takes her to \"meet\" Todd and Marty. Jessica is hysterical when she finds out her baby is missing. And at that point, Natalie and Jared suspect Kyle Lewis and don't know what to do in order to get Chloe back and in regard to the fact that they know that she is really Starr's baby Hope and that Kyle knows that also. While Powell has both Todd and Marty held captive, he informs them that this baby is not Jessica's, like they assume. She's their mutual grandchild. They don't believe it. But he tells them he can prove it because he keeps up with all the info about both of their lives and their respective kids, how Cole got Starr pregnant and the mysterious unexplained death of their baby. Downstairs, Blair and Tea attempt to save their lives and argue. But they both admit that they have one thing in common in that they are both in love with Todd. Cole and Starr have some sort of unconscious premonition that things will never be the same after they find out the answers about their baby's death. And they seem happy as if they know that they will find out what they really want.",
