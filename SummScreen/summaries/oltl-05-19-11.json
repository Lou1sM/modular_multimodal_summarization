He became upset as Destiny pleaded with Dani not to tell anyone, especially Nate. Dani couldn't promise not to tell anyone, so Destiny threatened her. Destiny said that she would deny telling Dani anything, and would say that Dani was just jealous of Destiny and Matthew's relationship.\n\n\nDestiny and Dani agreed that there was no telling what Nate would do when he found out about Matthew. Dani offered to talk to T\u00e9a for Matthew, but Destiny once again begged Dani not to tell anyone. Destiny believed that Nate would kill Matthew if Nate found out. Dani wondered when Matthew had become a killer. Destiny explained that it had just happened, and that no one missed Eddie anyway. Matthew had done the world a favor.\n\n\nDani reminded Destiny that Nate had almost gone to jail for Eddie's murder. Destiny confessed that Clint had made Matthew keep quiet. Destiny revealed that she'd figured out what had happened because she could tell that something was wrong with Matthew. She'd kept after him about it, so he'd told her. Dani realized that it didn't matter if she told anyone, because Blanca would broadcast it anyway.\n\n\nMatthew told his parents that he was going to turn himself in. Bo and Nora begged Matthew to trust them, and to not do anything until they figured out the best way to deal with things. Matthew thought it was his decision, but Bo refused to let his son do anything. Nora blamed it on Clint. Matthew suggested that his sentence would be lighter because he was a minor, but Bo reminded him that he could still be charged as an adult.\n\n\nNora informed Matthew that he could still get life in prison. \"Cole's dealing with it,\" Matthew yelled. However, Nora told him that the two situations were completely different. Matthew said that, once Blanca said something on the air, things would be over anyway. Bo and Nora vowed to stop her. Bo made a call and found out that Blanca was at the hospital.\n\n\nMatthew thought that Bo and Nora would just make things worse, but they promised to get Blanca to back down. Matthew said he could call John and confess. He wanted to protect Bo and Nora from losing their jobs, and possibly going to jail for helping Matthew cover up the crime. Matthew told them to do their jobs and take him to the station, but Bo refused to lose another son. Matthew finally agreed. Bo ordered Matthew not to open the door or answer the phone for anyone, and Bo and Nora left.\n\n\nA short while later, there was a pounding on the door. Matthew answered it to Nate, who immediately punched Matthew in the face. Matthew fell back and hit his head on a table. \"You killed my father, you son of a bitch,\" Nate spat at Matthew. Backing up, Matthew asked who had told Nate. Nate demanded that Matthew be a man and admit what he'd done. Matthew finally admitted it, and explained everything that had happened that night.\n\n\nNate yelled at Matthew for keeping quiet while Nate had been charged with the murder. Clearly in pain, Matthew told Nate that Clint had forced Matthew to keep quiet. Nate accused Matthew of being a \"spoiled rich kid\" who couldn't get over Dani dumping him. Nate informed Matthew that Dani never would have \"crawled back\" to Matthew had Nate gone to jail.\n\n\nMatthew asked what Nate was going to do. Nate wasn't going to do anything, but ordered Matthew to turn himself in. If Matthew didn't, Nate promised to go to the cops himself. Nate left and slammed the door behind him.\n\n\nMarty was distraught about Rick \"getting a good look\" at her and Liam, as she frantically gathered her things. She picked up Liam, and walked out the door. Outside of the room, Wes walked past and recognized Marty. Not realizing Wes wasn't Jessica, Marty grabbed her gun. Wes reintroduced himself to a confused Marty. Marty finally realized that it wasn't Jessica, so she covered and said that Wes had changed.\n\n\nIn his room, Rick scrambled to get his clothes on after seeing the report about Marty. Finally dressed, he left his room, and spotted Marty outside. He snapped a picture with his cell phone. \"There's my million bucks right there,\" he said smiling. \"Feature films, here I come!\" Rick called the hotline from the television. He refused to give any information without getting the money first. After the person on the other end refused, he decided that he would tell the family himself, and left the room.\n\n\nMarty claimed that people around were \"nosy,\" so she suggested that she and Wes talk in her room. Noticing the mess, Wes asked what had happened. Marty said she had lost something and had tried to look for it. Wes wondered if Liam was Marty's son, which Marty confirmed. Wes made sure that the baby wasn't his, \"because we were more than roommates.\" He held the baby, and asked if the father was in the picture. Marty replied that Liam would help Marty get back together with Liam's father.\n\n\nMarty was glad that she had run into Wes, but needed to run an errand. She needed to find her lost possession. Wes thought that Marty wouldn't be able to find anything in the dark, so he suggested that they watch television. He turned on the television to see a report about Marty and Liam on the news. Marty swore to Wes that \"it's not how it sounds.\"\n\n\nMarty wanted to explain things to him, but didn't want to lose him as a friend. He promised not to leave her. Before telling him anything, Marty made him promise to let her keep Liam. Suddenly, Wes had a flashback to Natalie and John's failed wedding, when Marty had needed to tell Jessica something. Marty asked Wes what was wrong.\n\n\nBlanca finished up her segment with Clint, Viki, and Natalie. They thanked Blanca, and a nurse arrived to take Clint back to his room. Clint promised Natalie that he would get Liam back \"if it's the last thing I do.\" Clint looked very tired as he got in his wheelchair. As he was wheeled away, Blanca followed after him.\n\n\nJohn summarized all of Marty's crimes to his officers. One of the officers asked about the reward, but John hadn't heard about a reward. He dismissed the officers, and told Brody that he'd talk to Clint about the reward. Brody wanted to check on Natalie, so John said he'd meet Brody there.\n\n\nClint was wheeled around the corner, where John stood. John asked him about the reward. When Clint confirmed that he'd offered a reward, John informed Clint that it would attract people more interested in the money than in Liam. John asked Clint to let the police know about a reward if there was a next time. Clint agreed, as long as John didn't let his \"psychopathic ex-girlfriends\" hurt Clint's family.\n\n\nClint said that John was responsible for half of the crime in Llanview, but John countered that Clint was responsible for the other half. John left to join the search for Liam as Clint went into his room. Clint got into bed, and the nurse warned him to ease up on the stress. Blanca entered the room, and Clint demanded that the nurse get the \"vulture\" out. She thought that Clint would want to hear what she had to say, because it had to do with his family.\n\n\nBlanca wanted a comment about Eddie's murder, but Clint reminded her that the charges against him had been dropped. Blanca mentioned that there were going to be murder charges filed against Matthew. Clint said it was impossible. Blanca suggested that Bo and Nora had been covering the crime up. He threatened to \"run you into the ground\" if she continued with the story. As she turned to leave, he stopped her.\n\n\nA short while later, Bo and Nora arrived in front of Clint's room. A guard outside wouldn't let them in to see Blanca, because she was on the air, about to identify Eddie's killer. Worried, Bo and Nora got into the room anyway. They were just in time to hear Clint admit to Eddie's murder on the air.\n\n\nNatalie was worried about her father, but Viki informed her daughter that Clint was worried about Natalie as well. Brody arrived, and Natalie was distraught that there was no news about Liam. Viki knew that, since Marty was a mother as well, she wouldn't hurt Liam. Natalie wanted to leave, but Viki wouldn't let Natalie leave until the doctors said she could.\n\n\nBrody told her that many people were looking, but she noticed that he looked distressed. She demanded that he tell her what was on his mind. Brody admitted that he and John had found Dr. Buhari dead in her office. Marty had been the last appointment, so it was assumed that Marty had killed the doctor. Brody tried to reason why Marty would kill the doctor, but Natalie thought she knew why.\n\n\nNatalie mentioned the tape from Marty's session that Natalie had gotten a hold of. She had gotten it to find out why Marty had been saying that she had broken John and Natalie up. She'd been about to listen to the tape, but she had run into Brody. She thought back to the kiss they had shared, and said that seeing Brody was the last thing she remembered. She had no idea what had happened to the tape.\n\n\nViki reminded Natalie that she had left John an urgent message, and then gone to John's with Liam. She had found Marty on the roof and, somewhere in between, lost the tape. Natalie assumed she had listened to the tape, because it was probably why she had wanted to see John.\n\n\nRick entered the hospital and saw John. He asked if John was with the Buchanan family, and mentioned that he knew where Liam was. Rick wanted his money first, but John informed Rick that trying to scam the family would result in a felony. Rick joked about John being a cop, so John flashed his badge. \"I've seen more convincing hardware on strippers,\" Rick said.\n\n\nJohn showed Rick his gun, so Rick instantly believed him. Rick said that he had the picture to prove that he wasn't lying. He showed the picture of Marty on his cell phone to John. John wondered when the picture had been taken. When Rick refused to tell John, John pushed him against the wall. He demanded an answer, and threatened to send Rick to Statesville.\n\n\nA short while later, John entered Natalie's room. He said that he knew where Liam was. Brody promised to get Liam home, and left with John. Later, Natalie worried about why John and Brody hadn't yet called with news. Viki reassured her daughter, and once again said that Marty wouldn't hurt Liam. Viki promised that Liam would be back soon.\n\n\nJohn, Brody, and two other officers stood in front of Marty's room at the Minute Man. With guns drawn, they kicked down the door, and burst into the room.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew tells his parents that he is not going to let them risk their careers in order to let him escape the consequences of the fact that he killed Eddie Ford and that he intends to turn himself in. But Bo and Nora are determined not to let Blanca Morales \"smear\" their son although it is correct that he did shoot Eddie. Blanca goes to Clint's room where he announces on television that he will reward anybody who can find Marty Saybrooke his grandson, Liam, with a million dollars. Immediately, as soon as the guy who stays at The Minuteman Motel to produce porn films sees that, he recalls that Marty and the baby are staying next door to him and he's ready to cash in. Blanca reveals to Clint she knows that Matthew killed Eddie. He then knows he better do something about that. Destiny urges Dani not to give Matthew up for murder nor tell Nate, knowing he will kill Matthew for killing Nate's father and letting Nate confess when Nate could have gone to prison for life. Nate overhears their conversation and immediately goes to confront Matthew while he's alone in his parents' home. Nate knocks Matthew to the floor. When Matthew explains what happened when Eddie provoked him to shoot him, Nate concludes that Matthew better turn himself in or he will do it for him. Since Matthew intended to do that anyway, it appears not to be a problem for him. But Matthew appears to have suffered a blow to the head after Nate decked him. Bo and Nora rush to find Blanca right when Clint is going to announce on the news what he knows about the murder of Eddie Ford. And we hear Clint go on the record announcing that he (himself) has done it. While Marty is with the baby at The Minuteman, she runs into \"Wes\", who is in Jessica's body but assuming the identity of Brody's friend Wes Granger whom Marty stayed with. John and Brody go to find Marty after the film producer neighbor has identified her and tipped them off. But it appears it's too late and she and \"Wes\" have already left the motel room.",
