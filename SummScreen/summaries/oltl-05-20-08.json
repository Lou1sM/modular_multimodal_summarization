Shane told Brody that Rex had seen him the night before, while Rex simply stared at the \"family reunion.\" Gigi managed to ask Brody how his \"return from the dead\" was possible. Brody began to explain his story to the crowd, and said they'd missed so much time. \"It doesn't matter,\" Gigi said as she stared back at Rex at the altar. \"Not anymore.\" \n\n\nShane was ecstatic about his \"father's\" miraculous return, and chatted up a storm with Brody as Dorian watched from afar, fuming. Shane was overjoyed that kids wouldn't call him \"a bastard\" anymore, and Brody added, \"or get away with it.\" When Langston asked why Dorian was so angry, Dorian lied and said she wouldn't allow Brody and his \"girlfriend\" to make a mockery of her daughter's wedding. Back at the altar, Adriana explained who Brody was, and was irked when Rex stepped off the altar to go send the Morascos away himself. Rex hurriedly cornered Gigi, and in hushed tones asked what else she'd had to tell him. Gigi wouldn't answer, and Adriana stalked up to announce to all that the Lovett/Morasco family had a lot to catch up on. \"Don't let us keep you,\" she said. As the trio turned to leave, Rex called after Gigi, but Gigi didn't respond. Finally, the dazed Rex took Adriana's arm and headed back up the aisle. He exchanged a single glance with Gigi before she walked out of the church once and for all. As the Morascos returned to the cottage as a family and Shane bonded with Brody, back at the church, Rex and Adriana began to exchange their vows. As they were pronounced man and wife and kissed, to the cheers of Roxy and the horror of Dorian, Gigi found herself alone in her living room at the very same time, clutching Rex's old football jersey and crying. \n\n\nAt the hospital in Virginia, Blair was stunned to learn that Starr was three months pregnant. Starr began to cry and told Blair she was sorry. As soon as the doctor exited, Blair struggled to comfort Starr. Starr recounted the whole story for her mother from the beginning. Blair blamed herself, and said she should've known. She asked why Starr hadn't come to her instead of running away, and Starr said she'd been \"scared of Dad.\" She said she knew that when Todd found out, he would kill Cole. \n\n\nIn Cole's hospital room, John confronted Cole about the pregnancy, and stopped the teen from rushing out of bed to Starr's aid. John assured Cole that Todd didn't know, and promised he would go check on Starr. On his way to Starr's room, John ran into Todd rifling through Starr's medical documentation. He snatched the file away from Todd before Todd could learn the reason behind Starr's sonogram, and handed it off to a nurse. John warned Todd to stay out of Blair and the kids' way from that point on, then entered Starr's room alone. \n\n\nOnce John arrived in Starr's room, he and Blair realized that they both knew about the baby, and they each confirmed for each other that both Cole and the unborn child were fine. Starr asked John to tell Cole she loved him, and John left to return to Cole's side. \n\n\nOn his way back to Cole's room, John faced Todd again. Refusing to accept any responsibility for his actions, Todd placed all blame for Starr's accident and flight from home on Cole. John told Todd that Cole was already more of a man than Todd could ever be, and that nothing Todd could ever do would stop Cole from loving Starr. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, at the Buchanan mansion, Jared struggled to figure out what to do about the unconscious and half-naked David Vickers lying in the middle of the drawing room. Nigel entered and was aghast at the scene, warning Jared that Clint and Nora would be home from Virginia at any moment. He urged Jared to move David as quickly as possible. In the foyer, Clint and Nora returned moments later, with Nora fretting about being unable to see Cole at the hospital. Clint reassured her that Cole would be fine, and as they moved to enter the drawing room they found the doors barricaded by Nigel, who feebly claimed he was \"tidying up.\" Annoyed by Nigel's excuses, Clint and Nora burst in, only to find an empty room. Little did they know David was hidden just behind the couch! Jared assured the unsuspecting couple that Vickers was gone, but claimed he'd broken a decanter and that shattered glass had been spilled everywhere, necessitating the clean-up. Clint and Nora headed for the liquor themselves, thrilled to hear that David was once again gone, but as Nora sat down on the couch, Jared was mortified to see David's hand slowly creep up onto the cushion over her shoulder! He hustled Nora off the couch and David lapsed back into unconsciousness, his hand falling from the couch. As David groaned to himself, Jared and Nigel made a pathetic attempt to cover his groans with their own bodily noises, clearing their throats and coughing rapidly. Clint and Nora were curious about the strange noise, but Jared and Nigel insisted they go for a walk while the duo cleaned the rest of the drawing room. Before Nora could challenge them on it, her phone rang with a call from John, and Clint and Nora rushed off to answer it, leaving the conspirators alone as David began to wake up. Jared and Nigel gagged David and scrambled to drag him out of public view, when Natalie suddenly walked in, home early from the wedding, catching them in the act! \n\n\nIn Virginia Beach, John returned to Cole's hospital room, reassuring him that Starr and the baby were fine. John told Cole he wouldn't lecture him, but blamed himself for letting Marty down on his promise to watch over her son. Cole disagreed, saying he thought Marty would be happy for him. Cole felt that the baby was a chance to rebuild his family, with his son or daughter having parts of both of his parents. \"You can't beat that,\" he said.\n\n\nIn Starr's room, Starr admitted to Blair that she'd considered abortion, and related the tale of her near-miss at the clinic, with Cole talking her out of it. Blair realized that Starr turned to her friends for aid because she'd thought Blair had chosen Todd's side over Starr's. Blair swore that she would never again leave her daughter's side, just in time for an inappropriately cheery and manic Todd to walk in, calling himself \"Dr. Manning.\" Blair ordered him to get out and warned Todd that he'd hurt their daughter for the last time. Todd tried to explain away his behavior, blaming John and Cole, but Blair said he had taken away Starr's life and dignity all because of his hatred for Cole, because when he looked at the boy, he thought of his crimes against Marty. Blair told Todd that like Marty, Starr had become another of his victims. She concluded by saying that Starr knew more about love than either of her parents and again told him to get out. Todd sulked off, but stopped to ask Starr, \"You forgive me, right?\" As Todd left, Starr said, \"No, and I never will.\" The nurse returned with Starr's sonogram picture of the baby, and Blair told her daughter that she'd be there for her from then on. \n\n\nAt the wedding reception for Rex and Adriana at Ultra Violet, the guests mingled. Antonio and Talia played a \"scene\" together, pretending to hate each other while secretly planning another rendezvous, only to be interrupted by an angry Carlotta. Bo and Lindsay reminisced about their own failed wedding, and Lindsay asked if Bo ever thought of \"what might have been.\" Bo said there was no need to focus on the past, when they had so much to look forward to. Markko and Langston missed Starr and Cole. Layla gloated to the miserable Dorian about Rex and Adriana's happiness, while Dorian continued to seethe about Brody and Gigi. Finally, \"Mr. and Mrs. Balsom\" entered for the first time, only to be pelted with wet, cooked rice by Roxy. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, at the Buchanan mansion, Jared, Natalie, and Nigel had found a temporary solution to the David Vickers problem: Hog-tying him in the barn. Jared and Nigel lashed David to a chair as Natalie, still in her formal gown, held a pitchfork on him. David threatened to expose their secret, but Natalie re-gagged him. After Nigel left, Jared called Natalie \"one of the hottest bridesmaids ever to grace a barn.\" \"You're not so bad yourself,\" Natalie quipped, and the forbidden lovers fell into a passionate kiss as David averted his scandalized eyes. \n\n\nAt the cottage, Brody and Shane looked through photos of Shane growing up; Brody didn't let on when Shane discovered that Gigi's photo of herself with Brody had gone missing. Before Gigi sent him off to bed, Shane managed to convince his mother to let Brody spend the night. Gigi was uncomfortable and awkward. After the boy had gone upstairs, Brody offered to leave, but Gigi said it wasn't necessary. Brody lied when Gigi asked how he'd known where to find them. He claimed that he'd made finding Gigi and Shane his \"mission\" in life. \"I never forgot you,\" he said, and told Gigi he still cared for her. Brody said he knew she was still hung up on Rex, but reminded her that Rex had made his choice, \"in front of God and everyone.\" Gigi helped Brody set up bedding on the couch, then wiped her tears as she retreated upstairs, beaten and confused. \n\n\nBack at the wedding reception, Rex and Adriana had their \"first dance\" together. As other Llanview couples took the stage along with them, a haunted Rex looked off into nothingness, lost as Adriana held her close to him. \n\n\nIn Virginia Beach, Cole emerged from his hospital room only to be buttonholed by Todd, who ordered Cole to \"make\" Starr forgive Todd. The police pulled Todd off of the teen, and arrested him for assault. Todd blamed John, but Blair stepped out of Starr's room and admitted that she was the one who'd had him busted. Cole shoved past Todd and entered Starr's room, and as Todd was rushed away, John comforted Blair. Back in Starr's hospital room, the young lovers held each other on Starr's bed, and looked at the sonogram picture of their unborn child. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While Starr is in the hospital, and after Blair has found out that her daughter is pregnant, she tells her she will be there for her and see her through this. And she regrets making Starr feel as though she could not have told her mom about it and that she had no choice except to run. And Blair has the cops arrest Todd for causing Starr to fall and assaulting Cole. John is there for Cole. Nobody will forgive Todd for what he did. At Rex and Adriana's wedding, Brody shows up out of nowhere and announces himself to Shane. Gigi is stunned and not certain what to do, having believed all these years that he is dead, and right after she was ready to announce that Rex is Shane's father. Although Rex and Adriana had their doubts about their marriage, they take their vows and are officially married. Brody reminds Gigi that he knows she may still have feelings for Rex. But she must know of the choice he made in front of everybody and in front of God. Jared, Nigel and Natalie are all very worried what David might do now that he's found out that he is Asa's real son, so they hog tie him.",
