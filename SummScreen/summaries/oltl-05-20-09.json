Relieved to learn that his nightmares of losing his beloved were just fantasy, Rex snuggled up to Gigi as she promised to never leave him. \n\n\nSuddenly, Shane's voice interrupted Rex's reverie, and he woke up once more, this time into the real world, where Shane was complaining of sudden stomach pains. Fearing that Shane's illness was relapsing, Rex leapt out of bed and hit the lights, awakening an annoyed Stacy on the couch. Rex told Stacy that they had to get Shane to the hospital, and grabbed the phone to call Gigi, though Stacy attempted to convince him not to. Irritated, Shane said Gigi was probably with Brody, anyway. Rex told Shane and Stacy that Gigi was Shane's mother, and had to be there for him. \n\n\nAt the Kappa Alpha Delta fraternity house, John stormed into Kevin Buchanan's former bedroom after gunning Powell down. Tossing Powell's body aside, he quickly freed Todd and Marty from their bonds. \n\n\nJohn reassured Todd that the children were safe, and asked about Blair and T\u00e9a. Marty explained that Powell had taken the women away, and informed John that she had regained her memories. As she stared at Chloe, she told John that Powell had told them that the child was Starr's, not Jessica's. \n\n\nTodd, Marty, John, and Chloe made their way down to the foyer, where Todd was shocked to see the unconscious Rebecca. John explained Rebecca had been Powell's accomplice. Todd wanted to search the house for Blair and T\u00e9a, but John convinced him to get Marty and Chloe to the hospital in Rebecca's car. John promised he would find the others. Reluctantly, Todd agreed, leaving with Marty and the baby as John headed for the basement. \n\n\nIn the boiler room, T\u00e9a struggled for breath as she prepared to tell Blair her deep, dark secret. Blair suggested she hurry up, as they were both on the verge of blacking out from the gas leak. Lost in her thoughts, T\u00e9a told Blair she'd been holding her secret in for a long time, and hadn't told a living soul. She hoped that if Blair lived, she could do something about it. Just as T\u00e9a was about to spill the beans, she turned to look at Blair, finding her unconscious. \n\n\nOvercome, T\u00e9a laid her head on Blair's shoulder. She murmured that she wished they didn't have to die in such a way, and admitted that, like Blair, she'd wanted to die in Todd's arms, with him telling her she was the only woman he loved. Her words trailing off, T\u00e9a passed out. \n\n\nOut on the road, Brody and Jessica sped towards the police station. Jessica was beside herself with fear for Chloe, and as her agitation grew, her mind began to summon more and more flashbacks to the night of the baby's birth. \n\n\nBrody noticed Jessica's altered state, and asked her if she was all right. Jessica told Brody she was having strange memories of Bess and Chloe that didn't make sense, but insisted she was fine and told him to keep going. Soon, however, her fragmented memories of Bess and the Chloe/Hope switch overtook her, and Jessica passed out. Panicked, Brody drove towards Llanview Hospital. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki, Clint, and Charlie were surprised when Natalie stopped them from following Jessica to the station. Jared and Natalie explained that they hadn't been able to tell the whole truth while Jessica was present. Viki wanted to know what was going on, and Natalie confessed the truth: Chloe was not Jessica's baby. \n\n\nAs Jared and Natalie began to unspool the sordid tale of the baby switch, Viki, Clint, and Charlie listened with shock and disbelief. Clint said it couldn't be possible, as he and Viki had found Jessica with Chloe at the cottage. Natalie explained that they'd found her there, but not with her baby. Jared and Natalie recounted their investigation into Jessica's mysterious hospital parking pass, and the security camera footage, which had led them to realize why Bess had shown herself to the world in order to protect Jessica. They told their parents that after Chloe was stillborn, Bess had taken her to the hospital, and swapped her with Starr and Cole's living child. \n\n\nClint was in denial, and demanded proof. Jared and Natalie said they'd run DNA tests with Kyle Lewis, who had turned on them and blackmailed them with the truth. Viki and Clint couldn't believe they had chosen to keep the information from the family. Natalie begged for understanding, and said she felt she'd had no choice but to protect Jessica from another horrible loss. Clint thundered that the switch proved Jessica was not integrated, and they were playing with fire. Natalie said she'd only tried to do what was best for her sister. Jared added that they knew Starr and Cole were investigating Hope's death, and thus had planned to come clean to everyone in the morning. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Brody rushed into the emergency room carrying the unconscious Jessica. She was quickly admitted to an exam room, but when Jessica awoke, all she could think of was getting to Chloe. Brody implored her to rest while he called her parents. Leaving Jessica's room, Brody called Viki at Llanfair. He asked her to come to the hospital, and said Jessica was having a strange episode. Fearing the worst, Viki and Clint headed for the hospital. \n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Rex, Stacy, and Shane waited on a doctor. Gigi arrived and rushed to her son's side, but Shane gave her the cold shoulder, asking if she'd been with Brody. Gigi said she had been home alone, missing him. As Stacy sneered, Gigi hustled Rex away for a parental pow-wow. \n\n\nWhile a doctor examined Shane, Rex and Gigi went over Shane's symptoms and vented their fears together. Stacy repeatedly tried to butt into the conversation and draw Rex's attention, to no avail. \n\n\nShane returned with the doctor, who explained that Shane was fine and had just had too much junk food at a friend's house. Rex and Gigi were relieved, and Rex apologized for calling Gigi out in the middle of the night. Gigi reassured him that Shane was her son, too, and they shared the same love for him. Stacy looked on in disgust. \n\n\nAs the Morascos took Shane back to Rex's loft, Shane told Gigi she hadn't needed to come all the way back to the apartment, and asked her to leave. Gigi said he was the one that would be leaving. She ordered her son to pack his bags; he was going home with her. \n\n\nBack at the KAD house, John entered the basement and quickly surmised that Blair and T\u00e9a were in the boiler room. Breaking the door down, he found them inside the gas-choked chamber. John whipped out his phone and called the Llanview police department. He explained that he had killed Powell Lord, and asked for an ambulance. \n\n\nUpstairs in the foyer, Rebecca came to, calling for Powell. She heard John in the basement, telling the police he had killed Powell. Staggering to her feet, she headed downstairs. \n\n\nBack on the road, Todd and Marty made their own way to the hospital with Chloe. As Marty took stock of her returned memories, she expressed surprise that Todd had pushed her to take them back, as it meant she'd hate him even more than before. Marty thought it was sick that Todd had been the one to give her back her life, but Todd said it had been the only thing he could do. \n\n\nTodd and Marty marveled at Chloe, and as Todd looked at her, he felt certain she resembled Starr. He asked Marty if she could see the resemblance, and wondered if Chloe really could be Hope. Todd and Marty agreed to have tests run before approaching the kids, and Marty feared for Jessica if their suspicions were proven correct. Todd said he didn't think his niece could handle the shock. \n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Jared and Natalie sat alone with Charlie, worrying about Jess. Jared asked if his father could understand the impossible choice they'd had to make for Jessica. Charlie said that he of all people understood making the wrong choice for the right reasons. Natalie was consumed with fear, worrying what would become of her sister when the truth came out. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Todd and Marty arrived with Chloe, just as Viki and Clint entered and met with Brody outside Jessica's room. Upon seeing the baby, Viki screamed, \"Chloe!\" Hearing her mother's cry from the nearby exam room, Jessica rushed out into the hallway and tore Chloe from Marty's arms, overjoyed to be reunited with her \"daughter.\" \n\n\nAt the KAD house, John raced into the boiler room and carried Blair out, laying her against the wall in the corridor. As he ran back in to get T\u00e9a, Rebecca made her way into the basement. \n\n\nJust as John had scooped T\u00e9a up, Rebecca entered the boiler room. John told Rebecca they had to get out, but Rebecca just grinned at him and held up a box of matches. John screamed for Rebecca to stop, but Rebecca lit a match, and the boiler room exploded with light. \n\n\n",

Marty tells John that she has her memory back. Todd and Marty take Chloe to the hospital while John goes to find Tea and Blair.
