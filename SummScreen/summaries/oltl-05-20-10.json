Langston wanted to talk about it and explain her side, which Markko agreed with because he thought that she at least owed him that. He was surprised to learn that she had been sleeping with Ford for a few months. He asked how many times Langston and Ford had slept together. When she confessed that it had happened \"a lot of times,\" Markko threw a chair. A crying Langston apologized and said that she had never meant for it to happen.\n\n\nBanging on the table, Markko asked if she was in love, or if it was just sex. She didn't know, and revealed that she was confused and scared about spending the rest of her life with Markko and not knowing anything else. Markko reminded Langston about how her cousin Lola threw herself at Markko. He also related that there were plenty of good-looking girls on campus that were probably more experienced than Langston. However, he never acted on his thoughts of these girls because he loved Langston and only wanted her.\n\n\nLangston hated herself and admitted she'd made a huge mistake. As Markko attempted to figure out where they had slept together, he realized that Hannah was right -- Langston was the girl in Ford's office with him. Markko felt like an idiot for feeling guilty about being jealous. He said that everything Langston wrote in the musical was a lie, but Langston denied it because she remembered every single word. Suddenly, it dawned on Markko that she was the girl in the hotel room with Ford. Markko yelled that he could never hate anyone as much as he hated her.\n\n\nLangston explained that she had tried to pull herself away from Ford multiple times, but couldn't. Markko wondered why she didn't just break up with him, but she said she was waiting until after he was done with finals. Markko said that she was his future and that everything he did was for her. He wondered if Ford was the only guy she had cheated on him with. He said he didn't know her anymore and that they were through. Langston asked where he was going to go, but Markko reminded her that he had been homeless before when he had defended Langston against his parents. Leaving the apartment, he said that his parents had warned him that she was nothing but \"a cheap slut.\"\n\n\nAt Rodi's, John reread Natalie's letter. Roxy entered, wondering where Natalie was. John didn't know, but Roxy said it didn't matter because she was right that John would show up. She said that Natalie was there - and very drunk - earlier, but that the kiss she had seen between John and Marty \"did a number\" on her. Roxy wondered what the kiss was about. John said that they were just saying goodbye. Roxy told him that it was great that he had shown up, but he was too late.\n\n\nJohn related that he forgot that Natalie tended to act first then ask questions later. Roxy suggested that they break out some drinks because there was nothing left to do. However, John thought otherwise. He asked Roxy what Natalie's flight number was as he called the airport. Although Roxy didn't know, John learned that some flights had been delayed, and ran out of Rodi's.\n\n\nBrody opened his door to find Natalie, who hoped that Brody had a better night than she did. She confided that John had read the letter and never showed up at Rodi's, so she was there to say goodbye. She was leaving Llanview for good, but wanted to catch Brody up to speed before she left. She asked for a ride to the airport, but Brody refused, since he had been drinking as well. Looking at Brody's watch, she said she wouldn't make her flight, anyway, since she had waited too long for John at Rodi's.\n\n\nDrinking some of Brody's liquor, Natalie explained how she let Roxy convince her to go find John, only to find him kissing Marty with the letter sitting open on John's desk. She related that she wasn't sorry for what she did, only embarrassed. Brody explained how Jessica seemed to remember something, but then denied it. He told Natalie about how Jessica rigged the voting so she and Cristian would be Prom King and Queen, but he rejected her in front of everyone. To top it all off, she had seen Cristian propose to Layla, so she had been a wreck. Brody had tried to tell Jessica that she couldn't remember anything because she didn't want to, and that she had almost been raped by her biological father. She didn't want to hear it and hated him for saying anything.\n\n\nNatalie got on the phone in order to book a seat on the next flight to London. Brody told her that he was going to book the seat right next to hers. She told him to stay because the Llanview Police Department needed him, and she would feel better to know that Brody was looking after John. The pair wished to magically forget their troubles, or to at least have a distraction. After relating their feelings to each other about their lost loves, the two shared a kiss.\n\n\nFord was surprised to open his door to Jessica. She wanted to see Cristian, who wasn't there, but Ford invited her in with a smile anyway. He got Jessica a glass of water as she apologized for barging in. He said it was all right because his plans had fallen through, but asked Jessica what happened. She told a cringing Ford about rigging the Prom King and Queen votes and seeing Cristian propose to Layla.\n\n\nFord said that Cristian was a fool, and related that Ford had been seeing a girl but she left him to chase after another guy. He asked about Brody, but Jessica, who thought she was wrong about Brody being a decent guy, never wanted to see him again. Ford offered her some wine, because he wasn't going to \"treat her like a baby.\" Jessica shared that Asa always said not to trust men that plied you with liquor, with which Ford agreed.\n\n\nJessica believed that Ford probably thought she was stupid, and that it wasn't smart to try to see Cristian. She had just wanted to remind him that this was the night she was supposed to lose her virginity. A confused Ford mentioned that he thought she had a kid. Jessica knew she wasn't really a virgin. She explained how she had dreamt about it all her life and thought that she'd be a virgin forever. \"You don't have to be,\" Ford told her.\n\n\nJessica finally convinced herself that Cristian didn't want a high school girl. Ford proposed that they could still make Jessica's night special. \"You and me?\" she asked. Jessica reasoned that it was time for her to grow up and that she was ready. Ford took her hand and led her to his bedroom.\n\n\nT\u00e9a looked at a picture of her and Dani as Blair sat down with two glasses of wine. T\u00e9a said that Blair must have been at an all-time low to be spending time with her instead of with Elijah. Blair mistakenly said that she'd live, but regretted it when T\u00e9a said she wouldn't. T\u00e9a said that Blair would have a couple more months to kick her around, then she could spend the rest of her life with Elijah. T\u00e9a decided to call Dani and check up on her.\n\n\nAt the Buenos D\u00edas, Dani, Matthew, Destiny, and Darren discussed how odd it was that Cristian won Prom King. As Dani's phone rang, Nate asked his friends if anyone else wanted more soda and walked away. Matthew asked Destiny if she was having fun. She was, \"kind of,\" but she figured that Markko probably wasn't.\n\n\nDani got off the phone to find Nate alone, asking if she was having fun. She was, and wondered if he was. He said that he was having fun when he almost got to dance with Dani.\n\n\nAcross the diner, Matthew glared at Nate talking to Dani while he questioned whether or not Markko would forgive Langston. A surprised Destiny asked him if he would forgive his girl if she had cheated on him. Matthew got up and told Dani that he promised T\u00e9a that he would have Dani home on time. They left a sad-looking Nate in the diner.\n\n\nDarren was showing Destiny pictures that he had taken throughout the night when he heard a horn honking. He looked out the window and saw his parents. He made sure that Destiny didn't want a ride home, kissed her, then left. An initially disgusted Destiny smiled.\n\n\nOutside the diner, Whitney told Nate that she was glad she went to the prom with Nate instead of her boyfriend because she had lots of fun with him. She leaned in to kiss him, but he pulled back, saying that he just wanted to be friends. Whitney understood that he was holding out for \"the real thing.\"\n\n\nBack at the hotel, Blair turned the television on, but quickly switched it off when she found that the movie playing was Terms of Endearment. Blair promised that she would be there whenever T\u00e9a needed. T\u00e9a found it strange that Blair was at her best when the times were worst. T\u00e9a recalled that the last time the two were that close, they were about to die in a basement. She told Blair that there was something she needed to say.\n\n\nT\u00e9a explained that she was doing everything she could to keep Todd out of prison because she wanted to believe him, and because she was still hoping that he could have a real relationship with Dani. As she was about to reveal something to Blair, T\u00e9a's vision grew blurry and she lost her balance. Blair asked where the doctor's number was, but T\u00e9a swore that she was all right. Blair ordered T\u00e9a to go to bed.\n\n\nOutside of the hotel room, Matthew and Dani talked about how much fun they had that night, and kissed. Matthew told Dani that he loved her. A flustered Dani called him sweet and bolted into the hotel room.\n\n\nBlair tucked T\u00e9a into bed and told her that she would be there with her. Dani walked in and asked what was wrong. Thinking quickly, Blair lied that T\u00e9a had eaten some bad seafood at the restaurant and would be fine. Dani accepted it and left the room to get changed. Blair warned T\u00e9a that she would have to tell Dani soon. Because Dani was back, T\u00e9a told Blair that she didn't have to stay. Making sure T\u00e9a was all right first, Blair said she'd see T\u00e9a the next day at the hospital.\n\n\nDani returned to T\u00e9a's room and made sure that her mother was all right, then got into bed with her. \"I really need you,\" she told her mother. T\u00e9a asked if her daughter had fun, which Dani confirmed. Skeptically, T\u00e9a asked what happened. Dani replied that the night just went by so fast for all the preparation. \"That's why we have to make every minute count,\" T\u00e9a replied.\n\n\nMatthew returned to the diner, and was happy to see that Destiny was still there. Matthew admitted that he told Dani he loved her. Destiny, who had been there before, told him that it was the stupidest thing he could've done. Matthew sarcastically thanked her for the sympathy. Destiny, already knowing the answer, asked if Dani had said it back. Matthew reasoned that he wasn't just some random guy. \"Like Nate?\" Destiny replied.\n\n\n",
