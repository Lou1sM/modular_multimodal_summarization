Natalie feared that Liam would be cold, because it was late.  Natalie then revealed that John and Brody had gathered a lead and had flown out of the room.  When Natalie attempted to get out of bed to help with the search, Rex suggested that Natalie watch television.\n\n\nNatalie told Rex that Clint had offered a million dollar reward for information that would result in finding Liam.  Natalie then apologized to Rex, when she realized that Clint had still not acknowledged Rex as his son.  When Rex mentioned Marty's tape, Natalie revealed that she had taken the tape, and that she remembered that she had rushed home with it.  However, Natalie could not remember what was on the tape.\n\n\nNatalie felt that if she could remember what was on the tape, they could know where Marty had taken Liam.  Rex handed Natalie a strawberry milkshake and remarked that Roxy was in Vegas for the Barry Manilow tour.  Natalie refused the shake and revealed that Marty had also killed Dr. Buhari.  Rex believed that there would be a clue to the reason for the doctor's murder on the tape.\n\n\nNatalie cried that a psycho had her baby.  When Rex asked Natalie what she could last remember, Natalie pictured that she had kissed Brody.  Natalie admitted that she and Brody had kissed. She thought that they had been getting closer, thanks to Liam.  Rex wondered if Natalie was falling for Brody.\n\n\nIn his hotel room, Cutter awoke on the floor and wondered what had happened.  He then remembered that Wes had knocked him out.  \"Yep, you just got knocked out by your wife, who thinks she's a dude, who thinks you're gay.  Llanview's really working out for you.\"\n\n\nAt the same hotel, John and Brody burst into the door of Marty's room with guns and found Wes, who told John that he was just hanging around.  Wes then reminded John that he had once worked for him, and Brody quickly explained that Wes was another one of Jessica's alters.  Frustrated, John left the room.  Outside, John placed a call and stated that Marty had just been at the room less than an hour earlier, and that he wanted all units out for the search.\n\n\nBrody stressed that he needed to find Marty Saybrooke, because Marty had taken his kid.  Brody informed Wes that Marty was sick, and that she was dangerous, however, Wes refused to renege on his word to Marty.  Brody grabbed Wes's shoulders and yelled that she was really Jessica, not Wes.  When Wes insisted that he was not Jessica, Brody begged for Jessica to help him.  John walked back into the room and told Brody to back off.\n\n\nWhen Cutter entered the room, Tess told Cutter to tell the bozo to keep his hands off of Cutter's wife.  Cutter cheered that Tess was back, and Tess denied knowing anything about Marty.  When John told Tess that Marty had kidnapped Liam, Tess said to John, \"Hold on a second...you're helping this monkey find the kid that he made with your skanky ex.  That's awesome.\"\n\n\nTess looked around and realized that she was not in her room, and that she was not wearing her clothes.  Once Cutter explained, Tess recognized that Wes had made an appearance.  When Brody asked for Tess to let Jessica out, Tess refused.  Tess claimed, \"Look, don't worry.  She's not even trying to get out, ape-man.  She doesn't want to see your love child reunited with you and Natalie.\"  Brody then arrested Tess, who maintained that Wes was the witness that Brody wanted.\n\n\nBack in Natalie's room, Rex asked about John, and Natalie realized that the ship had already sailed for Natalie and John as a couple.  Rex then insisted that Natalie get some rest.  Rex told Natalie that he would see what he could find out and left.  John walked in the door and stated that he would not stop searching for Liam, until Liam was safe.  John hugged Natalie and held her in his arms.\n\n\nIn Kelly's hospital room, Dorian greeted Kelly, who had just regained consciousness.  After Kelly asked if the police had caught Marty, Dorian claimed that John and the entire Llanview police force were after Marty.  Dorian then revealed that she had not been the only all-night visitor for Kelly.\n\n\nAs Joey gazed at Kelly and held her hand, he expressed that he was glad that Kelly was still with them.  Kelly insisted that Joey return home to get some rest, but Joey refused to leave.  Joey insisted that he owed Kelly an apology and then revealed that he had found out everything about Aubrey.  Joey announced that Cutter had married Tess and then had intended on selling Jessica back to the Buchanan family, so they could commit her.\n\n\nJoey also explained that Aubrey had expressed disbelief that Cutter could ever do something like that, but then Aubrey had claimed that Cutter had been raised by their father.  Joey pointed out that it had given him a pretty good picture of Aubrey, so he had talked to his dad.  Joey exclaimed that Clint had revealed that Aubrey and Cutter were actually lovers, not brother and sister, and that it had all been a scam.\n\n\nJoey recognized that Kelly had been trying to tell him that all along, but that he had refused to see it.  Kelly stated that she had hated being right about Aubrey, because she had not wanted to see Joey hurt.  Joey said that Clint had asked Joey to pretend that nothing was wrong, so he would not tip his hand to Aubrey.  However, Joey did not know how he could pretend that everything was okay, when a fantastic person, who was really in love with him, had been standing right in front of him all the time.\n\n\nIn Clint's room at the hospital, Clint told the news reporter, Blanca, that he had killed Eddie Ford, just as Bo and Nora walked in.  Blanca then had the camera rolling, as she held a televised interview with Clint for Channel 7, WVL News.  After Clint admitted on live television that he had confessed to murder, Blanca asked why Bo and Nora had cut Clint loose.  Clint indicated that the police commissioner and the district attorney had found no evidence, because Clint had covered his tracks.\n\n\nClint exclaimed that he had gotten away with murder, because he had been resourceful.  Clint then revealed that there were other things that he had gotten away with.  When Blanca questioned if Clint had gotten away with more crimes, Clint stated that he had put his nephew, David Vickers, in a Moroccan prison to keep David away from his father, Bo, and from David's fianc\u00e9e, Dorian Lord.  Clint reflected that Bo and Rex had eventually found David and rescued him.\n\n\nClint then revealed that he had hired his employee, Vimal Patel, to break into the hospital laboratory and change the paternity results of Clint's daughter's unborn baby.  Clint exclaimed that when Vimal had been arrested, Clint had kept quiet and let Vimal take the fall for it.  When Blanca asked if Clint were ready to recognize Rex Balsom as his son, Clint asked to move on and then explained the whole story about Robert Ford, Brody, and Jessica.  Clint insisted that he had just tried to give Jessica a happy ending, but he had been wrong, because the consequences had turned out to be much worse than the truth.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Rama and Aubrey were watching Clint's interview, and Rama hoped that Vimal would be able to get out of jail.  Then Rama remembered that Vimal thought that Rama was pregnant.  Aubrey wondered why Joey had been short to her earlier in the day; she felt that something was wrong.  However, Aubrey believed that Cutter would not out her, and that if Joey knew anything, he would have already thrown her out.\n\n\nAubrey then feared that Clint had already told Joey about Cutter and her.  As Aubrey tried to call Joey, Rama grabbed the phone from her hand.  Rama yelled that Joey would kick them both out on the streets if Aubrey told him.  Rama then explained that Aubrey would also be sent to jail, and that they would both lose everything.\n\n\nAubrey tried to calm herself and stated that it was over between her and Cutter, and that she had since fallen in love with Joey.  However, Rama insisted that the truth was not always the answer, and that Vimal would hate her if he knew the truth.  When Aubrey exclaimed that she did not know what to do, Rama said that when Aubrey figured it out, she should let Rama know.\n\n\nIn Kelly's room at the hospital, Dorian informed Joey and Kelly that Clint had confessed to killing Eddie Ford.  Dorian speculated that no one had forced Clint to confess, and that he had just taken his chances.  Joey stood up and remarked, \"You know, maybe it's time for me to put my cards on the table and take my chances too.\"\n\n\nAfter Joey had left the room, Kelly told Dorian that Joey had said almost everything that she had wanted to hear.  When Dorian asked if Joey would kick the slut out, Kelly mentioned that he was thinking about it.  Dorian maintained that Joey and Kelly belonged together.  \"And the sooner you make that happen, the better.\"  At the Buchanan mansion, Joey ran into the lobby, and Aubrey leaped off of the stairs.  Joey glared at Aubrey.\n\n\nIn Clint's hospital room, Blanca asked if Clint had anything else to tell her, and Bo demanded that she stop filming.  As Blanca left, she yelled, \"I want an exclusive when you haul him up to Statesville.\"  When Nora asked Clint why he had held the interview, Clint claimed that he had stopped Blanca from saying that Matthew had murdered Eddie Ford.  When Nora claimed that it was all a trick, Clint asked why Bo had not told Nora that Clint was dying.\n\n\nClint recognized that he had a rare blood type, which would make it difficult to find a donor.  Nora called Clint a martyr and asked him if he wanted her gratitude.  Clint stated that he did not want Nora's gratitude and had only wanted to protect Matthew from Blanca.  Clint realized that he had wound Matthew up and had then turned him loose.  Clint cried, \"Please, would you give Matthew a chance?  Matthew's life is just beginning.  Mine's over.\"\n\n\nAs Rex walked up to Clint's room, a television reporter informed Rex that Clint had still refused to acknowledge Rex as a son.  Rex yelled, \"No comment,\" and stormed off.\n\n\nAn agent handed Agent Baker a file with the encrypted document, and Baker entered the security room.  Agent Baker greeted the man, who was restrained in a chair, and who had Todd's original face, which included the scar.  Baker claimed that he had questions for the man.  Baker shined a light into the man's eyes and acknowledged that the man was in remarkable shape after how long the man had been in a catatonic state.\n\n\nWhen the man asked for the date, Baker informed him that it was May 20, 2011.  The man insisted that the year was 2003, not 2011.  The man could not believe that he had been in that room for eight years and screamed to be released.  Baker revealed that they had a few things to discuss, which included John McBain.  The man stated that he did not know John McBain, and that he did not know anything about the encrypted file.\n\n\nWhen the man claimed, \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Agent Baker insisted, \"We both know better.\"  The original Todd-like man cried, \"Whatever it is that you think that I know, I don't know, I forgot.  I...it's been for eight years?  Eight years?\"  Baker acknowledged, \"Eight years.  It went like that in your mind.  You are here with me now, and I can see your mind working.\"  \n\n\nThe man maintained, \"I don't know what that means.  What are you even talking about?\"  Baker yelled, \"You took it.  We know that, and we need it back.\"  After the man stated, \"Okay,\" Baker said, \"Okay, now make it easy on yourself and tell me.  Where is it?\" \n\n\n",
