He brought up the issue of money and then mentioned that Jamie needed more tests.  Ramsey took the bait and offered Antonio a way out of his financial troubles.  Ramsey said that he knew of a shipment of expensive jewels scheduled to be delivered to Lindsay Rappaport's studio.  Ramsey wanted Antonio to make sure that the shipment never arrived.  He asked if Ramsey intended for Antonio to steal the Crown Jewels of Mendorra.  Ramsey explained that all Antonio had to do was to make certain that the theft took place.  Antonio tried to get the details about the crime and names of his accomplices but Ramsey remained tight-lipped.  The only information that Ramsey was willing to reveal was the name of the person he intended frame for the heist: Talia.  After that stunning announcement, Ramsey put the wheels in motion.  He called Talia to his office and told her that he had decided to put her on a security detail with Antonio.  Antonio managed to whisper to Talia that he would fill her in about Ramsey's plans in the car but before they could leave the station, Ramsey had another surprise for them.  He assigned Eddie to the security detail as well.\n\n\nSarah and Cris were cuddled in bed together as they read the morning edition of The Sun.  It featured a front page story about Adriana's wedding. Talk of the wedding eventually led to talk of Antonio and Talia.  When Sarah admitted that she had thought that Antonio and Talia were deeply in love, Cris fell silent.  A bit later, when Sarah made advances, Cris pulled away and told her that he wasn't in the mood to make love.  Sarah appeared hurt and asked him if she had somehow angered him.  Cris admitted that he had a guilty conscience because he had been lying to her.  Sarah listened quietly as Cris told her that Antonio and Talia hadn't really ended their relationship and that Jamie wasn't sick.  Sarah wasn't angry.  She understood why Cris had to lie to her.  Although, she did admit that she felt horrible about the way that she had treated Talia.  Cris reassured Sarah that Talia wouldn't hold that against her.  The point had been to make the split believable.  \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Addie was in the living room, with Langston and Markko, reading the paper.  As the three were chatting about Adriana's wedding, Blair and Starr, accompanied by John and Cole, arrived home.  Langston was excited to see her friend and ran into the foyer to greet her.  Blair was surprised to discover that Addie knew about the baby.  Langston quickly filled Blair and Starr in on what had happened since they had left town.  Eventually everyone moved to the living room where Blair discussed Todd's arrest.  She made it clear that Todd did not know about Starr's pregnancy and she wanted him to remain in the dark about it.  John supported Blair's decision.  After Addie and the kids wandered off, John advised Blair to file for a restraining order against Todd to keep him from having contact with her and the children.  He also told Blair that he felt Nora had a right to know about Starr's pregnancy since she was Cole's legal guardian. Once Blair gave John her consent, they went to tell Cole that it was time that he went home to Nora.  Cole was reluctant to leave Starr's side until she convinced him that she would be fine. Blair also reassured Cole that he could see Starr whenever he wanted.  After Cole and John left, Blair and Starr had a heart to heart talk. Blair apologized for her mistakes, told her daughter that she loved her and promised Starr that she would protect her from Todd.  They also discussed Starr's plans for the baby.  Starr admitted that she had not yet decided what she wanted to do about her pregnancy.  They were startled when someone began loudly pounding on the front door. Starr was certain that Todd was on the other side.\n\n\nJohn and Cole returned to the Buchanan mansion.  Nora was relieved to see Cole but quickly realized that he was keeping something from her.  John coaxed Cole into telling Nora about the baby.  She was stunned but vowed to stand by Cole's side.\n\n\nBo arrived at Lindsay's studio and surprised her with a passionate kiss.  She was overjoyed when Bo told her that seeing Gigi lose her second chance at love with Rex had opened his eyes to his second chance with Lindsay.  Lindsay was almost giddy as she confessed to feeling the same way.  R.J.'s untimely arrival had the same effect as cold water for the lovebirds.  R.J. waited until Bo left before he began berating Lindsay.  He was angry that Lindsay had picked Bo over him.  Lindsay insisted that she felt nothing for R.J. but friendship.  R.J. didn't believe Lindsay.  Things took an ugly turn when Lindsay made the mistake of demanding that R.J. respect what she had with Bo.  R.J. was quick to remind Lindsay that what she had with Bo was built on a very large lie; she had faked insanity to avoid being convicted of murder.  Later, Bo returned to the studio and found Lindsay crying.  When he asked her if R.J. had upset her, Lindsay tried to brush it off as nothing to worry about.  Meanwhile, R.J. paid Nora a visit.  He told Nora that he needed to talk to her about Lindsay.\n\n\nDavid woke up in a barn next to Clint's horse, Whiskey.  David was clad in a pair of underwear and nothing else.  He was also tied to a chair with tape over his mouth.  Inside the Buchanan mansion, Jared was on the phone with Natalie.  He bragged to her about his method of dealing with David, the night before.  Just before they ended their call, they each said \"I love you.\"  Unfortunately for them, they had been overheard.  Jared managed to cover his slip and convinced Nora and Clint that it had merely been an expression of gratitude.  He quickly made his excuses and started to leave when he heard Clint tell Nora that he intended to go for a morning ride.  Jared scrambled to stop Clint from heading to the stables and discovering David, bound and gagged.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie ended her call with Jared and lied to her mother.  She told her that she had been speaking to Jessica.  She was forced to continue lying when Viki and Charlie asked her where she had disappeared to, after she had left Adriana's wedding.  Later, Natalie managed to slip away and go to the stables where David was being held.  She pulled off David's gag and offered him water and food.  David demanded answers instead.  He wanted to know who the real Buchanan heir was since it wasn't Jared.  Natalie ignored David's request.  They were soon joined by Jared, who tried to scare David into cooperating.  David saw through Jared's game and turned the tables on him.  He offered to keep Jared and Natalie's secret and leave town, for a price.  Natalie and Jared realized that paying David off would only delay the inevitable.  They decided that it was time to tell the Buchanans that Jared was not Asa's son.  While Jared went to see Charlie, Natalie hid David under some horse blankets, with the intention of releasing him after they talked to their families.  While Natalie was busy with David, Clint arrived at the stables, dressed for a ride.\n\n\nJared went to Llanfair to see his father and interrupted a tender moment between Viki and Charlie. After Viki excused herself, Jared told Charlie that it was time for him to tell Viki that he was Jared's father.\n\n\n",
