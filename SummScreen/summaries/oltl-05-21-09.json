    "soap_central": "\n The Wheels on the Bus... \n\n\n \nBlaming Rex for Shane's overdose on junk food even though it was at the hands of Moe and Noelle, Gigi firmly demanded that Shane had to return home with her. She suggested that Rex come with them if he felt that he couldn't be separated from his son. Stacy voiced her opinion on the subject, feeling that things could be uncomfortable in the middle of Gigi's love life, especially if Brody were around. Snapping at her sister, Gigi informed her that Brody was not at her home and that she would not leave without her son. \n\n\nRex wanted to allow Shane to decide which parent to stay with, but Stacy again offered her advice. Feeling that Rex should take the lead, Stacy felt certain that Shane should be returned to his mother and that the boy was too young to decide for himself. Taking Stacy's advice, Rex agreed that Shane should return to his mother, who would be able to watch over his medicines, diet, and appointments. He promised to see him every day and firmly told his son that he did not have a choice. Rex put Shane in his place when the boy wasted no time in being rude to his mother. Rex expressed his unhappiness at the way the boy was treating Gigi. \n\n\nAfter Gigi and Shane left, Stacy assured Rex that he had made the right decision and that Shane would be fine. Rex wondered why it felt wrong. \n\n\nAs Starr and Cole slowly awakened from their night on the sofa, still clothed in their prom outfits, they looked around for their parents. The guards maintained their watch outside of Todd's house. Answering a sudden knock on the door, they were surprised to find Marcie and Michael. The couple was there to bring the teenagers up to date on the tests run to determine the cause of Hope's death. As Michael stammered on his words, Marcie cut to the chase. She informed Starr and Cole that the buried baby was not Hope. The four contemplated the possible scenarios leading to the incorrect baby being buried in Hope's plot. \n\n\nAs a skeptical Cole listened, the McBains shared their belief that the baby mix-up had probably occurred at the funeral home, because the hospital had a strict \"chain of custody\" regarding the handling of the baby. Cole didn't believe that there just happened to be another dead baby at the funeral home and felt certain that the confusion was at the hospital. \n\n\nStarr wondered if their baby could actually be alive, because the odds were slim that there were two dead babies on the same night. Insisting that they saw Hope after she died, Cole remained pessimistic as Starr suggested that perhaps it was someone else. Starr explained that she always felt that nothing felt real about her baby's death, especially when she held Chloe. \n\n\nCole admitted that while his feelings were the same as Starr's, he could not allow them to linger. He was sure that Hope was gone. Michael and Marcie left for the funeral home and promised to find out what happened to Hope. They assured the young couple that they were great parents for pursuing the mysterious turn of events involving their baby. \n\n\nAs Starr began to clean up her brothers' toys, she was short with Cole. He apologized for not backing her up in the belief that Hope was still alive. She declared that their beliefs were neither wrong nor right. He admitted that he couldn't allow himself to think about something that he couldn't have. He couldn't run away from the \"what is,\" he explained, since that was what led him to drugs in the first place. He had to concentrate and stay focused. \n\n\nAfter the explosion at the Kappa Alpha Delta house, an unconscious John and Blair slowly came to. John, managing to set himself free from the rubble, made his way to Blair and uncovered her, as well. Before she became hysterical, John reassured her that Powell was dead, that her kids were all safe, and that Marty and Todd had gotten out of the house. Blair wanted to help John locate T\u00e9a, but as they headed towards the boiler room, Bo arrived with a pair of EMTs. Bo and John gently uncovered T\u00e9a and the medical personnel got to work. She was placed on a stretcher and the EMTs headed for the hospital with her. \n\n\nJohn informed Bo that Rebecca was somewhere in the house. He told Bo about the doctor lighting a match with the escaping gas in the room. After Bo heard of the actions of Powell and Rebecca, he informed John that the APB and the arrest warrant for John had been called off. He wanted statements from both John and Blair, but agreed to wait until the following day. Blair refused medical help and insisted on seeing her children and Todd. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, a relieved Jessica was reunited with Chloe as her family and friends looked on in various stages of discomfort. Insisting that she merely had an anxiety attack, Jessica felt it unnecessary to be examined further. Todd explained that their crazy cousin Powell had taken Chloe and he and Marty filled everyone in on the events at the KAD house. A confused Jessica admitted that she couldn't understand why Chloe had been involved, but Todd reiterated that it was because Powell was crazy. As Jessica went into the examination room, she looked on uneasily when Todd asked to speak to Viki privately. \n\n\nClint listened as Brody told him about Jessica's behavior in the car. He felt certain that she had suffered more than an anxiety attack and had \"freaked out\" and then blacked out. He was certain she had suffered a breakdown. \n\n\nAs Todd told his sister what Powell had disclosed about the baby, Viki cut him off. She indicated that she had just learned Chloe's true identity prior to arriving at the hospital. She refused to disclose the fact that Natalie and Jared had been the ones to reveal the information and she admitted that she had no real evidence. They agreed that a DNA test was needed and that Jessica would have to be told. \n\n\nViki expressed her concern for her daughter's health and asked Todd and Marty to leave. She felt that she and Clint should be the ones to break the news to Jessica. \n\n\nAs the emergency room doctor perused Jessica's records, he asked about her time at St. Anne's. She filled him in quickly and briefly, and again insisted that she was feeling fine. Holding her baby, Jessica refused to be parted from Chloe and turned down everyone's offers to hold the baby while she herself was examined. While she was alone in the room, she looked into the mirror and saw Bess looking back, motioning for Jessica to remain quiet. Jessica continued to have flashbacks to the night of her baby's birth. \n\n\nAs Viki and Clint entered the room, Jessica demanded to know why everyone was trying to take her baby away. Viki quietly assured Jessica that they were trying to make things easy for her. Demanding to see the doctor, Jessica stated that she would check herself out if need be. Leaving to look for the doctor and feeling that Jessica was aware of the truth deep down inside, Clint and Viki felt that she would never be ready to hear the truth. \n\n\nBrody agreed that he would always be on Jessica's side. He was worried about Jessica and offered to hold Chloe. Hearing loud voices all at once inside her head, Jessica asked Brody to get her a glass of water. Spying the doctor's glasses left behind on the bed, she picked them up. Clint finally arranged to have Dr. Levin see Jessica and notified Viki that they would have to stall Jessica. \n\n\nJust then T\u00e9a was wheeled into the hospital. Brody told Viki and Clint that something was wrong with Jessica and that she wasn't behaving like herself. Heading into her room, they found Chloe and Jessica gone. \n\n\nTodd and Marty arrived at Todd's house, where Starr and Cole greeted them with colossal hugs. Todd expressed his regret; he felt responsible for the chain of events that lead to Powell's actions. Starr assured him that Powell's actions were Powell's fault, not Todd's. Starr was worried about her mother, so Todd comforted his daughter, explaining that John was searching for her and was probably with her even as they spoke. Cole was concerned for his mother but Marty swore that she was okay. Getting serious, Marty informed the teens that they all had something to discuss. Todd added that it was complicated. \n\n\nDriving down a country road, Bess drove quickly and began to sing to Chloe, seated in the backseat. \"The wheels on the bus go round and round...\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica senses that something is not right when she goes to the hospital with her baby. Outside the exam room, Viki, Clint, Todd, Marty and others are privately talking about what's going to happen when Jessica finds out that her baby died and that Chloe is actually Starr and Cole's child.

Blair and John are ok after the explosion. But Tea is in critical condition and taken to the hospital. Gigi takes Shane home to live with her. Rex agrees to the arrangement.
