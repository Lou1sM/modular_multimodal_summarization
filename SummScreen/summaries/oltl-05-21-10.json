When Gigi overheard the guard talking on the phone to his daughter, she guessed that the guard's daughter was four years old.  Gigi claimed, \"Every other word is why, every sentence I said for years started with because.\"  Gigi explained that she and Rex had a son, and that, although Rex's parents had abandoned him, he was still a good person.  Gigi stressed that Rex deserved to have a break, and that the guard should allow Rex the one phone call.  The guard handed Rex the phone.\n\n\nIn the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9 kitchen, Layla and Cristian showed Carlotta the engagement ring.  Carlotta expressed her surprise and gave Layla a huge hug.  Bo and Nora walked into the caf\u00e9 to spy on Matthew and found that Matthew had left.  Carlotta, Cristian, and Layla entered the caf\u00e9 from the kitchen and greeted Bo and Nora.  Cristian and Layla announced their engagement.  Carlotta insisted that booking the church was the most important part of the wedding, while Nora recognized that she would not have a clue about that.  Nora declared that since she was planning her second wedding within a year, she realized that she should have taken more time before deciding to marry Clint in the prior wedding, which would have saved everyone so much heartache.\n\n\nCarlotta and Cristian walked back into the kitchen, where Cristian informed his mother that he did not know that he was going to propose to Layla, until he realized that he could have lost Layla because of what had happened with Jessica.  When Carlotta asked if Cristian had kept a ring stashed away in his apartment, Cristian revealed that he had gone to Logan's and had purchased a ring in less than an hour.  When Cristian insisted that he loved Layla, Carlotta wondered how Jessica was going to take the news of Cristian's engagement.\n\n\nAfter placing a phone call at the caf\u00e9, Bo informed Nora that Matthew was home from the prom.  Layla insisted that Matthew had a good time and then left to call Adriana about her and Cristian's engagement.  Bo received a phone call from Rex and spoke to Rex about a few wedding details.  Bo then asked about Rex's progress in Arizona and encouraged Rex to \"hang in there,\" because Bo knew that Rex was a good investigator.  Bo reflected, \"A few years ago, you would have ended up in hot water without even trying, but now you know better.\"  Rex frowned and did not mention that he and Gigi were in jail.  When Bo asked Rex if something was wrong, Rex offered an excuse and insisted that Bo continue with his wedding plans.\n\n\nNora conveyed to Bo that they should have plants that, in the place of flowers at their wedding, could be donated afterwards.  When she saw that Bo was not listening, she said, \"Or we could...uh, chop them down...and cook them...or wear them...or eat them...Bo?\"  Bo told Nora that he felt that something was not right with Rex and feared that he had said the wrong thing.  Nora insisted that Bo was encouraging when talking to Rex, and that Rex would call back if he needed Bo.\n\n\nCristian told Carlotta that Jessica had rigged the vote for king and queen at the prom to ensure that Cristian and Jessica were king and queen.  Layla revealed that she almost felt sorry for Jessica.  Cristian recognized that Jessica was unable to face what her father had done to her.\n\n\nWhen Carlotta asked if Layla's family knew of the engagement, Layla indicated that she and Cristian had told Carlotta first.  Carlotta exclaimed that Layla needed to call her mother immediately and tell her the news, before somebody else told her.  After Carlotta went back into the kitchen, Cristian and Layla decided to travel to Maryland to deliver the happy news to Layla's mother.  When Layla told Nora that she and Cristian were flying to Maryland, Nora asked Layla to give Evangeline a kiss for her.  Bo and Nora congratulated the newly engaged couple and left the caf\u00e9.  Cristian insisted that Layla not worry about Jessica, and Layla replied, \"I just hope she gets her memory back.  I want her to be as happy with Brody as I am with you.\"\n\n\nWhen Gigi begged the guard to give Rex another call, the guard refused.  Rex revealed to Gigi that he did not want to tell Bo that he had messed up again.  Rex feared that Bo would believe that \"I am back to being the deadbeat that he first met.\"  Gigi insisted that Otto knew more than he was admitting, and Rex declared that maybe he and Gigi were better off not knowing.  Rex stressed that he just wanted to return home, so that he could spend time with Shane.  Gigi insisted that was her desire also.  As Rex and Gigi started to kiss, the guard interrupted them with an announcement that they had a visitor.  Rex and Gigi looked outside of the cell and saw Penny.\n\n\nAt Brody's apartment, Brody and Natalie fell into each other's arms and kissed.  They ravaged each other and stripped off their clothes, as Jessica's framed photo sat on Brody's dresser.  After their passionate lovemaking had ended, Brody and Natalie fell back into the pillows and questioned what had just happened.  Brody and Natalie acknowledged that their passion had not killed their pain; however, Natalie stated, \"On a good note, we didn't cheat on anyone.\"  Brody sadly agreed, \"Yeah...nobody's waiting up for us.\"\n\n\nNatalie told Brody how she had left the note for John, but that John had never shown up at Rodi's.    She observed, \"John doesn't want me.\"  As Natalie arose to leave, Brody apologized, but Natalie refused to accept his apology.  Natalie declared that they were just two friends comforting each other.  Brody asked if Natalie was still moving to London.  Brody stated that if Natalie were still going, he should go with Natalie, because Jessica hated him.\n\n\nBrody regretted that he had told Jessica about Mitch Laurence after the prom, but Natalie reminded Brody that Jessica had not believed what Brody had told her.  Natalie assessed, \"Look, Brody, Jessica is very lucky to have someone, who loves her as much as you do.\"  Brody picked up his Navy uniform jacket, just as Natalie told Brody that a cab had arrived.\n\n\nWhen Natalie and Brody questioned what their futures would be without John and Jessica, Brody put his jacket back down and recognized that he would work, train, and figure his future out.  Natalie provided that she had brothers that she could always rely on.  As Brody and Natalie said goodbye, Natalie reminded Brody to have faith.\n\n\nAt Ford's apartment, Ford asked Jessica to spend the night.  After Jessica agreed, Ford placed a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, obviously kept from a hotel room, on the apartment door to stop Cristian from \"barging in.\"  Ford promised to make Jessica forget about Cristian, Brody, and all of her other problems.  Jessica emphasized that she really did not know Ford, so Ford showed her all of his trophies and bragged about his past accomplishments.  \n\n\nFord acknowledged that Jessica needed to be adored and loved on her prom night and reminded Jessica that Cristian was an idiot not to see what was right in front of him.  Ford claimed, \"I can care about you the way Cristian can't, I will never hurt you the way Brody has.\"  Jessica still wanted Cristian.  Ford insisted that he and Jessica were meant to be together, and that he could take all of her pain away.  Ford and Jessica kissed.\n\n\nWhen Jessica shied away, Ford told Jessica to trust him, yet Jessica indicated that Ford felt new and blank.  Ford presented that it was good for them to start off on a blank slate, because they could make new memories.  Jessica agreed that she wanted to get over Cristian.\n\n\nAs Ford and Jessica kissed again, Ford drew her over to the bed.  When Ford kissed and touched her, Jessica recalled Mitch Laurence kissing her face.  Jessica leaped out of bed and screamed, \"No.\"  Jessica flew to the other side of the room and screamed that he was a pervert, because she was his daughter.  A confused Ford kept declaring that it was all right.  Jessica ran out of the apartment, plopped down on the floor in front of the apartment door, and admitted that Brody had been right about Mitch.\n\n\nAs Jessica sat outside of Ford's apartment, a flash of memories, when Brody had asked her for a dance flew through her mind.  Memories of her past continued to flood Jessica's mind, and then she remembered Bree.\n\n\nWhen Brody answered the knock on his door, he found Jessica and asked, \"Jessica, are you okay?\"  Jessica cried, \"I remember.\"\n\n\nAt the Llanview Airport, John asked the clerk about the flight to London, and the clerk told John that the plane had just departed five minutes earlier.  Kelly and Shaun, accompanied by Reed Wagner, arrived at the airport and ran into John.  Kelly informed John that her Aunt Dorian had provided Shaun for security, because Dorian had thought that whoever had killed Rodney and Melinda would be after Kelly too.  Kelly begged John for a break in the case of her mother's murder.  As John declared that he had no new information, he shoved a picture in his pocket.  Kelly asked John if he was looking for someone else.\n\n\nJohn stated that he needed to leave and insisted that the picture had nothing to do with Kelly or her mother's case.   Kelly asked Reed to please give John and Kelly a minute alone and told Shaun that nothing would happen to her, since she would be with John McBain.  Shaun said to Kelly, \"I'm not worried about you,\" and then asked John, \"Are you okay alone with her?\"  Kelly demanded, \"Stop it!  Go play with your gift bag.\"\n\n\nWhen Kelly asked John what was wrong, he answered that he did not like airports.  Kelly then stripped the picture out of John's shirt pocket and questioned why he would have Natalie's picture.  John maintained that everyone was okay, but Kelly still asked, \"What happened?\"  John told Kelly that he was trying to stop Natalie from going to London.  John informed Kelly that Marty had just ended John and Marty's relationship, after Marty had found a letter left for John from Natalie.  In her letter, Natalie had declared her love for John, and had expressed that she could no longer stay in Llanview, if John were going to be with someone else.  Kelly believed that was very romantic, but John reminded her that Natalie had left.  In another part of the airport, while Reed was talking on his cell phone, Shaun questioned Reed on the phone call and reminded Reed that it was part of his job to keep an eye on Kelly.\n\n\nAs John started to leave, Kelly stopped him with \"No, no.  You can't run from how this feels.  I've tried.  It doesn't work.\"  Kelly exclaimed that John had to be on the next plane to London to get Natalie back.  Kelly pondered that the meeting at Rodi's, which had never taken place, had been very recent.  Kelly speculated that nothing could have happened in a few hours that could have changed things so drastically, to where Natalie would not want John anymore.  Kelly insisted that if John flew to London to retrieve Natalie, it would be \"big.\"\n\n\nReed walked up to Kelly and John and asked if there was a reason for him to be jealous.  John and Kelly yelled out no.  As Kelly, Reed, and Shaun left the airport, Kelly warned, \"Go big.  Okay, John?\"\n\n\nJohn walked up to the ticket station and asked the clerk, \"Are there any more flights to London tonight?\"  The clerk replied, \"No, but I did check the flight manifests for Natalie Banks.\"  John said, \"Yeah.\"  The clerk continued, \"She missed the London flight.  She never showed.\"  John asked, \"You sure?  Thank you.\"  As John left the ticket station and walked down the hall, he saw Natalie.  Natalie gazed at John with both a question and hope in her eyes. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John assumes that Natalie has taken off on the last flight and it's too late for them, after reading her letter and finding out that she loves him. But Kelly encourages him not to give up on her. She assumes that John has made his decision and has dumped her for Marty. She visits Brody who is similarly distraught over losing Jessica. They drink and end up sleeping together. And she concludes that she has to move to London. Jessica is ready to sleep with Ford and let him help her get over both Cristian and Brody. But she somehow senses that it would not be right. She then remembers everything in her life including her daughter, her relationship with Brody and her present. And when Brody least expects it, she comes to see him and admits that she now remembers everything. Rex and Gigi get arrested by Otto in Santa Fe for breaking and entering. He attempts to call Bo to ask him for help but cannot bring himself to admit that he screwed up. He tells Gigi that he is ready to give up on finding his real parents. But she somehow knows that he cannot do that.",
