    "soap_central": "\nHOLD YOUR HORSES!\n\n\nWhen Todd arrived at La Boulaie, he discovered that the locks had been changed. No amount of banging and yelling would open the door. As he tried to get hold of a locksmith, his former henchman Shaun appeared. The bodyguard disclosed that he was newly employed by Blair, who had offered him double his previous salary. He added that she was nicer and easier on the eyes. Todd quickly offered Shaun triple the money but was turned down and Shaun threatened to call the police on his former employer. Blair finally agreed to let Todd into the house to have his say, however, she insisted that Shaun stay in the room with them. Todd voiced his love for Starr and emphasized that he had wanted to protect her. Blair then sent a wordless Starr upstairs to check on her baby brother. Advising Todd that he was on the clock, Blair demanded that he immediately say what he had to so that he could leave. \"What happened to Starr was an accident,\" Todd began. \n\n\nBlair proceeded to rattle off all of his physical attacks on Starr and her friends, reminding him that he had attacked kids. She told him that his actions almost killed three people on the boardwalk, a statement that Blair quickly regretted. Recovering quickly, she told a confused Todd that he would have lost Starr, Cole and Blair herself, if anything had happened to her little girl. She pointed out how, rather than helping Starr after she tumbled down the stairs, he then went after Cole. She confessed that she no longer loved Todd and that there would no longer be any forgiving. Todd thought otherwise, reminding Blair of the many times she had said such things in the past. Blair told him that they were in Dorian's home and that he would not be able to return, that she would not be his wife much longer, and that their kids did not care about him. \n\n\nWith Todd suggesting that they needed protection from Ramsey, Blair thought otherwise. She indicated that Ramsey was after him, not the family, and with him no longer there, that would not be an issue. Blair's final words were to order Todd out, so that she could save her child. She indicated that he had run out of his allotted time and requested that Shaun usher Todd out. Todd announced that he was taking Sam with him. Upstairs, Starr read to Sam and explained to the little boy that he'd be better off without his dad. She wished she still believed in happily ever after. \n\n\nJared was sure that Charlie had to tell Viki the truth right away, before she learned from someone else that Charlie was Jared's real father. Jared also told his dad that he and Natalie were together and that it wasn't right for her to keep his secret any longer. He indicated that they had no choice, as they were being blackmailed, though he refused to reveal the identity of the extortionist. Jared confessed that he was also worried about Renee's reaction, while Charlie realized that he would also have to confess the truth to Rex. Charlie recalled that Viki loved him for revealing his deepest secrets when they first met and he was unsure of how she would feel when she learned about this last one. Jared offered to take full responsibility for the deceit and felt that if Nat had forgiven him, then Viki would be sure to forgive Charlie. Charlie felt that people always forgave their children for doing wrong, but there were higher standards for others. He stressed that he would not start drinking again, no matter what, and that he was extremely proud of Jared. Once Jared was gone, Charlie made a phone call to Viki. \n\n\nAt the gallery, Bo and Lindsay were interrupted by the arrival of the police detail of Antonio, Talia, and Eddie. It was explained that they were waiting for the armored truck to transport the jewels from Mendorra along with the ambassador from that country. Once the jewels arrived, they would take over and move the jewels to their protected glass cases. Once they were situated, a security firm would replace the police. A nervous Lindsay reported that only invited guests would be able to view the jewels. Antonio demonstrated the detectors with Talia, who needed to remove all of her jewelry, belt, gun and holster, in order to get the detector to stop going off. He did something to her gun before handing it back to her. He tried to take her aside on more than one occasion so that he could fill her in on Ramsey's plan, but Eddie positioned himself right alongside them each time. Antonio received a phone call from Ramsey, reminding him to bring Talia down for taking the jewels. Bo and Lindsay left and soon after, the truck arrived. Antonio asked Eddie to wait behind alone but he complained, so they all went off to retrieve the jewels. Upon their return, and quite suddenly, two masked and armed men stormed into the gallery and demanded the jewels. A fracas ensued, and Eddie was pushed and knocked down. Talia pulled her gun and went to shoot but nothing happened. She discovered the clip was missing from her gun. The armed bandits got away and the jewels were gone. Antonio called Lee to report a situation. The police commissioner arrived on the scene and extended his apologies to the ambassador. He told Talia she was fired and to pack her things. \n\n\nNat held her breath as Clint made his way into the stable to saddle up for a quick ride. Surprised to see her, Nat \"confessed\" that she was cleaning out the stall, having picked up a new love of horses while on the ranch in Texas. She declined his offer to go riding as she planned on grooming the horse instead. He apologized for some of the moves he made during the takeover attempts at Buchanan Enterprises, though she told him that she completely understood. She declined his offer to help with the horse. Once he was gone, Nat removed David's gag. David expressed how impressed he was with Nat's lies, though she wasn't happy about having to lie to her dad. She confessed to having to protect Viki, which confused David. Thinking he knew why, David turned to Nat for blackmail money, pointing out that she would have no problems writing him a check. She informed him that Jared was fixing things as they spoke. Tiring of hearing David, she replaced the gag. Jared returned and advised Nat that Charlie would break the news of Jared's true parentage to Viki. \n\n\nAt the house, Nora wondered why R.J. was there to see her and hoped that he had news of Lindsay's false breakdown. Instead, R.J. disclosed that Lindsay had provided Clint with the dirt he used to prevent the takeover of B.E. and that she had retrieved the information from files that had belonged to her former husband, Sam. He just thought that Nora should know. An enraged Nora realized that taking information from a client's files was against the law. When Clint returned, she asked him where he had obtained his information but quickly added that she already knew. He kept it from her because of how she would have felt, he told her. As Nora mentioned Lindsay's name, Bo and Lindsay arrived to talk about the gallery. Clint tried to get Nora to be silent but there was no quieting the district attorney as she immediately inquired about Lindsay's obtaining the information. Clint pointed out that Lindsay had done them all a favor and that all companies had secrets. He saved B.E. and he was not ashamed, he added. He stalked off, followed by Nora. Bo asked Lindsay if it were true and she admitted that it was. She didn't give the information to him because she knew that he would never use it. Bo admitted to being \"blown away\" and asked for time to think. Lindsay ran into Nora outside as she prepared to leave. She asked Nora why she had said anything if she was into Clint and finished with Bo. Nora vehemently sputtered that she wanted Bo to know about the bitch who was coming into contact with their son. Lindsay warned that if things were over with Bo because of this, then Nora would pay.\n\n\n",

He tells them that maybe he can make himself useful to them by keeping the secret from Viki which will break her heart. Jared fesses up to Charlie that he messed up and is responsible for the consequences. RJ reveals to Nora that Lindsay has been helping Clint to get the dirt on his rivals. She then informs Bo, hoping that he will break up with Lindsay.",
