    "soap_central": "\nClinging To Hope\n\n\nAs John drove her away from the crime scene at the KAD fraternity house, Blair insisted that John take her to Todd's home so that she could unite with her children. Remembering the frightful hours that she had shared with T\u00e9a in the basement of the KAD house, Blair inquired about T\u00e9a's condition. John told Blair that he hadn't received an update on T\u00e9a, but he was certain that her condition was critical. Acknowledging that she and T\u00e9a had discovered that they shared a great deal in common, Blair expressed concern for T\u00e9a. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Marty and Todd reunited with their children. Afterward, Todd and Marty told Starr and Cole that they had important information to share with them. Before they could reveal that Hope was alive, Todd received a call from Blair, who related that an injured T\u00e9a had been taken to Llanview Hospital. Todd appeared concerned when Blair alerted him that T\u00e9a's condition was serious. Blair advised Todd that T\u00e9a needed him. \n\n\nAfter reassuring Starr that her mother was fine, Todd announced that he was going to visit T\u00e9a at the hospital. Before he left for the hospital, Todd and Marty decided to tell their children the news about Hope once Todd had returned home. \n\n\nBack inside John's car, Blair thanked John for coming to her rescue. Blair asked John if he wanted to discuss the state of their marriage, but John declined. He stated that they had more pressing matters to contend with. When John told Blair about Powell's claim concerning Hope, Blair didn't believe that her granddaughter was alive, and baulked at the thought of it. \n\n\nWith Chloe in the backseat, Bess drove to an unknown destination. Bess told the child that they were headed to a location where no one would ever find them. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Viki, Clint, and Brody were alarmed when they discovered that Jessica and Chloe were missing. When Brody mentioned that Jessica had appeared confused and had experienced terrible headaches and blackouts, Viki realized that Jessica had learned the truth about Chloe and that Bess had resurfaced in an attempt to protect Jessica. As Brody rushed off to see if Jessica was still on the hospital grounds, Viki and Clint worried that Jessica and Chloe were in serious trouble. Clint placed a call to Jessica. Observing that Clint was the caller, Bess ignored the call. \n\n\nBrody returned and informed Viki and Clint that Jessica's car was no longer in the hospital parking lot. Clint immediately phoned Bo. Realizing that Viki and Clint were withholding information regarding Jessica, Brody demanded to know what had happened. Thanking Brody for supporting his daughter, Clint suggested that Brody leave and allow the family to deal with the crisis. Both Viki and Clint were surprised when Brody declared that he loved Jessica and wanted to help her. Viki explained to Brody that Jessica's alter ego, Bess, had taken control. Viki related that Jessica's baby had died at birth and that Bess had surfaced and switched the dead child with Hope. \n\n\nUpon learning that Bo had issued a police alert for Jessica, Brody was concerned about her state of mind and decided to phone her. As Viki and Clint listened, Brody phoned Jessica. Assuming that Clint was calling again, Bess answered the phone and instructed Clint to leave her alone. Brody announced that he was the caller. The sound of Brody's voice caused Jessica to surface. \n\n\nA confused Jessica, who was still steering the car, begged Brody to tell her what was going on. As Jessica took a look in the rear view mirror, she discovered that she was wearing horn-rimmed glasses. Realizing that Bess had returned, Jessica panicked and asked Brody what terrible thing Bess had done. Brody asked Jessica for her location, but Jessica had no idea where she was. After confirming that Chloe was fine, Brody asked Jessica to pull over to the side of the road. \n\n\nAs Brody continued to ask about Chloe's condition, Jessica had a flashback of the night Tess gave birth to the dead child. Realizing that Brody was unable to get Jessica's exact location, Viki grabbed the phone. When Viki called out to Jessica, Bess warned, \"It's over, let it go Victoria! Don't try and find us!\" Viki advised everyone that Bess was back. \n\n\nAt the Llanview police station, Bo and Fish questioned Kyle about his involvement with Rebecca and Powell. Bo advised Kyle that the police were aware that he had been blackmailing Natalie and Jared about Todd's granddaughter. Bo was certain that Kyle had gone to the Manning residence to blackmail Todd about Hope. When Kyle continued to deny having any knowledge about Todd's grandchild, Bo presented Kyle with evidence that he had retrieved from Kyle's possessions - news articles about Hope's death, and two DNA test results. Kyle was shocked when Bo informed him that Rebecca was dead. Bo accused him of helping her kidnap Hope. Admitting that Rebecca had promised to fix things, Kyle insisted that he hadn't kidnapped Hope. \n\n\nIn the emergency room of Llanview Hospital, as Michael examined a seriously injured T\u00e9a, Todd barged into the room. Todd asked Michael if T\u00e9a might die. Michael informed him that death was a possibility. \n\n\nAlone with an unconscious T\u00e9a, Todd recalled how she had survived after Blair had pushed her out of a window. Todd promised to introduce T\u00e9a to his granddaughter once she awoke. With tears in his eyes, Todd insisted that since God didn't take Hope away from him, that he wouldn't take T\u00e9a away, either. As Michael and his staff returned to take T\u00e9a away, Todd kissed her hand and pleaded, \"Wake up sweetheart!\" \n\n\nBack at Todd's apartment, Starr was delighted to see her mother alive and well. Marty asked for a moment alone with Blair and John. Blair was shocked when Marty confirmed that Chloe was actually their grandchild. Upon learning that Hope was alive, Blair was overcome with joy. At that moment, John received a call from Bo. Alone with Blair and Marty, John told the women that Jessica had run off with Hope. Blair wanted to tell the children, but John advised her that they should keep quiet about everything for the moment. \n\n\nWhen Starr and Cole returned, Blair did her best to hide her concern for Hope. Everyone was stunned when Cole and Starr announced that Hope's body had been exhumed. As they revealed that the child buried in Hope's grave wasn't theirs, Jack rushed into the room and welcomed Blair home. To everyone's surprise, Jack greeted John with a hug and thanked him for bringing his parents back. Later, John watched quietly as Marty and Blair enjoyed time with their children. \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy listened as Rex expressed his concern over losing Shane. Rex felt terrible that his son would no longer be living with him. Stacy did her best to convince Rex that Shane would be fine. Stacy smiled as Rex thanked her for supporting him. When Stacy mentioned that she needed to find an apartment, Rex had no reaction. As Rex was engrossed in his bowl of cereal, Stacy surfed the web and made reference to the high rents that were being charged in the Llanview area. \n\n\nHowever, Stacy wasn't looking for an apartment - the computer screen displayed a jewelry website. Unable to get a reaction from Rex, Stacy stated that she might return to Las Vegas, but she insisted that she was worried that Shane might need another transfusion and that she wouldn't be able to help if she were in another state. Rex offered to allow Stacy to stay at the loft until she found a job and a place of her own. With a devilish smile, Stacy happily accepted Rex's offer. \n\n\nAs Rex left to take a shower, Stacy received a call from Kyle. Kyle informed Stacy that he was in jail and needed her to bail him out. When Stacy hesitated, Kyle threatened to tell Rex the truth about her pretending to donate stem cells to Shane. Later, Stacy removed a large bundle of bills from her bag. She quickly hid the money when Rex entered the room. Stacy smiled as Rex presented her with a key to the loft.\n\n\n \n\n\n",
