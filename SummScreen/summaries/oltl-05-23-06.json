She strengthens her request by asking Hugh to have Margaret's body exhumed. Hugh says that Spencer already signed off on the results of the autopsy which shows that she was murdered. Evangeline reminds him that Spencer has become her number one suspect in framing Todd and that if he doesn't honor her request, an innocent man will die.
