John said he hasn't heard anything yet either, but is bringing Miles into the office to question Miles about his involvement in the case and to listen to the recording of the baby's cry. Miles arrives, frustrated because he has somewhere else to be. John wants to know where Miles is heading. Miles lies, saying he's going to a meeting with an investment group. John tells him he's going to be late and plays him the recording. After listening to the recording, he insists that he knows nothing about Todd's disappearance. Blair and John are suspicious, but they let him go. John intends to follow Miles, and Blair offers to go with, but he convinces her to go home and be with her kids. \n\n\nMarty's car runs out of gas, and a stranger approaches her to ask if she needs help. She says she doesn't need any help. Then two more men approach her car. They threaten her and force her out of the car. Marty maces one of the guys as she struggles to get free, but the other two get a firm grip on her. The thugs decide to take what they want and leave. While they're distracted, Marty breaks out of their grasp and fights them off.\n\n\nMiles drives up to Marty's car a little while later and asks her if she's alright. At that moment, John pulls up. Marty runs and hugs him, much to Miles's chagrin. Marty tells John about the attack on her, and he becomes suspicious that Miles is involved in it because he happened to travel on the same road she was on. Miles gives John a card for the group he was meeting so John can check up on him. He then offers to drive Marty home, but John insists that she come to the station with him to file a report. After they leave, Miles furiously slams Marty's car door shut.\n\n\nAt the station, John compliments Marty on how she fought off her attackers. She then asks him why he's so suspicious of Miles, and he responds that he has a gut feeling about him. He asks her if Miles knew where she was going that night, and she admits that he did, which worries John even more.\n\n\nThe thug leader meets Miles at the site of the attack. Miles pays him more money because the thugs were injured when they were improvising their attack.\n\n\nViki waits for Clint at Asa's mansion, and is informed by Nigel that Clint is out with Dorian. She realizes that Clint might not be back until morning. Nigel offers to call Clint, but she tells him not to worry about it. She was just curious if he had any news about Jessica. Nigel mentions that he and the rest of the staff at the mansion are going to get tested to see if they're a match for Jessica, which touches Viki. Viki astonishes Nigel by blaming herself for Jessica's illness. He also says that they haven't told Asa. Viki thinks that's a good thing because Asa couldn't get tested due to his heart condition. Nigel comforts her telling her that Buchanans can get through anything. She tells him that she intends to get tested no matter what. Viki then says that all she wants to do is to be able to protect her children from all harm, but she hasn't been very good at that. Nigel tells her it's impossible for a mother to keep her children completely safe. He then puts things into perspective for Viki by telling her that Jess needs her mother more than she needs an organ donor. \n\n\nDorian tries to seduce Clint, but he tells her he's not in the mood because he's so worried about Jess. She understands and assures Clint that they'll find a donor for Jessica. Clint mentions that he's also worried that Jessica has too much going on in her personal life as well. Dorian then gives Clint a massage to try to relax him and tells him that he can't carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. They lean in for a kiss as they ease further down the bed. Afterwards Clint thanks Dorian for comforting him. He starts worrying immediately afterwards, though. Dorian tells him it's alright if he leaves, and they kiss before he goes.\n\n\nViki thanks Nigel for the conversation as Clint arrives. Clint asks Viki if she has any news about Jessica, and then tells her about Antonio and Jessica's breakup. Viki's shocked by this news, and is frustrated that they can't seem to do anything to help Jessica out. They both decide to do some research on liver cancer to feel like they're actually doing something and on the chance that they might find out something that will help Jessica.\n\n\nBlair visits Dorian, and Dorian tells her about Jessica. Blair decides to go get tested to see if she's a match, because it's what Todd would want her to do. She wonders how Clint and Viki must be feeling, which makes Dorian worry a little bit.\n\n\nAntonio tells Cristian about Jessica and Nash's tryst and that his and Jessica's relationship is over. Cris says that he already knew about it. Antonio wants to know how Cris found out about it, and then asks why Cris didn't tell him sooner. He says that Jess begged him not to say anything, which prompts Antonio to turn it around and ask how Cris felt about Todd and Evangeline kissing. Cris insists that was completely different. Antonio is furious that he was made to look like a fool, and tells Cris that he was stupid not to say anything about Nash and Jessica.\n\n\nAntonio asks Cris how he would feel if Antonio had known about Todd and Evangeline and not told Cris. Cris admits that he'd be angry, and Antonio tells him that that is just the tip of the iceberg of his emotions. He tells Cris that they're no longer brothers because a brother would have told him the truth, even if it did more harm than good. Antonio says Cris means nothing to him now. Cris tries to explain, but Antonio threatens to punch him. Cris insists that he still loves Antonio. Antonio points out that Jessica did to, and that turned out badly. Antonio leaves Cris frustrated.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica is sad that she hurt Antonio so deeply. Nash tries to comfort her by telling her she did the right thing in telling Antonio the truth about them. That doesn't stop her from feeling bad about it, though. Jessica asks Nash if the confrontation between him and Antonio was horrible. He lies and says it wasn't and he's working through it. Jess is relieved to hear that Antonio was reasonable. Nash asks her if she's having second thoughts about telling Antonio the truth. Jessica assures him that she's fine and that Antonio needed to find out that Nash was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. \n\n\nNash then tells Jessica that things will be easier now that Antonio knows the truth. Jess says that things aren't any easier because she's dying. He insists that they will find a donor for her, she'll get healthy again, and they'll live happily ever after because they've been through too much for them to give up now. Jessica wonders if getting sick is her punishment for breaking Antonio's heart. Nash tells her it's not a punishment. He's as sure of that as he is of how much he loves her. As they kiss each other, Antonio looks through the window to her room, then stomps away.\n\n\n",
