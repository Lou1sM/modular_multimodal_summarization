When Adriana stated that they were husband and wife forever, Rex appeared distracted. Later, Rex noticed that Adriana's mood had changed for the worse. She had discovered Todd's front-page story, in which he referred to her as \"Bridezilla.\" Rex romanced Adriana and her temper subsided. Rex asked Adriana to prepare him some waffles and reminded her that they had received a waffle maker as a wedding gift. Adriana was upset to learn that the gift was from Gigi and Shane, but was determined not to let thoughts of Gigi ruin her mood. \n\n\nWhile preparing breakfast, Adriana discovered a fork (in a plastic bag) tucked away in a drawer. Rex admitted that the fork contained Charlie's DNA and that Rex had considered having it tested to verify that Charlie was actually his father. Adriana encouraged Rex to have the item tested, but Rex argued that he had no reason to doubt Charlie. Rex believed that Charlie was a good man, especially since he was involved with Viki. As a result of Adriana's urging, Rex agreed to consider having the DNA tested. As Rex showered, Adriana noticed his toothbrush lying on the counter. Slyly, Adriana picked up the toothbrush and placed it in a plastic bag. After calling out to Rex and telling him that she needed to purchase an item from the store, Adriana bolted out the door with the plastic bag in hand. After showering, Rex stared intently at the plastic bag containing Charlie's DNA. Several minutes later, Rex threw the bag in the trash. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Charlie tried to tell Viki the truth about Jared, but had a difficult time. Viki was shocked when Charlie told her that he had lied to her about his son. Viki asked Charlie which son he was referring to, Rex or the son he had been searching for. Upon learning that the lie involved Rex, Viki felt that perhaps the information was none of her business and reminded Charlie of how she had kept her identity a secret from him. Charlie assured Viki that the news affected her, and blurted out that Rex wasn't his son. Initially, Viki believed that there had been a mix-up with the DNA testing, but was angered to learn that Roxy and Charlie had told Rex a blatant lie about his paternity. Charlie told Viki that Roxy didn't want to reveal the true identity of Rex's father and asked Charlie to pretend to be his dad since his last name was \"Bolsum.\" He said that he agreed because Roxy was desperate at the time. Viki demanded that Charlie tell Rex the truth immediately and expressed her displeasure with him. Realizing that he had hurt Viki tremendously, Charlie promised to go and tell Rex the truth at once. Charlie begged Viki to stay put and promised to return so he could reveal the rest of his confession. As Charlie headed off to confess the truth to Rex, Viki appeared shattered. \n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi and Shane witnessed Brody awaken from a nightmare as he slept on the couch. Shane told Brody that he understood that he might still have flashbacks from his days in Afghanistan. An excited Shane shared his knowledge of the military and begged Brody to reveal some military tactics to him. Appearing distracted, Brody went upstairs to shower. Alone with his mother, Shane expressed his joy over finding his father. Shane felt as though he was dreaming and stated that his dad was a great guy. As Shane continued to sing his \"dad's\" praises, Gigi discovered a liquor bottle hidden beneath a sofa pillow. Gigi kept the bottle out of Shane's sight. \n\n\nAfter showering, Brody attempted to head downstairs, but stopped when he overheard Shane and Gigi discussing him. Sensing his mother still had thoughts of Rex on her mind, Shane asked his mother if she believed she would ever love Brody the same way she loved Rex. Gigi apologized to Shane about the wedding fiasco and told her son that she didn't have the answer to his question. Brody stood on the staircase and continued to listen unnoticed. Shane told Gigi that there was no reason for an apology, and reminded her that he had encouraged her to tell Rex what was on her mind. A knock on the door interrupted the mother and son discussion. \n\n\nGigi was hardly pleased to open the door and find Adriana standing there. Holding the plastic bag containing Rex's toothbrush, Adriana informed Gigi that she had a proposition for her and brushed past Gigi. Before Adriana could speak, she was attacked by little Shane. Flying down the stairs, Shane yelled, \"Uglyana\" and sprayed her with a can of soda. Gigi admonished the child and sent him upstairs. After composing herself and referring to the child as a brat, Adriana informed Gigi of her plan. Adriana stated that she knew Rex was Shane's father, and suggested that Gigi pass Rex's DNA off as Brody's to prevent the truth from ever coming out. When Gigi refused, Adriana told Gigi that Shane would be devastated to find out his mother had lied to him for so long. Believing Dorian had told Adriana about Shane's paternity, Gigi informed Adriana that Dorian had encouraged her to interrupt the wedding with her revelation. Adriana refused to believe Gigi's claims concerning her mother and continued to harass Gigi. As Adriana persisted, Brody appeared. He picked Adriana up and threw her out of the house. Humiliated, Adriana begged Gigi to reconsider and tossed the bag (containing the toothbrush) through the opened door. Gigi responded by throwing the bag at Adriana and slamming the door. \n\n\nAfter kicking Adriana out of the house, Brody straightened the sofa he had slept on and appeared to be looking for something. Gigi presented the empty liquor bottle and asked Brody if he was looking for it. Brody stated that he sometimes drank to fall asleep. Gigi thanked Brody for his help with Adriana. She said that it reminded her of the guy she knew in Michigan-a guy who didn't drink. Brody stated sadly, \"People change,\" and walked away. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, A curious Marcie wandered around wondering who had sent her a text message requesting to meet her there. To her surprise, Michael appeared with wine and flowers and wished his wife a happy second anniversary. Marcie apologized for the chain of events that had occurred in the past several months, but Michael was only concerned with giving their marriage another chance. Michael thanked Marcie for changing his life several years ago. As they sipped wine, Michael and Marcie reminisced about the first time they met and expressed the love that they still shared for each other. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair told Todd that she was kicking him out of the house. Todd refused to leave the house without Sam. Attempting to reason with Todd, Blair stated that it would be terrible for Todd to separate Sam from his brother and sister. A bitter Todd exclaimed that they would not be separated for long. As Blair and Todd argued, Dorian returned home with Jack and inquired about Starr. Jack was thrilled to find his dad at home. In an attempt to undermine Blair, Todd told Jack that he would take him out for the day. When Blair refused to allow Jack to go with Todd, Jack complained. While Blair and Dorian spoke in the foyer, Todd called Jack into the living room with him. \n\n\nDorian was delighted when Blair informed her that she was kicking Todd out of the house. Blair was upset that Todd refused to leave without Sam. Blair stated that she loved Sam and didn't want to separate him from Starr and Jack. Dorian reminded Blair that Starr and Jack were her children, and that she should concern herself with their needs. When Dorian mentioned that Starr was troubled, Blair told Dorian that she was aware of Starr's pregnancy. Blair related how Todd had pushed Starr down a flight of stairs and warned Dorian that Todd could not learn that Starr was pregnant. With Blair following close behind, Dorian headed off to evict Todd. Sensing the tension between his parents, Jack asked them why they were arguing. Todd told Jack that he wanted to be with him more than anything, but said he couldn't because Blair was throwing him out of the house. As Jack pleaded with his mother to reconsider, Starr entered the room and told Jack that Todd had to leave because he had hurt her. Starr said that no one in the family would be safe with Todd around. Refusing to believe his sister's claims about their father, Jack threw a tantrum. Todd asked Starr for a moment alone with her, but she declined his offer. Realizing that Blair and Starr couldn't be swayed, Todd demanded that he be allowed to take Sam with him. When Blair asked Starr to bring Sam downstairs, Starr begged her mother to reconsider. As Blair and Starr held Sam and said a tearful goodbye to him, Todd yanked the child from their arms and rushed out the door. \n\n\nHeartbroken, Viki sat on the patio and thought about the man she thought she knew. \n\n\nWhen Rex opened the door and saw Charlie, he happily said, \"Hi, Dad!\" Rex began to ramble and told Charlie, \"It felt right to call you dad. But what does it matter what I call you? I know who you are.\" In a solemn voice, Charlie said, \"No, Rex. You don't.\" \n\n\nDorian attempted to comfort Blair, who agonized over what Starr would do once Todd discovered that she was pregnant. Unnoticed, a saddened Starr listened. \n\n\nMichael and Marcie continued to enjoy their romantic evening at Angel Square. \n\n\nWith Sam sitting in the front seat without a child safety seat, Todd drove and discussed his next move. He picked up the phone to call Viki and tell her what had happened. \n\n\nAn angered Adriana drove along the same road, muttering to herself. She said that Gigi, Shane, Brody, and Dorian could all go to hell. She expressed the desire to murder them all. As she continued to rant, her cell phone rang. Adriana looked away from the road and reached for her phone. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Sam began to play with the door lock, and Todd took his eyes off the road to stop him. When Todd looked up, he swerved to avoid a car. At that very moment, Adriana looked up and froze when she saw headlights. As Michael and Marcie continued to enjoy their romantic evening at Angel Square, they heard a crash and ran to the scene.\n\n  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair and Dorian tell Todd he is out of their house. Starr backs them. Only Jack is upset. He takes Sam with him and tells them if he is out of their lives, so is Sam. Adriana is still finagling a way to prevent Rex from finding his way back to Gigi. She finds Rex's toothbrush, assuming that his DNA will match that of Shane's. She goes to Gigi's home and tells her she has a way to \"pass Brody off\" as Shane's father. Meanwhile, Rex admits that he has doubts about whether Charlie is really his father and he's afraid to confirm it with DNA. Charlie then reveals to Viki that he knew all along that Rex was not his son but he lied to him. She is furious with him for doing that. While Todd is driving away with Sam, distracted and Adriana is driving, furious with Gigi and distracted, it looks like they have a collision. Marcie and Michael are together renewing their vows. And they can hear the collision very close by.",
