Dani gave Todd a kiss and advised him that while she was happy to see that he'd made amends with Tomas, Todd was still a \"pain in the butt.\" Shaun was suspicious of Todd's clearing of Tomas in the shooting, and he wondered whether Todd was \"mistaken about being mistaken.\"\n\n\nTodd stressed that Tomas was innocent, but Shaun wasn't buying it. There was a lot that they didn't know about Tomas, and Shaun mentioned the exceptional martial arts moves that Tomas had used on Shaun in an earlier encounter. Todd wanted Shaun to just forget about it, because Tomas hadn't done anything wrong. \"Whatever you say,\" Shaun replied.\n\n\nTodd went off to take a shower, and Shaun confronted Dani. He asked who the girl was that Matthew was having sex with. Dani choked on her drink, and advised him that she didn't know. Shaun advised her that Matthew, as well as the rest of the group, were too young, and he was only glad that it wasn't Destiny. He believed that Destiny still \"has something for Matthew.\" Todd returned and ranted that he had seen Tomas' belongings upstairs.\n\n\n\"So much for you and Uncle Tomas getting past your animosity,\" Dani said dryly. \"Yeah, what she said,\" Shaun added. He couldn't help but noticing that Todd wasn't as \"cool\" with Tomas as he had claimed. Todd apologized, and he chalked it up to having been in a coma. He reminded the pair that Tomas had tried to get T\u00e9a to leave Todd, and Todd had tried to get Tomas deported. Dani noted that her uncle was from New York. In order to release his anger, Todd looked at Shaun and fired him.\n\n\nShaun declared that T\u00e9a had been the one to hire him, and she was the only person who could fire him. He pointed out that if Todd had cleared Tomas, then the shooter was still around somewhere. Todd insisted that he would be dead if that had been what the shooter had planned, but Shaun could stay on for Dani.\n\n\nAt the jail, T\u00e9a informed Tomas that she didn't necessarily believe that he was innocent, however it was her job to defend her clients. T\u00e9a confessed that she actually had no idea what to think, especially after Todd had changed his story. Tomas suggested that Todd had wanted to \"do the right thing,\" but T\u00e9a chuckled sarcastically. There was no way that Todd would think of doing something like that, she said. Tomas advised her that it was possible that Todd had changed more than T\u00e9a might be aware of.\n\n\nUpstairs in Bo's office, Nora couldn't get over the fact that Clint had confessed to killing Eddie Ford. While he hadn't actually done it, Nora felt that Clint was to blame for so much else leading up to the murder, that it was okay with her if he took the blame. Bo wondered if Matthew would be able to live with Clint's admission of guilt. Nora suggested that Matthew would learn to live with it, but Bo thought that Matthew might want to own up to the crime. Nora gave him a resounding thumbs-down on that idea.\n\n\nTomas and T\u00e9a walked into Bo's office, and T\u00e9a pointed to Todd's new statement that was in Bo's possession. T\u00e9a wanted the charges against Tomas to be dropped, she announced. \"Like hell,\" Bo retorted. He reminded T\u00e9a that they still had evidence, such as the syringe found in Todd's hospital room with Tomas' fingerprints, and the encrypted CIA file on Tomas. T\u00e9a advised him that none of the evidence was related to the shooting charge, and the evidence of the Euro found at the scene was circumstantial.\n\n\nReluctantly, Nora had to agree with T\u00e9a and agreed to drop the charges. \"This case is still open,\" Bo proclaimed, and if any evidence were discovered in the future, the shooter would be arrested and put behind bars. \"I wish you well,\" Tomas told the commissioner. Bo continued that it was his town, and he didn't like problems there. Tomas stated he felt the same way, because he lived there too. T\u00e9a and Tomas left. Nora understood how T\u00e9a felt as she represented her own brother. Bo believed that Tomas knew far more than what he was letting on, and Bo hated to let anyone get away with a crime.\n\n\nAs Matthew held ice to his throbbing head, an excited Destiny paid him a visit. With Clint confessing to the crime, Matthew no longer had to confess that he was the killer, and no one would have to know, Destiny exclaimed. She even thought it possible that Eddie had been alive when Matthew had left him, and Clint had been the one to \"finish him off,\" she said. Matthew doubted that scenario, and he added that other people were already aware that Matthew had killed Eddie.\n\n\nDestiny stressed that Matthew's parents didn't want Matthew in jail, and she knew that Dani would never say anything. Matthew couldn't believe that Dani was aware of the truth, and Destiny had to explain that Dani had been around when Destiny had been talking to Blanca Morales about the story that Blanca had promised to report about Matthew's crime. Suddenly, Matthew grabbed his head; he was in a lot of pain.\n\n\nDestiny offered to search for something for Matthew to take for the headache, and she returned with some pills and a glass of water. She was certain the pain would go away, because Matthew wouldn't be going to prison. Matthew revealed that he had something to tell her, but Destiny wouldn't give him the chance to talk. She wanted Matthew to be able to tell her anything, because \"hooking up\" had bonded them. She would keep his secret, because Clint had given Matthew a gift. She warned Matthew not to do anything stupid.\n\n\nMatthew kept trying to talk, but Destiny rattled on non-stop. Finally, she said goodbye. She was off to locate Dani, to make certain that their friend didn't talk.\n\n\nNate arrived home to Deanna, who was eager to give him some news. She'd been watching television and had seen Clint as he confessed to killing Nate's father. Nate informed her that he knew who the real murderer was, because he'd overheard Dani and Destiny talking about it. Matthew was the one who had killed Eddie, and Nate had even confronted Matthew, who had admitted the wrongdoing. Nate couldn't believe that Matthew's uncle was taking the blame for it.\n\n\nNate added that he'd \"decked\" Matthew, though Deanna was confused as to why Matthew would want to kill Eddie. Nate enlightened Deanna about the \"bad stuff\" that Matthew believed Eddie had done to Nora, though Deanna reminded him that Eddie had done awful things to Deanna also. Nate admitted that his father had been \"scum,\" but Nate had been arrested for Eddie's murder, and Matthew had never said anything.\n\n\nAfter Nate had been let go, Nate continued, Nate's mother had been arrested, and still, Matthew had stood by silently. He wanted Matthew to pay, and he wanted to turn Matthew in. Nate needed to talk to Dani.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Aubrey told Joey that she wanted to \"come clean.\" \"Come clean about what?\" Joey asked his wife. Aubrey began to tell him that the police still hadn't located Wes, but she stopped herself. That wasn't really what she'd wanted to say, Aubrey admitted. She loved Joey, she started, but Joey interrupted her. Aubrey had humiliated him from the time they'd first met, and she was a \"lying, scheming, gold-digging bitch,\" he shouted.\n\n\nJoey knew all about the fact that Cutter and Aubrey had been searching for an \"easy mark,\" and he had \"taken the bait.\" He was aware that the couple had switched the video. Aubrey kept trying to interrupt in order to explain, but Joey wanted no part of her explanation. He asked if he had the story incorrect, but Aubrey admitted it was all true. That's what she had wanted to discuss. \"How convenient,\" Joey said sarcastically.\n\n\nAubrey began to sob, and she told him that things had been different, and their time together had meant a lot to her. It had changed her, she swore. \"You made a fool out of me,\" Joey accused. He had fallen in love with Aubrey and had married her, while she had continued to sleep with Cutter. Clint had been aware of everything, and Joey had treated Kelly poorly when she'd tried to tell Joey the truth, Joey continued to shout. After all of that, Cutter had married Tess, because he and Aubrey still had to find a way to get to the Buchanan money, Joey added.\n\n\nAubrey denied the charge and insisted that Cutter had been trying to get back at Aubrey, because she loved Joey, and Joey loved Aubrey. Joey clarified that he had loved Aubrey when he thought he had known who she was. Aubrey begged him to believe that she didn't want anything from him as she had in the past, and she really loved him. \"Don't touch me,\" Joey yelled as Aubrey tried to hug him.\n\n\nJoey ordered Aubrey to leave the house. He planned on filing for divorce on the grounds of adultery and fraud, and he planned on begging Kelly to take him back. He removed his wedding band.\n\n\nJohn stopped to see Kelly at the hospital, and he was thrilled to see that she was doing well. He refused to accept her thanks for saving her, and he revealed that the police were still looking for Marty. He wanted Kelly's help, and he wondered if there were anything that Kelly might remember about her stabbing. Kelly noted that Marty had already been at John's place when she'd arrived. Marty had made it known that John belonged to her, and she had proclaimed that she knew more about John than anyone else. Marty had been \"clearly unbalanced,\" Kelly noted, and she'd been afraid that Marty would go after Natalie.\n\n\nKelly noticed the strange look on John's face, and he was forced to tell her what had happened to Natalie. He concluded with the fact that Marty had kidnapped Liam. Kelly was sure that nothing would happen to Liam, but she also noticed that John still cared about the little boy. John made it clear that he was a cop, but Kelly thought it was more personal than that. John maintained that it was personal due to the fact that both women in his life had been attacked, and the baby had been taken from his apartment.\n\n\nKelly revealed that Joey had visited with her, and he had apologized about Aubrey while never leaving Kelly's side. John was happy to hear it. Kelly contended that John had \"seen things clearly, too,\" since the entire incident with Marty had occurred. Kelly thought that she and John could be honest with each other, because they'd had their relationship together.\n\n\nKelly thought that she and John had turned to each other when she'd had issues with Joey, and John had his falling out with Natalie. Kelly believed that each of them had never gotten over the others. John presumed that Kelly and Joey would be getting back together. Kelly wasn't certain, and she reminded John that Joey was still married. John reiterated that he just wanted Kelly to be happy.\n\n\nKelly believed that all of the people praying for her had saved her. \"Love and good will make miracles,\" she said. She hoped that Liam would be returned to John. \"I hope you find what you're looking for, John,\" Kelly said as John prepared to leave. \"You too,\" John replied.\n\n\nThe man who looked like Todd Manning, pre-plastic surgery, advised Agent Baker that he had forgotten anything that he'd known after being unconscious for eight years. \"You took it. We know that. We need it back,\" Baker replied. The old Todd look-alike insisted that he had no clue as to what Baker was talking about, but the agent was persistent. He wondered if the man had given it to John McBain, and he wondered if that were the reason that the detective had been asking about the encrypted file.\n\n\nThe man with the scar maintained that he knew nothing about a file, and he hadn't given anything to anyone. Agent Baker held up a photograph of Tomas. \"Is it him?\" Baker asked. The man repeated that he didn't give \"it\" to the man in the photo, and he didn't know what \"it\" was. He grew angry. Agent Baker declared that in that case, there was no reason for the man to remain alive.\n\n\nT\u00e9a returned home with Tomas. She announced that the charges against Tomas had been dropped, due to Todd's change in story. The guys greeted each other like old buddies. Dani left to find Nate. \"Give me a break,\" T\u00e9a griped. \"What the hell is going on?\" she asked. Todd claimed that he and Tomas were being civil, but T\u00e9a maintained that she was being \"played like a fool.\" She ordered Tomas to move out. She would help him pack. She didn't want to see his friendship with Todd turn to hatred.\n\n\nT\u00e9a received a phone call and excused herself. She returned shortly and announced that she had to see Clint. She said goodbye to Tomas and welcomed Todd home with a kiss. After T\u00e9a was gone, Tomas turned to Todd. He ordered Todd to convince T\u00e9a to allow Tomas to stay. Todd knew why, Tomas said threateningly. Furthermore, he wanted Todd to be a \"gracious host.\" Todd pulled out a gun and pointed it at Tomas. \"Or I could just kill you,\" Todd said coolly.\n\n\nJoey began to pack some things up, but Aubrey had some news for him. They couldn't split up or it would affect Ryder. The baby would be turned over to foster care if they didn't show the happy marriage that they'd claimed they'd had in court. Joey accused Aubrey of threatening him, but Aubrey declared that she wanted another chance. Joey announced that he had changed the codes for all of his accounts, but Aubrey insisted that she didn't want to stay with him for the money. She wanted to prove that she loved him, and she wanted him to give her a chance for Ryder.\n\n\nDani and Destiny ran into each other outside of Nate's apartment. Dani announced that she was able to keep secrets and hadn't told anyone about Matthew. Destiny revealed that Clint had confessed to the crime. Dani was confused about what she should do, but Destiny implored her friend to keep her mouth shut, because lives would be ruined.\n\n\nNate emerged from his apartment and found Destiny and Dani standing there. He invited the girls in, and Deanna introduced herself to Destiny. \"I know who you are,\" Destiny said as she ignored Deanna's outstretched hand. Nate announced that Clint had confessed to shooting Eddie, and Dani revealed that Destiny had given her the news. \"I guess that's it. Clint killed your dad,\" Dani advised her boyfriend. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" Nate said gruffly as he turned to look at Deanna.\n\n\nBo and Nora returned home. Matthew advised them that he had heard about Clint. Bo declared that Clint loved Matthew, and he didn't want to see his nephew's life ruined. Matthew didn't want his uncle to be in jail for life. Bo revealed that Clint was dying and wanted to make amends. Matthew was insistent. Clint hadn't killed Eddie, and he wouldn't allow his uncle to take the heat for it. Besides, someone else knew about it, Matthew added. He grabbed his head and fell to the floor.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Joey returns to Aubrey declaring that he finally sees the light, knows that she and Cutter were scamming him and he's done with her. But she admits she truly loves him and wants him to give her a chance. He tells her he is going to divorce her and throw her out. But she reminds him if he does that, Social Services will take Ryder away from them. Destiny and Dani are still unaware that Nate overheard their conversation about knowing that Matthew killed Eddie. Destiny goes to see Matthew and he attempts to tell her that Nate knows but does not have a chance. She believes that Matthew is in the clear since Clint has confessed and urges Dani not to tell Nate. Matthew attempts to tell his parents that somebody besides them and Clint and Destiny knows who is not going to keep the secret for him. But before he can tell them, he falls over after having a terrible headache from when Nate assaulted him. Tea knows that Todd and Tomas are keeping a secret, as does Shaun. We then see the original Todd alone in a private hospital. A guy somehow knows that his \"mind\" has been given to somebody else but does not know who it could be. And nobody else knows that the original Todd played by Roger Howarth is still alive.",
