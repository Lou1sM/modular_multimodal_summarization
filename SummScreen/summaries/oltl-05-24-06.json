Clint admits that he thinks Todd is guilty and he and Viki argue over the death penalty. Dorian stops by, declaring that she wants to pay her respects. Claiming to be horrified by all of the reporters camped out in the front of the house, she exclaims how she had to put them all in their place by telling them to leave the family to grieve in peace. This irritates Viki, who recalls Dorian's rude comments in the church and ventures that she is aiming to get into Clint's bed by her fake pronouncement of sympathy. It's the beginnings of a catfight until Clint intercedes. Viki then invites the press inside and announces that Todd is innocent; she is against the death penalty and will be joining the protesters at the prison. She invites them all along. Clint declines the invitation to go along, citing the need to look for Kevin if he doesn't appear soon. He raves about Viki after she leaves, much to Dorian's dismay and mentions how he is concerned about her. He also laments not knowing Duke better than he did or spending more time with him. Dorian gives him some comfort.\n\n\nSpencer pays a visit to the prison as Todd is getting ready to choose his last meal. He advises Manning that Blair and the kids will be well taken care of. Todd mentions that he doesn't believe the execution will happen as the bodies of Margaret and the baby are about to be exhumed and he will get the evidence against Spencer that he needs. Spencer appears to be nonchalant but even Todd can sense his nervousness. He'll return the favor when Spencer is the one on death row, he continues. Spencer joyfully mentions how much he's had to comfort Blair during the night.\n\n\nAs Starr leafs through a photo album, she accuses Blair of wanting her to forget that her father ever existed. Blair denies it and also states that she doesn't want Todd to die. Starr insists that he's not lying but Blair will figure it all out when it's too late and Todd is dead. She accuses her of being weak. After mulling it over, Blair declares that she and the children will visit Todd to say their good-byes. Jack really doesn't want to go and when Spencer shows up, he announces that he prefers to stay behind with the doctor. Spencer voices his unasked for opinion that it's a bad idea to visit the prison; Blair retorts that it's really none of his business. When Jack puts the television on and spots his Aunt Viki making her speech, Spencer promptly turns it off, citing it as garbage. Blair takes off with the kids. Spencer refuses to lose Blair now.\n\n\nCris drives Evangeline to Harrisburg to meet with the governor. She wants to request that Margaret's body and that of the baby be exhumed. He will take it under consideration but it doesn't look good. Todd calls for the news and she tells him it's not what he wants to hear. She wonders if she can get Spencer to confess.\n\n\nNatalie is understandably frantic when she is unable to use the phone due to the monsoon. People at home need to know that Margaret is alive. David mentions that she either has amnesia or was brainwashed because she doesn't remember anything. John locates Margaret and after some difficulty and resistance on her part, manages to get her back to the hotel. He figures they have less than 24 hours to save Todd. He and Nat make repeated attempts on their phones; there is no other form of communications that is in working order. He finally gets through to the prison on his last try to tries to reach the warden. \n\n\nBlair arrives with the kids in tow to visit with Todd. He yells at her to get out as he remembers Spencer's taunting words about his comfort of her. The guard won't allow her back in, citing the fact that Todd still has some rights and he'd prefer to visit with his kids only. As she begs to be let back in, the phone rings. The guard cites that the caller has the wrong department. It's John and he pleads with the guard not to hang up. He states that the dead woman is still alive.\n\n\n",
