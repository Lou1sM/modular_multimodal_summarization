Before Matthew could plead his case, he suddenly fell to the floor, losing consciousness. Unable to awaken him, Bo gently picked his son up to take him to the hospital, unwilling to wait for an ambulance to arrive.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Blair practiced singing the theme song from One Life to Live, but she stopped short. \"This is too sad,\" she declared. Starr arrived to chat with her mom about Todd's changed story regarding Tomas. Blair admitted that she was confused, and Starr thought it was all weird. Blair still felt that something \"wasn't quite right\" with Tomas.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Tomas ordered Todd to allow him to stay with the Mannings, but Todd pulled a gun and threatened to shoot Tomas instead. Tomas reminded Todd of their understanding, but Todd felt that if he shot Tomas, their secret would be safe. Tomas assured Todd that Todd's own life would be destroyed, because Tomas' backup plan would go into effect. Everything he knew would go to T\u00e9a, Tomas added. \"You know what will happen,\" Tomas threatened.\n\n\nTodd felt fairly certain that Tomas had no plan, but Tomas handed him a CD. As the men conversed, someone was watching them through the window. Todd slipped the disc into his laptop and looked over the file. He agreed that they could both be hurt. Tomas stressed that the information should remain hidden.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Ford encountered one of the nurses when he was dressed in his hotdog costume to entertain the children. Emma thought that Ford was great with the kids, but she noted that most people who helped out with the children had suffered through the loss of a child. Ford admitted that while he had lost his son, it had been through a custody battle. Emma wanted to buy Ford a drink to thank him for his help with the children, and the couple agreed to meet up at Capricorn.\n\n\nViki visited with Clint in his hospital room and advised him that there was still no word on Marty and Liam. She had seen Clint on television as he had confessed to several transgressions. She was aware that several of the declarations of guilt that he had made were true, but she couldn't believe that he had confessed to killing Eddie Ford. She didn't believe that Clint was capable of murder. \"Well think again,\" Clint replied. Viki demanded that Clint look her in the eye, and tell her it was true. \"Did you kill Eddie Ford?\" Viki asked.\n\n\nJust then, T\u00e9a walked into the room. Viki mentioned the complaint against Tomas that Todd had dropped, and T\u00e9a acknowledged that she was glad that her brother was free. T\u00e9a wondered why Clint had called her, as he had already confessed his guilt to all of his misdeeds. Clint agreed that he had taken responsibility for all of them, but he wanted T\u00e9a to save Jessica, whose husband wanted money from Clint.\n\n\nClint was hopeful that Cutter and Jessica were not legally wed, and he wanted T\u00e9a to check out the documents that Cutter had given him. Viki was hopeful that the marriage wasn't legal, so that she and Clint would be able to have Jessica committed for some help. T\u00e9a left with the documents. Viki was aware that Clint wanted to see that Jessica was all right. Clint agreed that he needed to know that before he died. He had to make things up to his daughter.\n\n\nA doctor looked Matt over in the emergency ward and announced that she would have to run some tests. She did notice that there was a bump on the back of Matthew's head. Later, after the various tests had been completed, Matthew awakened. He didn't remember hitting his head when his mother asked him about it. Instead, he apologized for riding in the car with Cole and hurting his legs. He cried that he wanted to walk again. His speech was slurred.\n\n\nBo ran to get the doctor, as Nora reassured her son. The doctor arrived and revealed that Matthew's symptoms were indicative of a serious brain injury, and he had suffered a head trauma within the past day or two. Bo asked whether Matthew would be okay. The doctor explained that it was a \"grave\" situation, and they couldn't waste any time. Matthew needed surgery.\n\n\nAs Brody dragged Tess into the police station in cuffs, Tess complained loudly that she hadn't been given time to fix her makeup. She insisted that she had no idea where Marty might have taken Liam. Cutter arrived with Tess's makeup and change of clothes, and he ordered Brody to get away from Tess. Cutter announced that he had called his attorney, and he assured Tess that he had \"big plans\" for the two of them. The lawyer arrived and advised Brody to release Tess, as the real witness, Wes, had disappeared.\n\n\nBrody argued that he was able to hold a potential witness for 48 hours, and he threatened to lock up Cutter as well. Tess pleaded that she would do anything to avoid spending time in prison, and Brody suggested that Tess allow Wes to emerge. Brody was positive that he could get through to Wes, because they were old friends. He promised to release Tess if she agreed to it. Cutter tried to dissuade Tess from going along with Brody's proposal, and he promised Tess that he would take her away once they got some money.\n\n\nTess didn't like the idea of Cutter telling her what to do, so she agreed to help Brody out, rather than run the risk of sitting in a jail cell. As Brody unlocked the handcuffs, he begged Wes to show up. All of the men were taken by surprise when Bess put in an appearance instead. Brody again asked for Wes to show up, but Bess explained that Wes was being faithful to Marty. She only knew one thing about the kidnapping, and that was Todd Manning, Bess said.\n\n\nCutter asked for his wife to reappear, and Brody pleaded that Jessica be the one to show up. Bess advised Brody that Jessica was still too upset with Brody, and she wouldn't be able to return. \"Let Jessica be happy again,\" Brody begged. He thought that Jessica's kids deserved it. Cutter was ecstatic when Tess reappeared. The lawyer reminded Brody to release Tess. Brody vowed to get Jessica back.\n\n\nCutter advised Tess that he had her makeup, and he wanted Tess to get ready while he went off to \"seal the deal\" to get their money. He suggested that she meet him at Capricorn. Tess reminded him that she wanted to say goodbye to Llanview after that. Cutter added that she could also say goodbye to everyone who might be able to take them down, including Ford. Tess looked thoughtful after Cutter left.\n\n\nAt the undisclosed location, Agent Baker advised the Todd look-alike that there was no sense in keeping him alive if he was unwilling to give the agent the information the agent was looking for. He had a large hypodermic needle, and if he gave the man a shot, the man would be dead within 30 seconds, Baker proclaimed. \"Go ahead. Kill me,\" the man said. The man reminded Baker that there would be no information at all if Baker went ahead with his threat.\n\n\n\"You know where it is,\" Baker replied. \"Maybe I do,\" the man retorted. He wanted assurance that nothing would happen to him if he told the truth. He wanted the agent's promise that he wouldn't be killed. Baker agreed, but the man chuckled. He wasn't convinced. \"Fine, don't tell me. Your funeral,\" Baker growled. The man was doubtful that the agent would kill him, if there might be some information that the man had.\n\n\nBaker explained that the man's chair was wired to a switch outside the door. There was a high amount of voltage that would hit the man, and the man would beg to be killed. \"It's your choice. Where is it?\" Baker asked again. As he was met with silence, Baker walked outside and hit the switch. Back inside of the room, the man began to scream.\n\n\nStarr reminded Blair of the time Starr first met James, and how things weren't right with him either. Granted, things still weren't right, Starr admitted, but she was thrilled to be with James. She wanted her mother to be happy, and she wondered if Blair would try again with Tomas. Blair looked over at Ford when he arrived and decided Ford missed Tess.\n\n\nGetting back to her conversation with Starr, Blair admitted that she didn't want another situation like she'd had with Eli. Starr was certain that her mother had learned something from that experience and wouldn't make the same mistakes. She thought that Blair had been \"practically glowing\" when she'd been waiting for Tomas on their first date.\n\n\nFord met Emma at Capricorn, and the two settled down at a table. Ford told her about the sad state of his marriage, and Emma advised him that he wasn't doing a good job of selling himself to her. Ford agreed that he had never treated women properly in the past, but he had been trying to change. Emma realized that Ford didn't remember meeting her at another time, and Ford was astonished to learn they'd met.\n\n\nEmma had been on duty when Ford was a patient, and he'd hit on her when she'd given him a sponge bath, she recalled. She agreed that Ford seemed like a different man from the one he had been at that time, and Ford admitted that a lot had happened since then. He confessed that he hadn't been with a woman in a very long time, and that was when his son had been conceived. Emma wondered if he cared about the woman.\n\n\nT\u00e9a returned to the hospital with the documents a short time later. They were legal, and Clint was upset. He had wanted Jessica to live \"happily ever after\" with Brody, and Clint had only made things worse. T\u00e9a suggested that Clint hire her for his own case, and she'd see to it that he received a lighter sentence, so he wouldn't have to spend the rest of his life in prison. Clint promised to think about it. T\u00e9a wanted to get home to see what Todd and Tomas were up to.\n\n\nAgain, Viki asked Clint if he had killed Eddie Ford. Clint wondered why he would have said such a thing, if he hadn't done it. Viki advised him that wasn't an answer. He didn't understand why Viki wouldn't just believe him. He had wanted to prevent Eddie from blackmailing him and from talking about what Clint had done to hire Eddie. Just then, Cutter arrived with a big grin on his face. He was willing to put Tess into St. Ann's as soon as they agreed on the money.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived home and found Todd holding his gun on Tomas. She demanded that they tell her what was going on, because it was obvious that they were up to something. Todd claimed that he had been showing Tomas something. He had decided that Tomas should stay and live with them, in order to provide extra security with the shooter still lurking around. T\u00e9a wasn't buying it, and she advised them that she wanted the truth. Tomas announced that he was going out.\n\n\nT\u00e9a ordered her husband to tell her the truth, but they were interrupted when someone knocked at the door. It was Brody, and he had a new suspect in Liam's kidnapping. It was Todd.\n\n\nFord preferred not to talk about his past any longer, and Emma agreed that he had paid his dues. Ford missed his son, and he wished that his old self was there enjoying the drink with Emma.\n\n\nBlair looked over at Ford again and remarked that it looked as though he was \"back in the game.\" Starr received a phone call from James, and Starr decided to leave to see him.\n\n\nTess walked into Capricorn just as Emma leaned over to kiss Ford. Tomas arrived, and he and Blair shared tentative smiles.\n\n\nBo advised his son that he needed to have an operation. Matthew declared that he only wanted to walk again. Shortly after, Matthew was wheeled to surgery. He promised he'd be okay, and Nora told him how much they loved him. \"I'll see you on the other side,\" Matthew declared. Bo and Nora consoled each other sorrowfully.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew passes out and gets rushed to the hospital before he has a chance to tell his parents that Nate knows he killed Eddie. After he comes to, he appears to be reliving riding in Cole Thornhart's car and becoming paralyzed after the accident. Bo and Nora assume that he will be ok. But the doctor tells them that Matthew has a fatal condition and they need to perform emergency surgery. Todd and Tomas are alone in the house, each threatening the other. While we see \"original Todd\" is an institution admitting that he might know who he gave his brain and personality to but knowing that nobody will kill him if he does not. Robert Ford goes to Capricorn with a nurse from the hospital who seems to like him and remembers when he was a nasty person and womanizer and remarks how she sees that he has changed. Jessica becomes Bess after a brief time of Tess replacing Wes. Brody urges Jessica to come back while Cutter urges Tess to come back. And Tess is ready to meet Cutter later at Capricorn after he tells her he has some things to take of that he won't tell her about. He goes to see Viki and Clint after Clint has found out that he has no legal grounds to invalidate his daughter's marriage to Cutter. Cutter tells Clint that he will get Tess committed and do what Clint wants for a price.",
