Kelly replies that she misses Duke, and states that he was her best friend (in a wistful tone as if she was just realizing it).  She also says she feels responsible for his death-but she wasn't in love.  Adriana tells Kelly that if Duke had been faced with the choice: his life or Kelly's, he would have picked her, just like Kevin did.\n\n\nKevin talks to flowers left where Duke will soon be buried.  He tells his son of all his regrets, including not being there for his childhood.  As Clint looks on, he also confesses that he cannot rid himself of the rage he felt when discovering that his son slept with his fianc\u00e9e.\n\n\nBlair finds out that Spencer visited Todd on his own, but doesn't push to find out exactly what he said.  Spencer convinced her that he simply wanted to assure Todd that she, Starr, and Jack would be well taken care of.  She is furious-but not nearly as much as she will be if she finds out the truth.\n\n\nJohn and Natalie try to call Lehigh Prison to save Todd's life, but they can't get a connection.  John asks the front desk to send a police officer to the room. He wants to explain the situation, and convince them to charter an emergency flight.  The Thai authority remains unconvinced, however, and Natalie knocks him out with her crutch.\n\n\nAt the Capital Punishment protest organized by Viki to save Todd, Margaret's sister overhears Viki and Evangeline talking about their attempt to exhume Margaret's body.  Dorian witnesses them fighting, and buts in-of course. Viki appears to be at the end of her rope with Dorian, and tells her that she knows the reason for her sudden interest in activism is really about sucking up to Clint-and that it's despicable.\n\n\nDuring Todd's last visit with his children, Jack tells his father that he considers \"Dr. Spencer\" his dad now.  Todd has tender words for his son, but Jack reminds him that he was taught to always listen to his mother-and she thinks he's bad, so he does, as well.  Starr tries to tell her little brother that he's wrong, and so is their mother, and Todd says that while Jack should listen to his mom, he can feel whatever he wants.  Ultimately, though, Jack is unable to hug his dad, or even say, \"I love you.\"  He leaves the room, and then leaves the prison with Dr. Spencer. Starr dissolves into tears, and once again proclaims her faith in her father's innocence.  Outside the room, Blair is slowly breaking-she screams out, pleading with Todd to let her see him, as he has been refusing to do so.  He is not in denial, however.  In fact, Todd seems to finally accept that death is his fate, and he and his daughter share an absolutely gut-wrenching goodbye when the guard comes in and tells him that \"time is up.\"  In more ways than one, it seems.  Starr bursts out of the room and past Blair, who she vows never to forgive.  Blair loses it, and goes back to pleading with Todd, now alone.  She says he wanted to believe him, but she couldn't, because he always lied to her.  She also says that he can't die until he hears what she has to say.\n  \n\n\n",
