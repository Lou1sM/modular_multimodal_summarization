John asks Cris to check the rest of his paintings for the symbol and then snaps a digital picture of the symbol to send to the forensics team so they can look for the symbol at the other arson sites. John realizes the arsonist is getting arrogant by leaving a symbol, which makes him that much more sure that they'll eventually be able to catch him. \n\n\nJohn and Cristian head to the station, and John brings in a tech to look at the painted symbol. Then they discuss how the arsonist has escalated his attacks and how it's possible the arsonist may get caught after a few more attacks. As they talk about wanting to catch the arsonist because of what happened to Evangeline, the tech reports that he found information about the paint and the brush used in creating the symbol. Later on, Cris returns to his studio and curses the arsonist.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Talia is looking through the files on Antonio's desk to get some information for John when Antonio walks in. Antonio tells her that he's back on the job because he and Jessica are finished, and demands that Talia back away from his desk. Talia's shocked that Jessica and Antonio broke up and thinks that Antonio should take some time to let it sink in instead of burying himself in work. He tells her to mind her own business, but she counters with trying to get reassigned to a different case. Antonio doesn't mind working with someone else, but Talia won't let him do that either. He says that he wants to focus all his remaining energy on finding the arsonist, but Talia fights to get through to him to back off because his head isn't in the right place. Antonio tells her that she can talk all she wants, but he's not going to back away from the case. Talia doesn't back down so easily, and tells Antonio that she did a similar thing to what he's doing after 9/11. She then says it was the biggest mistake of her life.\n\n\nTalia tells Antonio how, a few weeks after 9/11, she and her partner responded to an armed robbery call. She felt like she was in a fog, and as they drove up to the crime scene, she felt like it was 9/11 all over again. She was so distracted that she walked right into the line of fire and her partner took a bullet for her. Her partner ended up dying, and she's still haunted by that moment. She convinces Antonio to learn from her experience and take a leave of absence, because if his head isn't in the game, someone could get hurt. He agrees and leaves the police department.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Viki calls Kevin to tell him about Jessica's health and to have him thank Kelly for getting tested.

Viki admits that she heard it from Clint, and then insists on taking Jess back to her room. Nash refuses to allow that, and Jess defends him. Jessica tells Viki that she just needed to get out of her room for a bit and that she wants to thank all the people that are getting tested as a possible donor for her. Viki then asks Jessica if she's sure about breaking up with Antonio, and Jess insists that she loves Nash and everyone is just going to have to accept that. \n\n\nViki tells Jessica that she'll accept this decision, but worries about the timing of it. Jessica tells her that it was actually very easy to make the decision because she's sick. Jessica then has a weak spell, and Viki thinks Jess should go back to her room. Jessica insists that she's fine, but she wants to stop talking about her decision. Viki says that she has some things that she'd like both Jess and Nash to hear. She tells them that she was furious when Clint told her about them being together, but realizes that Jessica actually did a very brave thing. She then tells Jessica about how many people got tested for her. Viki tries to encourage Jessica to go back to her room for dinner, but Jess refuses, and is craving an omelet. Nash then recites by memory the exact omelet Jessica wants. Viki has reservations about giving her such unhealthy food, which prompts Jessica to joke about not caring about how healthy the food is because she's dying. Viki's bothered by this, but relents and tells Nash that she's going to run this menu past her doctor first. Before she leaves, she warns Nash to take very good care of Jessica.\n\n\nAfter Viki leaves, Nash reassures Jessica that everything is going to turn out just fine.\n\n\nAs Viki is picking up Jessica's omelet at the diner, she runs into Antonio.\n\n\nStarr arrives at Dorian's house, very angry that Cole is going on a date with Britney.
