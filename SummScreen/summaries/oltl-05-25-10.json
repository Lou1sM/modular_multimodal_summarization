She thought better of her question and said that John didn't owe her anything. John apologized for the way things had turned out, but Marty reasoned that things were better that way. She finished packing and confessed that she would always be sorry that they didn't have their child. John offered to help her carry her stuff, but Marty wanted something else from him.\n\n\nMarty asked John to keep an eye on Cole, but John said he would have done that regardless. He cared about Cole and Marty and just wanted her to be happy. Marty handed John the key to the apartment as John's phone rang. She urged him to take it, so he did. He had to leave for a case, but when he turned to tell Marty, she was gone.\n\n\nAt the hospital, T\u00e9a and Blair got out of the elevator as Blair reminded T\u00e9a that she would be very tired after the treatment. T\u00e9a said that she was going to the courthouse, anyway, because it was her most important job to get Todd out of serving time in jail. Blair vowed that she was going to tag along with T\u00e9a the entire day to make sure that she was all right.\n\n\nDown the hall, Markko was having a doctor look at his wrist. The doctor asked when and how he had hurt it. Markko claimed that he must have walked into a wall. \"How's the other guy?\" asked the doctor. The doctor explained that it was probably a fracture, and he would give Markko a splint. Because of his job at the diner, Markko wondered whether or not he would be able to use his hand. The doctor said he would still be able to work, but he would have to be careful. When the doctor left to get Markko's splint, Markko thought about punching Ford the night before.\n\n\nOn the phone with Jessica, Brody wondered if he had dreamed what happened the night before. Jessica jokingly asked who he was, but Brody said it was too soon to make memory jokes. She explained how great it had been to tuck Bree into bed. Jessica suggested that she and Brody go out to breakfast before he had to go to work. He said he'd be there soon and hung up. Natalie walked out and Jessica hugged her, explaining that she had remembered everything the night before.\n\n\nJessica apologized for being so awful to her sister. Natalie understood, and mentioned that Jessica wasn't the only one who got something back that they had lost. Natalie filled Jessica in on what had happened with John. Natalie was delighted to hear that Jessica was happy for her. Natalie felt guilty as she thought about her night with Brody. Brody entered and was surprised to see Natalie. Natalie explained that her life wasn't the only one that changed when she had left Brody's the night before. \"You were with Brody last night?\" Jessica asked.\n\n\nNatalie clarified that she had stopped by Brody's to say goodbye before she was going to leave for London. She explained to Brody what had happened with John. Brody then nudged Jessica that they would have to leave if they wanted breakfast before he had to work. When Jessica went to get her purse, Brody and Natalie agreed that they couldn't tell Jessica what happened. Just then, Brody's phone rang. It was John who wanted to meet him at Ford's apartment. Jessica returned and told him to call her when he was off-duty, and he left. Jessica realized she was lucky that Brody still wanted her after how horribly she had treated him. She asked Natalie about her and Brody.\n\n\nJessica knew that the two had leaned on each other a lot in the past few weeks and was glad that they had each other. She realized that most guys would have just moved on to another woman with the way Jessica had treated him. Natalie reminded her sister that Brody adored her and there was no one else for him. Natalie wondered what had triggered Jessica's memory to return. As Jessica thought about what had happened with Ford, she lied that her memory had come back suddenly.\n\n\nJessica, thankful the whole thing was over, wanted to talk about Natalie. Jessica wanted to know every single detail of Natalie's entire night. Natalie thought about her night with Brody as she explained that it was a long story.\n\n\nCristian and Layla returned to their apartment after deciding to turn back in the middle of their trip to Maryland. Layla chose to deal with Ford before telling Jessica of the engagement. Knocking on Ford's bedroom door, Layla yelled that she needed to talk to him. When he doesn't answer, Layla entered the room and was shocked to find Ford in his bed covered in blood. Cristian called 9-1-1 for an ambulance as Layla shouted that Ford looked dead.\n\n\nThe EMTs arrived and found that Ford still had a pulse. As Ford was being taken out of the apartment, Layla reasoned that she was angry with Ford, but she wouldn't wish that on anyone. As pictures were being taken of the scene of the crime, John investigated. He pulled back the covers of the bed to reveal one of Ford's trophies, completely bloodied.\n\n\nAs the doctor explained to Markko how to take care of his wrist, Ford was wheeled into the hospital. The EMTs marveled at how Ford was alive. As Markko watched the doctor try to save Ford, he flashed back to when he was washing his bloodied hands. The doctor said that Ford needed to be moved to surgery. As Ford was wheeled out, Markko stopped a nurse and asked if Ford was going to make it.\n\n\nAt her apartment, Langton deleted a picture of Ford off her phone. She heard a knock at the door and hoped it was Markko. She answered the door to Dorian, who wanted to hear all about the prom. Langston explained that it was a nightmare because she got into a fight with Markko and they broke up. As she cried, she lamented breaking his heart and just wished she could make him understand.\n\n\nLangston explained to Dorian how she cheated on Markko, but Dorian thought it was understandable since Langston was young, and Markko was her first serious relationship. She was sure that Markko would understand because the affair was meaningless. Langston admitted that she thought it had meaning and she thought she was in love, but the guy was just using her.\n\n\nDorian wanted to know who the boy was, but Langston confessed that it was a man. Dorian yelled about how he should know better and be responsible for his actions of taking advantage of a child. Langston described how Ford lied. Dorian said Ford was a dead man. Langston said there was no point in talking to him because she was never going to see him again. Dorian said that he was a predator and that he should be held accountable. Langston explained that she could have stopped it and that no one had forced her to cheat. She hadn't been listening to anyone, including herself. Dorian claimed to know what she was doing and left to talk to Ford.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Todd apologized to Starr for the toll that the trial was taking on her and Cole, and for the fact that Cole couldn't go to the prom the night before. Starr told Todd that he should just focus on proving his innocence, and on finding out who really pushed Marty. Both thought that Hannah was the one who pushed Marty. Todd wondered where T\u00e9a was so he could tell her. Starr reminded Todd that she had accused Hannah to her face, and Hannah still denied it. Starr wanted to find a way to prove that Hannah was lying, which Todd said he was working on.\n\n\nTodd was surprised to see Blair enter the courthouse with T\u00e9a, but Blair assured him that she wasn't there for him. She was there for Starr. Starr pulled Blair aside and wondered when she and T\u00e9a had turned into best friends. Blair denied it, and changed the subject to the prom. She thanked her daughter for showing Dani a good time and asked how her night was. Starr replied that there were a few great moments during the night. Blair reminded Starr that she loved her.\n\n\nA visibly tired T\u00e9a believed that the claim against Hannah was a long shot, but her suicide attempt could help to discredit her testimony. Todd told T\u00e9a that she had better not fall asleep in front of the judge, but T\u00e9a assured him that there was no one more motivated than she was.\n\n\nT\u00e9a got up to tell Blair that she was fine, and that Blair could go. Blair protested until she got a call from Langston. Langston needed Blair to go over because she was the only one who would understand. At the urging of T\u00e9a, Blair left. T\u00e9a told Todd that the judge would be there soon so they had to get ready. Marty entered the courthouse, to Todd's dismay. Starr wished her dad luck and left to talk to Marty. T\u00e9a warned Todd not to screw up his plea because she needed him free. Todd wondered why. T\u00e9a replied by showing him a picture of Dani and saying that they couldn't have any kind of relationship with him behind bars.\n\n\nStarr thanked Marty for helping to get Cole out of jail for the prom the night before. Starr then reminded Marty that Todd would be charged with murder unless Marty told the court that Hannah had lied. Marty explained that Hannah saw who pushed her, but Starr countered that Hannah only said that Todd pushed Marty to make Starr and Cole choose different sides.\n\n\nMarty said that there was other evidence, but Starr wasn't convinced that a few threads could prove that her father pushed Marty. Starr knew that her dad loved to get revenge, but she didn't believe that he could push a pregnant woman down the stairs. She said she knew that Hannah was the one who did it and begged Marty to consider the possibility.\n\n\nLangston read a text message from Ford that said he loved her and threw her phone. When Blair arrived at the apartment, Langston was crying that she made of mess of things and didn't know what to do. Blair told her to calm down, but Langston claimed to have done something terrible the night before.\n\n\nJohn began to ask Cristian and Layla questions as he gave the bagged trophy to Brody. John ruled out a robbery because there was no forced entry. He thought that whoever hurt Ford wanted him dead. John asked if Ford had any enemies. Feeling guilty, Cristian hesitantly gave Markko's name because Ford had been fooling around with Markko's girlfriend. However, both Cristian and Layla didn't think that Markko would do something like that.\n\n\nAs John thanked Cristian and Layla for their help, Brody informed the pair that Jessica finally remembered everything. Happy for Brody, Cristian shook Brody's hand and walked out of the apartment. More pictures were being taken of the scene as Brody walked in the room and asked if there were any fingerprints yet. John said that evidence was still being collected, but whoever did it definitely wanted Ford dead.\n\n\nJohn wanted to talk to Markko and Langston, as he believed that Langston had been on the scene. He wanted to get a timeline together. Just then, Dorian walked in claiming that she was the mayor and she needed to speak with Ford. John told her that it wasn't possible because someone had tried to kill him the night before.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Somebody had tried to kill Ford. But the cops have yet to prove who. Markko has injured his hand and appears to be the prime suspect. Blair is with Tea keeping the secret that she's dying. But Tea is determined to represent Todd and keep him out of prison, if nothing else, because he's the only parent who will be there for Dani. Jessica has regained her memory and everything appears ok. But since Natalie has decided to stay in town and back with John and Brody is back with Jessica, there's awkwardness regarding the fact that Brody and Natalie slept together the night before she intended to leave town.",
