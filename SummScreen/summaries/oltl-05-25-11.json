Brody informed the two about the emergences of Wes and Bess. Brody reminded Todd and T\u00e9a that Todd had hidden Marty at his house before. Through all of Todd's smart comments, T\u00e9a promised Brody that Marty hadn't called or been around the house. T\u00e9a suggested that Marty had been trying to throw the police off of her trail, because Marty had probably seen the news reports about herself.\n\n\nBrody suggested that if Marty wasn't there, the Mannings wouldn't mind Brody searching the house. T\u00e9a wondered if he had a warrant. As Todd argued with Brody, Brody put a handcuff on one of Todd's wrists for interfering. T\u00e9a began to argue with Brody as well, so Brody cuffed both Todd and T\u00e9a to the railing of the stairs. Brody went up the stairs and crashed around through the rooms. Todd yelled that Brody would pay if he broke anything.\n\n\nTodd wanted to press charges against Brody and the department. However, T\u00e9a blamed herself and Todd for not treating Brody with compassion. Todd didn't like the idea of Brody going through their things, but T\u00e9a was sure that Brody wouldn't find anything. Seeing the look on Todd's face, she wanted to make sure that Brody wouldn't find anything. Todd claimed that he just didn't like thinking of Brody going through T\u00e9a's underwear. T\u00e9a still believed that Todd was hiding something.\n\n\nBrody returned downstairs empty-handed. Todd sarcastically asked Brody where Marty and Liam were, and if Brody had checked the dungeon. \"As your lawyer,\" T\u00e9a said, \"shut-up, Todd.\" Brody took the handcuffs off the couple, and apologized to T\u00e9a. In turn, she apologized for not being more compassionate. Brody admitted that he was surprised not to find Marty or Liam, because Bess was usually truthful. He was disappointed because he had no more leads. T\u00e9a promised to let Brody know if Marty contacted them, and Brody left.\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a received a phone call. She was needed at Statesville. Todd offered to drive her, but T\u00e9a declined. He told her to be careful, and promised to call her if Brody returned. T\u00e9a left, and Todd stood in the doorway. A minute later, Marty walked up to Todd's front door.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the police station. Another officer asked how Brody had made out at Todd's. Brody informed the officer that he hadn't found any sign of Marty or Liam. He continued that Todd claimed to not know anything about their whereabouts. The officer wondered if Brody believed Todd.\n\n\nBlair saw Tomas across the room at Capricorn, and walked over to him. She was happy that the charges against him had been dropped, and asked if he wanted a table. He related that he wasn't there for food or drinks. Blair replied that she had to work because one of her bartenders had called in sick. Tomas continued that he wanted a life with her, and thought that she wanted the same thing.\n\n\nTomas wondered what would have happened if Blair hadn't gotten the call about Todd during their date. She replied that she had gotten the call, which had caused everything to change. As Tomas talked about why they were attracted to each other, Blair interrupted him. \"Shut-up and kiss me before I change my mind,\" she said, and the two shared a kiss.\n\n\nBlair wanted Tomas all to herself, so she proposed they leave Capricorn. Tomas suggested going to Blair's, but Blair didn't want all of Dorian's questions. They couldn't go to Tomas' because he was still living with Todd and T\u00e9a. Blair wondered how that living arrangement would work out. Tomas said he was only there at least until Todd's shooter was caught. Tomas pulled Blair out of Capricorn and said that they'd figure out somewhere to go.\n\n\nStarr walked through the hall in front of James's apartment to find luminaries in the shape of an \"S\" on the floor. James walked out of his apartment and told Starr that she was early. She offered to return later, but he led her into the apartment anyway. Starr was stunned to walk through the apartment to see food on the table, posters hanging, and Italian music playing. James reasoned that \"I wanted to take you to Rome.\"\n\n\nJames told Starr that Ford was gone for the night, so it was just them. She wondered what the occasion was. He told her that it was the anniversary of the very first time they'd met. They reminisced about the day they'd met in the park. James told her that before they had met, he hadn't trusted anyone, and he hadn't had anyone at all. Meeting Starr, and her family and friends, had made him feel that he was a part of something. He said that she had changed his life.\n\n\nJames had to get dressed, so he turned to go to his room. Starr stopped him, and assured him that he had changed her life as well. They shared a kiss, and James left to get dressed. A short while later, the two finished their Italian dinner. After James offered her gelato and a cappuccino, Starr said that he was making her feel bad. He told her that she needed to let someone do something for her for once. She was used to worrying about everyone else.\n\n\nStarr wanted to do something for James. She told him that the evening had been perfect, and reminded him that they were alone. Looking uncomfortable, James asked if she wanted to go for a walk. He walked her in front of one of the posters, and told her that it was the Spanish Steps. They slow-danced to the music. She told him that things were perfect, and kissed him. However, he pulled away and said that things weren't perfect.\n\n\nA short while later, James rang the bell at the front desk of the Palace. He asked the clerk for a room. Starr told him that they could have stayed at James's place. James reasoned that, with their track record, something major would have happened, like a pipe bursting. Starr continued that the Palace was expensive. James revealed that Starr wasn't the only one with \"connections.\"\n\n\nJames told Starr that he had worked on the owner's car, so she had given James a discount. \"You mean Renee?\" Starr asked. James felt strange knowing that Starr knew the owner, and suggested they go to Cherryvale. Starr confessed that she knew people there as well. Starr reasoned that it was late, so they probably wouldn't run into anyone they knew. If they did, Starr said that they had nothing to be ashamed of. Satisfied, James took the room key from the front desk, and the two walked away. Before they could get very far, they were shocked to run into Blair and Tomas.\n\n\nCutter walked into Clint's hospital room. Clint asked if Cutter was ready to have Tess committed. Viki was horrified when Cutter asked how much money he would get if he did. Cutter told Viki that some people had to work for their money. Viki wondered what kind of work Cutter did, but he only said that he was willing to \"work things out\" about Tess.\n\n\nClint wondered what would happen if he refused to give Cutter money for Tess. Cutter warned that she would probably make \"a whole army\" of new alters. Cutter informed Clint and Viki that Tess thought Cutter was taking her away from Llanview. She had no idea that Cutter was meeting with Clint. He related that it would be Clint's only chance to get his daughter back from Cutter.\n\n\nClint handed Cutter a piece of paper, and told Cutter it was his offer. Clint assured Cutter that the money would be transferred to Cutter's account as soon as Tess was committed. Cutter was satisfied, but wanted one more thing. Viki and Clint were shocked that Cutter wanted Clint's house. Cutter reasoned that he needed a place to live. Viki thought that whatever Clint had offered would be enough for Cutter to buy any house in the county.\n\n\nViki said that the house wasn't on the market. She told Clint that it had been Asa's home, so it was Clint's home. \"Don't let this leech bleed you dry,\" she continued. Cutter thought that Clint wasn't agreeing to Cutter's terms. \"You bet!\" Viki exclaimed. Clint told Viki to stop. Cutter reminded Clint that, if Clint kept his house, Cutter would keep Tess.\n\n\nFord kissed Emma as Tess walked into Capricorn. Emma remarked on Ford's \"technique,\" as Tess made a disgusted sound. Tess thought back to the time when Ford had kissed her the same way he had kissed Emma. She hit the table he was sitting at, and he told her that he was busy. He told Tess to leave, because he was on a date. Tess reminded Ford how disgusting she thought he was, and she warned Emma about Ford as well. Emma was surprised that Tess would keep talking about the past, and suggested that Tess was jealous.\n\n\nTess stated that she had \"traded up\" from Ford. Tess and Ford began to argue about Ryder, and the money. Ford yelled that Cutter was just using Tess. \"You do care?\" Tess asked. As he explained that she was the mother of his son, he noticed that Emma was gone. Cutter entered, and Tess told Ford that she and Cutter were going to celebrate in style. She turned around to find Viki.\n\n\nTess hoped to never see Viki again. Viki related that, the sooner Tess was gone, the happier Viki would be. Ford didn't want Viki to let Tess go, but Viki reassured Ford when two men from St. Anne's walked into Capricorn. Tess laughed at Viki, and asked Cutter to tell Viki that she didn't have the right to commit Tess. Cutter admitted that Tess was going to go with the men. Cutter asked Viki for the paperwork, and signed it.\n\n\nThe two men grabbed Tess, and she screamed for them to let her go. Viki warned her to stop struggling, or she would be sedated. Tess was stunned to learn that the whole thing had been Cutter's idea. Viki called Clint to let him know what was happening. Clint, with a computer on his lap, said to tell Cutter to check his e-mail. Cutter got a message on his phone that said \"Wire Transfer Complete.\"\n\n\nCutter was happy to be a millionaire. He asked Viki for the other part of the deal. Viki handed the deed to Clint's house to Cutter. \"Pleasure doing business with you,\" Cutter said smugly. Suddenly, Tess stomped on the feet of the men holding her and hugged Ford. In his ear, she told him that, if he didn't help her, she would make sure that Ford never saw Ryder again.\n\n\nThe men picked Tess up and carried her out, as she screamed for help. \"Next round's on me!\" Cutter yelled, as a sympathetic Ford observed a crying Viki.\n\n\n",
