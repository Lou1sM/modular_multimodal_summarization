    "soap_central": "\n\nTodd was haunted by Margaret's last moments (or what he imagined they were). Todd spit at Andrew when he asked if Todd had any last words, along the lines of asking for forgiveness. Andrew explained what Todd would experience as they began administering the three different kind of death drugs. A prison doctor took his vitals and asked if he wanted a sedative. Todd refused. He wanted to be clear headed. He sat on his cot and looked at the photo of his family, and again flashed back to Margaret and said \"I'm not a baby killer.\" Evangeline arrived with bad news. \"The governor has refused our request for a stay.\" Todd began crying and tried to comfort her. Todd and Evangeline lost it in each other's arms.The guard had to separate them. The warden asked Todd for any last-minute requests. No. A nearly catatonic Todd walked to the death chamber as Andrew read the 23rd Psalm. Todd nearly collapsed as he was brought into the chamber. Evangeline sarcastically invited Hugh to take a front-row seat. Blair came face-to-face with Margaret's sister. Cris sat by Evangeline. \n\n\nPaige and Spencer were both at the police station. Paige was determined to save Todd. Paige and Spencer exchanged barbs. \"You are sicker than I thought,\" she spit out, but Spencer retaliated by saying the story of her life was missing out on love. Paige drove like a crazy woman to the prison, but swerved off the road. \n\n\nBlair walked around her living room looking at all the photos of Todd and the family. Dorian came by to watch Starr. Starr accused her mother of not being able to wait until Todd's life was over. Blair assured her daughter that she and her brother are her life. Blair asked Dorian to speak about Todd with respect when discussing him with Starr. \"That man will always be that little girl's father,\" Blair said as she left the penthouse crying. Adriana showed up and tried to prevent Starr from going to the prison, but Dorian agreed to take her. \n\n\nThere was mayhem outside of the prison. Clint brought Viki some coffee. An exasperated Viki told her ex that no one she called would help her and expressed some bitterness about \"politics.\" Blair, Hugh, Bo arrived. Hugh said a few words to the crowd \u2014 \"the punishment fit the crime.\" Bo, Blair, Clint and Viki glared from the sidelines. Starr showed up. \"The baby killer's daughter\" the crowd yelled. Starr asked her Aunt Viki for a favor \u2014 \"Keep my mother away from me,\" but then fell into Blair's arms for comfort. Clint left to hold down the fort at home. Bo and Viki entered the prison. Starr ran into Spencer in the prison yard and was horrified to see that Spencer planned to be in the viewing room during the execution. \n\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere over some ocean, John, Natalie, David and Margaret were on some plane flying under the radar (literally). John worried that they wouldn't make it in time. Natalie told Margaret and a napping David that they were heading directly to the prison to \"save my uncle's life.\" Natalie assured John it wouldn't be his fault if they didn't make it there in time. \"I don't want Manning's blood on my hands,\" he explained and then thanked her for being there for him. \"You really came through for me.\" John added. The plane landed and David observed, \"I hate to break it to you. But we've got company out there.\" \n\n\nThe final eerie moment: The curtain opened on Todd strapped to the gurney as Blair and Viki wept. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everyone gathers at the prison for Todd's execution. There are tears from almost everyone. Jack reveals to Todd that he is not afraid of him. Margaret's sister offers her condolences to Blair and her children. John, Natalie, David and Margaret wing their way toward Llanview in order to save Todd's life. Todd is strapped to the table, and raised up so he can speak to the people in the viewing area. Starr cannot believe that Spencer would arrive at the prison for Todd's execution.",
