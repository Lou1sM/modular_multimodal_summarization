Moments later, Blair approached Todd. The two happily embraced before Blair asked how T\u00e9a was doing. Todd admitted that he had not heard anything from the operating room. Todd inquired after the children. Blair assured Todd that they were fine. \n\n\nBlair then changed the subject to Powell. She told Todd that he shouldn't blame himself for Powell's insanity or the things that Powell had done. Todd appreciated Blair's support. He told her that one good thing had come out their ordeal; Powell had reunited them with their granddaughter. \n\n\nTodd and Blair were overjoyed as they talked about Starr's baby. Todd told Blair that their granddaughter looked like Starr and had Blair's eyes. Blair admitted that she was eager to see the baby. Todd confided that he felt as if he had been given a second chance; he asked Blair if she believed in second chances. Blair admitted that she did. When Todd mentioned that he looked forward to telling Starr about the baby, Blair realized that Todd had no idea that Jessica had disappeared with Chloe. \n\n\nTodd took the news well. He recalled that the last time he had been in the hospital, following Blair's stabbing. Todd had been worried that Blair would die. When Powell had dragged Blair and T\u00e9a away, Todd had been certain that he would never see them alive again. He was also convinced that Blair and T\u00e9a were furious with Todd. Blair confessed that she and T\u00e9a had exchanged words, but they had also made peace with each other. As they talked, the surgeon approached. The doctor had good news: T\u00e9a had been stabilized and was expected to make a full recovery. Todd and Blair were delighted and shared another hug. \n\n\nIn Bo's office, Bo updated Clint, Viki, and Brody on the search for Jessica and Chloe. They had issued an APB and stationed a unit at Nash and Jessica's cottage as well as other locations significant to Jessica. Bo decided to make another attempt to reach Jessica on the cell phone. They agreed that Brody was their best chance of reaching Jessica, so they handed the phone to him. \n\n\nBrody dialed Jessica's number. As expected, Bess answered the phone. However, Bess wasn't interested in cooperating. Bess made it clear that she had no intention of returning to Llanview, then she disconnected the phone. As Bess sped down the road, she dropped the cell phone out of the car's window. \n\n\nViki was concerned that the stress of the situation could prompt alters, more dangerous than Tess, to emerge. Bo wanted to issue another Amber Alert. Clint was worried about labeling his daughter a felon; he didn't want it to endanger Jessica and the baby. Bo assured Clint that they would use extreme caution when they approached Jessica. \n\n\nBo advised Viki and Clint to return to Llanfair. Bo reminded everyone that Jessica might gain control over her alters. Bo was certain that Jessica would return home the first opportunity that she had. Before Viki and Clint left Bo's office, they invited Brody to accompany them to Llanfair. \n\n\nClint told Nora that he was going home with Viki to wait for news on Jessica. Nora promised that she would try to get to Llanfair as soon as she could. Clint surprised Nora by suggesting that they go over wedding plans when she arrived at Llanfair; he explained that it would help him keep his mind occupied. As Nora and Clint kissed goodbye, Bo watched them through his office window. \n\n\nLater, in Bo's office, Bo commented on the kiss he had seen between Nora and Clint. It appeared to Bo that things were better between Nora and his brother. Bo sensed that Nora was hiding something. When he pushed Nora for answers, she told him about her engagement to Clint. Bo was stunned, but managed to recover quickly. Bo promised to return Jessica and Chloe home safely, so that Nora and Clint could get married. According to Bo, then everything would be settled. Nora seemed slightly baffled by Bo's parting words. \n\n\nIn the car, Tess emerged to argue with Bess. Bess insisted that she needed to protect Jessica from the truth. Tess urged Bess to tell Jessica about the night Chloe had been born. Bess refused to consider it; she insisted that she was doing what was best for Jessica. Tess switched tactics. She tried to reason with Bess, pointing out that she had no money, no plan, and no one to turn to. When Bess complained of a headache, Tess suggested that Bess take a nap. Bess refused to be tricked into relinquishing control. \n\n\nThe two personalities continued to argue while Bess drove. The talked about Jessica's pregnancy, Chloe's birth, Todd's reaction to the news that Chloe and Hope had been switched, and Tess's attempt to kill Natalie and Jared. Tess was certain that Nash would want Bess to make things right by telling Jessica the truth. \n\n\nBess blamed Tess for the mess that they were in. However, she did thank Tess for giving her an idea. Bess banished Tess by sending Tess to sleep. After Tess was gone, Bess told Chloe that they needed people who were on their side. Bess assured the baby that she knew where to find those people. \n\n\nIn Llanfair's library, Natalie was wracked with guilt. She regretted not telling Jessica the truth about Chloe the minute they had discovered that the babies had been switched. Natalie was convinced that they could have avoided Jessica's predicament. Charlie pointed out that there weren't any guarantees that things would have turned out differently. Jared agreed with his father. While Natalie broke down in tears, Jared and Charlie tried their best to assure Natalie that she wasn't responsible for her sister's reaction to the news that her daughter had died. \n\n\nEventually, Charlie managed to steer the conversation to Natalie and Jared's wedding. He was disappointed that their wedding had to be postponed. Jared and Natalie announced that they had eloped when it became clear that everything was about to blow up in their faces. Charlie was thrilled by the news. As he congratulated the happy couple, Clint, Viki, and Brody walked in. They had heard the news about Jared and Natalie's wedding. Viki and Clint were happy for their daughter; they promised to celebrate the nuptials after Jessica returned home. \n\n\nCharlie pulled Brody aside. The two men went outside to the patio. Charlie wanted to know how Brody was holding up. Brody admitted that he was not doing well. Brody credited Jessica with his recovery. According to Brody, Jessica had reached him when no one else had been able to. Brody was frustrated because he felt as if he had failed Jessica when he had lost her on the phone. Brody was determined to find Jessica. \n\n\nAn hour before Kyle's arraignment, Nora informed him that she would demand that the judge set his bail at one hundred thousand dollars. Kyle decided to reach out to Stacy for the money. Kyle left a threatening voicemail message for Stacy to bail him out of jail. He promised to sell her secret about Shane to the highest bidder if Stacy didn't cooperate. Kyle had no intention of remaining in jail; he had to attend his sister's funeral. \n\n\nRex and Stacy arrived at the loft. Rex felt terrible for Natalie because her wedding had been cancelled. Rex told Stacy about the history between Natalie, Jared, and Jessica's alter, Tess. Rex declared that Natalie deserved some happiness after everything she and Jared had been through. Stacy added that Rex, too, deserved to be happy. \n\n\nLater, Rex decided to visit Shane. Stacy tried to tempt Rex to change his plans, to no avail. While Rex went to change clothes, Stacy replayed Kyle's message in her head. Afterwards, Stacy went to her suitcase where she kept the money that she had stolen. \n\n\nStacy lied to Rex; she claimed that she had a job interview. Shortly after Stacy left the loft, someone knocked on the door. Rex was surprised to find Stan on his doorstep. Rex immediately recognized Stacy's old boss as the guy from Jared's bachelor party. When he accused Stan of trying to hit on Stacy, Stan laughed. \n\n\nStan warned Rex not to believe everything that Stacy said because Stacy was a liar and a thief. Rex didn't appreciate Stan's harsh assessment of Stacy. Rex defended Stacy by informing Stan that Stacy had saved Shane's life. Stan asked Rex if he was sure that Stacy had actually given the gift of life. Rex was taken aback by the question. \n\n\nStan explained that Stacy had stolen twenty thousand dollars from his nightclub. Rex offered to call the police, so that Stan could report the theft, but Stan wanted nothing to do with the police. Rex wasn't surprised by Stan's reaction. He tossed Stan out of the loft. Before he left, Stan suggested that Rex question Stacy about the theft. \n\n\nLater, Stacy arrived at the loft after bailing out Kyle. Rex asked Stacy how her job interview had gone. Stacy easily lied, claiming someone else had been hired. Without warning, Rex dropped the bombshell that Stan had been by the loft. Stacy was speechless as Rex went on to reveal that Stan had accused Stacy of stealing money. \n\n\nSchuyler went to the carriage house to talk to Gigi about Stacy. He explained that he had once dated Stacy, but she had been hung up on another guy. Gigi thought that Schuyler wanted her to talk to Stacy on his behalf. She warned Schuyler that Stacy wasn't likely to listen to her because their relationship was strained. Schuyler confessed that he knew the sisters weren't on the best of terms. \n\n\nHe admitted that he hadn't been a prize when he had dated Stacy. However, the issue in their relationship had been another guy whom Stacy had been obsessed with. Schuyler was stunned when Gigi revealed that Rex had been the object of Stacy's obsession. Schuyler quickly figured out that Stacy had somehow managed to bargain Shane's life in exchange for Rex. Gigi's reaction confirmed Schuyler's suspicions. \n\n\nGigi implored Schuyler to keep quiet about the blackmail. Gigi explained that she had promised God that she would do whatever He asked of her in exchange for Shane's recovery. Gigi couldn't expose Stacy as long as Shane was not in remission. Schuyler quickly realized that Stacy had used Gigi's promise to God to her advantage. \n\n\nSchuyler was more convinced than ever that Stacy had not saved Shane's life. Gigi was confused by Schuyler's comment. Schuyler clarified that he was certain that Stacy had not donated her stem cells to Shane.\n\n\n",
