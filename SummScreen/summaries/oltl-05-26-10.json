What did I do?\" she said to herself as she flashed back to her night in bed with Ford. Just then, Viki walked in and Jessica snapped off the television. Viki sensed that her daughter was upset but Jessica attributed it to the fact that she was concerned about the terrible things she had done to people and all that she had to do to make it up to them. Viki assured her that she didn't have to do anything because Jessica had been through a lot and everyone understood that it wasn't Jessica's fault. \n\n\nJessica thought there had been awful moments with Cristian and Layla but Viki thought they had just been awkward moments. She emphasized that Jessica hadn't hurt anyone and everyone had survived. She noted that Cristian and Layla were happy and every person was thrilled that Jessica had returned to them. Jessica felt guilty about how she had treated Bree but Viki promised that Bree was fine and had known that her mom had been ill. The little girl knew that her mother was back and feeling better. Jessica insisted that she couldn't pretend that nothing bad had happened but Viki maintained that nothing bad had occurred. \n\n\nJessica was appreciative of her mother's claims but she couldn't accept them. Viki pointed out that Jessica had been protecting herself because she had wanted to forget what had happened with Mitch. Jessica again flashed back to the time she spent with Ford in his bed but she shook it off. Viki stressed that everyone understood Jessica's behavior. Viki left to make a phone call and Jessica made one of her own. She attempted to get information from the hospital on Ford's condition but she was unsuccessful. \n\n\nTodd walked into his office at the Sun and was surprised to see Kelly sitting at his desk. He ordered her out of his chair but Kelly reminded him that it was her desk and she was sure he remembered. Todd wondered why Shaun was standing outside and Kelly explained that he was her bodyguard. She was equally surprised to see Todd who informed her he was out on bail. Kelly agreed to give up her seat at the desk for a one time celebration of Todd's release. Todd was happy that he had an alibi and had been in jail during the time that Ford was attacked. \n\n\nHe also disclosed that Hannah was missing and he thought that pointed to his own innocence. Kelly thought maybe the cops were holding Hannah for her own protection but Todd disagreed. He had a source in the police department who had revealed that the police were searching for Hannah also. Todd wanted to find her first so that he could convince her to tell the truth about Marty's fall. Kelly suggested that Hannah was hiding because she found out about Todd's release from jail. Todd was happy to note that the cops didn't have a case without Hannah. \n\n\nKelly inquired if Todd would try to get rid of Hannah but Todd indignantly stated no. He only wanted to speak to her. Just then a bouquet of flowers was delivered and Todd grabbed the card before Kelly could get to it. They were from Reed and Todd wanted more information. Kelly explained that Reed was a friend from London and Todd teased that he must be more than a friend to purchase such \"pricey\" flowers. \n\n\nKelly enlightened Todd on her trip to New York City with Reed and Todd was surprised to hear she had a date. Kelly wanted to know if Todd were jealous but Todd denied it. He merely thought that Reed was the wrong guy for Kelly for choosing such a \"cheap\" card and flowers. A confused Kelly reminded him that he had just called the flowers \"pricey.\" Todd muttered it was about the context and just thought that Kelly deserved better. He made fun of Reed's name and ordered her to get rid of the flowers as they smelled up the office. \n\n\nKelly received a phone call and advised Todd that she was heading to the hospital to work on her story about Ford. She thought that Todd should let the cops worry about Hannah's whereabouts. Kelly was shocked when Todd agreed with her. She assured him that Reed was \"terrific.\" After she was gone, Todd made a phone call and asked the person on the other end if they had found the \"little bitch.\" \n\n\nAt Langston's apartment, Dorian tried to get Langston to tell the truth about what happened with Ford. \"Did you attack Ford last night?\" Dorian asked her daughter. She explained that she couldn't help Langston without the truth and she wanted Langston to trust her. She assured Langston that she was hurt if Langston was and she realized that Ford hadn't treated Langston properly. She thought that Langston was a special person.\n\n\nLangston wondered how she could have messed up so badly if she were special like Dorian claimed. Dorian just thought that Ford shouldn't have hurt Langston the way he did but he deserved whatever happened to him. At that moment, John's colleague, Detective Price, walked into the apartment. He announced that he was searching for Markko. \n\n\nDorian gave the detective a difficult time when he began to ask Langston questions and she advised Langston not to provide any answers. Langston blurted out that nothing was Markko's fault but Dorian cut her off before Langston could say anything else. Dorian wanted Langston to wait until she had a lawyer. Dorian dismissed Price and told her daughter that it wasn't a good idea to say anything but she would always stand up for Langston. \n\n\nLangston divulged the events that occurred in Ford's apartment after Markko had walked in. Ford then dumped her and she had left. Dorian asked Langston if Ford was okay when she left and if she had been \"angry enough to bash his head in.\" Langston assured her mother she hadn't hurt Ford but Dorian wondered if that was the last time that Langston had seen Ford. Langston admitted that she had returned to Ford's apartment later that night because she couldn't believe what Ford had done to her. She never made it though because she realized he would only tell her the same thing again. He had been using her, Langston stated as she walked out of the apartment. Dorian grabbed her cell phone and made a call. She told the person on the other end that she wanted to see them. \n\n\nShortly after, Elijah walked in and Dorian told him that Langston had a relationship with Ford. Elijah asked what kind and Dorian told him \"the worst kind.\" Langston returned to the apartment and accused Dorian of not believing her. \n\n\nJohn ran into Markko as John stepped off of the elevator at the hospital. He wanted to know what had happened to Markko's hand and Markko reluctantly told him that he had sprained it when he banged it on a wall. When the doctor walked by and asked what time Markko had hurt his hand the previous evening, John perked up. The doctor related that Markko most likely hurt his hand in a fight and the pain had been delayed. After the doctor walked off, John pressed Markko for more information. Finally, Markko confessed that he had hit Ford. \n\n\nJohn asked more questions but Markko was pretty certain that John already knew the details of what had happened. He explained that Langston and Ford were sleeping together and he had learned about it at the prom. He went to Ford's place and hit him but Langston had separated the men after that. He left because he thought it was pretty clear that Langston wanted to be with Ford. \n\n\nDetective Price arrived, pulled John aside and told him he had seen Langston but she \"lawyered up.\" Dorian had been there and wouldn't let Langston talk. John admitted that he believed Markko's story but he wondered when Langston had left Ford's apartment. John returned to Markko for more questioning. Markko explained that he had gone to the diner and that Layla and Cristian could vouch for him. \n\n\nJohn asked what happened after the couple left the diner and Markko declared that he had gone to sleep there, not leaving until the morning when his hand began to ache. Price asked if Markko had left at all during the night but Markko insisted he hadn't. John appeared skeptical as Markko remembered washing what looked like blood off of his hands. Out loud, he repeated that he had not left the diner. John thanked Markko for his help and requested that Markko call him if he had anything else to tell him. \n\n\nAs Markko stepped onto the elevator, both John and Price agreed that Markko had been lying. John would pursue a warrant for the diner and he vowed to find the person who had landed Ford in the hospital. He urged Price to get a statement from the doctor who had looked at Markko. Jessica arrived and stood around the corner from the men sight unseen as she listened to their comments.\n\n\nIn New Mexico, Gigi was hard-pressed to believe that Rick had merely dumped Lili thirty years in the past and she was positive that they were missing some important details. She handed Rex another letter written in Lili's hand that stated, \"I'm having your baby.\" \n\n\nIn Atlantic City thirty years ago, another man read that letter from Lili as he stood in his office. When Rick walked into the office, the man, Pete, was angry and accused Rick of breaking up with his daughter to date the \"Indian whore.\" Rick assured Pete that he had paid off his parent's debt and he was finished with Pete and the casino. Pete retorted that Rick would have his debt paid off when Pete decided it was paid off. He then stood over Rick and demanded that he write a break-up letter to Lili. Rick refused but Pete threatened Rick's father's life. Rick had no choice and wrote as Pete dictated. He told Lili that he was with someone else, had never loved Lili and he didn't want her to contact him again.\n\n\nLili cried as she read the letter and a young Otto urged her to forget about Rick. Back to present day and Gigi was certain that they didn't know the entire story. Just then, Otto walked into the cabin. He knew that he would find Rex and Gigi there and he was livid. Rex suggested that Otto have Rex arrested but he wanted Gigi left out of it. Rex apologized for being in the cabin but he was unaware that anyone lived there. Otto told him he had no right to be there reading the letters they had found. He ordered Rex and Gigi to leave because he didn't care about their questions. \n\n\nGigi accused him of lying. She knew he really cared and she told him all they had learned from reading the letters. Rex believed that Otto knew the entire story and finally but reluctantly, Otto spoke up. He admitted that Rick and Lili were Rex's parents but \"I destroyed them,\" he confessed. He was ashamed and told them about a phone call he had answered for Lili when Rick had called. Rick had sworn he'd be back for Lili but Otto had lied to her and told her Rick had merely called to make sure Lili had understood his last letter telling her to forget him. Otto had been young and jealous and he loved Lili himself. Rick did return eventually but the couple never got back together, Otto told them. \n\n\nLili knew that Rick would have wanted to see their son even though Otto tried to convince her otherwise. Things changed after the baby was born and one week later, Lili was gone, Otto continued. She fled to Atlantic City and tried to see Rick but Pete was there and told her Rick was dead and that he had killed him for cheating on Pete's daughter. He stated that Lili wasn't the first \"tramp\" Rick had gotten pregnant and he had cheated many times. Lili asked to see Rick's grave but Pete assured her he had dumped Rick's body in the Pine Barrens. He ordered her out of his office. After she was gone, Rick emerged from another room but Pete didn't tell him that Lili had been there. \n\n\nOtto continued with his story and explained that Rick had returned to Santa Fe but in the meantime, Lili had dropped her baby off at the hospital and tucked her necklace into his blanket. Rex wanted to know if Rick had tried to find Lili and what had happened when Rick returned. Time flashed back to 1980 Atlantic City where Pete tried to prevent Rick from leaving. He pointed out that Rick's wedding would be happening soon. Rick advised Pete that when his parents heard that they had a grandchild they told Rick not to worry about them. Even Pete's daughter threatened Pete and told him to leave Rick alone along with everyone who Rick cared about. \n\n\nOtto sighed that Rick and Lili never saw each other again. By the time Rick returned to Santa Fe, Otto took him to Lili's gravesite. Lili had given up and had died of a broken heart. She wasn't interested in Otto. Rex wondered what happened to Rick's son but Otto assured him that Rick had returned without the baby. He tried to look for him but the baby was probably dead. As Otto, Rex and Gigi stood at Lili's grave, Rex proclaimed that he wasn't dead, but was standing there.\n\n\nOtto made it clear that Rick left Santa Fe and he never heard from him again. He apologized for not knowing the end of the story. Gigi stated that at least they knew that Lili had taken Rex to the hospital for safety and had left her necklace for him. Rex pulled the necklace from his pocket and placed it on Lili's grave. He was ready to return to Llanview. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Gigi and Rex go to a vacant house in their search for his parents and find a cradle with the river symbol engraved on it. Rex finds a stack of love letters to \"Lily\" from \"Rick.\" The last letter says that Rick doesn't love Lily anymore. Gigi observes that the letter doesn't sound like the same person wrote it. She thinks there has to be more to the story. Cristian goes with Ford to the hospital after finding him beaten at their apartment. Markko is there having his hand looked at, so Cristian tells him what happened. Cristian says he had to tell the police about how angry Markko was at Ford for sleeping with Langston. John explains to Dorian that it appears that someone tried to beat Ford to death with one of his awards and that he wants to talk to Langston. Meanwhile, Langston tells Blair about the way her affair with Ford ended. When Blair tells her that Ford will get what's coming to him, Langston says he already has. Dorian goes home and tells Blair and Langston that someone tried to kill Ford. Jessica tells Natalie that she has her memory back and apologizes for accusing her of stealing her man. She asks her about getting back together with John so Natalie recounts the events of last night, carefully omitting the part where she slept with Brody. Natalie asks Jessica what triggered her memory returning, but Jessica omits the part about sleeping with Ford. When Jessica says that she owes Layla and Cristian an apology, Natalie suggests that they go over there, but Jessica abruptly says she can't go over there. Jessica turns on the TV and sees the news story about Ford. Cristian tells Markko that he looks guilty hanging around the hospital with an injured hand. He tells him to go home and call Tea because he will need a lawyer whether he did it or not. Meanwhile, At Todd's arraignment, Tea asks the judge to drop all charges against Todd. The judge determines that the prosecution has enough evidence for the case to proceed. Todd calls one of his sources and discovers that Hanna has disappeared. When the elevator that Markko is waiting for at the hospital opens, John is on it.",
