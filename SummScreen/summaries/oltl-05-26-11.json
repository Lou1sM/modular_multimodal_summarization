    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Statesville, Vimal hope that T\u00e9a could help him get out of prison in light of Clint's confession. T\u00e9a informed Vimal that it wouldn't be that easy. She would have to make a case for coercion. Vimal said that he had to get out, especially since Rama was pregnant. T\u00e9a was surprised to learn of Rama's pregnancy. Vimal continued that the baby had been the only thing that had helped Rama convince Vimal to plead guilty. Rama had thought that pleading guilty would put the Patels on Clint's generous side.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was also surprised to learn that Rama had been the once to convince Vimal to plead guilty. Vimal related that Rama was very persuasive, and that he understood that it was for the sake of providing for the baby. Vimal wondered if Clint would really repay Vimal for taking the blame. T\u00e9a thought that Clint was difficult to figure out. She promised to try to help Vimal get out of prison, and left.\n\n\nAt the diner, Cristian offered Rama a refill on coffee, which she accepted. She related that she didn't normally drink coffee at night, but she couldn't sleep anyway, with Vimal in prison. Cristian thought it was good news that Clint had confessed to changing the DNA tests. He suggested that maybe Vimal had served enough time, so he would be let out. Looking melancholy, Rama hoped Cristian was right. Cristian wondered why she didn't look happy. She confessed that, even if Vimal got released from prison, she still had another problem.\n\n\nCristian was surprised to learn that Rama still hadn't told Vimal that she wasn't really pregnant. He urged her to do so. Cristian believed that Vimal would be so happy to be out of prison, he wouldn't be angry at Rama for lying. He continued that Vimal was lucky, because not every guy had a woman like Rama to go home to. Cristian thought that Rama would feel better once she talked to Vimal, so he advised her to go to Statesville.\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a sat in the diner, reviewing Vimal's file. Cristian walked over to T\u00e9a and noticed whose file she was looking at. He related that Rama had been at the diner, wondering if Clint's confession would set Vimal free. T\u00e9a revealed that she was hoping to have the case reopened, because she'd hate to see Vimal behind bars while his wife was pregnant. Noticing Cristian's strange reaction to the statement, a suspicious T\u00e9a asked what was wrong. Cristian stated that it was between Rama and Vimal.\n\n\nVimal was thrilled to see Rama at Statesville. He told his wife that T\u00e9a was going to do everything she could to get Vimal out of prison. He carried on that it was torture to be in prison while he should be with his pregnant wife. Suddenly, Rama interrupted Vimal. She motioned for him to sit down, so he did. \"I have something to tell you,\" she confessed.\n\n\nBrody was instructing a fellow officer on how to question witnesses in the Marty case, when John entered. John told Brody that Clint's million-dollar offer had \"every crackpot in town\" calling. Brody updated John on Brody's trip to Todd's house. John related that, if Bess had been telling the truth, it wouldn't be the first time that Todd had hidden Marty in his house.\n\n\nBrody wondered why Todd would want to help Marty, because Todd and Marty couldn't stand each other. John wanted to \"have a conversation\" with Todd. Brody had to see Natalie, but he didn't know how to tell her that he hadn't yet found Liam. John was confident that they would find Liam, but until then, he knew that Natalie was strong enough to deal with it.\n\n\nBrody knew that it wasn't easy for John to look for Liam. Brody couldn't believe that he'd blamed Liam's kidnapping on John. John understood, and brushed it off. Brody appreciated all of John's hard work. John claimed that he was only doing his job, just like Brody was.\n\n\nTodd stood in his doorway as Marty walked up to him. He informed her that the cops had just been there looking for her. He wondered what she wanted. She walked away to get Liam, and said that she was looking for Todd's hospitality. Todd suggested that Marty get a cell at Statesville instead. He called her crazy, and went into his house. Marty followed him in.\n\n\nTodd picked up the phone, but Marty stated that he wasn't going to turn her in. She pulled out her gun, and Todd put the phone down. Todd dared Marty to shoot him, because it was what she'd always wanted to do. He reminded her that he'd recently survived a gunshot. He also said it would be \"unsportsmanlike\" to shoot him from such a close range. She gripped the gun tighter, but refused to shoot him. She claimed to have \"better ways\" than violence to keep him from calling the cops.\n\n\nMarty said that, if Todd called the police, she would reveal to everyone what she knew about Todd and Tomas. He suggested that she get better information if she intended to blackmail him. Marty confessed that she'd been staying in Todd's pool house. She had seen Todd and Tomas arguing about the disc earlier. She wondered how important the disc was to Todd. Todd immediately went to his computer to get the disc, but it wasn't there.\n\n\nTodd demanded that Marty give him the disc, but she promised that it was somewhere safe. There was a pounding on the door, and John called out for Todd to open the door. As Marty hid in the living room with a sleeping Liam, Todd opened the door. John claimed to be there on behalf of the police department to apologize to Todd for Brody's conduct . Todd knew that John was only there to check up on Todd. Todd said that he'd been harassed enough that day, so he would sue the department if the police didn't \"back off.\"\n\n\nTodd closed the door on John, and returned to Marty. Marty urged Todd to keep quiet, or everyone would know his secrets. She said that Todd would wish he was dead, and she left for the pool house.\n\n\nRoxy entered Natalie's hospital room, saying that she'd taken the first available flight back to Llanview. Roxy hugged Natalie, and told her about the \"hot streak\" Roxy had been having in Las Vegas. Natalie related that Rex shouldn't have called Roxy. Roxy cried that she would rather be with Natalie in the hospital. Roxy stated that Marty was crazy, but wouldn't have Liam for long. Roxy confided that she knew how to find out where Liam was.\n\n\nTo Natalie's surprise, Madame Delphina entered. Natalie said she needed law enforcement, not a psychic. She related that John and Brody were on the case. Roxy thought that the men could use help. Natalie asked Delphina if she could find Liam. Delphina promised to try, and asked for something that belonged to Liam. Natalie handed Liam's sock to Delphina. Delphina smelled the sock, and said, \"Uh-oh.\"\n\n\nMadame Delphina saw that Liam was all right, but that there was a gun in the same room as Liam. Natalie wondered where Liam was, and who he was with. Delphina couldn't see where Liam was, but saw that he was with a woman who had \"static coming out of her head.\" She continued that there was another person, but the person was \"wearing a mask.\"\n\n\nMadame Delphina could see that Liam's father was doing all he could to find the baby. The father wouldn't give up easily, but the search wasn't easy on him. Roxy related that Brody loved his son. Confused at the mention of Brody, Delphina said there was something \"screwy,\" but she couldn't put her finger on what it was.\n\n\nMadame Delphina assured Natalie that Liam hadn't been hurt. Roxy chimed in that Marty had hurt Natalie, but Natalie didn't remember it. Natalie wondered if Delphina could help her remember. Delphina placed her hands on the sides on Natalie's head. She saw Natalie and Marty arguing about the baby, and something to do with the baby's father.\n\n\nSuddenly, there was a knock on the door, and Brody entered. Natalie urgently asked if he had found Liam, but Brody told her not to lose hope. Madame Delphina introduced herself, and wondered why Brody was there. She maintained that Liam's father should be there. Brody replied that Delphina needed a \"tune-up\" if she couldn't see that he was Liam's father. Natalie let Brody know about Delphina's visions regarding Liam's safety.\n\n\nNatalie asked if Madame Delphina could continue helping her remember what had happened with Marty. However, Delphina said that Brody's entrance had thrown her off. Brody called her a fake. \"If you know so much,\" Delphina started, \"why were you kissing your fianc\u00e9e's sister?\" Roxy laughed, but was surprised to learn the truth from Natalie and Brody's solemn expressions.\n\n\nRealizing that Madame Delphina might not be a fake, Brody asked if she saw Todd anywhere near Liam. Roxy handed Delphina a copy of Todd's newspaper, despite Natalie's confusion. Madame Delphina didn't see Todd anywhere near Liam. Natalie thanked Delphina, and Delphina left the room. Roxy followed her out. Natalie told Brody that Madame Delphina had given her hope. She asked Brody why he had mentioned Todd. Brody admitted that Todd could be involved with Marty.\n\n\nOutside the room, Roxy thanked Madame Delphina. Delphina told Roxy to let her know what happened with Liam, and walked away.\n\n\nJames took the room key from the desk, and walked away with Starr. The couple ran into Blair and Tomas. \"What are you doing here?\" Blair and Starr cried in unison. As James put the room key in his pocket, Starr stammered that they were going to eat since James had gotten a discount for working on Renee's car. Blair said that she and Tomas were there for the same thing, and the two couples went their separate ways. \"So much for alone time,\" James said glumly.\n\n\nA short while later, the waiter delivered an appetizer to James and Starr's table. Both agreed that they weren't hungry after eating a big dinner. James suggested that they make a break for it to the elevator, but Starr thought it would be awkward with Blair sitting a table away. James joked that Starr had a daughter, so Blair already knew that Starr wasn't a virgin. Starr wanted to wait to get up from the table until Blair and Tomas finished their drinks and left. James agreed, and kissed his girlfriend.\n\n\nBlair told Tomas that they only needed to have one drink. Tomas wondered if Starr liked him. Blair admitted that Starr had basically told her to \"go for it\" with Tomas. He wanted to go upstairs, but Blair told him that they needed to wait until the kids finished their food. A short while later, Blair wondered if Starr and James were glued to their chairs. Tomas had a plan. He suggested that he would pretend to leave, but really go to the desk to get them a room. He would text Blair the room number, so Blair could meet him in the room.\n\n\nA short while later, James and Starr wondered why Blair and Tomas were still at their table. James brainstormed that he would pretend to leave, but really get on the elevator. He said that she could meet him in room 601. Starr liked the idea, so James left.\n\n\nSeeing James get up and leave, Blair and Tomas got up from their table, and kissed goodnight. Tomas left, and Starr walked over to her mother. Starr lied that James had gone to get the car. Blair lied that Tomas had to go home. Starr said goodnight, and walked away. When Blair was distracted looking at Tomas' text with the room number 431, Starr ran past Blair, toward the elevators.\n\n\nStarr got in the elevator, and was shocked to see Tomas. She wondered what he was doing there, because Blair had said that Tomas had needed to go home. Both related that they knew why the other was there. Starr told Tomas that her mother had been through a lot, so she hoped that Tomas was \"everything you say you are.\" Tomas promised not to hurt Blair. Tomas got off the elevator at his floor. \"For the record,\" he told Starr, \"I never saw you.\"\n\n\nBlair got in the elevator, and was shocked to James. She had thought that James was getting the car. James lied that the parking attendant had told him about a great view on the roof of the hotel. Seeing right through him, Blair only hoped that James would be good to Starr. He promised. Blair got off the elevator and told him that she'd never seen him.\n\n\nA short while later, Starr knocked on the door of room 601. James let her in, and the two were happy to finally be alone. Starr stated, \"What my mom doesn't know won't hurt her.\" Both were nervous as Starr said, \"This is it.\" James told her that it was just the beginning, and kissed her.\n\n\nBlair entered room 431, and Tomas grabbed her from behind. Blair said that what Starr didn't know wouldn't hurt her. Tomas said that Blair was entitled to a few secrets, and kissed her. The two reminisced about what had almost happened during their date at Capricorn. Blair told Tomas she'd be right back, and walked toward the bathroom. Tomas sat on the bed, and took his phone out of his pocket, as it began to ring. He read that it was Todd calling.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr and James are determined to have a night alone and he finds her a hotel where he can get a good rate and they can be alone and unseen. But it just so happens that Blair and Tomas are ready to do the same thing. The two \"couples\" run into each other. And there is \"awkwardness\" with mother and daughter not wanting to know what the other is doing. Tomas then leaves the table to get a room and meet Blair later, as does James for Starr. And it just so happens that Starr and Tomas get into the same elevator as do Blair and James. They have found each other out although both guys promise not to tell his date what he found out about the other. Roxy invites Madame Delphina to help Natalie find her baby when the cops cannot help her. Natalie does not trust a psychic. But she seems to know some things that nobody else can figure out. She also knows that Brody is not \"involved\" in this. She reveals she knows that Natalie and Brody were kissing not long ago and thereby convinces them that she knows what she is talking about. Marty goes to find Todd and \"persuades\" him to hide her and baby Liam at his home revealing that she knows his and Tomas Delgado's secret and will reveal it and ruin Todd's life if he does not do what she wants.",
