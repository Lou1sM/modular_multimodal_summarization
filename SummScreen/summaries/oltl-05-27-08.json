    "soap_central": "\nHead On Collisions\n\n\nAt the crash site in Angel Square, Marcie and Michael rushed to the scene and split up, each checking one of the two cars. Michael tended to Adriana's wounded leg, while Marcie was shocked to discover Sam sitting unharmed in Todd's passenger side-without a baby car seat. While Todd was still unconscious, Marcie scooped \"Tommy\" out of the car and held her former son to her, checking him for injuries and calming him. Michael asked Adriana what she'd been doing out on the road, and Adriana flashed back to her discovery of Dorian's betrayal and said she'd just had \"a really bad night.\" When Michael headed over to the other car and roused Todd, Todd woke to see his son back in Marcie's arms. \n\n\nOutside the barn at the Buchanan mansion, Jared and Natalie enjoyed a heated make out session, which Jared forced them to stop, insisting that they had to wait for Charlie's word that he had told Viki the truth before they dropped the bombshell on the rest of the family. When they went into the barn to check on David for the night, they found his bonds untied and no David-only a note scratched into the wall of the barn: \"NICE TRY-OFF TO RAT YOU OUT.\" \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian was setting up mysterious plans on her cell phone when she heard David in the foyer. Shawn dragged David (clad only in overalls from the Buchanan stables) into the drawing room, where David hurriedly told Dorian that he was on the run and needed her help. Dorian called him a clown, and David took offense: \"I'm not a clown. I've done mime. There's a difference.\" He begged the irritated Dorian to hide him, calling her \"the east to my west, the yin to my yang, the rich to my...ehhh\" -perhaps even his true love. David insisted he was onto a big score, which was why he was a fugitive in Llanview. Dorian rebuffed David's advances and said she was into her own schemes without him, and David asked to be cut in. He offered up the truth about Jared, but Dorian yawned and said she already knew. Dorian warned David that she had her own ideas for that secret and told him not to spill the beans. She was thrilled when David revealed that Jared and Natalie were engaging in \"the love that dare not speak its name,\" realizing that it would make Viki's misery even worse. David told her that Jared and Natalie were going to break the news to the family soon and Dorian realized that the timeframe for her vengeance was critical. They agreed to a \"75/20\" split of the profits from Dorian's master plan for Jared and the Buchanans. When Dorian got the call from the hospital about Adriana's crash, she rushed off, leaving David alone in La Boulaie. \n\n\nDavid promptly called Jared and Natalie to taunt them about his escape. At the Buchanan estate, Jared and Natalie reunited after their frantic search for Vickers just in time to take the call. David warned them that they'd had their chance to play it his way and that he was onto something bigger than mere blackmail. As he berated the lovers for tying him to a chair wearing only a Speedo, David's tirade was interrupted by a lascivious Addie. David hung up, leaving Jared and Natalie puzzling over his location. Jared insisted that they had to wait on Charlie's confirmation before breaking the truth to the Buchanans, and Natalie got a hunch on where David might be. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki was still reeling from Charlie's confession when Gigi entered, feeling foolish and expecting a tongue-lashing for her recent behavior at the wedding. Viki reassured Gigi, encouraging her to take comfort in having told the truth about her feelings for Rex and then suggested she move on. She asked about Brody, and Gigi said he was staying with her and that relations were strained, that Brody was not the same man he used to be. \"Yeah, but at least he's Shane's dad, right?\" Viki asked, and the rhetorical, implied question put Gigi on edge. Viki vented about Charlie's lie regarding Rex. She couldn't understand why Charlie would lie for Roxy, just to make her child happy. Gigi, sensing parallels to her quandary with Brody, Shane, and Rex, began to make excuses for Charlie, saying Roxy must have had her reasons and that Charlie was still a good man. Gigi explained that \"people [fell] into lies,\" and then were unable to extricate themselves from them because too many people would be hurt. She suspected Charlie enjoyed the relationship with Rex that he was unable to have with his own son. Gigi said she knew how it was to \"[try] to make things right, but everything kept stopping me.\" \n\n\nAt the Balsom loft, Charlie struggled to explain \"what I am\" to Rex, but Rex continued to interrupt, making quick assumptions about Charlie's topic of discussion. Charlie managed to explain that he had never had an affair with Roxy, but before he could explain that he'd never slept with Roxy at all, Rex's phone rang. Rex was shocked to hear from Adriana about the car accident, and he and Charlie rushed to Llanview Hospital to meet her there. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Adriana and Todd were wheeled in, bickering about who caused their crash. Todd became violent and struggled to fight his way off his gurney when he saw Marcie and Michael taking Sam off to be checked out. Later, Todd slunk out into the hospital waiting room to confront Marcie while Sam was being examined. Marcie berated Todd for leaving Sam without a car seat and told him that the judge had been wrong-he had no right to be \"Tommy's\" father. She stalked off to call John, and Todd collapsed to the floor in pain. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, David was both befuddled and aroused by the \"new\" and flirtatious Addie. \"When they take you back to the home for the bewildered, please don't tell the nuns I hit on you,\" David pleaded. In response, Addie planted a passionate kiss on David's lips as a \"welcome home.\" Addie explained to David that she was sane and rational, ready to live life and make up for all her lost time, doing all the important and exciting things she'd written down on her \"life list.\" Addie teased David about her exotic yoga practices, and David suggested they do it naked. \n\n\nRex and Charlie arrived to see Adriana at the hospital, where she was little worse for the wear despite her injured leg. Alone with her husband, Adriana covered when Rex questioned her being in Angel Square when she'd claimed she was just going around the corner for eggs. Before Adriana could make an excuse, Dorian arrived, sending Rex out of the room. Adriana told Dorian she knew about her scheme to destroy Rex and Adriana's wedding, and unloaded her fury on her, unwilling to believe her denials. When Rex and Charlie returned, Dorian was perturbed to see her co-conspirator. Adriana ignored Dorian's overtures and asked Rex to take her home. Rex complied, leaving Dorian and Charlie alone and at odds in the hospital room. \n\n\nJared headed for La Boulaie, where he argued with Shawn about gaining access to the ladies of the house so he could ascertain David's whereabouts. Shawn agreed to check the grounds. Once the bodyguard left, Jared entered the drawing room, only to find Addie and her yoga instructor bending and twisting. Addie assured Jared she'd seen no \"dangerous men\" on the property, while David hid behind the couch. Jared left, asking Shawn to call if he saw his quarry. Back in the drawing room, David came out from his hiding place and assumed a yoga stance alongside Addie and her attractive female instructor. Addie said that all the heated exertion had made her eager to try \"number sixty-six\" on her \"list,\" and asked a gleeful David if he'd ever heard of a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. \n\n\nBack in his room at the hospital, Todd called a lackey at The Sun and made arrangements to have a baby car seat bought and planted in his wrecked vehicle immediately. \n\n\nAt the loft, Rex helped Adriana put her leg up. While searching her hospital belongings package for her prescription, he discovered his toothbrush amongst Adriana's things. Rex asked Adriana what she was doing with his brush, and why she was really out on the road that night. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie arrived to see Viki, and was disappointed to learn David hadn't doubled back to the house. Viki tearfully recounted her argument with Charlie, explaining that he'd been lying to her for months, and Natalie apologized to Viki. Viki said Natalie hadn't had anything to do with it, but Natalie sorrowfully replied, \"I did.\" \n\n\nIn Adriana's hospital room, Dorian and Charlie battled it out. Charlie said that Adriana's accident had only briefly delayed his coming clean to Viki once and for all, and that Jared and Natalie had already set events into motion. Dorian warned Charlie that he wouldn't be telling anyone the whole truth, and Charlie responded by preparing to call Viki then and there. Desperate to stop him, Dorian grabbed a syringe containing a sedative off a nearby medical tray and injected Charlie with it, watching him collapse unconscious onto the bed. \n\n\nIn the hospital lobby, Marcie finished putting in a call to John. Michael and Marcie were pleased when Sam turned out to have suffered no injury from the crash. Marcie was thrilled to be holding her \"son\" again, delighted to realize that he remembered her. The worried Michael reminded her that they couldn't take him, and had to call Blair as next of kin. Marcie assured Michael that she understood. As Michael left to call Blair, Todd stormed back in, demanding that Marcie give him back his son. \"No,\" Marcie growled. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Todd and Adriana collide and Michael rushes them both to the hospital, the first thing Marcie is concerned about is that Sam (previously Tommy) is ok. And when she notices that Todd transported him without even a child safety seat, she rips into him and is ready to call the cops and get him into serious trouble. Michael is concerned that his wife is growing too attached to Sam and that it will damage her when Todd takes him home, yet again. David Vickers finds his way to Dorian's home. She is angry at him. But Addie reveals that she is attracted to David and might be interested in him. Viki admits to Natalie that she is devastated that she trusted Charlie but found out that he lied to her about Rex being his son. Natalie and Jared still both wonder what they are going to do in regard to revealing the whole truth to everybody. Rex still is unaware that Charlie lied about being his father, but he knows that Adriana is doing things behind his back and keeping secrets from him.",
