    "soap_central": "\nWhat Happens In The Boiler Room...\n\n\n \nJohn escorted Marty back to her suite at the Palace Hotel. Marty was still exhilarated by the news about Hope, and couldn't believe Cole was getting a second chance at raising his daughter. Marty told John she remembered how much she loved her son, and that her memories were returning with rapid speed. \n\n\nJohn moved to leave, but Marty stopped him by asking about their shared fondness for making paper airplanes, and their previous relationship. John played it off, but as Marty teased him about the airplanes, their close proximity led to a passionate kiss. \n\n\nJohn and Marty moved into the bedroom and hit the sheets, but before they could go further, they stopped themselves. John told Marty he cared for her, but his marriage to Blair had to mean something, as she was just getting out of the hospital. Marty assented, and said that Cole would need her with Hope back in their lives. But, she said with a smile, \"You're still a really good kisser.\" \n\n\nMarty walked John to her door, and bid him goodnight. John told her not to worry about Hope. He couldn't help but pull her into another embrace, whispering, \"Welcome back.\" After he left, John and Marty found themselves on opposite ends of the closed door, grappling with their emotions. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston and Markko returned home from their prom getaway, deliriously happy. Dorian interrupted their bliss, and told them she had shocking news about Lola. Dorian explained that Lola had been responsible for puncturing Langston's condoms, and revealed that Lola had killed her own mother and allowed Ray to take the rap for it. Dorian told the kids that Lola was being treated at St. Anne's, with Ray watching over her, and she didn't know what would happen next. \n\n\nLangston and Markko returned to the foyer, stunned by the news. Markko brightened their spirits by saying that no matter what had happened, it couldn't compare to their wonderful night together. The teens struggled to keep their hands off each other long enough for Markko to say a painful goodnight. \n\n\nAfter Markko was gone, Langston joined Dorian on the patio. When questioned about her prom experience, Langston told her foster mother they'd used his condoms, and that was all she'd say about it. Dorian told Langston that Markko was a wonderful young man who reminded her of Ray, and said that Ray had impressed her with how he'd handled the Lola situation. Langston was shocked to realize Dorian had been developing warmer feelings for \"Uncle Ray\" for some time, but Dorian told Langston she was keeping the details to herself for the time being. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Todd and Blair arrived to visit T\u00e9a. Todd told Blair she didn't have to accompany him, but a nervous Blair said that she and T\u00e9a had shared something during their imprisonment in the Kappa Alpha Delta boiler room, and she wanted to speak to T\u00e9a, as well. Blair suggested Todd go in first. \n\n\nTodd entered T\u00e9a's room, and woke her up. The battered attorney greeted Todd with a smile, and asked what had happened. Todd explained that Rebecca had brought the house down with a gas explosion, but had only killed herself. He reassured T\u00e9a that she would make a full recovery. Todd joked that for a moment during the crisis, he hadn't been sure that T\u00e9a would not have shot him like Powell wanted her to. T\u00e9a told Todd that he was a bastard, but she could never hurt him. Todd asked her about the boiler room and her experience with Blair, but T\u00e9a remained silent. \n\n\nBlair watched Todd comfort T\u00e9a from outside the hospital room, but couldn't contain her nerves for long. Entering the room, she took her turn with T\u00e9a. Once Todd left, T\u00e9a told Blair her secret was safe: Todd would never know they both considered him their one true love. Blair played dumb, but T\u00e9a told her there was no sense in denying what they'd spoken of. Blair turned the tables by asking T\u00e9a to confess her own deep, dark, unspoken secret. T\u00e9a responded by saying that it was best that they forget everything that had happened in the boiler room, and pretend it had never happened. Blair said it was a deal. \n\n\nTodd entered just in time to hear the ladies strike their bargain, though he didn't know about what. Blair and T\u00e9a claimed they'd agreed to stop insulting each other. They began trading barbs as Todd grew concerned about T\u00e9a's well-being, while Blair seethed with jealousy. T\u00e9a admitted that she didn't know who'd take care of her during her convalescence. Todd said that he would. \n\n\nAs Todd and Blair prepared to leave, T\u00e9a stopped Blair on her way out. With the women alone together again, Blair tried once more to get T\u00e9a's big secret out of her, to no avail. T\u00e9a warned Blair to remember their vow: \"What happens in the boiler room stays in the boiler room.\" Blair agreed to keep her word if T\u00e9a kept hers, and walked out. \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy was dumbstruck when Rex confronted her about Stan. Rex warned her that he wanted the truth or he'd throw her out. Under pressure, Stacy admitted that Stan had been her boss in Las Vegas, and that she had stolen twenty thousand dollars from him, but she said it was merely the money Stan owed her. Stacy claimed that Stan had been taking a commission out of the dancers' salaries, and bullied them to keep them in line. She said that before she'd left Vegas, she'd calculated what Stan owed her, and had taken it for herself. \n\n\nRex grudgingly accepted Stacy's explanation, and said he could understand wanting to take one's power back from a user. He grabbed the phone, suggesting they call Bo and the Llanview Police Department to take care of Stan once and for all. \"No!\" Stacy cried. She told Rex that Stan was a well-connected criminal, and that going to the police could put their entire family in danger. \n\n\nRex suggested they simply give Stan his money back, but Stacy, having given the cash to Kyle Lewis for bail money, said she couldn't. She claimed Schuyler had stolen it during her stay at his place. Stacy told Rex that Schuyler was a hardened drug addict who had been suspended from his teaching job for lewd conduct with a student, and had probably already spent the money on drugs. Out of options, the gullible Rex agreed to give Stan twenty thousand dollars out of his own funds to get Stan off Stacy's back. \n\n\nAs Rex and Stacy prepared for bed, Stacy told Rex how grateful she was for his kindness and generosity. Rex told Stacy not to worry, and headed for bed. \n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi asked Schuyler to elaborate on his claims about Stacy possibly not being Shane's bone marrow donor. Schuyler explained that he'd seen Stacy drop an \"extra\" bag of blood and stem cells into a medical waste bin at the hospital, and then proven her to be a liar about it. He told Gigi he believed that Stacy had switched her donor sample for someone else's on the day of the transplant, and said he had kept the bag of blood in order to investigate his claim. \n\n\nGigi was grossed out that Schuyler had kept the bag of blood, but Schuyler insisted he was not the stalker Stacy made him out to be. He said his love for Stacy was in the past, as he'd discovered she was an obsessive manipulator who would do anything to get what she wanted. He told Gigi he believed that Stacy had brokered a deal with someone to switch her stem cells out for someone else's, and was prepared to test the bag of blood against Shane to see if they were a match; if not, Stacy could not possibly be Shane's bone marrow donor. \n\n\nGigi was overjoyed that Stacy couldn't hold Shane's life over Gigi's head, and was determined to call Rex immediately. Schuyler stopped her, reminding her they needed confirmation and proof; he suggested they go to the lab in the morning to run the compatibility tests on Stacy and Shane's blood. Gigi agreed, and said her promise to God for Shane's life had been built on Stacy's lies. When she had proof, she promised \"that bitch is history!\" Schuyler realized that Gigi hated her sister, but admitted he still cared for Stacy, and felt she needed help. \n\n\nGigi walked Schuyler out, and Schuyler told her he'd pick her up in the morning to go to the hospital and run the tests. Gigi was excited by the thought of finally getting her life back, and thanked Schuyler for his help. She couldn't help but wonder, however, if Stacy wasn't the donor, who the donor could be. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Kyle returned home despite the protests of the indignant Roxy, who didn't want a criminal under her roof. \"You're an extortioner and a blackmailist!\" Roxy howled. Kyle told Roxy he was out on bail, innocent of the charges against him, and that she'd let him keep living on the premises unless she wanted her role in Stacy's scheme to come out. \n\n\nRoxy accused Kyle of being wrapped up in Rebecca and Powell's murder spree, but Kyle said he hadn't been close to his sister and had nothing to do with their crimes. He snatched his room key from Roxy, and reminded her that they were in the same bind together. Roxy told him that \"John Doe\" was dead and the topic of their secret was closed, for good. \n\n\nAs Kyle headed upstairs, Roxy turned to her closest confidant, Morris, the stuffed beaver. Roxy told Morris she'd been sure that with Rex's father dead, her torment would be over, but the secret seemed to keep getting dredged up. Roxy asked her friend where it would end. Predictably, Morris had no answer. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex realizes Stacy is lying to him about knowing Stan. Schuyler tells Gigi that Stacy wasn't Shane's donor; that she threw out her blood. Gigi realizes that means that if she can get the proof for Rex, that they can be together again and she can have her life back. Dorian tells Langston and Markko that Lola killed her mother and is in St. Ann's. Kyle blackmails Roxy into giving him a free room by telling her if she doesn't, that he will spill the beans about the stem cells. Todd visits Tea in the hospital, as does Blair. Todd tells Tea he will take care of her. John and Marty almost make love until he remembers that he is married to Blair.",
