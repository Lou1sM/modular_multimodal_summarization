    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the jail, Starr told Cole, who was still in his cell, that Hope was staying with \"Aunt Dorian.\"  After Cole and Starr commented about their wonderful time at the prom, Cole regretted that he had not spent more time hanging out with Markko, because Markko had been \"too busy tearing up the town with Langston.\"  Starr slyly remarked, \"That's one way to put it.\"  Cole indicated that when everything calmed down, he wanted to spend more time with Markko.\n\n\nCole then revealed that he was aware that Todd had been released on bail.  Cole expressed his hope that Todd would have taken a plea or would have admitted to his wrongdoing for once, but Starr asked why her father should have to take a plea for something that he did not do.  When Cole reminded Starr that Todd had pushed Marty down the stairs, and that Hannah had witnessed it, Starr insisted that even though Cole trusted Hannah, she did not.  Starr realized that Cole was angry and frustrated about what had happened to his mother, but stressed that he still should not have beaten up her father.\n\n\nStarr told Cole that she had been unable to get him released from jail, as much as she had tried.  Cole asked Starr why she was at the jail, and Starr claimed that she wanted to apologize to Cole.  Starr revealed that even though Langston had told her that she had stopped seeing Ford, Langston never had.  Cole wondered if it was really over between Langston and Ford, and Starr said that it was.  Cole stated that was good, because then Langston would know how it felt.\n\n\nCole stated that he knew how Markko would feel about Langston and Ford, once Markko found out.  Starr informed Cole that Markko already knew about them.  Starr felt what had happened had been her fault, because she had convinced Cole not to tell Markko.  Starr insisted that she was disappointed in Langston, since Langston had sworn on their friendship that she was done with Ford.  Cole sadly stated, \"You can't always believe people.\"  After Cole reminded Starr of Todd's past lies, he warned, \"If you can be wrong about your best friend, you can be wrong about your father.\"\n\n\nAt the Sun, Todd cleared everyone out of his office, as he saw two of his goons carry in a burlap bag.  When he saw that the bag contained Hannah, he declared, \"Well, boys, you made me very happy.\"  After Todd removed the gag from Hannah's mouth, she spit on him.  As Hannah screamed for help, Todd informed her that the place was empty, and that no one would hear her.  \n\n\nTodd threatened Hannah and reminded her that according to Hannah, he had pushed Marty down the stairs.  However, Todd believed that Hannah was covering for someone else, so that \"the real baby killer could get away.\"  Todd asked, \"Who stands to gain from Marty falling down the stairs?  You.  You, Hannah, right?  You pushed Marty down the stairs, and then you tried to pin it on me.\"  As Hannah continued to glare at him, Todd realized that Hannah had done her homework and saw that if something happened to Marty, Todd could be blamed.\n\n\nAt the police station, a fellow police officer handed John the results of a test and related that somebody had stepped in the victim's blood and left a partial print.  John hoped to find the owner and the shoe of the print.  He remarked that once he received the warrant, he would search Markko's apartment.  After the police officer escorted Karen into the lobby, John escorted the officer into the hall and asked him to call the judge to push a rush on the search warrant.  When John reentered the lobby, he told Karen that she looked tense.  Yet, John stated that he needed to question her on \"your best customer.\"\n\n\nJohn handed Karen the pizza receipts for Ford and showed her Ford's picture.  He then asked her if she had delivered pizza to Ford the previous night.  When Karen evaded the question, John speculated that she had not only delivered pizza to Ford the previous night but had slept with him too.  Karen admitted that she and Ford were friends with benefits but insisted that their relationship was not a crime.  John decreed, \"It is if he ends up nearly bludgeoned to death with a blunt object.\"  Karen cried, \"I did not want him dead...but I know somebody who did.\"  John called Brody to inform him that he received the search warrant for Marrko's apartment.\n\n\nIn the hospital, Jessica asked the orderly for information on a patient, as Brody entered the lobby.  As Brody asked Jessica why she was at the hospital, a mysterious cameraman reviewed the pictures that he had just taken of Ford's bloody face.  Jessica explained to Brody that she was at the hospital for a follow-up session with Marty.  Jessica asked for an update on Ford's condition and questioned Brody on why someone would attack Ford and who it might have been.  Just as Jessica revealed that she had something to tell Brody, Cristian strolled into the lobby and asked how she was doing.  Cristian informed Jessica and Brody that Ford was still in the O.R. and asserted that Ford liked to take advantage of younger women.  Cristian guessed that someone probably snagged Ford and gave him what he deserved.  Brody's cell phone rang.\n\n\nAfter Brody finished speaking to John, Jessica questioned him on what would happen to the person who attacked Ford, and Brody answered that, if Ford died, the person would be charged with a capital offense.  Brody asked Jessica what she had wanted to tell him earlier, but she covered and stated that she would never let anyone take her away from Brody and Bree ever, ever again.  Brody left for the police station.\n\n\nTodd told Hannah that she would never leave the office, until she admitted to pushing Marty down the stairs.  Todd then demanded that Hannah sign a hand-written confession, but Hannah refused and stated that the police would never accept a coerced confession.  When the mysterious cameraman entered the room, Hannah begged him for help.\n\n\nAfter Brody left the hospital, Jessica apologized to Cristian and then revealed all of her pranks to win Cristian back from Layla.  Jessica hoped that Layla would forgive her.  Cristian informed Jessica that he had proposed to Layla on prom night, and Jessica was happy for them.  Jessica then admitted that she had witnessed the proposal.  As Cristian was leaving, he maintained that he was just happy that Jessica had her memories again, and Jessica asked him to please tell Layla that she was very happy for her.  Cristian gave Jessica a kiss on the cheek.  As Cristian started to leave, he stopped and revealed that Jessica had flunked art.  Jessica laughed and exclaimed, \"Nuts!\"\n\n\nAt Langston's apartment, Langston felt that Dorian still did not believe that Langston was innocent of the attack on Ford.  Langston questioned why, if Dorian did believe her as she claimed, Dorian had her attorney, Eli, accompany her to Langston's apartment.  When Dorian insisted Eli was at the apartment for protection, Langston exclaimed that she did not need protecting, because she had not done anything wrong.  Dorian claimed that she would not blame Langston even if she had attached Ford, after what Ford had done to Langston.  However, Eli suspected that the police would still consider Langston a suspect.\n\n\nEli asked Langston what she had told the police, but Dorian recounted that Langston did not have a chance to tell the police anything, because she had stopped her daughter.  However, Eli believed that Langston should give a voluntary statement to the police, and Langston understood that giving a statement voluntarily would help her.  Eli believed that the police had no hard evidence against Langston, and Langston agreed, \"It's my life, and I have nothing to hide.\"\n\n\nAfter Hannah begged the mysterious cameraman for help, he stated that it was not his problem.  Once the two goons left, he handed Todd the pictures.  Todd gave the cameraman the money for the pictures of Ford's bloody face and demanded that the picture taker get out.  Todd showed Hannah the pictures of Ford, and once he saw her shocked reaction, asked if she knew Ford.  Hannah yelled, \"No!\"\n\n\nAt the police station, Karen insisted that she and Ford were only fooling around at Ford's apartment and had been there for no more than a half hour, when Langston had walked in on them.  Karen asserted that John should talk to Langston about the crime, as Langston, Eli, and Dorian walked into the lobby.\n\n\nEli informed John that Langston was prepared to give a statement.  After John prepared his tape recorder, he told Langston to start talking.  Langston admitted that she had seen Ford at his apartment, but then Markko had shown up, which had caused a commotion.  Langston claimed that Markko had left Ford's place, and then she had left.  She reflected that she had arrived back at her apartment to find Markko there.  After Langston related that she and Markko had fought, Eli cut her off and reported that was all that Langston had to say.  As Eli, Langston, and Dorian stood up to leave, Eli maintained to John that they would cooperate with the investigation.  John called Brody.  Brody returned to the police station, and handed John a diagram that resembled a floor plan. John stated that he knew what the police had to do next.\n\n\nBack at Langston's apartment, Dorian looked at the mess that the police had left from the search and shrieked that the police had violated Langston's rights.  However, Eli felt that thanks to the mess and the search, it was obvious that the police still had no evidence that Langston was connected to a crime, or else \"they'd be here with a search warrant.\"  Dorian invited Langston to return to La Boulaie with her, but Langston refused.  \n\n\nAs Eli started to leave, he told Langston that she knew where to find him, if she needed him.  Langston thanked Eli and Dorian for all of their help.  Before Dorian left, she pleaded with Langston to call her first thing, if anything else were to happen.  Dorian hugged Langston, and she and Eli left the apartment.  Langston picked up a photo album and, after she turned to a picture of her and Markko in their happier times, she smiled in a sad, regretful way.\n\n\nIn the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9 kitchen, as Markko cleaned out the kitchen sink, he envisioned blood going down the drain.  A waitress startled Markko and declared that he must have gotten out the spot in the sink - from the beets that had spilled earlier.  She then announced that Markko had a visitor waiting in the caf\u00e9.  Markko walked in and found T\u00e9a at a table.\n\n\nT\u00e9a inquired about his injured hand and asked if Markko was okay.  Markko exclaimed that things were only going to get worse.  Markko explained that Cristian had told Markko to call T\u00e9a, because he had felt that Markko would need a lawyer.  T\u00e9a regretted that she had too much on her plate but stated that she could recommend another lawyer, once Markko told her the problem.  Markko stated, \"The police are after me.\"  T\u00e9a asked, \"Why?\"  Markko explained, \"They think I tried to kill someone.\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a accepted the offer of being Markko's attorney and asked him for the details of the incident on prom night.  Markko admitted that he had discovered that Langston had cheated on him with Ford, and that he had found them together at Ford's place.  Markko remembered that he had punched Ford, and the punch had been what had hurt his hand.  But Markko insisted that when he left, Ford had been fine and had even stood up.  When T\u00e9a inquired about Markko's statement to the police, Markko explained that he had told the police everything that he had just told her, but that he had lied to them.  T\u00e9a proclaimed that she would handle the police, and Markko revealed that his lie was that he had actually returned to Ford's apartment that night.\n\n\nMarkko cried that he could not understand how he had never known what was going on between Langston and Ford and declared that Ford had stolen all of Markko's memories.  T\u00e9a asked what Markko had done after he had arrived back at Ford's that night, just as Langston walked into the caf\u00e9.  Langston begged Markko to listen to her, as Brody strolled in and announced that he was at the caf\u00e9 to make an arrest.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Jessica, who pretended to be a Sun reporter, called a nurse in an attempt to get information regarding Ford's condition.  Later, as Jessica eavesdropped, John, who was still at the police station, called the intake nurse for an update to Ford's condition.  The nurse informed John that she had just received an update.\n\n\nBack at the caf\u00e9, T\u00e9a informed Brody that she was representing Markko.  When T\u00e9a asked about the evidence against Markko, Brody replied that the police had found a bloody shoeprint at the scene.  When T\u00e9a expressed that she would not allow the police the opportunity to get Markko's shoes from his apartment, Brody declared that he already had Markko's shoes.  When Markko and T\u00e9a asked Brody where he had retrieved the shoes, Brody exclaimed, \"The dumpster out back.\"  A police officer placed handcuffs on Markko's hands, as he read Markko his Miranda rights.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John and the cops are investigating the attempted murder of Ford. Suspicious is cast over Markko when the discover he had his hand treated for an injury at the hospital after first lying to the doctor that he hit a wall, then admitting to John that it happened when he hit for after finding out he slept with Langston yet waited to get it checked out by the doctor. Dorian wants to protect Langston and has Eli represent her when Langston reveals that Ford devastated her and ruined her life. Jessica remembers the encounter where she fought Ford off as though she thought he would rape her remembering Mitch. And it appears she has something to hide. Meanwhile, Rex and Gigi find out from Otto the jeweler in Santa Fe, that he was the \"other man\" in Rex's mother's life after she got pregnant by his father. She believed his father died. He believed the same about her. SO she abandoned baby Rex at the hospital. And the rest is history.",
