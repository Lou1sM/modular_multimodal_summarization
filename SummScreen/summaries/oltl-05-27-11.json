Vimal stated that he loved Rama, and that she should be honest with him.  After Rama insisted that nothing was wrong with the baby, Vimal expressed relief, because he had already told his parents about her pregnancy.  When Rama asked why, since they had agreed to keep it a secret, Vimal explained, \"I know, my poppy, but this news has lessened the blow of my unfortunate incarceration.  I felt such shame in disappointing them, but now, even if I were to die in this miserable place, our name, our legacy, will live on, and it will be made even more magnificent, because the perfection that is you will be a part of it.\"\n\n\nVimal exclaimed that the news of the child had been a lifeline to both Vimal and his parents.  Rama lied and said that the doctor had told her that she needed another amniocentesis.  Vimal expressed relief and noted that it was a routine test.  Vimal then suggested that Rama take Aubrey with her and then cheered that he might even be out of jail in time to hold her hand during the test.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Starr and James kissed, and James asked if Starr was ready.  Starr was concerned, because she had only been with one man in her life but commented that it would feel like her first time all over again.  James reminded Starr that he had only been with one other woman and insisted that he wanted it all to be perfect.  James then told Starr that he loved her.\n\n\nAs James put on the only romantic music that he could find, Starr walked out of the bathroom in a bulky bathrobe.  He took her hand, and they danced.  James and Starr kissed, and James ripped off his shirt.  Suddenly, Starr's phone rang.  Starr took the call and discovered that Hope had been having nightmares.  When Starr apologized, James recognized that Starr had a daughter who needed Starr.  James kissed Starr.\n\n\nStarr believed she was lucky to have a guy like James, who insisted that he had enjoyed every minute that they had spent together.  James claimed that, after she left, he would watch some cable television and then take a shower.  Once Starr walked out, James said, \"It's going to be a cold one.\"\n\n\n Later, Starr called James and informed him that Hope was sleeping peacefully.  Starr then thanked James for being understanding, and for the dinner, the trip to Rome, the hotel, and their dance.  James laughed and joked that he was sure that she especially appreciated the dance.  James then told her that there would be other nights.  James insisted that because they had told each other, \"I love you,\" the night had been perfect.\n\n\nBo walked into the hospital lobby, and Nora asked why Matthew's surgery had been taking so long.  Nora felt responsible for Matthew's injuries, because she had forced Matthew to hide what he had done to Eddie Ford.  However, Bo reminded Nora that Matthew had suffered an impact injury.  Nora realized that she had feared that Matthew would be sent to prison for the murder of Eddie Ford, but that Matthew's injury was an even bigger fear.  Bo stressed that Matthew was tough and would pull through.\n\n\nThe nurse entered the lobby and revealed that the doctor needed to use more anesthesia.  When the nurse asked if Matthew had any allergies, Nora gave a negative response.  After the nurse left, Bo ran after the nurse and asked if there was anything else that the nurse could tell him.  The nurse explained that Matthew's injuries were more complicated than the doctor had anticipated.  When Bo returned to Nora, he did not tell her what the nurse had disclosed.\n\n\nBo insisted that he would find out how Matthew had received his head injury.  Nora speculated that Matthew could have received it playing basketball, but Bo doubted it, because he felt that the coach would have called.  When Nora cried that something had caused the injury, Bo voiced that it could have been someone.  Bo just wanted to know why Matthew was having brain surgery and fighting for his life, when Nora suggested that they ask Destiny.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Destiny thanked Dani for not saying anything about Matthew killing Eddie Ford.  Dani claimed that Destiny was her best friend, and that Dani knew that Destiny did not want Matthew to be sentenced to jail.  Destiny then revealed that she and Matthew had slept together just one night, but that Matthew had stated that it had meant something.  Destiny hoped that she and Matthew could be a real couple like Dani and Nate were.\n\n\nDestiny explained that when Matthew had fallen for Dani, Destiny had put Destiny and Matthew's potential relationship right out of her head.  However Destiny admitted that she had never totally gotten over Matthew.  Destiny received a phone call from Nora, who asked if anything had happened to Matthew when Destiny had seen him earlier.  Bo then grabbed the phone from Nora and explained that Matthew was in the hospital.\n\n\nDestiny informed Dani that Matthew was in the hospital for brain surgery.  Destiny then remembered that Matthew had complained of a headache earlier in the day.  Destiny cried that she had to leave, and Dani begged Destiny to call once Destiny learned of any results.\n\n\nAt the Fords' apartment, Nate wondered why Dani had acted like she had believed that Clint was guilty of killing Eddie Ford, and why she had never mentioned that Matthew was the actual killer.  When Nate questioned why Dani had kept a secret from him, Deanna suggested that maybe Dani had covered for a friend.  Deanna insisted that Nate should not just sit around being mad, because life was too short.\n\n\nNate yelled that Matthew's time was up, and that Nate had already warned Matthew that if Matthew did not turn himself in, Nate would.  When Deanna reminded Nate that Matthew's parents were the police commissioner and the district attorney, Nate agreed that the cops would not listen to him.  However, Nate thought that he knew who would.\n\n\nNate wanted to tell Access Llanview, and Deanna told him to email his tip about Matthew through the computer.  As Nate keyed in his tip, they heard a knock on the door.  Deanna answered the door to Dani, who told them that Matthew was in the hospital.  Dani explained that Matthew was bleeding in the brain due to a hit on the head.  When Dani left to call Destiny, Nate whispered to Deanna, \"I punched Matthew.  He hit his head pretty hard when he went to the ground.  I think what happened to Matthew is my fault.\"\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Bo informed Nora that Matthew had claimed that someone else, besides Destiny, had known the truth about the murder of Eddie Ford.  Nora wondered who else had known, as Destiny ran in.  Destiny asked about Matthew and then explained that she had been praying to keep Matthew safe, and that she and Matthew had gotten as close as two people could get.\n\n\nAfter Nora asked Destiny if Matthew had told her how he had received his injury, Destiny's phone rang.  Destiny took the call from Dani and claimed that she had to leave the lobby, because the connection was bad.  The nurse walked in, and Nora asked if Matthew was out of surgery.  When the nurse said, \"Yes,\" Bo asked, \"Well?\"\n\n\nAt Todd's mansion, Todd called Tomas and revealed that Marty could blow their whole deal, when T\u00e9a walked in and asked if something was wrong.  Todd hung up the phone, and T\u00e9a saw the front page of the Sun.  T\u00e9a exclaimed that she could not believe what Natalie had suffered though.  T\u00e9a then questioned why Brody had thought that Todd had been hiding Marty.  Todd saw movement outside and kissed T\u00e9a to cover it.\n\n\nT\u00e9a expressed surprise that Todd had kissed her to show his love for her.  T\u00e9a then stated that she was on her way to the pool house for a swim, when Todd stopped her.  When Todd declared that they should make love, T\u00e9a stressed that she missed having Todd in bed next to her.  However, T\u00e9a understood that Todd's body still needed to heal from his injuries.  Todd insisted that T\u00e9a get ready upstairs and said that he would carry up the tequila.  After T\u00e9a left, Todd looked at his phone and wondered why Tomas had not returned his call.\n\n\nAt the hotel, Blair made a grand entrance from the bathroom, scantily clad, and Tomas kissed Blair's neck.  Blair sang, \"A dream of my own\" and asked if she was dreaming.  When Tomas cried that he hoped not, Blair demanded that he prove it.  As they kissed, Tomas received a message on his phone.  Tomas checked it, and the message read, \"Call me!  Extremely urgent!\"\n\n\nWhen Tomas explained that he had to return the call, Blair kissed him and told him to make it.  Tomas called Todd, who revealed that Marty was on Todd's property with someone else's baby and a gun.  Todd then announced that Marty had the disc, and that if it got in the wrong hands, he and Tomas would lose everything.\n\n\nTomas hung up the phone and apologized to Blair, because he had to leave.  Tomas lied and said that a friend was in the hospital.  When Tomas insisted that he would make it up to her, Blair claimed that she would hold him to it.  After Tomas asked Blair to stay and enjoy the room, Blair remarked that Tomas was sweet, and that she was glad that she had decided to trust him.  Once Tomas left the room, Blair took a swig out of the wine bottle and asked, \"Girl, is the universe trying to tell you something?\"\n\n\nBack at Todd's mansion, Todd yelled out at T\u00e9a that Briggs had called him in to work for an urgent matter but claimed that he would not be long.  Todd ran into Tomas outside, handed him a gun, and told him to do what was necessary to take care of the matter.  Later, Todd returned inside the mansion, and T\u00e9a hugged him.  T\u00e9a reminded Todd that she had feared that she had lost Todd forever, when he was in the hospital, and pleaded with Todd not to ever do that to her again.\n\n\nStill in the hotel room, Blair sat alone in the bed, watched television, and drank the wine.  Tomas called Blair and stated that he would not be able to return to the hotel, because he needed to stick around and make sure that everything was under control.\n\n\nIn the security room, the man with Todd's original face was still restrained and was slumped over in the chair.  Outside of the room, Baker informed Kent that the man was talking.  The man struggled to regain consciousness and against the restraints.  Trying hard to remember, the man yelled, \"I have a daughter.  Her name is Starr.\"\n\n\nThe man then noted that Starr's mother was named Blair, and that he had another wife named T\u00e9a.  The man shook and screamed, \"Starr is my daughter.  I have a daughter.  Her name is Starr.  Starr has a mother.  Her name is Blair.\"  When Baker noted that the man should have revealed the information of the code after the interrogation and shock treatment, Kent remarked that it had all been too much for the man after eight years.  Inside the security room, the man kept saying over and over that he had a daughter, and that her name was Starr.\n\n\nThe man howled, \"I had a wife.  Her name was Blair.  I had another wife.  Her name was T\u00e9a.\"  Still outside the room, Kent asked, \"What are you going to say?\"  Baker responded, \"We did what we had to do.  This was our last chance.\"  Kent questioned, \"And now what happens?\"  Baker answered, \"We take it all apart.  Get rid of any trace.  Dispose of him.\"\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face, scar included, laughed hysterically and hollered at the top of his lungs, \"Starr has a father.  Starr's father is Todd.  I'm Todd.  I am Todd!\" \n\n\n",
