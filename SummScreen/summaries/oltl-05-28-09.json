    "soap_central": "\n Hope Is Alive \n\n\n \nAs Starr attempted to reach Marcie on the phone, she spied the latest local headlines online. She was mystified that there was an Amber Alert out on Jessica and her own baby, and thought that a call to Viki was in order. Entering the room, Blair suggested that Viki had her hands full and thought that Starr should help her mother cook a big breakfast instead. Aware that her mother was hiding something, Starr wanted to know why Blair was acting strangely. \n\n\nClaiming that it was all due to the incident at the frat house, Blair admitted that she wanted T\u00e9a's reaction to something, but she also wanted Starr to know that they might not ever get over what happened at the KAD house. She promised to tell Starr everything when she felt better. Changing subjects, she asked Starr to tell her all about the prom. \n\n\nHappily, Starr revealed that she and Cole had a nice evening and she was able to see how things were between them before. She too had a secret, she told her mom. Cole had told her that he loved her. Unfortunately, it was while he was going through drug withdrawal and sleeping, and he probably didn't even remember it, she added. Starr noted that things were great between Cole and her, but they merely wanted to learn what happened to their baby. Starr revealed that she believed Hope was alive. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Michael had no luck in obtaining information from the funeral home regarding Hope. When John arrived and announced that he had been cleared, Marcie heaved a sigh of relief. She wanted John's help in locating the truth about Hope's death and whereabouts. When a call came through from the funeral home that no other babies were buried the same week as Hope, Marcie was adamant in her request for John's aid. \n\n\nMichael explained that all new babies have bracelets on to identify them, but Marcie quickly jumped in. She recalled holding onto the baby's hands after her death and she was definitely not wearing a bracelet. She disclosed that she was starting to believe Starr's instincts that the baby was really alive. Suddenly, John excused himself to make a phone call and headed out to the hallway. \n\n\nMarty quickly hid the newspaper when Cole walked through the door of her room at the Palace Hotel. Reminding his mom that she had given him a key, Cole wanted to know what she had removed from his sight. Instead, Marty disclosed that she had been happily remembering him as a baby. Responding to Cole's questions on the return of her memory, Marty explained that it had happened at the frat house. It was rough, she admitted to him, but she was happy to accept it. Cole confessed that Starr believed that their baby was alive, but he couldn't allow her to think that. \n\n\nIt was difficult the first time, he continued and he wouldn't be able to go through it again. He felt that it was a miracle that he got his mom back, but he couldn't believe that he would get his baby back, too. He just wanted to know her cause of death so that it could all be put to rest, he explained to Marty. Hope would always be his baby, even if she were gone. He divulged that he and Starr had talked about how it would have been when their daughter was old enough to go to the prom some day, if she had lived. He and Starr were not back together yet, Cole added, but he loved her. \n\n\nMarty expressed her opinion that her son needed to focus on his recovery. It was due to Starr that he was on the road to recovery, Cole informed his mother. He wasn't sure that he wanted to share his feelings with Starr. He caught her up to date on how he and Starr had parted ways over their disagreement on raising the baby and turning her over to the McBains. He admitted that he was an addict, but had gotten clean. He did it for Starr at first, but was doing it for himself, too. Marty told him that she was proud of him. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, a concerned Viki admitted that she had no choice but to go public about the missing Jessica and Chloe. She was also worried that Starr would start asking questions. Charlie agreed that news of the baby's identity should not be divulged to anyone else until after Jessica was found. \"How crazy is this one?\" Todd asked in reference to Bess when he walked in unannounced. \"Don't wear her out, Todd!\" Charlie exclaimed, looking out for Viki before excusing himself. \n\n\nViki assured Todd that Bess would protect Jessica and the baby. She was only worried that Jessica would fall apart upon losing Chloe, since the baby helped her to heal after Nash's death. Todd made it clear that Starr, Cole, and the McBains were not aware of Chloe's true identity yet. He, Blair, and Marty were waiting for Jessica to be found first. Viki reminded Todd that the baby was promised to the McBains, and she wondered how Todd would feel to lose the baby again when the McBains adopted her. \n\n\nTodd felt that it wasn't time to think about that yet and he was only concerned with finding the baby first. Viki encouraged him to explore his feelings. \n\n\nAs Blair and Starr were talking, John called, which interrupted Blair. Ordering Starr to stay put, Blair agreed with John that it was time for everyone to be told the truth about Hope. She explained that Starr was beginning to ask questions due to the Amber Alert. John enlightened her on what was happening with Marcie and Michael. \n\n\nBlair quickly called Todd and summoned him to La Boulaie. Viki asked him to apologize to Starr for all that had happened. After Todd left the house, a news crew showed up to film Viki making a plea for Jessica's return. Marty received her call from Blair to bring Cole to La Boulaie and join the others. \n\n\nAs Bess arrived at her destination, she looked into her compact mirror to freshen herself up. \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Tess angrily asked, peering out from the mirror. Bess advised her that she was trying to look like Jessica and that she had found the perfect place to hide. As a storm brewed, she marched up some steps and knocked on the door. \n\n\nIdentifying herself and the baby, Bess as Jessica surprised the couple there. The Brennans were stunned even more when they learned that their son. Nash, had passed away. Jessica explained that he had been in an accident and that she had thought it best to tell them in person. Mrs. Brennan recalled the letter they had received from Nash some time before stating that he had been looking for them, but they never heard from him again and never saw him. They informed Jessica that they hadn't seen him since he was an infant, when he was taken from them. They had been young, out of work, and living in their van. Jessica asked to stay with them for a few days. \n\n\nThe new grandparents were excited at the chance to bond with their son's daughter. When they went to the kitchen to heat the baby's bottle, Jessica looked into the mirror. Tess berated her for her actions, but Jessica assured her that she had a plan. Mr. Brennan wondered whom Jessica was talking to when he returned. Quickly, Jessica mentioned her tiredness and clarified that she was only talking to herself. Once alone in the bedroom with Chloe, she assured the baby that they were safe. \n\n\nDownstairs, Mr. Brennan turned on the television. He was just in time to see Viki making her appeal, along with pictures of Jessica and Chloe. \n\n\nAs Layla was packing up to move from her apartment, Cristian arrived with a special gift. It was the artwork Layla had created, newly framed and ready for hanging. Cris admitted that it looked real and should be seen. Layla confessed that she was feeling down with all that had happened. She cited Sarah leaving town; Adriana selling her company, which left Layla without a job; and Talia's death. She was not looking forward to moving in with her mother, but she could no longer afford her apartment. She was shocked when Cris offered to move in and share expenses with her. \n\n\nReminding her that his building was going co-op and that he couldn't afford to buy, Cris explained that he didn't want to live with his mother, either. Suddenly, a knock on the door interrupted them. It was a man from the moving company. Smiling, Layla informed the employee that she had changed her mind. Cris promised her that things would be great, that she'd find a job, and, if necessary, they would find another roommate. Layla told him that she always wanted complete honesty from him. She asked if he really liked her painting. While not technically correct, he still loved it, he told her. She gave him a thumbs-down on his vision for redesigning the apartment. \n\n\nPleading again with John to help them out, Marcie and Michael were stunned to hear his response. He already knew what happened to the baby, he stated. He suggested they sit down. While the story was long and complicated, he thought it best to \"cut to the chase,\" he declared. He then told the astonished couple that Hope was alive. \n\n\nTodd arrived at La Boulaie and learned from Blair that Starr was already suspicious. Marty and Cole followed closely behind. The teens were nervous and wondered what the latest news could be. As everyone took a seat, Blair made the announcement. Hope didn't die and she was still alive, she said.\n\n\n",
