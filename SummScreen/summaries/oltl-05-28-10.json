    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian and Eli are protecting Langston from getting charged with the attempted murder of Ford. Tea agrees to represent Markko. Jessica appears as though she might know something about it. Todd finds Hannah and has his men physically drag her to his office. He tells her that she's going to change her story or she will regret it. And he gets a photographer to take a picture of Ford bludgeoned on his bed and appears to want to use it against Hannah. Starr reveals to Cole, for the first time, that Langston has been lying to them all and sleeping with Ford right up until this point. The cops then conclude that they have sufficient evidence to arrest Markko and they go to Buenos Dias to find him and to do so."
