When Antonio offers to help Tess calm the baby, Tess refuses but eventually gives in when Antonio shows empathy for everything that she and the Buchanans have been going through the past few days. He tells her that Jessica is the one the family would lean on in times of crisis because of her strength. Tess scoffs at \"Jessica's strength\" but Antonio tells her that in trying to maintain control, she is killing a beautiful woman's spirit. Tess is angered when she begins to think that Antonio is being nice to her so that he can coax Jessica out. When Antonio realizes that Jessica is fighting to gain control, he calls to her and kisses Tess.\n\n\nNash pays Claudia a visit when he receives another threatening phone call from Mr. Reston. He tells her to call off her father but Claudia claims that she had no clue that her father was calling Nash. She also goes on to state that she knows how much her father loves children so it is hard for her to believe that her father would make threats against Nash's daughter. Claudia gets in a few digs about the baby's name which is also Nash's last name. She tells Nash how she doesn't want him to leave Llanview because she sees that it is a great place to start over as she has by going to a new facility with new therapists and groups and she has even gotten a job at Capricorn thanks to Antonio. Nash isn't buying the \"new start\" story and issues a warning that she better get her father to back off before he starts to push back.\n\n\nStarr is horrified to learn that Dr. Truman is going to be a witness to her father's execution. She yells at him to leave because all he wants to do is see Todd die. Spencer declares that he is there to support Blair which incenses Starr even more. Starr is given the opportunity to plead her case to a reporter but her pleas fall on deaf ears. Dorian also tries to get Spencer to leave but he once again states that he is there for Blair and since he has the proper credentials, he will be going into the prison to view Todd's execution. When a reporter reports that the governor has denied Evangeline's request for a stay of execution, Starr is devastated and leans on Dorian for support.\n\n\nTodd is giving the opportunity to say final farewells to all who have come to witness his execution. He starts by telling Margaret's sister that although he is remorseful about what happened to Margaret he didn't kill her. His speech is interrupted by the ringing of the governor's phone but unfortunately the governor is only calling to say that he is denying Evangeline's request for a stay of execution. Todd asks Viki to look after his children and to make sure that they grow up to be just like her as he regards Viki as being strong and loyal. He tells Evangeline that although he wants her to get her sight back, he is glad that she can't see what's happening at this moment. He also asks her to not cry and to know that she was more than his lawyer she was a great friend as well.\n\n\nAs the countdown to Todd's execution winds down, John, Natalie, David, and Margaret find themselves confronted by airport security since they came in on an unauthorized flight. John tries to explain to the security guard that he is a police officer and that he is transporting David and Margaret to the prison. The guard doesn't care who he is or who they are and places them under arrest until John wrestles the gun away from him. The foursome take the security guard's patrol car and race to the prison hoping to get there in time enough to stop Todd's execution. When they encounter protestors, John takes the road to the prison's back door. He grabs Margaret and enters the prison where he is stopped by a guard right outside of the execution room. John tells them that they have to stop the execution because the victim is right there next to him. \n\n\nBlair begins to break down as the realization of what is about to happen sinks in. She begs for the guard to allow her to tell Todd that she doesn't want him to die but he refuses to allow Todd to her what she has to say. Todd does tell Blair that he still loves her but he is going to haunt her and when she finally realizes that he is innocent it will haunt her for the rest of her life. As if on cue, Spencer walks in and tells Blair that he is there for her. When Evangeline and Viki protest, Spencer shows the guard the proper credentials and asks Blair if he wants her to leave to which Blair says nothing. They all watch in silence as Todd is given the injections... and stops breathing.\n\n\n",
