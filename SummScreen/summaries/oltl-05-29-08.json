    "soap_central": "\nCOURT AND SPARKS\n\n\nDorian gave Charlie another shot in the arm so that he would remain asleep and not ruin her plans. She soothingly told the unconscious man that she couldn't allow him to talk and that everything would come out when it did her the most good. Walking into the bedroom, Blair recoiled in disgust when she assumed that the person lying in the bed was David. She did a quick about-face and headed downstairs. \n\n\nStarr and Langston read about Todd's accident online. Markko arrived and showed the girls the summons he had received to appear in court. David answered the door and the girls were surprised when they received the same. Cole showed up with his in hand as well. Starr was irritable and had something rude to say to everyone. Langston suggested that her friend stop being \"hormonal,\" which annoyed Starr even more, with David being within hearing distance. Blair was surprised to see David, thinking that he was upstairs in bed. Dorian appeared suddenly and mentioned how quickly he had dressed while she was in the shower. David caught on and played along, but he realized that there was someone else upstairs in Dorian's bedroom. \n\n\nViki was puzzled when she learned that Todd had spent the night. He pointed out details of his accident in the paper and suggested that it \"may end up killing me.\" He explained that Blair had kicked him out of the house but he refused to share any details, insisting only that things had gotten out of hand and that he had made some mistakes. He asked for Viki's help in pleading his case to Blair, citing his usual excuse of being damaged from childhood experiences, but was shocked when Viki reprimanded him instead. She told him that the \"inner prince\" that he often referred to didn't exist and in actuality, he was really the same on the inside as he was on the outside. She added that she was finally using her brain and would not help him. She advised him of the many times she had spoken to Blair in the past, that she was sick of his horrible behavior and that she was sure he would never change. He called her selfish and told her that she, Blair, and whoever stood in his way could go to hell. \n\n\nCole denied holding a summons though Nora could see clearly that he had one, as he quickly headed out the door when Clint walked in. They rehashed his using of questionable methods to save the company, though Nora expressed her understanding of his reasons. She pointed out that issues with Lindsay being involved and the fact that he didn't tell her about it, were the reasons for her still being upset. She was also sure that Lindsay had an ulterior motive for anything that she did. Bo wandered in at that point and stated, \"She did it for me. Do you have a problem with that?\" He stressed that Lindsay did what she did for the company. After he left to look at some papers, Clint and Nora argued about Lindsay. Nora was angered that Clint cared about her but not enough to let her voice her concerns and morals. She was convinced that Lindsay was dangerous and destructive and murdering. He accused her of being obsessed and losing her humor and wisdom when it came to Lindsay, and said that she became irrational. Nora reminded him of the many things that Lindsay had done to her personally. Clint suggested she find a better way of dealing with Lindsay. Nora vowed to find out some secrets about Lindsay to bring her down. \n\n\nAt the gallery, Lindsay blew up at R.J. for telling Nora about her helping Clint. He was confused, wondering why she wasn't more upset about the jewels from Mendorra being stolen from her place of business. Livid, Lindsay explained that the jewels were business and were insured; the other involved her private life. R.J. pointed out that he could have given other secrets away. Lindsay wanted to know what it would take for him to keep his mouth shut. \"Break it off with Bo,\" he quickly demanded. He threatened to talk to Nora if Lindsay continued to hang onto Bo. Lindsay felt that Bo was not hers to give up and they might already be history. R.J. took note that Lindsay considered Bo the most important thing in her life. \n\n\nMarcie met with the child custody attorney at the diner, which piqued Michael's curiosity. He reminded her that they would not be able to get Sam back. Marcie responded that she was aware of that but was merely taking care of the baby by testifying against Todd. \n\n\nLindsay and Bo met at the diner, with Lindsay prepared to hear the worst from Bo, especially since he did not show up at home the previous evening. He explained that he didn't like dirty tactics and the fact that Lindsay worked behind his back. He also knew that she often acted before thinking but had wanted to help his family. She was elated when he admitted that he wanted a relationship as long as she had nothing else to hide. He added that if she hid something again it would be over. \"Never again,\" she repeated. He expressed his happiness at their mutual understanding. Cris and Sarah showed up as Bo left for his meeting. Sarah explained that she had tried to call her mother but learned that her phone number was no longer in service. She felt like her mom had fallen off the face of the earth. Cris wondered if they should hire Rex to locate her. \n\n\nTodd showed up at court and asked his attorney why celebrities driving with babies on their laps didn't have to appear in court. The attorney pointed out that they weren't obnoxious jerks. Michael and Marcie were the first people into the courtroom. After Todd suggested that Sam wasn't her child, Marcie swore that Sam would not be Todd's kid either. Yolanda, the child custody worker, arrived and attempted to share news of Sam's evening. She assured Todd that the boy had a comfortable night and was well taken care of. Todd did what he did best and mouthed off at the woman. All of the Llanview residents who were summoned to court began to arrive. \n\n\nDavid tried to get information out of Dorian, wondering if the body upstairs had something to do with the \"goons\" he had seen leaving the house. He wondered if it was the \"faux Buchanan\" and asked if she knew who the real son was. Dorian firmly told David that her private life was none of his business. He thought the new scheme of hers had something to do with finances and was sure that her deal had something to do with his deal involving blackmailing Jared. She told him that the Buchanan Enterprises shareholders were scheduled to meet at their first annual get-together since Asa's death. She explained the difficulties that B.E. had been having and asked him, with a sly grin, who he thought might be responsible for those difficulties. \"Little old you?\" he asked. David's gaze at a departing Dorian was one of pure adoration. Charlie's phone began to ring. \n\n\nViki tried to reach Charlie, wondering why he had not returned home the night before. At La Boulaie, Dorian deleted the voice mail message. Again, David demanded to know what was going on and asked about the guy in bed. Dorian suggested he take a cold shower. Later, she made a phone call and mentioned that everything was set and she couldn't afford to have a single thing go wrong. She realized she was going to extremes. Upstairs, David tried to get into Dorian's bedroom but the door was locked. Viki arrived and asked Dorian to let her in. \n\n\nThe judge called the court to order, announcing that it was an informal hearing to determine the shelter of Sam. He added that there would be no questions by the attorneys. Marcie was the first called to the stand and she recounted her eyewitness account of the accident and its aftermath, including her discovery of the child in the front seat of the car without a car seat. She was followed by Markko, Langston, and Cole. They all testified to their firsthand encounters with Todd and his losing it either by beating someone up or his threats to kill. Cole believed that if it had not been for Blair, he would have been dead in Virginia Beach. Again, Todd yelled out and the judge promised to remove him. Starr prepared to take the stand next. \n\n\nNora ran into Lindsay at the diner and asked to chat for awhile. They agreed they'd never be friends but Nora was wondering if they could be civil to each other for the sake of Bo and Clint. Lindsay admitted that she would never be able to pretend and assured Nora that her previous vows to come after her were indeed promises. She accused Nora of continually trying to knock her down, but she was certain she'd keep getting up. \n\n\nThe Buchanan brothers were happy to see on paper that their company was alive and thriving. They were happy that Clint had been able to turn things around and thought that all of the family members would have to continue to stick together. They were sure that Asa would have been proud.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nora tells Clint she doesn't want him having anything to do with Lindsay; business-related or not. He tells her she is obsessed about Lindsay. It looks like Bo and Lindsay are getting closer. RJ Gannon makes it clear he's not ok with that and that he might want to hurt them both. Todd has a court hearing for temporarily losing custody of Sam after Marcie and Michael caught him driving his infant son without a child safety seat. Marcie wants to prevent Todd from ever having his son in his home again. Starr, Langston, Cole and Markko all get subpoenaed. Both Markko and Cole testify about Todd assaulting them. The judge then asks Starr to testify.",
