After convincing the lab technician at the front desk that Schuyler had clearance to access the lab, Schuyler and Gigi raced off to find proof that Stacy's stem cells weren't a match for Shane. \n\n\nSeconds after Gigi and Schuyler had entered the lab, Kyle approached the on-duty technician at the desk and requested his help in locating Kyle's final paycheck. As the lab technician walked off, Kyle peeked inside the lab and panicked when he spotted Gigi and Schuyler at the computer, attempting to compare Stacy and Shane's blood work. \n\n\nWhile Schuyler and Gigi waited for the test results to process, Kyle utilized the front desk computer terminal and made changes to Stacy's blood test results. Back inside the lab, a look of surprise crossed Schuyler's face as he examined the test results. He told a devastated Gigi that the test results stated that Stacy's stem cells were a match for Shane. Upset by the news, Gigi ran out into the hall and Schuyler chased after her. \n\n\nAs he tried to convince Gigi that someone had tampered with the results, Schuyler observed Kyle walking away from the front desk. Pointing Kyle out to Gigi, Schuyler told her that Stacy and the lab technician had been spending a lot of time together. A frustrated Gigi asked Schuyler to contact her once he discovered proof to support his claim. Schuyler was convinced that Kyle was involved in Stacy's scheme. Dragging Gigi down the hall, Schuyler remarked, \"I already have!\" \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy received a call from Stan, who informed Stacy that he would make her life a living hell unless she returned the money that she had stolen from him. Stan instructed Stacy to meet him at the baseball field at the park. As Stacy wondered how she would come up with the money, Rex returned and presented her with twenty thousand dollars. Insisting that he would never forget that she saved his son's life, Rex told Stacy that he had borrowed the money from Ultraviolet. Thrilled that Rex had come through for her, Stacy thanked him with a big hug. \n\n\nAs Stacy prepared to meet Stan at the park, Rex announced that he would go to the park alone. Stacy tried to convince Rex to reconsider. After mulling over their dilemma, Rex decided that he wouldn't allow Stan to extort money from them. Instead of handing over the cash to Stan, Rex told Stacy that he intended to have a discussion with Stan. Before leaving, Rex remarked that he wouldn't allow Stan to take advantage of Stacy. \n\n\nRex wandered around the baseball field and waited for Stan. Meanwhile, Stacy greeted Stan at the loft and related that she had the money. After giving him the cash, Stacy asked Stan for one last favor. Stacy asked Stan to punch her in the face. \n\n\nBack at the park, Rex continued to wait for Stan to arrive. Meanwhile, Schuyler and Gigi headed to his apartment, but they decided to take a shortcut through the park. Schuyler related that the bag of blood, which he was certain belonged to Stacy, was inside his apartment at the Angel Square Hotel. When Schuyler advised Gigi that they would have the blood tested at another lab, Gigi's hope was renewed. As Gigi envisioned exposing Stacy and finally reuniting with Rex, both Gigi and Schuyler were startled when Rex appeared and demanded to know why Gigi was in Schuyler's company. \n\n\nUpon discovering Jessica's car on the lot, Brody knocked on the door of the car dealer that had purchased Jessica's vehicle. The dealer recognized the photograph of Jessica and remembered that she had mentioned taking a particular interstate. \n\n\nAs Brody looked over a map, he had a flashback of a conversation that he had with Jessica several months earlier. Brody recalled that Jessica had mentioned that she regretted that Nash didn't get the chance to meet his long-lost parents, who lived in Morgantown. Spotting the small village of Morgantown on the map, Brody realized that he had discovered a lead. \n\n\nAt the home of Nash's parents in Morgantown, Bess walked downstairs just in time to overhear Mr. Brennan telling his wife about Viki's television ad in which she claimed that Jessica had run off with the baby. Upon hearing Mr. Brennan's decision to phone the hotline, Bess appeared and informed Nash's parents that she wanted to tell them the truth. Mr. Brennan stated that unless Jessica could provide him with a valid explanation, he would place the call. \n\n\nStating that she was grief-stricken after Nash's death, Bess told the Brennans that Viki thought she had gone crazy and wanted her committed. Mr. Brennan argued that Viki appeared to be concerned for Jessica and Chloe, but Bess told the Brennans that Viki had never cared for Nash. Bess said that Viki would never allow Nash's parents the opportunity to have a relationship with their grandchild. Bess advised the Brennans that they would never see Chloe again if they turned Jessica in. Unwilling to lose contact with their newfound granddaughter, the Brennans agreed to remain silent. \n\n\nLeaving Bess alone, the Brennans stepped away to prepare a snack. An image of Tess appeared in the mirror. Tess warned Bess that Viki, Todd, and Brody were hot on her trail. Tess told Bess that once Viki and Todd offered a huge reward for information leading to Jessica's return, the Brennans would turn her in to receive the cash. Bess thanked Tess for giving her yet another bright idea. \n\n\nA few moments later, Bess quietly returned downstairs with Chloe. As she opened the front door, Bess was startled to discover Brody. \n\n\nInside Michael and Marcie's apartment, John informed the stunned couple that Hope was alive. John detailed the events that led up to Hope's kidnapping. Marcie and Michael were thankful to learn the Hope hadn't died. John promised Michael and Marcie that he would come up with a lead on where Jessica had taken the baby. After John had left, Marcie admitted that although she was elated to learn the news, she didn't know how to react. Mike was adamant that their only focus should be on the safe return of Jessica and Hope. \n\n\nMeanwhile, at La Boulaie, a shocked Starr and Cole listened as their parents revealed that Hope was alive. With tears streaming down her face, Starr exclaimed that she had received a miracle. As Blair, Todd, and Marty looked on, Starr and Cole embraced and expressed their joy of learning that their child was alive. \n\n\nThe teens listened as Todd explained exactly how Hope had been switched with the dead child. Upon learning that Jessica had kidnapped her daughter, Starr couldn't believe that Hope had been living under her nose the entire time. Recalling the special moments she had with Chloe, Starr stated that she knew there was a reason why she shared a connection with the child. Starr and Cole feared that Jessica's alter ego might harm Hope. Assuring the teens that both Jessica and Hope would return home safely, Blair smiled as she promised them that they would be reunited with their child. When Starr expressed concern that Marcie wasn't aware of the news, Blair told her that John had related the news to Marcie. \n\n\nTodd balked when John arrived at La Boulaie and informed Blair that Bo had come up with a lead on Jessica. When Mike and Marcie entered the room, Todd appeared bothered. Starr informed her father that she wanted Marcie and Michael to remain at La Boulaie until Hope was returned home. Everyone prepared to wait for news on the whereabouts of Hope and Jessica.\n\n\n \n\n\n",
