He confirms that Antonio has hired Claudia at Capricorn but walks away from a heated debate with him to check on baby Brennan. Nash is holding Brennan when he finds a note from Reston in the baby's crib giving him 24 hours to leave town or else. While he is in the other room Tess warns Antonio that she will punch him in the lower regions should he ever try to kiss her again. Antonio taunts her with the fact that she didn't tell Nash about their kiss because it was Jessica kissing him back. Tess feels that Antonio is on the verge of breaking their fragile truce but Antonio insists that he will do whatever it takes to get Jessica back so that the two of them can raise their baby together. Tess says that she will never let go of the love she and Nash share and that she will never let go of her baby. Antonio tries to get Tess to promise that if the baby turns out to be his that she will back off and let Jessica out. Tess asks him if he will do the same if she and Nash turn out to be Brennan's parents. Antonio gets a phone call from the hospital informing him that the results of the paternity test should be in the next day.\n\n\nClint asks Kelly to forgive Kevin for the things that he did to ruin their relationship and push her into Duke's arms. Kelly tells Clint that although she is still in love with Kevin there is nothing she can do or say that would make the situation better especially since she is the one who is truly to blame for Duke's death and not Kevin. Clint tells her that she should forgive herself as well as Kevin. Kevin walks into her room and agrees with her when she states that there is nothing that will ever take away the pain of the fact that she is still alive and Duke isn't. Kevin turns the TV on after reporting to Clint that evidence has turned up that may prove that Todd didn't kill Margaret after all. They watch as the reporter states that Todd was executed prior to the new evidence showing up and that the doctors are working to revive Todd. Kelly feels for Blair and tries to reach out to Kevin who pulls away from her.\n\n\nBlair, Viki, Evangeline, Spencer, Hugh, and Bo are stunned when John walks in to the execution viewing room with Margaret. John calls for them to stop the execution but it is too late as Todd has already flat-lined. The prison officials work frantically to try to revive Todd as Blair pleads for Spencer to go in and save Todd's life. Spencer is hesitant but eventually begins working on Todd. John follows Spencer to make sure that he doesn't try to kill Todd as Bo places David and Margaret under arrest. Hugh apologizes to Evangeline for what has happened and leaves to go have \"Margaret and her baby's\" bodies exhumed. He also gets his list of charges ready to present to Margaret.\n\n\nBo asks John how he went from going to Thailand to find his father's shooter to finding Margaret. John fills him on how he found out that David was the teen who killed his father and how finding David led to his finding Margaret. John wants to stick around while Bo interrogates Margaret and David but Bo tells him to take Natalie and go home since John is still pumped up on adrenaline. After John leaves, Bo begins to interrogate Margaret who doesn't remember anything about Todd or the baby she gave birth to. Hugh asks Bo if he believes that she truly does not remember anything to which Bo responds that he does believe her but he is still going to try to help her get her memory back. When he mentions Spencer's name to her, Margaret tells him that the name sounds familiar.\n\n\nAs a worried Blair and Viki look on, Spencer shocks Todd and gets a weak pulse but without the proper equipment he is unable to stabilize Todd. He tries to walk away but Blair won't let him so he continues working on Todd and orders the prison officials to have a MedEvac come to Lehigh prison to take Todd to the nearest hospital as soon as possible. Evangeline asks to speak to John alone as she is concerned that Spencer will do something to harm Todd now that Margaret has been found. John tells her that he is also concerned but that Spencer is not alone with Todd now and won't be alone with Todd in the MedEvac either. Evangeline still can't believe that Margaret is alive while John tells her that she was right all along even though she didn't know all the details. Evangeline is grateful to John and to Cristian who has been her eyes through this whole ordeal.\n\n\n",
