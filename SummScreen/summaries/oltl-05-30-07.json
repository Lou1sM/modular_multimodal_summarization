David assumes Marty's been talking to Dorian, but Marty insists she hasn't. He then asks her why she thinks he didn't kill Spencer. She tells him that she doesn't think he has the guts to murder someone, and he counters by saying that she doesn't know him as well as she thinks she does. Then Marty lists reasons David couldn't be a murderer, including the fact that he's lazy. David finally confesses that he didn't kill Spencer. He starts to ask Marty why she's there, but then he realizes that she's the guilty one. Marty's shocked that he'd come to this conclusion, but he explains that she feels guilty because she prevented Spencer from doing jail time. Marty then realizes that the only reason David would be confessing to a crime he didn't commit is for money. David tries to deny that fact, but isn't all that convincing. Before going back to his cell, he tells Marty to just let it go, but she tells him that she can't. \n\n\nBo and John give the mayor an update on the progress of the arson case, and tell him about the bird symbol showing up at each crime scene. They also mention that they have a connection between OPP and a Wyoming camp and are following up on all the leads they can. The mayor wants them to work harder and faster to nab the arsonist and he wants a press conference whenever they get any good news. He then leaves Bo's office. \n\n\nLater, John asks an officer to try to track down any information he can about OPP in Wyoming. The mayor comes back to ask him some questions, but John takes a phone call instead. He hears from the guard at Statesville that David had two visitors. One is Dorian, and before the guard can tell him the other, the mayor hangs the phone up for John. The mayor says that he's more important than any work John might be doing. John stands up to the mayor and tells his secretary to forward all reports to the mayor's office. The mayor leaves with a warning that things aren't finished between them.\n\n\nAs John tries to get Statesville back on the phone, Marty comes in looking for him because she has something important to tell him. \n\n\nWhen Rex enters Adriana's apartment, he's confused as to why she seems upset with him. She confronts him with the fact that he met with one of Tate's high school friends behind her back, and he has no choice but to admit it. Rex tries to convince her that something feels off about Tate, but he can't put his finger on what it is. Adriana refuses to believe him and thinks that Tate has nothing to hide. Rex is adamant about checking on Tate's background some more, which just makes Adriana madder. She wonders if he's ever told her the truth since he told her that he was going to stop looking into Tate's past. Rex explains that his gut is telling him that Tate is bad news, and Adriana compares what Rex is doing to what Dorian did to \"protect\" her. He tries to convince her that he's trying to protect her because he loves her. She then tells him that she can't love him and that their relationship is over. Rex asks for another chance, but Adriana refuses because the trust she had for him is gone. Adriana asks Rex to leave, but before he does, he tells her that nothing will ever stop him from loving her.\n\n\nAfterwards, Rex goes to Bo for advice on what to do about Adriana. He then realizes that he shouldn't be bothering Bo in the middle of the big arson investigation. Bo tells him to stay put because he could use a little break. After listening to Rex's problems, he tells Rex to give Adriana some space. Rex declares Bo a genius when it comes to women. Rex takes Bo's advice and is about to leave when Bo asks him what kind of evidence he found on Tate. Rex mentions that Tate and his father went to some camp in Wyoming and came back totally changed people. After Rex leaves, Bo starts to put this information together with the arson case. \n\n\nMiles follows the psychiatrist into her office and she asks him what he'd like to talk about. As he eyes Marty's session tape, he says that he'd like to talk about a woman. The doctor puts a fresh tape into her recorder, and they begin their session. Miles starts off by showing her what he used to look like and how he owes his new life to Spencer. She asks him how he likes his life now, and he thinks it's wonderful, except that he can't get the woman he wants to love him. She asks him if he can accept a woman not loving him, and he says that he can't and will make this woman love him. The doctor tells Miles that he can't make someone fall in love with him, but he's sure that he can try. Just then the office phone rings. The doctor has to step out for a bit. After she leaves the office, Miles jumps up and gets into the locked cabinet where Marty's tape is stored. As he's replacing the tape and putting the key away, the doctor walks back in and asks him what he's doing. He covers, saying that he was just turning off the tape recorder. The doctor offers to continue to see Miles, which he accepts. He also tells her that he's helped her more than she even knows, as he fondles the tape in his pocket. \n\n\nAs Cristian is unsuccessfully trying to call Antonio, it's shown that he's in Barcelona with Jamie. She tells him that she wants to go home to Jessica. Antonio tries to explain to Jamie why they can't go back to Llanview. He starts to get a bit flustered when he hears a knock at the door. Thinking it's the driver he hired, he opens the door, and is surprised to find Nash there. He tries to close the door on Nash, but Nash slips through. Antonio sends Jamie to watch a DVD, and then threatens to call security to haul Nash away. Nash refuses to leave and tells Antonio that he needs Antonio's help to save Jessica's life. He tells Antonio that Jess needs a liver donor, but Antonio interrupts him saying that he already knows all this. As Antonio goes on, Nash interrupts him telling him that he's a match for Jessica. Antonio feigns reluctance to go through with the procedure because there are risks for the donor and because he's a single parent. Nash counters with the offer to give up Jessica if Antonio donates a piece of his liver. Antonio says he'll go through with the procedure without taking Jessica back because it's the right thing to do. He adds that if everything turns out well, he wants nothing more to do with Nash and Jessica.\n\n\nMichael walks up to Viki and Clint and asks them if they've heard from Antonio yet, which they haven't. Viki is getting frustrated because she knows Jessica is in the ICU because she's dying. Clint assures her that Jessica won't die and reminds her that loads of people are looking for Antonio. She reiterates her idea of using her liver, but Michael soundly refuses that option. Cristian comes by and tells them that he hasn't been able to reach Antonio. Viki gets even more worried, but Clint is confident that they'll be able to track Antonio down. Viki and Clint go into Jessica's room and ask her if Cris can visit with her. They then let him in and give them some privacy.\n\n\nWhen Cristian comes in, Jessica starts to apologize to him, but Cris won't let her finish. He assures her that they'll find Antonio, and that he'll work things out with Antonio. Jess wonders how he can't hate her for pushing Antonio away. He tells her that he hates that Antonio got hurt but could never hate Jessica. \n\n\nOutside Jessica's room, Viki worries about Antonio being so angry with Jessica that he'll refuse to help her out. Then Clint and Viki reminisce about Jessica's first junior high dance.\n\n\nMichael comes back to Jess's room to take her for another round of tests. He tells Jess that she should get some rest afterwards. She then says that she feels like she could sleep forever, which scares Viki and Clint. Cristian leaves to continue trying to find Antonio. Michael tells Viki and Clint that the tests will take about an hour, so they should take some time to leave and get something to eat. As they're talking, Jessica's monitors start beeping and the nurse says that Jessica is failing.\n\n\n",
