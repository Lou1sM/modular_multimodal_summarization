After Starr's testimony, Blair hugged her daughter, and asked for permission to make a statement. Blair related to the judge that Todd had a history of violent behavior and that he had begun to unleash his anger on children. As Blair testified, Todd glared at her. Once the judge gave Todd the opportunity to speak, Todd attempted to defend himself, but did a terrible job. Todd blamed others for his actions and claimed that he was only guilty of caring too much for his children. Afterward, the judge announced his decision-Todd's custody rights were severed and Sam was to remain in the custody of Child Protective Services. When Todd began screaming at the judge and making threats against those in the courtroom, the judge threatened to have Todd arrested. A look of horror crossed the faces of both Blair and Starr as they watched Todd perform and realized that Sam would become a ward of the state once again. \n\n\nAfter hearing the judge's decision, Marcie urged Judy to make a statement. Although Michael warned against it, Marcie was eager for Judy to speak on their behalf. Judy asked the judge to consider Michael and Marcie as temporary guardians for Sam. Upon hearing Judy's plea, Todd exploded. In a fit of hysterics, he claimed that Michael and Marcie orchestrated his demise. Todd and Marcie argued relentlessly before the judge interrupted. As Marcie smirked, the judge informed Todd that his violent actions caused his problems and that Sam could have been seriously injured as a result of his carelessness. Upset over the judge's ruling, Starr bolted from the courtroom with Cole close behind. Outside in the hall, Starr blamed herself for Todd losing custody of Sam. As Cole expressed concern for her, Starr lashed out at Cole. She told him not to worry because his baby was fine. Cole stated that he was only trying to look out for her. He was shocked when Starr implied that they would not be in the situation they were in if he had been more careful. As Cole stared at Starr in disbelief, she gave him a half-hearted apology and ran off claiming that she needed some time alone. \n\n\nBack in the courtroom, the judge related that he would never consider placing Sam in Michael and Marcie's care due to the illegal measures they demonstrated to retain custody of the child in the past. As tears formed in Marcie's eyes, Todd turned towards her and gloated. Despite Judy's plea, the judge was adamant that Sam would remain in foster care. Todd interjected several times and continued to be warned by the judge. Finally, Todd settled down and muttered to himself, \"The sooner I find out who gets my son, I'll know who to kill!\" When the judge stated that there was no other alternative, Blair asked if she could be considered as Sam's guardian. After recounting her years in foster care, Blair stated that Sam was a member of her family and she loved him dearly. As Blair spoke, Marcie became emotional when Blair told the judge that Sam had called her \"Mama\" recently. Distraught, Marcie ran from the courtroom and collapsed on the floor of the women's restroom. \n\n\nMichael opened the door and discovered Marcie trembling hysterically. As Michael comforted her, Marcie broke down. In tears, Marcie told Michael that she thought she had come to terms with losing Sam, but confided that holding the child in her arms had given her hope that he could be hers again. Michael consoled his wife and promised her that one day they would have a child of their own. Marcie said that all she ever wanted was a child to love. As Michael led Marcie out the door, she said that she only ran because she knew Todd would hurt Sam, but she felt terrible because Todd had hurt Starr. Seconds later, a teary-eyed Starr quietly exited a bathroom stall. \n\n\nMeanwhile, the judge asked the social worker if she had any objections to Blair receiving temporary custody. The social worker's only concern was that Todd might have access to the child. After Blair assured the court that Todd would have no contact with Sam, the judge granted her temporary custody. Todd called Blair a slut and claimed she was unfit to raise a child. Todd approached Blair and warned her that she would soon lose everything-her children, home, and money. \n\n\nAs Jared sat in Angel Square diner, he called Natalie. When Jared stated that he hadn't located David, Natalie explained that she was outside of Jessica's home and had hopes that David had decided to pay her sister a visit. Jared assured Natalie that they would find David. When Natalie asked Jared what would happen if they didn't find David in time, Jared stated, \"Everyone we care about will pay the price.\" \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, a drugged Charlie was unconscious in Dorian's bed. Meanwhile, outside of Dorian's locked bedroom door, David attempted to gain entry but was unsuccessful. Addie interrupted David's break-in attempt and asked if he needed help. David wondered what Dorian was hiding in her bedroom. Addie offered him a hairpin to pick the lock and volunteered to go downstairs and ask Dorian. In an attempt to prevent Addie from spilling the beans, David embraced her. David gave Addie a kiss that made her knees melt. Afterward, David suggested that she would receive more if she kept quiet. \n\n\nDownstairs, Dorian was surprised to find Viki at the front door. When Viki asked to come in, Dorian attempted to prevent her entry, but Viki brushed past her and said that she had come to see Blair in regards to the custody case. Dorian used the opportunity to taunt Viki about her loyalty to Todd. Dorian referred to Todd and Viki as the spawns of Victor Lord. An obviously upset Viki warned Dorian not to mess with her that day of all days. Dorian was shocked by Viki's sudden outburst, but continued to harass Viki. David interrupted the altercation when he came downstairs. While David exchanged pleasantries with Viki, Dorian appeared bothered by his fondness for Viki. Viki was surprised to learn that Blair and Starr were both in court testifying against Todd. Realizing Viki was having a bad day, David expressed his sympathy. Before leaving, Viki asked David to please inform her if he encountered Charlie. Dorian had a parting word for Viki-perhaps she should search the \"drunk tank.\" Outside of La Boulaie, Viki cried and worried about Charlie. \n\n\nDavid asked Dorian why Charlie was in her bedroom. Sensing David was uncertain of exactly what was going on, Dorian called David's bluff and realized that David hadn't seen Charlie in her bedroom. As David continued to pressure Dorian for answers, she received a call on her cell phone. Dorian spoke cryptically and ordered the caller to arrive immediately. Before David could inquire what the call was concerning, Dorian's \"other\" cell phone began to ring-Charlie's cell phone. Nearby, Viki placed a call to Charlie and prayed for him to answer. Noticing Viki's name appearing as the cell phone rang, David asked Dorian about the phone again. Dorian lied and stated that both phones belonged to her. As Viki continued to call Charlie, Dorian continued to make excuses for not answering the ringing cell phone and denied holding Charlie prisoner in her bedroom. When David begged Dorian to clue him in on what was going on, she advised him, \"Trust and soon we will both soon get all that we desire.\" After Dorian left, Addie appeared and told David she knew what she desired and threw him to the ground and smothered him with kisses. Fighting Addie off, David told her that Blair would kick him out if she caught him hitting on Addie, and ran off. Smiling to herself, Addie grabbed her to do list and in big bold letters-added \"David Vickers\" to the list. \n\n\nDorian entered the bedroom and stared at an unconscious Charlie. Dorian stated, \"Poor Charlie. I wish I could tell you things were going to get better, but I would only be lying.\" She further stated that she could not risk him telling the world who he really was, and perhaps things would have gone better for him had he met her in Paris instead of Viki. With a devilish grin she sat next to Charlie and watched him sleep. Dorian looked up towards the heavens and asked God for forgiveness, but stated she had to finish what she started. Smiling, Dorian poured whiskey down Charlie's throat. \n\n\nJessica was pleased by Natalie's birthday visit to Bree. Natalie was surprised when Jessica informed her that she was pregnant. When Natalie learned that Nash hadn't been told, she sensed that something was bothering her sister. Jessica expressed her concern about possibly transmitting Hepatitis C to Nash and her unborn child, but instantly cheered up after being reminded by her sister that her viral count was practically nonexistent. Jessica told her sister that she felt blessed and the sisters and Bree headed off to the diner to celebrate Bree's birthday with Nash. \n\n\nAt the diner, Jared overheard Nash arguing with his investor. The investor informed Nash that his business partners were taking Nash's land away and turning it into a mall. An angered Nash begged the investor to reconsider because his family was depending on the success of the vineyard. Nash was told the only way he could save his vineyard was to come up with the capital to buy out the investors. Jared approached and offered to save Nash's vineyard with funds from Buchanan Enterprises. Initially, Nash refused Jared's offer. He reminded Jared of his past schemes. Jared told Nash that he wanted to help because they were family. Reluctantly, Nash decided to accept Jared's help. The investor warned Nash that it was the exact situation that Nash had asked for help to get out of. Jared promised to contact the investor and make arrangements to complete the buyout. Afterwards, Jared and Nash shook hands. Jessica, Natalie, and Bree entered the diner in time to see a deal being struck between Nash and Jared. When Jessica asked Nash what was going on, he stated that he dodged a bullet concerning the vineyard but received help from Jared. Nash remained secretive about the deal, stating that he didn't want to ruin Bree's birthday with talk of business. \n\n\nJared stood outside of La Boulaie and called Charlie. Jared wondered where Charlie was and begged his father to answer. Jared rang the doorbell. David answered and was shocked to find Jared standing there.\n\n\n",
