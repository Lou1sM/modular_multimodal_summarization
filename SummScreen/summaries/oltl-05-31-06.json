Hugh explains the circumstances of the case to Margaret but the only thing she knows is her great life in Bangkok. Hugh even offers to make a deal with David but the information that he's looking for is not forthcoming. He and John even try the good cop/bad cop scenario but David wants to see a lawyer. John shows Hugh the picture of a young David along with the sketch and he agrees that David is the killer. Natalie agrees to go to the hospital with John so that he can tell Michael what they've learned. Margaret remembers working at B.E. \n\n\nAs Dorian, Starr and Adriana await news of Todd outside of the prison, Blair and Viki come running out to follow Todd to the hospital. Blair grabs Starr and Dorian learns that David has been arrested. Though she claims not to care, Adriana convinces her otherwise. She heads for the hospital but suggests her mother wait to learn what she can about David. Dorian in turn advises her daughter to stop blaming herself for Duke's death. Margaret is escorted out, followed by David. Their eyes meeting, David and Dorian can only share a meaningful glance.\n\n\nKevin runs into Kelly at the hospital while he's there to visit Asa. He catches her as she starts to fall. She wants to have a talk with him but he's reluctant; he considers everything between them to be over. She heads for her room alone but Kevin is curious about the secret she seems to have. He receives a call from Bo, asking that he meet him at the police station regarding a very much alive Margaret. Kelly decides she doesn't have to tell Kevin anything and apologizes once again for being alive while Duke is dead. Kelly asks Adriana to get her a pregnancy test kit. Marcie, who has grown attached to the baby orphaned by the tornado, is reluctant to give him up to foster care. Learning that his name is Thomas, the same as Michael's dad, she sees it as a sign. She wants to have a baby right away. Todd arrives at the hospital and is immediately taken into surgery, ending up alone in the room with Spencer, who whispers that anything can happen when no one else is around. Suddenly, a medical team rushes in; Viki has called them and it's the same team who worked with Spencer on Kelly. Viki, Blair and Starr arrive along with Cris and Evangeline. When Evangeline mentions that Todd is in more danger now with Spencer around and Blair should realize it, it creates a shouting match between the women. Blair doesn't want Spencer to be trashed after just reviving Todd at the prison. Starr learns that Margaret is alive and is joyful, giving her dad's attorney a big hug.  Spencer, recalling Blair's pleas to help Todd, does his best during surgery and saves him, though the next several hours are crucial. He advises that there are no guarantees. Blair replays Evangeline's warning in her head as she and Starr look at Todd through the window of his room. Blair heads for the chapel, lights a candle, prays and breaks down. A disbelieving Michael learns the news of David being his father's killer. Alone with Todd in his room, Spencer announces to the unconscious man that he always comes out on top and refuses to watch it all fall apart, that he's come too far. Blair explains to Natalie that Spencer saved Todd but she has a question for her. Does Nat think that Spencer could be responsible for all that has happened to Todd?\n\n\nCris pulls an ecstatic Evangeline into a serious kiss. Though the lawyer returns the kiss, she is shocked and speechless and asks to be driven home. Cris wants to kick himself for making the move.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd is taken to the hospital. The team puts him on a bed in the OR and Spencer tells that he will take it from there. He grabs a syringe when alone with Todd and smiles. \"It is only you and me now \" The door flies open and the team returns ready for surgery. They gather around Todd for the surgical procedure that might save his life. Spencer's smile fades. Spencer has started the surgery with his team. He sees that there is a lot of damage inside. \"Will he make it?\" one of the team members ask. Spencer thinks back to the prison and Blair begging him to save Todd's life. She promised that she would love him forever. He turns back to his work now. \"Okay I want you all to listen to everything that I tell you and follow my orders to a tee!\" Kelly is alone when Adrianna comes to see her. \"I have a secret,\" Kelly says. \"I need you to do something for me I need a pregnancy test.\" Blair goes to Nat who is alone at the hospital. \"Do you think that Spencer was the one who put Todd behind death row?\" Evangeline's spirit has been renewed. Cristian has her near the car. She has a lot that she plans to do now. She has to see that Spencer pays for the trouble that he caused. She is all hyped up about work but all that Cristian can think about is doing this. He holds her head to his and plants one on her. \"Can you take me home?\" Evangeline asks timidly. Cristian puts her in the car and then hits himself in the head several times for making the wrong move.",
