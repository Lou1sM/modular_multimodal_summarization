    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the hospital, Bo and Nora learned that while Matthew was out of surgery, it hadn't gone as well as the doctor had hoped. The doctor pulled the Buchanans into Matthew's room and out of Destiny's earshot in order to have some privacy. Destiny tried to eavesdrop, without success. The doctor advised Matthew's parents that there had been complications during the procedure, and the bleeding had been worse than expected. She was not able to give a prognosis.\n\n\nThe doctor added that the trauma to the brain might cause the brain to swell, and Matthew was receiving drugs to control it. Nora questioned whether there would be a treatment in case things didn't go well, and the doctor stated that there were no treatments available.\n\n\nJust then, Matthew was wheeled back towards his room, and Destiny stopped the orderlies to see her friend. \"Oh, my God,\" Destiny could only manage to mutter through sobs. \"What happened?\" she cried to an unconscious Matthew. Bo and Nora followed behind their son as he was wheeled into his room. The doctor stressed that Matthew was stable. Nora pleaded with her son to get well, while Bo wished that he could trade places with Matthew.\n\n\nClint expressed his desire for Jessica to return before he died, while Joey spent some time in his father's hospital room. \"Tess is finally at St. Ann's,\" Clint revealed. He had paid a hefty price for Tess's commitment, and he suggested that Joey tell Aubrey to \"take a hike.\" Joey admitted that he had already confronted his wife, because \"life is too short.\" Aubrey had confessed to all she'd done, claimed to love Joey, and sworn she had changed, Joey disclosed. Clint hoped that Joey had thrown Aubrey out of the mansion and hadn't believed what Aubrey had said.\n\n\nJoey revealed that he was only worried about Ryder and didn't want the baby to go to a foster home. He agreed that he would \"kick Aubrey to the curb\" after Jessica returned. Joey wanted to be free, and he wanted to go back to Kelly. He asked about Clint's confessions, but Clint ordered Joey to just allow Clint to deal with it. It was time to settle \"all my accounts,\" Clint declared. He just wanted Joey to take care of Ryder, and he repeated that Cutter had driven a hard bargain.\n\n\nClint revealed that he'd had to give Cutter the mansion, and Joey reacted violently. He was unhappy that his father had been blackmailed, especially when his sister had needed the treatment at St. Ann's for months. Joey wished that he were more like Clint, because he would shoot Cutter. Clint assured Joey that Joey didn't want to be like his father. Clint grabbed his chest and urged Joey to find a new home. Joey hoped that his father would stay out of jail.\n\n\nAt Nate's apartment, Nate whispered to Deanna that he was certain that he was responsible for Matthew's head injury. Deanna thought that it was purely coincidental. Dani disclosed that she had been unable to obtain any information while on the phone with Destiny, and she clarified that Matthew had experienced a headache prior to being admitted to the hospital. That was the only thing that anyone knew. Nate was anxious to learn about Matthew's condition, and he assured Dani that he felt bad about Matthew, even though he wasn't a friend. Dani was suspicious.\n\n\nNate insisted that he wouldn't wish brain surgery even on an enemy, and he suggested that Dani go to the hospital to give Destiny some support. Dani agreed, and after she left, Nate was worried. \"Oh, my God. I did this,\" he said to Deanna. Matthew had fallen and hit his head after Nate had punched him. Deanna insisted that it couldn't be Nate's fault, ever after Nate pointed out that the same thing had happened to Natasha Richardson. Deanna was sure that it wasn't the same at all, and that Natasha had been skiing at a high speed.\n\n\nNate thanked Deanna for her \"voice of reason,\" as he grew anxious waiting for Dani's phone call. When he didn't hear, he phoned Dani, but he only listened to the ringing phone. He recalled that reception was bad at the hospital, but he couldn't wait. He had to get to the hospital to find out what was happening with Matthew.\n\n\nRex stopped at the diner to pick up some food for Natalie and spent some time with Gigi while he waited. He wondered why Clint had confessed to all of his crimes, but assumed that Clint had merely done it for himself. Shane arrived after an appointment with his new doctor and admitted that he liked Dr. Buhari more. The new doctor was confidant that Shane would be able to return to school in September, and Shane thought he might be okay by then. He gave Rex a card that he'd made for Natalie, and Rex left to visit his sister at the hospital.\n\n\nFord sat at a nearby table and looked longingly at a photo of Tess and Ryder. He found a pacifier hidden among his things and thought back to one of his encounters with Tess.\n\n\nGigi asked her son if he liked his new doctor. \"Whatever,\" Shane responded. He assumed he'd still be a loser when September arrived. Things were still the same, even if his parents had banned him from MyFace. Gigi assured him that he wouldn't have to return to school until he was ready. Just then, there was a crash in the kitchen, and Shane suggested that his mother investigate. Shane explained that he had been told to speak whatever was on his mind, and that was what he had done.\n\n\nAfter Gigi got up, Ford wandered over to speak to Shane. He admitted that he'd been in the same spot as Shane when he'd been in school. He showed Shane an old photo of himself and explained a little about what his home life had been like. Shane couldn't believe that he was looking at the same person. Ford revealed that kids had drawn pictures of him, put awful things in his backpack and had even forced him to eat garbage. He'd been skinny and had worn clothing that hadn't been very nice.\n\n\nFord continued that after he ate more, thanks to the men on the job that his father had obtained for him, and had begun to work out, things had changed. The guys at school had grown scared of him, and the girls had begun to like him. Ford offered to give Shane some workout tips.\n\n\nGigi summoned Shane to dinner. She thanked Ford for giving Shane some advice, and she declared Ryder a lucky boy to have Ford as a father. She also admitted that while she still didn't care for what Ford had done to Jessica, she hoped that Ford would receive custody of his son. \"Hoping isn't enough,\" Ford pronounced.\n\n\nLater, Shane asked his mother if it were possible for him to have a gym membership. Gigi was certain she could work something out. Shane thought that it might help him. Gigi also noted how happy she was to see Shane eat so much at dinner.\n\n\nViki hoped to visit with Tess at St. Ann's and muttered how relieved she would be when Jessica returned. Two orderlies struggled to drag a screaming, kicking, and straitjacketed Tess into a padded cell. Tess called Viki a bitch when she saw her mother observing nearby, and one of the orderlies suggested that Viki refrain from a visit with the violent patient. Viki insisted that she be allowed into the cell, and the orderly reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nViki entered the room, and Tess advised Viki that she was either \"brave or dumb.\" Viki explained that it was for Tess's own good, but Tess declared that she was ready to hurt Viki. Viki assured Tess that Tess was out of control, especially after ending up with a husband who had only wanted to sell her out. Tess had never known and had made a mistake, Viki declared. It was time for Jessica to return, Viki said. Tess declared that she was still there, she didn't lose, and Jessica would not be around.\n\n\nTess was insistent that she be able to live her own life, and she had plans to get out of St. Ann's. Viki pointed out that no one even cared about Tess, she had no money, and more men would only use her, like Cutter and Ford. Tess jumped in quickly, noting that Ford hadn't used her; he had wanted his son, and he wouldn't have gotten to his baby otherwise. Viki noted that it seemed as though Tess had feelings for Ford. Tess quickly denied it, adding that she hated Ford. \"Clearly,\" Viki said.\n\n\nTess explained that she'd been having fun, especially after she'd sent the photo of Echo and Charlie to Viki. She began to taunt Viki, in the hopes that Niki would emerge. She added that no one cared about Viki, either, because if they did, she and Viki would be roommates at St. Ann's. Viki pointed out that Tess lashed out at Viki whenever Tess was afraid that Jessica might return, but Tess denied it. Instead, she mentioned their past, and how Niki had allowed Jessica to be accosted, thus pushing Tess to the forefront.\n\n\nViki apologized again, and she pointed out that Niki had been the one guilty of that crime. Viki loved Tess, because Tess was part of Jessica. \"You love me?\" Tess inquired incredulously, as tears began to spill down her cheeks. Suddenly, Jessica appeared and began to ask where she was. \"Nice try,\" Viki stated. Tess told her to go to hell and suggested that Viki plan Jessica's funeral. Tess would rather die than allow Jessica to return. Viki was certain that Jessica would never permit that to happen.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Rama confessed that she was unable to tell Vimal the truth about her pregnancy, and she was shocked to learn that Aubrey had done her own confessing to Joey. Aubrey was adamant that she and Joey needed to stay together because of Ryder, and she was upset that she had hurt Joey with her scheming. The women were both surprised to see Cutter in the house, and he announced that he had some good news.\n\n\nCutter was bothered that Aubrey was still playing house with Joey, and he urged her to stop pretending. He showed the women that he had funds from Clint, and Rama was ecstatic, deeming them all \"set for life.\" Aubrey assured Cutter that she wasn't pretending, but Cutter declared that he wanted his girlfriend back. Aubrey insisted that she loved Joey, but Cutter replied that her love wasn't real. He proclaimed that he was finished with Tess and had arranged for Tess to go to St. Ann's.\n\n\nCutter added that once Jessica returned, she would take Ryder, and Aubrey would be kicked aside. Cutter was ready to give Aubrey everything she ever wanted. Rama announced that Joey knew everything there was to know about Aubrey, and she thought that Aubrey should take Cutter's deal, because Cutter was all that Aubrey would have left. Rama pointed out that Aubrey would be out on the street if it hadn't been for Ryder.\n\n\nRama wanted her share of Cutter's wealth. Cutter declared again that he loved Aubrey, and they were \"good to go.\" Aubrey replied that she loved Joey and wanted to make it up to him. Joey returned home and walked inside to hear Aubrey declaring her love for him. Aubrey swore that she loved Joey, not just Ryder. Rama believed that Aubrey was telling the truth.\n\n\nCutter recalled that he'd heard it all before. He saw Joey and laughed about how he and Aubrey had humiliated Joey. Cutter rubbed it in, relishing the ability to tell Joey how Aubrey had gone to bed with Cutter as they made fun of Joey. Cutter continued to mock Joey, as Aubrey tried to get Cutter to be quiet. Joey walked over and slugged Cutter instead, and the men began to fight. Rama managed to pull the men apart. Aubrey ordered Cutter to leave, but Cutter declared that it was his house. \"Get the hell out,\" Cutter shouted.\n\n\nRex looked in on Clint after he arrived at the hospital and admitted that he had been hoping to find Clint in handcuffs. Clint asked about his grandson, and Rex grew angry. Clint was not allowed to call Shane that, Rex proclaimed. Rex was irritated that Clint had confessed to everything except being Rex's father, but Clint insisted that hadn't been the point of his announcement. Rex thought that Clint really hated him, and he wondered why.\n\n\nRex didn't wait for Clint's answer, because he didn't think Clint was worth it. He recalled how Clint had shown up at the carriage house and had blamed Rex for all that had happened to Shane. If Rex was an awful father, then Clint was to blame, Rex declared. Clint maintained that he'd been concerned for his grandson, but Rex didn't want to hear it. Clint contended that Rex had done a good job with Shane, but Rex admitted that he was no better than Clint. He'd taken a page out of Clint's book and had hired thugs to beat up Jack Manning. Rex didn't want to be like Clint.\n\n\nDani arrived at the hospital and found Destiny. The girls hugged. Destiny disclosed that Matthew was in Intensive Care, and he'd looked awful when she'd seen him. She hadn't been allowed into the room, so she didn't know anything else. The girls couldn't imagine what was wrong, and all they knew was that Matthew had suffered from a headache.\n\n\nAs Bo and Nora visited with their son, the alarm on one of the machines that Matthew was hooked up to went off. The staff rushed into the room, sending Bo and Nora out to the hallway. Bo and Nora encountered Dani and Destiny and updated them on Matthew's condition. Everyone grew fearful as they waited for news. Finally, Bo and Nora saw the doctor and heard the news that Matthew was not doing well.\n\n\nMatthew's brain had swelled, the doctor advised the Buchanans. \"I'm sorry. We're not seeing brain activity,\" she informed them.\n\n\nDani and Destiny waited in the hallway. Dani tried to peer through the window of Matthew's room. She didn't think that things looked very good. Nate arrived as the girls were hugging again and consoling each other.\n\n\nAfter Viki had gone, Tess sat on the floor and screamed. She vowed to cut Cutter up into tiny pieces. Suddenly, she looked up. Ford was standing there in an orderly's garb.\n\n\nRex continued to berate his father, noting that he would do whatever it took to keep Clint away. He never wanted to be like Clint. Clint grabbed his chest again. Rex announced that the only father worse than Clint was the father that Clint had killed. Maybe Clint would die in jail, and that would be lucky, Rex went on. Just as Clint's monitor went off, Viki walked in. Rex looked back and forth, from Clint to the monitor and back again. \"Oh, my God,\" Viki gasped.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nate privately discusses with Deanna that he decked Matthew and injured him and that could be the cause of Matthew's head trauma. Dani enters and they are hesitant to reveal to her what they are talking about knowing that she has been with Destiny and Matthew's parents who reveal that Matthew might not recover. Cutter is confident that things will go his way after he got Clint to give him Asa's house if he (Cutter) agrees to get Tess put in St. Anne's. He wants to get back with Aubrey and have her dump Joey now that they no longer need her to be married to him in order to achieve their \"goal\". But she is done with Cutter and wants to make it up to Joey and declare that she loves him. Rex confronts Clint not knowing that he is dying. While Shane and Gigi are at Buenos Dias, Robert Ford talks to Shane about how his life was not much different when he was Shane's age and how he made things better with working out and getting older. Yet he may still have Tess on the brain and she-him. Viki goes to see Tess at St. Anne's telling her she has to let Jessica out but Tess is not going to budge regardless of anything Viki tells her.",
