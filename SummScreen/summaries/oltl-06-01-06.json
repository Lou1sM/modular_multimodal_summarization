    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian visits David in jail. Adriana honors Kelly's request, and brings her a pregnancy test. Blair and Starr stand vigil outside Todd's room. Spencer puts a heart attack inducing drug into Todd's I.V. Margaret has a flashback of memory about her and Todd. John fills Michael in that David Vicars is the one, who had killed their father. Paige is brought into the hospital. Bo tries to talk to her about making Spencer pay, but she tries to talk him out of it. Dorian visits Kelly and finds the pregnancy test. Natalie confirms that she believes that Spencer is behind this. Blair listens quietly. \"He is all over it Blair, and it is all going to come out.\" Later, Spencer sees John and Michael talking. Michael starts pushing to go over to Spencer in anger but John stops him. They leave. \"I wonder what they were saying about me,\" Spencer says. Blair ignores him. \"You don't believe I had anything to do with this do you?\" Bo gets a call to go and see Paige who has been admitted to the hospital and has Bo listed as her next of kin. Bo rushes over there and she tries to tell him about Margaret but he already knows. \"I know Paige,\" Bo tells. \"We think that Spencer has something to do with this and we are looking into that. Paige panics. \"No!\" she shouts. \"No! Not Spencer \" Margaret is in her cell pacing and panicking about her situation. A flash of an image comes to her mind. She sees Todd on his back, with his head turned from her and she is on top of him smiling. As quickly as the vision comes to her, it leaves her again. \"What was that?\" she asks herself. Dorian arrives at the hospital but Kelly isn't there. She is by the bed and sees the pregnancy test. \"Oh no Is Kelly pregnant with Duke's baby?\" she wonders. The door opens. \"What are you doing here?\" Kelly asks. Hugh is pushing her in the room using a wheelchair. David gets a visit from Dorian. He tells her what really happened and how he shot John's father. He wants her help but she can't give it to him. Bo comes in soon and tells David that there is a deal on the table and the first one who talks gets it. \"Doctors are already talking to Margaret, so don't take too long coming forward!\"",
