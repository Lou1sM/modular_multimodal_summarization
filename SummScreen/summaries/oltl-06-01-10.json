Langston spoke up quickly and advised Brody that Markko wasn't the one to commit the attack. Brody assured her they had evidence but Langston was adamant in her defense of Markko. She knew that someone as kind and gentle as Markko couldn't possibly have been capable of the act. T\u00e9a interrupted Langston and advised her that as Markko's attorney, she would be the one to defend Markko. T\u00e9a asked Brody for the warrant and she looked it over hastily.\n\n\nBrody announced that they had Markko's tossed-out sneakers in their possession with a bloody print. He knew they were Markko's sneakers because they had found the receipt in Markko's apartment. T\u00e9a began to protest, but Brody assured her there had been a warrant to search the apartment as well. T\u00e9a was unwavering in her belief that nothing could be proven, but Brody added that there had been an eyewitness who had seen Markko toss the sneakers away in the alley. The witness recognized Markko from the diner.\n\n\nT\u00e9a believed the evidence to be \"flimsy,\" but she sighed and advised Markko they would have to accompany the police to the station. Langston told Markko how sorry she was. \"It's a little late for that,\" Markko retorted. After the others were gone, Langston tried to reach Starr on the phone. She left a message and told her girlfriend that she knew Starr was angry at her, but she needed her best friend.\n\n\nJohn made a call to the hospital for an update on Ford's condition and learned that the patient was still critical. As he hung up the phone, Natalie walked into his office. \"I missed you,\" she told him. He assured her that he missed her, too, and they shared a kiss. Natalie wanted to talk about their new status and was perplexed that she hadn't heard anything from John since his revelation at the airport. She wanted to know if he was avoiding her. She couldn't believe that anything that had happened was even real. John assured her the scene at the airport had been real. Natalie mentioned that a lot had changed, and John told her that Brody had told him everything.\n\n\nNatalie was speechless as John clarified that he had heard about Jessica getting her memory back. Natalie snapped out of her momentary panic and stammered that she was surprised to hear that John had heard the news already. They spoke briefly about that, and Natalie commended him on his ability to change the subject. He told her that Marty had moved out of his place. Both Natalie and John agreed that it hadn't been their intent to hurt anyone, but Natalie wondered, \"What happens now?\" John agreed that they had to talk, but a knock on the door interrupted them. It was Brody, who announced that Markko was in custody and had obtained a lawyer even before his arrest.\n\n\nJohn walked out to check on things with Markko and left Natalie in his office with Brody. T\u00e9a stood by her conviction that the evidence the police had was negligible, but John assured her that the bloody sneaker matched a footprint found at the scene of the crime. Markko started to speak, but John urged him to remain silent and ordered his men to take Markko to his cell.\n\n\nIn John's office, Natalie wanted to finish her previous conversation with Brody regarding the night they slept together, and she wanted to know what they should do. Brody pronounced that they had done nothing wrong and they were both \"free agents\" at the time. \"Technically,\" Natalie replied. She felt like \"crap\" because she had betrayed Jessica and John. Both Brody and Natalie declared that they didn't want to have secrets from their partners, though Brody didn't think it was a good idea to tell Jessica. She was already quite stressed-out.\n\n\nNatalie pointed out that Jessica had been able to handle the news about Mitch and it had actually helped her. Natalie wasn't proud of her actions, but they agreed they both felt bad and had a lot to drink that night. They concurred the truth was important. John walked back into the office, and Natalie hurriedly stated that she hoped Ford's case would be solved as soon as possible.\n\n\nJohn apologized to Natalie, but he was busy and wouldn't have time to talk. He ordered a DNA test on the sneakers. Natalie agreed that they could talk another time but she admitted she was scared. They had tried a relationship before and it didn't work. John thought they would have to try harder, but he would probably still be unable to talk about their future. Natalie understood. John asked her to attend Bo's wedding with him.\n\n\nStarr visited with Cole, who was back in his cell after the prom. He thought that Starr could be wrong to trust her father's denial of committing a crime just as she was wrong about Langston. Starr insisted that she knew her dad well because they had a \"special connection.\" She believed that the two situations were not the same, though Cole reminded her that Langston had sworn on the girls' friendship that she had been telling the truth about Ford.\n\n\nStarr conceded that the circumstances were somewhat similar, but she was sticking to her belief that her dad was telling the truth. Cole found it difficult to understand why Starr couldn't accept the fact that Todd could be lying. Starr challenged Cole on his trust of Hannah. The couple continued to argue on the issue of Todd versus Hannah and who was telling the truth. Starr couldn't believe that Cole would base everything on a person he had only known for a few months. She added that the cops didn't know how unstable a person Hannah really was. Starr was beginning to doubt that she even knew Cole very well if he wouldn't listen to reason.\n\n\nHe suggested that perhaps Starr shouldn't visit him anymore, because the situation would wreck their relationship. Starr lamented that they were \"soul mates,\" and Cole urged her to hold on to that thought. Starr declared that she preferred to hold onto Cole, and she wanted him, not memories. She missed him a great deal, she cried to him.\n\n\nCole grew misty-eyed, too, and he stated that he would close his eyes and remember how beautiful she looked at the prom. He thought that night would remind them of their love and Starr should hold onto that until they could \"share the same truth.\" As he grabbed her hand through the cell bars, Starr whispered that they really were \"star-crossed lovers.\" She walked out.\n\n\nCole heard that there were visitors, but he didn't want to see anyone. Markko announced that he wasn't visiting, and he was led into the cell across from Cole. Markko told his friend why he was there and admitted that, while he hadn't committed the attack, he thought that Ford deserved to die. T\u00e9a ordered Markko to be quiet. She didn't want him to discuss the case with anyone, even his best friends. They had to hope that there wouldn't be a murder charge.\n\n\nBo spotted Jessica at the hospital and he asked why she was there. Jessica admitted that she had recovered her memory, and Bo was thrilled. She admitted that she was there to talk to Marty and congratulated him on his wedding. She planned on attending. Bo wanted to know if Jessica remembered everything, and Jessica disclosed that she wasn't sure. She had been through an emotional trauma and was afraid it could happen again down the road. She might lose something else and wondered if she could lose minutes of her time and not just years like last time. Bo thought it was a good idea for Jessica to talk to Marty.\n\n\nJust then, a nurse approached Bo with information on Ford. She told him it didn't look good. Bo wondered if his niece knew Ford, and she mentioned that she had met him a couple of times because he was a roommate of Layla and Cristian. She hoped they were okay. Bo suggested that it might be possible to find the suspect if the police had a motive. Jessica had something she wanted to say to Bo but was forced to put it on hold when Bo received a phone call.\n\n\nBo learned that a suspect had been taken into custody for Ford's assault, and he related the information to Jessica. She was clearly happy to hear the news as Bo asked her what she had been about to tell him. She told him how grateful she was for her family putting up with her behavior. Bo assured her he loved her and she was family. He would always be there for her if she needed someone to talk to. He walked away, and a relieved Jessica muttered, \"Thank God it wasn't me.\"\n\n\nNora showed up at Llanfair to ask Viki for a favor. She explained that Rachel was sick and wouldn't be able to attend Nora's wedding. Viki promised to have lots of pictures taken, but Nora divulged that she had another request. She knew it was last-minute, but she wondered if Viki would be her matron of honor. Viki heartily agreed and offered to help Nora with whatever was needed. Nora wasn't sure what she had to do. She recalled how Viki had married Charlie and she had married Clint only the year before. \"We all know how that turned out,\" Clint stated as he walked into the room behind Nora.\n\n\nHe proclaimed that he had received an invitation to Nora's wedding and thought perhaps it had been a mistake. Nora assured him he was invited, but Clint turned his back on her and began to talk to Viki. He was merely there to check on Jessica. Viki assured him their daughter was doing well, and Nora was elated to hear that Jessica's memory had returned. Clint ignored Nora as Viki revealed that she thought there was still something bothering Jessica, who was extremely remorseful about all of the people she had hurt. Nora thought Jessica's behavior was normal and the young woman was still trying to sort things out.\n\n\nNora offered to help Jessica, since she had gone through a similar event, and both Clint and Viki thanked her. Nora needed to leave because she had a million things to do, and there was an awkward moment with Clint. She hoped he would attend the wedding and regretted everything that had occurred between them. Clint hoped she would understand if he didn't attend, but Nora was disappointed. She thought they had reached an understanding and knew it would mean a great deal to Bo. As if on cue, Bo entered the room with Jessica and assured Clint that was true. Viki and Clint learned that Jessica had resolved a lot of matters at the hospital.\n\n\nBo asked his brother if he would attend the wedding, but Clint revealed that he didn't know if he were up to it. Bo understood but added that it would \"mean the world\" to him if Clint showed up. Viki thought that Jessica was in a better frame of mind, and Jessica informed her that she had apologized to Cristian. He had been sweet, but she still wanted to talk to Layla. Just then, Brody arrived, and Jessica asked him about the arrest. She also asked him to accompany her to the wedding.\n\n\nAs Todd held Hannah captive in his office at the Sun, he displayed photos of Ford after his attack. Hannah shied away from looking at them and denied that she knew Ford. Todd pointed out that Hannah had lied when she stated that Todd had pushed Marty down the stairs, and he was certain she was lying again. He called her pathological.\n\n\nHannah assured him that she wasn't lying and she would not sign anything he might force upon her. She asked if Todd were planning to torture her. Todd shoved the pictures in her face as she cringed. He wanted to plan the cover story for his newspaper's next edition and was sure that Hannah's path had crossed with Ford's at some point. He was certain that Hannah knew Ford, and suddenly he recalled that Hannah had taken pills after a guy had dumped her. Hannah spat that it was none of Todd's business. He grabbed her face and squeezed it. He advised her that she was the only thing standing between him and his freedom, and that made it his business.\n\n\nTodd continued to try to obtain information from Hannah, but she refused to talk. Instead, she began to cry, and Todd thought it strange that she seemed to be upset about Ford. He questioned why she didn't ask if the police had found the attacker, and suddenly she inquired whether they knew anything. Todd assured her the police didn't have any information. Suddenly, he told his henchmen to let Hannah leave. No one would have seen her enter or leave, and people would think she was crazy if she told them she had been kidnapped. Once Hannah was gone, Todd ordered his men to follow her.\n\n\nLater, one of the men returned to the office and advised his boss that Todd should have gotten a confession from Hannah. Todd pointed out that was why he was the boss and the other man the muscle. He had only wanted to upset Hannah, but he realized that the young woman was a liar and a \"gift that keeps on giving.\" He had done some research and he thought that Hannah had another victim.\n\n\nLangston was relieved when Starr arrived at the diner. She wanted to know if her friend had seen Markko at the jail, but Starr was confused. Langston explained that Markko had been arrested for the assault on Ford, and Starr was shocked. Langston declared that Markko had a good lawyer, but she knew that he was innocent. She blamed herself for Markko's predicament, and she needed Starr desperately. Starr confided that she needed Langston too.\n\n\nMarkko thought that things had gotten out of hand, and Cole could only feel sad about the terrible events that had consumed the four friends.\n\n\nHannah showed up at the hospital and attempted to obtain information on Ford's condition. The nurse asked if she were a relative. \"A friend who cares what happens to him,\" Hannah responded.\n\n\nNora and Bo snuggled up to each other in bed. Nora pointed out that it was the last night they would be \"living in sin.\" Bo declared that \"tomorrow can't come soon enough.\" They kissed, and a musical montage began. Set to \"My Shadow\" by Keane, Clint left Llanfair and looked at his wedding invitation again. Viki looked in on Brody and Jessica and smiled to herself. John was pleasantly surprised when Natalie delivered a meal to his desk. Todd worked busily on creating his newspaper's new front page. T\u00e9a comforted Markko as Cole looked on from his own cell. Starr and Langston, both close to tears, sat at the diner.\n\n\nSuddenly, the alarm clock sounded and the sun streamed through the window. \"It's morning, Red,\" Bo announced with a big smile. \"It's time to get married.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Markko gets arrested and taken to jail for the attempted murder of Ford although Tea is ready to defend him. Ole is also in jail and he and Starr still can't come to terms with the fact that she believes her dad did not push his mom down the stairs and that Hannah is lying. Meanwhile, Todd is confident he \"has the goods\" on Hannah and is ready to write an article in the Sun that she looks like a suspect to want to kill Ford and therefore has no credibility with her accusation of him (Todd). Bo and Nora are ready to get married. Jessica has her memory back and is relieved to see that it appears she is not a suspect for what happened to Ford. Yet Natalie and Brody wonder if they should reveal to Jessica and to John that they slept together.",
