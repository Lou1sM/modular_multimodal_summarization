Continuing the charade, Antonio stated that Talia's downfall was the result of her own negligence. John announced that he had a few words for Ramsey and planned to wait for him in the commissioner's office; Antonio followed behind. Inside the office, Antonio told John that Ramsey orchestrated the robbery at the art gallery and gave him orders to set Talia up to take the fall. John was certain that Ramsey was testing Antonio. For Eddie's benefit, John and Antonio made certain to raise their voices and argue-but at the same time the two discussed that Ramsey stole the jewels for the purpose of protecting someone. \n\n\nAt Ramsey's penthouse, Ramsey placed the stolen jewels in the hands of his unknown \"houseguest\" and stated, \"They're beautiful, just like you.\" Ramsey told the woman that the jewels would pay for the doctors who would make her better again. As Ramsey placed the jewels in a safe in the wall and covered it with a picture, the woman's caregiver entered the room with a plate of food. She informed Ramsey that the woman hadn't been eating lately. Lovingly, Ramsey looked down at his houseguest and asked her to eat for him. \n\n\nAs John and Antonio discussed strategy in Ramsey's office, the men began to argue once again when Ramsey entered. Ramsey warned John that he would be unemployed if he continued to harass Antonio and proceeded to kick him out of the office. Alone with Antonio, Ramsey questioned him about his confrontation with John. Before leaving the office, Antonio reminded Ramsey that Jamie needed to see a specialist. Ramsey assured Antonio that he would receive his money as soon as Ramsey received his. \n\n\nBack at Ramsey's penthouse, the caregiver attempted to feed Ramsey's houseguest, but the woman became combative. Frightened, the caregiver took off to find Ramsey. \n\n\nWhile John and Antonio kept their eyes on Ramsey, the frantic caregiver arrived at the police station. Ramsey demanded to know why the caregiver left \"her\" alone. As John and Antonio listened, the caregiver informed Ramsey that he was needed at home because the woman was out of control. Unconcerned by John and Antonio's presence, Ramsey headed home to take care of his houseguest. Ramsey and the caregiver entered the penthouse. As the houseguest shook uncontrollably, Ramsey showed her a picture and reminded her that the memory in the photograph always calmed her down. As the woman grasped the picture, she grew calm. \n\n\nLater, John and Antonio discussed the fact that Ramsey was hiding someone in his penthouse-they were determined to find out who and why. \n\n\nAt Foxy Roxy's, Viki confronted Roxy about involving Charlie in her scheme. Roxy begged Viki to convince Charlie not to tell Rex the truth. After expressing her displeasure with Roxy's deception, Viki informed Roxy that she couldn't tell Charlie anything because he was missing. Viki demanded answers from Roxy, but Roxy refused to talk. \n\n\nIn her bedroom, Dorian held a bottle of vodka and stared down at an unconscious Charlie. She looked up at the heavens and proclaimed to Mel (Mel was her alcoholic ex-husband), \"I know you are watching this and I'm really sorry, but I have to finish what I started.\" Dorian then poured the liquor down Charlie's throat. With a smile, she told Charlie that Viki and Jared would both think he returned to his old ways. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs, David attempted to prevent Jared from entering, but Jared forced his way inside. When Jared advised David to keep his secret, David informed him that for the right price he would keep quiet, but stated that Dorian would never remain silent. Because he had dirt on Dorian, Jared was unconcerned about her spilling the beans and promised to pay David off. When Dorian entered the room, she and David began taunting Jared about his pretense of being a Buchanan. Dorian assured Jared that she had no intention of telling anyone and reminded him that he would be late for the annual stockholder's meeting if he didn't hurry. Dorian told Jared that she couldn't care less if he and Charlie wanted to carry on their ridiculous charade. Although Jared was suspicious, he hurried off to attend the meeting. \n\n\nAlone with Dorian, David asked her if the \"Charlie\" she mentioned to Jared was the same \"Charlie\" that Viki was looking for. In an attempt to get rid of David, Dorian convinced him that he was in desperate need of a facial. As David headed out the door, he ran into two suspicious characters who Dorian had summoned. After kicking David out, Dorian told the men to head upstairs and place Charlie in the limousine. She advised them that they would drop him off somewhere. \n\n\nDavid arrived at Foxy Roxy's for a facial, but encountered Viki. Attempting to avoid any further questioning from Viki, Roxy exited the salon in a hurry. When David asked Viki if he could help her, Viki stated that the only way he could help her is if he had information concerning Charlie's whereabouts. Viki related to David that Charlie sent her a strange text message, and she was suspicious because Charlie had never communicated to her through text messaging. Sensing Viki was hurting, David had a flashback of Dorian sending a text message on a \"second\" cell phone that she claimed to be hers. David announced to Viki, \"I think I might know where your boyfriend is!\" \n\n\nIt was a full house at the annual meeting of the Shareholders of Buchanan Enterprises. Members of the press questioned Clint and Bo about their use of underhanded tactics regarding the hostile takeover attempts, but they denied any wrongdoing. The brothers were greeted by their significant others-Nora and Lindsay. The foursome attempted to get along and put aside their differences and enjoy the special day. However, Nora became agitated when Clint and Bo thanked Lindsay for the help she provided them in their time of need. Anxious to begin the meeting, Clint and Bo were bothered that Jared hadn't arrived. Natalie was also concerned that Jared wasn't present and feared the worst when she was unable to reach him. \n\n\nRex encountered Gigi at the meeting. Gigi apologized for interrupting Rex and Adriana's wedding. Gigi's hopes were high when Rex told her that he hated what happened. She believed Rex might have regrets over marrying Adriana, but her hopes were dashed when Rex related that he hated that Adriana had struck her. Rex remarked how wonderful it was that Brody came back into Shane's life. Gigi sadly agreed and walked away. Afterwards, Rex stood alone and appeared conflicted. \n\n\nJessica promised Natalie that she would tell Nash that she was pregnant right after the meeting. Nash nearly overheard Jessica and Natalie discussing the pregnancy. Malcolm, the investor, approached Nash and informed him that he was a shareholder and reminded Nash that he hadn't received an offer from BE to buy out the vineyard. After assuring Malcolm that the offer was on the way, Nash told Jessica, Natalie, and Sarah that Jared had helped save his vineyard by promising to bail him out with BE funds. Jessica and Sarah were surprised. As she listened to Nash refer to Jared as a member of the family, Natalie looked guilty. Later, Jessica mentioned how surprised she was to learn that Charlie had lied about being Rex's father. When Jessica stated that she thought Charlie was a good guy, Natalie quickly defended Charlie. Jessica was curious to know why Natalie would defend the man who had hurt their mother, but Jared arrived and Natalie broke away to question him. Jared assured Natalie that Dorian and David were taken care of, but Natalie was skeptical. \n\n\nDressed in black and sporting a huge hat, Dorian admired herself in the mirror and exclaimed, \"It's showtime!\" \n\n\nIn an alley, Dorian instructed her cohorts to dump Charlie's unconscious body over a pile of garbage. She placed his cell phone in his pocket and poured a bottle of vodka over his body. Dorian headed off to attend the shareholder's meeting. As Charlie slowly began to regain consciousness, he mumbled Viki's name. \n\n\nBack at the stockholder's meeting, Nash approached Jared and informed him that Malcolm wanted to close the deal immediately. Jared stated that he hadn't spoken to Clint and Bo yet, but assured Nash that it was a done deal. As Natalie watched, Nash thanked Jared and welcomed him to the Buchanan family. With Jared present, the Buchanans prepared to start the meeting. \n\n\nClint proudly introduced the members of the Buchanan family. He informed the stockholders that BE had encountered several hostile takeover attempts since Asa's death, but persevered. As he assured everyone that BE was still on top, Dorian appeared and announced that she wanted to make a statement. Dorian shocked everyone when she remarked that the Buchanans were perpetrating a fraud. A panicked Natalie told Jared that they needed to stop Dorian. Jared replied, \"It's too late.\" Clint and Bo attempted to prevent her from speaking, but the stockholders demanded that she be heard. A deafening silence filled the room, as Dorian announced that Jared was not a Buchanan. \n\n\nWith a look of disgust, Rex brushed past Dorian. Rex mumbled to himself that Dorian had gone too far this time. As he stood out in the hall, he opened his portfolio. Stunned, Rex read the words that were cut out and pasted on a sheet of paper. The words read, \"YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN LYING TO YOU!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian is up to no good. She has Charlie upstairs in her bedroom drugged and unconscious and she is ready to \"dispose\" of him by a dumpster. She has some guys take him to an alley and leave him unconscious. She pours booze all over him so that even if Viki or Jared do find him, they will assume he's gotten into a severe drinking bout yet again. David knows something is going on yet she won't trust him to know what she's doing. Viki runs into David and admits that she is very upset not being able to find Charlie. David then tells her he might be able to help her. Dorian then goes to the B.E. board meeting and announces that they have all committed fraud to their shareholders by passing Jared off as Asa Buchanan's son. Meanwhile, Antonio and John are trying to uncover the secret and the dirty they need on Ramsey, while they play their roles to both Ramsey and Eddie, pretending that they hate each other and that Talia has dumped Antonio for John.",
