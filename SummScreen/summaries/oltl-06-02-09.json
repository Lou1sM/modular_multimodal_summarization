    "soap_central": "\nMother Knows Bess\n\n\n \nOutside La Boulaie, on the terrace, Blair and Starr talked about Starr's daughter. Starr was conflicted about handing the baby over to Marcie. Blair advised Starr to focus on Hope's safe return. The rest, Blair assured Starr, could wait until later. \n\n\nInside La Boulaie, Langston called Markko while Dorian hovered in the background. When Markko answered his cell phone, Langston jokingly greeted Markko with a sexy, \"Hello, Lover.\" Markko was horrified when Langston confessed that Dorian had heard the intimate greeting. Dorian played along with Langston, teasing Markko, until Langston shooed Dorian away. Dorian turned toward the terrace just as Blair and Starr entered through the French doors. \n\n\nDorian was delighted to see Blair and Starr. Langston ended her call then joined her family. Dorian demanded to know what had possessed Blair to move in with Todd. Blair brushed the question off. Instead, Blair told Dorian and Langston that Starr's baby was alive. Dorian was furious when she learned that Jessica had switched the babies shortly after their births. Dorian's anger reached the boiling point when she was told that Jessica had suffered a breakdown and ran away with Starr's baby. \n\n\nStarr clarified to Dorian that she was concerned for her cousin, not angry. Dorian was confident that the Buchanans would rally around Jessica to help her through the ordeal. Dorian assured Starr that Jessica would be fine. Starr disagreed; eventually Jessica had to face the reality that her daughter had died. Starr did not wish that on anyone. Dorian wisely held her tongue until Starr and Langston had left the room. \n\n\nAs soon as the young girls were out of earshot, Dorian began complaining. Dorian was certain that Viki, Clint, and Bo would blame the baby's kidnapping on Jessica's mental illness. Dorian was disgusted over the idea that the Buchanans would get away with the crime. Blair refused to listen to Dorian's ranting. She ordered Dorian to stay out of it. \n\n\nDorian shifted gears; she confessed that she had been in desperate need of good news. Blair was curious why Dorian had been troubled. Dorian told Blair about Lola's confession and Ray's decision to institutionalize his homicidal daughter. Blair was shocked by the revelation. Blair also sensed that Dorian's feelings for Ray went beyond mere friendship. Dorian admitted that she cared deeply for Ray. \n\n\nRachel and Cole shared a booth at the diner. Cole told Rachel about the startling turn of events with his daughter. Rachel couldn't believe that Hope was alive. She asked Cole how he was handling the news. Cole realized that Rachel was concerned that he might relapse. Cole assured Rachel that, for the sake of his daughter, he was more determined than ever to stay away from drugs. \n\n\nMoments later, Nora entered the diner. Cole asked Nora if there had been any news about Hope. Nora told Cole that Bo had raced out of the police station shortly after receiving a lead on Jessica's whereabouts. Cole thanked Nora for the information, then excused himself so that he could talk to Markko. \n\n\nNora took Cole's vacated seat. Rachel asked Nora how Clint had taken the news about the baby switch. As Nora filled her daughter in on the details, she mentioned her engagement to Clint. Rachel was surprised by the announcement. She asked Nora how it had come about. Nora confessed that the proposal had been a result of an argument between Bo and Clint. Nora explained that Clint had walked in moments after Bo and Nora had nearly kissed. Clint's jealousy had led him to ask for Nora's hand in marriage. \n\n\nRachel wondered if her mother had made the right decision by accepting the proposal. Nora insisted that she had. Rachel had her doubts. Rachel suspected that something was brewing between Nora and Bo. Nora asked what Rachel wanted her to do, if she should call off her engagement. Rachel turned the question on Nora. She asked if Nora wanted to call off the engagement. Nora remained silent. \n\n\nIn the diner's kitchen, Cole told Markko that Hope was alive. Markko was thrilled for his friend, but sensed that Cole remained troubled. Cole admitted that he had lied, claiming that he had a drug test, in order to get away from Starr. Cole confessed that he had felt overwhelmed by everything. \n\n\nAt the same moment, Langston entered Starr's bedroom. Starr had been watching the video message she had taped for Hope, so that her daughter would know that her birth mother had loved her. Langston wanted to know how her friend was holding up. Starr confided that everything seemed surreal to her. Starr also admitted that she was concerned; she suspected that Cole had lied about his drug test in an effort to avoid her. \n\n\nAt the diner, Markko asked Cole what the plans were for Hope after her safe return. Markko wondered if Starr had changed her mind about the adoption. Cole admitted that, if Starr had decided to keep the baby, she hadn't told him. However, Cole was certain that Starr would never go back on her word to Marcie. \n\n\nCole made it clear that he had no intention of asking Starr to reconsider the adoption. Cole had made peace with the decision. He owed his life to Starr and he would support her decision, whatever it was. Markko advised Cole to hold onto that feeling during the difficult days ahead. \n\n\nBack in Starr's bedroom, Starr revealed that she had second thoughts about handing Hope over to Marcie. However, Starr intended to honor her promise to Marcie. Starr didn't feel as if she had any other alternative because she had practically begged Marcie to raise Hope. Starr couldn't bring herself to hurt Marcie. Starr realized that it was going to be much more difficult to walk away from Hope than she had initially thought. \n\n\nLangston distracted her friend by mentioning the prom. Starr wanted to hear all of the details. Langston told Starr about Lola's breakdown and the attempt Lola had made to ruin Langston's special night. Starr was appalled by what Lola had done. As the two friends talked, a soft knock on the door interrupted them. It was Markko. He had snuck into La Boulaie. To Starr's delight, Markko had company: Cole. \n\n\nBo ordered the police to surround the Brennan residence. As the rain poured down, Viki and Clint huddled together while Bo tried to negotiate Bess's surrender over a police cruiser's loudspeakers. \n\n\nInside the house, the Brennans held each other while Bess stood by the door, clutching the baby close to her. Bess refused to surrender. She turned to the Brennans to ask them if there was another way out of the house. Phil pointed out that the police had surrounded the house, so there was no means of escape. Phil and Cindy decided that they wanted to hear what the police had to say. Bess warned the Brennans that if they allowed the police to enter, the people with the police would take their granddaughter away forever. When that failed to gain her cooperation, Bess resorted to threats. \n\n\nBess was unaware that Brody had regained consciousness until it was too late. Bess raced upstairs to lock herself in a bedroom. Brody was close on her heels. Meanwhile, the Brennans braced themselves for the worst, then opened the front door. \n\n\nOutside, Viki pleaded with Bo to give Brody the opportunity to get through to Jessica. Bo claimed that time was of the essence because they had no idea if the baby was safe. Moments before Bo prepared to storm the house, the Brennans opened the front door. Bo, Viki, and Clint raced into the house. \n\n\nUpstairs, Brody tried his best to persuade Bess to open the door. Bess refused to consider it. She remained determined to find a means of escape. Bess was certain that if she handed the baby over to the authorities, Jessica would be forever destroyed. However, Bess had no idea what her next move should be. The dilemma weakened Bess enough to allow Tess's personality to emerge. Tess accused Bess of failing to protect Jessica. Tess demanded that Bess allow Jessica to deal with the truth. Bess eventually managed to regain control of Jessica's mind. \n\n\nDownstairs, Viki was desperate to find a peaceful resolution to Jessica's dire situation. Viki suggested posing as Jean Randolph, one of her alter personalities. Viki was confident that Bess would respond to Jean because they played the same role in the personality disorder. Clint worried about the effect it would have on Viki. Viki assured Clint that she knew what she was doing. Bo was hesitant, as well, but ultimately agreed to give Viki's plan a try. Bo warned Viki that she would only have fifteen minutes to convince Jessica to hand over the child. \n\n\nOutside, Jared and Natalie approached Phil and Cindy. Natalie told the Brennans that she and Jared had known Nash. Natalie also revealed that Nash had a beautiful little girl named Bree. Natalie held out a picture of her niece. The Brennans were overjoyed by the news. Jared and Natalie told the Brennans that Nash had been a good man. Cindy revealed that during one of Jessica's more rational moments, she had given the Brennans the impression that she had found someone else to love. \n\n\nUpstairs, Viki asked Bess to open the door. Bess ignored Viki's request until Viki introduced herself as Jean Randolph. Viki managed to convince Bess that Jean was there to help Bess find a logical solution to her problem. Bess opened the door.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Viki, Clint and Bo find Bess at Nash's parents' home. Brody comes to and attempts to convince her to give herself up. Tess also comes out and tells her she has no choice. But she does not listen. At that point, Viki determines that maybe she can get through to Bess by acting as Jean Randolph. Meanwhile, Starr and Cole wonder what to do with the fact that when Hope comes back they need to figure out whether to keep her or let Marcie and Michael adopt her. After Dorian finds out what happened, she tells Blair and Starr that they cannot allow Viki's family to get away with taking Starr's baby and having everybody believing she died. She also reveals to Blair that Ray is in a crises with his daughter being sent to St. Anne's. Blair acknowledges that her aunt has real feelings for Ray Montez.",
