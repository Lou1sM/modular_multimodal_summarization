    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Bo and Nora's garret apartment, the alarm clock began to ring, awakening the happy couple.  Bo slammed his hand down on the clock to silence it, while the sleepy Nora asked him what time it was.  \"Time to get married,\" Bo replied, cuddling up to his once and future bride.  Nora was excited, but couldn't help lamenting that Rachel was in Chicago, sick with the stomach flu; Bo told her that Rachel would be there in spirit, and theirs would be a perfect wedding day.  No sooner did the words fall from his lips, however, than a dark cloud appeared on the horizon just outside their bedroom window.\n\n\nConcerned by the clouds, Bo and Nora checked the weather forecast on Bo's laptop, and were shocked to discover a severe storm heading for Llanview, complete with hurricane winds.  Nora was fearful for the wedding, and wondered if Andrew had made it back from out of town in time to officiate at the ceremony.  Bo told Nora to relax; he said it was merely a \"summer storm,\" and that nothing could make their day not perfect.  Sharing a kiss, the couple reflected on how their second wedding would be their best - they had Matthew, and a sense of what life was like without each other.  Bo left Nora to get ready, as he got dressed.\n\n\nIn the living room, Matthew was on the phone with Danielle, who was at the Buenos Dias staring at the front page of the Sun, which had a headline all about Markko's arrest.  Danielle stared distractedly at the paper as Matthew attempted to apologize for his romantic outburst on their date, and she only grew more inattentive when Nate entered the cafe.  Matthew asked her if she still wanted to accompany him to the wedding.  \"Sure,\" Danielle replied hesitantly.  As Matthew struggled to find the words to express his conflicted feelings, there was a knock at the front door, and he was forced to tell Danielle goodbye.\n\n\nMatthew answered the garret's front door and welcomed Destiny in.  Destiny showed him the Sun headline about Markko, and asked him if he could believe the craziness with Markko, Ford, and Langston.  She felt guilty about her role in telling Markko of Langston's affair, but Matthew said she couldn't blame herself for doing right by a friend.  \"Jealousy's a killer, isn't it?\" Destiny sighed, while Matthew's thoughts turned to Danielle and Nate.\n\n\nMatthew told Destiny she'd been right before; he'd been a fool to tell Danielle he loved her so soon.  Upon reconsideration, Destiny didn't agree, and said she felt it was best to be forthright, as she'd been with Matthew regarding her own crush on him.  She urged him to call Danielle back and clear things up; she promised to be by his side no matter how Danielle reacted.  Matthew thanked her for being such a good friend.\n\n\nBefore Matthew could redial Danielle, Bo bounded into the living room, ready for his big day.  He greeted Destiny and told her she was welcome to take Darren as her date to the wedding.  The more the merrier, he figured; he was going to have the perfect wedding day with the perfect bride.  His triumphant moment was shattered, however, as Nora howled in agony from the bedroom.\n\n\nMoments later, Bo helped a pained Nora into the living room; she'd accidentally used exfoliant instead of the eye drops for her contact lenses, and was temporarily blinded in one eye.  Wincing at her mishap, Matthew and Destiny attempted to cheer her up by offering her a takeout breakfast of coffee and bagels.  Touched, Nora bit into a bagel, still on cloud nine about her \"perfect day.\"  One second later, she chipped her tooth on a walnut seed, and fled to check out the damage in the bathroom.\n\n\nAs Nora rushed to the bathroom, Bo answered the phone; it was the wedding singer, who was inexplicably demanding Bo's presence at St. James' Church.  Bo couldn't imagine what the problem was, but before he could ponder it further, Nora let out another mournful cry from the bathroom.  As Bo ushered her back into the room, he and Matthew encouraged her to let them see how her mouth looked - after all, they didn't see how much trouble \"one little chipped tooth\" could cause.  Her spirits bolstered, Nora smiled at her family, and revealed a huge gap-toothed grin.  As Matthew and Destiny looked on in slack-jawed horror, Bo kept on his game face, lied to his bride, and told her she looked wonderful.\n\n\nAfter Nora plastered a bandage to her injured eye, she and Destiny bid a happy goodbye to Bo and Matthew, who were headed for the church.  Father and son were all smiles until the front door closed, after which they both looked mortified by Nora's condition.\n\n\nInside the apartment, Nora grabbed her wedding dress and shoes, and told Destiny she'd drop the girl off at home on her way to Foxy Roxy's, so Destiny could get changed.  Destiny asked Nora if it was true she and Bo were legendary dancers, and wondered if they'd cut a rug at the wedding.  \"Just you wait,\" Nora vowed, then promptly tripped over her own dress, and crashed to the floor.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi and Rex returned home to find Shane and Roxy snoozing in sleeping bags in the living room.  As Roxy struggled to rouse herself, Shane leaped to his feet and welcomed his parents home with hugs.  Shane wanted to know if they'd found his grandparents, but Roxy was far more interested in whether Rex and Gigi had gotten back together.  As Roxy began to outline a variety of lurid, romantic scenarios involving their cramped New Mexico hotel quarters, Shane stuck his fingers in his ears and began loudly singing to himself.  Rex told them they'd been more focused on the search for his birth parents, and it was a long story, but Roxy asked to hear it later, as she had to head to the Hair Haven in order to make Nora's wedding day beautiful.\n\n\nAfter Roxy left, Rex and Gigi told Shane the story of their quest while helping him clean up after his and Roxy's sleepover.  Gigi pointedly cut Rex off before he could mention their brief incarceration, and told Shane all about Rick and Lili's love letters.  When she mentioned the pregnancy that had driven the lovers apart, Shane reflected on the similarities between them and Rex and Gigi.  He was sad to hear that Lili had died, but wondered where Rick was.  Rex explained that an Internet search had turned up no one, but Shane wasn't sure that Rick wouldn't find them after all.\n\n\nRex showed Shane the Native American quilt Lili had been knitting for him as a baby; he explained that the quilt was a part of their family's culture, as Lili had been a member of the Hopi tribe, which Shane had learned about in school.  Shane marveled at being of Native American ancestry, but he and Rex agreed that the latter-day family was great as well.  Shane prepared to leave for a friend's birthday party, and asked if he'd see Rex later, as Rex still wasn't living at the carriage house.  Rex promised to be back first thing the next day.\n\n\nWith Shane gone, Gigi prodded Rex, and was shocked that he'd almost mentioned their getting thrown into the county jail.  Rex nudged her back, and in short order they were engaged in friendly horseplay and a pillow fight.  Drawing close together, Rex grew serious, and thanked Gigi for being there, and for everything she'd done for him.  The exes almost kissed, but were stopped by the sound of rolling thunder.\n\n\nPulling away, Rex commented that it sounded like rain, and that he had to go to get ready for Bo and Nora's wedding.  Gigi told him he didn't need to be uncomfortable about it, as she was invited too.  They agreed that they were happy for the reunited couple, and as Rex left, he told Gigi he had a feeling it would be a great night.\n\n\nAt the police station, John received a file of new evidence on the Ford case.  As he took it, he glanced down at the Sun and the grisly photos of Ford's injuries.\n\n\nOutside Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven, Jessica, Viki, and Natalie arrived to get their hair done for the wedding.  As Jessica picked up a copy of the Sun and stared at the headline about Markko and Ford with consternation, Natalie received a call on her phone, from Brody.  She told Viki and Jessica to head inside.\n\n\nAlone on the street, Natalie spoke in hushed tones with Brody, who was at the station.  She agreed that they needed to clear things up, and that they didn't have to tell Jessica or John about their night together.  She explained that they'd done nothing wrong, as they were both single, two lonely friends looking for comfort.  Brody told her there was no need for Jessica to know the truth, as he didn't want her hurt.\n\n\nAt the station, Brody hung up, and noticed John standing behind him in the corridor.  John asked if he'd heard something about Jessica being hurt, but Brody assured him that Jess was fine.  John showed Brody the new evidence in the Ford case - the Buenos Dias kitchen sink Markko had washed his hands in tested positive for traces of Ford's blood.  Brody was reasonably convinced Markko was guilty, but John wasn't sure; he knew Ford had gotten around with many jilted young ladies, and Brody admitted that Layla had told him Ford had even hit on Jessica.\n\n\nHeading for John's office, Brody and John continued to debate the case.  Brody laid out the evidence against Markko, including the blood in the sink and his sneakers, not to mention motive and opportunity.  Still, John found it too easy; he added that the case against Todd also seemed too pat, and that he'd begun to doubt Hannah's testimony.  On top of those cases, there was still the murder of Melinda Cramer to consider, which had become a local case due to Rodney's death within city limits.  Brody asked John if he was looking for an excuse to get out of Bo and Nora's wedding, but John said that for Bo he'd go anywhere.\n\n\nBrody reflected on how Bo and Nora had found their way back together, just as he and John found their way back to Jessica and Natalie.  Letting his tongue slip, he mentioned how John wouldn't have even thought of letting Natalie down if he'd seen her after her drunken night at Rodi's.  John asked if Brody had seen her that night, and Brody quickly covered, admitting she'd visited him to say goodbye after seeing John and Marty kiss.  As Brody headed for the door, John thanked him for being a good friend to Natalie.  Swallowing his guilt, Brody left the office.\n\n\nBack at Foxy Roxy's, Jessica was still transfixed by the Sun as she and Viki waited for Natalie and Roxy.  Viki couldn't believe Markko could have savagely beaten a man, but Jessica remained mum.  As Natalie entered, she downplayed her obvious distress to Viki, and told the other women they needed to focus on becoming beautiful for Nora and Bo's big day.  Viki was delighted to be Nora's maid of honor in Rachel's stead, and equally thrilled that Bo and Nora were back together, along with Brody and Jessica, and John and Natalie.\n\n\nNoticing Jessica's eye still drawn to the paper, Viki tossed it aside.  Her interest piqued, Natalie told her mother she'd heard Ford was a \"dog,\" and asked Jessica if he'd attempted to hit on her when she'd visited Cristian and Layla's apartment.  Jessica deflected the question, and Natalie and Viki realized that Ford had indeed put the moves on Jessica while she suffered from brain damage.  Jessica said it was no big deal, but Natalie was disgusted, and Viki reminded Jess that Ford could've taken advantage of her in her altered state.\n\n\nBefore the conversation could go further, Roxy arrived, bearing an arsenal of liquor for the ladies on the big day and promising mixed drinks to go with their makeovers.  As they waited on Nora, Roxy recounted for Viki and Jessica the story of Natalie's letter to John, and their surprise reunion at the airport.  Viki was thankful for Roxy's romantic advice and her version of the story, as Natalie had been tight-lipped.  Natalie listened with trepidation as Roxy explained to the others that there was a stretch of time between Natalie's binge at Rodi's and her arrival at the airport that she hadn't shared with anyone.\n\n\nNatalie insisted there was nothing left to tell about that fateful evening, and Viki added that Jessica had also been vague on the details of how she'd regained her memory.  Anxious, Jessica said they needed to simply be grateful for what they had, and look forward to Bo and Nora's wedding.  Viki and Natalie agreed, sure that nothing but good times were ahead.  Right on cue, Nora, accompanied by Destiny, hobbled into the Hair Haven on crutches with an eyepatch on her injured eye and a snaggle-toothed smile.  As the other ladies looked on in shock, Roxy voiced the group sentiment: \"Oh, my God!\"\n\n\nAs Destiny helped Nora into the salon, Nora explained that they'd stopped by the hospital so Greg could examine her ankle and her eye; she had a burnt cornea and a wounded leg, along with her chipped tooth.  \"Thith ith a total dithasther!\" she lisped, despondent.  The ladies flocked to Nora, and promised that her wedding day could be saved. Roxy told Nora to prepare for a brilliant hair color job, which would make her red mane shine at the altar.  Wishing Nora luck, Destiny left to meet up with Darren.\n\n\nAfter her coloring job, Nora settled into a comfortable chair, and relaxed with a shower cap on her head and an ice pack on her leg while the color took hold.  She agreed with Viki, Natalie, and the others, who assured her that she'd be fine after all.  \"What else could go wrong?\" Nora reasoned with a desperate laugh.\n\n\nTaking in Nora's eyepatch and gap-toothed mouth with as much stride as she could muster, Gigi arrived and greeted the ladies.  She told Roxy she needed the works as well for the wedding, and Roxy asked her if she was getting dolled up for Rex's benefit.\n\n\nAs Roxy turned her trained eye onto Jessica, promising her a \"Lady Gaga\"-style hairdo, Jess took the opportunity to flee; she had to find a dentist who made house calls to fix Nora's teeth.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, Danielle greeted Nate, who was intrigued by the Sun headline about Markko and Ford.  Danielle told him that T\u00e9a would help Markko, just as she'd helped Todd evade justice for a crime he'd likely committed; the difference was Markko was surely innocent.  Nate wasn't convinced, however, and told Danielle that everyone did \"wild stuff\" if they couldn't have the people they loved.\n\n\nShifting the subject to the school play, Nate asked if she thought it would go forward.  Danielle doubted it, as two of the principal characters were in jail in real life on attempted murder charges.  Nate said it wasn't fair, and lamented not being able to play Cole opposite Danielle's Starr onstage - he particularly would miss the kissing scenes.  Danielle attempted to turn her attention to her homework, but Nate asked her to go to the Llantano Mountain quarry with him to go swimming.\n\n\nDanielle requested a rain check; Nate jeered at her, and asked if she was scared to be alone with him.  Danielle said she had a date with Matthew, at his parents' wedding.  Fishing for information, Nate asked if that meant she and Matthew were in a good place in their relationship.  Danielle mumbled that Matthew had told her he loved her, and Nate asked if she'd said it back, then, insisting it was none of his business, retracted his question.  He decided to leave and told her to have a good time at the wedding, but teased her that whatever she did, she should avoid catching the bouquet.\n\n\nAlone again, Danielle struggled to focus on her homework, only to be surprised when Nate suddenly returned to her side.  He told her that the status of her and Matthew's relationship was his business, after all, and that he didn't want to complicate her life, \"but...\"  Trailing off, he kissed her.  Just outside, Destiny passed the restaurant.  Glancing in the window, she was stunned to see Nate and Danielle's liplock.\n\n\nAt St. James' Church, Bo and Matthew arrived in search of the wedding singer.  What they found was a wrecked main hall, with Nora's favorite flowers strewn everywhere, and an ungodly stench permeating the building.  The singer rushed over to them, and informed them that a skunk had entered the building overnight while all the priests were on a retreat; furthermore, Andrew was in Savannah with Cassie and River, and had yet to call in confirming his arrival.  The singer explained that Animal Control was ransacking the church in search of the errant skunk, but Bo refused to change the venue at such a late date, and was determined to air the church out.\n\n\nMatthew made a sweep of the building and returned with an ultra-strength deodorizer, which he began spraying in the air to clear away the smell.  As he began to spray, however, the wedding singer gasped; she was allergic to the deodorizer, and her throat promptly closed up, preventing her from speaking, let alone singing.  Bo reluctantly sent the woman home, while Matthew asked him what they would do to salvage the big day.  \"Son, it's gonna be okay,\" Bo declared.\n\n\nIn short order, John, Brody, and Rex assembled in the church vestibule with Matthew, after Bo had called them there. All of them were holding their noses and gasping for breath amidst the foul stench.  \"Men, we have a situation,\" Bo announced, addressing them like a military unit, and told them he needed their help, though the odds were against them.  Through a rousing, inspirational speech, he explained that they had to prevail against impossible difficulties \"for honor, for glory, for family, for love, and for Nora!\"  He laid out their tasks: Brody was to meet his underground \"flower connection\" on the docks, John was to find a new singer for the wedding, Matthew would head for the supermarket to buy as much deodorizer as possible, and Rex would head for the airport to pick up Andrew.  \"Godspeed,\" Bo intoned, as thunder from the coming storm roared overhead.\n\n\nAs Bo watched Animal Control hunt for the skunk in the main hall, Rex stopped him to ask when exactly their rendezvous time, \"thirteen hundred,\" was.  Exasperated, Bo explained the concept of military time to his young friend, then entered the main hall, only to be immediately sprayed by the marauding skunk.\n\n\nBack at Foxy Roxy's, Roxy examined her supplies with concern as she realized the bottles for Nora's hair coloring and the floor cleaner were identical.  Nora asked her if anything was wrong.  \"Nothing, now that you're done,\" Roxy mumbled, and gathered the women around to unveil Nora's exciting new look.  \"Here's Red!\" she declared, whipping Nora's shower cap off.\n\n\nRoxy, Viki, Natalie, and Gigi stared at Nora with horror.  Roxy had inadvertently colored Nora's hair with the floor cleaner solution, which left the betrothed woman's tresses an unflattering shade of neon green.  \"What?\" the one-eyed, one-legged, gap-toothed bride exclaimed fearfully. \"What?\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Nora wake up and relish what a perfect day it will be because it is their wedding day. Then the lights go out. Nora checks online and finds that a storm will arrive today. Nora burns her cornea when she puts her contact lens in after cleaning it with facial defoliant. She chips her tooth on a bagel. She falls and sprains her ankle. When she goes to Roxy's to have her hair done, it comes out green. Meanwhile, a skunk is trapped in the church with Animal Control trying to catch it. The deodorizer causes the singer to lose her voice. Bo rallies Rex, John, Brody, and Matthew to help him get everything together to salvage the wedding. Then the skunk sprays Bo. Destiny advises Matthew to talk to Dani about his telling her he loves her right away, but he doesn't get around to it. Nate asks Dani out, but she tells him that she has a date with Matthew, that they are good, and that he said he loves her. Nate kisses her. Destiny is walking past the Buenos Dias and sees them. Rex and Gigi return from their trip and inform Shane that his grandmother was Hopi Indian but that she is dead now. He explains that she gave Rex up because she thought Rex's father was dead. Viki is pleased that both of her daughters have reunited with their men. Roxy says the only thing that could be better is if Rex and Gigi get back together. Brody calls Natalie and tells her he thinks they should keep quiet about sleeping together. Brody slips and mentions seeing Natalie the night John missed her at the airport. He says Natalie stopped by to say goodbye. John thanks him for being a friend to Natalie.",
