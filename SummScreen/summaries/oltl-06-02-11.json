She explained that it was therapeutic to write an article for the Sun about Marty attacking her. Changing the subject, Joey revealed that he'd told Aubrey that he knew all about her schemes. He continued that Aubrey had begged him for a clean slate, but all Joey wanted was another chance with Kelly. Kelly admitted that Joey's apology had been huge to her, but she needed time to figure things out. He promised to give her all the time she needed.\n\n\nKelly asked if Joey had thrown Aubrey out. Joey related that he'd wanted to, but Aubrey had reminded him that they would lose custody of Ryder if they weren't married. He assured Kelly that the marriage was \"in name only.\" He added that it wasn't a marriage if he and Aubrey slept in different rooms at Llanfair. Kelly was confused, so Joey explained the deal Cutter had made with Clint. Despite losing the house, Joey was happy that Jessica was getting the help she needed. Jessica would soon return to get Ryder back, and then Joey would be free of Aubrey. He added that he would \"be yours, if you'll have me.\"\n\n\nJoey confessed that he had been scared to have another chance with Kelly, because he hadn't wanted to mess things up. However, he'd felt real fear, seeing Kelly in the emergency room. He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. Kelly confided that she'd been waiting to hear him say that. At her hesitation to say anything else, Joey asked if she was thinking about John. Kelly told Joey that she didn't want to be his rebound. Joey apologized again, and promised to make her believe in him. He kissed her, and stated that he wouldn't give up until they were back together.\n\n\nFord stormed into the diner and marched over to Aubrey. He yelled that she wasn't allowed to change Ryder's address without telling him. Aubrey claimed that they'd moved to Llanfair in order to be closer to Viki. Ford said that Tess had told him everything about Aubrey. He was convinced that, when Joey found out, Joey would kick Aubrey out, and Ford would get Ryder back. However, Aubrey informed him that Joey already knew everything, but didn't care, because he and Aubrey were in love.\n\n\nFord thought that Joey was dumb, but recognized that the marriage was still a fraud. He knew the judge would reconsider the custody decision with the new information. When he got up to leave, Aubrey stopped him. She pleaded that, if she didn't have Ryder, she would lose Joey. Ford refused to sacrifice his son for Aubrey's selfishness. Aubrey promised to make a deal with Ford for regular visitation rights. Ford wanted to start right then, but Aubrey needed to talk to Joey first.\n\n\nFord was convinced that Joey would say no, so he took out his phone. He got a hold of his lawyer, and told the lawyer to petition the court. However, Aubrey decided to let Ford take Ryder, so Ford told his lawyer to hold off. He took Ryder, and left. Aubrey wondered what she would tell Joey, who entered a short while later. Noticing that Ryder was gone, Joey demanded to know where he was.\n\n\nIn Angel Square, Ford was happy to be with his son. He promised Ryder that he would figure out a way that they could be together all the time.\n\n\nShaun arrived at Todd's, calling for Todd and Tomas. When no one answered him, he wondered where everyone was.\n\n\nSneaking past Shaun, Tomas walked out of the house with a gun. Todd asked what had happened between Tomas and Marty. Tomas had made sure that Marty wouldn't leave, and would keep the information on the disc to herself. Tomas was concerned that Liam wasn't with his mother, but Todd didn't \"have time to babysit.\" Todd reminded Tomas that, if the information got out, both of their lives would be over.\n\n\nBlair entered the diner, and was surprised to see Claude. She remarked that he looked better than Tomas had made him sound the previous night. Going along with it, Claude claimed that his problem the night before hadn't been as serious as he'd thought. He apologized for taking Tomas away from Blair. Blair wondered if it had been on purpose, but Claude was happy that Blair made Tomas happy. They shook hands, as friends. \"As a friend,\" Blair started, \"why is there a CIA file on Tomas?\"\n\n\nClaude acted surprised. Blair wondered how Claude didn't know about the file, since he was such a good friend of Tomas. She said that Tomas had only told her to trust him. Realizing her order was ready, Blair said goodbye to Claude. As soon as Blair left, Claude took out his phone.\n\n\nTodd told Tomas that, if the police got a search warrant, he and Tomas would be in trouble. Tomas' phone rang, and he answered it to Claude. He promised to call Claude back later, and hung up. Todd thought that it was his turn to deal with Marty, so Tomas gave him the gun.\n\n\nTomas went back into the house and called Claude back. Claude updated Tomas on Claude's encounter with Blair. Claude warned Tomas that \"some secrets can't stay buried.\" Just then, Blair entered the house. Tomas lied that he had been trying to call her to apologize for the night before. Blair thought it had been a blessing in disguise for keeping her from making a mistake.\n\n\nTomas thought that Blair trusted him. She did, but wanted to slow things down between them. She wanted them to get to know each other better, because she wanted the relationship to work. She realized that it would also take time for him to trust her.\n\n\nNoticing the headline on the newspaper, \"Psycho Psych Still on the Lam,\" Blair expressed her sorrow for Natalie. She admitted that both she and Todd had a \"hate/hate relationship\" with Marty. She had briefly gotten along with Marty after Starr had given birth to a baby with \"Marty's son, Cole Thornhart.\" Tomas was taken aback to hear the surname. Blair explained about Patrick Thornhart's death, and speculated that Marty hadn't been the same since Patrick had died.\n\n\nTomas apologized for being rude, but he had to get to a meeting with Claude. He wondered if she would be free later. Realizing she'd left her planner at the diner, she said she'd let him know. She kissed him and left. Tomas immediately called Claude, and asked if Claude remembered Patrick Thornhart. Tomas related that he was going to have to \"call in a favor.\"\n\n\nIn the pool house, Marty told Liam that no one would find out that Marty had been the one to change Liam's DNA test. She thought that John would be so happy to have a son that he would want to start a family with Marty and Liam. The three of them would live \"happily ever after.\"\n\n\nAs Marty sang to Liam, Todd entered. Todd told her that Liam needed his mother. Marty thought she was a good mother, and reminded Todd that he had once wanted to raise a baby with her. Todd acknowledged his past wrongs. Marty said the difference was that Starr was alive, but Natalie was dead. Todd informed a livid Marty that Natalie had survived the accident. As she got upset, Todd assured her that Natalie didn't remember much.\n\n\nMarty wanted proof of Natalie's survival. Todd promised to get a newspaper to show her the article about Natalie. Todd offered to take the baby off Marty's hands. Marty pulled her gun on Todd, and told him that she would keep the baby. Todd left, and Marty hoped that Natalie really was dead. \"If not,\" she said, \"I'll make it the truth.\"\n\n\nClaude arrived at Todd's, and handed a file to Tomas. Todd entered, so an uncomfortable Claude left. Todd told Tomas that Marty was \"losing it,\" so they needed to make her leave. Tomas had thought up a plan to reunite Marty with her husband. Todd had thought that Tomas didn't want to kill Marty. Tomas informed a confused Todd that Patrick was alive.\n\n\nNatalie was asleep in her hospital room. She had a dream that she was on the roof with Marty, and the recorder. She saw herself being pushed off of the roof. She woke up, and knew that she needed to find the tape.\n\n\nOn the phone, John told Brody that he'd gotten a false lead on Marty. He had to get back to the police station, but he asked Brody to let Natalie know what was going on. Brody entered Natalie's hospital room, and she immediately asked for news. Although Brody had none, Natalie believed that Madame Delphina had been right when the psychic had said that Liam was all right.\n\n\nNatalie told Brody about her dream, and wondered what it had meant. Natalie believed that she had listened to the tape. Natalie thought that, if the recorder weren't on the roof, Marty probably had it. Brody told her that he and John hadn't found any sign of Marty at Todd's. Natalie tried to get out of bed so she could question Todd herself, but Brody wouldn't let her.\n\n\nRoxy walked up to John and asked about Liam. She babbled on to a surprised John about how the last thing Natalie remembered was kissing Brody. Realizing what she'd said, Roxy claimed that it was only something that Madame Delphina had thought up. Roxy assured John that, although Brody was Liam's father, Natalie loved John. John had to get back to work, so he left.\n\n\nRoxy chided herself for mentioning the kiss, and thought it would be a miracle if John and Natalie ever got back together. Roxy caught sight of a heads-up penny on the sidewalk. Underneath the bench, she found the recorder. As she was about to press play, Brody called, and told her that he needed Roxy's help.\n\n\nA short while later, Roxy arrived at the hospital. Brody promised to be back soon, and left. Roxy thought that Natalie could use some music, so she took out the recorder. However, Natalie wasn't in the mood for music. She wanted food that wasn't \"soup or green gelatin.\" Roxy didn't want to leave Natalie alone, but Natalie assured her that Brody had just been overprotective. Roxy left, and Natalie attempted to stand up.\n\n\nA short while later, Brody saw Roxy in the hallway with a tray of food. Frustrated with Roxy, Brody went into Natalie's hospital room and found it empty.\n\n\nWith the help of a crutch, Natalie managed to stagger all the way to Todd's house.\n\n\nShaun arrived at the diner and found John. Shaun informed John that Todd had him searching the streets for the shooter. John asked Shaun to keep an eye out for signs of Marty. Shaun still thought Tomas was strange. He still believed that Tomas had been the one to drop the syringe.\n\n\nBlair arrived at the diner and found her planner. She saw John, who immediately asked her about Todd and Tomas. Blair defended Tomas, but John wanted an example of Tomas' apparent good character. Blair informed John that Tomas didn't know Natalie, but had asked a lot of questions about Natalie's situation, and about Marty and Patrick. John found it interesting that Tomas had wanted to know about Patrick.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face repeated over and over again that his name was Todd, and that he had a daughter named Starr, a wife named Blair, and another wife named T\u00e9a. He also remembered that he had raped a woman named Marty. The agent entered with the guard, and told the guard to \"take him downstairs and get rid of him.\"\n\n\nThe agent left, and the guard took the restraints off of the man. He attempted to drag the man out, but the man claimed to remember what the agent wanted from him, and who he had given it to. The guard demanded to know if it was John McBain, but the man head-butted the guard. The guard fell to the floor, unconscious.\n\n\nA short while later, the man had switched clothes with the guard. He dragged the guard over to the palm scanner so he could leave the room. Through a set of double doors, he saw two other guards. He pulled his gun and pointed it at the door as the door opened. However, the agent stopped the guard who was opening the door, and told the guard that he needed help elsewhere. The man walked cautiously through the hallway. He stopped when he heard the agent's voice in another room say, \"You're getting out of here, Thornhart.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John, Brody, and Shaun all know that Todd Manning and Tomas Delgado have some sort of secret regarding why Todd first believed Tom\u00e1s tried to kill him, which they also believe, and then Todd suddenly invites Tomas to live in his home. Todd and Tomas hide Marty and baby Liam knowing that if they don't, she can expose their secret. Tomas reveals to Todd that Patrick Thornhart, Marty's \"believed\" deceased husband, is alive. Natalie then struggles to get out of her hospital bed although she can barely walk. Joey is done with Aubrey reluctantly agreeing to stay married to her only in the interest of baby Ryder so he does not get put in foster care. And he assures Kelly that as soon as Jessica gets better and gets her baby back, he will be done with Aubrey and ready to devote his life to Kelly. Aubrey runs into Robert Ford who is not going to let her raise his child when he knows that her marriage is a fraud. But she tells him if he refrains from making trouble for her, she will let him see baby Ryder without Joey or anyone knowing. Original Todd regains his memory when guards are ready to kill him when they find that out. He knocks out a guard and escapes unseen. Patrick Thornhart is a \"neighbor\" of his in the same institution.",
