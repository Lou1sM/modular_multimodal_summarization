    "soap_central": "\nAre You The Gatekeeper?\n\n\n \nKyle returned home to the Angel Square Hotel, only to be accosted by Schuyler, who slammed him against the front desk and demanded he return the bag of blood Schuyler was sure Kyle had stolen from his room. As Kyle protested his innocence and struggled to break free from Schuyler's grip, Officer Fish arrived on the scene and pulled his gun, warning Schuyler to back off. \n\n\nSchuyler let Kyle go and attempted to explain himself, but before Schuyler could tell Fish the whole sordid story about Stacy, Kyle butted in, saying he was willing to forget the whole incident if Schuyler apologized. Schuyler told Kyle he'd find proof of what Kyle was up to, and exited. \n\n\nKyle told Fish that Schuyler was crazy, but Fish wasn't so sure, and cited his old friend's recent criminal history. Kyle was upset that his former frat buddy, \"Oliver,\" would think the worst of him, but Fish told him not to call him that, reminding him that they no longer had a personal relationship. With that, Fish left. \n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Rex gave up his bed for the evening so the wounded Stacy could recover from her \"encounter\" with Stan in comfort. After taking stock of Stacy's favorite foods, Rex headed off to the supermarket to spoil her in style. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Marcie arrived at the bar and gave Gigi the exciting news that Hope was alive. Gigi was overjoyed, until Marcie explained that Jessica had taken off with the baby. Gigi impulsively suggested they call Rex to help Marcie track Hope down, which gave Marcie an opening to needle her friend about her break-up. Gigi said that she was entirely to blame for what had happened with Rex, but Marcie was unconvinced, and urged Gigi and Rex to work out their issues. She said that with Hope back, she knew anything was possible. \n\n\nGigi decided to call Rex at the loft about Marcie, but only got his voicemail. After Stacy listened to Gigi's message, she immediately erased it. \n\n\nSchuyler arrived at Rodi's and asked to speak to Gigi privately, prompting Marcie to head for a table to wait for Michael. Alone, Schuyler told Gigi that he'd confronted Kyle, but learned nothing, leaving them without any evidence of Stacy's misdeeds. Gigi was unwilling to give up, and said they had to find another DNA sample from Stacy to test against Shane as quickly as possible. She reminded Schuyler that she still had a key to the loft, and said that since no one was apparently home, they could go that night, retrieve something of Stacy's, and test her DNA against Shane's. \n\n\nKyle called Stacy at the loft, warning her that Schuyler and her sister were hot on their trail. Stacy was put out that her ex would be pursuing her secret, and claimed she'd never done anything to him. She told Kyle that Gigi and Schuyler had no evidence, and thanked him for disposing of the blood sample that had been in Schuyler's apartment. Kyle told Stacy he hadn't stolen the blood, which left Stacy befuddled and wondering who had taken her bone marrow. \n\n\nAs Rex returned with her favorite foods, Stacy quickly ended her call. She thanked Rex for his endless hospitality, and Rex headed for Shane's room to turn in for the night. Dejected, Stacy murmured to herself that all she really wanted was Rex. \n\n\nUndaunted, Stacy took to Rex's bed and began feigning a nightmare about Stan, crying out into the night. Roused from sleep, Rex rushed out of Shane's room in his boxers and hurried to Stacy's bedside, holding her and comforting her as Stacy played for sympathy. \n\n\nGigi and Schuyler approached the loft, and Gigi used her key to unlock the door. The duo entered the loft ready to gather evidence, only to come face-to-face with Rex and Stacy in bed together, as Stacy fixed her sister with a sinister smile. \n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Michael arrived and gave Marcie the good news -- the police had found Jessica and Hope in West Virginia. Michael told his wife that they needed to start thinking about taking Hope home and starting their long-awaited family. Marcie was excited, but couldn't help fearing for Jessica, who she knew was going through the same agony she had when she'd lost Tommy. \n\n\nIn West Virginia, Clint and Natalie huddled under the porch of the Brennans' house, taking shelter from the rainstorm. As they awaited news from Viki and Bo, Clint grew frustrated by his feelings of helplessness. Natalie attempted to bolster his spirits, but found herself reflecting on how she'd always tried to care for Roxy the same way, then the Buchanan family, and finally Jessica. Natalie blamed herself for Jessica's breakdown, and said that by trying to be her sister's keeper and playing God with Starr and Marcie's lives, she'd only caused Jessica to lose her child. \n\n\nClint told Natalie she wasn't to blame, and claimed that he bore the guilt by not seeing the signs that Jessica wasn't integrated. Clint said that Natalie had taken on an impossible decision and had needed to make a gutsy judgment call for the family just as Asa would have. He told her he was proud of her for standing by her sister. Embracing his daughter, Clint told Natalie she was still good at taking care of people, him included. Natalie asked Clint if Jessica would pull through her ordeal all right, and Clint said he wished he knew. \n\n\nInside the Brennans' house, Charlie stopped Brody from rushing up the staircase to confront Bess. He told Brody that Viki knew Jessica better than anyone. Brody feared what would become of Jessica when she learned the truth about Chloe, and Charlie told him that they had to have faith in Viki and Jessica. \n\n\nUpstairs, Viki, posing as \"Jean Randolph,\" called to Bess from behind the closed bedroom door. Bess opened the door and allowed \"Jean\" to enter the bedroom, and Jean told her that they had things to discuss. \n\n\nSurveying the room, Jean coolly told Bess that she had arrived to help Bess resolve their situation. Noticing the sleeping Chloe, Jean reminded Bess that they were \"gatekeeper\" alters, whose purpose was to protect the host personality, not their offspring. Bess said that Jessica needed Chloe, which meant her duties entailed caring for the baby. Jean called children messy and inefficient. \"The job is the job,\" Bess replied, but Jean said that wasn't necessarily true, and reminded her that other people were prepared to step in and care for Chloe. \n\n\nBess said that Jessica was Chloe's only mother, and reiterated that Jessica could not handle the truth. Jean chided Bess for her \"faulty logic,\" reminding her that all host personalities had to eventually find the strength to face their dark secrets without their alters' help, just as \"Victoria\" had regarding Victor Lord. \"Only because you failed,\" Bess replied. She said that Jean had been unable to maintain control, and hadn't achieved her purpose. \n\n\nJean told Bess that she'd also failed, and that her secret was out. \"Admitting defeat negates my purpose,\" Bess muttered, but Jean said it was time for her to relinquish control to Jessica. Growing emotional, Viki let her mask slip as she told Bess that the pain of the host's secrets never went away, but became manageable. \n\n\nTurning on Viki, Bess called her out, reminding her that Jessica would be committed again, and would have another loved one torn from her grasp just like Nash. She said she'd known it was Viki, and Viki took off her glasses, giving up her ruse. Viki told the increasingly panicked Bess that she'd let Viki in, anyway, because she knew there was no way out. She said that Bess had fulfilled her purpose, and it was time to let Jessica come out and deal with the truth. \n\n\nGrabbing Bess by the shoulders, Viki struggled to break through to Jessica, calling out to her daughter and asking her to come forward. As she reached for Bess's glasses, the young woman shrank away, crying \"Don't!\" but when Viki reached again, Bess grew lethargic, letting Viki pull the glasses from her face. Viki began to coax her daughter back to reality, moving her over to the bed. Bess and Jessica seemed lost in a mental fog. As Viki undid the knot of Bess's hair, she told Jessica that it was time for her to put her burden down and remember what had happened. \n\n\nFinally showing signs of life, Jessica blinked and began to quietly weep, asking Viki what she was supposed to remember. Viki told her that her heart already knew the truth, and told her to tell her the whole story. \"You only have to say it once,\" Viki said. \"Once is too much!\" Jessica cried, growing hysterical. \n\n\nClutching Jess, Viki said she'd help her daughter, and began to retell the tale of how Jessica had gone to the cottage as Tess to give birth. She told Jessica that it was her, not Tess, that Tess was only a facet of her self. As Viki narrated, Jessica experienced phantom labor pains, and began to reenact giving birth as it had happened, hallucinating Niki and speaking to her, then seeing her daughter for the first time, only to realize the baby wasn't crying. \n\n\n\"Why isn't she crying?\" the delirious Jessica asked. \"You know why,\" Viki murmured, and told her to say it out loud, just once. \"My baby's dead!\" Jessica screamed. \"Oh, God, my baby's dead!\" Hysterical, she fell into Viki's arms.\n\n\n",
