Neither of them was aware of Destiny, who stood outside in the rain and peered through the window. \"Oh no, she didn't,\" Destiny said out loud. She asked no one in particular why she always had to be the one to see something awful that affected others.\n\n\nSuddenly, Matthew arrived and announced he wanted to go inside for some industrial-strength air freshener. He thought that Carlotta would have what he needed. Destiny grabbed him, turned him away from the window, and insisted that he stay outside with her. She explained that he would be wasting his time and she was sure he wouldn't find the right product. She thought that he might find it elsewhere and directed him to a store some distance from where they were. Each time that Matthew tried to head inside to get out of the rain, Destiny held him back. Confused, Matthew finally agreed to shop where Destiny had directed him to go. Destiny turned her attention back to the window.\n\n\nInside, Nate told Dani that while he probably should apologize, he wasn't sorry. He liked her and thought about her all of the time. He also thought that she felt the same about him. Unexpectedly, Destiny walked in between the two of them to scold Dani for her inappropriate behavior. Destiny was confidant that Dani had feelings for Matthew when she wasn't busy putting her tongue down someone else's throat, she shouted.\n\n\nDani couldn't believe that Destiny had seen the kiss, and Destiny informed her that Matthew had almost witnessed it as well. Panic began to arise in Dani, though Destiny noted that she had sent Matthew on his way. Destiny accused Dani of \"playing\" Matthew, and she thought the girl should be ashamed of herself for leading him on. Dani tried to explain that it \"just happened.\" Destiny assumed that it wouldn't happen again, but Dani was unable to respond. Destiny ordered Dani to tell Matthew or she would.\n\n\nNate told Destiny to \"back off,\" but an angry Destiny shushed him up. She was in no mood to hear what Nate had to say. She wanted to protect Matthew because she cared about him. Nate wanted Dani to ignore Destiny, but Dani agreed that Destiny was right. Nate felt bad and blamed the incident on himself, but Dani reminded him that she had kissed him back and he wasn't to blame.\n\n\nKelly apologized to a surprisingly calm Blair because she had ransacked Blair's closet. Kelly needed a dress and didn't have anything of her own while Blair had fabulous clothes. Blair brushed off Kelly's stream of compliments until she heard that the dress was for Bo and Nora's wedding. Blair fumed that she hadn't been invited to the wedding, though Kelly pointed out several reasons why Blair didn't have an invitation. Kelly was sure that Blair's invite had been lost in the mail, or perhaps it was because Blair wasn't particularly fond of Marty, who was sure to be there.\n\n\nKelly also recalled that Blair had less-than-desirable behavior at Nora's previous wedding to Clint and, for that reason, Nora didn't want Blair to attend. As Blair grew angrier by the second, the doorbell rang. Blair changed her mind about Kelly's use of the dress and tried to pull it out of Kelly's hands. Kelly pulled the bag and suddenly the dress ripped in half. As the women argued, John walked into La Boulaie.\n\n\nNoting that he had pushed the doorbell several times, the ladies ignored John as Blair demanded that Kelly pay her two thousand dollars for the dress. After a brief but heated argument over the cost of the dress, Kelly turned her attention to John. She assumed he was there about her mother's case, but he revealed that he wanted to see Blair. He was there on behalf of Nora, who needed Blair's help, he explained. It was an emergency and Nora needed a singer to replace the one she had originally hired. Blair claimed ignorance about the wedding and awkwardly, John stated that he assumed she had been invited. He told her what a beautiful voice she had, but Blair snapped that she didn't play \"second fiddle\" for anyone. \"Tell her to shove it,\" Blair added.\n\n\nKelly reminded her cousin of the less-than-stellar behavior that Blair and Dorian had shown at Nora's last wedding. Blair blamed it on the \"certain someone\" who had just broken up with her to go out with Marty. John quietly announced that he had just broken up with Marty. \"You did?\" Blair asked, sounding amazed. Blair admitted that she felt a little better, but she still refused to sing for Bo and Nora. All of a sudden, Kelly piped up and offered to sing if Blair wouldn't.\n\n\nBlair panned Kelly's voice, but Kelly insisted that she could sing even better than Blair. John handed her a set list, but Blair tore it from Kelly's hand. Blair didn't want the family name harmed, and she thought she'd better sing after all. Kelly and John exchanged knowing glances and smiles. Their reverse psychology had worked. Blair promised to do her best, but she wanted an apology from Nora for the lack of an invitation. John offered to fill in instead. \"I apologize,\" he said sincerely, as he looked into Blair's eyes. She backed down and accepted but gave him a list of demands that included plenty of tea, honey, and little chocolates with the green-coated ones removed.\n\n\n\"You're good,\" Kelly advised John as she walked him to the door. He thanked her for her help with the trick and acknowledged that he was still working on her mother's case. She would be the first to know if he learned of anything new. Kelly replied that she had faith in John's ability to track down the killer and she thanked him for all he had done too. After John left, Kelly returned to the ripped dress. Someone spied on her through the window.\n\n\n\"Commissioner down,\" Rex yelled after the skunk sprayed Bo at the church. Rex suggested that Bo consider postponing the wedding, but Bo shouted that it wasn't an option. He had promised Nora they would be married on their original wedding date. The skunk continued to scramble around the church, sprayed again, and finally settled into the tuxedo Bo had dropped when he ran from the skunk's stench. After a short time, the Animal Control workers announced that they had captured the animal, but not before Bo's tuxedo was ruined. Bo pondered the idea of calling off the wedding after all.\n\n\nIt was Rex's turn to nix that idea, but he thought that Bo would need to do something about his awful smell. Bo decreed that he would marry Nora if she crawled out of a landfill. \"Gross,\" Rex responded. He accused Bo of not being a Buchanan because his actions didn't resemble those of the family. He suggested Bo might be a Lawrence, Cramer, or Balsom instead. Bo admitted he would be proud to be a Balsom, but he really was a Buchanan.\n\n\nRex had a plan to rid Bo of the odor and showed him to a bathtub on church property. He submerged Bo in tomato sauce obtained from the pizza shop and swore it would help, since he had been through a similar incident long before when hiking with Gigi.\n\n\nThe women at Foxy Roxy's were horrified after Roxy removed Nora's cap to reveal bright green hair. Gigi had no choice but to hand Nora a mirror after Nora looked at her friend's faces. Nora screamed in agony, \"Roxy, what have you done to me?\" As Roxy rushed to help, she knocked a heated styling tool onto Nora's wedding dress. Nora was sure that Bo would \"run for the hills\" when he saw her, though Roxy thought that things could have been worse.\n\n\nNora jumped up and went after Roxy with her crutch. Roxy tried to calm Nora down and told her she was certain that people would be looking at Nora's dress and not her hair. The others agreed, but suddenly they detected an odor. Nora's wedding dress was on fire, and Natalie rushed to grab a fire extinguisher. She managed to put the flames out, but the dress was charred. Nora began to sob and declared that she wanted to cancel the wedding.\n\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Viki replied. She took the bull by the horns and assigned a job to everyone. She determined that she and Gigi would attempt to find a new dress for Nora to wear. She handed Natalie a slip of paper with the name of someone to contact regarding Nora's tooth because it appeared that Jessica hadn't had much luck. As Roxy tried to slip out to Rodi's, Viki threatened her and ordered her to fix Nora's hair. Roxy had one hour in which to complete the job.\n\n\nOnce again, Roxy tried to leave, but Natalie prevented her from doing so. She berated Roxy and even slapped her, though Nora swore she wouldn't allow Roxy to touch her hair again. Natalie tried a different tack and praised Roxy. She cited the fact that Roxy was great and it was just one mishap. When Roxy didn't share Natalie's confidence, Natalie slapped her again. \"Who are you?\" Natalie shouted. \"Foxy Roxy,\" Roxy shouted back.\n\n\nBo and Nora spoke on the phone, and each assured the other they were fine. \"Do you...?\" they both began but stopped. Bo finally asked Nora if she wanted to postpone the wedding, but she didn't and neither did he. They each expressed disappointment over the rain as the thunder rumbled loudly and the lightning flashed brightly.\n\n\nRoxy looked through her hair books and decided on an obscure course of action to correct what she had done. As music played, she and Natalie, outfitted with goggles, played mad scientists and brewed some unknown potions. Roxy worked on Nora's hair and commented, \"I did my best...in the hands of the hair gods.\"\n\n\n\"Ding,\" the timer sounded. \"It's time,\" Roxy announced as she walked towards Nora to remove the cap.\n\n\nGigi and Viki rummaged through scores of unpacked boxes at Nora's place. They were disappointed that they hadn't been able to get into Logan's Department Store due to a power outage there as a result of the storm. They were determined to go through all of the clothing that Nora had packed away, but they had little success. Suddenly, Gigi shrieked with glee. She held another wedding dress in her hand. Viki quickly rejected the dress as she explained it was the dress Nora had worn when she married Clint.\n\n\nGigi replaced the dress and talked about her recent trip with Rex. Viki perked up and demanded to hear all about it. Gigi assured her it was a long story, but Viki wanted to know if Gigi and Rex had gotten back together. Gigi told her all about the trip and Viki teased that it must have been a great feeling to be so close to Rex. She was sure that Gigi wanted to do it again, though without the jail part. Gigi admitted they had shared a \"moment or two\" and had almost kissed. She was sure that Rex was over her though. Viki thought that both Rex and Gigi had to share their true feelings with each other. During the discussion, Gigi had continued to hunt for something that Nora could wear. She suddenly shrieked that she had found the perfect item. Viki looked at it and agreed.\n\n\nAs Rex poured his concoction over Bo, he mentioned his trip to New Mexico. Bo wanted to hear about it, though Rex told him it was a long story. Bo had time so Rex revealed the details. He added that \"all roads led back\" to Llanview and so he wanted to concentrate on his life there. Bo thought it must have been like old times for Rex to be with Gigi and asked if Rex still loved Gigi and wanted her back. Rex began to pour the sauce over Bo's head and stated that he thought Gigi was over him. He did love her, and he wanted her back.\n\n\nBo wanted Rex to take action and advised Rex that he shouldn't waste time like Bo and Nora did. He didn't want Rex to wait on expressing his feelings. They were surprised when David Vickers Buchanan walked through the door. David thought it was Bo who needed to have the happy ending.\n\n\nMatthew arrived at the church with a bagful of air deodorizers and began to spray with a can in each hand. He was pleasantly interrupted when Dani arrived early, and he asked her what she smelled. She described the air freshener and the skunk smell. As he continued to spray, she advised him that she wanted to talk to him. \n\n\n",
