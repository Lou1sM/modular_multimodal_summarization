Joey then yelled that he would need to find Ryder, before Ford took Ryder away.  Aubrey insisted that she had been given no choice but to hand Ryder to Ford.  Aubrey explained that Ford had found out that Joey and Aubrey were not the perfect couple, and she feared that Ford would inform the judge.  However, Aubrey believed that Bobby had just missed his son, and that he would return him.\n\n\nJoey suspected that Aubrey only wanted to retain custody of Ryder to hang on to Joey, and to force Joey to stay married to her.  However, Aubrey insisted that she just wanted to show Joey that she loved him.  Joey remarked that Aubrey had shown him how much she loved him by sleeping with Cutter behind his back.  Joey wondered how he would ever be able to trust Aubrey again.\n\n\nJoey pleaded with Aubrey to just give it up, because he wanted to be with Kelly, once Jessica returned to take care of Ryder.  When Joey claimed that Kelly knew how much she meant to Joey, Aubrey asked why Joey was not with Kelly.  Aubrey guessed, \"Because Kelly didn't welcome you back with open arms, did she?\"  Aubrey realized that Kelly knew that she was second choice, and that no girl wanted to be that.\n\n\nAubrey then questioned Kelly's feelings for John and reflected that it had been why Marty had wanted to kill Kelly.  Joey maintained that he would prove his love to Kelly.  Joey then revealed that he would rather be alone than to waste one more second with Aubrey.  Joey insisted that the minute Jessica returned, Aubrey would be history.  Joey also warned that if Ford had not returned Ryder by 5:00, Joey would hold Aubrey personally responsible.\n\n\nAt the Fords' apartment, Bobby carried in Ryder and told the child to say hi to his Uncle James.  Ford revealed that Tess had helped him to get Ryder back by giving him information about Joey and Aubrey.  Bobby claimed that Aubrey had let him borrow Ryder for the afternoon.  After James doubted Tess's generosity, Ford admitted that he had agreed to release Tess from St. Ann's.\n\n\nFord explained that he had intended to leave Tess in St. Ann's, until he had heard Tess scream.  He admitted that he had felt sorry enough for her to return, and that he had tried to release her.  James pointed out that Bobby had already obtained the information to get custody of Ryder back, but that Ford had still returned to get Tess out.  James stated, \"Dude, you're totally falling in love with Tess.\"\n\n\nAt St. Ann's, Bess visited Tess in her isolation room and demanded that Tess let Jessica back out.  Bess pointed out that Tess's fun had landed Tess back in St. Ann's again.  Bess informed Tess that she would receive electric shock therapy in the hospital.  After Tess yelled that Ford still cared about her and would return to release her, Bess remarked that Ford only cared about Ryder, not Tess, and that he was \"merely a desperate father trying to reclaim his son.\"\n\n\nWhen Tess maintained that Bobby would return to spring her from the mental hospital, Bess observed that Tess was still there.  Then Bess commented that she was afraid it would happen and explained,  \"You're falling in love with Robert Ford.\"  Tess insisted that she hated Ford.  Bess then remembered that Tess had fallen in love with Nash, and that later, Jessica had also fallen in love with Nash, once she had returned.  Bess claimed that she did not want Tess's heart to be broken again, once they were integrated.\n\n\nBess reminded Tess that only Jessica could have relationships.  \"I strongly urge you to stop thinking about Robert Ford.  To do otherwise is futile.\"  Tess yelled again that she hated Robert Ford, and that the only thing she needed from Ford was his disgusting brute force to get her out of there.  Tess blared, \"As soon as he springs me, I'm gonna run as far away from that vain, shallow, womanizing, slobbering, preening, iron-pumping jerk, as I can get.\"\n\n\nBack at the Ford apartment, Bobby denied that he was in love with Tess.  James reminded Ford that he had already held all of the dirt on Joey and Aubrey and asked why Bobby would risk being arrested and losing the chance to regain custody of Ryder, if Ford was not into Tess.  Ford responded, \"Okay, how about this?  Tess is a nasty, miserable, selfish, vile lowlife.  All she ever did is insult me, laugh at me, and...and tell me I was bad in bed every chance she got.  I wanted to kill her every day.\"\n\n\nJames reminded Bobby that there was a thin line between love and hate.  James feared that Ford was falling for someone who was not real, and that once Jessica returned, Tess would vanish.  Ford again denied having feelings for Tess.  Bobby then thought back on his past with Tess and exclaimed, \"Oh, my God, is James right?  It's impossible.  Could I really be falling for that skanky bitch?\"\n\n\nBack at St. Ann's, Bess claimed that Tess could hide her feelings from herself, but that she could not hide them from the gatekeeper.  When Tess denied again that she had feelings for Ford, Bess reminded Tess that she had run to Cutter to deny her feelings for Robert Ford.  Bess declared that Tess had put herself in the position to be at St. Ann's, where she was waiting for her prince to rescue her.  Tess reflected on her past with Ford and cried out, \"Oh, my God, is Bess right?  This can't be happening.  Could I really be falling for that sleazy bastard?\"\n\n\nAlso at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, John and Blair discussed Patrick Thornhart, and John wondered how Tomas had known Patrick.  When he reflected that Patrick had been mixed up with Irish terrorists, John questioned if that was relevant.  Blair asked if John was just trying to dig up dirt on Tomas and thought that John was blowing her information out of proportion.  John's phone rang, and he left to answer it.\n\n\nStarr carried Hope into the caf\u00e9 and joined Blair.  Starr asked why Blair and John had been talking about Patrick Thornhart and wondered if it had anything to do with Cole.  Blair insisted that everything was fine and then asked about Starr's date with James.  Blair admitted that she had known what was happening when she had discovered James in the elevator, and Starr indicated that she had found Tomas in her elevator.  They both laughed, when they realized that they had been totally busted.\n\n\nStarr revealed that nothing had happened between her and James that night, and Blair admitted that there had been nothing romantic between her and Tomas, either.  Blair believed that Tomas was one of the good guys, but she still had lots of questions about him.  Starr announced that James had told her that he loved her.  Starr then stated that she was glad that she and James had not slept together the previous night.\n\n\nStarr admitted that she still cared about Cole but feared that he was all alone.  Starr did not feel that she could help Cole deal with Marty, and she believed that she was letting Cole down as a friend.  Blair told Starr to take Hope to visit Cole to remind him that he was not alone.  Once Starr got off the phone, she informed Blair that she and Hope would be leaving to visit Cole in Statesville.  Blair claimed that Cole was lucky to have a beautiful little girl and a friend like Starr.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Roxy carried in a huge tray of food and was shocked to find that Natalie was no longer in her bed.  Roxy indicated to Brody that she had only been away from Natalie for a couple of minutes.  Brody hollered that he knew where Natalie was heading and ran out of the room. Outside of the caf\u00e9, John received a call from Roxy, who said that Natalie was missing.  Roxy feared that the lunatic Marty had her.\n\n\nJohn ran into Natalie's hospital room, and Roxy informed him that Brody had claimed to know where Natalie was.  John called in a hospital security guard, handed him a picture of Natalie, and asked him to review their security footage.  When Roxy questioned why John carried a photo of Natalie in his wallet, John walked off.\n\n\nInside Todd's pool house, as she glanced at her gun, Marty expressed to Liam that she and John would be together, and that the three of them would be a family.  Natalie hobbled up the walk on a crutch outside of the pool house.  Natalie fell down and screamed.  Marty looked out of her blinds, saw Natalie, and realized that Natalie was still alive.  Marty opened up the door and found Natalie in pain.  Marty pointed the gun at Natalie.\n\n\nOutside of Todd's mansion, Brody held out his gun as he searched the property.  Brody heard Natalie's scream and ran to her.  Unseen, Marty saw Brody and slammed the door of the pool house.  When Natalie begged Brody to look for Liam in the pool house, Brody claimed that he needed a search warrant.\n\n\nAs Roxy suspected to John that Natalie had set her up, Brody carried Natalie into the hospital.  John gazed through the window as Brody and Roxy kept Natalie company in her room.  Natalie yelled that Brody should be at Todd's pool house to search for their son.  John walked in and announced that they had a warrant to search Todd's property.  John and Brody left to find Liam.\n\n\nRoxy revealed that John still carried a picture of Natalie in his wallet, but Natalie claimed that she could only think of Liam.  Roxy reminded Natalie that both John and Brody were looking for Liam.  Roxy cheered, \"It's like he has double daddies.\"\n\n\nThe man with a scar, who resembled the original Todd, started to escape, when he overheard the guards talking to Patrick Thornhart.  Baker informed Patrick that they would be taking him to Llanview, Pennsylvania.  Baker then ordered Agent Jones to escort Patrick to the plane safely.  The Todd-like man walked out.\n\n\nThe man who resembled the original Todd hid on the plane, as Baker told Patrick Thornhart not to deviate from the plan to pick up Patrick's wife.  Baker insisted that the plane would take both Patrick and Marty to their destination.  Baker announced, \"All right, we touch down in Llanview any minute.\"  The man with the scar peeked around the corner.\n\n\nIn Todd's mansion, Tomas informed Todd that Patrick Thornhart was not dead.  Tomas then declared that they would offer to reunite Marty with Patrick in exchange for the disc.  When Todd questioned if Patrick were still alive, Tomas claimed that he had proof of it.  Todd still insisted that if Patrick had been alive, he would have returned to Marty and Cole.  Tomas handed Todd the proof.\n\n\nTodd asked Tomas where he had retrieved it, but Tomas refused to tell him.  Tomas then indicated that once Marty had given them the disc, they would turn her in to the authorities.  However, Todd feared that John would not believe them, so he felt that they should get Marty out of the country.  Yet Tomas believed that Marty was still obsessed with John McBain, and he questioned if Marty would be willing to turn over the disc for the chance to reunite with her husband.  Todd said, \"It's worth a shot.\"\n\n\nInside the pool house, Marty yelled and asked how Natalie could have survived the fall from the roof.  She told Liam to sleep, so that she could leave for the hospital to take care of Natalie.  When she tried to leave, Todd and Tomas stopped her.  Tomas announced that Patrick Thornhart was still alive.  Marty whined that they were pathetic for lying to her about her dead husband.\n\n\nTodd then handed her a picture of Patrick and told Marty to look at the digital date of the previous day that was imprinted on the photo.  Todd showed Marty more pictures of Patrick and gave her his file.  Marty believed that Todd and Tomas were trying to fool her to get the disc back.  Tomas's phone rang, and he left to answer it.\n\n\nTodd told Marty that they would put her and Patrick on a plane that would take them to Paris.  When Marty expressed her fear that they would turn her in to rot in jail, Todd explained that it would be safer to have Marty out of the country than for her to be running around and telling cops what was on the disc.\n\n\nTodd stressed that Marty would never have John, but that Patrick was the love of her life.  Todd vowed that if Marty told him where the disc was, she could leave to be with Patrick.  Todd also felt that Cole would want Marty to give Liam back to his mother.  Tomas returned and told Marty that the plane was on its way.\n\n\nJohn and Brody arrived on Todd's property and began the search.  Brody called Natalie and informed her that they had not yet found Liam.  Brody insisted that he would get their son back.  John and Brody kicked in the front door of Todd's mansion, and the cops ran through the house, as they searched for Liam.  John left to check the rest of the grounds.  John kicked in the door of the pool house.  John discovered Tomas, who was holding Liam.\n\n\nAfter Todd and Marty traveled to the site to meet the plane, Todd stated that the plane would be there in a few minutes.  Marty announced that she could not get on the plane.  Todd remarked, \"Marty, you have nothing left here, right?  You've done the right thing giving the baby to Tomas and telling me where you hid the disc.\"  \n\n\nWhen Marty said, \"No, there's something else I have to do,\" Todd declared, \"No, there's no time.  If you stay here, you're going to be arrested, and you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.  Wouldn't you rather be with Patrick?\"  Marty exclaimed, \"That's not it.  I have to tell John that Liam isn't Brody's son; he's his.  John is Liam's father.\" \n\n\n",
