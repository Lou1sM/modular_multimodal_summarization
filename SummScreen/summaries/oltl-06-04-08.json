Clint was livid when he realized that Dorian had been motivated to takeover B.E. because he had ended their relationship. Overcome with fury, Clint began strangling Dorian. Luckily, there were people nearby who reacted immediately and pulled Clint off of Dorian. Seconds after Dorian was freed from Clint's grasp, a commotion above caught everyone's attention. Rex managed to push Gigi out of the way just as glass began raining down on them. \n\n\nNash threw a punch at Jared. When Jared pushed Nash off of him, Nash stumbled backwards and fell over a balcony. Nash crashed through a plate glass ceiling and landed in a bloody heap on the lower level. Jessica screamed and rushed to her unconscious husband's side. When the paramedics arrived, they found a weak pulse and determined that Nash was breathing. They decided to do a \"scoop and run\" because time was of the essence. \n\n\nCharlie was taken to the hospital and treated for alcohol poisoning. Michael credited Viki with saving Charlie's life. As they discussed Charlie's condition, it became clear that each believed that Charlie had relapsed. Viki remained with Charlie, while he slept, and vowed to help him through his latest crisis. \n\n\nLayla dropped by Adriana's loft bearing gifts for the new bride. They talked about Gigi's confession at the wedding and Dorian's role in it. Layla was surprised to learn that Dorian had tried to sabotage Adriana's wedding. They also discussed the situation with Shane. Layla felt certain that Gigi would have already told Rex that Shane was his son, if she wanted him to know the truth. As they were chatting, Rex walked in. Adriana realized immediately that he was quite agitated. As soon as Layla left, Adriana learned why. Rex told her that Charlie was not his father and then showed her the note that he had received just before the shareholders meeting for B.E. He asked Adriana if she knew about Charlie and then warned her not to lie to him. Adriana told Rex that she had no idea that Charlie wasn't Rex's father but she did admit that she had lied to Rex. \n\n\nAntonio went to Ramsey's penthouse to gather information. To explain his sudden appearance on Ramsey's doorstep, Antonio told Ramsey that he had been concerned when Ramsey had suddenly left the police station. Antonio pretended to be anxious about being paid his share of the heist so that he could cover Jamie's medical expenses. Ramsey assured Antonio that he would get his money but cautioned him against paying off all of Jamie's medical expenses. Ramsey pointed out that a sudden influx of money would raise questions with the wrong people. Before Antonio left, Ramsey made it clear that all of their future meetings had to be conducted at the police station, not at his penthouse. \n\n\nJohn and Talia searched Ramsey's office while Antonio paid the police commissioner a surprise visit. John discovered a series of chest and head X-rays of a woman and copies of articles about seizures from what appeared to be medical journals. When Talia spotted Eddie in the squad room, they scrambled to cover their tracks. John hid while Talia remained out in the open, behind Ramsey's desk. Eddie walked in and immediately demanded to know what Talia was doing in Ramsey's office with the door closed. Talia explained that she had wanted privacy while she turned in her badge and gun. Eddie believed her and walked her out of the office. Later, John and Antonio managed to meet secretly and discuss their findings. Both men were determined to find out what and whom Ramsey was hiding. \n\n\nJessica and her family arrived at the hospital with Nash, who remained in critical condition. When Jared learned that Charlie had been admitted to the hospital earlier, he rushed to check on his father. Jared didn't realize that Viki was in the room, with Charlie, as he approached his father's bed calling out \"Dad! Dad!\" Viki wanted to know why Jared was calling Charlie \"Dad,\" but before Jared could answer her, Natalie, visibly distraught, burst into the room to fetch her mother. After Viki and Natalie stepped out, Jared looked at Charlie's chart and read that he had been admitted for alcohol poisoning. Jared blamed himself for his father's relapse. \n\n\nIn the hospital hallway, Clint, Natalie, and Sarah filled Viki in on what had happened during and after the shareholders meeting. Viki was stunned when Natalie confessed that she was in love with Jared. \n\n\nSean was annoyed when his television program was interrupted with late breaking news about B.E.'s shareholders meeting. David soon joined Sean in front of the television, and a few minutes later, Dorian walked in. She had tried calling the hospital earlier to get an update on Nash but to no avail. When Dorian learned that there had been a report on television, she asked if they had mentioned how Nash was doing. She was disappointed to learn that Nash was in critical condition. Sean soon made his excuses and left the room while David remained behind and asked Dorian about their big payoff. Dorian's victory seemed hollow as she began to pour champagne and toast herself on the successful execution of her plans. While they sipped champagne, David casually asked what Dorian had done with Charlie earlier that morning. \n\n\nMichael stepped out of Nash's room to give Jessica and her family an update about Nash's condition. He had the grim task of telling them that Nash's injuries were too grave for him to survive surgery. He advised everyone to say their goodbyes to Nash. Jessica began sobbing hysterically.\n\n\n",
