    "soap_central": "\n The Waiting Is The Hardest Part \n\n\n \nWalking in on Stacy and Rex in bed together, Gigi and Schuyler were appalled. Recovering enough to speak, Gigi explained her attempts to reach them on the phone, the dark loft and her key that let them in. She was there to retrieve Shane's baseball glove but she wanted to know what Rex was doing in bed with her sister. \n\n\nSpotting Stacy's black eye, Schuyler refused to believe her story about Stan hitting her. He knew Vegas Stan and he would never hit a woman, Schuyler insisted. Gigi thought it possible that Stacy had used makeup to garner sympathy. Rex accused Schuyler of stealing Stacy's money. As everyone hurled accusations at each other, Schuyler pulled Gigi aside and reminded her not to lose sight of the real reason for their visit. He suggested they get the glove and leave. \n\n\nRex found himself explaining that he was merely comforting Stacy when she had a nightmare about Stan. Gigi found that odd, clarifying that Stacy never remembered dreams when they were kids. Stacy quickly defended herself as Rex attacked Schuyler again, asking why he was with Gigi when Starr was more his speed. Rex wanted Schuyler and Gigi to leave and told them the baseball glove was in Shane's backpack. He had forgotten to tell the boy. \n\n\nAs Gigi followed Stacy into the next room, she told her sister, \"You're going down.\" Stacy pointed out that she was already in Rex's bed and if Gigi hadn't walked in... Before she could finish, Gigi physically attacked her sister. Schuyler asked to use Rex's bathroom but Rex refused to let him by. He also emphasized that he did not want Schuyler around his son. \n\n\nSuddenly the guys heard the sound of the girls fighting and rushed in to pull them apart. Rex told Gigi she had gone off the deep end. She, in turn, informed Rex that he needed a reality check. Demanding the return of his key, Rex ordered Schuyler and Gigi to leave. Stacy smirked in the background. Once the pair left, Stacy wondered aloud why Gigi was so mean. Rex complained that he didn't understand Gigi anymore. \n\n\nOut in the hallway a discouraged Schuyler admitted that he couldn't get to the bathroom to grab Stacy's toothbrush for the DNA test. A triumphant Gigi held up a handful of hair. She had pulled it out of Stacy's head during their fight. \n\n\nOrdering Cristian to take his feet off the coffee table, Layla placed a plate of hors d'oeuvres in their spot. She informed her new roommate that she was hosting an open house in order to obtain a third roommate. When a knock resounded on the door, she was surprised to see Oliver Fish standing outside. Assuring them that he was not there on official business, he advised them that he was there in response to the roommate search. He needed a new place to live. \n\n\nA confused Fish couldn't believe that Cris and Layla were roommates, remembering that they were usually at each other's throats. A self-conscious Fish began to apologize for his one-night stand with Stacy and as the words began to tumble from his mouth, Layla quickly stopped him. She was over it, she insisted. Thinking it best to leave, Fish headed for the door. Cris quickly stopped him. He wanted Fish to live with them. \n\n\nLayla took Cris aside. She couldn't believe that he would want a roommate who had humiliated her. Her opinions of Fish were more like those for a serial killer, Cris pointed out to her. As Fish and Cris played up Fish's good qualities, she could only think awful things about him. Giving Fish a test, she asked that the television be hooked up to the converter box. \n\n\nAs Fish easily hooked up the converter box, getting the television ready for the digital TV transitioning, Cris and Layla decided he could move in. Layla told him he could have the room that was formerly Talia's. Fish was honored to fill Talia's spot. Wrapping his arms around his new roommates, Fish declared them the Three Musketeers. The other two quickly pulled away and told him to never say that again. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Moe and Noelle put together a meal but Starr, Cole, Langston, and Markko were too anxious and nervous to eat. They were awaiting word on Jessica and the baby. \"It's killing me,\" Starr stressed. As the teens quietly stood around, Noelle beamed over how happy Marcie probably was. Awkwardly, Starr's friends changed the subject, but Noelle didn't take the hint. She cited the kind and wonderful mother that Hope would have in Marcie. \n\n\nAs the kids sat around in a funk, Shaun answered the front door. Matthew wanted to pay a visit to Starr and, as he headed for the kitchen in his wheelchair, Rachel, who had accompanied him, offered to visit with a very pleased Shaun. Shaun's pleasure turned to displeasure when his sister, Destiny, showed up. Rachel excused herself to make a phone call as Destiny beamed and showed Shaun the letter she had received from their brother, Gregory. He promised to visit soon, she explained. \n\n\nShaun was angry and reminded her that Gregory had \"left [them] in the dust\" when he had gone to seek his fame and fortune. Upon hearing that Matthew was there, Destiny went in search of her friend. Finished with her call, Rachel returned to the room. She hoped that Shaun was okay, admitting that she had heard him yelling. He explained that he didn't want his brother to hurt his sister. He had hurt them in the past. Lightening up, he asked Rachel on a date to Capricorn, noting that he wasn't \"all work and no play.\" Rachel readily agreed. \n\n\nEveryone in the kitchen was happy to see Matthew and, seeing how morose they were, he offered to get some information for them. He called his dad and learned that the baby was safe and that hopefully they would be returning soon. Matthew relayed the information and the glumness disappeared. Everyone was thrilled, most of all Starr. Matthew hoped that he, too, would find his own miracle. He said goodbye and headed off to find his sister. Noelle ruined the mood again when she wondered aloud where the baby would be going upon her return. Starr calmly told her that she didn't know, but was only thinking about the baby's safety. \n\n\nHappily finding Matthew, Destiny offered to tutor him for their math final. Matthew consented and they arranged to meet. As she left, Destiny told Shaun that he was wrong about their brother. Shaun looked at the letter again and wondered what his brother's real motive was for returning to Llanview. \n\n\nAs the group of teens became chatty after hearing the good news, they talked about the baby; the clouds returned when Noelle spoke up. She noted that before long, baby Hope would be calling Marcie \"Momma.\" \n\n\nIn West Virginia, Bo informed Clint that the local police force would be storming the Brennans' house. They only saw that the baby had been taken, in addition to the other crimes that Jessica had committed as her other personalities. Upstairs, a hysterical Jessica recalled the night of her baby's stillborn birth and the events that led to Bess exchanging the baby with Hope. \n\n\nViki did her best to comfort her daughter, as memory after memory returned. As Jessica relived the past, the thought that she had left her dead baby without kissing her goodbye tore at her heart. She wailed that she hadn't even told the baby about Nash. At the same time, Jessica realized that she had pushed aside her own feelings and had fallen asleep that eventful night. She had known that her mother and father would find her with the baby. She could hardly believe that she never questioned anything when she awoke. \n\n\nBrody waited out the day alongside Jared and Natalie, and expressed his surprise that they were being nice to him. Natalie confessed her realization that Brody was devoted to her sister, and Brody took it a step further. He admitted that he loved Jessica. He also understood why Natalie had kept quiet about the babies' identities, in order to protect Jessica. Natalie confessed that her sister had indeed found some happiness in the past year with Brody, which was another reason why she was inclined to accept him. \n\n\nCharlie made it clear to Clint that he was okay with Viki needing Clint at such a terrible time. Clint acknowledged that Viki needed Charlie, also, and added that the events going on before their eyes would affect them all. Finally, insisting that he go upstairs to see what was happening, Clint received the okay from Bo. As Viki assured Jessica that they would \"get through it\" they heard a soft knock on the door and Clint calling out. Viki opened the door, assuring Jessica that they were all there for her. \"She remembers. She's Jessica,\" Viki told Clint quietly. As Viki took the baby from her daughter, Jessica crumbled in her father's arms. \n\n\nDownstairs, everyone anxiously waited for Jessica, Viki, and Clint to descend. The Brennans insisted on returning to their home. As they were feeling badly about their deceased son and granddaughter, Charlie urged them to visit Llanview, because they still had a granddaughter there to bond with. Suddenly, Viki appeared on the stairs with the baby. Bo called off the tactical team. Clint and Jessica emerged next. Looking at Brody, but not really seeming to see him, Jessica hugged her dad. He told her they were going home. A wounded Brody looked on. An overjoyed Starr received the call she had been waiting for. \n\n\nAs Layla settled herself onto the sofa between her new roommates with a bowlful of popcorn, she changed the channel on the television. Grumbling, the guys complained that they each had their own shows that they wanted to watch. As the roommates began to disagree, with Layla tossing some popcorn around, the bowl was spilled over Layla's head.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n",
