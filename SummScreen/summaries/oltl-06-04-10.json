When Kelly told Shaun that he did not have to watch over her, Shaun reminded Kelly that it was his job, and that was why Dorian paid him his checks.  Shaun noticed something suspicious outside, jerked open the doors, and yelled, \"Freeze.\"  He opened the door to Reed, who was standing out in the rain.\n\n\nAfter Reed requested entrance, Shaun frisked him, as Kelly demanded that Shaun stop.  When Kelly asked why Reed was at the mansion, Reed admitted that he had wanted some unsupervised moments with Kelly, which was why he had attempted to slip in unnoticed.  Reed had regretted not seeing Kelly since they had returned from New York.  Kelly explained that she had been busy working on Ford's story.  Reed asked Kelly for a date, and Kelly informed Reed that he could escort her to a wedding.  Shaun jumped up from the sofa and exclaimed that he loved weddings.  When Kelly insisted that she would be safe without him at the wedding, Shaun announced that he had his own invitation, and therefore, would accompany them.\n\n\nIn the lobby of La Boulaie, Blair answered the door and found Eli.  Blair told Eli that she needed a big favor.  Blair explained that she had been asked to sing at Nora's wedding.  Blair felt that if she did not sing, Kelly would, and Blair could not let that happen.  Blair's favor was for Eli to be her date, and Eli mentioned that he had received his invitation weeks before.  Blair demanded to know if everyone had been invited to the wedding, except her, and then wondered why Eli had not yet asked her to be his date.  Eli insisted that he would be proud to be her date, and they kissed.\n\n\nAs Kelly, Reed, and Shaun entered the lobby, Kelly introduced Reed to Blair and Eli.  Blair slyly stated, \"Don't try to kill this one, Kelly.\"  Kelly replied, \"Like you did with Max?\"  Reed suggested that since they were all going to the wedding, they should go together.  Blair and Kelly declared a truce and agreed that they could somehow manage to go together.\n\n\nIn the church, Matthew sprayed cans of air freshener, as Dani walked in.  Dani requested that Matthew quit spraying and listen to her but then wondered why the church smelled like skunk.  Matthew explained about the visiting skunk and then asked Dani what she had wanted to tell him.  Before Dani could say, Matthew feared he would not be able to get the skunk smell out of the church and claimed that he did not want his parents' wedding to be postponed.  \n\n\nDani asserted that sometimes one had to face the truth and attempted to tell Matthew her truth again, when John interrupted her.  Matthew asked John if the church smelled different.  After John sniffed the air, he replied, \"Besides the skunk?  No, I don't smell anything\" and left.  As Dani started to tell Matthew yet again, Brody entered the church with many pots of flowers.  Dani shook her head.\n\n\nAt Foxy Roxy's, after a timer went off, Nora demanded that Roxy take the hair dryer off of her head, Natalie insisted that Roxy check Nora's hair.  Roxy hesitantly removed the dryer and then exclaimed that she could not believe it.  Stunned, Roxy and Natalie stared at Nora, as Nora yelled for somebody to get her a mirror.  Roxy handed Nora the mirror, and Nora cried, \"It's me.  It's actually me.\"  Nora's hair had been restored to a glorious red.  Nora expressed her surprised, and Roxy was shocked also.  \n\n\nViki and Gigi arrived out of the rain and were thrilled to see that Nora's hair was again red.  Viki told Nora that she would be a most magnificent bride.  Nora cried that she still needed to fix \"the tooth, the eye, the dress.\"  Gigi announced, \"No worries on the dress.  We've got you covered.\"  Nora asked, \"Seriouthly?\"  Viki answered, \"Seriouthly.  We found the absolutely most fabulous dress and it was right under our noses the whole time.\"  As Gigi showed Nora the dress, Nora stared in shock.\n\n\nNora realized that the dress was from the first time that she had married Bo.  Viki then showed Nora the suit that Bo had also worn for the first wedding.  In tears, Nora expressed her sincere gratitude.  Viki indicated that Charlie could swing by on his way to the church and take the suit to Bo.  Gigi said that she would call Rex, so that he could tell Bo.\n\n\nAt the church, as Bo lay in a bathtub of tomato juice, and while Rex poured more juice over Bo's head, David entered the room.  Each expressed their surprise to the other.  Rex kidded David that bathing in tomato juice, before getting married, was a Buchanan tradition.  However, Bo explained to David that he had actually been sprayed by a skunk.  David announced that he was there for Bo's wedding and offered Rex and Bo Cuban cigars.  Bo revealed that it was a rule not to smoke in the church and insisted that it would be a bad omen to break the rules.  The men just held their cigars without lighting them, and David emphasized that Bo deserved the best.  Bo reminded the men that he was getting the best - Nora.  David voiced, \"You can count on me.  With pride, I look forward to calling her Mom.\"\n\n\nThe men welcomed John with a cigar, and John reported that Blair would be the wedding singer.  Bo was relieved and grateful.  Brody walked in with a tuxedo and grabbed a cigar.  When Brody revealed the tux to be powder blue with black trim and a ruffled white shirt, the men grimaced.  David remarked, \"If disco comes back, you'll be right in style, Pa.\"  Brody insisted that it was the last tuxedo in town.  David observed that the color matched Bo's eyes, as Rex's phone rang.  Gigi asked Rex if Bo would accept a last-minute change in attire, and Rex stated, \"Bring it on.  The sooner, the better.\"\n\n\nHowever, back at Roxy's, Nora was still depressed - about her eye and her tooth.  Roxy questioned if all of the bad karma was a sign, and Viki warned, \"Not today.\"  Gigi reminded Nora that Jessica was searching for a dentist.  Natalie called Jessica, who informed her that the dentist was on his way.  Sadly, Nora lisped that Roxy might be right, and although she tried unsuccessfully several times to say \"to shake a stick at,\" Nora had to settle with saying that there had been a lot of signs.  Nora speculated, \"Bo's over there thinking everything's fine.  He doesn't have a clue.\"\n\n\nAs Matthew arrived with the suit, he greeted his big brother, David, and announced that the skunk smell in the church was gone.  Bo played the harmonica, as he sat in the tub, and asked how much longer he would need to soak.  The guys compromised and felt that twelve and a half minutes would cover it.  After another sniff, Rex felt that Bo needed a few more minutes to soak, in order to remove the skunk smell.  Bo sadly stated, \"Nora's over there thinking everything's fine.  If she only knew\" and placed his cigar in his mouth.\n\n\nAfter Dani showed Brody where to place the flowers in the church, Dani, Matthew, and Brody took a huge whiff and could only smell flowers.  After Brody left, Matthew placed a pink flower in Dani's hair and said that she was beautiful.  Uncomfortable, Dani removed the flower and attempted to tell Matthew the truth again, as Charlie interrupted her.  Matthew took the suit from Charlie and related that he would take it to Bo.  After Matthew left, Charlie felt that something was wrong and suggested that Dani could talk to \"Uncle Charlie\" at any time.  Dani turned down his offer but thanked him.\n\n\nJessica arrived at the salon with Murray Zittle, who was actually a first-year dental student at Llanview University.  Once Jessica explained that Murray was the only one who would \"do a house call,\" Nora asked Murray about his dental experience.  Murray responded, \"Well, we haven't worked on actual people yet, but there's a big section on broken teeth in Emergency Dentistry 102.\"  Viki cried out, \"Perfect!\"  After Murray examined Nora's tooth, he revealed that he would be unable to fix it.  Natalie gave Murray a pep talk, slapped him, and demanded that he \"get cracking\" on fixing Nora's tooth.\n\n\nMurray, dressed in a pink apron, announced that he was finished.  Nora smiled, and all could see that her tooth had been fixed.  Roxy declared that Murray was a genius and gave him several big kisses.  When Nora still fretted about her eye, Gigi suggested that Nora take her eye patch off.  Nora removed the patch, and her eye had healed itself.  Then, when Nora was afraid to walk without her crutch, Natalie yelled that fear would get Nora nowhere.  Nora begged Natalie not to slap her too.  Viki pressed Nora to try to walk without the crutch.  As Jessica and Viki grabbed each of Nora's arms, Nora found that she could indeed walk.  The ladies cheered.\n\n\nRoxy discovered white wine to symbolize the wedding, and Natalie provided the toast.  \"I never met two people who belong together more than Bo and Nora.  They've overcome every obstacle that was thrown in their path.  They never lose sight of what really matters.  Here's to Nora Buchanan.\"  The women and Murray all exclaimed, \"To Nora.\"\n\n\nDavid found a bottle of red wine to go with the tomato sauce.  When the men mentioned their concerns, David insisted that the church wine would be fine to drink, because it had not been blessed yet.  David wanted to toast his \"pa,\" before Bo got married.  As the men drank the wine and Matthew drank water, David presented his toast, which he attributed to Kipling.  \"A woman is just a woman.  But a good cigar is a smoke.  To Bo and Nora.\"  John asked to extend the toast.  \"Some people get married, because they think they can live with each other.  I think the best marriages are between two people who can't live without each other.  They complete each other.  They make each other stronger.  To our friend, Bo, who inspires me every day, inspires all of us every day.  To Bo and Nora.\"\n\n\nNatalie asked Roxy if she wanted a ride to the wedding, but Roxy turned her down.  Roxy felt that she had a better offer with Murray, and they left the salon together.  Nora thanked Natalie, Jessica, and Gigi for all of their hard work, and then asked them to please be her bridesmaids.  The girls expressed their delight, as they left the shop.  When Nora and Viki gazed at Nora, clad in her wedding gown, in the mirror, Nora announced that she was shocked that the gown still \"fits like a glove.\"  As Nora prepared to leave for the church, she searched for her umbrella.  Viki announced that Nora would no longer need it, because the weather had cleared up, and the sun was shining.\n\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, Bo requested to see the suit.  Upon seeing the suit, Bo and Matthew thought that it was \"so cool.\"  Brody announced that it was time for Bo to \"get hitched.\"  After the guys left, and Bo was dressed, Matthew gave Bo a huge hug and told him that his parents' marriage was what he had wanted more than anything.  As they hugged, Bo pictured in his mind how he and Nora had danced at their first wedding.\n\n\nIn the church, Kelly, Blair, Eli, Reed, and Shaun arrived and saw Dani.  Blair noticed that Dani looked sad and wondered if T\u00e9a had told her the truth.  When Blair asked Dani if she was down, Dani replied that she was fine, and that she was just waiting for Matthew.\n\n\nShaun greeted John; Blair was not happy at seeing David; and Kelly introduced Reed to David, who stated that they had already met.  Brody greeted Jessica; John welcomed Natalie; and Gigi walked up to Rex.  All heads turned as Bo entered the church.  Bo breathed in the smell of the flowers in the church and gave thanks.\n\n\nBo wondered about Andrew, and Rex realized that he had forgotten to get him.  However, David informed Bo that the airport had shut down after David's plane had arrived.  Bo demanded to know who would marry them.  Bo screamed, \"After all of this...rain, wildlife, tomato juice baths...everything but a plague of locusts.  Now we find that we don't even have a preacher...or a rabbi either.\"  When Charlie attempted to calm him, Bo cried, \"My bride will be here in just a couple of minutes, and we don't even have anybody to perform the ceremony.\"  As David raised his hand, he asked, \"How about me?\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Right when Bo and Nora are both ready to call off the wedding, Roxy fixes Nora's hair with motivation from Natalie. She finds a dentist to fix her tooth. She does not have to wear the patch on her eye and she can walk in her wedding shoes. Viki and Gigi even find her original wedding dress that she wore to her first wedding to Bo. He has a similar victory overcoming obstacles. Matthew gets rid of the skunk smell in the church. Brody brings a truck load of flowers. And Charlie brings Bo his wedding tux that he first married Nora in. Everything is ready to go off without a hitch. Except they discover that they do not have Reverend Carpenter to perform the wedding ceremony.",
