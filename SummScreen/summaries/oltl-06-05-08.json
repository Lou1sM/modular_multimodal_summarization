    "soap_central": "\nMY HEART\n\n\nAs Shane was spending the night at Matthew's, Brody offered Gigi a swig from his bottle when she returned home. She filled him in on the events of the day; the note that Rex found in his program about his lying wife and Nash falling through the skylight. Brody realized that Gigi was in shock as she shivered and recounted the blood and broken glass. He covered her with a blanket and offered her another drink. As he wrapped his arms around her, she disclosed that she would never be able to forget what she saw. Suggesting she close her eyes and meditate, Brody divulged that it was a trick that he learned while serving in Afghanistan. He admitted that he would think about things that he might be happy doing someday and that it didn't work all of the time. Gigi acknowledged that Adriana would probably tell Rex that he was Shane's dad that very evening. Brody felt that if Rex hadn't figured it out yet, then he wouldn't, and that Adriana would be too afraid of losing him to tell him herself. \n\n\nRex demanded the truth from Adriana and accused her of trying to squirm out of it as she stalled and stuttered. He told her about Nash's falling and that it was Dorian's fault. When she learned that he and Gigi were standing near when Nash fell, Adriana was more concerned about that. A perturbed Rex called her on it, and Adriana complained about Gigi being involved in their lives from the moment they became engaged. She reminded him of the ring purchase that he made from Gigi and how he never told Adriana that he had seen Gigi. As Adriana accused Rex of changing, he continued to demand the truth from her. Finally, after being pressured, Adriana admitted to finding Brody and bringing him to Llanview, as she was so afraid of losing Rex. She claimed it was a favor to Gigi and Shane, and now the woman would stop \"lusting\" after Rex. She apologized for lying and truly hoped that Rex would remember that he loved her. \n\n\nNora returned home and learned, thankfully, that Shane and Matthew were watching a movie. She proceeded to tell Nigel of Dorian's announcement about Jared and proclaimed that God should help whoever else was involved, as she was certain that Jared could not have perpetrated the scam on his own. \n\n\nAs David and Dorian toasted her success, David accused Dorian of keeping Charlie \"stashed and trashed\" in the house. Dorian denied it and even swore on Adriana's life. David was ecstatic over Dorian's moneymaking scheme but wondered about his own share. Drinking expensive champagne, Dorian pointed out that his share was right there, with maybe a bit more. She admitted to lying earlier in the discussion about Charlie. David became enraged as he pointed out how he gave up the \"cash cow\" so that she could make her announcement. She advised him that they never wrote anything down and never established a definite amount. David decided that he'd settle for a job with a title, but Dorian only came up with one that included gigolo. When he suggested that perhaps Dorian should comfort Viki, she became angry that Viki had made fun of her previously. She did not concur with David's assessment that it was just a joke and ordered him out. \"United we stand, divided you fall,\" he told her on his way out. \n\n\nJessica became hysterical when Michael indicated that they had done everything possible for Nash but that he had too many injuries. She refused to say good-bye to her husband and ran for the hospital chapel, where she cried and prayed. She cried for Bree, who would certainly never remember her father, and for her new baby. She cried that she was the one who was supposed to have died. Viki and Clint arrived and kindly told her that she couldn't pray for something that couldn't happen. They urged her to go to her husband's bedside. She asked that Bree be brought to the hospital. \n\n\nNatalie cried, too, as she told Jared that Nash was dying. They agreed that they both wanted to see him. Sarah stopped by Nash's bedside with Bo, unable to go inside the room alone. Nash removed his oxygen mask long enough to ask Bo if he was dying. \"I'm sorry,\" was Bo's only response. He indicated that they would be there for Nash, who could only keep repeating Jessica's name. \n\n\n\"Who are you?\" Rex asked Adriana. He proceeded to tell her that she wasn't herself, but her mother. Adriana insisted she wasn't like her mother at all and besides, she thought that everything had turned out okay after all. \"Hello?\" Rex responded. She told Rex that her actions were all his fault and that he drove her to it. He told her that the things he always loved about her were her innocence and honesty. She insisted she was still those things and suggested they leave for their honeymoon so that they would be able to work things out. She told Rex that she loved him and didn't want him to leave, as he took steps towards the door. He said that he used to think she knew what love meant but accused her of wrecking everything. He shoved her and stalked out the door, knocking over and breaking their framed picture in the process. \n\n\nAs Nat and Jared approached Nash's room, they were stopped by Bo, who thought that Nat should see him alone. She abruptly told him that if she thought that was a good idea she would have done so. Bo stepped aside and let them through. Nat apologized to Nash and told him he had proven her wrong. She promised to always take care of Jess and Bree. Jared indicated that he would spend the rest of his life making it up and that Nash was a \"real gentleman,\" a true compliment by his father's standards. He added that he wished he could have been more like Nash. \"Out,\" Nash murmured. \n\n\nJess arrived and glared at Nat and Jared as they emerged from Nash's room. Nat offered to get Bree but her offer was turned down. Sarah was asked to pick up the little girl. Clint asked Jared to leave, indicating that the family wanted privacy. Everyone ignored Nat as she explained that she had to take Jared into the room with her to apologize. She reiterated that it had been an accident as an incensed Clint pointed out that their lying had put the entire thing into motion. \n\n\nJess entered Nash's room and grabbed his hand. \"I have the most wonderful news,\" she told him. Jared returned to Charlie's room and cried about his responsibility in all that had happened, for Charlie and for Nash. He told his dad that it was \"like Jimmy all over again.\" It was Charlie's turn to comfort his son as his hand brushed Jared's head. \n\n\nJess told Nash of the new baby, and said that maybe it would be a son. She thought maybe it might make him fight harder. She was alive because of him, she told him, and she wished that she could return the favor. Viki walked in with Bree in her arms and handed her to Jess. Nash reached up for the little girl as Jess promised that her kids would know how much he loved them. Clint thanked him for loving Jess and told him he was a good man. Viki told him they'd never forget him. Nash cried, too, as Jess repeated that she couldn't say good-bye. \n\n\nOut in the hallway, Viki cried as she told Clint she'd heard that Jess was pregnant and that Nash would never see the new baby. Jared learned that Charlie was finally improving. \"What have I done?\" Jared cried. Nat lit candles in the hospital chapel as she sobbed. Jess told Nash how much she loved him and promised to say and think it everyday for the rest of her life. \"You are my heart, my whole heart,\" she whispered. Nash attempted to draw a heart in his palm, as Jess recalled him doing the same thing on the hospital window when she had been ill. They kissed for the last time as Nash drew his final breath.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Dorian has dropped the bombshell upon the B.E. board that Jared is a fraud, and Nash has been critically injured, everybody is in shock. Jessica knows she's going to be a pregnant widow. Everybody knows they will miss Nash, including Jared. Yet, he knows that none of the Buchanans except Natalie care for him and he has real family to care for so he goes to see Charlie in his hospital room. Dorian admits to David that she is not about to \"let him in\" on her windfall. She is angry and bitter toward him for his friendship with Viki. So she tells him he may live off of Viki instead of her. Rex tells Adriana he can no longer trust her and they are through. She pleads that he gives them a chance. But it doesn't look like he intends to.",

'I. love you, too,' he replied, and they kissed.\n"
