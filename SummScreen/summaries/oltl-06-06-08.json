    "soap_central": "\nCRAMER VERSUS CRAMER\n\n\nWhile Jessica slept, she dreamt that Nash comforted her after she awoke from a terrible nightmare. Nash told her to go back to sleep and promised to be by her side when she woke up. However, reality struck-Jess awoke and discovered herself alone in one of the bedrooms at Llanfair. She looked around the room and longed for Nash. Meanwhile, downstairs, Todd joined Viki in the kitchen. As Viki fed Bree breakfast, Todd expressed sympathy for Jessica's loss. After insulting Blair, Todd suggested that Viki check on Jess and offered to feed Bree. Viki chastised Todd for his vulgar language and headed up to see her daughter. Alone with Bree, Todd fed the child Oreo cookies and complained about losing his children. Todd was determined to win back his kids. As Todd continued to rant about Blair, there was a knock at the door. When he answered the door, a messenger handed him a letter and informed him that he had been served. \n\n\nViki attempted to console a distraught Jess. When Jess expressed concern over the vineyard and finding a place to live, Viki told her daughter that she and Bree would live at Llanfair. Viki begged her daughter to take care of herself so that she could care for her children. Jess broke down and expressed her fears of life without Nash. She had no idea how to explain the loss of Nash to Bree or how she would raise her children without their father. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair, Addie, Starr, and Langston waited for Dorian to make an announcement. Dorian informed them that they would all be board members of her new company-Cramer Enterprises. She presented the Cramer girls with a poster board that included all their faces. Blair and Addie immediately refused to have any part in Dorian's corporate takeover of Buchanan Enterprises. When Blair accused Dorian of playing a small part in Nash's demise, Dorian quickly blamed Nash's death on his business dealings with Jared and refused to accept any blame. As Dorian begged her family to join forces with her, Adriana entered the room and demanded to speak with her mother. Alone with Dorian, Adriana lashed out at her mother. Adriana informed Dorian that Rex had left her and blamed Dorian. Adriana showed Dorian the anonymous note that Rex received and accused her of the handiwork. Dorian admitted to goading Gigi into interrupting the wedding, but denied constructing the note to Rex. Refusing to believe her mother, Adriana told Dorian that she was forced to admit to Rex that she had become conniving just like her mother. Adriana accused Dorian of only wanting to be in her life in order to gain her inheritance. Adriana said that because of Dorian she had lost her identity and no longer knew who she really was. As Dorian continued to express her love for her daughter, Adriana told Dorian that she was going to do exactly what Cassie and Kelly had done and eventually what Langston would do-get as far away from Dorian as possible. \n\n\nAs Jared paid Charlie a visit in his hospital room, Rex watched unnoticed from the window. Natalie stood outside the room with Rex and encouraged him to speak with Charlie; she told him the only way he would learn the truth was if he asked. Rex asked Natalie how she learned that Charlie wasn't his father. She admitted to learning from Jared, but denied that Jared was involved in deceiving Rex. A hurt Rex blamed himself for believing Roxy and Charlie's lies. Rex refused to speak with Charlie. He noted that Charlie was busy with his real son and walked away. \n\n\nBack inside Charlie's room, Jared expressed his concern for Charlie to regain his sobriety. Charlie told Jared that there was something strange about his last episode. He stated that in the past, he would always have a recollection of what led up to him taking a drink. Charlie related to Jared that his last memory was of visiting Rex in Adriana's hospital room. He said that he was sober and later woke up in a drunken stupor with Viki by his side. As father and son attempted to gain insight on Charlie's condition, Natalie entered the room. Charlie inquired about Viki and Rex. Natalie told him that Viki was busy caring for Jessica and warned him that Rex was in no mood to speak with him. Charlie expressed his regret over not telling Rex the truth. \n\n\nRex visited Bo at the Buchanan Mansion and expressed his concern over the loss of Nash and the fall of Buchanan Enterprises. Rex offered to help dig up some information on Dorian's misdeeds, but Bo reminded him that Dorian was his mother-in-law and suggested that he speak with Adriana about the matter. When Bo insisted that Rex enjoy his honeymoon and worry about BE business afterward, Rex told Bo that the honeymoon was on hold and that he needed to keep busy. Sensing that Rex was hurt over the revelation that Charlie wasn't his father, Bo asked Rex if he had spoken to Charlie. Rex stated that he was embarrassed for believing Charlie's lies and admitted that he had recently learned that Adriana had also been lying to him. Rex acknowledged the wrongs he had done in the past, and wondered if he deserved what had happened to him. Bo told Rex that he didn't deserve anything that had happened to him and suggested that he speak with Charlie and Adriana or else he would be haunted by it forever. Rex revealed to Bo that Adriana had changed right before his eyes. Bo insisted that Rex speak with her before making any rash decisions. Before Rex left, Bo told him that he would always be there for him no matter what. Rex embraced Bo. \n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Viki managed to calm Jessica's nerves. Jess stated that she would be fine, but needed some time alone before she could face Bree. At that moment there was a knock at the door. Jess opened the door and wasn't pleased to find Natalie standing there. When Nat asked to speak with Jessica alone, Viki expressed misgivings but Jess was adamant that she and Natalie needed to talk. After Viki headed downstairs to check on Bree, Jess demanded to know why Nat chose sex with Jared over loyalty to her family. Screaming, Jess asked Nat how she could look at Bree and explain that she and Jared were responsible for taking Nash away from her. Jess accused Jared of killing Nash. Nat told Jess that she and Jared never meant to hurt anyone, but Jess reminded her sister of the terror she reined on their family when she surfaced seven years earlier. When Jess asked Nat if sex with Jared was worth Nash's life, Natalie exclaimed, \"I love him.\" In a fit of rage, Jess slapped Natalie and demanded that she leave. Jess told Natalie, \"If you love him, I want nothing more to do with you!\" Before slamming the door in Nat's face, Jess said to stay away from her and her family. \n\n\nIn the kitchen, Viki found Todd upset and Bree with her face smeared with chocolate. Todd told Viki that he had some business to attend to. When Viki asked what was wrong, he stated that he needed to take care of something concerning Blair that Viki had been unable to help him with. Refusing to accept guilt for Todd's problems, Viki warned Todd not to make things worse than they already were. Before Viki could clean up Bree, Natalie ran downstairs in tears. As Viki comforted her daughter, Natalie told her mother that Jessica hated her and begged Viki to forgive her. Viki told Natalie that she loved her, but reminded Nat that the choices that she and Jared made had hurt many people. Natalie told Viki that they had their reasons for not telling the truth and informed Viki that the main reason was because of her. Natalie begged her mother to speak with Charlie, but Viki refused. Viki stated that she had Jessica and Bree to worry about. Viki went to check on Jess. Jess told Viki that she hated Natalie, Jared, and Charlie. As Viki held her, Jess sobbed and said that she didn't want Nash to be dead. \n\n\nIn the kitchen of La Boulaie, Starr became emotional when Blair, Addie, and Langston began discussing her pregnancy. Blair advised Starr that she needed to see a gynecologist immediately, but Starr was adamant that she didn't want to discuss the baby. Blair appeared concerned. Seconds later, a fist came through the glass on the kitchen door. Todd and a shady character entered the kitchen and demanded to speak with Blair. As Blair ran to get Shaun, Todd introduced everyone to his new friend, \"Keys.\" \"Keys\" stood toe to toe with Shaun-hardly appearing intimidated. Tossing the letter to the floor, Todd informed Blair that he was there to discuss her restraining order.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica is distraught from the loss of her husband. And she sets Natalie straight that she will never forgive her or Jared for what they did to Nash. Todd is staying at Viki's when he gets a restraining order to stay away from his family. Dorian tells Blair, Addie, Starr and Langston that now that she's bought out B.E., she is starting her own new company called Cramer Enterprises and wants them all to be her partners. None of them are impressed that she had to do what she did in order to take over the company nor do they want to be a part of it. Rex is distraught from being lied to and betrayed by both Charlie and Adriana and he goes to talk to Bo. He confirms that Bo is more a family member to him than anybody else he knows. Adriana confronts Dorian and tells her she is done with her, she can see right through everything Dorian has pulled since they first met, and she will never forgive Dorian for the schemes she has partaken in.",
