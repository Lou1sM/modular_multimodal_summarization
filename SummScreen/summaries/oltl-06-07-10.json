    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the church, Bo got upset because there was no rabbi and no Andrew to perform the marriage. David volunteered to marry Bo and Nora, but Bo thought he was joking. David explained that he was an ordained minister through the Church of Scientology because \"someone had to marry Tom and Katie.\" Bo didn't think Nora would like it, but David insisted that he could and wanted to, and that there was no one else present who could do it. Bo finally agreed, but made David promise not to wear an orange robe. Bo prayed that he wouldn't regret his decision.\n\n\nRight outside of Foxy Roxy's, Nora marveled at the sudden change in weather and even swore that she saw a rainbow. Viki told Nora that someone \"up there\" was looking out for Nora, and that many miracles had happened. As the women departed for the church, Viki looked up and thanked whoever was looking out for them.\n\n\nInside the church, Blair sang as Gigi, Jess, Natalie, and Viki walked down the aisle, each smiling at their guys. As Blair smiled at Elijah, Nora began to walk down the aisle. Once she was next to Bo, the couple complimented each other's outfits and said that the second time was the charm. Nora then started to get confused as to why Andrew and the rabbi weren't there. As Bo began to explain that there had been a slight change in plans, David entered in what he called the \"Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\" After being convinced that the marriage would be legal, Nora consented to David officiating the ceremony. As the ceremony began, the church doors banged open to reveal a gun-toting Clint.\n\n\nBo and Nora were under the impression that Clint had forgiven them. Clint insisted that he was pointing the gun at David because Clint found out that it was David who had made Kim leave Clint. Viki eventually succeeded in calming Clint down. Clint apologized for spoiling the wedding, and was convinced to stay for the ceremony. David continued with the ceremony to announce Jessica and Natalie, who read a poem, then said that Bo and Nora were going to say their own vows.\n\n\nNora explained that she didn't like to take unnecessary risks in life, but the biggest risk would be trying to live without Bo. Bo explained that any time he wasn't with Nora, he was restless. He realized that Nora always was, and always would be, his home. Matthew walked up to his parents with the rings. The couple exchanged the rings and David pronounced them husband and wife. They kissed as everyone in the church stood and clapped.\n\n\nIntegrating some Jewish tradition, David covered a glass in a handkerchief and Bo stomped on it. The couple walked down the aisle through a shower of confetti and cheering. After the happy couple left, Rex offered Gigi a ride to the reception, which she happily accepted. Elijah complimented Blair on her beautiful voice, but Blair said that she was just saving everyone from Kelly's voice. Viki asked Clint if he was all right. Clint replied that he felt like a fool. Viki wondered if Clint was sure that Kim's leaving was David's fault, and if Clint had spoken to Kim lately. Clint informed Viki that Nigel, who he had gotten his information from, was no liar, and that he hadn't been able to find Kim.\n\n\nAs the party gradually moved to the reception hall at the Palace, Dani insisted on talking to Matthew. Matthew wanted to go to the Palace, but Dani stopped him by telling him that he meant a lot to her. She said that ever since he had helped her break out of the boarding school and they had flown to Seattle together, she knew they would be friends for a while. She admitted that she wasn't ready for a boyfriend. Matthew thought she was only saying that because he had told her that he loved her. He vowed that he didn't mean it, but Dani knew that he did, and said that she didn't know what love was. Matthew wanted to know what it was really about.\n\n\nMatthew didn't buy Dani's excuses for breaking up with him, and believed that she really wanted to be with Nate. Dani insisted that she and Nate were just friends, but Matthew wondered why they had kissed if they were just friends. Dani couldn't say anything else but that he meant a lot to her. An angry Matthew left the church to go to his parents' reception.\n\n\nAt the reception, Viki introduced, \"for the second time,\" Mr. and Mrs. Bo Buchanan. As their first dance, Bo and Nora did a choreographed routine to \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" by Sam and Dave. For the next dance, \"Reunited\" by Peaches and Herb, Viki implored everyone to join the newlyweds on the dance floor. David wanted to dance with Viki, but Charlie wouldn't let him. Slow dancing, Jessica again told Brody that she wouldn't blame him for running into the arms of another woman. Also slow dancing, Natalie thanked John for dancing with her because she knew it must be torture for him.\n\n\nBo and Nora wondered where Matthew was because it was almost time for the best man's toast. David said that the boy had probably sneaked off with Dani, and that it could be a while. Rex volunteered to give the toast, but David wanted to, since Bo was his father and not Rex's. Bo took David aside and told him that he did a very good job at the ceremony, but wanted to share a piece of Asa's advice -- \"quit while you're ahead.\" David offered Rex his Technicolor Dreamcoat, which Rex politely refused, in order to give the toast.\n\n\nAs John left Natalie to get drinks, Brody grabbed her and asked what they were going to do about Jessica and John. Natalie didn't want to lie, but also didn't want to tell Jessica and John the truth, to which Brody agreed. Jessica and John found the pair and wondered what \"secret deal\" they were making. Natalie lied that she had asked Brody to keep an eye on Clint, but John informed them that Clint was gone, so Brody was off the hook. Jessica told Brody to get some champagne because Rex was about to give the best man's toast in Matthew's absence.\n\n\nViki announced Rex and gave him the microphone. Rex explained that he had just found out he wasn't who he thought he was, and that he had been searching for his biological parents. However, even though he knew that he couldn't replace Matthew, he realized that he could stop looking for his parents because Bo was the only dad he'd ever need. He wished the couple lifelong happiness and hoped that everyone in attendance could be as lucky as the pair. Bo hugged Rex, and thanked David for letting Rex give the toast. David didn't mind because Rex was like a son to Bo. Bo said that David was, too, to a beaming David.\n\n\nBo and Nora then cut the cake. Nora threw her bouquet, which Destiny caught. Bo took Nora's garter off, and she warned him to be careful because of his gunshot wound. Bo threw the garter, which Darren caught. As Darren put the garter on Destiny, she warned him to be careful. He assured her that he hadn't been shot, but Shaun assured him that he hadn't been shot yet.\n\n\nKelly begged David for help with distracting Shaun because she and Reed wanted to leave for a nightcap. David agreed and asked Shaun for advice about women. David gave Kelly the all-clear and she and Reed left. Noticing that Kelly and Reed were gone, Shaun asked Blair and Elijah if they had seen her. They hadn't noticed where she had gone, and decide to leave themselves.\n\n\nMatthew arrived, and Destiny asked him if he was okay. He confessed that Dani had dumped him. Destiny apologized and said that it was Dani's loss. Matthew thought that he got what he deserved. He explained to a confused Destiny that he had done the exact same thing to Destiny. \"No problem,\" said Destiny as Darren entered. He wanted to dance, but Destiny said she couldn't. Matthew insisted that he would be all right, so Destiny left with Darren.\n\n\nAs Viki and Charlie left, Jessica and Brody decided to leave as well. Brody told Jessica he had a surprise for her, but she wanted to say goodbye to Natalie first. Noticing that Natalie looked busy with John, she agreed to leave. Natalie related to John that she couldn't believe all that had happened that day, and thought it was weird to be back with him. John wondered if that was good or bad. Natalie said it was a good thing, and the two shared a kiss.\n\n\nBo and Nora found Matthew and asked if he had been with Dani. Noticing that he was upset, Nora asked if he was all right. Matthew lied that he was just upset that he couldn't give the toast. However, he picked up a glass of soda and spoke just to them about how he was so happy that they were back together. He said that he had the best parents in the world and that he hoped they had a good time on their honeymoon. He hugged his parents and walked away to, as Nora assumed, meet up with Dani. Nora wondered how she and Bo were so lucky and kissed her new husband.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Nora's wedding goes off without a hitch, despite all the obstacles. David performs the ceremony to everybody's surprise with the \"credentials\" he's achieved in Hollywood to be an ordained minister. Matthew, however, is devastated and not in good spirits when Dani informs him she is not \"ready\" to have a boyfriend. He suspects she's just using that as an excuse because she's interested in Nate. Natalie, Jessica, Brody and John are all ok in their relationships. Rex and Gigi are happy. Viki is the MC at the wedding reception. Clint finds out that David wanted to delay his marriage to Kimberly and takes a shotgun to David but decides not to go through with it.",
