John noted that he wasn't surprised to find Todd in the middle of things, and John made a phone call in an attempt to find out about a flight plan and destination of the airplane. The man with Todd's original face continued to hide as he listened to the exchange between John and Todd.\n\n\nJohn tried to question Todd about Marty's whereabouts, but Todd denied that he knew about anything concerning Marty. Todd recalled the promise he'd made to Marty about disclosing the truth to John regarding Liam. John accused Todd of hiding Marty and helping her to escape, and Todd wondered why John was so keen on locating Marty. \"Let her go, and I'll make it worth your while,\" Todd offered. John accused Todd with trying to pay him off.\n\n\nJohn only wanted to know where Marty had gone, and he dangled a pair of handcuffs. Todd declared that he had seen Marty leave his pool house, and he had run after her. He had only watched as the plane had taken off. John thought that the CIA might be able to help him in his search, but Todd suggested that John forget about Marty. She would no longer be a problem. John related the murder, assault, and kidnapping charges that Marty faced, but Todd blamed John for driving Marty crazy.\n\n\nJohn grew angry and reminded Todd that Todd had started things off when he'd raped Marty in college and had never helped her. Todd still thought it was better that Marty had gotten away. John's anger increased as he yelled that Marty was \"over the edge.\" She would still have problems, and whoever would be with Marty would be the one having to pay for it. John wondered how Todd would feel if it were Todd's child that Marty kidnapped the next time. Todd replied that he had something to tell John.\n\n\n\"I really like your hair,\" Todd maintained. \"You're a funny guy,\" John replied. John had heard enough, and he announced that he was arresting Todd for aiding and abetting a fugitive. He read Todd his rights as he placed the cuffs on Todd's wrists. The man with Todd's original face lurked nearby and listened to the exchange. After John and Todd left, the man was confused. \"What the hell is going on?\" he muttered. \"If that guy is Todd Manning, then who the hell am I?\"\n\n\nFord showed up at St. Ann's with Ryder in tow. He requested permission to see Tess, though he nervously eyed a flyer that contained a photo of himself with a note that he was banned from the premises. The nun sitting behind the desk thought that Ford looked familiar, but Ford assured her that he was Tess's husband, Cutter Wentworth. The nun allowed him to visit Tess, who was in the sitting room.\n\n\nTess was annoyed and rude to Ford when she saw him, but she changed her tone after Ford admitted that he didn't want to see her in pain after all she'd been through. Tess wondered why Ford was there with the baby, and he revealed that Aubrey had given him some time to be with his son. Ford hadn't gone to the judge for custody, and he wasn't there to break Tess out. Tess ordered him to leave. Ford had something to say first. Tess did, too, and they argued over who should start.\n\n\nOut at the desk, the nun found her glasses and picked up the flyer with Ford's photo. She hurriedly made a phone call.\n\n\nJoey showed up at the police station, anxious to file a report against Ford for kidnapping Ryder. Aubrey rushed alongside her husband, doing her best to try to convince him that the charge wasn't necessary. She was certain that Ford wouldn't just take off. \"His life is here,\" Aubrey insisted. Joey was determined to press charges against Ford, but the couple stopped in their tracks as the cop on the phone motioned to them to wait. The cop mentioned Ford's name to the person on the other end.\n\n\nAs Cutter pranced through the Buchanan mansion in a wet Speedo, Nigel suggested that his new employer wear a towel. Cutter declared that he preferred to \"air dry,\" but Nigel thought he might have to end his employment. Cutter urged him to stay, proclaiming that it would be fun. Just then, the doorbell rang, and it was Vimal. He held a huge bouquet of flowers for his wife, and he was there to see Rama. He was confused to hear that Cutter was the new \"master of the house,\" and Vimal's head spun after hearing about the latest goings-on in the Buchanan family, and the fact that Cutter and Aubrey weren't siblings.\n\n\nCutter pointed out that Rama had been busy, hence the lack of communication, though Vimal angrily stated that he had been the one to ask Rama to cut back on her prison visits. Vimal added that Rama and he would be moving on to their own place. Cutter made a sarcastic comment about Rama paying rent through her belly dancing moves, and Vimal was livid.\n\n\nAt the gym, Cristian and Rama shared a kiss, and finally, they separated awkwardly. Rama thought that it was inappropriate, while Cristian called it amazing. Rama declared that she was married, and it was wrong, though Cristian assured her that it would never have happened if Vimal had been around. Rama assured him that while she and Cristian liked each other, she loved her husband.\n\n\nCristian wasn't happy with his behavior. He recalled making a promise to Vimal to look after Rama, and he thought that he and Rama should have a talk. Rama wanted to leave, though she kissed Cristian again before she headed out the door. Blair had been watching from across the room, and she gently chided Cristian on his public affair. She told him that everyone had seen him kissing Rama, and Blair thought it was kind of tasteless.\n\n\nCristian assured her that he wasn't having an affair, and it had just been a kiss. Blair stated that while she wasn't one to judge Cristian, she had to advise him that Vimal's attorney was T\u00e9a. Blair was certain that Vimal would be released from prison soon, and she ordered Cristian to take it easy. Cristian maintained that it had just been a \"weird moment.\"\n\n\nBlair was sorry that Rama was married, as it appeared that Rama had helped to revive Cristian after his breakup with Layla. Blair didn't want to see Cristian get hurt. The television played in the background, and Blair stopped to listen. She learned that Tomas had found baby Liam on the Manning property.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Tomas tried to track Todd down without success. T\u00e9a wondered what Tomas was up to, and she had lots of questions for Tomas. She wondered why her brother was so anxious to speak to Todd, and she inquired about what had been going on in the pool house. Tomas claimed that he'd walked by the building and had heard the baby crying.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked if her husband was with Marty, but Tomas advised her that he had no clue as to where Todd might be. T\u00e9a had been unable to locate her husband, and she was worried that he might be in trouble if he were with Marty, because Marty had a gun. Tomas reminded her that the gun had been found in the pool house when the police had arrived, and there was no need for T\u00e9a to worry.\n\n\nT\u00e9a announced that while she'd defended Tomas to the cops, that didn't mean that she believed what he said. T\u00e9a recalled that she'd wanted to go for a swim the previous evening, but Todd had gone out of his way to prevent her from doing so. She added that Tomas and Todd had grown into \"buds,\" and she assumed that if Todd knew something, then so did Tomas. T\u00e9a believed both men were lying.\n\n\nAs Natalie held her newly found son in her arms, Brody leaned over to kiss Natalie as she lay in her hospital bed. Afterwards, Brody suggested that they talk about it, because it hadn't been the first time that a kiss had occurred between them. Natalie preferred to forget about it, but Brody couldn't. \"It's time for the truth. How I feel about you,\" he stated.\n\n\nBrody admitted that he didn't know how it had happened, but things had changed between them. Natalie agreed that she cared about Brody too. Brody wondered what the next step would be, and if that meant things had to change. Natalie replied, \"Right now, it works. We work, don't we?\" Brody agreed that they did. \"Why mess things up?\" Natalie asked. She was aware that Brody loved Jessica, and her sister was at St. Ann's getting better. Brody declared that he wasn't certain that he had a life with Jessica in the future.\n\n\nBrody explained that Jessica hadn't been around for a while, and it didn't seem as though she were fighting to get back. Bess had told them that Jessica had nothing to say to them, and perhaps they had hurt Jessica too much. Natalie didn't believe that her sister would want revenge, and Jessica had to get well. Brody consented to not give up on Jessica as long as Natalie didn't give up on John.\n\n\nNatalie clarified that John had given up on her, and if she believed in a chance with John, she wouldn't have to act on her feelings for Brody. She declared that she and John had finally figured out how to be civil to each other. Brody felt that he owed John a lot for returning the baby, and Brody just wanted Natalie to be happy. The couple agreed to take shifts on watching Liam, and Brody headed to the station.\n\n\nVimal announced that his wife was pregnant and could hardly be belly dancing. Cutter had offended Vimal with the remark, Vimal stated. Cutter denied that Rama was pregnant, but just then Rama arrived home. She was thrilled to see her husband, and they wrapped their arms around each other. She thought it was a miracle that Vimal was home. Vimal revealed that he had been released and the charges dropped.\n\n\nCutter wasn't finished, and he noted that while Rama had sadly whiled away the hours in her room during Vimal's absence, she'd also managed to have a little fun. Vimal assured his wife that she no longer had to live in the mansion. He also noted that Cutter had stated that Rama wasn't pregnant. \"As if you could lie to me about something like that,\" Vimal proclaimed. He believed that Cutter had \"no idea what life is like with an honest woman like you,\" Vimal informed Rama. Cutter and Rama exchanged looks behind Vimal's back.\n\n\nRama insisted that she was pregnant, and she was very tired. She asked Vimal to fetch her a cold drink with ice. Once Vimal left the room, Rama turned on Cutter. \"You slimy little mongoose,\" she shouted at him. She berated Cutter for opening his mouth, and she threatened to tell everyone what she knew. Cutter's life would \"come crashing down over his head\" if he wasn't able to keep up with all of the facts. Nigel was pursuing his work and overheard Rama's threats.\n\n\n\"I have your back, kid,\" Cutter replied. He had found it difficult to keep up with all of Rama's lies. Vimal returned to Rama, and Cutter left to find Nigel. The butler announced that he planned to stay on to work for Cutter, and he advised Cutter that a masseuse was ready and waiting. Cutter was happy; he didn't know what he'd do without Nigel. Once Cutter left, Nigel promised that Cutter would find out once Nigel put information together for the Buchanans' use.\n\n\nVimal had crackers and water for his wife. He wondered why her belly hadn't grown. Rama assured him that it would \"pop\" out eventually. Vimal vowed to be by her side every minute, even during the scheduled amniocentesis. Rama began to choke.\n\n\nFord admitted to Tess that he wanted to talk about the two of them. He began to say that he'd finally realized something. He was interrupted when Joey and Aubrey stormed in with the nun. Ford indignantly announced that he'd had a deal with Aubrey, but Joey retorted that it hadn't been a deal with him. Suddenly, Tess assured Joey that it was all okay. \"It's me,\" Tess announced. She was Jessica.\n\n\nThe nun raced off to get the doctor. Tess explained that she'd seen Ryder, and that had helped Jessica to return. She was grateful to Aubrey and Joey for looking after her son, but she was ready to go home. Joey thought that was wonderful, and he offered to make Jessica a \"Joey special\" after they got home. He asked her to remind him of the ingredients.\n\n\nTess bluffed, but Joey asked for a reminder. Tess finally maintained that a little pineapple juice was needed, but Joey had caught her. He announced that his special was a sandwich. \"Nice try, Tess,\" Joey said. He took the baby, and Ford stated that he was leaving. Tess yelled at him to tell her what he'd started to say, but he promised to return.\n\n\nTodd and John arrived at the police station, and Todd announced that he had his phone call to make. John learned that no one had seen a plane or knew anything about a flight plan of any plane. It appeared as though the plane hadn't even existed. \"Book him anyway,\" Todd advised the police officer who had delivered the news. Todd called his wife and advised T\u00e9a that he'd been arrested.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived and angrily advised Todd that the district attorney was charging him as an accessory to Marty's crimes. \"You mean like a scarf?\" Todd asked. He claimed that he was being railroaded. T\u00e9a reminded Todd that Marty had been on their property, though Todd insisted that he hadn't seen Marty prior to that day. T\u00e9a frowned. She informed Todd that John had evidence, but Todd assured her that John had nothing, and he never would.\n\n\nAt the gym, Cristian lifted weights and continued to think about Rama.\n\n\nBlair showed up at Todd's house and gave Tomas a passionate kiss.\n\n\nNatalie held her son and spoke softly to him. She had missed him, and so had his daddy. \"Daddy will be here any minute,\" she assured him. John walked in and smiled timidly.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie and Brody are dancing around confirming the feelings they have for each other. Cristian and Rama have a similar situation although she is married and they both know it is not the right thing to do. Robert Ford and Tess have a similar situation when he surprises her at St. Anne's by brining baby Ryder to see her. Before they can talk, however, Joey and Aubrey enter after calling the cops on Robert afraid that he will take the baby and run. Todd and Tomas help Marty board her plane before the cops catch her. John tells Todd he knows that he did it although he has no proof and arrests Todd for suspicion. Tea also has no proof but grills her husband and brother urging them to come clean. Meanwhile, original Todd watches them unseen and wonders why \"this guy\" is Todd Manning and if that be the case, then who is he? While Cutter has taken \"ownership\" of Clint's home, Vimal comes to see Rama and wonders how it is that Joey's wife's brother would have married Jessica when he thought she was married to Robert Ford.
