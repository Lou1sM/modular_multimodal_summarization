    "tvmega_recap": "Blair sits by Todd's bedside and tries to persuade him to open his eyes, and talk to her. She wants to know where she stands with him. Starr visits him and gives him back his wedding ring. Blair tries to coax him to put it back on, and let them be a family again, but Todd refuses. Vangie and Cris have a confrontation with Vincent. Vincent lets Cris know that he owns him now. Vincent tells his goon to take care of Vangie while he and Cris go to the gym. Cris raises objections, but Vangie talks him into doing as Vincent says. Nash and Claudia visit her father. An argument erupts. Nash gets a call from Jessica to tell him that the paternity test shows that he is the father of the baby. Jessica deals with the news particularly well. She decides that Nash has to know right away that the baby is his. Antonio is not phased by the results. He has Jessica back and he will not lose her again. He will raise Brennan like he has been raising Jamie and it will not be an issue. Of this he is sure. Starr comes to see her father for the first time since he has been awake. \"I knew that you would come back to me,\" she says. She hands him his wedding ring. \"I saved it for you.\" Blair tells Starr that she has to head home now. Starr leaves. \"Put it on Todd I love you and I know that we can be a family again.\" She reaches for his arm but he pulls it away. \"No we can't!\" Nash gets a call from Jessica who tells that the baby is his. He is happy that she has called him but sad to hear that Tess is gone. \"I want you to know that we will be raising this baby,\" she tells. Nash thanks her for calling and then hangs up. A few minutes later, he calls Clint. \"I will be back for my daughter. You can't really think that Antonio is the best thing for her.\" Blair watches as Todd talks with Evangeline through the glass window to his room. She makes a call. \"I need to talk to you. I am putting my family back together and I am going to need your help to do that.",
