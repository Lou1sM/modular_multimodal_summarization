Pointing out that Jessica was in a fragile state, Clint worried that Brody might upset her. Assuring Clint that Brody loved Jessica, Viki was certain that Brody was the one person who could help Jessica get over the loss of her child. Clint didn't want to leave Viki alone, but Viki informed him that Charlie was due home shortly. When Clint mentioned that he was going home to Nora, Viki asked him to open up to Nora concerning the loss of Chloe. Viki warned Clint not to shut Nora out while he grieved the loss of Jessica's baby. \n\n\nLater, Charlie arrived home and found Viki in a depressed state. Viki told Charlie that she felt responsible for Jessica losing the baby. Viki regretted leaving town after Nash's death. Viki was certain that she would have realized that Tess had surfaced. Reminding Viki that she had always been a support system for Jessica, Charlie told Viki that she had no reason to blame herself. \n\n\nPresenting her with a ring, Charlie asked a shocked Viki to marry him. Viki accepted Charlie's proposal and the two shared an embrace. Staring at her ring, Viki told Charlie that she hoped Jessica would find a guy to love who was as wonderful as Charlie. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Jessica blamed herself for causing misery to so many people and asked Brody to leave her alone. Brody tried to convince Jessica that Tess was responsible for what had happened, but Jessica refused to listen. Jessica insisted that her baby had died because she had failed to see her doctor on a regular basis during her pregnancy. Declaring his love for her, Brody told Jessica that he intended to stand by her side and help her through the crisis. As a distraught Jessica reminisced about her short time with Chloe, Brody held her in his arms. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora and Rachel discussed Nora and Clint's upcoming nuptials. Upon learning that Nora hadn't mentioned Clint's proposal to Matthew, Rachel wondered if her mother still had feelings for Bo. Nora was adamant that she wanted to marry Clint. As Nora tried her best to convince Rachel that she only had eyes for Clint, Nora was startled when Clint entered the room and questioned what was going on. \n\n\nAlone with Clint, Nora asked about Jessica's state, but Clint refused to talk about it. Instead, Clint announced that he wanted to set a wedding date. Stunned, Nora questioned whether the time was right. As Nora made excuses, Clint wondered if she felt pressured. Nora hesitated for a brief moment, and then agreed to set a date. Insisting that he wanted to get married immediately, Clint suggested that they elope the next day. Nora agreed. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Bo asked John to reconsider returning to the Llanview Police Department and offered him the position of Chief of Detectives. Stating that he was tired of the politics that came along with the job, John declined Bo's offer. Reminding John that his investigative skills were a gift, Bo pleaded with him to change his mind. John promised to think about returning to the LPD. \n\n\nInforming John that he intended to throw Clint a party in celebration of his upcoming wedding, Bo asked John if he could rent the restaurant for the big event. John wondered how Bo felt about Clint marrying Nora. Bo claimed that he didn't mind that his ex-wife and brother were engaged to be married. \n\n\nBack at the Buchanan mansion, Bo entered the room as Nora stared at a photo of Bo, Matthew, and herself. Bo and Nora smiled at each other. Afterward, Nora smiled as she continued staring at the photo. \n\n\nInside their apartment at the Angel Square Hotel, Michael asked Marcie to marry him. Michael insisted that they had so much to be thankful for w- their relationship was stronger than ever and they had a new baby. Citing that they were on the verge of a new beginning, Michael said that he thought it was important that they renewed their wedding vows. Eager to start over, Marcie agreed to marry Michael again. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr told Cole that the adoption wasn't official because she hadn't signed the adoption papers. Before Starr and Cole could discuss the matter any further, Marty interrupted with news that Todd and Blair had returned with Hope. Starr cried as Blair placed Hope in her arms. Realizing that Cole was nervous, Starr suggested that he hold his daughter. As she watched Cole enjoy time with Hope, Starr looked sad when she glanced over at the unsigned adoption papers. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Todd phoned Michael and told him that Hope was at La Boulaie. Michael and Marcie headed over to La Boulaie to pick up Hope. After hanging up with Michael, Todd watched as Starr and Cole bonded with their daughter. \n\n\nThe mood was somber when Michael and Marcie arrived at La Boulaie. Todd, Blair, and Marty watched as Starr and Cole handed the child over to Marcie. Starr announced that the adoption wouldn't be finalized until she signed the adoption papers. As Starr prepared to sign the papers, Blair stopped her and suggested that Starr give the decision more thought. Dismissing her mother's plea, Starr signed the papers with great sadness. \n\n\nHolding Hope, Marcie suggested that Starr take a lock of Hope's hair to place in her locket. Cole gave Marcie his father's book of poems and requested that the new parents read the poems to Hope. Thanking Starr for making the ultimate sacrifice, Marcie promised that she and Michael would be great parents to Hope. Unable to remain strong any longer, Starr politely suggested that the McBains leave. As she walked away with Hope, Marcie looked back at the child's devastated parents. \n\n\nAlone, Cole and Starr sat in silence. \n\n\nOut in the foyer, Blair and Todd walked Marty to the door. As she left, Marty told Blair that they would all remember that dreadful day forever. Afterward, Blair thanked Todd for being supportive of Starr. They discussed their beautiful granddaughter and shared a hug. \n\n\nStarr told Cole that she wished that she could have spent more time with Hope. Placing the locket around Starr's neck, Cole told her that Hope would always be close to Starr's heart. \n\n\nBack at the Angel Square Hotel, Marcie and Michael enjoyed time with Hope. They told the child that she was at home and had everything that she could possibly need. \n\n\nMarty paid John a visit at Rodi's. Marty told John that Cole was having trouble dealing with Hope's adoption. Realizing that Marty was troubled, John held her in his arms.\n\n\n",
