Shane admitted that he had started it, after he'd dropped a weight on Jack's foot. Rex gave his son a sign of approval behind Gigi's back, because she wasn't happy that the situation had occurred. Rex thought that maybe it would be the end of the Jack and Shane feud, but Gigi doubted it. Shane knew that Jack wouldn't forget what had happened at the gym, but Shane wasn't worried about it.\n\n\n\"It's not like before,\" Shane admitted. There was no need to worry, because he had changed, and he would be able to handle Jack, Shane told his parents. He'd been undergoing counseling, and he'd started at the gym. Shane headed upstairs to download some music on his computer, courtesy of a gift card that his grandmother had given him. Gigi reminded him that he wasn't to access MyFace.\n\n\nOnce Shane was gone, Gigi expressed her concern that Shane could be involved with a dangerous sociopath, and she didn't want Shane to turn into a bully either. She was also worried that her son's bravado was an act. Rex assured her that there was nothing to worry about, and he was certain that Shane wouldn't be a bully, because Shane had lots of heart. Gigi was also worried about Rex, because she could tell that something wasn't quite right.\n\n\nRex told her about his run-in with Clint at the hospital, and the fact that the monitors had gone off after he'd told Clint to die. The staff had saved Clint, but his heart was giving out. Rex also informed Gigi about Matthew's condition. The teen had a brain injury and was alive only because of the machines. Rex felt that when he looked into Bo's eyes, he saw the hollow look of a soldier, and he hadn't known what to say to Bo. Gigi tearfully exclaimed how lucky their family was, and Rex promised to never take them for granted.\n\n\nGigi suggested that they change their wedding plans, but Rex refused. He thought it was too important, and he wanted something special to happen. Gigi knew that Shane would be proud to stand up for Rex, though Rex announced that he was proud of Shane for standing up for himself.\n\n\nBrad showed up at Llanfair with his laptop, and Jack filled him in on Jack's latest plan to get back at Shane. Jack thought he had an evil plan that would leave no fingerprints, and he couldn't wait to put it into effect. He updated Brad on the plan, and Brad agreed that it was a good one.\n\n\nUpstairs at the carriage house and on the computer, Shane received a notification that he had a new email on MyFace. He decided that he wasn't technically on the social network, so he opened the email. It was from a girl named Comicgirl15, and she told him that she'd seen his comic books at a convention, and she wanted to be friends. Shane decided to reply to her.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brad and Jack were excited to see that Shane \"took the bait.\" Brad was concerned that his computer might be traced, but Jack assured him that it wasn't possible. Jack was proud of himself for downloading a girl's photo from a magazine. They continued to have a chat with Shane about comic books, though Brad had to research information quickly. Jack, as the girl, chatted with Shane about the Y-Girls comics. Shane stated they were his favorite. Jack couldn't wait to put \"phase two\" into action.\n\n\nStarr visited James and explained that she needed to see him before dealing with her father's latest escapade. Also, Starr had just returned from a visit to Statesville with Hope in tow, but she would have to return to inform Cole about his mother's departure. Starr remarked how happy Cole and Hope had been to see each other, but Starr was concerned. Starr had realized that Hope had been calling for her father after a recent nightmare, and Hope had thrown a tantrum when she'd had to say goodbye to Cole at the prison. With Marty gone, Starr would be the one responsible to take Hope to see Cole.\n\n\nJames blamed himself for Hope's behavior, because he was the new factor in Starr's life, and he took Starr's time away from Hope. He suggested that the three of them do things together, like go to the zoo or the park or even a show. Starr thought that was a great idea, and she was pleased that Hope would still be able to visit Cole, even as she saw her mom with another guy. James promised to always make Hope feel safe around him, because he wanted a long relationship with both Hope and Starr.\n\n\nJames suggested a picnic, and the couple recalled the last time they'd attempted to have one, without food. Starr felt lucky that James understood what she was going through, and even wanted to do something about it. Any other guy would have run off, Starr declared. She was looking forward to having her special night with James.\n\n\n\"You're a hero,\" Blair told Tomas after she'd kissed him passionately at Todd's house. He had found Natalie's baby. Tomas denied that he was a hero, though Blair advised him, \"Every girl needs a hero.\" She didn't want Tomas to spoil things for her. Tomas emphasized that Marty had already been gone when he'd found the baby, though privately, he recalled the actual chain of events.\n\n\nBlair noted that she'd heard that Todd might have been involved with the baby's kidnapping, and she couldn't understand why. She wondered what Tomas thought, and she asked if Marty had been at the pool house all along. Tomas didn't think that Todd had planned anything, but Blair explained that she was concerned with Jack and his reaction to it all. Things had grown worse with her son's attitude, Blair added.\n\n\nBlair enlightened Tomas on Jack's latest lie, which consisted of lying about going to the library, so that he might find Shane at the gym. Surprisingly, Jack had been the one to get hurt when Shane had \"accidentally on purpose\" dropped a weight on Jack's foot. Blair confessed that she was glad that Jack had been hurt, and she wondered what kind of mother that made her. She wasn't able to trust Jack with all of his lies.\n\n\nBlair was hopeful that Todd would be able to spend more time talking to Jack, but she was afraid that Todd would end up in prison. Blair suddenly felt tired and tearful, and while Tomas was sorry, Blair decided to stop trying to look for pity over her son. She could handle him, she declared. Tomas promised to help her in any way that he could. Blair assured him that she usually didn't cry in front of anyone, and Tomas was happy to hear that he wasn't just anyone.\n\n\nWhen Blair went off to freshen up, Tomas received a phone call. \"What do you want?\" he asked the caller. Blair returned and curiously asked about the call. Tomas announced that he had a last-minute appointment in New York with a gallery owner, and he had to leave. He owed her a date. Blair thanked him for allowing her to cry on his shoulder, and she vowed not to make it a habit. She looked thoughtful as she left.\n\n\nAt the police station, Todd complained that his wrists were hurting from the handcuffs, but T\u00e9a preferred that he tell her what he was hiding from her instead. Todd mentioned that it had to do with Liam, but just then, Brody walked in and wondered what they were talking about. Todd stated that they'd been referring to Liam's being back with his mother. Brody declared that he and Natalie were happy, and he couldn't stop to think about what could have happened to his son. \"A lot can happen that you don't expect,\" Todd stated ominously.\n\n\n\"Thank god Liam is back with his parents,\" T\u00e9a stated. \"Except he's not,\" Todd proclaimed. T\u00e9a was confused, but Brody explained that Todd meant that John and Natalie were supposed to have been the boy's parents. \"Oh, is that what you meant?\" T\u00e9a asked her husband. T\u00e9a was suspicious of Todd's show of compassion for John, because Todd hated John. Todd agreed that he did hate John, but John shouldn't have lost his son.\n\n\nBrody agreed with Todd, because he knew exactly how John felt, having been in the same situation as John. Brody had lost Ryder, but he had been able to welcome his second chance with Liam. The boy meant everything to him, and if Liam had been lost, he didn't know what he would have done. T\u00e9a was just happy that it had all ended well. Brody wanted to leave for the hospital, and Todd asked him to remove the cuffs.\n\n\nBrody confessed that he couldn't help out, and it was all up to John. Brody revealed that if he had met with Marty in person, he wasn't sure what he would have done, and she was lucky that he hadn't seen her.\n\n\nNatalie wasn't sure how to thank John for returning her son, when John paid her a visit at the hospital. John noted that it was his job, and he was only sorry that it had taken so long. Natalie ordered John to stop apologizing, because she and Brody owed John a lot. John divulged that Marty had gotten away, and they'd found the baby with Tomas. Marty had flown off on a private jet, but the police didn't have any details.\n\n\nJohn added that he had found Todd at the airstrip, and John wondered if that had been a mere coincidence. Natalie was curious as to why Todd might have helped Marty, and John reported that he'd taken Todd to the police station for questioning. Natalie didn't feel safe, knowing that Marty was still out and about, but John promised that Marty would only return in handcuffs. He believed that Marty was across the Atlantic without a return trip even planned, and he had the international authorities on the lookout for her.\n\n\n\"Because it's your job,\" Natalie commented. John nodded and added, \"I owe it to you.\" John clarified that Brody had blamed him for all that Marty had done, but Natalie denied that was true. John believed that he should have seen the signs, but his judgment had been clouded due to circumstances. John admitted that he hadn't been himself, but he had thought he could learn why Marty had taken credit for breaking up Natalie and John.\n\n\nNatalie wondered if that could be true, and she asked if that might have made a difference in their relationship. She wondered if she and John might have been able to start over. Natalie recalled that she'd been the one to lie to John about being Liam's father. \"It's done now. Let it go,\" John urged her. Natalie cited the tape that she'd had, and the confrontation she'd had with Marty about the tape. Natalie couldn't remember what was on it, but she'd hoped. Suddenly, she stopped short.\n\n\n\"What?\" John asked. \"Forget it,\" Natalie replied. She figured they had different reasons for what they hoped for, and John asked what Natalie's desire was. Natalie confessed that she'd wanted the truth to \"bring us back together.\"  John wanted to return to the station, and Natalie insisted on thanking him one more time. Liam began to fuss, and Natalie looked around for his pacifier. John located it, and as he handed it to her, their hands touched. \"In a different world this would just be another moment in our day of us taking care of our son,\" Natalie stated tearfully.\n\n\nAs Natalie wiped her tears, Brody arrived. It was obvious to him that he had interrupted something, and he inquired about it. Natalie turned away. \"No, it was nothing,\" she said. John left, but slowed down to look through the window of Natalie's room. Brody informed Natalie that Todd was being held in connection with Marty's disappearance. Natalie mentioned the missing tape and the fact that she couldn't remember anything. \"Maybe it doesn't matter,\" Brody said.\n\n\nAfter playing along on the chat, Shane paused. He was aware of who he was dealing with. There was no such thing as Y-Girls, Shane declared. He'd made it up, just as he knew that Jack had made up the girl who was chatting with him. Shane vowed to have the last laugh.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wanted to plan a strategy with Todd, but she could tell that something was still bothering him. She was distracted when John arrived and announced that Todd would be spending the night. T\u00e9a opposed, citing that Todd had not been charged with anything. John reminded her that he was able to hold Todd for 48 hours. He thought that Todd might be more inclined to talk after that. \"Maybe I'll be more inclined to talk. Maybe not,\" Todd proclaimed as a police officer led him away.\n\n\n",
