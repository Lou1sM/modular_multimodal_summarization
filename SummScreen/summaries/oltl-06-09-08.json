    "soap_central": "\nTHE HONEYMOON'S OVER\n\n\nWhen Rex returned to the loft, Adriana was anxious to leave for their honeymoon destination. She was caught completely by surprise when Rex informed her that the honeymoon was off. Rex said that the marriage had been a mistake and he wanted to end it. Adriana was amazed that Rex would consider leaving her over one mistake, but Rex assured her that he had other reasons. Adriana claimed that the only reason she brought Brody to Llanview was because she wanted to guarantee that her marriage to Rex would take place and blamed Gigi for confusing Rex. Rex disagreed with Adriana's logic, and believed her actions were a result of her lack of trust in him. Near tears, Rex stated that he didn't feel that he could be happy with her. As Adriana wept, Rex said that he wished that he had stopped her when she began making wedding plans so quickly. Rex explained that perhaps he didn't want to face the truth-that he was afraid of marriage. Rex stated that the marriage started out wrong and he didn't see another way, but Adriana had a suggestion. \n\n\nLangston knocked on Dorian's bedroom door and found her foster mother in low spirits. A saddened Dorian told Langston that she didn't believe Adriana would ever forgive her. After much urging from Langston, Dorian admitted to making every attempt to prevent Adriana from marrying Rex. Langston was understanding of Dorian's plight and the two had a heart-to-heart talk. Langston suggested that Dorian allow her loved ones to make their own mistakes and learn from them. Dorian expressed her need to take care of her \"girls,\" but listened intently as Langston politely explained that perhaps Dorian's \"girls\" viewed her caring as extreme interference. After Langston enlightened Dorian about her experiences with her own mother, Langston thanked Dorian for all she had done for her and assured her that Adriana would eventually forgive her. Langston's words of wisdom left Dorian in a better mood. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Todd broke into the house while his bodyguard, \"Keys,\" strong-armed Shaun. As Blair called the police, Todd pleaded with Starr to speak with him. Blair demanded that Todd leave, but Starr informed Blair that she had a few words for him. With a sly smile, Todd attempted to make Starr feel guilty about his situation. He blamed Blair and Cole for brainwashing Starr and turning her against him. Fed up with her father, Starr lashed out at him. Starr told Todd that he had caused his own problems and ordered him out of the house. An agitated Todd and his bodyguard left La Boulaie. \n\n\nLater, Starr expressed to Blair the anger she had towards her father. Blair complimented Starr about the bravery she displayed by standing up to Todd. Distraught, Starr told her mother that she didn't feel brave. Starr revealed that she felt trapped and didn't know if she were ready to be a mother. \n\n\nIn her Angel Square apartment, Marcie stared intently at a picture of Tommy. When Michael entered the room, Marcie quickly hid the photograph. As Michael prepared to leave for the hospital, Marcie passionately kissed him and suggested he consider arriving a few hours late for work. After making love, Michael wondered what had put Marcie in the mood for romance. Marcie said that she had realized what was important-Nash's sudden death had opened her eyes. Marcie told Michael that she wouldn't know what to do if she ever lost him, and Mike assured her that she never would. Some time later, Michael was surprised to find Todd and Keys outside of his apartment door. Todd informed Michael and Marcie that Blair had placed a restraining order against him; he felt they were to blame for Sam being taken away from him. When Todd threatened to have Keys physically harm Michael, Mike responded by threatening to kill both Keys and Todd with a strategic maneuver. Todd promised Mike and Marcie that if he didn't receive custody of Sam at the permanent placement hearing, they would die. Mike slammed the door in Todd's face. \n\n\nJared visited Charlie in his hospital room. Jared asked Charlie what he planned to say to Viki and Rex. Charlie was adamant that he would tell them both the truth, and hoped they would eventually forgive him just as Jared had. Jared began to blame himself for Charlie's troubles, but Charlie refused to allow Jared to accept any of the blame. Jared told Charlie that he needed to apologize to the Buchanan family. Before Jared left to face the music, Charlie suggested that his son take responsibility but not to allow anyone to walk over him. As Jared headed off, Charlie wished him well. \n\n\nNatalie paid Charlie a visit, and was nervous to learn that Jared had gone to the Buchanan Mansion to apologize. Natalie said that Jared should have allowed her to come with him, but Charlie felt that Jared needed to stand on his own-just as Charlie would need to do concerning Viki and Rex. Nat told Charlie that it would be awhile before Viki wanted to speak with him. Charlie understood; he said that his biggest problem would be explaining his drunken stupor to Viki. When Natalie asked him what he remembered, Charlie stated that something concerning that night just wasn't right. Charlie told Nat that in the past, he always remembered the events that led up to his first drink. Charlie was adamant that he had been sober. Charlie assured Nat that he hadn't had a blackout and the very last thing he remembered was being desperate to find Viki. Nat was certain that it would take a long time before Viki would allow either Natalie or Charlie back into her good graces. She was positive that Viki would never accept Natlie's relationship with Jared. Natalie prayed that Jared would be safe at the Buchanan Mansion. \n\n\nWhen Jared arrived at the Buchanan Mansion, Nigel was skeptical about his decision to face the family. Jared promised Nigel that he wouldn't reveal the truth about David, but Nigel felt that it might be time to tell the family that David was a Buchanan. Jared told Nigel to let him handle things, and made Nigel promise to keep quiet. \n\n\nMeanwhile, inside the living room, Clint, Bo, and Nora discussed Dorian's takeover of Buchanan Enterprises. Clint asked Nora if there were any possible way to nullify Dorian's purchasing of the BE shares. Nora promised to find a loophole somehow. Anger crossed the faces of everyone, as Jared entered the room. Clint threatened to physically harm Jared if he didn't leave, but Jared was determined to express his apologies to everyone. When Jared stated how happy he was to have been a part of the family, Nora angrily reminded him that he was never a Buchanan and had scammed his way into the family. Jared continued to apologize, but Clint told him that his actions had cost the family nearly everything. Realizing that his apology wasn't welcomed, Jared turned to leave but was greeted by Renee with a slap across the face. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki held a weeping Jessica. Viki told her daughter that she was mad as hell at the lies that Natalie, Jared, and Charlie had told. Viki and Jess both agreed that Nat was at the top of their \"anger\" list. Viki blamed herself for believing Charlie's lies. Jessica revealed to her mother that she felt bad that she was angry with Nash. Jessica broke down as she told Viki about how she planned to surprise Nash with news of her pregnancy. Jess hated that Bree would never know her father, and feared that the child would always associate her birthday with the day her father died. Viki reminded Jess that Kevin and Joey knew much about their biological father, Joe. Viki said she often thought about Joe, every time she looked at her sons. Viki assured Jess that her own children would help her keep Nash alive. The encouragement from her mother calmed Jess down.\n\n \n \n\n\n",

Blair and Starr are still wondering what would happen if he ever found out Starr was pregnant. Dorian and Langston discuss the boundaries and acceptable guidelines for Dorian being a mother to her. Langston confirms that she will not abandon Dorian even if Adriana has. Rex tells Adriana they are through. There's no way they can be married with all that has happened. She doesn't want to accept that, however. Viki admits to Jessica that she is just as angry with Natalie and Jared as Jessica is. Natalie talks privately to Charlie about all that has happened.
