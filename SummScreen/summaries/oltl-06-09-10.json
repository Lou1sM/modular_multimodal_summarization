    "soap_central": "\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian entered the drawing room with a tray of breakfast for herself and Langston, but Langston's attention was fixed on the latest Sun headline about Ford and Markko, \"the killer busboy.\"  Noticing the front page, Dorian clucked over the sad state of affairs; she felt bad for Markko, but she'd known all along her daughter wasn't capable of such a brutal assault.  \"You have no idea what I'm capable of,\" Langston snapped.  She reminded Dorian of how she'd cheated on Markko, how she'd lied and schemed to keep both him and Ford all the way to prom night.  Dorian insisted that Langston wasn't as terrible as she was making herself out to be, but Langston didn't want to hear it, and fled in the direction of the kitchen to head for school.\n\n\nBefore Dorian could follow her daughter, the doorbell rang.  Answering it, she found Aurelia Rivera, Markko's mother.  As Dorian struggled through a series of clumsy Spanish phrases, the fuming Aurelia slapped her across the face.  \"Shame on you!\" she snarled.\n\n\nRecovering, Dorian asked if she was expected to turn the other cheek, but Aurelia ignored her, and launched into a tirade about how Langston, who she called a \"lying slut,\" had ruined her son's life.  She blamed Dorian for not raising Langston properly and instilling her with good morals, and said that as a result, Langston had become a \"cheating whore\" who'd led Markko down a wayward path.  Angered, Dorian called Markko a \"violent punk\" who'd made his own mistakes.  Aurelia told Dorian that \"you people\" in the higher social class didn't understand the Riveras; the wealthy lived in their fancy houses and used people like the Riveras like servants, then discarded the poor people when they were done with them, just as Langston had used and abused Markko.  That was the last straw for Dorian, who warned Aurelia, \"Insult me but not my house!\"\n\n\nBefore Dorian and Aurelia could come to further blows, Charlie wandered up the drive, and was curious about the tense scene before him.  After Aurelia stormed off, Charlie explained that he was there to show Dorian the schematics for the new performing arts center.  Dorian, grateful to focus on something other than the strife with Markko and Langston, ushered him inside the house.  Charlie asked if she truly thought Markko was guilty of the assault on Ford, but Dorian was preoccupied with the fact that Aurelia blamed her parenting skills.  Charlie suggested that he should leave her to her thoughts, but Dorian asked him to stay.\n\n\nDorian told Charlie that her head was full of Aurelia's accusations, and she wondered if she truly had coddled Langston when she took the girl in.  Taking a different tack, she wondered if the terrible things she'd done to people, Charlie included, had been meted out as karmic payback to Langston and Markko.\n\n\nAs Dorian turned away, overcome with emotion, Charlie placed his comforting hands on her shoulders.  He told her that God wasn't taking out her sins on the teens, and reminded her, \"It's not all about you, Dorian.\"  Dorian laughed at his levity, and told Charlie he didn't have to make her feel good.  \"Why not?\" Charlie asked. \"It's free.\"\n\n\nAt the Sun, Todd tore into one of his private investigators, who'd provided him only basic facts on Hannah's family, friends, and past.  He was certain there was far more to the girl, and ordered his cohort to find him the \"real dirt.\"\n\n\nAfter the P.I. left, Todd got a surprise visitor: Marty.  Todd assumed she was there to ask him to drop the charges against Cole, but Marty said she wanted to speak to him about his case instead.  She asked Todd to look her in the eye and tell her the truth: \"Did you push me down the stairs?\"  \"What do you think?\" Todd replied.\n\n\nTodd reminded Marty that she had an \"eyewitness\" to her attack, Hannah, and innocently asked if she was starting to doubt the girl's word.  \"You don't believe Hannah,\" he said, seizing the moment. \"You know she's lying.\"  Marty told him not to confuse the issue, and to answer her question.  Todd said he didn't push her down the stairs, but he knew who did.\n\n\nShowing Marty his dossier on Hannah, Todd said he was gathering information on the girl, and would soon have the truth about her; Hannah was crazy, and he would prove it.  He explained his theory of why Hannah had pushed Marty down the stairs, and used Todd and Marty's natural enmity to drive a wedge between Starr and Cole.  He warned Marty that she was not likely to be Hannah's first and only victim, and pointed out his front-page headline on the Ford assault case.  He told Marty about Hannah's dalliance with Ford, and her suicide attempt, which Cole had covered up.  Ford had crossed Hannah -- \"look what happened to Ford.\"\n\n\nMarty was skeptical about Todd's scenario, and Todd suggested she confront the girl herself, and use her skills as a therapist to \"shrink her.\"  Marty said it wasn't that simple, but Todd said her choice was clear-cut, no matter how much she wanted to lean on their history and her hatred of him for easy answers.  \"I didn't push you down the stairs, Marty,\" Todd murmured, getting in her face. \"What are you going to do about it?\"\n\n\nAfter Marty left, Todd's long-suffering P.I. returned, and informed him that another one of Todd's goons was still tailing Hannah, who'd headed for Robert Ford's hospital room.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Hannah entered Ford's room in the ICU and was eager to gloat over his unconscious body.  \"I wonder if you can hear me,\" she mused aloud to the prone young man.  She realized he couldn't talk back, however, and couldn't humiliate or demean her as he had in the past.  \"You look horrible, by the way,\" she added, and said that no one was drooling over his six-pack abs in that condition.  She told Ford that she'd finally moved on, and found the perfect way to get over him.\n\n\nHannah noted that the news broadcast warned that Ford might not pull through.  \"I know I should say I'm sorry,\" she sighed. \"But I'm not.  You got what you deserved.\"\n\n\nAs Hannah left Ford's room, she ran into Langston, who was on her way inside.  Hannah immediately began to taunt Langston about her own failed relationship with Ford, and dressed the younger girl down for throwing away her relationship with Markko.  Langston shrugged off Hannah's jibes, and said Hannah was the truly pathetic one; she knew Hannah wanted Cole, but she'd never have him, no matter what she did, because Starr and Cole would be together forever.  As Langston shrugged past her, Hannah seethed with jealous anger.\n\n\nInside Ford's room, Langston was taken aback by the sight of Ford's battered body.  \"Ford, I'm so sorry,\" she cried.  Growing rueful, she recalled how he'd told her he loved her, and said she'd pictured their having a wonderful life together.  She knew he hadn't wanted that, but he'd talked her into believing his lies.  She asked if she was really just a stupid loser, and if he'd cared for her at all.\n\n\nLangston realized that she'd fallen for Ford's line too many times; she'd tried to leave him, but had always crawled back.  She concluded that it really did make her a stupid loser, and said she should've ended things with him months before.  Gathering her things, Langston told the unconscious man that she'd made a mistake by visiting him.  \"You were the biggest mistake I ever made,\" she added, and said she'd pay for it for the rest of her life.\n\n\nAcross town, Starr took Hope out for a sunny picnic in the park.  Laying out a blanket and food, she told the little girl they had everything they needed for their day out.  \"Almost,\" she added quietly, her thoughts turning to Cole.  After getting Hope settled, Starr attempted to study for finals, but found herself flashing back to her confrontation with Cole at the police station.  As her eyes filled with tears, she became overcome with emotion.\n\n\n\"Are you all right?\" a handsome young stranger asked, walking over to Starr and Hope.  Starr attempted to hide her tears, and claimed she was suffering from allergies, but the young man said he had just the cure for allergies, and handed her a packet of Kleenex.  Starr thanked him, dabbed at her eyes, and muttered that she wasn't setting the best example for her daughter.\n\n\nThe young man was stunned to realize that Starr was Hope's mother, and admitted he was amazed that she was juggling the responsibilities of school and motherhood.  After some prodding, Starr told him that Hope's father wasn't in the picture.  The man concluded that the father had abandoned Hope, but Starr corrected him; she said that Cole was in jail, but she didn't feel like discussing it any further with a stranger.  \"My name's James,\" the young man said, holding out his hand, \"and I'm not a stranger.\"  Starr shook his hand, and introduced herself, which prompted James to marvel at her name: \"Like 'twinkle, twinkle?'\"\n\n\nStarr told James that Cole had been jailed for \"hurting someone he thought deserved it,\" and said it was a long story.  She asked James if he lived in Llanview, and he explained he was visiting a seriously ill friend in the hospital ICU.  They exchanged condolences, and Starr said her family situation was made more complicated by the fact that Cole no longer wanted to see her.  James said he could relate to complicated personal problems, and asked Starr how their lives had gotten so messed up.\n\n\nAs Starr and James continued to talk, Hannah entered the park and spotted them together.  Seeing an opportunity, she quickly snapped a picture of them with her phone's camera.\n\n\nAcross the meadow, James pressed Starr for more details about her problems with Cole, but backed off when she grew reticent.  James told her he didn't want to pry, and wished her the best of luck.  Starr thanked him for his Kleenex, and for not being a stranger; she hoped his friend would recover.  As James walked away, he told Starr he hoped Cole would \"start treating you like the Starr you are.\"  With James gone, Hannah rose from her hiding place, and smirked at her latest triumph.\n\n\nBack at the picnic, Starr clutched Hope, who called out for her father.  \"Daddy's not here,\" Starr said as she sighed.  As she fed Hope, she reminisced about the first time she and Cole had given the little girl some ice cream, and their happier times together as a family.\n\n\nAt the police station, a cop passed by John's office and handed him the latest information on the Ford case.  In the waiting area, T\u00e9a greeted Markko's father, Ernesto, who was anxious to take Markko home.  T\u00e9a promised Ernesto she'd speak to John and get Markko freed as quickly as possible.\n\n\nEntering John's office, T\u00e9a ordered him to release Markko; the case against him was thin, and the police didn't have enough evidence for probable cause.  John told her they'd make a case for probable cause shortly thanks to Ford, who was sure to know who'd attacked him.  T\u00e9a asked if Ford was up for talking, and John assured her he would be soon enough.\n\n\nJust then, Detective Price burst in with new information for John; he clammed up when he saw T\u00e9a, but the lady lawyer asked him to spill his news in the interest of sharing information with the defense.  Reluctantly, Price informed John and T\u00e9a that Ford was still unconscious, and that the doctors said there was no telling when or if he would recover.  T\u00e9a seized the moment, and reminded John that with Ford in a coma and only circumstantial evidence against Markko, the police barely had room to hold her young client.  John wouldn't budge, and T\u00e9a reminded him that many others hated Ford and wanted him dead.  She asked him why he wasn't looking at anyone else for the assault charge.\n\n\nAfter sending Detective Price back to the crime lab, John faced T\u00e9a's accusations.  T\u00e9a told him he was railroading an innocent kid, but John reminded her of the incriminating evidence against Markko; he said he liked the boy, but couldn't ignore Ford's blood found on Markko's shoes or at the Buenos Dias.  T\u00e9a said he wasn't looking hard enough at the other suspects, and insisted Markko wasn't a killer.  She told John that all the police investigation was doing was ruining Markko, and his family.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a pointed out Ernesto watching them from outside the office, John asked her why she was using Markko's family as \"props\" in her defense.  T\u00e9a told John that the Riveras were good, proud people, and that both they and the Llanview community knew John and the police force were making a mistake by targeting a young Latino honor student.  \"Really?\" John asked, baffled. \"You're gonna go there?\"  T\u00e9a said she would \"go\" anywhere to help her client; she had friends in the press, and would assemble Hispanic leaders in the community for rallies and speeches, all to put pressure on John and his office in order to get Markko released.\n\n\nStepping outside, T\u00e9a and John met with Ernesto and Aurelia.  Aurelia was desperate for Markko to be freed, but John explained that he couldn't let her son go.  As Aurelia grew emotional, Langston arrived in the reception area.  Ernesto and T\u00e9a struggled to hold Aurelia back as she lunged at the girl, and screamed about how Langston had destroyed Markko's future.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a led the Riveras away, Langston summoned her courage, walked over to John, and asked to speak to him.  John led her into his office, and Langston told him she had to tell him something.\n\n\nIn the cellblock, Cole gazed at his tattered photo of Starr and Hope, then greeted Markko upon his return from the showers.  As Markko returned to his cell opposite Cole's, Cole told Markko how sorry he was about everything that had gone down with Langston and Ford.  Markko said it wasn't his fault, but Cole insisted it was, and revealed that he and Starr had known of Langston's affair.  They'd believed Langston's lies about having ended things with Ford, but Cole knew it was no excuse, and apologized to his friend.\n\n\nFuming, Markko struggled to contain his rage.  \"Everyone knew but me,\" he murmured, and said he'd been an idiot.  He reflected on how he'd known something was wrong with Langston, how he'd sensed the vibe between Langston and Ford when he'd seen them together; when he found her button inside Ford's office, a part of him had known the truth, but refused to believe it.  Cole told Markko he wished his friend wasn't in jail with him, but he was glad they had a chance to talk things out.  He told Markko that he and Starr had fought over telling Markko the truth at the time, but lately they were fighting over other things as well.\n\n\nAs Markko pressed for details about Cole and Starr's problems, Cole explained that he'd sent Starr away for the foreseeable future; he didn't want their endless arguments about Todd and Hannah to turn into a permanent rift between them, and he didn't see a way forward for their relationship as it stood.  Markko told Cole that he and Starr would make it, and that they belonged together.  \"Like you and Langston?\" Cole asked, dubious.\n\n\nMarkko said it was different for him and Langston; he wanted to remember the good times, but it was impossible.  Since learning the truth, all he could think of was Ford's hands all over her.  Cole urged him not to think about it, but Markko said he had to, and he had to tell Cole everything.  \"I gotta tell you all of it!\" he cried.\n\n\nAs the cellblock guard returned, Cole whispered to Markko that he didn't have to explain anything to him, but Markko insisted -- he told Cole that he had gone back to Ford's apartment after finding Langston there, and he'd wanted him dead.  Cole begged him to stop, but before Markko could go on, T\u00e9a arrived with the Riveras, who immediately commenced worrying over their son.  Delighted to see his family, Markko told them that when he was released, he wanted to move back home.  At their downcast looks, Markko asked what was wrong, and T\u00e9a explained that he was being held until his arraignment.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a left to attend to Markko's case, Markko shared a semi-private moment with his parents.  Aurelia was worried about how he fared behind bars, but Markko said he was coping.  Aurelia couldn't believe he'd almost killed a man, but Markko was stunned by her words, and said he hadn't attacked Ford.  \"I'm innocent!\" he declared.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Hannah was returning to Ford's room when Marty stopped her in the corridor.  Hannah asked how Cole was holding up, and offered to visit the police station if he needed anything.  When Marty asked why she was at the hospital, Hannah said she was \"visiting a friend,\" and Marty quickly deduced that she was checking on Ford.  Hannah was startled when Marty mentioned that she knew Ford was Hannah's ex, and asked if Cole had told her.\n\n\nBefore Marty could answer, Hannah backtracked and said her past was no big deal; her relationship with Ford was ancient history, and no secret.  She feigned sympathy for her former lover, and said that just because they weren't together didn't mean she didn't care.  Before Hannah could enter Ford's room, Marty stopped her again and asked her if she still needed a therapist to deal with her breakup with Ford.  Hannah said it wouldn't be necessary, as she'd dealt with her issues and found a new outlet -- after she'd seen Ford for what he was, she couldn't be bothered to hurt anymore.\n\n\nAs Hannah headed down the hall, Marty stopped her once more.  Probing, she told the young coed that it wasn't easy to get over a bad rejection, and that anger could build up and make people lash out in violent ways.  Marty wondered if Hannah had lashed out at Ford, and the nervous girl asked what she meant.  \"Did you try to kill Ford?\" Marty asked her point-blank. \"Did you try to kill me?\"\n\n\nDown the hall, a nurse entered Ford's room and found James standing over the unconscious patient.  She told him visiting hours were reserved for family.  \"That works,\" James replied. \"I'm Robert's brother.\"\n\n\nBack at the police station, John asked Langston what she needed to tell him.  \"I did it,\" Langston said -- she'd attacked Ford. \n\n\n",
