He informed Viki that they had no other choice but to use electroconvulsive therapy. Viki was nervous, since Mitch Lawrence had used ECT, and made Jessica revert back to her teenage years. Dr. Levin assured Viki that the therapy would loosen the hold that Tess had on Jessica.\n\n\nViki and Dr. Levin heard Tess yelling in her room. Dr. Levin revealed that Tess had gotten worse, and he feared that she would try to hurt herself. Viki wondered why Tess's situation was so much worse than other times she'd resurfaced. The doctor didn't know, but he knew that the longer they waited to get Jessica back, the harder it would be.\n\n\nClad in a straitjacket, Tess yelled at Bess that Tess was there to stay. Bess recognized that Tess wanted to stay for Ford. \"Fine. So what?\" Tess yelled. She explained how Ford had changed. She knew that Ford cared about her, and knew that she was real. Bess reminded Tess that she was only a fragment of Jessica, and that she would inevitably have to give control to Jessica. Tess demanded that Bess leave her alone, so Bess disappeared.\n\n\nHearing the door open, Tess assumed it was Bess, and said to go away. Viki entered and told Tess that Tess could cooperate, or be given the ECT treatment. Tess didn't believe Viki, but Viki assured Tess that it was true. Viki urged Tess to let Jessica out. \"What's in it for me?\" Tess demanded. Viki explained that, while Jessica had a full life, Tess had no future. Tess insisted that she had a life, and said that people loved her.\n\n\nTess reminded Viki that Tess had been the one who'd created Ryder. Viki refused to lose her daughter. Viki vowed to get Jessica back \"by force\" if Tess wouldn't cooperate. Tess replied, \"I choose life. My life. To hell with Jessica.\" Viki left the room, visibly upset.\n\n\nAs Viki cried outside the room, Dr. Levin asked if Viki was all right. Viki missed Jessica, and wanted the doctor to get Jessica back. She authorized the ECT treatment.\n\n\nTess told herself that there was no way Viki would authorize the ECT treatment. Just then, Dr. Levin entered with two orderlies. He told her that they were going to take her for treatment. The orderlies carried her out of the room as she kicked, and screamed for Ford.\n\n\nJames walked into the apartment and found Ford working out. Ford told James that James had been right -- Ford had made a big mistake. Ford had fallen in love with Tess, even though he hadn't wanted to. He admitted that he'd gone to see Tess at St. Anne's, and had told her that he had something to tell her. James was convinced that, once Ford told Tess about his feelings, Tess would take advantage of Ford. Ford wanted support, but James just didn't want to see his brother get hurt.\n\n\nJames reminded Ford that Tess wasn't a real person, and that she had a lot of problems. He also told Ford that Jessica was probably returning as they spoke. James's phone went off. He looked at the message, and left the apartment.\n\n\nA short while later, there was a knock on the door. Ford answered it to Viki, who warned him to stay away from Tess. Viki revealed that Tess had suffered a setback, and that she was back in a straitjacket and a padded room. She confided that she'd been forced to decide in favor of getting ECT treatment for Tess. Viki had felt there was no choice, because it was the only way that Jessica could be reached. Ford wondered if Viki wanted to sacrifice Tess to get Jessica back. Viki said yes, and reminded him to stay away from Tess.\n\n\nDani offered to take Destiny home from the hospital, but Destiny wanted to stay. Destiny told Dani to go, because Shaun would be there soon anyway. Dani told Destiny to call with any changes, and left. Destiny saw the doctor walk past, and followed her to Matthew's room. Destiny listened outside the room.\n\n\nThe doctor entered Matthew's room, and Nora asked about Matthew's test results. The doctor revealed that Matthew's prognosis hadn't changed. Nora wondered what the doctor recommended. The doctor said that Bo and Nora could either look into long-term care, or they could take Matthew off of life support. Suddenly, Destiny burst into the room and said that they couldn't let Matthew die. Nora shooed Destiny out of the room, and closed the door.\n\n\nThe doctor urged Bo and Nora to think about what was best for Matthew. She suggested that they donate Matthew's organs, because Matthew's B negative type was needed. Nora refused to sacrifice her son. The doctor wondered how Bo felt. After a moment of silence, the doctor apologized, and walked away.\n\n\nA short while later, Bo and Nora sat outside of Matthew's room. Nora wondered why Bo hadn't said anything when the doctor had asked him for an opinion about Matthew's situation. He explained that there were no words to describe his thoughts. Nora thought that Matthew just needed time to recover. She knew that her son would return.\n\n\nJack was on MyFace, posing as Comicgurl15. He laughed about how Shane would never figure out that the \"girl\" was Jack. Starr entered and wondered what Jack was doing, because Blair had taken Jack's computer away. Jack explained that he had borrowed Brad's computer for homework. \"So you have nothing to hide?\" she replied. There was a knock on the door, and Starr answered it to Dani. Dani told Starr all about Matthew's condition. Both girls reminisced about good times with Matthew.\n\n\nStarr suggested that she and Dani start a MyFace page for Matthew, just like they had for Todd when he'd been in the hospital. Starr opened the computer and saw Comicgurl15's page up. \"It's not what you think!\" Jack swore. He made Starr promise not to say anything to Blair. She promised, as long as Jack hadn't been bullying Shane. Starr and Dani began setting up the page. Dani decided to go see Nate, because he'd been upset about Matthew as well.\n\n\nShane said that he was on to Jack, as he replied to another one of Comicgurl15's messages. Rex and Gigi entered, and demanded to know why he was on the computer. Shane lied that he was downloading tests for school. They accepted his answer, and wanted to talk to him about their wedding. They explained that, because of Matthew and Natalie being in the hospital, they didn't want a big wedding. Rex and Gigi had decided to get married that day at City Hall. Gigi was happy to see Shane smile at the news.\n\n\nA short while later, Rex and Gigi changed clothes. Rex wanted to visit Bo before they went to the courthouse. Gigi was happy to finally be marrying Rex. He kissed her, and left the house.\n\n\nShane continued talking to Comicgurl15. Gigi saw that he was on the computer again, and grabbed the computer. She saw that he and Comicgurl15 were flirting, and asked if she was Shane's girlfriend. She wanted to make sure that Shane had met the girl before, but he hadn't. Gigi warned her son that the girl could be anyone. Shane assured his mother that he knew that Comicgurl15 was Jack Manning.\n\n\nJack called Brad and made fun of Shane. \"Wait until he finds out it's me!\" he said as he laughed.\n\n\nNate told Deanna that Matthew's condition was his fault. He informed her that Matthew wasn't any better. He knew that he had to fix things. Deanna wondered how Nate would do that.\n\n\nA short while later, James arrived. He told Deanna that his work needed a cashier, and his boss had said that he'd give Deanna a shot. James offered to take Deanna there, so she walked away to get her bag. James wanted to make sure that Deanna's living arrangements were working out with Nate, which Nate confirmed. Noticing something was wrong, James wondered if his brother was all right. Nate claimed to be worried about Matthew. Deanna returned, and she and James left.\n\n\nDani arrived at Nate's, and noticed that he looked sick. \"I feel sick all the time,\" he replied. Dani wondered what was wrong. He lied that he thought he was \"coming down with something.\"\n\n\nNora told Bo that she would do whatever it took to help Matthew recover. Rex entered and hoped that he wasn't interrupting. \"Talk to Rex. He knows all about fighting for his son,\" Nora said, and left. Bo asked why Rex was wearing a suit, but Rex wanted to know about Matthew. Bo updated Rex on everything the doctor had said about Matthew.\n\n\nRex wondered if there was anything he could do. Bo related that Rex was doing it. Bo said that it was hard to talk to Nora, and he couldn't unload on Clint either. Rex admitted that Clint had suffered a setback, and updated Bo on Clint's surgery. He continued that Clint was at the top of the transplant list for the first B negative heart that surfaced. Bo realized that Clint had the same blood type as Matthew.\n\n\nDestiny sat with Matthew, and told him not to listen to the doctor. She knew that Matthew would return, because she couldn't lose him. She told him how their night together had meant something to her, too, and she felt connected to him. Starr entered the room, and Destiny begged her not to tell anyone about Destiny and Matthew. Starr promised, and thought that Matthew wouldn't mind Starr knowing.\n\n\nStarr told Destiny that Matthew had had a crush on her when they were younger. She remembered telling him that he'd find the right girl, and Starr thought that he had. Destiny didn't know what to do if he didn't make it.\n\n\nA short while later, Nora sat with Matthew as well. Starr offered to get breakfast with Destiny as a break from the hospital. Nora told them to go, because they were of no use to Matthew if they didn't take care of themselves. Destiny offered to get Nora something. Nora thanked Starr for setting up the MyFace page. She asked Starr to tell people to pray, because that was what she believed Matthew needed. Starr agreed, and left.\n\n\nNora promised Matthew that she would never take him off of life support, and \"pass out\" his organs.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Viki goes to talk to Jessica's doctor at St. Ann's who tells her that they've tried everything in order to get Jessica back. But Tess remains in control and he's afraid she's a danger to herself or others. So the only alternative may be electro convulsive shock therapy. Viki does not like that idea. But he tells her it may be the only way to get Jessica back. While Tess is there, she fights with her desires for Robert Ford. Robert also fights with his desires for her. When Viki goes to confront Robert about what he did to her daughter, he protests that Tess is her daughter and she must respect and honor her. Viki tells him that they have no alternative except shock therapy. And knowing and remembering Tess's fear about that, he urges her not to do it but she does not listen. Doctors tell Bo and Nora that Matthew might never regain consciousness and may be a vegetative state for the rest of his life. So they might want to consider donating his organs. Nora tells her no way. She will not give up on her son. Destiny feels the same way. But when Rex informs Bo that Clint needs a heart transplant, Bo considers donating his son's heart to his brother knowing they have the same blood type. Shane seems to know that Jack is behind the facade of \"comicgirl15\" who contacts him online. And he's ready to fool Jack. Gigi catches him on line and he admits to what he is doing and that he knows Jack is still harassing him.",

The doctors decided on the latter, and Matthew died the next day, leaving behind a wife and two young children, and a mother and a daughter who were devastated by the loss. The family was reunited with Matthew, who had been taken to the hospital for treatment for a rare form of cancer called an acute myelodysplastic syndrome (AMS)\n"
