She told him that Ford was doing well but hadn't yet regained consciousness. There was no way of knowing if there was brain damage until he woke up, but there was no way of telling when he would wake up. The nurse assured James that Ford would be safe, since the person who hurt him had been caught.\n\n\nJames requested a moment alone with his brother, so the nurse left. James told Ford that he was lucky to be alive, but James wasn't surprised that he had been beaten up \"again.\" James knew that his brother would come out of it. He began to tell Ford about the fool he had made of himself hitting on Starr at the park, and he needed Ford to tell him where he went wrong. As James told Ford that Ford was the only one he could talk to, Ford's eyes fluttered open.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Hannah wondered if Marty was trying to accuse her of pushing Marty down the stairs and of hurting Ford. Marty related that she was worried about Hannah and questioned if Ford had made Hannah angry enough to hurt him. Hannah asked what that had to do with Marty, and who gave her the idea. Marty inquired why Hannah thought someone gave her the idea. Hannah divulged that she had heard it before from \"irrational people,\" and thought it was completely crazy.\n\n\nHannah realized that Marty had heard it from Todd and Starr. Hannah wondered why people thought she would hurt Marty to get to Cole, and why Marty was defending her rapist. Marty reasoned that Hannah was there when Marty was pushed, and that it was odd that Hannah was visiting a man that she supposedly hated. Hannah explained that it was hard to just stop caring, and wondered if that's why Marty was listening to Todd. She hoped she was wrong because she didn't want Marty to let Todd off the hook just so he could hurt her again.\n\n\nLangston confessed to John that she was the one who tried to kill Ford. John shuffled her out of his office as she asked if she was going to a cell. He told her that she was going home because she needed a lawyer present, but Langston insisted that she didn't. She needed to confess because she couldn't let Markko take the fall for something she did. She claimed that, after seeing Markko angrily packing at their apartment, she went back to Ford's to get an apology. Ford had argued that he never cared about her and didn't owe her an apology. In response, she grabbed one of Ford's trophies and hit him multiple times, then ran home without telling anyone what happened.\n\n\nLangston wanted John to let Markko go and arrest her. A cop entered the room and John instructed him to take Langston to another room because they needed her official statement. John told her not to leave anything out as the cop led her out.\n\n\nMarkko maintained his innocence to his skeptical-looking parents. Noticing that they looked worried, Markko accused them of not believing him. He needed his parents on his side. Mrs. Rivera couldn't believe that it could be Markko's shoes with the blood on them, but Markko confessed that the shoes belonged to him. His parents left, citing the fact that T\u00e9a needed to know. Just then, the cop guarding the cells told Markko that he was wanted upstairs.\n\n\nAs Markko entered John's office, John was talking to Bo on the phone about new evidence that could possibly change the course of the case. He got off the phone, and Markko asked if T\u00e9a was there and also reminded John that he couldn't ask questions without Markko's lawyer present. John reassured Markko that he was on Markko's side because something told him that Markko was innocent. The detective informed Markko that, if he worked with John, he could be home as soon as that day. Markko began to tell John about why his shoes had Ford's blood on them.\n\n\nMarkko confessed that he had gone back to Ford's and found the door unlocked. He had entered Ford's room, shook the man, and told him to get up. Markko then felt something wet on his hands. He turned on the lights to find that his hands were covered in blood, as was Ford. Markko panicked, running back to the diner to wash his hands and throw out his bloodstained shoes.\n\n\nThe next day, Markko was at the hospital to get his hand fixed up when they took Ford in. Markko swore that he thought Ford was dead the night before and, if he had known Ford was alive, he would have called someone. As Markko vowed that it was all a misunderstanding, John led him out of the office to look at the new evidence in another room. John opened the door, and Markko was shocked to see Langston writing her statement.\n\n\nOut of breath, Hannah arrived at Cole's jail cell. When Cole asked her what happened, she replied, \"Todd.\" She claimed that Todd got into Marty's head so that the doctor thought that Hannah pushed her down the stairs and tried to kill Ford as well. Hannah wanted to make sure that Cole believed Hannah, but the cop guarding the cells told him it was time for his phone call, so he had to go.\n\n\nDorian assured Charlie that he didn't have to be so nice to her, and she got closer and closer to him. Suddenly, Jack was there, taking a picture with his cell phone and calling it blackmail. Jack was triumphant that he had caught his aunt kissing someone again to the denial of Charlie and Dorian. Dorian wanted the camera, but calling it a negotiation, Jack asked what he was going to get out of the deal.\n\n\nAfter telling someone on his phone to keep following Hannah, Todd entered and said that he'd help with the negotiations. Dorian told Jack that he needed to learn that there were things called rules that needed to be followed, and that the number one rule in La Boulaie was \"no blackmail.\" Todd reminded Jack that they had a big day ahead of them, then the two left, but not before Todd deleted the picture off of Jack's phone.\n\n\nCharlie was furious with Dorian and accused her of almost kissing him. Dorian couldn't deny that what they had been through together with Mitch had drawn them closer, but even if she did develop feelings for him, he loved Viki. She thanked him for his hard work and good ideas. In return, Charlie offered to set Dorian up with a guy he knew, but Dorian claimed to be \"off the market.\" Charlie apologized for overstepping and remembered that she had something with David anyway.\n\n\nCharlie explained that there had been speculation about David and Dorian once David had returned to town. Dorian had no idea he was back in town because she had instructed her staff to never put through his calls. He said that the fact that David was alone at Bo and Nora's wedding fueled the talk. Charlie reminded Dorian that David also had a bond with Viki, but Dorian was determined to believe that it was only to get to her. Suddenly convinced that Viki was going to run a bad story about her in the Banner, Dorian ran off to Llanfair to warn her not to.\n\n\nStarr promised Hope that she would fix things with Cole soon. Dani, who was on her way to the pool, ran into Starr and Hope. Starr asked about Matthew, but Dani informed her that they had broken up and she needed some alone time. Dani asked Starr to cheer her up and asked about Cole. Starr suggested that subject wouldn't cheer Dani up.\n\n\nStarr changed the subject back to Matthew, and Dani confided that Matthew told her that he loved her, and then someone else kissed her. Destiny saw the kiss and demanded that Dani come clean with Matthew, which she did. Dani was convinced that she and Matthew would never be friends again. She asked what was wrong with Starr and Cole, to which Starr replied that they were giving each other some space because being apart would probably be for the best.\n\n\nDani mentioned that Nate was the guy who kissed her. She admitted to a surprised Starr that they had kissed multiple times. Suddenly, there was a sound in the nearby bushes. Dani went to investigate and dragged a spying Jack out by the arm. After exchanging a few insults, the two run after each other and play fought to Todd's delight. Giving up against Dani, Jack yelled that it was his so there were no girls allowed. Dani left, saying she had plans.\n\n\nAs Jack ran off to fly his helicopter toy, Starr wondered if everything was all right between Dani and Todd. Todd said that they had been very close to having a relationship before Hannah ruined things. The two talked about how Marty still had doubts about Todd, but that they were starting to get through to her. Todd confided that he thought Hannah was the one who tried to kill Ford because, the more he researched Hannah, the more he thought she was capable of.\n\n\nTodd's phone rang and it was Marty, telling Todd that she spoke with Hannah. She added that Hannah was terrified of Todd, which Todd wasn't surprised about. He related that Hannah was terrified because she knew that Todd was onto her. Marty hung up and Todd reported to Starr that Marty was finally getting wise. However, they needed someone who had seen Hannah's crazy streak up close, \"like Ford.\"\n\n\nAs Viki carried a bouquet of flowers into Llanfair, she was stunned to see a naked David practicing yoga. Viki covered him with her flowers and implored him to get dressed. After he was dressed, Viki wondered if he needed a place to stay, but David was staying with Matthew. David said that Viki needed help getting back at Charlie and Dorian. He showed a confused Viki a picture of Charlie and Dorian along with a headline in the Sun: \"Move Over Chiki; Here Comes Charlian.\"\n\n\nAn appalled Viki asserted that there was nothing between Charlie and Dorian because he loved Viki. Charlie and Dorian were just working together on projects that were going to benefit the town. Just then, Viki received a picture message from Todd of the picture Jack took of Charlie and Dorian. Underneath the picture, Todd had written, \"Wake up and smell the affair!\" Unbelieving, Viki showed David and started to get angry about Dorian always rubbing her and Charlie's relationship in Viki's face.\n\n\nViki reassured herself that there was no \"Charlian,\" and that she trusted Charlie. David reminded Viki that their friendship drove Dorian crazy. David told Viki that they should work on her \"flow.\" Not wanting to get naked with David, she refused. As he led her outside, David promised that she could stay clothed and achieve inner peace.\n\n\nSitting on the ground and being hugged by David, Viki was being urged to take deep, calming breaths. She began to moan about how good it felt just as Dorian and Charlie walked through the door.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Charlie offers Dorian support and sympathy and Dorian caresses his face when she thanks him. Jack is on hand to take a candid photo of it. Todd deletes the picture and tells Jack that he is too young to tangle with Dorian and win. Charlie confronts Dorian about trying to kiss him, but Dorian denies it. He offers to introduce her to a friend, but she says she isn't interested. He assumes she is still into David Vickers and tells her that he is back in town. Viki finds David Vickers doing yoga naked in her yard. He tells her that he is in town to stay with Matthew while Bo and Nora are on their honeymoon, but he had to come see Viki when he saw a steamy picture of Charlie and Dorian in the Banner. He suggests that they take some sexy pictures of their own. Viki says nothing is going on between Charlie and Dorian, but then Todd sends her the picture that Jack took. Viki loses her temper and pulls a stack of pictures out of a drawer. She says she trusts Charlie but Dorian's constant sidling up to Charlie is starting to get on her nerves. He tells her that he understands, and that is why he hasn't told Dorian that he is in town. David and Viki practice a yoga technique (with their clothes on) in the yard to help Viki relieve stress. Viki screams, \"Oh David\" just as Dorian and Charlie arrive. Dani tells Starr that she and Matthew broke up because she kissed another boy. Todd tells Starr that he was close to having a relationship with Dani until Hannah ruined it and that Hannah is going to pay. He tells her that he thinks Hannah is the person that tried to kill Ford. He says they need to find someone that has seen her crazy streak so they can discredit her. Starr suggests Ford. Marty asks Hannah if she tried to kill her and Ford. Hannah says Marty would have to be crazy to believe that. Hannah goes to see Cole in jail and tells him that Todd convinced Marty that Hannah pushed her down the stairs and hurt Ford. Markko tells his parents that he can't believe that they think he killed Ford. Langston confesses to attempting to kill Ford. John tells Markko that he is on his side and tells him that he wants to work with him to explain away the evidence. Markko tells him he can explain about the shoeprints in Ford's blood. He tells him that he went back to Ford's apartment to confront him and found on his bed covered in blood. He says he thought he was dead so left and didn't say anything about it. John tells Markko that someone else has confessed, so he takes him to the interview room where Langston is writing down her confession. Ford's brother James visits him in the hospital. He tells him he has to pull through because he needs him. He tells him that he messed up and Ford is the only person he can tell because he can't hear him, but before he can spill his secret, Ford opens his eyes.",
