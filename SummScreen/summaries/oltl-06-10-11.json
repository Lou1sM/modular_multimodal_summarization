Bo recognized that Clint and Matthew had the same blood type, as Nora walked in.  Nora then asked what that had to do with anything.\n\n\nBo explained that Clint had taken a turn for the worse, and that he needed a heart transplant.  Nora feared that Bo was suggesting that they give Matthew's heart to Clint.  Nora screamed that Bo could not just take Matthew's heart, while Matthew still needed it, and for Bo to stop even thinking about it.  Nora cried, \"I'm not letting anyone take Matthew's heart.  They'll have to cut mine out first.  Our son is not dead.  Dr. Pryor says there's some brain activity, and we're not killing him.\"\n\n\nBo denied that he wanted to give Matthew's heart to Clint, and Rex explained to Nora that he had been the one to state that Clint would get the next B negative heart available.  Rex stressed that Clint could get his heart from someone else.  Nora claimed that she felt sorry for Clint, but then she insisted that their thoughts needed to be for Matthew.  Nora maintained that they had to fight for Matthew, until he woke up and could fight for himself.\n\n\nNora howled that she did not want to hear any more about how Matthew could not be saved.  Nora then cried in Bo's arms and apologized to Rex, who claimed that Matthew would get his miracle.  After Nora left to check on Matthew, Rex indicated that he needed to leave -- to get married.  Bo congratulated Rex, who mentioned that the timing was lousy.  However, Bo insisted that Rex leave to get married, and to celebrate.  Bo claimed that he would be thinking of Rex and Gigi, and Rex insisted that he would say a prayer for Matthew.\n\n\nIn Matthew's room, Nora held Matthew's hand and declared that she would look out for him.  Nora then reacted when she felt a movement in Matthew's hand.  Nora screamed out to everyone that Matthew had squeezed her hand, and Dr. Pryor bent down to check on Matthew.  Yet, the doctor could see no change in his condition, and she indicated that it had been an involuntary response.\n\n\nAfter the doctor maintained that nothing could be done for Matthew, Nora shrieked that she could not understand, and that it was all meaningless.  However, Dr. Pryor exclaimed that it was not all meaningless, because Matthew's heart could save someone in the hospital.\n\n\nAlso at the hospital, Joey greeted Natalie with a hug and asked about Clint.  They then looked through the window at Clint, who was talking to his doctor.  The doctor said that Clint needed a new heart immediately, and Clint noted that B negative blood was not common.  When Clint asked if he had weeks left, the doctor claimed that it could be days.  Clint's doctor insisted that Clint get his affairs in order and told Clint to tell his family about his condition, as Joey and Natalie walked into the room.\n\n\nClint started coughing, and Natalie asked if there was anything Clint could take to help him.  Clint sadly admitted that there was no medication that could help his cough and then asked about Liam.  Natalie claimed that Liam was fine and could not wait to see his grandfather.  Natalie then added that Bree had made a card for Clint, and Clint declared that they would all need to stick together as a family.\n\n\nWhen Joey insisted that Clint would be up and about in no time, Clint said that he would not, because he was dying.  Natalie cried and asked why Clint had not told them before.  After Joey wondered if Kevin and Cord should be at the hospital, Clint indicated that they were taking care of Buchanan Enterprises business.  Natalie refused to give up, and Clint stated that only one thing could help him.  In the hospital hall, Dr. Pryor asked Clint's doctor if he had a patient on the heart transplant list.\n\n\nAfter Joey insisted that they would find Clint a heart, Clint declared that he had a mission.  \"Before I die, I want to see you both with the people who will make you happy for the rest of your lives.\"  Clint maintained that he just wanted them to be happy like he had once been with Viki.  Clint exclaimed that Natalie belonged with John, and that Joey belonged with Kelly.  Clint begged them to try again, as Rex walked by and saw Joey and Natalie talking to Clint through the window.\n\n\nIn Kelly's room at the hospital, John greeted Kelly, who announced that the doctor had just released her.  John asked if Kelly was ready for a fight, and Kelly noted that Natalie would probably be glad to give her one.  When John noted that Natalie would not be ready for a fight, because she had other things on her plate, Kelly remarked that she had heard that John had found Liam.\n\n\nJohn regretted that Marty had disappeared and felt that he still owed Kelly, because he believed that he was the reason that Marty had targeted Kelly.  However, Kelly thought that she had been distracted, because she and John had been wrapped up in each other.  Kelly suggested that she and John stop seeing each other.\n\n\nKelly felt that she and John were always reacting, though not to each other, and that they had been distractions to each other against their pain and hurt.  Kelly realized that they both were in love with other people.  Kelly noted that she did not know if she and Joey would be together, however, she wanted the time to figure it out, to put herself out there, and to let it all play out.  John stated that he hoped that whatever Kelly wanted would happen.\n\n\nWhen Kelly mentioned that they could still be friends, John laughed and said that he was not sure about being friends, but that he would always be there for Kelly, whenever she needed him.  John then offered to give Kelly a lift home, and he escorted her out of the room.\n\n\nIn the hospital hall, Starr told Destiny to return home to get some rest.  Destiny then yelled that she was going to be sick and ran to the bathroom.  After Destiny walked back out, she declared that she did not have time to be sick.  When Starr handed her a glass of water, Destiny mentioned that it must have been the burrito.  However, Starr had eaten a burrito, too, so she was not sure.\n\n\nStarr then remembered what she had overheard Destiny saying to Matthew and suspected that Destiny and Matthew had slept together.  Starr then asked Destiny if she was pregnant, and Destiny yelled, \"No way!\"  Starr cautioned that Destiny might have morning sickness and then asked if they had used protection.\n\n\nDestiny lied and claimed that they had and then pleaded with Starr to drop the subject.  Destiny assessed that she was still a kid, so therefore, she could not be pregnant.  Starr commented that Destiny was older than Starr had been when Starr had first learned that she had been pregnant with Hope.\n\n\nBy the pool at La Boulaie, the man with the original Todd's face hid in the bushes and watched Sam, who wore sunglasses and carried out a tray of food.  Sam noticed that he had forgotten his soda and returned inside.  The man walked out of the bushes and looked around.\n\n\nIn the kitchen at La Boulaie, Jack greeted his friend, Brad, and stated that the moron, Wheezy, did not know that he was lusting after Jack, who was ComicGirl15.  When Brad stated that he needed to be more careful on the computer, Jack admitted that his mother was monitoring him also.  Jack then cheered that Wheezy was \"going down.\" Sam walked in and asked, \"Who's Wheezy?\"\n\n\nSam reminded Jack that he was not supposed to be on the computer but stated that it would cost Jack ten dollars for Sam to keep quiet.  When Jack claimed that Sam would receive ten noogies if he said anything, Sam kicked Jack's bad toe and ran out.  Brad laughed and said that Jack should keep Sam locked up.  Jack indicated that Brad had given him an idea.\n\n\nWhen Jack informed Brad of his idea for \"total retaliation,\" Brad admitted that it was perfect.  Kelly and John walked through the door, and John asked Jack if he would welcome Kelly home.  Jack insincerely yelled out, \"Hey, Kelly, welcome home,\" as he ran out of the room.  Kelly then realized that she had forgotten her laptop in John's car, so John kissed her on the cheek and left to retrieve it.\n\n\nAt the Carriage House, Shane told Gigi that ComicGirl15 was Jack Manning and declared that he was onto Jack.  Shane explained that he had discovered it, when ComicGirl15 claimed that her favorite Batman villain was Black Hat.  Gigi realized that ComicGirl15 was an imposter, because Black Hat had actually dated Spiderman, and that Black Hat was Marvel Comics, not DC.  Gigi told Shane that she was leaving to kick Jack's butt.\n\n\nAfter Shane stopped Gigi from leaving, Gigi insisted that Shane leave Jack alone, but Shane insisted that he had to stand up for himself.  Shane asked her if he was supposed to keep taking it, until he...Shane stopped talking.  When Gigi realized what Shane had been about to say, she wondered if Shane should see his new doctor and asked if Shane was still upset about what had happened to Dr. Buhari.  Shane noted that he had felt bad about that but then declared that it was not the problem.\n\n\nWhen Gigi pleaded again for Shane to ignore Jack, Shane exclaimed that he could beat Jack at his own game.  Gigi then asked for Shane to promise to leave Jack alone and reminded Shane that it was his mother and father's wedding day.  Gigi asked if Shane was ready and suggested that he get dressed.  Gigi then took Shane's computer from him, so he would not be tempted by it upstairs in his room.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Clint maintained that Joey's and Natalie's happiness was his dying wish, and that he wanted them to leave and to try again with the ones that they loved to make him happy.  Once they left Clint's room, Natalie cried, as Joey held her in his arms to comfort her.  Joey then insisted that he needed to leave.  As Joey looked for Kelly around her hospital room, the nurse at the front desk informed him that Kelly had been discharged, and that her friend, the detective, had taken her home.\n\n\nRex greeted Natalie and indicated that he was sorry.  Natalie replied, \"Yeah, well, not as sorry as you're gonna be if you don't go in there right now and make peace with our father, before he dies.\"  Rex then announced that he and Gigi were getting married.  Natalie was thrilled, and she hugged him.  Natalie then emphasized that Rex had to tell their dad, because he would not have years to decide when to tell him.  Natalie cried, \"If you don't go and make this right now, you're gonna regret it the rest of your life.\"\n\n\nAfter Natalie walked off, Rex pondered what to do, as he watched Clint through the window.  Rex walked away and then returned and flew into Clint's room.  Rex declared that he had something to say to Clint.  In the hall, Natalie looked at John's picture and phone number on her cell phone.  John walked into the hospital hall and ran into Natalie, who was in tears.\n\n\nBack at the Carriage House, Shane yelled that the limo had arrived, when Gigi walked downstairs in her robe.  Gigi claimed that her makeup was not right and insisted that Shane travel in the limo without her.  Gigi held out a tie for Shane to give to Rex and pointed out, \"Next time we see each other, we'll both be Balsoms.\"  After Shane had left, as Gigi opened up Shane's computer, she exclaimed that she would take care of Jack and still have time to make it to her wedding.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at La Boulaie, Jack and Brad looked on the computer at the message from ComicGirl15, which invited Shane to a party.  When Gigi as Shane asked where and when, Jack typed, \"Here's the invite.  Can't wait to see you.\"  Jack then yelled out that Kelly had company, and Kelly found Joey at the door.  When Joey hesitated and started to leave, Kelly stopped him and asked what was wrong.  After Joey informed Kelly that his father was dying, Kelly hugged Joey and said that she was sorry.\n\n\nAt the pool, the man with Todd's original face opened up the potato chips and quietly thanked the kid.  He picked up the copy of the Sun and read the headline, \"McPain Martyrs Manning.\"  The man asked himself who the guy was that kept saying that he was Todd Manning.\n\n\nSam returned to the pool and asked, \"Who are you?\"  When Sam asked the man why he had eaten Sam's food, the man claimed that he had been hungry.  Sam then questioned if the man was homeless and offered him his drink.  Sam informed the man that his grandma was babysitting him.  When the man held up the Sun and pointed to Todd's picture, Sam explained that the man in the picture was his dad, Todd Manning.\n\n\nThe man again pointed to the photo and asked Sam, \"So this guy right here, this guy?  His name is Todd Manning?\"  When Sam replied, \"Yep,\" the man questioned, \"And he's your dad?\"  Sam answered, \"Yeah, he's my dad.\"  The man continued, \"Let me ask you something.  Who's your mother?\"  When Starr called out Sam's name, the man hid in the bushes.  Starr asked, \"Sam what are you doing?  Who are you talking to?\"  The man peered out through the trellis at Starr. \n\n\n",

When Shane informs his mom what he knows Jack is doing, she has a secret plan to go and confront Jack assuming she can do it and get back in time for her wedding to Rex although she does not tell her son or her fianc\u00e9 of her secret plan.

Hearing that, Bo remembers that Matthew has the same blood type as his uncle and while the doctor tells them that donating Matthew's organs might be a way to make something positive of this very grim situation, it appears Bo is considering a plan.
