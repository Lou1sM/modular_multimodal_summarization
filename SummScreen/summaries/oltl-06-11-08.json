    "soap_central": "\nThe Parent Trap\n\n\nJohn joined Antonio and Talia in the surveillance van, staked outside of Ramsey's penthouse. They were hoping that the listening device, planted inside Ramsey's home, would provide them with crucial information to help identify the woman whom Ramsey was keeping hidden away. As they speculated about the medical records that they had found in Ramsey's office days earlier, they heard Ramsey enter the woman's room and begin speaking to her. When they heard the woman utter, \"Help me,\" Antonio, Talia, and John had a moment of indecision. They debated rushing to the penthouse to rescue the woman or waiting to see if they could glean more information about the situation they would walk in on. In the penthouse, Ramsey continued to speak to his mystery guest as he picked a picture up from the floor. The woman had dropped it earlier but couldn't retrieve it herself. Inside the van, the three detectives realized that the woman wasn't in imminent danger. They continued listening as Ramsey talked to the woman but he didn't reveal anything that could help them. Eventually, Antonio and Talia decided to call it quits for the night, leaving John alone in the van. \n\n\nRoxy was visiting Charlie when Rex walked into Charlie's room and greeted them with barely concealed hostility. He informed them about his separation from Adriana and then began demanding answers. Neither was able to give Rex the answers he needed but Charlie tried to help Rex come to terms with their betrayal. He told Rex that he had been proud to be Rex's father. He had felt honored that Rex had wanted Charlie to be a part of his life. Charlie went on to apologize for the hurt that he had caused Rex but Rex scoffed at the heartfelt words. Rex then turned his anger on Roxy. He realized that the reason that Roxy had lied about Charlie was because Rex had gotten uncomfortably close to finding his true father. Roxy remained silent as Rex continued to express his anger and disappointment over the lengths that Roxy had gone to in order to keep him from learning his true father's identity. When it became apparent that Roxy had no intention of telling Rex anything about his father, Rex made his wishes clear. He disowned Roxy and told her that he never wanted to set eyes on her again. Roxy was devastated by her son's complete rejection. After Rex stormed out, Charlie asked Roxy why she didn't tell Rex the truth-that she didn't know who Rex's father was. Roxy's silence spoke volumes. Charlie realized that Roxy knew who the man was. Charlie was baffled why Roxy would continue to remain silent on the matter. Roxy explained that the truth would hurt Rex more than his not knowing. \n\n\nAt the park, Gigi and Brody were spending time with Shane. While Shane practiced basketball, Gigi and Brody talked. Gigi remained certain that Adriana intended to tell Rex that Shane was his son. Brody began to wonder if maybe Gigi secretly hoped that Adriana would tell Rex the truth about Shane. Before Brody could probe along those lines further, Shane approached them and asked if he could start using his father's last name. Gigi was clearly uncomfortable with the idea and Brody wisely supported her decision that Shane continue using Morasco as a surname. A short while later, Gigi reluctantly agreed to allow Shane and Brody to spend some time together alone in the park. After Gigi left, Shane asked Brody if he would be interested in spending Father's Day with him at the community center. Shane was eager to sign them up for father/son events that were scheduled at the center to celebrate the special day. Brody hesitated to agree, but Shane kept pushing until Brody relented. \n\n\nAdriana stopped off at Marcie's apartment on her way to the airport. Marcie was surprised to learn that Adriana and Rex had separated and that Adriana had decided to go to Paris alone for a few months. She was stunned when Adriana began apologizing for the way that she had treated Marcie in recent months. Adriana admitted that when she had learned that Marcie and Gigi were friends, Adriana no longer considered Marcie a friend. The two women opened up about their feelings and mended fences. Adriana confessed that she was worried that Rex would fall in love with Gigi while Adriana was in Paris. They were interrupted when Gigi stopped by to visit with Marcie. Adriana finished saying goodbye to Marcie, but before she walked out of the door, Gigi stopped her. Gigi asked Adriana if she had told Rex about Shane. Adriana said that she had only confessed to her own lies, not Gigi's. Later, at the airport, Adriana looked at a picture of her and Rex on their wedding day. She vowed that she would find a way to make her marriage to Rex work.\t\n\n\nAfter Adriana left Marcie's apartment, Gigi and Marcie sat down for a visit. Gigi seemed concerned when Marcie announced that she intended to go to the hospital and sign up as volunteer, working with children. Gigi wondered if Marcie was ready to take such a big step after everything that she had gone through with Tommy. \n\n\nStarr and Cole stopped off at the diner before they continued on to the park. While they were there, a female patron overheard Starr and Cole ordering food for Sam. She was shocked when the teens had ordered what she considered an unhealthy meal for the toddler. When the woman spoke up, Starr and Cole defended their actions. Unfortunately, the woman had more to say on the matter of children. She lectured the teens on parenthood and the pitfalls of becoming a young parent. Starr took what the woman said to heart. After the opinionated stranger left, Starr shared some of her doubts with Cole. Cole insisted that they would learn what they needed to know in order to take care of their child. He also vowed that he would be with Starr every step of the way during and after her pregnancy. Starr dropped the subject and reminded Cole of their plans to take Sam to the park. At the park, while Starr stepped away for some ice cream, a couple of Cole's friends approached him. They invited him to a game of basketball but Cole declined. Starr overheard the exchange and urged Cole to join his friends while he could. Cole was adamant; he wasn't interested in shooting hoops. \n\n\nMarcie was walking through the park when she passed Starr and Cole. They had their hands full with Sam, who was fussy and crying. Marcie tried to walk past them but couldn't seem to get very far. As Sam continued to cry, Starr grew increasingly frustrated. She finally turned to Marcie and asked her to help calm Sam down. \n\n\nWhile the camera panned to the mystery woman's picture, John listened to the tape he had recorded of the woman asking for help. The picture shown was of John and Marty Saybrooke, smiling. The camera then slowly panned to the woman in the bed; it was Marty! \n\n\nAt the Llanview airport, the US Ambassador to Mendorra welcomed the Crown Princess of Mendorra: Tina Lord!\n \n\n\n",
