When Rex walked into the room unexpectedly and caught Stacy with the phone, she quickly responded that his phone was dying and she was merely plugging it in. He cheerfully presented her with a set of keys to his club, hoping that she would put her plan into action for starting a school of dance.\n\n\nAfter Rex left, Stacy began to change her clothes, Shane interrupted when he walked in unannounced. Hiding his eyes, he demanded to know Rex's whereabouts. An evasive Stacy denied having any knowledge as to where Rex was, but coerced Shane into trusting her and revealing the reason for his need to speak to his dad. Shane disclosed that he had overheard his mother telling Schuyler that she had not really cheated on his dad with Brody. He thought his dad should know and then his parents would be back together.\n\n\nSighing, Stacy told the boy that his mother had made it up to impress Schuyler because she \"had a thing for Schuyler.\" A disappointed Shane was not happy that his aunt was suggesting that Gigi was a slut. Backpedaling slightly, Stacy denied meaning exactly that, but reminded Shane of all the guys his mom was spending time with. She understood that Gigi wanted Schuyler to like her, Stacy lied. Gigi was under stress, she disclosed. She felt that Shane had to let his parents move on. She suggested that his dad needed to find someone to make him happy, too. Shane thought maybe someone like Stacy would be good.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica burst into Chloe's room hysterically crying and hoping that it was only a nightmare that the baby was gone. Hearing her crying, Natalie did her best to comfort her sister. She also revealed that she had known the true identity of the baby and the fact that Bess had switched her for some time. She explained how she and Jared had pursued the truth after finding the hospital parking receipt from the night of the babies' births. She had decided to keep quiet because the baby was holding Jessica together, she continued.\n\n\nAs Jessica continued to cry, she expressed her disbelief that Natalie had wanted to care for her after all Jessica had done to Natalie and Jared. Natalie resolutely declared her love for her sister as her motivation for protecting her. Jessica expressed a desire to visit Marcie to apologize for her actions, but Natalie felt that it wasn't a very good idea. She assumed that Jessica really wanted to see the baby, and Jessica reluctantly admitted that was true.\n\n\nNatalie offered to visit the McBains instead and extend apologies from both of them. She let the baby swap go on for too long, she clarified. She reminded Jessica that she still had Bree who needed her. Jessica asked that Natalie tell Chloe she loved her.\n\n\nAs Marcie sat and played with Hope, she told Michael of her concern in taking the baby away from Starr and how difficult it had been to look at Starr when the baby had been handed over to them. Michael expressed his view that Starr was too young to be a mother to Hope, but Marcie felt that things were different. She explained that the baby was real and not just an abstract to Starr as she was before the birth.\n\n\nShe felt that something had changed in Starr and that she was more grown up and ready to be a mom since Hope's birth. Starr had also pursued the baby's death and didn't sit back as Marcie had, willing to accept whatever happened, Marcie continued. When there was a knock at the door, the couple was surprised to see Natalie. She explained that she was there to extend her regrets over what happened. She informed them that they could have had the baby months earlier if not for her. She explained how and when she had learned of the deception committed by Bess.\n\n\nJessica had suffered so much that Natalie felt compelled to keep her secret, she elaborated for the McBains. While Marcie insisted that they understood, she also pointed out how Natalie had watched them suffer, too. While trying to justify her actions, Natalie admitted that she had been wrong in doing what she did. The McBains were accepting and said they were fine, especially since they had their baby. Marcie added that Jessica was welcome to visit. It was hard enough for herself, Natalie pointed out, and thought they needed to let go.\n\n\nAs Starr agonized over the signed adoption papers at La Boulaie, she spied Langston carrying some balloons. Realizing she had forgotten about Markko's graduation, she apologized to her friend. Starr admitted that she missed her baby and Cole, and had thought about not signing the adoption papers, but felt she couldn't break Marcie's heart. Langston wondered about Starr's heart after all that had happened, but Starr didn't think that Marcie could bear to lose the baby after already losing one to Todd. She was also reluctant to tell Cole, thinking that he would hate her if he found out she wanted to change her mind about the adoption, Starr confided to Langston.\n\n\nAt the diner, Cole had a talk with Markko and confessed that he missed his baby and Starr, but didn't think he could be with Starr. He didn't think he'd be able to express his true feelings. Markko strongly believed that Starr would actually help Cole to feel better. Cole explained that he had wanted to keep the baby, but didn't want to mess with Starr's head again. He felt empty, though, he added. Markko thought that his friend would turn out to be a bigger jerk than he was in the past if he didn't share his emotions with Starr.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Brody asked for Gigi's forgiveness, explaining that his relationship with Jessica was no longer a secret. He felt bad that Gigi was not able to admit to everyone that her sleeping with him was not true. She assured him that the truth would be out soon and she'd be able to expose Stacy for not being the true donor of Shane's stem cells. Explaining to an astonished Brody that it was very possible that the stem cells were switched from an unknown person, an excited Gigi jumped into Brody's arms to give him a huge hug. That was the first thing Rex saw when he walked in, and he immediately made his disgust known.\n\n\nGigi accused him of jumping to conclusions when he made some wise cracks about her men. She reminded him that she was a good mother, though he added that she had been doing crazy things. She told him she'd explain it all soon, which provoked Rex's curiosity. She refused to say anything further, and instead, wondered why he was there. Rex wanted to know which of Shane's band concerts she'd be attending, to make sure they weren't at the same performance. After working out their schedules, Rex admitted he was confused. He only wanted things fixed and wanted her to explain it all.\n\n\nAs Starr continued to express her regrets over Hope's adoption, there was a knock at the door. It was Cole, who, when she wondered how he was, responded that he had seen better days. He then advised her that his mother really wanted him to attend the high school graduation, and it would mean a lot to him if he saw Starr sitting out in the crowd.\n\n\nA happy Starr conceded that she thought Cole would be finished with her once the adoption papers were signed. Cole declared that he understood that she had made a promise and he knew it was difficult for her. He didn't want to lose her or their relationship, he added. He still wanted her to be in his life. He stressed that she was the only one who totally understood his feelings for what had transpired. Starr confessed that he had just made things better. The couple shared a kiss, and realized that they needed to be with each other.\n\n\nJess and Bree stopped at Rodi's and visited with Brody, especially because Bree had mentioned that she missed him. She missed her sister, too, Bree told Brody, but knew she was with her new mommy. Brody did some bonding with Bree.\n\n\nAn adamant Stacy warned Shane not to tell Rex what he had heard from his mother. When Rex walked in, Shane claimed to be there to extend an invitation to his concert.\n\n\nAt the diner, Langston arrived to see Markko. The McBains with baby Hope were seated nearby. When Marcie went in search of a bib, she overheard the young couple talking. Langston admitted that she was concerned about Starr and Cole because they had wanted to keep their baby.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Marcie and Michael bring the baby home, they can sense that Starr may be having second thoughts. Starr reveals just that to Langston. Cole tells Starr he wants her to attend his graduation ceremony. And they declare that they want to be together and have their baby. Marcie then walks in to overhear Langston admitting to Markko that Starr told her she wanted to keep her baby. Jessica is distraught but Brody is there for her. Rex is still furious at Gigi. And she still cannot confirm that she knows Stacy faked the DNA results and therefore cannot tell Rex what she had to do. Stacy is working on Shane when he informs her that he overheard his mom telling Schuyler that she did not sleep with Brody. Stacy seems to know what she has to do to win both Rex and Shane over.",
