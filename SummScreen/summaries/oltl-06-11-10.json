Dorian and Charlie spotted the two of them through the terrace doors, and Dorian demanded to know what was going on.  When Viki insisted that it was not how it looked, David disagreed.  However, Charlie guessed that there was a rational explanation for their behavior.  Viki explained that she had been feeling very tense, and that David had helped her \"achieve serenity.\"  David caught Dorian up on his pa's marriage and told her that he was elated that he had actually performed the wedding ceremony.  However, David emphasized, \"But I have to say...helping Viki has been my favorite activity, so far.\"\n\n\nCharlie asked Viki why she had been so stressed, and David showed Dorian and Charlie the newspaper and magazine columns about Dorian and Charlie - together.  When Dorian insisted that the columns were \"promo shows,\" Viki demanded to know what Dorian and Charlie had been promoting.  As Viki showed a picture on her cell phone to Dorian, she asserted, \"It doesn't look to me like you're working.  In fact, it looks a hell of a lot like you are about to kiss him.\"  \n\n\nDorian laughed at the picture that Jack had taken of Dorian and Charlie at La Boulaie, as a prank of Jack's.  Viki informed them that Todd had sent her the photo, not Jack, and that Todd had only sent it to protect her.  Charlie insisted that he had not kissed Dorian then, and that he had never intended on doing so.  David asked Dorian, \"How about you, Hot Lips?  What was going through your mind?\"\n\n\nWhen Dorian reminded Charlie that what they had just witnessed could not have been innocent, Viki exclaimed that nothing was going on between David and her.  Charlie maintained that he trusted Viki, and that he hoped that Viki believed that he was also telling the truth.  Viki stated that she knew that Charlie was.  As Dorian announced her departure, Viki followed her into the lobby and claimed, \"I trust Charlie.  I don't trust you farther than I can throw you, which is not very far.  And I am warning you, lady.  Charlie is my husband, and you cannot have him.\"  \n\n\n\nCharlie and David joined them, and Charlie informed Dorian that he would not work for Dorian, if it bothered his wife.  Viki explained that she knew how important the Urban Renewal project was, which was why she had been felt it was fine that Charlie had worked for Dorian originally.  Then Viki remarked to Dorian, \"Just as I'm sure you're fine with David working for me.\"  When David questioned if he would be working for Viki, she yelled, \"You need a job, don't you?  Fine...you're hired.\"\n\n\nOn her cell phone at the Sun, Jessica thanked Brody, who was at the Llanview Police Station, for giving her life back to her.  As soon as Jessica entered what was once Todd's office, Kelly greeted her, and they hugged.  Jessica wondered where Todd was, and Kelly stated that he was out.  After Jessica inquired, Kelly informed her that she was working on a piece about Ford, who sounded \"like a real snake, who preyed on vulnerable women.\"\n\n\nJessica asked Kelly why she had a bodyguard.  Kelly explained that she was searching for clues, because she thought her mother had been murdered.  However, since Shaun was her bodyguard for protection, Kelly stated that made it difficult for her to get close to Reed.  Yet, Kelly insisted that she and Reed were taking things slowly anyway.  When Kelly asked about Brody, Jessica declared that she and Brody had picked up where they had left off, as if nothing had ever happened.  Jessica was concerned, because she knew that things had happened.  Kelly claimed that Brody had faith in Jessica, and Jessica admitted that she was just very lucky to have all of her memories back.\n\n\nJessica explained to Kelly how she had gotten her memories back but realized that she had blocked out what Mitch had tried to do to her.  Kelly recognized that what Jessica had gone through must have been terrible, after Jessica remembered to herself that Ford had kissed her in his bed, just as she had remembered what Mitch had done to her.  Kelly exclaimed that Jessica had a very inspirational story, which would be a good column for the Sun.\n\n\nWhen thinking about a possible headline for her Sun story, Jessica announced, \"Unhinged Heiress Turns Into Terror Teen.\"  But Kelly decreed that \"Love Conquers All\" would be a better headline.  However, Jessica was not sure that she wanted to relive everything that she had gone through.  Kelly contemplated that she would rather write a column with a nice, happy ending, and that she was tired of the grisly story about Robert Ford.  Again, Jessica reflected on prom night with her and Ford in bed and cried to Kelly that something had happened that night.  Kelly begged to know what had happened.  Just as Jessica tried to explain about how Brody had told her on prom night about what Mitch had done and the possible consequences, Kelly's phone rang.\n\n\nIn the hospital parking garage, as Starr was placing Hope in her car seat, Todd informed Starr that he just wanted Ford to wake up and state that Hannah had tried to kill him.  Starr asked Todd what T\u00e9a would think about Todd's belief, and Todd emphasized that since T\u00e9a was representing him, that should be the most important thing on her mind.  Starr pondered that if Hannah had committed both crimes, two of T\u00e9a's clients would be cleared.  Once Starr explained to Todd that Markko was the second client, he realized that Cole would then be the only one of them doing hard time.\n\n\nStarr refused to listen to Todd \"trash\" Cole and claimed that she had received more support from a total stranger about Cole than she ever had from Todd.  Starr reminded Todd that he should focus more on Dani.  Todd did not want to talk about Dani, so Starr and Todd declared a truce that there would be no more talk of Cole or Dani.  Todd offered a new car to Starr for her graduation, but Starr reminded Todd that he had just given her a new car for her birthday.  After Todd insisted that Starr would still get a new car, he kissed her and said, \"See you later.\"  As he walked away, Todd was unable to get a signal on his phone to call T\u00e9a.\n\n\nIn Greg's office at the hospital, T\u00e9a and Greg discussed her progress.  When Greg informed T\u00e9a that her condition had not changed significantly, T\u00e9a understood that to mean that her condition had not improved.  When Greg saw that T\u00e9a was discouraged, he reminded her that sometimes it took time for treatments to work.  Greg then asked T\u00e9a how Dani was handling T\u00e9a's condition and realized by T\u00e9a's reaction that she had not yet told DanI.  T\u00e9a explained that because Dani had been adjusting to her new life in Llanview, T\u00e9a had not wanted to \"weigh her down\" with T\u00e9a's health.  However, Greg warned T\u00e9a that Dani needed to be prepared for the worst.  \n\n\nAfter Greg's phone rang, he informed T\u00e9a that he had to leave for an emergency.  T\u00e9a requested to stay in his office, and promised not to trash it, as she had the last time.  As Greg gave his permission, he offered T\u00e9a a pamphlet to read, \"Cancer:  It's Your Journey But You Don't Have to Walk It Alone.\"  T\u00e9a silently read from the pamphlet, \"...those who know you best will probably sense that something's wrong.\"  The pamphlet also proposed that \"you should share your burden with someone you trust.\"\n\n\nOnce T\u00e9a left Greg's office, she walked to the water cooler for water to drink with her pills.  As Todd entered the hospital hall, he saw T\u00e9a with the pills and asked what was wrong with her.  To evade his question, T\u00e9a asked Todd about his case and Hannah.  Before Todd had a chance to respond, James pushed past him and ran out of the hospital.  T\u00e9a then informed Todd that she still needed proof for his case, and Todd declared that he was at the hospital to question Ford.  When T\u00e9a reminded Todd that he needed to focus on Dani, Todd vented that Dani wanted nothing to do with him.\n\n\nIn Robert Ford's hospital room, just as James started to confess something bad that he had done, since Robert was unable to hear him, Robert opened his eyes.  When Ford asked what had happened to him, James revealed that someone had tried to kill Robert.  Shortly afterwards, a nurse ran into the room and yelled that Ford's heart rate had increased.  Greg rushed into the room to examine Ford.  The nurse walked into the hall to place a call on the pay phone, when an unknown bald stranger with a beard showed her a picture of James and demanded to know if she had seen him.\n\n\nIn Ford's room, Greg told Robert that he had suffered from serious blows to his head.  However Greg said that everything looked good, but he wanted to do more testing to make sure, as James slipped out of the room.  Once James entered the hall, the bald guy with the beard chased him, but James escaped.  Greg informed Ford that he had been a lucky man, and Robert asked about James.\n\n\nAt the police station, John escorted Markko to the interrogation room, where Langston was signing a written confession.  Langston proclaimed that she could not let Markko pay for something that she had done.  Langston demanded that John and Brody arrest her; however, John first wanted to clarify her story.  John asked Langston if Ford had been facing her, as she had struck him with the statue - five times.  Langston verified that he had been, and that she had struck him five times.  When Langston asked when she would be arrested, so that Markko could be released, John informed them that there was a problem.  John indicated that he needed to call the commissioner, while Brody pulled the evidence file, and John and Brody left the interrogation room.\n\n\nOnce John and Brody left the room, Brody pointed out that Langston had not known \"which award Ford was clocked with,\" \"at what angle and how many times.\"  John revealed his strategy for them to leave the room. He felt that Markko and Langston would never tell them the truth, but that they would not lie to each other.  John turned on the intercom system.\n\n\nLangston declared to Markko that they both knew that she had not struck Ford with the statue.  Langston explained that she had only confessed to stop Markko from going to prison.  Markko asserted that Langston had only confessed to appease her guilty conscience.\n\n\nIn the other room, John observed that he knew that Markko had not tried to kill Ford.  Brody still wondered about the blood on Markko's shoes.  John believed that if Markko had really struck Ford, he would not let Langston \"take the fall.\"\n\n\nMarkko revealed to Langston that Ford had gotten what he had deserved.  However, Markko cried that, while he was not saying that he had not wanted to hurt Langston's boyfriend, that \"somebody else got there first.  Langston, I'm innocent.\"  John informed Brody that they were cutting Markko loose.\n\n\nT\u00e9a begged Todd not to give up on Dani, and Todd pointed out that the only chance he had with Dani was to be cleared of the charges.  Then T\u00e9a received a phone call that Markko had been released.  When Todd asked T\u00e9a about her pills, T\u00e9a replied that she had aspirin for a migraine headache and explained, \"I get one every time I have to defend you.\"  T\u00e9a left the hospital.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at the police station and demanded the release of her client.  Although Brody informed T\u00e9a that the paperwork was in the works, he stated that John was not going to hold Markko for obstruction of justice, because John was in a generous mood.  After T\u00e9a received the release papers, as Markko left, he said to Langston, \"We have nothing more to say to each other.  We're done.\"\n\n\nAt the Sun, Kelly answered her phone to find Todd on the line.  Before Todd could tell Kelly why he called, Kelly told Todd that Jessica was going to be a reporter at the Sun again.  Todd approved.  Todd had actually called to inform Kelly of Markko's release.  Kelly then changed the headline of the next Sun edition to \"Busboy Cleared,\" and told Jessica, \"As far as I know, the case is still wide open.  The person who tried to kill Ford is still out there.\"  Jessica declared, \"Kelly, I think I know who it was.\"\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Greg told John that Robert might not be able to recall events that had placed him in the hospital.  John entered Ford's room and informed him that he wanted to ask Robert a few questions.  When Greg saw the nurse in the hall, she mentioned that he still needed to schedule T\u00e9a's next appointment, as Todd listened at the water cooler.  After Greg and the nurse walked away, Todd entered Greg's office, searched the drawers of Greg's desk, and found T\u00e9a's file, as John asked Robert Ford who had tried to kill him.\n\n\nIn the hospital parking garage, Starr got in her car and saw that Hope was asleep in her car seat.  After Starr realized that her car would not start, she tried to call for help on her cell phone but could not get a signal.  Starr grabbed her bag, got out of her car, and reached into the back seat to take Hope out of the car seat, just as James ran into the parking garage.  James stressed that he had to leave the hospital, but Starr begged for his help.  When Starr requested that James call for help in the hospital, James stated that he would check out her car engine instead.\n\n\nStarr thanked James and asked to borrow his cell phone to key in her phone number, so that one day he could call her to repay him.  As soon as James was able to restart Starr's car, he saw the man who was chasing him.  As Starr exclaimed to James that she was very grateful, James yelled for Starr to get into the car.  After Starr jumped into the passenger seat, James screeched off, which caused her bag to fly off of the car.  Starr screamed, as the bald guy with the beard chased after them on foot and, once he could not catch them, threw his fist in the air.\n\n\n",

They hear Langston and Markko tell each other that they are innocent. John releases them both. Markko tells Langston that they are done. Starr offers Todd a ride home from the hospital, but he says he is going to wait for Ford to wale up so he can talk to him. He wonders why Tea hasn't called him. Tea is in an appointment with Dr Evans. He tells her that her tumor has not gotten any smaller. Todd goes into the hospital and Starr gets in her car to leave, but her car won't start.
