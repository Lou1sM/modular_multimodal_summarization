Spencer is caught off guard but quickly regains his composure and begins asking Margaret how she could remember something that never happened. To Bo's dismay, Spencer catches on to the set up and pumps Margaret for basic information that he knows she doesn't remember. Bo sends the guard in to rescue Margaret when she slips and informs Spencer that the police told her things. Bo catches up to her and tells her that she will be escorted to a hospital where she will get treatment and hopefully she will eventually remember what happened to her and her baby. Spencer taunts Bo about his failed attempt to have Spencer incriminate himself but on the way to the hospital, Margaret begins to get her memory back.\n\n\nAfter David's attorney warns him that he is looking at a minimum of twenty years behind bars, David is ready to play let's make deal with John. David offers to give John the goods on Spencer in exchange for him dropping the murder charge against David. John wants no part of a deal that has David going free but does say that the DA has offered to shave off a few years if David turns evidence on Spencer. John tells David that his window of opportunity is shrinking since they are also hopeful that Margaret will get her memory back. Spencer pays David a visit shortly after John leaves and assures David that he will help him in exchange for his silence but David decides to turn the tables on Spencer instead and summons Blair to his cell ready to confess all to her.\n\n\nNash and his \"ex\" business partner, Bruce, conspire to take Reston down personally and financially. Bruce warns Nash that Reston is no fool and that if he catches on to what they are doing, it won't be good for Tess or Brennan. Nash tells him that he will make sure that they are safe and that he won't rest until Reston is brought down which involves using Claudia as part of their plans. Bruce inquires as to whether Tess will want Nash backs when she finds out what he had to do to get Reston but Nash is sure that Tess will understand that he did what did for their family. \n\n\nWhile Nash is plotting revenge on Reston, Antonio asks Jessica to be his wife and to allow him to adopt Brennan so that they can raise her together. Jessica reminds Antonio that Brennan has a father but Antonio reasons that Nash has abandoned her and that once he and Jessica are married and providing for the baby, there isn't a court that would deny him parental rights. Jessica assures Antonio that she loves him and would love to be his wife and have him raise Brennan but that it is too much, too soon. She tells him that they aren't sure whether Tess is gone for good or not and even if she is, Jessica still must go through the emotional and tedious integration process which won't be easy on any of them. Antonio finally relents but promises Jessica that he is going to be there for her and Brennan.\n\n\nAdriana admits to Rex that she is still being stalked. Rex decides to use his newfound status as a P.I. to do all that he can to find out who her stalker is.

They decide to change the subject and enjoy Claudia's Capricorn debut instead. Unfortunately, they are rattled by a request that was made for the song, Butterfly, which is what the stalker has been referring to Adriana as.  \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "\"I remember,\" Margaret tells Spencer. Spencer tells her that he hasn't ever met her before and knows nothing about her. He tells the guard that he wants to speak to her alone in his office. He takes Margaret inside and asks her why she is making all this up. \"I am not making this up,\" she says. \"How could someone make up something like a baby?\" Nash wants to head home, but Bruce talks him out of it. \"Your daughter and Tess will be killed.\" Nash thinks how killing Reston will stop all of this from happening. \"We will kill his money, use his daughter. Take his power \" Bruce has another thought. \"What do you think Tess is going to think about this when she hears how you used Claudia to get what you want?\" Spencer continues to deny, deny, deny. \"I know that you faked my death,\" Margaret continues. \"I have never seen you before,\" Spencer says. \"Where did we meet?\" Bo watches the monitor seeing that things are not going as planned. \"Well the police,\" Margaret starts. \"Ah! The police?\" Spencer asks rhetorically. Bo can see that Spencer is onto Margaret now. \"Get her out of there!\" Hugh has the reports. They figure that Spencer might have signed them and if that is the case, they will have something to work with. Hugh takes the papers out of the file and hands them to John. \"Spencer didn't sign them. It's the commissioner's seal it's signed by Bo Buchanan \" Bo grabs the papers to see for himself. Margaret rides the van to the hospital. She sees a picture of herself in the paper that the medic escorting her is reading. The memories come flooding back. She remembers being pregnant rocking in her rocking chair looking at pictures of Todd Spencer ridiculing her Spencer and Paige helping her give birth A look of realization comes to her face. \"It was Spencer! It was all Spencer!\"",
