    "soap_central": "\nPomp & Circumstance\n\n\nAs Moe and Noelle happily decorated the terrace in preparation of the graduation party, Dorian, who was upset because Ray had left town, complained and criticized every detail.  Realizing that Dorian was upset over losing Ray, Moe and Noelle tried to raise her spirits, but Dorian continued to hurl insults at them.  Envious of their happy relationship, Dorian was anxious to make a fast exit.  Dorian announced that she was headed to the Palace Hotel, in search of a decent bottle of champagne for the party.\n\n\nInside La Boulaie, Starr and Cole decided to give their relationship another chance. Dorian took a detour through the living room and discovered Starr and Cole sharing a passionate kiss. Disgusted by their display of affection, Dorian suggested that the teens reconsider rekindling their relationship.  Ignoring Dorian's advice, Starr reminded Cole that his graduation ceremony was scheduled to begin in a few hours at the high school.  After giving him a kiss goodbye, Starr promised to attend the ceremony.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Viki and Charlie announced their engagement and learned that Clint and Nora were planning to wed on the same day.  Renee congratulated both couples and remarked that they should consider a double ceremony.  Dorian arrived at the Palace and was shocked to learn that both couples were engaged to be married.  Dorian sulked and directed several rude comments at them.\n\n\nReminding Dorian that she had previously booked a romantic booth for herself and Ray at the Palace, Renee commented that Dorian also had a special night ahead.  Dorian promptly informed Renee that she intended to cancel the reservation.  Dorian grimaced when a gentlemen suitor interrupted and gave Renee a gentle hug.  The gentlemen advised Renee that he wanted to reserve the booth and share a romantic night with her.  A look of disgust crossed Dorian's face, as Renee chuckled and Charlie sang, \"Love is in the air!\"  \n\n\nWhen Charlie asked Dorian if he would ever get the opportunity to meet her new guy, Dorian snapped, \"Never, if I ever have anything to say about it!\"  As Dorian stormed off, everyone joked that Dorian was alone and miserable.  Afterward, Charlie expressed guilt over laughing at Dorian's misfortune, but everyone else insisted that Dorian was the cause of her own troubles.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Blair and John went head-to-head with Todd over custody of the children.  Todd told the judge that Blair and John had only wed in an attempt to prevent Todd from gaining custody of his children.  When the judge advised Todd that he needed to provide proof to support his claim, Todd assured the judge that his surprise witness would prove that Blair and John's marriage was a scam.  Todd stated that his witness would arrive shortly.\n\n\n\n\nHoping to speak with Cole, Marty rushed inside the high school gymnasium.  Unable to locate Cole, Marty approached Rachel and asked her to inform Cole that Marty might be late for the ceremony.   Marty stated that she had received a subpoena ordering her to testify at the custody hearing on Todd's behalf.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, while Mike fed Hope, Marcie overheard a conversation between Langston and Markko.  Langston told Markko that Starr had second thoughts about giving her baby up for adoption.  A shocked Marcie listened as Langston confided in Markko that Starr had considered not signing the adoption papers.  Langston said that Starr only signed the papers because she had made a promise to Marcie.  Langston related that Starr wanted to raise her child with Cole.  While Markko expressed concern for Marcie and Michael's feelings, Langston wondered how Hope would feel once she learned that her parents had never wanted to give her up.  \n\n\nRealizing that the graduation would soon be underway, Markko and Langston decided to head to the high school. Marcie returned to Michael and Hope.  Kissing Hope goodbye, Marcie told Michael that she wanted to attend the graduation.\n\n\nBack inside the courtroom, as Todd and Blair argued relentlessly, Marty stormed into the room and demanded to know why she had been summoned to appear.  Reminding Marty that she was under oath, Todd's attorney asked Marty if she was involved in an intimate relationship with John.  Denying that she was romantically involved with John, Marty stated that John was committed to his marriage to Blair.  As Todd's lawyer attempted to pressure Marty into recanting her statement, Marty announced that her memory was vague because she had suffered a serious brain injury.  \n\n\nFed up with the confusion, the judge excused Marty and called a recess.  Marty rushed off to attend Cole's graduation.  Grateful for Marty's help, Blair suggested that John accompany her to Cole's graduation.  While Blair awaited the judge's ruling, John left to attend Cole's graduation.\n\n\nInside the high school gymnasium, as the graduates of Llanview High School's Class of 2009 prepared to march down the aisle, Cole searched the crowd for his mother.  Although he was pleased to see Starr, Cole was concerned about his mother's absence.  Both Cole and Starr were annoyed when Rachel informed them that Marty had received a subpoena-courtesy of Todd.  Starr apologized for Todd's poor judgment, but the thought of his mother missing his graduation, troubled Cole.  \n\n\nRachel asked Starr and Cole how they were handling the adoption.  As Starr and Cole confided in Rachel that they felt uncomfortable about handing their child over to the McBains, Marcie overheard the conversation.  Upon noticing Marcie, Starr immediately changed the subject and welcomed Marcie.  Insisting that she was proud of his accomplishments, Marcie congratulated Cole.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Markko's mother criticized Langston's style of dress.  Uncomfortable by Mrs. Rivera's harsh words, Langston worried that Markko's mother didn't like her.  Markko assured Langston that his mother had no concerns about their relationship.\n\n\nAs the ceremony got underway, the class of 2009 applauded as Markko, the valedictorian, gave his speech.  Marcie was moved as she listened to Markko's words and observed Starr and Cole's demeanor.  Markko stated that the graduates had matured a great deal over the past several months.  Markko related that they were capable of facing obstacles that they couldn't have handled in the past.  Unnoticed, Marcie quietly exited the gymnasium.  As Cole stepped on stage to receive his diploma, he was pleasantly surprised to see Marty and John rush into the gymnasium.  Afterward, Cole looked inside the diploma case.  His smile faded when he saw the notice inside that reminded him that he would receive his actual diploma upon completion of additional coursework.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the ceremony, as everyone congratulated the graduates, Cole told his mother and friends that he hadn't really graduated.  Insisting that they were proud of him, everyone reminded Cole that he would receive his diploma at a later date.  Claiming that he needed to be alone, Cole said that he would meet everyone at the graduation party later.  \n\n\nMarty, Starr, and John were concerned as Cole walked away.  Marty asked Rachel if Cole would be okay.  Stating that Cole had experienced a difficult day, Rachel told Marty that Cole would have to learn to deal with the difficult days.  Later, Marty thanked John for attending the ceremony and supporting Cole.  Marty was concerned that Cole appeared lost.\n\n\nLater, Cole peered inside the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, and spotted Michael reading Patrick's book of poems to Hope.  Unable to watch his daughter with Michael, a devastated Cole ran off.    Marcie entered the caf\u00e9 and approached Michael.  Near tears, Marcie stared at Hope and announced that she had something to tell Michael.\n\n\nCole walked along the pier and tossed his graduation cap into the river.  As he looked down at the diploma cover, Asher appeared.  With a sly look, Asher remarked, \"Long time, no see!\"\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Dorian remained in a foul mood.  Shaun did his best to help Dorian deal with her pain.  Pleased by Shaun's concern for her, Dorian apologized for her behavior.  Commenting that everyone was displaying their love lives for all to see, Dorian thanked Shaun for keeping his relationship discreet.  At that moment, Rachel entered and thanked Shaun for inviting her over.  Upon learning that Shaun and Rachel were dating, a disgusted Dorian hissed and walked away.\n\n\nAs Dorian stepped out on the terrace, she spotted Langston and Markko in a loving embrace.  Unable to contain her resentment any longer, Dorian screamed and shattered her champagne glass with her bare hand.\n\n\nStarr rushed into the house hoping to find Cole.  When the doorbell chimed, Starr raced to the door.  Starr was stunned when she opened the door and discovered Marcie and Hope.  As she held Hope in her arms, Marcie smiled at Starr.\n\n\nInside the courtroom, Todd's lawyer warned him that he would lose the case unless he could provide solid proof that Blair and John conspired to defraud him.  Todd informed his lawyer that he had another witness who could back up his claim.  When asked why he hadn't presented the witness earlier, Todd stated that he wasn't sure if he wanted to drag the person into his legal problems.  The lawyer advised Todd to come up with his mystery witness before it was too late.\n\n\nThe judge returned and announced that he was ready to rule.   Pointing toward the door, Todd interrupted and stated that he had another witness.  A look of shock crossed Blair's face as she snarled, \"Todd, you bastard!\"\n\n\n",
