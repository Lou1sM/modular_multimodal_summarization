They all agree that the document must have been Spencer's back up just in case Todd was saved from execution. Unfortunately since the document is official, Hugh informs Bo that should it get out then it will appear that Bo railroaded Todd especially since Evangeline's argument was that the police didn't even consider any other suspects. Bo is prepared to turn in his badge and have John run the station should another piece of \"evidence\" turn up. He sends John to forensics with the phony document to see if they can determine what they are up against. \n\n\nBlair listens intently to David's story of how Spencer set up Todd. He tells her how Paige helped deliver the baby and how Spencer took Margaret to Thailand where she was found. Blair can't believe that Paige would have helped Spencer and then kept quiet even when Todd was sentenced to die. David says that Paige had no choice since Spencer was blackmailing her with incriminating evidence that points to Bo as being the one who set up Todd. Blair doesn't let on to David that she believes him deciding instead to handle things on her own. She goes to Bo and tells him all that David said to her. Bo insists that she stay out of it since Spencer is a dangerous man but Blair has her own ideas.\n\n\nAs Margaret is on her way to the hospital, she begins to have flashes of memories about events leading up to her disappearance. At first they are incoherent flashes, but as more memories come flooding back she begins to piece things together. Margaret remembers how Todd wanted her dead, how Spencer came up with a plan to bring Margaret and Todd together but instead he wanted Todd dead. She remembers delivering her baby and confronting Spencer about his sinister plans. Margaret pleads with her escorts to take her back to the police station so that she can tell them what happened and get her baby back but they just insist she is crazy. Eventually they call Bo to tell him that Margaret is insisting that she be brought back since she now has her memory back. On the way back to the station, they get into an accident and the van turns over.\n\n\nSpencer checks in on Todd and taunts him about Blair. Todd tells Spencer that his relationship with Blair is built on a house of cards which will come tumbling down soon since Blair is starting to become suspicious of Spencer. Spencer tells Todd that Blair needs the kind of stability that he can provide and the only thing that Todd can provide for her is closure. They are interrupted by Starr, who has come to visit her father. She asks Todd what happened between he and Spencer but Todd refuses to talk. As they are enjoying ice cream together Blair stops by. Todd yells at her to leave and when Blair asks why he goes over all the times in the past few months that she has let him down and swears that they are through. A hurt Blair leaves and runs into Spencer. She tells how David told her everything and then goes on to tell a pleased Spencer how she defended him to David.\n\n\nJessica and Antonio's romantic moment is interrupted by Jessica's flashes of Tess and Nash. She apologizes to Antonio and becomes even more convinced that until she begins integration, she will always be afraid of Tess coming back. Antonio tells Jessica how Tess has changed and leaned on Jessica more than she realizes. Jessica decides that she needs to face what happened to her as a child if she, Antonio, and Brennan are to have any kind of future together. Antonio lets it slip that he knows what happened to her as a child and Jessica insists that he tell her but he refuses stating that the doctor advised them that it is up to Jessica to remember and face the incident. Jessica decides that she is going to begin the integration process the next day.\n\n\nNash takes Claudia down memory lane to loosen her up so that he can tell her about his business proposal. Claudia is skeptical but hears him out as he reminds her how they dreamed about owning a vineyard together and then shows her the pictures of the vineyard he wants her to invest in. Claudia is insulted that Nash thinks her a fool but Nash insists that he is being honest with her including where his heart lies with Tess and their baby. He tells her that by investing in the vineyard she will be asserting her independence and showing him that they can be friends, maybe not the best of friends but friends nonetheless. Claudia decides to think about it while Nash secretly apologizes for how he is about to use her to ensure the safety of his family.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Margaret's memories come flooding back. She remembers everything now as she sits in the back of the van and she realizes what Spencer has done to her. She now talks as if she is the Margaret who she was before. \"Don't worry mommy's coming,\" she promises her child wherever he is. \"And mommy is going to get daddy back!\" The signature on the reports Bo's signature on it. He finds it even hard to deny that it really is his signature. Whoever has done this is ingenious. This turns the focus on Bo now. Bo has been after Spencer from the start and now it looks like he fixed the case so that Truman might end up guilty. \"If anything else shows up that is incriminating,\" Bo says. \"I will turn in my badge.\" David confesses everything to Blair. He tells her about Margaret, Paige's and what Bo's involvement. Blair plays the act of loyal girlfriend, saying that she will not believe anything that David says. He has no proof. She runs back to Bo who is angry to see that Blair is still working on the case when he told her to forget about it. \"David confessed everything to me,\" she reveals. Spencer finds Blair in the hall of the hospital. \"I thought that you were with Jack.\" Blair says she wasn't. \"I lied. I wasn't with Jack.\" Spencer looks at her shocked. \"You lied to me?\" She admits it. \"I was with David. He told me everything.\" Margaret pushes the medics and finally they call the commissioner to tell him that Margaret remembers everything. Bo tells Hugh and John that they have a big break in the case. Margaret shouts at the driver to hurry and get her back to Bo. The driver looks at Margaret and the van swerves and crashes. Margaret is unconscious with blood coming out of her nostrils after the crash.",
