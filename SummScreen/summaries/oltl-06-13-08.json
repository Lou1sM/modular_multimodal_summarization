    "soap_central": "\nTornado Afraid \u2013 Oh!\n\n\n \nOutside of Ramsey's penthouse building, Tina jumped into the limousine with John following close behind. Jonas questioned Tina about what had taken place upstairs, but she pleaded with him to have the driver take off immediately because someone was after her. John reached the fire escape landing and fired a warning shot in the air; he ordered the driver to turn off the engine. A terrified Tina watched as Jonas pulled out a gun and fired a shot-striking John in the chest. As the limo pulled off, an injured John observed the license plate. Badly injured, John struggled to stand up but couldn't. He attempted to call for help on his cell phone, but the phone was inoperable. John managed to stop the bleeding, but remained virtually helpless on the fire escape. \n\n\nBack inside the limo, Tina questioned why Jonas would shoot a police officer but Jonas demanded answers from her. Jonas wanted to know what was in the case that Tina had retrieved from the penthouse. When Tina refused to cooperate, Jonas pointed the gun at her and ordered her to hand him the mysterious case. As Tina and Jonas struggled over the case, Tina hit Jonas. Tina jumped out of the limo and ran towards Angel Square Park-with the case filled with the jewels. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, Sarah and Cris discussed the song that she was preparing for Nash's funeral. Sarah was having a hard time accepting Nash's death because she never got the opportunity to tell him how much she valued their friendship. Cris told Sarah that perhaps Nash's death was a wake- up call and they should start expressing their true feelings to their loved ones. Cris's words gave Sarah an idea for her salute to Nash. In an instant, Sarah began to create her tribute to Nash. Cris smiled as Sarah sang to him. \n\n\nJonas took off after Tina. Cris left Sarah's side and headed off to grab a hotdog. As Sarah sat alone in the park, she heard her mother call her name. Upon his return, Cris found a frightened Sarah. When Cris stated that Sarah looked as if she had seen a ghost, Sarah informed him that she believed she had heard one. \n\n\nWhile hiding out in the park with David Vickers, the dog, Tina remained quiet as she observed Jonas approach Sarah and Cris. Holding Sarah and Cris at gunpoint, Jonas demanded to know if they had seen a woman with a dog and gave them a description of Tina. When Jonas left, Sarah told Cris that she believed that she had heard her mother's voice. The sight of Sarah appeared to have an emotional effect on Tina. \n\n\nJonas told someone over the phone that he would get the jewels back. \n\n\nTodd discovered Marty inside of one of the bedrooms in Lee Ramsey's penthouse. A disoriented Marty pleaded with Todd not to harm her. Todd assured Marty that he wouldn't hurt her, but Marty was afraid because she had heard the gunshots. Unable to stand, Marty warned Todd to stay away from her. Amazed to discover that Marty didn't recognize him, Todd questioned what had happened to her. Marty related that she had suffered a serious brain injury and didn't remember anything from her past-only Lee and Janet, her nurse. Meanwhile downstairs, Keys examined the crime scene. Seconds later, Janet appeared in the doorway and screamed when she saw the dead bodies of Lee and the doorman sprawled on the living room floor. Keys jumped out of his hiding place and tried to explain the situation to Janet. Fearing the real killer could be nearby, Keys placed his hands over Janet's mouth and tried to convince her to cooperate. \n\n\nUpon hearing Janet's screams, Marty began to panic and demanded to know what was taking place downstairs. Todd said that he would check things out and asked Marty to stay put. Alone, Marty dragged her limp body across the floor and pulled herself back onto the bed. Grasping the picture of her and John, Marty had a flashback of Ramsey telling her that the photo always managed to calm her nerves. \n\n\nDownstairs, Janet examined the dead bodies and stated that she was going to call the police. Todd appeared and told her that the police could not be involved. As Janet attempted to check on Marty, Todd blocked her way and made her an offer. She could either accept a large sum of money to work for him or he would have Keys cause her great bodily harm. Janet informed Todd that he would have to kill her because she had no intention of helping him. Janet related that she had a duty to care for Marty because she was a nurse. Janet pleaded with Todd to allow her to help Marty and advised him that she needed twenty-four hour medical care. Impressed with Janet's bravery, Todd asked if anyone else knew about Marty and stated that he wanted to take Marty somewhere else and care for her. Todd suggested that Janet consider being his employee and continue to provide Marty with medical care. Cornered, Janet agreed. \n\n\nWhen the police arrived to assist John, he provided them with the license plate number of the fleeing limo. John managed to stumble up to the penthouse, but found only Todd on the premises. Todd hid Marty's picture from John. John didn't believe Todd's excuse and vowed to find out the truth. \n\n\nKeys carried an unconscious Marty off into the night. \n\n\nAt LaBoulaie, Langston and Markko entered the kitchen. Langston was in a fit of hysterics as Markko sprayed her with his water gun. Starr and Cole warned the happy couple to lower their voices before they disturbed a sleeping Sam. Starr and Cole told Langston and Markko about the difficult time they had with Sam earlier and how Marcie calmed the child down. Langston was shocked that Starr would let Marcie anywhere near Sam. Everyone was surprised by Starr's defense of Marcie. Starr stated how good Marcie had been to Sam and expressed her regret that Marcie couldn't have children of her own or adopt. When Starr stated how she and Cole had no idea how to handle Sam's tantrum, Markko quickly reminded them that they would soon have a child of their own. As the conversation turned to Starr's pregnancy, Starr appeared bothered but Cole was delighted to discuss their child. Starr suggested that everyone go out and enjoy themselves, instead of worrying about her pregnancy. When her friends suggested that they all take a ride on the exciting new roller coaster that was at the local carnival, Starr informed them that she had an appointment with her OB-GYN and reminded them that she couldn't ride on a roller coaster in her pregnant state. \n\n\nLater, alone with Langston, Starr confided to her friend that she didn't think she was ready to have a child and wanted to place the baby up for adoption. Langston was worried because Starr had not discussed her decision with Cole.\n\n\n",
