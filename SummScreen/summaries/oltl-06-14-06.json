The driver is killed but the aides survive and one of them begins CPR after calling for an ambulance.\n\n\nBo and John await Margaret's return so that she can tell them all she has remembered about her past. Evangeline also shows up, along with Rex who is there to tell Bo about Adriana's stalker. When Rex mentions that he heard about the crash, the police officers take off for the scene of the accident while Evangeline heads to the hospital to see Todd. Bo also calls Blair to let her know of Margaret's returned memory and advises her not to say anything to Spencer. He promises to hear about Adriana's problem upon his return.\n\n\nSpencer, who is standing with Blair when she receives Bo's call, tries to find out what the call is about and why Blair is suddenly so intent on getting into Todd's room.  Starr is with her dad who is very sleepy and needs to rest. He sends his daughter on her way after advising her to be nice to her mother and refuses to see her himself. Todd dreams of getting out of bed, searching for Blair, and reconnecting with her. Marcie and Michael prepare for Tommy's visit to the pediatrician. R.J. and Matthew visit with Nora who refuses to talk after her stroke because of being embarrassed for what she sounds like. R.J. has a plan; they decline to acknowledge her hand motions and stares and encourage her to speak instead. When Lindsay shows up as she has all year, R.J. takes her out to the hallway and persuades her to stay away because Nora won't converse in front of her. \n\n\nThe pediatrician reassures an insecure Marcie, who has pages of questions about her charge, that she's doing a great job. Spencer continues to question Blair on her phone call, along with her changed attitude towards him. She just seems different, he claims. When Evangeline arrives and mentions the fact that Margaret is ready to spill it all, Spencer realizes that Bo was calling about that very thing, especially when Blair doesn't seem quite as surprised as she should. He sees that Bo didn't want him to know anything about it. R.J. returns to Nora's room and announces that he's not leaving until she speaks, even if he has to stay all night. She does begin to talk and is grateful to R.J. for helping her. Evangeline breaks the news to Todd, both of Margaret's recollections and of the accident.  It dawns on him why Blair was so anxious to see him. He wonders if she's coming around about Spencer now. He also cannot think about forgiving her just yet. Spencer and Blair learn of the van accident and head for the ER as Margaret is wheeled in.  Her heart stops and she's brought back. Everyone hopes that she makes it for many reasons; everyone but Spencer. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair is with Spencer. He hugs her until her phone starts ringing. She sees that Bo is trying to reach her. She takes the call and when she ends it, Spencer is on her about it. She tries to go to Todd's room but the Head Nurse stops her telling that she isn't allowed in the room. Spencer overrides her order and then demands to know why Blair needs to talk to Todd right after talking to Bo. One of the orderlies wakes and tends to the others. The other orderly is fine but the driver is dead. The man jumps to Margaret's aid after calling the accident in. Rex arrives at Bo's office and tells that he has heard about a crash and Margaret's name was mentioned as the patient in the ambulance. John and Bo rush to the crash site and order the meds to make sure that they keep her alive. Evangeline shows up at the hospital. She tells Spencer and Blair that Margaret remembers everything. \"I need to talk to Todd,\" she says. Spencer says that Todd is resting right now. She says that this news is worth waking Todd up. \"Don't you think?\" She and the Head Nurse walk by Spencer and Blair and enter the room. Margaret is brought into the hospital and John and Bo are right behind her. They hear the monitors scream. \"Code blue!\" someone shouts! Spencer and Blair have come to the ER now and they wait with John and Bo for more developments. \"Is she going to make it Bo?\" Blair asks. \"She has to,\" he says. \" For a lot of reasons.\" He glares over at Spencer who paces in a corner. Todd is delirious over the idea that Margaret is going to come forward. They don't know what she will reveal yet but one can only hope. \"|Everyone knows that he is guilty everyone but Blair,\" Todd says. \"I am going to show that crazy bitch what Spencer's really about.",
