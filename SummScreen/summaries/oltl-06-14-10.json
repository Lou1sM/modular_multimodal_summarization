He explained that he was in a mess and calling in the cops would only make things worse.  Starr realized that her purse and cell phone had been on the roof of the car when James commandeered it.  He left angrily because she wouldn't listen to his story.  Starr tried to go back for her belongings but the car wouldn't start.  \n\n\nStarr took Hope and began to follow James as he walked back to the quarry.  Starr reiterated her threat to turn James in to the police, and he stormed off in the opposite direction.  She followed him back to the car.  As he worked on starting the engine, Starr asked why a man was chasing James.  He replied that he has something the man wanted and told her he wouldn't divulge any more information so as not to involve Starr any more than he already had.  \n\n\nJames got the car working again and advised Starr to take it to a repair shop immediately.  He wished her luck with her boyfriend and hoped he wouldn't soon be sharing a jail cell with him.  She promised that she'd call the cops once she got into town.  James promised to fix things and hoped that he'd see Starr again.  She told him she doubted it but seemed to wish they would.  James headed back to the quarry.\n\n\nDavid walked in to find a depressed Matthew, distracting himself with junk food and violent movies.  Matthew said that he just wanted to be left alone but David wouldn't let him mope.  Matthew admitted that Dani had dumped him.  David chastised Matthew for having told Dani he loved her and for not having sex with her when she tried to initiate it.  Matthew bitterly stated that Dani had dumped him to be with Nate Salinger.  However, he felt bad because he had been in Dani's situation when Destiny had been attracted to him and he'd had to tell her the feeling was not mutual.  \n\n\nDavid assured Matthew that Dani would be back, but Matthew didn't believe it.  Then David bad-mouthed Dani until Matthew defended her and told him that he still loved her.  David asked \"WWPD, what would Pa do?\"  He figured -- mistakenly -- that Bo would take Matthew fishing or give him a drink.  David came up with a plan and told Matthew to go take a shower.  He then called a woman he knew and arranged to show Matthew a good time.  After they were both dressed up for a night on the town, two beautiful young women showed up to be their dates.\n\n\nDani came upon a shirtless Nate at the quarry.  Nate sensed that something had happened between Dani and Matthew since Destiny had caught her and Nate kissing and had threatened to expose them.  Dani told Nate that she'd broken her best friend's heart.  She lamented hurting Matthew and said that she was just like Todd Manning.  Nate apologized for causing the rift, but Dani explained that she just wasn't ready for a boyfriend.  Nate seemed disappointed.  \n\n\nThey both decided to stop talking about it and have some fun by diving off the cliff.  After swimming, Nate took credit for making Dani laugh.  But she started to reminisce about a simpler time, in Tahiti, when her life had been more stable.  The two shared another kiss.  Dani realized that she'd lost the necklace that her dad, Ross, had given her.  She found it, but not before Nate, helping to search for the jewelry, uncovered a case hidden under debris.  \n\n\nDani wanted to open it, but Nate said that they should treat it like something found at an airport, as it could be booby-trapped.  Dani opened the case anyway to discover thousands of dollars in cash.  As Dani and Nate left the quarry, James arrived, looking for the case.  He found it, but it was empty and he became very agitated.  Nate and Dani walked to town with the money in Nate's backpack.\n\n\nBlair found Todd snooping through T\u00e9a's medical chart in Greg's office and confronted him.  Blair reminded him that he was out on bail and that violating a patient's confidentiality was a crime.  Todd was suspicious of Blair and T\u00e9a's newfound friendship, but Blair denied that they were hiding any secrets.  Todd threatened to stay in the office until he knew what T\u00e9a was hiding.  Blair told him to ask T\u00e9a as Todd began to piece together what had been going on.  \n\n\nBlair finally admitted that she did know something but threatened to make a scene and get Todd arrested again.  Todd asked her point-blank if T\u00e9a was sick, and Blair responded that she was dying, that she had an inoperable brain tumor in the final stages of cancer.  She also shared that Dani hadn't been told either.  Todd stated that he'd take over the medical case and hire the best doctors available.  Blair told Todd that he couldn't fix the situation and cautioned him not to steamroll over T\u00e9a's wishes.  She tearfully urged him to make peace with Dani.\n\n\nJohn questioned Ford, who replied that there were a lot of people who'd want to dance on his grave and that he didn't know who'd attacked him.  John asked him if he'd seen Langston that night, if Markko had walked in on them, if they'd had a fight, and Ford answered yes to all three questions.  Ford wondered about Karen, the pizza girl, and John replied that she'd stated she didn't care enough about Ford to try to kill him.  Ford seemed surprised by that.  John asked Ford to make a list of everyone who might want to kill him.  \n\n\nFord began to remember that Jessica had been at the apartment that night, but he kept it to himself.  John suspected that Ford was withholding information.  John then asked a nurse if anyone had visited Ford, and she answered that his brother had been there but had left in a hurry when another man arrived.  John renewed questioning Ford, who told John to leave his brother James alone.  John called in a request to headquarters, and asked if they had a James Ford in the system.\n\n\nJessica admitted to Kelly that she feared she was the one who attacked Ford.  She told Kelly that she'd been with Ford earlier that night.  Jess shared that, after Brody had told her that Mitch had tried to rape her, she went to find Cristian because she was set on him taking her perceived virginity.  But only Ford had been at the apartment.  True to form, he'd hit on Jessica, and pretended to be supportive of her.  She'd fallen for his charms, and the two had ended up in bed together, but she'd freaked out, thinking Ford was Mitch.  Jess didn't remember anything until she was at Clint's house, and all her previous memories had come flooding back.  Kelly tried to get Jessica to believe that it might not have been her just as John arrived. \n\n\n",
