Marcie asked to speak to Starr in private, and the two relocated to Starr's bedroom.  Placing Hope in Starr's arms, Marcie stated that there was a problem.  Assuming that Marcie feared that Todd would attempt to obtain custody of Hope, Starr reminded Marcie that the adoption papers were already signed and that Hope was Marcie's baby.\n\n\nStarr insisted that she thought Marcie was the best possible mother for her baby.  Marcie wondered if Starr had changed her mind.  Cradling Hope in her arms, Starr insisted that she was satisfied with the decision that she had made.  Maintaining that Starr would one day regret her decision, Marcie assured Starr that she had matured and was ready to take on the responsibility of raising her daughter.   Marcie stunned Starr by declaring that she would support Starr if Starr decided to raise Hope.    Returning Hope to Marcie, Starr argued that she had made Marcie a promise and felt that reneging on that promise would make her a horrible person.\n\n\nCiting all her blessings, Marcie was adamant that she had everything in her life that she needed.  Marcie stated that her life would be fine regardless of whether she was ever blessed with a child.  Smiling at Hope, Starr admitted the terrible void that existed in her life without the little girl.  Marcie placed Hope back in Starr's arms and said, \"Your mommy has been waiting a very long time for this!\"\n\n\nMarcie tore up the adoption papers and assured Starr that Hope was her daughter forever.  After giving both Starr and Hope a loving kiss, Marcie stated that she loved them.  Marcie thanked Starr for giving her back her life.  Insisting that they were even, Starr cried as she held her baby girl.\n\n\nAsher confronted Cole at the pier.  After revealing that the drug charges against him had been dropped, Asher bragged about supplying Lola with drugs on prom night.  As Asher offered to provide Cole with drugs, Marty phoned her son.  Cole ignored the call and informed Asher that he no longer used drugs.  Attempting to tempt Cole into accepting the drugs, Asher mentioned Cole's failure to graduate and remarked about Cole losing his daughter.   \n\n\nDisplaying a bag of drugs, Asher insisted that he was only trying to help Cole.  Slapping Asher's hand away, Cole said that he no longer relied on drugs.  Cole related that he would never hurt Starr by using drugs again.    Asher placed the bag of pills inside Cole's pocket and walked away.\n\n\nAlone on the pier, Cole thought about the promise that he had made to Starr about turning his life around.  As Cole attempted to toss the bag of drugs in the river, a policeman appeared and retrieved the plastic bag.  Cole was arrested for possession of drugs.\n\n\nOn the patio at La Boulaie, Dorian shattered her champagne glass after observing Langston and Markko kissing.  Moe and Noelle offered to help her, but Dorian shooed them away and placed several pills in her mouth.  As Dorian continued to drink alcohol, Markko's parents arrived and greeted her.  After mistaking the Riveras for servants, Dorian directed several insulting comments at them.    The Riveras spoke highly of Langston and mentioned that they wanted to meet her Uncle Ray.   Immediately, Dorian flew into a rage and began badmouthing Ray for leaving town.   \n\n\nAlthough Langston tried to prevent Dorian from airing the family's dirty laundry, Dorian continued to make negative statements about Ray and Lola.  When the Riveras began asking questions about Lola, Dorian took the opportunity to enlighten the couple about Lola poking holes into the condoms that she had given Langston to use on prom night.   Appalled to learn that Markko and Langston were involved in a sexual relationship, the Riveras announced that they were leaving and dragged Markko away.\n\n\nLangston accused Dorian of ruining Markko's party because she was miserable over losing Ray.  Reminding Dorian that the Riveras were extremely religious, Langston blamed Dorian for interfering in Langston's relationship with Markko.  Refusing to admit guilt, Dorian continued to drink and argue with Langston.  When Moe attempted to interfere and accused Dorian of damaging his home, Dorian proudly announced that she had legally reclaimed ownership of La Boulaie.  When Shaun defended Moe, Dorian fired Shaun and ordered him to leave.  Instructing Moe and Noelle to pack their bags, Dorian informed the couple that she was evicting them.\n\n\nDisgusted by Dorian's behavior, Langston told Dorian that she was behaving like a monster.  Langston tried to console Dorian, but Dorian refused her support.  Unable to reason with Dorian, Langston lashed out at her and accused Dorian of hurting the people in her life who cared about her.  As a frustrated Langston emptied the champagne bottle, Dorian tried to stop her and landed in the pool.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside, the Riveras expressed their anger over Markko ignoring their strict religious beliefs and criticized Dorian for supplying Langston with condoms.     As Langston walked into the room, Mrs. Rivera forbade Markko from seeing Langston ever again.  Langston begged the Riveras to reconsider, but they refused.  An infuriated Langston glared at Dorian, who slowly pulled herself out of the pool.\n\n\nInside the Llanview courthouse, Todd announced that his witness had arrived. Hobbling in the courtroom on a cane, T\u00e9a couldn't believe that Todd would put her in such a position.  As Todd approached her, T\u00e9a informed him that she could be disbarred if she testified on his behalf.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a took the stand, Todd's lawyer asked if T\u00e9a had advised Blair and John to marry in an attempt to prevent Todd from gaining custody of the children.   T\u00e9a denied any involvement and claimed attorney-client privilege, but Todd's attorney had another trick up his sleeve.  After motioning for Todd's approval, his lawyer announced that he wanted to submit a tape as evidence to support Todd's claim.    Everyone listened in silence as the lawyer played a tape in which T\u00e9a confessed to Todd that she was responsible for Blair and John getting married.  In disbelief, T\u00e9a glared at Todd and exclaimed, \"You bastard, you taped me!\"\n\n\nUpon hearing the confession, Blair's attorney asked T\u00e9a if she had engaged in a sexual relationship with Todd while employed as Blair's attorney.  When T\u00e9a disputed the allegation, Blair blurted out that T\u00e9;a had admitted to sleeping with Todd and that T\u00e9a had also stated that he was the love of her life.  The revelation brought a devilish smile upon Todd's face.   Todd was further shocked when T\u00e9a announced that Blair had claimed that Todd was the love of her life, also.  Todd gave both ladies a sly grin.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Blair argued openly in court.  After announcing that he would report T\u00e9a's actions to the bar, the judge called a brief recess.  Exiting the stand, T\u00e9a told Todd that he was responsible for causing her to be disbarred.  Promising to fix the situation, Todd smiled and asked T\u00e9;a if she had really admitted that he was the love of her life.  Swinging her cane at him, T\u00e9a growled, \"Not anymore!\"  After T\u00e9a stormed out of the courtroom, Todd turned his sights on Blair.\n\n\nTodd taunted Blair and told her that she had lost the case.  A self-confident Todd asked Blair if she had actually stated that he was the love of her life.  Before Blair could respond, the judge returned and announced that he had made a decision.  Chastising both Todd and Blair, the judge stated that they were hurting their children by dragging out the custody case.  \n\n\nThe judge announced that he was granting custody to them both.  The judge ordered them to live under the same roof with their children.  Ordering them to place their children's needs ahead of their own, the judge informed the Mannings that their children would be sent to foster care if Todd or Blair defied his court order.  Blair wondered how they would handle the situation.    Declaring that he would never live at La Boulaie with Dorian, Todd suggested that Blair pack and return to his house.\n\n\nAs Todd exited the courtroom, T\u00e9a clobbered him in the leg with her cane.  Grabbing a head full of Todd's hair, T\u00e9a remarked, \"Not so fast!\"\n\n\nBlair returned to La Boulaie and was shocked to find Starr holding Hope.  In tears, Starr exclaimed, \"She's mine, mom! Hope is home!\" \n\n\n",
