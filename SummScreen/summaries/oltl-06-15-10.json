Rex explained to Natalie  that he and Gigi were going to try to make their relationship work again but expressed doubts.  Gigi overheard Natalie tell Rex that everything would work out.  She walked in and said she'd been ready for their first date since high school.\n\n\nDavid greeted Fawn and Wendy, two beautiful young women, at the door and introduced them to Matthew.  Matthew told David that he wasn't sure if he was ready to go out.  David asked him if he wanted to be Clint, \"the guy who gets dumped\", or Asa, \"the guy who gets an upgrade .\"  Matthew chose to emulate Asa.  He worried about his age but decided to throw caution to the wind, and they all left together.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Blair confronted David, who had bought champagne for Matthew.  Rex and Gigi arrived and Rex surprised her with vodka sours, which was the first cocktail she'd ever made.  Rex made a toast, \"to the new first.\"  Later, at the bar, David paid Wendy to have sex with Matthew.  Rex confronted her and made it clear that he knew that her name wasn't really Wendy and suggested to David that she was charging too much for her services.\n\n\nRex threatened to tell Bo and warned Wendy to leave.  He also promised that he'd call the cops if she went to Ultra Violet.  After she left, Rex chastised David for pandering, but David defended his actions because Matthew needed to get over Dani.  At the table, Matthew told Fawn about his recent breakup.  Fawn assured him that Dani would regret losing him.  Wendy told Fawn that she had to leave, and they exited together.\n\n\nDavid returned to the table, ushered Matthew out of the bar, and said that he'd forget all about Dani before the evening was over.  Rex returned to his table and Gigi admitted that she'd told Fawn that Matthew was the police commissioner's son.  They both agreed that Matthew was too young to be involved with women of questionable morals.\n\n\nBack home, Matthew realized that their dates had been prostitutes.  He thanked David, and said him it was the nicest thing anyone had done for him in a long time.  David surprised Matthew with \"Plan B.\"  Fawn and Wendy emerged and David handed Matthew a condom as Fawn led Matthew into the bedroom.\n\n\nJohn walked into Kelly's office just as Jessica told her that she feared she'd been the one who attacked Ford.  He sensed something was up and informed them that Ford had awakened.  Jessica froze when John asked her if she knew anything about the attack.  Kelly helped Jessica avoid answering by asking John if there'd been any news on Melinda's murder investigation.  He replied that it was just a waiting game and promised to keep Kelly abreast of the investigation.  John left to go back to the police station.\n\n\nBlair called T\u00e9a to tell her that Todd had viewed her medical chart and had become aware that she was dying -- just as Todd entered T\u00e9a's room.  She demanded that Todd leave, but he declared that he wouldn't just stand by and let her die.  T\u00e9a began to suffer the effects of the radiation treatment and had Todd give her a bottle of pills from her purse.\n\n\nTodd offered to accompany T\u00e9a to her next doctor's visit.  She admitted that Blair had been taking her to appointments, and Todd was angered that T\u00e9a would lean on Blair but not share her condition with him.  T\u00e9a told Todd that he needed to focus on his legal battles because he'd need to be there for Dani once T\u00e9a was gone.\n\n\nT\u00e9a defended her decision not to tell Dani what was going on because Dani was beginning to enjoy life in Llanview.  Todd explained that Dani would feel guilty for feeling any joy once she learned that her mother was dying.  He said that it felt as if T\u00e9a must have hated him and Dani to keep something that important from them.  T\u00e9a countered that she feared what was going to happen.  Todd said that it was going to be ugly and messy but that he'd be by her side every step of the way.\n\n\nT\u00e9a shared all of the things she still wanted to do in her life but explained that all she'd have time to do would be to tell Dani goodbye.  Todd promised that he'd find a way to cure T\u00e9a and told her he loved her.\n\n\nNatalie called John at his office and they agreed to meet at the Buenos Dias.  Before she left Llanfair, Kelly and Jessica walked in.  Jess began to admit something to Natalie but Kelly cut her off, and reported that Jess had taken back her old job at the Sun<.i >.\n\n\nNat left, leaving Kelly and Jessica to argue over whether Jess should tell anyone that she suspected she'd attacked Ford.  Jessica worried that Tess or Bess had emerged and had done the deed.  Kelly assured her that, since neither alters had surfaced after Mitch attacked her, they probably hadn't come out when her memories of the attack returned.\n\n\nJessica argued that she should still go to the police because she was likely the last person to have seen Ford before he was attacked and could possibly provide clues.  Kelly continued to urge that Jess not go to the police and suggested that she see Dr. Levin.  It suddenly dawned on Jessica that she'd have to tell Brody that she'd jumped into bed with a stranger.\n\n\nDani and Nate made their way to the Buenos Dias.  Dani said she felt that everyone was watching them, as if everyone knew they had a backpack full of cash.  Nate wondered if they should keep the money for themselves.  Dani was resistant and said she didn't need it.  Nate told her that he did, for his mom.  He explained that his mom had been laid off and that they'd been unable to pay the mortgage.\n\n\nDani was concerned that keeping the money could be a risk.  When John and Natalie walked into the caf\u00e9, Nate offered to give the cash to him right then.  Dani changed her mind and suggested that Nate should give the money to his mother.  Nate said he'd watch the news to see if there was a report about missing money before making a decision.  Dani said she'd be okay with whatever he decided and kissed him on the cheek before she left the caf\u00e9.\n\n\nAt another table, John shared with Natalie that he might have to question Jessica because she'd been hanging around Ford's apartment and  trying to get close to Cristian.  Natalie replied that Jessica and Ford did not have a relationship but that he'd hit on her once.  John felt that Jessica seemed overly concerned about the attack.  Natalie tried to explain away John's suspicions before they left the caf\u00e9 together.\n\n\nBlair met Eli at Capricorn and admitted that she'd told Todd about T\u00e9a's condition.  She feared what Todd might do after confronting T\u00e9a.  Eli offered to go see T\u00e9a, but Blair reminded him that T\u00e9a didn't know Eli was aware of her condition.  Blair suggested that she'd call T\u00e9a in a bit to check in.  Eli declared that it was probably a good thing that Todd had discovered the truth because it would force T\u00e9a to come clean with Dani.\n\n\nDani returned home to find T\u00e9a and Todd snuggling on the couch.  Todd announced that T\u00e9a had something to tell her, but T\u00e9a only shared that Markko had been released and that all of the charges against him had been dropped.  She explained away Todd's presence by telling Dani he was there for an interview about the case.  Dani noticed that T\u00e9a had been crying but accepted her explanation that they were tears of relief.  Dani went to bed and Todd reiterated to T\u00e9a that he'd be available whenever he was needed.\n\n\n",
