Clint refused to take Matthew's heart, and he was sure that no other heart would surface. Viki was surprised to learn that he seemed ready to die, knowing full well that he might never see Jessica again. He was sure that Jessica would return soon.\n\n\nViki talked about how blessed they had been to have all of their children, and Clint agreed. \"Even Rex?\" Viki asked. Clint wanted nothing to do with Rex. He told Viki about the heated words he'd shared with Rex when Rex had visited. Viki believed it was a gift that Rex had wanted to share his life and family with Clint. Clint only thought that Rex had wanted to \"get in good\" with Clint for the money. Disgusted, Viki thought that if Clint couldn't see how lucky he was to get another chance with Rex, \"it really is too late.\"\n\n\nClint wondered where the orderlies were to take him for more tests. Changing the subject back, Viki didn't feel that Clint should have nothing to say to Rex. Clint related that, if Rex visited again, Clint would tell him to leave. Aggravated, Viki wanted to leave to find the orderlies. She feared that if she stayed, she would say something that she'd regret.\n\n\nTess and Ford arrived at the Minute Man Motel, and began to change out of their habits. Tess was scared that someone had seen them, but Ford assured her that they were safe. Tess admitted that she was glad Ford had shown up when he did, because Dr. Levin would have tried to \"zap Jessica back again.\" Tess said they needed to figure out the safest way to leave Llanview, and went into the bathroom to change.\n\n\nTess returned in a skimpy dress, and was happy to report that she felt more like herself. She wanted to go as far away from Llanview as possible. Ford told her that he couldn't leave Llanview. Livid, Tess couldn't believe that Ford would \"break me out to cut me loose.\" Ford had no intention of letting Tess go, but he couldn't leave without his son. Ford pleaded with her to stay and help him fight for his son.\n\n\nTess knew that Brody would hunt her down if she stayed. Ford promised that he wouldn't let Brody find her. He confessed that he was \"winging it,\" but vowed to keep her safe. Tess reminded him that if she went back to St. Anne's, Jessica would be the one who got out. Tess admitted that she had been fighting Jessica off because of Ford. \"I love you more than she wants to come back,\" Tess told him. She knew that Jessica would return if Tess and Ford split up, so she decided to stay with Ford.\n\n\nFord kissed Tess, and she confided that it had \"been a while\" since she'd been with someone she cared about. Tess pulled away from him, and reminded him that \"Ryder happened\" the last time Tess and Ford had gotten together. Ford promised that he had everything under control. He sensed her nerves, but admitted that he was scared of messing things up with her. She informed him that Bess had told Tess that Tess shouldn't bother with Ford, since Jessica would eventually return. Ford kissed her, and picked her up. He threw her on the bed, and the two made love.\n\n\nBrody told Natalie that he didn't have much to pack, so he was going to leave. He told her to get some rest, and kissed her on the cheek. Both turned their heads and shared a kiss on the lips. Natalie stopped it, and wondered what they were doing. Brody said that he'd leave if she wanted him to.  Both agreed that they didn't want to risk hurting each other, so Brody walked towards the door. Before he could leave, Natalie closed the door in front of him, and told a smiling Brody to stay.\n\n\nNatalie explained that they'd already tried to ignore their feelings before. Brody didn't think Jessica was going to return. If she did, Brody believed that they wouldn't last. Natalie related that she and John had been done for a long time. Natalie wanted to explore the feelings between her and Brody, because she didn't want to regret not trying. Brody agreed, and kissed her.\n\n\nBrody reminded Natalie that they'd been drunk the last time they'd been together. He wanted to remember every moment, and wanted to go slowly. They began to undress each other, and made love.\n\n\nDani arrived at the hospital, and asked Starr for news about Matthew. Starr wasn't happy to report that there had been no change. Dani couldn't believe there was a possibility that Matthew wouldn't wake up. Dani asked how Destiny had been holding up. Starr replied that Destiny was trying to stay strong, but had gotten sick earlier. Dani thought that Destiny probably needed a break from being at the hospital, but Starr revealed that she'd thought it had been morning sickness.\n\n\nStarr promised not to tell anyone what she knew about Destiny and Matthew, but thought that Destiny needed someone to talk to. Starr believed that Destiny had enough going on without having to worry about a baby, so Starr was glad that Destiny and Matthew had used protection. She admitted that she'd been shocked to find out about Destiny and Matthew, because she hadn't known that they were dating. Dani revealed that they weren't dating, but they really cared about each other.\n\n\nStarr realized that Destiny was going to be in Matthew's room for a while. She suggested that she and Dani go to the diner to give Destiny some time alone with Matthew.\n\n\nDestiny hoped that Matthew didn't mind her around, because she needed a break from Starr and Dani. She knew that she shouldn't have told anyone \"what we did,\" but Starr had accidentally found out. Also, Destiny had needed someone to talk to with Matthew in a coma. She assured Matthew that she didn't tell about the real details. \"No one needs to know that we didn't actually use protection,\" she told him.\n\n\nDestiny hadn't wanted to listen when Starr had lectured Destiny about the possibility of pregnancy. Destiny knew that if she'd told Starr the truth, \"I wouldn't hear the end of it.\" Destiny thought that it wasn't possible for her to be pregnant. She assured him that no one was giving up on him. Suddenly, Destiny was shocked to see Matthew open his eyes.\n\n\nRex ran down the basement steps and found a chair holding a door closed. He burst into the room and found an unconscious Gigi, with the recorder in her hand. Rex tried to wake her up, but she stayed unconscious. Suddenly, he started to feel dizzy. He looked at the generator and saw the warning about carbon monoxide. When he realized that his phone had no signal, he picked Gigi up and carried her up the stairs. He assured her that they would get married, and live happily ever after with Shane.\n\n\nTodd thought John looked like he wanted to kill Todd, and dared him to. However, Todd said that when he died, the things he knew would die with him. John said that the only thing he wanted to know was Marty's whereabouts. \"Sure about that?\" Todd wondered. There was a knock on the door, and John answered it to an officer. The officer handed him a file, and asked John about Gigi. John looked at the file, and told the officer to keep an eye on Todd.\n\n\nRex arrived at the hospital, and Gigi was wheeled into a room. Rex watched as the doctors worked on her. John entered and asked Rex about Gigi. Rex summarized how he'd found Gigi, and wrote down the address of the house he'd found her in for John. John wondered how Gigi had gotten stuck in the basement. \"Ask Jack Manning,\" Rex stated.\n\n\nShane ran at Jack and demanded to know what had happened to Gigi. T\u00e9a told Roxy to get control of Shane. She regretted that Gigi was missing, but wondered what it had to do with Jack. She wondered why Jack would want to hurt Gigi. Shane yelled that Jack had wanted to hurt Shane, not Gigi. Shane explained the messages between him and Comicgurl15. As Jack called Shane a liar, Roxy's phone rang. She answered it to Rex.\n\n\nRex informed Roxy that he'd found Gigi, but that they were at the hospital. He wanted Roxy and Shane to get there as soon as possible. Roxy repeated the information to Shane. T\u00e9a glared at a nervous-looking Jack. Shane vowed to kill Jack if Gigi was hurt, and he left with Roxy. T\u00e9a asked Jack if he'd had anything to do with what had happened to Gigi. Jack denied it, and reminded T\u00e9a that Shane had just threatened Jack's life. T\u00e9a promised not to let anything happen to Jack.\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a and Jack arrived at the police station to visit Todd. T\u00e9a wondered where John was. Todd replied that \"something about Gigi\" had taken John away. He wanted to know why T\u00e9a hadn't gotten him out of police custody. She revealed that the judge had turned the request down. She promised that he would get out soon, but they had a bigger problem to deal with. \"Jack?\" T\u00e9a called.\n\n\nJack claimed innocence, but Todd didn't believe him. T\u00e9a said that things were still unclear, but there had been trouble with Shane. Todd reminded Jack that he'd already had a conversation with Jack about Shane. T\u00e9a updated Todd on Comicgurl15, and on Gigi landing in the hospital. Todd requested to talk to his son alone. T\u00e9a said she had to find another judge anyway, and left.\n\n\nTodd demanded that Jack tell the truth. Todd said that he'd know if Jack decided to lie. \"These handcuffs won't prevent you from facing the consequences,\" Todd told his son. Todd asked if Jack had set up a trap for Shane. \"Yes, I did it!\" Jack finally confessed.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the crime scene. A technician on the scene told John that the type of generator in the room wasn't even licensed to be used anymore because of the danger it presented. John examined the scattered contents of Gigi's purse, and the scarf stuffed into the vent of the generator. The technician thought that Gigi had been trying to find a way to block the carbon monoxide flow. The technician picked up the recorder and bagged it as evidence. John ordered that the door be checked for fingerprints. \"Someone locked Gigi in here, and I want to know who,\" John stated.\n\n\nRoxy and Shane arrived at the hospital and bombarded Rex with questions. The door to Gigi's room opened, and Shane caught sight of Gigi. He yelled for his mother and ran towards the room, but Rex and Roxy held him back. Rex told Shane to sit, and assured him that Gigi would be all right. He explained how he'd found Gigi, and said that John was on the case.\n\n\nShane noticed that Rex was holding a jacket, and recognized it as his own. Rex said that Gigi had been wearing it when he'd found her. It dawned on Shane that Jack had seen Gigi in the jacket, and had thought she'd been Shane. \"Jack tried to kill me!\" Shane realized. Shane blamed himself, but Rex told him not to. Rex asked Roxy to take Shane to his therapist in order to calm Shane down. He promised that nothing would happen to Gigi while Shane was gone. Roxy told Rex not to worry, and walked away with Shane.\n\n\nRex paced the hallway, but rushed to the doctor when he exited Gigi's room. He wondered if Gigi was awake, and how she was doing. He asked how long she'd have to be at the hospital. The doctor apologized to a horrified Rex. They'd done all they could for Gigi, but they had gotten to her too late.\n\n\n",
