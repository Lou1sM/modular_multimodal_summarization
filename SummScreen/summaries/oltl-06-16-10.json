Viki and Charlie arrived and expressed their relief to Markko that he'd been cleared.  James sat at the Buenos Dias lunch counter and thought about when he'd discovered the empty case that once held thousands of dollars in cash.  James desperately pondered how to find it.\n\n\nMarkko overheard James on the phone when he  asked hospital staff about Ford's condition.  James asked Markko who he was and Markko showed him the front page of the Sun.  Markko told James that he wished he had been the one to attack Ford because Ford was a snake.  He asked James why he was asking the hospital about Ford's condition.  James lied and said that he was considering studying journalism but that he didn't know Ford personally.\n\n\nCharlie and Viki sat at a table, and he vocalized his concern that she might actually be serious about hiring David.  Viki replied that it wasn't any more ridiculous than  Charlie working for Dorian, considering Dorian had poured alcohol down his throat while he'd been unconscious.  Viki assured Charlie that she was supportive of him working on the project but that she wished he and Dorian didn't have to work so closely.\n\n\nHe apologized for the photos that implied he and Dorian were more than just colleagues and swore that they never would have kissed.  Viki stated that she trusted Charlie but that he didn't really know what Dorian was capable of.  Charlie asked if Viki wanted to hire David to \"rub Dorian's face in it.\"  Viki told him that neither she nor Charlie had anything to worry about.\n\n\nDani woke up and found T\u00e9a reading the Sun's headline that announced that Marrko was cleared of charges in Ford's beating.  Dani congratulated her mom but added that she opposed T\u00e9a representing Todd.  Dani asked what it would take to get Todd out of their lives.\n\n\nJust then, Todd entered with breakfast.  Dani made it clear she didn't want him there.  She told Todd that she'd released him of \"any so-called responsibilities.\"  Dani prepared to leave and declined T\u00e9a's invitation to have breakfast.  Todd wanted them all to go together to the ceremony, but Dani announced bitterly that she was going with her friends.\n\n\nAfter she left, Todd worried that he'd never reach her but vowed not to give up.  He then offered to take T\u00e9a to see the doctor, but she made excuses as to why he didn't need to.  He realized that T\u00e9a had canceled her appointment.  T\u00e9a intimated that she was giving up, but he refused to let her.\n\n\nTodd began to make plans to find ways to attack  her illness.  T\u00e9a told him that their first priority was to see Starr graduate because \"she's an amazing kid.\"  Todd made T\u00e9a snort with laughter by telling her that Starr and all of his kids were amazing because of him.  \"Seein' as how they came from different chicks, it must be me.\"\n\n\nAt her apartment, Langston practiced her speech but couldn't concentrate.  Someone knocked on the door and she hoped it would be Markko.  Instead, it was a man looking for Starr.  He explained that he'd found Starr's purse.  Langston offered to take the bag to Starr, but he refused to let her.  Langston asked for the man's number and suggested that Starr would likely want to thank him or give him a reward.  He declined to offer any information, so Langston took the bag and left the apartment.  As soon as she was gone, the man broke in through the front door.\n\n\nAs Starr lamented her missing purse and prepared to cancel her credit cards, Blair, Dorian, and Kelly entered the La Boulaie kitchen and fawned all over the soon-to-be graduate.  Blair prepared for breakfast but Dorian stated that they couldn't start without the valedictorian, Langston.  The family was surprised that Starr had driven away after having left her purse on the top of her car.  She neglected to tell them  that James had kidnapped her and Hope.\n\n\nStarr complained that it had been difficult raising Hope while Cole was in jail and that she was feeling unsupported.  She also explained that Hope had a fever and wouldn't be going to the graduation.  Blair announced that the boys were also sick and that Addie would watch them during the ceremony.  Blair presented Starr with a graduation cap that her little brothers had decorated.\n\n\nLangston arrived with Starr's purse and told them that a strange man had delivered  it to her.  Dorian expressed her concern that Langston had let a stranger get so close to her.  Starr discovered that her phone was missing.\n\n\nStarr told Langston that Markko had been released, to which Langston replied, \"He still hates me.\"  Starr also began to tell Langston about how she'd lost her purse but was interrupted when the rest of the Cramer women returned to the kitchen with graduation gifts.\n\n\nIn the high school gym, Nate looked at the money in his backpack and wondered what his next step should be.  Darren saw the cash and asked, incredulously, if Nate had robbed a bank.  Nate told Darren that the money was a prop for the play.  Darren didn't appear to believe him.  Nate was shocked when Darren informed him that the play had been canceled.  Darren offered to get rid of the \"fake\" money and Nate and Darren argued about whether or not to throw away the cash, but Darren received a call and walked away.\n\n\nDestiny showed up at the Buchanan Mansion to look for Matthew.  David answered the door half-naked.  Destiny was shocked when Matthew emerged from the bedroom with Fawn on his arm, and then Destiny  noticed Wendy passed out on the couch.  David tried to play it off, as if the women had just spent the night because they'd been out so late and had drunk too much.\n\n\nDestiny was aware that the women were prostitutes and harangued Matthew for having sex with a \"pro.\"  Matthew was feeling full of himself as he kissed Fawn and walked her out.  Destiny exploded at David, but he defended his actions.\n\n\nAt the Llanview High auditorium, students and families gathered for the graduation ceremony.  Matthew witnessed a tender moment between Dani and Nate and decided to leave.  Destiny and Darren offered to leave with him, and they all exited together.  On the way out, Matthew stopped to congratulate Starr.  She told him that she understood why he was leaving, having \"been there.\"\n\n\nBlair reminisced about Starr as a baby.  She, Kelly, and Dorian all shared tissues as they began to get teary-eyed.  David arrived and handed Dorian his handkerchief, monogrammed with a \"B \" for Buchanan.  Dorian told David that Viki had only offered him a job to get back at her.  In front of Dorian, David asked Viki to talk about his \"package.\"\n\n\nTodd and Kelly walked away, and he told her that he was going to be out of commission for a couple of months, at least, and that he would need her to run the Sun.  Briggs called, and Todd made plans to go to the office.  Kelly insisted that Todd stay to see his daughter graduate and offered to handle Briggs.\n\n\nPrivately, Blair apologized to T\u00e9a for having been unable to keep Todd from discovering the truth about her illness.  T\u00e9a replied that it had been time for him to find out but admitted that Dani didn't know yet.\n\n\nLangston apologized to Starr for having ruined their senior year.  She felt responsible for Cole being in jail and Markko moving out.  Starr made it clear that they'd all made mistakes and congratulated Langston for becoming valedictorian.  They both confirmed that they'd be best friends forever.  From a distance, the man who'd found Starr's purse watched them.\n\n\nThe principal kicked off the ceremony by introducing the Class of 2010's valedictorian, Langston Wilde .  She began her speech but became flustered when she saw Markko, who stood in the back of the auditorium.  She started to speak extemporaneously and talked, emotionally, about making mistakes and making them right.  Markko left, and Langston ran after him.\n\n\nThe principal began to announce each student's name, which began with Jessica Buchanan.  That elicited some laughs and embarrassed Viki.  Langston caught up with Markko.  She thanked him for being there and apologized for hurting him.  As Starr made her way backstage after receiving her diploma, someone grabbed her and pulled her away.  Her graduation cap was left behind.\n\n\n",

Charlie is jealous about Viki hiring David Vickers. Destiny shows up at Matthew's house and is appalled to see two prostitutes there. Later, she is amused when Matthew reveals that he paid the prostitute NOT to have sex with him and to keep it mum. James Ford meets Markko when he is having breakfast at the Buenos Dias Cafe. Markko is clear about his hatred for Ford, so James claims that he doesn't know Ford. Starr goes to the Buenos Dias and apologizes to Markko for not telling him what she knew about Langston and Ford. The man who has been chasing James Ford shows up at Markko, Cole, Langston, and Starr's apartment to return Starr's purse. When Langston leaves, he ransacks the place.
