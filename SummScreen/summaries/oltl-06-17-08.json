    "soap_central": "\nLovers & Other Strangers\n\n\nAt the police station, Natalie made the terms of her deal clear to Clint, Bo, and Nora: Let Jared walk, free and clear, no strings attached, and she would give them the name of the true Buchanan heir. The Buchanans were shocked to discover that one of their own knew all along. Clint was thrown by Natalie's betrayal, and reminded her that Nash was dead, leaving Jessica without a husband and Bree without a father. He could not believe that she could follow that up by blackmailing her own father. Emotional, Natalie swallowed a lump in her throat and managed to say, \"Well, if Grandpa were alive, he'd be really proud of me.\" Clint said he loved Natalie but could not abide by her terms. \"Do you want to know who your brother is?\" Natalie asked. Struggling to keep it together, a steely Natalie reminded her loved ones that she could dictate terms when she was the one holding all the cards, and insisted that Jared was the lesser evil compared to Dorian. She told them Jared had worked hard at Buchanan Enterprises despite his initially impure motives. \"Who cares?!\" Clint retorted. Natalie challenged him, claiming that Clint had been responsible for unleashing Dorian's wrath by spurning her in the first place, and asked why he hadn't taken care of her sooner instead of allowing her rage to reach critical mass. She said that she and Jared had planned to tell earlier, but Dorian had beaten them to the punch. Furious, Clint ordered her to get Jared out of his cell, \"right now.\" \n\n\nCharlie was pleased when a somber Viki entered his hospital room. Viki told him they needed to talk, but instead she ended up sobbing in a corner. Charlie tried to console her, begging for forgiveness. \"I wish we could go back in time,\" Viki cried, wishing to return to a time before all of Charlie's lies. Charlie told her they had something worth salvaging, and Viki said she didn't want to end things between them but had no choice. She told Charlie she didn't know who he really was: \"Charlie B.,\" the quiet stranger she'd met in Texas, \"Charlie Balsom,\" the wayward father, or \"Charlie Banks,\" the con man. \"Who are you? I don't know who you are!\" Charlie swore that he was still the man she'd taken into her heart, despite his flaws. Charlie said they were good together, that \"life is just...a little sweeter together.\" He said he knew that wasn't much, but Viki disagreed: \"Charlie, that's everything.\" Nonetheless, Viki said it no longer mattered. Charlie wanted to tell her \"his version of the story,\" but Viki said that in her version, her daughter's husband and her granddaughter's father was dead, Buchanan Enterprises was lost, and Dorian was triumphant, \"all because of Jared and you,\" and she doubted his version of events was all that different. \n\n\nCharlie said that Nash's death was an accident, but that he blamed himself for not reining Jared in. He told Viki that when he'd found his son after years of exile and drinking, he felt he'd \"owed\" it to him to keep silent about the con, after so many broken promises. He said he'd tried to talk to Jared out of it, but to no avail. Viki said that even if she could understand his motivations, Jessica would never forgive her if she kept Charlie Banks in her life. Charlie suggested that time could heal the wounds and asked her to not choose others over her own happiness as he had, but Viki said she couldn't have both in their situation and neither could he. She blamed him for not trusting in their love together, and said Charlie had never given her a chance to hear the story and try to help find a careful, quiet solution before it was too late. Charlie realized she was right, and said he had simply been afraid of losing her. Charlie said he knew he still meant something to her after she saved his life in the alley behind Rodi's, and made an emotional plea for a second chance. \n\n\nAt \"Cramer Enterprises,\" Dorian insisted that she had nothing to do with the anonymous note sent to Rex at the shareholders' meeting, and said it was more Gigi's kind of work, needling her about her deception regarding Shane's paternity. Dorian said Gigi had potential if she was willing to do whatever it took to get what she wanted, and offered to help mold her. Dorian said she wasn't ashamed of going after what was \"rightfully\" hers, and urged Gigi to do the same and get Rex for herself. On cue, Rex barged into Dorian's offices, full of recriminations for his mother-in-law. Gigi told Dorian she'd rather starve than take her job offer, and Dorian asked her who would take care of Shane: \"His father?\" Rex encouraged Gigi to stand firm against Dorian, and Gigi shrugged off Dorian's veiled taunts and left the office. Rex confronted Dorian about Adriana leaving for Paris, and was surprised to learn that Dorian hadn't even known where her daughter had gone. He told Dorian that Adriana was miserable, but the mother of the bride glibly told him that it wasn't her fault. Rex warned Dorian that she was dead to Adriana, but Dorian told him that her bond to her daughter would never be broken; his was another story. She suggested Rex and Adriana annul their marriage, but Rex insisted that they were merely separated and would work things out. Dorian relished in Rex's discomfort. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica woke to a knock at her bedroom door. She was surprised to find Antonio there to see her. Jessica thought he was there to question her about the accident, but Antonio said he wasn't there as a cop, but as a friend. She hugged him and let him into her room. Antonio told her that Nash didn't deserve to die and offered his sincere condolences. Crying, Jessica was stunned to hear him be so selfless after everything she'd done to him. Antonio was sanguine, however, saying that he'd been angry for a long time, but it had passed. He said he knew that you couldn't fight true love, and that he hadn't wished such a tragedy on her or anyone. Jessica confessed to Antonio that she was pregnant, and Antonio comforted her. Jessica told Antonio that Nash's death had been no accident: \"Natalie and her boyfriend killed him.\" Antonio said he knew her kind of anger, and that the important thing was to not expose her children to it. \"Did I make you feel this way?\" Jessica asked, agonizing. Antonio said she had, but that he had gotten through it, just as she would. He urged her to remember her love for Nash, and take solace in it, and that day by day, as her children grew, things would change, and she would move on and live a full and happy life, just as Nash would want. Jessica thanked Antonio for his generous sympathy. \"We had our time,\" Antonio said. \"No regrets.\" Antonio embraced his ex-wife again and left, leaving Jessica to mumble, \"Thank you.\" \n\n\nSarah was stunned to see her mother enter the Llanfair drawing room. All she could say to Tina was, \"you look great.\" Tina said she had been away for far too long, but that she was back to make it all up to her daughter. When Cristian returned, Sarah reintroduced him to Tina. Cristian demanded to know where Tina had been over the years. Tina demurred, asking where the guards were: \"Y'know, I have been telling Viki for years to beef up security, but does she listen to me? No! No, so I am just able to crawl right over the wall.\" Sarah asked Tina if she was in trouble, and Tina covered, saying, \"Not at the moment.\" She told Cristian he'd \"filled out nicely\" and said she could remember him as a child following after Carlotta at La Boulaie. \n\n\nCristian shut down Tina's prattling by asking her what kind of trouble she was in, and asked her if she had anything to do with the gunman looking for a mystery woman in the park. Tina admired Cristian's protectiveness of Sarah and admitted that she was the woman Jonas had been looking for. When Cris tried to press Tina for more details, Sarah asked him to stop grilling her mother and said that despite their issues, she still loved her and was glad to have her home given all the family strife. As Sarah hugged Tina, Tina whispered to him to \"lighten up, boyfriend, it's all good.\" Tina took a seat on the couch with her pet \"David Vickers\" and kept on yammering, batting away Cristian's questions about her pursuers. Cristian threatened to get Antonio, who was still on the property, but Tina said that wouldn't be necessary, and begged Cristian and Sarah for their help, asking them not to let her and \"David Vickers\" suffer. Sarah was perturbed to realize Tina had named her dog after her ex-husband. \"Well, yeah, why not?\" Tina asked. \"I mean, I think they look a little bit alike, especially around the eyes, and you know what, David's nose was always so cold, I never understood why; maybe it's the champagne.\" She told Sarah she needed a place to stay, but Cristian warned, \"Over my dead body!\" \n\n\nAt the cottage, Brody looked through Gigi's magazine and realized Shane was the culprit behind Rex's anonymous note. When Shane entered, Brody confronted him and Shane confessed. He explained how he'd gone through Gigi's shareholder files to put Rex's note in the right folder, and said that Adriana was a liar and someone had needed to tell Rex the truth. Brody realized that Shane had wanted Rex free to marry his mother, but Shane said that with Brody back, \"She should marry you, not Rex.\" Suddenly, Gigi returned home, and told Shane she needed his help updating her resume, because she was out of a job. As Gigi and Shane rushed off to their task, Brody quickly tore up Gigi's magazine. \n\n\nAt the Llanview police station, Jared was brought up to the bullpen from the cells to face Clint and the Buchanans. Clint asked Jared if he'd put Natalie up to her gambit, but Jared was clueless. Nora took Clint and Bo aside and urged Clint to take the deal, but Clint seethed at the thought of having to tell Jessica and Bree he let \"the man who killed Nash\" walk free. Bo reminded him that according to Natalie, Jared did not push Nash. Nora said they had to get the Buchanan heir on their side in the battle against Dorian, and asked what was more important: Sticking it to Jared, or getting the company back and securing the future for Bree and the next generation? When Nora made it clear that Jared could possibly be out in five years on good behavior despite the charges, Bo ordered Clint to make the deal. \n\n\nAlone with Natalie for a moment, Jared was horrified to learn what she had done. \"I love the fighter in you,\" Jared said, but begged her not to lose her family over him. \"I won't lose you to prison,\" Natalie declared, and, with pain in her voice, said she'd spent half her life not knowing she was a Buchanan, and could survive losing them, but not his love. Clint returned and agreed to Natalie's deal despite his disgust. \"I didn't work at BE for the last year sorting paper clips,\" Natalie proclaimed. \"I want it in writing.\" \n\n\nDavid arrived at \"Cramer Enterprises,\" dressed in a suit and asking to see Dorian, but he was rebuffed by a security guard who held up his photo, saying he had orders not to admit him. \"God, I look tired in that photo,\" David lamented, and then stormed into the corner office, interrupting Dorian's sparring with Rex. He told Rex they were both newlyweds, and Rex stalked out, ignoring Dorian's taunts about losing Adriana and \"poor Rex.\" \"David?\" Rex asked as he closed the doors behind him, \"Kill her.\" David told Dorian she had that effect on men, and Dorian spun around giddily in Clint's chair as she warned David he had no job at her new empire, even with a suit and tie. David explained that it was his \"wedding suit,\" and Dorian assumed that he had recycled what he had worn to marry Alex, commenting on the tackiness of it. Dorian told him he had no second chance with her and no seat back on the gravy train. David smugly told Dorian he had all the money he needed thanks to his new wife, and flashed his wedding ring at her, asking if she wanted to kiss the groom. \n\n\nBack in her room at Llanfair, Jessica examined a framed portrait of herself with Natalie. Enraged, she threw it against the wall, shattering the glass. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Tina reappears to see Sara and Cristian. Sara wants to believe and trust her mother. But Cristian is very guarded and demands to know why she abandoned her daughter. Dorian is ready to take over B.E. and make it Cramer Enterprises. She offers Gigi a good paying job that will enable her to provide for her son, if Gigi is willing to help her with something. But Gigi washes her hands of Dorian and is ready to look for another job. Natalie asks Clint, Bo and Nora if they might consider dropping the charges against Jared if she can tell them whom Asa's rightful heir really is. Clint says no way. But Bo and Nora consider that maybe it's not cost effective to keep Jared locked up when the person they should really go after is Dorian. Viki goes to see Charlie and tells him she can never forgive or trust him again. But it sounds like she really wishes she could. David goes to see Dorian and obviously has a trick up his sleeve.
