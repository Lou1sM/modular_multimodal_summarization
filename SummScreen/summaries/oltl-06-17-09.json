    "soap_central": "\nAs Close As The Beat Of My Heart\n\n\nAt Michael and Marcie's apartment, packing for their move to Seattle was in full swing.  Michael encouraged Marcie to pack faster, but Marcie, spotting Hope's stuffed bunny rabbit, said she had something to do first.\n\n\nIn the cemetery, workmen removed \"Hope Manning McBain's\" headstone, replacing it with one reading \"Chloe Victoria Brennan.\"  As the Buchanans began to arrive for Chloe's memorial service, Viki and Clint stood over Chloe's open grave, consoling each other.  Clint told Viki they'd buried too many children and grandchildren together.\n\n\nAs Jared, Natalie and Charlie arrived to console their loved ones, Natalie worried about Jessica.  Viki assured Natalie that Jess was a survivor.\n\n\nNot far away, Jessica knelt by Nash's gravesite, with Brody watching from afar.  Jessica told her husband what had become of their second daughter, and said she hadn't been theirs after all.  She told Nash that Chloe was dead because of her.  Weeping, she told him that all she could do was think of Chloe in his arms, and begged Nash to take better care of their baby than she had.  As Jessica broke down, Brody rushed to her aid, surprising her with an embrace.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr and Hope enjoyed a hearty breakfast of Cheerios together in the kitchen.  Langston entered and was shocked to see Hope on the premises, but Starr explained that Marcie had returned her daughter.  She told Langston that she and Cole would get to raise their child together, only Cole didn't know; she wanted to surprise him when he came to the house later in the day.\n\n\nThe girls compared notes about the custody strife with Todd and Blair, and Dorian's meltdown during Markko's party.  Langston suggested they hit the mall, but Starr reminded her that she had Hope to take care of.  As she cuddled with Hope, Starr told her friend she was sure Cole would be a great father.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Cole, John, Marty, and Nora attended Cole's hearing for his parole violation.  Marty asked Cole why Starr wasn't there, and Cole admitted that he hadn't told her about his arrest.\n\n\nThe judge from the original case entered, and as he reviewed the violation, he told the court he was outraged at the thought that Cole had learned nothing from the accident that had crippled Matthew.  Cole told the judge it wasn't as it seemed, and explained that he had been about to throw the drugs away.  The judge was unimpressed, promptly hitting Cole with his original sentence of five years in prison.\n\n\nAs the court reacted, Nora spoke up, not only as the prosecutor, but as the victim's parent, and pleaded for leniency on behalf of the Commonwealth.  She told the judge that she had been monitoring Cole carefully, and believed his story.  She suggested a new probation deal, which the judge agreed to consider after a short recess.\n\n\nAfter the court returned to session, Marty spoke up from the gallery, and begged the judge to consider probation.  The judge dismissed her request, and said he would instead shorten Cole's sentence to two years, with a possibility for parole after one year for good behavior.  Nora asked the judge to give Cole a couple days to put his affairs in order before being taken into custody.  The judge agreed to give Cole two days.  As the court adjourned, Cole turned to his mother, crushed.  He asked her how he would tell Starr of his fate.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Community Center, Bo and Matthew wheeled up to the entrance as Bo told his son that he'd had no choice but to arrest Cole.  Matthew was sure Cole was innocent of the charges against him, and Bo told him that he and Nora were doing everything they could to help him.\n\n\nMatthew's ears perked up as he asked his father if his parents would keep spending lots of time together at work after she married \"Uncle Clint.\"  Bo asked Matthew if he was okay with Nora marrying Clint, and Matthew replied by saying he liked Clint a lot.  He turned the question around on his father, asking Bo if he was okay with Nora marrying Clint.  \"No problem,\" Bo muttered.\n\n\nShane and Rex walked up to Bo and Matthew, and the Buchanan boys congratulated Shane as he prepared for his first musical performance, with the community center choir, since he beat cancer.  Shane was excited to finally get to showcase his drumming skills in public.  Just as Bo was about to ask Rex about Gigi's whereabouts, Stacy bounced up, informing Rex that she'd bribed a kid to get them the best seats in the auditorium for Shane's show.  As Shane and Rex continued to talk about the boy's musical prowess, Stacy showed little interest and quickly excused herself, promising to meet them inside.\n\n\nAs the adults began to migrate, Destiny sidled up to Matthew and asked him to play the piano for them during the choir concert.  Matthew claimed he was inexperienced, but Destiny ignored him.  \"The man plays piano like Alicia Keys!\" she told Shane.\n\n\nOnce inside, Destiny and Shane got Matthew in front of their electric keyboard.  Pushy as always, Destiny told Matthew they were counting on him; their pianist had fallen ill, and if he didn't play, there would be no concert.  Shane encouraged Matthew to give it a try, saying they'd both be playing music for the first time since their joint accident on the road.\n\n\nIn the nearby park, Stacy made a beeline for Schuyler, who wasn't happy to see her.  Schuyler told Stacy to leave him alone, but Stacy harassed him about his involvement with Gigi and their attempts to blow the whistle on her scheme.  Stacy told Schuyler that no one believed his claims about the bag of blood, and asked him to leave her alone.  She insisted that Rex was her dream, and that they were in love.  Schuyler urged her to turn herself in, but Stacy pleaded with him to let her be happy and to give her a chance at love.  Schuyler told Stacy she didn't have any idea what happiness was and walked away, disgusted.\n\n\nMarcie walked into Rodi's to see Gigi, who apologized for not going over sooner to see Hope.  Marcie told her not to bother, and said she'd given Hope back to her rightful mother, and that she and Michael would be moving to Seattle.  She told Gigi it was okay, and she realized she didn't need Hope to be happy.  Gigi was overcome to learn her friend would be moving far away, but saw that Marcie was the happiest she'd been in a long time.  Embracing Marcie, Gigi told her to write, text, email, and call constantly.  Marcie replied that Gigi needed to let her know as soon as she and Rex got back together.  Gigi told Marcie she couldn't wait to let Rex know that everything she'd done had been for Shane.\n\n\nBo and Rex walked along the path outside the community center.  Bo asked Rex where Gigi was, and Rex explained that they were alternating time with Shane.  Bo asked about Stacy's presence, and Rex insisted they were just friends, \"for now.\"\n\n\nBo attempted to get to the bottom of Rex's troubles with Gigi, but Rex was stuck on the belief that Gigi was heating up the town with both Brody and Schuyler.  Bo agreed it was hard to recover from seeing someone you loved turn to another.  \"You didn't,\" Rex said, invoking Nora's name.\n\n\nBo said that it had taken him a long time, but he had to come to understand why Nora had done what she did with Sam Rappaport.  He told Rex he didn't trust Stacy, dismissing Rex's repeated denials of any romantic tension.  Bo said that Rex's pain over Gigi's betrayal indicated a deeper love, and said he'd been able to forgive Nora when he realized everything she'd done had been for their son.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Gigi called Schuyler, and left a voicemail asking him to get back to her with Shane and Stacy's test results as soon as possible.\n\n\nAt the cemetery, Jessica and Brody joined the rest of the family at Chloe's gravesite.  Before the pastor began to speak, Jessica asked to say a few words to her daughter, and knelt by the grave.  Growing emotional, Jessica told Viki she'd never got to see Chloe as herself, and Chloe had never gotten to see the real her, either.  Speaking to Chloe, she told her that she'd been a bad mother, and Chloe deserved better.  She said she'd abandoned and forgotten about her, and told Chloe she was sorry.  Sobbing, she traced the outline of a heart into the tiny coffin, just as Nash had done on the day he died.  \"Give that to your daddy,\" Jessica cried. \"He'll know who it's for.\"\n\n\nAs the pastor began to speak, Chloe was laid to rest, and Jessica and the rest of the family laid flowers onto her coffin.\n\n\nInside the community center, Bo and Rex entered, continuing their running debate about Gigi, but they were cut short as Bo noticed Matthew begin to play the electric piano.  Bo marveled at his son playing music for the first time since he was injured.\n\n\nRex rejoined Stacy and Shane just in time for Stacy to give Shane a good luck present, a panther charm from Rex, Gigi, and Stacy's old high school football team in Michigan.  Rex was shocked that Stacy had kept the memento, and Stacy said she'd taken it with her everywhere, including to all his old school games.  Shane thanked Stacy for the gift.\n\n\nBo congratulated Matthew on his piano playing, and Matthew bashfully said Destiny had made him do it.  Bo suggested calling Nora, and Matthew seized the opportunity to get his parents together once again.\n\n\nNora took Bo's call at the courthouse, still miserable about Cole's sentence.  Bo was dismayed to learn about Cole, but asked her to go to the community center for a surprise.  Nora hesitated, as she had planned to meet Clint, and Bo paused before suggesting Clint go along as well.  He told Nora that Matthew had a musical breakthrough.  Overjoyed, Nora told Bo she was on her way.\n\n\nHurrying out of the courtroom, Nora ran into Marty.  Nora apologized for Cole's harsh sentence, and Marty told her she knew Nora had done what she could.  As the women hugged, Nora told her that prison was not what Cole needed, and that it was time for them all to heal.\n\n\nAt the center, Bo and Rex watched the kids prepare for their performance.  Bo told Rex that Nora was attending to see Matthew play, piquing Rex's curiosity.  Lost in thought, Bo told Rex to not wait too long to forgive Gigi, otherwise he would be the one too late, left alone.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, John arrived to meet Michael.  John agreed to help Michael and Marcie sell their car from Llanview, but was still perturbed by their sudden move to Seattle.  He realized it was a great opportunity, and grudgingly told Mike he was happy for him.  Michael asked him to visit soon.  The McBain brothers embraced, and John told Michael to take care of his niece.  Michael nevously told John he had something to tell him about Hope.\n\n\nCole arrived at La Boulaie, and the kitchen door opened to reveal Hope in Starr's arms.  Cole was stunned to learn that Marcie had given them their daughter back.  Wrestling with joy and sorrow, Cole struggled to control his emotions as Starr waxed rhapsodic about their happy future together as a family.  When Starr asked him what was wrong, Cole said he was just processing his shock.  At Starr's encouragement, Cole took Hope into his arms and held his child.\n\n\nAt the community center, Destiny and the choir began to sing, with Shane on drums and Matthew on keyboards.  Nora hurried in, without Clint, to sit by Bo, taking his hand and beaming with pride as the exes watched their son.  Rex was rapt as Shane played on, but Stacy looked bored and disinterested until she got the opportunity to hold Rex's hand.  Meanwhile, Gigi continued to toil at Rodi's alone, Cole held his daughter, and in the cemetery, Jessica collapsed into tears by Chloe's newly filled grave, comforted by Brody.\n\n\nThe choir's song played on the tiny radio in Michael and Marcie's emptied apartment as Michael rushed back home.  Calling out for Marcie, Michael found himself alone in the apartment, or so he thought.  Michael suddenly noticed an opened pregnancy test on the dresser, and was shocked when Marcie stepped out of the bathroom holding a pregnancy test.  Silent, Marcie held up the test, which indicated that she was, indeed, pregnant.  As Michael and Marcie burst into happy laughter, Marcie leapt into her husband's arms. \n\n\n",

Matthew is more interested in how much time Bo and Nora have been spending together. Stacy bribes a kid to get her front row seats at the community center concert and Rex shows up with Shane.
