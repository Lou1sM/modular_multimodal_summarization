When Bobby asked what else Cutter could possibly want, since he already had the Buchanan mansion and money, Cutter wondered why he would get rid of his cash cow.  Ford explained that he loved Tess, but Cutter still refused to divorce her.  After Bobby walked away, Rama demanded that Cutter release Tess, or she would tell everyone what she knew about Cutter.\n\n\nCutter reminded Rama that if she ratted him out, he would tell Vimal about Rama's false pregnancy and about Cristian Vega.  However, Rama pointed out that Cutter had more to lose than she did, so she again demanded that he divorce Tess.  When Rama speculated who she should call first, Cutter quickly announced that he would divorce Tess.\n\n\nRama informed Cutter that she had already called to have the divorce papers sent over, and that Cutter only had to sign them.  Once Cutter signed the papers, he handed them to Bobby, who hugged Rama and ran out of the room.  Later, Ford returned to his motel room and yelled for Tess.  When he was unable to find Tess anywhere in the room, he wondered where she was.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica walked in on Brody and Natalie in bed together.  When Natalie yelled at Tess for intruding on them, Jessica corrected her and asked what Natalie was doing in bed with her fianc\u00e9.  Jessica revealed that she had returned to Brody, because she loved him and had believed that he needed her.  Jessica had felt that Brody would be happy to see her but then asked how Brody could grab the phone to call St. Ann's, just so that he could crawl back into bed with her sister.\n\n\nJessica hollered that both Brody and Natalie had sworn that they loved her and then demanded to know how they could do that to her.  Jessica suddenly bent over, and held her head.  When Natalie asked if Jessica was still with then, Jessica stated that she was just frightened and then cried that it had only been a matter of time before Natalie and Brody hooked up again.  Jessica questioned why Brody had begged for Jessica to return and then informed them that she would be sticking around to make them pay.\n\n\nAfter Natalie stressed that it was important to them that Jessica was okay, Jessica pondered how Natalie could claim that she cared about Jessica.  Natalie emphasized that it had been the first time that Brody and Natalie had been together, since the non-wedding.  Jessica snapped that Brody must have had a weak moment, so that Natalie could move right on in, but Brody insisted that Jessica not blame Natalie.  Jessica blared that she blamed Brody also.\n\n\nBrody stated that he blamed Jessica and explained that he had begged Jessica to return many, many times, and that he had made many apologies to her.  Brody added that Jessica had made no effort to help herself or Brody, so he had finally moved on.  When Jessica cried that she had been trapped, Brody called it bull.  Jessica then asked to speak to her fianc\u00e9 alone.  After Natalie left, Jessica reminded Brody that she had a disease, however, Brody claimed that Jessica had let Tess out.\n\n\nWhen Brody informed Jessica that Tess had married Ford, Jessica declared that Bobby was Ryder's father.  Brody then told Jessica that Tess had married Cutter, who had meant nothing to either Jessica or Ryder.  Brody stressed that even though Jessica's wedding to Brody had not mattered to her, she had since been married twice to two different men.\n\n\nJessica howled that it had been Tess who had married the men.  Brody replied, \"Tess is not a 'get out of jail free' card.  She is part of you.  She is the mean, angry, hateful part of you.\"  Brody claimed that because of his past, he prayed every day to live a good life.  However, Brody exclaimed that Tess would frequent bars, and that Jessica even had an alter named Wes, and that she had even used Brody's dead best friend to get back at him.\n\n\nBrody maintained that he had hung in there and had willed Jessica to grow up.  Brody insisted that he had needed Jessica, but that he had turned to Natalie, because Jessica had not been there.  Brody informed Jessica that Liam had been kidnapped, and that was when he and Natalie had gotten closer.  Brody then expressed that he was sorry that he had hurt Jessica.\n\n\nJessica yelled at Brody to \"go to hell,\" stated that she was leaving to see her kids, and ran out of the room.  Natalie walked out to comfort Brody.  When Brody insisted that he had not meant to hurt Jessica, Natalie wondered what they could do.\n\n\nJessica walked into Aubrey's room to get Bree, and Aubrey suggested that Jessica call Viki.  As Jessica held and hugged Ryder, she claimed that she was back home.  Jessica said that Aubrey could get confirmation that she was Jessica from Natalie and Brody.  Jessica declared to Bree that she was all better and then announced to Aubrey that she wanted time alone with her children.  Aubrey refused to leave.  When Jessica asked again, Aubrey refused again and declared that as the children's legal guardian, she could not leave the room.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Gigi's doctor, Dr. DeGroff, asked Clint's doctor, Dr. Gangemi, about Clint's donor, but Clint's doctor revealed that the donor had improved.  Dr. DeGroff informed Dr. Gangemi about another possible donor for Clint.  When Gigi's doctor sadly expressed that the donor was supposed to had gotten married but had arrived to the hospital braindead instead, Clint's doctor claimed that his patient needed a heart immediately.\n\n\nIn Clint's room, Bo announced to Viki that Matthew had turned the corner, and that he was improving.  Clint noted that he would be unable to receive Matthew's heart after all.  Bo understood and claimed that he had appreciated Clint's confession to keep Matthew out of jail.  However, Bo hoped that Clint would reconsider reconciling with Rex.  Clint remarked that he did not want to talk about Rex, but that he was happy to hear about Matthew.\n\n\nBo realized that Clint did not have much time left, and Clint lamented that there would be no last-minute miracle for him.  However, Clint insisted that he had made his peace with it.  When Viki refused to give up, Clint called her an impossible woman, and Viki commented that Clint was no walk in the park himself.  They smiled at each other.\n\n\nLater, after Bo had left, Viki and Clint looked at an old photo album and laughed at how young Bo and Clint were and joked about their weird Beatles' haircuts.  When Joey entered the room, Clint announced that Matthew was better.  Dr. Gangemi then walked in and announced that they might have found a match.\n\n\nThe doctor revealed that the donor was in the emergency room, and Viki realized that the family had just lost the donor and was sorry.  The doctor declared that the person had signed on as an organ donor, and that the doctor just needed to talk to her fianc\u00e9.  After the doctor left, when Clint worried that the fianc\u00e9 would not allow Clint to have the donor's heart, Joey calmed Clint and insisted that the fianc\u00e9 should have no problem with Clint getting the heart.\n\n\nOutside of the E.R., Roxy told Rex that it made no sense that Gigi would die.  Rex then realized that Gigi would not wake up, no matter what they did, and wondered how he would tell Shane that his mother would not return to them.  Rex looked up and begged Gigi to help him get through it.  Bo found Rex in the hall, and Rex informed him that Gigi had never shown up for their wedding, because she had discovered a message for Shane from Jack on Shane's computer.\n\n\nRex explained that Gigi had left the Carriage House to confront Jack, who had locked her in a basement room with a broken generator that leaked carbon monoxide.  Rex exclaimed that Gigi had tried to block the carbon monoxide gas with her scarves.  Rex cried, \"The doctor said that it was too late by the time I got there, that she was already braindead.  She's gone.\"\n\n\nRex did not know what he would do without Gigi.  Bo related that Gigi had always said what was on her mind, straight up, and that Bo had loved that about her.  Rex agreed that he had also loved that about her -- even when he didn't.  When Bo asked if there was anything that he could do, Rex revealed that he had asked Gigi to send him a sign, and that Gigi had sent Bo.\n\n\nWhen Rex feared how Shane would react, Bo told Rex to be strong for his son.  Shane walked up to them and asked how his mom was.  After Rex asked Shane to sit down, Shane stated that he would ask his mom, but Rex insisted that Shane could not do that.  When Shane asked if Gigi was in surgery, Rex explained that Gigi did not need surgery, because her brain had died, and that Gigi would not get any better.  Rex stated that Gigi was dying.\n\n\nShane wondered why the doctors could not make his mother better, and Rex expressed that her brain had been hurt too badly.  When Shane cried that Rex was lying, Rex grabbed him and hugged him.  Roxy then hugged Shane and told him that they would both walk inside to see Gigi.  Roxy cried, \"You can see her, and you can talk to her, and you can tell her how great she is, and then you can tell her goodbye, okay?\"  In Gigi's room, when Roxy told Shane to say what was in his heart, Shane pleaded with his mother not to leave.\n\n\nBo ran into Viki in the hall and announced that Gigi was gone.  Bo explained to Viki about how Gigi had been trapped in a basement with a broken generator, and revealed that she was braindead due to carbon monoxide poisoning.  Viki then cried, \"Oh no,\" when she realized that Gigi would be Clint's donor.\n\n\nDr. DeGroff discovered Rex in the hall and asked if Rex had taken the chance to talk to his family.  When Rex indicated that he had, the doctor revealed that they had something that needed to be discussed about what Gigi had wanted.  Just as the doctor began to reveal Gigi's wishes, Natalie ran through the hall and found Rex.\n\n\nNatalie screamed, \"Rex, Rex, oh, I am so glad that I found you.  Listen, whatever you think of Dad, they found a donor.  Dad's getting a new heart.  So, I...I spoke to Mom on the phone.  She said that...that there wasn't a whole lot of information.  She said, uhm, a women died in some accident, something to do with carbon monoxide.  I feel so bad for this woman and her family, but at least now, her death won't be meaningless.  You know, she's...she's...she's a match, Rex, and as soon as they tell her family, Dad's gonna get her heart.\"\n\n\nAt the pool outside of La Boulaie, Blair drank from a glass of wine, as she gazed at the wedding picture of her and Todd with his original face that had included the scar.  As the man with Todd's original face watched Blair, he thought, \"Starr has a mother.  Her name is Blair.\"  Starr walked up and interrupted Blair's thoughts.  Blair wondered if the one great love of her life had been Starr's father.\n\n\nBlair admitted that she believed that Tomas had been lying about what he had been doing when Marty had disappeared.  Blair then showed Starr the wedding picture and declared that she had loved that wedding day.  The man then reflected back on a wedding photo of Blair and Todd with his original look.  Blair maintained that she had been very happy the day she had married Starr's father.\n\n\nBlair questioned how she could move on with Tomas, until she got answers from him.  Blair then jumped up and announced that she was leaving for New York to get the answers.  Starr stated that she was not surprised and then indicated that she would take Blair to the station.  The man continued to watch Blair and Starr, as they started to walk off.\n\n\nBlair asked Starr to remind Jack that Sunday was Father's Day and also informed Starr that Sam had made a gift for Todd.  Starr then revealed that Sam had an imaginary friend with a line on his face and drew a line on her face, as Sam had done.  Blair agreed with Starr that Sam's imaginary friend was just that.  Blair and Starr quickly left, so that Blair could catch her train.\n\n\nThe man picked up the picture and mentally viewed several wedding photos of Blair and the Todd with the scar.  The man began to walk off, when a thug jumped out of the bushes, pointed a gun at the man, and yelled, \"Freeze or you are dead.\" \n\n\n",
