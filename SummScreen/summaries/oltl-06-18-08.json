Later, as Starr prepared the food, the kitchen filled with smoke and triggered the smoke alarm. Blair ran into the kitchen to help Starr. She advised Starr to order take-out food but Starr wasn't interested. Cryptically, Starr told her mother that the least Cole would deserve, after she broke his heart, was a home-cooked meal. Before Blair could delve further into what Starr meant by that statement, Blair received a frantic phone call from Dorian about Addie. At the same time, Cole arrived for his dinner date with Starr. After Blair's abrupt departure, Cole and Starr sat down and ate. Starr seemed unprepared when Cole proposed marriage to her. To avoid answering him, Starr began clearing the table. Cole seemed to realize that Starr wasn't thrilled with the idea of getting married. He began listing all the reasons why it was a great idea but the more that Cole tried convincing Starr, the less thrilled Starr seemed. Finally, Starr stopped Cole. She told Cole that she didn't think they were ready to raise a baby together and that she had decided to give their baby up for adoption. Cole appeared stunned by Starr's decision. \n\n\nAt the new offices of Cramer Enterprises, Dorian was at a loss for words when David announced that he had married her sister, Addie. At first, Dorian was in complete denial, even after Addie waltzed into Dorian's office wearing a wedding dress and veil. Dorian was convinced that Addie had stopped taking her medications and had relapsed. She quickly called Blair and begged her to come to C.E. While Addie, David, and Dorian sat down to await Blair's arrival, David brought up the newlyweds' living arrangements. Dorian bristled at the idea of David moving into her home. She told David, in no uncertain terms, that he would not be welcomed. David appeared unfazed and suggested that he and Addie move in with Viki. He seemed to take delight in telling Dorian that he was certain that Viki would happily offer them a place to stay. Just then Blair arrived. Blair was furious when she realized that David's marriage to Addie was legal. She turned her rage on David and punched him in the face, knocking him to his knees. Addie finally brought the mayhem to a quick end by asking to speak to her daughter alone. Dorian and David stepped out of the office. Once they were alone, Addie told Blair that she didn't have any illusions about David. She knew that David didn't love her and admitted that she didn't love David. Addie went on to explain that David's appeal was that he understood that his \"ticket to ride\" depended on Addie's happiness. Blair was concerned that Addie was still in way over her head because of the Dorian factor. Addie didn't appear worried. She told Blair that she had experience dealing with Dorian and was more than confident that she could handle her sister. \n\n\nIn the hallway, Dorian attempted to bribe David to leave Addie. She failed miserably. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Sarah asked Cris to hide Tina out at his studio. Cris refused to agree without a few answers from Tina. Tina promised to answer all of Cris's questions once they found a safe place to talk. Cris reluctantly agreed to wait until they got to Cris's apartment. Tina was thrilled when she saw Cris's place. She thought it was the perfect place to stay out of sight. Unfortunately, Tina proved to be quite evasive when Cris began firing questions at her. Finally, Cris threatened to call the police. Tina insisted that her situation was too dangerous to involve the police. Cris seemed stunned. He asked Tina why she would involve her daughter in a situation that was too dangerous for the police to handle. \n\n\nJonas was in the back of the limo, talking on his cell phone while he looked at a picture of Sarah and Cris. He vowed, to the person on the other end of the line, that he would find Tina. Jonas then took out his gun and promised not to miss. Before ending the call, he asked the person to gather more information on Talia. Jonas also wanted to know how Talia and Antonio factored into his business in Llanview. \n\n\nViki went to see Charlie before he checked out of the hospital. She cried as she broke off their relationship. Charlie pleaded with Viki to reconsider but she felt that he had irrevocably broken her trust. Viki admitted that she loved Charlie dearly, but things had changed. What they had once shared was gone forever. After Viki left, Charlie reminisced about how he and Viki fell in love. He also decided to attend a 'Friends of Bill W.' meeting. At Llanfair, Viki came home to an empty house and then broke down sobbing. Later, Viki carried a tray of food into the living room but found that she didn't have an appetite. She was consumed with thoughts of Charlie and their journey to love. \n\n\nIn Bo's old office at the police station, Natalie bargained for Jared's freedom. After Clint and Bo signed affidavits, swearing that they wouldn't press charges against Jared, Natalie revealed who the true Buchanan heir was. Clint refused to believe that it was David Vickers. Bo pulled Clint out of the office when he began accusing Natalie of lying and calling her a Judas. Bo asked Clint to settle down and think about what he was saying. He suggested that Clint take a long hard look in the mirror and ask himself if he liked what he saw. Meanwhile, back in the office, Natalie told Nora that she knew her father would react as he did upon learning the truth about David. After Clint calmed down, he returned to the office with Bo and began grilling Jared and Natalie. Jared was careful not to incriminate Nigel as he answered Clint's questions. Clint decided that it would be best if David didn't learn the truth about his paternity. He swore everyone in the room to secrecy. Natalie tried to make peace with her father before she left, but Clint rebuffed her efforts.\n\n\n",
