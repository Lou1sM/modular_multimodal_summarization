According to the test he had scheduled, the incompatible blood types showed that Stacy did not save Shane! Just as Gigi happily wrapped her arms around Schuyler, Stacy and Rex walked in. They merely wanted to inform Gigi that Shane had gone out with Bo and Matthew and that they had an amazing time at the concert.\n\n\nStacy managed to direct a snide comment to her sister when she inquired if Gigi were taking Schuyler or maybe Brody to the second concert. Gigi quickly retorted that Stacy didn't have a clue, as she held up the DNA report. Innocently, Stacy insisted that she just wanted Gigi to have a good time, as she and Rex did, and that it was far better to have someone to go with. As Gigi flaunted the report, she announced that she had something important to tell them. When a panicked Rex asked if Shane's test results were okay, Gigi hesitated. She made the decision to keep quiet and told Rex that Shane was going to baseball camp.\n\n\nAfter Rex and Stacy left, Gigi admitted that she would never be able to tell Rex the truth in the event that Shane had a relapse. She explained to a confused Schuyler that while Stacy must know who the real donor was, she might take off before revealing that person's identity. Schuyler realized that Kyle knew the identity of the real donor, too, and assumed that Stacy was probably blackmailing him, which meant they could, too. Gigi worried that Kyle would remain loyal to Stacy and tell her if they got to him. Schuyler agreed that Stacy had a way of getting what she wanted from men, but that caused something to click for Gigi.\n\n\nAcknowledging that she and Stacy had the same DNA, Gigi decided that she would make that work in her favor. Insisting that she needed a pushup bra and a mini skirt, Gigi planned to \"work it\" like her sister did. She was determined to be as sexy as Stacy. Schuyler felt she was sexier, but didn't want her to get hurt. He expressed his concern at Gigi going too far, but she refused to allow him to talk her out of it.\n\n\nLangston managed to find Markko working at the country club, where she learned that his parents had taken his phone away from him. Markko insisted his parents would eventually come around, while Langston blamed Ray for their predicament, since he had left Dorian. She wanted to know when she would be able to see Markko, who was unable to make any plans. He would have to keep listening to his parents, even if he was 18, he enlightened her. He was not able to afford a dormitory and would have to continue living at home. He felt certain that his parents would calm down.\n\n\nAs the couple shared a kiss, an angry Mr. Rivera cut it short. He reminded his son that he was forbidden to see Langston and, worse, they were kissing in public. Demanding to know if his father was spying on him, Markko lost it when the man referred to Langston as a tramp. When a country club manager approached and inquired about a problem, Mr. Rivera pointed out that the girl was bothering his working son. Markko quickly retorted that Langston was a club member, while his father was not. The manager asked Mr. Rivera to leave the club. As he departed, he advised Markko that he was breaking his mother's heart.\n\n\nA horrified Langston felt that Markko had been rather harsh, having his father tossed out of the club. She felt guilty at breaking up his relationship with his parents, she added. Markko insisted that he was the one accountable for that and insisted that they would not keep him and Langston apart. He made it clear that he would figure it out and would move out, even if he had to work ten jobs. Langston felt that they would never see each other at all, and would be no better off than they were. Markko informed her that he loved her, couldn't live without her, and would make it work. Kissing her again, he pulled away when the manager came by again and ordered him back to work.\n\n\nMaking lots of noise at La Boulaie, Blair roused a sleeping Dorian, who was obviously suffering from a hangover. Blair shared the news of Marcie bringing Hope back for good, just as the baby's cries reached the bedroom. An overjoyed Dorian began to cry but quickly stopped when she realized she would have to stop Todd from ruining Hope's life. Blair admitted that Todd didn't know yet, but would find out soon. As Dorian made plans to have Shaun prevent Todd from going near the baby, she remembered that she had fired him. Blair shared the results of her custody hearing and the fact that neither she nor Todd had won.\n\n\nBlair informed Dorian that she had done her best, but had no luck in getting the judge to change his mind. She would have to move in with Todd. As her mind began to clear even more, Dorian recalled that she had kicked Moe and Noelle out of the house and did not want to live alone. Blair reminded her that she had Langston. A regretful Dorian admitted that she had too much to drink and then had an argument with Langston. The last thing she remembered was Langston pushing her into the pool.\n\n\nDorian suggested that it would be best if Todd moved into La Boulaie. Calling it a strategy, she explained that it would be better for Starr, who would have to fight with Todd at his house every time Cole visited.\n\n\nDownstairs, Starr informed Cole that she was going to teach him how to change Hope's diaper. After he was finished, Cole admitted that it hadn't been too bad. He thought that Hope looked just like Starr, who radiantly reminded Cole that the baby was theirs to keep forever, just as they had dreamed of during her pregnancy. As Cole began to explain that he wouldn't be around to help raise Hope for a while, Dorian, who was wearing her sunglasses indoors and whose hair was awry, interrupted them.\n\n\nDorian, fussing over the baby briefly, confessed to being under the weather. She promised to shower the baby with attention as soon as she felt better. \"She really tied one on,\" Cole remarked after Dorian left the room. As Starr agreed, Cole finally had the chance to confess that he had been arrested and was going to prison.\n\n\nTodd did his best to show T\u00e9a that he was trying to take care of her when he delivered her some breakfast. The attorney wanted to know what he was going to do to save her career, and wondered whether he might scrounge up a magician to save her from being disbarred. She pointed out that Todd didn't even care that her career was in shambles.\n\n\nThrowing that fact that he was the \"love of her life\" into her face once again, Todd informed T\u00e9a that he had made her an appointment with a lawyer. Threatening to beat him if he used the term again, T\u00e9a made a move to jump out of bed but she was physically unable to. Todd insisted that she needed him and he wanted to help her shower and get ready to meet with the lawyer.\n\n\nAs Todd helped T\u00e9a dry off after her shower, he began to kiss her neck. A disgusted Blair expressed her disbelief. She had rung the doorbell but noted that Todd was busy settling T\u00e9a into the Marty Saybrooke suite, she proclaimed. T\u00e9a insisted that she wasn't talking to Todd, who told his ex-wife that T\u00e9a was merely staying with him until she was better. Blair confided that she had seen how cozy they were previously, when they had been watching television with her sons.\n\n\nAs Todd accused her of spying on them, Blair insisted that she was there to see her sons and didn't much care what happened between Todd and T\u00e9a. She told T\u00e9a that she would have to find a new nursemaid, though, as Todd would be moving to Dorian's. A perplexed T\u00e9a waited as Todd explained what had happened at the child custody hearing after she left.\n\n\nAs Layla played with her dog at the park, Fish walked up and jokingly ordered her to leash the dog because it was the law. Thinking he was serious, Layla listened as Fish plopped down next to her and insisted he was kidding. Layla failed to see the humor and wanted to know if Fish had problems with her or the apartment. He assured her he didn't. Suddenly, Kyle jogged by and came to a stop next to their blanket. As Layla wandered off, Fish jumped up. As a sarcastic Fish indicated that he hoped Kyle wasn't running out on his bail, Kyle informed his former frat brother that he was out for a jog.\n\n\nKyle insisted that Schuyler had really been harassing him, but he appreciated Fish saving him. He insisted that there was a big misunderstanding. Fish retorted that he always heard that from people accused of committing a crime. Kyle maintained that he was out for a run and not breaking any laws. He was getting his life back together. A skeptical Fish presumed that was temporary. As Kyle took off, Layla wandered back with the dog.\n\n\nWondering why Fish didn't introduce them, Fish informed her that Kyle was in trouble with the law and wasn't someone she would want to know. She speculated that there was something else that Fish wasn't telling her.\n\n\nFish explained that he and Kyle had been frat brothers in college. Layla wondered if it bothered Fish to see his old friend in trouble. She confirmed that she and Cris were just friends, in answer to Fish's questioning. Cris had been great to her after Talia was killed. \n\n\nFish asked for a second chance with Layla, and mentioned an extra concert ticket that he had. At first, Layla declined, thinking it would be weird if things didn't work out, considering they were roommates. After a moment, she decided a little weirdness wouldn't be so bad and agreed to accompany Fish to the concert. After he left for patrol, she confessed to her dog that Fish was cute, but she wondered what had really happened between him and Kyle.\n\n\nNearby, Rex and Stacy walked through the park. Rex mentioned how Gigi always seemed to be up against a different guy when they saw her, but he explained that according to Bo, Gigi was upset. When Stacy exclaimed that being upset shouldn't turn a woman into a tramp, Rex took exception and became angry. Stacy began to tick off all of the incidents involving her sister and a man but suggested that Rex just forget about Gigi and be happy and to think about their fun time at the concert.\n\n\nStacy admitted that she'd had fun and felt like she belonged to a real family. She didn't want Gigi to wreck it for her. Wondering what they could do for fun, Stacy asked about swimming. Rex admitted that in the old days he used to sign in at the country club under other names and charge those people's accounts.\n\n\nGigi called Kyle and asked to meet with him alone.\n\n\nRex signed himself and Stacy in at the club and informed her that they were going to be known as the Underhills for the day. As they planted themselves by the pool, Stacy asked Rex to apply suntan lotion to her back.\n\n\nLangston returned home, but as Dorian attempted to apologize for her actions at the graduation party, Langston told her to forget it. It was Dorian's fault that Langston and Markko were in their situation of not being able to see each other, and she wanted Dorian to fix it.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cole goes over and discovers for the first time that Marcie brought the baby back to Starr and is ok with them raising her. But he hesitates to tell her what will happen now that he has to go to prison. Dorian is really happy. But they all wonder what will happen now that Blair and Todd must live together under the same roof. Tea finds that out and is not certain what to do. Markko and Langston are being watched over by his father. He tells his father that he won't be prevented from being with the girl he loves. He'll live on his own and work ten jobs if need be. Langston then tells Dorian if she is really sorry for the mess she made, then she needs to \"fix it\" for Langston and Markko. Schuyler gets the DNA test results that prove that Stacy did not save Shane's life. And he encourages Gigi to \"use\" it. But she knows that she still hasn't a clue who the real donor is and only Stacy knows that. But he informs her that so does Kyle Lewis. She then tells him she will find out from Kyle no matter what it takes. Rex and Stacy are right then getting closer while he is trying to get over Gigi.",
