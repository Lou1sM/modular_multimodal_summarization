In the gym, Cole told Langston that he regretted that he had told Starr to stay away and asked if it was too late to apologize to Starr.  Since Starr had already left the gym for graduation, Cole and Langston both believed that she was in the biology hallway.  When Cole was unable to find Starr, Langston felt that Starr had just needed time to herself.  Cole expressed that he wanted to call Starr, but Langston reminded Cole that Starr had lost her cell phone.\n\n\nAt Viki's cabin, Starr retrieved the keys from under the porch and told James that Bull would never find them.  Once Starr and James entered the cabin, Starr grabbed the telephone to call the cops.  However,  James stopped her and said that they would both be dead, if she called them.  James reminded Starr that Bull had never hurt anyone and had never trashed Starr's apartment.  He stated that Starr had no proof against Bull, and that Bull only wanted the money.\n\n\nJames apologized for carjacking Starr and Hope and claimed that the carjacking had been the \"stupidest thing that I have ever done.\"  Starr disagreed and stated that the stupidest thing that James had ever done was to take the money.  She declared that since the graduation was over, and since Bull had surely left the school, she was going home.  As Starr opened the door to leave, James slammed his hand against the door and said, \"I can't let you do that.\"\n\n\nJames insisted again that Bull only wanted the money, and that they would not be safe until James found it.  When Starr demanded to know what was going on, James warned that he was a criminal.  James explained that he had been a mechanic, but he had worked for very bad people at a chop shop.  He insisted that he only stole the money so that he would never have to work at the chop shop again.  James revealed that he had not stolen the money from Bull, but had actually taken the $50,000 from his dad.  James's dad had sent Bull after him.\n\n\nJames explained his history with his dad to Starr.  James's dad had abused him, after James had refused to steal his first car.  James recognized that \"It takes a cast and a sling for me to give in and join the crew.  So yeah, my old man is a piece of work.\"\n\n\nWhen Starr asked about James's mom, James pointed out that his mother had left the home when he was young.  James declared that he had to leave home, or he would have ended up in prison, or dead, or even worse.  When Starr asked what could be worse, James answered that he could have ended up like his dad.\n\n\nWhen Starr questioned why James even stole the money, since he knew that his dad was dangerous, James replied that he had left a note that said that he would repay it.  James explained that he had wanted to leave home to take night courses for his GED at the school where his brother was a teacher's assistant. When he got there, James found out his brother was in Llanview Hospital.  Starr barked, \"Ford's your brother?\"  James asked Starr how she knew Bobby Ford, as his cell phone rang.\n\n\nWhen Starr's phone rang in the high school hall, Bull removed it from his pocket, as Cole and Langston walked into the hall.  Cole and Langston both insisted that they had heard Starr's cell phone, yet there was no sign of Starr.  When Cole questioned why Starr would just disappear after graduation, unless it was due to him, Langston insisted that Starr still loved Cole.  Just as Cole spoke that \"it was just the three of them\" - Cole, Starr, and Langston - Langston revealed that she knew where Starr was.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, as John entered the elevator, Hannah said that Marty would regret that she turned Cole against Hannah, and Marty asked if Hannah were threatening her.  Hannah emphasized that Cole's attitude had only changed towards her since Marty had talked to him, just as John entered the room.  Hannah announced to John that Cole had received bail, so she and Marty were celebrating.  As Hannah started to leave, John insisted that she \"hang around,\" because he had questions for her.\n\n\nAfter John closed the doors, he requested that they go over Hannah's testimony.  When John asked Hannah how she had seen Todd push Marty down the stairs that day, if she had not followed Todd down into the stairwell, Hannah explained that the door had been opened.  John asked, \"Do you have a blue sweater,\" and Hannah responded, \"Doesn't everybody?\"  John announced that the police had found fibers in the stairwell that matched a blue sweater that Hannah had worn in that past.  \n\n\nHannah wanted to know why John was questioning her, when she was the witness who would ensure that Todd would be punished for what he had done.  John insisted that he wanted to make sure that the courts would convict the right person.  John then asked Hannah where she had been the night of Ford's attack.  Hannah maintained that she had not committed the crime against Marty, and that she also had not attacked Ford.  After Hannah left, Marty considered that maybe Todd was right about Hannah, and John believed that Hannah was hiding something.\n\n\nAt the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9, Jessica joined Kelly, who was already seated at a table, and declared that she had told Dr. Levin the whole story about Ford's attack, as she could remember it.  Jessica revealed that Dr. Levin had not believed that she had committed that attack.  When Kelly exclaimed that was good news, Jessica was not sure, because she thought that maybe one of her alters had committed the crime.  After Kelly reminded Jessica that Ford had still not proclaimed that Jessica had attacked him, Jessica insisted that she needed to talk to Ford.  Kelly claimed that Jessica needed to wait, because her memory would return in time.  Jessica cried that she had to find out what had happened that night, not only for herself, but also for Brody and Bree.  Kelly exclaimed that if Jessica were going to the hospital to question Ford, Kelly was going with her.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Nurse Tiffany gave Ford his dinner, and after she left, Ford found an envelope with his name under the cover of the meal.  When Ford heard a quick knock on the door, he hid the envelope.  Cristian and Layla carried in a pizza, and Layla sarcastically asked why Karen had not delivered Ford's pizza.  Ford slyly replied that Karen had only been filling in for Langston.  Layla cried that Ford was only a player, and that he had forced Langston to sleep with him, which cause Langston's breakup with Markko.  When Ford reminded Layla that Langston was over with Markko before Ford had even slept with her, Cristian declared, \"You made someone mad enough to want you dead.\"  Ford then glanced at the hidden envelope.\n\n\nFord claimed that Cristian and Layla tried to blame the victim, and Layla yelled, \"What you did is wrong.  You hurt Markko, you hurt Langston, and who knows who else.\"  Jessica and Kelly arrived in the hall outside of Ford's room, and were prepared to talk to Ford.\n\n\nFord thanked Cristian and Layla for the pizza and for saving his life.  Cristian then announced that Ford had to find a new place to live, since Markko was their friend.  As Cristian and Layla left Ford's room, they found Jessica and Kelly in the hall.  Cristian wondered why Jessica wanted to visit Ford.  Kelly lied and stated that she wanted to check on Ford, and that Jessica was only at the hospital for a doctor's appointment.  As Cristian and Layla said their goodbyes, Jessica again apologized to them both for what she had done.  Layla remarked, \"It's all good,\" and Cristian and Layla left the hospital.\n\n\nWhen Jessica and Kelly entered Ford's room, Kelly introduced herself and demanded that Ford was to go nowhere near Jessica, once he was released from the hospital.  However, Jessica begged Ford to let her know if she had put him in the hospital.  Ford realized that Jessica did not remember the night of his attack and declared that he also did not remember.  As Jessica insisted that he knew the truth and demanded to hear it, Kelly asserted that they should leave.\n\n\nBack at the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9, Nate and Dani entered and sat at a table.  When Nate complimented her on her good job at the bank, Dani accepted that there was an advantage in being Todd Manning's daughter.  Dani explained, \"You know, people hate him so much, they'll do anything to avoid having to deal with him.\"  When Dani stated that they should tell Nate's mother about the money, Nate hesitated and stressed that he wanted to figure out what to tell her first.  As Peering at a Sun column and picture, Nate's mother stood outside the caf\u00e9 and peeked through the door.\n\n\nOnce Nate's mom entered the caf\u00e9, Nate hugged her and introduced her to Dani.  Mrs. Salinger remembered Dani from the musical and voiced that Dani was \"such a pretty girl.\"  Nate's mom stated that she was job-hunting and invited Dani to their home for a celebration, once she landed a job.  Nate revealed that he knew about the notice from the bank to take their home but conveyed that they did not have to worry about money.  Mrs. Salinger feared that they would need a little miracle, and as he handed his mom a check for $50,000, Nate announced that they already had one.\n\n\nShocked, Nate's mother asked if the check was \"real\" and asked how Nate had received it.  When Nate lied and insisted that he had won the money in a lottery, his mother reminded him that stores would not sell lottery tickets to minors.  Nate fudged his way through his lottery ticket purchase, and his mother was very grateful to receive the money.  After Nate's mom claimed that she would place half of the money into his college fund, they hugged.  Nate then told his mother that he needed to take Dani home, and Nate and Dani left the caf\u00e9.  His mother stayed and looked again at the Sun article and pictures.\n\n\nBack in Ford's hospital room, Ford again studied the note and called John, who was still at the courthouse.  John escorted Marty to her car, as Hannah watched.  Hannah then looked at a picture of James and Starr on her cell phone.\n\n\nOnce Jessica and Kelly left the hospital, Jessica exclaimed that Ford had known something else about the night of his attack.  Jessica yelled that he had looked right at her, as he had stated that she was guilty.\n\n\nOnce John entered the Ford's hospital room, he asked Ford if his memory was returning.  Ford claimed, \"Yeah, it's all coming back.  I remember what happened.\"  John asked, \"So, who attacked you?\"\n\n\nAs Bull spoke on the phone to his boss and told him that he had found \"the kid,\" who would find the money, Cristian and Layla walked into the Buenas Dias Caf\u00e9.  Cristian reminded Layla that they still needed to tell Layla's mother about their engagement.  Cristian and Layla agreed to finally tell her mother, and they left the caf\u00e9.  Bull made a phone call.\n\n\nBull demanded that James, who was still at Viki's cabin, return the money to James's dad.  As soon as James was off the phone, he requested that Starr call the cops.  James gave his heartfelt thanks to Starr for everything that she had done, however, Starr insisted that she would not call the cops.  Starr did insist on calling her family to check on her \"little girl,\" since it appeared that Starr would not be home immediately, \"because like it or not, you and me are in this together.\"\n\n\nCole and Langston did not find Starr, once they arrived at the La Boulaie kitchen.  Langston told Cole that she would look for Starr upstairs.  Langston carried Hope down into the kitchen for Cole to see.  Langston then revealed that Addie had stated that Starr had not yet returned home after graduation.  When Cole asked Langston if Starr had mentioned anything, Langston admitted that Starr had not talked to her much lately, since she was still upset over what had happened with Markko.  Langston handed Hope her dinner, and Langston tried to explain to Cole what had happened with Markko and Ford.  Langston claimed that Markko still hated her, and that \"I threw it away for that jerk.\"  Langston begged Hope to \"stick to the winners\" like Hope's mom and dad.\n\n\nLangston then begged Cole for his forgiveness.  Cole remarked that he did not have time to think about that, when he still needed to find Starr and make things right.  Cole handed Hope to Langston, as Hannah tried to call Cole from the courthouse.  When Cole sent Hannah's message to voicemail, Hannah begged, \"Hi Cole...please call me as soon as you get this.  I have to talk to you.  There's something really important that I have to tell you.\"  As Cole started to leave the La Boulaie kitchen, his phone rang again.  He answered the phone.  James watched Cole, as Starr said, \"Cole,\" and Cole said, \"Starr.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cole and Langston both try but fail to find Starr. She's with James while Bull (the guy who's hunting him down for the money) has Starr's phone. James finally breaks down and tells Starr that he has been forced to help his father work in a chop shop to steal cars and has been abused as a child. So he has been on the run. And that's why he has taken the money from Bull. He tells her that he was hoping to finish school and start a legitimate business with his older brother who got a scholarship and has been working as a teaching assistant until he got assaulted. Hearing that, she figures out that Ford is his brother. She then trusts and wants to help James after hearing his story. Ford is awake and seems to know what is going on. Jessica wants to find out if one of her alters might have tried to kill him. But he won't tell her. John goes to talk to him. Hannah indicates to John and to Marty that Todd Manning might be correct in his theory that she pushed Marty and framed Todd for it when they see irrational behavior in Hannah.",
