    "soap_central": "\nThe Mother Is Always The Last to Know:\n\n\nCris refused to cut Tina any slack for the way she had treated Sarah over the years. He continued to grill Tina with questions about the danger that she was in but Tina remained tightlipped. Sarah took control of the situation before things escalated. She asked Cris to take a walk and cool off while she spoke to her mother privately. As soon as Cris left, Sarah and Tina began talking. Sarah told Tina about Nash's death and the song that she had composed for his memorial. Tina remembered hearing Sarah sing it in the park and told her daughter that she thought it was beautiful. Sarah was flattered by the praise but changed the subject. It was too soon, Sarah said, for her to talk about Nash. When Tina apologized for missing a large part of Sarah's life, Sarah suggested that they remain focused on the present. Sarah then asked about the trouble that her mother was in. They were interrupted by a call from Cord. He wanted to check on his daughter. Tina seemed nervous when she realized he was on the phone. Sarah, meanwhile, hinted to Cord that her mother had returned to Llanview. From what Sarah said, it appeared that Cord wished them well and hoped that Tina would stick around for more than a brief visit. \n\n\nCarlotta walked into the diner and found Antonio and Talia kissing. Carlotta was furious and began chastising her son for becoming involved with the woman who had broken his heart. Talia and Antonio were forced to confess their duplicity. Carlotta was hurt that they didn't tell her sooner but understood why the felt they couldn't, given the circumstances. When Cris entered the closed diner, Carlotta scolded him for his role in the deception but forgave him almost immediately. While Carlotta went to the kitchen to prepare a take-home package of food for Cris and Sarah, Antonio brought Cris up to speed on the events surrounding Lee Ramsey's murder. Cris appeared somewhat uncomfortable when Antonio and Talia insisted on finding the mystery woman who had been seen fleeing Ramsey's penthouse. \n\n\nCris returned to his studio a short while later. Tina asked Sarah to walk the dog, David Vickers, while Tina had a word with Cris. After Sarah left, Tina told Cris that she wasn't trying to be evasive but she wanted them to have deniability if something happened to Tina and people came around asking questions. She went on to tell Cris that she thought he was good for Sarah and respected the way he always stuck up for her daughter. Tina surprised him by asking Cris to turn her over to the police if he thought it would be for the best. Tina trusted Cris to know what would be in Sarah's best interest. \n\n\nAt home, Marcie talked to Michael about her new volunteer job at the hospital. She showed him a picture that one of the kids drew for her. Marcie then confessed that she had seen Sam and Starr at the park earlier that day. Michael was concerned but, before they could discuss it further, John stopped by to talk to Michael about the x-rays and CT scans that he had found in Ramsey's office. Marcie insisted that John stay for dinner. Fearing Marcie's culinary skills, John tried his best to wiggle out of the invitation, but Marcie refused to accept no for an answer. She finally managed to bribe John with cold beers in the fridge. Michael wasn't thrilled with invitation. He continued to be worried about Marcie's reaction to seeing Sam in the park and wanted to talk to her. Marcie assured her husband that he didn't have anything to worry about. \n\n\nWhen John returned from the kitchen, he asked Michael if he had a chance to review the x-rays. Michael did and informed John that the woman in the x-ray was lucky to be alive. From what he could see, she had suffered a debilitating spinal injury that most likely left her barely ambulatory. He also concluded, from the CT scans, that she had suffered a severe head trauma that in all probability resulted in post head injury dementia. Michael speculated that the woman most likely had a complete shift in personality. As they discussed the case, Michael wondered how the woman managed to escape. John didn't know but he did mention that the only other person at the penthouse had been Todd. As John studied the CT scan, he noticed a series of numbers on the bottom of the page. When he asked Michael about it, Michael told him that the numbers identified the machine that had taken the scan. A short time later, just as Marcie was ready to seat everyone for dinner, John received a phone call. Moments later, Michael was paged to the hospital. \n\n\nMarty woke up and found Todd in her bedroom. She seemed rattled and asked for Lee Ramsey. It became clear that Marty was suffering from profound memory loss because she didn't recognize Todd. Todd asked her to trust him but Marty wasn't inclined to do so. She accused Todd of trying to feed her pills to make her sleep. Todd didn't deny it. He told Marty that she needed her rest. Marty kept pressing Todd for answers about Lee and was stunned to learn that he was dead. She told Todd that Lee had planned to take her to a new doctor that very day. Todd asked Marty what she remembered of the incident before he had arrived. As Marty recalled fractured sounds, she became quite distraught and nearly violent. Todd seemed taken aback by Marty's odd behavior but didn't have time to question it. \n\n\nMarty demanded to know if Todd had murdered Lee. Todd told her that he had nothing to do with it; he had arrived after Lee had been killed. Marty then asked Todd what his name was. Todd waited for a reaction when he told her \"Todd\" but there wasn't one. A short time later, Janet, Marty's nurse, came into the room. Marty was happy to see her. Janet reassured Marty that Todd had saved them and that he could be trusted. Marty seemed to settle down after that, so Janet left to get Marty's prescriptions refilled. Todd followed Janet out and thanked her for helping with Marty. She reminded Todd that she only told Marty what he had told her to say. Before continuing with her errand, Janet warned Todd not to make a liar out of her. After Marty woke up from a brief nap, she asked Todd how they knew each other. Todd seemed surprised by the question. Marty pointed out that his reaction earlier, when he had told her his name, suggested that they knew each other in the past. Marty wanted to know every detail about that association. \n\n\nLangston and Markko were hanging out with their friends in a hotel room during a class trip when one of the chaperones heard the commotion in the girls' room and knocked on the door. She warned the boys, who were hiding, that they had until 11p.m. bed check to get back to their rooms. After the chaperon left, one of the girls asked Langston and Markko why Cole and Starr didn't join them. Langston tried to provide a plausible excuse but the girls didn't appear interested in hearing what she had to say. Another girl was full of gossip about Starr's dad and tried to imply that it was because of him. Langston bristled when she heard the unflattering comments and went to defend her friend. Unfortunately, Langston's reaction prompted one of the teens to ask if Langston was hiding something about Starr. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr told Cole that she didn't want to hurt him but that she didn't feel that she was ready to become a mother. Cole pleaded with Starr to reconsider her decision to give the baby up for adoption. He told her that the baby was the only family that he had left. Starr pointed out that he still had her, but soon learned that wouldn't be the case if she gave their child up for adoption. Before he walked out, Cole told her that he couldn't be with her if she could give away his child. Starr was upset after Cole's departure but she remained steadfast in her determination to give her child up for adoption. She went to see Marcie McBain to tell her that she was pregnant. Starr then made a surprising request. She asked Marcie if she would be interested in adopting her baby. \n\n\nA night guard at the cemetery showed John some damage to a lock on a gate before pointing to Cole. Cole was huddled up against his mother's final resting place, visibly upset. \n\n\nJonas learned some important information about Talia. As he passed the diner, Jonas happened to look in just as Antonio and Talia, caught up in the moment and tearing off clothes, were passionately kissing.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cristian grudgingly agrees to let Tina stay in his home as Sara has asked of him. But, meanwhile, he notices his brother and the cops looking for this \"woman in question\". Antonio and Talia reveal to Carlotta that they have not broken up, are still together, but had to have everybody believing that she dumped him for John. She is not happy that her son lied to her but is happy that he is getting serious with Talia. Todd Manning and his body guard hide Marty in a new place and promise to take care of her. Janet, Ramsey's previous hired nurse is helping them. Marty admits she does not remember Todd or anything else. But she can sense she's had a history with him and demands that he tells her how they know each other. Starr tells Cole that it's completely unrealistic for the two of them to become parents so young. But he tells her he cannot accept that she doesn't want to raise their baby when it's the only family he has left. When she's alone Starr goes to see Marcie, alone, and asks her if she will adopt Starr's baby.",
