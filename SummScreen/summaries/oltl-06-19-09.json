Layla directed several negative remarks at Cris, but he stood his ground and questioned why his style of dress bothered her.  Unable to offer a valid reason, Layla responded with a frown.\n\n\nCris was upset when Layla informed him that she had a date with Oliver.  After reminding Layla that Oliver had broken her heart before, Cris warned Layla that it was a terrible idea to date a roommate.  Thrilled that her upcoming date was causing Cris grief, Layla continued to antagonize Cris by reminding him that he had married Vanessa, his former roommate.\n\n\nWhen Layla left the room to prepare for her date, Cris approached Oliver and warned him not to cause Layla any pain.  After threatening to physically harm Fish if he hurt Layla, Cris suggested that Oliver surprise Layla with flowers.  As she eavesdropped on her roommates' conversation, Layla smiled and was touched by Cris's show of concern for her.\n\n\n \n\nAfter using false names to gain entry into the Llanview Country Club, Rex and Stacy sipped wine and enjoyed the good life.  Stacy laughed as Rex explained how to pull off the perfect con job.  Upon thorough investigation, the headwaiter informed Rex and Stacy that he was aware that they were frauds and called for security to escort them off the premises.  After fleeing security personnel, Rex and Stacy sought refuge in an unoccupied room, where they shared a passionate kiss.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler worried as Gigi prepared to pay Kyle a visit.  Removing her coat, Gigi displayed a revealing dress and asked Schuyler if her attire was sexy enough to get a reaction out of Kyle.  Convinced that her scheme would never work, Schuyler urged Gigi to reconsider her plan to seduce Kyle.  Determined to learn the true identity of Shane's donor, Gigi insisted that Kyle was the only person who could provide her answers.  After agreeing to watch the bar while Gigi ran her errand, Schuyler wondered if Gigi would consider having sex with Kyle in return for the truth.   With a look of disgust, Gigi stated that she hoped that she would never be faced with that dilemma.\n\n\nWhile Kyle was getting dressed, Roxy barged into his apartment at the Angel Square Hotel and demanded that he move out at once.  After threatening to reveal the identity of Shane's donor if Roxy caused him any trouble, Kyle related that he had no intention of moving out until his legal matters were resolved.  Kyle informed Roxy that he was expecting company and asked her to leave.\n\n\nUpset over her failure to rid herself of Kyle, Roxy wandered into Rodi's in search of a drink.  Upon discovering Schuyler tending bar, Roxy asked for a drink and began inquiring about his relationship with Stacy.  Unsatisfied with Schuyler's bartending skills, Roxy mixed her own drink as she encouraged him to pursue Stacy.\n\n\nConsuming a large amount of alcohol, Roxy spoke negatively of Stacy and blamed her for Rex and Gigi's breakup.  Roxy continued to drink and comment about Stacy's interference in Rex and Gigi's relationship.  Schuyler realized that Roxy was withholding information concerning the donor and attempted to manipulate Roxy into revealing what she knew.  Despite her drunken stupor, Roxy refused to spill the beans and retreated to a nearby table.  Roxy sat in the corner and continued to drown her sorrows.\n\n\nGigi showed up at Kyle's apartment and began to flirt with him.  Insisting that she could be as enticing as her sister, Gigi wrapped her arms around Kyle and stated that they both possessed something that the other needed.  Although a shocked Kyle maintained that he had no interest in whatever Gigi was offering, Gigi persisted and planted a kiss on Kyle.  \n\n\nAfter Kyle failed to react to her advances, a confused Gigi pulled away and questioned what she had gotten herself into.  Embarrassed by her behavior, Gigi admitted that she knew the truth about the bone marrow switch and begged Kyle to reveal the true identity of Shane's donor.  Kyle initially denied any involvement, but had a change of heart when Gigi maintained that she needed to know the truth in case Shane suffered a relapse.  Lashing out at Kyle, Gigi screamed, \"How can you live with yourself?\"\n\n\nKyle offered to make a deal with Gigi.  Relating that Natalie had plans to have him tossed in jail, Kyle stated that he would tell Gigi every detail concerning Shane's transplant if Gigi agreed to convince Natalie to drop the criminal charges against him.  In tears, Gigi told Kyle that Natalie hated her and would never do her any favors.  Unmoved by Gigi's tears, Kyle remarked, \"Save me and I'll tell you everything!\"\n\n\nGigi returned to Rodi's and informed Schuyler of Kyle's request.  Gigi told Schuyler that she would never learn the truth without Kyle's help.  Staring at a drunken Roxy, Schuyler smiled and insisted, \"We might have another option!\"\n\n\nAt Todd's home, Blair took great pleasure in informing T\u00e9a that the judge had ordered the Manning family to reside under one roof.  Stating that she had no intention on losing her children to the foster system, Blair announced that she was moving into Todd's home and suggested that T\u00e9a pack her bags.  As T\u00e9a and Blair argued, Todd was the voice of reason.  Reminding Blair that T\u00e9a had suffered a serious injury, Todd told Blair that he intended to care for T\u00e9a at his home.  When Blair refused to live under the same roof with T\u00e9a, Todd suggested that Blair make herself at home in the garage.\n\n\nAgreeing that she and Blair could never reside in the same home, T\u00e9a declared that she would leave.  Refusing to allow T\u00e9a to leave, Todd insisted that he wanted her to stay so that he could care for her properly.  Blair announced that T\u00e9a could stay at Todd's home, but Todd would move into La Boulaie.  Laughing at Blair's proposal, Todd refused to leave his home.   Fed up with Todd's lack of cooperation, Blair blurted out that Starr was raising Hope.   Upon learning that Marcie had returned Hope to Starr, Todd bolted out of the house.  As Blair attempted to prevent Todd from leaving, T\u00e9a blocked Blair's path.   T\u00e9a declared, \"We need to clear up who is living where and with whom.\"\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Cole informed a devastated Starr that he had been arrested for possession of drugs and sentenced to two years in prison.  Cole detailed his reunion with Asher and assured Starr that he never intended to use the drugs that Asher had placed in his pocket.  To Cole's surprise, Starr said that she believed him.  In tears, Starr told Cole that she loved him and couldn't bear to lose him.  Cole blamed himself for losing both Starr and Hope again.  Continuing to proclaim her love for Cole, Starr reassured him that everything would turn out fine.  As Todd rushed into the house, Cole professed his love for Starr and asked her to be his wife.\n\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Cole informs Starr that he is sentenced to a mandatory 2 years in prison because they believe he violated his probation, she is devastated and tells him they must find him a lawyer, find a way to fight this and she promises she will never leave him. Knowing that they now have Hope, he then proposes to her. Blair, Todd and Tea are not certain what they will do now that the judge has ruled that Todd and Blair and the kids must live together under the same roof. Gigi goes to see if she can motivate Kyle Lewis to tell her who the real stem cell donor was that saved Shane's life. But he tells her that he needs her to get Natalie to drop the charges against him before he can provide that information. She then concludes she doesn't know what to do. Schuyler then notices that Roxy might also know their secret.",
