Miles then mentions that David was released from prison and worries that John might know something about who really killed Spencer. They hear knocking at the door, and Marty find John on the other side. Miles wants to know why John is there. John says he's there on police business. Miles tries to get information about the murder case from John, but he doesn't give Miles any. He asks to speak to Marty alone, but Miles has a problem with that while Marty doesn't. Miles tries to stop her from talking but gets a phone call from his lawyer, which he has to take. Once he's out of the room, John again offers to help Marty if she tells him the truth. She insists that she told him everything she knows, but he remains unconvinced that she's the murderer. Miles returns from the other room, and Marty tells John that they're finished. After John leaves, Miles asks Marty what John wanted to know. She covers by saying that John was there to get her opinion on the profile of the killer. Miles accepts that and says that he's worried about Marty. She knows he's only worried because if she gets arrested, he'll lose all the leverage he has against her. He tells her that he won't lose it all, which prompts her to warn him not to hurt John. He assures her that he'll only hurt John if John takes her away because John will be the bad guy then. \n\n\nDavid arrives at John's apartment because he has nowhere else to go. He reasons that John owes him something for cheating him out of the ten million dollars he was supposed to get from Asa. As David talks, John stares at him, astonished. \n\n\nIn the interrogation room, Bo and Talia are trying to get Kirk to admit to his involvement in the hate crimes, but he tells them they don't have proof of anything. Bo has Talia show Kirk pictures of each crime scene, but Kirk remains adamant that they don't have enough evidence to connect him to anything. Bo is convinced that they'll find some way to make the charges stick and put Kirk in jail for the rest of his life. Bo then presents more evidence, which Kirk scoffs at. Bo tries to reason with Kirk to get him to confess, but Kirk remains steadfast. After more prodding, Kirk lawyers up. Bo asks him for the name of his lawyer, but Kirk demands a public defender instead. Talia realizes that Kirk doesn't want to give the name of an OPP sympathizer. She handcuffs him to bring him to a holding cell. \n\n\nAdriana comes to see Tate at the police station. He tells her about Kirk being arrested. She's shocked, believing that Tate would know his father is a racist. He reminds her that he and his father aren't close, and says he can't believe that Kirk could do something like this. Adriana tells him that she couldn't believe that her family and friends could have been targets of a hate crime. She then wonders if Kirk could be the one behind the arsons and bombings. Tate refuses to believe Kirk is a racist and accuses Bo of just wanting to put a check mark in the win column. Adriana insists that Bo wants to find the right man. She hopes that whoever did all the hate crimes, and everyone like him, gets put away for a long time. Tate asks her if she'll hold it against him if Kirk is guilty because he came from his father. She assures him that she couldn't especially because he and Kirk weren't close. Tate calms down and mentions that he's not like his father, just like Adriana isn't like her mother. \n\n\nAs Bo and Talia lead Kirk to a holding cell, Tate offers to get Kirk a lawyer. Kirk refuses his help, though. Bo has another officer take Kirk to his holding cell, and works to get the evidence against Kirk ready for the district attorney. Adriana tells Tate that he should go home and get some rest. He thinks the press has already found out about this and realizes he can't go home and has nowhere else to go. Adriana offers to let Tate sleep on her sofa. He greatly appreciates that offer.\n\n\n\"Prom Night: The Musical\" continues. Cole and Starr kiss outside and the rain stops. She realizes what a huge mistake she made in pushing Cole away and they declare their love for each other. He wants to bring her into the gym so they can say they went to prom together. \n\n\nBritney and everyone else in the gym are shocked to hear that Markko and Langston were named prom king and queen. Markko and Langston think it's a big joke until Marcie encourages them to come up on stage to accept their crowns. When they get to their thrones, Marcie coos and baby talks at them about how cute they are as she crowns them. They, however, look disgusted. Marcie tells them to say something. Langston grabs the microphone and both of them threaten to hurt whoever voted for them. Markko wants to abdicate his crown. Langston agrees, but then decides to give her crown to Starr when she sees Cole and Starr enter the gym. Markko follows suit, giving Cole his crown. Marcie tries to stop them from giving up their crowns, but Langston threatens to have the votes counted. Marcie relents. Cole and Starr share a dance. Starr, Britney, and Langston do a number where Starr and Britney snipe at each other while Langston encourages them to make prom a night to remember.\n\n\nStarr jokingly yells at Langston for giving up the crown. Langston wonders what happened to Cole and Starr. Starr decides to tell Langston the story later because she wants to spend some time with Cole. Langston happily realizes that Starr and Cole are back together. Starr and Cole then surmise that Britney must be pissed off at them. Cole wants to make it up to her, but first brings Starr to the lockers rooms to dry off. \n\n\nMarcie finds Langston and Markko in the hallway and says that she's giving up on getting them together. The teens admit to not hating each other and do a reprise of the number they did about being freaks.\n\n\nStarr is amused to see Langston and Markko being all nice to each other. She and Cole prepare to leave, but Britney stops them. She chastises Cole for leading her on and accuses Starr of only wanting Cole back because someone else took an interest in him. She then says that Cole and Starr deserve each other. Cole admits that Britney's right. He and Starr leave. Britney's friends want to know what she said to them, but she won't tell them anything. She does a number about Starr and Cole being trash, while flashing back on all the times she's felt hurt by them.\n\n\nAfter the prom, Marcie tells Langston and Markko that they have a lot in common for people who detest each other. As she walks away, Markko offers Langston a ride home. She starts to ridicule his car, and he rescinds the offer. She backs off and admits that she would like a ride from him. As they walk to the car, they come together and share a kiss.\n\n\nCole drives Starr home. They talk about how unreal this seems. Then they worry about what their mothers will think about them being back together, but they realize that their feelings should be the only thing that matters. They take some time to enjoy being with each other. Cole wants to finish the dance they started at prom and turns on the car radio. \"Together\" happens to be playing at that exact moment. They dance to the music and kiss in the moonlight as \"Prom Night: The Musical\" ends.\n\n\n",
