When Marty remarked that she couldn't believe she ever liked Todd in the past, Todd laughed and stated that she may have lost her memory but was the same old Marty. Marty questioned why she should put her trust in someone she didn't know, and demanded that Todd give her answers concerning her past. Realizing that Marty was aware that they shared a past connection, Todd admitted to meeting her in college but refused to divulge any further information. \n\n\nJohn found a distraught Cole crying near his mother's burial site. When John questioned why Cole broke into the cemetery and couldn't wait until morning to visit his mother, Cole stated that he needed to tell his mother about the horrible mess that was occurring in his life. Cole revealed that Starr wanted to give their child up for adoption. Cole told John how much he missed his mother and felt that losing his child would leave him with no family at all. John understood Cole's desire to raise his child, but suggested that perhaps Starr felt her decision was best for all concerned - including their unborn child. Cole expressed his anger with Todd. Cole felt Starr's decision was a result of her fear of Todd's possible actions if Starr were to have Cole's child. Cole was angered that his mother was dead and Todd was still alive. John agreed that Todd was a terrible human being, but was more concerned with Cole's state of mind. \n\n\nJanet was worried when she entered the room and found a frantic Marty questioning Todd. Marty told Janet that she was frustrated because she had learned that the man she trusted was dead, and she was now forced to trust Todd-who wouldn't provide her with any answers. When Marty refused to take the pills that Janet offered her, Todd convinced her to take her medication and sent Janet off to prepare Marty's dinner. Before leaving, Janet handed Marty the picture of Marty and John. Instantly, Marty grew calm. Todd observed Marty's reaction to viewing the photo. Marty told Todd that the worst part of her condition was feeling such a strong connection to the picture, but having no idea why. Marty had one last request of Todd-she wanted to know about the man in the picture. Todd told Marty that John was a bad man who had left her for dead. Marty didn't appear to believe Todd, but Todd insisted that John was a horrible person and besides a flaky aunt, she had no other living relatives. Todd's words pained Marty. \n\n\nInside the girls' hotel room, Langston, Markko, and the teens gathered. When the other teens began questioning Langston about what was actually going on with Starr and Cole, Langston became agitated. The teens were aware of the night that Todd found Starr and Cole in bed together, and began to wonder if something more had occurred that night. Markko convinced their friends that Starr and Cole had snuck off to be together, and urged them to give the couple some privacy. Alone together, Langston confided in Markko that she wished she and Starr were able to live a fun and carefree life like their friends, but instead they had to deal with life-changing issues. Markko told Langston that she and Starr might have been forced to grow up fast, but he assured her that their situation was unlike that of Starr and Cole. Markko stated that they didn't have to deal with the same problems that their friends faced, and attempted to convince Langston that Starr wouldn't be upset with her for enjoying life. \n\n\nAt Marcie's apartment, Starr blurted out that she was pregnant and informed a shocked Marcie that she wanted Marcie and Michael to raise the baby. Sensing that Marcie was upset with her, Starr asked Marcie what was wrong. Marcie lashed out at Starr and reminded her of the terrible lie that she had told about Todd abusing Sam. Marcie was furious with Starr and stated that Starr's actions caused her a lot of pain. Starr apologized but insisted that Marcie was the perfect person to raise her baby. When Marcie asked if her parents knew about the pregnancy, Starr admitted that Blair did, but warned Marcie that is was important that Todd not be made aware of her condition yet. Starr stated that she had researched closed adoptions and informed Marcie that legally no one could prevent her from giving her child to Marcie and Michael. When Marcie inquired about Cole's thoughts concerning her decision, Starr deflected the questioning and assured Marcie that Marcie was the perfect person to raise Starr's child. \n\n\nStarr expressed her sorrow over hurting Marcie. Marcie attempted to convince Starr that she was fine, but appeared bothered when Starr admitted to witnessing her breakdown after the decision was made at Sam's custody hearing. Marcie stated that she was distraught over realizing that Sam was permanently out of her life, but insisted that she had come to terms with the situation. Marcie suggested that perhaps Starr was using her to seek revenge against Todd, but Starr was adamant that her decision had nothing to do with getting back at Todd. Starr insisted that her decision was in the best interest of her child. Marcie asked Starr to consider the possible outcome if the McBains were to adopt the baby. Marcie told Starr that Todd had threatened to kill her and Michael if he wasn't granted custody of Sam. Marcie feared that Todd would cause a great deal of problems if she were to grant Starr's request. Marcie commended Starr over her decision to do right by her child, but insisted that she needed to do the same. Marcie said it would be in the best interest of Starr's unborn child if she declined Starr's offer. \n\n\nWith certainty, Marcie told Starr that she couldn't adopt her child, and assured her that many other couples would love to care for her baby. Refusing to accept no for an answer, Starr asked Marcie to discuss the matter with Michael. Marcie believed Michael would agree with her, and said goodbye to Starr. The two shared an emotional embrace. As Marcie closed the door behind Starr, she looked saddened. On the other side of the door, tears welled up in Starr's eyes. \n\n\nCole told John that he wouldn't sit back and allow Starr to give away his child. The two discussed how much they missed Marty. Cole asked for a moment alone with his mother and John obliged. Standing next to his mother's crypt, Cole vowed to find a way to keep Marty's grandchild. \n\n\nTodd watched Marty as she slept.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John finds Cole by his mother's gravesite and very upset after Starr has told him she wants to give their baby up for adoption. He tells him that he cannot accept that since the baby is the only family he has left and the only \"memory\" of his two deceased parents. Little do they know that Marty is not far away. While Todd keeps Janet in a private room with the help of Ramsey's nurse, Janet, Marty demands that Todd tells her how they know each other. He doesn't know how to answer that. But when he notices that she has a picture of herself and John, he realizes that she remembers nothing about him either. So Todd convinces her that John was a \"bad man\" who failed to save her life. Starr goes to \"drop the bombshell\" upon Marcie that she is pregnant and she'd like for Marcie to adopt her baby. But Marcie does not think that would work, given the situation with Starr's father. Langston and Marco observe that all of their friends are so immature, whereas Starr and Cole may never again have a chance to \"be young\" again.",
