Cris is under contract to him now and he doesn't want his man subjected to any distractions; he needs to stay focused.  Evangeline is an inspiration, not a distraction, Cris assures him. When she conveys her disappointment due to losing some clients because of her blindness, he in turn encourages her, urging her to remember the rush of the courtroom. Layla flirts with Vincent and Rex bets against Cris, which irks Adriana. She doesn't understand that Rex is merely going with the odds due to Cris' injured hand. \n\n\nClaudia arrives in California and shows up on Nash's doorstep early. He greets her fresh from the shower and with nothing more than a towel wrapped around him. She advises him that she can't be played and that his method is therefore not effective. She assures him that she wasn't followed by her father's men and agrees to a tour of the winery.  Afterwards, she regrets that she can't sign the contract to loan him the money as she doesn't have it and would need to get it from her father.  He shows her proof of Reston's threats against his daughter, in the form of the note left in the baby's crib. She believes it to be fake and asks for more proof. While there she receives a call from Rex, advising that there's been no sign of Tess.  When she leaves, she vows to win Nash back, even if it means selling out her father.\n\n\nJess insists on visiting Norman Leeds and waits behind as her parents go into his room first. The man is not awake and both Viki and Clint voice their hatred of him while holding each other back from conducting physical harm to the man. When Jess steps into the room, she suddenly has a flashback and is able to recall everything up to actually being in the house with the man. He begins to stir as she tells him off and warns him that he will burn in hell. She asks to be taken to the bar where she met the man and leaves with her parents. Antonio stays behind to voice his own hateful thoughts to the man. Suddenly, he goes into cardiac arrest and cannot be saved.  At the bar, Jess has more flashbacks and encounters Rose, another of Leeds' victims. The girl denies anything happening to her but comes to accept it when Jess calmly talks to her, suggesting that she talk to others and seek help.\n\n\nThe fight starts and Layla provides play by play for Evangeline. Cris has a difficult fight and is knocked out. Adriana again thinks she's face to face with her stalker when Dorian's assistant mentions \"floating like a butterfly\" in reference to Cris' moves in the ring.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica has tried everything and yet she can't remember the things that everyone expects her to. She goes to see Leeds and he just lies there unconscious. He has little effect on her. She then goes to the bar and meets Rose. She gives the woman a pep talk and leaves. She feels the memories trying to return but they don't. She can hear her child voice in her head but that is all. Antonio leaves Jessica with her parents and goes to see Leeds. He tells the man that Jessica is over him and able to get back to her life now. The man flatlines. The nurses try to revive him but he dies what seems to be a peaceful death. Antonio knows this man will never have peace even in death. Adriana is on her way to the fight. She catches Daryl following her and freaks out. He tells he was just making a delivery to Rex. She calms down and they go to the fight together. While the fight is taking place, Daryl turns to Adriana and remarks that the fighter 'floats like a butterfly'. Adriana turns to him in horror. He is confused by her look. Claudia arrives. Nash pitches his idea but she can't get that kind of money now. She is scared of getting ripped off again. Nash shows her the note her dad left him. She worries that he could be making this up. She decides to give him the money if he proves her father sent the note. Later, she smiles over getting Nash back from Tess! Cristian is fighting. He is doing a great job of holding his own. He takes a hit and the ref starts counting. Daryl sees that Rex might have known what he was doing when me placed his bet on the other guy. Cristian gets up though and starts fighting again. The crowd loves him. Soon he takes another hit and sends him to the mat again.",
