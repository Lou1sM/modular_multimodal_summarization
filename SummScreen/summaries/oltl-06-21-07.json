It doesn't matter what anyone says; Blair refuses to accept the relationship and will not accept the kids' request. Starr points out that she hates her life without Cole and reminds her mom of how she and Todd fought against everyone who tried to separate them. Besides, Todd isn't around to disapprove, Starr mentions. It doesn't matter; Blair refuses to budge.

David is practicing his tai chi in the other room. He didn't sign up for this, John tells his temporary roommate, who's made himself quite at home and is using John's things. David's response involves holding Marty's confession over John's head but John threatens him right back by promising to go to his \"sugar daddy,\" Asa, he guesses, surprising David. They discuss Marty's confession. \"Hot for her, aren't you?\" David asks John, who refuses to discuss the subject further. It's always the shrinks who need shrinks themselves, John hears David say as he heads out. He orders him gone by the time he gets back. \n\n\nRex is shocked when a toweled Adriana, closely followed by a barely dressed Tate, answers his knock at the door. \"You slept with this son of a racist,\" Rex accuses. She denies sleeping with Tate as Rex explains that he stopped by, thinking she'd be upset over Kirk's confession. She's not nervous to be with Tate? Layla and Vincent walk in and think the question needs to be answered. As everyone takes the opposing side, Adriana defends her friend, stating that he's not his father and racism isn't genetic.

Antonio points out that technically they're not brothers but Cris reminds him of past days. Cris reiterates that he was trying to protect Antonio and wonders how his brother would have handled it if the tables were turned. Antonio admits that he himself protected others in the same way himself at times and so the brothers are reunited. Cris points out how Antonio has always been his hero, not just now. Jess comes by with Bree on her way out to let Antonio know that she's leaving. She wanted him to see the baby to remind him that everything that he did, he did for her.

She wants to send a message to his racist pig friends. Bo only hopes they have the right man. There's nothing to connect him to the other crimes and they only have him with the bomb in the gallery. Many Llanview citizens arrive for the hearing, including Lindsay, who tells Bo that she plans on opening the Real Americans exhibit. He asks her to wait, to make sure they have the right person in custody. He seems to be the only one who is uneasy about the arrest. Tate and Adriana arrive and he's figuring that everyone there hates him. The charges are read and Kirk pleads No Contest. He has nothing to say and court is adjourned while the judge decides what happens next. Again, Bo wonders if it's over, as everyone happily thinks. He explains that the suspect is not saying he's guilty but just protecting himself against any suits. As people disperse, Kirk asks to speak to his son. He tells him he loves him and then leans over and whispers in his ear, \"I'll take this to the grave. No one will ever know that it was you.\" \n\n\n",
