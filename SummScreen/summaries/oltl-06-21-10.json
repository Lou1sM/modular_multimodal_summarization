Gigi informed Rex that she was on her way to work. Rex said that it was too bad she couldn't stay. Shane asked what the two were whispering about and what the big secret was. Rex and Gigi decided to tell Shane that they were dating again, and taking it slow. They asked if he was all right with it. \"Why wouldn't I be?\" an excited Shane asked.\n\n\nRex asked Shane if he wanted to keep playing catch. Shane said he had to get water first and walked away. Rex took the opportunity to ask Gigi out on a second date because their first one went so well. Shane returned, and Rex and Shane continued to throw the ball around. Rex threw the ball into the bushes. As Shane ran to get it, Rex asked Gigi to have a picnic with him at the quarry the next day. Shane returned, and Gigi said goodbye to him and Rex, and left for work.\n\n\nIn his hospital room, Ford told John that the night of his attack was \"coming back\" to him. Ford hesitated telling John the name of his attacker. John tried to convince Ford to tell him, and wondered why Ford didn't want to say who tried to kill him. Ford wanted to tell, but he was embarrassed because he had \"let her get the drop\" on him. John was surprised to find out that it was a female who tried to kill Ford.\n\n\nFord explained that he never thought \"she\" would do something like that and he should have known better. The girl was seriously messed up and \"went postal\" when Ford didn't turn out to be her knight in shining armor. John needed her name.\n\n\nAt the diner, Kelly told Jessica to eat her food, but Jessica was worried that Tess or Bess had returned and attacked Ford. Kelly tried to convince her that she was integrated and that she couldn't have done it. Jessica confided that her doctor wasn't even one hundred percent sure as Kelly's phone started to ring. Kelly thought Todd could survive without her, but Jessica told her to go. Kelly hugged her friend and left.\n\n\nBrody entered the diner and saw Jessica sitting alone. He asked if she was still having lunch with Kelly. Jessica explained that Kelly had hired her back as a reporter, and given her the day off, but Kelly was back at the office. Brody admitted that he wasn't Todd's biggest fan, but he was happy for Jessica, even though she didn't look happy. She thought back to her conversation with Kelly when Jessica confessed that she might have been the one to hurt Ford. Brody asked what was wrong.\n\n\nAfter a little prodding from Brody, Jessica began to explain how she was scared and confused on the night of the prom after Brody had told her about Mitch. However, Brody's phone rang. Jessica told him to answer it because it was probably John. It was John, who had an assignment for Brody. John explained that Brody had named his attacker, and Brody needed to pick her up. John said he would meet Brody at the station later and hung up.\n\n\nJessica wanted to know what John had said on the phone. Brody said that Ford had named his attacker. When Jessica asked who had tried to kill Ford, Brody made her promise that the information was off the record. He confided that Ford had named Hannah as his attacker. As Brody left to go pick Hannah up, Jessica breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, John explained to Ford that he was having Hannah taken in to the station. John asked Ford to take him through what had happened the night he was attacked, but Ford yelled that he had already told John what happened. John appreciated Ford's cooperation. As John left, Ford wondered what was going to happen to Hannah. He looked at the note as his phone rang. Into the phone, he said that he followed the instructions and accused Hannah of trying to kill him, and that she was probably being arrested as they spoke.\n\n\nOutside of Kelly's office, Shaun was talking on the phone to a girlfriend until he heard someone shuffling things around inside Kelly's office. Shaun burst into the room and held his gun to the intruder -- Reed. Kelly entered, wondering what was going on. Shaun informed Kelly that Reed had been going through her desk, but Reed asserted that there was a reasonable explanation. He claimed that he was just looking for a pen so he could leave Kelly a note. Shaun wondered why Reed didn't just send Kelly a text message.\n\n\nKelly didn't think Reed was a threat to her, but Shaun said that it wasn't her job to decide that. Kelly pushed Shaun out of her office, and Reed claimed that he \"could've taken\" Shaun. Kelly explained that Shaun was being paid to protect her and that Reed hadn't gone out of his way to reassure Shaun. Kelly still thought it was strange that Reed had been alone in her office. Reed was upset to think that Kelly didn't trust him either.\n\n\nKelly wasn't suspicious of him, though, and assured him that Shaun didn't choose the people that she spent her time with. Reed asked her out on another date, but Kelly disclosed that she was in the middle of a huge story. After proposing a couple different days and getting shot down, Kelly suggested that he call her. Reed wanted to know if he was wasting his time. Kelly assured him that he wasn't, but Reed accused her of hiding her feelings.\n\n\nReed explained that he had business in London. His business with Clint in Llanview had been concluded within a few days, and he was only staying to spend time with Kelly. Reed kept telling her how she never showed any feelings and, in order to get some kind of emotional reaction out of her, broke her mother's vase. Kelly slapped him across the face.\n\n\nAs Kelly began to clean up the pieces, Shaun entered and asked if everything was all right. Reed apologized and said he'd replace it because it was \"just a vase.\" Together, Shaun and Kelly explained that it was Kelly's mother's, and that it was the last thing her mother ever gave to her. Kelly said that it was too much too soon, and she couldn't see Reed anymore. Kelly said that if she were ever in London, it would be to see her son. Shaun pushed Reed out of the room as Kelly started to cry.\n\n\nWanting to help clean up, Shaun kneeled beside Kelly on the floor. Shaun regretted not kicking Reed out as soon as he saw the man. Kelly told Shaun she would be fine, and Shaun said he would be right outside. As Kelly picked up a big piece of the vase, she looked inside it and saw a folded piece of paper.\n\n\nAs Cole was about to walk out the kitchen door of La Boulaie, the phone rang. Cole answered and was surprised to hear that it was Starr, who was equally surprised to hear that it was Cole who had answered. Starr made sure that it wasn't Jack playing a trick on her, but Cole explained that he wasn't in jail anymore because a new judge had granted him bail. He asked Starr where she was, but she only exclaimed that she couldn't believe he was free.\n\n\nHe told her that he had looked for her at graduation and asked again where she was. Starr wondered why he was at Dorian's, to which he replied that he had been looking for her. He felt bad at the way they had left things. Cole missed her and begged her to meet him because he was allowed to go wherever he wanted as long as he stayed in town. Starr related that she wanted to see him, but couldn't, and that it was complicated. Cole blamed all of the couple's problems on him and begged her again to meet him, but Starr said it was safer if she didn't see him. \"Are you in trouble?\" Cole asked.\n\n\nStarr covered by saying that she couldn't pretend that everything was okay, and that she needed time to think. Cole apologized for pushing her away and just wanted to be with her. That's what Starr wanted, too, but she wanted to make sure that there was nothing else in the way. \"Is this about Hannah?\" Cole asked.\n\n\nStarr didn't want to talk about Hannah, but Cole told her that Hannah was at his hearing. Starr cried that she would have skipped her graduation if she had known about the hearing. Starr assured Cole that she would call him when she was ready \"in a day or two, I'm not sure.\" Cole reminded her that they loved each other and hung up.\n\n\nStarr got off the phone and promptly blamed James for making her lie to Cole. The two went back and forth blaming each other. Starr said she either had to lie to Cole or tell him the truth and make him a target for Bull as well. Starr stated that if she and Cole fell apart, it would be all James's fault. Then, Starr admitted that the couple had been on thin ice long before James showed up. Just because Cole was out of jail, their problems wouldn't disappear. Starr hoped that Cole would see through her lies, but knew that if he believed her, the couple wouldn't make it.\n\n\nStarr felt bad for lying, but knew she had to. James blamed Starr's involvement in his trouble on himself and promised to find her a way out. He said he would never forgive himself if something were to happen to Starr and Cole. Suddenly, Starr got an idea about how to get her back to Cole and Hope.\n\n\nHannah looked at the picture of Starr and James on her phone and called Cole. It went to his voicemail, which made Hannah so angry she threw her phone. She accidentally threw it into the stomach of Bull, who caught it. He held it out to her and told her to be more careful. Just before she took it back, he caught a glance of the picture on her phone and asked if she was friends with the people in the picture.\n\n\nBull informed Hannah that he was looking for Starr's boyfriend, the guy in the picture named James. He asked if Hannah could put her in touch with Starr, but Hannah said she only ran into Starr from time to time. She asked if Bull had a message for Starr, but Bull said he was only concerned because James was trouble and would hurt Starr. After throwing a paper into a nearby trashcan, Bull handed Hannah a piece of paper with his number on it, and told her to call him if she saw Starr and James. After Bull left, Hannah looked at the paper he threw away and smiled. It was Starr's high school diploma.\n\n\nOn the phone, Bull explained that he was only a little behind James and that he had a lead. He had done some research on Starr and had a list of places that she frequented. If he found her, he would surely find James.\n\n\nLangston entered the kitchen and was surprised to hear that Starr had called. Cole said that she was hiding from him and didn't want to see him. Cole explained that she needed time to think and that \"she couldn't get off the phone any faster.\" Cole wondered if it was payback, but Langston reminded Cole that Starr wasn't petty. Langston told him to be patient because nothing could keep Starr away from him for long.\n\n\nCole was surprised to walk out the kitchen door at La Boulaie to find Hannah. She said they needed to finish their conversation because he had run out of court before they could. He said he had needed to see Starr. Hannah entered the house and suggested that Starr was with her new boyfriend.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr and James are stuck together. And Hannah just happens to run into Bull who can see that she ahs taken a picture of Starr and James together. At that point, she knows she has \"leverage\" for getting Cole to believe that Starr is cheating on him and lying to him although she is not. Jessica is worried that she could have tried to kill Ford until Brody informs her that Ford has named Hannah. Right then, Kelly concludes that she is not interested in Reed and he goes back to London. Todd and Tea are still keeping the secret from Dani that she is dying and Dani is with Nate wanting to help him keep the money he's taken from James' brief case so that his (Nate's) mom won't lose her house.",
