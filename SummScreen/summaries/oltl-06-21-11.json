Jessica pushed him away forcefully. \"I'm Jessica,\" she exclaimed. Ford believed that Tess was pretending, and he announced that he had the signed divorce papers, courtesy of Cutter. Ford wanted to marry Tess as soon as possible.\n\n\nJessica snapped that she wasn't about to trade one \"sleazeball\" for another, and Ford realized that it was indeed Jessica that he was talking to. Jessica promised him that Tess would not be returning. Ford didn't understand, and he asked to speak to Tess. Jessica assured him that Tess was capable of hearing Ford, but Tess was only a part of Jessica. Tess didn't know the real meaning of love, and that was why Tess wasn't there, Jessica continued.\n\n\nJessica planned on claiming her life back, and Ford wasn't a part of it, Jessica asserted. She demanded that Ford leave the premises, but he refused. He wanted his son. Jessica began to argue with him. Tess had only had sex with Ford, and he'd given up his rights to Ryder when he had \"played house\" with Tess. Ford insisted that he had a connection with Tess, and Jessica couldn't shut him out.\n\n\nJessica accused Ford of trying to keep her out, but she'd regrouped. Ford had exploited her in the past. Ford replied that Jessica was the one who'd let Tess out when she couldn't cope, and she couldn't just pretend that he didn't exist. Jessica intended to call the police to get Ford to leave, but Ford stopped her. He would leave, but it wasn't over, he promised her. He would be back for Tess and Ryder.\n\n\nAt Llanview University, Starr grabbed her MP3 player out of the stranger's hands and asked what he was doing with her property. The young man explained that he'd updated her music, and he was positive that she would enjoy his music better than her own. Starr was livid, and she yelled at the man for vandalizing her things. She announced that she was going to call security. The young man tried to calm her down, and he informed her that he'd transferred her music to his own laptop. He would happily restore it to her MP3 under one condition, he stated.\n\n\n\"I'm not going out with you, buddy,\" Starr replied angrily. The young man assured her that he had no intentions of dating her. He merely wanted her to give his music a try. He was certain that she would find out that it was much better than the music she had listened to previously. He suggested that Starr expand her horizons. Starr thought he was \"pretentious and snobby.\"\n\n\nReluctantly, Starr put the headphones on and listened to a selection. \"Done,\" she noted matter-of-factly when the song was over. She admitted it was a \"catchy\" tune and she'd heard worse. \"I made the music,\" the young man declared, much to Starr's surprise. Starr was impressed, and she advised him that while her opinion of the music was the same, her opinion of him had gone up.\n\n\nThe couple began to talk about music, and the man explained that he was a deejay. He was new to town, though, and he had been looking for local fans. He suggested that Starr be one of his \"groupies.\" \"A groupie?\" Starr gasped. The man corrected himself. He had meant a fan, he said. He was hoping that others might follow her lead.\n\n\nStarr insisted that she had no time for that, but she could tell him about the local clubs in town. Her mom owned Capricorn, Starr admitted, but that club wouldn't fit his \"target audience.\" She thought that maybe Ultraviolet would be a good fit, and she knew the owner, Rex Balsom.\n\n\nThe young man restored Starr's music, but he was surprised when Starr asked him to add a couple of his tracks. He admitted that he already had, and he'd copied her playlist for himself also. She teased that it would be their secret. The man informed Starr that his name was Baz, and he was certain that she'd hear it in the future.\n\n\nBlair found herself in a hotel room in New York with a woman who claimed to be Tomas' wife. Blair refused to believe the woman, who called Blair a \"skinny little sex toy.\" Suddenly, the woman recognized Blair from Tomas' painting, and Blair recounted how Tomas had found the original wedding photo at a flea market. \"Is this the story he told you?\" the woman asked. The woman announced that she had always hated the painting. Blair declared that she didn't believe that the woman was married to Tomas.\n\n\n\"Ask him yourself,\" the woman urged. Blair turned around. Tomas had just returned to the room. Blair explained that she had wanted to surprise Tomas, but it appeared that she had been the one to be surprised. He had really gone to New York to see his wife, Blair added. Tomas wanted to explain, but Blair slapped him. \"You lying bastard,\" she snapped, as she turned to leave.\n\n\nTomas grabbed Blair's arm. He informed her that while he was married, he and his wife had been separated for years. \"He can't let go,\" the woman stated, but Tomas accused his wife of dragging her feet. Yvette was the one who wouldn't sign the papers, he said. He wondered if it hurt his chances with Blair.\n\n\nBlair announced that it was too soon to make any kind of decision, and Yvette reminded her that Tomas had lied more than once. Yvette wondered if all Americans had low self-esteem to put up with that kind of behavior. Tomas insisted that he had shown up in New York to pick up the signed divorce papers, but Yvette had threatened to go back on her promise to sign.\n\n\nTomas turned to his wife and loudly proclaimed that their marriage was over, because she had destroyed it when she'd cheated on him. She'd had another man's baby, Tomas announced. Blair was clearly disturbed. \"Just sign the damn papers,\" Tomas demanded of his wife. Yvette mentioned that Tomas' son was with her in the hotel. Tomas clarified that it was Yvette's son, not his, but Yvette retorted that the boy had always been Tomas' son, and she had lied about the paternity. \n\n\nYvette insisted that Tomas ask the boy, who was in the other room. Tomas strode to the bedroom and looked around. He informed the women that the boy, Sebastian, was gone. Blair's head was spinning.\n\n\nA fellow police officer advised John that the forensics report from the site of Gigi's tragic carbon monoxide poisoning was still in the process of being put together.\n\n\nInside the interrogation room, T\u00e9a urged Jack to talk about what had happened to Gigi, and she promised that whatever he said would be confidential. She was afraid that Jack could be charged with murder, and they needed to plan a strategy. Before Jack could say anything, John walked into the room. He wanted to talk to Jack.\n\n\nJack insisted that what had happened to Gigi wasn't his fault. T\u00e9a demanded that Todd be released, but John noted that Todd's paperwork appeared to be missing. John returned to the subject of Jack's problems with Shane. T\u00e9a pointed out that while Shane had gotten into trouble in school, the same couldn't be said for Jack. John blamed Jack for what had happened to Gigi, emphasizing that Gigi had been lured to a trap meant for Shane.\n\n\nTodd accused John of trying to get to him through Jack, who hadn't done anything. John alluded to the evidence that he was collecting that included fingerprints and hair from the scene, as well as online data. John wanted to hear Jack's side of the story. T\u00e9a stepped in and brusquely announced, in no uncertain terms, that Jack wouldn't discuss anything without any evidence from John. Just then a cop walked in with Todd's release papers.\n\n\nJohn smirked. He had no idea where the keys to the handcuffs might be, and he walked out with the excuse that he had to look for them. \"You totally kicked John's ass,\" Todd proclaimed to T\u00e9a. Jack was worried about the report that John had anticipated receiving, and he hoped that Gigi would get better. T\u00e9a didn't think that was likely, but hoped that perhaps Gigi would receive a miracle.\n\n\n\"Hey I found the keys,\" John said cheerfully when he returned. He planned on seeing Jack soon, once he'd obtained the report, John added. On the way out, Todd asked T\u00e9a to take care of things for Jack.\n\n\nNatalie and Viki spent some time in Gigi's hospital room, but they wondered where Rex had gone. Natalie wanted to help her brother, but she wanted to help her father as well. She was torn and didn't know what to do. Viki suggested that she give Rex time alone, but she thought that Natalie should try to find him.\n\n\nLeft alone with Gigi, Viki spoke quietly to her friend and recalled how they had met. Viki noted how Gigi had lit up everywhere she'd been with her strength and love for everyone. Viki had been lost, and Gigi had helped Viki to find herself in Paris, Texas. Viki would never be able to repay Gigi, but she wanted Gigi to take Viki's love and strength in return.\n\n\nViki admitted that she had a secret. She had all of the rent money that Gigi had insisted on paying for the carriage house. Viki hadn't wanted to take away Gigi's pride, but Viki had never wanted the money. Viki had set it aside in a special account for Shane's college education, and she promised that she would see to it that Shane had his education. Viki didn't want Gigi to worry any longer, because Viki would take care of Gigi's family.\n\n\nRex was in Clint's room. Rex advised Clint that the older man would never receive Gigi's heart. Clint had news for Rex though. He advised Rex that Rex would not be able to challenge the results of Gigi's heart donation, because Rex had never been married to Gigi. Shane had no rights either, because Shane was a minor.\n\n\nA furious Rex sputtered that he and Gigi had been engaged and living together, and they had been about to marry when Gigi's catastrophe had occurred. Rex vowed to fight. Clint was confident that he would win, and Rex would lose. Clint recommended that Rex spend his time with Gigi and hold her hand, and not waste time in the courtroom. He thought that Rex should express his love to Gigi and say goodbye to her.\n\n\n\"You first,\" Rex replied as he picked up a pillow and headed to Clint's bedside. He wanted to be certain to put Clint out of his misery. \"You don't want to do this,\" Clint proclaimed. Rex retorted that he wanted to protect Gigi, and it had been a cruel and sick joke of the fates the way that things had turned out. Clint continued to try to talk Rex out of murdering him, but Rex's action was cut short when Natalie walked into the room and took the pillow away from Rex.\n\n\nRex shouted that Clint wanted to kill Gigi in order that he might live, but Clint disputed Rex's version. Clint indicated that he had only given Rex the facts, and Gigi had signed an organ donor card. He had also advised Rex that only Gigi's husband would have been able to challenge it. Natalie wasn't sure of what to say as she looked between her brother and her father. Rex only wanted her understanding. Clint would have to get out of bed and rip Rex with his bare hands in order to obtain Gigi's heart, Rex cried out.\n\n\nClint wanted to call the police after Rex left the room, but Natalie stopped him. She was sure that Rex wouldn't really have killed Clint, and she wouldn't stand by and allow Clint to manipulate Rex. It was obvious that Clint wanted to put Rex in jail so that Clint could get Gigi's heart. \"I can't afford any delays,\" Clint stated. Natalie informed him, \"This is gonna happen the way it's gonna happen.\" She wouldn't allow Clint to take Rex away from Gigi.\n\n\nFurthermore, Natalie thought that Clint shouldn't antagonize Rex, and she deemed Clint to be cruel. Clint noted that Rex wouldn't give up the heart, and Clint had needed to find out about his legal rights.\n\n\nRex returned to Gigi's room, and he hugged a teary Viki who explained that she and Natalie had been worried about Rex. He walked over to Gigi and exclaimed that Gigi didn't look like herself. She looked smaller. They had been so close to getting everything they'd always wanted, Rex declared. He had been about to finally have the kind of family that he'd never had in the past. \"How did this happen?\" he asked sadly.\n\n\nViki promised Rex that she would be there for him. \"Clint is trying to take Gigi's heart by force,\" Rex declared. He wouldn't let it happen. Clint had advised Rex that Rex had no say if he wasn't married to Gigi. Clint had been gloating, but Rex planned to fight. The fact that Clint had always treated Rex so poorly saddened Viki. She wanted Rex to count on her if he needed a shoulder to lean on or someone to talk to.\n\n\nAlone with Gigi, Rex promised that he wouldn't let Clint take her heart. He would protect her. Just then, T\u00e9a walked into the room, claiming that she'd wanted to check on Gigi. Rex advised her that he didn't believe her for a minute, but T\u00e9a offered her help if he needed it at some point. She left the room.\n\n\nRex ran after T\u00e9a. He'd had second thoughts. He wanted to marry Gigi, and he wanted T\u00e9a's help.\n\n\nViki went back to Clint's room. She told both Clint and Natalie that Rex might never recover from the traumatic event. She berated Clint for not helping the situation. Clint insisted that he didn't want anyone to die, and he felt terrible. The fact was that Gigi was braindead, and he'd be able to live with Gigi's help. Rex would have to accept it, Clint declared. There was no choice.\n\n\n",
