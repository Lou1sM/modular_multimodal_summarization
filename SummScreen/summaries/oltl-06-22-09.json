Starr pleaded with her father to maintain control, but surprisingly Todd remained calm.  Cole stated that he had received a two-year jail sentence and was adamant that he wanted to marry Starr before he was scheduled to report to jail.  Insisting that he wanted Hope to have his name, Cole said that he wanted his daughter to know that he was committed to both her and her mother.  Relating that his jail term was scheduled to begin in two days, Cole insisted on marrying Starr the very next day.  Todd shook his head in disbelief.\n\n\nTodd told Starr and Cole that they needed parental consent to get married in the state of Pennsylvania.  Certain that Todd would never support their marriage, Cole said that they would seek Blair's permission to marry.  Todd startled the teens when he announced that he would give his consent.  Commending Cole for wanting to do the right thing, Todd said that he wouldn't do anything to stand in Cole and Starr's way.  When Starr questioned what her father had up his sleeve, Todd reminded her of the events that had transpired the last time he interfered in her relationship with Cole.  Declaring that he was tired of being the bad guy, Todd told the teens that they would discuss the wedding plans the following day, and he left them alone.\n\n\nAlthough uncertain of Todd's motives, Cole proposed and Starr accepted.  Starr told Cole that she loved him and couldn't wait to marry him.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler told Gigi that he believed that Roxy was withholding information regarding Stacy's scheme.  Gigi had a difficult time believing that Roxy would keep silent, but Gigi remembered a past conversation in which Roxy mentioned that Stacy wasn't a match for Shane.  Although Roxy had given an excuse for her comments, Gigi realized that Roxy knew more than she cared to admit.  Observing a drunken Roxy sitting at a nearby table, Gigi wondered why Roxy would go along with Stacy's scam.  Schuyler was certain that Stacy had blackmailed Roxy into keeping her secret.\n\n\nGigi approached Roxy and stated that she wanted to discuss Rex and Stacy.  Gigi reminded Roxy of her past admission that Stacy wasn't a match for Shane.  Gigi asked Roxy if Stacy had blackmailed her into keeping silent.  Stating that Roxy was Gigi's only hope of reuniting with Rex again, Gigi pleaded with Roxy to join forces with her in exposing Stacy's misdeeds.  Gigi's heart sank when Roxy denied having any information regarding Stacy.\n\n\nAfterward, Gigi told Schuyler that Roxy refused to divulge any information, but Gigi was certain that Roxy truly wanted to reveal everything, but was afraid.  Schuyler was convinced that Stacy was holding something big over Roxy's head.  Gigi was desperate to learn the identity of Shane's donor.  Schuyler promised to continue to help Gigi.  Thanking Schuyler for his support, Gigi insisted that he had given her hope.  Noting that her replacement had showed up for the night shift, Schuyler suggested that they attend Shane's concert together.\n\n\nInside an empty room at the country club, Rex and Stacy shared a passionate kiss.  Rex had second thoughts about his actions and tried to pull away, but Stacy grabbed him and drew him into an embrace.  Unable to resist Stacy's charms, Rex tossed her on the couch and removed her bikini top.  As Rex and Stacy prepared to have sex, the general manager interrupted their rendezvous.  Referring to them as frauds, the manager instructed security to place both Rex and Stacy under arrest.\n\n\nBo was shocked when a half-dressed Rex and Stacy were hauled into the police station.  Advising Bo of the crime that they had committed, the manger announced that he wanted to press charges against Rex and Stacy.  After ordering his officers to take Stacy to the locker room to get dressed, Bo promised that Rex would pay the bill in full, and asked the manager to refrain from filing formal charges.   The manager had no sympathy for Rex, but promised to think about dropping the charges.\n\n\nBo tossed Rex into his office and demanded to know what was going on.  Bo advised Rex that he would face grand larceny charges if the manager decided to press charges.  A disappointed Bo wondered if Rex had sex with Stacy at the country club.  Rex admitted that the manager interrupted before anything had actually happened.  Informing Rex that he was behaving irresponsibly, Bo reminded Rex that he was a father and encouraged him to think about Shane.  When Bo questioned if Rex wanted a relationship with Stacy, Rex acknowledged that he didn't, and admitted that a part of him would always love Gigi.  Bo warned Rex not to get involved with Stacy, the sister of the woman he loved.\n\n\nAs Rex left Bo's office, he ran into Stacy.  Excited that Bo had asked the manager to drop the charges against them, Stacy wanted to celebrate with Rex.  To Stacy's surprise, Rex avoided eye contact with Stacy and advised her to head home without him.  A rejected Stacy watched as Rex rushed off.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a accused Blair of wanting to remain in Todd's life.   T\u00e9a demanded to know if Blair was prepared to go after Todd or if she had chosen to remain with John.  A look of sadness crossed Blair's face as she remarked, \"Thanks to Marty, John and I are done!\"  Blair insisted that she had no desire to renew a relationship with Todd and was convinced that T\u00e9a had strong feelings for him.  Ignoring Blair's accusations, T\u00e9a asked if Blair wanted to compete with her for Todd's affection or if Blair wanted John.  Blair was adamant that she didn't desire either, Todd or John.\n\n\nBlair admitted that she and John would be together had Marty not interfered.  Taunting T\u00e9a about wanting Todd, Blair asked T\u00e9a to reveal the secret that she was withholding that concerned Todd.    Blair was convinced that the secret had something to do with the reason why T\u00e9a couldn't seem to let go of Todd.  Before T\u00e9a could respond, Todd returned and interrupted the discussion.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wanted to discuss the living arrangements.  Arguing that she couldn't live under the same roof as T\u00e9a, Blair demanded that Todd move into La Boulaie. T\u00e9a was stunned when Todd readily agreed to accommodate Blair.  Relating that it would be best for the family to reside at La Boulaie, Todd advised T\u00e9a that he would provide her with a full-time nurse to care for her.   Although T\u00e9a declined his offer, Todd insisted that he wanted to help her.  Before walking away, Todd stunned Blair and T\u00e9a when he announced that Cole was going to prison on drug possession charges and that Todd had given his permission for Cole to marry Starr.\n\n\nMarty paid Viki a visit at Llanfair.  Marty told Viki that Marcie had returned Hope to Starr and that Cole was going to prison.  Viki felt terrible about Cole's misfortune.  Marty wondered if Starr would reject Cole once she learned about his prison sentence.  Viki was certain that Starr wanted Cole to be in Hope's life.  Marty feared that Cole would return from prison a damaged young man.  Viki promised to do all she could to help Marty and Cole through their difficult time.  Viki assured Marty that things would work out fine.\n\n\n",
