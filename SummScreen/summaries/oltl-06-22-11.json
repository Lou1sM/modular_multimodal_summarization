David denied having any knowledge of the bra, and Dorian accused him of having an affair with an actress on their movie set. \"This is our moment,\" David said enthusiastically. He reminded her of all that was perfect in their lives, including Clint's impending death. He ordered Dorian not to be so paranoid. He wanted to have a toast.\n\n\nIn the kitchen, with her MP3 player blasting in her ears, Starr went about preparing herself some food as she danced. She didn't hear James arrive and call her name, so he scared her when he drew close. She told him about the young man at school who had switched the music on her device. \"And who is this jerk?\" James inquired. Starr assured him that the man had reloaded her music, but she had to agree, the new music was great. She urged James to listen to it.\n\n\nJames grabbed Starr's headphones and listened to the music for a brief second. \"I don't like it,\" he declared. Starr recommended that James not be jealous, though James insisted that he wasn't. He just didn't like what the man had done. He repeated that he wasn't jealous, and Starr teased him. James stated that he had no reason to be jealous, because he already had Starr. He kissed her and added that he intended to keep an eye out for the man at school.\n\n\nDavid walked into the kitchen in search of champagne and caviar, because Dorian needed some pampering, he announced. He thought that Dorian was seeing things that weren't really there. He picked up Starr's music player, but Starr shouted at him to give it back. She didn't want David to touch it. After David left, James wondered why Starr had been so upset.\n\n\nStarr claimed that David would never have returned it, and it had nothing to do with Baz. James was curious about the name, but Starr realized that she had to get ready for Nate's graduation, and James left. Starr made sure to tune in to her music again as she headed out of the kitchen.\n\n\nWhile David was in the kitchen, Dorian answered the front door when the bell rang. It was a deliveryman, and he had a large brown envelope. David returned to Dorian. \"Stick it,\" Dorian told him. She handed him a photo of the actress in question, who was seated half dressed, on David's lap. David was confused. Dorian handed him a stack of photos. David admitted they were real.\n\n\nDavid pleaded his case and told Dorian that the actress had been crazy. She'd thrown herself at him, and she'd removed her clothes every chance she'd had. She'd visited him in his dressing room, and he'd felt violated. Dorian wondered why he'd kept it a secret. David insisted that he hadn't told her because she would have \"flipped out,\" which was exactly what she was doing. He'd planned on telling her after their film had been completed.\n\n\nDorian reminded David that the film was finished, but David claimed that he had picked up the champagne and caviar to \"soften the blow.\" He insisted that he hadn't had sex with the actress. Dorian was curious as to who had actually taken the photographs and why they had taken them. David didn't have an answer.\n\n\nTomas and Blair returned to their hotel room after searching the clubs for Tomas' son, without success. Tomas explained that he didn't know Sebastian, because Tomas and Yvette had broken up around the time that the boy had been born. Tomas was aware that Sebastian was spoiled and arrogant without any manners. \"You forgot stupid and ugly,\" a voice said from behind Tomas.\n\n\nTurning around, Blair and Tomas looked at Sebastian, who had just walked inside. Tomas revealed that he'd been searching for the young man since he'd learned that Sebastian was his son. Sebastian revealed that he'd only just learned the truth himself, which meant that his mother had lied to him his entire life. He added that Yvette had always been crazy. Tomas went off to phone Yvette, and Blair introduced herself. \"My dad has good taste,\" Sebastian noted.\n\n\nSebastian revealed that he'd been told that his mother was pawning him off on Tomas, so he'd traveled to Llanview to see the town. He had nothing but awful things to say about the place and its people, and Blair took exception. She thought that Sebastian would have to be put in his place for being so rude. Tomas returned and ordered his son to apologize. While Sebastian thought that it was too late for Tomas to play daddy, he expressed his regrets for badmouthing Blair's home.\n\n\nSebastian couldn't help but add that the people in Llanview had \"a music deficit\" and they were clueless. He revealed that he'd met a cute girl with bad taste. Yvette arrived and yelled at her son for going off without notifying her. Sebastian advised her that he'd checked out Llanview and borrowed his mother's credit card. \"He can leech off you now,\" Yvette advised Tomas.\n\n\nTomas announced that he would take care of his son if Yvette would sign the divorce papers. Sebastian reminded everyone that he wasn't a minor, and he didn't have to live with anyone. Blair congratulated Tomas for being out of a marriage that she hadn't even known about, and Yvette advised Tomas that he was free. They said goodbye, and Yvette hugged her son. \"Get to know your father. If you can,\" she said.\n\n\nBlair followed Yvette out into the hallway. She'd noticed that Yvette had said a couple of cryptic things since they'd met, and she wondered what Yvette had meant. Yvette stated that she had her reasons for keeping father and son apart, and she warned Blair to be careful. Blair returned to the room. Sebastian revealed that he was a deejay and music producer, as well as an adult. He thought he might go to Buenos Aires to visit the music scene.\n\n\nTomas suggested that his son return to Llanview and get acquainted with T\u00e9a and Dani, his aunt and cousin. Blair added that her own children were Dani's siblings, and he could meet them as well. Sebastian declined, but Tomas insisted that they get to know each other after the shock of learning that they were father and son. Blair announced that she owned a club, and she had all kinds of music equipment that Sebastian could use for free. Tomas offered room and board, and Sebastian changed his mind. He would go to Llanview.\n\n\nAt the Manning house, Todd grabbed the phone from Jack's hand as the teen spoke to his friend Brad. Todd reminded his son that there was to be no calling or texting, as Todd wouldn't put it past John to tap their phones. Todd was aware that John would use any evidence against Jack that the police could find, and Todd hoped that Jack hadn't left something behind in the basement of the vacant house. Sarcastically, Jack reminded Todd that he hadn't robbed a bank, and he hadn't made any attempt to hide anything. Todd was grateful that T\u00e9a was on their side, and he wasn't pleased with Jack's stab at a joke.\n\n\nTodd was hopeful that Jack wouldn't be tried as an adult, or would get a light sentence because it was his first offense. Jack thought that his father should be able to make everything disappear, because Todd was rich, and he thought that Todd should offer \"McPain\" a million dollars. He accused Todd of not protecting him. Todd insisted that he was, but they were looking at more than a \"schoolyard dispute.\" Todd was angry. He had warned Jack to stay away from Shane.\n\n\nJack complained that he'd had no choice, because Shane had dropped a weight on his foot. \"Poor you,\" Todd retorted. He thought that the weight should have been on Jack's head instead. \"Why couldn't you let it go?\" Todd asked. \"Like you let Marty Saybrooke go?\" Jack pondered. Todd grabbed his son roughly. \"Don't you go there with me, kid,\" Todd ordered.\n\n\nTodd didn't think his son should be attempting to take the moral high ground, and he was angry. \"Gigi's braindead because of you,\" Todd reminded his son. \"At least I didn't rape someone,\" Jack snapped. \"You don't talk to me like that,\" screamed Todd. He was livid, and he began to grab at his son roughly.\n\n\nRex sat by Gigi's side in the hospital and assured her that he was the one who knew her heart the best. He was fully aware that Gigi wouldn't want her heart inside of Clint, and Rex promised that he had a plan. T\u00e9a walked in and disclosed that she'd had no luck in trying to find someone who would marry Gigi and Rex. Rex replied that unscrupulous marriages were T\u00e9a's specialty, but she explained that with Gigi not fully alive, Gigi was unable to give consent.\n\n\nRex noted that Gigi had recently signed their marriage license, but T\u00e9a admitted that it wasn't official. Rex was upset and blamed T\u00e9a's \"piece of garbage stepson.\" \"You know I'm gonna go after that little bastard with everything I've got,\" Rex promised. He was convinced that Jack was the real reason that T\u00e9a couldn't help. T\u00e9a disagreed. She really wanted to help Rex out, but she couldn't. \"Your stepson's going down for this,\" Rex replied. T\u00e9a advised him that there hadn't been any charges against Jack, but Rex was confident that there would be soon enough.\n\n\nEcho arrived after T\u00e9a left, and she embraced her son. Echo had just heard about Gigi, and she was sorry. Echo explained that she'd been away on a job. She was also sorry about lying to Rex about his true father, and she'd lost Charlie. She'd had no choice but to lie, because Clint had threatened to toss Rex in jail. She had thought that Charlie would have been a better choice of a father anyway, and Rex agreed. He told her about Clint's heart transplant, and the fact that Rex couldn't make the decision, because he wasn't married to Gigi.\n\n\nRex added that T\u00e9a had let him down, but he would continue to refuse to allow Clint to have Gigi's heart. It would amount to Gigi being killed for a second time, Rex believed. Echo thought that Rex should be the one able to make the decision, though Rex thought it should be up to Gigi. Echo handed Rex a large envelope, something that Roxy had handed her when Echo had stopped at the carriage house. It was addressed to Gigi.\n\n\nEcho wished she could help. Rex indicated that he planned to keep Clint from Gigi's heart, and he'd already thought about killing Clint. Echo left. She stopped to chat to a man who informed her that he'd dropped off the photos as Echo had requested. Echo vowed to ruin Dorian's relationship just the way that Dorian had ruined Echo's.\n\n\n\"You've got mail,\" Rex muttered as he opened the envelope. He was surprised to see several documents and a letter from a lawyer. Gigi had wanted to put her personal affairs in order prior to her marriage. The envelope included an updated will, a living will, and a health care proxy. The letter indicated that Gigi and Rex would be able to make decisions for each other if need be.\n\n\nRex was impressed, but he assumed that Gigi had always been so organized out of necessity as a single mother. He couldn't recall whether Gigi had mentioned the documents to him, but he thought that he might be able to sign her name in the space where it was required.\n\n\nAt the police station, Brody apologized for being late. He explained that he'd had a tough night without much sleep, because he'd moved back to Angel Square, where there had been lots of noise. At the look on John's face, Brody added that the situation was complicated even though Jessica had returned, and things hadn't gotten off to a good start. The forensics report from the vacant house was delivered, and the men looked at it. John noted that it was exactly what he had expected.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica saw Natalie and wondered why Natalie wasn't at a motel with her boyfriend. \"Brody is not my boyfriend,\" Natalie insisted. Jessica wondered if the couple just hung around naked, and she indicated that she was through with all of it. Natalie admitted that she could understand Jessica's shock, but Brody and Natalie had grown close while Jessica had been gone. Natalie believed that Jessica and Brody could get back together, but Jessica thought it might be crowded with the three of them in the same bed. Jessica wondered if she should pretend it all hadn't happened.\n\n\nNatalie again reminded Jessica that Jessica had been gone, and Brody had felt abandoned. Jessica accused Natalie of recognizing what she was doing when she slept with Brody the second time around, and she wondered how Natalie would feel if Jessica slept with John. Natalie admitted that she would feel awful. Jessica added that she'd never do it, but she wondered if she should change and not care about her conscience like her sister.\n\n\nNatalie ordered Jessica to shut up. Jessica had given up her life, and Natalie wouldn't feel sorry for her any longer. \"I'm done,\" Natalie snapped. She accused Jessica of taking off whenever things got tough for her, while Natalie had dealt with events on her own, like her child being taken. She stated that Brody had waited for Jessica for months, and he had tried to reach Jessica many times. Jessica had humiliated Brody while Tess had encounters with half of Llanview's male population.\n\n\nIn turn, Jessica accused Natalie of acting like a slut. \"Works for you doesn't it?\" Natalie asked. She and Brody had never meant for anything to happen, but they'd only wanted a normal life for themselves and their son, Natalie continued. Jessica had returned and had expected things to still be the same, but life had gone on without her, Natalie proclaimed. \"Deal with it,\" she concluded.\n\n\nJessica announced that she had a doctor's appointment and then planned to stop to visit with Clint. Natalie was going to the hospital, also, and she was glad that Tess wasn't going to return. At least Tess hadn't tried to kill her, Natalie said as she grimaced. \"Don't push me,\" Jessica said. Natalie wondered if that were a threat, but Jessica shook her head. Jessica would be the one to go after Natalie, not Tess. \"I wonder what John McBain is up to,\" Jessica wondered.\n\n\nT\u00e9a walked into the house just as Todd looked as though he were about to strike Jack. She yelled for Todd to stop. Todd inquired where T\u00e9a's had been, and she indicated that she'd had a business stop to make. \"What were you doing?\" she asked her husband. It looked as though he had been about to hit Jack, and she couldn't believe it.\n\n\n\"I'm losing it,\" Todd admitted. \"I don't think I can handle this,\" he added. He had realized that Jack was \"going down a dangerous path,\" and Todd was scared. He also thought it all looked familiar, and he'd felt as though he were channeling his father, Peter Manning. T\u00e9a urged her husband to not allow Jack to get to him, and Todd wasn't like either Peter Manning or Victor Lord. She wanted Todd to step back and take a breath. She thought he should remain calm, because Jack would need their help.\n\n\nThere was a knock at the door. \"Candygram,\" John called out. He was there with Brody, and they wanted to see Jack. They didn't have questions for Jack, though, John clarified. They were there to arrest the teenager, who walked down the stairs to see what was going on.  Jack's fingerprints had been all over the scene, John informed the Mannings. He was charging Jack with kidnapping and attempted murder.\n\n\nBrody read Jack his rights as he put the handcuffs around Jack's wrists. Jack walked out with the cops, and T\u00e9a assured the boy that she and Todd would be at the station.\n\n\n",
