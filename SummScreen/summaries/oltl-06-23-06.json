Finally, when the bubbles stopped coming up, she grabbed a towel, wrapped it around the assailant's neck and pulled him off Rex. The stalker fled and Adriana pulled Rex out of the pool. Rex caught his breath and said that he'd get Bo to help them track down the stalker, but Adriana was worried that if Dorian finds out about the stalker she'll never let her out of her sight. Rex agreed to hold off on telling the police, but said he'll spend the night to protect her, sleeping on the couch. Rex bent down and picked up a butterfly cut-out off the ground. \n\n\nCristian and Evangeline got hot and heavy and then Cristian suggested that they \"make love.\" When Evangeline hedged, Cristian told her she was brilliant and beautiful, then whispered something in her ear that made her giggle. \"I really want you, too,\" she said. \"But would it kill you, would it make you crazy if we just wait a little bit longer?\" Cristian agreed to wait and \"bask in the yearning\" for a little while if that's what Evangeline wanted.\n\n\nNatalie pulled John off of Vincent and they left together and went up to the roof. John was upset with himself for losing his temper. He again mentioned how he doesn't feel redemption even though now they have a suspect in his father's murder and will probably win a conviction. They decided to shut out their troubles, lie back on the roof and look up at the stars together. They dozed off and John had a dream about being in the execution chamber with David strapped to the chair, about to be put to death, telling him that he's got the wrong guy.\n\n\nVincent poured champagne for himself and Layla. She told him how she never liked John or Natalie ever since Natalie broke up John and Evangeline and broke her sister's heart. When Layla stepped away, Vincent talked to his thug associate about how he bet against Cristian in the last fight and how they need to make sure that he doesn't again get inspiration from Evangeline and win the next one.\n\n\nBo thanked Hugh for standing by him even with the mayor breathing down his neck. Bo then turned in his gun and his badge. \"You've got to treat me like any other suspect,\" Bo said. Hugh lamented not being able to pin things on Spencer. Bo called Evangeline and asked her to come to his office. He asked her to be his defense attorney. Evangeline said that she'd help, but can't be the lead attorney for him. She said it's because she's still struggling with her blindness. \"I can't risk your freedom to take on this case by myself,\" she said. Bo told her that he believes that she is the best attorney available. She said he was wrong.\n\n\nAs Spencer left with Blair he told David to meet in his room in 30 minutes. Then he took Blair up to his room and gave her a sleeping pill when she said she was suffering from insomnia of late. Blair pretended to take the pill and then faked falling asleep. Spencer leaned over her and called her name in her ear to see if she'd respond. When she didn't, he assumed she was out cold. A moment later David stopped by. Spencer told David he has to plead not guilty. He told David the evidence against him is flimsy, but David said he doesn't want to live with it over his head any more. Spencer told David to trust him and just plead not guilty. He reminded David how he's protected him for 25 years, but David said it was more like he's held the murder over his head for 25 years. Blair sat back listening to it all. David said fine, he'd plead not guilty and trust Spencer to make sure he gets off. Spencer went back into the bedroom where Blair had already laid back down pretending to sleep. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex is about to lose consciousness. Adriana is shouting for the masked man to leave Rex alone but he will not stop. Adriana then finds the courage to go over behind the man and pull him off Rex, relieving the pressure so that Rex can be freed. The man gets up and runs off. Adriana pulls Rex from the pool and holds him in her arms while he tries to get a breath. Spencer arranges for David to come to his room to talk. He gives Blair pills and tells her that she will get a good night's sleep. She spits the pills out and pretends to be sleeping later when David shows up for his little visit. Spencer tries to convince David not to plead guilty but David will do it. He wants to face what he has done and he will admit to the shooting. Spencer says that he has been covering for his brother for twenty years and that there isn't any reason for him to be giving himself up this way. David tells him not to worry as he will be confessing but not about anything that Spencer has done in the past. Spencer gives all the reasons why he feels that David should trust him and do as he says to be free. David can't help it. He doesn't trust Spencer. Spencer is sure that if David pleads guilty, they will both end up in jail for twenty- five years, but if David does as his brother tells, Spencer can see David going free for the crime of shooting John's father. David gives in. He will do as Spencer tells him and plead 'not guilty'. Spencer is pleased. He says that he did what he did because he cares for his brother and he still does. David isn't sure about that. He leaves the apartment now. Blair has been listening the whole time. She hears that the meeting is over and she runs to the bed and fakes sleeping. Spencer lets David out and joins Blair in bed.",
