    "soap_central": "\n\nThe man with Todd's original face got dressed in his room at the Minute Man Motel. He read the headline on the Sun: \"McPain Martyrs Manning. 'I'm innocent,' sez Todd.\" There was a knock on the door, and the man pulled out his gun. Someone called out that they had a delivery, so the man put his gun away, and opened the door.\n\n\nA boy in a hot dog costume handed the man a bag with food. The man gave the boy money, and told him to keep it all. \"You deserve it,\" he said, and laughed, closing the door. He rationalized that it wasn't his money anyway. The man took out a wallet and phone that belonged to the agent he'd killed the previous day. He apologized to the agent, but reasoned that he wouldn't have let the agent kill Sam. He related how it made no sense that Sam had said that his father was Todd Manning, when the man was supposed to be Todd Manning.\n\n\nThe man realized that there were probably other agents out there trying to kill him. He wanted to stay in Llanview. The agent's phone rang, and the man answered it. Pretending to be the agent, he told the person on the other end that the man was dead, so there was no need to send anyone else. He asked the person on the other end about Todd Manning. When the person wouldn't tell him anything, he hung up. He thought it was time that he and Todd met \"face-to-face.\"\n\n\nAt the police station, T\u00e9a told John that Jack didn't need to handcuffed, since he wasn't dangerous. \"Tell that to Gigi Morasco,\" John shot back. Jack claimed that he didn't do anything to Gigi, but John replied that Jack's fingerprints had been found all over the basement. T\u00e9a explained that the house belonged to a family friend, so she would have been surprised if Jack's prints hadn't been found there.\n\n\nJohn thought that Jack hadn't meant to hurt anyone, so he urged Jack to tell the truth. T\u00e9a advised Jack not to say a word. However, John thought that Jack's refusal to cooperate meant that Jack had something to hide, which made Jack look bad. \"What if I want to tell?\" Jack asked T\u00e9a. Before he could say anything more, an officer entered with a file for John. John left the room to talk to the officer.\n\n\nA short while later, John returned with the file. He wondered if Jack had anything to say. Jack didn't, which pleased Todd. John explained about the computer found in Jack's backpack. Comicgurl15's correspondence with Shane had been found on the computer, and John knew that the alias belonged to Jack. Jack informed John that the computer wasn't his. Blair had taken his computer away, so the computer that had been found in his backpack had been a borrowed one.\n\n\nOutside the room, John asked the officer if he'd checked on who owned the computer. The officer admitted that he'd assumed it was Jack's, since it had been found in Jack's backpack. John warned the officer to make sure the next time, and went back into the room. T\u00e9a said that John couldn't prove that anything on the computer was Jack's, so John needed to let Jack go. John refused, but T\u00e9a reminded John that he had nothing on Jack. John revealed that he had a witness.\n\n\nRex knew that Gigi's heart would stay in her body if he signed Gigi's will for her. Echo entered and wondered what Rex was doing. She wanted to help, so she grabbed the papers out of Rex's hand. Realizing what he wanted to do, she refused to let him forge Gigi's signature. Rex said that Clint wouldn't get Gigi's heart, \"end of story.\" Rex told Echo to leave if she wasn't on his side. She assured him that she was always on his side. She told him to let her take care of things, and asked if there was anything around with Gigi's signature on it.\n\n\nBo told Matthew how much he missed his son. \"I missed you too!\" David replied from the doorway. He gave Bo a bone-crushing hug, and wondered if Matthew had asked for him. Bo revealed that Matthew hadn't yet spoken, but he'd been improving greatly. David knew Matthew would be better in time to walk with him on the red carpet for his movie premiere. David wondered who had hurt Matthew, and threatened violence on the person.\n\n\nBo admitted that they didn't know how Matthew had gotten hurt, and wouldn't know until Matthew could tell them. David wanted to talk to Matthew. Bo agreed, and warned David not to push Matthew. David excitedly sat down in Matthew's room. Matthew opened his eyes, and David said that he wanted to take Matthew out. He asked if Matthew remembered the escorts they had picked up one night. David had the women on speed dial. He held the phone up to Matthew's hand, and told him to press the number of the woman he wanted.\n\n\n\"David,\" Matthew rasped. David was excited that he had gotten Matthew to talk. \"Thank God I'm here!\" David exclaimed. \"Don't tell Dorian, but you're my best friend!\" he told Matthew, and ran out of the room.\n\n\nEcho signed Gigi's name on the paper. Rex reminded her that it needed to be notarized. \"Consider it done,\" she said, and left. Rex told Gigi that everything was going to be all right, just as there was a knock on the door. Bo entered. He wanted to make sure that everything was all right, because he'd seen Echo rush out of the room. Bo was sorry that Rex couldn't do anything about Gigi's heart going to Clint. \"We'll see about that,\" Rex replied.\n\n\nSuddenly, David entered and babbled to Bo about Matthew speaking. Rex told Bo not to worry about Rex, so David dragged Bo away. Soon after, a doctor entered in order to take Gigi to the operating room. Rex begged for five more minutes to say goodbye, and the doctor agreed. Echo returned and informed Rex that she'd somehow gotten the papers \"predated, witnessed, signed, and filed.\" While at the courthouse, Echo had heard that Jack had been arrested, and was in police custody.\n\n\nRex happily hugged Echo. She assured him that she would be outside the room if he needed anything, and left the room. He told Gigi that Clint wouldn't be getting her heart. He was glad that Clint would go to hell, and Jack would go to prison. Rex vowed to make sure that Jack had no future and would never forget what Jack had done to Shane and Gigi.\n\n\nBo returned to Matthew. \"Dad,\" Matthew struggled to say. Bo explained that Matthew was in the hospital, and it had been touch-and-go for a while. He'd sustained a serious brain injury, but he was finally out of the woods. Bo asked if Matthew remembered what had happened to him. \"Yeah, I do,\" Matthew stated.\n\n\nJames left a message for Starr, and told her that he would wait inside the school for her at the graduation. Ford entered and glumly informed his brother that Jessica had returned. Ford told James what had happened, and that Jessica wouldn't let Ford near Ryder. Ford advised James to enjoy every minute he had with Starr.\n\n\nFord wondered where Starr was. \"Probably off listening to music,\" James spat. James informed a confused Ford about the musician that Starr had met. As a \"former player,\" Ford cautioned James to watch out for Baz, because he sounded desperate.\n\n\nStarr asked Blair how her trip to New York had gone. Blair confided that she'd met Tomas' wife. Starr wondered when the \"snake\" had planned on telling Blair that he was married. Blair explained that Tomas and his wife had been separated for years. His wife, Yvette, had always refused to sign the divorce papers, and had used their son as a weapon. She continued that Tomas had only found out the day before that the boy was his son. Yvette had only signed the papers so Tomas would take their son, Sebastian, off her hands.\n\n\nBlair went on that she would feel sorry for Sebastian if he hadn't been so \"sarcastic, arrogant, and snooty.\" However, she'd had a hand in convincing Sebastian to return to Llanview with Tomas. Starr related that T\u00e9a would give Sebastian a much-needed attitude adjustment. Blair admitted that she'd promised Sebastian that Starr would hang out with him. Starr wondered when she would have time between taking care of Hope, doing schoolwork, and spending time with James.\n\n\nBlair told Starr to get to Nate's graduation, but Starr accused Blair of changing the subject. She wondered what her mother was going to do about Tomas. Blair didn't know. She suggested that Dani would take Sebastian to the graduation with her. Starr finally agreed to go, and left.\n\n\nTomas arrived at Todd's with Baz. Dani walked down the stairs, so Tomas introduced Baz to his cousin. Dani wondered when Tomas had a son. He replied that he and Baz had only found out about Baz's paternity the night before, and they'd both been surprised. \"Welcome to the club,\" Dani responded. Dani thought Baz was handling things better than she had when she'd found out about her paternity. When Baz expressed his curiosity, she promised to tell her story to him soon.\n\n\nBaz challenged Tomas about Tomas being scared to let people know about their story. Tomas confessed that Yvette had engaged in an affair, and had always said that Baz was her lover's child. Baz wondered if Tomas had believed her because it had been convenient. Baz thought that, when Tomas had said that Baz and Dani would have a lot in common, it would be more than \"daddy issues.\" Tomas said that they had music in common, because Dani was a singer. Dani insisted that her sister was a better singer than her.\n\n\nBaz informed Dani that he was a composer. Dani told him that Tomas was a great composer as well. Dani had to leave for Nate's graduation, but was happy to leave Baz and Tomas to talk. Baz insisted on going with Dani. She agreed, and told Baz that he could meet her sister and friends. Dani suggested that Tomas fill T\u00e9a in on the situation while they were gone. She hugged her uncle, and left with Baz.\n\n\nTomas' phone rang, and he answered it to Blair. She wondered how Sebastian was doing. \"He couldn't leave fast enough,\" he said sadly.\n\n\nIn the school gym, Nate and the rest of his class were congregated to receive their caps and gowns for graduation. Deanna entered and told Nate about Matthew's improving condition. Nate was scared that Matthew would tell his parents that Matthew's condition had been Nate's fault. Deanna assured Nate that he'd only punched Matthew because Matthew had killed Eddie. Matthew wouldn't want that information to get out, so he would keep quiet.\n\n\nDeanna had done research, and found that most people with serious head injuries didn't remember what had happened to them anyway. Nate thanked her for her reassurance, and left to get his cap and gown. Rick suddenly appeared, and told Deanna about his new movie, Hold the Diploma. He needed a \"hottie\" for the lead. \"You're recruiting for porn in a school?\" a horrified Deanna asked.\n\n\nDeanna threatened to call security. Rick advised her not to, since he knew about what Nate had done to Matthew. He thought that Bo would love to know the information. Deanna reasoned that it had been an accident. Rick informed her that, since Nate hadn't turned himself in, Deanna was an accessory. He promised to forget about everything if she would star in his next movie.\n\n\nDeanna refused to do porn. She turned to leave, but Rick grabbed her, and threatened to call the cops. Ford and James appeared, and took Rick's hands off of her. Rick asked for her final answer, but Ford and James dragged Rick out of the gym. Nate walked over and wondered what had happened. Deanna said she'd met Rick when she lived at the Minute Man. She reluctantly informed Nate that Rick knew what Nate had done to Matthew.\n\n\nAs Ford and James dragged Rick out, Rick complimented the brothers' looks. He wondered if they'd ever considered careers in \"low-budget films.\" Starr walked past the commotion, but didn't hear it due to the volume of her music.\n\n\nInside the gym, Dani was telling Baz about how angry she'd been to find out about her real father, but that it had turned out all right. She urged Baz to give it time to get used to Tomas, because Tomas was a good guy. Baz asked what had changed things for Dani and Todd, but Starr arrived. Dani spotted her, and pointed her out to Baz. Starr waved, and was shocked to see Baz standing with Dani.\n\n\n",
