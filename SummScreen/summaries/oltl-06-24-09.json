While Matthew thought it was \"cool\" that Greg was Destiny's brother, Rachel was not impressed. \"So you're the hotshot who left town and never looked back,\" she proclaimed. Insisting that there was another side to the story, Greg refused to discuss his private life any further. A very confident Greg advised Matthew that he felt sure he'd be able to help the boy to walk again.\n\n\n \n\nAn unhappy Clint looked on as Nora and Bo clasped hands in anticipation. An openly hostile Rachel challenged the doctor and wondered why he was so sure he'd be able to help when other doctors indicated that nothing could be done for her brother. Greg responded that all of the other doctors were wrong. Rachel wondered if the doctor's optimism was due to the check that Clint had just handed him. She added that she was trying to protect her family when Greg sarcastically asked if she were a doctor.\n\n\nRex and Brody had a hostile encounter in the steam room at Serenity Springs. Rex initiated the conversation and asked Brody how it felt to be the latest man to be used by Gigi. Sarcastically, he suggested that perhaps they would be able to bond over their shared experience. Brody, quick to jump to Gigi's defense, found it difficult to believe that Rex actually thought that Gigi had slept around. Reminding Brody that he had seen her with his own eyes, Rex refused to listen to anything that Brody had to say. He announced that Stacy was the only person he was listening to and trusting. Brody was astonished.\n\n\nRex threatened bodily harm to Brody as the man insisted that while there was more for Rex to know, he was unable to tell him anything. He was only able to advise Rex that if he hooked up with Stacy, he would ruin things.\n\n\nAs the little tutu-clad girls waited at Ultraviolet for Stacy to start the dance class, Jessica arrived with Bree. The little girl mentioned that she missed Chloe. Hand in hand, Jessica walked her young daughter into the club, dismayed to learn that Stacy was the teacher. The two women had words as they each pointed out the offenses of the other. \n\n\nJessica declared that at least she had been mentally ill when she had committed her crimes. She wondered what Stacy's excuse was. Jessica assured Stacy that she had paid the price for her deeds. She was also positive that Rex and Gigi would get back together. She grabbed Bree's hand and stormed out, suggesting that they head to the community center.\n\n\nStacy lectured the little girls on working hard, and talked about how they might think they'd be dancing to the Nutcracker one day, but would end up stripping instead. As the girls complained about Stacy not starting the class, she talked on, as if they weren't even there. She spoke about working hard and how wonderful it was when \"he\" had applied the suntan lotion to her back. She was about to get what she wanted. She told the girls to never give up and they would attain their dreams. As she ended, Rex was standing in the doorway.\n\n\nOnce the girls left, he expressed how nice her thoughts had been about the girls following their dreams. He admitted that he had been avoiding her and was listening to voices in his head telling him what he should want. \"I want you, Stacy,\" he confessed.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler explained to Natalie and Jared that Gigi never slept with all of the men she had been accused of sleeping with. A fuming Natalie found it difficult to believe as she and her husband headed out the door. \"Tell them,\" Schuyler urged Gigi. Running after them, Gigi shouted, \"Wait!\" She told them that dropping the charges against Kyle was a matter of life and death. She further explained that her motives all revolved around her wanting to save her son's life.\n\n\nShe added that she always loved Rex and always would. She proceeded to tell Jared and Natalie that the entire sordid tale revolved around Stacy and her reluctance to donate her stem cells to Shane unless Gigi broke everything off with Rex. Responding to questioning from the couple, she explained that she had been unable to fake the breakup, since Stacy was too smart for that. Speechless, Natalie and Jared apologized profusely, admitting how bad they felt after hearing the truth.\n\n\nWhen Schuyler chimed in, Jared had his own question. \"Who exactly are you?\" he wondered. Schuyler filled him in quickly and took up where Gigi had left off. He clarified that Stacy was not even the donor of the stem cells. \"Blow that psycho sister of yours out of the water,\" Natalie insisted. \n\n\nGigi explained that she couldn't, still fearful that Shane might need help again down the road. She advised Natalie and Jared that Kyle knew the identity of the actual donor. While they knew that Kyle was scum and had done awful things, Gigi and Schuyler needed the charges against him to be dropped in order to obtain the information they were seeking.\n\n\nThe fact that Stacy was probably blackmailing Roxy was added to the mix but Natalie was sure she wouldn't be able to get any information out of her. Jared thought that speaking to Rex was another option. Gigi felt that while Rex might kick Stacy out, her sister would still be \"holding all the cards.\" Jared couldn't believe that Stacy had made such an evil plan. \"Who thinks like this?\" he asked. Natalie indicated that while she and Jared wanted to help, they couldn't bear to keep another secret. They had gotten into trouble and caused too much pain to others by keeping secrets in the past. She would drop the charges against Kyle if Gigi confessed all to Rex, Natalie exclaimed.\n\n\nLangston and Dorian were in high spirits after the meeting with Markko's mother. Mrs. Rivera had accepted the case they had made and was on their side. It was only a matter of time before Mr. Rivera would allow Langston and Markko to be together again. It was obvious to them that Mrs. Rivera was prepared to battle her husband for the teens. Dorian suggested that Langston get in touch with Markko and share the news, but Langston reminded her that Markko no longer had his cell phone. An amused Dorian wondered what people did before cell phones were invented.\n\n\nAt the caf\u00e9, Destiny told Shaun about her run-in with Justin and Becca at the country club and why she had been fired. She admitted that she hadn't stopped to collect her pay or tips. She told her brother that she was a loser. Shaun offered to accompany Destiny back to the country club in order to obtain her money. Mr. Rivera sat at the counter and told his recently arrived wife how he had heard about all of the lives that Dorian had destroyed in their town, including their son's. Overhearing, Markko insisted that Dorian and Langston were two separate people, but his father would not listen.\n\n\nWhen Markko was asked to take a phone call for a food order, he was pleased to find Langston on the other end. \"We have a problem,\" he told her, his smile disappearing, as she enthusiastically told him of the meeting with his mother. Speaking in code, he was able to acknowledge that his father was within hearing distance. Hanging up the phone, he indicated that he needed to make deliveries. He wondered if his father would follow, but Mrs. Rivera advised her husband to back off.\n\n\nDestiny was thrilled to find her brother Greg sitting with Matthew and his family at the country club. Shaun looked on disdainfully as his sister and brother hugged. As Destiny thanked Greg for heeding her plea and coming to Llanview, Shaun eyed the check sitting on the table. He wondered if that was the real reason for Greg's visit and challenged him on it. Greg assured his sister that while Clint had asked him for help, she was the reason he had agreed to it. He wanted to help her boyfriend. Destiny whispered that Matthew was not her boyfriend.\n\n\nAn excited Bo and Nora hugged each other while a dejected Clint looked on again. Rachel was not so easily impressed. She warned Greg that he'd be in trouble if he played her family. Destiny admitted that she knew her brother was playing her and that he hadn't come to Llanview because of her. She shrugged and thought it didn't matter if he was able to help Matthew.\n\n\nMarkko arrived at La Boulaie with a food order and Dorian promptly apologized for the agony and pain she had caused. She assured him that she wanted to repair the damage and was happy that things had worked out after a meeting with his mother. Markko advised her that his father had heard about Dorian through the Llanview grapevine and things were not good. An irritated Dorian pointed out all of the things that she could say about the Buchanan family, indicating that she had her own side of the story.\n\n\nLangston pointed out that all of the wrongs Dorian had committed were true and there was no other side of the story. Standing up for herself, Dorian stressed that she had done lots of good things, too, and she felt that a meeting with Markko's dad was in order. Suddenly, she had a plan. She would have a wonderful meal at her house and invite everyone she had wronged, along with Markko's parents. She would \"charm the pants off your father,\" she told Markko.\n\n\nWith Langston wondering why any of the wronged individuals would go to La Boulaie, Dorian felt certain they would want to throw their support behind Langston and Markko. Markko kissed Langston and regretfully told her that he had to head back to work before his father searched for him.\n\n\nJessica and Bree met with Brody at the caf\u00e9. She told him how they had walked out on the dance class when she learned that Stacy was the teacher. She explained that she and Stacy had turned on each other before she left. Brody assured her that Stacy wasn't \"playing with a full deck.\" Brody told her about his confrontation with Rex. Mr. Rivera looked at his watch.\n\n\nShaun ignored the call from Dorian.\n\n\nHer calls going unanswered, Dorian left messages for her proposed guests. She promised a worried Langston that she would do anything to fix things for Langston and Markko.\n\n\n",
