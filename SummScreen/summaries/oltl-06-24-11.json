    "soap_central": "\n\nFor the graduation ceremony, in the high school gym, Dani introduced her cousin, Baz, to Starr, who appeared surprised to see him.  Starr then remembered that her mom had just told her that Tomas had a son, Sebastian.  Baz explained that he was called Baz for short, and Dani realized that she had to leave to meet Nate.  Dani then asked Starr to please hang out with Baz.\n\n\nStarr thought that it was weird that they had met just the prior week, but that Baz was already living at her dad's place.  Baz and Starr discussed music, and Baz discovered that Starr had been listening to his music and asked her to check out his new song.  James walked through the gym and saw them talking.  Starr introduced Baz and James to each other and reminded James that she had told him about Baz.  Starr related that Baz had just moved to Llanview.\n\n\nBaz claimed that he and Starr were totally connected and then announced that he would stick around as long as Tomas paid his way.  Baz revealed that he could see the possibilities of living in Llanview, and Starr explained to James that Baz wanted to record his new music with the equipment at Capricorn.  Baz declared that it would be a great collaboration.\n\n\nIn another part of the gym, Deanna explained to Nate, who was dressed in a cap and gown, that a film director, Rick, knew what Nate had done to Matthew, because he had overheard them talking about it at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.  Nate panicked and cried that he had always known that Matthew could get better and remember about the incident, but that someone else also knew about what had happened to Matthew.  Nate declared that both the district attorney and the police commissioner would be happy to put away the person, who had almost killed their son.\n\n\nNate asked Deanna what Rick wanted to keep him quiet and exclaimed that he did not have any blackmail money.  Just as Deanna was about to tell Nate what Rick wanted, Dani ran up to them.  After Deanna left to find a seat for graduation, Dani insisted that Nate had much to be proud of, such as being president of the film club and a member of the honor society, and for dealing with all of the craziness with his dad.  Nate beamed and noted that it sounded like Dani was running to be president of his fan club.  Dani exclaimed that she already was and kissed Nate.\n\n\nNate then opened the gift that Dani had bought him for graduation and found a new camera.  Nate was thrilled but exclaimed that it was too much, however, Dani expressed her desire to take a picture of Nate in his cap and gown.  When Dani reviewed the picture, she commented that it looked like Nate's mug shot.  Nate frowned.  Dani then grabbed the camera to take pictures during the graduation ceremony, and Nate thanked her for the camera.  Nate also said that Dani was amazing and kissed her.\n\n\nAfter Dani left, Deanna walked back up to Nate, who begged to know why Rick had chosen that time to reveal that he knew the truth.  Deanna believed that it had something to do with Rick's production schedule and indicated that Nate probably would not like what Rick wanted from him.  Nate replied, \"Probably not, but whatever he wants, I'll do it.  If I don't, then Matthew's parents are going to find out that I nearly killed their son.\"  Deanna then revealed that she and Nate both had to star in Rick's new movie -- a porn movie.\n\n\nIn Matthew's room at the hospital, Bo asked Matthew who had caused Matthew to hit his head.  Matthew croaked out that Eddie knew, and then Matthew went into seizures, as Nora ran in.  Dr. Pryor arrived and asked Bo and Nora to leave the room, as she examined Matthew.\n\n\nBo told Nora that Matthew had tried to tell Bo who had caused his injury, and that Matthew had mentioned Eddie.  Nora speculated that Matthew might have felt guilty about what had happened with Eddie Ford.  However, Nora was thrilled that Matthew was communicating with them and hugged Bo.  Dr. Pryor entered the hall and explained that although Matthew could understand and was communicating, he still had a lot of rehabilitation ahead.  The doctor told Bo and Nora not to frustrate Matthew and then explained that she had just given Matthew a sedative.\n\n\nIn Clint's room at the hospital, Clint asked Viki if she had felt different after she had been given Ben's heart.  Viki indicated that she had felt different, at first, but that her body had then adjusted.  Viki also stressed that she had never forgotten that every day after had been a gift.  Natalie pranced in and stated that the doctors would be prepping Clint for surgery; Rex then walked in and stated that Clint's surgery was off.  Rex declared that he would not allow the doctors to cut up Gigi just to save Clint's miserable life.\n\n\nRex then revealed that he had been given Gigi's proxy, and that he had the power of attorney over Gigi.  As Rex started to leave, Clint stopped him and said that he had something to say to Rex, \"father to son.\"  Clint related that Viki had indicated that once Clint received a new heart, he would be unable to take any more days for granted.  Clint then exclaimed that he wished that he had gotten to know Rex better.\n\n\nRex wondered if, after the surgery, Clint would welcome Rex home with open arms, slap a cowboy hat on him, and say that Rex was a chip off of the old block.  Rex howled, \"Yesterday, I was a piece of garbage.  You were lying here half dead already, and you still couldn't wish me well on my wedding day.  And now you're asking me to give you Gigi's heart?  You'll say anything.\"  Rex realized that Clint had only seen Gigi as a bargaining chip that he could use and then discard, and that Clint had never cared about Gigi.  Rex exclaimed that maybe God could forgive Clint, but that he could not, and stormed out of the room.\n\n\nNatalie followed Rex into the hall and begged Rex to let Clint have the transplant, for her sake.  Rex maintained that he could not let the doctors cut open Gigi to keep Clint Buchanan living.  Natalie cried that Gigi was gone, and that she was \"never coming back.\"  When Rex insisted that it was justice, Natalie pleaded that Rex do it for her.  After Viki walked into the hall and asked Natalie to sit with her father, Natalie wailed that she would, while she still had time left.\n\n\nViki informed Rex that she had been thinking about Gigi, and that Rex should be too.  Rex replied that he only thought of Gigi and Shane.  Viki reminisced about when she had first met Gigi and Shane in Paris, Texas, and about when Gigi had bought Viki lottery tickets, even though Gigi did not have much money, just to share her good fortune.  Viki insisted that was how she would always remember Gigi.  \"Gigi Morasco is one of the most generous, loving souls I've ever met in my life.  That's why she signed an organ donor card.\"\n\n\nViki understood that Gigi had wanted to help someone else live, however, Rex claimed that it would not have been Clint.  Yet, Viki wondered if Gigi would let Clint die and not give Rex's father the chance to make it up to Rex.  Viki pointed out that Gigi forgave.  Viki pleaded with Rex to honor Gigi and her wishes, because that would be what Rex would want to tell Gigi's son.  Viki left, and Bo walked out of the elevator.\n\n\nRex announced to Bo that there would be no transplant and showed Bo the proxy.  Rex stated, \"Lucky I got it in time,\" and Bo replied, \"Yeah, lucky.\"  Bo reminded Rex that Clint was Bo's brother but then remarked that he knew how Rex felt, because Bo and Nora had just gone through the same type of thing with Matthew.  Bo insisted, \"Whatever you decide to do is not going to change our friendship.\"\n\n\nAfter Rex asked about Matthew, Bo revealed that Matthew had said a few words about who had tried to hurt him, and that he was getting better.  Rex then indicated that he was on his way to watch the cops lock up Jack Manning, so he could tell Gigi that the person who had put her in that bed would pay.\n\n\nWhen Bo walked into Clint's room, Viki announced that she and Natalie should return home to check on the boys.  Bo regretted what was happening with Clint, but Clint believed that Bo thought it was justice.  After Clint asked about Matthew, Bo stated that Matthew was getting better.  Clint pleaded with Bo not to let Matthew try to clear Clint's name of Eddie Ford's murder, because Matthew deserved to have a clean slate.  Clint wanted it all to stand, as his last good deed.\n\n\nAfter Natalie and Viki rejoined Clint in his room, Natalie cried that she wished that Clint could see his grandsons again.  Clint requested that Viki and Natalie get the family in to say their final goodbyes.\n\n\nIn John's office at the police station, John informed Todd, T\u00e9a, and Jack that a witness had seen the whole incident, and Brad stood at the office door.  John indicated that they had an offer for Brad and asked if Jack thought those kids would continue to protect Jack.  John noted that the courts did not treat bullies well.  When Todd and T\u00e9a pointed out that none of the high school kids had seen the accident, John said that he would look into it and left his office.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked Jack what good it had done to provoke the detective and insisted that she needed to know everything that had happened the night of Gigi's accident.  T\u00e9a then wondered what Brad would say to John.  Jack yelled that Brad would say that it had all been Jack's idea.  T\u00e9a claimed that she would give Jack the best defense she had, when Brad's dad arrived.  Mr. Kozinski talked to the police officer outside of John's office door, and the cop escorted Brad's dad to Interrogation Room number two.  Todd followed.\n\n\nTodd stopped Mr. Kozinski in the hall and indicated that it had all been a prank, and that John was determined to turn it into a major crime.  Todd insisted that Mr. Kozinski would need a good lawyer, since the incident had happened on his property.  Back in John's office, T\u00e9a informed Jack that Gigi had no brain function, and that she was near death.\n\n\nIn Interrogation Room number two, John handed Brad a glass of water and asked him what had happened at the house that his family owned.  When John indicated that ComicGirl15's profile had been created on Brad's account, Brad yelled that he had not done anything.  However, John stated that it was not what Jack had said.  John revealed that Jack had claimed that Brad had devised the whole plan.  John then asked Brad for the truth.\n\n\nJohn reminded Brad that he could \"go down for attempted murder,\" and that all of the evidence pointed to him.  Brad snickered and suspected that it was all a trick.  John pondered if Jack would take the rap to protect Brad, or if Jack would let Brad be sentenced to jail for him.  John asked Brad to tell him the truth, so that John could make it right.  Brad was about to tell John the truth, when his father burst through the door and yelled, \"Brad, don't say another word.\"  Mr. Kozinski then announced that an attorney was on his way.\n\n\nTodd returned to John's office and lied to T\u00e9a by claiming that he had left a message for Blair, but that T\u00e9a would handle Jack's arrest, and that it would all be over by the time that Blair received the message.  T\u00e9a then asked Todd what he had done.  John walked into his office and asked Todd how much it had cost to buy off Brad's dad.\n\n\nJohn announced to Todd, T\u00e9a, and Jack that Brad had confessed to being ComicGirl15 and to locking Gigi into the basement. John stated that Brad had also claimed that Jack had nothing to do with it.  Todd told Jack that he was free to leave, as Rex walked into the police station and yelled, \"What?\"\n\n\nThe man who resembled the original Todd looked through the window at La Boulaie, and when he saw Sam with an apple, he knocked on the window.  Sam went outside and asked the man if he had taken care of the dead guy.  Sam then exclaimed that the dead man should not have tried to shoot Sam.  When the man asked Sam about his dad, Todd Manning, Sam revealed that his dad was not married to his mom.  The man then asked if Sam's mother's name was Blair, and Sam stated that was correct, although he called her mom.\n\n\nSam also stated that he lived with his stepmom, T\u00e9a Delgado.  The man heard a voice in his mind that he had been married to another wife named T\u00e9a.  The man then asked Sam for his dad's address.  The man explained, \"Okay, Sam, you're not going to tell anybody that you gave me your father's address, right?  No one at all.  It's going to be our little secret like...like the one we had with the bad man.\"  Sam asked, \"Are you going to sue my dad?\"  The man swore, \"I can probably say this...nothing bad is going to happen to Todd Manning.\"\n\n\nAfter Sam replied, \"Good, \" the man with the scar said, \"Come on, let's get you inside.\"  Sam wondered, \"Am I going to see you again?\"  The man answered, \"I hope so.\"  Sam and the man butted hands, and Sam walked inside.  The man who looked like the original Todd pulled out a gun and walked off. \n\n\n",
