    "soap_central": "\nFuneral for a Friend:\n\n\nJohn paid Todd a visit at Todd's new place. When he found a prescription bottle, John questioned Todd. Todd lied and claimed that the medication was for his tennis elbow. To prove it, he took a pill in front of John. John didn't appear to be convinced, but he did drop the questions about the pills and switched to interrogating Todd about the missing mystery woman that Ramsey had kept hidden in one of his bedrooms. Todd refused to cooperate and managed to send John on his way. Once John left, Todd went to see Marty. She had overheard part of the conversation between John and Todd. Todd continued twisting the truth when Marty began asking questions about John. When Todd left, after telling Marty that he was going to Lee Ramsey's funeral, John stepped out from behind some bushes. He broke into Todd's home and started to make his way upstairs. Marty was in bed, looking at a picture of her and John. \n\n\nAntonio and Talia searched for an intruder in Talia's apartment. They discovered that someone had thoroughly searched the apartment. Layla arrived home a few minutes later. While she checked her room for any possible missing items, Talia called Sarah to let her know the break in. After Talia ended the call, Antonio and Layla prepared to leave for Nash's funeral. Antonio and Talia suspected that the break-in and Ramsey's murder were connected so Talia remained behind to check a few leads online. Her investigation led Talia to a picture of Jonas. Talia pulled out Cris's sketch, of the man who had approached him and Sarah in the park a few days earlier, and compared it to Jonas' picture. She realized that the sketch was of Jonas. Just as Talia made the connection, Jonas walked into the apartment. Talia pulled out her gun and told Jonas that he was under arrest. Jonas chuckled and reminded Talia that she no longer worked for the Llanview police department. He then shut the door, confident that Talia would not shoot him. Later, Jonas placed a call to his accomplice. He told the person that Talia had been dealt with. \n\n\nAt Cris's studio, Sarah was worried after she learned about the apartment break-in. She told Cris that Talia and Antonio suspected that the man in the park was behind it. Cris turned to Tina for answers. Tina realized that she couldn't continue keeping secrets. She reluctantly told Sarah and Cris that she had gone to Ramsey to buy back the crown jewels of Mendorra. Cris didn't believe Tina so she produced proof. Sarah was curious when she noticed that the initials: H.R.H. appeared before Tina's name on the bank document. Tina explained that it stood for \"Her Royal Highness.\" Sarah was stunned to learn that her mother had met and married the Crown Prince of Mendorra the previous year. Cris didn't seem surprised that Tina had not bothered telling anyone, much less her children, about the marriage. Tina apologized to Sarah but Sarah seemed more concerned about the danger that her mother was in. Cris suggested that they call and tell Antonio but Tina didn't agree. She wanted Cris and Sarah to give her time so that she could take the crown jewels and return to Mendorra. They agreed to give her until nightfall and then left to attend Nash's funeral. \n\n\nTina placed a call to an unknown person and talked about Sarah. Tina wanted to stay in town for a while longer so that she could spend more time with Sarah. However, Tina realized that her situation was too dicey to risk remaining in Llanview. Before she ended the call, Tina promised that she would be in contact again when she reached the airport. After Tina ended the call, she left Cris's studio. Jonas caught up with Tina at Angel Square. \n\n\nRex passed the diner and saw Gigi, Shane, and Brody inside, sharing a booth. After a few minutes, Rex decided to go in and approached the trio. Shane proudly showed off the ribbon that he and Brody had won on Father's Day for the three-legged race. Shane went on to boast that his father, Brody, had decided to remain in Llanview and had moved in with them. Rex was surprised by the news. He told Shane that he was happy for him before he left for Nash's funeral. At the door, Rex took a moment to look back at Shane, Brody, and Gigi. \n\n\nAt Angel Square, Jared checked the paper for possible apartments while Natalie talked about Nash's funeral. She wanted to go to the church to say goodbye to Nash, but knew that her presence would only upset Jessica. Roxy came along a few minutes later. She was on her way to the funeral but had decided to stop off and buy a bottle of wine. It was from Nash's vineyard and was the last remaining bottle on the shelf. When Rex happened by, Roxy tried to talk to him. Rex made it clear to his mother that he had nothing to say to her. Roxy appeared deeply hurt but left without pushing the issue further. Rex stayed behind to speak to Natalie for a few minutes. As he prepared to leave for Nash's funeral, Natalie asked Rex to give Bo a message. Rex told her that he couldn't; it wouldn't be appropriate given the circumstances. \n\n\nJared and Natalie decided to attend Nash's funeral, but were careful to keep themselves apart from the rest of the mourners. \n\n\nJessica tried to get through Nash's funeral but it was difficult for her even with her parents at her side. Sarah sang a beautiful ballad that she had composed for Nash. As the family gathered around Nash's casket, Jessica gently placed a card that Bree had made for her father on top of it. Clint was the first person to give a eulogy. He spoke about the respect and admiration he had for Nash. Viki followed and talked about Nash's devotion to Jessica during her battle with Hepatitis. Roxy was next. She spoke about how accepting Nash had been. After Roxy stepped down, Jessica stood and approached the podium. She tried to hold back the tears as she began talking about her husband and what he had meant to her. Roxy turned to look at Rex as Jessica spoke and then stood up and walked out of the church. Heads turned when Roxy opened the door and Jessica stopped talking. Natalie and Jared were revealed to be standing in the foyer of the church.\n\n\n",
