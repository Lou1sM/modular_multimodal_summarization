As Rex leaned in to kiss Gigi, he spotted a gray suitcase and walked over to check it out.  As Rex hoped that the suitcase might contain a treasure, Gigi feared that it might hold a bomb.  Rex proclaimed that the suitcase and all of its secrets belonged to them.\n\n\nCristian reminded Layla that they should be on their way to her mother's house, but Layla stalled and insisted that they could wait a few more minutes...or days.  Cristian looked for his cell phone to call her parents, but Layla stopped him.  When Layla asked if Cristian thought that she was chicken, Cristian noted that Layla was afraid to tell her parents of their engagement.  Cristian suggested, \"But look, if it's such a big deal to tell your family we're engaged, why don't we just take it out of the equation.\"  When Layla cried, \"You don't want to get married,\" Cristian declared, \"Even better...let's elope.\"\n\n\nCristian pointed out that if he and Layla eloped, it would be their wedding, and they would not have to worry about everyone else's attitudes.  Layla explained that if they eloped, she could hear her mother scream, \"How can my baby girl elope and not have me at the wedding.\"  However, Cristian maintained, \"Which is way better than 'I won't let my baby girl marry that guy.'\"\n\n\nRex and Gigi ran to Cristian and Layla with the suitcase, which Gigi called \"a shiny, silver box.\"  After they discussed many theories of what the suitcase might contain, Rex opened it and found nothing but a business card for Ford's Body Shop.  Rex wondered if the suitcase belonged to Cristian's roommate, Ford.  When Rex saw that the address for the body shop was in Dayton, Ohio, Gigi speculated that the suitcase might belong to one of Ford's relatives.  Cristian felt that someone should question Ford, but Layla stated that Rex would be the one to question him.  Layla announced that she and Cristian were leaving for her mother's house, and Cristian and Layla decided to have the wedding after all.\n\n\nAfter Cristian and Layla left, Rex stared at the suitcase, as Gigi sprinted off for a swim in the lake.  When Rex insisted that Gigi wear plenty of sunscreen, Gigi explained that she had no tan lines, since she liked to sunbathe in the nude.  After Gigi removed her jacket and threw it on Rex, he ran to join her.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Department, Detective Price and John were discussing a case, when Todd and Blair barged into John's office.  Todd demanded that the police haul in Hannah.  Blair cried that she and Todd still had not heard from Starr, and Todd believed that Hannah had taken her.  Todd stressed that Hannah had killed John's baby, had pushed Marty down the stairs, and had attacked Ford, but Blair insisted that they honestly did not know anything.  John indicated that it appeared that Starr had left voluntarily but then asked Blair and Todd if they wanted to file a police report.  Blair maintained that she and Todd did not really know anything, so John advised them to \"go about your business\" to the car dealership to buy Starr's car.\n\n\nOnce Todd and Blair left, John observed to Detective Price, \"They're right about one thing.  Disappearing like this isn't like Starr.\"  When John expressed that he was not sure that Todd had attacked Ford, Detective Price guessed that John was still looking at the O'Connor girl as a suspect.  John speculated that Cole could be in danger, since Hannah was fixated on him.  John also worried that if someone were \"to set her off, there's no telling what she would do.\"\n\n\nDetective Price returned to John's office with a file on Hannah and revealed that Hannah's parents had been in Europe the past couple of months and were backpacking up north.  John received a phone call and discovered that Hannah had left the state and was in Delaware.  As John and Detective Price pondered Hannah's visit to Delaware, John requested the family financials from the file.  John exclaimed, \"Bingo\" and revealed that Hannah's family owned a beach house...in Delaware.\n\n\nAt the beach house in Delaware, Cole and Hannah kissed and kissed and kissed.  As they lay on the couch, Cole spotted a condom wrapper and immediately stopped kissing Hannah.  Cole cried, \"I can't do this.\"  Cole explained to Hannah that he did not want to use her and then dump her.  When Hannah asked Cole if he cared about her at all, Cole insisted that he did care about her, because she had been a good friend to him.  Hannah was relieved, because Cole had helped her out in the past.  But Hannah then insisted that Starr was \"trying to break them up,\" because Starr could see that Hannah was falling for Cole.  However, Cole explained that he was a mess, because he had no idea what was going on between him and Starr.  Hannah exclaimed that she did not want to change their friendship.\n\n\nWhen Cole revealed that he had never had the chance to take a nap, Hannah recommended that they get a room at a hotel along the highway on the way home.  Yet, Cole insisted that they stay at the beach house, until he could find Starr.  Cole declared that he would sleep on the floor, but Hannah offered Cole the bed.  Cole then announced that he and Hannah could share the bed.  As Cole slept next to her, Hannah glanced at him and smiled.\n\n\nAt the car dealership, James had broken into the office to steal Starr's car, and he fumbled with the keys.  Starr insisted that James did not need to steal the car, because Todd was going to buy it for her.  James admitted that if he stole the car, Starr would be an accomplice, and James did not want that.  James claimed that he would turn himself in at the police station, and Starr reminded James that the police would put him in jail.  James commented that at least his dad would not be able to touch him in jail.  Starr yelled, \"Steal it\" and then blared, \"Get the keys and let's go.  I need to get back to my family.\"\n\n\nWhen James pointed out that he would need a diversion to steal the car, Starr insisted that they do it quickly, or they would both be in jail.  The salesman walked into the office and asked Starr to have a seat and to fill out the paperwork to purchase the car.  As the diversion, Starr told the salesman that James wanted to see a sports car on the lot, and the salesman beamed, \"Right this way.\"  James and the salesman walked out, and Starr was in the office alone.\n\n\nLater, at the car dealership, Blair told Todd to quit making everything in their lives all about him.  The salesman walked up to them and revealed that Starr was no longer at the dealership.  The salesman told Blair and Todd that Starr had thrown a fit when the salesman refused to give her $50,000, and that Starr had then stolen a car.  When Blair insisted that Starr would never steal a car, the salesman offered to show her \"the security footage.\"  Blair asserted that Starr's father was buying Starr a car for graduation, but the salesman revealed that Starr did not want the car, only the cash.\n\n\nThe salesman explained what Starr and her accomplice had done, and Blair thought that the accomplice was Hannah.  However, the salesman related that the accomplice was a man.  When Blair showed him the picture of Starr and Cole, the salesman revealed that the girl in the picture had stolen the car, but that the guy in the picture was not the accomplice.  The salesman described the accomplice.  As the salesman picked up the telephone, Todd shouted that he would buy \"this establishment\" and \"run him out of business,\" if the salesman were to call the police.  \n\n\nTodd told the salesman to write up the sale, because \"there was no theft, there was no theft.\"  When Todd speculated that Starr was doing what she wanted to do, Blair did not agree.  Todd exclaimed that, at least, Starr was not with Cole.  \"It's a win.  Anyone, besides Cole, is a step up.\"\n\n\nAfter Starr and James raced away with the car from the dealership lot, they pulled onto the shoulder of a road.  James declared that Starr was driving erratically, and that the first rule of car theft was \"to blend into traffic and don't draw attention to yourself.\"  Starr asserted that James had a car to give to Bull as a pay-off.  Starr then asked James, since he was the master carjacker, \"What happens now?\"  James replied, \"I have no idea.\"  \n\n\nJames said that he had to figure it out, since he did not know anyone in Llanview to fence the car parts.  When Starr cried that she just wanted it all over immediately, James told Starr that he would call Bull.  When Starr asked why, James stated that Bull could take the car, since they did not have the money.  \"It's the only choice we've got.\"\n\n\nAt the country club, Nate declared to Dani that he would have to remain a towel jockey, since the line was too long for the waiter's job.  When Dani reminded Nate that he was $50,000 richer, Nate asked if she had ever watched the repossession of someone's house.  Nate explained, \"It's not pretty, and I don't like to see you frown.\"  Destiny walked up to them and informed them that Matthew was \"off their case.\"  Destiny explained that she had talked Matthew down, so \"now you two can make out in peace.  No one's going to bother you.\"  When Dani tried to thank her, Destiny reminded Dani that Matthew was \"one jealous puppy right now\" and \"could put you both in a world of hurt.\"\n\n\nAfter Destiny left, Nate expressed that he was relieved to hear the news about Matthew, but Dani was uneasy.  Nate claimed that Matthew would blame him, because Matthew cared very much for Dani.  Nate insisted that Dani and Matthew \"could go back to being okay...you know, like friends.\"  Dani then announced that she had to leave for dinner at home with Todd, since Todd was being \"genuinely nice\" to her mother.\n\n\nIn another area of the country club, Matthew overheard Bull telling a person on his cell phone that he had found the kid who had stolen the $50,000.  Matthew informed Bull that he had overheard Bull say that \"a guy took 50 G's,\" and that the guy had been hanging out with a Manning girl.  Matthew insisted that he could help him find the guy, because he knew \"this Manning girl.\"  When Matthew related that he was helping Bull, because he was \"a pretty helpful guy,\" Bull figured that Matthew was out to settle a score of his own.\n\n\nMatthew told Bull that Nate Salinger was carrying the money around in a backpack.  However, when Matthew relented and claimed that maybe he had the wrong guy, Bull believed that Matthew was right and asked where Nate was.  Matthew witnessed Dani and Nate kissing, just as Bull asked, \"Don't you want a little justice done?\"  Matthew responded, \"He's right over there\" and pointed to Nate.  \n\n\nWhen Bull said that he was going to get his money, Matthew told him to be careful, because Nate was a brown belt.  Bull remarked, \"It's a shame if his pretty little face got busted up in the course of this exchange, wouldn't it?\"  Destiny greeted Matthew, as Bull walked off, and asked, \"A friend of yours?\"  Matthew claimed that Bull was a friend of his parents.  Before Dani left, she thanked Matthew for \"not making Nate's life miserable\" at the country club.  Matthew stressed that he did not do it for Dani.\n\n\nBack at the stolen car, James called Bull, \"Good news.  I've got your money.\"  Bull replied, \"No kidding...I thought you lost it.\"  James revealed, \"It turned up.\"  Bull warned, \"Lucky you.\"  James clarified, \"So, just to be clear, I give you the money today, and we're clear, right?\"  Bull verified, \"If that's how it goes, sure.\"  James insisted, as he checked on Starr in the car, \"That's how it goes.  And I'm sorry to have been so much trouble.\"  Bull responded, \"It's okay.  We all make mistakes,\" as he pointed a gun at Nate in the country club office. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew overhears Bull talking on his phone about \"some kid who's stolen his $50,000 with his girlfriend, the Manning girl\" and assumes he's looking for Nate who is with Dani. So he helps Bull to find Nate. Meanwhile, James is with Starr scrounging to find a way to get the $50,000 and afraid both their lives are in danger if Bull finds them and they do not. So, they conclude the only way to accomplish that is to steal the car that Todd has intended to buy Starr for graduation. Todd and Blair go to the police station where John cannot locate Starr. They later go to the dealership and find out she's apparently stolen a car and has a young male accomplice with her. They see the photos and are baffled as to who the strange boy may be. Meanwhile, Hannah has dragged Cole to her family's cabin in Delaware and has convinced him that Starr has dumped him for another guy. James believes he's \"successful\" in getting Bull what he wants and calls him. Bull is not angry with James now that he believes he's found the kid who's stolen his $50,000 who is Nate.",

John requested the family's financials from the file and revealed that Hannah's family owned a beach house...in Delaware. He then dumped her and then explained to Hannah that he didn't want to use her and that he would dump her if she did not use her. Cole then stopped kissing Hannah and stopped kissing her.\n"
