He tries to guilt David by bringing up how he bailed him out of jail because he is his brother and that he would hate to see him go to jail for a long time for shooting Thomas McBain. David reiterates the fact that he is going to plead guilty so that Spencer can no longer hold it over him as leverage. When Spencer starts in on Paige, she reveals that she told Bo how she assisted Spencer in delivering Margaret's baby. Spencer thinks she's bluffing at first but then tells her it doesn't matter since it will be her word against his and since her reputation has been tarnished, no will believe her. An angry Paige throws him out her room when he starts in on the planted evidence against Bo. Outside Paige's room, Spencer receives a call from the morgue attendant who wants assurance that Spencer is going to live up to his end of the bargain since he desperately needs the money for his ill sister's operation. Spencer gives his assurance and the morgue attendant assures Spencer that no one will hear the truth from him.\n\n\nBlair is surprised when she returns to the penthouse to see that Todd has returned home. He tells her that although he slept alone, it felt good to be in his own bed. He inquires as to whether Blair was with Spencer. Blair hesitantly confirms that she was with Spencer but it's not what Todd thinks. When Blair doesn't elaborate, Todd kicks her out of the penthouse. She tries to gather some things for her and the kids but Todd refuses to let her take anything saying that he will forward her things. He also informs her that he is suing for full custody of Starr and Jack since he does not want them living under the same roof as Spencer. Blair insists that she and the kids will be staying with Dorian but Todd wonders for how long.\n\n\nAfter fighting with Todd, Blair heads over to see Bo and sees him packing his things. She tells him that Todd threw her out of the penthouse because she was with Spencer. Bo tells her that it's ironic how she is trying to get evidence on Spencer for Todd but she is pushing Todd further away in the process. Blair agrees but tells him that she is not only doing this for Todd since she let a manipulative Spencer into her and her children's lives and now she has to make things right. She baits him with information that she has obtained but knows that he does not want to hear since he does not support what she is doing. Bo finally relents and Blair informs him that she overheard David confess to killing Tom McBain but that she will not testify against David until she has evidence on Spencer.\n\n\nRex recants for Bo how he and Adriana were attacked by her stalker at Dorian's. Bo wants to know how long Rex planned on keeping secret how the attacks had been escalating. Rex agrees that he needs help protecting Adriana but Bo informs him that there is nothing he can do now that he no longer has his badge. He tells Rex that he needs to talk to John and let the police take over the situation. Rex agrees to contact John but tells him that he is the best cop and man that Rex knows.\n\n\nDorian is stunned when Adriana fills her in on her stalker situation. She is afraid for Adriana especially since the stalker was bold enough to attack her at their home while Starr and Jack were right inside. Adriana tries to get Dorian to see how Rex protected her but Dorian's main concern is protecting Adriana and finding someone to watch over her. She does acknowledge that although she did not approve of Rex and Adriana's relationship, she is grateful that Rex was there to protect her and promises to thank him the next time she sees him. However, when Rex shows up at the house she yells at him instead for not informing her that Adriana was being stalked. Adriana steps up and tells her that it was her idea to keep Dorian in the dark against Rex's wishes. Rex promises a grateful Dorian that he will watch over Adriana. Behind Adriana's back Dorian hires Darryl to be Adriana's bodyguard and after she leaves, he makes a phone call thanking the person on the other end.\n\n\nMichael finds it odd that they haven't received any calls from social services about potential adoptive parents for Thomas. Marcie reveals that they did receive a call about a family who wanted to see Thomas that day but she told them that they were too busy to set up the appointment. When Michael inquires about what they are doing that will keep them so busy, Marcie tells him that they have to go shopping.

As they are getting ready to go shopping, they spot David and Marcie tears into him for all the hurt that he caused her husband and his brother. David begs Marcie to not make a public scene but Marcie does not care and continues berating him.
