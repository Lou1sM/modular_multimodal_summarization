Insisting that she needed to protect her son, Marty asked John if he could help her and Cole disappear.  In an attempt to change her mind, John told Marty that Cole would never want to leave Starr and Hope.  Reminding John that Cole was headed to prison, Marty stated that Cole would be out of contact with Starr and Hope for quite some time.  \n\n\nMarty informed John that Cole and Starr wanted to get married in order to prove that they were committed to one another.  Marty questioned why Asher had been given probation for selling drugs, while Cole was sentenced to prison for trying to rid himself of the drugs that Asher had placed on him.  John agreed that Asher was the cause of Cole's troubles.   Before rushing off, John told Marty that he believed that he could help Cole, and asked her to keep the faith.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, as Starr and Cole looked on, Todd told Blair that he had given the teens his permission to marry.  Blair questioned why Todd had chosen to allow Starr to marry Cole, but Todd swore that he had decided that he wouldn't interfere in Starr's life.  Convinced that Todd had an ulterior motive, Blair turned the tables on Todd and stated that she would sign the consent form.   Blair signed the consent form as Todd watched in horror.\n\n\nAt Todd's home, T\u00e9a smiled as she listened to the tape in which Todd confessed that he would kill Cole if he ever married Starr.  Shaun entered the room and informed T\u00e9a that he had overheard the tape.  Pointing out Todd's vindictive nature, Shaun questioned if T\u00e9a was certain that she wanted to cross Todd. T\u00e9a made it clear that she knew how to handle Todd better than anyone.  Shaun unnerved T\u00e9a when he commented on Blair's beauty and insisted that Blair and Todd were meant to be together.   Announcing that she needed to run an errand, T\u00e9a abruptly interrupted Shaun's praise of Blair and instructed him to give her a ride.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Todd was shocked when Blair presented him with the consent form and instructed him to sign it.  Noticing Todd's hesitation, Starr questioned why her father wouldn't sign the form.   To everyone's surprise, T\u00e9a entered the room and remarked that she had the answer to Starr's question.  Realizing that T\u00e9a was up to something, Todd suggested that she leave, but T\u00e9a refused.  Instead, T\u00e9a gave Todd a devilish smile as she played the tape of Todd's confession.  \n\n\nStarr, Blair, and Cole were stunned to hear Todd threatened to kill Cole if he married Starr.  As Todd's angry voice echoed throughout the room, Starr and Blair gave Todd a look of disgust.  When Todd demanded to know why T\u00e9a had betrayed him, T\u00e9a insisted that Todd deserved to be exposed.  Blair and Starr lashed out at Todd.  Todd tried to explain that he was only looking out for Starr, but she refused to listen and stormed out of the room. Before walking away, an angry Todd told T\u00e9a that she had no idea of the trouble that she had caused.\n\n\nOut on the patio, Starr confronted Todd and demanded him to take responsibility for his actions.  Proclaiming his love for Starr, Todd told Starr that he didn't want to lose her or Hope.  Presenting him with the consent form, Starr instructed her father to prove his love-by signing the consent form and allowing her to marry Cole.\n\n\nAt Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven, Natalie and Jared pleaded with Roxy to tell them the identity of Shane's donor.  An angered Natalie informed Roxy that Gigi was going to tell Rex the truth about Stacy's blackmail.  Roxy panicked when Natalie related that Rex would hate Roxy once he learned that she had lied to him.  Fed up with Roxy's denial, Natalie stormed out of the salon.  Afterward, Jared was appalled when Roxy begged him to convince Natalie to drop the charges against Kyle.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Stacy happily related to Schuyler that she and Rex had made love.  Schuyler was disgusted to learn that Stacy had slept with Rex and questioned why she was looking for Gigi.  When Stacy hinted that she wanted to tell Gigi about her relationship with Rex, Schuyler urged her not hurt Gigi, and suggested that Stacy leave.  Schuyler's concern for Gigi made Stacy wonder if Schuyler had developed feelings for Gigi.    Confessing that she couldn't wait to tell Gigi the news, Stacy refused to leave until she spoke with Gigi.  Schuyler told Stacy that Gigi had taken the night off.\n\n\nStacy became enraged when Schuyler stated that he was aware of Stacy's motives.  Reminding Stacy that Rex was in love with Gigi and would never have feelings for Stacy, Schuyler said that Stacy was afraid and wanted to stop Gigi from wanting to rebuild her relationship with Rex.  Stacy declared, \"Gigi needs to know that I won!\"  Unable to listen to Stacy's ranting, Schuyler warned Stacy that Rex would eventually learn the truth about her.  A suspicious Stacy questioned if Schuyler was aware of Gigi's whereabouts, but Schuyler refused to give her any information.  Encouraging Schuyler to pursue Gigi, a smug Stacy informed him that he could never have her again.\n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, referring to Stacy as evil, Gigi told Rex that Stacy had used Shane to cause the breakup of Gigi and Rex's relationship.  Defending Stacy, Rex reminded Gigi that Stacy had saved Shane's life.  Rex was stunned when Gigi blurted out that Stacy wasn't Shane's donor.   Unwilling to believe that Stacy had pretended to be a match for Shane, Rex demanded answers from Gigi.  \n\n\nExplaining that Stacy had been obsessed with Rex for years, Gigi revealed that Stacy had threatened to allow Shane to die unless Gigi broke up with Rex.    When Rex questioned why she hadn't revealed the truth earlier, Gigi related that Stacy had threatened to leave town and Gigi feared that Shane would die without Stacy's help.  Gigi had to convince Rex that she had ended their relationship and tricked him into believing that she slept with Brody.\n\n\nAs Gigi proclaimed her love for him, Rex had a flashback of his rendezvous with Stacy.  Rex was stunned when Gigi further related that Schuyler had helped her retain proof that Stacy's DNA wasn't a match for Shane.  Rex wondered who the real donor could possibly be, but Gigi had no idea.  Insisting that she had lied in order to protect Shane, Gigi cried out, \"I love you and you now know the truth.  Shane is going to be fine and all I want is you!\"  As Gigi pleaded with Rex to believe her, Stacy entered the club and asked what was going on.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler thought about Stacy's question concerning his feelings for Gigi.\n\n\nAt the police station, Bo appeared bothered when Nora informed him that Matthew was excited about Dr. Evans' treatment that would help him walk again.  Bo was skeptical about Dr. Evans' claims.  Nora questioned if Bo was jealous because Clint had located Dr. Evans and convinced him to help Matthew.  Denying that he was jealous of Clint, Bo contended that he wished that Clint had discussed the matter with Bo and Nora before making the arrangements.\n\n\nAs Bo defended himself to Nora, Natalie and Jared rushed into the station and announced that they wanted to drop the criminal charges against Kyle.  Natalie argued that pressing charges against Kyle would only prevent Jessica from moving on.  Nora and Bo understood Natalie's concern.  Agreeing to drop the charges, Nora said that she would contact Kyle's lawyer and inform him of Natalie and Jared's decision. Alone, Jared told Natalie that Kyle would be happy to learn of the news.  With a knowing look, Natalie remarked, \"Oh, we'll make certain of that!\"\n\n\nKyle entered Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven and inquired whether or not Roxy had convinced Natalie to drop the charges against him.  A nervous Roxy claimed that she was working on it.   Kyle's attorney phoned, interrupting the conversation, and informed him that the charges had been dropped.  After hanging up with his lawyer, Kyle told a surprised Roxy that she had managed to convince Natalie to do his bidding.  Covering her tracks, Roxy convinced Kyle that she had worked hard to change Natalie's mind.  Citing that she had lived up to her part of the deal, Roxy asked Kyle if he would keep his promise and keep quiet about Shane's donor.  Giving Roxy a hug, Kyle promised that he would never reveal the true identity of Shane's donor.\n\n\nBack at the police station, Kyle thanked Nora and Bo for dropping the charges.  Pointing in the direction of Natalie and Jared, Bo informed Kyle that he owed his thanks to them.  Natalie and Jared confronted Kyle and demanded to know the identity of Shane's donor.\n\n\nJohn entered Bo's office and asked for his old job back.  Bo stated that he was delighted to have John back on the force.  John agreed to return on one condition.\n\n\nMarty smiled as she stared at a photo of Cole and Hope.\n\n\nBack at Foxy Roxy's, Roxy removed a plastic bag that contained the blood of Shane's donor.  As Roxy expressed her relief at having a backup sample for Shane, someone entered the salon and grabbed Roxy's hand.\n\n \n\n\n",
