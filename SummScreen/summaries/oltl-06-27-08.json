When Lindsay asked if Bo was sure, he asked if there was a reason why he wouldn't want her to be his bride. Lindsay had a flashback of the incriminating letter that R.J. had sent, and remembered that it was still in Nora's possession. Lindsay reminded Bo that they had tried the marriage route before. Bo stated that Nash's death helped him realize how precious life was. Bo told Lindsay that he didn't want to live without her. When Bo asked Lindsay if she shared the same feelings, Lindsay nearly cried as she told Bo that she had never gotten over him. The couple discussed how they turned to each other after the loss of Drew and Jen. Lindsay told Bo that there was something he didn't know about her. Bo rattled off the long list of misdeeds that Lindsay was responsible for, and told her that she had made some bad choices-but wasn't a bad person. Bo told Lindsay that he wanted a fresh start with her. Lindsay accepted Bo's proposal. \n\n\nNora sat in the bedroom and prepared to tackle the files that Bo had delivered. Just as she placed her hands on the folder that contained R.J.'s letter, she was distracted when Clint entered the room and put the folder away. Clint told her that Jessica insisted on staying at the cottage alone. Both, Clint and Nora worried about Jessica's state of mind. Clint wondered why Natalie would even consider showing up at the church with Jared, but believed it was a terrible thing for Jessica to unleash her anger upon them at the funeral. Nora stated that Jessica revealing her true emotions would probably help her to recover quicker. As Nora comforted Clint, he told her that he loved and needed her at that moment more than ever. As the file containing R.J.'s letter laid nearby, Nora and Clint made love. \n\n\nAs the telephone rang, an unresponsive Jessica was sprawled on the floor of the cottage. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, Nat wanted to apologize to Jessica, but Jared attempted to stop her by saying she would only make things worse if she spoke with her sister. Nat prayed that Jess would forgive her and Jared and eventually realize that Nash's death was an accident. Jared regretted his decision to scam the Buchanan's and seek revenge on Tess. He said that he deserved everything that had happened to him, but Natalie didn't. Nat refused to allow Jared to take the blame and expressed her need to mend her relationship with Jessica. Nat asked Jared if he believed Jess would ever forgive them. Jared stated that in time Jess would forgive Nat, but never him. He then begged her not to visit Jess. \n\n\nJessica staggered across the room to answer the phone. Jess spoke to her mother, who was frantic with worry. Although Jess assured Viki that she was doing fine, she appeared to be in distress. After hanging up with Viki, Jess stared at herself in the mirror. Appearing mesmerized by her reflection in the mirror, Jess undressed and let down her hair. Standing in her underwear, she threw an object into the mirror. She continued to stare at her reflection in the shattered mirror. Suddenly, Jess fell to the floor. \n\n\nAt the diner, Antonio and Cris were suspicious when they discovered that Talia had lied about being at the diner with an injured Carlotta. After realizing that Carlotta was fine and hadn't seen Talia, the Vega brothers knew that something was terribly wrong. \n\n\nSarah arrived at the apartment and questioned why Talia wasn't at the diner. A terrified Talia turned around to face Sarah and began to apologize to her, but Jonas snuck up behind Sarah and chloroformed her. Talia rushed to Sarah's side to help, but Sarah was unconscious. When Talia asked Jonas why he would resort to such tactics, he stated that he didn't hurt Sarah-Talia did. Talia reminded Jonas that he was the one who chloroformed Sarah, but Jonas said Talia lured Sarah back to the apartment and diverted the Vega brothers. Talia insisted that Jonas didn't give her a choice in the matter. With a devilish grin, he assured her that she made the right choice. \n\n\nA frantic Tina arrived at Cris's loft and hid the diamonds among Cristian's belongings. She observed a sketch of Sarah that Cris had drawn. Tina expressed her guilt over placing her daughter in danger, but was thankful that Sarah was safe at the church-or so she thought. \n\n\nAs an unconscious Sarah rested on the couch, Talia checked her vital signs and questioned Jonas' next move. Talia received a call from Antonio on her cell phone, but Jonas wouldn't allow her to answer. Afterwards, Jonas stated that he had plans to effectively deal with Sarah and would receive help from Talia. When Cris was unable to reach Sarah on her cell phone, the brothers headed to the girls' apartment. \n\n\nAt the apartment, Antonio and Cris discovered that Talia and Sarah were missing. Realizing that the girls were in danger, Cris decided to come clean with Antonio. Cris revealed to Antonio that Tina was the mystery woman in Ramsey's apartment and that Jonas was searching for her. Cris told Antonio that Tina was the princess of Mendorra and had recovered the missing jewels. Cris admitted to hiding Tina in his loft because Jonas was after her and the jewels. Antonio was outraged to learn that Cris had some involvement in Ramsey's murder case and demanded that Cris take him to Tina immediately. The Vega boys headed to the loft. After Cris and Antonio left the apartment, Jonas forcibly led Talia back into the apartment and complimented her on not tipping off Antonio. Talia asked what Jonas planed to do with Sarah, but Jonas told her that all she needed to worry about was cooperating with him and reminded her that there would be consequences if she didn't. \n\n\nBack at Cris's loft, Tina worried about David Vickers, the dog. She vowed to find him. Meanwhile, as Nat and Jared discussed the possibility of Nat mending her relationship with Jess, David Vickers, the dog, wandered over to them. Nat and Jared were stunned when they read the name on the dog tag. Jared and Nat decided to take the homeless dog with them. They kissed and stated that they were glad to have each other. \n\n\nOver the phone, Tina updated an unknown person on her predicament. She insisted that she wasn't to blame for the unfortunate events and reminded the person that they were both involved in the situation. As Tina pleaded her case to the unknown accomplice, Cris and Antonio entered the loft and interrupted her conversation. Upon learning that Cris had told Antonio everything, she lashed out at him and demanded to know Sarah's whereabouts. Antonio told Tina that Sarah and Talia were both missing and that he believed Tina was responsible for their disappearances. At that moment, Antonio received a call that was placed from Talia's phone. Jonas identified himself to Antonio and handed Talia the phone. Antonio demanded to know why she was with Jonas, and Tina began to scream, \"Where's Sarah?\" Talia told Antonio that she was sorry, and Jonas snatched the phone from her. In the background, Jonas heard Tina's screams. Jonas told Antonio to inform the princess that Sarah was with him. When Antonio threatened Jonas not to harm the women, Jonas advised him that he wasn't in any position to make threats, and warned Antonio not to involve John. After Jonas hung up, Antonio told a worried Tina and Cris that Jonas didn't reveal what he wanted or what he planned to do with Sarah and Talia. \n\n\nBack at the apartment, Talia told Jonas that Antonio wouldn't allow Jonas to carry out his plans. As he forcibly grabbed her, Jonas warned Talia not to attempt to call either Antonio or John. He looked at his watch and announced that it was time to go and meet Antonio. \n\n\nIn a room in the church, someone dressed in black opened Nash's coffin. A black coat fell to the floor. Wearing heavy makeup and dressed in a tight-fitted dress, Tess hovered over Nash's dead body and stated, \"Hey baby. I'm here. It's me, Tess!\"\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, Natalie and Jared are out on their own, realizing they are unwelcome in the family. And while at the park, Tina's dog appears, Natalie notices his name tag that says David Vickers and she wants to take him home. Jessica is distraught by the loss of Nash. And Tess comes back. Clint declares that he wants Nora in his life. And Bo asks Lindsay to marry him.",
