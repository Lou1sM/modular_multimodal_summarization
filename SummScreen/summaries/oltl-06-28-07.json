She's really not, she doesn't care, she says, but quickly amends that to caring in a different sense. She's afraid a charming David will get Viki to marry him by the time he's through, which causes Clint to laugh. They'll have to get married to keep raising the bar to get her upset. Clint does not want to hear about this, doesn't want her to go to Viki's to \"mouth off\" and doesn't want her to make a fool of herself. She's overreacting and falling for the bait, he warns her. If she cares about him, she won't go, as their actions reflect on each other. He wonders why her relationship with Viki always comes first and before she can deny it too much, he points out that the two women are like an old married couple. How can their relationship work out if she can't overcome the past? Dorian swears Clint is her first priority but unfortunately, she would forget who she herself was if she didn't pursue this. She's off, but promises to be gone for only a few minutes. Clint calls Viki to warn her of Dorian's imminent arrival and leaves. \n\n\nViki is greeted by a bath-mat clad only David as he finishes his shower. She's embarrassed and turns away, trying to get him to put something else on. She really wants him to leave and admits she only agreed to let him stay to annoy Dorian and Clint. He quickly agrees that he's on board to ruin Dorian and he'll make it worth her while if she lets him stay. He'll provide companionship, the kind that any kind of woman would want, he offers. He continues to talk about \"them\" as she keeps ordering him out. She's not interested and offers to call the Palace. Regrettably, Dorian shows up before Viki can get David out of her room. Actually, he won't leave and instead pushes her gently onto the bed and begins to kiss her as Dorian makes her way upstairs.\n\n\nBlair, Cris and a late-arriving Rex anxiously wait for their delayed plane to Chicago to depart. They have the same address but Rex thinks the others should have called Bo, in case it's a trap. Rex and Cris manage to smooth things over between the two of them. Cris is invited to the next Jen memorial and he offers his support to Rex in his pursuit of Tate and the truth. Blair is missing the opening of the school musical and calls Starr, telling her to break a leg. She also advises her that she's hired someone to videotape the show for her.

She leaves the door unlocked. The three arrive and enter the place when Blair's knock is not acknowledged. The guys try to stop her but she runs to the bedroom. \"No!\" she yells.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, John warns Miles that his marriage is over and he knows everything. As he animatedly and loudly speaks, Nat comes over to tell him to lay off. He shouldn't be speaking to Miles like that in public. Plus, John has a crush on Marty, Nat tells Miles snidely. Miles actually defends John, and after Nat walks off, Miles is asked if he's blackmailing her too. John acknowledges to Miles' surprise that yes, he knows of the blackmail and mentions the tape. Miles steadfastly sticks to his tale of love and how it was Marty's idea to get married. Miles wants to know if Marty will be arrested. Nat again comes by to find out what's going on but she's not successful. Layla appears jealous of Nat but Vincent successfully convinces her that their hug wasn't what it looked like. He begs for a second chance and kisses her. He'll be straight with her. She's agreeable.\n\n\nBo and Lindsay entertain Tommy and try to get him to bed. Bo rather enjoys himself, seeing that he missed lots of bedtimes with Drew and Matthew. Lindsay offers to call him over whenever she babysits. She also asks for advice on getting over the death of a child, seeing that it doesn't seem to be getting any easier. He will let her know how it is, should it ever get that way, he tells her sympathetically. She also wants to tell him something but they're interrupted by a phone call. Miles wants to tell him something about Spencer's murder.\n\n\n",
