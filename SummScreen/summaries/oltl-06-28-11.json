    "soap_central": "\n\n\"Damn you, Todd,\" T\u00e9a said though sobs as she stood alone at the docks. The man with Todd's original face had followed her, and he watched T\u00e9a as he remained out of sight. Suddenly, he silently made his way over to her and stood behind her. He looked as though he wanted to comfort her, but he ran off when Sean suddenly appeared and called out to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nShaun couldn't believe that T\u00e9a had been unaware that a man had creeped up behind her, but T\u00e9a had been oblivious. \"As long as it wasn't Todd Manning,\" she said to Shaun. She didn't want to discuss the latest problem, but it involved Todd. \"He's a hard man to love,\" T\u00e9a admitted. She thought that she and Todd spent equal amounts of time both hating and loving each other.\n\n\nShaun pointed out that the couple had something real if they kept on marrying each other. T\u00e9a disclosed that she'd married Todd for money the first time around, but had fallen in love for the second wedding. The man lurked in the background and remembered all that T\u00e9a spoke about.\n\n\nShaun felt that T\u00e9a didn't hate Todd, only his actions. T\u00e9a pointed out that Todd had never changed, and he refused to learn from his mistakes. Shaun put his arm around T\u00e9a, and accompanied her away from the docks. The man stepped out from the shadows.\n\n\nAt the Manning residence, Jack admitted that he'd been eavesdropping on Todd and T\u00e9a because he had felt bad about their arguing. \"I did what I did to save your sorry ass,\" Todd yelled at his son. Jack wondered if Todd had paid off Brad's father. Todd advised his son that someone had to pay for what had happened to Gigi, and Jack should have been happy that it hadn't been him.\n\n\nTodd stated that he'd protected Jack, though Jack disclosed that he felt sorry for Brad. Todd lost his temper. Jack had committed a stupid prank and had almost ruined his life over it. \"Thanks?\" Jack said sarcastically. \"Shut up and listen,\" Todd yelled at his son. He announced that he wanted Jack to be involved in running the newspaper when he was older, and Jack reminded him that it wouldn't be for a very long time.\n\n\nTodd insisted that they would discuss it, because he'd gone to a lot of trouble for Jack. He intended to have Jack spend every day with him at the office over the summer, and there would be no friends on the weekends. He wanted Jack to grow up and not ruin his life the way that Todd had. Todd and Jack shook hands. \"I'll be with you every step of the way,\" Todd promised.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Echo spoke to someone on the phone and advised the party that she wanted fireworks and a full report. Viki spotted her nemesis and glared at her. Viki wondered what Echo was up to and assumed that Echo was hiding something. Viki assured Echo that she didn't care who Echo was talking to. Echo suggested that it might be Charlie, but Viki knew better. She was certain that Charlie would never talk to Echo again after the way Echo had lied to him.\n\n\nEcho wanted a truce, because she and Viki were both at the hospital due to family issues. Viki stated that Clint receiving Gigi's heart was up to Rex, and Echo admitted that she was upset about Gigi. Echo couldn't help but add that Clint's deteriorating condition was Dorian's fault.\n\n\nViki was confused, so Echo explained. Echo wondered how Viki thought the discovery of Echo's statements about Clint being Rex's father had been divulged in the first place. It was due to Dorian, who'd had possession of the recorder. Dorian had refused to give any aid to Clint until he'd given her the recorder.\n\n\nThere would have been no other way for Dorian to have gotten her hands on the recording, Echo clarified. Dorian had used it against Clint. It was possible that Clint might have been helped sooner, and then he wouldn't have found himself at \"death's door.\" Echo thought it was important, and that Viki should know about it. Viki wondered why Echo was just telling her the truth after so much time had elapsed.\n\n\nRex visited with Clint and advised him that there was a condition for receiving Gigi's heart. Clint pointed out that he knew there had to be \"an angle.\" Rex noted that Clint had always presumed that Rex was a \"good-for-nothing\" and had kept him out of the family. Suddenly, Rex held the power in his \"grubby gold-digging hands,\" and he didn't want to disappoint Clint.\n\n\nClint thought that perhaps Rex wanted an apology or wanted Clint to admit that he'd been a terrible father, but Rex confided that he wanted to live up to Clint's expectations of him. Rex wanted all of Clint's money. Clint figured it would all boil down to \"cold hard cash,\" but Rex insisted that it wasn't that simple. He had to sacrifice the heart of the person he loved most in the world. \"I want everything,\" Rex declared.\n\n\nRex proceeded to list every possible asset that Clint might have. The list included cash, stocks, Buchanan Enterprises, and Clint's house and cars. Rex proclaimed that he even wanted the \"dust under the rugs.\" He wanted Clint to be broke, broken, and homeless. Clint reminded Rex that it wasn't that easy, because he had a multi-billion dollar enterprise. He couldn't liquidate that quickly, and he wondered if Rex had considered his siblings.\n\n\nClint added that Rex couldn't have the house either, because that belonged to Cutter, the results of another deal. Rex advised Clint that there would be no deal unless he received everything that he wanted. Rex added, \"If there's a hell, you'll go straight there.\" Rex explained that he wanted the power and money for his own reasons, though Clint figured it was to humiliate Clint. Rex called that part a bonus.\n\n\nClint informed Rex that Rex was more ruthless than Clint thought. \"Guess I'm a Buchanan after all,\" Rex affirmed. He thought it was too bad that Clint didn't have the time that he claimed he needed to get everything together.\n\n\n\"I missed you so much,\" Ionia shrieked as she ran into David's arms at La Boulaie. \"Get your hands off my man, bitch,\" Dorian yelled as she strode into the foyer to witness Ionia all over David. Ionia whined that she'd thought that she and David would be alone, and she advised Dorian that she and David were in love. David repeatedly insisted that there was nothing going on with the actress, who was crazy. The woman was obviously obsessed with him, David advised his wife.\n\n\nDorian asked about the photographs of David and Ionia that she'd seen. Ionia swore that she and David were having an affair, and because she'd played Dorian in their movie, she knew all about Dorian's behavior. Ionia advised Dorian that Dorian should give up, because Dorian certainly knew the time was right to let David go. David proclaimed that he was happily married, and that there had never been anything between him and Ionia. He pushed the actress away as she stuffed her Palace room key into his pocket.\n\n\n\"I didn't like that,\" Dorian declared once they'd gotten rid of Ionia. David hoped that Dorian believed him, even as he looked at the key, which was from the Penthouse Suite. He was certain that the whole thing had been a setup. Dorian looked at the photographs again. She wanted to believe her husband. David suggested that Clint might be behind the photos, but Dorian didn't think that was possible. David declared that he and Dorian had to trust each other.\n\n\nEcho and Ionia met up at Capricorn, and Ionia revealed that everything had gone well and according to plan. She was certain that Dorian was starting to doubt David. Echo praised the woman and vowed to destroy Dorian. \"She won't know what hit her,\" Echo said.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Rama attempted to console Nigel, who was distraught over Clint's condition. When the doorbell rang, Cutter ordered Nigel to answer it, but ended up opening the door himself after Nigel rebelled. It was Aubrey, and she announced that she was moving back in. \"Did hell freeze over?\" Cutter asked her. Aubrey explained that she'd been kicked out of Llanfair after Jessica had returned for Ryder, and she had nowhere else to go.\n\n\nCutter assured Aubrey that her problem wasn't his, and no amount of begging on Aubrey's part would move him. Aubrey continued to plead her case. \"You betrayed me,\" Cutter reminded her. \"You owe me,\" Aubrey reminded Cutter back.\n\n\nVimal had an herbal remedy that he tried to get Rama to drink in order to help her pregnancy. It was awful tasting, and Rama refused. She stated that she had morning sickness, but Vimal didn't believe that was possible given that she was past the first trimester. Vimal believed that Rama was trying to protect him, and she was really sick over Cristian's kiss. Vimal vowed to protect his wife and baby always.\n\n\nThe conversation between Cutter and Aubrey grew into a loud argument, as each accused the other of making certain choices over the years. Vimal was annoyed, and ordered them to quiet down, because the \"negative energy\" was bad for the baby. \"Wake up,\" Aubrey proclaimed, adding, \"Rama is not pregnant.\" Vimal accused Aubrey of lying. Nigel received a phone call and left the group.\n\n\nRama asked to speak to Vimal alone, but Aubrey continued. Aubrey stated that Rama had gotten Vimal to \"take the fall\" for Clint, and had convinced Vimal to go to jail because she'd told him she was pregnant. Rama had held something over Aubrey's head, and she also had something on Cutter. Rama looked sick as her husband looked at her questioningly. Rama admitted that Aubrey was telling the truth, and she insisted that she'd planned on telling Vimal herself. Rama pleaded with Vimal to understand, and she said she loved him.\n\n\nVimal repeated that Rama had lied to him, and he couldn't believe that she had made him go to jail for money. He ordered his wife to go away. \"Nice. You just ruined his marriage,\" Cutter informed Aubrey, who disagreed. Vimal would have found out anyway, Aubrey stated, though she apologized. She reached out to Vimal. \"Don't touch me,\" Vimal shouted. He couldn't believe what had happened, all because of the Buchanan money.\n\n\nAubrey was sorry, because she knew what it was like to lose someone she loved. Cutter demanded that both Aubrey and Vimal leave the house. The pair tried to figure out what they could do, but Vimal wanted nothing to do with Aubrey.\n\n\nNigel finished with his phone call and informed Cutter that the house no longer belonged to Cutter. He took great pleasure in explaining that Cutter had obviously not read the small print in his contract with Clint. It stated that Clint could take the house back at his discretion. Cutter quickly thumbed through the pages. Just then, a honking horn sounded from outside. Nigel advised Cutter to hurry and pack his things, because the movers were waiting.\n\n\nCristian looked at a drawing on a piece of paper while he was tending bar at Capricorn. He was surprised to see a distraught Rama. She proclaimed that her marriage was over. Cristian was sorry. He explained that the drawing he held was one that Gigi had done. It had never been completed, just like Gigi's life. Maybe things would turn out for the better, Cristian thought. Life was short, but he and Rama could be together.\n\n\nRama couldn't think of that, and she admitted that she'd lied to Cristian about things too. She'd persuaded Vimal to take the blame for Clint, because she had wanted to get rich. She would understand if Cristian wouldn't talk to her again. Cristian declared that he wouldn't, and he walked away.\n\n\nJoey, Kelly, and Viki arrived at Clint's room, and Clint announced that he would be receiving Gigi's heart. He gave his family the details, and Viki urged the others not to blame Rex. The young man was grieving, she told them. Nigel arrived with a large box filled with documents, and Rex walked in shortly after.\n\n\n\"So what's up? Do we have a deal?\" Rex asked. Clint revealed that he'd had emergency plans drawn up after he had believed that he would be going to jail. He had intended to transfer everything to his sons, and regrettably, Rex fit that designation. As Clint signed the form, Rex pointed out that Clint had also lied about how fast he'd be able to make the arrangements. Viki agreed to be a witness to the signature.\n\n\nRex asked again about the house, and Clint tossed him the house keys. Nigel expressed how happy he was that Clint had a chance at life. Rex wondered what else was in the box, and he looked inside. It contained some stock certificates, papers, and the combination to the safe. Rex also found a ring that had belonged to Clint's mother. He picked up the box and its contents and left the room.\n\n\nClint asked Viki to find the doctors, because he was ready for the transplant. He had given everything away, but he would soon have a new heart and a chance to live.\n\n\nRex returned to Gigi's room with the box. He was sorry, but he'd had to do it, he explained. He had the money and power that would enable him to destroy Todd and Jack. He promised that the Mannings would pay. \"But how do I let you go?\" Rex wondered.\n\n\n",
