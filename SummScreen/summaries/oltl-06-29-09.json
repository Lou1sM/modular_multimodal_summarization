Ignoring Stacy's questions, Gigi continued to beg Rex to forgive her.  Rex shocked Gigi when he ordered her to leave the club.  Stacy was delighted when Rex looked at Gigi and declared, \"It's too late.  I won't take you back because I'm with Stacy now!\" Rex watched as a devastated Gigi walked away.\n\n\nAfterward, Stacy continued to press Rex for answers regarding Gigi's visit.  Certain that Gigi had bashed her to Rex, Stacy urged Rex not to believe anything that Gigi had told him.  Although he appeared toward her, Rex tried to convince Stacy that Gigi hadn't revealed any startling information.  Realizing that Stacy was suspicious, Rex assured Stacy that he cared about her.  \n\n\nStacy wondered if Rex could possibly love her.  When Rex hesitated, Stacy covered her tracks and apologized for being so forward.  Stacy announced that she also cared for Rex and was happy with their new relationship.  Stacy asked Rex to escort her back to the loft, but Rex made up an excuse and promised to meet her at home later.  Before leaving, Stacy tried to kiss Rex on the lips, but he turned away and accepted a kiss on the cheek instead.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler sat in silence as he thought about Stacy's remark questioning whether he had developed feelings for Gigi.  Schuyler was stunned when Gigi entered the bar in tears and announced that Rex didn't believe her confession and that he had kicked her out.  Gigi feared that Rex might mention her accusations to Stacy, who in turn might leave Llanview without revealing the identity of Shane's donor.  Schuyler was certain that Stacy had no intention of walking away from Rex, and nearly blurted out Stacy's claim that she and Rex had sex.  Unwilling to hurt Gigi, Schuyler didn't reveal Stacy's admission and did his best to console Gigi.  A tearful Gigi told Schuyler that she had ruined her chance of reconciling with Rex.\n\n\nLater, a depressed Gigi returned home and cried as she thought about losing Rex.  Gigi was shocked when Rex showed up at the cottage to see her.  Certain that Rex had come to chastise her, Gigi insisted that she couldn't handle Rex's harsh criticism of her.  Rex pulled Gigi into an embrace and kissed her passionately.\n\n\n\n\nAt the police station, Natalie and Jared demanded that Kyle give them the name of Shane's donor or else they would initiate blackmailing charges against him again.  Kyle advised the couple that he was warned that Rex would be devastated by the revelation of the true donor.  Kyle also mentioned that he had promised Roxy to keep the donor's identity a secret.  Unmoved by Kyle's pleas, Natalie and Jared instructed him to give up the name of the donor or face the consequences.  Cornered, Kyle announced that he didn't know the name of the donor, but stated that he would take them to the facility were the patient resided.\n\n\nLater, Kyle, Natalie, and Jared arrived at the long-term care clinic.  As Natalie and Kyle stood in the background, Jared pulled back the curtain that surrounded the patient.  A horrified look crossed Jared's face as he looked down at the patient.\n\n\nAt Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven, Roxy was shocked when an unknown woman entered the salon and snatched the bag of blood out of Roxy's hand.  The woman announced that she was the day nurse who had been assigned to John Doe, the patient whom Roxy had stolen the sample of blood from.  Referring to Roxy as a murderer, the nurse revealed that she was aware that Roxy had pulled the plug on her patient.  Hoping to receive sympathy from the nurse, Roxy informed the woman of Shane's condition.  Roxy stated that Shane needed the blood sample in case he relapsed, and insisted that John Doe was a horrible man.  To Roxy's surprise, the nurse informed Roxy that she was aware of Shane's medical problems and had no sympathy for Roxy's predicament.\n\n\nAdvising Roxy that she had committed murder by removing the patient's life support, the nurse insisted that Roxy should've handled the matter in accordance with the law.  Walking towards the door, the nurse placed the bag of blood in her purse and stated that Roxy should be grateful that she wasn't being charged with committing a crime.  Before the nurse could exit, Roxy threatened to attack the nurse with a hot curling iron.  The nurse looked amused as Roxy exclaimed, \"You'll walk out of here with that bag of blood over my dead body!\"  Removing a hypodermic needle from her purse, the nurse remarked, \"That can be arranged!\"\n\n\n\n\nInside Bo's office, John agreed to return to work at the Llanview Police Department if Bo convinced the judge to reverse his decision on sending Cole to Statesville Prison.  Expressing his belief that Cole had been set up, John was convinced that Officer Keaton was somehow involved in the recent escalation of drug activity in Llanview, and for some reason he had used Asher to target Cole in order to accomplish his goal.  Acknowledging that Officer Keaton appeared to be an underachiever, Bo revealed that the officer appeared to be satisfied working as a beat cop and had expressed no desire to be promoted.  John explained that he wanted to set up a special drug task force and use Cole as an informant.  The task force would also include Officer Keaton, along with Officer Fish and a few other officers that John trusted. Although skeptical, Bo agreed to John's demands.\n\n\nBo called Officer Keaton into his office for a meeting.  Upon being introduced to John, Officer Keaton apologized for arresting Cole, but insisted that he was only doing his job.  As Bo informed Officer Keaton that he wanted to place him on the new task force, John observed his demeanor.  Officer Keaton accepted the new appointment without hesitation.  Alone with Bo, John voiced his suspicion over Keaton suddenly wanting to be taken off of street duty.  Citing that if his suspicions concerning Officer Keaton turned out to be true, John insisted that he would do everything possible to take him down.\n\n\n At La Boulaie, Blair, T\u00e9a, and Cole stood by as Starr ordered Todd to prove his love for her by signing the consent form so that she and Cole could get married.  Citing that Starr would ruin her life by marrying Cole, Todd refused to sign the consent form.  Reminding Todd of his promise to do anything necessary to prove his love for her, Starr suggested that he keep his word.  Cole pleaded with Todd to reconsider, and professed his love for both Starr and Hope.  Refusing to back down, Todd said that Cole wasn't capable of financially providing for a wife and child.  Lashing out at Todd, Starr warned her father that once she turned eighteen, she would leave with Hope and he would never see either of them again.\n\n\nUnwilling to lose Starr and Hope, Todd reluctantly signed the consent form.  Pulling Blair to the side, T\u00e9a stated that Blair was also against Starr getting married, and urged Blair to speak up.  After thanking Todd for changing his mind, Starr and Cole left to celebrate their upcoming wedding.  Alone with Blair and T\u00e9a, a furious Todd blamed both women for placing him in a position in which he had to give in to Starr's demands.  Insisting that Todd always fought to the end, Blair criticized Todd for backing down.\n\n\nStarr and Cole celebrated with Hope at Rodi's.  While Starr was thrilled that her parent's had given permission to get married, Cole was depressed about going to prison and missing out on Hope's first few years.  Starr assured him that she would do everything possible to help Hope learn about her father while he served his prison term.  As Starr and Cole made plans, Schuyler approached the table.  Starr introduced Schuyler to Hope and informed him that she and Cole were getting married.  Schuyler was pleased to meet Hope and happily congratulated Cole on his upcoming nuptials.\n\n\n",
