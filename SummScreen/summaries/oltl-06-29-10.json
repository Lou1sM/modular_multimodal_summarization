Rex explained that Ford had put the moves on his son's mother, Gigi. Ford didn't recognize the name, which prompted Rex to say that Ford lived up to his bad reputation.\n\n\nRex explained the real reason why he was visiting Ford -- he had found an empty metal briefcase at the quarry with a business card in it that read \"Ford's Body Shop.\" Rex had found out that Ford was from Ohio, which was where the business was located. Ford asked Rex where he found the briefcase because the business card was from his father's shop. Rex asked if Ford's father could have left it, but Ford didn't think his father would be anywhere near Llanview.\n\n\nRex asked if his father was even still alive, to which Ford replied that the man was, \"unfortunately,\" still alive. He explained to a perplexed Rex that his father's goal was to make everyone around him miserable. Ford had nothing to do with his father after Ford had taken off years before and never returned. Rex wondered how the card got in the case, but, remembering James being in his hospital room, Ford said he had no idea how it could have gotten there.\n\n\nRex wondered who had hidden the case at the quarry if it wasn't Ford's father. Ford didn't know, but refused to take the case after Rex offered it to him. He conveyed that whoever had hidden the case was connected to his father, so he didn't want anything to do with it. Rex walked out with the case, but left the card with Ford. Ford dialed the number of the shop on his phone, but didn't call it, and wondered why he would want to talk to that \"heartless bastard.\"\n\n\nInside the Palace, David spotted Dorian sitting alone at a table and sat down. He asked how the business meeting went, to which she replied, \"Better than you and Viki.\" After David remarked on Dorian being alone, she shot back that she was meeting \"her girls,\" and added that she didn't see anyone there with David. He said that he had dinner with his brother, not that Dorian would care. She didn't, and David replied that her only priority was getting Charlie away from Viki. David left as Dorian tried to defend herself against David's accusation.\n\n\nKelly and Langston entered the Palace and sat at Dorian's table. Langston was anxiously watching her phone to see if Ford was going to leave her a voicemail, and Kelly was text messaging. Dorian scolded her girls for not being able to give anything undivided attention. Kelly claimed to be multitasking, but Dorian accused her of texting Reed. Kelly explained that they had broken up, and Reed went back to London. David, eavesdropping, yelled that he remembered \"fleeing to London to escape a Cramer woman once.\" Ignoring him, Kelly went on to say that Reed helped her to find a clue to her mother's murder -- a piece of paper with a name on it -- by breaking her mother's vase.\n\n\nKelly asked Dorian if she knew the name Bennett Thompson, which Dorian didn't. David, still listening, called out that he didn't either. Kelly had been calling every Bennett Thompson that she could find a number for but with no answers. Dorian suggested that Kelly turn it over to John, but Kelly knew that John had a lot going on. David proposed that, since he was on the television show Supermodel Crime Club, he was qualified and could help Kelly. Dorian reminded him that he wasn't a detective and that he only \"played one on TV.\"\n\n\nDavid reminded Dorian that he had helped to find Adriana when Mitch had been after her. As Dorian and David argued about David's job situation, Langston and Kelly stealthily got up from the table and walked away. After David left, Langston returned and sat down, still anxiously checking her phone. Dorian wondered if she was just worried about Starr, but knew the truth -- that she was waiting for a text or call from Ford. Langston was done lying and admitted that she had gone to see Ford. She needed to know why he'd told her that he loved her. Dorian advised her that he was just a user and one needed to deny the existence of people like that.\n\n\nDorian's phone began to ring. She answered it and found out that she and Charlie had gotten the grant for their project. As Dorian was on the phone, Langston's phone began to ring as well. She saw that it was Ford and answered. Ford informed her that he had called before, but Langston knew and didn't answer because it was him. He wondered why she changed her mind, and she requested that Ford not call her anymore. Ford maintained that he had something important to tell her, but she told him that he didn't exist to her anymore and hung up.\n\n\nOn the terrace of the Palace, Todd was surprised to learn that Dani needed his help, but related that he would do anything.  Dani confessed that she needed fifty thousand dollars. Todd demanded to know why. Not wanting to reveal the reason, Dani said she shouldn't have asked him in the first place. Todd asked if she was in trouble or danger, but she made her father promise that he wouldn't call the police if she told him. Dani updated Todd about how she and Nate found the money and took it, but someone was threatening Nate to get the money back.\n\n\nDani knew that it was stupid to take the money, but Todd reassured that he, and most people, would have taken it as well. Dani explained how she and Nate had turned the cash into a check so easily by throwing Todd's name around. They had given it to Nate's mother and she still had the money. Todd thought that she could just get the check back from the woman, but Dani divulged that Nate and his mother would lose their house without the money.\n\n\nTodd wondered how that was his problem, but Dani said that she was just as guilty for taking the money, but she felt better about it because something good was being done with it. She related that seeing Nate be good to his mom made her want to treat her mother better too.\n\n\nTodd asked where Nate was, but a scared Dani only said that Nate called and said he needed the money. Then a man got on the phone and threatened to kill Nate if he didn't get his money back. As she began to say that she would take money out of her college account, Todd interrupted saying that he would give her the money, but there were conditions. Todd made her promise that she would be good to her mother, because T\u00e9a needed her daughter.\n\n\nIn Jessica's bedroom, Bree asked Brody if he could be her father. Jessica told Bree that she had a father in Heaven, and took her daughter to bed. As Brody looked at a picture of Jessica and Bree, Jessica returned and asked Brody what he thought about what Bree said. He asked her the same thing. She explained that Brody was always good with Bree, and Brody related that he wanted to be Bree's father someday and maybe even give her brothers or sisters. He wanted to have a family with Jessica and Bree and asked if Jessica did. \"More than anything,\" she replied, hugging Brody.\n\n\nLater, Brody got off the phone with John, and explained to Jessica that Hannah was being tracked down in Delaware. Brody thought that Ford brought out the worst out in people, especially with the way he treated women. A flustered Jessica didn't want to talk about Ford anymore. She kissed Brody just as Bree yelled for her mother.\n\n\nIn the cabana, Bull warned Nate that Dani had better come through with the money. Nate knew she would, but didn't want her to be mixed up in the mess because he was the one who had stolen it. Bull said he had it coming for taking something that didn't belong to him. As Bull pointed his gun at Nate, Nate explained how he had obsessively been checking the news for reports about lost money because he wanted to return it.\n\n\nAfter a while, Bull wondered why Dani hadn't called back yet. Nate pleaded with Bull to give Dani time, but Bull grabbed Nate around the throat and told him to lose his attitude. Suddenly, someone, whom Nate identified as the manager, knocked on the door of the cabana. Nate answered the door with a towel in his hand and claimed to have been folding towels. The manager said he thought he had heard voices, but Nate assured him he was just talking on the phone. Nate told his manager that he would be out soon and closed the door.\n\n\nAccording to Nate's phone, which began to ring, Dani was calling him. Bull rudely answers the phone, but was surprised when Todd replied. \"Who the hell is this?\" Bull demanded. \"Dani's father,\" Todd replied.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Viki gave Gigi a package that had been delivered to Llanfair by mistake. Gigi admitted that she had it sent there on purpose because she didn't want Rex or Shane to find it. Noticing the return address as Llanview University, Viki asked Gigi if she was applying to college. Gigi wanted to go because there was a lot to learn in the world, and if she learned it, she might not have to be a waitress for the rest of her life. However, Viki wanted to know why Gigi wanted to keep it a secret.\n\n\nGigi confessed that she didn't want anyone to know just in case she didn't get in. She explained to a confused Viki that she had barely finished high school, skipping classes and the SATs along the way. In addition, she didn't know if she had the money. Viki thought Gigi was just trying to think of reasons not to go, but urged her to fill out the application because she believed in Gigi.\n\n\nJust then, Gigi realized that Viki was supposed to be at her cabin with Charlie and wondered why she wasn't. Viki explained that Dorian always had other plans for Charlie. As Rex entered Rodi's with the metal briefcase, Gigi hid the Llanview University packet. Rex informed Gigi that Ford didn't want the case, so Rex needed \"a case to go with his case.\" Kelly, entering Rodi's, overheard Rex's comment and was interested.\n\n\nNonchalantly, Kelly sat down next to Viki at the bar. She explained that she needed a place to work away from Dorian's interruptions. Viki asked if it was work for Todd, but Kelly replied that she had gotten a lead on her mother's murder. She said she needed to access a program called Zip Tip, but it wasn't easy, and she was having trouble figuring it out. Rex volunteered that he had used it before and could help her as Kelly looked ecstatic.\n\n\nInside Starr's crashed car, Starr and James were both unconscious. James woke up, rubbing his neck. He noticed that Starr was unconscious and pleaded with her to wake up. She finally opened her eyes and asked what had happened. James explained to her about how an animal had run in front of the car and Starr had grabbed the wheel, which had run them off of the road. After bickering about whether or not it was right to brake for animals, they got out of the car to inspect it. Starr didn't find any scratches or dents, but James had bad news -- the front axle was broken in half, so the car wasn't worth anything anymore.\n\n\nStarr wondered what they were going to do, but James said it was his problem, and he had another plan. He would meet Bull like he was supposed to and go back to Ohio to work off his debt. Starr was horrified that he would go back to his abusive father to steal more cars, but James, who regretted getting Starr involved, had no other choice.\n\n\nThe two got back into the car to pass the night, so Starr called La Boulaie to say goodnight to Hope. Starr said goodnight and said she missed Hope, and sang \"Little Starr\" to her, a song that Blair used to sing to Starr. As she sang, James listened and sadly watched her. A sad-looking Ford tore up his father's business card. Bree jumped in bed between Jessica and Brody. Dorian and Langston left the Palace, and Dorian glared at David. Kelly and Rex shook hands. Gigi filled out her application for Llanview University as Viki looked on.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dani confides in Todd about the trouble that she and Nate are in after Tea has left them alone. Todd confronts Bull. Meanwhile, James and Starr have crashed the car that they need in order to get the $50,000 that he needs. And he assessed that the car's value is worth nothing. At that point, she wants to help him so that he does not have to go back to his abusive father in Ohio. Meanwhile, his big brother, Robert Ford is in the hospital calling Langston hoping to win her back. But she tells him they are through forever. Rex goes to talk to Robert Ford about the briefcase and his father's business card but doesn't get any information. Viki finds out from Gigi that she wants to go back to school and pursue career goals beyond being a waitress and finds out that Gigi is afraid to have Rex or Shane know that she is applying but not get accepted into schools. Dorian and David argue while he is friends with Viki and she is friends with Charlie.",
