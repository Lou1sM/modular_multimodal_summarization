James was not happy to see that Baz was staying in Llanview.\n\n\nDani looked on suspiciously from across the room as Deanna and Nate appeared engrossed with each other. Deanna revealed that she had received countless text messages from Rick, imploring her to star in his porn film or he'd have to tell the police how Matthew had been injured. Nate was sorry for having involved Deanna, but Deanna brushed his apology aside. Nate had given her a place to live after all, she said.\n\n\nJust then, Deanna received another text from Rick, and Nate wondered whether it might be \"prison or porn\" for him. He noted that it wouldn't be like they were really having sex, and it wouldn't mean anything. Dani had taken that moment to walk over and heard part of what Nate had said. \"You had sex with Deanna?\" she exclaimed. Nate assured her that it was only a joke, while Deanna stated that they had been playing a game. The two different answers infuriated Dani, and she walked away.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Destiny sat by Matthew's side and explained to the sleeping teen that they hadn't used protection when they'd had sex. \"I might be pregnant,\" she said as she played with the test kit. Bo arrived to check on his son, and he wondered how Destiny was holding up. He asked the girl if she minded staying with Matthew, because he wanted to look in on Clint.\n\n\nDestiny agreed without hesitation. \"Do you know how lucky we are to have you?\" the police commissioner asked. Destiny breathed a sigh of relief when Bo left, realizing that he hadn't heard what she'd said to Matthew. After awhile, Destiny kissed Matthew goodbye. She had promised Dani that she would go to the graduation party. She added that Nate had received his diploma, and she knew that Nate felt bad about Matthew's injury.\n\n\nNear Clint's room, Viki informed Natalie and Jessica that Rex had changed his mind about Gigi's heart going to Clint. Unfortunately, Rex had demanded all of Clint's money and belongings. The girls bickered over Rex's behavior, and Viki had to break them apart. Jessica pointed out that Clint had been right about Rex all along, and she wondered if Rex might be auctioning off additional body parts. Natalie tried to defend Rex's behavior.\n\n\nThe girls ripped into each other again, and Viki had to step in once more. Jessica accused Natalie of only caring about herself. Jessica stormed off, and Natalie ran into Bo's arms for comforting. Viki found Jessica, who confessed that she hated Brody and Natalie. Viki understood how horrible it must have been for Jessica to walk in on Natalie and Brody having sex, but Viki wanted Jessica to try to understand.\n\n\nViki explained that others had suffered as well, not just Jessica. Viki would understand it the most out of everyone, and Viki was aware of what other people went through when their loved one was taken over by another personality. Brody had stood by Jessica for a long time and during numerous incidents, Viki continued.\n\n\n\"That was big of him,\" Jessica said sarcastically. \"Actually it was,\" Viki replied. Brody had his own pain to go through in addition to that with Jessica. No one had meant to hurt Jessica, Viki concluded. Jessica confessed that Brody had accused her of hiding behind Tess and of intentionally allowing Tess to emerge. Viki informed Jessica that Brody didn't really understand the way it all worked, and that Jessica really had no control.\n\n\nJessica insisted that she'd returned for Brody, but it was all over between them. She couldn't forgive him for sleeping with Natalie a second time. Viki made it clear that Jessica had been gone, and everyone had assumed that Jessica had been gone forever. She believed that Jessica should not give up, and she should try to forgive Brody.\n\n\nNatalie updated Bo on Rex's demands of Clint, and Bo was surprised. He didn't think it sounded like Rex at all, and he offered to talk to Rex about it.\n\n\nLater, Natalie sat alone and watched as a doctor stopped to speak into a recorder. An alarm went off in her head, but she couldn't put her finger on it. She saw Viki and told her how worried she was about everyone. It seemed as though her world was falling apart around her. Natalie also explained that she'd been having weird dreams about being on the roof with Marty. She'd had flashes of the event, but she hadn't remembered much. Natalie knew that she and Marty had been arguing about the recorder.\n\n\nViki noted that Natalie and Brody really seemed to care about each other. Natalie clarified that while they were friends and parents, there had been an attraction. They cared about each other, but she wasn't certain that there was more to it than that. She and Brody hadn't been able to find the time to talk, Natalie explained. They had probably been avoiding it. Viki suggested that Natalie make time in order to get things out in the open and save her relationship with her sister either way.\n\n\nRex advised Shane that he had decided to allow Clint to receive Gigi's heart. Shane asked why his mother had to die while Clint got to live. \"It's complicated,\" Rex said. He attempted to explain to his son that Gigi had been an organ donor. Rex added that they didn't have much time left, and they had to say goodbye to Gigi. The pair went into Gigi's room.\n\n\nShane grabbed his mother's hand and told her what a great mom she'd been. He assured her that he'd never forget how she'd always told him how perfect he was. He noted that the house was empty without her, and he would miss her. He hooked his pinkie around hers and promised to continue writing and drawing. He planned on being an artist. \"And a good man,\" he added, before continuing, \"I love you so much, mom.\" He kissed her goodbye and turned to cry in Rex's arms.\n\n\nRex comforted his son outside of Gigi's room, and Bo found them standing there together. Rex asked to speak to Bo alone, and Shane walked over to the waiting area. Bo admitted that he'd heard about Rex's actions, but he wasn't there about that. \"How you doing, Balsom?\" Bo asked. Rex declared that he should have been married and watching his son grow up. He had to say goodbye instead.\n\n\nBo offered to stay with Shane while Rex visited with Gigi. Rex suggested that Shane use his inhaler, and when Shane dug into his things, he found the ring that Rex had obtained from Clint. Shane handed it to his father. Rex entered the room and wondered how to say goodbye. He advised Gigi that he had Clint's mother's ring, though he regretted that he hadn't bought Gigi a beautiful ring himself plus lots more.\n\n\nRex noted that people had always thought that he was funny, but he'd only wanted to hear Gigi's laughs. He slid the ring onto Gigi's finger. \"Better late than never,\" he muttered. \"About time, she says,\" Rex imagined Gigi might say. \"I, Rex Balsom, take you, Gigi Morasco, to have and to hold from this day forward,\" he began. Rex stated his marriage vows in full. He pictured Gigi saying her vows back as she placed a ring on his finger. They were happy, and they shared a kiss.\n\n\nBack to reality, and Rex kissed Gigi's hand. He told her that she was his wife, and it sounded really mature. He mentioned that he owed her a honeymoon, and he asked her to wait for him. He also wanted her to save a dance for him. In his mind, he saw himself slow dancing with Gigi. He promised to take care of Shane, and Gigi told him to take care of himself too. She wouldn't be there to watch over him, so she wanted him to talk to the people who surrounded him.\n\n\n\"Remember me. No tears,\" Gigi said. She loved Rex, and he and Shane were her life. Rex was her first, last, and true love. They hugged, and suddenly Bo was placing his hand on Rex's shoulder. \"It's time,\" Bo said softly. Rex declared his love for Gigi. \"Goodbye, Mrs. Balsom,\" he said solemnly and tearfully. He kissed her gently.\n\n\nAt the police station, Brody sat at a desk covered with bags of evidence that included all of Gigi's belongings found at the vacant house. He was determined to find something that might point to Jack. He picked up the bagged tape recorder and wondered why Gigi might have had that in her possession. Before he could listen to it, Ford walked in.\n\n\nFord wanted Brody's help with Tess and his son, but Brody assured him that he would never provide it. Jessica had been gone because of Ford, Brody retorted. Ford tried to reason with Brody, explaining that he had wanted to be a father and look after his son. Ryder needed him, Ford pleaded. Brody revealed that Jessica wouldn't talk to Brody.\n\n\nFord was happy and under the impression that Tess had returned, but Brody corrected him. Jessica had found Brody and Natalie in bed together, and she'd been hurt and angry. Ford accused Brody of giving up on Jessica, but Brody assured him that things weren't that simple. Jessica had made a vow to never let anyone take anything away from her again. Brody was certain that Tess would never reappear.\n\n\nFord was excited, though, because he believed that Tess would show herself again after seeing her Brody and Natalie in bed. Brody ordered Ford to leave Jessica alone in order for her to get better. He urged Ford to walk away. \"Now get out of here,\" Brody shouted. He went back to the table to play the recorder. He was interrupted again when the phone rang. He was surprised to hear Jessica on the other end.\n\n\nJessica filled Brody in on Clint's condition and the latest with the heart transplant. \"I just thought that you might want to know,\" Jessica maintained. Brody apologized for hurting Jessica, and he had realized that Jessica had no control over Tess. Jessica thought that maybe she really did, and she needed to take responsibility. Jessica had comprehended that things hadn't been easy for Brody, and while they'd both suffered from mental illness, he had gotten better.\n\n\nJessica wondered if Brody were sorry that he'd slept with Natalie again, but the deafening silence gave Jessica her answer. \"Oh, my God. You actually have feelings for her,\" she uttered. Jessica had nothing further to say.\n\n\nFord showed up at Capricorn and found James. Ford proclaimed that everything between Brody and Jessica appeared to be over, but he probably couldn't request that Tess return. Ford didn't want to hurt Jessica, especially because she had two children. James reminded his brother that one of the kids was Ford's, and he thought that Ford shouldn't take any advice that Brody might have given him.\n\n\nIt was a competition, and James thought that Ford should fight for what he wanted. Ford was worried about Ryder's custody, but James pointed out that Ford already didn't have his son so there was nothing to lose. He thought that Ford should do whatever it took.\n\n\nDani rushed over to Starr and told her about the conversation she'd heard between Deanna and Nate. Dani was certain that the couple had slept together, especially because Dani had kept Nate waiting for sex. Dani could tell that things had been different ever since Deanna had moved into Nate's apartment, and the couple always seemed to be sharing things between them. She wondered if it were a \"friends with benefits\" situation.\n\n\nStarr was sure that Nate loved Dani, and just as certain that Deanna still loved James. Dani agreed that Nate and Deanna had most likely not slept together, but something was going on.\n\n\nDestiny arrived and found Nate and Deanna. She exclaimed that she'd just left Mathew at the hospital. He'd opened his eyes and he'd talked, though he'd had difficulty with words. Matthew had remembered what had happened to him, and he'd mentioned Eddie. Matthew had grown frustrated, and he'd been sedated, but Destiny was sure he would talk soon enough. Then his father would be able to arrest whoever had caused the injury.\n\n\nDestiny walked away, and Nate realized that he would no longer have to worry about the porn movie, because Matthew would talk.\n\n\nJames had a song dedicated to Starr, and the couple took to the dance floor. Nate followed with Dani, though he continued to exchange glances with Deanna. Destiny pulled the test kit from her purse and looked at it.\n\n\nBo returned to Matthew's room and looked at a get-well card that had been signed with Rex's, Gigi's, and Shane's names.\n\n\nDressed in scrubs, Ford grabbed Jessica from behind, and placed a cloth over her mouth.\n\n\nNatalie showed up at the police station to see Brody.\n\n\nRex and Shane watched as Gigi was wheeled away.\n\n\n",
