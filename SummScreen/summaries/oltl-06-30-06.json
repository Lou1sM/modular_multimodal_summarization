She wonders aloud who it was that called them all there. Todd arrives and announces that he is the culprit. He just wanted to thank everyone for helping to save his life. David moves forward curious then as to why Spencer isn't there. Blair comes to Spencer's place using her key. She calls out for him but no one answers. She goes to his computer and starts snooping. He surprises her by coming up behind her, joking that he might think she were spying. She says she was looking for a site for something for Jack's schooling. She can't pony up the name for him and he tells her that he has been feeling funny about her lately. Blair gets a text message and leaves Spencer to go to the Country Club. She arrives and finds the Country Club full of people who all stare at her strangely. Todd calls out to everyone announcing that she is there. Spencer walks in behind her. \"And look! She brought a date!\" Blair too is surprised to find that Spencer has followed her to her destination. Todd thanks everyone, one by one for helping to free him from being killed by the state. He even offers to help David find his freedom for his part in all this. Lastly, he tells Spencer that he doesn't mind him fighting for Blair. He says that the man can have her, and that she is only the consolation prize. He only cares that Spencer never get his hands on his kids. Natalie has a moment to herself and she goes over to David and asks him to please tell John the truth about his father being killed. She knows that it won't hold up in court if he confesses now. David goes to John. \"Spencer had nothing to do with it. He didn't kill your father. It was me. I killed your father.\""
