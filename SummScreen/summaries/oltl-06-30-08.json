Tess dropped her coat and revealed that she was wearing a flashy, tight-fitted dress (one that Jessica would never be seen in). As she stared at Nash's dead body, Tess said that she fought hard to get back to him, but it was too late. Tess blamed Natalie and Jared for killing Nash and vowed to make them pay. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared returned to their apartment at the Angel Square Hotel with David Vickers, the dog. A picture of Natalie and Jessica during happier times caught Natalie's eye. Natalie wondered what Jess would do now that Nash was gone forever. She told Jared that Jess hated her and wondered if she was crazy to hope that Jess would forgive them in the future. Jared assured Natalie that she hadn't lost her sister forever. Natalie thought about how jealous she once was of Jess, but said she couldn't imagine life without her. \n\n\nViki arrived outside of Nash and Jessica's cottage and was disturbed when she spotted the latest edition of the Sun on the doorstep. The headlines read, \"Funeral Mayhem. Widow accuses sister and boyfriend of murdering husband.\" Inside, Tess was dressed in her sexy dress and danced to loud rock music. She laughed as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. Viki banged on the door and begged Jessica to let her in. Realizing Viki was at the door, Tess quickly covered herself with a robe and opened the door. Viki stared at her daughter. She felt something was off, but didn't know what. Citing that she was blowing of steam as her reason for the loud music, Tess attempted to convince Viki that she was fine. Viki said that she had come to take her daughter to the cemetery, but became alarmed when she noticed the shattered mirror on the wall. Tess made up an excuse and assured her mother that it was an accident. Wanting to believe that her daughter was fine, Viki urged her to get dressed and offered to clean up the mess. Viki promised her that there would be no press or unwanted guests at the reception. Tess told Viki that she wasn't worried about Natalie showing up. As Viki walked away, Tess remarked, \"You ain't seen nothing yet, mother!\" After getting dressed, Tess asked for a moment alone. When Viki left the cottage, Tess picked up a pair of scissors and stabbed a picture of Natalie. \n\n\nAt LaBoulaie, Langston and Starr watched as Addie happily fed David strawberries. While Langston purposely ignored David, Starr worried because she hadn't heard from Cole. Both David and Addie were suspicious when Dorian entered the room and was pleasant to David. When David asked what Dorian was up to, she smiled and stated that she was too busy to worry about their relationship. Dorian smiled as the doorbell chimed. She announced that Addie and David's wedding present had just arrived. Dorian introduced everyone to Madame Delphina, a world-renowned psychic. Dorian asked Madame to give David and Addie a reading regarding their future. David was certain that Dorian had paid her to give them a negative report. Although the psychic was able to describe David's underwear, he remained unconvinced. The psychic told the couple that their life would result in death and destruction, but then began to laugh hysterically. She confessed that Dorian had paid her off. Infuriated, Dorian demanded that Madame leave. She told Dorian that her pathway was blocked by someone who was at the door. Believing Madame was a fraud, David jokingly asked her who was at the door. Madame replied that David Vickers was on the other side of the door. Moments later, the doorbell chimed. Natalie and Jared entered the mansion carrying David Vickers, the dog. \n\n\nAssuming the dog belonged to David, Natalie and Jared suggested that he take the untrained dog off their hands. Surprised that the dog had a tag bearing his name, David wondered who would name their dog after him. Madame Delphina stated that the spirits told her that the dog belonged to a princess. Expressions of doubt crossed everyone's face and David began to ridicule the psychic. Upset by the fiasco, Dorian asked Madame Delphina, Natalie, and Jared to leave her home. An angered Natalie lashed out at Dorian and blamed her for causing the chain of events that resulted in Nash's death. When Dorian stated that it wasn't her idea to pass Jared off as Asa's long lost son, Madame Delphina began receiving a vision and took a seat. Everyone, particularly Natalie and Jared, was stunned when the psychic announced that Asa's long lost son was present in the room. In a fit of anger, Dorian demanded that Madame leave at once. Instantly, a spirit took over Madame Delphina's body. The spirit stated that he was Mel Hayes and asked how Dorian could live with herself considering all that she had done. A curious David questioned the spirit about Dorian's wrongdoings. The spirit of Mel demanded that Dorian confess if she wanted his forgiveness. A terrified Dorian grabbed Madame and screamed, \"Stop it, Mel!\" Madame Delphina came out of the trance and asked who Mel was. As Natalie and Jared left LaBoulaie, Jared was concerned about Madame's statement about Asa's heir, but Natalie was certain she was a fake. \n\n\nWhile Madame was still present, Starr and Langston returned to the living room. Langston approached the psychic and said that she had a question for her. Madame asked if her question was in regards to her parents. Both, Langston and Starr were surprised. The psychic told Langston that her parents were always with her and referred to her as \"Langzy.\" Langston revealed that her father called her by that name and that no one else was aware of that fact. Madame Delphina continued to tell Langston not to ever forget what her parents had said. When Langston tried to pry her for more information, Madame was vague and turned her attention to Starr. The psychic placed her hand on Starr's stomach and said that something was terribly wrong. A frightened Starr asked if there was something wrong with her baby. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Nora, Clint, and Matthew prepared to leave to attend Nash's burial. They were all surprised when Bo and Lindsay arrived and announced that they were getting married. While Matthew was elated, Nora nearly fell out of her chair after hearing the news. Nora inquired when the ceremony would take place, and Bo informed them that he wanted to get married immediately. When Nora and Lindsay exchanged a few cutting words, Bo exclaimed that there were no secrets between him and Lindsay-\"now or never.\" Lindsay nervously looked over at the file containing R.J.'s letter that was placed on a nearby table. Matthew was supportive of his father's choice and had many questions for him. Bo promised his son that they would have a ceremony with family and friends, and not elope. Nora was shocked when Matthew suggested that Bo and Lindsay get married at the mansion. Matthew reminded his mother that Asa's last words were that the family stick together. Sensing Nora's displeasure, Bo said that he didn't want to impose upon Nora. Cornered, Nora agreed to hold the ceremony at the mansion, and Bo and Lindsay happily accepted. Nora was beside herself when Bo announced that he wanted to have the ceremony immediately following Nash's burial. As everyone prepared to leave the room, Lindsay appeared nauseous. She stated that she was overwhelmed at the idea of getting married so soon. Lindsay asked if she could remain at the mansion while everyone attended the burial. She needed time to compose herself. Bo agreed and everyone left for the cemetery. Alone in the room, Lindsay retrieved R.J.'s letter and set it on fire. As the letter burned, Lindsay exclaimed, \"I feel so much better now!\" \n\n\nAt the loft, Antonio and Cris discussed how Jonas tricked Talia into helping him lure Sarah to the apartment. After hearing their discussion, Tina appeared and told the Vega brothers that she knew how to get the women back safely. She showed them the jewels and assured them that was all Jonas wanted. Jonas showed up at the loft, and Antonio greeted him by pointing a gun at him. Jonas laughed and said that his \"people\" were instructed to hurt the women if he didn't contact them within the next fifteen minutes. He also reminded them that he had full diplomatic immunity. Antonio withdrew his weapon and demanded to know where Talia and Sarah were. Tina told Jonas that she had the jewels and begged Jonas not to harm Sarah. Antonio said that he wouldn't pay any ransom until he saw Talia and Sarah. Jonas said that their request would be granted but they had to be patient. When Antonio demanded to be taken to the women immediately, Jonas asked if their passports were updated. Jonas informed Antonio and Cris that they would escort the princess on a chartered flight back to Mendorra. Once there, they would be taken into security and to the princess' palace and await further instruction. Jonas assured them that they would be reunited with the women and he would receive the jewels. With a devilish look, Jonas left the loft. Antonio told Cris and Tina that the situation concerned more than just the jewels. Tina was certain that all Jonas wanted was the jewels. Antonio questioned why the exchange needed to take place in Mendorra. \n\n\nAt the cemetery, Tess looked distraught as everyone said a prayer for Nash. After the service was over, Tess asked for a few moments alone with Nash. Alone, Tess climbed on top of Nash's casket. She said that he shouldn't be the one placed into the ground, Natalie and Jared should. Tess swore that Natalie and Jared would regret taking Nash from her. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared returned to their apartment and discussed the circumstances that led up to Nash's death. Jared felt he was to blame because he wanted revenge on Tess. As Jared continued to accept blame, there was a knock at the door. Natalie and Jared were startled to find Jessica standing there, or so they thought. \n\n\nBack at the mansion, Lindsay was in good spirits when everyone returned form the cemetery. Lindsay declared that she had to begin planning her wedding and ushered Bo out of the room. Clint asked Nora how she felt about throwing Lindsay's wedding at the mansion. Nora stated that she had to be okay for Matthew's sake. When Nora questioned how Clint was feeling, he said that he would have to fight Dorian all on his own because Bo would be on his honeymoon. Nora suggested that he take the paperwork and handed him the files on the table. Clint asked if Nora still needed the paperwork for her own purposes. She informed him that she had made duplicate copies of every piece of paperwork.\n\n\n",

Natalie and Jared bring David Vickers, the dog to Dorian's, assuming that he belongs with David wherever he is living. Dorian has invited a fortune teller to persuade Addie and David to believe they made a mistake getting married. But the fortune teller does not cooperate and reveals that it's Dorian who has done wrong.
