Rachel wondered who had inspired Matthew's phenomenal performance at the community center.  Matthew credited Destiny.\n\n\n\n\nIn the restaurant, Destiny and Shaun sat at a table, waiting for Greg to arrive.  When Rachel and Matthew approached the table, Rachel pulled Shaun aside for a moment.  Destiny took the opportunity to apologize to Matthew for Greg's misunderstanding.  She promised that she had not told Greg that Matthew was her boyfriend.  Matthew assured Destiny that he had straightened everything out; Greg knew that Destiny and Matthew were not dating.  Destiny quickly hid her disappointment.  When Rachel and Shaun returned to the table, Shaun announced that Rachel and Matthew would join them for dinner.\n\n\nA short time later, Shaun decided to call Greg to find out where he was.  Greg apologized for not making it to dinner and asked Shaun to relay his regrets to Destiny.  Shaun refused to be the one to disappoint his sister.  He insisted that Greg do his own dirty work and then handed the phone to Destiny.  Greg explained to Destiny that he was consulting with another doctor on Matthew's case.  Greg insisted that he needed to focus on Matthew if he was going to help the young man to walk again.  Destiny accepted Greg's excuse.  Before Greg ended the call, he invited Destiny to charge her dinner to his room.\n\n\nAfter dinner, Shaun offered to drop Destiny and Matthew off at home, so that afterwards he and Rachel could go listen to some music.  Matthew and Destiny wanted dessert, so they weren't ready to leave the Palace Hotel.  Rachel arranged for Nigel to pick the kids up when they were ready to go home.  A short time later, Destiny and Matthew were served a disappointing gourmet banana split, so Matthew went to the kitchen to fetch a huge bowl of ice cream with the works.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Bo was visibly uncomfortable when he spied Nora and Clint kissing at the bar.  Eventually, Clint and Nora spotted him, so Bo was forced to join them.  Moments later, they noticed Greg walk in with a beautiful woman.  Greg approached the Buchanans and introduced his date, Dr. Wright.  Greg explained that the lovely doctor was consulting on Matthew's case.  \n\n\n\n\nNora and Clint asked if Greg had any new information about Matthew's condition.  Greg explained that he had not received all of the test results back yet.  He promised to update them as soon as possible and then led his date to a private table.  Bo admitted that he had reservations about Matthew's new doctor.  According to Bo, Greg seemed like a bit of a showman.\n\n\nBo mentioned Matthew's performance at the community center to Clint.  When Bo and Nora bragged about how well Matthew had done, Clint suggested that Matthew perform at their wedding.  Bo wondered if Clint might be a bit uncomfortable standing next to Viki during the double wedding.  Clint answered by asking Bo if he would feel uncomfortable standing next to Nora.  Clint chuckled at the look of confusion Bo gave him.  Clint explained that he had asked the question because he wanted Bo to be his best man.  Bo's smile was strained as he reluctantly agreed to stand up for his brother at Clint's wedding.  Shortly afterwards, Bo tried to leave.  However, when Clint and Nora started to join him, Bo offered to stay behind to pay the tab.\n\n\nShaun and Rachel walked into Capricorn.  Shaun's good mood fled when he spotted his brother romancing a woman at a nearby table.  Shaun approached Greg and asked him, \"Is this why you dumped our little sister?\"\n\n\nAt Roxy's salon, Roxy faced down Gayle, the nurse from the clinic where John Doe had been a patient.  Gayle had a syringe, which she threatened to inject Roxy with, if she didn't turn over the bag of blood to Gayle.  Roxy was uncooperative, so Gayle distracted Roxy by claiming that someone was at the front door.  When Roxy turned to see who was there, Gayle injected Roxy with the needle.  Moments later, Roxy collapsed to the ground.  Gayle stood over Roxy's body and revealed that her employer was John Doe.\n\n\nAt the clinic, Jared, Natalie, and Kyle made a startling discovery.  Renee was the patient in room 302.  According to Renee, she had received minor cosmetic surgery.  Renee claimed that she was ready to be discharged, so she climbed out of bed and got dressed.  Later, Renee asked Jared and Natalie to keep her surgery a secret.  Natalie was reluctant to agree, but Jared managed to change her mind.\n\n\nJared questioned a nurse about the patient who had been in room 302 prior to Renee's admission.  The nurse explained that the information was confidential; however, she did volunteer that the person had died.  Jared and Natalie were furious.  After Renee and the nurse left, they told Kyle that their deal was off because he had failed to live up to his end of the bargain.  Kyle scrambled to appease Natalie and Jared.  He told them that Roxy had ordered him to get a second bag of blood from John Doe, in the event that Shane needed another stem cell donation.  Natalie was livid when she realized that Roxy had lied to her.\n\n\nJared, Natalie, and Kyle went to Roxy's salon.  When they found Roxy on the ground, unconscious, Kyle rushed to check Roxy for any vital signs.  Kyle determined that Roxy was alive.  Seconds later, Roxy began to wake up.  Natalie fired questions at Roxy, but Roxy pretended that her mind was too fuzzy to recall anything with accuracy.  Natalie made Roxy an offer; if Roxy turned over the bag of blood then Natalie would forgive her mother for everything.  Roxy revealed that the bag of blood was gone.  Frustrated, Natalie and Jared left.\n\n\n\n\nBack at the clinic, Renee settled into a hospital bed while she thanked the nurse for her help with Natalie and Jared.  Renee didn't want anyone to know why she was at the clinic.  The nurse assured Renee that her secret was safe.  Renee asked about the patient Natalie and Jared had asked about.  The nurse told Renee that the patient was gone.  Renee asked if the nurse had meant gone as in dead.  The nurse replied, \"According to the paperwork.\"\n\n\nAt the loft, Stacy set the table for a romantic dinner.  A knock at the door heralded the arrival of a deliveryman from Chef To Go.  He had the gourmet dinner that Stacy had ordered.  While Stacy relieved him of the bag of food, the deliveryman asked Stacy how the Chicken Parmesan dinner had been.  Stacy hustled the man out the door, claiming that she didn't want her father to see him.\n\n\nAlone, Stacy reminisced about making love to Rex.  Stacy smiled with confidence as she reminded herself that she had Rex.  Stacy's euphoria was short-lived.  Shane arrived a short time later and startled Stacy as he walked into the loft.  Stacy snapped at Shane, but quickly changed her tone when Moe appeared in the doorway.  Moe quickly figured out what was going on when his keen eyes took in the romantic setting and Stacy's sexy black dress.  Moe suggested that Shane retrieve his rain gear for the ballgame that they were attending.\n\n\nAs soon as Shane was out of the room, Moe lifted the covered dishes on the table and began asking questions about how Stacy had prepared the meal.  Moe's suspicions were quickly confirmed and he correctly guessed where the food had come from.  He suggested that Stacy order dessert to help cover up the bitterness of her lies. Moe warned Stacy that her efforts would fail because Rex would never stop loving Gigi.  As soon as Shane returned, wearing a rain poncho, Moe and Shane left.  Stacy picked up the phone to order dessert for the dinner.\n\n\nLater, Stacy answered the door.  Seeing a woman holding a paper bag, Stacy assumed she was from Chef To Go.  She wasn't; it was Gayle.  Gayle stopped Stacy when she went to fetch money for the delivery.  Stacy cringed when she realized that there was a bag of blood in the paper bag that Gayle held.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi was thrilled when Rex revealed that he believed her claims about Stacy.  Rex explained that he had been harsh on Gigi earlier in an effort to keep Stacy in the dark.  Rex was determined to find out the name of Shane's donor.  Gigi was eager to call Shane with the good news, but Rex cautioned Gigi against moving too fast.  He reminded Gigi that they needed information from Stacy first.  Rex wanted Stacy to believe that she had won.\n\n\nGigi admitted that Natalie and Jared were aware of the situation.  Rex confided that he wished that Gigi had told him the truth sooner than she had.  Gigi confessed that she had feared that Stacy might have seduced Rex.  She was greatly relieved that Rex hadn't succumbed to Stacy's machinations.  Rex assured Gigi that he loved her, but it was clear he was also plagued with guilt.  He made several attempts to tell Gigi that he had slept with Stacy, to no avail.  Gigi continually interrupted Rex, misunderstood what he had said, or was too busy celebrating the fact that Stacy hadn't been victorious.\n\n\nRex was on the verge of making another attempt to tell Gigi about his romp with Stacy when a knock at the door sent Gigi running to answer it.  It was Natalie and Jared.  Gigi happily announced that Rex knew the truth about Stacy's stem cell switch.  Natalie and Jared filled them in on what had happened at the clinic and then later at Roxy's salon.  Rex and Gigi were determined to track the bag of life-saving blood.\n\n\n",

Yet, Kyle, Natalie and Jared go to the hospital and find out he died. They still haven't a clue who he is. Only Roxy knows. A nurse from the hospital knocks Roxy out and takes the spare bag of blood with Shane's stem cells that Kyle has gotten for her. And the woman brings it to Stacy.",
