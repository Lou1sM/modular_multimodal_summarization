As he launched into his push-up routine, Blair entered the room and planted her stiletto heel on his chest.  \"You want to hold my ankles?\" Ford purred.\n\n\nBlair said she wasn't there to spot him during his workout, but was impressed with his swift recovery.  Ford told her that he was being released the following day, and was eager to get back into shape.  \"You are a shrunken little man,\" Blair assented, and explained that she was there to make sure he honored her and Dorian's shared wish - that he stayed away from Langston.\n\n\nBlair knew about Ford and Langston's recent confrontation, and Ford protested that the girl had visited him of her own accord, but Blair wasn't interested in the particulars; she only wanted his assurance that he wouldn't go near Langston again, or attempt to restart his relationship with her.  \"Or what?\" Ford asked, \"You'll take my head off?\"  \"Think lower,\" Blair replied, eyeing him up and down.\n\n\nFord was surprised Blair was focused so \"below the belt,\" and promised her a good time if she indulged herself with him: \"It'll be the ride of your life!\"  Blair was disgusted, and told him to steer clear of her and Langston, but Ford again asked why he needed to do as she said.  Blair produced the latest edition of the Sun, with a headline all about Hannah's attack and flight from justice; she warned Ford that with Hannah still on the loose and all the women of Llanview knowing of his womanizing ways, he was an endangered species.  As Ford stared at the headline, Blair told him that Hannah was nothing compared to the wrath of the Cramer women, and ordered him to stay away.  After Blair stormed out, Ford leaned against the wall, lost in thought.\n\n\nIn Delaware, John arrived at the O'Connor family cabin with local Police Chief Lynch, ready to inspect it for signs of Cole and Hannah.  John thanked Chief Lynch for his cooperation, and said he needed all the help he could get to find the wayward youngsters.  To that end, he ushered Natalie, decked out in a Llanview Police Department uniform, into the cabin.\n\n\nAs Natalie began to comb the house with her forensic tools, John and Chief Lynch searched the living room.  Lynch had a hard time believing that Hannah, the girl he'd watched grow up, was capable of administering a violent beating or endangering Cole, and John explained Hannah's history with both Ford and Cole, and why he was positive the kids were together.  Upon hearing about Ford and Hannah's tortured relationship, Lynch suspected that Ford was the type who made many enemies.\n\n\nExamining the dresser, John discovered a cell phone battery hidden in one of the drawers.  When Natalie named the model and make, John recognized it as the battery for Cole's type of phone.  Natalie noted the battery's serial number and began to run an Internet trace on it using her laptop.  She told John they could track it back to the service provider to determine whether or not it belonged to Cole's phone, but John realized that would only take more precious time.\n\n\nAfter Chief Lynch left to check in with his men, John and Natalie continued to examine the cabin with a fine-toothed comb.  They sympathized with Lynch's unease over investigating a girl he knew well, and Natalie admitted she'd never thought Cole capable of becoming a fugitive from the law.  John recounted how Todd had always been a wedge issue for Starr and Cole, and Natalie concluded that Hannah had used Todd to break the teens apart.\n\n\nNatalie snagged a strand of brunette hair on the couch and bagged it, while John discovered the condom wrapper on the ground, and handed it over to her.  Lifting a print off the wrapper, Natalie ran the fingerprint through her computer's database and got a match for Cole; she concluded that perhaps he and Hannah had had sex, but John couldn't believe that Cole would behave so rashly with another girl.\n\n\nJust then, Chief Lynch returned and told the duo that Hannah's car had been found at a nearby bus station.  As John investigated over the phone, he learned that a bus driver had provided a positive ID for Cole and Hannah heading for Aberdeen, Maryland.  Seizing the moment, John and Natalie raced out to continue following the trail.\n\n\nIn a motel in Aberdeen, Maryland, Cristian and Layla finished a bout of early-morning lovemaking.  Layla wondered if they'd woken the neighbors, and Cristian teased her about their going for another round, which Layla readily agreed to as Cristian pounced on her.\n\n\nAcross the hall, a frazzled Cole and Hannah listened in on their neighbors' sexual Olympics through the thin walls.  Hannah wanted to think through their next move, but Cole had already decided on his - he was returning to Llanview, to Starr and Hope.  He was sure Starr and James had to head back, and Hope needed him.  He figured if he returned immediately, no one would ever know he'd left.\n\n\nBack in Cris and Layla's room, the couple finished their lovemaking, and Cristian headed for the shower, eager to get back on the road so they could reach the Williamson homestead in Silver Spring.  Layla was less enthused, and suggested they wait a few hours, as her mother considered herself Evangeline's advocate and was unlikely to want them as lunch guests once she learned about their engagement.  Cristian reminded her that she had nothing to be ashamed of, even if Mrs. Williamson had put Evangeline first; Layla had a right to her happiness, and he felt Evangeline would approve of their love.  Cristian's words bolstered Layla's spirits, and she pulled him back onto the bed.\n\n\nAfter Cristian finished his shower, he let Layla into the bathroom and told her he was heading down the hall to grab some breakfast before they checked out.  He asked her if she'd be there when he returned, and Layla reminded him that their road trip was her idea.\n\n\nAcross the hall, Hannah struggled to dissuade Cole from his course of action, but he wouldn't be moved.  He told her he needed to charge his phone and check his messages in the motel lobby.  Hannah was fearful of his leaving the motel room, but Cole reminded her he'd be just down the hall, and left.\n\n\nIn the hallway, Cole ran into Cristian, who was surprised to see him.  Making small talk, Cristian mentioned he'd never been to Aberdeen before, and a tense Cole said he hadn't either.  Cole congratulated Cris and Layla on their engagement, and Cris explained that they were in for trouble with Layla's mother in Silver Spring.  Before he could delve further into the complicated story, Cris congratulated Cole on making bail, then realized that Cole wasn't supposed to be out of Pennsylvania.  \"You jumped bail, didn't you?\" Cristian asked the teen.\n\n\nCole admitted he'd fled the jurisdiction, but said he'd only left Llanview to search for Starr, who he feared was in trouble.  He begged for Cristian's help, and said he was heading back to town.  Cristian said he'd never seen Cole, and Cole thanked him for his understanding.\n\n\nIn Cole and Hannah's room, Hannah picked up Cole's discarded shirt and smelled it, flashing back to their makeout session in Delaware.  She smiled at the memory.\n\n\nIn Cristian and Layla's room, Layla stared at a picture of herself and Evangeline in happier times, but an unwelcome call from Ford roused her from her reverie.  Ford demanded to know how Hannah was still on the loose, but Layla informed him she wasn't at the police station, or even in Llanview, and had no interest in helping him any further.  \"You're one of the skeeviest manwhores I've ever met, Ford,\" she explained, \"and I lived in L.A.!\"  Ford pleaded with her to help him get an update on Hannah's case, but Layla told him to handle it himself, and warned him that if he weren't out of the apartment by the time she returned, she would burn his things.\n\n\nAfter Layla hung up, Cristian returned and told her the food in the lobby had looked stale.  Layla told him about Ford's call, and that Ford had identified Hannah as his attacker.  As she explained Hannah's history with Ford, Layla recalled the girl visiting Cole every day in jail, and told Cristian that Hannah hadn't seemed strong enough to assault Ford so violently.  Cristian grew concerned as Layla told him that Hannah had clearly had a thing for both Ford and Cole.  Swearing her to secrecy, he told Layla that Cole was in Aberdeen with them as they spoke, in the motel.\n\n\nLayla wanted to go to John and the Llanview police, but Cristian feared getting Cole in worse trouble - Cole had told him he was looking for Starr, and he didn't want the young man to be in danger from both Hannah and the cops.  He figured Cole had already checked out, and Layla suggested they attempt to pick up Cole's trail in order to help the teen out.  Cristian accused her of wanting to avoid the visit to her mother, and said that Cole was gone and the situation was out of their hands.\n\n\nIn Cole and Hannah's room, Cole returned with the motel manager's charger to charge his phone and check his messages.  As soon as he plugged the phone in, however, he discovered he was still getting no power, and opened the phone up to find his battery missing.  Looking to Hannah, he asked her if she'd removed the battery from his phone.  \"Do you think I would ever do anything to hurt you?\" Hannah asked him.  \"That's not an answer,\" Cole countered.\n\n\nHannah told him he shouldn't be using his phone at all, and suggested that it was a sign that he shouldn't head back to Llanview so soon, but Cole demanded she hand over her purse.  Over Hannah's protests he took the bag and began rifling through it.  Almost swayed by her pleas of innocence, Cole paused, then froze as he discovered something in the bag.  Reminding Hannah that she'd claimed to have lost her phone in Delaware, he pulled it out of her purse.  \"What the hell is this?\" he asked.\n\n\nHannah pretended she'd lost her phone at the bottom of her bag and assumed it had gone missing, but refused to let Cole use it to call his voicemail.  She admitted that she'd taken the battery out of his phone for the same reason, and Cole concluded that she'd lied to him about her phone after all.  As Cole hammered her with questions, Hannah weakened, and told him to let her explain after he listened to his phone messages.  She told him that the police weren't after him - they were after her, \"for trying to kill Ford.\"\n\n\nCole was floored as Hannah told him the Llanview police believed she'd assaulted Ford.  Hannah looked to him for reassurance, but Cole's mind was reeling.  \"Is it true?\" he asked her.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, at the country club, Nate awoke in Cabana #2, still at Bull's not-so-tender mercy.  Nate asked what was going on, and Bull explained that he was doing a \"trade-in\" for the boy, with a full cash refund.  \"Manning better come through, or you're dead,\" Bull snarled.  Nate assured him that Todd would cooperate, but Bull wasn't convinced; he knew Todd's reputation, and figured he had a 50/50 chance of being burned in the deal.  Nate asked what Bull would do if he didn't get what he wanted, and Bull warned that the teen didn't want to know.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, T\u00e9a ran into Elijah in the main dining room.  Elijah inquired about her health, and T\u00e9a realized he was yet another person who knew about her illness.  T\u00e9a was livid that Blair had spilled her secret once more, but Elijah assured her that as a lawyer, he kept secrets for a living.\n\n\nElijah asked if Todd knew the truth, and T\u00e9a explained that Todd had stepped up and was a capable caregiver.  Elijah promised to be there for her and Danielle, as well, and reminded T\u00e9a that he still considered her family, and Danielle his niece.  Heading out, he told T\u00e9a to call if she needed him.\n\n\nOn the patio, Danielle paced as she and Todd played the waiting game with Bull.  Danielle wanted to call Bull back immediately, but Todd told her to relax; he'd dealt with the criminal element before, and he knew how to handle a kidnapping negotiation.  Danielle accused him of antagonizing Bull with his wild behavior, but Todd told her that kidnappers were a lower class of people and needed to be treated as such.  He told her she'd been right to go to him with her problem, and assured her that he had it well in hand.  As T\u00e9a approached the patio, Todd told Danielle that he knew she was scared, but he was with her, and they'd face her nightmare together as Mannings.\n\n\nHearing Todd's words, T\u00e9a assumed that he'd told Danielle about her tumor and rushed over to father and daughter, furious.  \"How could you?\" she screamed at Todd over and over, as he struggled to calm her down.  Danielle was puzzled by her mother's behavior, and even more baffled when Todd told T\u00e9a he was helping Danielle with a personal problem.  T\u00e9a relaxed and struggled to cover for her histrionics, lamely telling Danielle that she'd thought Todd was giving the girl a hard time.\n\n\nJust then, Todd's phone rang, and he excused himself, heading inside the dining room to take Bull's call.  After Todd left, T\u00e9a asked Danielle what was troubling her.  Danielle was cryptic and said that Todd was helping her out, but refused to elaborate and said it was nothing of importance.  T\u00e9a insisted that she was Danielle's mother, and Danielle could tell her anything.  Danielle weakened, and blurted out, \"It's Nate!\"\n\n\nIn the dining room, Todd told Bull he had the fifty thousand, but Bull declared that the price for Nate's life had gone up, and it was time for him to add some zeroes: \"Five hundred thousand to keep the pretty boy pretty.\"  Todd warned Bull not to get greedy, but Bull stood firm.  Todd asked to speak to Nate, and Bull let Nate speak to Todd briefly before snatching the phone back.  He said Todd had an hour to meet him in Cabana #2 at the country club, and hung up over Todd's protests.\n\n\nBefore Danielle could explain the situation with Nate to her mother, Todd returned to the patio and asked to speak to Danielle alone, and suggested that T\u00e9a busy herself by working on his case.  Chagrined, T\u00e9a reluctantly headed for the bar.  Alone again, Todd told Danielle that he'd spoken to Bull and was ready to make the exchange.  Danielle wanted to go with him to the country club, but Todd told her she was staying there, where she was safe and could spend much-needed time with her mother.  Before Todd left, Danielle thanked him for his help.\n\n\nWith Todd gone, T\u00e9a returned to the patio and rejoined Danielle, still curious about the trouble with Nate.  Danielle changed the subject, and asked what was going on with T\u00e9a and Todd.  She didn't understand her mother's outburst before, and said that T\u00e9a looked pale and unwell.  Danielle asked T\u00e9a what was wrong with her, and what she'd really thought Todd and Danielle were speaking about.\n\n\nAt the country club, Elijah reclined on a beach chair, reading the Sun headline about Hannah.  Blair pranced into the club and told her beau not to read a paper full of bad news on such a beautiful day.  Cuddling up to him, she asked if he was free, and Elijah said he'd just finished his work for the day and had sent investigators to search for Cole.  Blair said she'd finished her business, as well, after delivering a warning to Ford at the hospital.  \"You saw Robert Ford?\" Elijah asked, turning serious.\n\n\nBlair told Elijah she'd visited Ford to warn him to keep away from Langston and the Cramer women, and Elijah told her to stay away from Ford as well; he was a sleazeball, and most of what Todd had printed about him was true.  Climbing into Elijah's lap, Blair teased him about Ford's \"hot abs,\" and Elijah leaped to his feet in mock-protest. \"You want hot abs?\" he asked her as he raced through the club with her in his arms. \"Then you better call a vet, because these puppies are sick!\"\n\n\nElijah and Blair raced over to Cabana #2 to continue their amorous adventures, but found it locked.  Inside the cabana, Bull sprang into action, hiding behind the door as Elijah fumbled for the key.  When Blair and Elijah entered the cabana, they were surprised to find Bull and Nate already inside.\n\n\nConcerned by the strange atmosphere, Elijah apologized for interrupting, and asked Bull what was going on.  Blair recognized Nate as Danielle's friend, and Bull swiftly introduced himself as Nate's father, \"Bill Salinger.\"  Blair recalled seeing him at Starr's graduation, and Bull told her and Elijah that he was visiting the club to spend a day with his \"son.\"  Unnerved, Elijah apologized for interrupting Nate and Bull's \"father and son\" excursion, and ushered Blair out to find another cabana.\n\n\nOutside, Blair and Elijah were both weirded out by their encounter with \"the Salingers,\" but quickly put it out of their minds as Blair warned Elijah to find another cabana, fast.  \"I'm on it!\" Elijah declared, rushing off.\n\n\nInside Cabana #2, Bull grew agitated; he feared that Blair would look into things and discover that \"Bill Salinger\" didn't exist.  Nate said he barely knew Blair, but Bull was convinced time was running out, and that he needed to cut his losses.  Turning his gun on Nate, he told the boy he was going to do what he should've done when he'd first found him.\n\n\nNearby, Blair lounged in the sun while awaiting Elijah's return, only to see Todd passing by.  She asked Todd what had made him crawl out of his cave, but Todd ignored her and headed for the cabana area.  \"Jerk,\" Blair sniffed.\n\n\nTodd approached Cabana #2, banged on the door, and demanded that Bull open up.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Ford opened the anonymous note he'd received, re-reading it.  \"You weren't supposed to live,\" the note read. \"It doesn't matter.  I'm in charge now.  Now we need to make this work for both of us.  If you don't do exactly what I tell you to do, I'll come back and finish the job.  Follow my instructions to the letter.  I'll be watching every move you make.\"\n\n\nJust then, his phone rang, and Ford picked it up.  He was visibly frightened as he realized he was speaking to the author of the note, and told the person on the other end of the line that he'd done as he was ordered and wanted to be left alone and not called again.  Ford asked the caller if they'd seen the Sun, and said he'd sold the cover story - that Hannah had been his attacker, \"even though we both know it's a lie!\" \n\n\n",
