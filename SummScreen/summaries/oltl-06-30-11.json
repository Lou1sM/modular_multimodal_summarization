    "soap_central": "\n\nDani and Baz arrived in front of Dani's house, but Baz didn't want to go in. Dani knew that he didn't want to deal with Tomas. Baz didn't even want to talk about Tomas; he wanted to talk about Starr. He wondered why she'd left Capricorn so early. Dani explained that Starr probably had to get back to her daughter, Hope.\n\n\nA surprised Baz had thought that Starr and James hadn't yet slept together. Dani said that James wasn't the father, and wondered how Baz knew the information. He admitted to eavesdropping on a phone conversation of Starr's. Dani warned Baz not to \"get any ideas,\" because Starr was with James.\n\n\nT\u00e9a paced around the living room. She picked up her and Todd's wedding picture and threw it across the room, shattering the frame. Tomas entered the room, startled by the noise. He asked if she was angry about Baz, but she didn't know who that was. She was angry at \"Todd. Who else?\" She explained that they'd had a disagreement about parenting, and admitted that it had been about Jack. He remembered that Blair had been concerned about Jack, but T\u00e9a couldn't discuss it because of confidentiality.\n\n\nTomas knew that T\u00e9a was a great mother, and mentioned that she'd make a great aunt as well. Tomas explained to his sister about Baz. She was surprised, but advised her brother to give Baz time. It had taken Dani time, but she loved Todd. He related that Baz had agreed to live in Llanview in order to work on his music, but he was stubborn, and \"a handful.\"\n\n\nTomas hoped it would be all right for Baz to stay with them. T\u00e9a insisted that it was, because Baz was family. Tomas thought that Todd might object, but T\u00e9a refused to let him. She reasoned that Todd only objected to guys that were seen as \"threats\" to his daughters. Dani and Baz entered, so Tomas introduced Baz to T\u00e9a. He recognized his aunt as \"the sister you abandoned,\" and hadn't cared about for years. T\u00e9a explained that they were working through things. T\u00e9a was looking forward to getting to know her nephew. Baz rudely excused himself, and Dani followed.\n\n\nTomas wondered if he should go after Baz, but T\u00e9a urged Tomas to give Baz time to settle. Tomas made sure that his sister would be all right. She wished Todd would return home so they could \"have it out.\" She related that, when he got angry, his misplaced anger had to go somewhere. She feared the trouble that Todd might get into.\n\n\nTodd arrived at Capricorn and demanded to see Blair. The bartender informed Todd that Blair wasn't there, so he ordered a drink. He recognized Vimal sitting at the bar, so Todd sat down right next to him. The two men caught up, and Vimal told Todd about all of Rama's lies. Todd knew that people would do all kinds of things for money, including him, but T\u00e9a didn't agree with it.\n\n\nVimal related that Rama had dashed all of his hopes and dreams. He wished for a son, but Todd warned Vimal to be careful what he wished for. \"Sons don't stay innocent forever,\" he advised. He continued that he was at Capricorn to tell Jack's mother that Jack was all right. Vimal had ended up at Capricorn to look for Cristian. He'd wanted to confront Cristian about how he'd tried to seduce Rama, but Vimal wondered if the attraction had ever been one-sided at all.\n\n\nTodd warned Vimal not to trust Rama with Cristian. Vimal stated that Cristian could have Rama, because Cristian would only leave Rama for another man's wife anyway. Todd thought that Vimal and Rama would make up and get back together, but Vimal refused. He hoped that Rama got \"reincarnated as a mosquito on the hide of a buffalo.\"\n\n\nVimal wondered if Todd and T\u00e9a would work things out. Todd was confident that T\u00e9a would eventually cool down, and see that he was right. Todd was convinced that he'd done what any good father would have done. The two toasted \"to not worrying.\" However, Vimal was distressed about what he would tell his parents, who were on their way to meet their grandchild. He related that Rama made him angry, and he attempted to crush a shot glass. Todd stopped him, and advised him, \"Don't get mad. Get even.\"\n\n\nVimal asked if Todd was going to take revenge on T\u00e9a. Todd clarified that he was going to get revenge on John. Todd explained that John had been after him for years, but had crossed the line by going after Jack. Todd confided that John had a son that he knew nothing about.\n\n\nRama entered the steam room at the gym to find Cristian. She wanted to explain the reasoning behind all of her lies. As a skeptical Cristian listened, she apologized for lying. She continued that his support had meant a lot to her, and that she'd never meant to hurt him. She hadn't wanted to admit the entire story to him, because she hadn't wanted him to see her as a \"selfish, horrible, greedy person,\" and especially because she had feelings for him. She knew that their kiss had meant something.\n\n\nCristian told Rama that he'd gone to the steam room to be alone. Taking the hint, she got up. She sincerely hoped that he could accept her apology, because she valued his friendship. \"Maybe in another life,\" she suggested, and left.\n\n\nNatalie entered the evidence room at the police station as Brody was going through the evidence from Gigi's accident. She'd been going crazy at the hospital and had needed to get out. Brody said that Jessica had called him about Clint's transplant. He told her that Jessica had asked him if he was sorry that he'd slept with Natalie. Natalie was happy that Brody and Jessica were going to get back together. However, Brody admitted that he hadn't said he was sorry about it, because he wasn't.\n\n\nBrody continued that Natalie meant something to him, so things couldn't just go back to normal. He thought that too many things were different, including the way he felt about Natalie. Natalie thought that they couldn't be in a relationship. Brody wondered why they should worry about hurting the people who'd hurt them so much. Brody wanted to try being a family with her and Liam. If she didn't want to, he would understand, and would promise not to mention it again. Suddenly, Natalie kissed him.\n\n\nBrody wondered what the kiss meant. Natalie explained that something was happening between the two of them, and she didn't want to run from it. Brody added that Liam deserved a family, with parents who cared about each other. He warned that many people would judge them. \"This isn't my first rodeo,\" she reminded him. She added that Jessica already hated her, and John had no right to object.\n\n\nBrody knew things could get awkward since he and Natalie worked with John, and would also see Jessica around. Natalie decided that she needed to tell John face-to-face about her and Brody. They agreed that they were doing the right thing, and she left. Brody picked up the recorder, and hit play. \"Natalie didn't have another man's baby. She had John's,\" Brody was shocked to hear Marty's recording say.\n\n\n Blair entered Rodi's and found John drinking alone. She wanted to know why he'd arrested Jack and hadn't called her. He reasoned that Todd and T\u00e9a had been there. Blair said that T\u00e9a had called, and told her that no charges had been filed. She was grateful that Jack hadn't done anything wrong. \"Except kill Gigi Morasco,\" John added.\n\n\nJohn updated Blair on everything from the MyFace messages, up to Brad taking all the blame for the crime. Blair felt sorry for Shane, but was relieved that Jack had had nothing to do with it. John chuckled, and said that he knew Brad had lied. He thought that Todd had made Brad's dad \"an offer he couldn't refuse.\" Blair was surprised that John thought Todd had paid off Brad's dad. John related that, \"For the time being, Jack got away with murder.\"\n\n\nJack sat with his legs in the pool, as the man with Todd's original face looked on. Starr entered and wondered why Jack was there alone, with tears on his face. Starr urged her brother to talk to her. Jack sadly informed Starr of what had happened to Gigi. Starr wondered why he was taking it so hard. He confessed that John had arrested him for kidnapping and murder, but had let him go. Starr related that Gigi had been so young, and that she couldn't imagine how hard things were on Rex and Shane. \"Don't you think I know that?\" Jack yelled at his sister.\n\n\nStarr knew all about the conflict between Jack and Shane, but she didn't think her brother would ever set out to intentionally hurt someone. Jack's phone rang, and he saw that it was Blair. He didn't want to answer it, so Starr did. Starr assured her mother that she was with Jack, and they were talking. She asked for some time with him, and hung up. Starr urged Jack to talk to her, because she was his sister. When Starr said that, the man remembered that he had a son named Jack.\n\n\nJack told Starr that everyone had always said that he was just like Todd. When he finally acted like Todd, \"everyone freaks out.\" Starr assured her brother that everyone messed up sometimes, but people needed to learn from their mistakes. She called her life \"Growing up Manning.\" Jack thought it was a curse, but Starr told him it was a blessing. The Mannings had seen the ugly side of life, but it made them stronger than most people. Jack slipped that Todd had gotten him out of trouble, but insisted that he hadn't meant to hurt anyone. Starr hugged her brother.\n\n\nStarr's phone went off, and Jack thought she should check it. She saw that she had a text message from Baz. \"Looking 4ward 2 working on that music w/u 2moro @ Capricorn,\" he said. Starr told her brother that the text wasn't important. \"Nothing is as important as family,\" she said, and walked away with her brother.\n\n\nBlair didn't know what to do about Jack, so John gave her a drink on the house. She couldn't believe that Gigi was gone, and regretted that she'd defended Jack the last time she'd talked to Gigi. John regretted that one of the last times he'd talked to Gigi was to fire her for being a good friend to Natalie. They toasted to Gigi. Blair vowed that, if John were right, she wouldn't let Todd and Jack cover up the crime. John took her word for it.\n\n\nBlair wondered why John wasn't with Kelly, so he admitted that they were done. Blair suggested that he was back with Natalie, because she could tell that he was thinking about her. John told Blair about when he had run into Natalie at the hospital. They'd talked, and he'd felt close to her. However, \"something snapped,\" and he'd remembered her lies. Blair told him that he was \"a damn fool\" if he let a chance for happiness get away. She thought that John and Natalie worked well together, and advised him to get over himself if he wanted a future with someone.\n\n\nBlair had to go home to Jack. She couldn't believe she'd been out of town when he'd gotten in trouble. She confessed that she'd been in New York with Tomas. She knew that Tomas had a lot of secrets, and that John didn't trust him, but she promised to be cautious. She had to try to be with Tomas, because she knew that she'd regret it if she didn't try. John thanked her for her advice, and she left.\n\n\nNatalie arrived at Rodi's. \"I have something to tell you,\" Natalie said. John replied that he had something to tell her as well.\n\n\nA short while later, Blair entered the pool area at La Boulaie, as the man with Todd's original face looked on.\n\n\n",
