    "soap_central": "\nAs Fate Would Have It\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Marty struggled to rise from her bed and stand, only to be caught by Todd, who urged her to rest and heal. Marty was impatient, however, and ignored Todd's warnings about her injuries and her lupus. \"Thanks,\" she said, \"but I think I know my body better than you do.\" Todd winced at her unintentional phrasing. Marty pleaded to be let outside into the fresh air, but Todd said she'd go when she was physically ready and not before. Marty said that if Todd wasn't going to let her out then he had to help her find a way to occupy her time, and asked him to tell her a story, or tell her the truth, about their past together. Todd was hesitant and uncommunicative, unnerved by Marty's friendly and caring manner. He admitted that they'd attended Llanview University together, and said he'd been the quarterback for the football team. Marty asked which school archetype she'd fit into: The nerd? The activist? The party girl? Remembering his taunting of \"Party Marty,\" Todd grew more and more uncomfortable, and wouldn't tell her any more. Then, Marty asked him to take her outside. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Madame Delphina reiterated her warning to Starr and Langston that Starr's unborn baby was in great danger. Before she could elaborate, though, Blair walked in and demanded to know what Delphina, whom she considered a fraud, was doing there. The women traded barbs back and forth but Starr managed to interject, urging Delphina to give her details about the danger to her child. Delphina clarified, saying that the baby was in great spiritual danger, and that a war was going to be fought over the child, \"and no one's gonna win.\" She rejected Starr and Blair's conclusions that the danger to the baby was Todd, and said that it wouldn't be him, \"not yet.\" Starr and Langston said goodbye to Blair and Madame Delphina, but not before Delphina used a cryptic riddle to suggest they call Markko, and told Langston to remember what she'd said, \"Your family's watching you.\" Then, the girls stepped into the foyer to confer in private about the situation with the baby and Cole. Starr warned Langston that she wouldn't change her mind about adoption and stunned her foster sister by revealing her plans for Marcie to adopt the child. Langston said Cole, Todd, and Blair would never allow that, but Starr proclaimed that it wasn't up to any of them. Frustrated, Langston called Markko. \n\n\nAt the diner, Cole met with Markko, who urged him to call Starr and work things out. Cole said they had nothing left to talk about and that no one was taking is kid.\" Markko was horrified to learn that Cole planned to sue for custody, and said that Cole didn't realize the full depth of what he was getting into as a single parent. Markko said that he'd watched his own parents struggle to raise a family together, and that in raising the baby alone, Cole would be giving up his future and his youth just to rear a child the mother didn't want. Cole ignored Markko's advice, saying that Markko didn't understand all that Cole had lost, and said that the baby would be his life's adventure. He said he had rights and that Starr couldn't stop him from suing and taking custody. Markko warned him that he'd lose Starr in the process; Cole countered that he'd tried to care for her through the pregnancy as a loving partner, but Starr had given up on them. Markko pleaded with Cole to reach out to Starr. Just then, Langston called and told Markko she was coming to the diner with Starr. Markko asked her not to, telling her that Cole was there, but Langston said that Starr and Cole had to face each other sooner or later. She told him they were on their way, and Markko hung up and told Cole. He asked his friend to stay and try once more to make Starr understand how he felt. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Marcie met with her custody lawyer, Judy Schulman-Brown. She thanked Judy for all her help and support in the past, then broached the subject of adoption. Marcie said that she understood that conventional adoption was closed to her and Michael, but inquired about the possibility of private adoption. Judy sensed that Marcie's question was more than hypothetical, and probed her for the truth. Marcie confessed that \"a girl\" had come forward, sympathetic to Marcie's loss and wanting to give away an unborn child; she didn't name Starr. Marcie told Judy she felt pathetic to be so eager but asked if she could afford to pass up what could be her last chance at a family for her and Michael. Judy said they could discuss it more over dinner, and ushered Marcie out of the hotel lobby. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, with the girls gone, Delphina turned on Blair, saying she knew Blair's real anger was about her divorce from Todd Manning. Blair dismissed Delphina's \"rantings\" as another con, and Delphina admitted she'd seen the divorce papers on the nearby desk. But she warned Blair that she wasn't done with Todd, even though Todd had his hands full with \"the other woman.\" Blair didn't believe there was anyone else, but Delphina said that Todd and the \"other woman\" shared \"a dark bond.\" Blair's mind immediately went to T\u00e9a Delgado, but Delphina said it wasn't her. As she left, she told Blair to call if she needed her. \n\n\nIn Jared and Natalie's room at the Angel Square Hotel, they were shocked to see \"Jessica,\" actually Tess, on their doorstep. \"You can't hide from me, Natalie,\" Tess intoned, and asked if she could come in. Tess quickly took control of the situation with the startled lovers, and said that it had to be tough living in isolation together, but they would both survive, \"you're good at that.\" She said the burial was over and Nash was gone, and so she had to deal with them. \"Are you scared, Natalie?\" Tess asked, toying with her prey. \"Because if I was you, I'd be terrified.\" She then reached into her handbag and produced...roses from the gravesite to give to Natalie and Jared. The distant \"Jessica\" suggested they both go to Nash's grave and lay the flowers there so they might also have a chance to pay their respects, and said she understood that that was what they were trying to do at the funeral. \"Jessica\" said she hadn't come to fight, but to move forward; she said Natalie was her sister and she loved her, and knew Nash's death was an accident, that she had been looking for someone to blame. \n\n\nNatalie said they were sorry they had come to the funeral, but the aloof Tess said she was the one to apologize for her cruel remarks and explained that she knew Natalie had meant no harm. Natalie tearfully embraced \"Jess\" and thanked her for her understanding. Nat begged her to understand that Jared was \"innocent\" as well. Tess bristled at this and said she didn't know if she could ever forgive him. Jared said he understood and solemnly swore that he could never forgive himself, that he knew he did bear responsibility for what his actions led to. Natalie refused to allow him to accept the burden, however, and, as Tess seethed, blamed Jared's anger upon coming to Llanview on Tess's past misdeeds. \"But I am Tess,\" Tess revealed-then explained that she meant Tess was a part of Jessica through integration. She said the Tess aspect of herself was the rage in her over Nash's death, but the rest of her understood the importance of forgiveness and moving on. The sisters hugged again, and Tess bid the lovers goodbye. \"I'm so relieved,\" Natalie remarked to Jared, feeling confident that they could get through their recent hardships. Jared didn't seem so sure, however, as he pondered \"Jessica's\" strange behavior. \n\n\nAt the diner, Starr and Langston arrived to meet with Cole and Markko. Langston and Markko left Cole and Starr alone to talk. The two estranged lovebirds were awkward and quiet, until Cole held out his hand and took Starr in his arms. They admitted that they had missed each other, and seemed about to make progress right when Marcie and Judy Schulman-Brown walked in. \n\n\nBack at the hotel, Tess stalked out of the lobby in a fury, snarling at Madame Delphina to move as she entered going in the other direction. Tuned in to Tess's presence, Delphina exclaimed, \"Who are you and what have you done with Jessica?\" But Tess was already out the door, murmuring, \"Jessica has left the building.\" \n\n\nAt Todd's new house, Todd was extremely awkward and uncomfortable when Marty asked him to carry her downstairs and outside. He struggled to lift her and seemed very ill-at-ease holding her in his arms, while Marty didn't have a care in the world as they descended the stairs. Just then, the doorbell rang, and Blair called repeatedly for Todd. Still in Todd's arms, Marty asked if he was going to answer the door. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marcie calls her lawyer friend Judy over to discuss the \"hypothetical\" situation of a pregnant teenage girl giving her baby up for adoption to her and Michael. But she does not reveal just whom this girl is. Meanwhile, the fortune teller whom Dorian has invited to the house reveals to Starr that there is some sort of \"conflict\" involving her baby. Blair doesn't want her daughter to believe a word the fortune teller says. But she has some insights about how Starr needs to go and talk to Cole. And she also reveals to Blair that Todd is involved in some sort of \"business\" with a woman from his past, although she does not reveal whom the woman is. Meanwhile, Marty is beginning to trust Todd, still with no memory of him. Cole tells Markko he won't let Starr give the baby up for adoption. Markko tells Cole he must attempt to reach out to Starr and see it from her point of view. Jessica has turned into Tess and is ready to make Natalie and Jared believe she is herself, (not Tess), that she is no longer angry at them nor blames them for Nash's death. Natalie buys right into that although Jared does not. The fortune teller finds herself right at the place where Marcie and Michael live, as if she knows that there is some significance between them and Starr's baby.",
