In a deserted barn, where Nate was tied up, Bull informed Todd that Blair had been nosing around and had nearly caught him, so he had left.  Bull revealed to Todd that he had selected a new, quieter place, \"a big, red barn with a broken-down silo.\"  Todd demanded to know if Nate was okay, so Bull put Nate on the phone to talk to Dani.  Nate regretted that he had taken the money, but Dani told him to just be safe.  Back on the phone, Bull demanded that Todd arrive quickly and warned that if Todd tried to double-cross Bull, \"the kid here gets two in the head...and so will you.\"\n\n\nTodd insisted that Dani not follow him, and that she should return home to her mother.  Dani showed concern for Todd's safety, which Todd downplayed, as he claimed that Dani worried too much.  To comfort Dani, Todd promised that he would rescue Nate for her.  Dani pretended to leave but secretly followed Todd.  As he gagged Nate, Bull announced his readiness to meet \"one of his guests.\"\n\n\nIn an out-of-the-way diner, James kissed Starr, who yelled, \"What the heck do you think you're doing?\"  James stated that \"the guy at the bar\" was holding a picture of them, and that he only had kissed Starr to keep her quiet.  James speculated that \"the guy\" was Bull's guy, but Starr revealed that he was actually one of Todd's goons.  Starr suggested that James should steal the goon's car for a quick getaway and revealed that she had a plan.  \n\n\nAs the guy stood at the counter, Starr asked him if he were looking for her.  The goon replied that Todd had wanted him to find Starr.  While Starr diverted Todd's goon, James grabbed the car keys and ran out of the diner.  Starr then announced that she needed to freshen up, and she ran out.  When the waitress informed the goon that a boy had accompanied Starr, the goon ran out.\n\n\nJames thought that Starr had been coming on to the goon but then realized that it had all been part of Starr's plan.  James insisted that he would be dealing with Bull and told Starr to return home.  James claimed that he would work off the money that he owed Bull.  When Starr asked to stay with James, he stressed that they were \"going to part ways.\"  Starr relented and begged James to keep out of trouble.\n\n\nTodd talked to the goon on the phone about Starr, as he arrived at the big, red barn to meet with Bull.  Before Todd could enter the barn, he spotted Starr, as James greeted Bull in the barn, and while Dani continued to hide in Todd's car.\n\n\nIn a cabana, after Blair and Eli kissed and made love, they both agreed that their lovemaking was amazing.  Eli pointed out that only one thing could do their lovemaking justice...\"Marry me.\"  Blair laughed, but Eli stated that he was serious.  \"I love you.  I want to marry you.\"  When Blair expressed surprise, Eli was surprised.  He insisted that he had not returned to Philadelphia, because of Blair.  Eli asserted that he and Blair made a great team, and that he liked all of her kids, even Jack, when Jack was not blackmailing him.  Blair maintained that she did not know what to say, and Eli begged, \"Say yes.\"\n\n\nBlair asked Eli for more time to think, because she did not want to make the same mistakes, over and over again, that she had made with Todd.  Eli reminded Blair that he was not Todd, but he understood that marriage was a complicated issue for Blair, because of Todd.  Eli exclaimed that Blair was well worth waiting for.  Blair left the cabana to begin thinking about the proposal, because she claimed that she did not want to keep Eli waiting.\n\n\nAt the pool, David, who was wrapped in a flagged towel for the Fourth of July festivities, greeted Dorian and Kelly and told Kelly that he sympathized with her for her \"nun-like dry spell\" and wondered how long it had been since she had \"a hard body under her fingertips.\"  David told Kelly that he would put her \"back in the saddle\" in dating and sprayed tanning oil in her hand to rub all over him.  As Kelly cringed, and Dorian screamed for security, David reminded Dorian and Kelly that they could not kick him out, since he was Viki's guest.  \"You folks need me around here.  I'm much needed eye candy in an otherwise sugar-free world.\"  Kelly proclaimed that she had to leave to wash -- or burn -- her hands.\n\n\nAs Brody and Jessica strolled through the grounds, Brody told her that he treasured their alone time together, while Jessica was grateful that Viki and Charlie were watching Bree.  After Brody and Jessica selected a spot to sit, Ford spied on them, as they kissed.  When Ford greeted Brody and Jessica and then asked Brody about Hannah, Brody informed him that McBain was \"on her trail.\"  Ford thanked Brody for the information.  Jessica reflected on prom night, when she had been in Ford's bed, as Ford remarked, \"And uh...nice seeing you again,\" before he left.  Brody questioned how Jessica and Ford knew each other.  Jessica reminded Brody that Ford had once hit on her at Cristian and Layla's apartment.\n\n\nKelly joined Brody and Jessica but then announced that she would be leaving the festivities.  Kelly then warned them to stay away from the pool, because \"I might be flooding the water later.\"  As the girls decided to meet at another time, Brody had to take a phone call and suggested that they have their meeting.\n\n\nWhen Kelly announced that she was trying to avoid David Vickers, Jessica cried that she needed to talk to Kelly about Ford.  Jessica stated that she had wanted to tell Brody about Ford and prom night, but that Ford had stopped her.  Jessica claimed that she did not know what to do.  Kelly said, \"Well, you know what?  That's easy.  You ask yourself, do you want Brody to hear about that night from you or from Ford?\"  \n\n\nKelly insisted that Brody loved Jessica, and that he would understand.  Jessica stated that she had decided to tell Brody, as he walked up.  Brody updated Jessica and Kelly with the news that John had arrested Hannah, and Kelly announced her departure.  Jessica told Brody that he needed to know about Ford and began to tell him about the night of the prom.\n\n\nBack at the pool, David claimed that he could always have Dorian, whenever he wanted.  Dorian compared David to Ford, whom David called \"a pretender, a wannabe, a never will be,\" as Ford walked up in a patriotic Speedo swimsuit that matched David's.  David exclaimed, \"I've been wearing the stars and the stripes on the Fourth of July since you were in diapers,\" and Ford responded, \"Actually, speaking of diapers, yours is looking a little soggy.\"\n\n\nDorian screamed that Ford would never have the chance to do to another woman what he had done to her daughter, just as Langston arrived.  Ford remarked that it was good to see Langston, however, Langston could not say the same about Ford.  Dorian defended Langston, \"What's next...an empty apology?  My daughter is much too smart to give you a second chance.\"  However, David felt that Langston would give Ford a second chance, because Langston was like Dorian, and Dorian had given David many chances in the past.  Langston then pushed Ford into the pool.  As Ford stepped out of the pool, he admitted that he had deserved it and left.\n\n\nWhen Dorian declared that she was very proud of Langston, David observed, \"There's nothing that a Cramer woman does better than crash and burn her one shot at love.\"  Dorian demanded that Langston not \"listen to anything that this has-been hemorrhoid salesman has to say.\"  David believed that Ford was a changed man, due to his near-death experience and guessed that Langston could still have Ford, if she wanted him.  Langston remarked that she was no longer interested in celebrating the festivities and left.\n\n\nDavid observed, \"Hey, Dorian, it's going to be okay.  Langston's a smart girl.  There's no way she's going to end up like you.\"  Dorian questioned why it would be horrible for Langston to turn out like her, and David reminded Dorian that she could be \"impossible to please\" and \"sometimes just plain mean.\"  Dorian announced that she had just realized that she should try to be more like Langston, as she pushed David in the pool.  Dorian cackled merrily.\n\n\nIn the Aberdeen, Maryland, motel room, Cole confronted Hannah.  He claimed that he could lose Starr and face jail time, because Hannah had claimed that Todd had tried to kill Marty, just to break up Cole and Starr.  Cole cried that he should have listened to Starr, when she had insisted that Hannah would do anything, even push Marty down the stairs, just as John burst through the door.  John arrested Hannah for the attempted murder of Robert Ford.\n\n\nNatalie entered immediately after John and told Cole to call his mom.  However, Cole stated that he needed to call Starr first.  John said that Ford had fingered Hannah for the attack, and Natalie informed Hannah that fibers from her sweater had been found in Hannah's closet, and that her sweater had contained Ford's blood.  Cole demanded that Hannah also tell John and Natalie the truth about Todd, Marty, and John's baby.  Cole revealed that Hannah had admitted that she lied when she had stated that she saw Todd push Marty down the stairs.  After Hannah admitted to the lie, Cole speculated that Hannah had also killed John's baby.\n\n\nHannah yelled out her denial for the attack on Marty, and Natalie demanded to know how Hannah could kill John's baby, just to break up Cole and Starr.  Hannah shrieked, \"You know, neither of you know what you are talking about.  You're both wrong.\"  As John marched her out of the motel, Hannah continuously insisted that she did not attack Ford, push Dr. Saybrooke, or kill John's baby...but she revealed that she knew who did.\n\n\nLangston located Ford in a cabana, and Ford requested that they have a talk.  Kelly interrupted them and suggested that Langston might want to leave.  Once Langston had left, Kelly indicated that she had some words for Ford.  Kelly warned that Ford was going to forget about Langston and forget about Jessica also.  Kelly speculated that once Brody knew about prom night, he would want to help Hannah finish what she had started.  Ford emphasized that the police would need to find Hannah first.  Kelly replied that Hannah had just been arrested, so Ford had better watch his steps.  Kelly stormed out of Ford's cabana.\n\n\nAs Ford opened the cabana door, he exclaimed, \"You.  So, you read the news, right?  Uh, Hannah O'Connor's been arrested.  Looks like our frame job worked,\" as he looked upon Eli's jeering face.\n\n\n",
