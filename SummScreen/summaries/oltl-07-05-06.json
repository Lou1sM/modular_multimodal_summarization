Though he's reluctant at first (because he wanted their first time to be special and their being at the location is really due to a plot to catch the stalker), he gives in when she says that none of that matters. They each declare their love for the other. Rex learns that the stalker remains at large, his trail grown cold.\n\n\nKelly visits Duke's grave and tells him how she misses him and that he's given her what she's always wanted. She is worried about what Kevin's reaction will be and she doesn't know how to behave. She jumps when Kevin suddenly appears, but apparently he hasn't heard all that she's said. He was trying to find comfort in the church but it didn't work, he laments. He wishes Kelly hadn't slept with Duke. He relates Viki's promise that he would find a meaning in Duke's death along with the fact that he would live on. He won't have any grandchildren or any legacy from Duke. Kelly tries to give him her news but he meanders off without letting her speak. \n\n\nNora tries to walk but falls. She refuses Michael's aid in getting back to the chair but he lends her a helping hand. He promises to \"step up\" her physical therapy in the morning. He receives a call from John and heads for his place. Paige watches from the doorway. She and Nora wish each other well. Paige discloses that she and Bo are going to try to make a go of it again. Nora admits that her previous behavior was due to the aneurysm and thanks Paige for being so good to Matthew. She holds no grudges. \n\n\nThe events of the tragic evening in question are recounted to John, Michael and Nat. David mentions his own father and how he was carrying on his inherited illegal activities. He was making collections when McBain tried to stop him. David emphatically denies remembering anything after the shooting and has been on the run ever since. John asks him to change his plea to guilty but David states in no uncertain terms that he will deny their entire conversation, regardless of the fact that three people heard it. He will not go back to jail. John tries to persuade him to ease his soul and suggests he meet him at the courthouse. Michael is upset and wants to be with Marcie. John knows the admission is inadmissible but at least he now knows exactly what happened. He has a feeling though, that there's more. \n\n\nMarcie has her hands full, as she is unable to quiet down a fussing and crying Tommy. Having heard the ruckus, Roxy stops by and manages to show Marcie a trick of quieting the baby by running the vacuum. She also corrects Marcie when she calls Tommy \"my baby.\" She has a feeling that Marcie is too attached and won't be returning the baby when it's time. She also doesn't think it's a good time for the newlyweds to start a family. Michael arrives home and is confused over the vacuum cleaner running so late at night. The baby is quiet though. He reminds his wife of the appointment in the morning with child services, which she claims to have conveniently forgotten was the following day. He informs her of David's confession also and divulges that he feels able to get past it now. He doesn't think that John feels the same. \n\n\nDavid packs his belongings though he seems to have second thoughts about it. Nora takes some steps alone. Nat and John put their thoughts on John's dad aside for the night.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Kelly is at Duke's grave. She talks to him, telling him that the baby is his and not Kevin's. She has no idea how she is to feel. She would like to be happy but she can't be. She hears something behind her and turns to find Kevin walking up behind her. He asks her if she is there to tell Duke how much she loves him. He tells that he comes there everyday, and that he keeps hoping that one day he will come and Duke will not be there. Viki keeps telling him that Duke's death serves a purpose but he can't see what that purpose is. There is just nothing left now that Duke is gone, Kevin says. Kelly tells him that he is wrong. There is something left. David gives John and Michael the confession they asked for. David explains that his father had an operation set up and he did the collections. He took a gun with him to be like his dear old dad. He showed up and Thomas just appeared. David admits that he shot the man unintentionally and that he did say something about his sons that he had boys like him, and they were waiting for him at home. Rex and Adriana are about to make love. He can't. He would be doing this with a lie between them. He tells he made sure everyone heard that they were going to a certain inn, but in fact he had taken Adriana elsewhere. The trick worked. The stalker showed up and they chased him, but he hasn't been caught. Adriana has no problem with making love under these circumstances and so they do! After David confesses, John tells him to change his plea to 'guilty'. David will not do that. He will deny everything that he has just said, in fact. Michael wants to beat him up but John intervenes. John says that he will be at the courthouse at 1pm and expects to see David there. Afterwards, John can't help that feel like he doesn't have the whole story still. David heads home and packs his bags",
