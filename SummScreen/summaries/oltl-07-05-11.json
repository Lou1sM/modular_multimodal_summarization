Blair arrived just as David dropped his towel, and she quickly hid her eyes. Blair revealed that she was there to figure out what to do about Todd. She had already spoken to Jack, but her son had gone to his room.\n\n\nDavid informed Blair that he and Dorian had previous plans to \"wash away their doubts,\" and Blair was concerned that the couple planned on having sex in the pool. David admitted that was the plan, though Dorian disagreed. Dorian had all the time in the world, and she wanted to hear what had happened with Jack. Blair filled Dorian in quickly on Jack's involvement in Gigi's murder.\n\n\nDorian sent David back to the house. She agreed that Blair had to talk to Todd, but Blair was unable to reach her ex-husband. David returned wearing his stars and stripes Speedo. \"God bless America,\" Blair declared. The fireworks had begun, but Dorian preferred to go to bed. She had to get up early in the morning. David couldn't believe that Dorian still imagined that David was having an affair with Ionia.\n\n\nJoey and Kelly shared a kiss on the roof of Llanview hospital, but Joey was curious. He couldn't understand why Kelly had kissed him, because she'd stated that she only wanted to be friends. Kelly confessed that she didn't know, and she thought about it briefly. \"Oh, my God, I changed my mind,\" she wailed. She admitted to being a flake, but Joey disagreed.\n\n\nKelly pointed out that Joey had rejected her several times when she had given him chances, all for a woman he'd known for less than a minute. Joey replied that he had been wrong to do that, but Kelly was certain that she should run away while she could. Joey informed her that he would always follow her. He was aware that he had hurt many people and had made a fool of himself.\n\n\nJoey realized that he should have learned to listen to the people he loved and trusted. He wanted to start over with Kelly, but Kelly wondered how they could accomplish it. Joey thought they could start with Kelly giving him a chance, but Kelly was doubtful. He had put everyone through a lot, and they hadn't even ever dealt with their former marriage. Joey thought it would be easy enough to remember what was important to them. They kissed again.\n\n\nJoey spoke to Viki on the phone and learned that Clint's surgery had been successful. Kelly thought it was Joey's lucky night. They turned to watch the July Fourth fireworks, but Joey wanted to head downstairs to visit with Clint, and Kelly offered to accompany him. Joey agreed that he had lots to celebrate.\n\n\nAubrey outlined her plan of a girls' night for Rama while they sat in their room at the Minute Man Motel. She thought that they should make noise to annoy Ford in his room. They wondered about the scream of help they'd heard, emanating from Ford's room earlier, and they ran outside to put their ears to his front door. It was quiet.\n\n\nAubrey thought that the best thing would be to call the motel management, but Rama reminded her that it was a \"shady motel.\" Lots worse things had occurred there, Rama stated as she listed some of them. Rama was certain that management wouldn't care about a scream, and she suggested that Aubrey call the police instead.\n\n\nAubrey was loath to call the police, because she considered Ford to be a \"good guy.\" Rama thought it possible that Ford was in trouble as well, especially because they hadn't heard any additional sounds. Aubrey was convinced, and she made the call. Suddenly, there was a loud knocking at their own front door.\n\n\nDimming the lights and standing behind the door, Aubrey waited with the room's fire extinguisher in her hands. The door opened, and she clunked the person on the head, while Rama slugged him. The person fell to the floor. Turning on the lights, the women were surprised to see a disgusted Cutter, who slammed his key down on the floor.\n\n\nCutter revealed that he'd been kicked out of the mansion and needed a place to stay. Aubrey suggested he go to the Palace, but Cutter admitted he'd already tried to get a room there. Not only had Renee tossed him out, but she'd made sure that he couldn't get a room anywhere within 100 miles of Llanview. He had seen Aubrey's name on the register at the Minute Man, had handed the clerk some cash, and  received a key. \"My, how the tables have turned,\" Aubrey stated.\n\n\nCutter announced that he had nowhere to go, but Aubrey wasn't very sympathetic. She reminded him of how he'd kicked her out of the Buchanan residence. Cutter retorted that she had deserved it, but he had a good reason to stay at the motel, and that reason was Joey. Rama excused herself; she sensed a big argument about to happen. She stated that the fireworks were about to start.\n\n\nCutter informed Aubrey that he had always trusted her, and she'd always returned to him after their scams. She'd broken the rules this time. Aubrey declared that she had fallen in love with Joey. She was aware that she'd hurt lots of people, and she was sorry that she had hurt Cutter. He reminded her of how they had planned to settle down after he had the money. \"Screw the plan. I don't want you anymore,\" Cutter retorted. He asked if he could still spend the night in the room.\n\n\nIn Ford's motel room, Jessica promised Ford that she wouldn't scream again, and she owed him an apology anyway. Confused, Ford reminded her that he was the one who had done the kidnapping. Jessica explained that she hadn't been able to handle things as a normal person after Natalie had slept with Brody, and Ford had turned out to be Ryder's father. Those were the reasons that Tess had appeared. She advised Ford that Tess was gone and would never return.\n\n\n\"She meant everything to me,\" Ford complained. Jessica apologized and assured Ford that she hadn't meant to hurt him. \"So Tess is really gone?\" Ford asked sadly. Jessica nodded her head. Ford explained that while everyone had advised him that Tess hadn't been a real person, she'd seemed real to him. They had loved each other. Jessica was sorry, but she was stronger, and she wanted her own life back.\n\n\nJessica admitted that she'd blamed Ford for all of her misfortune. Ford explained that all that he'd done had been for Ryder, including going along with Tess. Then they had fallen in love. Ford began to untie Jessica, who was bound to a chair. He confessed that he'd taken advantage of Jessica when she was in her teenaged emotional state, but Jessica disagreed.\n\n\nJessica felt that she had been upset over Cristian and had gone along with Ford. He'd asked her several times if she were okay. Jessica admitted that she had to learn to accept responsibility for her mental state and couldn't hide behind anyone any longer. Ford suggested that something good had happened, after all, and Jessica agreed that they had a beautiful baby boy.\n\n\nJessica wanted to get past all that had happened in order to share custody of Ryder with Ford, especially because Brody was no longer an option to her. Besides, Ford loved Ryder and was the baby's father, Jessica added. Ford noted that he felt the same regarding Tess, who was the baby's mother, and with Tess gone, Jessica was the one who was around.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody stood in Liam's nursery and held the baby tight. He had wanted a family, but he wasn't sure what he should do. \"How do I tell Natalie the truth?\" Brody wondered. Just then, Natalie walked in and sensed that something wasn't right. \"What's wrong?\" she asked. She hoped that nothing was wrong with her son. Brody assured her that Liam was fine, but Brody was worried that he was going to lose both Natalie and Liam. \"Natalie, there's something you need to know about John,\" Brody declared.\n\n\nBrody told Natalie to sit down, but she refused. He explained that he'd been looking for her, and he'd seen her with John. Natalie interrupted. She knew what Brody wanted to say to her. She informed Brody that she and John were not getting closer. It had been quite the opposite, as Natalie had ended any chance of a relationship with John. She had told John about her and Brody getting closer to each other.\n\n\nNatalie assured Brody that John wouldn't be able to tear their little family apart, and he wasn't an issue. She believed they had a real family, and Brody and Liam made her happy. Brody declared that he was afraid of losing Natalie and Liam to John. Natalie reminded Brody that she had decided to move on, if Brody would have her and Liam. \"With my whole heart,\" Brody replied happily. He put his arms around Natalie.\n\n\nNatalie was ready to check on her father, and she handed the baby to Brody, who began to speak to his son. Brody was upset that he had lied to Natalie. Brody wasn't Liam's father, and he didn't think he could continue with the lies. \"I can't do this,\" Brody said to the baby, and continued, \"Lie to Natalie and John.\" He had to tell the truth. On the other hand, Natalie had told John it was over, and that was what Natalie wanted. Brody had lost Jessica and Ryder, and he refused to lose anyone else.\n\n\nNatalie returned to tell Brody about Clint's successful surgery. She was ready to go to the hospital. Brody chatted to the baby again. He explained that he'd told Liam a secret, and he would never repeat it again. No one would ever find out.\n\n\n\"Damn,\" John repeated several times to himself. When Vimal walked into Rodi's even though the closed sign was posted, he locked the door behind him. John advised the man that the bar was not open. Not to be deterred, Vimal announced that he had something important to talk to John about. \"Okay, Patel, spit it out,\" John urged as Vimal began to talk about Todd's son no longer being in trouble. John wasn't interested in hearing about the Mannings.\n\n\nVimal began to talk again, this time about his being mistaken that he was about to be a father. He noted that he and John had lots in common. John was impatient, as Vimal continued to digress and ramble on. John wondered if Vimal might be drunk. Vimal announced that he had to tell the truth. Todd showed up, but he was unable to get inside. He watched Vimal and John through the window.\n\n\nTodd began to bang on the door as Vimal was telling John how much they had in common. \"Don't answer that,\" Vimal begged. He asked John to protect him, and pleaded that John not let Todd inside. John headed to the door, and suddenly, Vimal was speechless. \"Vimal, what is it?\" John demanded to know. John advised Todd the bar was closed as Todd made his way inside.\n\n\nJohn was derailed from his task of getting rid of Todd when a police officer arrived to report an abduction of a young woman from the hospital parking lot. The description matched Jessica. Upon examining the information on the kidnapper's car, John learned that it belonged to Ford. He issued an APB on Ford, and learned that there had been a suspicious phone call from the Minute Man Motel, involving a scream for help.\n\n\nVimal advised Todd that Todd could not keep him from talking to John, but John kicked everyone out of Rodi's due to police business at the motel. Vimal wanted to leave, but Todd had other plans. \"I think we have to work this out,\" Todd declared. Vimal advised Todd that he couldn't keep a man and his son apart, and it was a great injustice to keep the truth from John.\n\n\n Todd continued to try to talk Vimal out of spilling the beans, and he informed Vimal that Vimal would be named an accessory after the fact. Vimal denied that would happen, because Todd had merely volunteered the information about John to Vimal. Todd was the one who would go to jail, Vimal insisted.\n\n\nTodd thought it might help if he explained that John had wanted to send Todd's innocent son to jail. That was the kind of man John was, Todd insinuated. He reminded Vimal that Vimal should want to impress his parents, and Vimal had nothing to show his parents to make them proud. Todd was certain that John didn't even care about his own son, and that was the reason for Vimal to remain quiet.\n\n\nVimal accused Todd of just trying to get back at John, but Todd disagreed. He noted that Liam already had a great father. Todd offered to make Vimal's parents proud, and he offered him a job at the Sun. Vimal was surprised. He didn't know anything about the tabloids, he replied to Todd. Vimal could be the technical director, Todd decided. He would give Vimal a great salary. It would be seven figures, Todd added. Vimal still refused, though he appeared to begin to mull the offer over.\n\n\nTodd mentioned how thrilled Vimal's parents and wife would be. He offered to reserve the Presidential Suite at the Palace for Vimal's parents. \"Bad things happen to people who make me angry. I thought you knew that,\" Todd advised Vimal. Todd really wanted Vimal to keep quiet about John being Liam's true father. He might have to call his 300-pound friend to cut out Vimal's tongue and bury it with the rest of Vimal's body, Todd threatened.\n\n\nAs Jessica and Ford discussed the shared custody of their son, the cops, along with John McBain, burst into the room. John wanted Ford arrested, but Jessica assured John that everything was fine. Jessica informed the cops that she would not be pressing charges, and it had merely been a misunderstanding. Ford was Ryder's father, and he would not be going to jail, Jessica added.\n\n\nJohn ordered Ford to beware of pulling any similar stunts in the future. He advised Ford that he was free to go. Jessica announced that she wanted to get to the hospital to check on her father, and Ford offered to drive her. He thanked her for allowing him to share custody of Ryder. Jessica thought they might be able to start working on the plan while they headed to the hospital.\n\n\nAubrey agreed that Cutter could stay, and he wanted to plan a new scam for them to get involved in. Aubrey pointed out that Rama would be returning shortly. Cutter grabbed a pillow and headed to the sofa, while Aubrey remained on her side of the bed.\n\n\nRama watched the fireworks from the Minute Man Motel and tried to reach Vimal on the phone.\n\n\nJohn returned to Rodi's and saw Todd and Vimal sitting outside side by side. John noted that Vimal was with his \"girlfriend,\" and John wanted to know what Vimal had intended to talk to him about. Vimal declared that he had been mistaken, and he had nothing to say to John. Later, John saw Vimal alone. John watched the fireworks and thoughtfully watched Vimal stand up to leave.\n\n\n",
