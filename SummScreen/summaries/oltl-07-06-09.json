As Rex announced that he was determined to find the blood sample, Stacy entered and questioned whom Rex was speaking to.  After making up an excuse, Rex attempted to exit the shower, but Stacy pulled him into an embrace and insisted upon sharing an intimate moment.  In an attempt to distract her, Rex suggested that they refrain from having any sexual contact until they had a first date.   Stacy asked Rex to take her to the Palace that night, and a cornered Rex agreed.\n\n\nConvinced that Rex was avoiding her, Stacy told Rex that she realized that he felt guilty about having sex with her.  Stacy said that it was only natural for Rex to feel as though he had cheated on Gigi.  Pulling Rex close, Stacy stated that she was willing to wait until Rex figured things out.

Afterward, a disgusted Rex gagged, and rinsed his mouth out with dishwashing liquid.\n\n\nWhen Schuyler showed up at the cottage to check on Gigi, he was surprised to find her in a good mood.  Gigi explained that she had finally told Rex the truth about Stacy's evil scheme.  After realizing that Rex hadn't told Gigi about his romantic encounter with Stacy, Schuyler blurted out, \"Are you sure Rex isn't playing you?\"  Gigi assured Schuyler that Rex had been truthful with her and that Stacy was the one in the dark.  Schuyler appeared bothered when Gigi declared that Rex had never had any sexual contact with Stacy. Conflicted, Schuyler asked Gigi if Rex had denied sleeping with Stacy, but Gigi refused to believe that Rex had neglected to mention that he had slept with Stacy.\n\n\nFrustrated by Gigi's defense of Rex, Schuyler attempted to tell Gigi about Stacy's claim about having sex with Rex.  Before Schuyler could reveal Rex's indiscretion, Rex entered the cottage and asked what was going on.  After Gigi explained that Schuyler was checking on her, Rex apologized for giving Schuyler such a difficult time.  Uncomfortable with Rex's presence, Schuyler quickly excused himself.  Alone with Gigi, Rex stated that it was imperative that he find the blood that Stacy had hidden.  Rex said that he couldn't bear to spend another moment with Stacy and feared what he might do to her out of anger.  Gigi reminded Rex that Stacy could never learn that he knew the truth until they discover the whereabouts of the missing blood sample.  Rex announced that Stacy had given him an idea.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Stacy took a shower and daydreamed that she and Rex were making love.

If John located the drug supplier, Cole's sentence would be permanently dismissed.  If John couldn't find the source, Cole would serve time at Statesville.

Dorian stated that Markko shouldn't be on the grounds, but Markko announced that he was Cole's best man and had no intention on missing the ceremony. \n\n\nLangston and Markko became suspicious when Dorian suggested that they reschedule the dinner.
