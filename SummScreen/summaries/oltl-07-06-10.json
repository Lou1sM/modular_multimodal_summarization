Hannah vowed that she would never do anything to hurt Marty or her baby, and wondered how pushing Marty down the stairs would make Cole like her. Natalie explained that blaming Todd would drive a wedge between Starr and Cole, which would leave room for Hannah. John insisted on Hannah telling him who pushed Marty, but Hannah refused to tell without making a deal first.\n\n\nHannah wanted immunity for all the crimes of which she had been accused. John told her that telling the truth would be her immunity, while Natalie didn't think Hannah had the right to start making deals because there was a solid case against her. Hannah knew the evidence against her looked bad, but claimed someone was framing her. Hannah swore that she wasn't lying and again offered John the name of the person that killed his unborn baby. John informed her that only the district attorney could make deals. Angry, she refused to say more until she had a lawyer; she demanded that she get her one phone call.\n\n\nIn the cabana, Ford assured Elijah that no one would know that it was Elijah who attacked him. Elijah told Ford that he didn't like blackmail, but Ford didn't like it either, especially \"asking for more money.\" However, Ford needed to get away after the mess with Langston, and with Jessica. Ford wondered why Elijah chose Hannah to blame Ford's attack on. Elijah explained that she was the perfect scapegoat, especially if they considered how distraught she had been after Ford broke up with her. Elijah was elated to have \"killed two birds with one stone.\" Ford asked who the other bird was.\n\n\nElijah was angry at Ford for questioning him, and said that the smart move would be to just finish Ford off. Ford reminded him that Hannah was in custody, so the crime couldn't be pinned on her. He related that the really smart move was knowing who Elijah really was. Elijah felt threatened, but Ford reminded him what would happen if something were to happen to Ford again. Everyone would find out that Elijah was really Bennett Thompson.\n\n\nElijah felt threatened, but Ford reasoned that he was willing to let the fact that Elijah bludgeoned him go. However, if anything happened to him, the Sun would get a full report about who Elijah really was. Ford explained that if Elijah wanted to keep his life with Blair, he would have to leave Ford alone. Otherwise, Todd, who was very protective of his ex-wife, would get a package in the mail.\n\n\nKelly was surprised to learn that Elijah had proposed to Blair because she didn't know they were that serious. Blair didn't, either, and informed Kelly that she needed time to think about it. Kelly called her cousin stupid and accused her of being scared that the relationship would go south after marriage. After both women sang Elijah's praises, Kelly wanted to know why Blair needed to think about it. Blair explained that she thought Elijah would make a great husband and father, but she had to think about her children. She also worried that Todd might fight for custody again if she got married.\n\n\nWhile they were speaking of Todd, Blair thought that Kelly had been spending a lot of time with Todd. Kelly rationalized that they worked together and shared an office, but Blair wondered if that was all they shared. Kelly assured her cousin that the only man she was interested in was Bennett Thompson. Blair asked if Kelly was sure Bennett Thompson was the one who killed Melinda. Kelly was sure that was the reason his name was in Melinda's vase. Blair reasoned that finding him wouldn't bring her mother back, and that Kelly shouldn't get close to him if he was a killer.\n\n\nRex and Gigi, on another date, entered the country club as guests of Bo and Nora. Rex reminisced about sneaking into the club and getting caught and arrested. Gigi asked who he was with, to which Rex replied that he had been with Stacy. He related that she had brought back the \"bad boy\" in Rex, \"and the crazy in me,\" added Gigi. Gigi informed Rex that she had recently seen Sierra Rose, who looked a lot like Stacy. Rex was glad that the sisters could make up before Stacy died. Talking about the country club, Gigi thought it was \"too civilized for a bad boy.\" Rex said that he had turned into a new man since getting Gigi back into his life.\n\n\nJust then, Kelly wandered over and asked Rex if he had received her text message, which he hadn't. Kelly was wondering if he had any luck searching for Bennett Thompson. Rex explained that there were over two thousand men by that name in the United States. He started researching the ones closest to where Melinda was killed in California. He would make his way east starting the next day. Kelly thanked him and left. As Rex got a sweatshirt for Gigi, she asked him if he missed his old life. He didn't because he had her. The pair walked away with their arms around each other.\n\n\nBlair asked a waiter at the country club if he had seen Elijah. He directed her to a cabana. As Elijah was insulting Ford, Blair entered, wondering what she walked in on. Assuming Elijah was tearing into Ford out of jealousy, Blair told Elijah that he had nothing to worry about. Ford and Elijah made sure that they were on the same page, and Ford left.\n\n\nAs Elijah started to talk about marriage, his phone rang. On the other end, Hannah begged Elijah to be her lawyer, to which Elijah agreed. He promised to meet her at the station and hung up. Getting back to their previous conversation, Blair explained that she liked Elijah a lot, but wasn't ready to get married yet. Elijah understood, which prompted Blair to say that he was too good to be true. Suddenly, the pair heard fireworks and ran out of the cabana.\n\n\nIn Maryland, Hannah wondered if she had to wear the handcuffs the entire ride back to Llanview. John promised that he would take them off for the ride. Hannah swore to Cole that everything she did was for him, and John and Natalie led her out of the motel.\n\n\nJessica began to tell Brody about what had happened with Ford after the prom. She rationalized that after being upset about Cristian, she wanted to be wanted. Brody asked if she had sex with Ford. She assured Brody that she hadn't. He wasn't mad and wondered why she hadn't told him sooner. Jessica summarized that she had pushed Ford away, but didn't remember leaving. Because of that, she thought that she, Tess, or Bess could have been the one to hurt Ford. She had even gone to Dr. Levin to find possible evidence of the presence of one of her personalities.\n\n\nAfter Jessica found out that Hannah had been named as the attacker, she just didn't want to think about what had happened. Brody wondered what had changed her mind. She was very ashamed that she had almost cheated on Brody and felt very wrong about it. As Brody thought about his encounter with Natalie that same night, Jessica told him about how she didn't like to keep secrets from him because he didn't deserve that. Just then, Ford walked by and Brody pounced on him and put him in a headlock. Jessica told Brody to let Ford go after she explained that nothing was Ford's fault. Brody let him go after warning Ford to stay away from Jessica. \"Not a problem,\" replied Ford.\n\n\nAt the country club, all in attendance watched the fireworks overhead. Kelly smiled at Elijah and Blair. Ford exchanged a look with Elijah, then with Jessica.\n\n\nStarr wondered what Todd was doing at the barn, but was happy to see him. As Dani sneaked past them, Starr said she was glad that Todd found \"us.\" Todd wondered who she was with. Starr, after quickly going over the happenings of the past few days, told Todd that if Bull saw Todd, the deal would be off. She told her father to let James handle things. Todd had no idea who she was talking about, and said that he thought he was helping Nate. A confused Starr thought Todd was there to help her. Starr said that the money belonged to James and that Todd should leave the area.\n\n\nInside the barn, Bull pointed his gun at James and asked about the money. James explained that he would go back to Ohio with Bull and work off the debt. Bull threatened to shoot him, but James knew he was worth more than fifty thousand dollars to his father. As Dani reached Nate and untied him, Nate bumped into something. Hearing the sound, Bull pushed James toward the sound to investigate.\n\n\nJames found Nate, tied up, and asked who he was. Bull replied that it was the guy who stole James's money as the two walked back to the front of the barn to find Todd. As Todd bargained for the release of Nate, Starr entered and said that she wasn't leaving without James. Bull said he wanted the money, but Todd wanted to see Nate first. As Dani and Nate tried to figure out how to get out of the barn without being seen, Todd attempted to negotiate in a way that left everyone unhurt.\n\n\nStarr suggested that they call James's father, but James swore that he could handle his dad. Todd explained that if Bull had kids, he would know that \"the last person you want to piss off is your daughter.\" As Todd tried to get both Nate and James released safely, Nate walked up behind Bull and raised a shovel.\n\n\nAs Nate hit Bull in the back, Bull shot his gun, hitting a light and plunging the group into darkness. Nate hit him again, knocking the gun out of his hands. Everyone scrambled and fought in the dark as both Todd and Starr wielded guns. Both shot them. Todd's shot hit Bull, as Starr's shot hit a collapsing James.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dani hides in Todd's vehicle unseen in order to save Nate from Bull. Todd has the money for Bull but he still wants to kill people. Meanwhile, John is ready to arrest Hannah for the assault of Ford and for killing Marty's baby. But she protests she did not do it. When then see that Ford has falsely accused her. The assailant is Eli. Ford tells Eli if he threatens him, then Ford can make trouble for him by exposing him as Bennett Thompson, the suspect who may have killed Kelly's mother and other crimes. At that point, Blair reveals to Kelly that Eli has proposed to her. They both believe that Eli is a great man and have no suspicion about him. And when Hannah is at the police station in need of legal representation and has no clue who framed her for assaulting Ford, she calls Eli and asks him to represent her.",
