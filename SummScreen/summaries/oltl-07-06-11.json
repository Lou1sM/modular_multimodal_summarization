Nora told Matthew that reading was supposed to stimulate the brain, so she wanted to read A Tale of Two Cities to him. As Nora editorialized throughout her reading, Matthew envisioned Nate punching him. He struggled to speak to his mother.\n\n\nDestiny held the pregnancy test, but quickly hid it when Dani entered. After Dani pestered Destiny, Destiny reluctantly showed Dani the box. Destiny admitted that she had lied about using protection with Matthew. Destiny admitted that she hadn't yet taken the test, but stopped talking when Bo entered. Bo expressed his appreciation that the girls had spent so much time at the hospital. They told him that they were Matthew's friends, so they wanted to be there.\n\n\nWhen Bo was gone, Destiny figured that she wasn't even pregnant. Destiny had only bought the test because Starr had \"freaked me out.\" She lamented the wasted money. Dani suddenly remembered that she was supposed to meet Nate for lunch soon at his new job. However, she offered to stay with Destiny while Destiny took the test. Destiny didn't want to take the test. Dani instructed that Destiny call her if Destiny changed her mind, because it was better to know.\n\n\nJames voiced his suspicions about Baz to Deanna. Deanna thought he was jealous, but James insisted that he wasn't. Deanna's phone went off. She found a text message from Rick that said, \"Thought about my offer?\" She lied that she had to run an errand for James's mom. James wanted to see how things were going with Starr and Baz anyway. The two went their separate ways.\n\n\nNate was straightening up the landscaping in a public park when Rick walked up to him. Rick insisted that Nate and Deanna would make a nice couple, but Nate refused to do Rick's movie. Rick threatened to tell Bo and Nora about Nate putting Matthew in the hospital. Nate knew that Matthew had been doing better, so he believed that it was only a matter of time before Matthew said something anyway. Rick told Nate to call if he changed his mind, and walked away.\n\n\nDeanna bumped into Nate, and he told her that he'd refused Rick's offer. Nate didn't want Deanna involved in his problem anymore. She offered her help with anything he needed, and hugged him. Dani appeared, and Nate explained that he'd been thanking Deanna for a favor she'd done for Inez. Recognizing that Dani didn't want Deanna there, Deanna left for work. \"What the hell, Nate?\" Dani yelled once Deanna was gone. She demanded to know whether or not Nate was cheating on her with Deanna.\n\n\nNate insisted that he only cared about Dani. She wondered what he had been talking about with Deanna, but he explained that it was Deanna's business. Dani told Nate that she was his girlfriend, so he couldn't keep secrets from her. He accused her of keeping secrets, which she denied. When he reminded her of the secret she'd been keeping with Destiny, Dani feigned confusion. Nate yelled at a shocked Dani that she had known that Matthew had killed Eddie, and hadn't told Nate.\n\n\nBaz was loudly playing his music in Capricorn when Starr and Hope entered. When Starr finally managed to get his attention, he gestured to Hope and asked, \"What's that?\" Starr explained that the baby was her daughter. Baz determined that Hope could help. He went behind the bar and got a maraca and a tambourine. Hope happily shook the maraca.\n\n\nStarr remarked that Hope wasn't usually good with strangers, but Hope seemed to like Baz. She related that Hope had problems with James, most likely because she missed Cole. She revealed to a shocked Baz that Cole was in prison. Baz wanted to get to work, so he went back to his computer. He handed Starr a microphone. He instructed her to sing anything into it, and he would put it together with his beats. As she sang to Hope, her voice mesmerized Baz.\n\n\n\"I've heard worse,\" Baz told Starr, snapping out of the trance. Starr remembered saying the same thing to him after she'd heard his music for the first time. Baz played back the singing with a beat behind it, as Hope shook her maraca. James entered in time to see the three laughing together. Clearly disappointed, he left. Baz and Starr agreed that they'd both had fun. \"I've heard worse,\" they said in unison, and laughed.\n\n\nA woman affiliated with the hospital handed Gigi's personal effects to Rex. She wondered if he'd picked a funeral home for Gigi's body to be sent to. He grabbed Gigi's dress, and walked away to look for Shane.\n\n\nIn Clint's room, Viki was grateful that Clint was going to live. Suddenly, Shane entered the room. \"Why do you get to live,\" he demanded, \"when my mom had to die?\" He continued that he and his parents hadn't been good enough for Clint while Gigi had been alive, but Clint could \"use us for spare parts.\" He spat that Clint wasn't good enough for Gigi's heart, and that Clint didn't deserve to live.\n\n\nRex entered the room and tried to usher Shane out. Shane refused to go anywhere with Rex. In order to calm Shane down, Viki led him out of the room. Clint accused Rex of selling Gigi's heart to get rich. Rex said that his father could believe what he wanted, but Shane had been right -- Clint didn't deserve to live.\n\n\nRex walked out of the room and found Viki comforting Shane. She tearfully assured Shane that she had loved Gigi as well, but that things would get easier. She related that her time spent with Gigi and Shane in Texas had been among the happiest times of her life. Shane thanked her, and Viki went back into Clint's room. Rex sat with Shane, and decided that Shane deserved to know why Rex had given Gigi's heart to Clint. He promised to tell Shane everything when they returned home, so the two left.\n\n\nViki couldn't blame Shane for lashing out after all he had been through. Clint agreed, but related that Shane and Rex would have all of Clint's money to cheer them up. Viki wanted to know why Rex had really wanted Clint's money. Clint answered that Rex was a \"gold-digging son of a bitch.\" Viki urged him to get past his hatred, because she'd hate to see him waste his second chance at life.\n\n\nClint wondered what kind of life he'd have, since he'd \"confessed to, well, everything.\" Bo entered, amazed that Clint had \"beat the reaper again.\" Clint asked about Matthew, and Bo replied that Matthew was doing well. Clint thought that Bo had forgotten about Clint's confessions. Viki made sure that Bo wouldn't do anything with Clint while Clint was recovering, and Bo agreed.\n\n\nViki didn't believe that Clint had murdered Eddie. Clint and Bo exchanged a solemn look, but it didn't get past Viki. She demanded to know what was going on, but Clint maintained his confession. Bo had to get back to Matthew, but promised to visit again. Clint told Bo to take care of Matthew, because he deserved a long, happy life. Bo left, and Viki confronted Clint about the look he'd shared with Bo.\n\n\nViki didn't believe that Clint had killed Eddie, and knew Bo didn't believe it either. She demanded to know who Clint was protecting. He urged her to let it go as she suggested that Nora had killed Eddie. Clint denied it, and begged that she leave it alone. As Clint pleaded with her to let it go, it dawned on Viki that Clint was protecting Matthew. Clint rationalized that Matthew needed to have a life. Viki refused to let Clint confess to something he hadn't done, because he would be wasting his second chance at life.\n\n\nNora pleaded with Matthew to stop trying to talk, because he was going to make himself sick. Suddenly, the machines around him began to beep wildly. Destiny burst into the room, and Nora ordered Destiny to find a doctor. Destiny obeyed, and ran out of the room as Rick entered the hall. Interested, he looked into Matthew's room.\n\n\nA short while later, Bo stepped off the elevator and found a frantic Destiny. She informed him that Matthew had suffered a seizure. He went into Matthew's room, and Nora said that she'd tried to calm Matthew down, but he was insistent on telling her something. The doctor examining Matthew asked Bo and Nora to step out of the room, so they did. Destiny wondered how Matthew was, but Bo and Nora admitted that they didn't know.\n\n\nDestiny called Dani, but only got her voicemail. She looked at her pregnancy test, and walked away toward the bathroom. Destiny took the test out of the box, and read the directions.\n\n\nThe doctor exited Matthew's room and found Bo and Nora. He apologized, and revealed that there was nothing more he could do for Matthew.\n\n\nAs Deanna walked through the park, she bumped into Rick. She told him that she'd seen Nate, who'd informed her that he'd refused Rick's movie offer. Rick confided that he'd been to the hospital, and Matthew had taken a turn for the worse. He added that he'd felt so bad for Matthew that he'd almost told Bo and Nora about Nate. He believed they had a right to know. He told Deanna that she knew how to reach him. He said that he wanted to start production on his movie as soon as possible, and walked away.\n\n\nJack relaxed by the pool, listening to music. Suddenly, a splash of water hit him. From behind the splash, Todd demanded to know what Jack was doing. Jack had agreed to work at the Sun for the summer. Jack informed his father that he'd changed his mind. Jack was distressed to be mentioned in an article about Gigi in the Banner. Jack read from the paper. When asked why Jack had been let go, John had been quoted as saying, \"You'll have to ask the kid's father.\" Jack continued that everyone would think he was guilty, as Blair entered.\n\n\nBlair wondered what Jack had been talking about. Todd explained that Jack was nervous that everyone would think he was responsible for Gigi's death. Blair asked if Jack was responsible, but Todd answered that John had no evidence, so no charges had been filed. Blair began to think that Todd had something to do with Jack's release. Todd told Jack to get changed for work, so he left.\n\n\nBlair wasn't surprised that Todd hadn't discussed Jack's new job with Blair, because he hadn't even told her that Jack had been arrested. She'd found out from T\u00e9a. Blair knew that Todd had done something he hadn't wanted her to know about. They were arguing about what should happen to Jack when Todd heard his car start. He ran towards the sound, but returned a short time later. His car was gone, so Blair suggested that they call the police. Todd suggested that, in addition to murder, Blair could turn their son in for grand theft auto as well.\n\n\nRex and Shane arrived at home, and the sight of Gigi's makeup, shoes, and jewelry on the front table saddened them. As Shane began to walk up the stairs, Rex wanted to explain why he'd given Gigi's heart to Clint. He explained what they'd gotten from Clint in return for the heart. Shane was disgusted that Rex had sold Gigi's heart for money. However, Rex insisted that he'd done it in order to protect Shane.\n\n\nRex told Shane that they could move into the Buchanan Mansion. However, Shane wanted to stay in the carriage house, because it was where Gigi had lived. Shane accused Rex of wanting to forget about Gigi. Rex countered that Gigi had been the love of his life, and that he'd never forget her. He wanted to remember and honor Gigi.\n\n\nRex explained that Jack had gotten away with murder because Todd was rich and powerful. He reasoned that Rex and Shane were now rich and powerful, so they had the means to make Jack pay for his crime. Shane replied that it wouldn't help them to get Gigi back. He asked if they could take Gigi's things with them to the mansion, to which Rex agreed.\n\n\nShane went upstairs, and returned a short while later with two large bags packed with stuff. Shane said that it was all of his clothes, and some of Gigi's. Rex assured Shane that they could return for the rest, or send someone for it. He hugged his son, and assured him that everything would turn out all right. Rex went upstairs to pack his things. Shane touched the dress that Gigi had been wearing when she died. There was a knock on the door. Shane was surprised to answer the door to Jack.\n\n\n",
