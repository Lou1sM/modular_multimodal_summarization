    "soap_central": "\nMeet The Krackoffs\n\n\nIn one of the chamber rooms in the Mendorran Royal Palace, Cris looked for clues that could lead him to Sarah and Talia, and Antonio placed a vague phone call to Carlotta, assuring her that he and Cris were fine. Cris was determined to locate the women and had no intention of awaiting further instructions from Jonas. Antonio was certain that they were somehow connected to the kidnappings in some way and that Jonas wasn't acting alone. Because Jonas had lured the Vega brothers and Talia to Mendorra, Antonio was suspicious and wondered what the connection to Sarah was. \n\n\nIn a dungeon located somewhere in the palace, Carlo introduced himself to Sarah and happily greeted Talia. With disgust in her voice, Talia told a shocked Sarah that Carlo Hesser was her father. Talia was unnerved when Carlo complimented her on the beautiful woman she had become and then compared her to her sister, Charlotte. Talia denied bearing any similarities to her psychotic sister and demanded to know how Carlo had managed to escape from Statesville prison. Laughing, Carlo told his daughter that Ramsey had executed a magnificent exit for him. Criticizing her father, Talia said that she was grateful that she had grown up far away from the Hesser clan. Carlo blamed Talia's mother for fleeing with her years earlier and depriving him of his favorite daughter. An angered Talia informed Carlo that she and her mother were terrified of him. She credited her mother for saving her life, by escaping from Carlo. When Talia said she was proud to bear the name Sahid, Carlo cursed her mother for turning Talia against him and running off and marrying Talia's stepfather, whom he referred to as an immigrant. Carlo mentioned the wonderful life they shared as a family before her mother left with Talia. Talia reminded Carlo that her siblings, Charlotte and Johnny Dee, were deranged and had terrorized her. With a big grin, Carlo stated that those experiences made her the woman that she was. \n\n\nFed up with Carlo's games, Sarah quipped that he should have left her out of his reunion plans. Turning his attention to Sarah, Carlo smirked as he mentioned how Sarah possessed obvious Buchanan traits. Carlo laughed at Dorian's success at taking over Buchanan Enterprises and asked Sarah if Tina had ever mentioned him before. Unaware of her mother's involvement with Carlo, Sarah was curious. Carlo called Tina a whore and said that he was nearly her grandfather. As a stunned Sarah listened, Carlo told her that Tina used Johnny Dee to reunite with Cord and later, with help from Viki, murdered Johnny. Talia attempted to ease Sarah's pain and told her that Viki killed Johnny while protecting Tina. Carlo told his daughter that her mother had brainwashed her, but insisted that she was in luck because he had taught her mother that craft. \n\n\nIn the palace, a flustered Tina told Cain about her horrific experiences in Llanview, but his only concern was the jewels. When Cain showed little interest in Sarah's kidnapping, Tina lashed out at him and stated he didn't care about Sarah's well-being at all. Cain assured Tina that he was concerned about her daughter, but didn't want anyone to steal the jewels from them. Tina asked if he meant the same way they had attempted to steal the jewels from the real royal family. Tina urged Cain to consider abdicating the throne; she said that they should cut their loses before it was too late. Cane insisted that he was Prince Helmutt Krackoff of Mendorra and that it was the best role he ever played in his life. Tina begged Cain to reconsider the scam and said that she didn't intend to lose her daughter in the process of perpetrating a fraud. Cain wondered when Tina had developed maternal instincts. She stated that spending time with Sarah and realizing that her daughter loved her made her re-think her priorities. Tina suggested that they turn themselves in and have Jonas arrested. Tina regretted her decision to run off with Cain, the master of disguises, and wondered if she should have stayed with Cord instead. Attempting to calm Tina's nerves, Cain began rubbing her feet. Cain promised to protect Sarah and also keep the jewels. He urged Tina to give him twenty-four hours to neutralize Jonas and save Sarah. Tina reluctantly agreed. Cain suggested that Tina freshen up and reached for the bag containing the jewels. Grabbing the bag from him, Tina reminded Cain that he would get the jewels as soon as she had her \"kid.\" \n\n\nAfter being unable to determine who was actually behind the kidnappings, Cris and Antonio were surprised to find armed guards outside of their room. The guards said that the brothers were to remain in their chambers until further notice. Antonio told the guards that they were guests of the princess and had been given full access to the entire palace. The guards informed the Vega brothers that the princess' authority wasn't absolute in Mendorra and proceeded to lock them inside their room. \n\n\nMeanwhile, back in the dungeon, Talia told Carlo that she became a cop in hopes of putting him behind bars and vowed to undo all the damage that he had done. Unmoved by Talia's anger, Carlo was adamant that she had always wished to be reunited with him and knew that they were connected emotionally. Hoping to bargain with Carlo, Talia offered her loyalty, and in return, she asked that Carlo release Sarah, Antonio, and Cris. Carlo informed Talia that everything wasn't about her. He said that he had gone through a great deal of trouble to bring Sarah and the Vega brothers to Mendorra and advised her that he had an agenda-one that also involved something special concerning her. Before leaving the women, Carlo welcomed them both to Mendorra. \n\n\nIn hopes of speaking with Marcie, Starr showed up at Michael and Marcie's apartment. Upon learning that Marcie was attending a wedding, Starr turned to leave but Michael suggested that they discuss her pregnancy. Mike asked Starr if her idea to allow the McBains to adopt her child was an attempt to hurt Todd. Starr claimed her decision had nothing to do with Todd; she assured Michael that she wanted to make things right and truly believed that the McBains were the best couple to raise her child. Mike asked Starr to realize the difficult position that she would be placing him and Marcie in. Mike said that it nearly destroyed them to lose Sam, and he didn't know if he and Marcie could handle losing another child to Todd. Starr said that Todd didn't know that she was pregnant and she didn't intend for him to ever find out. Mike was certain that someone would eventually tell Todd, but Starr didn't believe anyone was that insane. \n\n\nCole paid a visit to Todd at his new home. Todd told Cole to get lost, but Cole refused to leave and told him that Starr was in trouble. Intrigued, Todd allowed Cole entry. Cole announced that Starr was pregnant with his child. Initially, Todd accused Cole of lying but then attacked Cole. By reminding him that he would face jail time, Cole managed to convince Todd to release his grip from around Cole's neck. Todd  became further enraged when Cole informed him that Starr planned to give the baby to the McBains to raise. Todd couldn't believe any child of his would help Marcie. Cole said that Starr was afraid and needed the support of her family. Cole attempted to manipulate Todd by asking him if he would allow John's brother and the woman that kidnapped his son to raise his grandchild. Believing he had convinced Todd to react in his favor, Cole told Todd that he was the only person who could stop Starr from giving the child away. Abruptly, Todd kicked Cole out of his house. A frustrated Cole stood outside the door and said, \"Sorry Starr!\" \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora interrupted Bo and Lindsay's wedding and asked Bo to read the letter R.J. had written to Lindsay, citing that she was perfectly sane when she killed Spencer and then faked a breakdown to avoid prison. While Bo refused to accommodate Nora's request, Lindsay begged Nora to leave well enough alone. As Clint looked disapprovingly at Nora, she continued to plead with Bo to read the letter before he married Lindsay. An angered Bo reminded Nora that he was marrying the woman that he loved. Nora believed that he would change his mind after he read the contents of the letter. Nora insisted that she was acting out of concern for Bo and Matthew. \n\n\nRefusing to allow Nora to control the situation, Lindsay demanded that Nora give her the letter-she would read it, not Nora. When Lindsay read the letter and admitted that it was true, Bo was shattered. Afterward, Bo asked everyone to leave him alone with Lindsay. Lindsay tried to explain her reason for killing Spencer, but Bo was only concerned about the fact that she had lied to him. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Matthew blamed his mother for ruining Bo and Lindsay's happiness. Nora pleaded with Matthew to understand that she was only thinking of him. Matthew told his mother that he believed she did it to get back at his father and stormed out of the room. Surprised by Matthew's reaction, Nora attempted to convince Clint of her intentions. Clint stated that Bo was happy with Lindsay and believed she was responsible for him bouncing back after Asa's death. Nora was appalled that everyone appeared to have sympathy for Lindsay and insisted that she should be punished for her crimes. Clint wondered if Nora revealed the truth for her own benefit instead of Bo's. Before leaving the room, Clint told her that she should have left well enough alone. \n\n\nIn tears, Lindsay pleaded with Bo to realize how much she loved him and that all she wanted was for them both to experience some happiness. She said that she initially lied to protect herself, but later realized that Bo could never live with what she had done. When Bo asked if she could live with her past actions, Lindsay replied that she could and asked if Bo could find it in his heart to stay with her. Sadly, Bo responded that neither of them would ever know and walked away. As Bo passed Nora, she apologized but Bo replied, \"Save it!\" Nora entered the room and witnessed Lindsay sprawled out on the floor in tears. Lindsay looked up at her and asked, \"Are you happy now?\" In disgust, Nora shook her head and walked away. \n\n\nBefore leaving the apartment, Starr asked Mike to talk the matter over with Marcie one last time. Starr ran into Marcie out in the hall. Starr told Marcie that she had discussed the adoption with Mike. Starr mentioned that she believed Marcie had changed her mind about the adoption, after seeing her with her lawyer. Marcie wondered if Starr had mentioned her meeting with the lawyer to Mike. Immediately, Starr jumped to the conclusion that Marcie decided to adopt her baby. Starr hugged Marcie and thanked her. Marcie warned Starr that she was far from saying yes to the adoption, but Starr was thankful that Marcie was considering the idea.\n\n\n",

Nora gets Lindsay to read the letter to Bo about how she (Lindsay) faked a nervous breakdown in order to get away with murdering Spencer Truman.
