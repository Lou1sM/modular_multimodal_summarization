Dorian changed the subject and caught Blair off-guard when she asked if Blair and Eli were considering marriage.\n\n\nNearby, a scantily clad David sat in a chaise lounge, in between Viki and Charlie.  He told tales of his past with Viki that she had to continually correct.  Finally, Charlie bluntly asked David to go away just as Dorian arrived to share the good news about their project having been awarded the grant.  David and Dorian sniped at each other while Viki and Charlie celebrated his good fortune.  As David and Dorian continued to argue, Viki announced that she had a job to offer David: style editor for the Banner.\n\n\nDavid and Dorian continued to spar until he grabbed a pitcher of water from a passing waiter and dumped it over her head.  Viki tried her best to stifle her laughter and went to Charlie's side so that they could observe David and Dorian's antics.  They realized that David and Dorian were obviously refusing to admit to themselves that they'd never stopped loving each other.  Charlie told Viki that he had a plan to push the wayward lovers back into each other's arms.\n\n\nT\u00e9a, sprawled out on the floor of her suite, began to regain consciousness.  She made her way to the phone and dialed Todd but lost consciousness again.  Blair stopped by to check on T\u00e9a and knocked on the door.  Hearing no response, she was about to leave when T\u00e9a tried to get to the door and knocked over a lamp.  Blair got the hotel manager to open the door and told him to call 9-1-1.\n\n\nTodd, Starr, and James were in the barn with Bull.  Dani and Nate sneaked in, and Nate grabbed a shovel and hit Bull over the head.  As Bull fell back, he squeezed off a shot from his revolver, which shattered the light bulb.  In the dark, a scuffle broke out, and Bull's gun was kicked under a wagon wheel.\n\n\nAs Bull and Todd struggled, Todd's gun went off and killed Bull.  At the same time, Starr had retrieved Bull's pistol and shot at Bull, but the bullet hit James, who fell to the floor.  Todd examined James and noted that he had lost a lot of blood.  Todd and Nate carried James to the car to drive him to the hospital.\n\n\nThey all arrived at the hospital, and James was rushed into a trauma room.  Todd advised Starr to say nothing, not until he said it was okay.  She promised him that she'd keep mum and went to check on James.  Todd expressed his anger at Dani for following him to the meeting with Bull.  He told Nate that, because Nate had stolen the money, he was at fault for James's shooting.  Nearly hysterical, Starr was asked to leave the trauma room.\n\n\nAfter the police finished questioning Todd, Nate attempted to thank him, but Todd wouldn't have it.  Todd began to go to T\u00e9a to tell her what had happened, but Dani stopped him.  She said she'd tell her mother how amazing he had been.\n\n\nTodd left and Starr emerged from the trauma room.  She attacked Nate and asked him how he could have taken the money James had stolen.  Dani defended Nate by explaining that it had been just as much her fault as anyone else's.  Dani told Starr that she had convinced Nate to give the money to his mother so that she could pay their mortgage.  As Starr began to cry, Dani comforted her.\n\n\nLater, Starr went to James's bedside and begged him to pull through.  As she began to break down, James came to and asked if there were onions in the room, \"'cuz there's no way you're crying over me.\"\n\n\nBlair and T\u00e9a arrived at the hospital.  T\u00e9a, who was in and out of consciousness, was wheeled into the Emergency Room.  Greg met them and examined her.  He told Blair that T\u00e9a's white blood count was low and that her immune system was compromised.  He ordered a battery of tests.  Greg left, and T\u00e9a asked Blair to call Todd.\n\n\nIn the hallway, Blair ran into Todd and wondered how he'd found out about T\u00e9a so soon.  Todd expressed ignorance, and Blair filled him in on the situation.  Todd went to T\u00e9a and Blair went to see Starr.\n\n\nBlair asked her daughter for an explanation, but Starr replied that she'd tell the whole story later.  She did, however, admit that she had shot someone.  The doctor emerged from the trauma room and told Starr that James needed to be stabilized before they could operate to stop his internal bleeding.  Blair asked Dani for the details as Greg arrived with news on T\u00e9a's condition, which caught Dani off-guard.\n\n\nWith Todd by T\u00e9a's side, Greg told them that she was suffering from a bad infection but that, with antibiotics, she should bounce back in a few days.  Todd asked Greg snide questions about T\u00e9a's treatment, but T\u00e9a shut him down and asked him to just be supportive of her.  After Greg left, Todd and T\u00e9a shared a tender moment.\n\n\nT\u00e9a voiced her thought that Dani might begin to at least tolerate Todd, and he replied that they could have had a breakthrough that night.  Not wanting to burden T\u00e9a with the details of the night's events, Todd tried to stall.  But Dani burst into the room and demanded to know what was going on.  Todd tried to cover, but T\u00e9a decided that it was time for Dani to know the truth.\n\n\nNate approached Blair and asked if Dani was okay.  Blair assured him that everything would work out and offered to give him a ride home.  He declined and said he'd rather wait for Dani.  Blair waited with him and lamented that he'd been responsible for everything that had gone down that night.\n\n\nRex and Gigi entered the cabana of a guest who Kelly had said was connected to Bennett Thompson.  Gigi was surprised to find the case that Rex had found at the quarry in the room.  She opened it up to find wine and cheese.\n\n\nThe Bennett Thompson connection had simply been a ruse by Rex to surprise Gigi with a romantic evening.  They reminisced about Independence Days past.  Rex told Gigi that he intended to woo her the way he should have in the past.  They shared an innocent evening of playing cards and talking before falling into each other's arms. \n\n\n",
