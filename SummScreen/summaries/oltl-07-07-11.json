The man became frustrated as he realized that \"that son of a bitch stole my life!\" He looked through Agent Kent's wallet, and regretted killing him. He needed someone to make sense of what was going on.\n\n\nThe man looked at Viki's biography on the site, as he remembered that he had a sister named Viki. He thought that he could \"trust her above all others.\" He wanted his life back, and thought that Viki could help him. He picked up his gun and Agent Kent's wallet, and vowed to find Viki.\n\n\nIn the bathroom, Destiny read the instructions for the pregnancy test. She just wanted to get it over with. A short while later, she walked out of a stall, and prayed for a negative result. She looked at the test, put it in her purse, and walked out of the bathroom.\n\n\nThe doctor told Bo and Nora that there was nothing else he could do for Matthew. Matthew needed a long-term rehabilitation facility that was specialized for cases like Matthew's. Nora didn't want to send Matthew far away from home, but the doctor informed her that the kind of facility Matthew needed was in nearby Philadelphia. He needed Bo and Nora to give him a yes or no as soon as possible, and he walked away to let them talk.\n\n\nNora knew that she and Bo had to send Matthew to the facility. She just didn't want to leave him in Philadelphia alone. Bo insisted that one of them could be at Matthew's side every day, so he would never be alone. Bo assured his wife that soon, Matthew would be sitting up and talking, ready to go home.\n\n\nDestiny entered and asked about Matthew. Bo explained that the seizure had set Matthew back, but there was a place in Philadelphia that could help him. He and Nora would see Matthew every day, and he invited Destiny to join them. She asked to see Matthew alone so she could say goodbye, and she went into Matthew's room.\n\n\nIn Matthew's room, Destiny wondered if he could hear her. \"I'm pregnant,\" she confessed. She admitted that she was scared, and didn't know what to do. She would never be sorry that they had been together. She couldn't believe that the test had read positive. Nora entered the room, and wondered what was positive.\n\n\nDestiny lied that she was positive that Matthew was going to the rehab facility. Bo entered and excitedly told Nora that the hospital could move Matthew to the rehab center that day. Destiny left the room to leave Matthew with his parents. Nora promised that she and Bo would always be there for Matthew.\n\n\nNate demanded to know why Dani hadn't told her about Matthew killing Eddie. She wondered how he'd found out. He admitted that he'd heard Dani and Destiny talking. He didn't know how she could keep a secret like that from him. She'd wanted to tell Nate, but Destiny had begged Dani not to tell anyone. Nate took that as Dani choosing Destiny over him. Dani admitted that Destiny had been afraid of what Nate would do to Matthew if Nate found out.\n\n\nDani claimed to know what Nate had done after finding out about Matthew. A scared Nate wondered what Dani thought he'd done. She was offended that Nate had turned to Deanna. She wondered when she and Nate had stopped telling each other things. She asked Nate if they could forget about what had happened. Dani knew she should have said something about Matthew. Nate was about to add to the conversation, but Dani's phone went off with a message from Destiny. Nate insisted that she go. \"You're the best,\" she said, and left.\n\n\nNate looked through the pictures on his camera, and stopped on one of him and Dani. He promised that he would someday tell her about what he'd done to Matthew.\n\n\nA short while later, Dani ran into the hospital and found Destiny. She wondered what had happened, and Destiny told her friend that she had decided to take the pregnancy test. Dani thought that it was the smart thing to do, and ushered her friend towards the bathroom. Destiny admitted that she'd already taken the test. To Dani's curiosity, Destiny lied that the test had turned out to be negative.\n\n\nEcho asked Ionia if she was ready to work. Ionia admitted that working with David didn't feel like work to her. Echo advised Ionia to kick her performance into \"high gear.\"\n\n\nDorian arrived in front of Clint's room with a plant in hand, as Viki exited the room. Viki revealed that she knew that Dorian had been the reason Clint had almost died. Dorian believed that she had been the reason for Clint's survival. Viki thought that Clint wouldn't have confessed to various crimes if he hadn't thought he was dying. Viki was disgusted that Dorian thought Clint's confessions were \"justice served.\" Dorian added that she'd decided to save Clint because of Viki.\n\n\nViki finally realized how Dorian had obtained the recording of Echo. Viki feared that using the recording against Echo had only worsened a bad situation. Dorian thought that Echo couldn't hurt them, because Echo was just a drunk. However, the lack of a thank-you made Dorian vow not to try to help Viki again. Viki said she'd give the plant to Clint, but Dorian dropped it in the trash instead, and left.\n\n\nBlair yelled at Todd to call if Jack returned, because she was going to look for Jack. David entered as Blair left, and asked Todd what was wrong with Blair. Todd told David that Jack had taken Todd's car. David observed that \"the felon doesn't fall far from the tree.\" Todd said he was tracking Jack, and left. David lounged on the couch next to the pool. However, Ionia interrupted his relaxation when she suddenly threw herself at him.\n\n\nDavid tried to stop Ionia, because he was a happily married man. As Echo took pictures from out of sight, Ionia threw her bikini top at David. David wrapped her in a towel, and demanded that she leave. David thought that Ionia was delusional, or setting him up. He demanded to know who she was working for, but she insisted that she was there for him. Thinking out loud, he listed his enemies -- Clint, and Tuc Watkins, who'd wanted the role of David Vickers in David's movie.\n\n\nDavid told her that it was time to go, so he shoved her things at her. Her phone went off, and she lied that it was her agent. She related that the meeting her agent had set up for her was the only thing that could tear her away from him. She left, but David realized that she'd left her bikini top on the ground. Dorian entered, and wondered who was speeding away from the house. David hid the top behind his back, and claimed that it was just the pool man.\n\n\nDorian needed a relaxing swim because of the bad day she'd had. They shared a kiss as David attempted to hide the bikini top from her. David's phone went off, which he said meant that there was something new posted on the internet about him. He looked at the posting, and tried to hide his phone from Dorian. She eventually got the phone, and saw a picture from earlier of David and Ionia. \"Stars caught in the act?\" she read disgustedly.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Viki was on her computer. She stumbled upon the picture of David and Ionia, and couldn't believe what she was seeing.\n\n\nEcho and Ionia met up and talked about their \"photo shoot.\" Echo knew that there would be \"fireworks,\" and regretted that they couldn't stay to watch the scene.\n\n\nTomas had just arrived at Capricorn when his phone rang. He informed the person on the other end that he had everything under control. He hadn't expected Baz to be living with him, but vowed that neither Baz nor Blair would present any problems.\n\n\nShane and Rex demanded to know why Jack was there. Jack was there to apologize for what had happened to Gigi. \"Is that a confession?\" Rex asked. Todd arrived, and directed Jack to stop talking, and go to work with Todd. Todd apologized for Rex and Shane's \"'loss,'\" but insisted that Jack had had nothing to do with it. Rex stopped the two from leaving, because he had something to say.\n\n\nRex apologized for going after Todd, and admitted that he believed Jack's apology. He knew that John wouldn't have let Jack go if John believed that Jack had had anything to do with the accident. He continued that all Gigi had wanted was peace between Jack and Shane, so he wanted to end the conflict. To Shane's shock and disgust, Rex held out his hand to Todd, who shook Rex's hand. Rex said that Gigi had been tough but fair, and had believed in giving people second chances. Todd and Jack left.\n\n\nShane wondered how Rex could forgive Jack and Todd. Rex informed his son that he hadn't meant a word of what he'd said, except for what he'd said about Gigi. He wanted the Mannings to relax, and think that the conflict was over. \"Jack and Todd will never see us coming,\" he added.\n\n\nBlair arrived at Capricorn, clearly angry. Tomas appeared, and wondered what was going on. He admitted that he'd read the paper, so he knew all about Jack. He wanted her to talk to him. She wondered why she should be open and honest with him, when he wasn't with her. She related that following him to New York had been the only way she could get a straight answer out of him. They both wondered what to do, but Tomas kissed her.\n\n\nTomas admitted that he cared a lot about her, but understood if she didn't want to tell him everything. He swore that he was trying his best to let her into his life. She wondered what was stopping him, to which he replied that it was complicated. He wondered what her plans for the next day were.\n\n\nA short while later, Jack wondered why Todd had taken him to Capricorn. Todd wanted to show Blair that Jack was all right. He warned Jack not to tell Blair where they had been. He told Jack to be careful, because a confession to anyone could mean prison for Jack. He knew that Jack didn't understand how lucky he was. He recognized that Rex and Shane were moving on, and urged Jack to do the same.\n\n\n",
