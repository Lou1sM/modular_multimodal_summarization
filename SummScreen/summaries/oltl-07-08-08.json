    "soap_central": "\nHome Is Where The Broken Heart Is\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian awoke to find herself in bed with David Vickers-the dog, not the man! Addie entered upon hearing Dorian's appalled screams and joked, \"I should've known you'd try to get David Vickers into your bed.\" After Addie scooped up \"Princess David Vickers,\" the other David entered in nothing but a towel. Dorian and David traded insults and Dorian asked him not to go traipsing around her home in a towel, leading David to promptly strip off. Dorian tried to appeal to Addie's sense of reason about her new husband, but Addie ignored her pleas and left with \"Princess David.\" Alone (and with David having re-donned his towel), David and Dorian continued to argue, and Dorian asked what it would take for David to stop torturing her and leave. \"'Torture' is a four-letter word in this political climate,\" David replied reproachfully, and told Dorian he would only leave if she paid him what he was owed for their arrangement regarding the Jared Banks secret and the Buchanan Enterprises takeover. Otherwise, he said he would leave, and take Addie, his new wife, with him, never to be seen again. David blasted Dorian for turning on him, but Dorian countered that he'd done it first, by sympathizing with Viki and caring for her even after Viki had mocked their relationship several weeks earlier. \"Honor me,\" Dorian exclaimed, seething with jealousy. \"Not Viki!\" She guilt-tripped David about his marriage to Addie, asking what Viki would think, and then hustled him out of her bedroom, slamming the door behind him. \n\n\nTess, posing as Jessica, arrived at Llanfair with Bree in her arms. Viki was thrilled when Tess announced that she and Bree were moving in, hoping to get away from the memories of Nash and the vineyard. Viki bemoaned the loss of Nash and Jessica's dream, and ushered Tess and Bree inside, with Tess murmuring softly to her daughter that the vineyard was really \"Nash and Tess's dream.\" In Viki's room, Tess told Viki that she had \"forgiven\" Natalie, a revelation that both shocked and pleased her mother. Viki asked if perhaps \"Jessica\" was rushing things with Natalie and Jared, to which Tess quickly replied, \"We're not you and Charlie.\" Then, she apologized for her brusque attitude, and said she felt it was important that her \"twin\" bond to Natalie not be broken even in the face of an incredible tragedy. As Viki left to prepare breakfast, Tess took in her mother's bedroom with disgust. \"Flowered wallpaper,\" she cracked. \"Kill me now.\" After breakfast, Viki told \"Jess\" how proud she was of her for forgiving Natalie, and said that she felt things would start getting better from there on in. With a moment to herself, Tess eyed Viki's framed portrait of Jessica and Natalie, and placed it facedown, saying that Viki should only see what she had in store for Natalie and Jared soon. \n\n\nAt the gallery, Lindsay opened her door only to come face-to-face with Nora and a phalanx of Llanview police officers. As Nora and the police entered, Lindsay told Nora she couldn't arrest her due to \"double jeopardy,\" as Lindsay had already been tried for the murder of Spencer Truman. Nora said Lindsay was wrong, and that the mitigating factors of new evidence and Lindsay's lie to her judge from the competency hearing left her vulnerable to re-prosecution. Relishing in her duty, Nora told Lindsay that she was under arrest for murder. Lindsay shot back that nobody had cared that she'd killed Spencer, but Nora said that wasn't the issue; she reminded Lindsay that she had been willing to let Marty rot in jail while she herself was the culprit, and that Lindsay's self-serving \"insanity\" had put her family and friends, like Will and Marcie, through hell. Lindsay said she'd done it all for Spencer's victims, but Nora wasn't hearing her. She ranted about Lindsay conning Bo, working her relationship with him to her advantage, swanning around town with him like a decent person. Lindsay seized on that, saying that Bo was the real reason Nora wanted her put away, not Spencer: \"You still want him!\" She said Nora couldn't take the idea of Bo moving on from her, especially with someone like her old nemesis. Nora replied that she didn't want Bo, just justice. \"Watching you free was eating me alive,\" she snapped, and said she couldn't stomach the thought of Lindsay as Matthew's stepmother. She admitted she took great pleasure in Lindsay finally getting what Nora felt she deserved, and said that justice was finally served. With that, the officers handcuffed Lindsay, ready to take her in. \n\n\nAt Bo's apartment, Bo was drunk and disorderly on \"the morning after,\" refusing to answer his door until Rex continued to nag him from outside. When he finally let Rex in, Rex tried to get Bo's bottle of booze away from him and told his \"best friend\" he understood his pain, having gone through a similar betrayal with Adriana. Bo asked who Adriana had killed in cold blood, the way Lindsay had with Spencer. Rex said he was sorry someone had caused Bo such heartache, but Bo couldn't decide who it was that had done him the most wrong: Nora or Lindsay? The inebriated cowboy ruminated on all he'd lost in the past year-Asa, his job at the LPD, Buchanan Enterprises, and Lindsay-and said he had to be foolish to have been tricked by her again. Bo wondered if he was as incompetent as Mayor Lowell had claimed. Rex said that Adriana had pulled the wool over his eyes, too, and that despite their being a cop and a P.I., respectively, they had both been fools for love. Bo admitted he'd sensed something \"off\" about Lindsay in the recent months, but that he hadn't wanted Nora to be right. He thanked Rex for his friendship and loyalty, and asked him to go for the time being. Rex complied, leaving Bo alone to sadly listen to Lindsay's endless voice mail messages, which he ignored as he staggered off to bed. \n\n\nAt the diner, Jared and Natalie arrived for lunch, preoccupied over Charlie and Jessica. Natalie was overjoyed that \"Jessica\" had forgiven her, but Jared said he still felt responsible for what had happened to Nash, and that he would spend the rest of his life trying to atone to Jess. Gigi arrived to take their orders, and revealed that she had become a waitress at the diner, having quit Cramer Enterprises. When the subject of the takeover came up, Gigi said she couldn't judge Jared and Natalie, and that she understood the weight of a heavy burden like theirs. After Gigi left them alone, Jared and Natalie wondered how they could start over. Jared promised Natalie that they would make things right with her family, and they kissed, as Tess watched them from outside the window. \n\n\nCharlie and Roxy arrived at Rodi's, determined to find clues to his \"lost evening\" just before the BE takeover. They ran into the bartender who had found Charlie in the alley weeks earlier, and Charlie begged the man for clues as to how he had become so ill. The bartender was disgusted with Charlie's \"denial\" of responsibility for his actions, but Charlie swore he couldn't remember his first drink, which he always remembered with crystal clarity. \"He's like the 'Rain Man' of drunks,\" Roxy chimed in. The bartender said that wherever Charlie had started his drinking, it hadn't been at Rodi's; he had never served him that night, and the bar had been closed for a private bachelor party. Charlie and Roxy puzzled over this new information, and decided to try mentally retracing Charlie's steps before his blackout. When Charlie hit a blank after arguing with Dorian at the hospital on the night of Adriana's accident, Roxy suggested to Charlie that maybe Dorian Lord knew more about his \"lost night\" than she was telling. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian and Addie argued over Addie's marriage to David, and Addie insisted David wasn't using her; \"we're using each other.\" She said Dorian was just jealous, and reminded her sister that Madame Delphina had foretold a happy marriage for them. While on the subject of Delphina, Addie asked Dorian why the ghost of Mel had been so upset with Dorian when Delphina channeled him. Dorian grew uptight and changed the subject, and Addie exited to go play with David Vickers-\"the dog, not the man.\" Before Dorian could finish getting dressed, she was confronted by Charlie, who stormed in, demanding answers to his questions. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki went through her drawers and found her old Bon Jour Cafe uniform, causing her to remember her first meeting with Charlie. Wrestling with emotions, Viki wandered through her room, and then noticed that her portrait of Natalie and Jessica had been turned face down. Just then, an anxious David arrived, reluctant to spill his big news to his friend: He was married. \n\n\nAt the Diner, Rex met up with Jared and Natalie and spilled the beans about the wedding fiasco with Bo and Lindsay. Spotting Gigi behind the counter, he rushed over to her, anxious to talk. He was pleased to see she'd found work again after the takeover, and explained the Bo situation to her, invoking the parallel of his own interrupted wedding to Adriana, although Bo hadn't gone through with his marriage. \"You did,\" Gigi reminded him. Rex said they needed to talk about what had happened on his own wedding day, and said he'd never responded to her declaration of love. \"Maybe it's time I did.\" \n\n\nAt their booth, Jared and Natalie continued to look at apartment listings, only to be surprised by Tess standing beside them. Tess greeted the lovebirds and asked Natalie to move back into Llanfair-with her. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nora goes to arrest Lindsay. Bo is alone in his apartment drinking and very upset over being betrayed by Lindsay. Rex tries to reach him and tells him he won't give up on him. Charlie finds out that he did not go to Rodi's to drink on the night when he passed out there. And he puts two and two together that Dorian might have set him up. And he goes to confront her. Jessica is now Tess, scheming to make Viki and Natalie both believe that she wants to live in Llanfair with the whole family. But what she really wants is revenge upon Jared and Natalie. Passions",
