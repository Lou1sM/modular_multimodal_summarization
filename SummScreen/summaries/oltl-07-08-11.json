When Natalie realized that Brody was deep in thought, she indicated that she knew that Brody was thinking about Gigi.  Natalie stated that she would attend the funeral for Rex and Shane, but that she regretted that she would be unable to attend with Brody, as a couple.  When Brody asked if she had told Jessica about them, Natalie claimed that she had not yet had the chance due to Clint's surgery.\n\n\nIn John's office at the station, as John looked at a mug shot of Todd, Officer Haskins pulled Vimal through the door for a traffic violation of the failure to signal.  After the officer left, John requested information on Todd, and Vimal feared that John wanted to enlist him for John's vendetta against Todd.  John stressed that there was no vendetta, because John was a cop, and Todd was a sociopath.\n\n\nOnce John realized that Todd had either promised Vimal something or had threatened him, he related to Vimal that Todd was all talk.  John insisted that Vimal tell him what John should know and also why Todd did not want John to know it.  However, Vimal claimed that he had been drunk that night and could not remember what it had been.  John said that if Vimal remembered it, he would know where to find John.\n\n\nAfter Vimal and John walked into the lobby, John informed Brody that he needed to see Brody.  Vimal ran out of the lobby.  Once John escorted Brody into the office, John revealed that Natalie had told him that she and Brody were together, and that Brody and Natalie wanted to have a family with Liam.  John insisted that he would not be a problem for them.  Brody agreed that he would not have a problem working with John, and John announced that he had arranged a task force to investigate Todd Manning.  John revealed that Vimal knew something about Todd and declared that if they got Patel, they would get Manning.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, as Viki glanced at the headline, \"Vickers in her Knickers,\" in the Sun, she drank her coffee.  The man with the scar, who looked remarkably like the original Todd, peered through the window at her. When Todd called Viki and asked her how the Banner was, Viki claimed that it was doing very well, thank you, and added that she did not need sleaze to sell papers; she also did not have to contend with libel suits, such as the one that David would start.  Todd insisted that Dorian would kill David first, before he ever got the chance to begin a lawsuit.\n\n\nOutside, the man with the scar recollected that he had a sister named Viki, whom he could trust above all others.  The man reached for the doorknob, but Jessica yelled for her mother, which stopped the man.  When Viki asked if Jessica would pay her respects to Rex and Shane, Jessica indicated that although she and Rex had not gotten along, she did not want to prevent Ryder and Bree from having a relationship with their uncle.  Viki asked if Jessica's kindness could stretch for Natalie also.\n\n\nJessica pointed out that while Rex had acted out of grief, Natalie had acted out of an itch that she had needed to scratch.  Viki reminded Jessica that Jess had forgiven others for much worse reasons in the past.  As he listened in, the man with the scar then remembered that he had a niece named Jessica.  Viki announced that she was leaving to visit Jessica's brother, Rex, and to mourn Gigi.  After Viki and Jessica exited the living room, the man opened the door and walked in.\n\n\nAfter Viki had left, Natalie found Jessica in the lobby of Llanfair and asked if they could have a talk.  When Jessica stated that she was on her way to the Buchanan mansion, Natalie pleaded with Jessica to talk later.  The man with the scar looked at the pictures in the living room and stated out loud that he did have a sister.\n\n\nTodd walked into his office at the Sun and found Jack at his computer.  Todd kicked Jack out of his chair and saw that Jack had been reading the Banner article about Gigi's death.  Todd insisted that Jack quit reading about Gigi, and to just forget about it.  Todd reminded Jack that he had covered for Jack, and that if Jack confessed, John would nail them both.\n\n\nTodd stressed that he was the only person that Jack could trust.  Todd heard his computer beep and glanced at the screen.  He yelled and swooped all of the paperwork off of his desk.  Todd screamed that a Japanese company had stolen his company right out from under him.  Vimal then ran into the room.\n\n\nVimal announced that John McBain had just detained him.  Todd ordered Jack to photocopy every page of a thick manual, and once Jack had left, asked Vimal to tell him everything.  Vimal insisted that he had told John nothing, because he had claimed to have been drunk the previous night.  Todd asked Vimal to call him the next time Vimal crossed paths with John, and Vimal felt that Todd could save himself a lot of trouble, if Todd told John the secret.  Jack reentered the room and asked if John had told Vimal what he had done.  After Todd denied it, Jack pondered what the secret was that Todd had kept from \"McPain.\"\n\n\nBack at the police station, Brody flew into John's office and announced that the cops had followed Vimal to the Sun, and that Vimal had used a parking pass.  John realized that Vimal worked for Todd.  John revealed that he had been reviewing the evidence in Gigi's case, and that he had discovered that something was missing.  John showed Brody a picture of the tape recorder and asked if it looked familiar.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Blair demanded to know how T\u00e9a could have helped Blair's son get away with murder.  When Blair insisted that T\u00e9a had covered up Jack's role in Gigi's death, T\u00e9a stressed that she had not known that Jack had lied to Blair.  T\u00e9a added that she also had not known that Todd had bribed Brad's father, so that Brad would take the rap for the crime.\n\n\nBlair feared that Jack was slipping away from her.  \"Everyday, he...he seems less and less like the boy that I raised, and more and more like Todd,\" Blair said. She worried that Jack did not show the slightest sign of remorse.  Blair had considered taking Jack to Gigi's funeral but had changed her mind.  T\u00e9a suggested that the two of them attend and offer their condolences.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian slapped David with the issue of the Sun and demanded to know if David had slept with pleasant dreams.  David whined that he had been locked out of the house and had been eaten by mosquitoes.  David looked through the tabloid and wondered who had taken the photos.  After he read about his love handles in the article, David blared that he had paid to have those sucked out.\n\n\nWhen Dorian called David a liar and a cheat, David agreed that he was a liar but insisted that he was not a cheat.  David declared that he had not told Dorian about Ionia, because he had wanted to spare Dorian and had not wanted Dorian to overreact.  David stressed that Ionia had thrown herself at David, not the other way around.\n\n\nAfter David maintained that he could never cheat on Dorian, she exclaimed that she could not ignore what was in front of her two eyes.  Dorian reminded David that he had made a fool of her in the past, but David insisted that they were being played.  Dorian then discovered Ionia's top in David's bathing trunks and demanded that David get out.\n\n\nThe maid carried out a package addressed to David and handed it to Dorian, who sat at the pool.  Dorian read the card, \"Dear Lover, Last night was bliss and worth every bite...yours and the mosquitoes.  Enclosed in the package is a gift.  Make good use of it.  Then we can be together.  Itching to be yours.\"  The note also contained red lipstick prints as the signature.  Dorian opened the package and found a gun.\n\n\nOutside of the Buchanan mansion, Echo smiled and claimed that she still had it.  Roxy saw the smile and wondered if Echo had wrecked another marriage.  Echo admitted that while she disliked the mayor, she had other things on her mind.  Echo asked Roxy to join forces for the sakes of Rex and Shane.\n\n\nInside the Buchanan mansion, Rex and Shane were dressed in suits for Gigi's funeral service.  After Shane asked why they were staying there, Rex looked around the mansion and agreed that it did not seem like their home.  Rex voiced, \"No place is home without your mom.\"  Rex declared that both Todd and Jack would pay for what they had done to Gigi, and then Rex and Shane would be able to leave Llanview.\n\n\nRoxy and Echo walked in and hugged the guys.  Roxy pulled Rex aside and asked if Clint had really given Rex all of his money, as Nigel had informed her.  Roxy also asked if Rex had given Nigel his pink slip and then claimed that Nigel was good people.  Rex yelled that if Roxy had a problem with his actions, she could leave.\n\n\nShane apologized to Roxy for Rex's violent outburst, but Roxy insisted that Rex was hurt and was just letting off steam, so he could feel better.  Shane sadly believed that the only thing that would make Rex feel better was revenge on Jack and Todd.  At the same time, Echo asked Rex to take it easy on Roxy, and not to alienate the people that loved him.\n\n\nRex revealed to Echo that bargaining with Clint had been the only way to get even with the ones who had caused Gigi's death.  Rex declared that he had as much power and influence as Todd and would have the upper hand.  On the phone, Rex asked if the deed had been done, and after he heard that it had, he stated that he did not care who had it, as long as it was not Todd Manning.\n\n\nEcho feared that Rex would do something drastic, because he had lost the one that he loved.  However, Rex maintained that he would get revenge on Todd and Jack, and that Echo had better not stand in his way.  Echo declared that she knew very well how to get revenge, and that she was at Rex's disposal.  After Rex asked why, Echo revealed, \"Because I know a little something about payback, and I want to help you deliver it to Jack and Todd and anyone else who helped that little bastard get away with killing your girl.\"\n\n\nDavid grabbed Viki outside of the Buchanan mansion and declared that she was his only hope.  David demanded to know why Viki was not as livid as he was about the article and photos in the Sun.  When Viki stated that she had more pressing matters, David recognized that what had happened to Gigi was tragic.  However David also pointed out, \"But you have all the time in the world to memorialize her.  My marriage may not last till the end of the day.\"\n\n\nDavid insisted that the photos were false, but when Viki indicated that they did not appear to be altered, David agreed that they were not altered or false.  As Echo secretly listened in, David stressed that someone was sabotaging his marriage, and that he needed Viki's help.  However, Viki refused to help, since Dorian had left Clint to die.\n\n\nBlair and T\u00e9a arrived at the Buchanan mansion, and after Echo yelled that she could not believe their audacity for being there, Rex indicated that he wanted to hear what they had to say.  T\u00e9a said that she was sorry, and Blair claimed that she would do anything to change what had happened.  Rex asked Blair what exactly she would change.\n\n\nRex informed Blair and T\u00e9a that their visit had been unnecessary, because they had not been the ones who had failed to teach their son the value of a human life, nor had they been the ones who had not noticed that he did not have a conscious.  Rex accepted that Jack was not a killer, or Blair and T\u00e9a would be unable to live with themselves.  As Blair and T\u00e9a left, Rex asked them to give his regards to Todd and Jack.\n\n\nViki told Rex that if he and Shane needed anything, to call her, and Jessica requested that they try to take the time to get to know Bree and Ryder.  After Viki and Jessica left, Natalie asked Rex, Shane, and Roxy to huddle together for a Balsom meeting.  Natalie exclaimed that Gigi had been the best, and that they owed something to her.  Natalie explained that when Gigi looked down from heaven, she would see that they were taking care of each other.\n\n\nRoxy announced to Shane that they needed to \"funktify\" the place with animal prints, and she escorted him out.  Echo followed them to keep an eye on them.  Once she was in the lobby, Echo called Ionia and informed her that the package had been delivered.\n\n\nAt the La Boulaie pool, David ran up to Dorian and claimed that he could not give up on their relationship.  David pleaded, \"Look, would you please turn around, so that we can talk about this like the adults other people expect us to be?\"  Dorian turned to David and pointed the gun at him.\n\n\nOutside of the Buchanan mansion, Natalie stopped Jessica and said that she hoped that one day Jess could forgive her.  Natalie then announced that she and Brody were a couple.\n\n\nBack at Capricorn, Blair and T\u00e9a poured drinks and regretted that they had made fools of themselves, which had only made them feel guilty.  They toasted each other with a \"cheers.\"\n\n\nLooking at Gigi's picture on the Buchanan mansion fireplace mantel, Rex declared, \"I made Shane a promise, Morasco.  And I'm going to keep it.  By the time I'm done, Jack will know how it feels like to lose his mother, and Todd will know how it feels to lose his wife.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Llanfair, while looking at the picture of Viki and Todd, the man with the scar heard, in his head, all of comments from Todd's loved ones that Todd Manning was the same man that he had always been, and that he had not changed at all.  The man broke the picture and held his hand to his head.\n\n\nThe man fingered the broken glass and the photo of Todd and asked, \"Who are you?  Who am I?\"  The man ran out of the house, when he heard a noise.  Viki entered into the living room and found the picture on the floor.  As Viki walked outside, she called out, \"Hello...hello.  Hello, is anyone here?\"  The man hid behind the bushes. \n\n\n",

Original Todd spies and overhears from outside Viki's home as people talk about how the Todd they know is not a good man and they fear Jack is following in his footsteps.
