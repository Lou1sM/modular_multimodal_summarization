She felt that she had made a fool out of herself at Rex's wedding. Rex disagreed, but Gigi refused to talk about the incident or her feelings. Instead, Gigi insisted that she needed to get back to work. Rex waited until Gigi's shift ended. When they reached Angel Square, Rex told Gigi that he'd had feelings for her for quite some time. Rex also told her that Adriana was aware of how he felt about Gigi. Before they could discuss it further, Rex was interrupted by a phone call from Adriana. Rex asked Gigi to wait while he took the call. When he ended the call, Gigi tried to leave. Gigi realized, from listening to his end of the conversation, that things were not quite over between Rex and Adriana. Rex tried to stop Gigi from walking away but couldn't find the words. Out of desperation, he pulled Gigi into his arms and kissed her. \n\n\nCharlie confronted Dorian in her bedroom. He wanted answers, from Dorian, about the hours leading up to his near-death from alcohol poisoning. Dorian tried to evade the questions but Charlie was relentless. He told Dorian that his last memory was of talking to her in Adriana's hospital room. He didn't recall anything that would have sent him on a drinking binge. Dorian lied. She told Charlie that she only remembered Charlie mentioning going to Rodi's. Charlie pointed out that Rodi's had been closed that night, for a private party. Dorian became uncomfortable and blurted out that she didn't know how Charlie ended up, passed out, behind Rodi's with a bottle of vodka. Charlie caught the mistake immediately. He pointed out that he never told Dorian what he had been drinking that night or where he'd been found. Dorian managed to explain the slip by claiming that the scandal had been all gossip at the hospital and she had overheard the details from various people. The alcohol, Dorian said, was an assumption on her part. She remembered that Charlie had once mentioned that it had been his \"poison of choice.\" Charlie didn't believe her but before he could probe further, Dorian ordered him out of her bedroom. As Charlie started to leave, he glanced at Dorian's bed. He suddenly had a flashback of lying on the bed. \n\n\n\n\nIn a booth at the diner, Tess convinced Jared and Natalie to move into Llanfair. Jared had a bad feeling and was reluctant to agree, but Natalie convinced him. She was certain that moving in with Viki and Jessica would pave the way for the rest of the family to forgive them. \n\n\nViki walked into her bedroom and found two surprises: David Vickers and news that he had married Addie. Viki was disappointed that love wasn't the motivating factor behind the wedding, but she admitted that Dorian deserved Addie and David turning on her. When Viki began listing Dorian's recent transgression, David listened. Viki was surprised when he added, \"not to mention what she did to Charlie.\" David started to elaborate but Viki stopped him. She admitted that she was curious but it was better that she didn't know. Her relationship with Charlie was over. David was sympathetic and tried cheer Viki up. He told her that, from what he had seen, Viki had been very happy with Charlie. He wanted her to find that same happiness because she deserved it. Viki was touched by David's sweet words and gave him a teary-eyed hug. Charlie walked in at that moment. Things were tense but neither Viki nor David explained what Charlie had walked in on. As David walked out of the room, he seemed to take pleasure in Charlie's discomfort. \n\n\nWhen he was alone with Viki, Charlie confessed that all he could think about was how much he continued to love Viki. Viki asked him not to say those kinds of things to her; they were over. Charlie nodded and changed the subject. He told Viki that he wanted to talk to her about Dorian. \n\n\nCole went to see John to tell him that he had told Todd about Starr's decision to give their baby up for adoption. John was stunned to learn that Starr wanted Marcie and Michael to adopt the baby. John didn't think that involving Todd in the situation was the best decision. Cole defended his actions and said that he would do whatever was necessary to keep Starr from giving their baby away. \n\n\nStarr was sitting by the pool when Blair stepped outside to join her daughter. Starr told Blair about the tension between her and Cole. She started to tell her mother about her decision to give her baby up for adoption when Todd approached. He asked Starr when she intended to tell him about her pregnancy. Things became ugly as the two argued. Starr accused her father of only being interested in revenge, not the welfare of his daughter. Todd, on the other hand, couldn't get past Starr's decision to give her baby up for adoption to the woman who had kept his son from him for two years. Blair was surprised by the news that Starr wanted to give her baby up to the McBains for adoption, but said very little. Todd and Starr's argument continued to escalate until Todd revealed that Cole had told him about the pregnancy. Starr was stunned. Blair used the opportunity to order Todd to leave. As he walked out, he warned Starr that he would not allow Marcie to adopt the baby. \n\n\nAfter Todd left, Blair tried to comfort her daughter. She cautioned Starr not to make a rash decision about the baby. Starr told Blair that she wanted her baby to be an answer to someone's prayers. Starr felt that Marcie would regard the baby as a true blessing. Starr then brought up Cole. She refused to believe Todd's claim that Cole had told him about the baby. Before Blair could reply, Cole appeared and called out Starr's name. \n\n\nMarcie and Michael argued about whether or not to adopt Starr's baby. Michael refused to consider it. He felt that Marcie would only be setting herself up for heartbreak if she pursued Starr's offer. Marcie disagreed. She told Michael that adopting Starr's baby would be their last chance at ever having children. Their argument was cut short when Todd knocked on their front door. \n\n\n",
