    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Silver Spring, Maryland, Layla and Cristian walked through the front door of an unlit house.  As Layla picked up a framed photograph of Evangeline and Layla, Mrs. Williamson turned on a light, greeted Layla, and gave her a hug.  Layla immediately blurted out that she and Cristian were getting married.  After Layla exclaimed that she just wanted her mother to be happy for them, Cristian emphasized that he loved Layla.  When Mrs. Williamson discovered that Cristian and Layla had actually been engaged since May, Layla admitted that she had been afraid to tell her mother.  Layla's mother reminded Layla and Cristian that Cristian had put Evangeline in a coma, but Layla insisted that Cristian would never have done anything to hurt Evangeline.  When Layla asked for her mother's blessing, Mrs. Williamson reluctantly gave it.\n\n\nAs Layla attempted to run upstairs to tell Evangeline the news, her mother stopped her and stated, \"Evangeline's gone.\"  When Layla feared that her sister had died, her mother explained that Evangeline was in the hospital.  Layla and Cristian arrived at the hospital and found Evangeline in her room hooked up to various pieces of medical equipment.  Layla fell into Cristian's arms for comfort.\n\n\nAt Bo and Nora's, David ran into the room in search of his \"pa.\"  When Matthew snapped at him, David wondered if Matthew was sick or drunk -- and if Matthew was drunk, David asked to join him.  David feared that Matthew's sour mood was because Matthew had been dumped again and pondered that Matthew could hold the record for getting dumped.  However, David then reflected that he actually held the record for getting dumped \"by half the kick-line of Radio City Music Hall in one night.\"\n\n\nWhen Matthew expressed that he wished to tell David a secret, David stated that he would need to be reminded every day not to tell it.  David then placed a daily reminder on his cell phone.  Matthew told David that he had almost gotten Nate and Dani killed, and explained what had happened to Bull at the deserted barn.  As Matthew wondered if Nate and Dani were still alive, David stated that he would call the hospital.  After the call, David informed Matthew that Nate and Dani were fine.\n\n\nAs Matthew attempted to call his dad to tell him what had happened, David grabbed the phone.  When Matthew insisted that it had all been his fault, because he had been jealous, David responded, \"Jealous? What are you talking about?  Half this town is jealous of me.  It doesn't make them guilty of murder.  Look, Matthew, you did the right thing.\"  David pointed out that Matthew was a nice guy, however, Matthew felt that he had put a lot of people in danger.  David still would not let Matthew place the call, because his ma and pa would have to arrest him and put him in prison.  \"All it's going to do is ease your conscience a little bit.  Is it worth it?\"\n\n\nDavid declared that Matthew's secret -- that Matthew had told Bull that Nate had taken off with Bull's money -- was safe, because only Bull and David knew the secret.  Bull was dead, and David was Matthew's brother.  Matthew insisted that he did not want David to lie, but David claimed that he just would not volunteer the information, and that it was the right thing to do for everybody.  Matthew raised his eyes to the ceiling in frustration.  David advised that Matthew do good deeds for Nate and Dani down the road in secret, and David and Matthew shook hands.\n\n\nIn the park outside of the hospital, Nate asked Dani if she were okay and then said that he knew that something bad had happened at the hospital, but that no one would tell him what it was.  Dani screamed, \"Yeah...join the club.\"  Dani cried that her mother was dying, and that no one could trust Dani enough to tell her.  Nate did not believe that it was a trust issue and reminded Dani that his mother had not told him about her money problems for months.  Nate emphasized that his mother had not wanted him to worry.  \n\n\nDani shrieked that her mother had not even told Dani her father's identity.  Dani believed that T\u00e9a could not trust her enough to tell her anything.  Nate felt confident that T\u00e9a believed that when she died, Dani would feel lost.  Nate asked, \"How long does she have?\"  Dani said that she did not know and bawled in his arms.\n\n\nDani regretted that she had treated her mother horribly, especially whenever T\u00e9a was with Todd, but Nate informed her that Todd had sent him to search for Dani.  Nate insisted that Todd was more worried about Dani and T\u00e9a, than to \"get into it\" with Nate about what had happened with Bull.  Dani then realized why T\u00e9a had wanted to share Dani's prom experience with her.  Dani believed that she should have seen the reason, but Nate speculated that T\u00e9a had not wanted Dani to see it.  Dani sadly stated, \"She just wanted me to keep being my selfish, stupid self.\"  However, Nate speculated that T\u00e9a had just wanted to share the experience with Dani, to take many pictures, and to hear about Dani's \"incredible boyfriend person.\"  Dani agreed, \"He's pretty incredible.\"\n\n\nIn T\u00e9a's room at the hospital, T\u00e9a regretted that she had told the seriousness of her health to Dani, however, Todd felt that Dani could handle it.  Todd revealed that he thought that Nate would be able to find Dani.  When T\u00e9a exclaimed that she could finally die happy, since Todd was able to trust Nate, Todd warned, \"You'd better hold on, brother, because I'm never going to trust my daughter's boyfriend.\"\n\n\nBack in the park, after Nate questioned whether T\u00e9a would be receiving radiation, Dani still hoped for a miracle.  Dani cried that she would have nobody left if T\u00e9a were to die and if Todd went to jail - but then she remembered Ross.  Since she knew that Ross still lived in Tahiti, Dani stated that she wanted to remain in Llanview.  However, Nate told Dani to only worry \"about today\" and to wrap her brain around her mother's condition.  Nate insisted that he would accompany Dani to talk to her parents, but Dani feared that talking to them would only make T\u00e9a's illness \"real.\"\n\n\nTodd received a text message from Nate that Dani was fine, and T\u00e9a was grateful.  When T\u00e9a exclaimed that she was abandoning Dani, Todd denied it and insisted that Dani knew that T\u00e9a loved her.  T\u00e9a regretted that she would not be able to be with Dani during the tough times and then reminisced about the fantasies that T\u00e9a had created about her mother that had given T\u00e9a comfort in the past.  When Todd again insisted that Dani would be fine, T\u00e9a asked if Todd would write Dani postcards from prison.  T\u00e9a then asserted that she and Todd needed to talk about Ross.  T\u00e9a reminded Todd that Dani loved Ross, when Todd revealed that Dani had just recently needed help and had asked Todd.  T\u00e9a demanded to know what had happened.\n\n\nIn the hospital lobby, as Cole spotted Starr, they ran into each other's arms.  Cole mentioned that he had heard about a shooting, and Starr informed him that she was fine.  Cole asked Starr what had happened.  Starr admitted that her earlier story that she had needed some time to herself, away from Cole, had been a lie, and that she had just needed Cole to stay away from her.  Starr insisted that she had been doing everything she could to keep Cole and Hope safe.\n\n\nCole wondered if James had been threatening Starr and then informed her that Hannah had made Cole believe that there had been something between Starr and James.  After Hannah had showed Cole a picture of Starr and James together, Hannah had insisted that she and Cole follow Starr and James to Delaware, where Cole had found Starr's diploma and a condom wrapper in the beach house.  Starr cried that she would never do something like that to Cole and asked Cole if he believed that.  Starr insisted that she had never slept with James.\n\n\nCole related that Hannah had been \"on the run,\" and that Hannah's family had a beach house in Delaware.  Cole also revealed that Hannah had lied about seeing Todd push Cole's mother down the stairs.  Cole apologized for not believing Starr and claimed that he knew that Hannah had tried to break them up.  As Cole began to tell Starr what had happened in Delaware, Starr interrupted Cole to call her father.\n\n\nStarr told Todd, over the phone, that John McBain would have to drop the charges against Todd, since Hannah had lied about being a witness to Todd's involvement in Marty's incident.  Todd related Starr's information to T\u00e9a, who said that she would file a motion.  When T\u00e9a again demanded to know what had happened to Dani, Todd revealed that Dani had sneaked into his car, and that Starr had been involved in the incident with Bull also.  However, Todd insisted that Starr was fine, but that she had shot James.  When T\u00e9a asked how James was, Todd declared, \"Well, if I'm lucky, he won't be okay.  James almost got my daughters killed.\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a begged Todd, \"Please don't treat Nate the way you treat Cole, okay?\"  T\u00e9a cried, \"I will not be here to beg you...please I am begging you now.  Please don't do to Dani what you did to Starr, okay?\"  Dani and Nate walked through the door.  T\u00e9a thanked Nate for finding Dani.  After Nate left the room, Dani ran into her mother's arms and sobbed, \"I'm sorry I walked out on you before.  I won't do it again, I promise.  Just please don't leave me.\"\n\n\nCole told Starr that he was sorry that he had ever listened to Hannah and begged for Starr's forgiveness.  Before Starr could reply, a nurse walked in, and Starr asked to know about the surgery.  Cole did not understand.  Starr explained that James had just been trying to protect her, and that Hannah had been lying.  Starr insisted that she only wanted to make sure that James would be all right -- nothing more.  Starr revealed to Cole that James had been shot, and that Starr had been the one who had shot him.  When the nurse reentered, Starr asked her if James had made it through the surgery.\n\n\nIn the police station interrogation room, Hannah announced to Eli that she had seen Eli push Marty down the stairs, and Eli voiced that he had speculated on if she had actually witnessed it.  Hannah said, \"Well, now you know.  So, what now?\"  Eli declared, \"What now?  Now you go down for the assault on Marty Saybrooke.\"  \n\n\nHannah just laughed and recommended that Eli confess, because it was the \"right thing to do.\"  Hannah insisted that she did not care \"who went down\" for the incident, as long as it was not her.  However, Eli claimed that due to Hannah's history, nobody would believe her if she were to claim that Eli had pushed Marty.  Hannah asked Eli if he really wanted to take that chance.\n\n\nEli reminded Hannah that he knew that she had been harboring an agenda, which had worked out for him.  Eli revealed that he had tried to find Hannah that night, but since she had blamed Todd, Eli had let her off.  Hannah claimed that she needed Eli's help, since he was an attorney.  Then Hannah realized that Eli had Ford accuse her of Ford's attack, and that it must have been Eli who had attacked Ford.  Eli recounted that all of the physical evidence pointed to Hannah, and that Ford had actually named Hannah as his attacker.  Eli advised Hannah to accept a plea, because she would most certainly be convicted at trial.  After Hannah fired him, Eli advised that no lawyer could help her.  \"You're going to be in jail until you're forty-five, and by then, you can give up ever thinking your way back to Cole.\"\n\n\nHannah insisted that John McBain would believe her.  As Hannah started to leave the room, Eli placed a menacing hand on the door, and she yelled, \"Let me go -- or I'll scream.\"  Eli threatened, \"You think I pushed a pregnant woman down a flight of stairs.  You think I cracked your ex-lover's skull.  What do you think I'll do to you if you try to turn me in?\" \n\n\n",
