    "soap_central": "\nYANKEE DOODLE DO OR DIE\n\n\nIn Angel Square, waiting for the fourth of July fireworks, Rex and Gigi shared a kiss. They recalled their last kiss, on the very same date, so many years previously. Rex pronounced it, \"just as good,\" and declared that he felt better than he had in a long time. They locked lips again. \"What does this mean?\" Gigi wondered. Rex replied that it meant what she thought and that, \"Kissing you feels like the fourth of July.\" Gigi uneasily tried to explain that she didn't want to come between Rex and Adriana, and Rex expressed the same thought regarding Gigi and Brody. Gigi told him that Brody slept on the sofa. \"There is no me and Brody. He's not even...\" Before Gigi could continue, they were interrupted by Brody and Shane, who were carrying a picnic dinner and looking for a prime spot in which to watch the fireworks. \n\n\nViki instantly came to the wrong conclusion when Charlie told her that he wanted to talk about himself and Dorian. She couldn't believe how fast they had gotten together. He immediately corrected her and explained that he thought Dorian had something to do with his falling off the wagon. He thought it possible that Dorian had somehow gotten him to drink after he told her about his upcoming confessions regarding Rex and Jared. He would have ruined her plans if he had spoken. Viki concurred that Dorian indeed had a strong motive to keep Charlie quiet but wondered how she would have forced him to drink. \n\n\nCole admitted to Starr and Blair that he was the one to tell Todd about Starr's pregnancy. He swore that he was just desperate to keep his child, though Blair accused him of recruiting Todd to start a war. She told him that his action was unforgivable and that she planned on protecting Starr against both Todd and Cole, and that Cole would be history if he hurt her daughter. Starr accused Cole of taking her father's side against her, though he denied it and said that he was just trying to get Starr to see his side. Starr felt that there would have been plenty of time in the coming months for them to argue and that Todd would fight Cole as hard as he would fight the McBains, so he really didn't win anything at all by telling Todd of the pregnancy. Cole insisted that he loved Starr but she wouldn't listen. If he loved her, he wouldn't have gone to her father, she told him. In fact, he had become just like her father and only cared about winning, she added. \n\n\nUsing a computer at the police station, John viewed the x-rays of the unknown woman and consulted someone on the use of a special program online. \n\n\nMarty told Janet that she felt herself growing stronger and asked the nurse for some information on Todd, since he seemed unwilling to divulge too much information himself. Janet admitted that she really didn't know anything more than Marty, who felt really down about not remembering her past life. She mentioned that she was afraid of John, since he caused her accident and broke up Todd's marriage. Janet seemed confused but recalled that Ramsey wanted an eye kept on John. She added that John was in the apartment when Ramsey was murdered and was probably involved in it. Marty was grateful to Todd for protecting her. \n\n\nTodd went to see the McBains to advise them that he would not let them have his grandchild. Marcie stood up to him and in no uncertain terms told him that the baby belonged to Starr and she could do what she wanted to. She also told him to blame only himself for losing his daughter and other children and that, thankfully, Blair had come to her senses about him. Michael suggested family counseling. Todd retorted that he and Cole had become friends, and the baby would be staying in the family. He reminded Marcie of all she did when she kidnapped his son but Marcie gave it right back to Todd, pointing out his latest antics involving his son and why he couldn't go near his kids. Todd and Marcie had more words, Todd threatened to chase Marcie if she took his grandson, and finally, Michael grabbed Todd to toss him out. When John showed up at that very moment, he helped in getting rid of Todd. Todd accused John of being involved in the entire scheme of giving the baby to the McBains. \n\n\nThough Viki agreed that Dorian could be behind Charlie's drinking, she reminded him that Dorian didn't force him to tell all of his lies. \"I miss you so much,\" Viki cried as Charlie put his arms around her. They kissed, but she broke away, telling him that she just couldn't do it. She asked him to leave and stay away but Charlie couldn't promise her that. He spoke of how he fell in love with her as soon as he saw her and that he would prove himself to her, even if it took the rest of his life. \n\n\nWhile Gigi agreed to watch Shane perform a skateboard stunt, Rex and Brody attempted to make some small talk. Brody acknowledged that he knew he had walked in on something between Rex and Gigi, but reminded Rex that he was still wearing a wedding ring. He added that Shane was his son and that he was there making things up to him. Rex quickly assured him that he and Gigi were just friends, but Brody said that he himself was more than friends with Gigi, and that Rex had better back off. When Gigi and Shane returned, the boy asked Rex to join them but Rex declined, citing previous plans. \n\n\nAs Todd accused and attacked, Blair showed up, and he couldn't help but taunt that she was there to see her boyfriend, John. Blair advised him that she supported Starr and whatever Starr wanted. She thought that Marcie might have been more cooperative with Todd in the past if he hadn't acted as though his son were just a prize. Todd advised her that if she helped Marcie obtain Starr's baby, her world as she knew it would end. \n\n\nMarty was extremely anxious to try to learn something about herself, especially after she spouted off some medical terms regarding her condition and had no idea where they came from. She also had the feeling that someone needed her. She asked Janet to get her a laptop computer so that she could look herself up online. She felt that she might be able to find something about her accident, at the very least. Todd returned to the house and found various reasons for not being able to provide Marty with a computer. He quickly changed the subject and mentioned his lousy day, adding that he wouldn't be able to take any other stress. He ran into his wife and John and they'd turned his daughter against him, he lied. Marty suggested they sit back and just watch the fireworks. She lowered the lights. \n\n\nMichael tried to tell Marcie that things were going like they did the last time. He felt that with Todd and Cole being against them, Marcie would only suffer and that he couldn't bear to watch. He asked her to choose between their marriage and Starr's baby. Elsewhere in the building, Blair went with John to his apartment. John admitted that he wasn't happy about Cole's move. Blair was upset that they had tried to protect Cole from Todd for so long and suddenly Cole and Todd were allies. John felt bad for the kids. He asked Blair if she meant it when she said she'd help Marcie or if she was just getting back at Todd. Blair admitted that she wanted to get back at Todd, but only for Starr's sake. She felt that she had been a terrible mom and shouldn't have stuck with Todd. She was worried that he would make this an all-out war. She confirmed that she had Marcie's back. \n\n\nStarr assured Cole that their baby was going to the McBains. There was nothing he could do about it. Starr ordered Cole to leave. \n\n\nMichael packed his things and left. He told Marcie that he couldn't watch her heart get broken again. \n\n\nCharlie wandered down to Angel Square and watched the fireworks. He saw Rex; they looked at each other briefly, without acknowledgement, and Charlie moved on. Rex and Gigi looked at each other wordlessly as well.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Blair finds out that Cole has informed Todd that Starr is pregnant and plans to give their baby to Marcy and Michael, she tells him he will be sorry for what he did to her daughter. Todd goes to confront Marcie and Michael. But Marcie is confident that he won't win if he opposes them or Starr. Blair tells John that she wants to help Marcie and Michael get Starr's baby. Marcie is very adamant about adopting Starr's baby. But Michael tells her he cannot go through with it, knowing all the pain in could cause them. Rex is obviously not ok with Brody being a father figure to Shane. Gigi tells Rex that their relationship is over. But she indicates that she is not over him any more than he is over her. Todd is still working on developing Marty's trust while she is hidden in his new place.",
