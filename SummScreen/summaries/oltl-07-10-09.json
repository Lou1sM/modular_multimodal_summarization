When Rex declined the invitation, Schuyler related that he was aware that Rex had slept with Stacy, and instructed Rex to meet him at the Angel Square Hotel within the hour.   Gigi questioned whether the caller was Stacy.  Avoiding giving Gigi a direct answer, Rex assured Gigi that she was the love of his life, and he rushed off to meet Schuyler.\n\n\nAs Gigi sat in silence and happily recalled the details of her long overdue reunion with Rex, Stacy arrived at the cottage and disrupted her pleasant thoughts.    In an attempt to hurt Gigi, Stacy claimed that Rex had developed feelings for her.  Unwilling to reveal that Rex had learned the truth about Stacy's scheme, Gigi pretended to feel terrible over the thought of losing Rex to her sister, but Stacy believed that Gigi was hiding something.  Insisting that Gigi had a certain glow, Stacy was convinced that Gigi and Schuyler had made love.\n\n\nGigi was startled by Stacy's accusation and denied having sex with Schuyler.  Pleased by the thought that Schuyler had moved on, Stacy announced, \"Fair is fair!  You slept with my ex and I slept with yours!\"  Upon hearing Stacy's revelation, Gigi's jaw dropped to the floor.  Gigi refused to believe her sister's claim, but Stacy gave Gigi explicit details about her rendezvous with Rex and exclaimed, \"Rex is mine now!\"  As Stacy gloated, Gigi pushed her out the door.  Afterward, a devastated Gigi trashed her living room.\n\n\nRex arrived at Schuyler's apartment and demanded to know why Schuyler had summoned him.  Schuyler chastised Rex over his failure to tell Gigi that he had slept with her sister.  Rex denied having sex with Stacy, but a furious Schuyler informed Rex that Stacy had related the details concerning her sexual encounter with Rex.  Horrified that Schuyler was aware of his secret, Rex flew into a rage and punched him.\n\n\nRex questioned why Schuyler was interested in his affairs.  Schuyler maintained that he was trying to help Rex save his relationship with Gigi.  Insisting that Stacy intended to tell Gigi the truth, Schuyler suggested that Rex reveal the truth to Gigi before Stacy had the chance.  Rex admitted his indiscretion, but insisted that Stacy had manipulated him.  Rex asked Schuyler what Stacy was capable of, but Schuyler hesitated, then declined to answer.  When Rex questioned why Schuyler had chosen to help Gigi, Schuyler insisted that he was simply being her friend.  Heading toward the door, Rex stated that he was back in Gigi's life and warned Schuyler to stay away.\n\n\nLater, Rex returned to the cottage and discovered Gigi sitting quietly in the dark.  Observing the clutter on the floor, Rex wondered what had taken place during his absence.  Gigi informed Rex that Stacy had paid her a visit.  Rex was stunned when Gigi related that Stacy claimed that Rex had made love to her.  Gigi asked Rex to tell her the truth.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Oliver told Layla that he had chosen a special place to reveal some good news to her.  Before Oliver could reveal the surprise to Layla, Cris phoned Layla and invited her out to dinner.  Layla took great pleasure in telling Cris that she was out on a date with Oliver.  After abruptly hanging up on Cris, Layla was anxious to learn of Oliver's news.  Oliver's surprise was interrupted once again when Cris phoned again and requested that Layla replace the empty carton of milk that she had left inside the refrigerator.  As Cris made angry demands of Layla over the phone, Kyle, who was sitting at a nearby booth at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, overheard Cris mention Oliver's name.\n\n\nBack at the Palace Hotel, Oliver ordered champagne and announced that John had hired Layla as his new assistant.   Layla was thrilled to learn that she would be working at the Llanview Police Department and thanked Oliver for encouraging John to give her the opportunity.  As they shared a toast, Oliver appeared bothered when Layla insisted that the waiter was physically attracted to him.  Layla wondered why her statement had upset Oliver.  A nervous Oliver complimented Layla on her beauty, and insisted that they conclude their date back at the apartment.  As Oliver escorted her out of the Hotel, Layla didn't notice the friendly smile that Oliver and the gay waiter exchanged.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Kyle approached Cris and informed him that Oliver was an old college friend.   When Kyle mentioned that Oliver and Layla's relationship was doomed, Cris's curiosity was piqued.   Cris demanded to know the details regarding Oliver's past.  When Cris questioned Oliver's intentions toward Layla, Kyle stated that Layla might get hurt because Oliver was using her.\n\n\nWhile dining at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Viki told Charlie that Dorian had phoned her a countless number of times requesting her presence at LaBoulaie for dinner.  Viki and Charlie were amazed that Dorian thought they would consider being her guests.  As Viki and Charlie discussed Dorian's aggressive behavior, Shaun, Noelle, and Moe approached the couple.  Viki, Charlie, Moe, and Shaun explained Dorian's dilemma to a surprised Noelle.  Upon learning that Markko's relationship with Langston was in jeopardy, Noelle stunned everyone when she announced that she planned to attend the dinner for Markko's sake.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian welcomed Mr. and Mrs. Rivera into her home.  As the adults entered the living room, Langston informed Markko that she didn't think the expected dinner guests were coming.  While Mrs. Rivera treated Dorian kindly, her husband was critical of Dorian.  Mr. Rivera continued to question the whereabouts of the missing dinner guests.  Dorian insisted that Viki, Charlie, Moe, Noelle, and Shaun would join them, but Mr. Rivera remained skeptical.  Dorian excused herself and left several messages urging the missing guests to show up for Langston and Markko's sake.\n\n\nLangston confronted Dorian, who was hiding in another room, and demanded that she face reality -- no one was going to attend the dinner party.  Dorian swore that she would make things right for Langston and Markko.  Dorian returned and tried to convince the Riveras that she was a good person and that her friends had forgiven her.  Mr. Rivera accused Dorian of attempting to deceive him.  As Dorian tried desperately to explain, she was pleasantly surprised when Noelle, Moe, Viki, Charlie, and Shaun entered the room.  While Dorian pretended that their presence wasn't a surprise, Viki shook her head and gave Dorian a knowing look.\n\n\nNoelle did her best to convince the Riveras that Dorian hadn't intended to cause harm to anyone, but Mr. Rivera was skeptical.  When a nervous Dorian made a reference to alcohol in Charlie's presence, Mr. Rivera reminded Dorian that Charlie was an alcoholic and questioned Dorian's true character.  Dorian apologized for her behavior and defended herself to Mr. Rivera.  Unmoved by Dorian's remarks, Mr. Rivera ordered Markko to stay away from Langston.  \n\n\nFed up by Mr. Rivera's disapproval of Langston, Dorian lashed out at him.  Stating that Markko was in love with Langston, Dorian informed Mr. Rivera that he would lose his son if he didn't support Markko's relationship with Langston.  Mrs. Rivera tried to reason with her husband, but Mr. Rivera announced that they were leaving and ordered Markko to join them.  To everyone's surprise, Markko refused to leave and informed his father that he was choosing Langston over his family.\n\n \n\n\n",
