    "tvmega_recap": "John is alone at the crime scene. He can almost see his father laying on the ground before him. He hears a noise and turns pulling his gun and aiming, all in one fluid movement. Natalie is behind him. \"John! When is this going to stop?\" she asks him. He keeps trying to find answers, he admits, but he wonders if he really wants to get them. Bo wants to talk to Blair and they meet for a drink. Spencer arrives and sees the two together. \"Jealous Spence?\" Todd asks. Spencer leaves him and heads over to the table, surprising the two. Blair thought that he was visiting his brother. Bo quickly leaves. Spencer tells that Paige has been taken away. Blair finds that sad. Spencer says that it must be hard for Bo finding out that someone that he loved has been keeping secrets from him. Blair talks to Todd but he finds it unhealthy for people that have broken up to keep talking. She warns him that it may get to a point where they can't turn it around. He is already there. Todd spends the whole evening watching Blair and Spencer. Spencer decides that he is ready to go. Blair isn't. In fact, she has ordered champagne for them. Spencer smiles and gloats at Todd when the bottle arrives. John replays the scene as he has been told it ran. David is up against the fence, he turns and lets off a shot. In John's mind, he sees David holding the gun by his side. He realizes what it was that he has been missing. They never recovered the gun from the shooting. That can mean something. John replays the scene repeatedly, while Natalie watches from a distance. John wonders if he were the age that David had been, would he have taken the gun with him. John looks around. He stoops. He sees some leaves. He brushes them away and finds a sewer there. He looks beyond the grate and sees endless darkness. They try to see what is in there but retrieve nothing.",
