    "soap_central": "\n\nNirvana for Nora?\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tess awoke from a dream in which she fired a gun at Natalie and Jared.  She smiled to herself and exclaimed, \"Today's the day!\"  As Tess criticized Jessica's terrible taste in fashion, an apparition of Nash appeared in the room.  Tess hugged Nash and promised to make Nat and Jared suffer for taking him away from her.  Nash expressed his concern and stated that he didn't want to see her get hurt.  Tess said that the only reason she was able to resurface again was because of Nash's children; she promised to take good care of them. \n\n\nMeanwhile downstairs, Viki and Clint discussed the wedding that never took place.  The discussion was cut short when Natalie and Jared interrupted and announced that they were both moving in.  Natalie explained that Jessica had insisted that they move in and attempt to repair their shattered relationship and was surprised that Jess hadn't warned Viki.  While an outraged Clint chastised Natalie about her decision making, Viki headed upstairs to check on Jessica.  Clint expressed regret over allowing Nat to blackmail him, and said that he should have let Jared rot in jail.  Natalie reminded her father that they had made a deal and that Jared wasn't going to prison.  Jared promised Clint that he would find a way to earn his respect back, but Clint was angered by Jared's actions and refused to accept his apology.  Nat also promised Clint that she would eventually make amends for her actions.  Clint assured Natalie that he still loved her, but couldn't accept her relationship with Jared.\n\n\nAs Tess continued to promise Nash that she would seek revenge against Natalie and Jared, Viki interrupted with a knock on the door.  Tess sat up in bed, and Nash disappeared.  Upon entering the room, Viki questioned who \"Jess\" was talking to and stated that she overheard her mention Natalie and Jared's names.  A cautious Tess admitted that she was talking to Nash; she said that it made her feel better.  She made up an excuse about patching things up with Nat and Jared.  Viki informed her daughter that Nat and Jared were moving in and expressed her surprise that Jess never mentioned that she had invited them to stay at Llanfair.  Tess said that she wanted to forgive her sister and believed that things would be better if they stayed under the same roof.  When Viki questioned why Jess had asked Jared to move in, Tess told her that Nat wouldn't have accepted the offer had she not invited Jared.  After Tess assured her mother that she was ready to forgive and move forward, Viki complimented her daughter on the progress she was making and stated that she was proud of her.  Viki exited the room, and the apparition of Nash appeared again.  Tess laughed at how she had fooled Viki, but Nash warned her to never underestimate her mother.  Tess was certain that her plan would work.  Her mood grew somber when Nash reminded her that nothing would change, and that he wouldn't be coming back to her.\n\n\nAttempting to change the subject, Nat asked Clint if he had revealed to David that he was a Buchanan.  Clint told her that he was waiting for the right time to drop the bombshell.  Natalie wondered if they could somehow use David to get at Dorian.  When Viki returned and overheard David's name being mentioned, she shocked Clint by informing him that David and Addie had gotten married.  Clint was all ears when he learned that David and Dorian were feuding and that David married Addie in order to get at Dorian. Immediately, Clint appeared to have an idea and quickly excused himself and headed to Lindsay's arraignment.  Viki announced that she would abide by Jessica's wishes and allow Nat and Jared to stay on one condition \u2013 they would have separate rooms.  Although unhappy with the ultimatum, Nat agreed.  A stern Viki told Jared that she wasn't pleased with him and warned him not to cross her.  Tess entered the room and was told by Viki that Nat and Jared would be moving in.  Tess smiled and said, \"I have Natty and Jared to lean on now.\"  As Nat and Jared walked away, Tess smiled and winked her eye at the apparition of Nash, who waved at her.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Rex interrupted Nora as she prepared for Lindsay's arraignment.  Rex asked Nora if she believed Lindsay deserved to go to prison.  Nora was certain that Lindsay should be convicted for her crimes and promised to put her away.  Realizing Rex's concern for Lindsay, Nora asked him if he thought she was doing the wrong thing by going after Lindsay.  Sadly, Rex replied that the situation was terrible and understood Nora's position, but still had compassion for his friend.  Rex mentioned his visit to Bo and the fact that he was drinking.  A look of sadness crossed Nora's face, and she recalled Bo tuning to alcohol after the loss of both Drew and Asa.   Addie, David, and David Vickers entered the courtroom wearing \"Free Lindsay\" t-shirts.  Minutes later, Lindsay was brought in by a guard.\n\n\nNora listened as Rex assured Lindsay that she had his full support.  The judge took the bench and inquired as to why Lindsay was being tried twice for the same crime.  Although Lindsay's lawyer attempted to convince the judge that double jeopardy existed in the case, Nora reminded the judge that Lindsay was never tried before a jury and that double jeopardy wasn't a factor.  In light of the new evidence, the judge agreed and asked Lindsay to enter her plea.  Lindsay shocked everyone by pleading \"Guilty.\" Lindsay admitted to faking a breakdown in court and announced that she was completely sane when she murdered Spencer.  Lindsay said that her lies had cost her the man she loved.  Lindsay told the court that she was done lying and her conscious was clear.  The judge ordered Lindsay held without bail until sentencing.  When Rex asked Lindsay if she was sure of her plea, she asked him to take care of Bo.  Before exiting the courtroom, Lindsay told Nora that it had taken ten years but she had finally gotten her.  Lindsay asked if Nora was happy now.  A disgusted Nora told Lindsay that she had done it to herself.  Lindsay had one last question for Nora.  She wanted to know what Nora would do now without her.  Nora was at a loss for words.  \n\n\nAfterwards, Nora asked Rex if he knew that Lindsay had planned to enter a guilty plea and admitted her surprise.  Rex told Nora that Lindsay had changed ever sense Jen died.  He said Lindsay had lost so much, and after losing Bo she had probably given up.  Nora wondered if she had grown a conscious after all.  Realizing that Bo didn't want to see her, Nora asked Rex to check on him.  He promised that he would.  Out in the hall, Clint ran into Rex who informed him that Lindsay had pleaded guilty and the arraignment was over.  As David, Addie, and David Vickers poured out of the courtroom, Clint questioned them about their sudden wedding.  He asked how Dorian was accepting their bliss.  Clint smiled as Addie replied, \"Dorrie wants to blow her brains out.  She would do anything to break up our marriage.\"  When Nora stepped out into the hall, Clint told her that David's marriage to Addie had given him an idea of how to take on Dorian and suggested that they hurry over to Buchanan Enterprises to discuss his plan.  As they walked off, Clint told Nora that he worried about Bo's reaction to Lindsay's guilty plea. \n\n\nRex arrived at Bo's and was surprised to find the apartment empty and movers clearing out the remaining items.  The movers told Rex that Bo was gone.\n\n\nIn the dungeon of the Mendorran Palace, Talia picked the lock and the women attempted to flee but were greeted by Carlo and Jonas.  Carlo informed Sarah that Jonas would take her to Cris, but warned her not to mention hisd connection to the kidnappings or the Buchanan family would reap the consequences. He furthered stated that Antonio would pay if Talia continued to be disobedient.  After Jonas left with Sarah, Talia demanded to know what Carlo had done to Antonio, but Carlo criticized Talia about her relationship with Antonio. Carlo said that he had trusted Antonio like a son, but Antonio had turned on him.  Carlo was certain that he would do the same to her.  He criticized her taste in men, but assured her that things would soon change.  Talia expressed her anger with Carlo for abandoning her.  She revealed that she knew that Carlo had henchmen watching her and her mother for years, but he never once tried to make contact with her.  Talia said that the only reason Carlo surfaced was because he needed her to carry out his agenda.  Carlo told Talia that he wanted to protect her from Antonio and advised her that he would find a suitable man for her.\n\n\nAt the Mendorran palace, Cris faked stomach pains and head butted the guard, knocking him unconscious.  Cris and Antonio grabbed two swords from the wall and headed off to find Sarah and Talia.  Before they could get very far, two armed guards approached and ordered the Vega brothers to drop their weapons.  Tina entered the room and demanded that the guards also withdraw their weapons.  Antonio dropped his sword, but Tina's distraction allowed Cris to conceal his sword in his pants.  The guards told Tina that they had orders to take the Vega brothers to a cell.  When Tina stated that no one could overrule her, Cain appeared and said that he could.  \n\n\nAs Tina and Cain bickered, Antonio and Cris were shocked to see him and began to berate the \"Master of Disguises.\"  Angered by their lack of respect for the prince, the guards ordered the Vega boys to address their majesty as, Prince Helmutt Krackoff.  Realizing that Cain was pulling another scam, they reminded him of his past impersonations.  Once the guards began to question Cris and Antonio's statements about their prince, Cain insisted that the guards leave him alone with the brothers.  After the guards had left, Cain continued to pretend to be the prince, but Antonio and Cris weren't fooled.  When Antonio and Cris threatened to physically harm Cain if he didn't produce Sarah and Talia, Cain admitted to being a fraud.  Antonio, Cris, and Tina all agreed that the Sarah and Talia's safety were worth far more than the jewels, but Cain insisted that they needed the jewels as leverage to get the women back. \n\n\nCain promised to get the women back safely and deal with Jonas. As Cain attempted to leave the room, Jonas appeared with Sarah and ordered him back into the room.  When Cain ordered Jonas to provide him with answers or face prison, Jonas informed him that Jonas would have Cain imprisoned for being an imposter.  Jonas's threat startled both Cain and Tina.  Antonio asked Sarah about Talia, but Jonas reminded her of Carlo's warning.  Antonio grabbed Jonas, but Jonas pulled away and informed Antonio that Talia wasn't his to give.  Jonas told Antonio that he would be reunited with Talia if he cooperated and left with him.  Jonas stated that Antonio had to come alone.  Cris refused to allow Antonio to leave without him, but a cornered, Antonio agreed to go alone. As Antonio and Cris hugged goodbye, Cris handed him the sword.  Antonio concealed the weapon in his pants and left with Jonas.   Sarah told Antonio to be careful, but Cris assured her that Antonio could take care of himself.  Tina apologized to Sarah for getting her involved in the scheme.  Sarah lashed out at her mother and criticized her for getting mixed up with Cain.    Cain insisted on knowing if Jonas mentioned the jewels.  Sarah told them that she knew nothing.  Sarah asked for a few moments alone with Cris, but Tina wanted more time with her daughter.  Sarah promised to spend time with her later, and Tina obliged.  Alone with Cris, Sarah told him that Jonas wasn't in charge, but Carlo Hesser was.\n\n\nBack in the dungeon, Talia told Carlo that she loved Antonio and that he couldn't auction her off.  As Talia and Carlo argued, Antonio appeared at the cell with Jonas.  A shocked Antonio asked what was going on.  Carlo said that it was a family reunion and asked Antonio to join them.  Once in the cell, Antonio grabbed Carlo and placed the sword at his neck.  Antonio asked Carlo to give him a reason not to kill him.  Talia screamed, \"Antonio, he's my father!\"\n\n\nRex arrived at Bo's and was surprised to find the apartment empty and movers clearing out the remaining items.  The movers told Rex that Bo was gone.\n\n\n\n\n",
