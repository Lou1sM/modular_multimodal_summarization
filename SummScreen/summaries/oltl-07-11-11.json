He advised her that he wouldn't give up on their relationship, but he was shocked when Dorian turned and pointed a gun at him. She told him how easy it would be for her to pull the trigger. David was aware that Dorian was angry, but there hadn't been an affair, David stated adamantly. Dorian disagreed, because she had evidence.\n \n\nDorian had intercepted a package addressed to David that had included a note and the gun. She accused David and Ionia of plotting to get rid of her. \"I'm onto you. Sayonara, Vickerman,\" Dorian called out as David began to back up. Suddenly, he tripped over a foot. \"Dorian, could you come here a second?\" David asked. They wondered about the man who was lying in the bushes.\n \n\nDorian suggested that David feel for a pulse. He knelt down and checked. He assured Dorian that the man was dead, and he was certain that Dorian had killed the man. David called the police. He hoped that Dorian had a good explanation for them. \n \n\nOn the floor at Llanfair, Viki found the shattered frame that held the photo of her and Todd. She stepped outside and called out, but no one answered her. She continued to ask whether someone was there, while the man with Todd's original face hid. He muttered to himself that he could trust Viki. Before he was able to make his move, Bree ran outside to tell Viki that she'd heard Natalie and Jessica fighting. \"Please make them stop,\" the little girl begged her grandmother.\n \n\nThe man was still using Agent Kent's phone, and it began to ring. The person on the other end demanded to know why Kent hadn't checked in at the office and provided an updated report. The man, pretending to be Kent, claimed that he'd had travel problems. The caller ordered Kent to reveal his code. \"What are you wearing?\" the man finally asked. The caller demanded to be told what had happened to Kent.\n \n\nThe man affirmed that he'd killed Kent as practice, \"for when I get my hands on you.\" The caller inquired about the man's location, and the man stated that he was in a little town where he'd met a kid named Sam. The boy had told him about lots of people, and the boy had a father named Todd Manning. The man added, \"I'm like no way. His father can't be Todd Manning, because I'm Todd Manning!\"\n \n\nThe man wondered who could be walking around as Todd Manning, and he thought the best thing would be to ask Viki about it. The caller suggested that the man leave Todd's family out of it, because the caller couldn't guarantee their safety. The man vowed that he would kill the caller, just like Kent, if Todd's family members were hurt.\n \n\nNatalie revealed to Jessica that she and Brody were in a relationship. Natalie felt that she owed her sister the truth. \"Why start now?\" Jessica retorted. Jessica assured Natalie that she wouldn't cry over it, and she accused Natalie of stealing Brody. Natalie insisted that she'd never meant to hurt Jessica. Natalie was unable to admit that she loved Brody though, only that she had a connection with him due to their child.\n \n\nJessica reminded her sister that she'd had a connection with Brody once too. Natalie declared that Jessica had destroyed things on her own, because she hadn't been able to accept Brody's mistakes. Natalie accused Jessica of taking a \"vacation from reality\" when she'd dropped everyone from her life, but Jessica complained that it hadn't been her fault. Natalie advised her that life had continued; it hadn't stopped just because Jessica had removed herself from it.\n \n\nNatalie swore that she would always love Jessica, but she wouldn't be the excuse that Jessica wanted for everything that had happened. Natalie also wouldn't allow Jessica to take her happiness away. Jessica accused Natalie of wanting Tess to return so that Natalie wouldn't feel guilty. Natalie retorted that she probably liked Tess better anyway. Jessica rolled up her sleeve and slugged Natalie in the eye, just as Viki appeared.\n \n\nViki was appalled, though Jessica insisted that Natalie had deserved it. Natalie was a bitch, and she was seeing Brody, Jessica stated. Viki advised the women that Bree had heard the two arguing, and she'd been upset. Jessica took off for the little girl's bedroom in order to console her. Viki wanted to talk to Natalie, but Natalie was eager to get to work. She was sick of the entire thing, and she asserted that everything was not her fault. She, Brody, and Liam were a family, and no one could stop them, Natalie announced.\n \n\nJessica returned to Viki after Natalie had gone, and she revealed that she'd apologized to Bree. Jessica was aware that she would have to figure out how to deal with her anger. She only knew that there would be no more Tess to do it. She wondered if Tina had treated Viki in the same manner. Viki acknowledged that she and Tina had lots of problems, but they would always be sisters.\n \n\nJessica admitted that she'd felt like Natalie had just been waiting to \"swoop in\" and take Brody away. Viki advised her daughter that it took more than one person to be in a relationship. Jessica believed that Natalie should have just left Brody alone.\n \n\nJohn showed Brody the photo of the tape recorder and noted that the recorder was missing from the evidence compiled after Gigi's murder. According to the log, Brody had been the last person to view the evidence, and John wondered if Brody might be familiar with it. Brody pulled the bagged recorder from his pocket. John was annoyed and demanded that Brody explain why he had the recorder in his possession.\n \n\nBrody explained that he had seen the recorder among the evidence, and he was certain that it was the same recorder that Natalie had carried when she'd argued with Marty on the roof. The men discussed the possibility. Brody declared that he had listened to the tape, and he wanted John to do the same.\n \n\nBrody turned on the recorder, and the men heard nothing but complete silence. They were interrupted when another police officer walked in to tell them about a phone call. The mayor's husband had called regarding a shooting at La Boulaie, and it was possible that the mayor had been the one to shoot someone.\n \n\nAt the Sun, Jack begged his father to reveal the secret about John, but Todd refused. He wanted Jack to prove \"you're my kid,\" with his actions, but Jack admitted that he thought his stint at the office was merely for some bonding time. Todd had to keep an eye on Jack around the clock, Todd informed his son. Jack wondered how Todd could get any work done, and he suggested that Todd give him lessons on how to act like Todd. Jack assumed that Todd's secret was stupid anyway.\n \n\nTodd advised his son that there was no need to be like him, especially because so many people hated Todd. He had done some horrible things. Jack replied that he wouldn't make the same mistakes as Todd, but Todd noted that Jack wasn't off to a very good start. Jack asked for pointers, and he thought that he should have something that he could use to negotiate over with John, should the need arise.\n \n\nTodd agreed and had a lesson for Jack. \"When in doubt, shut the hell up. Especially when dealing with cops and chicks. Information is power.\" Todd always wanted something in return before he disclosed any secret. It had to be of equal or greater value, he explained. Todd was already aware that the something from Jack would be of greater value, because he and Jack would be allies. He handed Jack an envelope.\n \n\nJack pulled out a document and looked at it. It was Liam's paternity information. Todd announced that he was holding onto the information until it was needed, but they needed to get to work. Some unknown Japanese company had outbid Todd for a satellite, and he wanted Jack to research that company. It was called Origami Cogs. Jack exclaimed that he had no idea how to go about it, and Todd lost his temper. He was certain Jack was able to use the Internet.\n \n\nStarr arrived at Capricorn and found T\u00e9a and Blair commiserating over a bottle and some bar food. The older women took turns explaining how they'd visited Rex to extend their sympathy, but they had found Rex to be angry. They understood and realized that Rex and Shane needed time. Blair announced that she would keep Jack away from them, and T\u00e9a suggested that they all keep a low profile. Starr informed Blair that there were other problems to contend with.\n \n\nStarr believed that Sam had been acting strangely and had claimed to be talking to a man at their pool. Blair advised her daughter that it was normal and harmless to have an imaginary friend, and T\u00e9a concurred. Starr advised them that Sam had mentioned a line on the man's face, and she pointed to her own face in order to show the women the placement of the scar.\n \n\nBlair thought that Starr was making too big of a deal over it, though she noted that Todd's original face had a scar in the very same place. Starr agreed that it meant something. Blair remembered that Sam had been looking at old photos of Todd when he'd been out at the pool. He'd probably made his imaginary friend to resemble his dad, because Todd hadn't been spending very much time with Sam. Blair assumed that the little boy probably still had one of those old photos in his custody.\n \n\nStarr admitted that her mother was probably right, and Blair gloated that her daughter had finally agreed with her on something. Starr thought that they should talk to Sam, anyway, but Blair recalled how Starr had spoken about the man on the wheel when she'd been younger. Starr failed to see the similarity, as she reminded her mother that the man had turned out to be real. Starr had a bad feeling about Sam, and she planned to talk to him.\n \n\nAt the mansion, Echo overheard Rex as he vowed to hurt T\u00e9a and Blair. She hoped that he didn't mean it. Rex was short with her and advised her that he didn't want her interference. Echo insisted that Rex tell her what was happening, because she knew that Rex was after the women. Rex referred to T\u00e9a and Blair as co-conspirators in Gigi's death, and Echo disagreed with him. She didn't think the assessment was fair.\n \n\nRex suggested that she ask Shane about fair, but Echo replied that there were other ways to get back at the women, besides causing them physical harm. Rex assured Echo that T\u00e9a and Blair would watch as Todd and Jack were ruined, and that was his plan. Rex had plotted to go after Todd's holdings and wallet. Echo wasn't sure that Rex would be able to do that, because Rex didn't have the experience that Todd did.\n \n\nRex explained that he would continue to set up new subsidiaries of Buchanan Enterprises, and Todd wouldn't be able to get any information on those companies. Rex had hired a specialist, and his tracks were covered. Rex had already done some business as Origami Cogs. Echo thought it was an interesting name, and Rex revealed that the letters were an anagram for Gigi Morasco. \n \n\nEcho was impressed. \"Let me know if you need any help,\" she told her son. Rex thanked her for \"threatening to interfere.\" He was glad that someone had actually cared about him. Once Echo had gone, Rex turned to Gigi's photograph on the mantel. \"Hope she bought all that. Cause you and me, we know the truth. One way or another, Blair and T\u00e9a are gonna feel what you felt,\" Rex promised.\n \n\nJohn and Brody showed up at La Boulaie to investigate the shooting. Dorian told them that she had no idea who the dead man was, and David proclaimed that Dorian had been holding a gun. After some investigation, John announced that the gun used in the killing was not the same gun that Dorian had waved around. Dorian was happy that John had proclaimed her to be innocent, but she thought that David should be arrested instead.\n \n\nDorian informed John that David was guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, and he'd been involved in a plot with Ionia to kill her. Dorian showed John the letter. David contended that someone was setting him up, and he was innocent. John suggested the couple \"sort out\" their issues.\n \n\nAfter the police were gone, Dorian and David continued to argue. David declared his love for Dorian, and he called her his \"passion flower.\" Dorian ordered David to pack his things and get out of La Boulaie.\n \n\nTodd arrived at Llanfair and found Viki cleaning up the remnants of the broken picture frame that had contained a photo of the two of them. Todd wondered if he'd done something to irritate Viki. She replied that he hadn't angered her recently. Todd was her brother and she would always love him, Viki added.\n \n\nTodd suggested that she remove the photo of Todd with the original face from another picture frame and replace it with the newer one. Viki refused; she loved the old photo too. She admitted that she had no idea who had broken the frame. The man, who had almost started inside until he saw Todd, listened from outside.\n \n\nNatalie arrived and walked into John's office, looking for him. The office was empty, but she spotted the tape recorder on John's desk. \"What is my tape recorder doing here?\" she asked. Natalie was confused, but she began to have flashbacks. \"Oh, my God, it's finally coming back. I remember,\" she declared.\n \n\nNatalie quickly had one flashback after another, and she was surprised when John returned. She asked him why the recorder was evidence in Gigi's case, because Natalie had been in possession of the recorder on the roof. John disclosed that he had no idea why Gigi had had the object or where she had obtained it. He had listened to it and thought that Natalie should ask Brody what was on the tape. Just then, Brody walked into the office.\n \n\nJack sat at a computer at the Sun and unsuccessfully tried to obtain information on Origami Cogs. Everything that he typed into the search engines revealed that nothing was found. Frustrated, Jack headed for the office door. He'd had enough. The man with Todd's original face was on the other side of the door, just about to go inside.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian and David discover a mysterious dead man in their backyard and call the cops. John knows that neither of them did it but wonders who did. Not far away, after original Todd killed Agent Kent, unknown and hiding unseen at Viki's, he calls his contact to inform him he is not going anywhere, since \"another guy\" who calls himself Todd Manning has stolen his life. The Todd we know then talks to Jack at The Sun and tells his son he expects him to work and earn his way. He entrusts him with secrets that nobody else can know including the fact that Liam is John's while everybody mistakenly believes he is Brody's child. Meanwhile, John knows that there is some \"significance\" on the tape recorder that they uncovered right after Marty tried to kill Natalie. Brody keeps the tape recorder in question and hesitates to tell John that Marty knows that Liam is John's and not his. Jessica admits she will never forgive Natalie and Brody for being together when he was supposed to be her fianc\u00e9 and father of her child. Starr goes to tell Blair and Tea that she has some concerns about the \"coincidence\" that Sam has an \"imaginary friend\" whom he describes as having a line on his face just like the Todd they all knew many years ago before Sam was born.",
