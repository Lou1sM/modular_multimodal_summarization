Layla promised her comatose sister that she wouldn't leave until she knew that Evangeline was all right. Layla explained to Cristian that she always thought that Evangeline was listening, so there was no way she could tell Evangeline that Layla and Cristian were getting married. Layla's mother entered the room to Layla's questioning about what was wrong with Evangeline. Mrs. Williamson explained that Evangeline was having congestion problems, and that she got infections from time to time.\n\n\nLayla wanted to call a doctor in order to ask some questions about her sister's condition, but her mother accused Layla of not believing her. She insisted that her daughter was going to get better again and she would take her back home. A doctor entered to check on Evangeline and announced that there was no change in her condition. Wondering what was actually going on, Layla and Cristian followed the doctor out of the room.\n\n\nThe doctor explained that Evangeline did get infections sometimes and got better with the help of antibiotics. However, Evangeline didn't have an infection  -- she needed a ventilator in order to breathe. The doctor informed the pair that Mrs. Williamson was having trouble adjusting to the fact that Evangeline's respiratory system was failing, and that she would never be able to breathe on her own again.\n\n\nThe doctor urged Layla to make a decision and left. Cristian and Layla discussed how they had arrived to announce their engagement, but suddenly Layla had to make a huge decision about her sister. Layla's mother entered the hallway and snapped on Layla; she insisted that the decision wasn't up to Layla. She accused her daughter of always wanting Evangeline out of the way because Layla always wanted what Evangeline had. In addition, Layla wouldn't have to feel guilty about stealing her sister's man anymore.\n\n\nLayla insisted that she had always loved her sister. Cristian stepped in and reminded Mrs. Williamson that things had been over been him and Evangeline before the accident. Mrs. Williamson claimed that Evangeline was going to get well and return home, and went back into the hospital room. Cristian assured Layla that her mother only lashed out because she was scared, but Layla knew that her mother meant every word. Layla didn't know what to say or do, but Cristian told her that they would figure it out together.\n\n\nTodd stood outside of T\ufffda's hospital room when Blair walked up, intending to check on T\ufffda. Blair asked how T\ufffda and Dani were doing, and Todd told her that there was only fear left. Blair wondered if that applied to Todd as well. Todd covered by telling Blair the good news -- Hannah confessed that she never saw Todd push Marty down the stairs. Blair was happy for him, even though Todd reminded her that she was the first one to believe that he was guilty.\n\n\nBlair apologized, and Todd changed the subject to Blair and her \"new life.\" Blair divulged that Elijah had proposed to her, but she had to think about it. Todd wondered what there was to think about. Blair confessed that she had never thought that she would get married again. Todd asked if she loved Elijah, which Blair confirmed. Todd asked what she was waiting for because \"life is short.\" He wanted her to be happy before it was too late.\n\n\nBlair agreed and said she would find Elijah when he was done with his client. Todd urged her to leave him a message. Blair thanked him for the sincerity, and he went into T\ufffda's room to check on her and Dani. Blair took out her phone and called Elijah. She got Elijah's voicemail and left him a message saying that she was ready to give him an answer.\n\n\nNora, John, and Marty discussed Hannah's case in John's office. The evidence against her was irrefutable, but Hannah wanted a deal because she knew \"who really pushed Marty.\" Even though Marty was shaky about it, the three agreed that they wouldn't make a deal with Hannah. Nora promised to go hard on Hannah about Ford just in case she let something slip about Marty. Nora and John agreed that Elijah was too good of a lawyer to let Hannah go down for something she didn't do.\n\n\nNora offered to rethink the deal if Marty wanted to go through with it, but John didn't think they could trust Hannah's word since her story kept changing. They wanted to make sure that Hannah got her story straight and came clean about what really happened to Ford and to Marty. The three reasoned that Elijah had enough time with his client and left John's office.\n\n\nIn the interrogation room, Elijah threatened that Hannah would get hurt if she tried to tell anyone that he was guilty of the attacks on both Ford and Marty. Hannah was sick of lying and wanted to get the truth out, but reasoned that at least jail would keep her safe from Elijah. Elijah informed her that, even if she were safe from him, Cole wouldn't be. Hannah, worried about Cole, wondered if Elijah would murder his own client. Elijah told her that he would be the least expected and told Hannah that she should confess. Hannah wanted to know why John had any reason to believe her. Elijah said that cops only cared about closing cases. He warned her to follow his instructions if she didn't want to get hurt.\n\n\nJohn, Marty, and Nora entered the interrogation room, and Elijah informed them that something was wrong with Hannah. On the floor, Hannah rocked back and forth saying \"I did it for Cole\" over and over again. Elijah explained that when he told Hannah to stick with the truth, her eyes went dead and she started mumbling. Marty attempted to communicate with Hannah, but Hannah suddenly apologized for pushing Marty down the stairs. Hannah said that she did it because she wanted Starr and Cole to break up so Cole could love her.\n\n\nIn a choppy explanation, Hannah said that Cole didn't hurt her like Ford did, which was why she \"had to hurt Ford.\" The four agreed that Hannah was in no mental state to testify and thought she would be better off at St. Anne's for the night to await a psychiatric evaluation. Hannah confessed to lying about everything, which prompted John to ask her why. \"Cole,\" she replied. \"Everything's for Cole.\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, Starr told Cole that she would tell him the entire story of the previous week after she checked on James. Cole followed Starr into James's room, where Ford was sitting. Even though Ford said that James hadn't woken up yet, Starr began to talk to him. James opened his eyes and Starr asked how he was feeling. As he said that everything hurt, Cole asked why Ford was there. Starr told him that Ford was James's brother. Ford wanted a minute alone with his brother, so Starr and Cole left the room.\n\n\nFord wanted James to say that he wasn't interested in Starr. Ford warned his brother that Starr was trouble. James said he could take care of himself like he did when he was with his dad. Speaking of their father, Ford had good news -- their father had been arrested, so James was free. Ford wanted to help his brother, but James snapped that the time for that had come and gone because Ford had left James alone with their father.\n\n\nFord explained that he had wanted to make a name for himself and return to get his brother, but James accused Ford of forgetting about returning for him. James needed someone, but believed his brother was too busy with women. Ford vowed to fix things and told his brother that they were going to work together from that moment on. James confessed that he was always proud to be Ford's brother and that he had always wanted to be like him. Ford promised that he would make James proud again.\n\n\nStarr finished telling Cole her story and claimed the blame for everything. Starr just wanted Cole to understand why she wanted to make sure that James would be all right. After arguing about how Cole could ever believe anything Hannah said, Cole suggested that they go home. Starr agreed, but wanted to tell James that she was leaving.\n\n\nStarr entered James's room and asked Ford for a minute alone with James. Starr explained that she had worked everything out with Cole by explaining that she just wanted to keep Cole and Hope safe. \"And he believed you?\" James asked. Starr informed James about everything that had happened with Cole and Hannah. She lied that Cole never believed anything that Hannah had told Cole about the alleged affair between Starr and James. James took Starr's hand and the two avoided saying goodbye.\n\n\nStarr took her hand back and promised she would check on him in a couple days. As Starr turned to leave, James taught her a saying that existed in Ohio: \"You shoot a guy, you owe him.\"\n\n\nOutside James's room, Ford sharply told Cole that he was lucky Hannah didn't hurt Cole because she was \"psycho.\" Playing on Cole's nerves, Ford commented on how long Starr had been in James's room. Cole wasn't worried. Starr emerged from the room and took Cole's hand. The two left to go home and be with their daughter.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair is ready to give Eli an answer to his marriage proposal. Little does she know, however, what he is up to. He meets privately with Hannah, telling her she will regret it if she crosses him and names him as the assailant for both Ford and of Marty. He tells her he can get her \"immunity\" if she confesses to both crimes. And he has her appear for Marty, John and Nora as though she's emotionally disturbed and not responsible for her actions. Meanwhile, while James is recovering, everybody can see that he and Starr have feelings for each other. His brother, Robert Ford, warns him not to get mixed up with Starr and Cole asks her about her feelings for James.",
