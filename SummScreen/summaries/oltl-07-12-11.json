Jack stopped short though; he decided that he couldn't give up on his search for information on Origami Cogs. Outside of the office door, Vimal found the man peering inside, and he demanded to know what the man was doing.\n\n\nThe man introduced himself as Nicholas Kent, and Vimal revealed that he was Todd's new associate. Vimal wanted the man to provide some identification, or he would have to call security. He asked the man if he had an appointment. The man stated that he was the trash collector, and he didn't need an appointment. He hadn't wanted to disturb Mr. Manning, and he had stood looking inside to see if the boss might be there.\n\n\nThe man advised Vimal that he had been at the company since the first day, and he was responsible for the paper's first issue. Vimal apologized for being gruff, and the men shook hands. Vimal explained that Todd didn't like to be disturbed, and the man agreed that he was familiar with that. Inside the office, Jack decided that he wanted to get some snacks, after all, and he walked past the two men who were standing in the hallway.\n\n\nThe man entered Todd's office and locked the door. He looked at the framed and blown up copies of former front pages, and he sat at Todd's desk. He looked at the family photos that adorned the desk, and he was displeased. He began to have flashbacks to a former life. \"You think you can just take my life, Mr. Manning?\" the man wondered. He was determined to learn who Todd really was. Jack returned with his snacks and found the door locked.\n\n\nThe man searched the Internet for some kind of clue as Jack fumbled with his key and made his way into the office. \"Mr. Manning, I presume,\" the man said as he ran to hide. Jack's arms were laden with snack machine packages. The man hit Jack on the head from behind, and he didn't realize that it was Jack until after the boy fell to the floor.\n\n\nThe man was upset and called out to Jack. He was sorry; he hadn't known it was Jack. The teenager was unaware of what was going on, and he called out for his dad.\n\n\nBo paid a visit to Rex at the mansion and apologized for not being around for Gigi's funeral service. Matthew had been relocated to another hospital after having a setback, Bo explained. He thought that Rex looked different in some way, and Bo was mystified about Rex trading Gigi's heart for Clint's assets. \"It's not you, Balsom,\" Bo added.\n\n\nRex stated that he'd changed, that he had learned that the world was cruel, and he needed money to exist in that world. He had to protect Shane after what had happened to Gigi because of Jack. Bo replied that Jack would eventually learn his lesson the hard way. \"If there's any justice,\" Rex retorted. \"What's this really all about, Balsom?\" Bo asked.\n\n\nBo thought there was something else that didn't fit, and Rex mentioned that John suspected that Todd had paid off Brad's father. Rex felt that he couldn't be blamed for wanting to protect his son. Bo was sorry that at times money corrupted the system. Bo pointed out that he had money, but that didn't always protect people. He noted all of the problems that Matthew had gone through. He didn't want Rex to change because of what had happened.\n\n\nRex didn't agree with Bo. He hadn't been able to protect his family, and Gigi had been murdered. Bo asked whether Rex wanted to even the score. Rex informed Bo that T\u00e9a and Blair had visited him on the pretense of extending their sympathies, but he figured they were more relieved that Jack hadn't been held for Gigi's murder. Rex wondered where the women had been during the time that Jack had bullied Shane.\n\n\nGigi was dead, and Shane was troubled, Rex concluded. Bo agreed that they'd been through some terrible times, and this was the worst. Bo added that he understood Rex's behavior, as Bo had shut down after his own son had died. He'd pushed everyone away and had almost died himself. He didn't want that to happen to Rex. Rage was really grief trying to get out, Bo maintained. Rex would only hurt himself.\n\n\nBo believed that the others would get what they deserved, and he was certain that Gigi wouldn't approve of Rex's behavior. Besides, Shane needed Rex, too, Bo pronounced. Bo wondered whether Rex had heard him. Rex swore that he had, but Bo asked whether Rex had actually listened to him. Rex admitted that he couldn't drop it, because a murderer had walked free. It had dishonored Gigi, he added.\n\n\nRex was angry and wondered if Bo had forgotten what had happened to his own son. He suggested that Bo give advice after the person who had hurt Matthew went free too. Bo said contact him if Rex wanted help, but Rex was beyond words. \"Just go,\" he yelled at Bo. Once the older man was gone, Rex sank to the floor. He was despondent.\n\n\nIn John's office at the police station, Natalie questioned Brody about Gigi having possession of the tape recorder that Natalie herself had held on the rooftop. She wondered why John had suggested she ask Brody about what was heard on the tape. Brody explained that he'd been going over the evidence found on the floor where Gigi had been located. He'd listened to the tape, but it was blank.\n\n\nNatalie was confused. She recalled listening to the tape, and while she couldn't remember what had been on it, she was certain that she and Marty wouldn't have fought over a blank tape. Brody suggested that it was possible that it hadn't been the same device, or maybe Marty had erased it. John sat and listened to the conversation thoughtfully, observing Brody and Natalie closely. Brody demanded to understand why John had told Natalie to ask Brody about the tape when John had listened to it himself.\n\n\nBrody was on the defensive, and he wondered why John was trying to make him look like \"the bad guy.\" John pointed out that no one could understand why a blank tape would be so important. Natalie added that Brody had been aware that she and Marty had been fighting over the tape, and she wondered why he'd never said anything to her about finding it.\n\n\nBrody explained that he'd found the recorder after he'd seen Natalie. They'd probably never find out who had erased it. Natalie was certain that she'd heard something on the tape, and John recalled that Natalie had run to John to tell him about it. They'd never gotten around to talking about it. Brody didn't think it mattered any longer, especially because Liam was back at home. He wanted to forget it.\n\n\nNatalie didn't think any of it made sense. She was aware that Gigi had been heading off to her wedding, and there would have been no reason for her to be carrying a blank tape around. Natalie wanted to know what had happened after the evidence had been collected. John explained that he'd been present when the evidence had been tagged, and after that, Brody had been the one to deal with all of it.\n\n\nBrody was angry. \"Would you get off my back?\" he shouted. He hadn't erased the tape, and he wondered why he and Natalie couldn't just move on. John recapped that Marty had killed someone, Todd had helped Marty get away, and Todd had gotten Jack off. Brody mentioned the body they'd found at La Boulaie, and John thought that all roads led to Todd. He gave the pair their orders.\n\n\nJohn wanted research done on the new victim and Todd. After Brody and Natalie left the office, John picked up the bagged recorder and looked thoughtfully in Brody's direction.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian demanded that David leave the premises. David continued to plead his case, explaining that he loved Dorian and would never cheat on her. He was sure that someone was setting him up, and if Dorian couldn't accept it, he wanted her to shoot him. He couldn't live without her. Dorian replied that she would have shot him when she'd had the chance, if they hadn't spotted the dead body first.\n\n\nDavid couldn't believe it. He reminded her of Clint setting him up when David had been held prisoner in the Moroccan jail. He thought it was the same thing. Dorian ordered him to go, as Blair arrived with a copy of the Sun in her hands. Blair had seen the photos of David and Ionia in the paper. \"These aren't real, are they?\" Blair asked her aunt. Blair couldn't believe that they were.\n\n\n\"A picture is worth a thousand words,\" Dorian declared. She added that David insisted the whole thing was a setup, but Dorian had the bikini top that Ionia had left behind, along with the note and gun sent in a package. David had also accused Dorian of using the gun. Blair was totally confused, and more so after Dorian mentioned the dead body they'd found on the property. Blair demanded that Dorian provide more information, especially because Blair had children who lived at the house.\n\n\nDorian was more concerned with her split with David, and she continued to go on about her state of affairs. Blair had questions, though, and Dorian stopped to inform her that no one knew who the dead man was. Blair thought the man could be Sam's friend, and she agreed that she should prepare her children for questioning. Blair told Dorian about Sam's imaginary friend, and she asked if the dead man had a scar on his face.\n\n\nDorian was not aware of whether he'd had a scar, and Blair admitted she was worried about Sam. Dorian suggested that Sam had been the killer, which wouldn't surprise her, because he was the son of \"Mad Margaret and Twisted Todd.\" Dorian also suggested that the boy had chatted with the killer, and not the dead man. Blair was concerned that her son might have met a killer, but Dorian switched the subject back to David.\n\n\nBlair believed David's affair was indeed a setup. Dorian thought that Blair should talk to Sam, and Blair concurred.\n\n\nBaz found Starr staring forlornly at her laptop at Capricorn, where they'd arranged to meet to work on their music. Starr explained that it was an old photo of herself with her father, and Baz was puzzled. Starr explained that it had been her father's old face, prior to his having plastic surgery. He'd disappeared for a while, but when he had returned, she'd been the only one to realize it was him. The two of them had been close.\n\n\nStarr spoke about her childhood, and Baz noted that he hadn't been able to enjoy what Starr had. He thought it was too late to make it up with his own father. Starr further explained that Sam had an imaginary friend, who had a line or scar across his face. Her little brother hadn't been familiar with Todd prior to the plastic surgery. She guessed Sam could have seen pictures.\n\n\n\"So how come you don't buy it?\" Baz inquired. He realized that Starr didn't believe the friend was fake. Starr admitted she should listen to her mother's opinion that Sam had made the friend up. Baz was aware that Starr didn't believe the man was made-up, but Starr insisted there could be no other explanation. \"Anything's possible,\" Baz replied. Starr realized that she would have to find out on her own if the man were real.\n\n\nStarr and Baz worked on their music, and they both agreed it had turned out extremely well. Baz thought it was good enough to \"take on the road.\" Starr looked at the old photo of herself and her dad again, after she was finished with Baz.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Todd tried to guess who had broken the picture frame that held the photo of Viki and Todd. He didn't like the new frame that Viki had replaced it with, and he thought the photo with his old face had a nicer frame. \"Old face, new face, I still love you,\" Viki replied. Viki told him that she honestly didn't know who had broken the frame, but she was beginning to think that it really hadn't been an accident.\n\n\nViki had locked the doors, and when she'd returned, the doors had been opened. The broken frame had been on the floor. Viki had gone outside and called out, and she'd believed that someone had been watching her. Todd repeated it all back, and Viki sheepishly agreed it sounded ridiculous. She'd just had a feeling that someone else was there. David arrived with a couple of suitcases and called out for Viki.\n\n\nDavid revealed that he'd been locked out of house and heart, and he blamed Todd for printing the photos. Todd denied that he was to blame, especially if David wanted to cheat. David agreed, and Todd announced that he had to leave to check on Jack at the office. Todd advised Viki that he would let her know the details of Sam's birthday party.\n\n\nDavid proclaimed that Viki was the one to blame instead, because Viki could have convinced Dorian that David wasn't cheating. David was ready to move in, but Viki didn't think it was a good idea. David mentioned the dead body found at La Boulaie, but Viki found it difficult to get details. David was focused on the end of his relationship with Dorian.\n\n\nViki didn't think David should move in if he were cheating on Dorian. David agreed that the photos were real, but they were \"not what they seem.\" He explained that Ionia had broken onto his property and had thrown herself at him. He had no connection to the woman other than the movie they'd filmed. He was sure it was a setup and wondered who could have given the photos to Todd.\n\n\nDavid stated that he'd dreamed of Dorian when he had been in the prison, and that was what had gotten him through that ordeal. He'd never cheat on her, David repeated. He began to cry. \"I think she's lost without me,\" David sobbed. Viki was sure that Dorian wouldn't listen to her. David insisted that he'd never do what Charlie had done to Viki.\n\n\nDavid wanted Viki to find out who was setting him up, because she had the ability to do so. Someone was ruining his life and Dorian's, David said as he began to cry again. Viki agreed to help David.\n\n\nTodd returned to the newspaper, and the first person he saw was Vimal. Todd was angry and grabbed his new associate. He ordered him to find a new satellite to buy. Todd stormed into his office and found Jack lying on the floor. The man hid and managed to sneak out as Todd was concentrating on his son. \"I think someone knocked me out,\" Jack reported. \"Did you see who it was?\" Todd asked.\n\n\nJack explained that he had left the office for a few minutes to get some food and had returned and found the door locked. Someone had hit him from behind after he'd walked inside. Todd phoned security as Jack sat at the computer. He realized that it wasn't the way he'd left it, and he advised his dad that someone had done something to it.\n\n\nTodd was beginning to realize that something was going on. Someone had broken into Viki's place, too, he told his son. \"I know who's doing this to us,\" Todd announced. He believed it was Origami Cogs. Jack informed his father that he still hadn't been able to locate any information on the company.\n\n\nVimal encountered the man out in the hallway again. He asked the man to clean up his office too. \"Still lots of trash in there,\" the man motioned to Todd's office. He hadn't finished with it yet.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Original Todd leaves Viki's home and goes to the Sun office. Still unseen, he goes in and gets on current Todd's computer while both Todd and Jack are out of the office. The Todd we know informs his son that there is an \"organization\" with the name oragami cogs that wishes to do him harm and he needs Jack's help and computer knowledge to combat this enemy of their family. He does not seem to know, however, that Rex Balsam is behind the organization. Original Todd locks the door and Jack cannot enter when he returns from lunch. Original Todd then knocks Jack out so that he cannot see him. But when he remembers \"his\" son, Jack, he rushes to make sure he is ok after being knocked out. He also attempts to get past Vimal Patel who does not know what to say or do and who finds Todd suspicious. Dorian believes that David is cheating on her and his \"partner\" wants to kill her although Blair agrees with David that somebody may be setting him up and Dorian is making false accusations of him. Both Blair and Dorian are concerned, however, about Sam and his \"imaginary friend\" whom he tells them has a line on his face just like the scar that original Todd had (and still has) when Sam never met or knew original Todd. David goes to talk to Viki to urge her to help him get Dorian back and to investigate who may be setting him up. Bo goes to talk to Rex, concerned about what he might be planning and urges him to deal with his grief of the loss of Gigi the way Bo knows he failed to do when he lost his son. Brody intends to never let Natalie or John know that John is the father of Liam. They grill him about the tape recorder that he does not want them to ever know about revealing that Marty knows that John is Liam's father. And he's determined to never let them know what he heard on the tape.",
