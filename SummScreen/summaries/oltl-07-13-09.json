    "soap_central": "\nAunt Misbehavin'\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Markko told his father that he would never give Langston up.  As the entire dinner party watched in utter surprise, Markko grabbed Langston's hand and proceeded to march upstairs.  As they walked off, Markko advised his father that they were headed to Langston's bedroom and challenged Mr. Rivera to stop them.  Turning his attention to Dorian, Mr. Rivera blamed her for his son's irrational behavior.  Shaun defended Dorian, but Mr. Rivera was certain that the teens were going to have sex in Langston's bedroom.\n\n\nUpstairs in Langston's bedroom, the teens contemplated their next move.  After toying with the idea of having sex, Markko expressed his regret over disrespecting his father, but Markko related that he would never allow his father to interfere in his relationship with Langston.  Realizing that he needed his parents' financial support, Markko decided to attempt to make amends with his father.\n\n\nBack downstairs, Mr. Rivera threatened to head upstairs and drag Markko out of the house, but Shaun, Charlie, and Moe blocked the stairwell and advised Mr. Rivera that they wouldn't allow him to cause a scene.  The men cautioned Mr. Rivera to work on his relationship with Markko and to avoid threatening his son's relationship with Langston.   Meanwhile, Dorian, Viki, and Noelle tried to convince Mrs. Rivera to trust Markko.  Mrs. Rivera was willing to give Markko a chance, but she was certain that her husband would stand in the way.  As the dinner guests tried to reason with the Riveras, Markko and Langston returned downstairs, hand in hand.  Viki urged Mr. Rivera to patch things up with his son.\n\n\nAfter proclaiming his love for Langston, Markko asked his father to respect his decision to continue his relationship with Langston.   Placing a hand on Markko shoulder, Mr. Rivera said that he was certain that something could be worked out.  To everyone's surprise, Mr. Rivera ordered Markko to stop dating Langston.  He stated that Markko wouldn't be allowed to return home if he continued to date Langston.  An infuriated Markko refused to end his relationship with Langston.  Reminding Markko that he no longer resided at the Rivera residence, Mr. Rivera grabbed his wife's hand and announced that they were leaving.\n\n\nAfter the Riveras had left, Langston tried to reassure Markko that his father would eventually have a change of heart.  When Markko mentioned that he was homeless, Langston suggested that he move into La Boulaie.  Dorian appeared bothered by Langston's suggestion.  Citing that La Boulaie was overcrowded, Dorian stated that Markko needed to find another place to live.  Appalled that Dorian would refuse to allow Markko to stay at La Boulaie, Langston blamed Dorian for creating the entire mess.  When Langston asked Dorian where she expected Markko to live, Viki intervened and stated that Markko was welcome to stay at Llanfair.  Dorian glared at Viki.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cris, questioned Kyle about Oliver's past.  Unwilling to reveal the explicit details of Oliver's life, Kyle simply warned Cris that Oliver wasn't the person that he appeared to be.  Concerned about Layla's welfare, Cris urged Kyle to provide him with any information that could prevent Layla from getting hurt by Oliver.  After a long hesitation, Kyle remarked, \"I'd warn any woman I was friends with not to get involved with Fish!\"  As he opened his wallet to pay his tab, Kyle noticed a picture that he had taken with Oliver during their college days.  In the photo, the two men were smiling and Oliver had his arm around Kyle's shoulders.  Kyle appeared to be bothered by the memories he once shared with Oliver.\n\n\nAfter their date, Layla and Oliver returned to the apartment.   Stating that Cris would arrive home late, Layla pulled Oliver close to her and the two shared a kiss.  As the situation intensified, Oliver pulled away and told Layla that he respected her too much to continue.  Layla assured him that she was ready to move forward, and the two continued to kiss passionately.\n\n\nCris returned home and interrupted a near sexual encounter between Layla and Oliver.  After a nervous Layla left the room, Cris informed Oliver that he had spoken with Kyle, who had warned Cris that Oliver shouldn't be trusted.   Insisting that Kyle was a con artist, Oliver suggested that Kyle was jealous of Oliver's relationship with Layla and wanted a chance with her.  \n\n\nBefore Cris could question Oliver any further, Layla interrupted the discussion. Disgusted with Layla's poor judgment, an angry Cris walked away.  Layla apologized for Cris's behavior.  Layla implied that they should continue their date in the bedroom, but a nervous Oliver quickly reminded her that she started work at the police station in the morning.  As he extended his hand to say goodnight, Layla kissed him.  Cris entered the room and observed the exchange between his roommates.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy strategically placed her underwear throughout the apartment.  To Stacy's displeasure, Roxy knocked on the door and entered the loft.  Upon noticing Stacy's bra, Roxy referred to Stacy as desperate.  Pleased to update Roxy on the change of events, Stacy remarked to a startled Roxy that she and Rex were lovers.  After observing Roxy's strange behavior, Stacy realized that Roxy had gone to the loft in search of the missing bag of blood.  Roxy was certain that Stacy was in cahoots with the crazy nurse who had stuck her with a hypodermic needle and had run off with the bag of blood.  \n\n\nStacy denied having any involvement with the mysterious nurse, and suggested that Roxy had told someone during a drunken stupor.  Roxy's reaction caused Stacy to wonder if anyone had discovered that Stacy's stem cells never saved Shane. Demanding answers from Roxy, Stacy inquired about the real donor's whereabouts.  Roxy informed Stacy that the unconscious patient had died, and reminded Stacy that the missing blood needed to be recovered immediately.  Unconcerned, Stacy continued to brag about her relationship with Rex.  Before leaving, Roxy told Stacy that she would never have a place in Rex's heart.\n\n\nAt an unknown location, the wacky nurse who had encountered Roxy, worked on crossword puzzles and spoke to the blood donor, who was covered with a sheet.  As he began to move from under the sheet, the nurse remarked, \"You've been asleep for a long time.  I've gotten your stem cells away from Roxanne and gave the bag to Stacy.  Everything is just as you wanted it to be!\"  The nurse told the unknown patient that Roxy was convinced that she had murdered him.   As the donor continued to move restlessly, the nurse arranged his bed sheets and stated that she had no idea why he wanted Stacy Morasco to receive the credit for saving his grandson.\n\n\nBack at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, while Kyle continued to study the photograph of him and Oliver, Roxy stormed into the caf\u00e9 and confronted him.  Roxy accused Kyle of sending the crazy nurse to steal the blood.  Kyle denied any involvement and assured Roxy that he had his own problems and no longer had any interest in Roxy's dilemma.\n\n\nConvinced that Kyle was innocent, Roxy was certain that Kyle's bad mood involved a special woman.  Upon noticing the photo of Kyle and Oliver, Roxy realized that Kyle's problem was complicated.  After Kyle left, Roxy mumbled to herself, \"I need to figure out who is playing with the devils blood!\"\n\n\nBack at the unknown location, the nurse administered medication to the patient and commented on his remarkable recovery.  Smiling down at her covered patient, the nurse stated, \"We were lucky to find this spot where no one can find us!  Soon you'll meet that family of yours. Won't they be surprised?\"  As she exited the room, photos of Rex and Shane sat on the patient's nightstand.\n\n\nAt the cottage, Gigi asked Rex if Stacy's claims about having sex with him were true.  As Rex attempted to answer her, Gigi stated that she knew that Stacy had lied about her encounter with Rex.  Wracked with guilt, Rex told Gigi that he owed her the truth.  Before Rex could give Gigi and answer, Shane entered the room and interrupted the conversation.  When Shane questioned what was going on, Rex and Gigi decided that the time had come to tell their son the truth.\n\n\nGigi told Shane that she had never cheated on his father, but Shane refused to believe his mother.   When Shane continued to hurl insults at his mother, Rex ordered his son to allow Gigi to explain.  Gigi told a stunned Shane about Stacy's blackmail. Rex informed his son that his Aunt Stacy had refused to save his life unless Gigi ended her relationship with Rex.  Shocked to learn of Stacy's scheme, Shane apologized for the rude behavior that he had displayed toward his mother.  Rex watched as mother and son shared a loving embrace.  \n\n\nInsisting that they could be a family again, Shane declared that Rex should move back into the cottage at once.  Rex told Shane that he couldn't move into the cottage until he had tricked Stacy into revealing the true donor's identity.  Rex said that Shane's help was needed to trick Stacy.  Shane listened intently as Rex explained that Shane would need to fake a relapse.  Gigi expressed concern over involving Shane in the scheme, but Shane was eager to help set a trap for Stacy.   Advising Shane that it was necessary for Rex to pretend that he was interested in Stacy, Gigi warned her son that no one could ever learn that she and Rex had reunited.  Before heading upstairs, Shane hugged his mother and told her that he loved her.\n\n\nAlone at the loft, Stacy, who was dressed in sexy lingerie, studied herself in the mirror and waited for Rex to return home.\n\n\nBack at the loft, Rex phoned Stacy and told her that he was staying overnight at Gigi's cottage because Shane wasn't feeling well.  Relating that he would sleep on the couch, Rex assured Stacy that Gigi wanted nothing to do with him.   Stacy volunteered to go over and help, but Rex convinced her to stay at the loft.  A disappointed Stacy told Rex that she would miss him.  After hanging up, Rex told Gigi that he couldn't go back to the loft and face Stacy.  \n\n\nGigi asked Rex to continue what he was saying before Shane had interrupted their conversation.  Rex told Gigi that Stacy had attempted to seduce him, but he lied and assured her that he had resisted her advances.  Gigi let out a sigh of relief.  Shane returned downstairs with a pint of ice cream, and the Balsom clan enjoyed their night together as a family.\n\n\nAt the loft, a lonely Stacy poured herself a glass of wine and pondered the situation.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Although everybody at Dorian's party attempts to convince Mr. Rivera that he needs to accept Markko's decisions to be with Langston, he does not listen. And he tells his son that he cannot live under his roof if he continues to see her or her family. At that point, Markko assesses that he is homeless. But Viki tells him that she will let him stay with her and Charlie at Llanfair. Cristian is suspicious about Fish. He runs into Kyle Lewis who reveals that he knows some \"secrets\" about Fish.

Roxy is worried about the nurse finding her, knowing her secret and taking the stem cells from her. Privately that nurse is keeping the \"donor\" with her, ready to nurse him back to health and have him meet his family. And she reveals that he asked her to let Stacy have the bag of blood with the stem cells to hold over Roxy and blackmail her.",
