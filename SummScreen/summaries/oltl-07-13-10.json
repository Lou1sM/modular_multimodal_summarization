    "soap_central": "\n\nAlmost everyone in Llanview appeared to be reading the morning edition of the Sun whose headlines screamed \"Hannah Bananas.\" In smaller print it declared \"Killer Co-Ed Claims Crazy,\" and Jessica Buchanan was the writer.\n\n\nBrody had his newspaper open to the cover story as he waited in John's office at the police station. \"So, your girlfriend's intent on making a name for herself,\" John pronounced as he stormed into his office. Uncomfortably, Brody maintained that he hadn't shared any privileged information with Jessica, and John admitted that he was only teasing. He knew that Brody wouldn't reveal department secrets. Brody asked his boss if the case was \"open and shut,\" but John revealed his suspicions.\n\n\nHe found it curious that Hannah had denied involvement in the cases all along and had even offered to identify Marty's assailant provided she received immunity. She had been alone with Eli for minutes and suddenly, she had a \"meltdown\" and had pleaded guilty to the assaults of both Marty and Ford. It didn't make sense, and there were two people who knew why. One was \"crazy Hannah,\" and the other was her lawyer, John concluded.\n\n\nAt Angel Square Park, Eli spoke to Blair on the phone and informed her that he wanted her answer to his proposal but he had to clean up a \"mess\" first. He hung up because he spotted Ford, who read about Hannah in the paper and then made a quick phone call himself.  Eli wandered over to speak to him. Eli noted that James had been shot, and he thought it was lucky for Ford's brother to be safe. He thought that hospitals could be dangerous, Eli threatened Ford as he handed over a business card. He thought that James might need legal help \"when or if\" he departed the hospital.\n\n\nFord ordered Eli to leave him and his family alone, but Eli advised Ford that Ford could count on Eli. Eli wanted to count on Ford as well. Ford was taken aback and asked how he could possibly trust Eli after Eli had attempted to kill him and Marty. Eli waved the newspaper in Ford's face and reminded him that Hannah had confessed to the crimes. Ford was aware that was true but was also conscious of the fact that she really hadn't attacked Ford. He wondered how Eli had persuaded Hannah to confess to both acts of violence.\n\n\nEli felt that Ford had a \"vivid imagination\" and quickly grew irritated as Ford continued to ask questions. He reminded Ford that knowing too much almost got Ford killed previously. \"Forget it,\" Ford retorted. Eli thought that Ford might need another lesson, or maybe James could learn the lesson instead, Eli threatened again. Ford again told Eli to \"forget it\" and Eli verified that they were \"good\" and would never have to speak again. The only reason would be if James needed legal advice. He tucked his card into Ford's pocket. Eli received a call from John, who asked him to show up at the station to talk about Hannah.\n\n\nBlair found Langston reading the article about Hannah as Langston sat by the pool at La Boulaie. They discussed Hannah, though Blair mentioned that she thought that Ford had gotten what he deserved. She looked at Langston for agreement, and Langston gave it reluctantly. Blair disclosed that she had heard about Langston's pushing Ford into the pool at the country club, and she was happy to hear that Langston didn't \"buy the BS that Ford was feeding\" Blair.\n\n\nLangston didn't understand what Blair was referring to, and Blair admitted she had visited Ford when he was in the hospital. Langston, claiming that she wanted to know where she stood if she ran into him, wanted to be aware of what Ford said. Blair revealed that Ford implied that he had real feelings for Langston, but she doubted it. Langston believed that Ford had seemed different when she saw him and that maybe he had changed. Blair didn't think so, advising Langston that he hit on Blair when she visited with him. \"Bad guys never change...but neither do the good ones,\" Blair recited.\n\n\nLangston revealed that Markko wouldn't speak to her, and Blair strongly advised her not to make a play for Ford. He was \"toxic,\" Blair insisted. She felt that Langston could just wait for a nice guy. Langston had been under the impression that they only happened once in a lifetime, but Blair assured her she was wrong. Otherwise, she wouldn't have met Eli, Blair confided. She told Langston about Eli's marriage proposal. \"Good guys come to those who wait,\" Blair couldn't help adding.\n\n\nLangston asked to see the ring, but Blair confessed that she didn't have one yet. Langston agreed it probably wasn't important to Blair, but Blair informed her that she hadn't accepted the proposal yet. She admitted she had discussed Eli with Todd, who had been helpful. Langston's opinion was that Eli was great.\n\n\nAt Bo and Nora's place, David perused the newspaper and stopped on a photo that showed him pouring a drink on Dorian at the country club. Bo emerged from his bedroom, and David hastily arose to pour his father some coffee. David eagerly showed Bo the muffins he had baked and explained that he wanted to have a new tradition of a father and son breakfast. Bo, in a hurry to get to work, suddenly blurted out, \"You're gonna have to move out.\"\n\n\nDavid couldn't believe that Bo was throwing him out, but Bo insisted there wasn't enough room and that David took too much time in the bathroom. He reminded David of the hooker he and Nora had found in the apartment. David corrected his dad and stressed that Fawn and Wendy were escorts. Bo informed him that there was no distinction to Nora. He thought that David was an adult. Bo stopped and started again. David was grown and perhaps he could stay with Dorian at La Boulaie.\n\n\nBo knew David would be fine and was still willing to have the father and son breakfasts. David handed Bo a muffin as Bo departed, and Bo suggested that David not own up to baking the goodies until after people had eaten them.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\ufffd, Charlie admonished Viki for reading the Sun, but she sighed and admitted that she needed to keep an eye on her competition. Dorian arrived and taunted Viki for being joyful at seeing her photo in the newspaper. Dorian began her usual jabs at Viki regarding Viki's hiring of David, and Viki reluctantly fought back. Dorian suggested that David was only good for \"disrobing and disappointment,\" and she headed to the back to see Markko. \"Does she ever, ever let up? Ever?\" Viki groaned. Charlie thought it was a good time for them to initiate their plan. He saw it as their only hope and way out. He would have to sleep with Dorian.\n\n\nCharlie made it clear that he wouldn't really sleep with Dorian but would make her think that she wanted to sleep with him. Viki agreed that would make Dorian realize she wanted David. Charlie stressed that the only reason Dorian wanted to sleep with Charlie was because she knew he would never respond to her advances. It was easier to want Charlie than to take another chance with David. He was sure she would back off if he made a play for her. Viki hoped that Charlie was right.\n\n\nViki thought the plan sounded more like something that Dorian would think up. She also thought the plan would be even more successful if she had the chance to work on David and maybe sleep with him. Charlie choked on his coffee.\n\n\nIn the back of the caf\ufffd, Dorian used her office as mayor as her excuse to be in the kitchen as she encountered Markko reading the newspaper about Hannah. She hoped that Markko's mother had second thoughts about slapping Dorian, but she wanted Markko to give Langston a second chance. Markko felt like a \"chump.\" Dorian assured him he wasn't but would be if he didn't see Langston.\n\n\nMarkko was angry when he learned that it was Dorian's idea to get them back together and not Langston's. He advised Dorian that all of the Kramer women lied about their feelings, mostly to themselves, and it was too late after they figured them out. He thought that Dorian and David were the worst example. Dorian took exception to Markko's statement and insisted that she and David were just a \"bad habit.\" She emphasized that Langston had made a mistake. Markko retorted that the mistake had occurred \"over and over\" and Langston was still \"drooling\" over Ford.\n\n\nMarkko insisted there was \"no going back\" but Dorian suggested he move forward and try something new. She thought he should find out if there was something in his relationship with Langston worth saving, and she thought he should talk to Langston. He wondered why Dorian hadn't gone to Langston with the suggestion, and Dorian confessed that not everyone considered her a master of relationships.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica read her article in the paper as Natalie walked into the kitchen. \"Wow, you sure have a thing for that Ford guy, don't you?\" Natalie asked her sister. \"How many articles have you written about him?\" she continued. Jessica denied Natalie's accusation and pointed out that Ford was a part of the \"big story.\" She agreed that the title didn't please her and was Todd's idea. Natalie couldn't believe that Jessica was working for Todd, but Jessica turned things around and voiced her own dismay at Natalie working at the station so closely with John again.\n\n\nNatalie was sure that she and John had grown and she knew not to let her personal relationships interfere with work. She thought that Brody and Jessica should learn the same since they would probably be involved in the same cases through their jobs. Jessica thought it was no big deal and they could be entitled to their work secrets. Natalie flashed back to Brody mentioning that his night with Natalie should be a secret. Natalie was startled back to the present when Jessica wondered what other kind of secrets she and Brody could possibly have from each other. Before Natalie could reply, David, bearing muffins, walked into the kitchen and asked to see Viki.\n\n\nHe wanted to make breakfast in bed for Viki, David announced, as he began whipping up some eggs. The young women informed him that Viki was long gone and he could find her at the caf\ufffd. David shared that he was the new style editor at the Banner and that Viki had given him the south wing of Llanfair to live in. Both Jessica and Natalie shrieked in horror. He left them some muffins before he headed to the caf\ufffd. He claimed that Noelle had baked them. Natalie was thankful that David hadn't prepared them himself.\n\n\nAs Natalie and Jessica chowed down on the muffins, suddenly, something was wrong. They both felt ill and they each managed to claim a different bathroom before running off to be sick. During a momentary break, Jessica wondered if they were sick from the muffins and if David was trying to poison them. They had a brief respite and they were sick again.\n\n\nEli showed up at the police station and sat in John's office with John and Brody. He complained that he hadn't heard anything about Hannah since she had been taken to St. Anne's. John justified that it was because she was being fully checked out. Eli didn't want to \"compromise\" his case, but John wanted an explanation for what had happened when Eli met with Hannah.\n\n\nEli explained that he had told Hannah that the truth was the best choice for her to make, and suddenly she just \"freaked out.\" John didn't think that Hannah had shown any signs of being unstable, but Eli noted that he hadn't known Hannah previously. John looked over at Brody and stated that it was just his opinion. Eli left to meet with Blair, and Bo walked in and looked at his men. He realized he had missed something. He filled the men in on his honeymoon at their request, but he inquired why Eli had been there.\n\n\nJohn advised him that Eli was representing Hannah, and Marty was observing her at St. Anne's. Brody explained they were waiting for word on Hannah's examination. Bo sensed that John had his own judgment on things, and John agreed that he thought Hannah was faking her breakdown. He believed that Eli had put her up to it. \n\n\nJohn told a confused Bo that Hannah had been fine when she was arrested. She had made demands and was familiar with immunity. Things changed after her lawyer showed up. Bo wondered if it was to avoid a jail sentence. He advised his men to keep everything secret because John was making serious accusations. They had to watch what they did because they didn't want \"some shark making waves.\"\n\n\nViki exclaimed that David was in denial like Dorian, and he flirted non-stop with Viki. He knew Viki would never fall for his act. Just then, David arrived with his muffins, which Viki thought odd to carry into a restaurant. She enlightened him that his title was reporter, not editor, when he suggested they talk about the job. David thought he should move into Llanfair, and Viki realized he had been thrown out of Bo and Nora's place. David claimed it was because Nora couldn't keep her eyes off of David. Dorian was finished with Markko and walked out into the restaurant. She advised David that he couldn't live at La Boulaie. Viki acknowledged that David would live at her house.\n\n\nDavid considered Viki a \"true friend and humanitarian\" and thought that Dorian should follow suit. Charlie acted as though he were annoyed as Dorian chose to make jabs at Viki again. She pointed out to Charlie that Viki had called Llanfair \"my house, not our house.\" Charlie suggested that he and Dorian leave to work at La Boulaie while Viki planned to work with David at Llanfair. Viki winked and handed David her car keys. She gushed that he could pick out his bedroom. Charlie appeared ill as Viki played her role. \"Here goes nothing,\" he muttered to Viki.\n\n\nLangston ran into Ford at Angel Square Park.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "David is trying to win Bo over but Bo tells him he has to find another place to live. He then goes and charms Viki and Dorian is provoked. Viki then invites David to stay at her home which further infuriates Dorian. John and Brody are suspicious of Hannah's most recent confession that she tried to kill Ford and pushed Marty and her appearing to have a mental breakdown right after talking alone with Eli, and knowing she previously had a different story and appeared completely different beforehand. They suspect Eli. But Blair has no suspicions and is ready to accept his marriage proposal.",
