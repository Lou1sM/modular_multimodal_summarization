As everyone gathered around the table, T\u00e9a stood outside and watched the Mannings bond.  T\u00e9a could only take a few minutes of it before she burst through the kitchen door.\n\n\nT\u00e9a explained that she needed Todd to sign some hospital forms, so that she could go to physical therapy.  To Blair's annoyance, Todd offered to drive T\u00e9a to her first session.  Blair reminded Todd that he had promised to teach Sam how to swim.  T\u00e9a assured Todd that she didn't need him to accompany her to physical therapy.  Blair urged Todd to help his sons change into their bathing suits.  T\u00e9a staked her claim on Todd by giving him a lingering kiss.  Blair cringed as she watched them.\n\n\nAs soon as Todd left the kitchen, Blair set some ground rules for T\u00e9a.  Blair didn't want T\u00e9a showing up at La Boulaie unannounced or to engage in inappropriate behavior in front of the children.  T\u00e9a agreed to Blair's demands, but suggested that Blair's main concern was not for the children.  T\u00e9a accused Blair of being jealous.  When Todd returned to the kitchen, T\u00e9a decided to leave.  Before T\u00e9a walked out, she announced that Blair's annulment had been added to the court docket.  T\u00e9a offered to represent Blair in court, but Blair wasn't interested.\n\n\nBlair told Todd the same thing that she had told T\u00e9a: keep his affair with T\u00e9a out of La Boulaie.  Todd growled that he had limits and told Blair not to push him.  Blair didn't heed Todd's warning.  A short time later, Blair met Todd and the boys by the pool.  Chad Driscoll, a handsome young lifeguard, accompanied her.  Blair insisted that she had hired Chad to properly teach Sam how to swim.\n\n\nTodd's resentment toward Chad grew as Blair flirted with the young hunk during Sam's lesson.  After the children left the pool area, Chad asked Blair if she was married to Todd.  Blair made it clear that she was unattached and interested in Chad.  As Blair led Chad into the house, she turned to Todd.  Blair boldly told Todd that three was a crowd, and suggested that Todd find something-away from La Boulaie-to occupy himself.\n\n\nIn Brody's room, Jessica awoke from a nightmare.  Jessica confided that she had dreamed of Chloe crying while Jessica had been unable to reach her daughter.  Brody held Jessica until a knock on the door interrupted them.  It was Gigi.  Gigi explained that she wanted to talk to Brody about Shane.\n\n\nGigi told Brody and Jessica that Rex had learned the truth about Stacy.  Gigi went on to reveal the details of Rex's plan to get their hands on the cache of blood that Stacy had hidden away.  Gigi didn't want Brody to worry about Shane when they put their plan into motion.\n\n\nAfter Gigi departed, Brody told Jessica that he had received a letter from the police academy.  Brody feared that he had been rejected because of his past transgressions.  Jessica was more optimistic than Brody. She urged him to open the letter.  To Brody's delight, he discovered that he had been accepted into the police academy.  Brody asked Jessica if she had anything to do with it.  Jessica promised that she had not pulled any strings with her Uncle Bo.  Relieved, Brody celebrated his good fortune.\n\n\nJessica confessed that it was time that she moved forward, as well.  Brody worried that Jessica intended to end their relationship, but Jessica quickly eased his concerns.  She explained that she needed to face Starr and Cole.  Brody sensed that Jessica was apprehensive about Starr and Cole's reaction to the encounter.  Jessica admitted that she was terrified that Starr and Cole would not forgive her.\n\n\nIn John's office, John handed a bugged cell phone to Cole and explained that he should never use it to contact John.  John didn't want to risk Cole's cover being blown because someone had checked the phone's call log.  Moments later, Rachel was shown into John's office.  Rachel was livid because she had been dragged to the police station without an explanation.\n\n\nJohn apologized for the secrecy before he revealed that Cole was going undercover to bust a drug ring.  Rachel was stunned.  She worried that Cole was in over his head.  Cole assured Rachel that he preferred to work undercover rather than serve his sentence out in jail.  Rachel fretted about Asher's reaction; she reminded Cole that Asher had set him up.  Cole was certain that he could regain Asher's trust.  Rachel continued to have doubts because of the temptation that Cole would face.  Cole assured Rachel that he would not turn to drugs.\n\n\nDespite her misgivings, Rachel eventually agreed to help Cole in any way that she could.  After Rachel left, Cole told John that he intended to tell Starr about his undercover work.  Cole refused to allow anything to hurt his relationship with Starr again.  John wasn't thrilled with the idea, but he realized that he had little choice in the matter.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Cole told Starr that John had arranged for Cole to go undercover.  Starr was anxious about the danger that Cole would face.  Cole promised Starr that everything would work out and vowed to remain drug-free.  Cole held his teething daughter for a few minutes.  As he prepared to leave, Cole opened the door, only to discover that Jessica blocked his way.\n\n\nJohn went to Marty's apartment.  Marty had been in the middle of studying for tests, so that her medical license could be reinstated.  John apologized for the interruption.  He explained that, because of Cole, he had realized that he didn't want to miss his chance with Marty.  Marty was moved by the admission and kissed John.\n\n\nSchuyler had a vivid dream of Gigi confessing that she had learned the truth about Rex and Stacy.  In the dream, Gigi had turned to Schuyler for comfort.  As they kissed, Schuyler was jolted awake.\n\n\nA short time later, Gigi knocked on Schuyler's door.  Gigi warned Schuyler that she and Rex were about to spring a trap on Stacy.  Gigi wanted Schuyler to be prepared in case Stacy went to him with questions.  Schuyler thanked Gigi for the heads-up and promised to do what he could to help Gigi.  As Gigi prepared to leave, Schuyler asked her about her relationship with Rex.  Gigi told him that Stacy had claimed to have slept with Rex.  Schuyler assumed that Gigi had forgiven Rex for the indiscretion.\n\n\nGigi clarified that there had been nothing for her to forgive because she had not believed Stacy's lie.  Schuyler seemed startled that Gigi remained in the dark about Rex and Stacy.  After Gigi left, Schuyler went to the community center, where he bumped into Rachel.  Schuyler shared the latest developments in the saga of Gigi's relationship with Rex. Rachel asked Schuyler what he planned to do about Rex's lie.  Schuyler confided that he had decided to keep the truth to himself.  Schuyler wanted to focus on being a supportive friend to Gigi.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Rex and Shane were playing indoor football when Stacy let herself in.  Stacy commented that it had appeared that Shane had recovered from his illness.  Shane pretended to feel under the weather while Rex told Stacy that he had given Shane some medicine to combat the fever.  Stacy was surprised when Rex went on to reveal that Gigi had gone on some errands.\n\n\nDetermined to be of help, Stacy produced a digital thermometer to take Shane's temperature.  Stacy claimed that Gigi was too cheap to spring for the top-of-the-line medical device, so Stacy had taken it upon herself to buy it for Shane.  Stacy stuck the thermometer into Shane's mouth and quickly discovered that his temperature was normal.  Shane faked a bout of nausea and ran upstairs. Rex followed his son.\n\n\nWhen Rex returned to the living room, Stacy insisted on taking Shane to see a doctor.  When Stacy questioned Rex's reluctance, Rex was forced to comply with Stacy's demand.  As Rex, Shane, and Stacy prepared to leave, Gigi walked in.  Michael McBain was with Gigi. \n\n\n",
