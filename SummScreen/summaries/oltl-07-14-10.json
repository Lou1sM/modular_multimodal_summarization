    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, Markko toiled in the kitchen and his mind raced as he remembered his arguments with Langston, and her begging for forgiveness.\n\n\nIn the park, Langston accused Ford of stalking her.  \"I was here first,\"\ufffd Ford replied, but Langston reminded him that she always headed there to work on her writing.  Langston said she'd leave, but Ford told her she didn't have to.  Langston explained that she couldn't take being around him, and was infuriated by what he'd told Blair about her.  Ford said he hadn't been insulting her, and had meant what he said about being unable to get her out of his mind.\n\n\nLangston was positive that Ford was still jerking her around, and said that there was nothing he could tell her that would change her mind about him.  \"How about, 'I miss you?'\" Ford asked, stepping closer to her.  Langston was struck by his words, but told him she was sick of his doubletalk -- first he said he loved her, then he claimed not to care.  As she moved to leave, Ford grabbed her and pleaded for a chance to be friends; he had no one else. He needed her, and a second chance to fix things between them.  Langston asked him to let her go, but Ford cried, \"I can't!\"\n\n\nJust then, Markko rushed into the park, and ordered Ford to take his hands off Langston.  \"Is that what you want?\" Ford asked her.  After a moment's hesitation, Langston told him yes -- it didn't matter what he'd said to her, all she wanted was for him to leave her alone.  Stepping back, Ford told Markko that Langston was all his, then snidely reconsidered: \"Oh, guess not!\"\n\n\nAfter Ford stormed off, Langston asked Markko what he was doing there.  He said he was looking for her, which surprised his ex. Langston thought he never wanted to see her again, but Markko admitted that it was a hard pledge to stick to.  He told her about his confrontation with Dorian, and how Dorian had pressured him to give her another chance.  Langston apologized for Dorian's behavior, and said she knew Markko could never forgive her, or take her back.\n\n\nMarkko asked her if she wanted them to find their way back to each other.  Langston wondered what it would mean if she did.  Markko was suspicious of her recent encounters with Ford, but Langston insisted that she and Ford were \"completely over\" --  thinking of him made her sick.  \"I'm such an idiot,\" she said tearfully, \"and you deserve so much better.\"\n\n\nLangston told Markko she missed him a lot, every single day, and that she still cared for him -- she'd meant what she'd said in her graduation address, about fixing her mess and making up for her mistakes.  Markko's temper flared as he told Langston he didn't want to be her \"chore,\" but Langston said he was much more than that.  Markko reflected on how Dorian had told him he wouldn't have gone to graduation if he hadn't still cared about Langston, and added that she was right.\n\n\n\"So we still care,\" Langston said softly. \"That's something.\" \"Yeah, it is,\" Markko agreed.  As the exes drew close together, Langston asked if it meant a chance for them again.  Consumed by their turbulent emotions, they kissed.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Elijah met Blair by the pool and apologized for keeping her waiting.  He revealed that his new client was Hannah O'Connor, and said that Hannah had requested him personally.  Blair shrugged it off, and told him they had more important matters to discuss, namely his proposal, which she'd thought about long and hard.  \"Ask me again,\" she requested.\n\n\nElijah promptly got down on one knee.  \"Blair Cramer,\" he asked, \"will you marry me?\" Blair enthusiastically answered yes.  As Elijah took her in his arms and kissed her, he told her she'd made him the happiest man alive.  He apologized for not having gotten her a ring first, but Blair said she'd simply help him pick one out.  \"All part of my master plan,\" Elijah joked.\n\n\nAs the newly betrothed couple hashed out their wedding plans, Jack's arrival interrupted them. Jack asked what all the commotion was about.  Elijah revealed that he was marrying the boy's mother.  Stunned, Jack turned to Blair: \"Shut up.\" Blair sat down beside Jack and apologized for telling him so suddenly, while Elijah turned on the charm and asked Jack how he felt about having a stepfather.\n\n\nJack seemed blas\ufffd, and said he could roll with it; after carefully examining Elijah's tie, he told Blair that if she was happy, he was happy.  Elijah was thrilled by Jack's apparent seal of approval, and told Blair he'd return after checking on Hannah at St. Anne's.  He bid goodbye to Jack, and called him \"little buddy,\" which led Jack to flash him a big fake grin.  As soon as Elijah left, however, Jack turned on his mother. \"Okay, first, he needs to lose the 'little buddy' act if he wants to live until sundown,\" Jack began. \"Second of all, you seriously can't marry that clown.\"\n\n\nBlair was stunned by Jack's sudden reversal, but Jack was adamant that she couldn't marry Elijah.  \"He's a big phony!\" the boy cried. \"You can do a lot better.\" Blair reminded him that he'd said the same about John, and concluded that he didn't want her with anyone but his father.  \"Did I say that he's good enough?\" Jack replied.  He told his mother that a family reunion was her fantasy, and to leave him out of it.\n\n\nThe Manning-Delgado clan arrived at the courthouse for Todd's hearing, with both Todd and Danielle worrying over T\ufffda, who had just undergone more radiation treatments.  T\ufffda said she had her power pumps on and was there to close Todd's case, and ordered her loved ones out of her way as she stepped into the courtroom.  As they entered the chamber, Danielle apologized to Todd for believing he could kill Marty's baby, while T\ufffda fended off Nora's curiosity about her late arrival by claiming they'd had a family breakfast together.\n\n\nAs the judge entered the courtroom, Todd leaned over to Danielle in the gallery and told her to watch her mother at work. After the charges against Todd were read for the record, T\ufffda rose and requested that they be dropped in light of Hannah's confession.  Nora claimed that doctors at St. Anne's were still evaluating Hanna's breakdown, but T\ufffda told the court that the entire case against Todd was based on false testimony given by the girl. Without Hannah, they had nothing and were required to drop all charges.\n\n\n\"She's awesome,\" Danielle whispered to Todd as she watched T\ufffda in action.  Nora relented and agreed to drop the charges against Todd, which led the judge to throw out the case and left Todd a free man once again.  As the court adjourned, Nora warned T\ufffda that the next time they faced off over Todd, she wouldn't have it so easy.\n\n\nAfter the courtroom cleared, Todd and Danielle congratulated T\ufffda on her great work.  Danielle wanted to wait for her, but T\ufffda said she had paperwork to finish, and suggested Danielle take advantage of the summer afternoon.  After hearing that Todd would stay with T\ufffda, Danielle agreed to leave, and held out her hand for Todd to shake.  \"Congratulations,\" she told him, and left.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, James was roused from a pleasant dream about his kiss with Starr.  A passing nurse introduced the young man standing at the foot of his bed: Nate Salinger, who explained that he was the one responsible for James ending up in the hospital.  \"You look different without duct tape on your mouth,\" James noted, and realized that Nate was the one who'd taken his stolen money.  Nate apologized, and said he'd given it to a good cause; he hadn't known his actions would put anyone in danger.  As he apologized again, Ford entered, and immediately sized up the situation: \"This is the punk who got you shot!\"\n\n\nFord began to rail at Nate for endangering his brother and taking the cash, but James told him to ease up. James believed Nate hadn't wanted to hurt anyone, and Ford was acting like the one who'd lost something precious.  Disgusted with the boy, Ford ordered Nate to get out.\n\n\nIn the hospital corridor, Danielle arrived just in time to witness Nate's banishment from James's room.  She explained that she wanted to visit James and check on him, but Nate suggested she wait on her well wishes. \n\n\nInside James's room, the Ford brothers argued over Nate.  James was sympathetic and considered Nate an innocent bystander, but Ford remained angry.  He said James had deserved the money he'd stolen from their father -- he'd taken care of himself first in the world, which was what he'd had to do, and he should never apologize for it.  Listening to his brother's tirade, James concluded that the discussion wasn't about him or Nate at all.  \"Bobby, what happened to you?\" he asked.\n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Marty oversaw Hannah's psychiatric evaluation.  She explained that she was there so Hannah could get well, and asked the coed why she'd confessed to so many crimes.  Flashing back to her conversation with Elijah, and his threats against Cole, Hannah murmured, \"I do what I'm told.\" Marty asked her who'd told her what to do.  \"He doesn't have a name,\" Hannah said, pretending that Elijah was a voice in her mind; he was bossy, and she had to do what he said, or else.\n\n\nMarty asked Hannah if she'd heard other voices, and Hannah said that some were sweet, and others were angry, and claimed she'd been hearing them since she went away to school.  Baffled, Marty asked if there was anything else Hannah wanted to say.  \"I did it all for Cole,\" Hannah said evenly. \"Please tell him.\"\n\n\nAs Marty exited to the corridor, she ran into Nora, who told her they'd dropped the case against Todd, which had left the legal eagle eager to ascertain whether Hannah's breakdown was legitimate, or if the Commonwealth would be able to prosecute.  Marty said she didn't know for sure, and they agreed that Hannah's mental instability seemed very sudden and convenient.  Before they could talk further, Elijah arrived, eager to speak with his client, and asked if Hannah's evaluation was finished.  Marty told him she needed to speak to Dr. Levin before going further, and headed down the corridor.\n\n\nNora stopped Elijah from entering Hannah's room, and reminded him that the doctors' analysis was ongoing, and they still had more questions.  Elijah asked Nora if Hannah had changed her story at all since being admitted.  Taking her silence as a negative, he entered the girl's room.\n\n\nInside Hannah's room, Elijah greeted his client.  Hannah told him she'd used everything she remembered from her psych classes to fool the doctors, and Elijah told her she'd done a good job.  Hannah asked what would happen next, and Elijah said she'd avoid a trial, be treated for several months, then pronounced \"cured\" and set free, and that would be that.  Hannah asked him if that was the only way, and Elijah warned her that the alternative was a prison sentence, and mortal danger for Cole.  Hannah said she'd play along, if it meant Cole would be safe.\n\n\nHannah asked what would happen once she was freed.  \"Then it's over,\" Elijah said, but Hannah didn't believe it.  She was a loose end for him, she knew he'd assaulted two people and killed an unborn child. She wondered how he could let her live.  \"\ufffdWhy not?\" Elijah asked, and reminded Hannah that she had a history of mental illness, and no one would believe her if she chose to turn on him.  As long as she kept her mouth shut, she'd be free, she'd keep breathing, and Cole would keep breathing.\n\n\nAfter bidding Hannah an inappropriately cheery goodbye, Elijah returned to the corridor, where Nora was waiting.  Nora warned him not to coach his client, but Elijah chuckled and told Nora he knew she didn't have a case.  With that, he left.\n\n\nAt their apartment, Starr and Cole enjoyed a morning together with Hope.  Cole mentioned that Hope had kept him up, but he hadn't wanted to wake Starr, who'd seemed to be having a wonderful dream.\n\n\nIn Markko's old room, Cole discovered one of Hope's stuffed animals ripped apart.  He concluded that Bull had damaged it when he ransacked the place, but Starr begged to differ, and wondered if Hannah had done it instead.  Soon, Starr and Cole were bickering over Hannah again; Cole insisted that Hannah wasn't capable of extreme violence, but Starr said that Hannah had trashed their lives.  Stalemated, they resolved to drop the subject, and Cole put Hope to bed.\n\n\nWhile Cole was out of the room, Starr called the hospital to check on James, only to be denied information because she wasn't family, \"just a friend.\" When Cole returned, Starr explained the call, but Cole didn't understand why she cared about James's well-being at all.  Starr reminded Cole that she'd shot James, and said that inquiring about his health was the least she could do.  Fuming, Cole told Starr that if not for James, she'd never have been in danger in the first place.  On the verge of losing his temper, he told Starr that they needed to avoid the subject of James as well.\n\n\nStarr was infuriated by Cole's denial of their problems.  She told him they could buy time by talking about everyday chores, but the reality was that they were struggling with what other people had done to their relationship, and the real issues stemming from their time away from Llanview.  Cole apologized to her for believing Hannah's lies about her and Todd, and admitted he owed Todd an apology.  Starr added that nothing had happened between her and James, and Cole concluded that there was nothing left for them to discuss.  After a moment, however, he flew into a rage, and told Starr that he was wrestling with the fact that she hadn't gone to him when she'd gotten into trouble.\n\n\nStarr reminded Cole of how he'd told her not to visit him in jail, and Cole agreed, insisting that it was all his fault; he'd lost control, then driven her away, and he hadn't been there for her when she'd needed him.  Starr comforted him, and told him she had hardly been able to wait for him to get out of jail.  \"You're the only guy I want,\" she said, but Cole said he had to earn her love again.  Starr disagreed; she loved him, and that had never changed.  \"I love you too,\" Cole said, and embraced her.\n\n\nA  phone call from Marty interrupted the young lovers. Cole asked Marty if she could take Hope for the day, as he wanted to spend private time with Starr, but Marty said it was impossible, as she was calling to inform him of Hannah's confession and subsequent breakdown.  Cole was stunned to hear that Hannah was taking responsibility for two violent crimes, and asked his mother if she thought Hannah was telling the truth.  Marty didn't know, but said she'd wanted to warn him of the latest news.\n\n\nAfter Cole hung up, he explained the situation to Starr; Hannah had confessed, and the charges against Todd had been dropped.  Starr was thrilled to hear that her father was free, but Cole was still reeling from the news about Hannah.  He reflected on how Hannah had sworn she was innocent of those crimes, and told Starr she wouldn't like it, but he had to go see the girl.  Starr agreed, and told him to do whatever it took to get the truth from Hannah, as she didn't want to see her nemesis skate on an insanity plea.\n\n\nStarr and Cole kissed, and Cole asked if they were okay. \"We're okay,\" Starr replied. She walked him out of the apartment -- and warned him to be careful.  As Cole left, Starr picked up the latest edition of the Banner and studied the headline about James and Bull.  Thinking fast, Starr called Addie, and asked if she could watch Hope for a little while.\n\n\nBack at St Anne's, Marty returned to Nora's side outside Hannah's room.  She told Nora that Dr. Levin believed Hannah's schizophrenia was real, but she remained skeptical.  Nora asked if Hannah was faking, but Marty feared she was too close to the case to be sure.  Nora asked what they could do, and Marty said that Hannah wouldn't be able to keep up an act if the right person pressured her and got through to her.\n\n\nCole arrived and told Nora and Marty he shared their suspicions. He recalled how Hannah had insisted she hadn't pushed Marty or attacked Ford.  Nora believed Hannah would tell Cole the truth, and Cole asked his mother to let him talk to his wayward classmate.  After laying down ground rules, Marty agreed, and Cole knocked on Hannah's door.  Hannah was shocked to see him: \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\nAs Cole entered Hannah's room, he told her he'd heard about her confession, and he'd had to see her.  \"You really care?\" Hannah asked.  Cole said he did, but he needed to know the truth.  They were alone, and he wanted her to be honest with him: \"Did you do it?\"\n\n\nBack at the courthouse, Todd and T\ufffda exulted in their victory, both in the case and in Danielle's congratulations to Todd.  Todd dismissively told her she'd done a nice job.  \"I'm keeping your bail money,\" T\ufffda grumbled.\n\n\nTodd told T\ufffda he had other news for her, and revealed that Elijah had proposed to Blair.  He said he was pleased someone was taking Blair off his hands, and T\ufffda chided him for speaking so cavalierly about the love of his life; Todd countered that he was merely talking about Blair.  \"What about you?\" he asked, and T\ufffda said that after the previous few months of female bonding, she wished Blair happiness.  Todd told her she'd misunderstood his question, and decided to put it a different way: \"Will you marry me?\" \n\n\n",
