Baz continued that he'd heard Todd say that he'd kept Tomas out of jail, and that Tomas had kept Todd alive. He thought that the men were keeping some kind of secret deal from everyone. Starr thought that Baz had taken the comments out of context, but Baz refused to believe it. Starr mentioned the encrypted files on Todd and Tomas, but then remembered Sam's birthday party. Baz agreed to tag along in order to figure out what was going on between Todd and Tomas.\n\n\nJohn looked at Agent Kent's file as Blair walked in with Sam. Blair informed John that she thought Sam might know something about the body that had been found at La Boulaie. She explained about the sudden appearance of an imaginary friend. She sat Sam down in front of John's desk, and asked the boy to tell John about his new imaginary friend. However, Sam didn't want to talk to \"McPain.\" Sam didn't want to miss his party, but Blair assured him that it wouldn't start until he arrived.\n\n\nJohn promised Sam that he could get to the party after he answered a few questions about his new friend. Sam said he couldn't, because he'd made a promise to his friend not to tell anyone about him. John related that he dealt with secret cases every day, including one involving Santa. Sam was curious about the case, but John said that he could only talk about it with other policemen. He suggested making Sam an honorary deputy so they could talk about the case, but added that it would mean that they couldn't have any secrets.\n\n\nJohn made Sam an honorary deputy, and Sam immediately asked about Santa's case. John picked up an ad for a department store that mentioned \"Christmas in July.\" He explained that, since Christmas was in December, he and Santa believed that there was a Grinch trying to ruin the holiday. He asked Sam to keep an eye out, and he agreed. He wondered if Sam's friend could do the same, and asked the friend's name. Sam didn't know, so John suggested that the mysterious man was a mutual friend.\n\n\nJohn showed Sam a picture of Agent Kent. Sam recognized him as \"the bad man\" who'd tried to shoot Sam at the pool. Sam continued that his friend had saved him. Pulling John aside, Blair was distressed that her son claimed to have almost been shot. She remembered that Sam had mentioned that his friend had \"a line on his face.\" Neither believed that Sam's imaginary friend could have Todd's old face.\n\n\nJohn decided to show Sam an old picture of Todd. Sam confirmed that the man in the picture was the man who'd saved him. Blair wondered if Sam had seen Todd kill someone, and was trying to cover it up. John would believe it, but didn't think it was true. John assured Blair that the man seemed to have wanted to protect Sam. He let Sam and Blair go to the party. Frustrated, he tossed Agent Kent's file onto his desk.\n\n\nTomas told T\u00e9a that he had something to tell her about Todd. T\u00e9a agreed to listen, so Tomas said that he'd talked to Todd about Todd's bad behavior. Tomas stated that Todd wanted to apologize to T\u00e9a, and take responsibility for his actions. She accused Tomas of talking to the \"wrong Todd.\" She didn't want a \"coerced apology,\" but Todd surprised her and apologized for acting like a jerk. She thanked Tomas for helping Todd to see the light.\n\n\nT\u00e9a tried to kick the two out of the room so she could get ready, and decorate for Sam's party. Todd told her that Tomas had volunteered to decorate, since he was the \"artsy type.\" The two men left the room, and Todd wondered if Tomas enjoyed watching Todd \"jump through hoops.\" He reminded Tomas that he could hurt Tomas just as badly as Tomas thought he could hurt Todd. Tomas warned Todd not to threaten T\u00e9a or Dani. \"My wife, my daughter,\" Todd said, and walked away. \"My sister, my niece,\" Tomas said to himself.\n\n\nA short while later, Todd was getting ready for Sam's party. T\u00e9a emerged from the bathroom, and he told her that she looked beautiful. He wanted her to believe that he didn't take her for granted, and that he appreciated every day he had with her. He was afraid to lose her. She assured him that he didn't have to be scared, but advised him to \"try not to be such a jackass.\"\n\n\nNate told Rick that Deanna couldn't be forced to do the movie. Rick pulled out a file folder, which Deanna recognized as the file that contained all of her mother's information. She demanded to know how he had gotten it. He informed her that her lawyer was an old friend of his from college, and he owed Rick. Deanna called the two men sleazy, but Rick called it networking.\n\n\nDeanna wanted to know how much Rick wanted for the file, but Rick only wanted her \"talents.\" He warned Deanna and Nate that his offer had an expiration date. Deanna and Nate asked what it was. He answered that it was in the amount of time it would take him to finish his cigarette, and he left the room.\n\n\nNate told Deanna that he wouldn't do the movie. She related that it was \"just sex.\" He answered that he hadn't even had sex with his own girlfriend yet. He knew that doing the movie would be betraying Dani. Deanna made it simple for Nate: do Rick's movie, or go to jail. He thought Dani was more important, but Deanna suggested that Dani wouldn't have to know. Nate thought that he wouldn't be able to look Inez, Dani, or his brothers in the eyes again.\n\n\nNate would rather risk going to jail than have Dani find out that he'd done porn. Rick returned and wanted Nate and Deanna's decisions. Deanna reluctantly agreed to do one scene. Nate struggled to tell Rick that he would do it, but eventually got the words out. Rick had to set up the motel, but told them to be there in half an hour. He left, and Nate decided that he had to call Dani.\n\n\n\"I have to tell you something,\" Destiny told Dani. Dani walked out of the house and admitted that she had to talk to Destiny about Matthew. She confided that Nate knew about Matthew killing Eddie. Destiny was angry that Dani would tell Nate, but Dani insisted that Destiny had technically told Nate. Dani told a shocked Destiny that Nate had overheard their conversation in Angel Square a couple weeks before. Dani reluctantly confessed that Nate had told Deanna.\n\n\nDestiny was livid, but Dani assured Destiny that Deanna wouldn't tell anyone. Nate had only needed someone to talk to. Dani had been relieved to find out that the secret was the reason that she'd been seeing Nate and Deanna \"with their heads together.\" She'd been scared that Nate was cheating. Even if Nate decided to turn Matthew in, Dani knew that Matthew wouldn't be arrested while in his condition. Destiny believed that Matthew was going to get better, so she wondered what would happen to him then.\n\n\nDani wondered what Destiny had to talk to Dani about. Destiny remembered finding out that she was pregnant. Just then, Starr and Baz entered. Destiny apologized for interrupting a family event, and said she would talk to Dani later. Starr wondered where Nate was, and Dani was surprised that he wasn't there yet. The three entered the house, and Tomas was surprised to see Baz at a \"little kid's birthday party.\" Baz yelled that he wouldn't miss the party for the world.\n\n\nBlair entered with Sam, and there was a huge commotion around the birthday boy. Everyone except Todd and Blair left the foyer of the house to help Sam hit his pi\u00f1ata. Todd wondered what had taken Blair and Sam so long, but Blair promised to explain later. She wondered where the entertainment was.\n\n\nDestiny arrived at the diner, and looked at Vivian's teen pregnancy pamphlet.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face looked at the headline on the Sun: \"Madam Mayor a Slayer?\" He looked at the headline on the Banner: \"Corpse Found at Mayor's House -- Gunman at Large.\" He sat down at the computer and typed \"Todd Manning\" into a search engine. He wanted to find out who was posing as Todd.\n\n\nThe man looked at the results of the search as his phone began to ring. It read \"Caller ID Unavailable.\" He knew that it was the agent, who he assumed wanted to go after him. He read an old article from the Sun, with a headline that said \"Brand New Face -- Same Old Manning.\" He found a video of a Blanca Morales news report from after Todd's shooting. She had been chronicling Todd's life, and impact on Llanview.\n\n\nThe man watched as the video explained how Todd had disappeared. A man named Walker had appeared, who had eventually been unmasked as Todd. He'd had a completely new face after reconstructive surgery. However, Blanca had reported Todd's transformation had only been skin-deep. She explained about Margaret Cochran's abduction of Todd, which had resulted in the birth of Sam.\n\n\nA short while later, the man made a phone call to the Sun. He asked to speak to Todd about scheduling a meeting with Viki at the Banner. The person on the other end told him that Todd wouldn't be in the office due to Sam's birthday party. The man asked for a reminder of where the party was, because his boss would be angry if he didn't schedule the meeting. The person told him, and the man hung up. He made sure to grab his gun.\n\n\nA short while later, a man in a Spider-Man costume was on the phone outside of Todd's home. He told the person on the other end that he was a serious actor, so he wasn't happy with the birthday party job. As the man was about the knock on the door, the man with Todd's original face knocked the man out. \"So much for your Spidey sense,\" he cracked as he picked up the costume.\n\n\n",

But beforehand, John calls Blair and Sam into the station after finding out that Sam may have information about the mysterious dead body found outside Dorian's home in her backyard. Sam admits that he did not know the dead guy and that he was not his \"friend\" (whom he identified as the man with the scar on his face). He informs John that the man who got shot is a bad man who tried to kill him. But his \"friend\" saved the day and saved his life by shooting him. And when John shows Sam a picture of original Todd, Sam confirms that that is a picture of his \"friend\". Meanwhile, original Todd finds out all of the happenings in \"his life\" since he's been gone and finds out how Sam, whom he's never met nor heard of, was conceived and born. He finds a way to get to current Todd's home. He notices \"Spiderman\" outside the door, sneaks up behind him and knocks him out. Meanwhile, Destiny overhears Nate and Deanna sounding like they are going to hook up behind Dani's back. Deanna tells Nate that doing the porn flick might be worth it for them if it enables her to find her mom and keeps him out of prison for what accidentally happened to Matthew.
