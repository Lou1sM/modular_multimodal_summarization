When a towel-draped David approached, Langston forced Markko to hide in Dorian's closet and film from inside as she greeted David and turned on the forced charm. David was unnerved by Langston's vamping and shied away from her advances, and when his girlfriend got too close to Vickers, a heated Markko burst out of the closet and called a halt to the proceedings. David deduced that Langston had planned to frame him for adultery so Addie would divorce him, and admonished the young girl for her scheming while praising her Cramer loyalty. Infuriated, Langston and Markko fled, leaving David to clean up the mess Markko had made in the walk-in closet. But when David poked around in the closet, he found the drug \"Rohypnol\" in Dorian's medical bag, and began putting pieces of a puzzle together. \n\n\nAt Cramer Enterprises, Dorian chatted up her beautician while making Clint and Nora wait in the lobby outside her office. In the lobby, Nora tried to make awkward small talk, but Clint couldn't get past her public outing of Lindsay at Bo's wedding, and the humiliation it had caused his brother. Nora apologized but said that Bo had had a right to know, and that Clint still needed her help to unseat Dorian. Clint assented, and said that Addie and David's impulsive marriage was Dorian's Achilles heel. He instructed Nora to let him wind Dorian up about the \"Cramer-Vickers\" marriage while Nora ran interference by talking business. When Dorian finally admitted Clint and Nora to her office, the couple proceeded with their plan, with Clint needling Dorian endlessly about Addie and David's \"love affair,\" making Dorian increasingly furious. Nora warned Dorian that they still had the possibility of being able to take her to criminal court for her acquisition of Cobb and Webster's stocks, and Dorian dared them to try to take her to trial. She threw Clint and Nora out, but not before Clint got in even more jibes about Dorian's need to host David and Addie's wedding reception. After they'd left, Dorian made plans to head home for the night, but asked her secretary to alert her when \"he\" arrived. \n\n\nAt John's apartment, the McBain brothers were treated to some surprise guests: Blair and baby Sam. Blair told John she'd come out of her way to see him, in the midst of the craziness with Starr and Cole's custody battle. Already depressed, Michael was upset and withdrawn when faced with the child he'd lost. Blair apologized for the awkwardness, but promised to support his and Marcie's bid for Starr's baby, only to discover that Michael did not support the adoption at all. Michael told her he didn't believe Starr and Marcie's scenario would work, and felt that Todd would always be an omnipresent threat in their lives if they dared try to raise his grandchild; he said that if Marcie wanted to keep Starr's baby, she'd be raising it alone. \n\n\nMichael left John and Blair to talk amongst themselves, and Blair vented about Todd's new involvement in the pregnancy debacle. She tried to put on a brave front, but John saw through Blair's act, forcing her to confess that she was scared. Blair said that Todd wasn't going to back down anymore or change his mind as in the past, and that she felt helpless. John promised to be there for her, Starr, and Cole every step of the way. Blair tried to busy herself by helping John clean up the apartment, and came across Marty's Christmas gift: The \"Todd Manning\" dartboard. John admitted that because of his attachment to Marty, he hadn't been able to throw it away, and instead, Blair and John decided to bond over a game of darts themselves. After Blair and Sam said goodbye for the evening, John tried to assuage Michael's concerns about Starr and Marcie's plan, and assured him that things would be different \"this time.\" \n\n\nAt the courthouse, Starr, Marcie, and Judy Schulman-Brown confronted Cole, Todd, and Todd's lawyer, Morgan Guthrie. The teens remained at odds, and Todd warned Starr that Cole would not be signing over his paternal rights to his child, especially not to Marcie \"the baby thief.\" Starr excoriated Cole for siding with her father, and Cole feebly protested that the injunction was all Todd's idea. Starr blasted her boyfriend, saying he was just like Todd. Todd tried to compare Starr's urge to give her child up with his own initial feelings of hatred for Sam as Margaret's baby, a child of rape, and said that her emotional reaction would pass; Starr insisted that her mind was made up, and nothing could stop the adoption. \n\n\nThe judge arrived, and heard the lawyers' arguments for and against the adoption agreement, as well as Starr and Cole's back-and-forth bickering. The judge then ruled that any contract for closed adoption was non-binding while the baby remained in utero, and could not be entered into until the baby's birth, nor without the consent of the father. He added that any injunction by Cole or Todd to seize custody was also irrelevant until the birth, and that the only way an adoption could go through with Starr and Marcie was if, at that later date, Cole chose to sign away his parental rights. The judge concluded that thus far, neither party had any legal standing yet, and urged them all to take time to think and work things out before the child was born. With the court in recess, Starr and Cole spoke again. Starr warned Cole that with custody of their baby, Cole would also get Todd in his life permanently, and that he needed to think things through. Despite Todd's taunts that Cole would never sign away his rights, Starr told Cole she wouldn't change her mind about the adoption. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tess sat in the kitchen with her vision of Nash, telling him how much she missed him. She was interrupted by the arrival of Jared and Natalie, and immediately began to gush at them, asking them to stay and cook dinner with her so she and her sister could begin to \"re-bond.\" Jared and Natalie hesitantly agreed, and they began to work on cooking pesto risotto. Saying she needed to get more ingredients, Tess snuck away to the garage to tamper with Natalie's car brakes, using a pamphlet entitled \"Brake Tampering For Dummies.\" Her machinations were interrupted, however, by the return of her hallucination of Nash, who guilt-tripped her about her plans to murder Natalie, warning her that \"you can't come back from this.\" Tess clung to Nash, saying that Natalie and Jared took him from her and had to pay. Back in the kitchen, Jared told Natalie that \"Jessica\" was trying way too hard to make their new living arrangements work, but a happy Natalie embraced him and assured him that everything would be okay. Tess returned and began grinding her newfound \"pine nuts\" into the mixture of ingredients, saying that strangely enough, they were her favorite part of the recipe. Then, she faked hysterics, asking the lovers to go to the vineyard cottage for her and retrieve some of Nash's wine. As Natalie and Jared rushed off, Tess watched them go, waving goodbye with an evil smile on her face. \n\n\n",

Langston attempts to seduce David and has Markko videotape them in an attempt to get David in trouble with Addie. But he doesn't buy that. Jessica (as Tess) makes nice to Natalie and Jared but she secretly attempts to cut their brake lines and asks them to drive to the vineyard to get something for her. Nora and Clint have a scheme to overthrow Dorian's ownership of what was previously B.E. Passions",
