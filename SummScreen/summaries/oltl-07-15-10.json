She flirted with him shamelessly and urged him to take off his shirt. She rubbed her hands up and down his arms from shoulders to wrists and suggested he pour himself some wine in the kitchen. As soon as David left the room, Viki hurriedly placed a call to Charlie.\n\n\n\"Roger, Cupid 1, this is Cupid 2,\" Charlie answered his phone at La Boulaie. Viki was not amused and spoke quickly as she told him their plan was in motion. She wanted to know if Charlie was sure it would work because she was concerned there were too many risks involved. She was worried that Dorian and David might take Charlie and Viki up on their offers. Charlie promised Viki that he would jump out the window if that happened.\n\n\nJust then Dorian walked into the room and Charlie hurriedly changed his tone on his phone call. He demanded to know why David was living with them. He hung up the phone and turned to Dorian. He wanted to talk about all that Dorian had done for him. Dorian was flattered and thrilled to hear that she had done something good for someone. Her family took her for granted, she complained. Charlie revealed that she had changed his life, and Dorian added they could change Llanview together. She wanted to get to business, but Charlie had a confession to make.\n\n\nDorian nervously thought that Charlie had been drinking, and she promised that she wouldn't judge him because that was Viki's job. Charlie quickly assured her that wasn't it and explained that he had wanted privacy. He had run out of her house the last time he was there because he couldn't trust himself, he claimed. Viki told him that Dorian was after him, but it was really the other way around. He was the one who wanted Dorian, he told her.\n\n\nOut by the pool, Blair questioned Jack on his true feelings for Eli. Jack, not one to mince words, informed her that Eli was \"Ross Rayburn in a nicer suit.\" He admitted that he was suspicious of the lawyer. \"He doesn't smell right.\" Blair advised her son that Eli was nice, he loved her, and she wanted Jack's congratulations. Jack gave them grudgingly as Blair tried to convince him that everyone would benefit from the marriage. He demanded that Eli not call him \"little buddy\" again, or he would push his mother's fianc\ufffd into the pool.\n\n\nAt the country club, Rex questioned Destiny about his \"shiny metal case\" because he couldn't locate it and couldn't work without it. He was upset and wondered if she had seen it. Destiny looked at him curiously and assured him she hadn't. She moved on to do her work. Gigi arrived with the case in hand but she was annoyed that Rex appeared to be happier to see the case then he was to see her. Gigi announced that she was hopeful that Rex would play hooky for the day, and she had taken his case so that he wouldn't be able to work.\n\n\nRex tried to explain that they couldn't remain at the country club for another day, but she held up a flyer that had mention of the club's two-day celebration. She switched her day at work and had hoped to pay him back for the wonderful day he had given her. Rex was convinced and the pair sat out by the pool. Gigi was anxious to try one of the club's services but Rex nixed all of her suggestions. He was content to stay put and repeat their previous day together. As Gigi slathered him with suntan lotion, Rex admitted that he had forgotten how to relax. He was perturbed that he had not gotten anywhere on the Bennett Thompson case, and he was afraid that Kelly would fire him.\n\n\nGigi offered to spend the day helping Rex with his case, and Rex agreed that was the special service he wanted. He grabbed the files from the car, and Gigi looked them over. She suggested that perhaps one of the employees at the residence where Melinda lived had worked at another facility and encountered Bennett Thompson there. She thought that Rex needed to look inside his briefcase for some help, and she admitted she had put something in there.\n\n\nRex shook the briefcase and finally pulled out a framed photo of Shane at camp. His son was mid-throw during a baseball game where he played the position of pitcher. This led to a discussion about Shane's trips to see the Rangers, his growing fondness for the Phillies, and the fact that Rex and Gigi had suffered with the Tigers. Suddenly, Rex called Gigi a genius and commended Gigi for blowing the case wide open. He wasn't sure how she had achieved that, but he gathered his papers and rushed off to do some research.\n\n\nDestiny walked past Matthew, who was sitting at a table reading. She accused him of hiding since he was friends with a killer. Matthew claimed that he had no idea what Destiny was talking about, but she picked up a newspaper lying on a table nearby. She held it up so that he could see the photo of Bull. Matthew feigned ignorance, but Destiny reminded him she had seen him talking to Bull. She found it to be unbelievable when Matthew remembered that Bull was a friend of his parents, and she demanded the truth.\n\n\nMatthew recalled that Bull had been looking for something, and Matthew had information as to where the something was located. Destiny continued to pressure Matthew until he disclosed that the something was $50,000 that Nate had taken. He had difficulty peering into Destiny's eyes but acknowledged he had been stupid. \"No harm, no foul,\" he said. Destiny couldn't believe her ears, but Matthew reminded her that everyone had been safe. He had learned the term from David, who was full of good advice, he added. He showed Destiny the manuscript that David had been trying to market for publication. \"Learning to Live with Guilt, It's Not as Bad as You Think,\" Destiny read out loud.\n\n\nDestiny couldn't believe Matthew was reading David's book, and she accused him of making his move in an attempt to get Dani back. She wondered if Matthew's parents were aware of all that had happened and suggested that she would be happy to tell them. Matthew panicked and pleaded with Destiny not to say anything. He was sure their reputations would be ruined. Destiny called him on his lack of concern for his friends and, though Matthew thought that Nate deserved what he got, a little, he admitted he had been worried during the ordeal and felt terrible. Destiny breathed a sigh of relief and confirmed that she believed him.\n\n\nDestiny admitted that she had trouble keeping her mouth shut and always got what she wanted. Matthew conceded that Destiny was powerful and agreed to her demands so that she wouldn't talk to his parents. She wanted him to be nice to both Nate and Dani, she wanted him to never do anything similar again, and she wanted him to \"burn that book.\" Matthew wasn't thrilled, but he consented to all of it.\n\n\nIn James's hospital room, James asked his brother what was wrong. \"A clueless girl,\" Ford replied. The talk turned to the young men's mother, and Ford was adamant in his opinion that she had left them. James wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and expressed the opinion that they really didn't know what had happened. He felt that not all women were like their mother. \"You'll learn,\" Ford declared. He thought that James should just stay away from women because the right girl didn't even exist. \"You can't let a woman run your life,\" he advised his younger brother.\n\n\n\"Not every woman is like her, Bobby,\" James said, making reference to their mother. Ford especially wanted James to stay away from Starr. Just as Ford stated his opinion, Starr walked into the room.\n\n\nOut in the hallway, Nate and Dani shared a laugh as they realized they had both shown up at the same time to apologize to James for all that had occurred. Dani admitted that her mother was doing okay but, as she told Nate about a day in the life of T\ufffda, her tone changed and her eyes filled with tears. Her insides were screaming out for her mother not to die, she told Nate. T\ufffda was brave and just went about her routine with a smile. Nate was at a loss for words, but Dani assured him that was fine. She mentioned that the charges against Todd had been dropped, and Nate gave her a hug. He asked her to hang out and, hesitantly, Dani agreed. She had left her mom in \"good hands.\"\n\n\nMarkko and Langston shared a passionate kiss at Angel Square Park, but suddenly they pulled apart. \"We can't go back,\" Markko stated. He stressed that something had been wrong in their relationship to begin with if Langston had felt the need to see someone else. He thought too much had changed with each of them. He had other news for a tearful Langston. He was transferring to UCLA, after receiving a full scholarship, and he planned to leave the next morning.\n\n\nLangston was happy for Markko though she continued to sniffle. Markko revealed that he was leaving with Karen, the pizza girl. Langston was astonished, but Markko reminded her that he had known Karen \"forever,\" and she wanted to try her hand at acting in California. They would be able to share expenses and driving on the way. Langston and Markko recalled the date of their first kiss and the importance of first love. Markko wished Langston luck in her future.\n\n\nLangston was sure Markko would win an Oscar someday, and she would be able to say she knew him. She was his inspiration, Markko told her. \"Until I blew it,\" Langston said. Markko promised that wasn't what he would remember. They hugged as tears rolled down both of their faces. \"You're still a freak,\" Markko said. \"And don't you forget it,\" Langston replied.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, T\ufffda was dumbfounded after she received Todd's proposal of marriage. She wondered if it was because she was dying or because he could \"see the finish line.\" Todd assured her that it was because T\ufffda was able to make such remarks to him and because Dani didn't hate him anymore. It was also because T\ufffda was the love of his life, he added. T\ufffda couldn't believe her ears, but Todd repeated it and confessed that he hadn't been happy since their previous wedding day. He wanted their remaining time together to be happy, and vowed things would be different.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki made a quick change in her phone conversation as David returned with a glass of wine. She pretended to be upset and ordered Charlie to stay at La Boulaie. She hung up and turned to David. She suggested they talk about David \"in the smallest bathing suit the law will allow.\" David was taken aback and stated that he thought he had been hired for his talents and not his assets. He advised her his Independence Day suit was put away. Viki revealed that a particular designer had a new line of suits, and she thought David could model and review them. She would be the photographer. \"Interesting touch,\" David gulped as Viki told him to take his clothes off.\n\n\nShortly after, David returned in a robe with a Christmas swimsuit underneath. Viki continued to pour it on as she advised David he would be a gift to her readers. She pushed him to lick his lips and run his fingers through his hair as she began to snap photos of him. She played her role of official photographer to the hilt. She insisted on looking at the suit he was wearing because she wanted to see what Santa planned on giving her for Christmas. David thought she was \"coming on\" to him, and Viki agreed that maybe he was right.\n\n\nEli arrived at La Boulaie and immediately suggested that he and Blair prepare a wedding announcement for the newspapers. Blair promised that Jack had probably spread the word already, and Eli asked if Jack was happy for them. \"Sure,\" Blair replied, unenthusiastically.\n\n\nJust then, T\ufffda and Todd showed up and congratulated the couple on their news. They had some of their own, and T\ufffda divulged that Todd had proposed. After more congratulations, Todd announced that he loved T\ufffda and wanted to spend his life with her. \"The timing is what it is,\" Todd remarked. He wanted to tell his sons, but Blair advised him the boys were out. They already loved the half-naked lady, she joked. Eli was perplexed as the others all laughed and told him it was a long story.\n\n\nBlair thought they should set dates because they all wanted the children to be present. Todd made it known that he wouldn't stand for a double wedding. Eli wanted to get married as soon as possible, and Todd lost his temper. He yelled that he was first because T\ufffda was sick. The atmosphere grew tense and awkward. T\ufffda noted that she and Todd did not have time on their side. Eli spoke again, stating that they couldn't wait to start their life together. He referred to Blair, himself, and the kids. Todd took offense and reminded Eli that the kids were Todd's. Eli agreed but noted that they would be in his life too. \"Not if I can help it,\" Todd muttered. \"Here we go,\" both T\ufffda and Blair sighed.\n\n\n",
