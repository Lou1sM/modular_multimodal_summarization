    "soap_central": "\n\nOutside of the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, after David asked for Viki's help, he pulled out a long list, which reached to the ground, of the names of all the people who had ever held a grudge against him.  David announced that Viki's name was at the top of the list.  When Viki expressed shock, David reminded her of when he had pretended to be her brother in 1994.\n\n\nDavid continued reading the names off of the list.  When David said Todd, Viki declared that David was not on Todd's radar.  After David mentioned Viki's sister, Tina, Viki insisted that Tina had no radar.  David quickly erased those names off of the list.  David then reflected that although Clint had been busy dying, he did have a cell phone and a very scary contact list.  David circled Clint's name.  Once David read off Langston's name, Viki asked why.  David explained that he might have changed a few lines in \"Vickerman\" -- or all of them.\n\n\nAs David continued to read the names on the list that included the Hell's Angels and the Writer's Guild, Viki regretted that it was an afternoon that she would never get back.  Viki then speculated that the person might have been a scorned woman, who had wanted to get back at him.  David claimed that the suspicion then fell back onto Viki.\n\n\nViki insisted that David had not jilted her, and that she truly only wanted David and Dorian back together.  When David wondered if it had been Addie, Viki knew that Addie had always wanted Dorian to be happy.  Then Viki pondered if Dorian had been the target.  Once David explained about Ionia and the photos, Viki realized who had been the culprit.\n\n\nWhen David asked for the identity of the home wrecker, Viki declared that the person was an old pro at it.  Viki exclaimed, \"Now this all makes sense, especially the pictures, and she's awfully good at crawling around in the dirt.  And she blames Dorian even more than she blames me, because Dorian is the one who got the proof.\"  David agreed that it had been \"Echo DiSavoy, professional home wrecker.\"\n\n\nViki realized that Echo had been plotting when Viki had called her on the phone.  Viki then stated that she needed to leave for Sam's party, but David refused to allow it.  David cried, \"Look, Dorian's got all of my clothing at her house -- near open flame and scissors.  Please, Viki, can't you go with me?\"  When Viki questioned if it was for the sake of David's wardrobe, David insisted that it was for the sake of true love.  David explained that he would also need backup to get past the front door of La Boulaie.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian discovered Echo at the pool, and Echo announced that she was there to see David.  Echo revealed that she had found a DVD of David's audition reel at Buchanan mansion, and that she wanted to hand it to David.  Dorian demanded that Echo leave her property and screamed that David would not be returning there.\n\n\nWhen Dorian declared that she had kicked David out, Echo said that she had read about it in the paper.  Echo related that she knew what it was like \"to have your heart broken,\" and Dorian discovered that a Bloody Mary had given Echo the courage to be there.  When Echo yelled that she was sure that Dorian's good friend, Viki, had been a big help, Dorian recognized that Viki had been busy.  Echo indicated that Viki was not Dorian's friend, and that Dorian should have turned to a true friend.\n\n\nEcho understood what Dorian had been through, since Echo had once been there herself, thanks to Dorian.  However, Dorian yelled that if Echo had kept her big mouth shut about the tape, Dorian would not have had a reason to hurt her.  Echo began to leave and told Dorian to enjoy her party, when Dorian realized that Echo had known that David was not at La Boulaie, and that Echo knew that Dorian had lost both her husband and her best friend.\n\n\nOnce she remembered that Echo was a photographer, Dorian exclaimed that it all made sense and declared, \"It was you all along.\"  After Dorian discovered that Echo had taken the pictures of Ionia and David, Echo mentioned that she had not forced Dorian's boy toy to grope the other woman.  When Echo blared that Dorian should not have destroyed Echo's relationship with Charlie, Dorian howled that Echo would not destroy Dorian's relationship with David.  Echo claimed that she already had.\n\n\nDorian slapped Echo, and as Echo laughed and ran off, Dorian grabbed a hose.  Echo found another hose, and they sprayed each other with the hoses.  Later, David and Viki ran over to the empty pool area, and David called out for Dorian.  David cried out that Viki had figured it out, and that it had been Echo.  Viki saw the hoses, and David noted that it did not look good.\n\n\nAt the police station, Natalie informed John that she had placed a rush on the results of the prints, as John looked through a file.  John indicated that he had found the file in Todd's office at the Sun.  Natalie asked if the file had anything to do with the dead body found at Dorian's.  John stated that Sam had been a witness to the shooting.  John explained that Sam had said that his friend had shot the man.  Sam had then identified the man, and John showed Natalie a picture of Todd with his original face.  When John claimed that Sam had not seemed confused, Natalie reminded him that Sam was Jack's brother and was, therefore, a Manning.\n\n\nJohn commented that all they had was the photo and the file, and Natalie wondered why her uncle would have a document that was so totally encrypted.  A cop opened the office door and announced that they had a hit on John Doe's prints.  John noted to Natalie that the Central Intelligence Agency used that type of encryption code.  John then pointed out that it was Tomas Delgado's file.\n\n\nJohn stressed that Todd, Tomas, and John Doe all had encrypted files.  When Natalie did not see the connection, John insisted that it was all in her hands.  John pointed out that the files of Todd and Tomas contained photos of how Todd had looked in the past.  John then noted that Sam had claimed that the man with Todd's original face had shot John Doe, and that was the connection.\n\n\nOutside of the door at the Manning estate, the man with the scar knocked out Spider-Man and said, \"So much for your spidey sense.\"  Inside the kitchen, Blair was preparing for Sam's party, and Jack stated that Dorian would not miss it for the world.  In the living room, Starr told Baz that her mom really liked his dad.\n\n\nFrom the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Nate called Dani, who was waiting for the party to start.  Nate informed Dani that he would be unable to make it to the party, because he had to work a double shift.  Dani offered to slip out a piece of cake for Nate, but he refused and hurried off of the phone.  Deanna claimed that Nate had done the right thing, as Destiny listened unseen.  Deanna remarked that what happened at the Minute Man stayed at the Minute Man.\n\n\nSitting in her booth, Destiny believed that Nate was cheating on Dani.  Destiny called Dani and declared that something was wrong.  When Destiny realized that the party was starting, she decided not to tell Dani.  However, Dani wanted to know what was wrong, so she left the party.  Later, Dani joined Destiny at the caf\u00e9.  Dani insisted that Destiny had sounded upset, and Dani wanted to know what was wrong.  Destiny indicated that she had just been thinking of Matthew and pleaded with Dani to return to the party.\n\n\nAfter Dani asked where Nate was, Destiny revealed that Nate was not working, and that he was with Deanna.  Dani believed that Nate had wanted to blow off the party, so she wanted to call Nate, but Destiny tried to stop her.  Dani tried to call Nate, but he would not answer.  Destiny informed Dani that Nate and Deanna had wanted a hotel room at the Minute Man.  Dani ran out of the caf\u00e9 to find the room.\n\n\nAt the Minute Man, Rick welcomed Nate and Deanna into the room and said that they would be taking off their clothes and having sex.  When Nate's phone rang, Rick insisted that Nate put it on vibrate and demanded that they do the scene in one take.  After Nate wanted to know what his motivation was for the scene, Rick offered Nate's and Deanna's own scenarios as their motivation.\n\n\nDeanna told Nate that she was glad that her mom did not know her as the porn star.  Nate decided that they should have porn star names and declared that Deanna was \"China Lake,\" and that he was \"Buster Ridge.\"  Nate insisted that it would be China and Buster doing the scenes, not Deanna and Nate.  As Deanna sat on the bed, Rick asked her to wet her lips, and to give him a little kitten.  Deanna declared that she only wanted to scratch his eyes out.  When Nate walked out of the bathroom in skimpy shorts, Rick exclaimed that Nate and Deanna were smoking hot, and that they would not be in their wardrobe for long.  Dani knocked on the door.\n\n\nBack at Todd's mansion, Todd asked about the entertainment, and T\u00e9a responded that Spider-Man would arrive at any second.  Blair greeted Tomas, as she walked into the living room.  Sam looked at all of his birthday gifts and exclaimed that his dad had said that a big surprise was on its way.  When the man with the scar, who was dressed as Spider-Man, knocked on the door, Todd answered.  Todd told the man to do a good job entertaining Sam, or he would replace him like that and snapped his fingers.\n\n\nBlair squealed that Spider-Man was perfect and asked where Todd had found him.  Sam showed off his knowledge of Spider-Man and revealed that spidey sense was what Spider-Man used when he knew there was danger, and that Spider-Man was using it.  After Blair asked Spider-Man a question, Starr explained that Spider-Man did not talk.  Sam asked Spider-Man to show him the web shooter.\n\n\nTodd insisted to Tomas that he would do anything for his family.  Baz watched from the other side of the room and called Todd and Tomas hypocrites.  Starr believed that Baz was just looking for a reason to hate Tomas.  As Spider-Man watched and listened, Todd revealed to Jack that he knew who had knocked Jack out at the Sun and then announced that it had been someone from Origami Cogs.\n\n\nIn the lobby, Blair informed T\u00e9a that she had taken Sam to the police station, because they had discovered a dead body at the La Boulaie pool.  Blair then announced that the man had been shot and indicated that she had not yet told Todd.  When Blair claimed that Sam had witnessed the shooting, T\u00e9a wondered if the victim had been Sam's imaginary friend.  Blair said no, as Starr ran into the lobby to grab a camera for pictures.\n\n\nIn the living room, Blair cheered Sam and Spider-Man on to smile for the camera and took the picture.  Starr indicated to Baz that she was better with reptiles than with spiders.  Blair took numerous pictures of Tomas and Baz, and Spider-Man, Starr, and Sam.  Todd shot a picture of Spider-Man posed between T\u00e9a and Blair.  When Tomas asked if he should be jealous, Blair laughed and said, \"I don't know.  He is a bona fide superhero.  Todd, I think I would watch it if I were you.\"  T\u00e9a walked up to Todd and insisted that her heart belonged to Todd Manning, as Spider-Man looked on.\n\n\nTodd announced that since he had paid for the party, he would be allowed to give a speech for Sam.  Todd declared to his family that he did not want take anything for granted, and that he did not want to lose them all.  When T\u00e9a insisted that Todd would not lose them, Todd claimed that he knew that he was lucky.  Blair wanted a group photo and begged everyone to pose.  Todd handed Spider-Man the camera and told him to make himself useful.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a asked where Dani was, Blair revealed that Dani had left to visit Destiny.  Todd demanded that Spider-Man take the picture, and the man with the scar said that he would with pleasure.  Blair then asked Spider-Man to watch Sam, as the rest of them ran out of the room to do one more thing.  Blair lit the candle on the birthday cake, and they all walked back into an empty room.\n\n\nThe man with the scar took Sam into his hotel room and removed his mask.  Sam cried out, \"It's you,\" and the man nodded and said, \"Happy Birthday, kid.\"  Sam asked, \"You're Spider-Man?\"  After the man answered, \"Sometimes,\" Sam responded, \"Wow!  Why did you bring me here?\" \n\n\n",
