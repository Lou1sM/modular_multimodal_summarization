    "soap_central": "\nTough Brakes\n\n\nRex was at the Bon Jour Caf\u00e9 asking Noelle questions about Bo. Noelle recalled seeing Bo earlier that day. She warned Rex that Bo had been in bad shape and drinking. Rex listened as Noelle recounted what had transpired between Bo and Mo. Mo had tried to get Bo to eat some pie but Bo had been intent on staying inebriated. Rex continued to question Noelle as he tried to figure out where Bo had been headed when he left the diner. As they talked, Rex mentioned that Gigi had helped him track Bo to Texas. Noelle was excited at the mention of her friend's name. Rex barely managed to get a word in edgewise as Noelle went on and on about Gigi and Shane, and how Gigi had been in love with Shane's father. Noelle didn't seem to notice how uncomfortable her words made Rex. Luckily, Noelle then switched the subject and talked about her romance with Mo. She credited David Vickers for bringing them together. Rex was surprised to hear David's name, but steered the discussion back to Bo. Mo joined them and said that the only thing that he recalled Bo saying as he left was something about \"Pa.\" \n\n\nAt the ranch in Texas, Chuck opened the front door to find Bo weaving side to side on the doorstep. Although Chuck was pleased to see Bo, he couldn't help but ask him the reason for the unexpected visit. Bo said little beyond that he hadn't planned on stopping by the ranch. Chuck told Bo that he was welcome to visit the ranch any time as he escorted Bo to the living room. Before leaving Bo alone, Chuck warned him that a nasty storm was moving in. \n\n\nAs Bo poured himself a drink, Asa appeared in a vision and accused Bo of being a drunken bum, who had turned out to be quite the disappointment. Bo reminded Asa that he wasn't in a position to hurt him anymore. Asa scoffed at that and continued to berate his son. Asa told him that Bo's quest, to always do the right thing, hadn't done Bo any favors. It had put Lindsay in Bo's life twice, cost him his job with the police department, and allowed Dorian to take over Buchanan Enterprises. \n\n\nDorian climbed into the back of her limo, holding a huge pair of garden shears. She was unaware that David Vickers was behind the wheel of the car. Dorian demanded to be taken to La Boulaie and then began talking about her plans for the garden tool when she arrived home and confronted her sister's new husband. David drove off without saying a word. Moments later, he managed to catch Dorian by surprise and snatched the shears out of her hands. Dorian was outraged when she realized that David was driving her car. She insisted on an explanation, but David made it clear that he was in control. He told her that he had found Rohypnol in Dorian's medical bag and wanted to know why she had it. Dorian lied and gave several medical reasons before declaring that the medication was old. David didn't believe her and accused her of using the medication to get Charlie drunk. Dorian deflected and asked David why he had been snooping in her medical bag. David told her about Langston's scheme to seduce David and have Markko capture it on film. Dorian was pleased to realize that Langston had been willing to go to such great lengths in order to help Dorian. As David and Dorian continued to bicker, they began to experience car trouble. It turned out that the car was out of gas. When Dorian began screeching at David, he walked off, abandoning Dorian and the car on the side of the road. Dorian warned David that there would be repercussions. \n\n\nAt the diner, Gigi brought Charlie a cup of coffee and joined him in the booth. They talked about Viki and the mistakes that Charlie had made. Charlie confided that he believed that he had figured out why he was drunk, but not how he was forced to drink alcohol. The subject then switched to Rex and Adriana's marriage. Gigi told Charlie that Adriana was responsible for Brody's arrival in Llanview. As she spoke about Brody, Charlie realized that Gigi might be with him for Shane's sake. When he asked Gigi if that was the case, Gigi answered by saying that she would do whatever she could to make Shane happy. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki bumped into Natalie and Jared as they prepared to leave for the vineyard. She was carrying a basket of garden chemicals that she intended to put away before she went to a nursery. Jared offered to take the basket to the cellar for Viki. Viki seemed reluctant to accept his offer but relented when Jared insisted. Viki then turned her attention to Natalie. Natalie told her mother about Jessica's request for a special case of wine. Viki offered to run the errand for Natalie, explaining that the cottage was very close to the nursery. While Natalie stepped away to take a call, Jared took the opportunity to talk to Viki about Charlie. Viki listened as Jared told her that Charlie was in a difficult position. Jared had made Charlie choose between the woman he loved and his son. Viki pointed out that Charlie didn't have to lie about being Rex's father. Jared agreed but asked Viki to consider giving Charlie another chance. Viki told Jared that she did not want to discuss it with him further just as Natalie returned, holding her car keys. Viki took them from her daughter and left. \n\n\nTess was in Llanfair's kitchen talking to Nash about the grisly car crash she had arranged for Natalie and Jared by cutting the brake line in Natalie's car. She was dancing with Nash when Natalie and Jared walked in. Tess covered her curious behavior with the excuse that the song playing on the radio had a special meaning to her and Nash. Tess then changed the subject and asked the couple what they were doing in the kitchen. Natalie explained that Viki had offered to pick up the wine and borrowed Natalie's car. Tess showed little reaction to the news. Natalie then asked for the key to the cupboard so that she and Jared could store the poisonous chemicals that Viki wanted safely stored away. Tess tossed the keys and waited for them to leave. Alone again with Nash, Tess expressed her annoyance. She hadn't planned on Viki being killed that day. She had little remorse, though, that Viki would be killed. The way Tess saw it, Viki deserved to die for what she had allowed to happen to Jessica as a little girl. \n\n\nTess didn't despair for too long. She decided to grab one of the poisons that Jared and Natalie had put away, and added it to the pesto risotto on the stove. Later, she served Jared and Natalie the deadly dish, forgoing a portion for herself. She told them that her morning sickness tended to last all day. \n\n\nViki was driving and thinking about Charlie when she spotted Dorian, stranded on the side of the road. Viki tried to slow down but her brakes failed. Dorian, determined to force the car to a stop, stepped into the car's path and stood her ground. Behind Dorian, guardrails loomed. \n\n\nBo was in the horse stables, preparing to ride. Outside, the thunder boomed as Bo took a drink from a nearly empty bottle of whiskey. As Rex arrived at the ranch, Bo had a vision of Rex, pleading with him not to go out riding.\n\n\n",

Natalie and Jared come back to the kitchen and Tess is shocked that Viki took the car. When Natalie and Jared go to take the chemicals downstairs, Tess talks to Nash.
