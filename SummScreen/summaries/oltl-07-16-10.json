Nate added, \"My mother almost murdered me when she found out,\" as Inez walked up to them.  Inez exclaimed that she was furious with Nate, and that she would be returning the money.  Inez was upset that Nate had lied about winning the money in the lottery.  Inez demanded to know the hospital room number for James and, once Nate gave it, she left.  Nate warned, \"Ford'd better not treat her like he treated me.\"\n\n\nDani suggested that they get the money from Todd, and Nate refused.  Dani asked Nate if his dad had ever paid child support, and Nate replied, \"What dad?  I never even met him.  I think he ditched my mom when she was pregnant.  She never talks about him.\"  Nate admitted that he did not know his dad and declared, \"It's always been me and my mom.  You can't miss what you've never known.\"  \n\n\nDani asked if Nate had ever wondered about his dad, and Nate speculated that his dad must have been a jerk.  Dani questioned if Nate maybe had \"a whole other family\" on his dad's side. Dani wondered if, once Nate turned eighteen, Inez would tell hum his dad's name. Nate observed that his mom was not stating anything at the time.\n\n\nIn James's hospital room, Bobby Ford asked James to stay away from Starr, and James responded, \"Sorry, brother, it's a promise that I can't keep.\" He added,  \"Come on in, Twinkle,\" as Starr opened the door.  Starr carried in take-out food and stated, \"And you know they have a saying, when you shoot someone, you owe them.  So, I'm here to pay off my debt.\"  Bobby asked Starr how Cole would feel that Starr visited James then he left.\n\n\nJames informed Starr that he was confused about Starr's visit, since he felt that they had already said goodbye.  When James questioned where Cole was and suggested that maybe Cole was with Hannah, Starr explained that Marty believed that Cole could get through to Hannah at St. Ann's, when Marty could not.  Starr insisted that she and Cole were fine, but James did not believe her.  Starr stressed that it was none of James's business, but then admitted that she and Cole had argued, since Cole had believed that she and James had slept together.  \n\n\nJames asked, \"Did you tell him we kissed?\"  Starr reminded James that the kiss was a cover-up for the goon.  However, James revealed that he had enjoyed hiding out with Starr.  James exclaimed that he could not let her go, even if they had to be on the run for the rest of their lives.  Starr apologized and asserted that she was with Cole, and that she was sorry if she had misled James.  Starr told James goodbye again and left.\n\n\nInez found Bobby flirting with a girl in the hospital lobby, and Bobby demanded to know what Inez was doing in the hospital.  Inez begged to know if Bobby were okay and insisted that she had been wanting to visit him in the hospital, and Bobby asked, \"Why?\"  Inez responded, \"I'm your mother.\"  Bobby yelled that he did not want to see Inez, since she had left \"us\" to deal with \"that man all by ourselves.\"  \n\n\nWhen Inez asked about James, Bobby explained about James and the money.  Bobby related that Inez did not even care about James and stressed that she would not be seeing James at all.  As Bobby stormed off, Inez cried.  A nurse walked by, and Inez stated that she wanted to know the location of the accounting department, so that she could pay the medical expenses for James.  When the nurse informed Inez that James was still in the hospital, Inez acknowledged that he would not want to see her.\n\n\nBobby ran back into James's room, and James asked why Bobby had been yelling at Starr.  Bobby replied, \"It wasn't Starr.  No one you know.\"\n\n\nAt St. Ann's, John greeted Marty in the hall.  Marty informed John that Cole was talking to Hannah and claimed that Cole was trying to get Hannah to open up to him, because she trusted him.  John expressed that he had tried to make a deal with Hannah -- the name of the perpetrator in exchange for immunity.  John pointed out that once Eli had shown up at the police station, Hannah had confessed to both crimes and had ended up in the mental institution.  Marty wondered if Eli had coached Hannah.\n\n\nJohn was uncertain if Hannah had actually pushed Marty down the stairs.  \"All I know is none of it adds up.\"  Marty speculated that Hannah might be faking, and that maybe she was really innocent.  If that were the case, John guessed, \"Then she's covering up for someone.\"\n\n\nIn a room at St. Ann's, Cole begged Hannah to tell him the truth and reminded her that she had claimed that she would tell him who had been responsible for the attacks.  Hannah remembered Eli's threats, just as Cole asked, \"What happened?  Why the 180?\"  Hannah replied, \"Because of you.\"\n\n\nHannah revealed that her confession and breakdown were because of Cole, because he had left her \"alone with him.\"  When Cole asked if she meant that she had been left alone with Eli, Hannah evaded the question and asked why she would confess to doing those things and making it all up, if she had not really committed the crimes.  Cole speculated that maybe Eli had told Hannah to fake her breakdown to stay out of prison.\n\n\nHannah cried that Cole must hate her for everything, and Cole insisted that he realized that Hannah just needed help.  Hannah then exclaimed that Cole could \"go home and live happily ever after with Starr and Hope...because of me.\"  Cole maintained that he just wanted Hannah to get better, as John opened the door and informed Cole that he needed to talk to Hannah.  After Cole told Hannah that it was goodbye, Hannah insisted, \"Everything that I did, I did it for you.\"  Cole left.\n\n\nJohn entered the room and told Hannah that if she wanted to tell the truth but had to keep the secret, because she was afraid, she could always call him.  When Hannah asked if John hated her, John proclaimed, \"I hate the person who hurt Marty and the baby.\"\n\n\nAs Cole walked into the hall, after talking to Hannah, Marty asked if Cole had thought that Hannah was faking, and Cole insisted that he did not know.  Marty begged Cole not to let Hannah get in the way of the important things, which were his two girls, Starr and Hope.  Cole agreed and left.\n\n\nJohn walked back into the hall, as Marty finished her cell phone call.  Marty informed him that she would have a couple of colleagues check on Hannah.  However, Marty said that if Hannah were really guilty of the crimes, it would not matter if Hannah stayed in the institution or was sent to prison.  Marty simply stated, \"Our baby's gone,\" as she walked off.\n\n\nStarr saw Cole in the park, and after Cole updated her about Hannah, he asked her about Hope.  Starr revealed that she had not seen Hope, and that she had actually been visiting James in the hospital.\n\n\nAlone in the room at St. Ann's, Hannah remarked out loud, \"I told the truth, Cole.  I did everything for you, so Eli won't hurt you.\"\n\n\nIn Evangeline's hospital room, Layla cried that Evangeline was not even aware, but Cristian insisted that at least she was not in any pain.  As they walked into the hall, Layla begged to know what she should do, since Evangeline needed the machines to live, and her mother refused to take Evangeline off of them.  Cristian stressed that since Lisa was her mom, she would not want to end Evangeline's life.  Layla yelled that Evangeline was not going to get any better and explained, \"All I want is for my mother to do what is right for my sister.\"  Layla questioned if Evangeline had ever stated her desires in such a situation to Cristian, when they had been together, and he answered, \"No.\"  As Layla expressed her wish that Evangeline had drawn up a living will, Lisa walked out into the hall and wanted to know if Layla were talking of killing her sister again.\n\n\nLisa questioned Layla's desire to tell Evangeline that she was marrying Cristian.  Lisa then stressed that Evangeline just wanted to live.  Layla asked if Lisa had found a living will for Evangeline, since Evangeline had been an attorney.  Cristian offered that he and Layla could stop by the Williamsons' house and search for Evangeline's living will.\n\n\nAt the La Boulaie swimming pool, Blair begged Todd not to ruin the happy occasion for the two couples' engagements.  Eli reminded Todd that he had not forgotten that Todd had killed his brother, Ross.  When Todd denied murdering Ross, T\ufffda admitted that Ross was still alive, but that since Ross was still a fugitive, she, Todd, and Dani had elected not to tell the truth.  However, T\ufffda believed that since Dani knew that T\ufffda was dying, Dani might want to reach out to Ross.  Eli demanded to know how T\ufffda could keep that secret from him.  \n\n\nT\ufffda apologized to Eli, but Todd claimed that Eli did not even care about Ross.  Todd asked T\ufffda if she had ever even known that Ross had a brother before Eli had shown up.  Eli punched Todd, and they threatened each other with more bodily harm.  To stop the fight, T\ufffda threw Todd in the pool, and Blair tossed in Eli.  Blair stated to T\ufffda, \"By the way, congratulations,\" and T\ufffda responded, \"Back at you, sister.\"  As Todd and Eli swam out of the pool, Blair carried out a bottle of champagne.  Blair and Eli, and Todd and T\ufffda toasted each other to live a happy and long life. Eli wished T\ufffda the best, as they all clinked glasses.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Charlie informed Dorian that he was attracted to her, yet Dorian asked why he kept pushing her away.  Charlie insisted that he was afraid of his feelings for Dorian and of having to compete with David.  Charlie related that all of Llanview was aware that Dorian and David's sex life was legendary, and that Dorian was not yet over David.  Dorian claimed that she and David were over.  \"I need a real man.  A man with integrity and strength.  A man who will not abandon me, because he booked a hemorrhoid commercial.\"  Charlie maintained that David was still David and feared that Viki \"would succumb to him.\"\n\n\nCharlie and Dorian both admitted that David was \"a vigorous young man,\" and Charlie revealed that he had caught Viki checking out David.  However, Charlie believed that Dorian thought that David \"would always be carrying a torch\" for her.  Dorian insisted that she gave up that torch long before, and that she hoped that Charlie recognized Viki \"for the controlling, judgmental prig that she has always been.\"  Dorian wondered if she and Charlie should fight fire with fire, but Charlie felt that Dorian was above being with Charlie, who would just turn to Dorian, because \"David and Viki are rolling in the hay.\"  Dorian reminded Charlie, \"Keep in mind that Viki invited David to move in with the two of you.\"  Charlie replied, \"And she can have him now.  There's nothing stopping us,\" as Charlie kissed Dorian.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, as Viki attempted to flirt with David, she told him that he was \"a very attractive man.\"  After David reflected that Viki had never let him \"get to first base\" before, he revealed that he had always wanted Viki and that he loved the chase.  \"Of course, I'm interested in you.  You've got a smoking swimming pool.  You're beautiful.  You've got the best wine cellar in town.\"  However, Viki  regretted, falsely, \"But at the end of the day, you're still in love with Dorian.\"\n\n\nDavid denied that he was still in love with Dorian and after seeing her expression, asked Viki if something was wrong.  Viki shrieked that she believed that Charlie was turning to Dorian.  As Viki ran into David's arms, she cried that Charlie was always with Dorian, and that he had actually called out Dorian's name one night during love-making.  David declared, \"That dirty dog.\"  Viki recognized that David must be very upset, since he had always hoped, one day, that Dorian would return to him.  As David tried and failed several times to pry Viki from his arms, he stated that he had given up on Dorian.  As Viki finally left David's arms, she exclaimed that she enjoyed his splendid body as much as anyone.  Viki insisted that she refused to resist David, while Charlie was throwing himself at Dorian.\n\n\nDavid asked, \"You're sure Charlie's with Dorian?\"  Viki declared, \"Are you kidding?  Did you see the way he leapt at the chance to go to her house to work?  They're not working!\"  Viki then continued,\" Charlie isn't mine anymore.  He's Dorian's now.\"  David asked, \"So, that means?\"  Viki answered, \"That means I'm all yours.\"  David cautioned, \"Maybe we should...\" as Viki planted a big kiss on David.\n\n\n",
