Rex tells Layla that he's worried about Adriana. She tells him that she dug himself too deep of a hole to get out of. He tells her that he knows there's something wrong with Tate and he's not the only one -- Bo thinks so too. She doesn't think that they have anything on Tate and that it's nothing more than Rex's jealousy and Bo's job. He tells her she forgave Vincent, but she tells him Vincent wanted to change and was truly sorry and she just doesn't see that happening with Rex. Rex tries making Layla understand that he just wants to protect Adriana.\n\n\nTate and Adriana meet with the funeral director, who is part Dominican, and Tate reacts strangely and both Adriana and the funeral director question his reaction. Tate tries to dodge discussing his father; he doesn't want a viewing, just wants things done quickly and quietly. Adriana suggests a public funeral to try to attract the OPP but he freaks out and doesn't care what she thinks and dismisses the idea. He apologizes for \"being cynical\". She tells him that she has to leave for work and she gives him a kiss on the cheek that he continues to wipe off after she's left. Tate is daydreaming about planning Adriana's funeral and is interrupted by the funeral director. After he leaves, Tate calls someone from the OPP and tells them he wants that \"unpure bitch dead\" as Rex walks in. When Adriana gets home she finds an OPP medallion with Tate's backpack.\n\n\nPark security thinks they hear something in the bushes but they don't see Todd even though he's feet away from them. Todd eventually manages to get up on his own and stumble off.\n\n\nBlair is trying to get Marty to work with her against Miles when Natalie comes up and interrupts. Blair asks about Jessica and David, who says \"If you're willing to help somebody anything can happen.\" Natalie leaves to go do work and Marty tells Blair that Cole has nothing to do with Todd being missing. Blair tells Marty she knows the marriage is a sham, but Marty walks off. Starr and Cole are still at the table talking and he wants to know what Brit wanted. Starr tells him it's nothing; she's just being her normal bitchy self. Cole goes to talk to Brit on his own and tells her to stay away from Starr. As Miles is bringing drinks back, Spencer pops up and tells him just to go ahead and kill Todd -- or at the very least drug him up more so he doesn't sneak off. Miles becks Cole over and tells him to call his phone so he has an excuse to leave and brings the drinks back over to the table. Cole calls Miles' phone enough for it to ring and Miles fakes the call and Cole comes to sit down as Blair shows up and says she changed her mind about dinner. Miles apologizes but he really has to leave. Blair says she's going to call John and have him followed after Miles leaves, but Cole shouts \"NO!\" and tells her that Miles will figure out that they're onto him. Later Cole tells Marty that he knows about her secret and knows that she killed Spencer.\n\n\nNatalie is at Rodi's in the corner doing work on a presentation when Vincent walks over. They chat and he tells her that she still misses John, but she turns the tables on him and asks about Layla and his love life. He tells her that she's only focusing so much on her work because she misses John and doesn't have anyone else in her life romantically. She tells him that she's got her first business trip coming up, she's excited. He tells her she'll do just fine. He has to leave as his meeting partner has just shown up. Natalie tells him it's good having him as a friend. John comes by later after having been to the hospital to give David back his ankle bracelet and tell him he'll still be bait to catch Spencer's murderer. He and Natalie talk about Marty and Miles and he tells her she doesn't know the whole story behind it and that she should stay away from Miles.\n\n\nMiles goes under the bridge where he'd kept Todd, only to find him missing. Todd is still wandering around Llanview.\n\n\n",

Adriana leaves Tate at the funeral home to take care of the arrangements for his father. Tate imagines the things that would happen if he arranged for Adriana to be killed.
