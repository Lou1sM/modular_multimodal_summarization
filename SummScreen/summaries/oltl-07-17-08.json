    "soap_central": "\nROAD KILL\n\n\nBo informed Rex that he was finished with Llanview and ordered him to leave the stable and Texas so that he could get on with his life. As he continued saddling up his horse, he questioned Rex on his ability to locate him. Rex relayed his story and how Delphina's ominous words led to Gigi's and Noelle's more fortuitous words and those led him straight to Bo. The entire story was almost lost after Rex mentioned stopping to see Gigi, the woman he loved. Bo picked up on that immediately and knowingly chided Rex that it was about time that he admitted it. \n\n\nIn Mendorra, Talia and Antonio cuddled together, with Talia feeling amazed that Antonio was still by her side, after learning that Carlo was her father. He felt that Talia had probably hidden it from herself for years and understood her not mentioning it. Talia felt that if she had told Antonio sooner, none of them would be prisoners in Mendorra and in the situation they found themselves in. Antonio completely disagreed and pointed out that Sarah was involved due to her mother and that they hadn't known about Carlo no longer being in prison. He added that he would have still chosen to be by her side, no matter where that was. They were interrupted by Jonas, who announced that it was time for them to head out for a \"big news day.\"\n\n\nAt the diner, Shane and Brody arrived while Gigi was working. They were happy about their day together, and Brody kissed Gigi unexpectedly on the cheek. She pulled away abruptly, grimacing. \"Are you mad that Dad kissed you?\" Shane asked his mom. Gigi quickly sent him to the kitchen on a mission as she turned to Brody and accused him of reeking of beer. Brody explained that he had had a couple of beers early on, with food, and that they had been watered down. He swore that he had not been drinking and driving and would do anything to take care of Shane. Gigi responded that Brody was nothing more than a drunken loser. \n\n\nDorian stood in the middle of the road, trying to flag down the sole car in the darkness. Narrowly missing her, the car finally stopped and the driver was revealed to be none other than Viki. Dorian yelled about almost getting killed, but Viki assured her that Dorian would have been road kill if she had really wanted to kill her. She added that the brakes had given her some difficulty and that she hadn't been able to stop the car any sooner than she did. Viki got out of the car and explained her mission to the vineyard. Dorian revealed how David had left her stranded, an action that Viki understood perfectly. \n\n\nAs they sat down to eat, Natalie proposed a toast to Nash. Jared and Tess/Jessica clinked glasses in unison. As Nat was about to put the first forkful into her mouth, Jess suddenly jumped up and cleared the table of all dinnerware and food, throwing the dishes to the other side of the room. Claiming to be upset over the toast, she ran upstairs and into the bathroom. \n\n\nAs Tina, Cain, Sarah, and Cris waited, Carlo appeared, along with the local press corps. \"All will be revealed,\" he promised. When Cris expressed his hatred for Carlo, the mobster pointed out that Cris still appeared to have the \"killer instinct\" and he thought that he had been cured. As everyone congregated, Carlo began to speak. He told the press that he was a citizen of both the U.S. and the world. He told them that Prince Helmut and his princess were frauds! \n\n\nReturning to her car and quickly locking her doors as Dorian banged on the windows, Viki calmly told a screaming Dorian to stop. In order to receive a ride, Dorian would have to do what she was told. Dorian snidely asked which of Viki's identities was driving. Viki told Dorian that even though La Boulaie was closer, she would have to accompany Viki to the vineyard first, and then she would be taken home. Dorian was not happy but grudgingly rescued her cell phone and doctor's bag from her own car. \n\n\nAs she splashed her face with cold water, Tess looked into the mirror and saw Jess. \"How the hell did you get out, Jessica?\" she asked. Jess promised to get rid of Tess again like she did in the past. Tess reminded Jess of how she behaved at the funeral and how she wanted to get back at Nat and Jared just like she did. Jess responded that she didn't want to kill them as Tess did. Tess agreed to give them a day's reprieve but pointed out that she was still happy, as Viki was probably going to wrap herself around a tree anyway. \"What have you done?\" Jess demanded to know. Tess explained that she damaged the brakes in the car meant for Nat and Jared. Jess begged her to somehow stop it from happening. Downstairs, Jared and Nat agreed that it had been a mistake for them to move back into Llanfair. \n\n\nRex changed the subject away from himself and told Bo that he could not ride the horse in the approaching storm. The men argued and Bo shoved Rex to the ground. Rex refused to leave and demanded that Bo provide him with answers as to why he was acting as he was. Bo revealed that Asa had called him a fool and a coward that very night. Rex asked Bo exactly how many bottles he had downed but the older man was still alert enough to lock Rex into one of the stalls. He finished readying his horse and rode out, leaving Rex behind. Rex managed to free himself and reluctantly saddled his own horse, following behind. \n\n\nIt was announced that the prince's staff member had DNA results and genealogical papers to prove that the prince was not the prince at all, even with his backside simulated birthmark. Carlo ordered the guards to take everyone prisoner. As Antonio and Talia arrived, they heard that the rightful heir was actually present and he was none other than Jonas Chamberlain. \n\n\nTess apologized but told Jess that the situation with the brakes was final. She figured that with the way Viki had treated her as a child (even though Viki was Niki at the time), that she deserved to die too. Jess begged her to stop it but her pleas fell on deaf ears. \n\n\nGigi conceded that she knew that Brody had been through tough times in Afghanistan but she could not have him drinking in Shane's company. Brody promised to stop. Gigi pondered telling Shane the truth about his father but she knew that he worshipped Brody. She felt that Brody needed to live up to his promise or he couldn't be around Shane any longer. \n\n\nJared suggested that he and Nat just be patient with Jess. Tess bounded down the stairs, catching Nat and Jared in a lip lock. She cleared her throat and assured them that she was feeling better. She enlightened them on the talk that she had with herself upstairs and assured them that such behavior would not happen again. She looked forward to another dinner and would even include Viki. \n\n\nRex caught up to Bo, who warned him that the horse would probably throw him. They came to a fence and Bo relayed how he never jumped that fence when he was a kid. He explained that he wasn't a chicken, but merely respecting someone else's property. He always did what was right for the right reasons. With no job, no woman, no family business, and no self-respect, he felt ready to jump the fence and be done with it. He decided that he wanted to see how things were on the other side for once, he explained to Rex. The young man pointed out that the dark side was highly overrated, having been there himself. As the thunder continued, Rex's horse was spooked and threw him onto the ground. Bo helped him up and told him to leave because Bo was still prepared to jump the fence. Rex tried to stop him, suggesting Bo shoot him. Bo reached for the metal fence as lightening flashed. \n\n\nGigi suggested that Brody attend AA meetings, as he obviously needed some type of help. Brody felt that Gigi needed help too. She made it clear that she was afraid that Brody would slip up and that Shane would end up hearing the truth. Again she wondered about just telling Shane the truth and getting it over with. Just then, Shane walked out of the kitchen and wondered what his parents were talking about. \n\n\nThe Mendorran press was ushered out. Carlo answered the question as to why he himself was present at this revealing. He bared his teeth and told everyone that there would be a royal wedding. He was about to see to it that Talia would be the future queen of Mendorra.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex goes to find Bo after Madam Delphina gave him the \"clues.\" He knows that Bo is in danger. And sure enough, Bo wants to ride a horse over a gait, in the rain, drunk, in an order to prove to Asa's ghost that he is not a coward. Back in Llanview, Gigi lays down the law to Shane about his drinking behavior around Shane. She tells him she doesn't want him around Shane until he makes some changes. Viki almost fails to stop her car when she sees Dorian on the street, after Tess cut her brakes. Dorian demands that Viki gives her a ride home. Viki tells Dorian only under certain conditions. Jessica struggles to come out and urge Tess not to endanger Viki nor kill Natalie or Jared. They argue but neither convinces the other. In Mendorra, Carlos Hesser exposes Tina and the prince as frauds, reveals that he is in charge, names Jonas Chamberlain as the new royalty and offers Jonas his \"daughter's\" (Talia) hand in marriage as Jonas' queen.",
