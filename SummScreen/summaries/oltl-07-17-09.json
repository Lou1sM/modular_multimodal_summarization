After confessing that she had slept with Todd in the cabana, Blair admitted that she had taken great pleasure in the fact that T\u00e9a had caught them in the act.  Appalled by Blair's confession, Dorian was convinced that Blair had an undying love for Todd.\n\n\nAlthough Blair was adamant that she wasn't in love with Todd, Blair related that she was fed up with T\u00e9a's constant interference in her life.  Dorian listened as Blair ranted about Todd spending his nights with T\u00e9a.  Dorian surmised that Blair didn't want Todd in her life, but that she didn't want anyone else to have him either.\n\n\nTodd returned home and searched the house for T\u00e9a.  Refusing to give Todd any information regarding T\u00e9a's location, Shaun read Todd a note that T\u00e9a had left behind.  In her note, T\u00e9a stated that meeting Todd was the biggest mistake of her life.  As Todd questioned T\u00e9a's declaration, Marty entered the house and stated that she shared T\u00e9a's sentiments.   Shaun excused himself and left Todd and Marty alone.\n\n\nMarty pushed Todd to the floor and demanded that he give her back her freedom.  When a confused Todd wondered what had caused her sudden outburst, Marty related that she was unable to develop a relationship with John because she couldn't get the thought of Todd out of her mind.  Stunned, Todd asked Marty if she loved him.  Laughing hysterically at Todd's inquiry, Marty told Todd that his past actions and claims of love had caused her to doubt her true feelings for John.  Marty insisted that she wanted to pursue a relationship with John, but that Todd's actions had left her mind in a state of ruins.\n\n\nStating that he couldn't change the past, Todd admitted that he could never apologize for falling in love with her.  An infuriated Marty told Todd that he wasn't capable of loving anyone.  Marty was certain that Todd only possessed the ability to damage the lives of others. Marty insisted that she could never be with John because of Todd.  Appearing troubled by Marty's revelation, Todd stated that he would do anything possible to fix her situation.\n\n\nConsumed with guilt, Todd blurted out that he had also hurt T\u00e9a by sleeping with Blair.  Marty was disgusted to learn of Todd and Blair's encounter and chastised Todd for causing more pain.  Marty suggested that Todd seek professional help.   In a serious tone, Todd asked Marty to evaluate his psychological state.  Referring to Todd as a narcissist, Marty reminded him that he would be forced to explain his past actions to their granddaughter one day.\n\n\nJohn was surprised to discover T\u00e9a at the gun range, firing shots at a target that displayed a photo of Todd's face.  Acknowledging that she was \"mad as hell,\" T\u00e9a insisted that she had gone to the range to blow off steam.  When John questioned what was bothering her, T\u00e9a inquired about John's relationship with Marty.  T\u00e9a wondered if John and Marty had experienced any difficulties as a result of Todd's interference in their lives.  Unable to obtain any information from John, T\u00e9a took pleasure in informing him that Todd and Blair had slept together.  John responded by firing several rounds at the target.    Staring at the bullet holes in the photo of Todd's face, John asked T\u00e9a if she felt better.  With great sadness, T\u00e9a stated that she didn't.  In a grim tone, John admitted that he didn't, either.\n\n\nBack on the patio at La Boulaie, Dorian advised Blair to never sleep with Todd again.  As she comforted her niece, Dorian remarked that she regretted that Blair and John were unable to salvage their marriage.  Filled with self-pity, Blair reminded Dorian that John was in love with Marty.  Later, Blair stood alone on the patio and stared down at the pair of shorts that Todd had left behind.  Turning around, Blair was startled to discover John watching her.\n\n\nInside the gym of Llanview High School, Matthew attempted to console Destiny about her brother, Greg, leaving town.  In an unconvincing tone, Destiny insisted that she didn't care about Greg leaving, because he didn't care about her.  Matthew reminded Destiny that Greg would have never considered leaving town had Matthew's parents agreed to allow Greg to perform the operation.\n\n\nDestiny stated that Shaun's accusations concerning their brother had been correct.  Near tears, Destiny admitted that Greg arrived in town only to perform Matthews surgery-Greg didn't care about his family.  Matthew pointed out that Greg appeared to love her, but Destiny disagreed.  Destiny apologized for unloading her problems on Matthew.  Acknowledging the many acts of kindness that Destiny had displayed toward him, Matthew told her that she was the best friend that he ever had.  Wanting to cheer Destiny up, Matthew offered to treat her to a burger at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, while Rachel waited for Shaun to join her, Greg appeared and took a seat.  Greg announced that he was leaving town because Matthew's parents had decided against Greg performing surgery on their son.  Agreeing with Nora and Bo's decision, Rachel cited that she wasn't willing to risk Matthew's life.  Greg tried to convince Rachel that he was capable of helping Matthew walk again, but Rachel insisted that Matthew wasn't Greg's priority-Greg's ego was.\n\n\nRemarking that Destiny idolized him, Rachel questioned why Greg would leave town in such a hurry.   Rachel was certain that Greg wasn't concerned about his family, and only cared about his image.  Insisting that he had patients who depended on him, Greg claimed that he truly loved his brother and sister.  When Rachel continued to state that family wasn't important to him, Greg became agitated and blurted out that Destiny shared Rachel's views of him.   As Shaun, Destiny, and Matthew approached the table, Greg exclaimed, \"I love my family, and that's why I'm remaining in town!\"\n\n\nPleased by her brother's decision, Destiny was delighted and began making plans for the family.  Noticing that Matthew had quietly exited the caf\u00e9, Destiny ran after him.  Outside of the Buenos Dias, Matthew mentioned that if he were of legal age, he would allow Greg to perform the surgery.  T\u00e9a approached the caf\u00e9 and greeted the teens.   Handing T\u00e9a a roll of bills, Destiny informed T\u00e9a that Matthew wanted to hire her to represent him.\n\n\nBack inside the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Rachel praised Greg for placing his family first.  When Shaun reminded his brother that they should take things slowly, Greg insisted on treating his family to dinner at the Palace Hotel.  Rachel thought the Evans family could benefit from an evening together.  Shaun reminded Rachel that they had plans for the evening.  Shaun appeared agitated when Greg asked Rachel to join them.\n\n\nInside a room at the storage facility, Rex grabbed the bag of blood from Stacy and informed her that he was aware of her evil plot against his family.  A shocked Stacy lied and tried to convince Rex that the bag contained her blood, but Rex continued to lash out at her.  Revealing that Shane hadn't relapsed, Rex admitted that he had pretended to care for Stacy in order to locate where she had hidden the bag of blood.  Insisting that Rex loved her, Stacy couldn't believe his claim that he had set a trap for her.\n\n\nAttacking Stacy's character, Rex referred to her as evil and shouted, \"I've never hated anyone as much as I hate you right now!\"  As Stacy continued to proclaim her love for him, Rex demanded to know why she had calculated such a devious scheme.  To Rex's horror, Stacy babbled that she loved Rex more than Gigi and Shane ever could.  Stacy announced that they were meant to be together.  Once Stacy began citing specific incidents that had taken place during their high school years, Rex realized that Stacy was mentally unstable.\n\n\nFed up with Stacy's antics, Rex reminded Stacy that she had placed his son's life in jeopardy.  As Stacy cried, a frustrated Rex declared, \"I have zero love for you.  Gigi is the only woman I love!\"  When Rex stated that he wanted nothing from her, Stacy went into a tailspin and snatched the bag of blood from Rex.  Glaring at Rex, Stacy replied, \"I guess you don't want this, either!\"  Fearing for Shane's life, Rex pleaded with Stacy to relinquish the bag.  With a crazed look, Stacy stated, \"Make love to me again!\"\n\n\n \n\n\n",
