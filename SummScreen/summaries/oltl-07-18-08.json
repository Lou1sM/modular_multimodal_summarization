While Dorian berated Viki, Viki continued to slowly pump the brakes to ensure that they were working properly. Dorian demanded that she quit fiddling with the brakes and just drive the car. Dorian appeared amused when Viki asked to discuss Charlie. Viki suggested that Dorian had some knowledge of Charlie's drunken episode. As the two women argued, Dorian said that she understood how it was to love a drunk, and blamed Viki for Mel's death. Recalling the fateful day that she switched seats with Mel on the airplane and accidentally intercepted the letter that was meant for him, Viki revealed that she also blamed herself. Viki believed that had she not gotten off the plane, Mel wouldn't have died in her seat. Dorian was filled with emotion and said that Mel should still be alive-not Viki. \n\n\nA determined Viki continued to inquire about Dorian's involvement with Charlie on the night he took a drink. When Viki insisted that Dorian had somehow caused Charlie to drink that night, Dorian laughed and denied the accusations. Viki demanded to know what Dorian had done to Charlie. Fed up with Viki's charges, Dorian said that she slept with Charlie. As a shocked Viki listened, Dorian said that she had found Charlie drinking in the park. According to Dorian, Charlie was distraught over the argument he had with Viki and turned to the bottle. Dorian comforted him and took him to her home. Dorian said that they shared a few drinks and gave in to their passion. Refusing to believe Dorian, Viki begged Dorian to tell the truth. A smug Dorian told Viki that she had sex with Charlie and that Viki only had herself to blame. Dorian said that Viki pushed Charlie into taking a drink because she wasn't supportive of him. As she recalled Charlie telling her that he had a memory of being in Dorian's bed, Viki was devastated. \n\n\nViki refused to believe that Charlie would sleep with Dorian, even in a drunken state. Dorian reminded Viki that she said the same thing about Joey and Clint, and stated that she had managed to lure them both. In a state of panic, Viki pleaded with Dorian to be truthful, but Dorian continued to lash out at her. As Viki took her eyes off the road and argued with Dorian, Dorian screamed for her to watch out. Viki attempted to brake, but couldn't. The women struck something in the road and both women were knocked unconscious. Dorian came to and called out to Viki. With blood streaming from her face, Viki appeared lifeless. Dorian checked her pulse and exclaimed, \"No Pulse! Viki's dead!\" \n\n\nAt the diner, Brody listened nervously as Gigi told Shane that she needed to tell him something about his father. Brody interrupted Gigi's near confession and told Shane that Gigi believed that he had a drinking problem. Shane argued that his mother was wrong about his dad, but Brody stated that he intended to seek help so that he wouldn't lose Shane, and left the diner. Shane reminded Gigi that his father was a good person and regretted missing out on the time he had lost with them. He cited all of Brody's good qualities and begged his mother not to take Brody out of his life. Feeling Shane's pain, Gigi stated that she didn't intend to remove Brody from Shane's life, but insisted that she only wanted him to be safe when he was with Brody. Shane asked Gigi if she would ever love his father and get over Rex. Gigi reminded her son that Rex was a married man, and mentioned that Rex had left town. When Shane asked when Rex would return, Gigi sadly stated that she had a feeling that he would be gone for awhile. \n\n\nAt the ranch, Bo reached for the metal fence and was struck by lightning. As Rex ran over to help, he was also struck. The men were knocked unconscious and fell to the ground. Chuck located Bo and Rex, but was unable to revive them. He ran off to find help. While the rain poured down on them, Rex called out Gigi's name and Bo reached over and placed his hand on Rex. Chuck returned with a rescue unit, and Bo and Rex were taken by ambulance to the hospital. As the men were carried away, Rex's cell phone was left behind. Charges of electricity could be seen flowing through the phone. \n\n\nAt his first Alcoholic Anonymous meeting, Charlie introduced himself and explained to the group that he had no idea how he had fallen off the wagon. When Charlie stated that someone forced him to drink, one of the group members criticized him and called him a liar. Refusing to believe he took a drink on his own, Charlie continued to argue his case. Charlie told the group that a true alcoholic always remembered that first drink-which he didn't. Charlie related that he had worked hard to keep a special woman in his life, and had no reason to ruin the relationship by drinking again. He told the group that he only remembered being in the company of someone who didn't want him to reveal the truth about his son, and was convinced that he was forced into taking a drink. Several group members agreed that they all remembered the circumstances that led up to their first drink, and considered the fact that Charlie's assumption might be correct. \n\n\nAs the group leader wished Charlie luck and prepared to adjourn the meeting, Brody entered the room. Brody told the group that he wasn't an alcoholic and only attended the meeting because his girlfriend suggested it. Charlie stared at Brody, but said nothing. Brody told the group that he was an Iraq veteran, and had a hard time returning to civilian life. Brody said that many of his friends had died during the war, and he had turned to the bottle as a way to cope. Brody stated that he was reunited with his ex-girlfriend and her child. He said that they had changed his life for the better and he was determined not to lose them. As Charlie listened, Brody revealed that the child wasn't his and that the biological father had no idea that he had fathered the child because he left town before his son was born. Charlie appeared suspicious. \n\n\nAt the Mendorran Palace, Carlo announced that Talia would marry Jonas and become the true Princess of Mendorra. Talia and Antonio were both adamant that there would be no wedding between Talia and Jonas. As Jonas smiled devilishly, Carlo stated that Talia was born to be a queen and would marry Jonas. Carlo informed Talia that if she didn't marry Jonas, Cris and Sarah would die, but Antonio would experience a slow and painful death. As Cris distracted the armed guards, Antonio grabbed Carlo by the neck and begged Talia to allow him to kill Carlo. Talia pleaded with Antonio to release her father, and Antonio did so. The guards returned with Cris, and Carlo ordered them to remove Antonio. As the guards led him away, Antonio promised Talia that he would return for her. An emotional Tina told Cain that they were to blame for everything. \n\n\nJonas snatched the jewels away from Tina and expressed his disgust with her. Jonas attempted to place the jewels around Talia's neck, but she screamed that she hated Carlo and would never marry Jonas. The guards carried her away. As Tina and Cain attempted to leave the palace, Carlo told them that they would be beheaded for treason. Sarah begged Carlo not to hurt her mother. Tina told Carlo that he could do as he pleased with her, but pleaded with him not to hurt Sarah. Carlo smiled and stated that he wouldn't hurt Sarah, but Cristian would. Cris demanded answers. Carlo announced that Cris would kill Sarah.\n\n\n",

Viki reveals that she believes that Charlie did not fall off the wagon and Dorian might have had something to do with what happened to him. Meanwhile, Charlie attends an AA meeting and tells the group that he has no clue how he wound up in the ER for alcohol poisoning and knows he had to no reason nor desire to choose to drink. At the same time, Gigi tells Brody she does not want him around her son until he clean up his act with drinking. Brody then attends the same AA meeting where Charlie is talking. While Viki and Dorian are in the car, the brakes fail (due to Tess) and they crash. Bo and Rex have both been injured at Asa's ranch while riding horses in the rain.",
