As the family marched into the living room singing \"Happy Birthday,\" they quickly realized that both Sam and Spider-Man were gone. Everyone quickly headed to a different room to search for the young boy and his party entertainer. When Blair let out a scream, all family members headed out to the backyard.\n\n\nBlair was standing with the real hired Spider-Man, sans costume. The young man revealed that he'd been jumped from behind. Blair quickly placed a call to John. Starr checked with the entertainment company and learned that the barely dressed man was indeed their employee.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face led Sam to the room at the Minute Man Motel. The man removed his Spider-Man mask, and a surprised Sam cried out, \"It's you.\" \"Happy Birthday, kid,\" the man proclaimed. \"You're Spider-Man?\" Sam asked. \"Sometimes,\" the man replied. \"Wow! Why did you bring me here?\" Sam inquired. The man informed the boy that it was Spider-Man's hideout, and the man had to hide there from his archenemy.\n\n\n\"Green Goblin?\" Sam asked. \"Are you lying to me?\" The man advised the boy that he would never lie, and someone was after him. Sam was certain that his mother would worry, but the man explained that he knew Sam's mother, and he was certain that Blair would want the man to protect her son. The man added that he was after the Green Goblin who had actually been at Sam's party and wearing a disguise to change his face.\n\n\nThe man put the Spider-Man mask on Sam's face and apologized for involving the boy in the middle of things. The man noted that the Green Goblin was a master of disguises. Sam was full of questions, and the man answered as only Spider-Man would. Soon, Sam was jumping on the bed, and the pair played Spider-Man and Green Goblin to while away the time.\n\n\nFinally, the man announced that he had to grab their enemy, and he wouldn't be able to take Sam along. The man was adamant that it was wrong for someone to live another person's life.\n\n\nDeanna and Nate began the filming of Rick's x-rated film, but they were interrupted when there was a knock at the door. Rick quickly stepped outside and found Dani, who wanted to know if Nate might be inside the room. Nate was her boyfriend, and she'd been searching for him, Dani added. Rick thought that it wasn't a very good sign if Dani were looking for her boyfriend at a motel, and he assured her that Nate wasn't there.\n\n\nRick stated that he was having his own party, and he invited Dani inside. Dani quickly declined. \"Ewwww,\" she groaned as she hurriedly walked away. She thought that she should try another room.\n\n\nDeanna and Nate again discussed the logic of their shooting the porno film, and they both agreed that it was necessary for each of them to continue with it. Deanna wanted the file on her mother that the \"sleaze\" had in his possession. Rick returned to the room. \"Hot chick, wrong room,\" he announced to his film stars. Rick thought that they should get back to filming.\n\n\n\"Okay, we're gonna shoot the bed scene first. Make it hot,\" Rick ordered Nate and Deanna. The scantily clad couple began to kiss, and they fell to the bed. When the scene was finished, Rick and his cameraman viewed the film. The young couple sat back to back with their feet on the floor on opposite sides of the bed. Rick muttered how it was always the quiet ones, and while the scene had started out \"lame,\" it had eventually \"sizzled.\" Rick began to taunt Deanna about being turned on, and Nate jumped up and grabbed Rick's collar tightly.\n\n\nNate wanted Rick to shut up and hold up his end of the bargain. Rick ordered Nate to let go and offered to retrieve the file on Deanna's mother. Rick handed over the information and advised Deanna that the file contained everything she wanted to know. He also promised not to tell anyone anything about Nate injuring Matthew. Rick praised the couple for \"going the distance.\"\n\n\nJohn and Natalie sat in John's office and tried to figure out the connection between Todd, Tomas, and the unknown dead man found at La Boulaie. They also contemplated how Sam was involved with his new friend, and the encrypted files that John had on Tomas, the man with Todd's original face, and the dead man.\n\n\nConversation was suspended when another cop walked in with a piece of evidence found at the landing strip where Marty had last been seen. John looked at the uniform jacket with a logo, and he noted that the files he had on his desk contained the same logo on them. Just then, he received a phone call. It was Blair, calling to tell him about Sam's disappearance. He and Natalie headed to the Manning residence.\n\n\nVimal walked into Todd's office at the Sun and laid a file on his boss's desk. He picked up the framed photograph of Todd's family and turned when he heard the office door open. He was surprised to see Rama, who wanted to congratulate her husband on his new job. Vimal assumed that she'd either heard about his new paycheck or had other questionable motives behind her best wishes. Rama insisted that she was really happy for Vimal, and Todd had done himself a favor when he'd hired Vimal.\n\n\nVimal assured Rama that Todd had had no choice when he'd placed Vimal in the new position. Rama continued to sing Vimal's praises, but Vimal reminded her that he had a criminal record, and no one would ever hire him. This piqued Rama's interest, and she wondered why Todd would have hired Vimal if that were the case.\n\n\nVimal ordered Rama to depart instead, and he added that he would never confide in her again. The last time he'd done so, he'd gotten into trouble, Vimal stated. He had a good job, and his parents would be impressed. He would wait for them to see that everything was okay before he told them that Rama wasn't pregnant. He added that he couldn't even tell the truth to the person who deserved it.\n\n\nRama wanted him to provide more details, and she promised not to betray Vimal again. Vimal ordered her to leave again, because Todd didn't like strangers in his office. Rama insisted they weren't strangers, but Vimal believed otherwise. Rama could tell that something was bothering Vimal. \"Fix what's wrong,\" she urged him. Vimal agreed that she was correct, and he would take care of it. After Rama had gone, Vimal declared, \"She's right. I must fix it. Todd Manning be damned!\"\n\n\nDestiny ran into Nora in front of the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, and Nora promptly noticed that Destiny seemed out of sorts. Destiny assured her that she had only been thinking about Matthew, but Nora declared that she'd visited Matthew in the hospital, and he was doing well. Nora was certain that Matthew had been aware of what Nora had said, and he had even laughed at one of her jokes.\n\n\nNora explained that Matthew appeared to be in a good place, but it would take time for him to get better. Destiny wondered how long that would be, but Nora was unable to supply an answer. The women headed inside the diner, and Nora announced that she thought she had a lead on the person who had injured her son. Nora had retraced Matthew's steps from the day he'd been hurt, and she'd found possible evidence. She pulled the bagged gum wrapper out of her purse.\n\n\nDestiny wasn't familiar with the brand, and she told Nora that she didn't chew it. Destiny promised she would be on the lookout for someone who might favor the gum. Nora shared the fact that the new lead would keep her going, because her mind was always dwelling on Matthew. She only wanted her son to have a great life, and Destiny would understand a mother's love one day. Destiny made it known that she had something to tell Nora.\n\n\nJohn and Natalie arrived at Todd's house, and John proceeded to interview all of the family members. John revealed that he would put out an Amber Alert. Baz confessed that he'd heard the Spider-Man speak, but it was only after Todd had requested the man shoot a family photo. \"My pleasure,\" the man dressed as Spider-Man had said.\n\n\nWhile Spider-Man and Sam played in the motel room, the man mentioned that he'd grabbed all of Sam's birthday presents on the way out of the house. He suggested that Sam open one of them. Sam picked one up and announced that it was probably a book from Dani. Suddenly, there was a loud knock on the door. It was Dani, still looking for Nate, and she put her ear to the door.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face advised Sam to be quiet, and the man picked up his gun. By the time the man managed to open the door and peer out, Dani was gone. The man returned to the room and handed Sam another gift to open. It was a \"web shooter\" from Sam's dad. \"My dad's the best,\" Sam declared. The man thought it was time to call Todd and say that he had Sam.\n\n\nJohn declared that it wasn't a coincidence; he was certain that Sam's disappearance was related to the murder at La Boulaie. Everyone pressed Blair for information, and Todd walked away from the group. His phone began to ring. \"Who is this?\" Todd inquired. \"Spider-Man. I have your son,\" the man with Todd's original face stated.\n\n\nBlair told everyone about the homeless man at La Boulaie who had shot someone. The man on the phone advised Todd that they would meet somewhere alone. The man didn't want to see any guns, police, or other people with Todd.\n\n\nJohn explained that Sam had revealed that the unknown man at La Boulaie had shot someone to protect Sam, and Blair assured her family members that Sam had seemed fine about it. John and Blair mentioned the old photo of Todd and the fact that Sam had maintained that it was the same face as his friend. John realized that Todd was no longer with the group, and T\u00e9a went to search for her husband.\n\n\nT\u00e9a found Todd on the phone, and she asked if the call might be about Sam. Todd claimed that he didn't trust John and the Llanview police, and he'd made arrangements with his own investigators to search for Sam. Todd was going to look for his son on his own, and he wanted T\u00e9a to remain behind with Blair and the others in case they received a phone call.\n\n\nThe family gathered once again and tried to piece together what they'd heard about Sam and his friend who might look like the old Todd. Tomas remained quiet and lost in thought, and Baz watched his father closely. When Blair lost her composure, Tomas was the first one to comfort her. T\u00e9a confirmed that Todd had gone on his own search for Sam, and he had promised to return with the little boy. Baz reassured a distressed Starr.\n\n\nJohn and Natalie headed outside, and Natalie confirmed that she had a partial footprint. John hoped that the kidnapping suspect had taken Spider-Man's uniform, but had forgotten to change his shoes. John thought that the man who had taken Sam resembled Todd, but Natalie shook her head. She was certain that it couldn't be Todd, and there couldn't be two Todd Mannings.\n\n\nDestiny explained to Nora how she and Matthew had grown close, but before Destiny could utter another word, Dani rushed inside and over to the table. Breathlessly, Dani politely asked Nora about Matthew's condition and offered to help in any way that she could. Nora wanted to show Dani the gum wrapper, but Nora looked at her watch and shrieked. She was late for a meeting, and it would have to wait.\n\n\nNora inquired what Destiny had wanted to tell her, but Destiny only promised that Matthew would have his full life and family one day. Nora left in a hurry. Dani announced that she hadn't been able to locate Nate at the motel. She had only run into a \"skeevy\" guy there. \"That's a relief,\" Destiny sighed.\n\n\nDani noted that she'd also heard a little kid in one of the rooms who had sounded just like Sam, but of course, it couldn't have been her brother. Dani was still angry. Even if Nate hadn't been \"hooking up,\" he had still lied about his whereabouts. She wondered where he could be and why he had been so secretive.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face was dressed in his own clothes. He advised Sam they were his disguise. He wanted Sam to remain in the motel room to guard their hideout, and he wanted Sam's promise that he wouldn't go out. He also didn't want Sam to use the phone, because it would be dangerous for Sam's family.\n\n\nThe man handed the little boy the Spider-Man mask to wear for protection. The man vowed that he was the good guy, and he would win. \"Hurry back Spider-Man,\" Sam called out as the man left the room. Sam played with his toys after the man had gone.\n\n\nLater, Rick viewed his film and declared it to be \"smokin' hot.\" Deanna went through the file and was happy to find an address and telephone number for her mother in California. She thought it had been worth it. Nate agreed that he was okay as long as Dani didn't find out.\n\n\nVimal arrived at the police station and walked into John's office. He called out for John, but the detective wasn't there. Vimal spied a tablet of paper and decided to leave John a note. The message stated, \" You are Liam's father, not Brody Lovett. Marty Saybrooke altered the test results. Believe me. I know.\" He recalled Todd's threat and signed it \"Anonymous.\" He left the note on John's desk and scurried away.\n\n\nTodd reached the newspaper and walked into his office. He was face-to-face with the man with Todd's original face, who sat behind the desk. They stared at each other silently.\n\n\n",
