She was sure that Evangeline had no will, and asserted that she would be the one to make a decision about her daughter. When Layla wondered what Evangeline would truly want, her mother threatened to have Layla barred from seeing Evangeline. Layla's mother said that the negativity wasn't good for Evangeline and left to get some of Evangeline's things from home.\n\n\nLayla was frustrated that every conversation with her mother turned into an argument, but Cristian assured her that her mother was only scared to lose her daughter. Layla thought she would have better luck talking to her mother at home, but didn't want Cristian with her. He understood that him being there would probably make it worse and wished her luck as she left.\n\n\nCristian entered Evangeline's room and sat down at her bedside. He didn't know what to do because he didn't like seeing her that way. He wished that she would get better, or at least that he knew whether or not she wanted to stay on the machines. Becoming upset, Cristian wanted Evangeline to know that he had never stopped loving her.\n\n\nAt the Williamson household, Layla entered the house to find her mother lighting a fire in the fireplace. As Mrs. Williamson covered a pile of papers sitting next to her, she wondered why Layla wasn't with her sister. Layla and her mother both tugged at the papers until Layla finally succeeded in taking them away. Wondering what her mother didn't want her to see, she looked at the paper on top, which was entitled \"The Living Will of Evangeline Williamson.\"\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston walked in on Dorian and Charlie sharing a kiss. After Langston dropping her keys, the couple stopped, and Langston was embarrassed. Dorian wanted to explain, but Langston didn't need an explanation because she felt that she had no room to judge anyone after what she did to Markko. In order to give Dorian and Langston privacy, Charlie exited to the terrace. Dorian wondered if Langston had heard from Markko. Langston informed her mother that she and Markko had a long talk and figured out that they didn't belong together because too much had happened.\n\n\nLangston filled Dorian in on the fact that Markko was moving to California to go to UCLA. She wanted him to be happy and successful because he deserved it. \"Stop him,\" replied Dorian. Langston thought Dorian was a hypocrite for telling her to stop Markko, but Dorian had never stopped David from leaving. Dorian thought her and David's relationship was unrelated, the difference being that Langston and Markko were meant to be together. Langston told her mother to concentrate on her own love life and walked out.\n\n\nCharlie reentered and began to kiss Dorian again, but Dorian promptly stopped him. Charlie apologized if Dorian was uncomfortable, but reminded her that she was the one that wanted to explore the attraction. She reasoned that Langston reminded her that emotions could sometimes confuse feelings. Charlie thought that Dorian always knew what she wanted, but Dorian admitted to being dishonest. Charlie confronted her about her feelings for David, but Dorian held back with Charlie because of Viki.\n\n\nDorian thought that Charlie was confusing the intimacy of their previous bond -- their pact to kill Mitch -- with \"intimacy of another kind.\" However, Charlie knew that he hadn't been confusing the signals Dorian sent to him. She claimed to be merely flirting and was appalled that Charlie would want to cheat on his wife. As Charlie informed her that it took two to tango, Dorian stomped on Charlie's foot, and yelled about how Viki deserved better.\n\n\nCharlie dared her to admit that she still had feelings for David, to no avail. Charlie wondered when Dorian had started to care about Viki, to which Dorian replied that she knew they had differences, but she wouldn't allow Viki to be made a fool. Dorian scowled at Charlie and headed for Llanfair.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica and Natalie walked in on David and Viki sharing a kiss. The stunned sisters wanted to know what was going on. Viki eventually stammered that it was a long story, but David covered. He said that Viki was helping him rehearse for a callback for a European movie, which was also why there were tiny bathing suits littering the living room. Unbelieving, the twins warned their mother not to eat any of David's poisoned muffins.\n\n\nDavid stuck with his claim that Noelle had made them, but the girls had done their research and found that David had made them. Viki told them to go to a doctor, so they left. Wanting to pick up where they left off, Viki assured David that the girls wouldn't bother them again. Viki made a move to kiss him, but David stopped her and said that he couldn't.\n\n\nDavid admitted that he couldn't go through with things because of his feelings for Viki. David confessed that he was thinking about their friendship and he didn't want to ruin her marriage. Viki urged him to admit who was really in his heart. He wondered why it was so hard to believe that he had chosen to respect her marriage. Viki's phone rang. On the other end, Charlie explained that he did everything possible to reel Dorian in, but she was on her way over to Llanfair to tattle on Charlie. Wanting to convince David that her marriage was on the rocks, she pleaded with a confused Charlie to give her another chance. Viki hung up the phone and informed David that Charlie was leaving her because he thought he belonged with Dorian at La Boulaie.\n\n\nIn the foyer of Llanfair, Jessica and Natalie agreed that they didn't believe David's story about the audition, but they didn't want to think about the alternative. After getting off the phone with their doctor, Jessica informed Natalie that he didn't have hours until the next day. Not wanting to spread their sickness to their loved ones, the twins decided to go to the hospital to get checked out. They left the house with the muffins to get them tested for some kind of poison.\n\n\nViki cried that no one wanted her, but since Charlie was \"out of the picture,\" David led Viki towards her bedroom. Before going up the stairs, Viki, actually unlocking the front doors, told David that she was locking the doors so no one would interrupt. Up in Viki's bedroom, she looked very uncomfortable as David aimed terms of endearment at her. As David undressed completely, Viki attempted to stall by suggesting that she get changed first. Changing into a robe, the two got into Viki's bed.\n\n\nDownstairs, Dorian entered the house, looked around, and called Viki's name. She headed upstairs as Charlie bolted in, looking around and calling Viki's name. Charlie noticed David's skimpy bathing suits on the floor and headed for the stairs. Dorian knocked on Viki's bedroom door and yelled that she had to talk to her about Charlie. As she was saying that Charlie had tried to get her into bed, Dorian walked into the room and saw Viki and David in bed.\n\n\nStarr admitted to Cole that she had gone to see James in the hospital again. Cole asked when James was being released, but Starr said that it didn't matter because she wasn't going to see him anymore. Starr explained to a confused Cole that there was no point in seeing James anymore because his condition had improved. Starr started rambling, but Cole stopped her, and asked if she was okay. Seeing a way out of answering, Starr saw Markko walk by and stopped him. Markko questioned Starr and Cole about how they were doing, and they gave their friend a brief overview on all that had happened with Hannah and James. Markko asked if they were back together.\n\n\nThe couple informed Markko that they had never broken up. Markko reasoned that the last time he saw Cole was in jail, and Cole had just told Starr not to visit anymore. Markko wanted to know everything that had happened since then. Cole updated Markko on what had happened with Hannah. Starr was just happy that they were together again, and with Hope. Cole told Markko that he should move back into the apartment because Langston had moved back in with Dorian. Markko couldn't, and it had nothing to do with Langston. He was leaving for California, \"for good.\"\n\n\nStarr asked if Langston knew. Markko explained that they had talked and couldn't work it out. Starr reminded him how badly Langston regretted what had happened, and that they could get past it. Markko told Starr that there was a possibility of forgiveness, but he could never forget what Langston had done. Markko related that he had always wanted his and Langston's relationship to be destined like Starr and Cole's, but it wasn't. Starr couldn't believe that he could go to California and leave Langston in Llanview, but Markko shot back that Langston had left him every time she was with Ford.\n\n\nCole reassured Starr that he didn't want Markko to leave, either, but it was a great opportunity to start his career, and they would still be friends. Cole wanted Starr to be happy for Markko instead of making things harder. Starr apologized and, just as Langston entered, reasoned that she knew Langston loved Markko and always would.\n\n\nLangston hid as Markko said that Karen -- who was going to California to become an actress -- was waiting for him. Starr walked up to Markko and handed him a muffin with a lit candle. Cole told him to remember them when he was a \"hotshot director,\" and Markko assured them that he would never have friends like them. Starr, Cole, Markko, and Langston all remembered happier times of the four of them having fun. Markko blew out his candle and hugged Starr and Cole as Langston cried.\n\n\nCole offered to walk Markko to the car, and Starr went the opposite way, bumping into Langston. Starr told her friend that she had just missed Markko, but Langston informed Starr that they had said their goodbyes earlier. Starr asked if she was okay, and Langston replied that she knew she had to let Markko go. Understanding, Starr hugged her friend.\n\n\n",
