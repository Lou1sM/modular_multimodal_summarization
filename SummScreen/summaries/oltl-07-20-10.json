    "soap_central": "\n\nDorian arrived at Llanfair and searched for Viki. \"It's about your Charlie. He tried to get me into bed,\" she called out. Dorian was shocked beyond belief when she walked into Viki's bedroom at Llanfair and saw David and Viki in bed together. \"Coitus interruptus can be brutal,\" David opined as he got out of bed to get rid of his ex. Lacking success, he turned around and headed back to bed to kiss Viki, who scolded him to \"lay off.\" Dorian whined that she had shown up to do a good deed. \"Viki, how could you?\" she asked. David assured her that it was obvious he would be in bed with Viki after they heard about Dorian and Charlie doing the same.\n\n\nCharlie showed up shortly after Dorian, and Dorian urged him to tell the truth. Dorian stressed that she would never interfere in Viki's marriage. Before Charlie could speak, Viki cut in and admitted that Charlie hadn't left Viki and he hadn't really planned on getting it on with Dorian. Viki confessed that she had made the whole thing up.\n\n\nDavid jumped out of bed to get dressed as Viki revealed the scheme. She tried to explain that Charlie and Dorian were not together and, as for herself, she did not have any interest in David. Dorian and David were doubtful as Charlie and Viki took turns in giving details of their elaborate plan. They insisted there was no \"Charlian\" and no \"Diki.\" She and Charlie pretended to have feelings for the others because David and Dorian belonged together and were madly in love with each other. Viki wanted them to admit it. She wanted them to kiss and make up.\n\n\nDavid and Dorian refused, and David expressed how humiliated he felt. They appeared uneasy but clearly unhappy in being the victims of Charlie and Viki's plot. David felt that Viki had been playing with his emotions. Viki believed that she and Charlie were justified in helping David and Dorian see the light, but the pair disagreed that they loved each other. Dorian made it clear that she loathed David, and he seconded her assessment. Dorian was sure they would be together if they wanted to be.\n\n\nCharlie suggested that he and Viki leave them alone to talk, but Dorian stopped them with her appraisal of Viki. She accused Viki of stooping to Todd's level with her plot, and she charged Charlie with being disloyal and dishonest. In a surprising turn of events, she fired Charlie. He cited his contract, but Dorian called attention to the morals clause. She had no problems with dragging Charlie and Viki through the mud and testing the \"court of public opinion.\" Viki regretfully agreed that things could be bad. After Dorian left and David headed to his own room, Charlie asked Viki if she had a \"Plan B.\"\n\n\nWith an arm around her friend, Starr comforted Langston who couldn't believe that Markko was leaving Llanview. As they stopped to talk at Angel Square Park, Langston wanted to catch up on Starr's life instead. \"What the hell have you been up to anyway?\" Langston asked Starr. \"Target practice,\" Ford stated as he walked up to the two young women. He thought that Langston should hear about how Starr had shot his brother.\n\n\nStarr accused Ford of stalking Langston but he insisted he wouldn't do that, especially since Langston didn't want him. She was free to go back to Markko, he added. Instead, Langston informed him that Markko was headed to UCLA. Ford was surprisingly happy to hear the news, not because he'd have a chance at Langston, he informed the girls. The film school at the college was great and Markko was lucky, he pointed out. Ford had been rejected from that very same school, he told them.\n\n\nSarcastically, Starr retorted that she wished Llanview University had rejected him as well. Ford shook his head and related that he couldn't understand how his brother was able to put up with Starr for so long. Langston was astonished to hear that Ford had a brother, and Ford revealed that Starr had put a hole in him. Starr asked Ford to go away and he consented, hopeful that Starr wouldn't shoot him in the back. Ford expressed his sorrow to Langston that Markko was leaving.\n\n\nLangston wanted the dirt on Ford's brother, and Starr acquiesced, explaining that James was very different from Ford and a \"good guy.\" Langston failed to see how someone who had carjacked Starr, forced her on the run, and been shot, could be any different from Ford. Indignantly, Starr informed her friend that James had looked after her. Langston was confused and wondered about Cole's reaction to the entire scenario. Starr advised her friend that she and Cole hadn't been on great terms even before the incident.\n\n\nLangston appeared suspicious, but Starr quickly assured her there was nothing between herself and James. Langston admitted that she would understand if Starr didn't tell her everything after all they had been through recently. Starr assured her that they were still best friends, and they would never let guys get between them. They gave each other a hug as Ford watched from behind some bushes.\n\n\nRex showed up at La Boulaie with news for Kelly. He was sure he had the information that would lead to her mother's killer. Eli, who had just completed a phone call in another room, overheard Rex and stopped to listen before heading to the study. Rex and Kelly were surprised to find him there, and Kelly expressed her joy at Eli's upcoming nuptials. After some small talk, Eli offered Kelly some free legal counsel as Kelly explained she had hired Rex to help in the search for her mother's killer.\n\n\nShe told him they were looking for someone named Bennett Thompson, though Rex clarified that Bennett Thompson was merely a \"person of interest\" at that point in the investigation. Eli was curious to know how Kelly had the name of this man and was stunned when she replied that her mother had told her. Eli pushed for further information, and Kelly explained that she had found Thompson's name on a slip of paper in the vase her mother had made that was subsequently broken.\n\n\nEli's face darkened and he wondered how far Rex had gotten in his investigation. Rex replied he had listed all of the men with the same name who resided all over the country. Kelly asked Eli if he had any ideas, and Eli's response was to tell her to \"let it go,\" and not pursue the investigation any further. Kelly asked Rex to allow her to speak to Eli privately, and Rex left the room. Kelly told Eli that dropping the matter was not an option and, among others, she thought that Rodney was a connection to the case.\n\n\nEli reminded her that Rodney had died of natural causes, and previous experience told him that cases like hers never ended well for the people in pursuit of the truth. They had nothing to show except \"desperation and sadness,\" he concluded. Kelly knew that Rodney had to be a lead, and she vowed to keep going and make the murderer pay. Eli promised to do his best to keep Kelly safe.\n\n\nRex returned and mentioned that their best bet was to connect Melinda and the murderer to Rodney. Kelly mentioned that Rodney had a baseball card of Boston player Carl Yastrzemski in his possession, and Rex revealed that Rodney had originally been from Boston. There were three Bennett Thompsons listed in the Boston area, and one was a lawyer, another a teacher, and the last was in marketing. Eli appeared angry with the revelation.\n\n\nCristian cried as he held Evangeline's hand in her hospital room in Maryland. He told her that he still loved her and he always would. He wanted her to remain in his life, and he wished he could do something to stop her sister and mother from arguing. He confessed that he had fallen in love with Layla even though he hadn't meant to because he always thought that Evangeline would be the one. He was moving forward, and he wanted her to return. He and Layla didn't want to leave Evangeline behind, but he felt powerless towards both of the women in what needed to be done for each of them.\n\n\nHe cried that he knew that Layla felt guilty about being with Cristian, but he felt guilty too. He really wanted Evangeline's approval, but he knew he wouldn't get it.\n\n\nAt the Williamson house, Layla accused her mother of lying after she grabbed Evangeline's Living Will from her mother's hands. Layla accused her of violating Evangeline's wishes, but Mrs. Williamson snarled that she would run her house as she saw fit. She accused her daughter of not being there for Evangeline while she was the one who did all she could to keep Evangeline alive. \"Where were you?\" she yelled at Layla.\n\n\nLayla began to cry as she tried to make her mother see that Evangeline didn't want to use life-sustaining treatment like feeding tubes and machines. It was all there in black and white -- Evangeline wanted them to let her go. Mrs. Williamson shouted that wasn't the whole story. She called attention to the fact that the will wasn't dated or notarized. Layla called it a technicality, but her mother screamed that it was only a clue to what Evangeline might have been thinking about. She wasn't planning on putting her daughter to death. \"What if she's already gone?\" Layla asked her.\n\n\nLayla acknowledged that her mother loved Evangeline more than anything, but her sister was already slipping away. She wasn't able to live without the machines and, even without the document, Evangeline would only be living half a life. Mrs. Williamson felt that life was better than none. Layla wondered for whom and stated they had to do what Evangeline wanted. Her mother disagreed, feeling that Evangeline needed her help and the paper was useless. Sarcastically, she urged Layla to use it to kill her sister. She could try to use the papers or they could work together and tear it up, Mrs. Williamson added. She sneered that Evangeline's blood would be on Layla's hands.\n\n\nAfter Layla was gone, Mrs. Williamson looked through Evangeline's belongings and a photo of Layla and Evangeline together. A card fell out of one of the papers and she looked at it curiously. She made a phone call, and Eli answered the phone. She asked to speak to Bennett Thompson. The business card stated that he was an attorney.\n\n\nLayla returned to the hospital and handed the will to Cristian. She advised him that her mother hadn't planned to use it and instead had been ready to burn it until Layla caught her. She had to virtually rip the will from her mother's hands, and her mother was blaming her for wanting to kill Evangeline. Her mother had made it clear that there had been no witness or official filing of the living will. Cristian wondered if Evangeline would really want to follow the language of the will. Layla though she would, and Cristian suggested they call a lawyer.\n\n\nJessica and Natalie sat close to each other in the emergency room waiting area. They were tired of killing time as they waited for someone to see them. They were dizzy and sick, and Natalie thought she should call Viki to intercede for them. Jessica thought otherwise, since she was concerned they could be contagious. Their mother couldn't be near them if that were the case, she advised her sister. \n\n\nAfter an interminable wait, Greg appeared to speak to them. He announced that he would accompany Jessica for an examination and Natalie would see one of his colleagues. Natalie handed him the container of muffins and demanded they be tested for poisonous materials. The girls were taken to separate rooms.\n\n\nThe doctors performed the examinations and heard both of the girls talk about their symptoms. They had headaches, they had cramps, they were hungry, and they were vomiting. Greg noted that Jessica had mood swings. Both doctors arranged for further testing, but when they met in the hallway, they agreed they both knew what the diagnosis would be.\n\n\nAs Jessica and Natalie lay in beds in their different rooms, they spoke to each other on the phone. Natalie's doctor returned, munching on one of the forbidden muffins. Greg returned to Jessica and assured her the muffins were delicious. \"Kudos to the chef,\" he told her. Both doctors promised that the muffins had been tested okay and the girls were not sick from those. Anxiously, the girls awaited the bad news. \"You're pregnant,\" each of the doctors advised his patient.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Layla catches her mother ready to burn Evangeline's will that clearly directs that Evangeline does not want to be kept alive by any artificial means. But her mother tells her that she still cannot be certain what her daughter would want. She and Cristian are still torn without being able to ask Evangeline. Meanwhile, having no suspicion about Eli, Kelly congratulates him on his engagement to her cousin and asks for his legal help in finding her mother's killer. He tries to talk her out of going through with it. But she is ready to proceed and asks him to help her. Meanwhile, Mrs. Williamson (Layla's mom) calls Eli and appears to be looking for Bennett Thompson (the person whom Kelly believes killed her mom). Viki and Charlie confess to David and Dorian that Viki was faking coming on to David and Charlie faking with Dorian. And the reason they did that was to get Dorian and David out of their lives and admitting that they are in love with each other (Dorian and David). Langston is surprised when she finds out that Starr was on the run and got to know Ford's brother. Natalie and Jessica go to the hospital and get tests run to find out why they are both sick when they assume they've gotten food poisoning from David's muffins. The doctors conclude that the reason they are sick is that they are both pregnant.",
