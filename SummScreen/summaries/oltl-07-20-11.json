He questioned if all the work to help Clint recover would be worth it, since Clint would probably go to Statesville anyway. Kelly reassured Joey, who appreciated the gesture. Joey wondered what he would do without Kelly, but she told him that he wouldn't have to find out.\n\n\nJoey had a gift for Kelly that he'd found at the hospital gift shop's Christmas in July sale. She was delighted to unwrap an identical copy of the clown ornament Aubrey had broken. Joey asked how long he'd been with Kelly, because he wanted to get back to see Clint before visiting hours were over. He realized that he wouldn't make it, so Kelly suggested that he stay. He agreed, and kissed her passionately.\n\n\nJohn examined Sam's toys in the motel room. He noticed a trail of Sam's web shooter string that led out the door. Along with another officer, he followed the trail to another room. He stood and listened outside the door.\n\n\nSam helped Dorian get the tape off of her. Echo began to badmouth Dorian, so Sam shot webs at Echo's mouth, muffling her words. Dorian thanked Sam, but wondered why he was at the motel. Sam explained to his confused aunt that Spider-Man had hidden Sam there. As Echo struggled in her bindings, Dorian said that she was going to call the police. Before dialing, Dorian made Sam pose with Echo, and took pictures with her camera phone.\n\n\nJohn entered the room, and asked what had happened. Dorian informed him that Sam had rescued her from Echo, who had kidnapped her, and conspired to kill her. John wondered where Spider-Man was, and Sam answered that Spider-Man was out \"fighting the Green Goblin.\" John wanted to know who Spider-Man was, because he had to make sure that the Spider-Man that was Sam's friend wasn't an imposter.\n\n\nAs Dorian and Echo started arguing heavily, John wanted to take Sam home. He instructed the officer to read Echo her rights, and to get statements. John would meet him back at the police station. John asked Sam again who was wearing the mask. \"The man with the line on his face,\" Sam answered matter-of-factly.\n\n\nJack apologized to Blair for saying that Sam wasn't her son, and assured her that Sam would be all right. Dani reminded Blair that she'd heard Sam's voice at the motel. Blair wondered why she hadn't gotten a call yet, but T\u00e9a assured her that Sam was fine.\n\n\nBaz pondered with Starr what Tomas was worried about -- Sam being safe, or John figuring out Tomas' secret. Baz glared at Tomas, who wondered what he'd done to deserve the stare. Baz was surprised that Tomas wasn't out looking for Sam. Tomas related that he wanted to stay with Blair and T\u00e9a. Baz mentioned all of Tomas' \"training,\" but Tomas thought his musical skills wouldn't be needed. Baz clarified that he meant the training that had made him a person of interest with the CIA. Tomas maintained that he had no idea why there was an encrypted file on him.\n\n\nT\u00e9a walked outside with Dani, and applauded her for making Blair feel better. However, she wondered why Dani had been at the motel. Dani admitted that she'd heard that Nate had been there with Deanna. However, she didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\nBlair walked toward the door, explaining to Starr that she needed some air. Blair was worried because it was getting late. Jack suggested that John had messed something up. Blair related that John was at least doing something to help. She wondered if it had ever occurred to Jack that the man who'd knocked him out was the same person who'd kidnapped Sam. She suggested that Sam might not have gotten kidnapped if Jack and Todd hadn't have kept the incident a secret.\n\n\nDavid looked for a pen and paper to write John a note about Dorian. He grabbed Vimal's note off the desk to write his note on. David started to read the note out loud, but Viki snatched it out of his hands and told him that the note was private. Natalie entered the office, and Viki asked her about Sam. David yelled that the police force was focusing on the Amber Alert rather than finding the missing mayor. He wanted John on the case. Natalie explained that John had a lead on the kidnapping, so he could soon turn his attention to other cases.\n\n\nNatalie explained about the kidnapping to Viki. She added that John had a theory that the kidnapping was connected to the body that had been found at La Boulaie. A horrified Viki sputtered out many questions, but Natalie couldn't give details. However, she assured Viki that she and John believed that the kidnapper had no intention to hurt Sam.\n\n\nViki offered to print a picture of the kidnapper in the Banner, but Natalie tried to explain the impossibility of who the clues seemed to lead them to. A confused David ranted about how his wife was missing, but no one was lifting a finger to help. He wanted to go find her, so he opened the door. Standing in the doorway was Dorian. He fell to his knees and hugged her, much to Echo's disgust. David made sure that Dorian was all right, and kissed her, as Viki smirked at Echo.\n\n\nDorian explained Echo's plot to break her and David up, and Viki was horrified. David was glad that \"that witch with a 'B'\" had confessed. Dorian continued that her savior had appeared. When everyone present guessed wrong, Dorian revealed that Sam had saved her. Viki was glad that both Dorian and Sam were safe.\n\n\nDorian apologized for doubting David. She begged for him to take her back, as Echo rolled her eyes in the background. \"Does this answer your question?\" he asked, and kissed her passionately. She suggested that they go home, so the two turned to leave. Echo yelled that she wasn't yet done with Dorian or Viki. The officer led Echo away.\n\n\nA short while later, Natalie got off the phone with John. The kidnapper hadn't been found, but Sam was all right. Viki wondered who the kidnapper was. Natalie pulled out an old photo of Todd, and showed it to her confused mother. She explained that Sam had identified his kidnapper as someone who looked like the old Todd. Viki thought it made no sense, and was shocked that someone with Todd's old face seemed to be stalking Todd's children.\n\n\nDavid and Dorian arrived at La Boulaie, and decided to take things into the bedroom.\n\n\nIn front of Todd's house, the man with Todd's original face demanded that Todd open the door. Todd wondered if the man was going to hurt Todd's family. The man pointed his gun at Todd, and threatened to shoot if Todd didn't open the door. \"Freeze!\" someone yelled behind the men. The man turned around to see Agent Baker. He told the man to put the gun down, because the chase was finally over. If the man didn't cooperate, Baker threatened that the people inside Todd's house that the man had claimed to care for would \"suffer the consequences.\"\n\n\nTodd said that if anyone hurt his family, he would kill both Agent Baker and the man. The man informed Todd that one of Baker's agents had tried to kill Sam, but the man had taken care of the situation. Baker promised to \"order the immediate execution\" of everyone inside Todd's house if the man didn't willingly go with Baker. Todd begged the man to listen so Todd's family wouldn't suffer. The man grabbed Todd at gunpoint. He accused Todd of stealing his life, and vowed to take it back. Baker told the man that he couldn't take what hadn't been his in the first place.\n\n\nAgent Baker told the man that he was confused because of posttraumatic stress he had suffered. The agent knew that the man had questions. \"How many Todd Mannings does it take to screw in a light bulb?\" the man shot back. He continued that there only needed to be one Todd, and jabbed the gun into Todd's stomach. Suddenly, someone knocked the man out. \"You're welcome,\" Agent Baker offered to Todd.\n\n\nAgent Baker's men disarmed the unconscious man. The agent promised to \"take care of the situation.\" Todd demanded to know what was going on. The agent replied that nothing had happened, the man had never said anything to Todd, the man had never been there, Todd had never seen the man, and he never would. He ordered Todd to keep quiet about what had happened, especially to Tomas. If Todd wanted to pursue the agent, the agent promised that Todd's life would have the same outcome as the man's was going to.\n\n\nAgent Baker instructed his men to tie the man up, and put him in the car. Todd reminded the agent that the man had Sam stashed away somewhere. \"That's not my problem,\" Agent Baker replied, and walked away. Dumbfounded, Todd stood on his doorstep.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Dani expressed their worry about Todd. Dani related that, if T\u00e9a didn't try to call him, Dani would. T\u00e9a dialed Todd's number, and was confused to hear the phone ringing on the other side of the front door. She opened the door and found Todd. She asked him what was going on.\n\n\nBlair announced that she'd heard from John -- Sam had been found. T\u00e9a believed that Dani had saved the day. Suddenly, John appeared in the doorway, holding Sam. Sam ran to Blair, and Blair promised never to let Sam out of her sight again. Todd picked his son up, and made sure that he was all right. Sam apologized for scaring everyone. John promised to explain what had happened after Sam finished his party. Everyone went into the living room except for John, Todd, and Tomas, who shared a suspicious look. Todd left, and Tomas wondered if John had caught the kidnapper.\n\n\nStarr cut the cake for the kids as the adults discussed the night's events. T\u00e9a clarified that Sam had been led away by his friend who had Todd's old face. Todd thought that Sam had imagined it, or had inherited the \"crazy gene\" from his mother. \"Or maybe he's right,\" T\u00e9a suggested.\n\n\nTodd left the room, and Blair ran after him. She wanted to talk about the night, so that what had happened would never happen again. Todd just wanted to enjoy his son's birthday party. Blair reminded Todd that the kidnapper was still out there. Todd made it clear that he knew that.\n\n\nJack and Sam argued over a piece of cake, so Sam threatened Jack with his new web shooters. They ran away, and Dani followed. Starr was glad that everything was back to normal, but Baz related that they still didn't know what Todd and Tomas were hiding.\n\n\nBack at the motel, John examined the evidence, which included the Spider-Man costume in a bag. An officer asked if John had any theories on Spider-Man's \"secret identity.\"\n\n\nAgent Baker's men sat the man down on the docks. Agent Baker expressed his disappointment in the man, as the man woke up. The agent informed the man that he would have had a future, if no one in Llanview had seen him. Agent Baker continued that he only had one option, and took out his gun. \"I guess I don't have to tell you what it is,\" he added.\n\n\nAgent Baker said that there couldn't be two Todd Mannings. He fired his gun twice, and then made a call. He told the person on the other end that the man would no longer be a problem for anyone. Agent Baker told the seemingly dying man that he'd only been following orders. The agent's men pushed the man's limp body into the water, and walked away.\n\n\n",

The man becomes many men. Original Todd uses Todd as a human shield and backs away, but someone hits him over the head. The man in charge tells Todd that they will take care of everything, they were never there, nothing ever happened, and Todd must never speak of it to anyone, but especially not his brother-in-law, Tomas. Sebastian wonders if Tomas is worried about Sam or if he is worried about his secret. He asks Tomas about his CIA file and special skills. The men take Original Todd to the docks and tell him that he killed his future with the organization when he allowed himself to be seen in Llanview. They shoot him and push him in the water.",
