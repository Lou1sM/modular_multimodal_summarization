    "soap_central": "\nA Little Bit Of History Repeating\n\n\nIn Heaven, Viki's granddaughter, Megan, and a female heavenly being watched Viki's death on a television screen. As Viki's motionless body appeared on the screen, the heavenly being froze the channel and advised Megan to locate her grandmother. Megan, a young adult, did as she was told. After Megan left the room, the heavenly being unfroze the channel and continued to watch the scene involving Viki and Dorian. \n\n\nAs Dorian exclaimed that Viki was dead, Mel appeared and stated, \"All the best people are!\" A surprised Dorian reminded herself that Mel was dead, but Mel replied that she would still have to answer to him. Mel chastised Dorian for plotting against Charlie and reminded her of her devious stunt. Dorian defended her actions, but an angered Mel suggested that Dorian stop living under Viki's shadow. The heavenly being changed the channel. As she reached for her cup of coffee, she watched the action taking place in Mendorra. \n\n\nIn Mendorra, Carlo informed Cristian that the post-hypnotic suggestion that he planted in Cris's brain still had an effect on his behavior. Carlo ordered Cris to kill Sarah. Sarah, Tina, and Cain all watched as Cris responded by striking Carlo. The heavenly being turned her attention back to Viki. \n\n\nUnaware of her surroundings, Viki walked through the gates of heaven and was greeted by Megan. A smile crossed Viki's face and she exclaimed, \"I know you, don't I?\" Megan smiled and told Viki that she was her granddaughter. Finding the news impossible to believe, Viki argued that Megan should only be ten years old. Megan related that it was best that she met Viki in her current form. Viki wondered if she was dead, but Megan stated that Viki was in a state of transitioning from one life to another. Megan announced that Viki needed to make a few stops before she actually arrived on the top floor of heaven. Megan took Viki's hand and led her to an elevator. As they rode up, Megan was certain that there were a few people she needed to see. \n\n\nWhen the elevator door opened on the first floor, Viki could hear the voice of Asa Buchanan. Asa was complaining about being placed on hold, and demanded to be moved to a higher floor. Viki smiled lovingly as she came face-to-face with Asa. Upon learning that Viki was in a car accident with Dorian, he suggested that there was no justice in the world because Dorian was still alive. The two joked that perhaps Dorian had ended up somewhere a little warmer. When Viki suggested that Clint was out of control, Asa insisted that Clint's actions were a result of him trying to take care of the family. He demanded that she not speak ill of Clint. Asa mentioned how much he missed Viki, and promised her that everything would be all right. Viki told Asa that she loved him, and Megan appeared to take her to the next stop. Viki asked Megan if her life on earth was really over. Megan told Viki that where she went from that point on was completely up to her. \n\n\nAs the elevator doors opened again, Viki was puzzled to be in the same room with Elvis. To Viki's horror, Niki appeared and demanded that Viki keep her hands off the King. When Viki questioned why Niki was in heaven, Niki stated that wherever Viki went, so did she. Viki began to rehash the terrible things that had happened to Jessica in the past weeks, and wondered how on earth Jess would cope with her loss. Niki was certain that Jess would call on Tess to help her get through the hard times. Viki told Niki that Tess was dead. Niki laughed and mentioned that she didn't see Tess anywhere in heaven. Viki demanded answers, but Niki refused to give her any and turned her attention back to the King. The elevator door opened and Niki reminded her that she was on a schedule. Viki joined Megan on the elevator. Sensing that Viki was troubled, Megan asked what was wrong. Viki was bothered by Niki's statement that Tess was still around. \n\n\nWhen the doors opened, Viki was in the old Banner office. She became excited when she saw Mel's desk and was anxious to see him again. Mel's chair was empty. Megan told Viki that Mel must have stepped out to get a scoop on a big story. She apologized and told Viki that she couldn't wait because she had another stop. Viki was disappointed that she had missed Mel. They headed toward the elevator. \n\n\nMegan escorted Viki to another room. Viki was surprised to be inside a television studio. Megan stated that she was an actress and worked there along with her Aunt Megan, Viki's daughter. Believing she would be reunited with her child, she became excited. With regret, her granddaughter informed Viki that Aunt Megan was the executive producer of the show and was in a network meeting, but had left a message for her. Megan told Viki to have a look around and perhaps she would encounter the \"Big Cheese,\"-the creator of the show. Viki pulled back the curtains and was face-to-face with the heavenly being. When she saw Viki, a smile crossed the woman's face. The woman exclaimed, \"Hi, Victoria! I'm Agnes!\" The woman told Viki that she had been watching over Viki for forty years, well technically thirty-eight. Viki was delighted to meet Agnes. Agnes told Viki that Megan spoke about her all the time and had left a tape for her to watch. Agnes wished Viki luck and promised her that she would be watching. Agnes left Viki alone to watch the tape. When Viki turned to the television screen, she observed a past scene that involved her and her daughter, Megan. In the scene, Viki begged Megan to forgive her but Megan refused and demanded that Viki get out of her life. \n\n\nViki wondered why her daughter would want her to witness such a sad scene from their past. Her granddaughter told her that Aunt Megan thought Viki needed to see it. Viki remembered how hurtful that time in her life was, but remarked how they had gotten past those rough times and had built a great life together before Megan died. Her granddaughter assured Viki that Aunt Megan loved Viki at the time of her death and still did. Megan informed Viki that her daughter wanted her to see the tape so that she could remember what it felt like to love someone and have them turn you down. Megan suggested that Viki forgive Charlie, despite his lies. She reminded Viki how much she loved Charlie and urged her grandmother to give him another chance. With great sadness, Viki asked Megan how she could forgive Charlie if she were dead. Megan smiled and asked Viki to trust her. Viki lovingly looked at Megan and replied, \"Of course I can, you're my granddaughter!\" They headed off to Viki's next stop. \n\n\nWhen Viki exited the elevator she found herself at Crossroads. As she basked in memories of Ben, he popped up from behind a piano and called out, \"Hiya, Blondie!\" Viki stared lovingly at him. \n\n\nAgain, the heavenly being turned the channel. On the screen, a maid watched a soap opera on television. A young girl on the soap listened as her father exclaimed, \"Victoria, you are the heir to the Lord fortune! One day you will take over the Banner and run it all by yourself.\" The maid was startled when Chuck Wilson and a ranch hand burst into the room carrying an unconscious Bo and Rex. When Bo and Rex came to, Chuck asked them if they knew what year it was. Bo replied that it was the year 2008. Bo and Rex stared in disbelief when Chuck informed them that they were struck by lightning and it was actually the year 1968. On the television screen, a soap opera called One Life To Live premiered. \n\n\nBelieving that he was the object of a ruse, Bo demanded that Chuck put an end to the joke. A serious Chuck insisted that it was indeed 1968 and Johnson was president. When Rex blamed Bo for their dilemma, Chuck chastised him for back talking his Pa. Bo and Rex were horrified when they learned that Bo was actually Asa and Rex was a younger Bo. Chuck informed them that he was actually Chuck Jr., not Chuck III. Realizing that something was terribly wrong, Bo sent Chuck on an errand so that he could be alone with Rex. Bo and Rex tried to figure out what had happened to them. Bo suggested that Rex turn on the television to obtain some answers. Without the use of a remote, Rex had a difficult time but eventually turned the ancient television on. As One Life To Live ended, Bo and Rex panicked when a news report came on referring to the recent assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. \n\n\nThe mystery continued as a man with long sideburns and bearing a strong resemblance to Jared burst into the room. He said that he was Clint and referred to Bo as Pa and Rex as his little brother Bo. Upon asking \"Clint\" a question that only his brother would know and receiving the correct answer, Bo realized that they had definitely been transported back in time. Clint called out to Chuck Junior and Chuck Senior to bring his Pa and brother a drink. A drunken man resembling Nigel appeared and stated he was Chuck Wilson Senior. Bo and Rex stared in disbelief. \n\n\nChuck Senior said he knew what would make the men feel better. He opened the door and screamed, \"Girls!\" A woman with long black hair, dressed as a maid, and resembling Natalie entered the room with liquor. Clint appeared attracted to her and called her Maria. A confused Rex wondered why Jared would refer to Natalie by the name Maria. Bo told Rex that Jared was Clint and the Natalie look-alike was actually Maria Roberts, Cord's mother and Sarah's grandmother. In the background, Clint and Maria cozied up to one another. Noticing the close interaction, Chuck Senior ushered Maria out of the room. Clint followed close behind. Chuck Senior warned Bo/Asa that Clint was getting too comfortable with the hired help. \n\n\nWhen Chuck left them alone, Bo and Rex recounted what had taken place before they were struck by lightning. While Rex was frightened by the circumstances, Bo appeared calm and reasoned that they were either dreaming or hallucinating. Rex was convinced that they were in trouble. Rex left to compose himself and opened the front door. There stood a woman and child, resembling Gigi and Shane. A relieved Rex expressed his delight to see familiar faces. He called out Gigi's name and tried to explain his recent experiences. The Gigi look-alike gave Rex a disgusted look and stated that she had no idea who he was. Brushing past him, she said that she and her son had business to take care of and demanded that Rex get out of her way. She approached a bewildered Bo and announced, \"Asa Buchanan, I have a bone to pick with you!\" \n\n\nBack in Mendorra, Carlo was infuriated that he no longer had Cris under his control. He ordered the guards to take Cain to the dungeon and announced that he would escort Sarah, Cris, and Tina to an undisclosed location. As he led them away at gunpoint, they followed Carlo's instructions. \n\n\nThe guards dragged Sarah and Cris to the river. Carlo followed close behind holding a gun to Tina's head. As they walked towards the river, Carlo reminded Tina how she had seduced and murdered his son, Johnny Dee. Tina recalled that Niki Smith had killed Johnny, but Carlo was out for revenge. Carlo directed Tina's attention to a waterfall. He reminded her of the time she went over the Iguazo Falls. Tina panicked as she relived the nightmare of Carlo throwing her over the Iguazo Falls. She begged him not to do it again. With a devious smile, Carlo said that he had no intention of tossing Tina over the falls. A relieved Tina thanked him. Sarah, Tina, and Cris were horrified when Carlo informed them that Sarah would be tossed over the falls instead. Tina pleaded with Carlo to reconsider and Cris attempted to attack one of the guards. Cris backed off when Carlo threatened to shoot Sarah and Tina if Cris interfered. Tina asked Carlo to send her over the falls and spare Sarah. Carlo ordered the guards to strap Sarah to the boat and stated, \"The sins of the mother shall be visited upon the daughter!\" A panicked Sarah screamed, \"I love you Mom!\" A grief stricken Tina told Sarah that she loved her, too. Cris and Tina watched in horror as Sarah drifted towards the waterfall. Carlo said, \"Touching isn't it... history repeating itself!\" \n\n\nDorian and Mel shared a few laughs and Dorian expressed her delight to be reunited with Mel again. She told him that she missed him dearly and he responded affectionately towards her. Although Dorian was pleased to see him, Mel reminded her that he had come to deal with her concerning the awful things she had done to Charlie and Viki. Dorian denied living in Viki's shadow, but Mel pointed out that she had dated Clint as a way to hurt Viki and had sought vengeance against Charlie because Viki loved him. Mel urged Dorian to face her feelings and live her own life. Mel told Dorian that she had done much damage and needed to atone for her sins before it was too late. He warned her that she had one last chance. After much convincing, Dorian finally agreed to make amends with Charlie and Viki. She turned and caught a glimpse of Viki's dead body. In horror, Dorian screamed that she would never be able to make amends because the entire Buchanan family would blame her for Viki's death. Mel insisted that Dorian would have to bring Viki back. Dorian stared at him in disbelief.\n\n\n",
