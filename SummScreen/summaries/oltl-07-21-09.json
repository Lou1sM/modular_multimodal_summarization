Langston was worried about Markko.  She feared that he would not be able to settle into Llanfair.  A few minutes later, Cole stopped by to see Starr and Hope.  Langston quietly excused herself, so that the family could be alone.\n\n\nAfter Starr put Hope down for a nap, Cole told Starr about his new apartment.  Starr was excited over the idea of moving in with Cole.  Cole reminded Starr of the reality of his situation.  He didn't want Starr or Hope to be anywhere near his apartment while he worked undercover.  Starr respected Cole's decision, but admitted that she was disappointed.  Cole reminded Starr that she needed to focus on graduating from high school while he completed his undercover assignment; afterwards they would be free to plan a future. Cole promised to call Starr, but he made it clear that he didn't want her to show up at his apartment until his assignment was over.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Markko sat at the kitchen table with Viki, Charlie, and Jessica.  As they finished breakfast, Markko offered to clear the dishes away as a show of appreciation for Viki's hospitality.  Viki refused to allow Markko to do all the work alone.  While Jessica dashed off, Viki and Charlie helped Markko clean up.  Viki impressed upon Markko that he was welcome in her home and free to stay for as long as he needed to.  Markko thanked Viki for her generosity.  However, he was hopeful that he would be able to return home soon.  Markko explained that his mother had asked Father Diaz, a progressive young priest, to talk to Mr. Rivera.\n\n\nA short time later, Langston stopped by to visit Markko.  After Viki and Charlie excused themselves, Markko confessed that he was eager to move out.  He felt as if he were intruding on Viki.  Langston suggested that Markko move into La Boulaie, but Markko rejected the idea.  He didn't think he'd get any rest living under the same roof with Langston.  \n\n\nAs Markko and Langston kissed, Viki popped into the kitchen to fetch Charlie's glasses.  Markko appeared embarrassed to have been caught kissing Langston.  After Viki returned to Charlie, Markko walked Langston to the door.  As they kissed goodbye, Mr. Rivera approached them.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Cris was in the process of picking up the envelope that had been slipped under Kyle's door, when Brody approached.  Cris quickly realized that Brody wasn't going to make a fuss about finding Cris loitering in the hallway, so he opened up to Brody about why he was looking for Kyle.  Cris explained that Kyle had suggested that Fish, one of Cris's roommates, was using Layla, another of his roommates.  Brody warned Cris that Kyle was bad news and not to be trusted.  Cris appreciated Brody's advice, but he was determined to find out what Kyle knew about Fish.\n\n\nWhen Brody mentioned that he had recently been accepted by the police academy, Cris asked if Brody could look into Fish's personnel records.  Brody reminded Cris that the files were confidential.  Cris realized he had asked too much of someone he had just met.  He apologized to Brody for the inappropriate request.  Brody suggested that perhaps Cris's feelings for Layla went beyond friendship.\n\n\nAfter Brody walked away, Cris gave in to temptation.  He picked up the envelope and read the letter inside.  The letter stated: \"Kyle, I know you talked to Cristian Vega.  That you told him I was using Layla, but I'm not.  I care about her.  She's a great girl and I want to be with her, so please back off.  Whatever you think you know about me, it was a long time ago.  I'm not that guy anymore.  For both our sakes, get on with your life and stop messing with mine.  Oliver.\"\n\n\nAt the apartment, Layla was furious because Fish had told everyone at the police station that they were dating.  Layla felt hurt and betrayed because Fish had gone back on their agreement.  Fish apologized for the slip; he had given in to peer pressure.  Layla appreciated Fish's honesty.  However, she was disappointed because Fish had put her in an awkward position.  Layla didn't want anyone to think that she had been hired because of her relationship with Fish.\n\n\nFish eventually managed to smooth things over.  When Layla kissed him, Fish pulled away.  He made the excuse that he needed something to drink and ran to the kitchen.  Layla followed him, sensing that he was uncomfortable.  Fish assured Layla that everything was fine, and then kissed her to prove his point.  \n\n\nLayla realized that Fish wasn't into the kiss and asked him if the idea of sex with her had bothered him.  Fish denied it, but she didn't believe him.  Layla suspected that she had hit a nerve.  She recalled other incidents in their past and came to a surprising conclusion.  She asked Fish if he was gay.\n\n\nBrody was pleasantly surprised when he returned to his room to discover Jessica lounging on his bed.  Brody asked Jessica how her visit with Starr and Cole had gone.  Jessica revealed that the teens had been understanding and forgiving.  Jessica confided that she had declined Starr's offer for Jessica to hold Hope because she'd been overwhelmed with the urge to snatch up Hope and run off with her.  \n\n\nBrody wondered why Jessica hadn't called him to discuss it.  Jessica revealed that she hadn't wanted to bother him when he was busy.  Brody made it clear that Jessica came first in his life.  Jessica was touched by Brody's passionate declaration.  The two kissed and then began to make love.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Rex showed Gigi the cooler, containing the life-saving stem cells that Stacy had been hiding, and announced that they were free of Stacy.  Gigi was delighted by the news and kissed Rex.  They were busy making plans when Gigi suddenly remembered that she had been scheduled to work.  Rex assured Gigi that he would take care of everything at the hospital, and promised to meet her later.\n\n\nShortly after Gigi left, Roxy arrived at the hospital.  She was upset because no one had called her about Shane.  Rex was furious; he asked Roxy why anyone should have called her when she had been in cahoots with Stacy.  Roxy was stunned by the accusation and tried to disavow any involvement with Stacy.  Rex informed Roxy that the truth had been revealed.  He demanded to know who had donated the stem cells to Shane.\n\n\nRoxy did her best to keep Rex from finding out who the donor was, but Rex refused to let Roxy off the hook.  Eventually Rex figured out that the donor was his father.  Roxy told Rex that his father would never have willingly donated his stem cells to help Shane; she took full credit for saving Shane's life.  Roxy angrily admitted that after she had taken the stem cells from Rex's biological father, she had killed the man.\n\n\nIn the hospital's parking garage, Stacy approached Gigi's car with a determined expression and a crowbar in her hand.  Stacy stepped out of her stilettos before she proceeded to smash in the windows of Gigi's car.  Afterwards, Stacy took out her lipstick and wrote, \"bitch\" all over the damaged vehicle.  Once she had completed with her task, Stacy promised that Gigi would be next.\n\n\nGigi was aghast when she saw her car.  When Stacy suddenly appeared, Gigi realized who was responsible for the vandalism. Gigi refused to be intimidated by Stacy.  Gigi threatened to press charges against her sister if Stacy didn't immediately return to Las Vegas.  Stacy laughed at Gigi's threat and promised not to give up Rex without a fight.  \n\n\nStacy proceeded to gloat about her sexual encounter with Rex.  Gigi refused to believe Stacy; she insisted that Stacy was completely delusional.  Stacy didn't back down.  To prove her point, Stacy asked Gigi when was the last time that Rex and Gigi had sex.  Gigi reached her breaking point and punched Stacy.  Stacy was knocked back on her rear end.\n\n\nGigi was convinced that Stacy lacked a soul.  She hauled Stacy to her feet and threatened to kill Stacy if she ever came near Gigi's family again.  Stacy didn't take the threat seriously.  Instead, Stacy opened her coat to reveal her undergarments.  According to Stacy, Rex had ripped her clothes off in his eagerness to have sex with her.  Stacy offered to give Gigi a \"blow by blow\" description of the encounter.  Gigi ignored her sister until Stacy suggested that they find Rex to question him personally.\n\n\nAs Stacy walked off, Gigi gave chase.  In the stairwell, Gigi grabbed Stacy's arm and spun her around.  Gigi reminded Stacy that she had been warned to stay away from Rex and Shane.  A brief struggle ensued, during which Stacy took a nasty fall down a flight of stairs.  Gigi stared down at Stacy's still body with an expression of utter horror.\n \n\n\n",
