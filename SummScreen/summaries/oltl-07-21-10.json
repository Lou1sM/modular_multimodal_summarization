Mr. and Mrs. Banks were both stunned that their counterparts had been unwilling to admit their love.  Viki feared for the future of the civic center after Dorian's firing of Charlie, but Charlie said they could use the media pressure of the Banner to keep the project alive.  He didn't regret his dismissal, and told Viki he'd known it wouldn't last working with the lascivious Dorian, \"because I love my wife.\"  Charlie noticed the collection of skimpy swimsuits Viki had made David wear, and said that only David Vickers would wear them.\n\n\nBrody, looking for Jessica, entered the drawing room.  Viki told him that both Jessica and Natalie had headed to the hospital with stomach pains, and recounted how the twins had suspected that David's muffins had given them food poisoning.  Charlie was sure David's fiendish culinary skills had felled the sisters, but Viki reminded him that David had eaten one of the muffins and not become ill.  Brody wondered what could have made both Jessica and Natalie sick, if not food poisoning.  He called Jessica's phone and left a message, then told Viki and Charlie he'd meet up with her at Rodi's.\n\n\nAfter Brody left, Viki told Charlie that David was a handful but a true friend, and she didn't want to banish him from her life despite the recent hijinks.  Charlie grudgingly ceded to her wishes, and apologized for dreaming up his bizarre scheme.  \"Burn those sheets,\" he asked her, still scarred by the sight of David and Viki in bed together.\n\n\nCharlie couldn't get the image of Viki and David's skimpy swimsuit photo shoot out of his mind, and Viki told her hubby that she would've rather been rubbing suntan lotion on his shoulders by the pool.  Charlie remembered their \"alone time\" fondly, but was doubtful they'd ever get that kind of free time and privacy again.  A light bulb went off over Viki's head, and she told Charlie they needed to do something about that.\n\n\nAfter speaking with Lois, Viki returned to the drawing room.  Charlie asked Viki to evict David from Llanfair, since their mission had failed, but Viki said that David would be a loyal employee, and she didn't want to throw him out with nowhere to go after manipulating and toying with him.  \"Shoot me now,\" Charlie sighed, but Viki told him she had a better idea: a tropical vacation, just the two of them, alone together at last.  She told him that the Banner would run itself without her, and reminded Charlie he was out of a job; also, Lois had promised to mind Llanfair in their absence.  Charlie loved the idea of being alone with his wife in a cozy bungalow by the beach. He kissed her and asked, \"How fast can you pack?\"\n\n\nAfter changing clothes and packing their belongings, Viki and Charlie rendezvoused back in the drawing room.  Viki told Charlie she'd made their vacation reservations, but told him that their destination was a secret and a surprise.  \"Viki B, you are the best thing that ever happened to me,\" Charlie marveled, taking her into his arms for a loving embrace.  After a passionate kiss, Viki and Charlie hurried out of Llanfair to their tropical getaway.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Danielle was in her and T\u00e9a's suite, reading up on glioblastoma brain tumors on her laptop.  Just then, Todd and T\u00e9a returned, and told the teen they had news for her.  T\u00e9a reassured Danielle that the news was good, not bad.  \"You're in remission?\" Danielle asked immediately, but was disappointed when T\u00e9a told her the news wasn't quite that good, but something different.  T\u00e9a revealed that she and Todd were getting married.\n\n\nDanielle was taken aback, and Todd told her that he'd made a big mistake leaving her mom, whom he still loved.  \"What do you say, squirt,\" he asked, \"wanna give me a chance?\"  Danielle warned him not to call her \"squirt,\" and T\u00e9a told her they needed her blessing.  Danielle protested that her parents' happiness wasn't up to her, but T\u00e9a insisted that they wanted her approval.  Danielle asked them if they were marrying for her, but T\u00e9a said that wasn't the case at all - they were marrying for T\u00e9a, and for their love.\n\n\nDanielle told Todd that she'd been hard on him, but he'd come through for her when he helped Nate, and he'd taken good care of T\u00e9a.  She knew that he hadn't hurt Marty and concluded, \"maybe you're not as bad as I thought.\"  Todd was thrilled by her high praise, and Danielle told him to just keep making T\u00e9a smile.  Father and daughter shook on it, to T\u00e9a's delight.\n\n\nTaking stock of their situation, Danielle said she was happy about the engagement, but pretending to be a normal family doing normal things was difficult.  Todd reminded her that the engagement was a good thing, and a cause for celebration.  Danielle agreed and asked T\u00e9a if they'd set a date, but T\u00e9a explained that they were still negotiating with Blair for the children's availability.  In the meantime, T\u00e9a suggested they go on a pre-wedding shopping spree, and asked Danielle to be her maid of honor, a role the girl happily accepted.  Danielle asked if Nate could attend the wedding, a request which raised Todd's paternal hackles, but T\u00e9a defused the moment by saying that Nate would be welcome as Danielle's guest.\n\n\nWatching her parents cuddling on the couch, Danielle asked Todd and T\u00e9a if they wanted some private time, and ignored their lame claims to the contrary.  \"She's just like me,\" Todd laughed, noting Danielle's ability to cut through pretense.  Danielle told her parents that she had to meet Nate, anyway, and would see them later.\n\n\nWith Danielle gone, Todd and T\u00e9a let their guard down; they were happy, but T\u00e9a's illness still weighed heavily on both their minds.  T\u00e9a was guilt-ridden about quashing Danielle's hopes for remission, but said they couldn't do anything but let the teen deal with the crisis in her own way.  In the meantime, they had each other.  T\u00e9a curled into Todd's arms as he kissed her neck.  \"This is the easy part,\" she murmured.\n\n\nSettling back onto the couch, Todd and T\u00e9a considered Danielle's reaction to their engagement.  Todd was happy that Danielle hadn't freaked out or fled at the news, but was concerned about the distance that remained between him and his newly discovered offspring.  He'd always wanted his children to be able to lean on him, the way he'd never been able to rely on his parents, but he knew Danielle still wasn't totally comfortable with him.  T\u00e9a told him that Danielle would have to lean on him when T\u00e9a was gone, and that they'd continue working on the bond.  Recalling Danielle's hopes for her recovery, she despaired at the thought of not being able to comfort her daughter herself when the unthinkable happened.\n\n\nTodd reminded T\u00e9a that the night was their engagement party, and they needed to celebrate, which was what Danielle had left them alone to do.  Nibbling at her ear and kissing her softly, he told T\u00e9a he didn't want to let their kid down.  As Todd began to undress her, T\u00e9a protested feebly that she wasn't up for romance lately, but Todd disagreed.  \"You're you,\" he said. \"You're always you.\"  T\u00e9a relented and she and Todd sank onto the couch cushions together and began to make out.\n\n\nAfter making love, Todd and T\u00e9a ended up snuggling on the floor of the suite.  T\u00e9a told Todd she was glad he was there, instead of hanging one of her doctors out of a window.  \"I wouldn't do that,\" Todd protested, and playfully told her to shut up.  \"Why don't you make me,\" T\u00e9a teased, and Todd drew her into his arms for a long kiss.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Jessica and Natalie faced their respective doctors in separate exam rooms, both stunned by the news that they were pregnant.  Struggling to process the shocking news, they questioned and re-questioned Greg and his colleague.  Jessica asked Greg if he was sure, while Natalie was positive she couldn't be pregnant.  When asked if the diagnosis was good news, neither sister was certain.  As they were informed they were each two months pregnant, Jessica and Natalie both flashed back to their respective recent trysts - Jessica's with Brody and Ford, and Natalie's with John and Brody - and murmured, \"Oh, no!\"\n\n\nAs their doctors noticed their unease, both Natalie and Jessica hid their fears.  They each were unprepared to have a child, and had both just started new jobs.  Natalie promised her doctor she'd make an appointment with an obstetrician, but when he left, she was crestfallen.  In Jessica's exam room, Greg urged her to make an appointment with her previous obstetrician in order to keep an eye on her prior medical issues.  Jessica agreed to set up an appointment, but after Greg left, she, too, was wrestling with her thoughts.\n\n\nBoth shell-shocked sisters dressed and exited to the adjoining corridor, meeting up at the nurse's station in a shared daze.  When asked about their diagnoses, both Natalie and Jessica lied to each other and said they had a stomach virus.  After some nervous small talk, Natalie raced off to Rodi's, and left Jessica alone at the nurse's station.  Checking her phone, she discovered Brody's message, but before she could process her thoughts, Ford interrupted her.  \"What the hell are you doing here?\" she snapped.\n\n\nFord told Jessica he was delivering his brother food, and snidely informed her that her cousin had shot James.  He asked her what she was doing there, and Jessica was seized by the recurring memory of her intimate encounter with the handsome filmmaker.  As she struggled to broach the topic of their night together, Ford became fed up, and warned her that he'd already told her boyfriend that nothing had happened between them.  With that, he stormed off to see James.\n\n\nNot far away, Danielle arrived in another wing of the hospital and encountered Greg. She asked for his help with some questions about T\u00e9a's diagnosis.  As Greg ushered her into an exam room, Danielle produced her laptop and showed Greg her online research into one doctor's experimental treatment for glioblastoma.  Greg was instantly skeptical, and explained to the teen that the Internet was full of scammers and misleading information; her best bet, he felt, was to rely on legitimate medical journals.  Danielle pleaded with him to take a closer look at her findings, but Greg wasn't convinced.\n\n\nAngered by his dismissal, Danielle told Greg he was just worried that there was a better physician out there who could do more for T\u00e9a than he could.  \"You really are your father's daughter,\" Greg said as he sighed.  Danielle agreed, and told Greg that Todd would spare no expense to find a cure for T\u00e9a's illness.  Greg said they all wanted to save T\u00e9a, but a cure didn't exist, and that the doctor she'd discovered online was likely to be an opportunist.\n\n\nDanielle reminded Greg that Bo and Nora had branded him an opportunist when he'd told them he could help Matthew, but he wasn't the only doctor in the world - she'd helped Matthew, and she'd help her mother, and he could go to hell.  Infuriated, she stalked out of the exam room.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Elijah hastily exited the living room as Kelly and Rex discussed their search for Bennett Thompson, unaware that he was mere feet away.  Heading for the front door, he spoke quietly into his phone, and asked Lisa Williamson if she was really looking for Bennett Thompson.  As he spoke, he opened the door and found John standing there, curious.\n\n\nElijah told Lisa he'd call her back and quickly hung up, greeting John with forced pleasantries; John said he was looking for Kelly and Rex, and Elijah ushered him into the foyer.  Elijah asked if the police case file on Hannah was available, but John told him that doctors at St. Anne's were still evaluating Hannah. He said he hadn't stopped by regarding that case but Kelly's, and the mysterious Bennett Thompson.  Hiding his trepidation, Elijah casually probed John about his involvement in the investigation, but John said he'd speak to Kelly about it.  Elijah told the detective that Kelly had asked for his help, and asked if John's questions in any way related to him.  \"No, not yet,\" John replied coolly.\n\n\nKelly and Rex entered the foyer and greeted John, who handed Rex the police files on Melinda and Rodney's murders.  Rex thanked him for his help, and John said that he was overextended at the department and needed Rex to keep him apprised on the investigation.  Elijah listened with concern as Rex told John about his trip to Boston to find Bennett Thompson. Elijah made excuses to John and Kelly as he prepared to follow Rex to Rodi's. Before Elijah could go, however, John stopped him, and asked him to call the department and make an appointment so they could talk about his clients.  Elijah agreed and quickly exited, with John's gaze still fixed on him.\n\n\nAlone with John, Kelly thanked him for helping her and Rex with their investigation.  She feared that \"Bennett Thompson\" had nothing to do with what happened to Melinda, but she had to know for sure.  \"What was Eli doing here?\" John asked, and Kelly explained that he'd been there to see Blair.  John was perturbed to learn how close Elijah and Blair had become, and Kelly, exercising her journalist's instinct, pushed McBain to tell her why he was so interested in the handsome legal eagle.\n\n\nJohn told Kelly that Elijah was defending suspects in three of his open cases, including Cole and Hannah, and told her he'd found Hannah's sudden confession and breakdown convenient.  Kelly asked him if he thought Elijah was engineering those events, and John hedged.  Kelly implored him to tell her if he had something on Elijah, who was set to marry Blair.  John was surprised by the news. Kelly explained that despite their differences, Blair was still her family, and she didn't want to see her cousin hurt.  John told her he didn't have anything on Elijah, and his concerns might be nothing; he wasn't jealous, but he wanted to see Blair happy.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi was working her shift when a co-worker handed her a package from Llanview University.  Her fellow waitress asked her if she'd applied for admission, but Gigi denied it and said she was too old for college.  The waitress told her not to be too sure, and reminded her that \"a book's lighter than a tray.\"\n\n\nBrody arrived, sat down at a table, and asked Gigi for an order of fries.  Moments later, Natalie entered and made a beeline for the bar.  Gigi asked if she was all right, and Natalie asked for some fries as well.  Gigi pointed out Brody, and said she'd whip up a batch for both of them and take it to their table.  Natalie's face fell as she saw Brody, and remembered their night together and her diagnosis.\n\n\nNatalie trudged over to Brody's table, listlessly returning his greetings; he asked her if she was okay, and Natalie snippily replied that she was fine.  Remembering Viki's mention of her illness, Brody asked if she was feeling well, and Natalie apologized for snapping at him and said she'd had a rough day.  Brody asked if she knew where Jessica was, and said he'd left a message for her to meet him at Rodi's.  Natalie said she'd left the hospital around the same time as Jessica, and didn't know where she was.  Brody left Jessica another voicemail, then asked Natalie point-blank, \"What the hell is going on?\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, Jessica discovered Brody's latest message, and quickly called Kelly at La Boulaie.  She told Kelly she was heading over, and they needed to talk.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Rex entered and headed for the bar to speak to Gigi, while Elijah surreptitiously arrived on Rex's heels.  As Elijah took a discreet seat at the bar, Rex told Gigi he was heading to Boston that night.  Gigi showed him her LU admissions letter, which surprised her boyfriend, who didn't know she'd applied.  Gigi said she didn't want to be a waitress all her life, and was hoping to take part-time classes on Viki's recommendation.  She was scared to open the letter out of fear of rejection, and asked Rex to do the honors.\n\n\nRex told her he was proud of her and her guts in pursuing her dreams, and opened the letter, which confirmed that Gigi had been accepted into LU.  As the couple hugged, Elijah watched them from afar.\n\n\nBack at Brody and Natalie's table, Natalie reiterated that she didn't know where Jess was, but Brody said it was her he was confused about; Natalie was stand-offish and distant, and he thought he knew why.  \"You do?\" Natalie asked, stunned.  Speaking quietly, Brody said he knew she felt awkward because of their hook-up, but he hadn't want to hurt Jessica with the truth about a night where they'd thought they were alone in the world.  They hadn't wanted to hurt anybody, and there was no reason for their partners to know. \"No harm, no foul,\" he said. Natalie told her he was wrong - there were consequences for their night together.\n\n\nBefore Natalie could explain, John arrived, greeting his girlfriend and his partner.  He asked Natalie to give him and Brody a couple minutes to speak about a case, and Natalie nervously headed for the bar.  Looking across the restaurant, John spotted Elijah drinking alone.  Brody asked if he still didn't trust Elijah.  \"Should I?\" John asked.\n\n\nAcross the room, Elijah continued to eavesdrop on Rex and Gigi.  Gigi feared she was being selfish sacrificing money and time for her education, but Rex told her she'd do great, and that his cracking the Bennett Thompson mystery for Kelly would help his business take off.  He told Gigi to let him handle Shane's college fund, while she handled her own needs for once.  The couple kissed goodbye as Rex headed for the airport, and Elijah moved to follow the P.I.\n\n\nJohn stopped Elijah on his way out the door, to congratulate him on his engagement to Blair.  Elijah thanked John for his well-wishes and said he had to go, and John asked him if his \"urgent appointment\" had stood him up. He clucked about Elijah's recent new clients.  Elijah said he couldn't discuss his cases with John and left.\n\n\nJohn, brooding about Elijah, returned to Brody's side.  \"He'll make a mistake,\" Brody said. \"They always do.\"\n\n\nAt the bar, Natalie asked Gigi for a drink, then realized she couldn't get any alcohol.  Gigi immediately deduced that she was pregnant, and Natalie said she hadn't told John yet.  Gigi agreed not to say anything.  Staring at John and Brody across the room, Natalie admitted to Gigi that she wasn't sure if John was the father.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Jessica arrived and told Kelly she was pregnant.  Overjoyed, Kelly hugged her, but Jessica's face remained a mask of turmoil.  Kelly asked if Brody knew yet, and Jessica said he didn't, because she wasn't sure if he was the father. \n\n\n",
