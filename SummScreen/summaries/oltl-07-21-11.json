After arguing, Brody decided that, in order to make Jessica comfortable, Natalie should move in with him. Jessica was livid, and Natalie wanted to talk about it in private. Jessica snidely offered to help Natalie pack. On her way outside, Jessica reminded Brody that Natalie would still be with John if Liam had been John's.\n\n\nBrody urged Natalie not to let Jessica get to her. He told her that they would figure things out later, and left for work. Natalie went outside, but Jessica didn't want her there. Natalie was tired of Jessica acting like the victim, because she wasn't the only victim. She didn't believe how Jessica couldn't understand two people turning to each other in a hard time. She thought that Jessica was lucky, because she could hurt as many people as she wanted without having to take responsibility for it.\n\n\nNatalie continued that Jessica had thrown Brody away, and had hidden behind Tess for months. Natalie wanted Jessica to leave her and Brody alone, and to stop blaming everyone else for her problems. They continued to argue until Ford entered, wondering why the women were yelling so loudly with children in the house. He made sure that Jessica was all right, and Natalie left in frustration. Jessica yelled after Natalie to leave her alone, and collapsed crying into Ford's arms.\n\n\nJessica didn't know what to do, because the situation she was in with Natalie and Brody was \"making me crazy.\" Ford knew how she felt, because he'd lost someone as well. She apologized for not having Ryder ready, and promised Ford extra visitation with Ryder. She told Ryder to have fun, and promised to be in a better mood when he returned. Ford asked her to join them at the park. She wanted to spend time with Bree, but Ford invited Bree along as well. She finally agreed. She smiled as Ford pushed Ryder's stroller toward the car.\n\n\nDorian happily entered Kelly's room, but quickly exited when she found Joey with Kelly in bed. Joey and Kelly quickly covered up, and invited Dorian back into the room. Dorian was thrilled that Joey and Kelly were back together. She informed them that she and David were back together, and told them about Echo's plot to break them up. She showed them the headline on the Sun: \"Spider-Man Saves Mayor.\" She opened up the paper and showed them a picture of Sam with Echo, who was trapped in the webs.\n\n\nKelly told Dorian that Dorian should have trusted David. Dorian related that Joey should have trusted Kelly about Aubrey. Joey informed Dorian that he was officially divorced. She was pleased that Joey was free to marry Kelly. Kelly refused to talk about the subject. Dorian had visited Kelly in order to give her two tickets to the premiere of David's movie the next night.\n\n\nKelly and Joey regretfully informed Dorian that they were going to visit Zane that night, but promised to see the movie when they returned. Dorian was thrilled that Zane was going to follow David's footsteps into show business, and offered for David to give him tips. She left, and Joey said he needed to get back to Llanfair. Kelly had to go to work, but the two began to kiss instead. A short while later, they ate breakfast in bed. Joey couldn't wait to make new memories with Kelly.\n\n\nRex entered John's office and asked about Echo. He couldn't believe that Echo could kidnap someone, and wondered when he could get her out of jail. He wanted to make the charges go away, so John suggested that Rex get a good lawyer. Rex sarcastically told John to find the real kidnapper, just like Todd had found Gigi's real killer. John assured Rex that the case wasn't over, and instructed him to focus on taking care of his family instead of revenge.\n\n\nJohn told Rex about Jack's attack at the Sun office. He suspected that it had been about business competition with a company called Origami Cogs. He added that it had taken no time at all for him to figure out that Origami Cogs was an anagram for Gigi Morasco. John warned Rex that, if Rex went too far over the line, trying to get back at Todd, John would have to step in. Rex wanted to see Echo, so John led him out of the office as Brody entered.\n\n\nBrody noticed Vimal's note on John's desk, and picked it up. He was horrified as he read the note aloud. He tried to figure out who had written the \"Anonymous\"-signed note, and eventually settled on Vimal. When Natalie entered, Brody stuffed the note in his pocket. She tried to tell him about the argument she'd had with Jessica, but Brody had to go work on a \"big case,\" and left.\n\n\nJohn returned to his office and found Natalie, who had a file from the lab. John noticed that there was something missing from the top of his desk. He wondered if she'd moved something on his desk. She hadn't, so John assumed that Brody had moved the note.\n\n\nDavid was eating breakfast at the diner when Bo sat down with him. David asked about Matthew, who David believed would get a miracle. He related that his miracle had appeared in the form of Spider-Man. Bo was glad that Dorian was safe. He added that the only potential clue he and Nora had as to who had hurt Matthew was a gum wrapper. David wondered if Bo needed help, because David had been \"the brainy one on the Supermodel Crime Club.\" Bo thanked his son, but advised him to \"stick to acting.\"\n\n\nDavid handed Bo a ticket to his movie premiere, and invited Nora as well. Bo regretfully declined the invitation, because he and Nora wanted to spend as much time with Matthew as possible. David understood, because Bo was a \"real-life hero.\" Bo was amazed to learn that Harrison Ford had played him, and wondered who'd played Rex.\n\n\nDavid admitted that Rex's character hadn't made the cut. Bo said he couldn't have rescued David without Rex, but David said that if not for Rex's secret-keeping, David could have been home from Morocco six months sooner. \"He never paid for that,\" David grumbled. However, Bo thought that Rex was suffering enough. David regretted that Rex had lost Gigi.\n\n\nDorian entered, and hoped that Bo and Nora would send Echo to Statesville. She wondered what would happen to Clint, since he had confessed to murder and kidnapping. Bo offered to set up a meeting to talk about it, and she agreed. \"Justice can wait, but not for long,\" she added.\n\n\nRex entered and told Bo that Bo had made a mistake in arresting Echo for kidnapping. He thought it had only been a fight between Echo and Dorian. David disagreed with Rex, but Bo refused to choose sides. Bo trusted John to follow the law, but promised to check on the case. Bo had to get to work, so he left. David remembered that he had an interview with Access Llanview, so he left as well.\n\n\nDorian stayed to invite Carlotta to the movie premiere. She noticed Rex leaning against the counter, and regretted that Echo had made his life a little worse. However, Dorian said that Echo would pay for what she'd done. Rex disagreed. \"You're going to drop the charges,\" he told her.\n\n\nVimal sat at Todd's desk, and wrote a note to his boss. He read aloud as he wrote that he was resigning, because he thought John deserved to know that he had a son. Suddenly, he heard someone call his name. He looked up and saw his parents. Clearly distressed, he wondered why they had arrived sooner than expected.\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. Patel were happy that Vimal seemed to be doing well for himself. \"You looked so unhappy at Statesville Industries,\" his mother added, much to Vimal's chagrin. Mrs. Patel mentioned Rama, so Vimal unsuccessfully tried to tell his parents about Rama's lies. They couldn't wait to see Rama, but Vimal had \"business to take care of first.\" He ran out of the room, leaving his parents.\n\n\nCutter handed Aubrey an envelope, which she opened immediately. She announced that she was officially divorced. Rama related that she'd probably be in the same boat soon. She told Cutter and Aubrey that she'd gone to congratulate Vimal on his new job, but he hadn't wanted anything to do with her. Cutter assured her that couples split up sometimes. \"Not in the Patel family,\" she answered. She explained how Vimal's parents had arranged the marriage, and had expected Rama to be a \"dutiful wife.\"\n\n\nRama knew she needed to start looking for a job, since she, Aubrey, and Cutter were all running low on money. She left to get a newspaper. Cutter told a disappointed Aubrey that she was a free woman. He continued that she'd been really good at her job, until she fell for Joey. She related that Joey was probably all ready to marry Kelly.\n\n\nRama returned with a newspaper, complaining about how few jobs were listed. She whined that the only job she was qualified for was a bartending position at Capricorn. She refused to work with Cristian, because he hated her more than Vimal. She opened the door to leave the room, and was shocked to find Vimal standing in the doorway. He couldn't believe what he was about to say, but he needed her help.\n\n\nRama left the room with Vimal, and he begged her to pretend that they were still happily married. He thought that lying would be easy for her. She reminded him that his parents would notice when they saw that Rama wasn't pregnant. She thought it was a bad idea. He finally realized that he couldn't lie, and decided to tell his parents the truth. He apologized for bothering her, and left.\n\n\nRama returned to the room, and chided herself for putting Vimal in such a terrible position. She went into the bathroom to take a hot shower. Aubrey noticed that Cutter's \"wheels are turning,\" and wondered what he was thinking. Reading the paper, he said he had a solution to their problems, and asked if she wanted to go to a movie premiere.\n\n\nAs Mr. and Mrs. Patel wondered what was keeping Vimal, Brody entered Todd's office, looking for Vimal. They assured themselves that Vimal would never get in trouble with the law, and told Brody that Vimal would return soon. They invited him to sit, and told him about the baby their daughter-in-law was expecting. Mrs. Patel said that children were miracles, and asked Brody if he had any children. He proudly told them that he had a son named Liam.\n\n\nVimal entered and asked if there was a problem. He gave his wallet and his apartment key to his parents, and shoved them out the door to take a cab back to his place. He told them that Rama would be out with friends, but that he'd return soon. They left, and Brody closed the office doors. Vimal asked if things were serious, and Brody said that they were. Brody wanted to talk to Vimal about the note Vimal had left for John.\n\n\n",
