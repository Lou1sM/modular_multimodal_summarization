    "soap_central": "\nEverything Old Is New Again\n\n\n\"Behind the scenes\" in Heaven, Agnes Nixon as \"Agnes\" the angel was watching over the people of Llanview, reviewing the episode's script and commenting aloud about the progression of the characters' trials and tribulations in the past hour. She clicked her remote control, and the scene on her divine television screen showed Bo and Rex in 1968, being confronted by the Gigi look-alike and her scowling child. \n\n\nIn 1968, Bo and Rex struggled to recover from the shock of seeing more doppelgangers in the past looking exactly like people they knew in the present. Bo made the mistake of calling the fiery young woman \"Gigi\" and she lost her temper, disgusted that \"Asa\" had slept with her but couldn't even remember her name. Rex was apoplectic at the idea that \"Bo\" had bedded a woman who looked exactly like Gigi Morasco. \"I never laid a hand on her!\" Bo sputtered, but the woman begged to differ, complaining that she was humiliated when Asa ditched her, and that all of \"Renee's other girls\" were talking about it at the whorehouse (she had covered her son's scandalized ears before finishing the sentence). The young woman reminded \"Asa\" that he'd made promises to her, and then ran out, but \"no one runs out on Emma Bradley!\" \n\n\nBo was shocked to realize that the Gigi look-alike really was Emma, David Vickers' mother, and that her seething young son, the Shane look-alike, was Spencer Truman as a child. Emma introduced herself to Rex as \"your daddy's true love,\" and reminded \"Asa\" that he said he'd leave \"[your] crazy wife\" Olympia, demanding that he propose on the spot. \"So, 'Pa,' you gonna marry her?\" Rex sniped, and an exasperated Bo accidentally called him \"Balsom\" as though it were his first name, covering to Emma by saying \"it's...from the Bible.\" Rex told Emma she could call him Bo, and Emma visibly took a shine to the young man, saying \"Balsom\" looked like it suited him somehow. \"Asa\" tried to apologize to Emma and Spencer for his forgetfulness, saying he and \"Bo\" had been struck by lightning. \"Cool,\" Spencer growled. \"Did it hurt?\" Emma excoriated \"Asa\" for his \"love-'em-and-leave-'em\" ways, and said she was sure \"Bo\" would never leave a girl \"high and dry.\" She wanted \"Asa\" to make things official, and told \"father and son\" that she and Spencer would be staying at a \"crappy little hotel\" in Paris, Texas waiting for his word. \n\n\nAfter Emma dragged Spencer out, Bo and Rex collapsed onto the furniture, freaking out about their bizarre predicament and the people of 1968's resemblances to all the people from the future. Bo lamely encouraged Rex to \"try to get into the spirit of things,\" but Rex was repulsed by the idea that Bo was standing in for a man who had slept with \"Gigi.\" Bo broke the news to Rex that Emma's second son, David, was the Buchanan heir, but had yet to be born in 1968. Suddenly, both men deduced that if Asa (or rather, Bo) didn't get further involved with Emma Bradley, David Vickers, the bane of the Buchanan clan's existence in 2008, would never be born. \n\n\nIn 2008, Clint was at the Buchanan mansion calling Bo but still getting no answer. Disappointed, he took another call, from his son Cord Roberts, Tina's ex-husband and Sarah's father. Cord was calling from London, anxious to speak to Sarah, who he said he hadn't heard from since Nash's funeral. Clint said he didn't know where Sarah was, but assumed she was off with Cristian. He told Cord he was trying to track down Bo, and Cord expressed relief that Bo had not married Lindsay, given their twisted history. Clint told Cord that Bo was in a bad way, and that he feared that sending Rex, who had had similar marital problems, to find him might have exacerbated the problem. \n\n\nCord assured Clint that Bo and Rex would be fine, and Clint admitted that Bo and Rex had established their own father and son bond, and that Rex reminded Bo of his late son, Drew. Clint and Cord reflected on their own complicated history, and reminisced about Cord's mother, the late Maria Roberts, who they both missed and loved despite her evil deeds near the end of her life. Cord urged his \"Pa\" to beat Dorian at her own game and get Buchanan Enterprises back, and Clint was touched to hear his son finally call him by an honorific usually reserved for Asa. Cord said that with Asa gone, Clint was head of the Buchanan family, and Clint considered his words as he stared at Asa's picture on his desk. \n\n\nIn 1968, the young Clint (a doppelganger for Jared) shared a romantic interlude with the young Maria (a doppelganger for Natalie) behind closed doors. Fearful of the consequences, Maria warned Clint that \"Mister Asa\" would find out and send her away, but Clint said he didn't care what his father thought; he loved her and that was all that mattered. Another maid, \"Rosa,\" a dead ringer for Noelle from Paris, Texas, discovered the forbidden lovers together and warned Clint to leave Maria alone, lest she be banished back to Mexico. Clint said nothing could keep them apart and asked Maria to meet him in his room that night. Once Rosa and Maria were alone, Maria confessed to the older woman that she was pregnant by Clint Buchanan, and intended to have his child; if it was a boy, she said she would name it \"Cordero.\" \n\n\nBack in 2008, the spirit of Mel Hayes urged Dorian to bring Viki back, saying there was still time. Dorian worked furiously to revive Viki, but after multiple attempts, relented, saying Viki had no pulse and there was nothing she could do. Just then, Mel disappeared and a disheveled David wandered in to find Dorian standing over Viki's broken body. He asked what had happened to Viki, and immediately blamed Dorian. \n\n\nUp in the afterlife, Ben and Viki shared a romantic reunion in an ethereal recreation of \"Crossroads.\" Viki said she'd prayed to see him again. She was impressed to see he'd found another pool table even in the hereafter, and Ben said he enjoyed it when Niki Smith and Elvis weren't hogging it. \"I can handle Niki Smith,\" he cracked. \"I just steer clear of open windows.\" \"Not funny,\" Viki shot back. Ben asked if she didn't miss his jokes, but Viki sighed that she missed everything about him. Viki and Ben reminisced about their first meetings at Crossroads; how she'd come there just after Mel's death, and been so out of place next to the rest of the clientele, then won the karaoke contest and a pair of fuzzy dice. \"I won you,\" Viki added. Viki was delighted to be back with her beloved, but Ben said she couldn't stay; \"you gotta go back.\" \n\n\nBen told Viki she'd given up on life too soon, and on Charlie Banks. Viki said Charlie had lied to her about who he was, but Ben reminded her that he had done the same when they first met. Viki lamented that she was tired of the constant fighting, and the hardship and struggle of life. Ben countered that the struggle and the fight was what made life great, and worth living. He reminded her of the anthem she had sung to win the karaoke contest at Crossroads: \"I Will Survive.\" He told Viki that was what she had to do. He asked her to \"search your heart\" and ask herself if Dorian really slept with Charlie, and Viki found that she didn't believe Dorian's allegations. Ben urged her to work things out with Charlie, and said that though she had her time with Ben, she still had plenty of living to do-with Charlie. He pushed her to give life another chance, and promised that he'd be there waiting for her when it really was Viki's time. \"I'll always be here,\" Ben said, putting his hand over Viki's heart. \n\n\nSuddenly, the television over the bar flickered to life, and the adult ghost of Megan Victoria appeared onscreen, asking if Viki's decision was made. Ben confirmed that Viki had chosen life, and Megan Victoria said she would meet Viki \"downstairs,\" but that she and \"Aunt Megan\" had \"put something together in the editing room\" just for Ben and Viki. The television then played a touching montage of memories from Ben and Viki's life together. After the remembrance ended, Ben and Viki pledged to see each other \"next time,\" and embraced passionately. \n\n\nAs she held Ben, Viki opened her eyes and found herself back with Megan Victoria, descending in the \"elevator.\" Megan told her grandmother that she was pleased Viki had chosen to go back to life, but suddenly the elevator shook, and Megan realized they were stuck. \n\n\nBack in real life, David and Dorian bickered over Viki in the woods. Dorian explained the situation and said that Viki was already dead. David begged Dorian to use her medical skills to try to save her nemesis, and said that he needed Viki. Dorian bristled at his sentiments, but when David swore he would divorce Addie if Dorian complied, she reconsidered. Dorian didn't know if she could trust David's word, but David spoke from the heart, telling Dorian he still cared for her and had an unbreakable bond with his ex, and that he married Addie to drive her crazy; he said she had nothing to be jealous of in his friendship with Viki. Dorian finally agreed to try again; rummaging through her medical bag, she found a mysteriously placed syringe full of adrenaline, unaware that Mel, looming behind her, had placed it there. Dorian raised the syringe over her head, then plunged it into Viki's heart. \n\n\nIn the afterlife, the elevator began to move again, and Viki and Megan Victoria continued their rapid descent \"back to life.\" They said their goodbyes, and Viki marveled at her beautiful granddaughter (as played by Erin Torpey), saying that she didn't just remind her of Jessica, but that it was \"something more.\" As the women embraced, everything faded to white. \n\n\nBack in the woods, Viki roused and woke in David's arms. David thanked Dorian for her efforts, while beside her, Mel held his beloved wife. \"You did good, kid,\" Mel said. \"I'm proud of you.\" The ghostly Mel stole away into the mists, but not before Dorian tearfully blew him a kiss. \n\n\nIn Mendorra, Sarah was set adrift on the falls as Cristian and Tina could only stand by and watch. Cristian and Sarah declared their undying love while Carlo gloated about his triumph, ignoring Tina's pleas for mercy. When Cristian broke free from Carlo's henchmen, Carlo trained a gun on him, but Tina clobbered Carlo and Cris dove into the raging waters, swimming to Sarah's rescue. Unfortunately, by the time he got to Sarah and joined her on the raft, the currents were too strong; they were both going to go over the falls! Carlo rejoiced, while Tina watched in horror. On the raft, Cristian and Sarah kissed passionately, and then the raft was sent careening over the deadly falls, history repeating itself. \n\n\nBack in \"Agnes'\" office in Heaven, Agnes watched the proceedings and examined the script, gravely concerned about Cristian and Sarah's survival. She was sure they couldn't make it-or could they? A familiar voice asked who her \"boss\" was talking to, and Agnes looked up to come face to face with Erika Slezak, complete with monogrammed robe and bunny slippers. Agnes said she was just talking to \"them,\" without whom, \"there would be no Llanview.\" Erika said they were both so grateful to \"them\" (the audience) for giving them \"all this.\" Then, Erika Slezak and Agnes Nixon broke character and turned to the camera to address the audience, proclaiming, \"Happy 40th anniversary, One Life to Live!\" With that, Agnes clicked her remote control off, ending the show. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Rex both experience the \"Blast from the past\" and live on Asa's ranch in 1968. People know Bo as Asa and Rex as Bo. Two people who look like Gigi and Shane enter. Rex and Bo both assume they are the people they know them to be. But Gigi reveals she's not herself, knows nothing about Rex, and knows Bo as Asa. She is Emma Bradley, mother of both Spencer Truman and David Vickers. We see that Shane is young Spencer. But David has not yet been born. And Bo reminds Rex if he (as Asa) refuses to sleep with \"Emma\", then David Vickers will never be born. Viki is also on a \"journey in the afterlife\". Ben Davidson tells her it's not her time yet. She must return to her life. And at that time, David Vickers tells Dorian she must save Viki. He will divorce Addie if she does. And Dorian knows she has no choice. SO Viki comes back to reality. And at that point, it looks like Carlo Hesser has killed Cristian and Sarah. But Agnes Nixon concludes that they might survive going down a waterfall no differently than Viki survived her near brush with death.",
