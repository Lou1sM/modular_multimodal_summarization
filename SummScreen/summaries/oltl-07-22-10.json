Gigi followed and assured Natalie that she understood how it felt to be pregnant, but at least Natalie wasn't alone. She wanted to help and assured Natalie she wouldn't tell anyone anything, not even Rex. Natalie filled her in on what happened the night she and Brody had sex. \"No harm, no foul,\" she said. Both of them had too much to drink and thought they would never see their loved ones again, therefore it wasn't cheating. Little did they know that everyone would be reunited later that evening, Natalie with John, and Brody with Jessica.\n\n\nNatalie assured Gigi that the night meant nothing to either herself or Brody, and they'd made a pact to keep it a secret so as not to hurt anyone. She and John had sex eventually and the dates were close enough that she couldn't figure out who the father could be. She was sick over it, especially since John and she were happy, as were Jessica and Brody. She didn't see any way out and would have to tell both John and Jessica about that night. She wondered if John even wanted a baby, especially after just losing one with Marty. He would feel trapped, and maybe it wasn't even his, Natalie considered.\n\n\nGigi spoke calmly and declared that Natalie had only been with Brody one time. She thought that Natalie would have to tell the truth and, though there was a test to determine paternity, they would have to wait until she was 16 weeks pregnant. Natalie repeated that she and Brody hadn't cheated on anyone. Obviously, people would notice her pregnancy before the 16 weeks drew close.\n\n\nJohn and Brody spent some free time at Rodi's, playing pool and talking about work. They discussed Hannah, and Brody felt strongly that John should want Hannah to pay if she killed his baby. John added that something wasn't right with Eli, and Brody offered to keep his eyes open and check up on the attorney. The guys chuckled when they realized that Natalie and Gigi had stepped outside to chat; they didn't understand how women had so much to talk about. Much to Brody's surprise, John disclosed that Natalie was a professional pool player. John teased that Natalie must have hustled Brody when he played a game with her.\n\n\nTurning serious, Brody told John that he had something to say. He wanted John to understand how grateful he was to be a cop and admitted couldn't have done it without John and Bo. John shrugged him off and reminded Brody that he was already in the academy on his own when John pulled him for the special detail. Brody had John's trust completely.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Kelly was overjoyed when Jessica disclosed she was pregnant, however, Jessica was less than jubilant. She admitted that she didn't know who the father was and so hadn't told Brody the news. The women were interrupted when Langston's phone began to ring. Kelly picked it up and noted that Ford was calling. She wished he would get lost. \n\n\nSuddenly, it dawned on her that Jessica thought that Ford might be the father of her baby. She reminded Jessica that Jessica didn't have sex with Ford, but Jessica wasn't sure. She couldn't remember what happened after she stopped Ford, since the next thing she recalled was being at her father's place. She had no idea of what had happened in between.\n\n\nKelly stressed that Ford himself stated there was no sex, but Jessica thought he might have lied, since he could have been looking at a charge of rape. Kelly had an idea, and she texted Ford from Langston's phone. She would get to the truth once and for all, and she urged Jessica to hide when Ford showed up. Jessica just wanted to get the truth.\n\n\nAt the hospital and unable to reach Langston on the phone, Ford left her a message and said he missed her and wanted to talk to her. He walked into James's room as a nurse checked the young man's vital signs. James was happy to hear he was doing well because, without insurance, he needed to be discharged. The nurse informed him that an anonymous donor had paid the bill. The men wondered who it could be, and Ford suggested that it might have been Starr's rich father. James asked who Ford had been yelling at in the hallway, but just then, Ford received a text message and had to leave.\n\n\nGreg ran after Dani as she fled his office because she was upset that he wouldn't even look into alternatives to try to help her mother. He explained he had been to the site she was on, and the treatment described could make her mother worse. He admitted he had searched everywhere and talked to people worldwide regarding alternative treatments. He thought the best thing that Dani could do would be to spend lots of time with her mother.\n\n\nNate saw his mother sitting in the park, and she admitted she was looking for an apartment for the two of them. She wanted to move before their house was foreclosed. She had given the money to James for his hospital bill, she explained, because she didn't want him to suffer from her mistakes. She saw Ford, too, but Nate was glad she didn't give the money to him. He was a jerk, Nate perceived. Inez implored Nate not to judge Ford, since he wasn't familiar with the man's past. She refused to discuss it any further, citing her appointment with a realtor. Nate was supposed to meet Dani and, just as he tried to call her, she arrived in tears.\n\n\nShe had been sure she could find a cure for her mother online, but Dr. Evans had rejected her ideas, she cried. She had other news, and she told him that Todd and T\u00e9a were getting married. Nate wondered if that was a good or a bad thing. Dani thought that if her mother was happy then she was okay with it. She couldn't get over how frightened she felt every time she said goodbye to her mother. She always wondered if it would be the last time she would see her. Nate didn't think it would work like that.\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a relaxed at the Palace after making love. Todd wondered what else T\u00e9a wanted to do before she died, and she realized that he finally believed she would die soon. Todd noted that everyone was going to die. She understood that he wanted her to have a \"bucket list,\" and she suggested that he and Dani get along. He wanted her to pick something for herself, but T\u00e9a confessed she never thought about it. Todd inquired about her childhood dreams, and her response of being successful drew a drawn-out \"boring\" from him.\n\n\nAcknowledging T\u00e9a's childhood fantasies, the pair had a carefree and lighthearted day, which ran the gamut from phone pranks to stealing food from the room service cart to playing with a hula hoop. \"Stolen food tastes better,\" T\u00e9a declared as they munched on their meal. She announced that she wanted to take a road trip with Todd and Dani.\n\n\nTodd called Dani, who was scared when she answered the phone. He advised her that her mother wanted to do something special and they had somewhere to go. Dani asked if she could take Nate along. Todd began to turn her down but as T\u00e9a entered the room to stand next to him, he sweetly told Dani that would be fine.\n\n\nFord turned up at La Boulaie and asked to see Langston. Kelly admitted she was the one who sent the message, and she wanted to talk to him about Jessica. Ford was annoyed and insisted that he wanted nothing to do with her. Kelly thought he might need a blood test as Jessica had a communicable disease. It was Hepatitis C and if he had sex with her, he could have picked it up. Ford was adamant; he did not have sex with Jessica. He had never thought about asking a woman such personal information, but he would do so in the future. Kelly didn't think he seemed like the type who would ask. After he left, the woman were ecstatic.\n\n\nThey were finally certain that Jessica didn't have sex with Ford. Kelly was sure he would have \"lost it\" if he had. They joked that he didn't realize that he couldn't really catch Hepatitis C that easily in that way.\n\n\nAs James slept in his hospital bed, Inez walked in and gazed at him. He stirred and looked up at her. \"Who are you? Do I know you?\" he asked. Inez admitted he didn't, but she confessed that she was the one his brother had yelled at. James wondered why, and she stated that Ford didn't want her to see James. She disclosed that her son was the one who stole James's money, and James understood why Ford had \"flipped out.\" Inez wanted James to blame her for all that had happened to him, but James was confused.\n\n\nIt was \"too little too late\" for her to be there, Inez continued. James realized she was the anonymous donor, but Inez insisted that it was really his money to begin with. She felt bad and apologized for his life. James claimed that he would have taken the money just like Nate did. She wanted him to make sure to collect any change that was over and above his bill. She noted that Ford seemed to be protective of him, and James indicated that Ford was like that when he wanted to be. He revealed that things had been difficult at home.\n\n\nFord returned to the hospital and stopped one of the nurses he was acquainted with. He asked her if he would be able to obtain a blood test to check for Hepatitis C.\n\n\nJames and Inez shook hands as she turned to go. She found it difficult to let go and she apologized for \"all of it.\" He pointed out that he had stolen the money from his father in the first place, so he wasn't honest either. He wanted her to stop apologizing. \"I wish,\" she replied. She headed out the door just as Ford reached the room. \n\n\nShe turned her head and walked by. James asked if Ford had seen her, and Ford wanted to know what had happened. James revealed that the woman had apologized for everything she ever did, \"even breathing,\" and she was the one who had paid his bill. Ford was livid, but when James added that she was Nate's mother, Ford was stunned. James wanted him to make amends with the nice lady.\n\n\nFord left on the premise of locating Inez, but once outside of James's room, he could barely stand up. \"She had another kid? We have a brother,\" he whispered.\n\n\nBrody received a phone call from Jessica. She told him she was on her way to Rodi's, and she had a surprise for him. Natalie pulled John aside and told him she had news and didn't know where to begin. John took one look at her and asked what was wrong. She was nervous and appeared ill. A happy Jessica arrived and told Brody to sit down.\n\n\nT\u00e9a, Todd, Dani, and Nate stood on the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building and peered out. Dani made fun of her mother for growing up in New York City and never visiting the building. T\u00e9a remarked that she always thought of it as a tourist attraction. Dani thanked Todd for making her mother happy. \"That's the plan,\" Todd replied.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nate's mom carries her secret that she has two other sons. She goes to see James without revealing to him who she is and assures him that she will take care of his shotpail bill. Assuming that she is Nate's mom and a stranger to him, James is grateful and receptive to her but confused for why she apologizes and believes what happened to him is her fault. He then informs Robert Ford that \"that woman\" is Nate's mom, having no clue that she is also his and his brother's mom. When Robert Ford hears that, he is shocked to find out that their mom has another son. Tea and Todd talk about all of the fun things that she wants and needs to do before she dies. And they invite Dani and Nate to come with them to the Empire State building. Both Natalie and Jessica find out they are pregnant and are both worried; Natalie that it could be Brody's and Jessica that it could be Ford's. Natalie has no way of finding out who her baby's father is. Kelly has an idea to clarify to Jessica whether she slept with Ford the night in question so she invites him over and informs him that Jessica has Hepatitis C. Ford does not appear worried. Kelly and Jessica are both assured that that must mean that Jessica never slept with Ford. However, he secretly goes to the clinic to get checked out for Hepatitis C as soon as he finds out.",
