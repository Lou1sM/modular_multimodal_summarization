She tells Rex about the handshake with Vincent and how Tate wiped his hand afterwards and the incident at the funeral home with the director. Rex gets jumpy and  wants to know if Tate has threatened her - she tells him he hasn't - but she tells him there's more and she tells him about the medallion she found in Tate's backpack. She is worried because she's let Tate into her life and how horribly he reacted when she confronted him about the OPP medal but that she did get him to agree to toss it out. They decide to go down to the police department to talk to Bo about Tate, but Adriana is worried because they don't have anything concrete and she's scared. Rex tells her it's a good thing she's scared because then she'll be likely to be more careful.\n\n\nLayla and Vincent show up at her apartment and she has the feeling that there's someone there (Tate is hiding in the closet). She checks and says that it was just her neighbors she was hearing because she had left her window open. She tells Vincent that she doesn't want Tate to be a part of Xposed anymore and she's going to talk to Adriana and ask her to stay away from Tate, just to be safe. Vincent tells her he thinks that's a good idea and he'll do anything he can to protect Layla. He tells Layla she needs to do something for herself and he has a surprise for her but she has to change into one of her best dresses and he'll come back to pick her up. She agrees and when she turns around after he's left, Tate is standing there and she asks him how he got in.\n\n\nMiles is moping in his holding cell, with the ghost of Spencer in his head taunting him, telling him he should have killed Todd when he had the chance and he wouldn't be in this situation. Miles says all he wanted was to be accepted and to have a family but he did things Spencer's way and things always go wrong.\n\n\nJohn and Blair are at the campground still looking for Todd, who Hunter has dragged to a cheap motel room and tossed liquor on, but John and Blair only find drag marks and figured Todd has been moved.  Todd manages to call Blair from the motel room phone, and John has it traced and they arrive at the motel and kick down the door to find a naked woman in bed with Todd.\n\n\nCole keeps trying to apologize to Starr but it's not working. She tells him that Britney was right, that Cole was lying to her and that he lied about helping her. She doesn't believe that he loves her, she hates him and wants him to leave. Starr tells him that the only way to fix things is for him to go back and time and do the right thing, but it's too late and he can't do that so she wants him out, but he refuses to leave until she sees his side. He tells her that he was trying to keep his mom out of jail but she tells him that jail time and death are not even close to being the same. They bicker more about their parents and Cole yells \"Why should I pick your dad when he raped my mom?!\" Starr is shocked and tells him that her dad is different now. Cole tells Starr that Miles wanted him to kill Todd, but that he wouldn't do it. He was planning on walking out and going to the police when Miles played the tape with Marty's confession on it and started blackmailing him over his mother's safety. Once Starr realizes that Miles wanted Todd dead and had asked Cole to do it, it may be too late to save her dad and tells Cole if her dad dies it's all on him - she kicks him out finally and still hasn't heard from her mom.\n\n\n",
