Before Michael went into the exam room, to assess Viki's condition, Dorian told him what steps she had taken to restart Viki's heart. While Michael was with Viki, Dorian reminded David of their bargain. David had agreed to divorce Addie in exchange for Dorian saving Viki's life. To Dorian's delight, they were soon joined by an associate from the law firm she that had on a retainer. He had annulment papers with him, which he handed to Dorian. David was reluctant to sign the papers because he was worried about Addie's reaction. Dorian wasn't swayed and insisted that David sign the papers and keep her name out of it when David told Addie about the end of their marriage. As soon as David finished signing the papers, his cell phone rang. It was Clint, asking to see David. \n\n\nMichael told Viki that her heart had stopped and that she had been clinically dead for a short period of time. When Viki credited Ben with saving her life, Michael agreed. Ben's heart had been strong enough to respond to the lifesaving shot of epinephrine. \n\n\nBefore leaving the hospital, David took a moment to visit Viki. Viki smiled when she saw her friend walk into her room. David appeared just as happy to see Viki. He told her how much she meant to him and how afraid he had been when she had been \"dead.\" Viki was touched by David's sweet words and thanked him for saving her life. To Viki's surprise, David told her that Dorian had saved her life, not him. Shortly after David left, Michael returned to update Viki on her condition. Before he left, Viki asked Michael if Dorian was still at the hospital. \n\n\nStarr and Langston were in Starr's bedroom, hanging out. Starr told Langston about Marcie's decision to adopt Starr's baby after it was born. Langston seemed genuinely happy that her friend had found a home for her baby. Unfortunately the news wasn't all good as Starr filled Langston in on the court's ruling and the complication that Todd posed. The subject then switched to Langston. Langston and Starr shared laughs as they watched Markko's video of Langston's attempt to seduce David Vickers. Starr couldn't believe that Langston had gone to such lengths to help Dorian. Langston shrugged it off and then noticed that Starr's baby bump. \n\n\nTheir conversation came full-circle as Starr began talking about the baby. Starr believed that she was going to have a boy. As she talked, Starr expressed her desire to have an opportunity to explain her side of things to the baby. Langston looked at the camera and suggested that Starr record her message to the baby. They quickly set the camera up and Starr began talking to her baby. Starr explained that she intended to have his adoptive mother show him the tape when he was 16 and old enough to understand. \n\n\nCole and Markko were at the diner. They discussed Cole's decision to fight for custody of his unborn child. Markko understood Cole's reasons for telling Todd about the baby but he didn't think Todd would be eager to see Cole raise the baby himself. Cole agreed and told his friend that his missed his mother's counsel and support. Cole was confident that Marty would know what to do about Todd. Markko briefly changed the subject and told Cole about the incident in Dorian's bedroom, when Langston tried to seduce David. Markko was a bit concerned about something that Langston had said about younger men and sex. Markko quickly realized that it might be insensitive, given Cole's situation with Starr, and apologized. Cole dismissed Markko's concerns but admitted that he missed the way things were between him and Starr, before the baby. Markko suggested that they could be that way again, if Cole agreed to the adoption. Cole didn't agree. He told Markko that there would always be a baby and he couldn't forget that. \n\n\nMarcie stopped by John's apartment to drop some clothes off for Michael. She was disappointed when John told her that Michael had already left for work. John seemed to take pity on Marcie and invited her inside. Marcie entered and started talking about Michael. She told John that she wanted Michael back. She said that it might seem that she was choosing adoption over her marriage but insisted that she wasn't. Michael was making it an issue when it didn't need to be. John gently told Marcie that he didn't think that the adoption would be a problem for Michael if the baby weren't Todd's grandchild. Marcie agreed but insisted that she desperately wanted to be a mother. Marcie tried to explain how much being a mother meant to her as John quietly listened. He was understanding and sympathetic, but gently told her that he supported Michael's decision. Marcie was teary-eyed as she asked John to take care of Michael and then left. \n\n\nIn Marty's room, Marty sensed that Todd was brooding and asked him what was troubling him. Todd grumbled about Starr's pregnancy and told Marty that he only wanted to protect his daughter but no one saw that. While they talked, Todd accidentally revealed that Marty had been a psychiatrist. Marty was annoyed that Todd had not told her sooner. Todd defended himself, insisting it wasn't important because she couldn't do anything about it. \n\n\nSparked by the desire to learn more about herself, Marty began asking Todd questions about her college life. Todd said little as he had flashbacks to the night that Marty was raped, when she was dancing and having a good time. Eventually, Todd did tell Marty that she had been his tutor and then claimed that they had been lovers once. Marty was surprised but recovered quickly. Todd went on to tell her that she had once told him that he was not good in bed. Marty felt bad and apologized for hurting him. She continued to question him about the past until Todd revealed to Marty that she had been raped. \n\n\nClint was in his den, nursing a drink, when Nora walked in. Clint was distracted with thoughts of business. He was trying to figure out a way to oust Dorian from Buchanan Enterprises. Clint was flirting with the idea of telling David that he was Asa's son. As he and Nora talked, Clint came up with the idea to have David force Dorian to sign the company back over to the Buchanans. In return, David would agree to divorce Addie. With the Buchanans back in control of the company, Clint could pay David off. \n\n\nLater, when David arrived at the Buchanan mansion, Clint offered David $10,000,000.00 to divorce Addie.\n\n\n",
