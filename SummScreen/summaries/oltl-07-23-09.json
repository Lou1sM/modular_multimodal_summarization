Reminding Starr that his undercover work began that day, Cole told her that he didn't want to risk anyone observing him leaving Starr's home.  As Cole prepared to leave La Boulaie unnoticed, Starr and Cole overheard Todd talking to Hope over the baby monitor.  The teens nearly panicked when Todd announced to his granddaughter that he was taking her to visit T\u00e9a, but first they would wake Starr.\n\n\nAs Todd prepared to exit Hope's bedroom, Dorian entered and lashed out at Todd for having sex with Blair in the cabana.  Horrified to learn of her parent's indiscretion, Starr stormed into Hope's bedroom and confronted Todd. Removing Hope from Todd's arms, Starr scolded him about discussing sex in front of the baby.   Starr also chastised her father about having sex with Blair. When Starr blurted out that her sex life was none of Todd's business, Todd became suspicious and questioned Starr's statement.  Changing the subject, Starr advised Todd that she wouldn't allow him to use Hope to impress T\u00e9a.\n\n\nAfter Starr left, Dorian continued to criticize Todd for taking advantage of Blair.  To Dorian's surprise, Todd admitted that he wanted to repair his relationship with T\u00e9a.  Dorian related that she could help Todd win T\u00e9a back.  Insisting that T\u00e9a would never feel comfortable with Todd and Blair living under the same roof together, Dorian suggested that Todd and T\u00e9a move in together.  With a smirk, Todd listened to Dorian's plan.\n\n\nStarr returned to the bedroom with Hope.  Pleased to see his daughter, Cole gave her a hug and stated how proud he was of Hope.  When Starr suggested that they share some family time together, Cole announced that he had to meet John.  Cole stated that John was ready to discuss the undercover case with him.  Starr asked Cole when they would be able to spend more time together.  \n\n\nIn a grim tone, Cole told Starr that for her own safety, it might be best if they pretended to have ended their relationship.  Cole advised Starr that the case would be concluded within the next thirty days.  Hoping to cheer her up, Cole stated that they would be a family after the drug case was solved.  As Hope cried, Cole said an emotional goodbye to Starr and his daughter.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, while Nora worried about the lawsuit that Matthew had filed against them, Bo was convinced that the case would never go to trial.  As Bo and Nora discussed the possible outcome, Matthew entered the room.  In Matthew's presence, Bo and Nora avoided any discussion of the legal matter, but a confident Matthew boasted that he would be victorious.  When his parents continued to comment that he had an uphill battle ahead, Matthew stunned them when he announced that T\u00e9a was his attorney.  Bo immediately placed a call to the ethics review board regarding T\u00e9a, and Nora raced out the door.\n\n\nDestiny arrived at the Buchanan Mansion and observed Bo and Nora's reaction to Matthew's news.  Destiny expressed her concern for Matthew's problem.  Far from upset, a smiling, Matthew blurted out, \"This is the happiest I've been since the accident.  I'm so happy, I could kiss you!\"  His remark, left both him and Destiny slightly embarrassed.\n\n\nAt Todd's residence, after receiving a call from Todd, T\u00e9a demanded that he leave her alone and hung up on him.  When Shaun questioned why T\u00e9a and Todd were feuding once again, T\u00e9a related that Todd had slept with another woman.  Before T\u00e9a could give Shaun any further details, Blair knocked on the door and demanded to speak with T\u00e9a.\n\n\nAfter Shaun left the room, Blair admitted that she had made a terrible mistake by sleeping with Todd.  Unimpressed with Blair's halfhearted apology, T\u00e9a teased Blair about her inability to maintain a relationship. Citing Blair's failed marriage to John, T\u00e9a insisted that Blair couldn't wait for the opportunity to throw herself at Todd.  Hoping to upset her nemesis, Blair insisted that Todd would never get over her.  A provoked T\u00e9a slapped Blair.\n\n\nAs the women engaged in a violent brawl, Shaun intervened and separated the two.  At the urging of the two women, a frustrated Shaun left them alone to continue their discussion.  Unable to resolve their differences, Blair and T\u00e9a continued to battle.   After trashing Todd's home, Blair walked towards the door and stood face-to-face with Nora. Exiting the house, Blair looked at Nora and exclaimed, \"She's all yours!\"\n\n\nCriticizing T\u00e9a's decision to represent Matthew, Nora accused T\u00e9a of using Matthew's problem to cause Nora pain.  Realizing that T\u00e9a was adamant about pursuing Matthew's case, Nora pleaded with her to reconsider.  A sympathetic T\u00e9a suggested that Nora take the time to listen to her son's argument.  In tears, Nora cried, \"You'll have a child of your own one day and then you'll understand how I feel!\"  Opening the door to leave, Nora stood face-to-face with Todd.\n\n\nT\u00e9a refused to speak with Todd and instructed him to leave.  On bended knee, a nervous Todd opened a ring box and gazed up at T\u00e9a.\n\n\nBlair returned home and encountered Dorian, who was less than pleased to learn that Blair had paid a visit to T\u00e9a at Todd's home.  Dorian listened as Blair ranted about T\u00e9a's constant interference in her life.  Blair commented that she didn't have to worry about ever seeing T\u00e9a in her home again.  Dorian warned her niece, \"I have something to tell you.  You better sit down!\"\n\n\nWhen Rachel knocked on Greg's door at the Palace Hotel, she was surprised to find him in his underwear, and his colleague, Dr. Wright, in his bed.  After Dr. Wright dressed and excused herself, Greg invited Rachel to join him for breakfast in his room.  Rachel declined his offer, but Greg pointed out that the breakfast had been ordered.  During breakfast, Rachel thanked Greg for saving Brenden's life and praised Greg's medical skills.  Greg suggested that Rachel attempt to convince Bo and Nora to allow him to operate on Matthew.  Refusing to get involved, Rachel commented that Greg should talk to Matthew's parents himself.  Although Rachel was convinced that Bo and Nora would never agree to the surgery, Greg believed that Destiny was capable of changing their minds.\n\n\nGreg accidentally spilled a glass of water on Rachel's blouse.  When Rachel stepped into the bathroom to tend to the stain, Shaun knocked on the door.  Noticing that the table was set for two, Shaun realized that Greg had company, but insisted on speaking with his brother for a few moments.  Shaun expressed that he was pleased with Greg's decision to remain in Llanview.  Shaun was startled when Rachel entered the room while tucking her blouse in her skirt.  Enraged, Shaun placed his hands around Greg's neck and began choking him.   Pleading with Shaun to release his grip on Greg, Rachel informed Shaun that nothing had happen between her and Greg.\n\n\nAfter Rachel explained what had taken place, Shaun apologized to Rachel and his brother for his behavior.  An angry Greg screamed, \"Do you think I would make a move on your woman?\"  Interrupting the confusion inside Greg's hotel room, Matthew and Destiny arrived and announced that they had good news.  Rachel was surprised when Matthew informed Greg that he would be performing Matthew's surgery.\n\n\nClint paid Viki a visit at Llanfair.  Citing his recent problems with Nora and Bo, Clint told Viki that she and Charlie might be walking down the aisle without him and Nora.  Viki told Clint that he needed to realize that Nora hadn't chosen Bo over him.  Viki urged Clint to apologize to his wife and brother-or risk not getting married.\n\n\nBack at the Buchanan Mansion, Nora returned home and told Bo about her encounter with T\u00e9a.  Nora admitted that her conversation with T\u00e9a had left her with several questions.  A tearful Nora didn't understand the intense anger that had consumed Matthew.  Nora couldn't believe that her son would rather be dead than confined to a wheelchair. Embracing Nora, Bo reminded her that they hadn't lost Matthew.  As Bo consoled Nora, Clint entered the room and apologized for his behavior.  After Bo accepted his apology, Clint asked his brother to be his best man.  To Clint's surprise, Nora announced, \"I can't marry you tomorrow!\"\n\n\n",
