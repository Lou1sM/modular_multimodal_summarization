    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Evangeline's hospital room, Layla told Cristian that since Evangeline had taken the time to make a living will, they should honor it, as Attorney Suzanne White knocked on the door.  As they walked into the hall, Layla explained to Suzanne that Evangeline had been in a coma, due to carbon monoxide poisoning, and that Evangeline had created a living will.  Layla asked, \"So, what can I do to make sure my sister's wishes are respected?\"  \n\n\nLayla stressed to Suzanne that Lisa had been caring for Evangeline at home, which made the decision difficult.  However, Layla admitted that she would keep Evangeline in the hospital forever, if she knew that was what Evangeline would have wanted, but that the living will indicated that Evangeline would want them to \"let her go.\"  Suzanne disagreed and stated that they needed to consider the reason why the living will had never been witnessed or filed with the court.  Layla sadly acknowledged that no one in the family knew what Evangeline would have wanted under the circumstances.\n\n\nWhen she was alone with Cristian in the hall, Layla wondered if Evangeline would want to live in her condition and admitted that she was uncertain.  Layla accepted that maybe her mom had been right.  Cristian realized that he could not advise Layla, because as Catholics, the Vegas would be unable to take any action of that type in a similar situation.  However, Cristian told Layla that he supported her no matter what she decided.  Lisa Williamson walked in the hall and announced that she would no longer fight Layla, and that she would let her baby die.\n\n\nFrom La Boulaie, Kelly talked to Rex on the phone, as Rex arrived at his Boston, Massachusetts, hotel room door.  As Eli listened in the hall, unseen, Rex indicated that he was to meet the hall records clerk.  After Rex walked into his room, Eli received a phone call from Lisa, who was calling from Silver Spring, Maryland, for Attorney Bennett Thompson.  Lisa explained about Evangeline and the living will and stated that she wanted to prevent Layla from enforcing it.  \n\n\nEli explained that he would be unable to help Lisa, since he had drawn up the will for Evangeline.  Eli believed that the fact that Evangeline had not filed the will was just a \"mere technicality.\" He questioned how a battle over the living will would affect Lisa's relationship with her other daughter.  Lisa sadly voiced that she did not know.\n\n\nInside his hotel room, Rex told Kelly that he would find the person who killed Melinda.  Later, Rex called Gigi and told her that he hoped to be away for only a day or two and asked her to kiss Shane for him.  When a waiter wheeled a tray of food to just outside Rex's room, Eli tipped him and sent him on his way.  Eli then picked up a knife from the tray.  \n\n\nRex answered the door to a knock but found no one outside the door.  Rex carried in the tray of food. Eli opened the door of the room across the hall and held a medicine bottle and eyedropper.  As he searched his computer, Rex ate the meal and then got very blurry-eyed.  As Rex lay passed out on the bed, Eli yelled, \"Room service,\" and walked into Rex's room.\n\n\nIn the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Darren fawned over Destiny, as David strolled in.  When David joined them at their table, Darren claimed that he was on a date with Destiny, and that Destiny had no idea how hot she really was.  David offered, \"Count your blessings.  It's the ones that think they're God's gift you've got to worry about,\" when the waitress carried out a huge banana split.   David repeatedly called Darren \"Darrell,\" and Darren told David his name was Darren. David replied, \"Like on Bewitched,\" a television show that neither Destiny nor Darren could possibly have remembered.  \n\n\nDavid revealed that he needed Destiny's advice, and Destiny realized that Dorian had hurt David again.  David denied that it had been Dorian who had hurt him, and stressed that it had actually been Viki, who was \"a pillar of the community, the defender of the downtrodden, the patron saint of fairness,\" and his friend.  David was hurt that Viki had deceived him and declared that he needed a few moments to himself.  After David walked away, Darren asked, \"Didn't I tell you that these people are crazy?\"\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian typed on the computer that she denied the existence of \"Charlian\" and declared that Charlie Banks's contract with the city had been terminated.  Dorian cried, \"Charlie Banks, I'll get you,\" as Kelly popped her head in the door and mimicked, \"And your little dog too.  Ooh, hoo, hoo.\"  Dorian asked Kelly for advice on her headline and decreed that Charlie was not worthy of public trust, because he had toyed with her heart.  Dorian blamed both Viki and Charlie.  \"They are going to learn it is a big mistake to cross Dorian Lord.\"  \n\n\nWhen Kelly stated that she could not imagine Viki and Charlie \"concocting schemes,\" Dorian told her of their scheme for Dorian to find Viki and David in bed.  Kelly felt that Dorian must have misinterpreted the situation, however, Dorian exclaimed that Viki's outward appearance was all for public relations.  \"In private, behind closed doors, she's doing down and dirty in the mud.\"  \n\n\nKelly believed that Viki and Charlie's scheme had been to get Dorian and David back together again, because Dorian was head over heels in love with David.  Kelly maintained that David had held a huge part of Dorian's heart for years, and that Dorian was just upset that David had not yet made the first move.  Dorian asserted that she would make the first move and keyed a message on her My Face page.  \"That should put an end to the stupid speculation once and for all.\"\n\n\nOnce David returned to the table in the caf\u00e9, he insisted, \"Now, don't get me wrong.  I have no problem being a human sex toy, as long as the woman is ready to play, but Viki was faking -- just some ploy to reunite me with Dorian.\"  Destiny speculated that Viki probably felt that it was what David had wanted and reminded David that he had poured his heart out about Dorian to Destiny on the plane to London.  Destiny believed that Dorian probably felt the same way about David and then pointed out that David had just polished off a large banana split meant for two people.  As Darren viewed his phone, he found Dorian's message on her My Face page.\n\n\n\"Mayor Dorian Lord is not now, has never been, and never will be in love with David Vickers.\"  David screamed, \"That's Buchanan to you, sweetheart.\"  David wondered why Dorian would invite \"Dilbert\" onto her My Face page and was upset that Dorian did not \"friend\" him.  When Darren tried to retrieve his phone, David informed \"Darrell\" that he would return the phone when he was finished using it.\n\n\nKelly expressed that Dorian was acting like a baby by lashing out against David.  Dorian then received a response to her message.  \"Darren Price sez david vickers wouldn't take dorina lord back if she crawled across broken glass.\"  Dorian demanded to call security, because \"some vile hacker\" was committing a cyber crime.  Kelly replied, \"Wake up and smell the syntax, Dorian, okay...this has David Vickers written all over it.\"  Another message followed, \"Darren Price also sez david is too hewt for dorina anyway.\"  Kelly thought it was cute that \"Darren\" had spelled hot, \"hewt.\"  When Dorian's daughter, Cassie, responded with the message, \"Cassie thinks mother should suck it up and get back with David,\" Dorian cried that it was a fraud.\n\n\nKelly informed Dorian that she could change the privacy settings on her computer but warned that Todd would probably place an editorial in the Sun about Dorian perpetrating a cover-up.  Kelly kissed Dorian and left, as Dorian typed up her next message.  \"Mayor Dorian says that David Vickers is simply beneath her.\"\n\n\nAfter David responded, \"Darren Price sez dorian will never be over, or under, him again, so she should get off My Face,\" Destiny told David that he should tell Dorian that to her face.  David thanked Destiny and \"Darren,\" chipped in $2.00 towards his banana split, and left.  After the waitress carried out another banana split, Darren wondered if David had really left, but Destiny insisted that Dorian would keep David busy \"for the rest of his natural life.\"  When David arrived at La Boulaie, he stormed into the living room and demanded that Dorian step away from her computer.  \"Don't you make me come over there.\"\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Jessica hinted to Brody of her baby news.  \"I mean, what are you going to do when all hell breaks loose, and the phone's ringing, and someone's at the door, and you know, you're cooking something, and the baby's screaming...,\" when Brody observed that Bree was no longer a baby.  Jessica revealed, \"I'm not talking about Bree.  I'm pregnant.\"\n\n\nIn another area at Rodi's, when Natalie found it difficult to tell John about the baby, John asked what could be that hard to tell him.  Natalie insisted that he use his imagination.  Natalie remembered that she had told Gigi that she was not sure of the identity of the baby's father.  Natalie hoped that John would remain a patient man, after he learned of her news, and as she started to tell John, Brody howled and announced that he had just learned that he was to be a father.\n\n\nJohn congratulated Brody, and Jessica explained about how she had felt sick after eating David's muffin but had discovered that she had actually been suffering from morning sickness.  After the sisters hugged, Jessica asked about Natalie's illness.  Natalie explained that she had believed that she had caught a stomach virus but realized that it must have been sympathy morning sickness, since they were twins.  Natalie walked away, and John followed.\n\n\nJohn asked Natalie why she looked like someone had just run over her dog and wondered if it had something to do with Natalie's news.  John then ordered three beers and a ginger ale and verified from Natalie that she did want a beer.  Natalie replied, \"Yeah...of course.\"  John asked Natalie for her news, and Natalie responded that her news was nothing compared to Jessica's.  Gigi dropped a glass, which broke, and John carried the drinks to Jessica and Brody.\n\n\nNatalie told Gigi that Jessica was pregnant and stated that she could not see how she could just \"walk over there and be like...hey, Brody might be the father of my baby, too.\"  At the table, John asked Brody if he was ready to be a father, and Brody declared that he was more than ready.  However, Brody felt bad for being so elated at his news, when John had just lost a baby.  John insisted that he was fine and that he just wanted for Brody to enjoy the feeling.  John remarked, \"Maybe I'll get another chance someday.\"  \n\n\nJohn called out to Natalie, who stated that she would \"be right there.\"  Gigi reminded Natalie that the odds were that the baby was John's and handed Natalie a gin and tonic -- minus the gin.  Natalie walked back to the table, and the four of them toasted Jessica, Brody, and the baby.\n\n\nWhen Brody declared that any name for either a boy or girl would go with Lovett, such as Lance Lovett or Latoya Lovett, they all groaned, as Natalie excused herself to get another round.  Natalie told Gigi that she had to get away from all of the baby talk.  \"They expect me to be jumping up and down, like good old Aunt Natalie, but I can't...I can't think about anything but this.\"  Gigi advised, \"You've got to get it out in the open.  Tell John.  It's the only way to go.\"  When Natalie said, \"No, there is another way,\" Gigi asked, \"Like what?\"  Natalie answered, \"Don't tell John.  I can get an abortion.\" \n\n\n",
