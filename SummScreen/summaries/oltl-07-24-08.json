She explained why she had made the decision to give her baby up for adoption. When Starr finished recording her message, Langston urged Starr to call Cole and make peace with him. Starr refused to make the call and became angry at her friend. She ordered Langston to leave her room, but Langston stood her ground. Eventually, Starr admitted that the Cole she had seen in court, teamed up with her dad, was not someone she recognized. \n\n\nMarkko and Cole were at the diner, discussing Starr, the baby, and the adoption. Cole told Markko that he intended to find a job so that he could start making his own way in life. Markko didn't think that Todd would appreciate the effort.

However, Brody went on to tell her that he didn't think he would be returning because he felt that he wasn't an alcoholic. Brody promised that he would find another way to deal with his drinking issues. Gigi was relieved to hear it and told Brody that until he did, she would not be able to trust him with Shane. Their conversation then drifted to the past and how they felt about each other. Brody had looked forward to a future with Gigi while Gigi had admired Brody for taking responsibility for another man's child. As they opened up about their feelings, their talk led to a gentle kiss. \n\n\nIn Marty's bedroom, Marty pushed Todd for details about her rape but Todd was reluctant to discuss it.

    "tvmega_recap": "Starr and Cole are still furious at each other and neither will call the other even though both Langston and Markko want them to. Todd concludes to Marty that it might be better for her to go away and start a whole new life. But she wants to know all about the rape, how it happened and whom the rapist was.
