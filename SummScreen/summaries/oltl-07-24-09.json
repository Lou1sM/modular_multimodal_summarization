Matthew told Greg to reserve a spot for him on Greg's surgical schedule, as he was suing his parents in order to be able to make his own decision regarding his life and surgery. A perturbed Rachel accused Greg of being behind Matthew's move, but Destiny admitted that it was all her idea. Shaun was mortified, while Rachel berated her brother for taking such a drastic action. Bitterly, Matthew defended his position and his right to the surgery that would enable him to walk again. He wondered if Greg would perform the surgery if Matthew won.\n\n\nGreg emphasized how important it was not to alienate his parents, as he would need them in his life for the long and difficult rehabilitation after the surgery. Rachel assured him that Matthew would not lose his family. Matthew quickly chimed in that he was losing muscle and the longer he had to wait for the surgery, the more difficult it would be to recover. Destiny agreed with him and asked the same question that Matthew had. Greg felt that the teen would have to choose whatever was more important: walking again or his family.\n\n\nRachel noted the time and announced that she had to leave for her mother's party. When Matthew indicated that he would not be attending, Rachel angrily urged him to sue Nora after her wedding, but to act like her son for the time being. Shaun was disheartened hearing about the party, because he had obtained tickets to a concert for himself and Rachel. She suggested he get rid of the tickets and accompany her to the party instead, and Shaun happily consented. Greg accepted the tickets and in turn asked Destiny to attend the concert with him. A happy Destiny said yes until Matthew expressed his own dismay. He wanted Destiny to attend the party with him. Destiny quickly told Greg she had plans.\n\n\nIn the hospital garage, Gigi showed Rex the damage that Stacy had caused to Gigi's car. They agreed that Stacy was probably not finished and they were concerned over what her next move would be. A nervous Gigi was anxious to leave, but Rex wanted to call the police and remain behind until they showed up.\n\n\nStacy let herself into Rex's apartment, still wearing the coat from the fur vault but atop a hospital gown instead of her underwear. Looking at herself in the full-length mirror, Stacy envisioned her belly in a later stage of pregnancy. She daydreamed about what would happen when Rex returned to his place and saw her standing there. She smiled as she pictured him asking for forgiveness and declaring his love for her. As he promised that he wasn't concerned about Shane and Gigi, Stacy returned to reality when Gigi walked in.\n\n\nNora advised Clint that she would be unable to marry him as scheduled because Matthew was suing her and Bo for his right to have surgery. She was too involved with the lawsuit to think about the wedding, she explained. It was possible that her son wouldn't even show up at the wedding, she added. Bo remained silent nearby as his conflicting emotions played across his face. A confused Clint didn't understand since the court date had not been set yet. He asked Bo to speak with his son and to convince him to \"hold off\" for a day. Bo was sure that he would be successful and that Matthew would appear at the wedding.\n\n\nNora felt that her wedding would be overshadowed by the lawsuit, that she didn't have the time to properly shop and put things together for her honeymoon, and that people would not be happy at the ceremony, given the situation. When Bo had to leave after receiving a phone call from Rex, Clint demanded that Nora tell him the truth. He felt that she was using the lawsuit as an excuse to postpone their nuptials.\n\n\nNora insisted that she was unable to multi-task, especially when she was too worried about the lawsuit and what would happen if the surgery were performed. Clint offered to start making phone calls, though Nora was upset about disappointing Viki and Charlie. Clint suggested they reschedule the ceremony unless she wasn't really ready at all. Nora cried and repeated that she was just too concerned and upset about the lawsuit. Clint offered to pay the doctor double his fee in order to prevent him from performing the surgery.\n\n\nNora, taken aback, suggested that would be unethical and could backfire for many reasons. When Clint offered an alternative of buying off the judge, Nora didn't laugh. Clint assured her it was a joke. He promised that he just wanted to take care of her and be good to her.\n\n\nDown on bended knee with box in hand, T\u00e9a prevented Todd from speaking.  Misunderstanding, she emphatically proclaimed that they weren't ready to walk down the aisle. Tossing her the box, Todd ordered her to open it. T\u00e9a was perplexed when she saw a key, which turned out to be for the front door of La Boulaie. Todd wanted her to move into La Boulaie with him. T\u00e9a suggested he look around at the destruction that Blair had caused in his house, and she vowed to fight with Blair the next time she saw her. T\u00e9a told Todd how much she hated him for having sex with Blair.\n\n\nTodd admitted that he was asking her to move in with him because he wanted her as much as she wanted him. He made it clear that he needed to stay at La Boulaie for his kids, but the judge's order didn't state that he had to be devoted to Blair. He felt that Blair should see that he and T\u00e9a were together. He even suggested that T\u00e9a could hit Blair if Blair came on to him. He had missed T\u00e9a, he stressed. T\u00e9a wondered if he was actually missing her or wanting to \"stick it to Blair.\"\n\n\nTodd insisted that he and Dorian were on the same page and that they all wanted the same thing. \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained,\" he murmured. Gently kissing her, he urged her to think about it. Staring at the key and mulling it over, T\u00e9a finally removed the key from the box and dropped it into her bra.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian attempted to pin Blair down for a conversation when the only thing Blair wanted to do was to take a hot bath. Dorian got her niece's attention finally, when she announced that Todd was going to make T\u00e9a an offer. Once she had Blair focused and listening, she took her time in divulging the rest of the information. When Blair heard that Todd was inviting T\u00e9a to live with them, she was furious. She was in for a surprise when she attempted to enlist Dorian's help to hurt T\u00e9a and Todd when they showed up. Dorian gingerly informed Blair that the idea had been hers.\n\n\nExplaining that she felt that Blair still had feelings for Todd, Dorian thought it would be a good idea if Blair saw T\u00e9a and Todd together. She felt that it would help Blair to get over Todd. Furiously, Blair denied that she had feelings for Todd and that the sex they had in the cabana was purely for the sex. Blair promised to kill T\u00e9a instead, and Todd would be a dead man if T\u00e9a showed up. Dorian felt sure that T\u00e9a would be there.\n\n\nBo surveyed the damage to Gigi's car as Rex explained everything that had led up to Stacy's act of violence. Bo promised that Stacy would be behind bars as soon as they were able to locate her. He was annoyed that Rex hadn't called him about the car sooner, especially since Rex was unable to tell him where Stacy might be found. He stated that a restraining order was needed to keep Stacy away from Rex and his family.\n\n\nRex criticized himself for the Stacy incident but was relieved that he didn't have to touch Stacy again. Intrigued by the slip, Bo pressed for more information. Learning that Rex had sex with Stacy once, he wanted to know what Gigi's reaction had been when Rex told her. Rex confided that he had not told Gigi and never would if he didn't have to.\n\n\nWondering who Stacy was talking to, Gigi asked what Stacy meant by \"the three of us will be so happy.\" Not letting her sister speak, Gigi informed her that Rex was talking with Bo at that very moment and that Stacy would be going to prison. Stacy smiled as Gigi continued, adding that Stacy would be facing multiple charges and should stop living in her fantasy world. Gigi suddenly offered to make a deal with Stacy, indicating that she would drop all of the charges if Stacy would disappear.\n\n\nAcknowledging that she was unable to do that, Stacy advised Gigi that she was wrong when she stated that Stacy had no claims on Rex. Informed that Rex would never be hers, Stacy replied that she still had \"one card left to play\".\n\n\nRachel spoke with Nora when she returned home. She assured her mother that Matthew would be at the party. Nora revealed that while she was angry at her son, she still loved him. Rachel thought they should not talk about the lawsuit any longer but should celebrate instead. When Nora indicated that she hadn't been sleeping well, Rachel assured her mother that she did not have to marry Clint.\n\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Rex are ready to press charges against Stacy. Gigi goes to tell her it's \"all over\". She has no choice except to go to prison or to leave town and leave them alone forever in order for them to drop the charges. But, little do they know that she is pregnant. She tells Gigi it's not that simple and she does have a claim on Rex. Matthew is still determined to take his parent to court to authorize Greg to do the surgery. Nora tells Clint she cannot marry him on the day planned. Dorian tells Blair that she has an idea of how to break her niece of \"Todd addiction\" forever. Tea can move in and be with Todd. Blair tells her aunt absolutely not. Todd presents the same idea to Tea. She tells him absolutely not.",
