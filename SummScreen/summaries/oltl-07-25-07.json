Michael doesn't let them see Todd because he wants to ask Todd what he remembers. Blair tells Viki how Todd was found, passed out with a prostitute. Paige overrules Michael and says Blair and Viki can go in. Then, Paige confronts Michael about his treatment of Todd's family. Viki says Todd has cheated death again. Todd wakes up and tells Viki and Blair that they \"yak, yak, yak\" too much. Paige notices Michael's behavior is off and tells him to go home. Michael asks Paige if she knows about Marcie's infertility. She says yes. Viki asks if Todd wants anything, and he laughingly asks for more drugs. Todd says he feels hungover. Blair tells Todd how he was found and asks if he remembers anything. Todd doesn't remember the prostitute but says he remembers everything else. Paige says Marcie asked for a referral to a fertility specialist, and offers to help Michael and Marcie. Michael goes into the room as Todd remembers the crack house in Chicago and hearing the tape of the crying baby. Blair tells Todd that she and John found the tape. Todd was jumped in the crack house by someone he never saw. He doesn't remember much else. Michael asks Todd how he's feeling, and Todd says again how much he likes the drugs he's on. Viki promises they will find Todd's son. Paige asks Viki how Todd's doing, then says David wants to speak with Viki urgently. Starr arrives and has a touching father-daughter reunion. Todd apologizes for missing Starr's prom and musical. Todd asks if he would have approved of her prom date; Blair and Starr share a look and Blair covers it, saying Todd wouldn't have approved of any young man. \n\n\nLangston and Markko visit Starr to cheer her up. Starr tells them she knows Cole lied to her about knowing where Todd was. Langston sides with Starr; Markko says there's got to be something more because Cole isn't like that. Starr tells them about Marty's confession to Spencer's murder. Langston, Markko, and Starr discuss Marty's arrest and Cole's dishonesty. Markko sticks up for Cole, saying they would have done the same thing to save a parent, and tells them to give Cole the benefit of the doubt. Starr never wants to see Cole again. Starr's phone rings: it's Blair, who says Todd's been found and he's going to be okay. \n\n\nCole visits Marty in jail. Cole says he could kill Miles. Marty says she did something wrong and has to pay. They talk about hiring a lawyer and posting bail, but in the meantime, Marty needs Cole to take care of himself and live a normal life. Cole again threatens Miles. Marty makes him promise to let Bo and John do their jobs. Nora arrives, having heard of Marty's arrest. Marty asks if Nora is visiting in an official capacity, and she says no, no charges are being pressed yet. Nora is letting Bo and John work the case and make a recommendation. Nora says she won't prosecute her friend, and she will recuse herself from Marty's case if charges are brought. Marty asks her to take care of Cole. Cole insists he can take care of himself. Instead, Cole wants to move in with John. Nora says that might be a good idea. Marty insists Cole live with Nora, who says she'll ask John to keep Cole in the loop about the case. Cole and Marty say they love each other, then Nora takes Cole home. John arrives to visit Marty, and tells her that Todd has been found. Marty asks John to tell Cole. John says that having Cole stay with Nora is a good plan. Marty asks what else is wrong. John tells her that David is now a free man, so he can't be used to try to clear Marty. John is apologetic and vows it won't be over until Marty is free and clear, too. \n\n\nStill in the hospital, David tries to order dinner and finds Renee has blacklisted him from ordering takeout from the Palace. John arrives and tells David to get ready to go on camera to tell the whole world he's Spencer's killer. David declines; John ignores him. John says he will bring the cameras to David's hospital room. A man shows up and tells David not to worry, that this is one threat that John won't make good on. The man is David's new, expensive lawyer, Howard, whom John recognizes from Trial TV. John wonders where David got the money to pay the famous attorney, who tells him to back off. John threatens to go to the IRS; Howard threatens John's job. John gives it right back to the lawyer, who says David's civil rights are being violated. David leans back with his arms behind his head, enjoying having John and Howard fight over him. Howard insists David is a free man who won't be going back to prison. He tells John to leave and take David's ankle monitor with him. Howard hands John an order vacating David's conviction and demanding immediate release. David giggles while John asks why Howard didn't just give this to him in the first place. Howard asks \"where's the fun in that?\" John leaves to get David released. David says it's too bad, because John knows where to get great cannolis, and now John hates him. David says there's something else he needs Howard to do for him. Later, Viki, very brusquely, visits David. David apologizes to her. \n\n\nAdriana, Rex, and Talia look for Tate's OPP medallion, which is no longer in the garbage can. Rex thinks Tate came back and took it. Adriana calls Layla and Tate answers her phone. Then, Adriana lies to Rex and Talia that she spoke with Layla and says Layla took out the trash. As a result, Talia deems that it is too early to put an APB out for Tate. Adriana tries to get Rex to leave. Talia leaves and then Rex confronts Adriana, knowing she's hiding something. Rex calls her bluff by dialing Layla's cell phone, saying he'll get the truth from her. Adriana grabs his phone and yells at Rex, fighting about their breakup, trying to get him to back off. She spins a big lie to Rex about what Layla told her when they talked. Rex walks out, slamming the door. Adriana, crying, calls 911, then, remembering Tate's threat about coming alone, hangs up and leaves her apartment. Rex, being sneaky, follows her. \n\n\nLayla arrives to meet Vincent on the Palace Hotel rooftop. She finds Vincent unconscious, tied in a chair, with a menacing Tate standing a few feet behind. Layla tries to wake Vincent up, then sees Tate and tries to run. Tate holds her at knifepoint and tells her he will kill her if she tries anything. Layla's cell phone rings and Tate answers her phone. Adriana asks Tate what he's done, and he replies \"nothing yet\" but Tate demands that Adriana come to the roof of the hotel, alone. Adriana and Layla are both near tears as Tate threatens Layla. Tate tells Layla to sit next to Vincent. Tate describes several different ways he might kill her. Vincent is awake, but pretends to be unconscious while trying to untie his hands. Tate makes Layla stand up, threatening to end it all, as Adriana arrives. Tate is annoyed, and Adriana is surprised, to see Rex arrive behind her. Tate says that now that the gang's all here, he can start the party. \n\n\n",
