They exchanged pleasantries and expressed relief that they had both survived the car accident. When Viki mentioned that she remembered their discussion about Charlie, Dorian immediately took the defensive and attempted to deflect any questioning concerning Charlie. Having no desire to argue with Dorian, Viki thanked her for saving her life. Overwhelmed with guilt, Dorian blurted out that she needed to make a confession. \n\n\nConcerned by Dorian's need for a heart-to-heart, a cautious Viki wondered if Dorian's confession was self-serving rather than in Viki's best interest. Viki reminded Dorian that her last desire to express the truth sent Viki packing her bags and headed to Paris, Texas. Dorian admitted that she hadn't shared a drink with Charlie and never slept with him. She went on to tell Viki that Charlie had never spoken negatively of her. Nearly choking on her own words, Dorian revealed that Charlie always spoke lovingly in regards to Viki. Expressing little surprise by Dorian's confession, Viki asked what really happened the night Charlie took a drink. Refusing to answer Viki's question directly, Dorian stated that everyone had done something at some point in their life that they were ashamed of. She argued that Charlie shouldn't be judged for making a mistake. Viki wondered if Dorian was referring to Charlie or herself. \n\n\nDorian exploded and compared Viki's words to Mel's. Surprised by the revelation that Dorian sought comfort by speaking to Mel, Viki admitted to talking to Ben, as well. Viki reminded Dorian that they weren't always enemies, and they remembered past times when they were civil toward one another. Dorian stated that during the moments that Viki was clinically dead, Dorian felt as though she had lost her best friend. Dorian believed that it proved that there was some good in their relationship. Dorian admitted that Mel suggested that she attempt to find some common ground in her relationship with Viki. In honor of Mel, the two shook hands and formed a truce. Excusing herself, Dorian left the room and placed a call to Addie. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Diner, Addie greeted Charlie. Sensing that Charlie was troubled, Addie offered her ear. Having a flashback of Brody's confession, Charlie admitted that he had heard a startling revelation at his AA meeting. He explained the extreme level of privacy that existed among AA members, and stated that he couldn't divulge the secret that was bothering him-not even to the person who needed to hear it the most. Addie received a call from Dorian. Dorian told her that she would meet her at the diner to discuss an important matter. \n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi pulled away after Brody kissed her. Surprised by Gigi's reaction, Brody stated that he thought she wanted the kiss as much as he did and insisted that they shared a physical connection. Gigi apologized for sending Brody mixed signals and informed him that she didn't share his feelings. Brody said that he would do anything for her and expressed his desire to raise their son together. After reminding Brody that Shane wasn't his son, Gigi expressed regret over lying to Shane about his paternity. She told Brody that she needed time to figure out how to handle the situation. Realizing that Gigi was still in love with Rex, Brody promised that he wouldn't do anything to complicate her life any further. \n\n\nAs Gigi headed upstairs, Brody looked at a sonogram of Shane and read the last letter that he had received from Gigi after leaving for Iraq. In the letter, Gigi thanked him for promising to marry her and help raise Shane once he returned. Gigi mentioned that she hadn't heard from Rex and realized that she probably never would. \n\n\nWhen Gigi returned, Brody showed her the letter and sonogram. Although she was touched that he had kept the items, Gigi didn't appear to have a change of heart concerning her feelings for him. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora listened as Clint offered David $10,000,000 to divorce Addie and help him regain control of Buchanan Enterprises from Dorian. David attempted to con Clint by stating that his only concern was for sweet Addie. Clint and Nora tried to convince David that he could break things off with Addie gently. Because he had signed the annulment papers, David asked Clint to come up with another plan. Insisting that David cooperate, Clint presented him with a check. Clint advised David that he had placed a hold on the check and David would receive the funds as soon as he made good on the promise. After wrestling with his conscience, David snatched the check and bolted out the door. Out in the foyer, David held the check with a firm grip and exclaimed, \"Ten million reasons to get those annulment papers away from Dorian!\" \n\n\nClint and Nora wondered whether David had the ability to scam Dorian. They discussed devising an alternate plan. \n\n\nBack at the diner, Charlie congratulated Addie on her marriage to David. An elated Addie told Charlie that she had nearly accomplished everything on her list. As Addie bragged about David's good qualities, David burst into Viki's hospital room looking for Dorian. When Viki told David that she overheard Dorian making plans to meet up with Addie, a panicked David begged Viki for information concerning their whereabouts. Viki had no idea. \n\n\nDorian interrupted Charlie and Addie's conversation at the diner. Upon seeing Dorian, Charlie immediately excused himself. Before he left, Dorian informed Charlie that Viki was involved in a car accident and had been taken to the hospital. Charlie bolted out the door and headed for Llanview Hospital. \n\n\nAs David continued to question a clueless Viki about Addie and Dorian's location, Charlie entered and informed David that Addie and Dorian were at the diner. \n\n\nDorian told Addie that she had managed to save her life, and presented Addie with the annulment papers bearing David's signature. As a confused Addie asked Dorian for answers, David stormed into the diner and demanded that Dorian step away from his wife. With a smug look, Dorian held the papers close to her. \n\n\nOn the roof of the Angel Square Hotel, Blair and John shared cocktails and discussed Blair's relationship with Todd. Blair told John that Todd had never forgiven himself for raping Marty years earlier. As a result of his guilt, Blair claimed that Todd had become a controlling and hateful person. Blair admitted that it had always been easier to blame Marty, rather than herself, for allowing Todd to hurt her and the children. John stated that the blame should be placed on Todd-not Blair or Marty. \n\n\nAs they consumed more alcohol, Blair continued to vent about her life with Todd. Blair compared her relationship with Todd to that of an abused wife. Blair stated that she thought Todd would change, but realized that she stayed with him because she had been afraid of being alone. Expressing her need to belong to a family, Blair said that Todd represented the family she never had. John understood Blair's reasoning and encouraged her to move on. John expressed his hurt over losing Marty. Vowing to put an end to Todd's hold on her, a tipsy Blair screamed from the rooftop, \"Llanview, take a look at the new and improved Blair Cramer!\" Attempting to pull John to his feet, Blair begged him to shout his new declaration from the rooftop. Unwilling to make a spectacle of himself, John refused. As Blair continued to pull on John's arm, he lost his balance and Blair fell on top of him. They stared into one another's eyes and began to kiss. Feeling uncomfortable, Blair pulled away but John pulled her towards him. As the storm approached, John and Blair shared a passionate kiss on the rooftop. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd looked distressed after telling Marty she was raped in college. Marty misinterpreted Todd's reaction. She believed that he was her friend back in college and felt terrible reliving the rape all over again. When Marty asked who the rapist was and why he had hurt her, Todd revealed that he was a student who hated her. Todd told Marty that she was unable to fight off the attack because she had been drinking. Marty wondered if she had a bad reputation back in college, but Todd said she was simply misunderstood. Marty begged Todd to tell her how the rape occurred. Without revealing he was the offender, Todd vividly described that fateful night. As he remembered the night of the Spring Fling, Todd appeared guilt-ridden. Upon learning that she was gang raped, Marty became emotional. The two held hands and comforted one another.\n\n\n",

And they end up kissing passionately. Marty seems to trust Todd while asking him about the time she was raped in college. She seems to have no clue that he raped her.
