She explained that she had wanted to make things up to Nate, and she had a bagful of Rodi's burgers and fries. Nate advised her that nothing was wrong, and he asked her to stop apologizing. He was sorry that he'd made Dani feel like she couldn't trust him, but all would be okay. Nate also informed Dani that Deanna had left for California in search of her mother. The couple shared a loving moment until Rick arrived and interrupted them.\n\n\nRick announced that he'd been looking for Nate. Dani advised the man that she'd heard all about what Nate and Deanna had done at the motel, and Rick was astonished. Nate jumped in and explained that he'd told Dani that Rick was a lawyer who had been very helpful in the search for Deanna's mother. \"Right. Yeah,\" Rick stammered. Rick proceeded to talk about Nate's great performance, and he made other comments that had a double entendre. He had Nate scowling behind Dani's back.\n\n\nWhen Dani received a phone call and stepped away, Nate gave the slimeball hell. Rick whipped a DVD out of his bag and handed it to Nate. He had only wanted Nate to view a rough cut of the film they'd made. Rick had been thrilled with the results. Dani returned and asked about the disc. Hurriedly, Nate grabbed it out of Rick's hand and explained that it was about Deanna's mother. Rick ad-libbed that it contained material from Deanna's childhood.\n\n\nNate announced that he had Deanna's address, and he would send her the disc. Rick left, and Dani asked Nate whether he was certain that Rick was a lawyer. She thought that Deanna shouldn't have been forced to pay for information on her mother, and Dani admitted that Rick just seemed creepy. Nate advised her that all business with the sleazeball was finished. The couple sat to share lunch on a park bench. \"Things are looking up,\" Dani remarked, and the couple shared a kiss.\n\n\nDani announced that she had a couple of tickets to the premiere of  Vicker Man, and she asked Nate to attend the gala as her date. Instead, Nate talked about how he'd let Dani down, and he would do anything to make it up to her. Nate had to get back to work, and he assured Dani he'd send the DVD to Deanna. As soon as Dani was gone, Nate broke the DVD into lots of little pieces.\n\n\nElsewhere in the park, Starr and Baz walked around as they chatted. Starr revealed that her father had been acting oddly, as though he were afraid of losing his family. Baz confessed that his dad had been acting strangely, also, and he was certain that something was about to happen. Starr was scared. Baz told Starr about hearing his father threaten to harm someone, and Baz was certain the man hadn't been the cable salesman that Tomas had claimed.\n\n\nStarr believed that their fathers' behavior was somehow connected to Sam's kidnapping. She agreed that her father had still seemed stressed out, ever after Sam had been saved. Baz mentioned the encrypted files, and Starr admitted that things seemed to be getting scarier as they went along. Baz just thought it was all weird. Starr explained that Sam had loved his kidnapper, and the boy had thought that the kidnapping was all an adventure.\n\n\nStarr spoke to her mother on the phone and learned that Sam and Hope were going to the zoo. Starr indicated that she'd always loved reptiles, and Baz was surprised. He pointed out that he'd learned two unusual things about Starr. She was a mother, and she loved snakes. Starr clarified that he was surprised that she was such a young mother, and she considered herself to be advanced.\n\n\nBaz thought it was remarkable that they both loved snakes, and they both had weird fathers. The couple talked about the snakes they'd enjoyed in the past, and Starr related how she'd ended up in a closed-down reptile shop by herself and had found a man chained to a wheel. No one had believed her story, because she had always told lies. Starr compared the story to Sam's insistence that a man who looked like the original Todd Manning had kidnapped him.\n\n\nA short time later, Baz and Starr settled themselves down on the ground to observe a praying mantis. When they stood up, Baz grabbed Starr and began to kiss her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a demanded that Tomas tell her the truth about himself, or he would have to move out of the house. T\u00e9a noted that she had defended her brother to everyone. Tomas declared that he had only been protecting his family, but T\u00e9a argued that she was an attorney, and she didn't need any protection. Finally, Tomas thought that he'd better give in. T\u00e9a's first question revolved around the encrypted CIA file that the police had on Tomas.\n\n\nTomas revealed that he had previously worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, and he'd been recruited out of Juilliard. The agency had liked him because of his ability to speak several languages, and he'd had the cover of traveling the world, performing concerts. He'd been na\u00efve, and he hadn't known what he had gotten himself involved with. He had pictured himself with a James Bond type of life, but things hadn't worked out that way.\n\n\nTomas continued that he'd had to stay away in order to protect his family. He'd incorrectly thought that he'd been serving his country, but things had gotten complicated and political. Tomas had found himself trusting the wrong people at times, so he'd made the decision to quit. T\u00e9a wondered what any of it had to do with Todd. Tomas inquired whether she was sure she wanted to know.\n\n\nT\u00e9a assured him that she wanted the information. She asked if Tomas had something on Todd, and whether Tomas had really been the one to shoot Todd. Tomas proclaimed that he hadn't been the shooter, but he'd been there and had tried to stop the actual suspect. That had been when Todd had seen Tomas in the window. Tomas hadn't recognized the shooter, and he'd fought with the man.\n\n\nUnfortunately, McBain had fired his own gun that had grazed Tomas, and the suspect had gotten away. Tomas assured his sister that he'd only received a flesh wound. He had done his best to try to save Todd. Tomas didn't want to say anything else, other than the fact that Todd was mixed up in something dangerous. Tomas wanted T\u00e9a and Dani to pack their things, and he would take them somewhere safe. He was afraid for T\u00e9a's life.\n\n\nT\u00e9a grew angry and began to yell at her brother. She stormed out of the house, and a fearful Tomas tried his best to stop her. He yelled that it was dangerous. T\u00e9a wanted to get to the bottom of things.\n\n\nTodd spoke to Agent Baker at La Boulaie, and the agent assured Todd that the man with the scar was dead. Baker had shot him and pushed the man into the river. The agent had watched the man sink. Before they could discuss it any further, Dorian arrived home and demanded to know why the men were outside of her house. Baker charmingly introduced himself, but Dorian wondered why the men had seemed to look so serious.\n\n\nBaker quickly reassured Dorian that he had been there regarding Sam's abduction and the murder, because he was in the security business. Todd chimed in that they had been discussing Sam and all that had happened of late. Baker promised that the person responsible for all of it would pay. Dorian was grateful for the men's interest. Baker excused himself to answer his phone. Dorian thanked Todd for hiring extra security, and she thought that Baker's attitude inspired confidence.\n\n\nBaker was incredulous. He couldn't believe the man with the scar was still alive. He ordered the caller to get rid of the man, or the caller would be next. Baker returned to the others and apologized for having to take the call. He revealed that he had a lead on the kidnapper. He handed Dorian a business card, and he turned to go.\n\n\nTodd wanted to continue his discussion with Baker, but Dorian berated Todd for stopping the man from conducting his investigation. Baker thought it was a good idea for Todd to \"listen to the mayor,\" and Baker left. Dorian decided that she liked the man, and she thanked Todd again for \"stepping up\" and hiring Baker.\n\n\nDorian reminded Todd that Sam had saved her, and she added that she hoped to see Todd at the Vicker Man premiere. \"Whatever,\" Todd replied. Dorian muttered that she really didn't care about seeing Todd anyway. She looked at Baker's card and read his name, Malcolm Baker, out loud.\n\n\nStanding at the docks and looking around, John waited patiently for the man who had called him on the phone to show himself. Suddenly, the man with the scar stepped out from behind some boxes, and he thanked John for meeting him. John asked the man who he was. \"I'm Todd Manning,\" the man replied. The man added that the other man walking around as Todd was a fake, and he'd stolen the man's family and life.\n\n\nThe man also stated that someone had been trying to kill him, after he'd escaped from the place where he'd been held for the last eight years. John urged the man to step forward, and the men shook hands. The man wanted John's help. As the men grasped hands, John quickly grabbed the man's arm and twisted it behind his back. He pushed the man against a wall.\n\n\nThe man quickly admitted that he'd been the one to kill the agent at La Boulaie, but the agent had pointed a gun at Sam. He also admitted that he'd borrowed Sam to get Sam's father's attention. He wouldn't have called it a kidnapping. \"I would never hurt a child,\" the man stated firmly. He advised John that Baker had been the one who'd been trying to kill him, and the agent had believed he'd succeeded.\n\n\nJohn had lots of questions, but the man was unable to answer them. He had been held against his will in a windowless and soundproof room for eight years. He'd been tortured. He had no ideas about the identity of the organization that had held him prisoner, and he hadn't been aware of where they were located. John was skeptical. \"Look at my face. I'm Todd Manning, right?\" the man said. He wondered how everyone could believe that the other guy was Todd.\n\n\nJohn admitted that he had no other explanations, and he'd seen old photos of Todd. The man revealed that Louie had advised him to call John, because John was an honest man who would help. John wanted to take the man to the police station, but the man assured John that if they went to the station, someone would kill him. John agreed that he had always trusted Louie, and the man added that Louie could vouch that he'd seen someone shoot the man.\n\n\nThe man pleaded that he'd be as \"good as dead\" if John were to take him to the police station. Just then, John spotted a laser beam on the man's chest, and he pushed him to safety. John began to shoot his gun multiple times in different directions. \"How about now? Do you believe me now?\" the man asked.\n\n\nVivian ran into Destiny at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 as Destiny placed an order at the counter. Destiny hastily made her way to the door, advising Vivian that she'd suddenly changed her mind about eating. \"Destiny, are you avoiding me?\" Vivian called out. Destiny stopped and chuckled. She'd been too busy to help out with Vivian's teenage pregnancy group. Vivian wasn't fooled, and she asked Destiny if she were pregnant.\n\n\nDestiny was appalled to hear that Vivian thought such a thing, and Destiny indignantly advised the doctor that she was way off-base. Vivian ticked off the indicators, pointing out that first Destiny had been queasy with no appetite, and suddenly her appetite had grown. Destiny had also appeared to have vast mood swings. Vivian reminded Destiny that Shaun had heard Destiny's conversation with Matthew regarding a couple having sex.\n\n\nVivian could see that Destiny appeared to be stressed out, but Destiny insisted she was merely concerned with Matthew's condition. She advised the doctor that her conversation with Matthew had been about another couple. Vivian assured Destiny that she could be trusted, because Vivian was both a doctor and a friend. Destiny retorted that she didn't know Vivian, but the doctor reminded her that she had been dating Shaun for some time.\n\n\nVivian offered to help Destiny, and she suggested that Destiny think about her options as soon as she could, before it was too late. Vivian advised Destiny that she wouldn't be able to pretend that she wasn't pregnant for long. Destiny appreciated Vivian's concern, but she wanted the doctor to leave her alone. She ordered Vivian not to say anything to Shaun.\n\n\nJohn took the man back to his own place and told the man that they would have to figure things out. The man was thankful, and he joked that while John was attractive, the man usually didn't go home with guys until at least the third date, unless they spent lots of money on him. John assured the man that the man wasn't his type, but he wanted to hear the man's story.\n\n\nThe man with the scar on his cheek explained that the organization had wanted some information that he hadn't had. He had escaped, and he had obtained a uniform from another agent that he'd taken down. He had been on the plane that Marty had later escaped on. He knew that John had been at the landing strip. John recalled the bagged uniform jacket that had been marked as evidence. It had been found at the landing strip.\n\n\nThe man nodded. That had been the uniform that he'd ditched. John showed the man the logo that had appeared on the jacket, and the man recognized it. He said it had been all over the place where he'd been imprisoned. He didn't know what it stood for. The man was certain that the guy claiming to be Todd was \"one of them.\" The man stated that Todd had denied having any knowledge of anything, and John was shocked to hear that the man had actually spoken to Todd.\n\n\nThe man explained that had been the reason that he'd taken Sam. He'd wanted to get Todd's attention. John wondered why Todd had never mentioned meeting the man, and the man emphasized that Todd was \"in on it.\" The man was sure that Todd couldn't be the only one who was aware of what was happening.\n\n\nJohn gave the man a bite to eat, and the man continued to talk. He concluded that he had returned to town and hadn't known what to expect. It certainly wasn't another guy living the man's life with the man's family. John wondered if the man knew Tomas. The man was aware that Tomas was T\u00e9a's brother. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door. It was T\u00e9a, and she called out that she needed to speak to John.\n\n\nTodd arrived home and ran into Tomas. \"I just told T\u00e9a,\" Tomas informed him.\n\n\nBaker looked around the docks. He was puzzled that the man was still alive, because he'd shot the man and dumped him into the river. Someone had helped the man, and he would find out who it was. He planned on getting rid of both of them.\n\n\n",
