He instructs the party to \"leave it by the front door.\" When Adriana is unable to find Rex, she sees a car's headlights and looking outside, spots the package. Panic-stricken, she fears that the stalker has found them. A bemused Rex shows her the lobsters that he ordered for dinner. Later, while looking for more candles, she spots his hidden laptop but he's quick to pull it from her hands. She's angered that he's keeping secrets.\n\n\nKevin wants Kelly to respect his space and stay away from him and his family. He wants them to lead totally separate lives. Kelly explains that this is not possible, as they have already bonded. He berates himself on how he's handled the entire situation and how it stemmed from his not able to be like his father and grandfather and take care of his family, since he was unable to have one. He failed and watched Duke be the person he was unable to be, someone who loved Kelly. He felt inferior and turned away from them so that he wouldn't be hurt when Kelly chose Duke over him. Unfortunately, he can't take back the nasty things that he said but he's happy that the one thing that would destroy him didn't happen. As Kelly cries and tries to speak, he cuts her off, not allowing her to make her confession. Asa doesn't know about Duke, he continues. Kelly is sorry for everything and is quick to say that Kevin is not responsible for all that happened. Duke was his son and her friend and she did not use him to make a baby, she maintains. He must find a better way to mourn but can't allow her to comfort him. He can only see Kelly and Duke together the night of the tornado. She wonders what would be if something happened and he couldn't put that memory away.\n\n\nEvangeline is informed of the eye surgery by Todd and is angered that he received consent from her mother.  She accuses both Todd and Cris of turning her blindness into a handicap and treating her as stupid. That will change and their fighting with each other will stop, she warns them both. Todd is her friend whether Cris likes it or not. She asks them to shake hands. Todd offers his hand to Cris, finally, but Cris won't shake it. When Michael arrives to check Evangeline, the men step outside. Cris makes it known that he's not happy that Todd is in Evangeline's life. Todd accuses him of loving her but telling her lies and she wouldn't be very happy to know it. Todd tracks down Dr. Simmons and orders him back to the hospital to remove Evangeline's bandages. Later, Evangeline tells Cris that she's falling in love with him. She also states that she will walk away if he lies to her and she already knows that he didn't shake Todd's hand. Todd looks on as the pair gets cozy.\n\n\nJess and the baby end up in Bruce's NYC apartment against her will and she promises to get away. Her first attempt is futile though she pounds for an elevator. Nash is set on having a conversation with Tess though Jess is adamant that she will not return because she's not needed any longer. She has all of the people in her life that she wants and Nash isn't on that list. She accuses Nash of blowing it because she will see the cops when she escapes and he will lose all visitation rights with Brennan. Antonio never tried anything when Jess went missing, she charges. She is further angered when she sees that the guest room has been turned into a full blown nursery, equipped with all of the baby's needs. He has Tess' clothes for her as well, he admits. She would never wear any of those clothes, she replies. Nash figures that Tess could teach Jess a few things about love and relationships. She watches Nash bond with the baby and talk to her about Tess. She's impressed but when he tells her to make a wish on a shining star, she wishes to be with her family and stalks off. He wishes for the same.\n\n\nAntonio breaks down the door at the winery but there's no Nash or Jess to be found, although the outline of Reston's body still remains. The detective in the case appears and he mentions that Nash rubs him the wrong way. Antonio nods in agreement. He suggests that Nash's lawyer might know his whereabouts and Antonio manages to get Bruce's phone number from Claudia when she calls. He admits that he didn't report the kidnapping because he doesn't know if Jess is Tess again. Claudia thinks she knows where they might be (and is hoping that Antonio will find Nash for her).\n\n\nAntonio calls Bruce and pretends to be a cop in Napa but Bruce is on to him quickly when Antonio is unable to answer questions. Antonio warns him that he'll lose his license by aiding a kidnapper. Bruce quickly attempts to reach Nash and leaves him a message: Get Jess and the baby and get out right away.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Evangeline gets the information that her neck got hurt in the accident and Todd tells her that when she was out of it, he arranged for her to have her eyes operated on. Cristian finds Todd amazing the way that he takes over and controls everything. Todd ignores him and gives all his attention to Evangeline, remarking how beautiful she looks for someone who is so ill. Claudia gets a bright idea. She wants Antonio to find Jessica and get her back, so she calls Antonio up with the idea that she might know where Nash has taken Jessica and the child. Antonio thanks her for the info. He starts heading out to Bruce's place to see if the tip that he got is a good one. Jessica sits around listening to Antonio reminisce about her alter. He talks about the stars and how he taught Tess a little about then when they were in Manhattan. Jessica tries not to be affected by what he tells her about his life with Tess but she can't help but be a little touched by it all. Antonio contacts Bruce and pretends to be a cop working on the Reston killing case. Bruce quickly figures out that he is talking to Antonio and tells nothing. Bruce then leaves voicemail for Nash warning him that Antonio is on the hunt for him and that he had better take off. Adriana is getting suspicious of Rex and the way that he has been behaving. He has been secretive and she thinks that people who love each other shouldn't have secrets. Rex admits that he has been keeping things from her but he doesn't get into what that exactly is. Adriana gets mad.",
