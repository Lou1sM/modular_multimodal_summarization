With great difficulty, she asks John to look in on Cole when she is sent to jail for a very long time. He refuses to help her give up.  Bo has Tate upgraded to suspect though he and Talia doubt they have enough to get a warrant yet. Talia is certain that Adriana, Layla, Vincent and Rex are all safe in the girls' apartment, though she is unable to reach any of them via their cell phones. Bo questions Miles on his familiarity with Kandi Lane and Jordan Ames who hangs out at the Palace and apparently gave Kandi the job with Todd. He denies knowing either of them. Bo also suggests that Marty doesn't want to hear from Miles, when he tries to pass on a message. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Todd has a reunion with his family members and learns of all of the goings on with Marty and Miles. David tries to apologize to Viki and shows her that he's legally had all of the money transferred back to Clint. He couldn't bear Viki's bad thoughts of him and cares greatly about what she thinks of him. He asks her for forgiveness and after she tells him how hurt she feels to be played, intentional or not, she agrees. She thinks that he's just a child though giving back the money goes a long way. He feels that he's learned a lesson and signs the document, still a little regretful. Dorian thinks he's crazy but agrees he did the right thing. He promises to return and visit her, since he's planning on leaving Llanview once again.  He feels noble, she's proud and he's feeling free finally, the first time since he was a kid. Viki talks to a troubled looking Paige and tells her to follow her heart. Todd convinces his family to let him sleep for awhile and leaves the hospital. He writes a note stating he had something to take care of.\n\n\nThe Llanview Police Department jail is where Todd heads. He wants to get to the bottom of Miles' actions but the prisoner's denials and non-answers result in Todd's choking him. Bo receives a visit from Renee and Nigel who have a bottle of bourbon for him from Asa, to thank him for his kindness. Bo refuses to accept the bottle or Asa's actions and lets Nigel know that he knows about the ten million dollar bribe. Talia overhears Renee talking on the phone about Vincent's planned rooftop dinner and realizes that Adriana lied about the group congregating at the apartment. At the cell, the guard on duty quickly summons help as the men have to be pulled apart and restrained. Bo refuses to press charges against Todd as Miles demands. Why? Because your lieutenant is hot after my wife? the prisoner rants, as John looks on. Bo learns that Paige is leaving town. Later, Miles unsuccessfully tries to \"reach\" Spencer but recognizes that he's on his own. John returns to his office and relates the events that just occurred in Miles' cell. Something he says clicks in Marty's head and suddenly, she remembers everything!\n\n\nNigel stops by to see David to offer Asa's good wishes after saving Jess' life. He sees what he needs to. Todd is back in bed but promises to finish his \"chat\" with Miles.\n\n\nUp on the Palace roof, as Tate determinedly follows his mission, Rex tries to stall him as he spots Vincent trying to break free from his restraints. He engages him in conversation, learning of his tainted beliefs and the fact that his father took the fall for him. Adriana ties Rex up, following Tate's orders, though she slips him something sharp at the same time. Tate advises her that she was his cover, never a friend. He could hardly be friends with someone like her, a mutt. He offers to trade her for the other 3; she can save all of them by committing suicide. As her friends yell no, Adriana agrees to stand on the ledge. He wants her to jump. Vincent does a lot of shouting, again trying to slow things down. Tate tells them he will take full responsibility for her death via the OPP. When she hesitates, he threatens to throw Layla over instead. There's more threatening as Tate holds a knife to Adriana, ordering her to say, \"I am not worthy to live.\" It all suddenly comes to an abrupt halt when a shot rings out; Talia has appeared on the roof and Tate goes down!\n\n\n",
