Finding no photos in the files, he related that fact was the reason that Rex was still breathing. Eli's phone rang and he answered it to Blair. She wanted to say goodnight and maybe see him. He told her that he had a lot of work to do, but it would all be cleaned up that night. She told him that he wasn't allowed to pull work-related all-nighters once they were married. He said he had to get back to work, but promised he'd see her soon.\n\n\nOnce off the phone, Eli wondered how many things had to line up in order to get him into the mess he was in. The Banner had run his picture in the paper. Melinda was reading the paper, which Rodney happened to see. Rodney had recognized Eli's face from an incident from years before and warned Melinda that her niece Blair was in trouble if she was seeing Eli. However, Eli was lucky enough to intercept Melinda's phone call and get to California in enough time to stop Melinda from talking. Eli claimed to be a decent guy that was just doing what he had to.\n\n\nEli related that he needed to find a way to get Rex off the case. He suggested pushing Gigi down the stairs, but that would make John suspicious. Pushing Marty down the stairs had kept John off his trail for a little while, but not long enough. As Eli contemplated the pros and cons of killing Rex versus keeping him alive, there was a knock on the door. A man announced himself as Glenn from the Hall of Records, and said he had the information that Rex had requested. Thinking quickly, Eli opened the door and introduced himself as Rex Balsom.\n\n\nGlenn presented Eli with all the information he could find about the Bennett Thompsons. Eli asked if Glenn had been followed and warned him that someone would probably pretend to be him and try to get information out of Glenn. He handed Glenn some money and told him not to talk to anyone. As Eli walked away, Glenn wished that he had never met the man. Back in the room, Eli sifted through the files and found a marriage license. He said he wouldn't want Blair to see it, but then reasoned that maybe Rex should see everything.\n\n\nEli wanted Rex to think he was seeing the whole truth in the papers, but not before Eli made a few \"edits.\" Eli thought that Rex would be out for several more hours, which would give him enough time to change the documents. He wondered who else could link him to Bennett Thompson and thought of Evangeline. However, he knew she'd soon be gone.\n\n\nAt the hospital in Maryland, Mrs. Williamson admitted to Layla that she wasn't going to fight anymore. She had talked to the lawyer that had helped Evangeline out with her living will and he said that Evangeline was serious about her wishes. Evangeline had been a fighter, but also a realist. Mrs. Williamson wanted for Evangeline what her daughter wanted for herself. Layla suggested they wait a little while, but Mrs. Williamson said there was no point and that she would go get the doctor. Layla was in disbelief that her sister was about to die.\n\n\nMrs. Williamson returned, saying that the doctor was on her way. Layla suggested that they call friends of Evangeline, but her mother wanted to keep it to family. The doctor entered asking if they'd come to a decision about Evangeline. Layla and her mother wanted to honor Evangeline's wishes to not be hooked up to machines in order to live. The doctor confirmed that they were sure and left to get the forms that needed to be signed. Mrs. Williamson announced that it was time to say goodbye.\n\n\nMrs. Williamson took her turn first, so Cristian and Layla exited the room. Layla wondered how she could ever let go, but Cristian reassured her that she would always carry Evangeline with her. Layla's turn to say goodbye was next, but she didn't know what to say. Cristian asked if he could have some time with Evangeline even though he wasn't family. He entered the hospital room with Mrs. Williamson's approval. Cristian thanked Evangeline for getting him out of his \"deepest hole,\" and for believing in, and defending, him. He wished he could help her out of this, but told her he would never forget her.\n\n\nLayla entered next and, with Cristian's support, told her sister that she couldn't imagine a world without Evangeline in it. She would miss her older sister until the day that she died. Mrs. Williamson arrived with the doctor, and declared that the forms were signed. The doctor shut the machines off as Mrs. Williamson, Layla, and Cristian cried at Evangeline's bedside. Mrs. Williamson told her daughter to \"rest easy\" as she flat-lined.\n\n\nDavid entered the living room at La Boulaie and demanded that Dorian step away from her computer. She read out loud as she typed her status update, \"David Vickers has a small...\" David was angry to read that Dorian thought he had a small mind. As the two bickered about MyFace postings, Dorian grabbed two figurines to throw at David, and he picked up a fire poker. Blair entered and wondered what was wrong with the two. Blair told them to get a room, but David said he already had one with Viki, his \"former friend.\"\n\n\nDavid and Dorian bickered about Charlie and Viki, but a confused Blair interrupted because she wanted to know what had happened. The two filled Blair in on Charlie and Viki's scheme, and claimed that they had left the country in shame. Blair admitted that they probably went about things the wrong way, but that David and Dorian were driving everyone crazy by denying that they were in love. David wondered how she knew about real love, to which Blair replied that she had known ever since Eli proposed to her.\n\n\nDorian wondered why Blair was rushing into things while David warned Blair not to \"blow it this time.\" Blair explained why she loved Eli and reminded Dorian that Eli wasn't Todd. Dorian changed her tune and congratulated her niece. David and Dorian began to argue about Eli, but Blair interrupted again, wondering how they had ganged up on her seconds earlier, but were already fighting again. Dorian commanded David to leave, and he left.\n\n\nDorian asked Blair about her wedding plans, to which Blair replied that she and Eli wanted to get married as soon as possible. Blair was sure that this wedding would be her last. Blair wished that David and Dorian would work things out, but Dorian vowed to prove that she no longer loved David. Blair wished her aunt luck and left Dorian with her computer. Later, Blair walked down the stairs in a bright pink overcoat. She called Eli and hung up after getting his voicemail. She opened her coat to reveal lingerie and walked out of the house.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi wanted to clarify that Natalie didn't want to have the baby, but John interrupted looking for cigars. Kelly entered, wondering what had happened that everyone was celebrating. Brody informed Kelly that he and Jessica were going to have a baby and went to get a cigar with John. Kelly was happy that Jessica could enjoy things without worry. John and Brody went outside to enjoy their cigars, so Gigi and Natalie continued their conversation. Natalie explained that she'd always wanted kids, but with her husband. She and John weren't ready for that conversation yet. Plus, Natalie didn't want to ruin Jessica and Brody's happiness.\n\n\nNatalie reminded Gigi that there had been many times that Jessica had almost been lost, and they both knew what had happened to Brody in the past. However, Gigi reassured Natalie that Jessica and Brody had both survived the things that had happened to them. She also told Natalie that she couldn't keep anything from John for very long.\n\n\nJohn returned and asked Kelly if she had heard from Rex. She informed him that she had just spoken to Rex and was confident that she would find her mother's killer. John wanted Kelly to let him know about any updates. Kelly left and Natalie returned to talk to John. She asked him how he was with all the baby talk. John was happy for Jessica and Brody and related that Natalie was all he needed.\n\n\nCatching up with Gigi, Brody updated her on the good news. Gigi related that she had good news too -- she was going to college. She also divulged that she and Rex were starting over. Brody was happy that she was finally getting her happy ending. Jessica and Brody decided that it was time to go home. They said goodbye to everyone and left. John told Gigi that he would close and told her she could leave as well.\n\n\nAs Gigi left, she reminded Natalie that she was there for her friend. Gigi told Natalie to sleep on it and not to make any huge decisions yet. She assured Natalie that she wasn't alone. Gigi left and texted Rex \"goodnight. Sweet dreams.\"\n\n\nAs John closed Rodi's up, he wanted to know what Natalie had wanted to tell him earlier. Thinking quickly, she told John that she didn't like his hair. He didn't buy it, but accepted it \"for now.\" Grateful, Natalie hugged John.\n\n\nDavid walked into the diner to find Kelly on her computer. He informed her that Dorian was impossible. Kelly told him to get a room, but David took Kelly's computer in order to prove that he no longer loved Dorian. His relationship status on MyFace boasted \"single and loving it!!\" However, he was visibly disappointed that he had no messages from Dorian. Kelly grabbed her computer back, saying that she had more important things to do. She left the diner, looking at her phone and wondering why Rex hadn't called her yet.\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, Blair announces that she and Eli are getting married and she suspects nothing. Dorian and David are continuing to fight and deny their feelings for each other. Natalie still does not want to reveal to John that she is pregnant, and it's possible that Brody is the father of her baby. He knows that she has a secret that she is not revealing.",
