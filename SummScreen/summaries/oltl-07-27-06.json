    "soap_central": "\n\nAdriana, disturbed over Rex's reluctance over her looking on his computer, wonders if their relationship is a mistake.  The two soon make up, however, when Rex tells her he had been researching stalkers and found some scary stuff, and he didn't want it to freak her out.  Later, she calls her mother and tells her that she is really in love with Rex.  To her surprise, Dorian says she is getting used to the idea, and that perhaps she is changing.  When Adriana sees Rex coming, she hurriedly gets off the phone.  The two plan to go back to the bed and breakfast for a romantic dinner, but Rex stays behind to put out the fire.  A man wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, with his face concealed, approaches Rex.  Rex, expecting him, gives him some money while looking around to make sure Adriana is nowhere in sight.\n\n\nBlair and Bo argue about her spying on Spencer.  Blair reflects on what the people of Llanview must think of her.  Paige, who sees the two from afar, mistakes Bo's comforting gestures for romantic attention.  Later, Paige confronts Blair, wanting to know what she was talking to Bo about.  Blair answers by saying if Paige wants to know, maybe she should tell her why she protected Spencer for so many years.  Paige tells Blair the only reason she protected Spencer was that he was blackmailing her with the information that recently surfaced.  Blair says maybe she could get her job back if she works with her and Todd.  Spencer interrupts their conversation and wants to know what Blair meant.  She covers by saying that since Todd is now on the hospital board, he might be able to do something.  She then changes the subject by accusing Paige of wanting to get back together with Spencer.  Blair calls Paige a \"murdering drunk\" and says the only reason she wants to help get her job back is so that she can stop making Bo and everyone else pity her.  Paige tells Blair she feels sorry for Starr and Jack, and that no amount of therapy is going to save them from her.  Blair slaps Paige.  Paige then asks Blair if she's crazy, \"or is that just your mother?\" and Blair attacks her.\n\n\nJohn and Natalie test evidence in the lab, getting periodic phone calls from Bo of updated information.  Bo tells John that the forger Spencer told Blair about is actually named Larry Madsen, and he received a heart transplant 10 years ago.  They suspect that Spencer was either the surgeon or is connected to it in some way-Larry Madsen somehow went from the bottom of the list to the top in the blink of an eye.  Later, Natalie appears to have discovered something important.\n\n\nJessica pulls a gun on Nash.  Nash tells her it's a starter's pistol, and it won't hurt him.  When she refuses to believe him he dares her to shoot him, but she can't, and he takes it from her.  Jessica then accuses him of doing what Tess always feared of Antonio-prodding her in hopes of waking the other personality-and she doesn't understand why he would do that when he claims to have loved Tess so much.  Nash says she doesn't get it-she's always had a family-but Tess and Brennan are it for him.  The two fight passionately, but in reality, they both feel sorry for one another.  Nash tells Jessica he will take her home.  He later wonders if maybe he hasn't changed his ways all that much since falling in love with Tess, as he thought.  Jessica disagrees, saying it's easy to see why Tess fell in love with him.  Nash expresses that he just wishes he could have at least said goodbye, that Tess had always reminded him they only had a certain amount of time.  Jessica asks Nash if he would say goodbye to Tess forever if she brought her out.\n\n\nAntonio tells Clint and Viki that he found a lead.  When Dorian also shows up at the house, Clint accuses of her wanting to sleep with him just to hurt Viki.  Later, Antonio locates Jessica and he and Clint head to New York.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica pulls a gun on Nash. She orders him to take her home. He isn't afraid. That is a starter pistol. He walks to her until he gets it from her. Adriana is having doubts about her relationship with Rex. He kept secrets from her and she didn't like that. She went for a walk and he followed her, thinking that was the safe thing to do. She feels that they are making a mistake. Bo did some checking and he found out a little Lenny the Forger. His feeling is that they should get the gang in and have a chat but John wants that reserved as Plan B, in case they need it. Paige walks in the restaurant and sees Bo and Blair talking. She comes over to Blair later and asks what they were talking about. Blair says that if Paige will tell when she knows about Spencer, she will tell what she and Bo were talking about. Spencer comes up behind Blair, hearing part of the conversation. He wants to know why she was saying that she and Todd could help Paige. Blair says that she only meant that now that Todd is on the board he could push things to work her way. Spencer still isn't convinced, so Blair puts on a show that she is jealous of Paige, thinking that she still wants to be with Spencer. She shouts at Paige to drive her point home. \"Just back off!\" Bo learns that 'Lenny The Forger' got a heart in Cleveland some time back and that there was something funny about that. He was on the waiting list at #457 and suddenly flew up to #1. Bo and John both know who could facilitate a move like that for someone who needs an organ. Nash and Jessica talk and she feels bad for him. At one point he is ready to take her home. She wonders if she should let Tess out to say goodbye to him. Antonio gets the information that he needs. He and Clint will head out now and get Jessica and the baby. Viki tells Antonio that she would be more comfortable with Clint there as well. John and Natalie start working on the bullet in the lab. They are trying to match the gun to the bullet. Natalie worries that if this match doesn't line up John will take it badly. All of a sudden \"John! John! You gotta see this!\"",
