    "soap_central": "\nGhost of a Chance\n\n\nNatalie, Jared, Jessica, and Brody decorated the Buchanan Lodge in preparation for the wedding rehearsal dinner.  Natalie panicked when she observed the banner and discovered that the printer had made a terrible mistake.  The banner read, \"Congratulations, Viki & Clint and Nora & Bo!\" Once Viki, Charlie, Clint, and Nora arrived at the lodge, they appeared uncomfortable after viewing the banner.   While Viki, Nora, and Charlie quickly dismissed the error, the fallacy left Clint in a miserable state.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Renee asked Madame Delphina to help her contact Asa's spirit.  The psychic immediately made contact with Asa's spirit, who stated that he was too busy to talk because he was setting things straight.   Although Madame Delphina tried to converse with him on Renee's behalf, Asa's spirit refused to speak to Renee directly -- instead, he continued to make references that Clint should marry Viki and Bo should marry Nora.  Neither Renee nor Madame Delphina was able to make any sense of Asa's rambling.\n\n\nIn the parking garage of Llanview Hospital, Bo pleaded with Rex to tell Gigi that he had slept with Stacy.  Refusing to accept the blame, Rex faulted Gigi for not telling him the truth about Stacy's blackmail.  Bo told Rex that Gigi was frightened and did what she thought was best.   Bo believed that Rex and Gigi could start over if Rex told her the truth.  Bo warned Rex that it would be disastrous if Gigi learned the truth from someone else.\n\n\nAfter doing his best to counsel Rex, Bo announced that he was late for Clint and Nora's wedding rehearsal dinner.   Noticing that Bo appeared confused by the upcoming wedding, Rex questioned how Bo felt about his brother marrying his ex-wife.  Realizing that Bo had strong feelings for Nora, Rex advised Bo to tell Nora how he felt.  Rex suggested that Bo confess his feelings to Nora before she married Clint.    Bo shook his head in denial and exclaimed, \"It's too late!  I'm the best man!  I couldn't do anything about it now if I wanted to!\"\n\n\nBack at the lodge, Clint, Viki, and Nora agreed that they felt the presence of Asa's spirit.  While Clint couldn't forget the mistake on the banner, Viki and Nora tried to convince him that the wedding would take place.  Later, Clint informed Viki about Matthew's decision to sue his parents.   Clint expressed guilt over locating Dr. Evans, who might have given Matthew false hope.\n\n\nViki apologized to Charlie for the banner mishap.  Embracing Viki, Charlie remarked, \"I know you and Clint are history!\"  A loud crash interrupted Viki and Charlie's passionate kiss.  A picture of Asa fell to the ground and landed at their feet.\n\n\nIn the hall of the Buchanan Lodge, Natalie admitted to Jared that she felt uncomfortable at the family cabin.  Natalie reminded Jared that he had announced that he was her uncle at the lodge.  Assuring her that better days were ahead, Jared suggested that they join the family.  Before exiting the hall, Natalie noticed a picture of Jessica and Nash.  Moments later, someone entered the hall and picked up the picture.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jessica and Brody cuddled in another room.  Aware that Jessica was deep in thought, Brody wondered what was wrong.  Jessica related that it was the second year anniversary of her marriage to Nash.   Jessica acknowledged that Nash was a part of her past, while Brody represented her future.  Declaring her love for Brody, Jessica stated that Nash would be happy for her.  Brody responded by giving Jessica a passionate kiss.\n\n\nMatthew, Rachel, Shaun, and Destiny arrived at the lodge.   While Nora smiled lovingly at her son, Matthew gave his mother a blank stare.   When Matthew mentioned the lawsuit, Nora tried to change the subject, but Matthew continued to boast that he would be victorious in court.  As Matthew and Nora argued, Rachel intervened and reminded her brother that the family had gathered to celebrate Nora's upcoming wedding.  When Rachel suggested that the family toast the happy couples, Nora quickly interrupted and commented that they should wait for Bo to arrive.  Bothered by Nora's request, Clint told Nora that Bo's presence wasn't necessary.\n\n\nBack at the Buchanan Mansion, Madame Delphina suddenly lost all contact with Asa's spirit.  The psychic announced, \"Everything went black!\"\n\n\nThe Buchanan clan gathered together and Natalie made a toast to her parents and their fianc\u00e9s.  As Natalie declared that their lives would be filled with light, darkness struck the entire cabin.  While Charlie and Jared checked the circuit breaker, everyone else searched for candles.\n\n\nJessica entered the hall and felt a presence.  She called out, \"Who's there?\"  There was no answer.  Jessica was suspicious when she noticed the photo of her and Nash facedown on the table.\n\n\nAs Viki and Clint wandered around the house looking for candles, Clint told Viki that the strange activities at the lodge caused him to question if his marriage to Nora was jinxed.  At that moment, Viki discovered a note addressed to her and Clint.  The note read, \"To Viki and Clint on their wedding day, Love Asa.\" Searching for Matthew, Nora spotted a picture of her and Bo on their wedding day.   Nora stared thoughtfully at the picture.\n\n\nIn an attempt to elude Nora, Matthew sought refuge in a bedroom.  Holding a photo of Asa, Matthew spoke to his grandfather.  Matthew was certain that Asa would understand his decision to sue his parents.  Although he was convinced that he was doing the right thing, Matthew admitted that he didn't like the tension that it caused between him and his parents.  Consumed with guilt, Matthew asked his grandfather for a sign.  Matthew turned around and noticed Destiny in the doorway.\n\n\nMadame Delphina made contact with Asa's spirit again.  The psychic told Renee that Asa wanted her to know that seven was his lucky number.   Madame Delphina's revelation brought a smile to Renee's face.  Stating that she was his seventh wife, Renee was convinced that Asa was making a reference to a wedding.  Thrilled to hear from her husband, Renee wondered if Asa had managed to \"set things right.\"  Madame Delphina was certain that Asa had set things in motion.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nora walked around the grounds and searched for Matthew.  Unable to locate her son, Nora placed a call to Bo and received his voicemail.  After warning Bo about her confrontation with Matthew, Nora blurted out, \"Where are you Bo?  I wish you were here right now!\"  Instantly, Bo appeared before her.\n\n\nMadame Delphina felt the presence of a spirit.  An excited Renee wondered if Asa had returned.  With a look of uncertainty, Madame Delphina replied, \"It's not Asa!  It's someone else!\"\n\n\nBack inside the lodge, Brody picked up the photo of Jessica and Nash. Outside, Jessica saw a figure and called out to Nash.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Gigi urged Stacy to accept her deal to leave town.   Staring down at the medical report that documented her pregnancy, Stacy gave Gigi a devilish look and threatened, \"I can make your life miserable!\"  Ignoring Gigi's pleas to leave town, Stacy announced her plans to file charges against Gigi for attempted murder.   When Gigi warned Stacy that Bo intended to send her to prison for a long time, Stacy showed no fear, and continued to hint about her pregnancy.   Appalled by Stacy's delusional behavior, Gigi told Stacy that Rex would never love her.  Waving the medical report in her hand, Stacy remarked, \"When I tell Rex what I found out, he's never going to leave me!\"\n\n\nAfter placing a call to Gigi, Rex panicked when he learned that Gigi was at the loft with Stacy.  In a frenzy, Rex raced to the loft.\n\n\nRex arrived at the loft and told Stacy that he was pressing criminal charges against her.  When Stacy began to babble about Rex being the love of her life, Rex threatened to call the police.  With an evil smirk, Stacy announced to a stunned Gigi and Rex that she was pregnant with Rex's child.\n\n\n",
