    "soap_central": "\n\nT\u00e9a, Todd, Dani, and Nate took in the sights of New York City and stopped at various places that T\u00e9a recalled from her childhood. Todd admitted he had not gotten lots of sleep the night before as he had to keep an eye on Nate in the event that Nate wanted to visit Dani's room. The teens were in awe at the various sights, and Nate couldn't believe that they had flown in Todd's private jet and stayed at a five-star hotel. He and Dani agreed that Todd could be generous, and Nate felt he owed something to Todd for saving his life.\n\n\nTodd made a scene every time Nate and Dani attempted to share any affection with each other. T\u00e9a urged Todd to calm down as she suggested that everyone hold hands. They paused at the fancy high-rise building where T\u00e9a lived as a child, and she admitted that she slept in the basement apartment with her father, who was the superintendent.\n\n\nDani was confused, since she thought her mother had been rich. T\u00e9a confessed that she had been ashamed, but her father had sacrificed a great deal for her. She received a scholarship to the private school that all the rich girls had attended, thanks to one of the tenants. She had been friends with the girls but couldn't allow them to see where she lived. She had even ignored her own father if she saw him while she was out with her friends. She never appreciated her dad, T\u00e9a revealed.\n\n\nNate asked T\u00e9a about her mom but T\u00e9a stated her mother died when T\u00e9a was young. \"How'd that foot taste?\" Todd sarcastically asked Nate. He continued to be mean to Nate every chance he had, and T\u00e9a had to run interference. She had a long bucket list of places to visit. She had a new addition to the list, and she asked Todd to drop the charges against Cole. Todd didn't think it had anything to do with T\u00e9a, but she thought that it did. She pointed out that Cole was Hope's father, and Hope was Dani's niece. More importantly, he owed it to Starr, who had stood up for him, T\u00e9a concluded. She also knew that the state wouldn't have a case without Todd.\n\n\nDani thought that it could take a lifetime to learn about her mother, but Nate had an idea. He suggested she interview her mom and ask her everything she had a question about. It could be videotaped, and Dani would have a memoir. Dani thought it was a fabulous idea and as she put her arms around Nate to give him a kiss, Todd yelled for the couple to halt. Todd called Nate \"Lover Boy\" and Dani ordered Todd to stop calling him that. Dani insisted they were allowed to kiss. \"Says who?\" Todd inquired. \"Me,\" T\u00e9a responded.\n\n\nT\u00e9a announced that Todd and Nate had to leave because Todd had something to do. Todd thought the girls deserved some \"alone time.\" He berated Nate further for some of the boy's comments, and T\u00e9a yelled at Todd to shut up. Dani ordered her father to be nice to Nate on the way back to Llanview, and as the men walked away, Todd informed Nate there were \"ground rules to discuss.\"\n\n\nLater, the women stood next to a fountain and T\u00e9a explained how her mother had given her pennies to toss into the fountain for wishes. That was one thing she remembered about her mother. She instructed Dani to close her eyes and make a wish and throw her penny into the water. Dani obeyed and asked T\u00e9a if her own wishes had ever turned out to be true. T\u00e9a gently put her hands on her daughter's face and looked into her eyes. \"The most important one,\" she said.\n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Hannah walked around her bedroom and announced to the empty space that she was not crazy and had no reason to be there because she didn't push Marty. Suddenly, she imagined she saw Cole when he arrived to visit her. Her imaginary visitor begged her not to give up on life as she explained that she had to save him from Eli. She had no clue why Eli had pushed Marty or hurt Ford, but she was sure that Eli had pressured Ford into blaming her the way he had pressured her into acting crazy. She could understand it if Cole didn't believe her.\n\n\nCole assured her he believed her and would see to it that everyone else did too. He understood that she lied to protect him, but he didn't think that would stop Eli. He thought they might have a short breather before Eli would make another move. He promised to help Hannah, since she saved his life. He suggested that she \"scheme\" her way out of St. Anne's; he was sure she could find a way. Cole pronounced that after she escaped, they could team up and put Eli away. Just then, Hannah was roused from her daydream when an orderly knocked on her door. He had a meal for her and as he walked in, she saw his phone.\n\n\nShe pretended to cry and requested a tissue. She admitted she was lonely with no one to talk to. She balked at his suggestion that she speak to her counselor and maintained that he would only put her on drugs. She watched him text and proclaimed that he was lucky to have a girlfriend to talk to. The young man revealed that he didn't have a girlfriend, and Hannah invited him to stay and chat. He put his phone down on a nearby table.\n\n\nLater, Hannah assured the orderly she felt better as he left her room. He noted that he was the one who had done all the talking. She turned around and smiled as she looked at the young man's phone.\n\n\nAs Starr and Cole prepared to leave for Cole's court appearance, Starr did her best to initiate a discussion about Hannah. Cole refused to talk even though Starr implored him to clear things up. She noted that they always argued whenever she broached the subject. Cole reminded her that Hannah had a breakdown, but Starr accused him of always defending Hannah. She remarked that Hannah was a menace who had manipulated Cole, but he blamed himself for many of the incidents that had occurred. He felt guilty, though Starr noted that John had believed in Hannah too.\n\n\nDeciding it was time, Cole confessed that he had almost slept with Hannah, but nothing had happened. Starr asked if he'd kissed Hannah, and Cole acknowledged that he did. Starr pushed for all of the details and continued to barrage Cole with questions. She inquired whether Cole and Hannah had removed their clothes, and Cole reluctantly declared they had. Starr began to cry and asked Cole, \"How could you do that to us?\" She shrieked that she hated Cole. He insisted he had been confused, and he loved her. Starr didn't think that was true.\n\n\nCole tried to explain that he thought Starr had slept with James, especially after he found her diploma and the condom wrapper. Starr was furious that he blamed her for his tryst with Hannah, and she emphasized she had left to protect him. Cole admitted he had been trying to get back at Starr. She demanded to know if he had feelings for Hannah. Starr indicated that she felt sorry for Hannah, but the young woman had managed to get Cole away for one reason, and that was to have him for herself. Cole reminded Starr that Starr left town because she said she needed time away, but it wasn't true. Starr again stated that she had lied to protect Cole, but Cole questioned how he would have known that.\n\n\nStarr wondered what had happened to them because they used to be a team. Cole thought they still were, but Starr insisted that he was still on Hannah's side. Cole maintained that he just wanted to know the truth. Starr declared that Hannah had confessed, and she was amazed that Cole didn't seem to believe Hannah's confession.\n\n\nCole agreed that Hannah had not really seen Todd push Marty, but he was doubtful that she committed any crime. She had moved on from Ford, so he didn't think she would have attacked him. Starr proclaimed that Hannah had moved on to Cole, but Cole repeated that nothing had happened. He had lost his mind briefly, but he didn't want Hannah. His world revolved around Starr and Hope, and he wanted Starr's forgiveness. Starr knew that Cole loved them, but she thought it was time for them to head to court. She walked out, and a distressed Cole remained still.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Eli made a quick call to the Boston hotel and requested they deliver a package he had left at the desk, to Rex. Eli arrived at La Boulaie and knocked on the door. Blair opened it, but when she saw Eli, she slammed the door in his face. He knocked again, and she opened the door and accused him of lying about his previous night's whereabouts. She wondered what else he had lied about and thought that he was a \"lying dog.\"\n\n\nShe compared him to Todd and stated she had wasted too much time with men like Todd. She couldn't be with a man who lied. Eli was offended and told her he had a good reason to lie because he had a secret. Blair growled that she hated secrets, but Eli insisted that she wouldn't be able to find anyone better than him. He thought Blair would kick herself when she learned about his true mission. Claiming to have been on a plane to New York City to make arrangements for their future, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a diamond engagement ring. Blair squealed, thrilled with her new accessory, and forgave Eli for his lapse. They kissed and made up.\n\n\nAfter Eli left, Blair ran to show Dorian her new acquisition, but Dorian wasn't around. Instead, she admired the ring herself and said, \"Boy can you pick 'em.\"\n\n\nKelly knocked on Rex's Boston hotel room door and called his name repeatedly. After some time had elapsed, Rex finally opened his eyes and tumbled from the bed. Staggering and bleary-eyed, he pulled the door open and asked Kelly why she was visiting him so late at night. She yelled at him that it was daylight and, worried that she hadn't heard from him the night before, she had flown to Boston. She was angry that he had decided to party and clearly, she wouldn't pay him for his time.\n\n\nRex was unable to recall if he had met with his contact and couldn't remember anything after he began to eat his dinner. He couldn't understand why he hadn't heard from his contact. He looked at his phone and saw several calls from Kelly as well as a call and text message from Gigi. He insisted he would have picked up, since he had established special ring tones for both women.\n\n\nJust then, the room phone rang, and Rex answered it. He learned that the front desk had a package for him. He asked about his room service bill, and the desk clerk advised him that he had signed for it when the food was delivered. Rex watched Kelly begin to help herself to some of the food on the room service cart, but Kelly ignored him as he shouted to her. He had no choice but to grab her and wrestle her onto the bed, knocking the food from her hand. Rex declared that Bennett Thompson had probably been to his room and drugged the salsa.\n\n\nKelly was skeptical, but Rex insisted that he wasn't a heavy sleeper. He didn't sign for the food, and he didn't eat much, which was something he always did. He asked for Kelly's trust and thought that if Bennett Thompson had made it look like Melinda and Rodney had died from heart attacks, he was certainly capable of poisoning Rex's food. Kelly wondered why Bennett hadn't intercepted the package, but Rex thought that he actually had. He pointed out that Glenn, the Hall of Records clerk, didn't know what Rex looked like. Thompson might have met with him and accepted the package. Kelly added that he could have removed what pertained to himself.\n\n\nRex suggested they head to the Hall of Records and speak to Glenn. They might be able to find out who Bennett Thompson really was.\n\n\nEli arrived at the courtroom and, alone, opened his briefcase. He pulled out a document from Boston that read \"Hall of Records.\" The name of Bennett Thompson was there along with the heading of Evangeline Williamson, attorney at law. There were check marks in different columns headed \"attended\" and \"wanted again,\" and the dates included the years 2001 and 2002. He hastily shoved it back just before Cole and Starr walked in.\n\n\nEli asked Starr to wait outside so that he could speak to his client. He told Cole that he wanted to get the charges dropped, and he thought that if Cole blamed his actions on Hannah, they would have success. Cole didn't like the idea, but Eli asserted that Hannah was troubled and certainly a cause for the attack on Todd. Just then, Cole's phone rang. It was Hannah. Out in the hallway, Starr sat on a bench and waited. She looked up at Todd as he approached her. He smiled tentatively at his daughter. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "While stuck at St. Anne's after Eli threatened her, Hannah knows she has to contact Cole. So she distracts a security guard to get his phone and calls him. Meanwhile, Cole is torn between Starr telling him that Hannah manipulated him, almost got his probation revoked, wanted to break them up, pushed his mom, tried to kill Ford, and got Todd falsely accused of pushing Marty. But he somehow knows that Hannah might not have done the crimes. Eli represents him in court and tells him he can help him beat the charges if he blames Hannah for everything. Meanwhile, Todd, Tea, Dani and Nate all go to New York and Tea shows them where she grew up. Tea manages to persuade Todd to drop the charges against Cole. Eli is up to no good after drugging Rex. Kelly finds Rex who informs her he knows that Bennett Thompson has been there and drugged him in his hotel room. Blair is at first suspicious of Eli when she finds out he lied to her about where he was when they could not see each other. But he gives her an engagement ring and she warms up to him and forgives him.",
