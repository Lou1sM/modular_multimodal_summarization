Todd needed to tell T\u00e9a something about himself. He admitted that he'd gotten involved in business with very dangerous people. He told her that the most dangerous one had been the one who'd kidnapped Sam, but he was dead. T\u00e9a asked if Todd or Tomas had killed the man, but Todd assured her that neither had. He swore that it had been taken care of.\n\n\nTodd continued that, as a father and husband, he was bound to protect his family. He didn't want to lose his loved ones. T\u00e9a wondered why he talked that way. Todd admitted that it felt like he'd already lost them in some ways. She countered that \"keeping a secret is not a turn-on.\" He related that she'd kept Dani a secret from him, but they'd gotten past it.\n\n\nTodd thought that he and T\u00e9a would always hurt each other, but they would always love each other. He wished he could promise that he would never hurt, or lie to her again, but he couldn't. Even though he knew he didn't deserve it, he asked her to trust him. T\u00e9a ripped his shirt open, and kissed him. The two started to undress each other. A short while later, T\u00e9a told Todd that she was willing to trust him.\n\n\nDorian looked through racks of possible dresses to wear for the movie premiere, but rejected every one. Dorian wondered what Ionia would be wearing, or if she would even dare to show up. David assured Dorian that at least Echo would be in Statesville. Dorian reminded David that Rex was trying to blackmail her into dropping the charges, but she refused to agree to Rex's terms. Dorian related that she had more important things to think about for that night. David left to take care of errands before the premiere.\n\n\nRoxy decorated Foxy Roxy's as Cristian touched up the portrait mural on the wall. She explained to Cristian that she was very busy getting ready for the business that the premiere would cause, so she had to hire someone else to help. On cue, Rama entered. Roxy had to take care of some errands, so she handed Rama a nail file, and left. Rama saw Cristian, and insisted that she would leave. Cristian assured her that he'd been mad at her, but he'd cooled off. He missed their friendship. He related that Vimal was really the one who'd gotten hurt.\n\n\nRama remembered that Vimal's parents were in town, and wondered how they'd taken the news that she wasn't pregnant, or with Vimal. Just then, a customer, who happened to be Mrs. Patel, entered the salon. Rama couldn't face the woman, and begged Cristian to do something. Cristian offered help to Mrs. Patel, who wanted her nails done for the premiere. As Cristian sat to do Mrs. Patel's nails, she babbled on about how she'd hoped to treat Rama to a manicure, but Rama was nursing her sick friend Aubrey back to health.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face awoke with a start, and John assumed that the man had experienced a bad dream. The man related that he'd had a dream about someone stealing his name and life. \"Oh wait, that's real,\" he added. John told the man that he was going to do a DNA test to make sure that the man was who he claimed to be. The man didn't want to, because he was afraid that he really was crazy. John instructed the man to \"open wide.\" John wrapped up the DNA sample, and directed the man to stay at John's. John promised to find out who the real Todd was.\n\n\nA short while later, the man dried his hair with a towel, as Roxy entered. The man covered his head and face. Thinking the man was John, Roxy told the man that she needed to talk to him. Roxy wasn't happy with the way John had treated Natalie, so the man grunted in response. Roxy wanted to look him in the eye, and know that they could still be friends. She tried to pull the towel off his head, but he pulled it tighter. She suddenly realized that she had to get back to the salon for appointments, and left.\n\n\nMrs. Patel admired her newly done nails. David entered the salon, and called out to Roxy to make him \"handsomer.\" Mrs. Patel was ecstatic to see David, and exclaimed that she was his biggest fan. She hugged him, and took a picture with him. Roxy returned and admired Mrs. Patel's nails, as the woman left.\n\n\nCristian returned to Rama, who couldn't believe that Vimal had lied to his parents. She wondered how Vimal would explain why Rama wouldn't be at the premiere. She wanted to show up at the premiere to help Vimal out, but realized that she wouldn't look pregnant. \"What if I could get you pregnant?\" Cristian suggested. At Rama's confusion, he picked up an empty balloon, and offered to blow it up for her.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Viki wanted to talk about Natalie's relationship with Brody. She assured Natalie that Jessica hadn't meant it when she suggested that Natalie move out of Llanfair. Viki wanted Natalie to understand that Jessica was hurting. Viki asked how strong Natalie's feelings were for Brody. She wondered if the relationship was out of convenience, or if the two really loved each other.\n\n\nNatalie told Viki that she finally had a chance at the family she'd always wanted. Natalie added that she and Brody had decided to find a place away from Angel Square. Viki wondered if Natalie still had feelings for John. Natalie related that she'd always have feelings for John, but she'd moved on. She hoped to be close with Jessica again one day, but she didn't want to feel guilty for being happy. Viki wanted her daughter happy, as long as it was with the right guy.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the Sun and found Vimal. Brody wanted to know whether or not Vimal was going to tell John about Liam. As Vimal was about to answer, John entered. He wondered why Brody was there, to which Brody replied that he was working on the Jack Manning attack. John said that he'd meet Brody at the station to go over the lead he'd gotten in the case, and Brody left.\n\n\nJohn was looking for Todd, but Vimal informed John that Todd hadn't been in yet. John wanted to wait, and sat down on the couch in Todd's office. Vimal left, and John got up to look around Todd's desk. He kicked open a drawer, and found a case inside. He unzipped the case, took out a toothbrush, and bagged it.\n\n\nBrody stopped Vimal in the hallway, and asked for Vimal's decision. Vimal revealed that he believed that Brody and Natalie would care for Liam and raise him well, so he agreed not to tell John the truth. Satisfied, Brody walked away.\n\n\nTodd arrived in front of his office, but Vimal stopped him. He wondered if the envelope in Todd's hand contained tickets for David's movie premiere. He told Todd how big a fan of David's that Mrs. Patel was, and how she'd love to go to the premiere. Todd wondered why he would give tickets to Vimal. Vimal replied that he'd been keeping the paternity secret. Todd countered that he'd given Vimal a job. Todd had a large block of tickets and agreed to give three to Vimal, as per his request. Todd went into his office, and demanded to know why John was there.\n\n\nA short while later, Mrs. Patel arrived at the Sun. She excitedly told Vimal that she'd met David. He showed his mother the movie tickets. Mrs. Patel was excited for \"the four of us\" to have fun at the premiere. When she walked away, Vimal realized he'd need another ticket for Rama.\n\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Clint demanded, as Rex entered Clint's hospital room. Rex wanted Clint to threaten Dorian with an attempted murder lawsuit if Dorian didn't drop the charges against Echo. Rex urged Clint to do it for Shane, who Clint claimed to care about. Rex didn't want Shane to lose anyone else. He dialed Dorian's number on his phone, and handed it to Clint.\n\n\nWhen Dorian answered, Clint told her that he would charge her with attempted murder if she didn't drop the charges against Echo. She knew Rex had gotten to Clint, but Clint only told her how much she would have to lose. She reluctantly agreed, and told him that he made a good bully. Clint said that he expected immediate action, and hung up the phone.\n\n\nClint warned Rex that messing with Todd was a dangerous game. Rex wasn't afraid, but Clint told him to be wary of his obsession for revenge. Natalie and Viki entered, and sensed the tension in the room. Rex had nothing left to say, so he left, followed by Natalie. Clint told Viki that he would soon be allowed to leave the hospital. Viki reminded him that he would be going straight to Statesville, and wondered why he was letting it happen. Clint refused to discuss the matter, and related that he'd just have to make his last days of freedom count.\n\n\nNatalie wondered how Rex was doing. She wanted to spend the rest of the day with him, Shane, and Liam, but Rex told her they could spend time together another time. As Rex left, Brody entered. She told him that Viki knew they were moving in together, and hugged him.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang at La Boulaie, and Blair answered it to Tomas. Tomas wanted to see Blair so he could \"come clean\" with her, starting with the CIA file. A short while later, Blair was shocked to find out that Tomas had been a CIA agent. He also explained how he'd tried to stop Todd's shooting. He hadn't told her because it hadn't been safe, but he had decided to tell her because he cared about her.\n\n\nBlair was relieved that Tomas seemed to be one of the good guys. He wondered if she was scared, but she kissed him, and let him know that she wasn't. Dorian entered, and asked if Tomas was going to escort Blair to the premiere that night. Tomas said that he'd love to take Blair. Dorian reminded Blair of her appointment with Roxy, so Blair left. Before Tomas could leave, Dorian wanted to talk to him about Todd.\n\n\nDorian explained that Todd had been the love of Blair's life. Dorian believed that every man Blair had been with after Todd had been a purposely bad choice in order to leave Blair stuck on Todd. Dorian wanted Blair to meet someone to break the cycle. Tomas took Dorian's hands, and said, \"I hope I'm the one.\"\n\n\nWhen Tomas was gone, David returned. He assured her that everything was set for later that night. Noticing that something was wrong with Dorian, David wondered what it was. She explained her conversation with Clint, and revealed that she had to drop the charges against Echo. Both agreed not to think about it, and to concentrate on having fun at the premiere. They vowed to let nothing ruin \"the biggest night of our lives.\"\n\n\nAs the man with Todd's original face picked up the paper, John's phone rang. The answering machine picked up for Tomas, who needed to talk to John about Todd. As he told John to call back when he could, the man scrambled to pick up the phone. He put on a gruff voice, and pretended to be John.\n\n\n",
