Once inside, John and Blair began to feel the effects of the wine and flirted with one another. Feeling a bit uncomfortable, Blair stated that it might be a good idea if she drove home. John reminded her that she had consumed a large amount of alcohol, and suggested that she spend the night. Without much convincing, Blair agreed to stay overnight. After several playful exchanges, John and Blair shared a passionate kiss on John's bed. \n\n\nInside Marty's bedroom, Todd was relieved after learning that Marty didn't have any memory of the rape. He appeared tormented after giving her vivid details of the rape. Although she remained calm, Marty asked Todd what had happened to the men who raped her. Without giving any names, Todd told her that they had all suffered dearly for the vicious act that they had perpetrated against her. Upon learning that the ringleader had been released from prison on a pardon, Marty questioned why. Todd assured Marty that the \"bastard\" had lost everything and was totally alone. Racked with guilt, Todd apologized for not helping Marty on that fateful night. Believing Todd was a true friend, Marty didn't blame him and felt terrible for making him relive that night. \n\n\nAs the storm raged, Marty insisted that she didn't want to be alone and asked Todd to spend the night in her room. Todd hesitated and asked if his presence would make Marty feel uncomfortable. After Marty assured him that it wouldn't, Todd took a seat next to her bed. Todd vowed to never let anyone hurt Marty again. \n\n\nIn Viki's hospital room, Charlie was elated to learn that Viki would make a full recovery. While Viki was surprised to learn that Dorian had told Charlie that she was in the hospital, Charlie was shocked to find out that Dorian had saved Viki's life. Charlie questioned whether he had misjudged Dorian, but Viki assured him that one act of kindness didn't make Dorian a changed woman. Viki was certain that something had motivated Dorian to do the right thing. \n\n\nCharlie apologized for disturbing Viki and stated that he only wanted to make sure that she was all right. He understood that her feelings for him had changed and didn't want to upset her. Viki said that her feelings for Charlie hadn't changed. Viki told Charlie about her conversation with Dorian. She informed Charlie that Dorian revealed that she didn't have sex with him the night he was in her bed. Surprised that Dorian would tell such a lie, Charlie wondered if Viki had believed Dorian. Admitting that she wasn't certain, Viki reminded Charlie that no matter how drunk he was that night-Viki was the woman that had been on his mind. \n\n\nA frustrated Charlie began blaming himself for taking a drink that night. He was determined to learn what events had led him to hit the bottle again. Viki begged Charlie to stop tormenting himself, but Charlie stated that his actions had caused him to lose the woman that he loved. When a nurse commented that Viki had been considered clinically dead for several minutes, Charlie became emotional. Realizing that he could have lost Viki forever, Charlie said that he would do whatever it took to win Viki back. Charlie promised to win back Viki's love and trust. He said that he couldn't imagine his life without her. Viki told Charlie that she believed that she had lived for a reason. A tearful Viki told Charlie that she missed him. She said that she wasn't in any condition to make a decision concerning their relationship, but expressed her pleasure that he had come to see her. Viki asked Charlie to stay with her for a while. Charlie announced that he would stay with Viki for as long as she wanted. \n\n\nAt the diner, Addie was oblivious to what was going on between David and Dorian. David demanded that Dorian give him the papers, but Dorian reminded David that they had made a deal. Fed up with the arguing, Addie snatched the papers from Dorian and ripped them into pieces. As a triumphant David gloated and attempted to escort Addie back to LaBoulaie for a night of passion, Dorian informed him that she wasn't an idiot-her lawyer had a duplicate copy of the forms. \n\n\nDavid tried to convince Dorian how happy he made Addie feel, but Dorian refused to listen to his plea and demanded that he tell Addie about the annulment or else she would. David reminded Dorian that he signed the papers only because Dorian would have allowed Viki to die if he hadn't. Dorian denied that she would have allowed any harm to come to Viki. Cornered, David told Addie how much he enjoyed being with her and then broke the news that he was leaving her. A stunned Addie asked David to explain. Interjecting, Dorian revealed to Addie that David had signed annulment papers. Dorian admitted to convincing David to give Addie back her freedom. Addie stated that she wasn't delusional and resented Dorian for interfering in her life. Lashing out at Dorian, Addie told Dorian to get out of her life. Dorian pleaded with Addie to understand that David was simply using her. Turning to David, Addie said that it wasn't over and promised him that Dorian wouldn't win in the end. Before exiting the diner, Addie gave David a kiss. \n\n\nDorian demanded to know why David had changed his mind about the annulment, but he refused to give her any information. David reminded Dorian that he was suffering because he wanted to save Viki's life. Stating that she couldn't care less about David's suffering, a gleeful Dorian told David that his ride on the gravy train was over. Once Dorian left, David pulled out the check that he had received from Clint. As he placed a flame to the check, David moaned, \"Viki, I hope your ten million dollar lease on life was worth it!\" Leaving the burning check behind, David exited the diner.\n\n\n",
