Cole felt that it was his obligation to work undercover to rid his school of  drug sellers. John gave him some marked money and a phone that would enable him to track Cole. They assured Marty that Cole was also wired. Cole promised he would stay clean and that all he had to do was look at those selling drugs to see what he would have been like if he had not stopped using. He assured his mom that he would call Rachel if he needed her and that he would not put himself in danger.\n\n\nJohn asked Marty to trust them. She admitted that she had gone to see Todd, feeling stuck after a year. She was hoping he'd set her free but she only got to vent instead, she explained. Todd even wanted her to psycho-analyze him but she was the one who needed help, she continued. John admitted that he and Blair had signed their divorce papers and he was free. Marty was happy and was ready to move on.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, T\u00e9a promised Matthew that she was putting together a list of expert witnesses for the surgery as well as character witnesses to testify about Matthew's maturity. Matthew revealed that he had his own plan to settle out of court. A quizzical T\u00e9a learned that Matthew had leverage. He found something more effective than the law, he told her. T\u00e9a advised him that she was not ready to cancel his court date, in case things didn't work out.\n\n\nBo arrived to help Clint get ready for the wedding and bumped into Nora. She thought they should talk about their kiss. Bo thought it was inevitable while Nora thought it was wrong. They both agreed it was crazy. Nora advised Bo that she loved Clint and was getting ready to marry him. As she started to explain further, T\u00e9a walked by on her way out. The attorney told them that their son had something to share with them.\n\n\nNora and Bo were thrilled to learn that Matthew was dropping his lawsuit against them. Nora felt it made for a great wedding gift and Bo was proud that Matthew had realized the surgery was too risky. Their happiness was short lived when Matthew handed them a consent form to sign. They refused to grant their permission for the surgery and were confused. Matthew sprung his ultimatum then and advised them that he saw them \"making out\" and was prepared to tell Clint about it.\n\n\nA stuttering Bo and Nora attempted to justify their kiss, that it was merely a congratulatory kiss and it meant nothing. Matthew felt otherwise and wondered if Clint would believe it. He once thought it would be great for his parents to get back together, he admitted, but now only cared about his surgery. His parents refused to bow to blackmail. Matthew shrugged and told them he thought of it as business, not blackmail. As he went off to look for Clint, Nora could only sigh that it was out of their hands.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr and Blair had a chat in the backyard. Starr explained how worried she was about Cole. Blair stressed that she was extremely proud of Cole and of how Starr had conducted herself during the ups and downs of her relationship with Cole. They agreed that life was difficult when love was involved. Starr quickly divulged that she had heard about Blair and Todd in the cabana, much to Blair's horror. When Blair tried to deny it, Starr held up the baby monitor, admitting she had heard Dorian and Todd talking about it.\n\n\nBlair refused to discuss it at first but Starr urged her mother on, reminding her that she was an adult. Blair admitted that she had been upset when T\u00e9a was all over Todd and she had also been upset about herself and John. She had hoped their marriage would work out and it was her own fault that \"one thing had led to another,\" she told her daughter. Starr assured her mother that she was behind her 100 percent, the same as Blair was with her. Starr wondered if Blair wanted to be with Todd.\n\n\nInside, Dorian wondered where T\u00e9a could be and was hopeful that she was moving in. Todd assured her that T\u00e9a was thinking it over. Dorian admitted that she desperately wanted Blair's feelings for Todd to be destroyed. Todd suggested that Dorian needed \"some action\" herself. She was not amused. As Blair prepared to answer Starr's question, Starr spotted Todd lingering nearby. Blair spat that she wanted nothing to do with Todd, even if he was the last man on earth. Dorian exclaimed how happy she was to hear that and Dorian suggested that Blair find a new man.\n\n\nSuddenly, T\u00e9a walked in, using the key that Todd had provided for her. Starr fled with a hasty excuse to check on her baby. Todd assumed that T\u00e9a was moving in but she had other news for him. She did not want to be a pawn between Todd and Blair or someone who was just a willing sex partner, she told Todd. She wanted to be romanced, wanted flowers, dinners, champagne and dates. Her man had to have eyes for only her, she added.\n\n\nArriving at Rex's loft, Schuyler was surprised to see that Stacy was still there. He made it known that he didn't believe she was pregnant. Stacy assured him she was, pointing out the baby research she was doing on the computer. She explained how it was good for all of them if she was pregnant, since Schuyler would end up with Gigi when Rex left her for Stacy. She insisted that she and Rex were \"real.\" She volunteered to take another pregnancy test and suggested that Schuyler speak up on his feelings for Gigi.\n\n\nRex and Gigi decided it was time for a talk. Rex admitted that he didn't tell her about sleeping with Stacy because he didn't want to hurt her. Gigi explained that he had his chance and she was humiliated when she had to hear about it from Stacy. Rex confessed that he blamed it all on Gigi since she destroyed their family and pushed him into Stacy's arms. He felt she should have trusted him but she broke his heart instead. He added that she should have spoken to a priest or a \"shrink\" instead of taking the action that she did. He revealed that Stacy felt his relationship with Gigi must not have been very solid if they had broken apart so easily. Gigi had put a knife in his heart.\n\n\nA crying Gigi admitted that she didn't blame Rex for sleeping with Stacy, but only herself. They agreed to forgive each other and to start over. They promised to not let anything come between them again, including a baby. Rex was not buying Stacy's pregnancy story yet, especially since they had only had sex once. Gigi reminded him that the same thing had happened with her. They shared a kiss and agreed they were solid.\n\n\nStarr called Cole and told him of the latest with her crazy parents. She told him she was proud of him and loved him. John wanted to get started and Marty had to leave. Once she was gone, John ordered Cole to stick to the script and not to \"go all maverick.\" Cole called Asher and advised him that he needed to see him. He sent a text to Starr to tell her it was starting and hoped it would all be over soon.\n\n\nArriving at the hospital, Rex and Gigi attempted to get information from the doctor who saw Stacy in the emergency room. The doctor refused to disclose anything, but Stacy and Schuyler arrived shortly after. Stacy requested a new blood test and Schuyler offered to go with her, to make sure things were done correctly. Stacy asked that Rex accompany her instead. Rex pulled away from her quickly when she tried to grab his arm and ordered her to not speak to him. Schuyler learned that Gigi and Rex were stronger than ever. \"That's really great,\" he said without much enthusiasm.\n\n\nRex assured Gigi that he had watched every step of the blood test. When the doctor arrived with the results, Stacy assured her it was okay to announce them in front of everyone. The results were positive, the doctor told them. As an elated Stacy asked Rex to escort her to her future sonogram, the others were quiet and troubled.\n\n\nGetting down on his knee, Todd made T\u00e9a another proposal. He asked her out on a date to his sister's wedding and she accepted. Blair threw T\u00e9a a death look as the attorney chuckled on her way out.\n\n\nAsher appeared at Cole's place and wondered who was paying for the great apartment. Cole advised him he was doing community service but wanted to talk to him. Asher laid a variety of drugs in plastic bags on the table. Cole advised him that he wasn't interested in using but in selling. \n\n\n",
