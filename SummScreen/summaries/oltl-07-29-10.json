He was engaged in a war of words with Dorian as they each updated their MyFace accounts with news of their new relationships. David informed the surprised couple that he resided at Llanfair thanks to Viki. He paused to enjoy a feast, which caused Jessica to gag, and he vigorously assured her that she hadn't gotten sick from eating his fresh-baked muffins.\n\n\nOutside, Natalie spoke to Gigi on the phone and revealed that she hadn't yet made her decision regarding an abortion. She knew that she didn't want to ruin Jessica's happiness, she was worried about John, and she didn't want to cause Jessica so much trauma that she would have to return to St. Anne's. Gigi suggested that Natalie think about what she herself wanted and not worry about everyone else. Clint arrived via the garden and ran into Natalie. He wanted to know what was wrong because she appeared ill. Natalie claimed she was dehydrated after being sick the previous day.\n\n\nJessica announced that Clint was on his way over, and David did his best to hide from his uncle when Clint walked in. Natalie joined the group, and Jessica announced her pregnancy. David wondered why Natalie was still sick if it really wasn't the muffins that caused the women to be ill.\n\n\nAwkwardly, Natalie informed the group that she had been suffering from sympathy pains since she and Jessica were twins. Clint thought she still looked ill, but Natalie felt better and decided she would go to work after all. Skeptically, David turned to look at her as she left. Clint turned his attention to Jessica and Brody and asked if the pair planned on giving their new child its daddy's name.\n\n\nOver at La Boulaie, Dorian sat at her desk and updated her MyFace status to include news of her new boyfriend with a large income. Blair walked in and flaunted her hand in Dorian's face so that Dorian would see Blair's new engagement ring. Dorian was thrilled enough to pull herself away from the computer. She was proud of Eli and noted that the man had proven himself. She compared him to David, who was a \"louse and loser.\" Blair explained that she had been angry at Eli for lying about his whereabouts, but she later found out he had gone to New York City to purchase the ring. She thought he had been \"up to no good.\"\n\n\nDorian assured Blair that \"Eli is not Todd,\" and Blair finally had a man who wouldn't cause her disappointment or pain. Eli and Blair had Dorian's blessing, Dorian proclaimed. \"Just don't screw this up,\" Dorian warned her niece, or Blair would regret it. They wondered if David really had a new relationship. Dorian thought he was ridiculous, but Blair spoke up. Dorian had never hidden her true feelings about Todd, and she thought that Dorian should follow her own advice. She recommended that Dorian get David out of her life. Dorian jumped up, suddenly remembering that she was late for \"something.\" Blair chuckled to herself. Dorian had fallen for it \"hook, line, and sinker.\"\n\n\nLangston looked at her phone and noticed that someone had sent Ford a text message. Puzzled, she headed towards the hospital to see him.\n\n\nWhile at the hospital, Ford received a phone call from Hannah at St. Anne's. She wanted his help, but Ford played dumb and denied that he knew anyone named Eli Clarke. He reminded her that she was the one who had attacked him, not Eli. He ended the call and was surprised to see Langston enter James's room. Langston explained that she had misplaced her phone and, though she recently found it again, she noticed that someone had sent him a text message to meet with them at La Boulaie. She asked who had sent the text and whether he had gone.\n\n\nFord admitted that he had shown up, but he claimed he didn't know who sent the text, and no one was there when he arrived. Langston asked about James, and Ford assured her his brother was doing well. He confessed that he had \"messed up\" his brother. First their mother had left the house, and then he did, even though he promised James he would return. Their father was a criminal, but Ford wasn't able to take care of James on his own. Ford considered himself to be worse than his mother because he had promised to go back for James while his mother hadn't. Langston offered to help Ford out.\n\n\nHe was sorry for unloading on her, but he had no one else to talk to, a dejected Ford revealed. She began to console him, a nurse knocked at the door, which disturbed them, and advised Cole that his blood test results were negative. Langston pushed Ford for information. She asked if he had suspected he had an STD. She wanted to know whether she might have it. Ford was evasive as Langston lost her composure and began to shriek.\n\n\nHe assured her he had been with the woman after Langston, but she shouted even louder. She couldn't believe that he had already slept with someone else. Not only had they ended their relationship a relatively short time before, but he had also been in the hospital for some time. She accused him of being a \"player\" and stormed out.\n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Hannah heard her locked doorknob rattling as she tried to seek help on her pilfered phone. She hastily hid the phone as Eli summoned an orderly to unlock the door. He demanded she hand over the phone and threatened her to ensure that she did what he wanted. She reluctantly gave it to him as he commanded her to tell him why she had called Cole. Defeated, she declared Eli the winner. She just wanted his promise that he wouldn't harm Cole.\n\n\nEli lied that he had fought \"tooth and nail\" and was able to save Cole from going to jail. He thought that Hannah should refrain from pulling another foolish stunt, or he would kill Cole. Hannah assured him that no one believed anything she said anyway, since everyone thought she was crazy. Hannah inquired what Eli had planned for her. He advised her that she had better not put his plan in jeopardy, and once he got everything he needed, it would all be over. Hannah expressed her disbelief as he walked out.\n\n\nOnce outside of Hannah's room, Eli claimed that his phone didn't have a signal and asked the orderly if he could borrow the orderly's phone. He quickly scanned it to find out if Hannah had made any other calls. He saw Ford's number and phoned him. \"Hannah?\" Ford answered. Eli ordered Ford to reveal what Hannah had told him, but Ford said \"not a damn thing.\" Eli threatened Ford in order to prevent him from keeping anything secret in case he spoke to Hannah in the future.\n\n\nJohn spoke to Gigi at Rodi's and informed her that Natalie had called in sick to work. He asked Gigi what was wrong because he knew that Natalie was hiding something. Gigi wondered why he thought that, but they were interrupted when Rex and Kelly walked in. John was annoyed as Gigi ran over to Rex. Kelly headed over to John and told him that Rex had been drugged in Boston and the papers stolen. She felt that they were dealing with a man who would do anything to keep from getting caught.\n\n\nFurther, they were out of leads. Kelly wondered how the suspect had even known that Rex would be where he was. Kelly advised John that the only thing they knew was that the suspect was \"tall, dark, and handsome.\" John grew quiet and thought back to the night that Eli abruptly left Rodi's right after Rex. Kelly realized that John might know something, and she called him on it. Instead, he leaped up and headed for the door.\n\n\nUnfortunately as John headed out, Natalie was walking inside. He asked her what was wrong because he knew she was in some kind of trouble. He refused to let it go if something was hurting her. Natalie agreed that something was bothering her. She was worried about Jessica and was afraid that something would happen to Jessica if she weren't always happy. She didn't want her sister to suffer, and Natalie would see to it that she didn't. Natalie would give up anything and do anything to be certain of that. John asked what Natalie thought she had to give up. He thought they could work on it together.\n\n\nGigi was angry at Rex for putting his life in danger, and she implored him to quit his job. Rex had his own reasons for keeping his job, including the ability to pay for college for Gigi. Rex admitted that he needed to get a blood test to check for the drug that he had been given, and Gigi assured him she wasn't finished. She wanted him to quit the job. Looking over at Natalie, Rex stated that he wanted to talk about his sister when he returned.\n\n\nNatalie prefaced her speech with \"whatever happens,\" but John was disappointed when Kelly interrupted again. \"You can run, but you can't hide,\" he told Natalie as she rose to give them privacy. Kelly asked what John thought he knew about Bennett Thompson. Natalie sauntered over to Gigi and informed her that she needed to take care of things right away.\n\n\nOut on the street, Bo pulled Inez over and advised her the car she was driving had a broken brake light. He also stated that she had been driving erratically. Inez apologized and told him she had been distracted. He forced her to leave her car to walk a straight line, and Inez wondered if he wanted her to touch her nose with her eyes closed or recite the alphabet backwards as well. She was on the verge of hysteria as she finally admitted that her son hated her because she had abandoned him and his brother.\n\n\nBo attempted to enter the conversation, but Inez grew frantic and wouldn't allow him to speak. She was guilty of abandonment and, holding out her hands, she encouraged him to arrest her. She'd destroyed her sons' lives, and she deserved any payback that she got. Inez thought her son would be very happy to learn that she had been arrested. Bo finally managed to talk, and he suggested that a payback wouldn't make the pain go away. She turned and began to cry on his shoulder as he put his arms around her.\n\n\nLater, the pair sat down on the curb next to Inez's car. She apologized for her behavior, but Bo assured her he had experience too. His own son sued Bo and Nora even though things turned out for the best. He thought maybe Inez's son would forgive her. Inez mentioned that she needed to care for the son she still had and she had to find a place to live pronto. \"Are you Nate's mother?\" Bo asked her. Inez assumed he knew from the newspapers, but Bo explained that he'd met Nate earlier in the day and had heard about the house. She was sorry to hear that they had both \"dumped\" on Bo. Nate was a \"good kid,\" Bo advised Inez.\n\n\nInez didn't want Nate to know about his two older brothers because she thought he'd be heartbroken to learn they were kept from him. She thanked Bo for giving her a better day than the one she had previously. He tried to hand her his business card and suggested she call upon him for help. She declined and told him there was nothing he could do about her other sons. Bo asked her to get in touch if she changed her mind.\n\n\nDavid announced that he would put Jessica's pregnancy on his \"MyFace\" page, but Jessica quickly quashed the idea. She didn't want Viki to find out about the pregnancy that way. Brody and Jessica headed outdoors for some privacy, and David was left behind with Clint. David asked Clint not to kill him, but Clint merely wanted Kimberly's whereabouts. David swore that he didn't know. He thought that men should give up women who were bad for them anyway.\n\n\nAs if on cue, Dorian stormed in and demanded that David print a retraction of his latest MyFace status. They each accused the other of creating false relationships and each embellished their faux new partners. As they taunted each other, Dorian suddenly latched onto Clint's arm. She declared that Clint was her new beau.\n\n\nOut in the garden, Brody advised Jessica that Clint had \"beat me to the punch.\" He told Jessica that he had told her previously that she was his home. She was also his sanity and his everything. Getting down on one knee and promising to buy her a ring, he asked her to marry him. Jessica enthusiastically accepted.\n\n\nAs Blair updated her own MyFace page with news of her engagement, Eli arrived. He informed her that he was able to get the charges against Cole dropped, and he had worked very hard in order to do so. Blair was proud of her man and eager to start planning her wedding. Eli suggested they get married that night.\n\n\nLangston returned and decided to delete the previous voicemail from Ford asking to see her again.\n\n\nHannah was grief-stricken as she realized she had no one to talk to, and no one to help her. All of a sudden, there was a knock at the door, and the nun informed her she had a visitor. It was Ford.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hannah calls Ford and urges him to do something about Eli as they both know that he tried to kill Ford and pushed Marty Saybrooke. Meanwhile, Nate's mom is out driving while upset. Bo stops her. She's afraid he's going to arrest her and admits that she has abandoned her two sons and her oldest son hates her. He tells her that he would like to help her and be her friend if she needs to talk. Kelly finds out that John is suspecting Eli as her mother's killer. Yet Blair is ready to marry Eli and suspects nothing.",
