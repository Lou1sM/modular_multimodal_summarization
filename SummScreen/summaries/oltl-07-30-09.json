He explained that Brody would not be able to divulge any information to anyone. Brody truthfully explained that he would have to tell Jessica, but would not tell anyone else about the case. He was honored to be chosen, and trusted John. He wondered what to tell everyone about the academy.\n\n\nJohn wanted Brody to inform everyone that he was rejected from the police academy and to keep working at Rodi's. Brody was to tell Jessica only, John continued, and John would be in touch with him. \"Consider this orientation,\" John concluded.\n\n\nIn his new apartment, Cole asked Asher to give some thought to making him a drug seller because he needed to pay for his apartment and support his family. A confused Asher wondered if Cole had to take care of his mother. He was surprised to learn that Cole's baby was alive and that Cole wanted Starr and Hope to move in when Starr turned 18. Cole added that with all he had been going through, it was tough to find a good job and he didn't have time to finish his high school education.\n\n\nAsher really didn't care to hear Cole's sob story but wanted to know how Cole was paying for the apartment. Cole lied that his mother had lent him rent for a couple of months but he needed cash. Asher was afraid that Cole would land him in jail, since Cole always had bad luck. Asher pointed out that a cop was always hanging around. Quickly covering, Cole declared that John was merely after his mother and didn't care about Cole at all. Asher wanted proof and handed Cole a pill to take.\n\n\nThinking hastily, Cole pointed out that if he started taking pills, it would eat their profits. He would find someone else to take him on and help him get started, he threatened. He knew plenty of people from \"rehab\" and would be able to have a good business. All of those people would be back on drugs or would want to be, and all they needed was a push. He would have lots of profits, he continued. Suddenly, Asher was ready to talk.\n\n\nPointing out that he was Cole's supplier, Asher suggested that Cole keep things moving. He expected to see plenty of cash or it wouldn't be good for either of them, he stated as he walked out the door. He ordered Cole not to speak to anyone but him for more drugs.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston scanned the classifieds in her attempt to find an apartment for Markko. She explained to Starr that life was too awkward for Markko at Llanfair and he was uncomfortable there. Starr couldn't believe that Markko's dad had disowned his son over something as simple as sex, especially safe sex. A suspicious Langston couldn't believe that Starr and Cole had slept together again one evening, unbeknownst to the rest of the family. Starr started to explain that she didn't know when she would see Cole again, but she promptly stopped talking.\n\n\nShe apologized for not being able to give out any information but stressed that someone might get hurt. She asked Langston not to say anything to Markko, as well. Langston offered to listen at any time if Starr wanted to talk. She was worried about her friend. Starr received a text message from Cole stating, \"won't be long now.\" She was worried too.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie asked Markko to choose a lipstick for her. The uneasy teen gratefully offered to cart dresses for Viki's wedding out to the car for Jessica, and made his quick escape. Bree rolled a ball out through the library door and followed it. An unseen man picked it up and also handed her a stuffed animal, an elephant. Showing her mom, she told Jessica that her daddy had given her the toy. Jessica peered out the door warily, but was annoyed and yelled at Bree to tell the truth. Natalie stopped Jessica and agreed to take the little girl to the church with her. She admitted that the toy did not look familiar to her. Jessica placed a phone call to Brody.\n\n\nNoelle paid Viki a visit and regretfully told her that she and Moe would not be able to attend the wedding. They were flying back to Texas to see Moe's ailing father. Mrs. Rivera showed up with a care package for Markko, including some money for her son and his expenses. She indicated that she felt her husband was wrong, but told her son to mind his manners. She expressed her gratitude for her son having a place to live. A disappointed Markko thought his mother was there to take him home. She promised to work on her husband.\n\n\nViki admitted that she hated being the center of attention and she was perfectly fine with sharing her wedding with an ex-husband. Noelle was eager to hear about Viki's past marriages and Viki obliged, though she advised Noelle that the stories were long and she only had time for a brief explanation. She showed pictures of all of her husbands: Joe Riley, twice; Steve Burke; Clint Buchanan, twice; Roger Gordon; Sloan Carpenter; and Ben Davidson. She had something nice to say about all of them. Noelle handed her a gift box that contained a framed photo of Viki and Charlie.\n\n\nBrody arrived to find a frantic Jessica exclaiming that Nash had been there. He was the one who always gave his daughter elephants and Bree had just received another one from him. Brody searched the grounds but came up empty. He figured that perhaps someone had given Bree the toy previously. He felt that Jessica was still upset from the incident at the lodge and had much in her life to cause her to feel stressed. He suggested that she speak to Dr. Levin at St. Ann's. As they spoke, someone was watching from outside.\n\n\nCiting the need to get to the church, Jessica and Brody were poised to leave. Suddenly, Jessica spotted a bouncing ball outside and a glimpse of a stranger.\n\n\nAt the church, Rachel tried to calm down a very stressed-out Nora. Advising her daughter that Matthew was part of her stress, Nora informed Rachel about Matthew wanting to tell Clint that he saw Bo and Nora kissing. Rachel felt that no one would believe such a lie, but meekly, Nora told her it was true. Rachel was shocked and wanted to know how it happened. Nora was unable to tell her, since she didn't know herself. She admitted to kissing him back when he kissed her.\n\n\nRachel figured out that rather than Nora tell Clint the truth, she was happy that Matthew was going to tell him. That way, the wedding would be cancelled for her. An unhappy Nora told Rachel to back off because she loved Clint and really didn't understand what had happened. Rachel insisted that it was best to postpone the wedding so that Nora would be able to deal with what happened, but Nora insisted it only happened once and it didn't mean she didn't love Clint.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Bo caught Matthew as the boy searched for Clint to tell him about Bo and Nora's kiss. Bo urged his son to do what he thought he had to do but warned him that other people would be hurt. He accused Matthew of only caring about himself. When Clint stepped from his room, he encountered Bo and Matthew outside of it. Bo announced that Matthew had something important to tell Clint. Startled, Matthew told Clint that he knew his uncle loved his mom, she loved him, and Matthew only wanted to make sure Clint would take care of her. Clint promised that he would and thanked Matthew for his blessing.\n\n\nClint went off to look for his cufflinks and Bo said how proud he was of Matthew. Matthew assured his dad that he didn't do it for him and that Bo was lucky. He planned on beating him in court, Matthew added. He didn't want to hurt Clint. Bo hurriedly called Nora and gave her the good news; Matthew never said anything to Clint about their kiss. Clint returned and admitted that he loved everything about Nora, including the things that drove him crazy, like still loving Bo. He admitted that he couldn't marry anyone who didn't love his brother. He wondered whom Bo was speaking to on the phone and why he had a funny expression on his face. Bo mentioned a problem at the station.\n\n\nMatthew placed a call to T\u00e9a, ordering her not to cancel their court date.\n\n\nNigel approached with a bottle and three glasses, stating that it was something special from Asa. Bo wondered why they didn't use the bottle when he was engaged to Lindsay. Clint toasted Bo, citing the finest brother a man could have. After Bo was gone, Clint trapped Nigel and forced him to admit that the toast was all his idea, not Asa's. Nigel admitted that he only wanted to ease the tension between the brothers.\n\n\nNora seemed disappointed that Clint hadn't been told the truth. Her daughter asked her if she still wanted to call off the wedding. She refused to discuss it further, but Rachel wanted to know if her mother loved Bo.\n\n\nMarkko headed to La Boulaie for some cheering up from Langston. He told her that his mother was not going to fight his dad on his choice to disown his son.\n\n\nBo visited Lindsay in jail and asked for her help.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Nora are both \"curious\" about whether Matthew will go through with informing Clint that he saw the two of them kissing before Nora's wedding day to Clint. He tells them no, he'll stay out of it. But he still won't accept their decision not to approve the surgery. When Rachel finds out her mother kissed Bo, she asks her if she really should marry Clint after all. Viki tells everybody she wants to marry Charlie. But she relives all of her many marriages. Langston and Markko are very disappointed that his father won't let him come home. Starr is missing Cole while he goes undercover. Cole goes and attempts to \"work\" Asher so that Asher will lead him to the drug dealers. John asks Brody to help the police station investigate the drug trafficking. Jessica doesn't know what to do when she notices Bree with an unidentified stuffed elephant. Bree tells her mom it's from Daddy. Jessica remembers that Nash gave their daughter elephant toys and only he would know about that. And she can tell that an unseen person is outside that could be Nash.",
