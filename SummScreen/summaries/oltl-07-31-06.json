Todd makes matters worse when he threatens Dr. Simmons for the failure of the surgery and exchanges harsh words with Cris and Nora in front of her. A frustrated Evangeline throws Todd out of her room and asks to speak with Nora alone. Dr. Simmons promises to run more tests to see if Evangeline would be a candidate for another procedure. Nora encourages Evangeline to stay positive citing her recovery as proof that miracles do happen. Evangeline puts on a brave face for Nora but then later confesses to Layla that she can no longer be hopeful and has to start accepting the fact that she will never regain her eyesight.\n\n\nNash is furious with Claudia blaming her for revealing his and Jessica's whereabouts. Claudia swears up and down that she did not tell Antonio where to find them but Nash isn't convinced and accuses Claudia of betraying him because she doesn't want to see him reunited with Tess. Claudia agrees that she is weary of his relationship with Tess because she doesn't want to see him get hurt. Nash angrily tells Claudia that he made a mistake thinking they could be friends. A hurt Claudia accuses him of making her believe they could be friends just so he could use her to keep Antonio away. Nash later finds Claudia and apologizes for his angry words which he said out of frustration since he wasn't able to bring Tess back before Antonio showed up.\n\n\nAntonio tells Jessica that he hopes that Nash realizes that Tess isn't coming back and decides to leave town and leave his baby behind. Jessica responds that she doesn't think that Nash will leave his baby and that she doesn't think he should since he loves Brennan so much. Antonio can't believe that Jessica would want a lying murderer around her baby but Jessica reminds him that what happened to Claudia's father was in accident and Nash would never hurt her or his child. Jessica reminds Antonio that Nash did everything he could to save his family just like Antonio did when he discovered that she and the baby were missing. She suggests that maybe Antonio and Nash aren't so different after all. Later, after getting Brennan to sleep, Jessica joins Antonio on the balcony and while Antonio is holding her Jessica's thoughts are of Nash.\n\n\nR.J. and Vincent bump into each other at Capricorn and after almost letting it slip that they have met before, they cover and act as if this is their first encounter. R.J. questions Vince about his business dealings and then makes him a business offer that Vince shoots down. While the men go to the bar to get a few drinks, Lindsay quizzes Layla about how much she really knows about Vince. Layla feels that she knows enough and Lindsay has no room to talk since R.J. is such a \"stand up\" guy. When Lindsay won't give up her questioning, Layla accuses her of sounding just like her sister. R.J. and Vince interrupt their conversation when they return with drinks. R.J. gets a phone call from Nora asking him to pick her up since she is being discharged. Lindsay offers to find another way home since she doesn't think that Nora would be too happy to see her. Layla leaves with R.J. so that she can visit Evangeline leaving Lindsay and Vincent alone at the table. Lindsay takes her leave when Vincent lays it on too thick while trying to make small talk with her. \n\n\nAfter Lindsay takes her leave, Vince has his manservant place a bet against Cris for the upcoming match knowing that Cris' hand is in bad shape. Vince declares that he is in it to win it and even though Cris is his fighter, the bottom line for him is profit not loyalty.\n\n\nJohn starts twitching when he spies David, Spencer, and Blair together at Capricorn.  Natalie reminds John that like it or not David is on their side and will report anything that Spencer reveals to him. John tries to leave it alone but can't take it anymore and goes up to Spencer who begins to inquire as to how they found out that David didn't shoot Thomas McBain. Natalie goes into the ballistics details of how the gun was filled with blanks (David once again uses his joke of shooting blanks just like Kevin Buchanan) and that the bullet that was in McBain did not match David's gun. When Spencer assumes correctly that they new person of interest is none other than himself, he goes down a list of real and supposed misdeeds that he has committed. John informs him that it doesn't matter what he gets charged with as long as he ends up in jail. Spencer tells John that he is not smart enough to beat Spencer but John tells him that he's on to him and that it's just a matter of time before he slips up and John will be right there. \n\n\nBlair steps in to defend Spencer and tells John that all the accusations against Spencer are due to Todd and his baseless accusations. While Blair is letting John have it, David tells Spencer to meet him on the docks. Spencer begrudgingly agrees to David's request and when he meets with David, David informs him that he will get his revenge for all the lies and the blackmail that David endured while believing that he killed Thomas McBain.\n\n\n",
