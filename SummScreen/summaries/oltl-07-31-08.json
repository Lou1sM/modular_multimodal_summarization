The crowd cheered as Carlo went on to announce that Talia Hesser would be the country's new queen. Tina pleaded with Cain to find a way to save them. Cain decided to appeal to the people of Mendorra by exposing Carlo's crimes. The angry citizens refused to believe the imposter. Carlo seized the opportunity to point out that Tina and Cain were traitors to the country. The punishment for treason, Carlo reminded all, was death. The people, once again, broke out in cheers. \n\n\nDeep in the bowels of the castle, the robed figure who came to Antonio's aid was revealed to be Cris. He helped his brother, but Antonio was more concerned about Talia's fate. He asked Cris to stop the wedding. Cris ignored the request and tried to figure out a way to free his brother from prison. They came up with a plan for Cris to pretend to be a friar who had the task of burying Antonio. The guards nixed the escape when they announced that Antonio was to be cremated that very night. Afterwards, his ashes were to be brought to the royal suite. Cris stuck to his role of a friar, which kept the element of surprise on his side. When the moment was right, he and Antonio managed to overpower the guards and disarm them. \n\n\nTalia's marriage to Jonas went off with a hitch. When asked if she would take Jonas as her husband, Talia answered, \"Hell no!\" Her rebellion was short-lived. Carlo pulled Talia aside and warned her that if she did not continue with the wedding, Tina and Cain would end up on the chopping block. Talia returned to Jonas' side and the ceremony continued. After they were pronounced man and wife, Carlos triumphantly introduced Mendorra to its new royal family. Nearby, a hooded executioner tested the sharpness of a heavy-bladed axe. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian nearly hit the roof when she and Addie walked into the living room and found David, wearing a black tux. While a violinist played a romantic ballad, David went down on bended knee and proposed to Addie. Nearby stood a preacher ready to perform the wedding if Addie accepted. To David's surprise, Addie turned him down. David was baffled, given that Addie had been upset when she had learned that their marriage had been annulled. Addie explained that the proposal wasn't made out of love. Besides, Addie intended to dump David. David didn't believe her, so Addie went to get her list of things to do. Among the things listed was 'divorce David' followed by 'go on a nudist cruise around the world.' David was upset that Addie wanted to divorce him before she went on the cruise. He said that he would have enjoyed cruising with nudists. Addie was sympathetic but told David that her list also included love. Addie reminded David that they did not love each other and said that her decision was made. Dorian was delighted and tossed David out. David refused to leave. Addie left the two to bicker it out. \n\n\nIn the foyer of La Boulaie, Starr happened to catch Blair coming home from John's. Starr knew instantly that her mother had spent the night somewhere else and commented on it. She suggested that the next time Blair spent the night out, Blair use the back door, rather than the front, to sneak in. Starr went on to say that she hoped Blair had used protection. Blair didn't appreciate the comment and reached out to stop Starr from walking away. Starr backed down and started talking about the baby. Starr wondered if she had made the right decision to give her baby up for adoption. She asked Blair for her opinion on the matter but Blair declined to answer. Blair didn't want her opinion to influence Starr's decision. Things took a surprising turn when Blair started singing a special song to the baby and Starr joined in. Both felt the baby kick for the first time. The sweet moment was ruined when David and Dorian walked out of the living room, still bickering. Addie soon walked up with the pooch, David Vickers, in her arms. She handed the little dog to David and told him that Madame Delphina had insisted that the dog belonged with David. \n\n\nNora and Clint were enjoying a late lunch at the Buchanan Mansion. Nora sensed that Clint was eager to learn how things were fairing with David and Addie. Clint tried to deny it but Nora didn't believe him. When the doorbell rang, Clint jumped up to answer it. Clint passed Cole, who had walked into the room to talk to Nora. When Cole asked Nora about his chances of keeping his child, Nora couldn't hold back. She ordered Cole to stop indulging in self-pity and look around. Nora went on to tell Cole that it was killing her to watch him try to create a family with the baby while losing Starr in the process. Nora told Cole that if he opened his eyes, he would see that he already had people like Nora, Clint, Renee and Matthew, who were eager to be a part of Cole's family. \n\n\nClint was surprised to open the front door and find his ex-lover from London, Dallas, on the doorstep. He invited her in and ushered Dallas into the living room. The two began chatting and catching up. Dallas found it interesting that Clint was dating his brother's ex-wife, Nora. Clint brushed it off and invited Dallas into the kitchen for something to eat. Later, they returned to the living room just as Nora walked in from another entrance. Clint introduced Dallas to Nora. Dallas made a point of letting Nora know that she and Clint had once been more than mere friends. \n\n\nLater, Cole showed up on Starr's doorstep just as Addie ushered out David Vickers. While Addie and David shared a sweet kiss goodbye, Blair shooed Dorian into another room so that Cole and Starr could talk. Cole handed Starr signed papers, renouncing his rights to the baby. Starr was happy until Cole told her that along with giving up his baby, he was giving up Starr. \n\n\nIn another room, Addie joined Blair and Dorian. Each admitted that they had hoped Starr would keep the baby. \n\n\nBack in 1968, at the diner in Paris, Texas, Bo encountered an angry redhead who turned out to be Renee Divine. She was irate over Asa's treatment of one of her girls, Emma. Renee wanted to know Asa's intentions toward Emma. When Bo said next to nothing, Renee warned Bo that she wouldn't be able to stop Emma from doing what Emma was prepared to do in order to keep Asa. Renee ordered Asa to do right by Emma just as Emma walked into the diner. \n\n\nViki told Charlie about her decision to be an ambassador, of sorts, to promote heart health in Africa. Charlie tried his best to be supportive. When Viki revealed that Jessica had pushed her to accept the offer because Jessica needed some space, Charlie suggested that it might not be a bad idea for Viki either. The last time Viki went off, she had landed in Paris, which had been exactly what Viki had needed at the time. Viki wasn't certain that she really needed distance from Llanview. Charlie assured Viki that if she were worried that distance would cause her to lose something in Llanview, she needn't be. Charlie let her know that he would be waiting for her when Viki returned from her trip. Viki seemed to take comfort in that knowledge. Before Viki walked away, Charlie gave Viki his 30-day chip for sobriety. He asked her to hold onto it until she came back and he could give her a 60-day chip. Viki accepted the gift.\n\n\n",
