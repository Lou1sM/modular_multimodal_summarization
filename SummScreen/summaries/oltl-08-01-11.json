    "soap_central": "\n\nAfter the debacle of the Vicker Man preview at the Palace, Rex hid behind a curtain and pointed his gun at various members of the Manning family. The family had gathered to hear Tomas' revelation. \"This man is not Todd Manning,\" Tomas simply stated as he pointed at Todd. \"I am,\" the man with the scar announced as he stepped into view.\n\n\nAghast, Blair, T\u00e9a, and Starr looked at the man. \"Oh, my God,\" Starr gasped. The man repeated, \"I'm Todd Manning. And I'm home.\" Starr walked over to the man and reached up to touch his cheek. She pulled her hand away quickly, as if the man's cheek were too hot to touch. \"Dad,\" Starr whispered. \"Hi,\" the man replied gently. Starr recounted how Sam had claimed to have a friend with a line on his face. \"Oh, my God, you're real,\" Starr said anxiously.\n\n\n\"I'm real. And you're not,\" the man said to Todd. \"And I need you to stay the hell away from my family,\" the man concluded. Todd appeared to be amused. \"Where have you been?\" Blair asked the man. He explained that he'd been locked up for eight years, and he had no knowledge of the where or why. The man advised Blair that she'd kept him alive. It was the thought of being with his family again that had helped him.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Rex received a goodnight text message from Shane. Rex had second thoughts about shooting someone, and he departed the hotel.\n\n\nThe man with the scar explained that he had tried to get back for all of those years. He had wanted to be with the love of his life, but someone else had taken his place. \"This guy's out of his mind,\" Todd grumbled. The man was certain that Blair knew in her heart who the man was. Blair had believed that the man had been dead. Todd continued to insist that the man was \"nuts,\" and the man had kidnapped Sam.\n\n\nThe man maintained that he'd only been trying to get Todd's attention. He'd wanted to understand why Todd had taken everything from him. Todd pointed out that the man had attacked Jack. Blair lost her temper. \"Todd would never strike his own children,\" she shouted. She wouldn't give the man a chance to explain. Todd smirked as he took in the scene. The man tried to say that it had been a mistake, but Blair wanted no part of what he had to say.\n\n\nFinally, the man managed to point out that Jack had changed since the last time he'd seen his son. He hadn't recognized him. T\u00e9a had remained quiet, but she suddenly recalled that Tomas had just finished telling everyone that Todd wasn't Todd. She reminded everyone that Todd had asked Tomas not to say anything. \"Look at my face,\" the man said. He mentioned the island that he'd been stranded on with Ross Rayburn and T\u00e9a. The man had been married to T\u00e9a twice.\n\n\nAt the Manning residence, Nate tried to explain his reason for performing in the porn film, but Dani didn't want to hear it. She was disgusted and upset. Nate managed to get across that he'd been forced to do it, but Dani didn't buy it. She realized that Rick must have known something about Nate, and she demanded that Nate tell her what it was. Nate refused at first, but then awkwardly revealed that Rick had been aware that Nate had done something bad.\n\n\nNate confirmed that he'd done something to Matthew, because Matthew had idly stood by as both Nate and Inez had taken the blame for killing Eddie. One of them could have ended up in prison because of Matthew. Nate explained how he'd visited Matthew and had punched him because of Matthew's behavior after Matthew had been the one to kill Eddie all along. Nate hadn't meant to hurt Matthew, but Matthew had hit his head when he'd fallen.\n\n\nThe teens had even engaged in a conversation after the punch and fall, Nate justified. As far as Nate knew, Matthew had been fine when Nate had left the Buchanan residence. Nate had only realized that he might have been to blame for Matthew's injury after Matthew had been hospitalized. Dani was incredulous. She was astonished to hear that Nate might have been the person responsible for Matthew's hospitalization, but she was able to finally understand why Nate had been so concerned about Matthew's condition when he hated Matthew.\n\n\nNate admitted that he had felt terrible, but Dani accused him of not telling anyone about it. Nate clarified that Deanna had known, and Deanna had convinced Nate that he wasn't to blame. Sarcastically, Dani stated that of course Nate had told Deanna, because he didn't have a girlfriend, mother, or brothers to tell.\n\n\nNate maintained that he had thought Matthew would tell everyone what had happened, but then the teen had taken a turn for the worse. Rick had overheard Nate and Deanna talking in the caf\u00e9, and he'd blackmailed them. Nate hadn't wanted to go to jail. Dani finally comprehended why Deanna had always been around. She pointed out that Matthew might never awaken enough to tell anyone what had happened.\n\n\nNate assured Dani that he would never expect her to keep his secret, and she was free to do what she needed to do. He wondered if she would talk to Bo and Nora. Dani was distressed and crying. She had no idea what she'd do with the information, but she knew that she couldn't look at Nate any longer. Matthew was one of her best friends. Nate declared that Deanna and the movie meant nothing to him. He just hadn't wanted to go to jail. Dani was the one who meant everything to him, and he loved her. Dani ordered him out of the house.\n\n\nBo and Nora arrived home. Bo received a text message from David that stated how happy he'd been that Bo hadn't been around to see the fiasco that the movie premiere had turned out to be. Nora thought it possible that David might be exaggerating. The couple was interrupted when there was a knock at their front door. It was Destiny. \"I had to see you,\" the teenager confessed.\n\n\nDestiny apologized for her visit, but Nora advised the girl that she'd been aware that Destiny had something on her mind. Destiny stated that she'd been thinking about Matthew, and she wanted to find out how her friend was doing. Nora suggested that there had been something else that Destiny had wanted to talk about, but the teen maintained that she only wanted an update on Matthew's condition. Bo and Nora eagerly filled her in.\n\n\nDestiny wondered if the couple had any further information on the possible suspect who'd landed Matthew in the hospital. Bo showed Destiny the bagged gum wrapper again. Destiny thought the wrapper was a \"weird\" brand. Bo believed that someone had been in the apartment and had fought with Matthew. Destiny swore that she didn't know anything, and she asked the Buchanans to tell Matthew she'd been waiting for him.\n\n\nBo appreciated the fact that Destiny and Matthew were such good friends. Nora wondered if the young couple was more than friends, but Destiny hurried out. Bo wondered if what Nora had said were true. Nora indicated that had been her impression. Bo was adamant that there was someone who knew the truth about Matthew's injury.\n\n\nDestiny made a frantic call to Dani, but she was unable to reach her friend on the phone.\n\n\nShaun and Vivian shared a meal at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, and Shaun informed his girlfriend that he could tell that something was bothering her. \"Destiny,\" Vivian stated simply. Shaun pressed Vivian for more details. The doctor declared that she was certain that Destiny had to talk to someone. \"Shaun, I think Destiny's pregnant,\" Vivian finally managed to voice.\n\n\nShaun wanted to laugh. He couldn't believe that Destiny of all people would be pregnant. \"That's ridiculous,\" he exclaimed. Destiny had always told him everything, and besides, the only thing Destiny did was hang out with Dani and Matthew. She'd given Darren the boot quite a while before. Shaun looked at Vivian's face. \"Wait. Are you telling me Matthew Buchanan and Destiny?\" he asked.\n\n\nVivian nodded her head. \"Yes,\" she said. Shaun was livid, but Vivian assured him that she wasn't certain. She only knew that Destiny had displayed many of the signs, and the girl appeared to be unwilling to deal with it. If Matthew were the father, Destiny had been pregnant for some time. She advised Shaun to calm down before he broached Destiny on the subject. Vivian informed him that she wanted to be present during the conversation, and Shaun readily agreed.\n\n\nDestiny ran into Nate outside of the caf\u00e9. She saw his unusual gum wrapper.\n\n\nJohn nodded to the police officer to remove Agent Baker's gag, as Baker sat tied to a chair in John's apartment. John inquired about the other man who had been there prior to Baker's arrival. John asked where the man had gone. Baker insisted that the man was his prisoner. John went through Baker's wallet, but Baker ordered John to \"stay out of it.\" He thought that John was in over his head, and he noted that there were many powerful people involved. \"Forget about the two Todd Mannings,\" Baker advised.\n\n\nJohn wanted Baker taken to the police station. Baker informed John that John would regret it, but John was willing to take his chances. Baker suggested that the man was probably out shooting people, because the man had taken a gun.\n\n\nRex returned home, shaken. He couldn't believe he had been about to shoot someone. He grabbed a framed photo of Gigi and spoke to her. He was shocked that he'd turned into Clint and had almost killed one of the Mannings. Rex had only wanted to have some power, and he wanted the pain to go away, he said to the photo. He had the house and money in exchange for Gigi's heart, but he still didn't have justice. No one had paid for Gigi's death.\n\n\nRex was upset. He still had a need for Gigi, and he really didn't want to kill anyone. \"I just want you back. Please come back,\" Rex cried. He looked across the room and saw Gigi, bathed in a white glowing light. He called out to her as he ran in her direction, but she disappeared. Rex ran around the house, trying to find her again. He was unsuccessful. He was certain he'd seen her, and he wondered where she had gone.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the Palace and walked into the Manning family meeting. He asked the man to leave with him, reminding the man that he'd been ordered to remain at Todd's place. The man refused to go. He'd been separated from his family long enough. Suddenly, he pulled out the gun and pointed it at Todd. \"That man is not going to live one more moment of my life,\" the man announced.\n\n\n\"Don't do this,\" John begged the man. The man replied that the one who everyone knew as Todd had taken everything. Todd replied that the man was crazy. John tried to calm the man down, and John ignored Todd. John spoke calmly and quietly to the man, and urged him to not take drastic measures, so that he would be able to get his family back. That wouldn't happen if he shot people, John pointed out.\n\n\nJohn stated that they needed to get to the truth, and he didn't want the man to lose everything all over again. John grasped the offered gun from the man and announced that Baker was in custody. Todd pointedly asked whether John and the man were best friends. Todd thought it was all very touching, but he wanted John to arrest the man. Todd rattled off the charges.\n\n\nJohn wanted to take the man into confinement, but the man asked about Todd's arrest. Todd had stolen the man's entire life. John assured the man that he knew where to find Todd. An indignant Todd ordered his family to follow him out. T\u00e9a stared at the man with Todd's original face. \"T\u00e9a!\" Todd shouted, and insisted, \"Our daughter needs us.\" T\u00e9a stood still. \"This daughter of yours. Dani. Danielle,\" the man said to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nTodd shouted about the porn film that Dani's sleazy boyfriend had made, and as T\u00e9a ignored him, Todd headed for Starr and Jack. \"I'm your father,\" Todd stated, and he deemed the man a \"fruitcake.\" He reminded Starr that she hadn't doubted his identity when he'd first returned to them. \"You didn't doubt me then. You don't doubt me now,\" Todd advised her. Todd turned to go. T\u00e9a finally broke her stare at the man and followed Todd out.\n\n\nThe man wandered over to Starr, who appeared to be on the verge of an anxiety attack. \"Whatever he told you to get you to believe he was me, he was lying,\" the man stated. \"But you already know that,\" he added. He called Starr by her nickname, Shorty, and he thought that Jack would believe him soon enough.\n\n\nNext, the man walked over to Blair. \"You know me,\" he said. \"I don't know,\" she replied. He was upset and held up their wedding photo. He knew that she remembered that day. He admitted to having stalked her \"a little,\" and he'd overheard a conversation that Blair had had with Starr at La Boulaie. Blair had stated that she'd never been so happy. He leaned over, grabbed her, and began to kiss her.\n\n\nThe man pulled away. \"I dare you to ever forget me. I dare you,\" the man said. He pointed to the people in the photo. \"That's you, and that's me. The man who made you so happy,\" he said. John led him away. Blair grabbed Starr and Jack, and the women cried.\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a returned home, and T\u00e9a headed for the stairs to check on Dani. Todd stopped her. He touched her back gently. He couldn't believe that T\u00e9a thought that the imposter was actually Todd. T\u00e9a remained silent. Todd had no idea of who the man was or what he was doing. \"I'm Todd Manning,\"  he said. He was T\u00e9a's husband and Dani's father, and he had always loved T\u00e9a. His wife began to cry and continued up the stairs. Todd was angry with her response.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Original Todd makes himself known to all the people Todd knows. It seems only Tomas knows his \"secret\". Current Todd scoffs and tells him everybody knows he's a fake and only he (himself) is Todd Manning. Yet it seems Blair, Tea, and Starr wonder if that's true when they see the \"old Todd\" played by Roger Howarth until 2003 remembering exactly what he looked like then. Nate urges Dani to listen to him and realize that he and Deanna had no choice except to do what Rick wanted, because Rick knew that he assaulted Matthew and threatened to tell Bo and Nora and have Nate sent to prison. Finding out for the first time that Nate is the reason why Matthew is in the hospital, Dani asks Nate why he could not trust her knowing this. Meanwhile Destiny is hiding that she is pregnant by Matthew. She goes to talk to Bo and Nora and is able to put two and two together when Nora tells her she knows somebody assaulted her son. Knowing it must be Nate, Destiny does not reveal this to Bo and Nora, much less that she is pregnant. But Shaun and Vivian know that she is and wonder what to do.",
