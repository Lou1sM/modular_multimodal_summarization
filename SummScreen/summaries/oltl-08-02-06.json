Bo told her about the matching gun and said he bets Spencer has it hidden somewhere. Blair lamented giving up on Todd when he needed her most and said she'd redeem herself my nailing Spencer and finding the gun. Starr called Blair and scolded her for not being around. Blair told her she's just going to have to accept that there are things she can't share and Starr hung up. Todd walked up to Blair and asked why she was talking to Bo at some out-of-the-way bar. Blair pretended like it was a coincidence that they were both there at the same time and left in a huff. \n\n\nA short-haired, clean-cut Cristian talked with Todd at the hospital and told him to stay out of his and Evangeline's lives. Todd said he doesn't care what Cristian thinks and left to visit Vangie. Cristian lamented to Layla and Vincent how Todd's money earned him privileges. Vincent reminded Cristian that he can make himself some money in his title fight. Vincent and Layla left and made out a bit at the docks. \n\n\nEvangeline was upset that the surgery seemingly did not restore her sight. Todd told Evangeline not to give up hope. Evangeline said that she has come to accept that her blindness is her new reality. Todd got a call and said he had to go. Cristian went in next. He told Evangeline he's going to get her another doctor. \"You're as bad as Todd,\" Vangie sighed, saying she's perfectly capable of getting her own doctor. When Evangeline told him that her situation is hopeless, Cristian said not to give up. \"I think you're afraid to get your hopes up because you're afraid to lose,\" he told her. The eye surgeon came in to test Evangeline's sight, but she still couldn't see anything. The doctor said there is still too much swelling to say conclusively whether the surgery was a success. He said he'd be back the next day. Cristian sat with Evangeline as she napped. When she woke up, she said she could see.\n\n\nAdriana spied Rex meeting with a hooded guy on the beach. When Rex walked back toward her she tried to run and asked, \"What are you doing talking to my stalker?\" Rex said he understands, given that the guy was wearing a hood like her stalker was, but he insisted that he was just a homeless guy begging for money. Adriana asked him why he was out there at night, and Rex said the homeless dude was lurking around outside the beach house so he went out, gave him money and told him to beat it. Later, they were in the sack together and Adriana apologized to Rex for accusing him. Rex told her he loves her more than he ever loved anyone and that he would never hurt her. Adriana must not have believed it, though, because after Rex fell asleep, she snooped in his laptop.\n\n\nNatalie confronted Nash and Claudia and warned them to stay away from Jessica (and also from John) because they are threatening her recovery. John walked up as Natalie was unleashing on Claudia and Nash to tell her to cool down. \n\n\nDavid told John he understands if he can't every really forgive him because even though he didn't actually kill his father, he did fire his weapon that night. John told David that he doesn't owe him an explanation. David said he wishes he'd have come forward sooner.\n\n\nMatthew asked Nora why she fired Mrs. Alvarez, her nurse. Nora said she can walk on her own now and doesn't need a nurse. \"The more I have to do for myself, the more I'll be able to do for myself,\" she assured him. Matthew was still upset, though, and walked out. Later, Paige came by and told Nora that Matthew called her to be her new nurse. Nora told Paige to forget it, but Paige said that Matthew really wanted her help. Matthew came back in and asked Nora if she'd let Paige help, and Nora relented. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Adriana catches Rex red-handed. She sees him talking to the stalker on the beach. She stoops in the bushes. Rex and the man part now, their talking finished, and on the way back to the house, Rex sees Adriana. She starts running but he catches her and she shouts that she saw him. He wants to explain but she doesn't want to hear it and she struggles to get away. \"Not! So! Fast!\" He tells that the guy that she saw dresses like the stalker but that this guy is just a bum that Rex gave change to the day that he got the pizza, and now the guy is after him for change all the time. He says he was only telling the guy to stay away from them and find another beach. Adriana is sorry that she was suspicious now and she kisses him. They fall into bed and make love. Bo tells Blair about the other matching gun. Spencer has to have it somewhere. He would treasure it as it is a gun that his father gave him. Blair vows to find the gun no matter what. Todd visits Evangeline and ignores her pleas to stop calling doctors to heal her. Cristian hates that Todd's money makes him able to control everything. Vincent tells Cristian that he too could end up with big money some day soon. The doctor comes to check Evangeline out again. She gets angry that he is trying to see if anything has changed. She has some swelling still and that is why he keeps checking. Natalie finds Claudia and Nash at a table and goes over there to give them a piece of her mind. She tells Nash off for kidnapping her sister and niece and she orders him to keep Claudia the psycho away from John. Claudia whispers loudly to Nash that Nat has insecurities. John hears shouting and comes over. Nat leaves. Claudia wants to infer that Natalie is still upset about the kiss that she and John shared. Adriana and Rex are in bed. He is asleep. She gets up and dresses. She gets the laptop and opens it. \"I do trust you,\" she whispers as she logs on. Cristian and Evangeline are alone in her hospital room. She suddenly turns and looks Cristian in the face. \"I can see you.\"",
