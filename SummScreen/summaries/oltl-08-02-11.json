They asked about David's movie premiere, and Dorian promptly held up the latest edition of the Sun for them to see. The front-page headline read \"EXPOSED\" and featured a still photo of Nate Salinger from the porn film. Joey and Kelly heard about the fiasco of the movie premiere, and they also learned that Echo had been released from jail.\n\n\nDorian claimed that she was taking the \"high road\" with Echo, and she'd been more focused on the film anyway. David was excited for Kelly and Joey to view his film, but the couple indicated that they were in a hurry to get to Clint's arraignment. David was disappointed, and he thought that maybe he and Dorian could visit with Bo and Nora and show them the film instead. Dorian thought it would be a good idea for David to spend quality time with his family alone.\n\n\nDestiny paid a visit to Dani and showed her the cover of the Sun. Dani admitted that she felt like she didn't know Nate at all. Destiny revealed that there was more to tell, and she related the latest news in the search for Matthew's attacker. Destiny told Dani about the gum wrapper that had been found at the Buchanan residence and the assumption that it had belonged to whoever had fought with Matthew.\n\n\nDestiny explained that the wrapper wasn't from a common brand of gum, and she had seen Nate with the same type of gum when she'd run into him at the caf\u00e9. Nate had known that Matthew had killed Eddie. Dani disclosed that Nate had explained his reasons for doing the porn film. Destiny thought that Dani had an obligation to go to Matthew's parents to tell them the truth.\n\n\nDani wasn't certain what her move should be, but she reminded Destiny that Destiny had asked Dani to keep quiet about Matthew's killing Eddie, and Dani had listened to her friend. Dani was more upset about how she'd seen Nate and Deanna having sex in the film, and Dani couldn't get over it. The problem was that Dani still loved Nate, and she wasn't sure if Nate should go to prison for his act.\n\n\nDani wanted time to think about things. Suddenly, Destiny began to cry. \"I'm pregnant,\" Destiny told her friend. She informed Dani that no one else knew. Dani advised her friend that she had to go to a doctor, possibly even Vivian. Destiny was certain that she didn't want to see Vivian, because the woman would tell Shaun.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Ford showed Nate the latest edition of the Sun. Ford was angry at his brother for making the porn film, and Nate tried to explain that he'd been blackmailed into doing it. Nate had punched Matthew, because Nate had wanted Matthew to pay. \"He killed our dad,\" Nate informed his brother. Matthew had been okay when Nate had left him, but Rick had eventually learned what Nate had done. Nate had been forced to do the film to stay out of jail.\n\n\nFord admitted that he probably would have hit Matthew, too, but he wondered why Nate hadn't told Matthew's parents the truth. Nate explained that Deanna had told him it wouldn't help anyone if Nate had gone to jail, but he was aware that the Buchanans were on the warpath. They were searching for the person who had hurt their son.\n\n\nFord still couldn't believe that Nate had consented to making the movie, and he asked whether there might be anyone else who was aware of the truth. Nate confessed that he'd told Dani what he had done to Matthew, and he wasn't aware of what Dani might do with the secret. Ford wanted to understand why Nate hadn't told his brother about it, but Nate maintained that Ford had been involved in his own problems.\n\n\nFord thought that maybe Nate should speak to Bo and Nora and explain that it had all been an accident. Nate unwrapped a piece of gum and tucked the package into his pocket. Nate pointed out that it had been a long time since the incident, and he had kept quiet for too long. Ford thought that Nate would have to find out what Dani planned to do.\n\n\nDavid ran into the caf\u00e9 and saw Nate. He thanked the teen for ruining his movie premiere and told him that he was a horrible actor. David asked Nate for a piece of gum, and Nate handed him the package. He told David to keep all of it.\n\n\nShaun and Vivian sat in a booth at the caf\u00e9, and a disappointed Shaun revealed that he hadn't seen Destiny since his last talk with Vivian. He couldn't believe that Destiny was afraid to talk to him. Vivian advised Shaun to tell Destiny he loved her, but she wondered what kind of advice he'd give the teenager. Shaun was at a loss. He painted a picture of Destiny with her teddy bear, and how she was still a child.\n\n\nShaun just couldn't understand the idea of Destiny being pregnant, and he admitted that if Matthew were around, he would have been at the teenager's door. Vivian explained that even with birth control, accidents happened. Shaun was adamant that no male should have been anywhere close to Destiny until she turned 30. Vivian stressed the fact that Destiny needed to feel safe. Looking at how pregnant Destiny probably was given Matthew's circumstances, a decision would have to be made soon.\n\n\nShaun reiterated that he was unaware of what was best for Destiny, but Vivian reminded him that it was Destiny's choice. Vivian would talk to the girl too. Shaun announced that he was lucky to have Vivian, and she told him that she loved both him and Destiny.\n\n\nBo and Nora discussed the fact that it was the day for Clint's arraignment. Bo wondered if Nora had to go through with the court date, and Nora assured Bo that it was her job to prosecute Clint, especially because Clint had confessed to his crimes. It would look suspicious if she didn't go through with it, Nora explained. Bo reminded her that they were aware that Clint hadn't been the one to murder Eddie. Clint's confession had only been okay when they had thought he would die from his heart problems.\n\n\nBoth Nora and Bo agreed that they'd had difficulty sleeping, and they didn't know what they should do as far as Clint was concerned. Nora could only recognize that Matthew had been fighting to get back to his old self, and she couldn't see him going to prison once he returned. She was unable to even think about it. Bo pointed out that someone knew the truth about Matthew, and that person could expose them at any time. Nora understood that it was the person who had hurt Matthew.\n\n\nNora had to leave for court; she had no choice. Clint had confessed to the crimes. Bo made a phone call to the rehabilitation hospital and learned that Matthew's condition hadn't improved. Bo was surprised when David turned up and announced that he had the movie premiere for Bo to view.\n\n\nBo insisted that it wasn't a good time, but David explained that a private family premiere would be better than the public one he'd scheduled. He'd also bought Bo a breakfast burrito, and it would mean a lot to him if Bo would watch. Bo stated that he was honored, and he agreed. David asked for Nora, but Bo revealed that she was in court for Clint's arraignment. David declared that Clint belonged in prison.\n\n\nBo wasn't hungry, but David offered his father some gum. Bo stared at the package and asked where David had obtained the gum. David told Bo that Nate had given it to him.\n\n\nViki wheeled Clint into the courtroom before the start of his arraignment. Clint acknowledged that he hadn't wanted his daughters to be there, but he knew that all of his children would be okay. All except for Rex, he added. He was concerned about Rex, especially the way the young man had been conducting business. Viki pointed out that Rex had been grieving, but Clint felt that Rex had shown that there was ice water in his veins.\n\n\nClint added that Rex was still greedy and manipulative, and he was headed down a \"dark path.\" Clint, of all people, understood Rex's desire for revenge, but he was worried about Shane. The boy needed a father. Viki asked if Shane was the one who Clint was really worried about. \"Of course it is,\" Clint said firmly.\n\n\nViki wanted to concentrate on Clint, and she reminded him that he was being charged for a crime that he hadn't committed. Clint agreed that he had thought he was dying when he'd confessed to killing Eddie to protect Matthew, but another 20 years added on to his possible 90-year sentence didn't matter to him. \"It matters to me,\" Viki stated. She couldn't believe that Clint's first stop after heart surgery had been a courtroom.\n\n\nJust then, Clint's attorney arrived, and Clint introduced Mr. Higgins to Viki. Clint was aware that he had to plead guilty because he'd confessed to all of the crimes. Higgins implied that he could make charges disappear if Clint desired. Viki read a document that stated that Clint hadn't been in his right mind when he'd confessed, due to the medication and circumstances of his heart problems. Viki wondered if that were true.\n\n\nClint pointed out that Viki should be familiar with the situation, and she agreed it was all possible. Joey and Kelly arrived, and Clint voiced his happiness at the couple being together. They belonged together, he added. Nora walked into the courtroom, and Viki approached her. Viki managed to state that she was aware that Clint had been awful, but she was cut short when the court was called to order. The judge had taken his seat.\n\n\nThe judge began to read the list of charges against Clint. There were multiple counts of criminal conspiracy. The list was extensive and included the charges of DNA tampering, kidnapping, and murder in the second degree. Higgins announced that Clint wanted to make a statement.\n\n\nClint picked up the paper that contained his already prepared speech, but he crumbled it up instead. \"Your Honor, I have nothing to say,\" Clint said. \"On all charges, I plead...\" Nora jumped up. \"I have something to say,\" she announced. Nora wanted to remove the charge of Eddie Ford's murder. The judge asked why.\n\n\nEcho arrived at Rex's place. \"Free at last,\" she shouted. She thanked Rex for making it possible for her to be released from jail. Rex advised her that Shane had been visiting a friend overnight, but Rex hadn't been alone. \"Gigi was here,\" Rex revealed. Echo looked at her son skeptically, and Rex conceded that he was aware that Gigi was dead. He'd seen her outside, and he'd run out to look for her, but she'd disappeared.\n\n\n\"You think I'm crazy,\" Rex said to his mother. Echo shook her head. She was sure that Rex saw Gigi everywhere, much like Echo saw Charlie. She thought that Rex had probably heard an animal outside though. Rex agreed that Echo was probably right. \"I saw what I wanted to see. It couldn't have been Gigi,\" Rex admitted.\n\n\nEcho wanted to celebrate her release, and she offered to figure out how to make a peanut butter smoothie like Gigi had. Rex advised Echo that she didn't owe him anything. Echo was sorry for putting Rex into an awkward position in the first place when she'd kidnapped Dorian, and she promised she would never do it again. Rex understood how Echo had felt. \"I'd go another way,\" he said mysteriously. He chuckled eerily.\n\n\nEcho thought she'd been desperate, but Rex divulged that he'd been worse. \"I almost committed murder last night,\" he told her. Rex ran to the safe and showed Echo the gun that he'd taken to the movie premiere at the Palace. He had been watching on television, and he saw that Todd had been with his family. When Blanca Morales had questioned Todd about Jack's involvement in Gigi's murder, Todd had merely shrugged the question off. Rex had taken off for the Palace.\n\n\nRex had aimed the gun at various members of the Manning family, but then he'd received a text message from Shane. His son had wished him goodnight, and he'd told Rex he missed him. At that point, Rex had only been able to think about Shane, and he pictured what Gigi would have said if Rex had killed someone. \"Balsom, what were you thinking?\" Rex imitated Gigi. Echo assured Rex that he'd done the right thing. Rex was inconsolable. He couldn't go on without Gigi, and he didn't know what to do about it.\n\n\nRex admitted that he slept little, and he didn't want to hear Echo's words of encouragement. He didn't want to hear that he'd have someone else someday. Echo assured him that one day he would sleep well after not thinking about Gigi all day. He still had his son, Echo reminded him. Gigi had thought that Rex was the greatest guy in the world, and she'd waited ten years for him. Echo suggested that he think about the future, but Rex insisted that he couldn't.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and Echo went to answer it. \"Fair warning, Echo. Freedom comes with a price,\" Dorian proclaimed. Echo reminded the mayor that the charges had all been dropped, but Dorian was the one who could go to prison for attempted murder after allowing Clint to suffer. Dorian promised that she wouldn't rest until Echo was gone. \"Bring it on,\" Echo replied as she closed the door.\n\n\nRex looked at a photo of Gigi. He said that it would be the two of them forever. Suddenly, Rex saw her reflection in the mirror as she stood behind him. \"Gigi,\" he called out as he turned and looked at her.\n\n\nDani and Destiny were interrupted when there was a knock at the front door. It was Nate, and Dani told him that she was busy. Destiny assured her that it was all right, and she really had to leave anyway. The girls hugged, and Destiny left. Dani advised Nate that every time she closed her eyes, she saw Deanna and Nate \"doing it.\" Nate wanted her forgiveness, but Dani wasn't sure she could give it.\n\n\nDani was certain that she wasn't going to tell anyone what she knew though. She didn't want Nate to go to prison.\n\n\nShaun tried to reach Destiny unsuccessfully via cell phone. He and Vivian were happy when Destiny walked into the caf\u00e9 and announced that she had to talk to them. Shaun replied that he'd been looking for her. Gently, Shaun pulled Destiny into the seat beside him as she told him she was pregnant. Shaun put his arm around her and drew her close.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Destiny finally admits to Dani that she is pregnant from the one time she had sex with Matthew and now that they both know that Nate put Matthew in the hospital, Destiny tells Dani she mustn't let him get away with it. Bo and Nora know that the person who came to their house and assaulted their son has a gum wrapper which they are keeping for evidence although they cannot figure out who it would be. Nate secretly tells his brother that it's only a matter of time before Bo and Nora find out that he put Matthew in the hospital so he has to leave town in order to avoid a prison charge and he informs Robert that Rick \"motivated\" him and Deanna to do the porn flick by threatening to tell Matthew's parents what he knows if they refuse to do it. David finds out that Nate chews the gum in question although he is unaware that Nate assaulted Matthew. Bo discovers David chewing Nate's gum, asks where he found it and David tells him it's from the kid who got The Vicker Man erased by doing the porn flick.",
