As he ran through the foyer, Echo entered. He ran right past her to the front of the house. When he returned, he explained to Echo how he'd seen Gigi, but she'd run away.\n\n\nRex insisted that he wasn't crazy, but Echo wondered why Gigi would run away if she and Rex loved each other. Rex didn't know the answer to Echo's question, but needed to find Gigi. He decided that Gigi must have run because she was in some kind of trouble. Echo asked if his explanations made sense to him, and suggested that he was hallucinating. She reminded him that he'd barely been sleeping.\n\n\nA short while later, Rex returned from looking around upstairs. Echo recommended that Rex get help. He related that police would probably scare Gigi more. Echo clarified that a psychiatrist had helped Shane, so maybe one would help Rex as well. Rex denied the proposal, and suggested that there had been a mistake with the transplant, so Gigi was really alive. Echo wondered if Rex wanted Shane to hear Rex talk like that. Rex wanted to find Gigi first before telling Shane anything.\n\n\nBo demanded to know where David had gotten the gum. David answered that Nate had given it to him. Bo explained his and Nora's investigation of what had happened to Matthew, and that Nate must have been the one to hurt Matthew. David wondered why Nate would have wanted to hurt Matthew, but Bo didn't know. He made David promise not to breathe a word to anyone. David agreed, and told his father that Nate had mentioned going to Dani's. Bo thanked David and left, and David was proud of himself for helping Bo.\n\n\nBlair looked at her and Todd's wedding picture, and remembered the kiss that the man had given her the night before. Dorian entered, excited that she'd gotten the master copy of Vicker Man back. Noticing that Blair wasn't listening, she wondered why Blair looked like she'd seen a ghost. Blair explained what had happened the night before with the two men who each claimed to be Todd Manning. Blair hadn't been able to decide which man was the real Todd. Dorian wondered what Blair's first reaction was. Blair related that the man sounded and acted like Todd, and Dorian added that he certainly looked like Todd.\n\n\nBlair wondered, if the new man was the real Todd, how she'd let in who she'd believed was Todd. She questioned if she'd wanted Todd back in her life so bad, that she'd just accepted the man with the new face. She related that her life was a sham, but Dorian didn't think it was, especially if the man with the new face was the real Todd. Blair admitted that the man with Todd's original face hadn't seemed like a fraud when he'd kissed her. Blair needed answers soon.\n\n\nDorian didn't know how she'd feel if there were suddenly two Davids. \"Christmas morning!\" David exclaimed as he entered. Dorian briefly explained the Todd situation to a confused David. Dorian wondered if Bo had liked Vicker Man, but David told her that Bo hadn't seen the movie yet. David wanted Blair to be the first to see the movie, but Blair declined the offer. David and Dorian went upstairs to watch the movie.\n\n\nBlair picked up her phone, and made a call to Tomas. She needed to see him. She wanted him to tell her everything he knew about the two Todds.\n\n\nNate appreciated Dani's promise not to tell his secret. Todd entered, and wondered what secret Dani had agreed to keep for Nate. Todd taunted Nate about Hold the Diploma, and told him to get out of his house for breaking Dani's heart. Todd wondered why Dani had agreed to keep a secret for Nate anyway. Dani related that Todd should understand, because he'd kept many secrets in his life.\n\n\nTodd told Dani that she didn't care about Nate. She didn't think that what Nate had done was as bad as anything Todd had ever done. Dani related that people thought she was crazy for still caring about Todd. He told her that he would always be her dad, and that she was too young to make her own decisions. Nate didn't want to cause any more problems, so he turned to leave. Todd followed him out, and told him to never return. He promised to hurt Nate if he ever tried to make contact with Dani again.\n\n\nAs Todd closed his front door, Bo arrived to see Nate. He handed Nate a piece of the gum David had given him, and asked if Nate liked it. He admitted that he did, and Bo marveled at how hard the rare gum was to find. Bo explained to Nate about the gum wrapper he and Nora found from the day Matthew had gotten hurt. He knew it was probably an accident, but he and Nora just wanted to know what had happened to Matthew. \"It was me,\" Nate finally admitted.\n\n\nNate swore that he hadn't meant to hurt Matthew, and would give anything to take back what he'd done. He explained how he'd hit Matthew, but Matthew had seemed fine. Bo wondered what had made Nate so angry at Matthew. Eventually, Nate told Bo that Matthew had killed Eddie, but had left Nate and Inez to take the rap for it. Nate knew that it wasn't an excuse, but he'd been scared. Nate wondered what would happen to him.\n\n\nThe judge wondered why Nora wanted to drop the murder charge against Clint. She revealed that Clint's confession was false. Bluffing, she continued that she and Bo had a hunch about who the real killer was, but the person was \"out of the jurisdiction.\" She wanted to proceed with caution, so she didn't want to reveal the name of the suspect.\n\n\nThe judge wondered why Clint had confessed if he was innocent. Clint explained that he'd caused a lot of hurt in the lives of Bo and Nora. Once he'd found out that he was dying, he'd wanted to confess to help Bo and Nora out, and make amends. He continued that, when he'd thought he was dying, he'd wanted to face up to all the wrongs he'd done to all of his loved ones. He related that one extra charge hadn't mattered to a dying man.\n\n\nThe judge wanted to know Clint's pleas for the rest of the charges against him. Clint replied that he pleaded guilty, as Viki shook her head behind him. The judge stated that Clint would remain in jail without bail until his sentencing. Joey stood, and argued that Clint wasn't yet well enough to be in jail. Viki stood, and told the judge that she'd survived the same surgery that Clint had had. She believed that it was too soon. The judge related that Clint's doctors had signed off on Clint's release, and that there was treatment in jail. He announced that the bailiff would take Clint immediately, and adjourned the hearing.\n\n\nJoey assured his father that they would file an appeal. Clint told Joey not to waste his time, and added that he'd see them at his sentencing. Joey and Kelly left as the bailiff arrived to wheel Clint away. He wanted a minute with Nora, so the bailiff gave them privacy. He told Nora that he would be in jail for a long time, so one extra charge wouldn't have made a difference. However, she hadn't thought it was fair to let Clint take the rap for the murder.\n\n\nA short while later, Clint was gone. Bo entered the courtroom, and asked what had happened. Nora admitted that she'd dropped the murder charge against Clint. The two agreed that it had been the right thing to do. However, she told him that Clint was going to jail for the rest of his crimes anyway. Bo confessed that he'd found out what had happened to Matthew.\n\n\nThe guard told the man with Todd's original face that he had a visitor. He was surprised when T\u00e9a appeared. However, he wondered when she was going to post bail for him, and get the charges against him dropped. She replied that she would do anything to save her husband, but \"who the hell are you?\" The man wondered why she was there, and suggested that she wasn't sure about her husband. She replied that the man had taken \"a chainsaw to my life. Why not?\"\n\n\nThe man wondered if there had been trouble at home. T\u00e9a answered that she would be fine once the man was taken care of. She wanted him to answer some questions, but he wanted answers to his questions first. He wondered how T\u00e9a had fallen for her husband's act. She replied that she'd loved her husband for years, and that she wouldn't let the man destroy her family. \"My family!\" he yelled. The man wanted to meet \"my daughter\" Dani, but T\u00e9a vowed to never let him near Dani.\n\n\n\"You know how I feel about my children,\" the man told T\u00e9a. He added that it hadn't been T\u00e9a's husband on that beach. She remembered being on the island with Todd. \"And it wasn't just that night,\" he added. She reminisced about making love to Todd in the ocean. The man continued that the only people who would remember what had happened on that island were him and her. T\u00e9a commended the man for doing his research. She turned to leave, but he offered to give her five million dollars to defend him.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was angry at the man for spitting out \"trivia\" from her own life. The man thought it was a good thing that there were no shovels around, and T\u00e9a remembered hitting Todd over the head with a shovel. He added that it hadn't been the worst thing one of them had ever done to the other, and she remembered Todd once demanding that she leave him. He apologized for the way he'd treated her. The man insisted that he was Todd, and held out his hands to her. However, a clearly upset T\u00e9a left.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a left, Viki entered with a guard. She instructed the guard about getting Clint's medication to him on time. As the guard went to help Clint settled in, Viki stood in front of the man's cell. She turned and looked into the cell. She was shocked to see whose face was staring back out at her.\n\n\nTodd wondered how he was the bad guy, when Nate had been the one to cheat on Dani. Dani told Todd that he had to let her go sometime, and that he couldn't keep her from getting hurt. Todd refused, and accepted being the bad guy if it kept her from getting hurt for one day. Dani admitted that she had cried and yelled, but she was dealing with things. She informed her father that she was tougher than she looked.\n\n\nDani insisted that she could handle things, and reminded Todd that she'd be on her own soon enough. Todd vowed that she would never be alone as long as he was alive. He told her to never forget that he was her father, and that he was always only one phone call away.\n\n\nT\u00e9a entered the house, trying to be as quiet as possible. T\u00e9a jumped when she turned to see Todd, who asked what was wrong with his scared-looking wife. He told her that he'd been trying to reach her all day. \"Are you an imposter?\" she asked.\n\n\n",

He points out that they didn't see the surgery to remove her heart, so it may not have happened. She suggests that he get therapy to deal with his grief. He tells her he doesn't need a psychiatrist; he just needs to find Gigi. Nora tells the court to drop the charges against Clint because he made a false confession.
