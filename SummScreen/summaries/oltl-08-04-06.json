Starr also reviewed what a \"loser\" her mother is for blowing off Todd and falling for Spencer. \"Maybe she's just head over heels in lust,\" Starr suggested. Langston asked if Starr had Ricky's email so she could stay in touch when he goes to Puerto Rico. Starr said she'd let her know if she hears from him. Langston went down and got a couple of kids to come up with her to where she and Starr were sitting. Two of the girls were daring a boy to jump into the water from up there, but he said he wouldn't because it was so high up. Starr said it was no big deal and leaped in. Langston looked down and realized that Starr wasn't coming up.\n\n\nBlair called the hospital to have Spencer paged into work. Later, Spencer put the moves on Blair. She cringed, but was rescued by the page before he could take things too far. Spencer got dressed and rushed to the hospital. Once alone, Blair searched Spencer's pad for the gun. She came across a photo of Spencer with some guy, and Spencer came home to see her snooping. \"What you got there?\" he asked.\n\n\nClint and Dorian basked in the afterglow in Dorian's bed. Dorian told Clint that she may have been a little hasty in her opinions on the Buchanans. When Clint despaired over Duke's death, Dorian blurted out that she thinks Kelly's pregnant with Duke's kid. Clint was dumbfounded. \"This is a pond with a lot of ripples,\" Clint said. He added that it would make Viki very happy, and Dorian got pissed. Clint kissed her and told her to relax, and then left. Dorian stood in her room grinning.\n\n\nKelly asked Hugh to come by LaBoulaie to talk. They sat with their feet in the pool gazing up at the stars. She told Hugh that she's decided she's going to have the baby, but that she's leaving town to do it because she doesn't want the child to be a reminder of \"loss, guilt, shame.\" Hugh tried to talk Kelly into staying in town and giving the Buchanans and Cramers a chance to embrace the baby. Then she pushed him in the pool. When he got out, he took off his shirt and went in for a kiss, but Kelly stopped him and asked just for a hug. Hugh said he realizes it's not the right time. Kelly thanked him and called him a \"good friend\" (ouch).\n\n\nViki comforted Kevin and told him that he isn't entirely responsible for Kelly's misery. Kevin lamented pushing her toward Duke and flashed back to his ripping the ring off her finger in the rectory. Viki told him to stop living in the past and start looking to the future. Kevin said she's right, and then said it's not like Kelly is having Duke's kid or anything.\n\n\nTodd went by the hospital and Evangeline told him the operation worked. She gave him a huge hug as Cristian looked on. She said she's still not happy that he spent all that money and got her the surgery without her consent, but she didn't seem too hung up on it. When Cristian asked about Todd's urge to help others, Todd replied, \"Not others. Just her.\" Later, Cristian told Todd that he and Evangeline won't accept his money for the surgery as a gift and will pay him back. Todd said okay. Cristian went to hug Evangeline and a nurse came up to tell Todd that his daughter has had an accident and is in the hospital.\n\n\nAdriana checked Rex's pulse to make sure she didn't kill him. When he came to, she stood over him with a knife asking, \"How could you do this to me, Rex?\" She told Rex she knows he's the stalker. Rex said she's lost her mind and then wrestled her for the knife. She managed to get free and took off running down the beach.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair leaves Spencer to head to the bathroom. She looks at a picture of she Todd and the kids and then she turns on the shower, stepping into it with her cell phone. She calls the hospital and asks to have Dr. Spencer Truman paged. She returns to Spencer and he is all over her. She tells that phone call that he got must have done something good for him. She wants to know about it but he says that it was just over a patient of hers. Clint and Dorian made love and they lay together glad for this new connection between them. He can't stop worrying about Kevin. The future of the Buchanan's in his eyes is at risk. Dorian thinks that she can put his mind at ease. \"It is possible that Kelly is pregnant with Duke's child.\" Adriana checks to make sure that Rex is breathing. He is. She holds a knife on him when he wakes. \"You were doing it to me the whole time weren't you?\" She holds the knife on Rex and he slowly gets up, trying to convince Adriana that she is making a mistake. He lunges at her and gets the knife from her but when he turns his back, she nails him in the head again with some glassware and he is knocked out again. She leaves the cottage and goes running up the beach for her life. Rex tries to get up but is unable and falls unconscious again. Hugh comes over. Kelly tells that she is going to have her baby but she will move away and raise the child in secret. That way Kevin need never know that she had his grandchild. She and Hugh have a moment and almost kiss. They both agree that this isn't the right time to start something. Starr is with her friends and when they tell her to jump into a body of water from a high height, she does it without thinking. Todd is outside Evangeline's hospital room when he is called to the ER for Starr. Blair is tearing Spencer's apartment apart to find the gun. She digs through some drawers in the living room and she finds a stack of photographs. She sees one in particular that looks interesting. It is of a man who Spencer stands beside, with his arm around the man. \"Well, what 'cha doing?\" Spencer asks walking in the apartment slowly behind Blair",
