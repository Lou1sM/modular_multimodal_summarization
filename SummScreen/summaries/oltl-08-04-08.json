Clint was taken aback when Nora asked Dallas why she was in Llanview and when she planned to return to London. Dallas said that upon learning of the difficult times that Clint was experiencing, she had wanted to offer her support to him. With David Vickers, the dog, in hand, David interrupted the tense discussion and asked for a moment alone with Clint. The ladies obliged, and Nora escorted Dallas to the door. When Dallas informed Nora that she might extend her trip, Nora was less than thrilled.\n\n\nNora returned to the study just in time to witness David present Clint with a release form. The paperwork stated that Dorian had signed her rights to Buchanan Enterprises back to the Buchanan family. David claimed to have divorced Addie after Clint's proposal and said that Dorian had signed the papers with great joy. As Clint relished the victory and David appeared quite nervous, Nora watched silently. David urged Clint to make good on the ten million dollar check, but Clint wanted to call Dorian and thank her for having a change of heart.\n\n\nWhen David abruptly begged Clint not to contact Dorian, Nora became suspicious and glanced through the newspaper. While David continued to plead his case to Clint, Nora called David a fraud and presented him with the paper. Dorian had placed a legal notice in the paper of David and Addie's annulment, along with a time stamp. The notice proved that David had already signed off on the marriage when Clint had requested that he do so. Clint ordered Nigel to show David Vickers and his dog to the door.\n\n\nAlone together, Clint and Nora claimed victory for outsmarting David. Clint had a few ideas about how to take back control of B.E. but, for the moment, was relieved that he didn't have to tell David that David was really a Buchanan.\n\n\nOut in the foyer, David discussed his string of bad luck with Nigel. As Nigel held the door for him, David began wheezing and appeared to be sick. Before leaving, David looked in a nearby mirror and was stunned when he didn't see his reflection. Assuming he was under the weather, David left the mansion.\n\n\nBack in 1968, Emma stopped Spencer from stealing change out of the jukebox in the Good Day Caf\u00e9. Rex tried to convince Emma that she needed to find the right man to share her life with. Emma asked Rex if he had someone special in his life. Sadly, Rex's thoughts turned to Gigi. He told Emma that he did love someone but would never see her again.\n\n\nGigi met Brody at Rodi's Bar. The manager had offered to hire him as a bartender and Gigi as a waitress. When Brody told Gigi that the job was hers if she wanted it, Gigi hesitated. He reminded her that they were in desperate need of jobs, but Gigi was skeptical of spending so much time with Brody. Feeling insulted, Brody lashed out at Gigi and insisted that she was consumed with thoughts of Rex. Brody tried to convince Gigi that Rex had been drunk when he'd placed the weird call to her, but Gigi defended Rex and was certain that he was in trouble. After Brody reminded Gigi that Rex had run out on her before, Gigi reluctantly agreed to take the job.\n\n\nWhile Rex told Emma of his fear of heading to Vietnam, Bo and Renee sat at a nearby table. Renee thanked Bo for being truthful with Emma. Bo appeared to flirt with Renee. When Renee stated that she was staying at a nearby hotel, Bo asked if she would like some company. Renee told Bo that the fling they'd had was over and warned him to stop the flirting. Renee told Bo that she was leaving town in the morning, and perhaps they would run into each other again in the future. Bo was certain that they would. Since Emma and Renee were staying at the same hotel, Bo and Rex both walked the ladies, and little Spencer, across the street to the hotel.\n\n\nSeconds after Bo and Rex left the caf\u00e9, Maria and the other maid, Rosa, entered. Maria admitted that she had plans to meet Clint; she intended to tell him that she was pregnant with his child. Although Rosa warned her to break things off with Clint, Maria was certain that he would marry her once he learned of the pregnancy. Clint entered the caf\u00e9 and greeted Maria with a kiss. When Maria told Clint that she had something important to discuss with him, they retreated to a booth to talk.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a nervous Maria spoke with the caf\u00e9 owner, Jeremiah, who resembled Mo. Upon learning that Maria and Rosa were maids, Jeremiah warned Rosa that Asa had just left the caf\u00e9 and wouldn't like the idea of his son spending time with the hired help. Insulted, Maria told Jeremiah to mind his business. Jeremiah didn't want to fight, and he responded by placing a flower in Rosa's hair.\n\n\nAs Maria tried to tell Clint about the pregnancy, Bo and Rex returned to the caf\u00e9. Clint and Maria ended their conversation and separated. In a harsh tone, Bo warned Clint to stay away from Maria. Before leaving the caf\u00e9, Maria told Clint that she needed to speak with him. Clint agreed to meet her back at the ranch. After saying his goodbyes to Bo and Rex, Clint headed off to the ranch.\n\n\nUpon witnessing Bo's strange behavior toward Clint, Rex asked Bo if he actually thought that he was Asa. Bo knew exactly who he was. He told Rex that things weren't as they appeared. Bo informed Rex that Maria was pregnant with Clint's child. In order for history to play out, Asa had to pay Maria off to leave town.\n\n\nBo reminded Rex that if Clint and Maria didn't break up, Clint would never meet Viki, and Natalie would never be born. Rex surmised that if Asa never slept with Emma, David would never exist. Bo admitted that he didn't want anything to do with David Vickers but was certain that if he never existed, other things would be affected -- and not for the better. Afraid of being stuck in the past and being shipped to Vietnam, a frantic Rex tried to call Gigi.\n\n\nJeremiah observed Rex attempting to call Gigi from his cell phone. When Jeremiah asked what the gadget was, a sarcastic Rex told Jeremiah that he was actually from the year 2008 and had been accidentally trapped in the past. Showing little reaction, Jeremiah said that he understood and had read a book about time portals. Citing the book, Jeremiah suggested that they relocate to the portal and head in the other direction. Surprised by Jeremiah's apparent knowledge of their situation, Bo asked Jeremiah if he had the book on hand. While Jeremiah left to locate the book, Bo and Rex surmised that either Jeremiah was crazy or held the key to their problem.\n\n\nIn Mendorra, Cristian watched as Carlo announced to the townspeople that Tina and Cain were to be executed immediately. Carlo was eager to begin the execution, but a servant informed him that the executioner was in the process of sharpening the blade. Unnoticed, Cristian entered the room where the executioner stood sharpening the blade for the beheading of Tina and Cain.\n\n\nIn the bridal suite of the palace, Talia refused to believe Jonas' claim that Antonio was dead and demanded to see his corpse. Jonas told Talia that he had killed Antonio and that she could forget about him rescuing her. Jonas demanded that they consummate the marriage. Talia stated that she would die before ever allowing Jonas to touch her. In a threatening tone, he replied, \"Let's hope it doesn't come to that.\" Jonas grabbed Talia, but she fought him off.\n\n\nOutside the room, Antonio watched the guards from a distance. Blood dripping from his uniform, Antonio touched his wound and concocted a plan. Talia's desperate screams echoed through the halls of the palace. After diverting the guards' attention and rendering them both unconscious, Antonio removed a revolver from one of the guards. Antonio barged into the bridal suite and demanded that Jonas release Talia. Antonio punched Jonas several times. Leaving a badly injured Jonas behind, Antonio and Talia fled the palace and headed to the airstrip.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tina and Cain pleaded for their lives, but Carlo wasn't amused. Wearing a mask and carrying an axe, the executioner entered the room. Carlo demanded that the execution begin. Fearing their lives were over, Cain told Tina that he loved her. Tina replied, \"I love you too, Cord!\"\n\n\nAs the executioner dropped the axe upon the bound prisoners with great force, the crowd gasped as the axe made contact with the ropes that secured Tina and Cain. Tina and Cain were in shock and stood motionless. Removing his mask, Cristian told Tina and Cain to run and that a plane was waiting for them at the airstrip. As Tina and Cain ran off, Cristian held off Carlo and the guards with the axe.\n\n\nCain ran through the palace. He surfaced carrying several pieces of jewelry.\n\n\nAt the airstrip, Tina was reunited with Antonio and Talia. When Antonio inquired about Cristian and Cain, Tina had no idea where Cain was but told Antonio that she feared Cristian would be unable to escape the guards. Everyone was relieved when Cristian appeared. Seconds later, wearing a disguise, Cain surfaced. Cristian said that the Mendorran government kept a plane waiting at the airstrip at all times.\n\n\nWhen Tina asked if they could convince the pilot to fly them away, Cristian adamantly stated that they would force him. Before they could flee, Carlo and several armed guards appeared. With a big grin, Carlo exclaimed, \"Looks like your flight is grounded!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "David attempts to scam Clint and Nora since he has nowhere to go. But they don't fall for it. In Mendorra, Cristian saves Tina and Cain from beheading. Antonio saves Talia from Jonas. And they rush to find Sarah. Bo and Rex are still stuck in 1968 and at the Bon Jour Cafe. Rex wants to get back to the present. And Bo seems to know how they can do that better than Rex does. In the present, Brody tells Gigi he want to find them jobs and for them to commit to each other. But she makes it clear that she loves Rex and not Brody.",
