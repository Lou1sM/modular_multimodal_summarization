Clint accused Dorian of being drunk, while Viki was upset that Dorian had disrupted their wedding ceremonies.  Dorian assured everyone that she wasn't going to point out that Viki belonged with Clint or that Bo was the love of Nora's life. Instead, she proposed a toast.  Dorian hoped that Viki, Charlie, Nora, and Clint proved all of the naysayers wrong by having long and happy marriages.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Dorian sat down next to Blair, the ceremonies resumed.  Once the couples had exchanged wedding vows and rings, the grooms were invited to kiss the brides.  Afterwards, the newlyweds left the church.  Bo lagged behind; it was clear that he was not in a celebratory mood.\n\n\nTodd followed T\ufffda into the reception.  T\ufffda was annoyed because Todd had been with Blair.  Todd explained that he'd only made certain that Blair wouldn't drive home in her inebriated condition.  T\ufffda accused Blair of trying to get Todd's attention.  Todd pointed out that Blair had his attention because she was the mother of his children.  T\ufffda's irritation mounted until Todd managed to cajole her into dancing with him.\n\n\nA very drunk Blair stumbled around the empty church as she ranted about Todd.  Blair was furious because Todd had taken T\ufffda to the wedding.  As Blair rambled on, she noticed someone slumped over in one of the pews.  Upon closer inspection, she realized it was her aunt.  Dorian had passed out, with a scarf partially covering her face.\n\n\nAt the reception, Bo asked Nora to dance.  As they swayed to the music, Nora confessed that Dorian's untimely interruption had worried her.  Before Bo could reply, the brides were asked to prepare for the bouquet toss.  Nora slipped out of Bo's arms to join Viki.  When Viki tossed her bouquet, T\ufffda caught it.  To everyone's surprise, Blair caught the second bouquet.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Bo stood apart from the crowd.  As he lifted a drink to his lips, he spoke aloud to Lindsay.  Bo decided that he and Nora were not meant to be, since no one had stopped Nora's wedding.\n\n\nBrody found Jessica behind the church. When he noticed how tense Jessica was, he wondered if she had seen Nash again.  Jessica assured him that she was fine; she explained that she had taken flowers to Nash's grave.  Brody seemed to believe her.  While Brody fetched the car, Jessica called out to Nash.  She told him that she knew he was trying to tell her something, but she had no idea what the message was.\n\n\nAt the loft, Gigi offered Stacy money to have an abortion.  Stacy was offended by the suggestion.  She reminded Gigi that, under similar circumstances, Gigi hadn't had an abortion.  Gigi insisted that her situation had been different because Shane had been conceived in love.  Stacy shot back that her baby had also been the result of an act of love.\n\n\nGigi tried a different tactic.  She asked Stacy how she intended to support her child.  Stacy didn't have an answer, but it was clear that Stacy planned for Rex to be involved.  Stacy taunted Gigi by predicting that Rex would be involved in every aspect of Stacy's pregnancy.  Stacy was confident that the time they would spend preparing for their baby would bring Stacy and Rex closer together.\n\n\nGigi reminded Stacy that Rex already had a family and that he loved Gigi.  Stacy didn't put much stock in Rex's bond with Gigi and Shane.  Stacy pointed out that Rex had not been a part of Shane's life until recently.  Stacy was certain that once she gave birth to a beautiful and healthy baby, Rex would forget about the \"wheezing brat\" that Gigi gave him.\n\n\nStacy's slur against Shane infuriated Gigi.  She accused Stacy of being delusional and using her baby to trap Rex into a relationship that he didn't want.  Stacy suggested that they call Rex to ask him what he thought about Gigi's idea of aborting the baby.  Gigi ordered Stacy to put the phone down. Stacy realized that she had gained the upper hand.  She threw the envelope of money to the ground as she ordered Gigi to, \"take your abortion money and get the hell out of my house.\"\n\n\nStacy appeared rattled after Gigi had left.  Moments later, she doubled over with severe abdominal cramps.  When Stacy collapsed to the ground, she reached for the phone to call 9-1-1.  Later, paramedics forced their way into the apartment while Stacy writhed on the floor in pain.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Rex told Shane that Stacy would remain a part of their lives for the foreseeable future.  Rex was reluctant to say anything else, despite Shane's numerous questions.  Frustrated by Rex's refusal to explain the situation to him, Shane threatened to ask Stacy what was going on.  Rex decided to reveal that Stacy was pregnant.\n\n\nShane was surprisingly upbeat by the announcement.  Shane assumed that Stacy would marry the father of the baby and focus on her new family rather than trying to break up Rex and Gigi.  Rex confessed that it was unlikely Stacy would marry the father of the baby.  Unfortunately for Rex, that statement only raised more questions.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, Rex revealed that he was the father of Stacy's baby.  Shane was stunned.  He worried that Rex would lose interest in Gigi and Shane as he became more involved with Stacy and her child.  Rex reminded his son that there had been a time when Shane had longed to have a relationship with his father.  Rex imagined the baby would feel the same way if it grew up without a father.\n\n\nGigi arrived home a short time later.  When she realized that Shane knew that Rex was the father of Stacy's child, she sent Shane to his room.  Rex explained that he had intended wait until they could talk to Shane together, but Shane had pushed for answers.  Gigi understood why Rex had felt compelled to answer their son's questions.\n\n\nRex was frustrated when his phone kept vibrating with repeated calls from Stacy.  Rex decided to turn off the phone, so that he could focus on Gigi.  When Rex asked Gigi about the wedding, she confessed that she had gone to the ATM instead.  At Rex's look of confusion, Gigi revealed that she had withdrawn money, gone to the loft, and offered Stacy money to have an abortion.  Rex was speechless.\n\n\n",
