    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the police station, Natalie told John she had to tell him something.  After sitting down, she blurted her secret out - she was pregnant.  John seemed stunned.  \"Say something,\" Natalie begged.  \"I think I need a drink,\" John murmured.\n\n\nNatalie explained that she'd found out she was pregnant on the same day  that Jessica had received her baby news.  When John asked her why she hadn't told him sooner, Natalie hedged and said she hadn't been sure it was the right time.  After John pressed the issue, Natalie blurted out, \"because of Brody,\" then covered and said she hadn't wanted to steal Brody and Jessica's moment from them, and didn't want to tell anyone until she'd made it through her first trimester safely.  She told John that she wasn't sure how he'd react, as they'd just gotten back together and were still figuring each other out again; she knew how deeply Marty's miscarriage had hurt him, and she didn't know if he was ready for \"another pregnant girlfriend.\"  John asked her if that was her only reason for staying silent, and Natalie admitted that she hadn't known whether she was ready for a baby either.\n\n\n\"So are you?\" John asked.  Natalie said she was ready to have a child, but asked John what he wanted.  Lost in thought, John told Natalie he thought about the things he could do with a son or a daughter - taking a boy to ball games, or scaring a girl's boyfriends away - but he realized that there were also endless dangers in a child's life.  Natalie reminded him that there were good things in family life as well, but John said that after Marty's miscarriage he couldn't help but think of the tragic moments, instead of the beautiful ones.  \"I don't think I can go through that again,\" John told Natalie.\n\n\nTearful, Natalie asked if that meant he didn't want her to have the baby.  \"Not at all,\" he replied, taking her into his arms.  John agreed with what she'd said before; it had taken them a long way to find their way back to each other, and they were still figuring things out, but he took Natalie's pregnancy as a sign that they belonged together.  \"It's scary, but it's a good thing,\" John said with a smile.  He told Natalie that he was getting another chance to have a family, with her, and he couldn't want to get started.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Clint, Dorian, David, and Mandy the hooker continued their drinking binge with shots all around.  Clint toasted to \"women who know what they want,\" while Mandy toasted to \"men who know how to give it to them.\"\n\n\nNear the entrance, Gigi arrived for her shift, and a harried co-worker told her that the mayor's table was all hers.  Gigi asked what was going on, and her colleague explained that \"the mayor and her boytoy\" were trying to convince the world they weren't in love.  \"And the other two?\" Gigi asked, staring at Clint and Mandy.  \"Beards,\" her colleague replied. \"Have fun.\"\n\n\nBefore Gigi could see to the crazy quartet, Rex arrived from the hospital.  Gigi was relieved to see that her beau suffered no ill after-effects from his lost night in Boston, but was angry that he'd taken the risk in a routine investigation.  When Rex said his only regret was losing his one contact who could help him find Bennett Thompson, Gigi punched him in the arm and warned him that he'd dodged a bullet.\n\n\nJust then, a drunken David staggered over to the couple and began rambling at Rex, begging him not to rat Mandy out as an escort; remembering the younger man's sordid past, he feared Rex's eagle eye for spotting \"ladies of the evening.\"  \"She's a hooker?\" Rex replied, stunned.  David told Rex to tell Dorian that Mandy was a swimsuit model, then began blurting out follow-up requests, and finally asked Rex and Gigi to get Dorian too drunk to continue her charade with Clint.  He begged for Rex's cooperation, claiming that they were all but brothers thanks to Bo.  Gigi and Rex agreed, and David stumbled back to his table.\n\n\nGigi asked Rex why he wasn't busting David, and Rex explained that he didn't have enough time in the day to thwart all David's schemes; plus, he wanted to see Dorian squirm.  Changing the subject, he asked Gigi what was going on with Natalie.  Flashing back to her time with Natalie outside the abortion clinic, Gigi told Rex she couldn't say, and insisted that it was Natalie's secret to keep, not theirs; when Natalie wanted to tell Rex, she would.  She promised Rex that Natalie wasn't sick, and that her issues had nothing to do with the two of them as a couple.\n\n\nBack at the drunkards' table, David made a dash for the jukebox, followed by Dorian.  David refused to allow Dorian access to the machine, fearing she would pick an \"Edith Pilaf\" song.  Soon, Dorian began cycling through her foreign languages to curse David and a scuffle broke out, leading to an unexpected romantic clinch for the two exes, who stared into each other's arms, stunned.\n\n\nAt the table, Clint and Mandy probed each other for information on their respective sham romances, but got nowhere.  Spotting David and Dorian's intimate moment, they rushed to intervene and separate the duo, and attempted to dance with the drunks as David and Dorian continued to bicker over the music.  Clint said it was time for a pot of coffee, while David taunted \"Missus Mayor\" to fetch the java.  \"Fetch this!\" Dorian snapped.  Gigi and Rex broke the quarrel up, and Clint agreed to call his limousine driver to take them home.\n\n\nAs the restaurant cleared out, David, Dorian, Clint and Mandy were left in an alcove waiting for their rides.  When Rex told them their transportation had arrived, Clint dragged the soused Dorian out the door, even as she continued bickering with David.  David, thoroughly pickled, suggested he and Mandy begin doing body shots, but as he began to suffer gastric distress his date hurried him towards the exit.\n\n\n\"Okay, well, you don't have to go home but you can't stay here!\" Rex told the couple. \"No, actually, you should really just go home.\"  \"Rex, thanks for a great evening, bro,\" David babbled as Mandy dragged him to the door. \"It was so good for you to see me.\"  As David and Mandy left, Gigi and Rex burst into laughter.\n\n\nOutside Ford's new apartment, Elijah lurked with a gun, waiting for his prey.  When he heard James' voice down the corridor, he hid and watched as Ford and James entered the elder brother's new pad.\n\n\nInside, James told Ford he was impressed with the new digs, and asked him why he'd left his old apartment.  Ford reluctantly explained that Cristian and Layla had kicked him out for stealing an acquaintance's girlfriend; he said things with Langston had started out just fun, then admitted that \"the chick got to me.\"  \"And you blew it?\" James asked.  \"Big time,\" Ford muttered.  James wanted to know more, but Ford distracted himself with hauling James' luggage and boxes into the apartment.\n\n\nAs the recently hospitalized James playfully bossed his brother around with the unpacking effort, there was a knock at the door.  Ford answered out, and was shocked to find a grim-faced Elijah standing there.\n\n\nAs Ford and Elijah exited to the corridor, James called Starr and left a message on her voicemail.  He explained that he wasn't going back to Ohio after all, but staying in Llanview with his brother.  \"Maybe I'll see you sometime,\" he said hopefully.\n\n\nIn the corridor, a frightened Ford asked Elijah why he was being harassed at home, and claimed he'd followed Elijah's instructions to keep quiet.  \"Not according to Hannah,\" Elijah replied, and asked him about his recent conversation with his ex.  Ford claimed that Hannah had called him and he'd hung up, but Elijah explained how he'd found Hannah at St. Anne's documenting her troubles, and suspected that Ford was the one who'd given her the idea to incriminate him on paper as an \"insurance policy.\"  Ford insisted he was innocent, and said no one would believe Hannah's story.  \"No one's ever gonna hear her story,\" Elijah said, and explained that Hannah had been \"dealt with.\"\n\n\nHorrified, Ford asked Elijah if he'd killed Hannah, but Elijah said he hadn't had to.  He explained that Ford needed to remember that Elijah knew where he and his little brother lived, and not get any crazy ideas.  Ford asked what he'd done to Hannah, and Elijah scoffed at the thought that the lothario actually cared about \"that little slut.\"  He told Ford that there was nothing he could do for Hannah, and that he needed to focus on keeping himself and James safe.  \"Don't do anything else you'd regret,\" Elijah warned.\n\n\nFord returned to the apartment and told an inquisitive James that Elijah was nobody, then changed his mind; he gave his sibling Elijah's name and warned James to stay away from him.  James thought Elijah was connected to their father's organization in Ohio, but Ford said Elijah had nothing to do with their father.  James wanted to know more, and Ford said it didn't matter - all that mattered was for James to steer clear of the lawyer, and run like hell if he ever saw him.  James was annoyed by Ford's cryptic answers, and the harried Ford lost his temper: \"I've got it totally under control!\"\n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Cole raced out of Hannah's room, calling for help.  A nun and one of the doctors rushed in, checking Hannah's pulse.  The doctor quickly realized Hannah had overdosed, and told Cole they needed to pump her stomach.\n\n\nAt Starr and Cole's apartment, Starr shared her sorrows about T\u00e9a's illness with Langston, but quickly wanted to change the subject, asking her BFF about her own life.  Langston said there had been developments, but Starr might not want to know - \"it's about Ford.\"  Starr was upset and said she'd thought Langston was done with the \"player,\" and Langston explained that she had as well, until she'd seen him at La Boulaie.  She related to Starr her encounter with Ford after his fight with Inez, and how different and vulnerable he'd seemed.  She believed that Ford's mother's abandonment of him had scarred him at a young age.\n\n\nStarr dismissed Langston's psychoanalysis and said Ford had only seemed upset because someone had done something to him, as opposed to the pain he inflicted on others.  Langston disagreed, and mentioned Ford's guilt over not being there for James.  Hearing James's name, Starr reacted instantly and asked how her former partner in crime was.  \"I thought you were done with him,\" Langston replied slyly.\n\n\nStarr insisted she was only worried about James because of the shooting, and said that when she knew he'd made a full recovery he'd be out of her life; she was focused on Cole and their life together with Hope.  Langston asked if Cole being released from jail meant his relationship with Starr was back on track, then asked where Cole was.  \"He's out,\" Starr mumbled, struggling to process Langston's difficult question.\n\n\nAs Hannah was taken away for treatment, Cole called Starr from St. Anne's and explained that Hannah had overdosed.  \"Again?\" Starr asked, incredulous. \"She just doesn't give up, does she?\"  Realizing her insensitivity, she apologized, and Cole said that Hannah had almost died, and might not make it.  Starr reluctantly agreed that Cole needed to stay at St. Anne's until he was sure Hannah would pull through.  \"Keep me posted,\" she sighed, and hung up.\n\n\nAfter hanging up, Cole confronted the nun he'd encountered earlier and asked her why she'd kept him from Hannah but allowed Hannah access to her pills.  The nun pleaded ignorance, but admitted that Cole had saved the girl's life.  The doctor returned and told Cole that Hannah would be fine.  Cole wanted answers on how they'd misjudged the severity of Hannah's depression, but the doctor said the important thing was that Cole had understood Hannah better than them, and been there to help her.\n\n\nAlone in the room, Cole called Starr again and got her voicemail.  He explained that Hannah would live, but he was going to stay overnight at St. Anne's to make sure she was properly cared for.  He told Starr he loved her.\n\n\nBack at the apartment, Starr told Langston that Hannah had overdosed yet again.  Checking her voicemail, she discovered James's message and lied to Langston that it was nothing, then changed the subject back to Ford.  Langston explained that she'd almost given Ford a chance until she'd discovered he was being tested for STDs after sleeping around some more.  She resolved to stay away from Ford: \"He's poison.\"\n\n\nThinking back to Cole, Langston told Starr that Cole would be concerned for anyone in Hannah's kind of trouble.  Starr asked if that was really it, and revealed that Cole and Hannah had almost slept together in Delaware.  Langston was floored, and Starr explained that nothing had happened.  When Langston asked about Starr's own rapport with James, Starr hit the roof and reminded her friend again that there was nothing between her and James; she loved Cole, and they were getting things back to the way they'd been before, even if there were bumps in the road.  \"We'll get there,\" Starr sighed. \"I know it.\"\n\n\nAlone in the living room later on, Starr called James back.  \"Hey, Twinkle,\" James replied, delighted to hear from her.  Starr and James made awkward chatter about his staying in Llanview, and James asked her if she was trying to get rid of him.  Starr said she was merely surprised.  James explained that \"Bobby\" needed him; he didn't know what Ford was going through, but it was big.\n\n\nStarr expressed relief that James was out of the hospital safe and sound.  James told her that he'd stay out of her way in the future, as he didn't want to cause any more problems for her or Cole.  Starr thanked him for his kind words, and haltingly told James she hoped everything worked out for him.\n\n\n\"Guess this is it,\" James said.  \"I guess,\" Starr murmured. \"Goodbye, James.\"  \"Goodbye, Twi - goodbye, Starr,\" James replied, his voice strained.\n\n\nAfter hanging up, James was morose.  As Ford bustled around the apartment with moving boxes, he asked who James had spoken to on the phone.  \"No one,\" James replied glumly.\n\n\nBack at the apartment, Starr seemed equally anguished from her last goodbye to James.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair laughed off Kelly's suggestion that Elijah was a murderer, but Kelly explained that he'd killed more than one person: Melinda, Rodney, and Glenn in Boston.  Blair asked what had happened to Kelly's \"Bennett Thompson\" theory, and Kelly said that she suspected Elijah and Thompson were one and the same.  \"Everything you thought you know, or knew, about this man, it's a lie,\" she declared.\n\n\nBlair asked Kelly what made her so sure of her theory, and scoffed at Kelly's story about Rex's investigation in Boston, as well as the late Glenn's description of a \"tall, dark and handsome stranger.\"  \"'Tall, dark, and handsome - it must be Eli!\" Blair exclaimed sarcastically.  Kelly said she'd find more evidence, and insisted she was doing it all for Blair.  \"No, you're doing it for yourself,\" Blair snapped.  She said Kelly had no proof, and was tormenting her because she couldn't stand to see her happy when Kelly herself wasn't.\n\n\nOutraged, Kelly told Blair that they'd had their differences but were still family, and she wanted Blair to be happy.  Blair said that Elijah made her happy.  \"He's not Eli!\" Kelly said.  \"You don't know that!\" Blair cried.\n\n\nKelly warned Blair that John believed her theory as well.  Livid, Blair wanted to call John, but Kelly explained that there was an ongoing investigation into Elijah and she wasn't supposed to have told her cousin.  \"You should've listened to him,\" Blair muttered.  \"I couldn't,\" Kelly whispered. \"I was afraid you'd marry Eli, and he'd kill you too.\"\n\n\nBlair said that Elijah could never kill her; he loved her, and showed her how much everyday.  She realized Kelly had no motive for Elijah to supposedly be a killer.  Exasperated, Kelly reminded Blair that three people were dead.  Just then, Elijah burst in and jovially asked the ladies what they were fighting about.  \"Nothing but the usual,\" Kelly said, exchanging loaded glances with Blair.\n\n\nCozying up to Blair, Elijah asked her if they could head upstairs.  Grabbing two wineglasses, he suggested they share a bottle together in bed, and Blair agreed.  As Elijah headed to the kitchen, Kelly thanked Blair for not spilling the beans.  Blair told Kelly she hadn't wanted to embarrass her, and warned her cousin to drop the investigation, or she'd tell Elijah everything.\n\n\nA musical montage began as scenes played out across Llanview.  Blair and Elijah filled their glasses of wine and headed upstairs, leaving a fearful Kelly alone in the drawing room.  As Blair followed Elijah upstairs, she cast an errant glance at the drawing room doors.  At Rodi's, Gigi and Rex closed up the bar and danced together to music on the jukebox.  At the Ford brothers' new apartment, James stared longingly at his phone, while at St. Anne's, Cole held the sleeping Hannah's hand.  At Starr and Cole's apartment, Starr and Langston shared pints of ice cream and thought of the men in their lives.\n\n\n",

The doctor saves Hannah and tells Cole that it was close. Cole stays the night in the hospital with Hannah, holding her hand while she sleeps. Starr tells Langston about Todd and Tea getting married. Langston tells Starr that she saw the softer side of Ford when his mother upset him. She says she was actually considering giving him another chance until she found out that he had been exposed to an STD which means he slept with someone else. Ford and James move into their new apartment down the hall from Cristian and Layla's place. James calls Starr and tells her that he is staying in Llanview but that he will stay out of her way and not cause any more problems between her and Cole.

Ford warns James to stay away from Eli. Blair doesn't believe Kelley when she says Eli is a murderer. She says Kelly doesn't want to see her happy. Kelly says she is afraid Eli will kill Blair too so she had to warn her even though John McBain asked her not to. Natalie goes to see John and tells him that she is pregnant. She says she waited to tell him because she didn't know how he would react to having another pregnant girlfriend so soon after losing the baby with Marty. He tells her that he isn't sure that he can go through that kind of tragedy again but that the baby is a sign that they belong together. He agrees to keep the pregnancy secret for a while.
