    "soap_central": "\n\nStarr found Jack in the park, and demanded to know where he'd been. He claimed to be busy with work, but Starr wondered how he could concentrate with the events from the night before looming over the family. \"Dad is dad and that's it,\" Jack replied. Jack wondered \"what kind of idiot\" would make himself look like the \"before picture\" anyway. Starr explained to Jack that she remembered the old Todd, and the man who'd shown up had Todd's face, body, voice, and expressions. Jack thought that the man had just been thorough.\n\n\nJack thought that Starr was abandoning their father, but Starr insisted that she wasn't. Jack couldn't believe that Starr was betraying Todd after what he'd done for Jack. A confused Starr asked Jack to elaborate. He reluctantly admitted that Todd had gotten him out of murder charges. He didn't think that his father would have done that if the man weren't really Todd Manning. Starr told Jack that their father had done things that the old Todd never would have, and cited all the trouble with Cole.\n\n\nJack thought that Starr was just guessing, and told her that she hadn't been a \"pregnant teenager\" before Todd had plastic surgery. He said that she could \"replace dad with a nut job,\" but to leave him out of it. He stormed away from his sister.\n\n\nT\u00e9a demanded to know if she was married to \"the real Todd Manning.\" Not looking at Todd, she admitted that she'd gone to the jail to talk to the man with Todd's original face. Todd asked her to look at him, and wondered what she saw. \"My husband,\" she replied. He wanted her to say his name, and believe that he was the real Todd.\n\n\nT\u00e9a tried to think about things logically, but wondered how the man had known things about her and Todd's past. Todd explained it away as information found on the Internet. T\u00e9a informed him that the man had known how much Todd had paid her to marry him the first time. However, Todd recited several things that he didn't think the man would ever know. Todd wanted to know what she had said to the man, because he had a right to know if she were doubting him. T\u00e9a wanted to know why Tomas had said that Todd wasn't the real Todd. Todd believed that Tomas liked making trouble for him.\n\n\nT\u00e9a demanded that he tell her everything, and he agreed. He explained that Baker had helped him close a business deal a few years before. As a return favor, Baker had wanted Todd to launder money. Baker had told Todd that he would be helping his country, since Baker was a CIA agent. Todd had agreed, until T\u00e9a had gotten sick. Todd had looked into Baker, and found out that he was a rogue CIA agent. Todd had backed out of the deal, and assumed that Baker had sent someone to shoot him. T\u00e9a was grateful that Todd had finally told her.\n\n\nTodd hoped T\u00e9a believed him. He didn't know what was going on, but had felt like he'd been looking in the mirror when the mysterious man had first shown his face. \"I fell in love with that face,\" T\u00e9a related. She wondered if Todd had any idea who the man was. Todd had a hunch that Baker had sent to man to \"kill me from the inside out.\" Baker probably wanted Todd's family to turn against him, so Todd yelled that T\u00e9a was playing right into Baker's hands.\n\n\nAs Todd asked again if T\u00e9a believed him, Jack entered the house. Jack didn't care about the mysterious man, or what anyone else said -- Jack believed his father. \"I'm on your side, and always will be,\" Jack assured his father.\n\n\n\"Hi, sis,\" the man with Todd's original face said as a shocked Viki looked into the jail cell, \"You don't recognize your own brother?\" he asked. Viki recognized the man as Sam's friend, but wondered how he had Todd's old face. The man explained that he'd been locked up for eight years, tortured, and drugged. He'd escaped and returned to Llanview for his family, and had found someone else posing as Todd Manning.\n\n\nThe man knew he could count on Viki, because he trusted her \"above all others.\" He begged her not to give up on him. Viki told him that Todd had gotten plastic surgery because of how badly he'd been beaten up, but the man reminded her that she had seen him in the cemetery once, and couldn't believe it was him. She remembered the moment, and the man begged her to believe him.\n\n\nThe man reminded her how he'd once wanted to leave town, but Viki had gotten Starr to him, convincing him to stay. She remembered the moment, as he told her that she'd taught him how to be a father. Both in tears, he talked about when he'd taken the Buchanans hostage. He'd thought that Asa had been faking the heart attack, but Viki was the one who'd convinced him to get help for Asa. She remembered that moment, as well, as the man told her that she always found the good in him.\n\n\nThe man told Viki that she had gone outside one day to look for him, and she realized that he'd been the one to break the picture of her and Todd. She wondered why he hadn't said anything, but he replied that Viki had been in the house with Todd. Viki thought that the situation was impossible. The man pleaded with her to believe him. Both in tears, Viki turned to leave. She promised to get to the bottom of things, and left.\n\n\nStarr entered the jail, to the happiness of the man. \"Hi, Shorty,\" he said, beaming at Starr. He marveled at how grown-up she was. In tears, he expressed how happy he was that she believed him. She pulled a chair in front of his cell and sat down. She said that he knew her nickname, but wanted to see what else he knew about her and her family.\n\n\nBlair looked at her and Todd's wedding photo as Tomas arrived. Blair wanted to know everything Tomas knew about the two Todds, and demanded to know which man was the real Todd. Tomas thought that she should have been able to tell from the kiss, but she didn't know. Tomas agreed to tell her what he knew, but hoped she'd forgive him for his past actions. He removed a folder from his bag, and handed it to Blair.\n\n\nTomas started that he hadn't realized that the man he'd reported to in the CIA had gone rogue. He'd thought that he'd been helping his country, when he'd really been committing unethical, unsanctioned operations. He confessed that he'd been an assassin. He continued that he'd been told to assassinate \"this man\" years before, and handed an old picture of Todd to Blair. Blair wondered why. He told her that Todd had allegedly been funding terrorist activity, but the evidence had eventually turned out to be faked.\n\n\nTomas had arrived in Llanview eight years before to \"eliminate\" Todd. He said that Mitch Lawrence had gotten to Todd first. Tomas had found Todd beaten up in Victor Lord's mausoleum. Baker had wanted Todd alive, so Tomas had delivered the man to Baker. A shocked Blair called Tomas a monster. Tomas revealed that Todd had been holding his and Blair's wedding photo. Tomas had held onto the photo because of guilt, and because he'd believed that Todd had been innocent. Tomas had eventually found out the truth about Baker, and had enlisted Claude's help to get out of the CIA.\n\n\nTomas had started to paint pictures of the photo over and over, wondering if he'd left the woman in the photo to raise children alone. Disgusted, Blair only wanted to know which man was the real Todd. Tomas had tried to get a sample of Todd's blood when Todd had been in a coma. Tomas had been interrupted, so he didn't know. Blair wondered why Tomas hadn't gone to John. Tomas thought that Baker would have found out, and Todd's family would have become targets for Baker.\n\n\nTomas admitted that Todd believed that he was the real Todd. He wouldn't blame Blair if she didn't believe him, because he'd given her no reason to trust him. He swore that he'd take back \"that moment eight years ago\" if he could. Blair related that she'd been in love with Todd for half of her life, and she didn't even know who the real Todd was. Tomas knew they'd find out soon because of John's DNA test.\n\n\nBaker sat in John's office, because John wanted to talk about Todd. Baker played dumb, so John went through Baker's wallet. He found a business card with the same logo as the encrypted files, but Baker played dumb again. John wanted to know why Baker had been trying to kill the man with Todd's original face. Baker replied that the man had killed one of Baker's agents. Baker believed that the man was a loose cannon, and that he needed to be stopped before more people were killed.\n\n\nJohn wanted to know who the man was. Baker was silent, so John told him that he was free to stay locked up for another night. Baker replied that John wouldn't live long enough to do anything about it if Baker told John who the man was. John decided to take his chances. There was a knock on the door, and an officer entered with two of Baker's agents. As Baker smirked, the two agents showed identification, and a federal court order to have Baker released.\n\n\nThe agents added that they would also need the other prisoner that John had locked up. John refused, because the man had committed a crime within the jurisdiction. He also told them that there was nothing on the court order about releasing the man into the agents' custody.  John offered to call the judge to ask why Baker had had the man locked up for eight years for no reason.\n\n\nBaker assured his agents that they could call the judge for another court order for the man. John told them to get out of his office, so they left. He asked the officer to follow the men, but not to let on that he was following them. The officer agreed, and handed John the envelope with the DNA results. Viki entered John's office and asked who the man in the jail cell was. John told her that the answer everyone was looking for would be in the envelope in his hand.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody is discussing and wondering what has happened regarding \"the two Todd Mannings\". Jack tells Starr he doesn't believe a word of the strange guy who is scamming them and knows that the Todd we've known for 8 years is their father. But Starr questions how this man who looks exactly like Todd she knew before the surgery seems to remember so many things about her that only Todd would know. Tea asks current Todd what is going on and admits she has her doubts that he is real and she is considering that maybe original Todd is telling the truth. Blair talks to Tomas who confesses his involvement with Baker, the CIA and original Todd years ago. Yet they both admit they have no answer as to whom is the real Todd Manning and who is an imposter. Viki goes to the jail cell to talk to original Todd, in awe that he looks exactly like her brother whom she has known until 2003 although she realizes she's believed that \"current\" Todd is the real Todd after getting reconstructive surgery. original Todd brings up memories and recalls conversations he's had with his sister that only Todd would know and urges her to know and believe that he is the brother she's shared the special bond with throughout his life. She doesn't know what to say, do or think. John and the cops are then determined to find out what Baker's scheme is, why original Todd has been locked up for 8 years and they are ready to do a DNA test to unravel the mystery of who is in fact the real Todd Manning.",
