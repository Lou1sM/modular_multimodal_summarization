    "soap_central": "\nSo Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Good Night:\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie and Viki were surprised when \"Jessica\" ushered them into the living room, which had been decorated with balloons and a farewell banner. Tess explained that she had decided to throw together an impromptu goodbye party for Viki. Since it was a last-minute event, Tess asked Natalie to call the family and invite them over for the celebration. While Natalie made the necessary phone calls, Tess handed Viki an itinerary and informed her that she had arranged for a car to pick Viki up that very evening, at 9:00 p.m. The car would whisk Viki to the airport.\n\n\nViki appeared taken aback and asked her daughter what the rush was to see her embark on her trip two days early. Tess didn't appear to expect the question, but she recovered quickly. She explained the early departure was so that Viki would have the opportunity to visit with Joey, Kevin, and Zane in London before she embarked on her trip to Africa.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint and Nora discussed the situation with Dorian. Clint tried to devise a new plan to wrest control of the family business from his bitter ex. While Clint made a few business calls, Nora took a moment to talk to Cole when he returned home. He told Nora that he had relinquished parental rights to his baby. Nora was sympathetic as Cole went on to tell her that he had also broken things off with Starr.\n\n\nLater, while Clint and Nora were at Viki's farewell party, Markko stopped by the mansion with a game in hand. While Markko and Cole played the video game, Markko asked Cole about his decision to break up with Starr. Cole told Markko that he had lost his parents, Patrick and Marty. Staying with Starr, Cole felt, would be a constant reminder of another loss, the baby.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian and Langston walked into the living room and found Starr sitting in the dark, watching a movie. They were both concerned when they saw the sad expression on Starr's face. Dorian and Langston rushed to Starr's side and asked her what had happened. Starr stopped the movie and told them about Cole's decision to give up the baby and end his relationship with her.\n\n\nAt first, Dorian and Langston felt that Starr had misread Cole's intentions, but Starr soon convinced them otherwise. Dorian was furious and blamed Todd for Cole's decision to break things off with Starr. Starr insisted that Todd had had nothing to do with Cole's choices. Dorian pretended to drop the matter until she excused herself and stepped into the foyer. Alone, Dorian vowed to make Todd pay for forcing Cole to break Starr's heart.\n\n\nBlair and Jack bumped into Todd at the Hallowed Grounds coffeehouse. It wasn't long before Blair and Todd were bickering. Jack grew annoyed with his parents, but neither seemed capable of setting their differences aside for their son's sake. Todd accused Blair of being behind Cole's decision to sign over his rights to the baby, which would allow Marcie to adopt their grandchild. Blair was stunned by the news and insisted that she'd had nothing to do with Cole's decision.\n\n\nTodd didn't believe Blair but the argument took a turn when Todd admitted that it was killing him that he couldn't see his children. Blair was sympathetic and told Jack that he could spend a few minutes with his father before she dropped Jack off at his friend's house for a sleepover. Unfortunately, Todd made a crass comment about Blair having plans for a sleepover with John. Blair quickly gathered up her bags and marched out. Jack was equally disgusted with Todd and followed his mother out the door.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair returned home and found Dorian in the foyer. Dorian quickly told Blair what had happened between Starr and Cole. Blair, in return, told Dorian about Todd and mentioned that he had been headed to Viki's for a farewell party. Dorian was furious. She couldn't believe that no one had invited Dorian to Viki's party after Dorian had recently saved Viki's life. Dorian left in a huff while Blair went into the living room to see Starr.\n\n\nRoxy was trying to cool off at the Angel Square Hotel when Jared walked in, looking for Charlie. Roxy explained that the air conditioning was out and that Charlie had gone to buy a fan. Jared decided to wait in the lobby until his father returned. When Charlie returned empty-handed, Roxy left to run an errand. Alone in the lobby, Jared gave Charlie a special gift. It was a rare book of architecture that included a building that Charlie had built. Charlie was touched by the gesture. He admitted to Jared that instead of looking for a fan, Charlie had decided to go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.\n\n\nBlair stepped out into the hallway to sift through the shopping bags that she had taken home. She wanted to show Starr and Langston a couple of blouses that she had bought for them. Unfortunately, Blair found an unfamiliar woman's garment and quickly realized that she had accidentally picked up one of Todd's bags.\n\n\nAt Viki's party, Todd asked Natalie questions about the brakes on her car. He suggested that they might have been tampered with. Everyone dismissed the possibility, but Tess was clearly nervous. She quickly distracted Todd by talking about Bree. Minutes later, Tess appeared annoyed when Dorian walked in unannounced.\n\n\nIn Mendorra, Talia found herself in the middle when her friends ended up in a standoff with her father. Talia was forced to find a compromise. She promised Carlo that she would remain in Mendorra if Carlo allowed her friends to board a waiting jet, unharmed. Carlo reluctantly agreed.\n\n\nAntonio refused to follow his brother and the others to the plane. He wanted to remain with Talia. Talia refused to consider the offer and reminded him of Jamie. It was the one argument that was certain to sway Antonio to leave with the others. Talia and Antonio shared a bittersweet goodbye before Antonio walked away.\n\n\nOn the plane, Antonio was patched up. He promised that he would return for Talia and rescue her from her father's clutches. As the jet began to taxi down the runway, Cristian looked out the window and started yelling for the plane to stop. Minutes later, Cristian returned to the jet with Sarah. She was disheveled but appeared otherwise unharmed. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Dorian finds out that Cole broke up with Starr, she instantly assumes that Todd put him up to it because he doesn't want any man in his daughter's life except for himself. But neither Starr nor Blair buy that. \"Jessica\" (who's probably really Tess) plans a going away party for Viki and invites her friends and family. But she still has a \"plan\" for Natalie and Jared. Charlie and Jared are getting along well and reconciling. Antonio grudgingly agrees to go back with Tina and Cristian and leave Talia behind after she demands he does. They all believe they have lost Sarah. But Cristian finds her, and she is alive and well.",
