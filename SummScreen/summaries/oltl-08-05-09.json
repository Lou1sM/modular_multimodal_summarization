T\ufffda was infuriated by Blair's interfering in her night with Todd, and ordered him to stop treating her so cavalierly.  Todd asked Blair to go home and leave them alone, but Blair refused.\n\n\nThe four guests of honor, Viki, Charlie, Clint, and Nora, took Todd's bizarre love triangle in stride.  \"Should we call someone?\" Charlie asked. \"The National Guard, Green Berets?\"  Nora said that the disruption was nothing compared to Asa's nuptials, and Clint suggested they ignore Todd and his lovers altogether.  As Clint kissed Nora passionately, a glum Bo watched from the sidelines, then trudged off alone.\n\n\nNearby, Rachel and Matthew both noticed Bo's reaction.  Matthew commented that his father was upset by Clint and Nora's marriage, and Rachel reminded Matthew that his blackmail attempt hadn't helped his family's disposition.  Matthew argued his side regarding the surgery, but Rachel told her brother that he was faced with an adult responsibility, and asked him if he could live with it.\n\n\nHoping to get distance from her romantic foibles, T\ufffda made small talk with Shaun and Destiny, and gave Destiny her bouquet.  Todd and Blair pursued T\ufffda, as Todd attempted to get back into T\ufffda's good graces and Blair continued to torment her nemesis.  T\ufffda asked Shaun to take her home.  Todd told T\ufffda it wasn't his fault Blair had showed up, but T\ufffda said she should've known she'd been fooling herself about a future with him, and refused to come in second.  Todd insisted he wanted her and not Blair, and told Blair so to her face before taking T\ufffda in his arms and kissing her.  Nauseated, Blair staggered away to sulk.\n\n\nT\ufffda wasn't impressed with Todd's gesture, but as he continued to lay on the charm, Destiny ordered her to give him a chance.  Reluctantly, T\ufffda agreed as Todd ushered her out of the ballroom to give her a \"surprise.\"\n\n\nAs the festivities continued, Jared and Natalie extended their congratulations to the happy couples, while at a nearby table, Jessica sat alone, musing silently.  As Brody returned to her side, Jessica apologized to him for being hung up on thoughts of Nash and for returning to his gravesite.  She couldn't shake the feeling that her husband wanted to tell her something.  Brody told Jess he understood that her feelings were in turmoil near her wedding anniversary, and asked her if she thought they were moving too fast.  Jessica said no, but admitted she was worried about fixating on the past, and not the future.  Brody promised her he could handle her memories.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Rex was stunned when Gigi confessed that she had tried to pay Stacy to abort his child.  She assured him that Stacy had refused.  Rex demanded to know why Gigi had made the offer.  Gigi thought the answer was obvious: she couldn't stand Stacy bearing his child.  She knew that through the child, Stacy would always be a part of their lives, slowly destroying their family.  Without the baby, Gigi said, they might have a chance.  \n\n\nRex refused to abandon his offspring the way he had Shane, Stacy or no Stacy.  He said that Stacy was a menace, but her baby had done nothing.  He promised Gigi that he could both protect their family and raise his child.  Gigi admitted that she wished Stacy wasn't pregnant, then immediately apologized for her thoughts.  She said she knew they couldn't take back what had happened before, or any of their mistakes.  Rex embraced Gigi, and told her that all they needed to do was stick together.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy screamed at the paramedics to save her baby as she writhed on the floor.  She told them she'd collapsed after an argument with her sister.  As the paramedics moved her to a gurney, Stacy began feverishly talking to herself, promising that she would be all right and her baby would be fine.  The paramedics conferred among themselves, then decided to give Stacy the truth: she had miscarried; her baby was dead.  \n\n\nStacy had an instant meltdown and became hysterical, screeching over and over that \"this is Rex's baby!\"  As she babbled about how the baby was a testament to her and Rex's \"true love,\" the paramedics suggested they take her to the hospital and call the baby's father.  Thinking fast, Stacy vehemently refused.  She promised to go to the hospital in the morning, and ordered the men to leave her alone.  The paramedics assured Stacy that she and Rex could try again, but as they left, Stacy could only weep inconsolably.\n\n\nBack at the Palace Hotel, Bo headed for the bar, where he ran into Greg, who was on the phone with a colleague discussing Matthew's surgery.  As Greg turned to Bo, a tense conversation ensued.  Bo needled Greg about the inherent risks in the procedure Greg wanted Bo and Nora to sign off on for Matthew, and reacted badly when Greg inadvertently referred to Nora as \"your wife.\"  Bo snapped that Nora was his ex-wife, and stormed off.\n\n\nIn the ballroom, the newlyweds cut their wedding cake.  At their table, Destiny gleefully bossed Shaun around with her bouquet, and asked him where Rachel had disappeared to.  Shaun admitted that he was wondering the same thing.  As Destiny took a seat beside Matthew, he asked her if the bouquet meant she was going to marry soon.  Destiny admitted that she wanted to marry someday.\n\n\nAt the bar, Rachel walked up just in time to see Bo leave, and asked Greg what their argument had had been about.  Greg said they continued to disagree about Matthew's treatment, and mentioned how touchy Bo had gotten about Nora.  Rachel allowed that Bo was going through a hard time.  Greg quickly turned on the charm, commenting on how good Rachel looked for a bridesmaid.  \"I'm surprised Shaun let you out of his sight,\" he purred. \"Some other guy might scoop you up.\"\n\n\nBrushing off his overtures, Rachel ordered a glass of wine.  Greg said he thought she didn't drink; Rachel said she didn't, but was trying to test her control by having the glass and not drinking it.  Greg realized Rachel was a recovering addict, and told her that explained why she kept all her fire and passion bottled up inside; she was afraid of letting go, and what might happen.  He suggested that was why she was dating Shaun, a nice, safe guy who would never make her lose control.  Ruffled by Greg's taunts, Rachel threw her drink in his face.  As Shaun walked in with cake for Rachel, Greg played off his soggy condition, smirking at the seething Ms. Gannon.\n\n\nBack in the ballroom, Viki took a seat beside a melancholy Blair, who apologized for crashing the wedding with Dorian.  Viki asked Blair why she'd made a fool of herself over Todd, and Blair said she didn't know, but refused to consider the possibility that she wasn't over her ex.  As Charlie arrived to take his bride away, Blair congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Banks, and assured them she'd find her own way home.\n\n\nOn an empty city rooftop, Todd led T\ufffda up a staircase with her eyes closed.  When she opened them, she found herself on the roof surrounded by candles, with a microphone stand nearby.  Filled with trepidation, T\ufffda asked Todd if he was going to sing.  \"I'm not singing, he is!\" Todd said, cueing Latin musician Frankie Negron to walk in.  T\ufffda freaked out as one of her favorite singers greeted her.  Todd said he'd given Frankie's favorite charity a donation and asked him to go there to sing for her.  Frankie told T\ufffda that Todd had explained the story of their complicated relationship, and wanted to apologize to her using music.  With that, Frankie and his band tuned up and began to perform.\n\n\nViki and Charlie walked through the night and arrived at the darkened Buenos Dias Cafe for a private evening together.  As they entered, Viki reminisced about her past in Paris, Texas, and how she'd met Charlie and her other friends from the Bon Jour.  Viki discovered that Moe and Noelle had left them a fresh pie before their trip out of town.  Embracing Charlie, Viki told him how glad she was she'd run away to become a waitress.  \"Me too,\" Charlie replied, and kissed her.\n\n\nFrankie Negron performed \"Holding On To Love\" as Todd and T\ufffda listened, hand in hand, and a montage of scenes played out across Llanview.  At the Palace bar, Blair drowned her sorrows, while Rachel and Greg traded glares as Shaun led her away.  At the loft, Stacy wept in her bed and clutched Rex's picture, while at the carriage house, Rex led Gigi upstairs.  At the Buenos Dias, Charlie took \"Mrs. Banks's\" hand for a private candlelit dance, and in the Palace ballroom, a conflicted Nora stared at her wedding ring.  Just then, Clint slid up behind her, asking \"Mrs. Buchanan\" she'd saved her last dance for him.  As Clint and Nora danced alone in the empty ballroom, Nora spotted Bo over Clint's shoulder, standing in the darkness.  They shared a silent, anguished moment before Bo walked away without a word.  As Frankie Negron finished singing on the rooftop, Todd and T\ufffda kissed. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "At the Buchanan-Banks wedding reception, Bo rails at Greg about trying to convince Matthew to have surgery without his permission. Greg protests that Clint brought him here. Bo tells him Matthew is his son, not Clint's. Rachel enters as Bo is leaving and demands to know what Greg said to him. He tells her Bo became angry when Greg accidentally referred to Nora as Bo's wife. Rachel orders a glass of wine and explains that she sometimes orders one to prove to herself that she doesn't have to drink it. Greg surmises that Rachel must always stay in control, and that is why she is dating someone safe like Shawn. She throws her wine in his face. Brody tells Jessica that he thinks her recent preoccupation with Nash means that she is not yet ready to be in another relationship. Blair insinuates herself into Todd and Tea's date. Todd tells Blair he does not want her, and passionately kisses Tea in front of Blair. After the reception, Todd surprised Tea with a private performance by her favorite entertainer Frankie Negron. Gigi admits to Rex that instead of going to Viki's wedding, she tried to talk Stacy into getting an abortion, but she refused. She tells him she wishes there was no baby. Rex explains that he does not want to have anything to do with Stacy, but he cannot abandon the baby. Meanwhile at Rex's loft, Stacy suffers a miscarriage.",
