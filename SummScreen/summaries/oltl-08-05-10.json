He managed to answer one of the phones himself and asked one of the seated police officers the whereabouts of Rita, the receptionist. Learning she had called out, Bo finished with the phone call and spotted Inez, who asked to see Bo's boss.\n\n\nInez wanted to apply for the advertised position of assistant to the police commissioner. She thought that Bo had been kind to offer her some help when they met previously, and since then, Nate had the experience of staying at both an expensive hotel with friends and a shelter with his mother. She was desperate to do something and wanted to make a good impression. She wanted Bo's opinion of the commissioner.\n\n\nBo noted that the commissioner was \"tough but fair\" and a \"good guy.\" He would understand that Inez hadn't been involved in any \"criminal enterprise\" as she feared he might believe. Bo suggested that Inez wait in the office and he followed her inside. Bo took a seat at the desk, and he asked to see her application. Inez was worried that Bo would get into trouble, but he pointed to his nameplate on the desk. An embarrassed Inez wanted to leave, deeming the interview to be over. Bo wanted to continue, and she reluctantly handed him her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She noted that she had lots of administrative experience.\n\n\nBo explained that the office was \"organized chaos\" with a great deal of pressure, and he compared it to a circus. Inez felt that she was quite capable of dealing with the pressure, since she had a teenage son. Bo was quite impressed with Inez's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and skills, and he hired her on the spot. She accepted on the condition that it wasn't charity. Bo felt she was more than qualified, and she agreed to start right away. Bo insisted she call him by his first name. Inez thought her luck was about to change.\n\n\nCristian and Layla returned from their trip to Maryland with heavy hearts and a box filled with some of Evangeline's mementos. \"It looks the same,\" Layla remarked as she glanced around their apartment. She thought it might have looked different, since she no longer had a sister. Cristian assured Layla that she still had her memories. He offered to help Layla go through the box, but Layla suspected it would take her awhile to get to it. She suggested that Cristian go to the diner to tell his mom about Evangeline's death.\n\n\nCole returned home and explained to Starr that the nuns were clueless on any details regarding Hannah's attempted suicide. It was apparent that only Hannah would be able to explain. Starr indicated that Hannah would do anything to keep Cole in her life, and things were no different than they were from the previous time. Cole reminded Starr that Hannah had no idea that he had planned to stop by, and she had almost died. Starr felt remorseful and admitted that she was a bad person to say that, but Cole understood. He knew it was difficult to forget everything that Hannah had done to them in the past. After all that had happened to them, Cole thought it was a good idea for them to be totally honest with each other.\n\n\nStarr revealed that she had to tell Cole about herself and James. Cole frowned as Starr plunged ahead and admitted that James had kissed her. Cole was angry, even though Starr assured him it hadn't meant anything. She explained how they had been trying to hide from a private investigator. Hesitating, she continued that there had actually been two kisses, and she willingly went along with it after the first time. \"Did you enjoy it?\" Cole asked.\n\n\nAn angry Starr reminded Cole that she had just explained that it didn't mean anything, and they were just trying to be safe. Cole was instantly apologetic, but he didn't like the idea of her kissing anyone else. Starr was able to identify with that, since she recalled that she had reacted the identical way after she heard about Cole and Hannah. She grew upset again, but Cole spoke quietly. He pointed out that they loved each other, and it all proved that neither one of them could be with anyone else. Starr agreed not to let Hannah be an issue, and Cole was of the same mindset regarding James. He was just glad that James would be returning to his former home, so Cole would never have to see him again.\n\n\nReluctantly, Starr admitted that James was out of the hospital, but would live with Ford, since their father was in jail. He had wanted her to be prepared in case they ran into each other, and he had called her while Cole was with Hannah. A jealous Cole seemed to think that James planned on staying not only because of Ford, but because of Starr. He was certain that James was interested in Starr. James wasn't into her, Starr assured him, and even if it were true, she didn't think it was any different than Hannah being into Cole. He decided Starr was right, and they had their long-awaited reunion.\n\n\nTodd explained that he had called Greg to the house to examine T\u00e9a after her memory loss, but T\u00e9a promised that she had the problem because she forgot to take her medication. Todd insisted on remaining while Greg spoke to T\u00e9a, but T\u00e9a suggested her husband head to the diner, since Dani would be waiting for them. She would follow as soon as she could. Once Todd was gone, Greg insisted that T\u00e9a tell him the truth. He was sure that she hadn't forgotten her medication, and he believed it wasn't the first time she had lost her memory.\n\n\nT\u00e9a admitted Greg was right, and she had suffered some memory loss during even the most mundane chores. She wondered how long it would be before she would forget how to write her own name. Greg put a name to T\u00e9a's latest symptom and told her she suffered from cognitive decline. He explained that the tumor prevented the brain from processing information, and things would get worse.\n\n\nSadly, he informed her that she only had a few weeks left to live, not months as she had thought. Greg described what T\u00e9a had to look forward to in the way of further symptoms. She would have hearing and vision problems, weakness on one side of her body, and difficulty speaking. She would also have the inability to recognize people and everyday objects. \"Not even my own daughter?\" T\u00e9a asked in disbelief.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Dani showed Nate the cell phone photos of Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding. He noticed that Dani looked down, and Dani disclosed that she thought she had already lost her mother. She told Nate about her mother's temporary amnesia. She went on to tell him about the wedding, and Carlotta overheard the news. Carlotta exclaimed that she wanted to give T\u00e9a a shower, but turning to Nate, she suggested he take care of the diner's deliveries. Nate didn't want to lose his job after only one day, and he hastened back to work.\n\n\nCarlotta sat with Dani and admired the wedding photos. She admitted that she wasn't a fan of Todd's, and Dani admitted that she hadn't been, but was feeling different of late. Just then, Cristian walked in, and Carlotta shared the wedding news. Cristian wanted to speak to his mother privately, and she rose to talk to him. Cristian shared the news about Evangeline and the fact that she had been taken off of life support. Just then, Todd walked in and overheard part of the conversation. He lost his temper and accused Cristian of  \"giving up\" on Evangeline. Todd demanded to know what kind of person would do that.\n\n\nAs Todd grew increasingly agitated, Dani jumped up from her booth and tried to calm her father down. Todd was beside himself as he muttered that Evangeline couldn't be gone because he couldn't lose someone else. Dani asked about Evangeline, and Todd told her she had been a good friend and lawyer who helped him much the way T\u00e9a did. He confided that he had summoned Greg to the house to see T\u00e9a. The pair grew more anxious as time passed, and when T\u00e9a didn't show up, they decided to return home.\n\n\nHanging out in the apartment he shared with his brother, James was hungry and picked up a pizza menu. Ford grabbed it out of James' hands and crumbled it up, declaring that he no longer ordered from that particular restaurant. He picked up another menu instead. Shortly after, he advised James that he had to pick up the rest of his belongings at his old place elsewhere in the building. After he was gone, Nate arrived with the take-out order delivery.\n\n\nThere was some tension as James scrounged around for some money, but as the young men attempted some conversation, the tension seemed to dissipate. James told Nate that Inez had taken the money that Nate had given her, and turned it into a good deed when she paid James's hospital bill. Nate admitted that his mother fixed problems, and James confessed that he couldn't imagine anyone like that. He admitted that he didn't blame Nate for the series of events, even though Ford did. James compared himself to Nate, noting that they had both taken money. \"We're the same, bro,\" James announced, just as Ford returned.\n\n\nIncensed, Ford yelled that he told her not to say anything. \"Told who not to say what?\" a confused James asked him. Ford demanded to hear what Inez had told Nate, and Nate replied that she mentioned that Ford had a problem with her, but not with Nate. Ford was angry, since he had given Inez instructions. Nate retorted that she had only wanted to return the money to James.\n\n\nFord was surprised to hear that Inez hadn't said more than that, but he knew that he didn't want anything to do with a woman who had raised a \"punk\" like Nate. \"You know nothing about my mother,\" Nate yelled. He shared that she had worked hard every day to give him everything he needed, and he wouldn't allow Ford to \"trash her\" like he did. He stormed out.\n\n\nJames was disappointed because he thought that Nate was a \"good kid.\" Ford was infuriated and ordered his brother to stay away from Nate. James was also angry because his brother wanted him to stay away from everyone he met in Llanview. People like Starr, Eli, and James. Ford assured James he would meet new people, and Ford insisted he was only looking out for his brother.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was positive that she didn't want her family to see her grow worse, though Greg assured her that her loved ones would be able to handle it. T\u00e9a wondered if Greg would be able to get through the same situation if it happened to someone he loved, and he admitted he couldn't imagine it. He offered T\u00e9a an alternative, and T\u00e9a advised him she would think about it. He left and, shortly after, Todd and Dani arrived. T\u00e9a had some news for them.\n\n\nLayla continued to go through her sister's items and noticed that Bennett Thompson had helped Evangeline to prepare her living will. Cristian returned home and found Layla going through the box. She admitted it was slow going. Cristian suggested that Layla put the box away, and Layla confirmed that Ford had given her the same advice when he stopped by to get his things. Layla thought that Ford had changed, and he had actually been kind to her. She noted that death produced another side of people.\n\n\nAs the pair enjoyed their meal courtesy of Carlotta, Cristian noted that his mother believed food was the answer to everything. Layla confessed that the box made her realize that her sister was really gone. Cristian assured her he would be there to help her go through it when she was ready. As the couple talked, they didn't notice several papers fall to the floor. A mug shot of Eli lay half hidden in the pile.\n\n\nInez had a favor to ask of Bo, and she asked him to pretend they'd never met prior to the job interview. Before the \"DWE?\" Bo inquired. He clarified that it stood for Driving while Emotional, and he agreed to honor Inez's request. She didn't want Nate to learn about his brothers, and she didn't want to talk about the son who wanted nothing to do with her.\n\n\nBo confessed that his own son Drew had resented Bo until they got to know each other. Drew hadn't grown up with Bo, but they eventually grew into a real father and son. His photo was on the wall of heroes: those men killed on the job. He hoped Inez would get another chance. He wanted to take her on a tour of the station, and Inez was excited. She agreed that the commissioner was a \"good guy, tough but fair.\" She thanked Bo for helping to keep her secret, but she was horrified when Nate walked in. He asked his mother about the secret.\n\n\nCole knocked on Ford's apartment door and announced that he wanted to speak to Ford.\n\n\nJames paid a visit to a surprised Starr. He had to see her, he said as he smiled.\n\n\n",

But Nate comes in contact with James and with Ford when he makes a delivery of food from Buenos Dias to their new apartment. James asks Ford why he is so suspicious and paranoid of Nate and his mom and so many other people in this town. Greg delivers devastating news to Tea that she only has weeks to live and will suffer brain dementia, lose her vision and hearing and won't remember anything or anybody. She does not know how to tell Todd or Dani. Cristian and Layla return home after turning off Evangeline's life support and have a lot of her stuff including a paper trail of her dealings with Bennett Thompson aka Elijah Clark.
