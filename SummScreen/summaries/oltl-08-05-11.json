Dani acknowledged that Matthew would be with Destiny, if he could, while Shaun regretted that Destiny would have to deal with the pregnancy alone.  Dani reminded Shaun that Destiny had Shaun, Dani, and Destiny's family for support.  Dr. Wright walked out and announced that Destiny had asked to see Dani only.\n\n\nAfter Shaun yelled that he also wanted to see Destiny, Vivian insisted that Destiny would talk to him later.  The doctor stated that her main goal was to make Destiny comfortable with her pregnancy.  When Destiny walked out and stated that she just needed Dani, Shaun asked if Destiny thought that Shaun would embarrass her.  Shaun pleaded with Destiny to include him, and to let him be a part of her pregnancy.  Destiny allowed Shaun to enter her room with Dani and Dr. Wright.\n\n\nVivian announced that Destiny's pregnancy was normal, although it was also unexpected and advanced.  Dr. Wright warned that if the pregnancy were to be terminated, it would have to be done quickly.  When Shaun asked Destiny if she would terminate the pregnancy, Destiny replied that she did not know.  After Shaun requested to know about other options, Vivian stated that Destiny could also place the baby up for adoption, or raise the baby herself.  Destiny joked that she preferred the option to travel back in time to undo her condition.\n\n\nShaun noted that if Matthew were not already in a Philadelphia rehab, Shaun would kick Matthew's rear.  Dr. Wright asked the girls to leave, and as she handed Shaun a bag, Vivian requested that Shaun breathe into it.  Shaun exclaimed that he just wanted what was best for Destiny, and Vivian reminded Shaun that Destiny would be fine, because she was a bright, ambitious, and talented young lady.  Vivian added that Destiny had Dani and Shaun, and that Shaun would be there for Destiny, just as Vivian would be there for Shaun.  Dr. Wright hugged Shaun.\n\n\nIn the lobby, once Destiny feared that she would make the wrong decision, Dani said that they should discuss Destiny's options.  When Dani asked about adoption, Destiny worried that her baby would never know her mother, just as Destiny had not.  Destiny believed that the easiest decision would be to keep the baby, but Dani reminded her that Starr had been lucky, because her family had the money and the time to give to Hope.  Dani reflected that Starr had given up a lot for Hope also.\n\n\nDestiny realized that she had already made her decision, and Dani asked if Destiny was sure it was what she wanted.  Destiny claimed that it was the best decision, and that she just had to tell Shaun.  Back in the hospital room, Shaun wondered what a beautiful, brilliant woman like Vivian was doing with a guy like him.  Vivian responded that she was very lucky, just as Destiny and Dani entered the room.  Destiny announced that she had made up her mind, and that she had decided what she would do.\n\n\nIn the park, Blair accepted that she finally knew the truth from Tomas, but she still wanted to know which Todd was the father of her children.  Blair indicated to Tomas that they needed to find out what had happened before the prior eight years, when Todd had first met Baker.  Tomas remarked that only Todd knew what had happened at that time.  Blair realized that Baker had ordered Tomas to kill Todd at the time, and that they needed to talk to Todd.\n\n\nBlair maintained that she had to know who the man with the scar was and reminded Tomas that the Todd Manning in her first wedding was the love of her life.  Tomas voiced that Dorian had warned him that Blair had a habit of always gravitating back to Todd.  Tomas hoped that he had broken that cycle.\n\n\nAt the Manning estate, Jack declared that Todd was his father, even if Starr did not believe it.  When T\u00e9a asked if Starr had admitted that she did not believe it, Jack said that Starr had only said some crazy things about how Todd had changed, since her dad had altered his original face.  Todd was relieved that Jack believed him and then asked T\u00e9a where she stood.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a did not answer quickly enough, Todd asked if a cat had gotten her tongue and remarked that Dani should join them.  T\u00e9a revealed that Dani had needed to attend an important appointment and then remembered about the DNA sample that John had recovered for the tests.  When Todd asked if it had been illegal for John to get the sample, T\u00e9a wanted to know why it mattered.\n\n\nTodd stressed that he was not afraid of the test results, because he was who he said he was.  Todd insisted that he would talk to John, but T\u00e9a said that she would leave to question John, as she kissed Todd on the cheek.  After T\u00e9a left, Jack said that the test would prove that Todd was his dad and then admitted that he did not even remember his father's original face.  Todd exclaimed that he loved Jack, as Blair and Tomas walked in.\n\n\nTodd demanded that Tomas leave his house, or he would arrest Tomas for trespassing.  Once Jack left the room, Blair declared that Todd could not kick Tomas out, however, Todd reflected that Tomas had just accused him of being an imposter.  Blair explained that Tomas had said he was sorry.  Blair then questioned Todd on what had happened to him in the mausoleum, after Mitch Laurence had beaten him and left him there to die. When Todd seemed confused, Blair asked him how he had gotten out of the crypt.\n\n\nIn John's office at the police station, John showed Viki a packet that contained the DNA test documentation, and Viki almost feared to know the results.  Viki believed that if the man with the scar was the real Todd Manning, that would mean that \"Todd\" was an imposter.  Viki noted that the man with the scar had known too much, and that he had remembered about the ceremony.  Viki pointed out that the man had stated that Viki was the one person above all others, and anyone else, that he could trust.\n\n\nViki exclaimed that would mean that she had betrayed her brother by being loving and loyal to an imposter, which would stab her in the heart.  When John wondered how Viki could maintain being loyal to someone like Todd for all those years, Viki acknowledged that it had not always been easy.  Viki remembered Marty's rape, when Todd had let Kevin take the blame, but then Viki had discovered that Todd was her brother.\n\n\nViki explained that she and Todd had both been damaged by their father, Victor Lord, but John pointed out that Viki was not a sociopath.  Viki cried, \"I know.  He's a rapist.  He's a child.  He's a liar.  He's a monster sometimes.  He's also just a human being, and he is capable of great love and remorse and...and acts of kindness and courage that are completely unexpected.  But more than anything, he loves his family.\"\n\n\nJohn claimed that Todd had excuses, and that when Todd's family was in trouble, he would try to save them, but that was after he had put them in danger himself.  Viki realized that also but stated that Todd was a child, who was hurt and damaged and fractured, and that she would always love him.  John reminded Viki that Gigi had been her friend, and that Todd had paid to cover up Jack's part in Gigi's death.  When John asked if Viki could ignore that, Viki replied that she could not turn her back on her brother.\n\n\nJohn announced that it was time to find out the truth.  Just as Viki exclaimed that she wanted the answers, T\u00e9a ran in and demanded that John not open the packet.  T\u00e9a declared that John had used an illegal search to get access to the toothbrush on Todd's desk, but John explained that he had used probable cause due to Jack's case.  John asked T\u00e9a if she wanted to know who her husband was and then stressed that Viki needed answers.  T\u00e9a agreed, and when she asked how they should proceed, John indicated that he had an idea.\n\n\nAt the jail, Starr visited the man with the scar, who had Todd's original face, and demanded to know what else he knew about her family.  As Starr pulled out a sheet of paper with questions, she explained that she still was not convinced.  Starr's first question was how she and her dad communicated to each other, when she was a little girl, and when he was away.  The man with the scar answered correctly that they communicated through a stuffed frog named Fred the Magic Frog.\n\n\nWhen Starr asked what her first snake was, the man replied that she had owned a boa constrictor named Barney, who had eaten white mice for lunch.  After Starr questioned what her favorite spider was, the man explained that tarantulas were not really spiders, because a spider's fangs moved in an axis, while a tarantula's fangs were fixed.  The man continued with the answer, black widow, because they ate their mates.\n\n\nThe man provided the correct answers, Reptile Round-up, for Starr's favorite place, and taxi for her favorite mode of transportation, especially when she was grounded.  The man stated that Starr's favorite arch-nemesis had been Max Holden, and that she had once put piranhas in his bathtub.  Starr had even bought horse poop with a credit card that she had stolen from Max.  When Starr had once battled Asa Buchanan, her choice of weapon had been Silly String.  Starr then cried out that the man with the scar had cheated, because all of those answers had been in the book, Todd Manning: the Unauthorized Biography.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face asked to see the book and insisted that he had remembered everything, because it had been his life.  The man claimed that he could remember every moment, because it had been all he had left to hang onto for eight years.  Starr cried that her father would never have stayed away from her for that long, and that the man with the scar was cruel for what he was doing.  Starr dropped a stuffed frog, and when the man with the scar handed it back to her, she stated that it belonged to her daughter, Hope.\n\n\nThe man with the scar was stunned to learn that Starr had a daughter, because news traveled slowly to remote top-secret paramilitary outposts.  Starr explained that she had become pregnant when she was 16, and that Hope was the best thing that had ever happened to her.  The man related with Starr and said that he knew how she felt.  The man then said, \"Can I...can I ask you something?  Who was the lowlife that knocked you up?\"\n\n\nStarr exclaimed that Hope's father was not a lowlife, and that he had been her first love.  The man with the scar asked about him and wanted to know if he had ever heard of a condom.  Starr revealed that his name was Cole, and that he was the son of Patrick and Marty Thornhart.  When the man pondered that he had a granddaughter by Marty's son, Starr screamed that her dad was Hope's grandfather, not the man with the scar.\n\n\nThe man with Todd's original face requested to see a picture of Hope, and Starr showed him a photo on her phone.  The man broke into tears and sniffled that Hope had Starr's smile.  The man cried, \"The first time I ever held you, Viki put you in my arms, and you smiled...like this.  It was the first time in my life that the sun came out.  Thank you, my little Starr.\"  John walked into the jail and asked for the guard to release the man.  John told Starr and the man with the scar to follow him.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a and Viki arrived outside of the Manning estate, T\u00e9a stated that she was terrified, and Viki said, \"That makes two of us.\"  Inside the mansion, Todd yelled that he did not owe Blair and Tomas an explanation.  Once Todd saw T\u00e9a, he asked if T\u00e9a had been able to have the test results squashed.  After Todd saw Viki, he demanded to know why she was there.  Jack ran down the stairs and announced that a cop car was parked in front of the house.\n\n\nAs Starr, the man with a scar, and John walked into the mansion, T\u00e9a declared, \"We agreed that this was the best way to do this.\"  Blair cried out, \"What...what...what is...what is this all about?\"  Outraged at seeing the man with the scar, Todd yelled, \"Would someone like to tell me what is going on?  What's he doing here?\"  T\u00e9a announced, \"We are now going to hear the results of the DNA test.\"  John responded, \"Time to find out who the real Todd Manning is.\"  Todd looked on, as the man with the scar glanced at John. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody is awaiting the answer about who is the real Todd Manning. Starr goes to visit original Todd in the jail cell with a list of questions that only her father could answer. He knows all the answers but she suspects that this man \"did his homework\" and that is why he knows things that her real father may not remember from the distant past. Viki informs John that the man in question (original Todd) knows and remembers things about their relationship and history that an imposter could not know or fake. Dani accompanies destiny and Shaun to the Ob-Gyn clinic where Vivian confirms that Destiny is pregnant and explores the options. Yet nobody likes to face the fact that she can either abort, give her baby up for adoption or raise a baby as a teenager. And they remark that Matthew is not \"there\" for her.",
