    "tvmega_recap": "John and Talia bust into Rex's home when they discover that he must know something about Spencer's death. They take his computer down to the station for evidence, knowing that Rex knows something he is not admitting. And John is able to discover that Rex has a copy of Todd Manning's deceased kid's death certificate. He wonders why that would be. Sara is scrounging for money and is hoping that Asa or Clint will override her father's decision to cut her off. The only job she wants to do is book bands at Capricorn and that job is not available to her. Cristian and Antonio take the day off and leave the bar empty. And when Sara arrives, Hunter finds her. Dorian tells Viki she better find a way for David to get his money back. And she believes that Viki wants to keep her away from Clint. Natalie is acting very friendly and supportive to Miles, defending him to everybody who speaks and thinks ill of him. And it seems she has some \"issue\" of her own in regard to his unrequited feelings for Marty.",
