    "soap_central": "\nJumpin' Jehosophat!\n\n\nThe Mendorran escapees were thrilled when Cristian took Sarah aboard the plane. Tina embraced her daughter, who was bedraggled and dirty but seemed otherwise fine. While the others were distracted, Cain furtively examined the Mendorran crown jewels, which he had pocketed for himself. Sarah explained to Cristian and Tina how she had survived the plunge from the falls; she said she had been swept far downriver, where Cristian had been unable to reach her, and that she had woken up on the shore, presumably after the boat had split apart on the rocks.\n\n\nSarah said she'd just started walking through the woods, eventually ending up near Mendorra City, where she'd heard cheering. When she arrived in the village square, she had seen chaos amongst the crowds, and when she'd heard people mention \"the airstrip,\" she had followed them there. Cristian and Tina were overjoyed that Sarah had survived, but Sarah asked, \"Where's Talia?\" Antonio told her the sad news: they'd had to leave Talia behind. Alone with Cristian, Antonio vowed to get Talia back.\n\n\nAt Viki's going-away bash at Llanfair, Dorian was an unwelcome party-crasher. Tess snapped, calling Dorian a \"bitch\" and saying she had no right to be there after helping to put Nash in the ground. Dorian tried to defend herself, saying she had only revealed Jared's fraud against Buchanan Enterprises; Nora countered that Dorian had capitalized on it for her own gain. Todd asked Viki if he could throw Dorian out, but Dorian told Todd she was there to see him and that she blamed him for Cole breaking up with Starr.\n\n\nNora said it wasn't the time or place for them to argue, and Viki used her best polite voice to ask Dorian to please leave. She explained that she was off to Africa as a goodwill ambassador and that, while she would always appreciate that Dorian had saved her life, she could not forget what Dorian had done to Buchanan Enterprises, to Nash, and \"probably to Charlie.\" Viki said that Dorian should expect some retribution. Dorian scoffed, asking if one of Viki's \"spare personalities\" would rebuild the secret room and lock her up again -- an idea that visibly intrigued Tess.\n\n\nAfter Dorian stalked off, Viki said her goodbyes to everyone, asking Nora and Clint to watch over Jessica, and Todd to make amends with Blair. She then hugged Natalie, pointedly asking Jared to look after her. Over her mother's worried protests about \"Jessica,\" Tess \"lovingly\" urged Viki to go and get on with her good deeds, hustling her out of the drawing room and throwing the doors shut behind her.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Blair blustered past Keys, the bodyguard, asking to see \"the lady of the house.\" Keys insisted there was no lady, but Blair showed him the nightgown she'd found in Todd's bag and asked who it was for. Keys remained silent, but when Blair began to sweet-talk him in the hopes of getting to the truth, Keys turned lustful and flirtatious, asking if Blair would put on the nightgown for him in order to get upstairs and find Todd's mystery woman.\n\n\nBack in 1968, Jeremiah lent Bo his copy of Mysteries of Time by renowned professor Del Fina. Bo seemed skeptical about the metaphysics involved but was prepared to try anything to get back to 2008. Meanwhile, Rex tried again to reach Gigi by cell phone. At the same time, in the present day, Gigi and Brody settled in for their shifts at Rodi's. Gigi handed Brody her purse to put behind the counter, and after she walked away, her cell phone rang. When Brody picked it up, he saw that Rex was calling and hesitated; before he could answer it, Rex lost the signal in 1968.\n\n\nJeremiah suggested to Rex and Bo that the phone was the \"conduit\" through the \"gateway\" of time that would allow them to reach 2008, but Rex was frustrated, having almost drained his phone's battery and desperately in need of a charger. Jeremiah warned Bo that he could not change history and destabilize the timeline, but Bo feared that he already had by ending Asa's relationship with Emma Bradley, endangering David Vickers' future existence.\n\n\nRex gave the phone another try, and Brody did pick up but refused to let Rex talk to Gigi, even though Rex insisted it was a matter of life and death. Brody lied that Gigi was in the shower and that he was about to get in with her, telling Rex that he was living in the past. \"That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you!\" Rex yelled. Brody told Rex to stay there, and hung up, deleting all of Rex's recent calls as he did so.\n\n\nRex was furious that Brody had hung up on him, and Bo tried to reassure him, saying that Brody could've been lying. Jeremiah pressured Bo and Rex to make sure history was righted and that David Vickers was conceived; otherwise, he said, they'd have no way to get home. Bo told Rex that in order to save their lives, he would have to, as Asa, go to the hotel across the street and \"put the spurs\" to Emma Bradley; he told Rex not to think of her as Gigi, who Rex would be home with soon.\n\n\nRex reluctantly agreed and watched as Bo left the caf\u00e9. As he watched, he toyed with Jeremiah's book and then made the connection between Dr. Del Fina and Madame Delphina, who bore a striking resemblance to each other. \"Jumpin' Jehosophat! Delphina!\" he said.\n\n\nGigi was dismayed to realize that her first customer at her new job was Layla, Adriana's \"BFF.\" The ladies exchanged some barbs about Adriana, who Layla said was in Paris and dying to return home to her husband. Gigi hurried off to get Layla some water, while Layla waited for Vincent, her date. When Vincent arrived, Layla was irritated, complaining that he'd had no time for her lately. Vincent claimed he was just busy trying to \"make money\" and provide for his lady love, but his excuses blew up in his face when another attractive young woman approached the table, having overheard Layla and Vincent's argument.\n\n\nThe young woman said that \"Vinnie\" couldn't be Layla's boyfriend, because he was already hers. When the young woman threw a drink in Vincent's face, he was forced to admit to Layla that it was true: he'd been stepping out with both women. Vincent said Layla had been too unavailable, visiting with Evangeline at the hospital in Baltimore and jetting across the country with Adriana and Dorian earlier in the year, and that he'd needed more of her attention.\n\n\nBoth Layla and Vincent's \"other woman\" were disgusted by his excuses, and the weeping Layla told Vincent that they were over, and she'd leave his things on the front stoop. \"Look for the bonfire,\" she said. Vincent tried to put the moves on Layla, but Brody stepped in front of her and told him to get out. Shamed, Vincent slunk away into the night, while Gigi tried to comfort the crying Layla.\n\n\nOn the royal jet, Tina fussed over Sarah and said they'd have a hospital check her over as soon as they landed. Sarah was puzzled but delighted that Tina was finally acting like a mom, and the estranged mother and daughter shared a hug. Out of the corner of her eye, Sarah spotted Cain rummaging in his pocket and snatched the crown jewels from his hands. Tina was stunned to realize that the jewels were what Cain had gone back to the palace for, and Cain claimed he'd taken them \"for us.\" Sarah challenged him, saying that if that were true, he wouldn't have hidden them from the others.\n\n\nTina flashed back to a moment from the recent past, in which she herself had replaced the stones in the crown jewels with fakes, sure that \"Cain [would] never know the difference.\" Having remembered that, she let Cain get away with his excuses.\n\n\nWhile Cristian and Sarah tried to keep Antonio's spirits up about rescuing Talia, Cain disappeared into the cockpit and returned decked out in full skydiving gear. Tina and Sarah were shocked as Cain told them he was diving out of the plane and escaping with \"the jewels.\" He told Tina he was sorry, but the jewels were first, and he knew she was still hung up on Cord. Before the party's astonished eyes, Cain leaped from the plane, screaming, \"Geronimo!\"\n\n\nSarah tried to console her mother, but Tina didn't seem too broken up about losing Cain. She said she didn't need a man but rather a companion, like her beloved dog, David Vickers, and that when she got back to Llanview, she would make finding him her first priority.\n\n\nAt the Llanview airport, the dynamite tag team of David Vickers and David Vickers were ready to board a plane out of town. The human David was particularly anxious to find greener pastures before he could be nailed for the accidental fire that had burned down Carlotta's diner. He talked incessantly to \"Princess David Vickers\" to soothe his nerves, worrying about their lack of funds for whenever they got to wherever they were going. Just then, David spotted a travel poster, which read, \"Picture Yourself At St. Blaze's.\" To his horror, he once again could not see his reflection in the glass.\n\n\n\"I know people say I'm transparent, but I never took them literally!\" David moaned. He chose to blame \"Princess David Vickers\" for his malady and told his furry counterpart that they had to say their goodbyes. When he spotted a group of nuns with a donation booth, he realized how he was going to offload the dog. \"If it's good enough for Todd's baby, it's good enough for mine,\" David said as he \"donated\" Princess David Vickers to the befuddled nuns.\n\n\nReady to board his plane, David ran smack into Viki. The two friends compared notes about Addie and Charlie, and David told Viki he was headed back to L.A. to give fame and fortune another shot. Viki kindly rejected an offer to give their own \"passionate love affair\" another try, and David gave her a hug, pleased to see his own reflection again in the mirror behind them. With that, he left Llanview once more, just missing the arriving Tina in the terminal behind him.\n\n\nBlair reluctantly modeled the nightgown for the lascivious Keys and asked if she could go upstairs yet. Just then, Todd walked in.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie saw Nora and Clint off and thanked them for stopping by, and Clint admitted he still loved Natalie despite everything that had happened. Tess said goodbye to Clint and Nora then ushered Jared and Natalie off to bed, smirking as she heard Jared asking Natalie about the secret room.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi praised Brody for his chivalry toward Layla, calling him Shane's \"superhero.\" Brody took the compliment, guilt-ridden about ignoring Rex's call. Then Gigi walked up to her next customer: Madame Delphina.\n\n\nAt the airport, Viki awaited her flight and got a text message from Charlie: \"Here's looking at you, kid.\" She was shocked when Sarah, Cristian, and Antonio walked up. They explained that they had been in Mendorra, and when Viki asked why, Cristian said it was because of \"her.\" Viki turned around and saw her long-lost sister, Tina. \"Hi, Sis,\" Tina said meekly. \n\n\n",
