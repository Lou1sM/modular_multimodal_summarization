She was thrilled beyond belief when he got down on bended knee and presented her with a diamond ring. When she suddenly awakened, she recalled the reality of her miscarriage and began to cry.\n\n\nNewlyweds Viki and Charlie awakened and felt blessed that they were finally married after all of the drama that had been a part of their lives. Viki confessed that she had promised to take Bree to the zoo that day, though Charlie thought it was a good time to talk about a honeymoon. They agreed that since there was no crisis for the first time, they'd be able to take off for months if they wanted to. Charlie wished that they had been together all along. Reminiscing, he told Viki that his first wife had become pregnant on their honeymoon. Jokingly, she told him they didn't need to worry about that.\n\n\nHe continued to think back to what a terrible father he had been to Jared. Reassuringly, Viki reminded him that he and Jared were on good terms and that he would be an awesome grandfather. As if on cue, Bree knocked on the door, anxious for her zoo trip. She wanted Charlie to go with them. He and Viki decided that a honeymoon in the Galapagos Islands sounded enchanting.\n\n\nIn their apartment, Cristian stopped short when he overheard a conversation between Layla and Fish. She apologized for asking if Fish was gay, and was happy to hear that he wasn't angry with her. As soon as Fish left for work, Cristian couldn't wait to ask her about Fish, and if that was the reason they had been fighting. Layla was unable to hide her annoyance at Cristian for listening, and assured him that she and Fish had merely had a misunderstanding. Recalling the letter he had taken that had been written from Fish to Kyle, Cristian realized that the two men had been together as a couple.\n\n\nLayla refused to listen to anything that Cristian wanted to tell her, though he insisted that he was trying to keep her from getting hurt. She was annoyed at herself for thinking what she did about Fish, she told him. He had all of the qualities that she was looking for in a man.\n\n\nAt the caf\ufffd, Roxy found Kyle looking for a job in the newspaper, and assured him that he didn't have to pay her rent at the hotel until he was able to. She informed him that the Llanview Police Department was looking for a \"few good men\" but he muttered, \"Don't ask, don't tell.\" Roxy understood what he meant and that Fish was \"hiding in plain sight.\" Kyle explained that Fish always wanted to be a cop and that Fish's parents would not be happy to know the truth about their son.\n\n\nAt a nearby table, John attempted to ease Marty's uneasiness over Cole working undercover. He promised to watch over her son. Starr arrived with the baby as John was leaving. She and Marty talked about Cole and John working together in secret. Marty indicated that she was on her way to obtaining her professional license back. Fish also walked in and Roxy caught his attention. She told him to give Kyle a chance, because the man was crazy about him. As Fish ordered his old friend out to the alley for a private talk, he demanded to know what Kyle had told Roxy.\n\n\nKyle finished the sentence as Fish stumbled over his words, \"...that we were lovers?\" He added that Roxy wouldn't tell anyone and that he still loved Fish. An angry Fish reminded Kyle of the letter he had written, and insisted that he was never gay and their relationship had merely been a college experiment. He added that he was with Layla.\n\n\nBrody handed Cole a stack of marked bills and accepted the bag of drugs from him in return. As Brody departed, he mentioned that John had pulled him from the police academy to help out with the undercover operation and that everyone would assume he was employed at Rodi's. As Cole opened his apartment door, they were surprised to see Asher standing on the other side with an older man. Brody played his role and demanded to know why the men were there. Cole told them that Brody was his best customer.\n\n\n \n\nBrody hastily departed and when Cole asked for the identity of the older man, he was shoved back into the apartment and told not to ask questions. The man proceeded to rip Cole's shirt open, searching for a wire. He demanded to know whom Cole was working for. Cole insisted that John was Brody's boss and that John had pulled Brody from the academy because he was unreliable. Cole contended that he knew John through his mother, but John didn't care about him. He had a felony conviction and no job but had expenses, so he needed to sell drugs. The man opened a briefcase to reveal a gun. He told Cole that he was the boss.\n\n\nInstead of grabbing the gun, he pulled out the instrument next to it and began to scan the apartment for bugs. Not finding any, the man handed Cole additional drugs to sell. Cole advised him that they would not last very long, and was pleased to hear the man say that Cole had made a good start. Cole was anxious to make his way to a higher position. As Asher and his boss left, the man snarled that he would catch Cole if he were lying about anything. \"I sweep for bugs and then I plant one of my own,\" he told Asher. Cole received a call from Starr and he told her it would all be over soon.\n\n\nRex and Gigi talked about how wonderful their night had been together, until Gigi had remembered Stacy and the baby. She offered to head over to the loft to apologize to her sister for suggesting that Stacy have an abortion, but Rex wanted her to stay away. He insisted that he was trying to protect Gigi, and he knew that things wouldn't go well if the sisters confronted each other. He reassured her that while he would be able to make room in his life for the baby, Stacy would not be included. Gigi felt strongly that she and Shane would have to compete for Rex's time and she didn't want to share him, she explained. She pointed out that there were only so many hours in the day.\n\n\nRex promised that Stacy would not get in between them. Gigi made it clear that Stacy would use the baby for that purpose. Rex decided to head over to the loft to set some ground rules with Stacy. He thought it was better to go alone. As soon as he left, Schuyler appeared at the door. He had been waiting until he saw Rex leave, he admitted. Rex had ordered him to stop being friends with Gigi, he divulged. Rolling her eyes, Gigi admitted what she had done to Stacy and that she was stuck with her sister in their lives forever.\n\n\nSchuyler felt certain that Rex would love the baby, not Stacy. Gigi was not certain of that, pointing out that Schuyler had loved Stacy once. He noted that he had been high at the time and he only missed what he thought she was really like. Still angry at Rex for sleeping with her sister, Gigi listened as Schuyler pointed out that Rex was a guy and he thought that he and Gigi were through, and that Gigi had pointed Rex in Stacy's direction. Gigi claimed that Rex had turned his back on her.\n\n\nSchuyler insisted that any man would love to have Gigi, and that Rex knew that. Gigi thought that Schuyler was \"sweet and kind,\" but he admitted that his thoughts were not pure ones. Finally, he leaned over and kissed her.\n\n\nAt the police station, Brody handed the bag of drugs over to John. He also had pictures of the man at Cole's apartment, taken with his phone. After some Internet investigation, the men learned the identity of the man, Sergei Sherbacov. While he was Russian, he apparently had no allegiance to any one group and was with a different one after every arrest. John thought that a bug in Cole's apartment would be helpful.\n\n\nHe explained that there was a bug in the lobby and hallway. He praised Brody for his help in the operation. As Brody left, another officer arrived. He announced that Cole's apartment had been bugged and picked up on their scanner. Layla arrived at work and received a flower delivery from Fish.\n\n\nRex arrived at his loft as Stacy was doubled over with cramps. In response to his questioning, she assured him that she did not have the abortion that Gigi asked her to have. She asserted that their baby was fine and she was only suffering from morning sickness. Rex apologized for what Gigi had done and explained that they were all trying to adjust to the situation. He admitted that he did not want her to have an abortion. He promised that he wouldn't abandon his child or toss Stacy in the streets, pregnant. However, he continued, he loved Gigi and would marry her. Stacy and the baby would not come between them.\n\n\nAt the caf\ufffd, Cristian looked for his mother and thought she might be in the alley. Roxy advised him that Fish and Kyle were having a private conversation there. The two men argued, with Kyle accusing Fish of lying to everyone, including himself. Fish insisted that he liked where he was at. Kyle knew that Fish remembered how things were between them and that they had meant something. He grabbed Fish and kissed him. Fish did not pull away.\n\n\n",
