Ford asked how Cole had located him, and Cole responded that James had made sure to let Starr know where they were living.  Cole told Ford that they actually needed to discuss Hannah, because Ford owed her.  Cole then revealed that Hannah had tried to kill herself, and that if he had not found her in time, Hannah would have died.  Cole questioned how Hannah had obtained the pills, and Ford remembered his conversation with Eli, when Eli had declared, \"Hannah's been dealt with.\"  \n\n\nCole asked to know exactly what had happened the night that Hannah assaulted Ford, since Hannah had never even mentioned Ford's name to Cole, before the night of the attack.  Ford claimed that he had been home asleep, when a noise had awoken him.  Ford added that he had found Hannah standing over him with his award.  \"And I don't even get a chance to ask her why she's there, and she clocks me over the head with it.  End of story.\"  Cole questioned if Hannah had said anything that night, but Ford wondered why Cole was playing detective, since Hannah had tried to break up Cole and Starr.\n\n\nStarr answered the door of her apartment and discovered James, who asked if Cole was around.  Once he determined that Cole was not at home, James insisted that he had something to say to Starr that could not wait.  As Starr let James in, she warned him to keep quiet, so that he would not wake Hope.  James tossed around the bullet that the doctors had removed from him and told Starr that the bullet reminded him of her.  When Starr asked why James had stopped by, he replied that he had been walking and had found himself at her front door.  \"It looks like I can't stay away from you.\"\n\n\nStarr insisted that James leave, but James wanted to know which Starr was throwing him out.  James voiced that there were two Starrs -- the sad, lonely Starr and the passionate Starr that twinkled.  James related that Cole did not even know the passionate Starr that twinkled, and that if Starr were with James, every morning, when he woke up, he would make sure that the sad, lonely Starr \"would never show her face again.\"  Starr insisted that James did not even know Cole or Starr.  James claimed that if Starr stated that she had no doubts about Cole, he would leave.  \"Is there any chance for you and I?\"  Cole walked in the door.\n\n\nJames indicated that he had stopped by the apartment to inform Starr that his dad would not cause her any more problems.  Cole warned James not to stop by again and opened the door for James to exit.  Cole then asked Starr why James was really there.  Starr told Cole that James was interested in her, and that James had said that Starr would be happier with someone else, because she was sad and lonely.  When Cole questioned how she had responded, Starr said that Cole's arrival had stopped her from answering.  Starr stressed that she would have told James that she already had everything that she had ever wanted with Cole.  Starr and Cole kissed.\n\n\nAt the police station, when Eli asked to talk to Nora, Nora replied that she needed to see Bo first, just as Bo's office door closed.  Nora stated, \"Never mind.  He's busy.\"  Nora informed Eli that she was at the police station, because she had learned that Hannah had overdosed.  Faking shock, Eli questioned how that could even be possible, since Hannah was supposed to have been on a 24-hour watch.  \n\n\nWhen Nora commented that there would be an investigation, Eli responded, \"Well, an investigation is not going to bring my client back.\"  Nora realized that Eli had misunderstood and informed him that Hannah had survived the overdose.  Eli asked if Nora was sure that Hannah would be fine, and Nora revealed that the doctors expected Hannah to make s full recovery.  Nora exclaimed, \"And she would have died, too, if Cole Thornhart had not found her.\"\n\n\nWhen Nate delivered a food order to Bo, he asked his mother why she was in Bo's office and demanded to know Inez's secret.  As Bo grabbed his food, Nate questioned if his mother was under arrest.  When Bo and Inez hesitated, Nate yelled, \"Then what's the problem?  And why do you look like you're in trouble?\"  Inez insisted that she was not under arrest, and Bo assessed that Inez might feel like she was under arrest, since she would be working for him.  \n\n\nNate screamed that her new job was good news, as he hugged his mother.  Inez exclaimed that she would be the best assistant that Bo had ever hired, and Nate stressed that there would be no distractions for Inez at home.  Bo remarked, \"Ah, so you're not going to get into any more trouble.  No more shoot-outs.  No...uh, for the record, I can't fix parking tickets, okay?\"  Nate wondered why Inez did not just tell him that Bo had hired her.\n\n\nWhile Bo searched through his food, he was relieved to see that the order contained his chili fries, however, he was disappointed about the absence of salt.  After Bo sent Nate to get the salt, Inez mentioned that she could not lie to Nate about his brothers, and Bo suggested that Inez tell Nate the truth.  Bo understood that Inez was trying to protect Nate and pondered, \"You gotta ask yourself, now if you tell him about this, is that going to hurt Nate...or will it hurt both of you...or could it make you both stronger?\"\n\n\nWhen Nate returned with the salt, Bo told Inez to report to work early the next morning to fill out the necessary paperwork.  Inez indicated to Nate that she had something to show him, and as they left, Nora arrived.  \"Is that Nate's mom?\"  Bo announced that Inez was his new assistant, and Nora blared, \"Is that salt?\"\n\n\nWhen Nora indicated that Inez was \"quite a find,\" Bo thought she meant because Inez was very experienced, but actually, Nora thought that Inez was \"a looker.\"  Once Bo had told Nora of Inez's vast experience, Nora asked for Bo to loan Inez to her.  Bo replied that it would cost Nora.  As Nora sat in Bo's lap for payment, she wondered that Bo had not noticed that Inez was a beautiful woman.  Bo explained, \"Well, she's not half as beautiful as you are.\"  Nora laughed and said, \"So you did notice.\"  Bo and Nora kissed.\n\n\nFord called the hospital for an update on Hannah's condition.  When James arrived, he insisted that his walk had cleared his head, and that he knew what he really wanted.  James just did not know if he would be able to get what he wanted.  Ford answered the knock at the door and found Inez.\n\n\nAt Todd's mansion, T\u00e9a informed Todd and Dani that she was short on time.  \"I have a few weeks...at the most.\"  Dani refused to believe it was true, and T\u00e9a said that Greg had stated that her treatment would no longer help her.  However, Greg had offered one more option, which was a hospice, where the staff could take very good care of T\u00e9a and keep her comfortable.  When Dani asked if T\u00e9a was in any pain, she answered, \"Not much.\"  \n\n\nTodd and Dani both agreed that they were \"on-board\" with the idea, but T\u00e9a related that she wanted to leave that night.  When Todd and Dani suggested that they all pack, T\u00e9a told them that Todd and Dani did not need to pack.  \"Your father and you...umm, you can't come with me.\"  Dani cried and blamed the hospice, but Todd knew that it was T\u00e9a's decision.  T\u00e9a warned Dani, \"When I die, I will not be myself.  Whether or not you guys are there with me, I will die alone.\"  \n\n\nWhen Dani insisted that the doctors did not know anything, T\u00e9a showed them a pamphlet that described her future symptoms.  T\u00e9a cried that she would eventually be blind, and that she would have seemed sane on her wedding day compared the eventual progression of her dementia.  T\u00e9a begged Todd and Dani to remember T\u00e9a as herself.  Dani yelled that she would have worse images in her head, if she and Todd never knew anything about what was going on with her mother.  \"If you go away and leave, this is how I'm going to remember you.  I will never forgive you.\"\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a continued to insist that it was for the best, Dani screamed, \"No, forget it.  Your plan is blown, Mom.  If you try to fly off and leave me and Todd, this is our last memories.\"  Dani declared that T\u00e9a had never wanted her around, which was why T\u00e9a had sent Dani to boarding school.  T\u00e9a insisted that she had only wanted to protect Dani and pleaded with Dani not to fight her.  \n\n\nDani shrieked, \"I'm not fighting you, Mom.  I'm telling you how it is.  If you leave me here today, you don't get some nice goodbye.  This is it.\"  Dani ran upstairs, as T\u00e9a cried out for her.  Sadly, T\u00e9a exclaimed, \"I can't say anything right today.\"  Todd replied, \"No, you can't,\" as he walked past her.\n\n\nSince Dani had locked herself in her room, Todd searched for a key, as he declared that T\u00e9a had shut both of them out.  After T\u00e9a insisted that leaving was the best way, Todd believed that T\u00e9a had never trusted him, and that she felt that he would fail her.  After Todd left the room, the doorbell rang.  T\u00e9a answered the door to Blair, who asked what T\u00e9a needed.\n\n\nIn John's office at the police station, Blair confronted John about his investigation of Eli.  Blair demanded the truth from John and wanted to know if the investigation was Kelly's idea.  John questioned what Kelly had told Blair, and Blair replied, \"That the both of you think that Eli is some mass murderer.\"  When John did not respond, Blair knew that John believed it to be true.\n\n\nJohn observed that Kelly did not last one night, before she had told Blair what they had suspected.  John informed Blair that Kelly had wanted him to investigate Melinda's murder, and Blair wondered when Melinda's death had suddenly been considered a murder.  John remarked, \"When corpses started showing up every time someone asked a question about her.\"  Blair still did not understand how John could possibly consider Eli a serial killer and questioned why Eli would kill people that he did not even know.\n\n\nBlair maintained that Kelly was crazy to believe that any of their suspicions were true, which made John wonder if Blair had said anything to Eli.  Blair stated that since their beliefs were all nonsense, she had not and suggested that John had a vendetta against Eli, because of her.  John explained, \"Blair, listen to me.  Three people are dead...three.  And we have reason to believe that Elijah is involved.  So, my suggestion to you is keep your distance for now.  And don't let him suspect anything.\"  Blair insisted that she was not afraid of Eli, and that she would not let John and Kelly stop her from marrying him.  As Blair started to leave, Layla opened the door and announced that Evangeline had just died.\n\n\nBlair expressed shock, and Layla explained that Evangeline had been hooked up to machines in the hospital to keep her alive, and how she, Cristian, and Lisa were honoring Evangeline's wishes, because they had found her living will.  Blair expressed her sympathy and left.  Layla asked John if she could do anything for him, and John believed that he should have been the one to ask her that.  John invited Layla to sit down and showed her a bottle of wine.  John described the night that he and Evangeline had drunk several bottles of wine and related that he had kept that one bottle, because it reminded him of Evangeline.  He had always hoped to open the bottle and drink it with Evangeline, once she was out of the coma.  \"So, this bottle is for her.  I think it's time for a toast, don't you?\"\n\n\nBlair visited Cristian at his apartment and informed him that she had just learned that Evangeline had died.  As they hugged, Blair's foot stood by Eli's photo that had fallen from Evangeline's box.  Cristian told Blair that it had been tough for Layla and her mother, but that Evangeline had made out a living will, which had helped.  Cristian then announced that he and Layla were engaged, and Blair was happy for them.  Blair indicated to Cristian that she had finally found the right one also, as she caressed her ring.\n\n\nJohn and Layla toasted, and Layla explained that Evangeline had created a living will.  John insisted that Layla \"did right by\" Evangeline.  Layla thanked John and Bennett Thompson, as Eli listened outside the door.  When John asked Layla about Bennett Thompson, Layla revealed that Bennett Thompson had helped Evangeline with her living will, and that Evangeline's box contained a file on Bennett Thompson.  When Layla said that she could call Cristian and have him bring the file to the station, John replied, \"I'd like to see that file.\"\n\n\nWhen Layla called Cristian, he responded, \"Hey, how's it going?\"  Layla answered, \"It's going.  Uh, you remember that box of Evangeline's we brought back from Maryland?\"  Cristian noted, \"Yeah, yeah, it's...it's right here.  I was just about to put it away.\"  \n\n\nLayla asked, \"Can you check it for a file?\"  Cristian asked, \"A file?\" Layla explained, \"It's labeled 'Bennett Thompson.'  I need it at the police station for a case.\"  Cristian remarked, \"Oh yeah, it's right here.  I got it.\"  As Cristian heard Layla thank him over the phone, he was hit on the head, and he fell to the floor.  Eli glared down at him. \n\n\n",
