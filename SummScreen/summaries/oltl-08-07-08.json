    "soap_central": "\nThere Must Be Some Way Outta Here!\n\n\nRex realized that Professor Delbert Fina, in 1968, was the key to finding the way back to 2008. While Rex was engrossed in reading Fina's book, Bo interrupted and promptly announced that he and Emma were over. Following close behind, an irate Emma made it clear how disgusted she was that Bo had asked her to sleep with him, even though he had dumped her first. She was ticked off further when Rex told her that she'd had to sleep with Bo because it was a matter of life and death.\n\n\nTodd was appalled when he returned home and realized that Blair was wearing a nightgown he had purchased for Marty and modeling it for Keys. He denied that it was his, but Blair reminded him that she had apparently picked up one of his bags when they had bumped into each other previously. She and Keys attempted to explain themselves out of the situation, but Todd wasn't interested. He admitted that the gown was for a woman who already knew him better than Blair did. Blair found that difficult to believe and recapped all of Todd's previous misdeeds, wondering if the woman knew of all of those.\n\n\nViki couldn't believe her eyes as Tina stood before her in the airport. Before the two women could catch up, Viki broke the news of the diner fire to the Vega brothers, and they and Sarah went off to find Carlotta. Tina admitted that she had wanted to call Viki often over the years but had always seemed to be caught up in some type of adventure. She confessed that she had just learned that she still had feelings for Cord, which had probably prompted Cain to desert her midair.\n\n\nViki pointed out that Tina had also expressed her feelings for Cord when marrying Max, which caused Tina to shudder. Viki said she understood Tina's inability to get over a man. When Tina learned of Viki's imminent departure for Africa, alone, she felt that Viki herself had to be running away from someone. \"Who needs a man, anyway?\" Tina asked. She felt that one could get more out of having children.\n\n\nAs Tess researched the secret room in Llanfair, she vowed to go back in time to make Natalie and Jared pay. Just then, the doorbell sounded. It was Rocco, from the local garage, who felt obligated to report to Viki or Natalie that he knew the cause of the car accident. Tess invited him in, insisting that he give her the information. He shared the news that someone had cut the brake lines and that he intended to go to the police.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Madame Delphina offered her help in locating Rex, for $50, when Gigi asked to take her order. When Gigi balked at the price, Delphina suggested she \"ask the sailor about the phone call you missed.\" Gigi was confused until Delphina hastily corrected herself and suggested she consult the officer. Layla asked Brody for a strong drink and told him that he was as bad as every other man around. He retorted that he had changed because he had a future.\n\n\nMadame Delphina asked Brody if he had done anything sneaky recently, causing an uncomfortable Brody to look away. \"You really can't be a better person for someone else. You have to do it for yourself,\" Layla admonished him. Gigi sauntered over and asked for her phone. Noting that she hadn't missed any calls, she suddenly realized that all of her calls were no longer listed and that everything had been erased. A shamefaced Brody confessed that Rex had called.\n\n\nCarlotta was at the diner when Antonio, Cristian, and Sarah showed up. She was thrilled to see her sons and barely took note when Antonio grimaced after her fierce hug. She told them that the fire department was still conducting an investigation into the fire.\n\n\nViki and Tina rehashed ancient history, which caused Viki to remember that she had recently had a dream about Niki Smith. She thought that Niki was trying to tell her something. Viki explained that Jess had been the one who had insisted that Viki go on the trip so that Jess could try to get back to her old self without her mother hovering over her. Tina remarked that Viki had always hovered over people.\n\n\nTina announced that she needed to find David Vickers, her dog, and get back some of the time she had lost with Sarah over the years. The women admitted that they missed each other in spite of things that had happened in the past. Tina hoped to still be around when Viki returned to Llanview.\n\n\nTess confessed to Rocco that she was already working with the police in trying to determine who was threatening Natalie after recent family events and the takeover of Buchanan Enterprises. She felt that Natalie would be pushed over the edge if the reporters who consistently lurked at the police station were to learn of this newest threat with the car. She convinced Rocco to turn over the report to her, and she would notify the police herself. She wrote him a check for double the cost of the bill, as a bonus for keeping the information confidential. She also asked him if he happened to know of someone in construction. After he left, Tess vowed not to give up until Natalie and Jared paid.\n\n\nEmma was dumbfounded to think that a son was trying to help his father get laid. Bo and Rex tried to explain that it was a case of abnormal circumstances. Rex pulled her aside to talk, but Emma told him that after a previous talk, she was taking better care of herself thanks to him, and so would not be just going to bed. Bo, too, was happy with her decision, since he felt that she looked young enough to be his daughter, which made him uneasy.\n\n\nThe men realized, too late, that if they behaved like their normal selves, it would make it difficult for them to get back to the future. Rex admitted that he hadn't realized that he wasn't supposed to change things. He decided that his next move would be to try to call the professor at the University of Austin.\n\n\nBrody reported that Rex had sounded drunk on the phone and hadn't made much sense. Gigi turned abruptly and handed her money to Delphina, who realized that Bo had to have taken the ride and that both he and Rex had gone back in time. Gigi chuckled at first but quickly became annoyed, feeling the psychic had duped her. Delphina explained that a portal had opened and that she was getting her information from a physics professor in the '60s. Gigi told her about the earlier phone call she'd had with Chuck, who had Rex's cell phone. The phone was the connection between the past and present, Delphina continued, as she became quite technical with Gigi.\n\n\nTodd ordered Blair from his home, telling her that she was just jealous of his new woman. He also told her to take the gown with her, as it had already been spoiled for his real woman. Blair suggested that he buy something sexier. Keys was fired, though he threatened Todd with knowing too many things about him. Todd countered that he knew lots about Keys -- enough to have him put away. Keys wasn't sure if he'd stay quiet. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" he said.\n\n\nAfter Viki departed, Tina headed out of the airport. On her way, she spotted the two nuns with her dog and tried to convince them that he was hers. They refused to return him until she wisely offered them a donation. They gave her the dog but were disappointed to receive only five dollars. Tina was ecstatic that she had found David Vickers and the real crown jewels, hidden in the dog's coat.\n\n\nSarah felt sure that Talia would be back and told Cristian how sorry she felt for Antonio. As Cristian looked at the framed first dollar that his parents had made, Sarah felt compelled to suggest that her own mother was the complete opposite of Carlotta. Cristian confided that he had seen the look on Tina's face when Sarah had reappeared on the plane. He told her how confident he was of her mother's love for her.\n\n\nAs Tess ripped up the car mechanic's report, again the doorbell chimed. It was Tina, who announced quite boldly that she and her dog were moving in.\n\n\nAs Gigi announced that Delphina was cut off from drinking, even if it was water, the psychic appeared to be communicating with someone alongside her. She mentioned Hamburger Hill and received the numbers six and eight. She told Gigi it was about 1986. Gigi asked at the bar and was told that Hamburger Hill was in Vietnam. As Delphina babbled on about twin paradoxes and time travel, they realized that it was 1968, not 1986. Gigi asked Delphina to get her back to 1968. Delphina offered to try.\n\n\nIn 1968, Professor Fina arrived at the caf\u00e9. He laughed and thought that he was being held hostage to a prank when Rex and Bo tried to explain their arrival from the future. When he saw the cell phone, he was speechless. He offered to help them get home. Bo and Rex asked about helping them get to 2008. He offered to try. \n\n\n",
