As Fish continued to deny his romantic feelings, Kyle grabbed Fish and gave him a passionate kiss.  After a brief struggle, Fish responded to Kyle's kiss.  As the old lovers shared a special moment, Cris approached them and ordered Fish to tell Layla the truth-Fish was gay. \n\n\nFish claimed that Kyle had accosted him, but Cris related that he was aware of Fish's true sexual orientation.   Fish refused to admit that he was gay, and referred to Kyle as a \"freak.\"\ufffd  Cris informed Fish that there wasn't anything wrong with being gay, but Cris was adamant that Layla deserved to know the truth.  Cris suggested that Fish tell Layla the truth before Cris did.  Before storming off, Fish ordered Kyle to stay away from him.   Dejected, Kyle assured Fish that Kyle would never bother him again.  \n\n\nFeeling partially responsible for Kyle's misery, Cris apologized and suggested that Kyle and Fish might reconnect after Fish told Layla that he was gay.   Relating the hurt he felt as a result of Fish's rejection, Kyle hoped that Fish would eventually acknowledge his true sexual identity.  Kyle admitted that Fish had used Layla to convince himself that he wasn't gay.  Kyle told Cris that Fish's fear would prevent him from ever telling Layla about his sexuality. When Cris stressed the need for Layla to learn the truth about Fish, he was stunned when Kyle remarked that Cris was guilty of the same offense that Fish had committed.  Kyle stated that Cris was afraid of telling Layla that Cris had strong feelings for her.  Cris was adamant that his only concern was to prevent Fish from hurting Layla.\n\n\nLater, Layla was thrilled when Fish paid her a visit.   A nervous smile crossed Fish's face when Layla proclaimed that she was proud to be his girl.   After asking to speak privately with Layla, Fish quickly changed his mind and promised to discuss his issue with her at a later date.  Commenting that Cris had to work late, Layla suggested that she and Fish spend a romantic evening alone at the apartment.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\ufffd, Todd phoned T\ufffda to wish her good luck at Matthew's hearing.  Todd told T\ufffda that he was certain that she would win the case.\n\n\nIn the courtroom, Matthew and Destiny discussed the upcoming hearing.  As Matthew admitted that he was conflicted over the idea of suing his parents, T\ufffda entered the courtroom and wondered what information Matthew was keeping from her.\n\n\nWhile sitting in a booth at the caf\ufffd with Hope, Starr phoned Cole.  Noticing the panic in Cole's voice, Starr questioned if someone had learned of Cole's undercover work.  Meanwhile, as Cole tried to convince Starr that everything was fine, a listening device sat unnoticed on the windowpane.  Convinced that Cole was in trouble, Starr wondered if she should phone the police.  At that moment, John entered Cole's apartment and prevented Cole from making a damaging statement.  John presented Cole with a handwritten note that explained that Cole's apartment had been bugged.  Cole assured Starr that there was no need for concern, and quickly ended the call.   Approaching Starr, Todd overheard the conversation and wondered if Cole was using drugs again.\n\n\nAfter chastising her father for speaking critically about Cole, Starr quizzed Todd about his strange relationship with both Blair and T\ufffda.  Pleased to be in the presence of his granddaughter, Todd ignored Starr's remarks and focused his attention on Hope.  Observing Todd's good mood, Starr remarked that Todd had demonstrated questionable behavior by sleeping with both Blair and T\ufffda.  Starr warned Todd that Blair wouldn't rest until Todd had ended his relationship with T\ufffda.  .  \n\n\nAware that the listening device had been planted inside Cole's apartment, John pretended to engage in an argument with Cole.  Warning Cole to refrain from using drugs, John reminded Cole of the consequences that would occur if Cole chose to do otherwise.   After relocating to the hall of the apartment building, John questioned Cole about the conversation he had shared with Starr.  Cole assured John that he hadn't revealed any damaging information to Starr.  Once Cole related his encounter with Asher and the Russian supplier, John informed Cole that John was aware of the supplier's identity.  Unwilling to place Cole in any further danger, John refused to divulge the supplier's identity to Cole.  \n\n\nAdvising Cole that Starr and Hope's safety could be jeopardized if his cover was ever blown, John instructed Cole to cease all communication with Starr.  John promised to explain the situation to Starr.  Realizing that the altercation with Asher and the Russian supplier had left Cole on edge, John agreed to terminate the investigation if Cole had any doubts.  Declining John's offer, Cole asked John to tell Starr that Cole loved her.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\ufffd, before heading off to the courtroom hearing, Nora and Clint examined their wedding photos.   Nora thanked Clint for offering to escort her to Matthew's emancipation hearing.  While Nora worried about the outcome of the case, Clint revealed that he had researched the lawyer that Nora had hired, and Clint was confident that Nora and Bo would prevail in court.  \n\n\nJohn interrupted Starr and Todd's conversation at the caf\ufffd. When John asked to speak to Starr in private, Todd was convinced that Starr was hiding information regarding Cole.  Alone with Starr, John informed her that Cole would no longer be able to communicate with her.   Starr appeared content when John related Cole's message to her. \n\n\nBack in the courtroom, T\ufffda informed Matthew that he might lose his case if he withheld any information from her.  Stating that he had no desire to air his parent's dirty laundry, Matthew refused to give T\ufffda any information.   Matthew was concerned that T\ufffda might use the information against his parents in court.  Succumbing to pressure from T\ufffda, Matthew finally admitted that he blackmailed his parents after observing them in a compromising situation on the eve of Nora's wedding to Clint.  T\ufffda was surprised to learn that Bo and Nora made no attempt to prevent Matthew from informing Clint of the indiscretion.  \n\n\nInside Bo's office at the police station, Bo had a flashback of the kiss he had shared with Nora. Rex interrupted Bo's thoughts when he entered the office and informed Bo that Rex had impregnated Stacy.   Bo was skeptical of Stacy's pregnancy claim, but wondered what Rex intended to do about it.  Insisting that he couldn't abandon his child, Rex related Gigi's fear that Stacy would ruin their relationship.  Rex sought advice from Bo, but Bo admitted that he wasn't in any position to give advice to anyone else.  \n\n\nAfter complaining about his own domestic troubles, Rex questioned whether Bo had stopped Nora and Clint from getting married.  Rex was shocked to learn that Bo had kissed Nora at the lodge.  Bo admitted that he had several chances to express his feelings to Nora and to tell Clint about the kiss.  When Rex questioned why Bo had decided against speaking up, Bo insisted that he didn't want to hurt his brother.  Rex wondered how Bo intended to handle the situation.  Bo stated that he and Nora would live their own lives and pray that Clint never learned of the kiss.   As Rex prepared to leave, Bo warned Rex not to allow Stacy to get between him and Gigi.\n\n\n Upon arriving at the police station, Nora and Clint introduced Bo to Elijah Clark, the attorney that Nora had hired to represent her and Bo in the emancipation hearing.  Assuring the Buchanans that he would win the case, Elijah remarked that he was familiar with T\ufffda's tactics in court.  \n\n\nLater, Bo, Nora, and Clint arrived at the courthouse with Elijah.  As the Buchanans entered the courtroom, T\ufffda smirked at them.\n\n\nAt the cottage, Schuyler surprised Gigi with a kiss.  Pulling away from Schuyler, a shocked Gigi cried out, \"This is all wrong!\"\ufffd  Insisting that he didn't want to risk losing her as a friend, Schuyler apologized for his behavior and pleaded with Gigi to forget what had taken place.    Although uncertain that they could remain friends after the kiss, Gigi admitted that she had begun to depend on Schuyler and didn't want to lose his friendship, either. \n\n\nAfter agreeing to forget the incident, Gigi escorted Schuyler to the door.   As Schuyler and Gigi said goodbye, Rex arrived at the cottage.  Disgusted by Schuyler's presence, Rex sneered at him.  After Schuyler left, Gigi reminded Rex of their promise to be truthful with each other.  Gigi told Rex that Schuyler had kissed her. \n\n \n\n\n",
