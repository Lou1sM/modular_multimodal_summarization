Layla comes out and won't let Todd see Evangeline, either. Vincent offers to throw him out. Todd says Evangeline wouldn't want to be kept away from her friends. Todd whips out a big wad of money and tries to bribe Vincent to let him in the room. Vincent tosses Todd's money on the floor. Todd tells Vincent that he was in a coma, and he could hear the people around him. He jokes that everyone he knows has been in a coma. Todd leaves. Layla thanks Vincent for his support and says she wants to go home with Vincent. Layla tells him she knows exactly what she wants, and it's Vincent. Todd picks up the money off the floor and bumps into a hospital worker. Todd lies and says he's there to visit someone, and the hospital worker takes some of his money and lets him hang around past visiting hours. Then he goes into Evangeline's room. Todd says he hates that the OPP got to Evangeline; he wonders if he'd brought her to Chicago, then would she be okay. He says he's a control freak who has no control over anything, even himself. He wishes there were something he could have done to keep her safe. He tells her he lost it the day he thought his son died, and Evangeline was the one who helped him make it through that day. He says Evangeline gives him strength, and he needs it, because he's starting to accept the fact that his son is dead. Todd thinks Evangeline would tell him to stay calm. Todd says someone out there took his son, and he wants to make that person pay. \n\n\nNatalie shows Miles the carriage house, and says Viki will come around about having Miles stay there. He thanks her; she's glad to help. Miles says John is on a mission to send him to prison. Natalie says John cannot make a jury convict Miles. Miles says she's an amazing friend, who has a lot to lose. He asks her if she's just doing this to make John mad. Natalie snaps at Miles, telling him that she's helping him because he needs a friend, not just to get back at John. Miles apologizes. Natalie says she was manipulative and insecure, but there were people who helped her, and she started to care. Miles asks Natalie if she's worried what people will think about her for supporting him. Natalie says she doesn't give a damn about what other people think about her. She tells Miles not to be so negative, then criticizes Marty, but understands that she broke Miles' heart. She says it was like getting hit by a truck when she lost John. Miles says John is going to lose it when he finds out Natalie has moved him into the carriage house. Natalie says she will handle Todd. They joke about being at the top of Todd's hate list.

He tells Mike he loves him, but this is police business now. Michael denies knowing anything, and John yells, \"it's over!\" John says he understands why Michael did what he did, but wants to hear it from him. He thought they were covering for the murder, but really they were covering up that Tommy is Todd's son. Michael exclaims that Tommy is his son. Michael asks John to take it to his grave, which is something John cannot do, and a single tear rolls down his cheek. John tries to empathize with Michael, but says Tommy's adoption is illegal. Michael compares his family being ripped apart with the death of John and Michael's father years ago. John doesn't think you can compare the two situations. John asks Michael why he didn't come to him for help. Michael says it's because for John, the law comes first, and he would have taken Tommy away sooner. John says that if he doesn't take Tommy away, someone else will, someday. What Michael did is not only illegal, it's immoral. Michael asks if John thinks Todd is a better parent than Michael and Marcie. Michael asks John to keep his mouth shut. John tells Michael not to make this about them. Michael says it's about family. John says he can't keep it secret because it's against the law, and the law is what separates us from the animals. Michael cries that Todd already has two kids, and Tommy is Michael and Marcie's only shot. John says they have to give Tommy back: Michael is not the father, and Tommy was stolen. John says by keeping Tommy, Michael is doing Spencer's dirty work. Both brothers cry a bit. Michael asks John how does he give Tommy up? John's cell phone rings; he is on call and has to handle an emergency at Capricorn. Michael begs John not to tell, because if they lose Tommy, they won't be able to have another adoption, and it will kill Marcie. Both brothers cry some more. John has to go. Michael asks him what he's going to do and John doesn't know. Rex says John is not going to tell about Tommy. Michael laughs and says he will. Rex says that Todd will think Tommy is better off with Michael and Marcie. Michael says it's obvious that Todd wants his son back. Rex says maybe Michael, Marcie, and Tommy should go out of town, permanently. \n\n\nCristian stabs Hunter in front of Sarah. Hunter falls to the floor, his pulse weak. Sarah calls 911. Hunter dies.
