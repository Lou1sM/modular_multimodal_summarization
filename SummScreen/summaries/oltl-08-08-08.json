    "soap_central": "\nHello? I Love You\n\n\nBack in 1968, while listening to a song recorded by the Doors, Rex and Bo discussed how to return to the year 2008. As Bo skimmed through the local paper, he was horrified by the terrible tragedies that were taking place in the year 1968. When Clint and Chuck III entered the room and announced that they were throwing him a farewell bash, Rex was reminded that he would be shipping off to serve in Vietnam the following day. Everyone encouraged Rex to accept his fate, but Rex begged Bo to send him away to Canada. In a harsh tone, Bo told Rex to suck it up and fight for his country like a man. Rex was shocked that a father could show such little compassion for his son.\n\n\nInterrupting the argument between Bo and Rex, Clint asked who the strange houseguest was that had stayed overnight at the ranch. Before Bo could respond, Professor Fina entered the room and stated that he was ready to catapult Bo and Rex back into the future. Although Bo made up an excuse to explain the professor's presence, Clint remained skeptical and chastised Rex for allowing a con man to scam Asa. After Bo ordered Clint to stay out of his affairs, Clint stated that he had better things to attend to. Bo told Clint to stay away from Maria.\n\n\nClint attempted to stand up to Bo but was instantly warned to do as he was told. Alone with Fina, Bo and Rex were determined to leave the past behind. Fed up with Fina's ramblings, Rex demanded to know if he could help them. Fina stated that he could -- as long as they hadn't done anything thus far that would alter the future. Fina's words left Bo and Rex concerned.\n\n\nAfter learning that Bo hadn't slept with Emma, the professor said that it was possible to get around the birth of David Vickers but warned that if any further infractions were to take place, Bo and Rex could end up stuck in 1968.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in a nearby room, Clint told an uncomfortable Maria how much he loved her. Noticing that Maria seemed worried, Clint begged her to tell him what was wrong. Rex reminded Bo that he needed to prevent Maria from telling Clint that she was pregnant.\n\n\nAs Maria prepared to tell Clint the truth, Bo barged into the room and reminded Clint that he had a job assignment to tend to. Clint refused to leave Maria's side. After Maria urged Clint to do as he was told, Clint left the ranch. Alone with Maria, Bo offered to pay her to leave town.\n\n\nIn Llanview, Gigi treated Shane to a special breakfast and listened to the Doors, which was playing on the top 40 countdown charts, a salute to the year 1968. An agitated Brody entered the room and attempted to change the station, opting for music from the current century, but Gigi stopped him by claiming she loved the music from that era. Realizing that his mother only made waffles on special occasions, Shane questioned what was going on. As Brody listened, Gigi told Shane that she would be leaving town for a while. She promised that she would only be gone for a few days and assured him that his dad would take good care of him while she was away.\n\n\nGigi told Shane that Rex was in trouble and needed her help. With Brody's encouragement, Shane begged his mother not to go. The child stated that he cared for Rex but loved the idea of having his parents together. Gigi pleaded with Shane to understand, but the child refused and stormed out of the room. While Gigi and Brody argued, Madame Delphina knocked on the door. Holding the book that Professor Fina had written, Delphina told Gigi that she knew exactly where to find Rex.\n\n\nRex asked exactly how Professor Fina planned to return him to the future. Meanwhile, Gigi asked Delphina exactly how she would transport Gigi to the year 1968 and back to 2008 afterward. At the exact same time, Fina and Delphina explained to Rex and Gigi the same situation. They needed to find the time portal that had placed Rex in the past. Rex and Gigi would have to pass through the portal. Professor Fina told Rex that he had never heard of two people going through the portal at the exact same time.\n\n\nGigi balked when Delphina announced that it would cost five thousand dollars to help locate Rex. As Gigi refused to pay and walked off, Delphina told a shocked Gigi that she needed to find her son's father. Realizing that Delphina wasn't a fraud, Gigi told her that she didn't have five thousand dollars and asked what would happen to Rex. Delphina refused to offer any information without a monetary gift.\n\n\nFina racked his brain to uncover the portal. Holding his cell phone, Rex announced that the phone was the portal. Rex explained that he had placed a call to Gigi from the phone. Fina told Rex that he believed that Rex and Bo were running out of time.\n\n\nInitially, Maria refused to accept Bo's bribe. After realizing that Bo didn't want a Mexican grandchild, an angry Maria took the money. Before leaving the ranch, she told Bo that his grandson would be a better person for never meeting Asa Buchanan.\n\n\nBo returned to Rex and Professor Fina. Sadly, Bo informed Rex and Fina that he had set things in motion. Sensing that Bo felt terrible about sending Maria away, Rex reminded Bo that he wasn't anything like Asa. Fina told the men that the time portal grew smaller with every passing day. He feared that they had already been in the year 1968 for so long that perhaps the portal was too small to enter through.\n\n\nFina said that if the portal closed before they reached it, the men would have to stay in 1968. If they missed the current portal, they would have to wait until the year 1988, to make another attempt. Fina informed the men that if they wanted to return to the year 2008, they would have to leave that night.\n\n\nInside the carriage house, Brody asked Shane to understand his mother's decision. Brody promised that he would never leave Shane. Gigi returned and apologized for upsetting Shane. She announced that she wouldn't be leaving and mumbled that she could never come up with five thousand dollars. As Brody watched, Shane hugged his mother and told her that all he wanted was for her to be happy.\n\n\nAfter much thought, Brody handed Gigi a book that she had given him years before -- he said it had always given him luck, and he felt she could use it on her trip. When Gigi opened the book, she was shocked to find a check for five thousand dollars. Brody said that it was his military benefits, and he had been saving the money for a rainy day. He urged her to accept the money and get Rex back home.\n\n\nAs Gigi tried to reach Madame Delphina on the phone, she panicked when she received no answer. Brody was certain that she hadn't gotten very far and offered to look for her. Seconds later, there was a knock on the door. Brody opened the door, and there stood Delphina. With a satisfied look, she said, \"Well done, officer. I had a feeling you might come through!\" After sharing a tearful goodbye with Shane, Gigi left with Delphina. Delphina told Gigi that she needed to go through the portal that night.\n\n\nAt her apartment, Sarah awoke from a nightmare about going over the falls. Cristian comforted her and assured her that she was safe. Sarah asked Cristian if he believed Talia would ever return from Mendorra. Cristian was certain that Antonio would find a way to rescue her.\n\n\nSarah happily greeted Layla. When Layla asked where Talia was, Cristian prevented Sarah from revealing the truth and stated that Talia was spending time with her family. After Cristian left, Sarah told Layla that she and Cristian had declared their love for one another. Layla appeared bothered by Sarah's happiness.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina removed the jewels from David Vickers' dog jacket and placed them in Viki's wall safe. As she locked the safe, Tess appeared and advised her to leave Llanfair immediately. Hearing Tess's screams, Natalie and Jared rushed into the room. Instantly, Tess's demeanor changed and she happily introduced Natalie to \"Auntie Tina.\"\n\n\nAlthough Tina greeted Natalie, she appeared curious by \"Jessica's\" behavior. An impatient Tess watched as Tina and Natalie appeared to bond with one another. Feeling content, Tina looked around the library and stated how nice it was to be at home. When Natalie encouraged her to stay for a while, Tina said that she intended to reside at Llanfair for quite some time. With disgust, Tess asked Tina what made her feel that Llanfair was her home. Tina informed Tess that Victor Lord, Tina's father, had built the mansion for his heirs, and she had no intention of leaving.\n\n\nNatalie was relieved when Tess told her that no one had tampered with her brakes. Leaving Natalie, Jared, and Tina in the library, Tess said to herself, \"Death is too easy for you, Natalie. I can think of something way more painful.\"\n\n\nIn the library, Natalie admitted to Tina that Jared had posed as an imposter and that the entire family was upset by Natalie's relationship with Jared. To Natalie's surprise, Tina remarked that there was nothing wrong with being an imposter. Tina believed that Jared's actions were no worse than Asa's. Natalie and Jared listened intently as Tina recalled how Asa had paid off Maria to leave town, resulting in years of Cord never knowing his true identity.\n\n\nSarah and Cristian visited Tina at Llanfair. Overhearing Cristian mention that an unscrupulous contractor was attempting to place a bid to rebuild Carlotta's diner, Tess recovered the contractor's business card.\n\n\nExpressing her love for Sarah, Tina announced that she planned to stay in Llanview indefinitely and build a life with her daughter. An ecstatic Sarah was pleased to have her mother back in her life.\n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio briefed John about what had taken place in Mendorra. John showed little reaction when Antonio confessed that Tina and Cain were the cause of the fiasco and that Cain had escaped with the jewels.\n\n\nAs Antonio and John discussed possible ways to get Talia back to the states, the mayor entered the office and announced that no one from the Llanview Police Department would be stepping foot in Mendorra. Antonio and John argued that all efforts to return Talia should be exhausted and reminded the mayor that Ramsey -- the mayor's appointment -- was to blame for everything.\n\n\nMayor Floyd said that he didn't have the time to worry about Talia because he didn't have a police commissioner. The mayor said that Ramsey was a disappointment, and he needed to find someone that would heal the department. John said that there was only one person who could accomplish that. To John's surprise, Floyd said that John was that man.\n\n\nCiting that he was only a cop and that the job of commissioner only belonged to Bo, John refused to accept the position. Floyd asked John to step in as interim commissioner until he found a replacement. Without waiting for John to accept the offer, Floyd congratulated him and left. \n\n\n",

Tina informs Natalie and Jared that she does not hold a grudge against them for what they did. She informs them that Asa kept Clint from knowing his son, who is her husband, Cord. And we go back to the past to see when Clint (played by Jared) got Maria (played by Natalie) pregnant with Cord Roberts. Bo plays Asa, attempting to bribe Maria to leave his son. John and Antonio struggle to find Talia back in Mendorra with no help from the mayor.",

I Love You\" was playing on the top 40 countdown charts, a salute to the years 1968 and 1968. The song was recorded by the Doors, who died in 1968.\n"
