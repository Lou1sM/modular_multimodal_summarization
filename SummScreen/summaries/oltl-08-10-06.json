They both wanted Starr to wake up. Blair called John about the photograph she found of Spencer and his father with matching guns. Blair left the photo for John at the main desk. Blair visited Evangeline and asked her if she thought Todd was \"having real feelings for you.\" Evangeline didn't think Todd had feelings for her and added that, \"I'm with Cristian.\" Blair left and Todd popped in. Evangeline asked him point blank if he was having feelings for her. Todd just said he was happy she had her sight back and then took her hand. She assured him that he had done more than enough for her, referring to the fact that he had funded her eyesight surgery. \n\n\nNash was annoyed to hear that Brennan had been renamed Bree, and accused Antonio of being behind the change. Jessica denied it and explained it was just a nickname. Nash promised not to cause any more trouble but said that Tess would have hated the name change. Nash couldn't tell if Jessica wanted to know more about his relationship with Tess or not, but Jessica clearly didn't like hearing about Tess and Nash's sex life. Nash admitted he wanted Tess back. \"I'm being honest with you. I always have been,\" declared Nash. \n\n\nAntonio told Claudia that Tess hadn't come out again and thanked Claudia for the tip that helped him find Jessica. Antonio promised to protect Claudia, who was touched by the offer. A creepy guy then held up Antonio at Capricorn and demanded he give him the money. Antonio distracted the guy, grabbed him and tied him up. \"Just like the old days,\" Antonio said referring to his days as a cop as he proudly took charge. \n\n\nJohn and Bo looked at the photo Blair had left for them. They were sure the gun Spencer was holding was the gun that killed John's father. \n\n\nClint ran into Dorian at the hospital and they talked about the various family members who were there, specifically Asa and Starr. Rex called Dorian with word that Adriana had run away. Clint wondered why Dorian was so calm about the fact that Adriana was missing. Dorian claimed to be worried about Adriana but added she felt relieved that Rex appeared to be out of Adriana's life. \n\n\nRex began searching the beach for Adriana. He caught up with the homeless guy. The guy was pretty sure that Adirana left the island. \n\n\nAdriana and Bruce waited for the gas station to open. Adriana wanted to borrow Bruce's cell phone, but he said they wouldn't get any reception. He invited Adriana to tell him her story, which she proceeded to do. Adriana believed that Rex had set up everything so he could play the hero. Bruce thought Adriana was better off without Rex. Bruce got Adriana a bottle of water but drugged it before she drank it. Adriana got woozy immediately and as she began to fade out, Bruce told her that he was behind all the stalking, not Rex. Adriana tried to escape but passed out. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Adriana is with Bruce in his car. He has stopped driving for a while and they talk. She is comfortable with him. He has a lot of questions and she answers most of them. She asks now if she can borrow his phone as she needs to call someone to tell she is coming home. She has left her purse and cellphone back at the cottage since she ran off so fast. Blair wakes realizing that she has slept far too long. Todd says that he probably needs it after spending all that time with her boyfriend. Todd is sure that Starr will get better. Blair wonders if he is going to buy positive results like he did for Evangeline. \"She owes you know.\" Todd denies that. He was simply paying off a debt. \"Mom?\" Todd and Blair turn to Starr and see that she is awake. She falls back asleep right away but her getting up was a good sign. Blair sees the picture that she took from Spencer's apartment, in her purse and she decides that she has to take care of something. \"I will be back!\" she says. Todd tells her to give Spencer his best. Blair calls John arranging to leave the picture for them at the front desk in the hospital. Bo and John pick up the picture and can see right off that the guns in the picture are identical and the same type as the type that shot Thomas McBain. Adriana and Bruce talk for a while. He listens to her story of her boyfriend turned stalker and calls Rex a real sick-o for being that way. She is dying of thirst and asks him if she could possibly buy her something to drink. He returns with water. She guzzles it down and asks if she can use his cellphone again to see if they can get service, so she can call home. \"Whoa,\" she says. She asks if it is hot all of a sudden. He just smiles at her. She can't see straight. Her vision is blurry. \"I have to call home to tell my mother what Rex did.\" Bruce smiles as the effect of the drug take hold. \"Rex didn't do anything It was me!\"",
