Nash and Jessica are back home from the hospital and Antonio comes by to talk to Nash about the vineyard. Antonio tells him that he wants out and came to him first but Nash doesn't have unlimited time. After Antonio leaves, Nash and Jessica talk and she suggests that she become his business partner. He's weary about it because he used Claudia for her money and he promised himself he'd never do that again, he doesn't want to take advantage of Jess and her money. Antonio goes back to the diner to talk to Talia, who asks him if he'll go to the Monte Carlo night fundraiser with her and he agrees.\n\n\nAlso at the diner, Marcie is talking with Michael (who's holding Tommy) about the state their family is in. Later the Mannings arrive and Blair holds Tommy and says he reminds her of someone. Mike looks petrified and Todd pissed and uninterested, as we see John looking in from outside.\n\n\nBefore Todd and Blair head to the diner, Blair is at Dorian's sunning herself and reading the paper. Todd comes by and informs them that Miles is staying at Llanfair at the bequest of Natalie. Blair tries to defend Viki, saying she may have other reasoning behind allowing Miles to stay but Todd shoots that idea cold. Todd then tells Blair and Dorian that Hunter has been killed but spins it out to make Cris look like it was murder and not a self-defense struggle. Dorian's delusion surrounding Viki doesn't sidetrack however and she says that Viki's just doing this because she and Clint are involved with one another. Todd and Blair leave and Clint tells Dorian to get all fancied up as he's taking her out tonight. He then tells her that he's going to take her to the Monte Carlo night and they sit down at the patio table as Clint tries to teach Dorian how to play Texas Hold \u2018Em. Dorian has an excellent poker face and beats Clint with a royal flush.\n\n\nBefore Marty's hearing starts, Cole is confronted by a reporter. Starr is with him and recognizes the reporter as someone who works for her father's paper, The Sun. She tells him in no uncertain terms that unless he wants to be banished to the classifieds for the rest of his career to leave, and he does. Marty pleads not guilty. The judge doesn't release her from prison though and her request of bail is denied. Later back in her holding cell, she and John talk. He tells her that he's glad she decided to fight but she feels like she's just postponing the inevitable. Back in the courtroom, Cole, Starr, Langston and Marko (who showed up to support Cole) tear the courtroom to pieces.\n\n\nNatalie lets herself into the carriage house and calls out to Miles to let him know she's there as she looks through the photo album on the table by the door. It only has one picture in it - him, Cole and Marty in front of a tree. Miles comes down and clues Natalie into the drama surrounding him because of Todd and Viki and her decision to let Miles stay at Llanfair. Natalie isn't worried however and tells him that Todd is no threat, especially to her, and how Todd tried to have Natalie killed after he'd had her kidnapped. Miles is shocked but Nat shrugs it off. She asks him to go with her to the Monte Carlo night, telling him he can stick it to Todd by showing up and letting him know things are fine and dandy. Miles though is uneasy about the idea and worries about how it will affect Marty. Natalie is aggravated that he's still thinking of Marty as his wife and bluntly reminds him that his marriage is being annulled and he needs to start a new life and stop thinking about Marty, and asks him whether or not he'll go with her.\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Marty surprises everybody in the courtroom by pleading innocent to the murder of Spencer. John and Cole and all her friends are happy. That is until the judge sentences her to return to jail. Todd informs Blair and Dorian that Vikki is letting Miles stay at her home because Natalie insists. They are baffled at why she'd do that. Natalie asks Miles to accompany her to the B.E. party that Asa is holding. Clint asks Dorian to come with him. Jessica and Nash are considering getting their winery up and running and debating whether she should be his business partner. Antonio tells Nash that he wants to buy him out of Capricorn to get rid of him. Talia asks Antonio to accompany her to the B.E. party. There is a mysterious guy in jail who is about to get sprung free and who looks like he knows Natalie and/or Jessica.",
