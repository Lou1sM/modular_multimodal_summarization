Acknowledging that the kiss had been a mistake, Schuyler admitted that he had enjoyed it.   Schuyler further shocked Rachel when he declared that a romantic relationship might have existed between him and Gigi, if Rex weren't in the picture.  Rachel warned her friend that Gigi was romantically linked to Rex.  Schuyler swore that he didn't want to cause a breakup between Rex and Gigi.  Although he insisted that he wanted to be Gigi's friend, Schuyler feared that he was incapable of having a platonic relationship with her.\n\n\nWhile counseling Schuyler, Rachel ranted about her altercation with Greg.   Still reeling from her confrontation with Greg, an angry Rachel told Schuyler about Greg's words of wisdom.  Rachel related that Greg had determined that Rachel was only dating Shaun because he was considered a safe choice.  Rachel was aggravated that Greg believed that she was too afraid to go after the type of man she was really attracted to.\n\n\nTo Rachel's surprise, Schuyler wondered if Greg's theory might possibly be correct.  Rachel insisted that she enjoyed Shaun's company because he was a nice guy.  Noticing Schuyler's skepticism, Rachel declared that she would make a point to loosen up a bit when interacting with Shaun.  Pleased by his friend's effort to enjoy herself, Schuyler suggested that Rachel join him at Rodi's to celebrate.   Rachel reminded Schuyler that Gigi worked at Rodi's.    Determined to maintain a friendship with Gigi, Schuyler realized that he couldn't be afraid to face her.\n\n\nAt the cottage, Rex was furious to learn that Schuyler had kissed Gigi.  Gigi insisted that the kiss meant nothing, but Rex wondered if Gigi had done something to encourage Schuyler's advances.   Arguing that Schuyler had strong feelings for Gigi, Rex instructed Gigi to stay away from Schuyler.  Gigi resented Rex's ultimatum and questioned whether or not he would leave her if she didn't heed his warning.   Promising to remain by Gigi's side, Rex related that he didn't want to risk anyone else interfering in their relationship.\n\n\nReminding Rex that he could confide in Bo about their problems with Stacy, Gigi sadly explained that Schuyler was her only confidant.   Gigi stated that Schuyler realized that the kiss had been a mistake.  Gigi proclaimed her love for Rex.  Pointing out that if Rex trusted her, Gigi maintained that he had no reason to feel any jealousy toward her friendship with Schuyler.  After receiving assurance from Gigi, Rex decided to trust her.  Gigi kissed Rex and left to start her shift at Rodi's.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Shaun and Greg engaged in a game of pool.   Shaun told Greg that Destiny had plans to attend   Matthew's emancipation hearing.  Greg stated that he disapproved of Destiny's decision to encourage Matthew to sue his parents.  When Shaun defended his sister's actions, Greg mentioned the altercation that Greg had with Bo at the wedding reception.  Shaun assumed that Greg had acted inappropriately.  Relating that Rachel had witnessed the incident, Greg informed his brother that Rachel didn't fault Greg for Bo's bad mood.  Concerned that Rachel hadn't mentioned the incident to him, Shaun wondered if Rachel and Greg were becoming a little too close.\n\n\nTeasing Shaun about his innocent relationship with Rachel, Greg questioned if Shaun and Rachel shared the same feelings for one another.  Greg insisted that he didn't want to see his younger brother get hurt.  Relating his past involvement with Layla, Shaun was adamant that he would never be fooled again.  Shaun remarked that he was confident in his relationship with Rachel because he had no competition.  With a sly smile, Greg asked, \"Are you sure about that?\"  The brothers agreed that Rachel was a wonderful girl.  Greg related that he wanted Shaun to be happy.  Stating that he was pleased to have his brother back in his life, Shaun assured Greg that Shaun's relationship with Rachel was fine.\n\n\nAs the brothers completed their game, Rachel and Schuyler entered the bar.  Upon noticing Rachel, Greg teased Shaun about his pool skills.  Ignoring Greg's comment, Shaun greeted Rachel with a friendly kiss.  When Shaun walked away, Rachel reprimanded Greg for his snide remark toward Shaun.   With a devilish look, Greg smiled and declared, \"What can I say, the Evans boys are competitive about everything!\"    \n\n\nAs Greg joined his brother in another section of the bar, Rachel wondered if Schuyler was ready to test his relationship with Gigi.  Upon noticing Gigi, Schuyler rushed out of the bar.   Moments later, Shaun and Greg returned.  Shaun asked Rachel out on a date and she gladly accepted.  To Rachel's surprise, Shaun asked Greg to join them with a date of his own.\n\n\nStorming into La Boulaie, a h ung-over Dorian scolded Blair for leaving her passed out at the church.  Apologizing for her actions, Blair announced that her night hadn't fared much better than Dorian's.  Unaware of the events that had transpired after the wedding ceremony, Dorian questioned Blair about what had taken place at the wedding reception.  Blair complained that Todd had ignored her the entire night.  Dorian listened intently as Blair described the kiss that Todd had planted on T\u00e9a. \n\n\n  Frustrated by Blair's jealousy, Dorian wondered why Blair was concerned with Todd's love life.  At the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Todd apologized to Viki and Charlie for Blair's behavior at the wedding.   Todd explained that Blair was jealous of his relationship with T\u00e9a.  When Viki questioned why Todd had decided to escort T\u00e9a to the wedding, Todd stated that he wanted to impress T\u00e9a by taking her on a real date.  Charlie advised Todd that a great date wasn't enough to win over a woman.  Reminding Todd that T\u00e9a knew him well, Viki urged her brother to work at his relationship with T\u00e9a.  \n\n\n When Charlie related how much effort he had put into winning Viki back, Todd was convinced that he wouldn't be forced to resort to such tactics with T\u00e9a.  Viki was appalled when Todd joked about T\u00e9a giving him a second chance after witnessing him having sex with Blair.  Todd assured Viki that T\u00e9a was over the incident, but Viki questioned if Blair had gotten over it.\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at La Boulaie, Blair expressed her anger over being humiliated by Todd at the wedding.  After recounting how Todd had announced that he no longer desired her, Blair described the passionate kiss that he had given T\u00e9a.   Remembering the awful night that she and T\u00e9a had spent at the fraternity house, Blair regretted that she had admitted her true feelings for Todd to T\u00e9a.  Suddenly, Blair recalled the partial confession that T\u00e9a had made.  Blair explained that T\u00e9a had admitted to having an awful secret, but T\u00e9a lost consciousness before revealing the mystery.  Dorian was convinced that Blair's need to expose T\u00e9a was a desperate attempt to win Todd back.\n\n\nLater, Dorian stumbled down the stairs to answer the door.  She was startled to find David Vickers on her doorstep.\n\n\nBack at the caf\u00e9, Todd confided in Viki and Charlie that his tryst with Blair helped him to realize he was over Blair and that he really wanted T\u00e9a in his life.  Pleading with Todd to be honest with T\u00e9a about his feelings, Viki suggested that her brother take it slow and give T\u00e9a time to decide what she really wanted out of their relationship.  Before leaving, Viki expressed her hope that Todd's relationship with T\u00e9a worked out.  With a big grin, Todd replied, \"Why shouldn't it?  T\u00e9a and I have nothing standing in our way now!\"\n\n\nBlair arrived at the cottage and announced to Rex, \"T\u00e9a Delgado has a secret and you're going to find out what it is!\"\n\n\nIn the courtroom, after witnessing the intense exchange of words between Nora and T\u00e9a, Matthew feared that T\u00e9a might use the information he had provided T\u00e9a against his parents in court.  Before the hearing got underway, Clint listened as Nora and Bo told Matthew that they loved him.  They were pleased when he proclaimed his love for them, as well.  Meanwhile, a smug T\u00e9a introduced herself to Elijah Clark.  Announcing that she had knowledge of a secret that his clients wouldn't want revealed, T\u00e9a threatened to divulge the information unless Elijah withdrew his case.\n\n\n  Unfazed by T\u00e9a's threat, a confident Elijah suggested that T\u00e9a take her own advice. T\u00e9a was stunned when Elijah informed her that he was in possession of damaging information that could be used against her.  An angered T\u00e9a exclaimed, \"You're bluffing!  You don't know me!\"  Elijah warned, \"Are you willing to take that chance?\"  As the judge entered the courtroom, T\u00e9a appeared nervous.\n\n\nStaring intently at T\u00e9a, Elijah told the judge that T\u00e9a had no legal case.  Declaring that there were no secrets to reveal, Elijah requested that the case be thrown out.   Citing several court cases in which minors had been awarded the right to determine their own fate, T\u00e9a argued that Matthew should be granted that same right.  Explaining that Matthew had lost the ability to walk as a result of a terrible accident, T\u00e9a insisted that Matthew was competent enough to make a rational decision regarding his own health.  \n\n\nAs T\u00e9a maintained that Bo and Nora were distracted by their personal problems, T\u00e9a came close to blurting out the kiss that Bo and Nora had shared.  Matthew held his breath as T\u00e9a struggled to regain her composure.  After glancing in Elijah's direction, T\u00e9a decided against carrying out her threat.  T\u00e9a made a quick recovery and stated that her client had the right to make his own decision.   Once T\u00e9a managed to conclude her opening statement, the judge called a recess.\n\n\nAfter the recess, the judge announced that there was sufficient cause to move forward with the hearing.  While Matthew was encouraged, Nora, Bo, and Clint appeared concerned when the judge informed them that the hearing would begin the very next day.  Clint expressed concern that T\u00e9a might pull a fast one, but Elijah assured the Buchanans that T\u00e9a was no match for him.  Advising his clients not to worry, Elijah assured them that he had several tricks up his sleeve.\n\n\nLater, Elijah approached T\u00e9a and instructed her to stick to the facts and warned her to avoid any dramatics.  Panic-stricken, T\u00e9a snapped, \"Who are you and who are you working for?\"  With a knowing look, Elijah glared at T\u00e9a and replied, \"I'm a lawyer just like you.  You know who I'm working for, Bo and Nora Buchanan!\"   Terrified, T\u00e9a rushed out of the courtroom.\n\n\nOut in the hall, T\u00e9a watched Elijah's every move.  As Todd pulled T\u00e9a into an embrace, his sudden movement frightened her.  Startled by T\u00e9a's emotional state, Todd inquired about the hearing.  Admitting that she had a bad case of nerves, T\u00e9a related that she had won the first round.  Confident in her abilities, Todd wasn't surprised.  Meanwhile, Elijah stood in the courtroom and studied a legal document that contained information relating to T\u00e9a.\n\n\n",
