She related that the only person who would have an answer was Irene Manning, who'd been dead for thirty years. The man suggested that Viki call a psychic, but he said he didn't need a psychic to tell him that he was Todd Manning. He wondered if she believed him. \"In my heart,\" she replied.\n\n\nThe man thought that the man calling himself Todd had tampered with the results of the DNA test. However, Viki didn't think that Todd would have made the results say that both men were Todd. Viki wished she could talk to Irene, but figured that Irene wouldn't give Viki a straight answer if she were alive anyway. She told the man how betrayed she'd felt when she'd found out about the affair between Irene and Victor. She related that she would have given Irene a piece of her mind if Irene had been alive when Viki had found out. The man remembered seeing Viki \"with the gloves off,\" and determined that Irene had been better off dead.\n\n\nViki admitted that the man seemed like the Todd she remembered. He replied that he wasn't like Todd; he was Todd. He told Viki about all of his loved ones that didn't believe who he was. He continued that he'd fought hard to get home. He hadn't expected everyone to welcome him with open arms, but had counted on Viki to. He was disappointed that she hadn't even offered him a hug. She responded that her brother hated being hugged. \"You caught me. I'm nothing but a great, big fake,\" the man said sarcastically.\n\n\nThe man told Viki that she would want to hug him once the DNA test proved that he was Todd. She wondered what he would do if the results turned out the same. He didn't want to think about it. Viki was going to get a room ready for the man. He didn't want to stay in the room with Victor's portrait, but she informed him that she'd taken the portrait down years before. Viki returned a short while later to tell the man that his room was ready, but he was asleep on a couch. Viki covered him with a blanket, and sat down next to him.\n\n\nTodd didn't care what the DNA test had said. He still believed that John had messed the test up. \"I am Todd Manning,\" Todd repeated to T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a wondered if Starr's twin theory could be right. Todd still thought that someone had tampered with the test, and that the man with the scar was trying to steal Todd's life. T\u00e9a assured him that no one was going to steal his life.\n\n\nTodd told T\u00e9a that Viki believed the man, because she was letting him stay at Llanfair. T\u00e9a tried to reassure him, but he added that the only one who believed in him was Jack. He thought that everyone else looked at him like he was an imposter. He knew that T\u00e9a was thinking just that. A short while later, Todd kicked over a picture of him and his family. T\u00e9a entered the room with Money Honey, and began to set the game up.\n\n\nIrene told Baker that it was inexcusable that all of her hard work was unraveling. Baker took full responsibility, but believed that \"the situation in Llanview\" was salvageable. He assured Irene that the DNA test didn't tell who either Todd really was, and that no one would find out who the real Todd was. Irene knew that Viki was smart, and that the situation would point Viki in Irene's direction. However, she knew that everyone thought she was dead. Irene regretted that Tomas no longer worked for her.\n\n\nIrene pulled out a gun, and pointed it at Baker. He told her that he'd been nothing but trustworthy and loyal to her for years. \"A dog is trustworthy and loyal,\" she replied. She needed someone competent, but thought that Baker was sloppy instead. She related that Baker knew too much about the Todd situation.\n\n\nTwo guards entered the room, and Irene ordered them to \"take care of him.\" The guards took Baker, and dragged him out of the room. Irene put the gun away. She took out a file folder marked \"Confidential,\" and looked at a picture of her and Viki inside the folder. She took out a picture of Todd, and a picture of the man with the scar, and looked at both side-by-side.\n\n\nBlair opened the front door of La Boulaie to Tomas. Starr offered to give them privacy, because she was on her way to James's anyway. She told them that they had a lot to talk about, and left. Tomas offered to leave if Blair didn't want to talk to him, but she let him into the house. Tomas wanted to know where they stood. Blair couldn't think about their relationship with all that was going on. Tomas understood that Todd was the father of her children, but wondered what Todd had to do with their relationship.\n\n\nBlair swore that she was over Todd. Tomas kissed her. Blair pulled away, because she still thought that things were moving too fast. Tomas wanted to know what he could do to make her trust him. She wondered how she could trust him when his job had been to murder her ex-husband. Tomas reiterated that he'd been told that Todd was an enemy of the state. When he'd lied about it, he'd been trying to protect her. Blair spat that she didn't need to be protected. She only wanted the truth.\n\n\nTomas said that he'd told Blair everything he knew, except the one thing that mattered. \"Damn it, I think I'm falling in love with you,\" he confessed. Blair was speechless. Tomas knew he'd have to do a lot to earn her trust, but refused to give up. He vowed to do everything he could to get answers about Todd for Blair, and left.\n\n\nStarr knocked on James's bedroom door, but his music was too loud. She walked into his room, and found him with his headphones on. She jumped on him, and he was pleasantly surprised. He'd been listening to her and Baz's music, and actually liked it. Starr lay down next to James so they could catch up. She started talking about the issues with her dad. \"Uh-oh, what'd he do now?\" James asked. Starr told James everything, and said she wouldn't blame him if he wanted to steer clear of her crazy family. \"Is that what you want?\" James wondered.\n\n\nStarr was surprised that James thought she wanted to break up with him. He felt that they'd been growing apart. He said that before, he had been the guy that was there for her, but it seemed that it had become Baz. Starr related that she'd been avoiding Baz \"like the plague,\" because he'd kissed her. James was livid that Baz would disrespect James and Starr's relationship like that. Starr hadn't told James because it hadn't been a big deal, and she hadn't wanted James to go after Baz. She admitted that she'd \"slapped the hell out of him.\"\n\n\nStarr told James that he was the guy she wanted to be with, and that she loved him. \"I love you, Twinkle,\" he told her, and kissed her passionately. The two began to undress each other, and moved to the bed.\n\n\nBo was surprised to see David sitting in the hallway at Matthew's rehab facility. David related that he refused to leave until Matthew was better. David wondered if Nate was in Statesville. Bo admitted that he and Nora had decided not to charge Nate. Bo explained what had happened between Nate and Matthew, and that it had been an accident. David wondered if Bo needed more evidence, and offered to wear a wire for Bo. He cited his experience from the Supermodel Crime Club.\n\n\nBo promised that he and Nora had a good reason for not arresting Nate, and asked David to trust him. David thought that Bo didn't trust him because of how David had first arrived in Llanview, pretending to be Todd in order to get money. Bo insisted that he was proud of how David had changed, and insisted that they hadn't charged Nate for Matthew's sake. Bo said that David was just as much of a son to Bo as Matthew was. \"Thanks, Pa,\" David said, smiling.\n\n\nBo asked if David understood why Bo couldn't tell David certain things. \"Not really, but I'm cool,\" David responded. David pulled out a copy of Vicker Man, and asked if Bo wanted to see it. David wanted to show Bo the entertainment system he'd hooked up in Matthew's room.\n\n\nDestiny told Matthew that she'd decided not to have the baby. Nora entered just in time to hear the statement. Destiny tried to explain it away as her and Matthew's hopes to one day start a family. Nora realized that Destiny was pregnant, and that it was what she'd been trying to tell Nora for weeks. Destiny finally confirmed it. She explained the circumstances, and admitted that she and Matthew hadn't used protection. Nora was suddenly emotional that Destiny was carrying Nora's grandchild.\n\n\nDestiny revealed to Nora that she wasn't going to have the baby, since she was only seventeen. Nora told Destiny that she couldn't have an abortion without parental consent, but Destiny showed Nora the signed paper. Nora begged Destiny not to get rid of the baby, because it could be the only piece of Matthew that Nora had left. Destiny replied that she couldn't raise a baby. However, Nora told Destiny that she and Bo could raise the child.\n\n\nDestiny didn't want to dump her child on its grandparents like Greg had done with her. Nora promised that the child would always know that Destiny was its mother, and that Destiny could see the child anytime she wanted. Destiny wouldn't feel right doing that. She informed Nora that her appointment was the next day. Crying, Nora got down on her knees, and begged Destiny to have the baby.\n\n\nBo entered the room with David, who announced that he and Bo were going to watch Vicker Man. Destiny grabbed her things, and ran from the room. \"She must have read the reviews,\" David said, and ran after Destiny. Noticing that Nora was crying, Bo wondered if something had happened to Matthew. She tearfully told a surprised Bo that Destiny was pregnant with Matthew's child, but had decided to have an abortion. She said that she'd begged Destiny not to, but Destiny already had her mind made up.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Viki laments to original Todd that the only person who knows the answer to the mystery of the two Todds is his mother, Irene Manning, who has been dead for 30 years.
