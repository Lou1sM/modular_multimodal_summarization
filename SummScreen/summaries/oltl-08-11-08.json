    "soap_central": "\nStrange Love Addiction\n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio congratulated John on his position as interim police commissioner. Wanting to leave town and search for Talia, Antonio asked John to accept his resignation. Unwilling to lose Antonio, John agreed to extend him a leave of absence, but insisted on accompanying Antonio to Mendorra. Citing that the Llanview Police Department needed John, Antonio advised John not to leave town. After agreeing to honor Antonio's request, John told him that he would contact an old friend from the FBI to assist in bringing Talia back to the states. \n\n\nTodd surprised Marty with a beautiful nightgown. Thrilled that Marty was pleased with her gift, Todd decided to spend some time with her. As usual, Todd began to manipulate Marty into feeling sorry for him. Todd told Marty that Blair had gotten her hands on the original gown he had purchased for her. Todd said that Blair refused to give the gown back because she wanted to wear it for John. In an attempt to cheer Todd up, Marty suggested he help her with a puzzle. The two shared a few fun moments playing crosswords, but Todd wanted more sympathy from Marty. Todd's conversation turned to Cole and the way he had turned Starr against Todd. As she listened to Todd's sad story, Marty consoled him. Todd appeared to love the attention he was receiving from his houseguest. When Todd told Marty that he enjoyed being able to confide in her, Marty reminded him that she was his friend. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, a depressed Blair sat at the bar and examined the gown Todd had purchased for Marty. Acting as bartender, Brody inquired about the gown. Blair admitted that her ex had purchased the gift for another woman. Convinced that Blair was harboring feelings for Todd, Brody suggested that she throw the gown in the trash and put the past behind her. Blair denied having any feelings for Todd. After much urging, Blair agreed and tossed the gown. She stated that she was over Todd and had a new man in her life. \n\n\nStarr phoned Cole and was surprised by the cold response that she received from him. Starr asked Cole if they could attempt to rebuild their relationship. In a harsh tone, Cole stated that it was too late and hung up. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint phoned a private investigator and hired him to dig up information on Langston. As Clint ended his phone conversation, Nora entered the room and wondered why Clint had hired an investigator. Clint lied and stated that he hired the P.I to search for Bo. Immediately, Nora expressed her anger at Bo for leaving town without informing his family. While Clint assured Nora that Bo was safe, they were both pleasantly surprised when Cord entered the room. \n\n\nCord said that he had returned to Llanview to check on his daughter and father. Concerned about the ordeal Sarah had endured and the trials Clint had experienced after losing Buchanan Enterprises, Cord believed he needed to return home. Clint briefed Cord about Bo leaving town and the events that led to his departure. As the conversation turned to Nora interrupting Bo and Lindsay's wedding, Clint and Cord reminisced about the time Cord interrupted Tina's wedding ceremony to Max many years earlier. Cord said his goodbyes and headed off to visit Sarah at Llanfair. Noting what a great guy Cord was, Nora wondered why he never remarried. Clint was certain that Cord had never gotten over Tina. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina, Sarah, Natalie, and Jared gathered in the library. As she noticed Natalie and Jared sharing an intimate moment, Tina mentioned to Sarah that she really liked the couple. Tina was surprised when Sarah told her that Jessica blamed Natalie and Jared for Nash's death. Tina assumed that Jessica was a forgiving person. Sarah believed that Jessica might have forgiven the circumstances surrounding Nash's death, but doubted that Jessica had forgotten. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Tess phoned Leo, the unscrupulous contractor. Informing Leo that she had a big job for him, Tess asked him to meet her at Rodi's to discuss the details. Before hanging up, she told him that he would recognize her-she would be the \"hot\" blonde in the room. \n\n\nAfter placing her call, Tess entered the library and told her family that she needed to run a few errands. Tess appeared bothered when Tina suggested that her niece might be working too hard. Tess snapped at Tina and left the room. Sensing Jessica was troubled, Natalie left to check on her. Attempting to prevent Jess from leaving, Natalie approached her sister and grabbed her arm. After looking down at Natalie's hand on her arm, Tess glared at Natalie. A startled Natalie released Tess's arm and expressed her concern for her sister. Natalie said that she understood that it bothered Jessica to see Natalie and Jared together. Tess said that she was fine and the sight of Natalie and Jared together no longer bothered her. With a big grin, Tess said, \"It's a big house with a lot of rooms. We're all going to fit in here just fine!\" A confused Natalie watched as her sister left the house. \n\n\nWhen Natalie returned to the library, Jared and Tina were discussing Jessica's weird behavior. When Tina stated that Jessica appeared bothered by her presence at Llanfair, Natalie defended Jess's actions by stating that her sister was dealing with a difficult situation. As the family continued to discuss Jess's bizarre behavior, Natalie listened and appeared surprised by their accounts. Stating that she wanted a peaceful stay at Llanfair, Tina asked Natalie to talk to Jess and convince her to work things out with Tina. \n\n\nMistaking Blair for Jess, Leo approached Blair in a flirtatious manner, and assured her that she would be pleased with his renovations. Before Blair could respond, Tess appeared and ushered Leo to a table. Blair wondered what renovations Jess was planning. \n\n\nAs Tess attempted to explain the job she wanted Leo to perform, she grew agitated with his intense flirtation. When Leo held Tess's hand, she responded by nearly breaking his finger. She advised him that she wasn't his average prey and warned him to get back to business. Explaining that she needed him to build a special room, Tess presented Leo with a generous check and ordered him to keep quiet about the project. Although he was terrified of Tess, Leo was pleased with the fee and decided to do the job. When Leo asked more details about the job, Tess said it could best be described as \"payback!\" \n\n\nTess brought Leo back to Llanfair so he could take measurements. As they approached the front door, Leo appeared suspicious when Tess made him stand outside while she checked to make sure no one was around. Opening the door, a look of disgust crossed Tess's face as she watched Natalie and Jared locked in a kiss as they headed upstairs. After the coast was clear, Tess escorted Leo to the basement. \n\n\nBack at Rodi's, John and Antonio meet Blair at the bar. After Antonio excused himself, Blair expressed her delight to see John. Blair told John about finding the gown that Todd had purchased for his new girlfriend. When Blair admitted entering Todd's house and actually wearing the gown, John was surprised but expressed his desire to learn the identity of Todd's mystery woman, too. As they continued to enjoy their time together, Blair stated that she was happy to be involved with him. With a look of surprise, John asked if they were actually involved. \n\n\nMeanwhile at the bar, Brody observed Antonio staring at Talia's picture. Antonio told Brody that Talia was in a tough situation and he had to find a way to get her back. Appearing heartbroken, Brody said, \"I know what you mean!\" \n\n\nSarah told her mother that she was madly in love with Cris. Thrilled that her daughter had found love, Tina encouraged Sarah to enjoy her relationship with Cris. Realizing that her mother wasn't truly happy, Sarah asked Tina if she still loved Cord. When Tina admitted that Cord was the love of her life, Sarah urged her mother to express her feelings to Cord. Tina sadly stated that she had lost Cord forever. As Tina and Sarah continued to discuss Cord, the doorbell rang. Sarah answered the door and was surprised to find her father standing there. A frantic Cord embraced Sarah. Hearing Tina gasp, Cord looked up and was startled to see his ex-wife.\n\n\n",
