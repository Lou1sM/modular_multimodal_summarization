    "soap_central": "\nThe Blair Snitch Project\n\n\nDorian, suffering a hangover, discovered David standing on her doorstep.  Dorian immediately suspected that David had run out of money or his agent had dumped him.  David denied both accusations and then quickly changed the subject.  Sensing that Dorian was troubled, David urged Dorian to confide her troubles to him.  Dorian questioned David's motives, which prompted him to reveal that he had regretted losing her to Ray Montez.\n\n\nDorian led David out to the patio.  As they sat down, David informed Dorian that he intended to settle in Llanview for thirteen weeks, or longer, if Dorian took him back.  As Dorian served herself breakfast, David began talking about the \"quirky\" residents of La Boulaie.  Dorian revealed that Moe and Noelle had moved out after she had created a scene during Langston's graduation party.  As Dorian continued to update him on everything that had happened since his last visit, David appeared delighted by all the scandalous details\n\n\nWhen Dorian revealed that Todd had been forced to move in, David pounced.  He offered to protect Dorian from Todd.  David's concern touched Dorian.  When he kissed her, Dorian responded.  Unfortunately for David, Dorian noticed that he had a microphone hidden in his jacket.  When David refused to explain the microphone, Dorian was forced to flush out David's cohorts by turning the garden hose on the bushes.\n\n\nDorian was stunned to realize that a film crew had been recording her reunion with David.  David explained that he intended to produce a reality-based show featuring David and Dorian's family.  David and one of his associates suggested calling the show The Real Lords of Landview or Cramer versus Cramer versus Cramer.  Dorian was not amused.  She was hurt that David would try to capitalize on her family's misfortunes in order to save his career.  Dorian refused to allow her family to fuel a cable television train wreck.  She tossed David and his film crew out of La Boulaie.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rachel and Shaun talked while Greg tried to line up a date, for a double date.  Rachel didn't think that Greg would find someone on such short notice, but Shaun was confident in his brother's appeal.  Moments later, Greg returned to the table with news that he had been successful. As they talked, Matthew and Destiny entered Rodi's.\n\n\nThe kids were upbeat after Matthew's first court hearing.  Matthew speculated about the impact Rachel's testimony would have.  Rachel was surprised that Matthew expected her to testify on his behalf.  She pulled Matthew aside, so that they could discuss it privately.  Shaun and Destiny turned their attention to Greg.  They insisted that Greg had to make things right for Matthew, since he had been the one to offer Matthew hope.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel wanted to know if Matthew intended to blackmail her, the way that he had his parents, if she refused to testify.  Matthew seemed shocked by Rachel's reaction.  He thought that Rachel had understood his desire to walk again.  Rachel admitted that she didn't think the surgery was in Matthew's best interest.  According to Rachel, Matthew had adjusted well to life in a wheelchair.\n\n\nRachel reminded her brother that he had the financial means and resources to lead a fulfilling life.  Matthew argued that he was desperate for the surgery because he hated being stuck in a wheelchair.  As the siblings argued, Greg approached them.  Rachel was stunned when Greg offered to testify on Matthew's behalf.  Greg explained that it was likely he would be subpoenaed anyway.\n\n\nGreg assured Rachel and Matthew that he would be truthful.   Greg insisted that Nora and Bo had every right to be concerned, but Greg was confident that he could help Matthew to walk again.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Elijah Clarke assured Nora and Bo that they would prevail in court.  According to Elijah, the burden of proof was on T\u00e9a.  Elijah didn't think T\u00e9a could adequately establish that Nora and Bo weren't fit to make a medical decision for their son.  Nora warned Elijah not to underestimate T\u00e9a.  Elijah wasn't intimidated.\n\n\nBo made it clear that he didn't want Elijah pushing Matthew too hard during Matthew's testimony.  Elijah was disappointed; he informed Nora and Bo that T\u00e9a and Matthew didn't have any reservations about playing dirty.  Nora and Bo where curious what had prompted Elijah to make such a statement.  Elijah revealed that before the trial, T\u00e9a had hinted that she had damaging information about Nora and Bo.  According to Elijah, he, not Matthew, had stopped T\u00e9a from using that information.\n\n\nNora felt sick, while Bo appeared disappointed in Matthew's behavior.  Elijah wondered what T\u00e9a knew about the Buchanans.  Elijah urged them to be truthful, so that he would be prepared.  Nora and Bo refused to tell Elijah about their kiss; they were certain that it would not become an issue in court.  After Nora and Bo left, Elijah made a phone call.  Elijah assured the mystery person that he had T\u00e9a exactly where \"they\" wanted her.  While he spoke, Elijah held T\u00e9a's dossier in his hands.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a ranted about Elijah to Todd.  She recalled Elijah's threat, but didn't share the details of it with Todd.  Todd was sympathetic, but he seemed more concerned about T\u00e9a's recovery.  T\u00e9a assured Todd that she was fine, but he didn't believe her.  He suggested that they \"road test\" her.  Confused, T\u00e9a asked Todd what he had meant.  Todd smiled suggestively as he lay down on the bed.  Moments later, T\u00e9a had Todd on his stomach with his arm pinned behind his back.  T\u00e9a refused to release Todd until he had cried, \"Uncle.\"\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a laughed as she collapsed beside him on the bed.  Todd admitted that he liked where their relationship was headed.  Todd also revealed that he had talked to Viki about T\u00e9a.  According to Todd, Viki had advised him not to push T\u00e9a.  T\u00e9a agreed that it had been sound advice.  T\u00e9a's good humor slipped when she recalled that Blair remained a large part of their relationship.\n\n\nTodd wanted to know what kind of reassurance T\u00e9a needed.  T\u00e9a suggested that Todd should avoid Blair, especially when Blair paraded around him in a bathing suit.  Todd offered to move out of La Boulaie, but T\u00e9a didn't want him to lose custody of the children.  Todd decided that he would hire an attorney to have the court order overturned.  T\u00e9a supported Todd's decision.\n\n\nHowever, T\u00e9a strongly objected when Todd suggested hiring Elijah.  She argued that it would be inappropriate, because she and Elijah were opponents in court.  Todd seemed satisfied to let T\u00e9a find someone else to represent him.  When Todd pulled T\u00e9a into his arms, T\u00e9a rebuffed his advances.  After Todd reluctantly left the bedroom, he had Elijah's business card in his hand.\n\n\nLater, T\u00e9a retrieved a briefcase with a combination lock.  She set the briefcase on her lap and then opened it.  T\u00e9a was overcome with emotion as she looked at the contents of the briefcase.\n\n\nBlair went to the carriage house to hire Rex to look into T\u00e9a's past.  Blair explained that during their captivity at the frat house, T\u00e9a had been on the verge of revealing a huge secret to Blair.  The gas leak had knocked them out before T\u00e9a had an opportunity to share her secret.  Blair wanted Rex to find out what T\u00e9a was hiding.  Rex hesitated to take the case.\n\n\nRex didn't want to ruin T\u00e9a's life without a good reason.  Rex didn't believe Blair's claims that she was concerned about her children.  He suspected that Blair hoped to use the information to drive T\u00e9a out of Todd's life.  Rex was certain that Blair wanted Todd for herself.\n\n\nBlair didn't appreciate Rex's insight.  She reminded Rex that he wasn't in a position to turn down a case.  Rex admitted that Blair had a point.  He agreed to investigate T\u00e9a and then apologized for suggesting that Blair had less than pure motives for launching the investigation.  After Blair left, T\u00e9a's public records were faxed to Rex.\n\n\nTodd arrived at La Boulaie to find Blair in the foyer.  The two practically snarled as they traded insults.  Each seemed determined to best the other.  After Todd walked away, he pulled out Elijah's business card.  Meanwhile, Blair picked up her cell phone.\n\n\nAt the diner, a harried Markko cleared a table while he talked to Langston.  Markko explained that he needed to work in order to support himself.  Therefore, he didn't have any spare time to spend with Langston.  Markko's temper snapped when he accidentally dropped the dishes in his rush to take them to the kitchen.  Langston wondered if Markko wanted to break up with her.  Markko assured Langston that he was happy.  However, he asked if Langston wanted to end things.\n\n\nLangston confessed that she had thought about breaking up in order to make Markko's life easier.  Langston felt responsible for the rift between Markko and his parents.  Markko didn't want to lose Langston; he loved her.  Langston wondered why Markko was in a foul mood.  Markko explained that he had discovered that one of his school books cost three hundred dollars.\n\n\nLangston offered to loan the money to Markko, but he refused to take it.  Langston realized that Markko was allowing pride to guide his decision.  She reminded him that, after the death of her parents, she had spent a year refusing help while she had struggled to support herself.  Langston regretted not accepting help when it had been offered.  Markko understood what Langston was trying to tell him, but insisted on paying his own way.\n\n\nLater, Langston happened to overhear David and his film crew talking at a nearby table.  Langston turned to Markko; she had a solution to his dilemma.\n\n\n",
