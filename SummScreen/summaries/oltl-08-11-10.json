Viki wanted to hear the latest news, and just as Jessica was about to share some of that news, a hungover David wandered in. He couldn't believe the Bankses had returned to Llanfair, and Viki reminded him that they lived there. \"Oh, so then you heard Jessica's pregnant,\" David exclaimed.\n\n\nCharlie, Viki, and Jessica tried to celebrate, but David made it difficult. He interrupted them whenever any of them tried to talk. He mentioned that he was in love with a girl named Mandy, and he announced that Dorian and Clint were back together. Everyone tried to ignore him, but David felt that it was Natalie's turn for a day in the spotlight. Viki ordered David to stop talking, but he went off on life and the fact that there was no point to it.\n\n\nViki was furious at David's \"boorish behavior,\" and she ordered him to \"take your misery elsewhere.\" David wondered if she meant another wing of the house, while Charlie suggested another zip code, and Jessica pointed out that another solar system would be nice. David turned to Jessica and asked, \"Is it Brody's?\" The others were appalled at David's question, as he attempted to explain the baby could belong to Tess or any of Jessica's other alters. Jessica was amused, and she announced that she had other news that David wasn't aware of. David asked if she were getting married, and Jessica's smile wavered.\n\n\nViki proclaimed that she wanted to make a fuss over Jessica's news, and David proposed they drink some champagne. The others reminded him that they couldn't drink. Jessica noted that she was pregnant, Viki pointed out that she had received a heart transplant, and Charlie merely said, \"Alcoholic.\" David set out to find a drink on his own, and Charlie followed to help David recover from his hangover. Jessica sighed and told her mother that she was relieved that things worked out the right way.\n\n\nAt the station, one of John's men advised him that Eli had returned to his room at the Palace. John planned to \"call around\" to see if Eli had an alibi for the time that Cristian was attacked. Before he could continue, Rex walked in to speak to him. Assuming that Rex was there to talk about Bennett Thompson, John advised Rex to drop his investigation, and leave it to the police.\n\n\nRex admitted he was perfectly fine with that idea after being drugged in Boston. Besides, he continued, he had a kid to think of. He added that John knew what he meant. John looked at him, and Rex awkwardly stated that John didn't understand. After a brief silence, Rex apologized profusely. He was also sorry for the way things had turned out in Boston. John advised him that details of the investigation would be kept private in the future. He wondered why Rex didn't leave his office, and Rex disclosed that he was really there to talk about Natalie.\n\n\nHe wondered if John had noticed how strangely Natalie had been acting. John noted that Natalie was always weird and that was one of the reasons he cared for her. He hadn't noticed that she was worse than usual. Rex figured it was because John had been busy, but John assured Rex that if something were wrong, John would know. John flashed back to his meeting with Natalie at Rodi's when she had asked him to keep her pregnancy a secret. Out loud, he informed Rex that nothing was wrong. Rex didn't believe him and disclosed that Natalie had been talking to Gigi about her problem.\n\n\nRex had tried to ask Gigi about it, but she wouldn't tell him anything. Again John told him that Natalie was great, and Rex should stop worrying. Additionally, if Natalie had a secret and was keeping it from Rex, it was between Rex and Natalie. She would tell Rex about it when she was ready. Just then, Rex received a text message from Kelly. \"Help,\" was all that it said.\n\n\nWhile she combed Cristian's apartment for evidence, Natalie suddenly blurted out to Brody that she was pregnant. A stunned Brody confessed he was surprised, and wondered if Natalie were sure. He wanted to confirm that the baby was John's, not his. Natalie revealed that she had several blood tests to confirm her pregnancy. Brody reminded her they had only slept together one time. \"That's all it takes,\" Natalie advised him. The baby could either be John's or Brody's.\n\n\nBrody was more than upset and announced that he couldn't have a baby with both Jessica and her twin sister. He wondered why Natalie hadn't told him about the pregnancy sooner, and the pair began to argue. She couldn't tell him because he had \"a lot going on,\" she insisted. Brody wondered why she even bothered to tell him at all, and Natalie began to explain that Gigi had suggested that Natalie shouldn't keep it to herself. Brody began to gasp over the fact that Gigi knew, but Natalie retorted that she had needed to confide in someone. She promised that Gigi would not tell anyone else.\n\n\nBrody apologized for overreacting because he knew it wasn't all Natalie's fault. He just didn't want to see John or Jessica hurt. He vowed to stick by Natalie no matter what. Natalie quietly informed him that she had decided to keep the baby, and Brody was taken aback. He wondered how things would be if the baby were his. Natalie felt there was only a small chance of that, and she was convinced that the baby was John's. Brody was worried that the others would find out about his night with Natalie, and there would be consequences.\n\n\nNatalie acknowledged that was all she thought about, but she had told John she was pregnant, and she planned on telling Jessica. Brody couldn't believe that John knew, but Natalie assured him that John was happy. She knew it was John's baby, and she had wanted him to know. Brody declared that it involved him too. He thought that he and Natalie would have been forgiven for their night together if they had confessed previously, but not with the added issue of the baby. He had his mind made up, and he planned to tell Jessica that he could be the father of Natalie's baby.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Kelly paid a bellhop to let her into Eli's room, where she began to look around. Suddenly, she heard Eli's key swipe the lock, and she ran to hide behind a chest of drawers. As Eli began to make himself comfortable, Kelly stared in horror at one of her shoes planted on the floor next to the foot of the bed. She had a moment's reprieve as Eli went into the bathroom, but when his phone began to ring, she scampered back. He had a conversation with Blair and advised her that he would get Jack to change his mind because Jack was wrong in his impressions of Eli.\n\n\nWhen Eli walked out of the room again, Kelly managed to hide under the bed. She pulled the shoe out of sight as Eli wandered around getting undressed and preparing to work. Kelly remained trapped, but she managed to send a cry for help to Rex via text message. Eli pulled the papers he had taken from Cristian's apartment out of his briefcase and began to shred them as Kelly watched. \"Done and done,\" Eli proclaimed as he put the last page through the shredder. Next, he looked at a copy of T\u00e9a's will.\n\n\nKelly's phone began to buzz and, horrified, she cringed as Eli walked over to the shredder and turned it off. He walked away, and Kelly looked at her phone. Rex's text message asked where she was and whether she needed John.\n\n\nBack in John's office, Rex tuned John out as he continued to stare at his phone and text messages. Kelly's return message stated that she was trapped in Eli's room, but she stipulated \"No John.\" Rex made it known that he had to leave, and he assured John that everything was okay. John wasn't too sure about that, but he again ordered Rex to stay away from the Bennett Thompson investigation. Rex asked John to look after Natalie. After Rex left, John asked Murphy if there had been any word from Natalie or Brody. Upon learning that there was no word, he assumed they were busy.\n\n\nTodd and Dani tried to prepare themselves to say goodbye to T\u00e9a. Todd didn't believe that T\u00e9a should die alone, but they loved her, and they wouldn't stand in her way. T\u00e9a disclosed that she had named Blair to be the legal guardian for Dani in the event Todd was incapable of taking care of her. She had even prepared a book for Blair all about Dani. Todd promised that Dani wouldn't lose him. No one knew how to say goodbye, but T\u00e9a was sure they would figure it out.\n\n\nT\u00e9a didn't want her loved ones to feel bad. Suddenly, Todd announced that he wanted to kick someone's ass, and he grabbed a board game off of the bookshelves. The family sat down to play a laugh-filled game of \"Money Honey,\" which resembled Monopoly. T\u00e9a finally won, and she told the others it was time for her to go. Todd suggested she stop at Llanfair and the diner to say goodbye, but T\u00e9a admitted she didn't want to go on a \"farewell tour.\" She would write everyone letters after she was settled.\n\n\nT\u00e9a accused Todd of stalling and never giving up. Reluctantly, Todd confessed that he was giving up this time. He promised to take care of Dani, but T\u00e9a wanted him to take care of himself too. She wanted him to be a \"best version\" of himself and not the \"bastard version.\" Todd wondered if his best version was that of a bastard. T\u00e9a assured him it wasn't. She wanted him to be happy, and an angry Todd yelled that she knew he couldn't deny her that last request.\n\n\nAlone with Dani, T\u00e9a handed her a necklace, which was a family heirloom. She wanted Dani to give it to her own daughter someday. Dani declared that she would never have a child, since she wouldn't be able to take care of it without her mother. T\u00e9a was sure Dani wouldn't need her, but she felt bad for having screwed up so much and letting Dani down. Dani admitted that she had tried to look at things that way, but she thought that T\u00e9a did things right, and she had been an awful daughter. \n\n\nT\u00e9a proclaimed that it was Dani's job to be awful, and things would have been wrong if she hadn't been that way. Dani thought that she'd rather be screwed up than lose T\u00e9a. Her mother deemed Dani perfect. \"You blossomed, and you will continue to do so,\" T\u00e9a said. \"You think so?\" Dani asked. \"I know so,\" T\u00e9a replied.\n\n\nTodd and Dani were unaware that they would not be taking T\u00e9a to the hospice. Instead, T\u00e9a announced that her ride had arrived. She wanted to say goodbye at the house. Todd joked that he was sick of only marrying T\u00e9a for 24 hours. T\u00e9a responded that it was one of her favorite pastimes. \n\n\nTodd told T\u00e9a he loved her, and she stated that she loved him.  They hugged each other. Todd was sorry that he hadn't been able to deliver T\u00e9a's fairytale. She urged him to give it to their daughter. Dani broke down and begged her mother to stay. \"I'll be right here,\" T\u00e9a said and held her hand to Dani's heart. She repeated it in Spanish, and she told them to be good to each other.\n\n\nT\u00e9a's last request was to ask Todd and Dani to hold out their hands. She gave each one a bunch of coins and told them to make a wish for her whenever they saw a fountain.\n\n\nEli puttered around his room and stopped to answer the phone. It was the front desk, and the young man advised Eli that he had a visitor. It was an agitated woman who wanted to meet with Eli in the lobby. Eli agreed to go downstairs to meet with her. Rex handed the bellhop some money and praised him for his acting skills. Eli left his room, leaving an indecisive Kelly under the bed. Suddenly Rex wandered in, and she scurried out. Hastily, she handed him her purse and dumped the remnants from the shredder into the purse. She urged him to check the briefcase while she thumbed through some papers.\n\n\nThe briefcase was locked, but Kelly took some of the papers and put them through the shredder so that Eli wouldn't notice the removal of the others. Rex was confused. Kelly stopped in her tracks long enough to advise him that Eli was Bennett Thompson. They finished up and left before Eli returned.\n\n\nThe attorney was on his phone, leaving a message to Renee, as he returned to his room. He was quite disturbed over the lack of service, the fact that he had received a message that someone was there to see him, and not only was that untrue, he was unable to even locate a staff member. Outside, Kelly and Rex were relieved over their escape, though Rex was perplexed over Eli's identity. Kelly indicated that she wanted to reconstruct the shredded papers, but she wondered what was in his briefcase.\n\n\nEli returned to his briefcase, unlocked it, and removed T\u00e9a's last will and testament. He had two copies, one with, and one without her signature. He removed the first page from one of the copies and put it through the shredder.\n\n\nNatalie pleaded with Brody to keep quiet. She reminded him that he was close to getting everything he wanted and he didn't want to risk it. She urged him not to say anything to anyone about her baby. As she spoke, John walked in.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd and Dani spend time with Tea before she goes to hospice. Tea tells them that she named Blair in her will as Dani's guardian in the event that anything should happen to Todd. John warns Kelly and Rex to drop the Bennett Thompson case. Eli returns to his room at the Palace while Kelly is in there snooping. He shreds evidence of his police record while she is hiding under the bed. She texts Rex and he pays a bellhop to call Eli down to the lobby. She puts the shredded documents in her purse to reconstruct later. Eli shreds Tea's will and replaces it with a false document. Viki and Charlie return from vacation and David spills the beans about Jessica's pregnancy and asks her if Brody is the father. Natalie tells Brody that she is pregnant and he is shocked that she is keeping the baby even though she doesn't know if he or John is the father.
