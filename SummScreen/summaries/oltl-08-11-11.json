Starr had to go pick up Hope. She needed to see Hope because of all the issues with her family. James offered to go with her to the revealing of the new DNA test results, \"unless you think it'll set off your dad, if he is your dad.\" Starr related that Todd wouldn't have the time to worry about James.\n\n\nJames wondered if Starr thought that the man with the scar was her father. Starr told James how the man had answered every one of her questions correctly, and about his look of \"total love\" when Starr had shown him a picture of Hope. James suggested that the man was just a good actor, but Starr didn't think that the reaction could have been faked. She remembered that look from when she was little.\n\n\nStarr continued that the man with the scar had felt like her dad, but so had the man she'd thought was her dad. Starr hoped that the DNA test would settle things. James wondered what would happen if it didn't. She wished she could stop thinking about the issue with her dad. \"I think I can help,\" James said, and kissed her.\n\n\nA short while later, James and Starr agreed that it had been worth the wait. James told her that she could use his apartment as a refuge from her family's craziness. He even told her to take Hope along, \"even though she hates my guts.\" Starr thought that Hope would accept James once she saw how happy they were. Starr had to go, but James pulled her back into bed and kissed her.\n\n\nRex was watching security tapes from around the mansion when Natalie entered. Echo had told Natalie about Rex seeing Gigi. Rex told Natalie that he was reviewing the security tapes from around the mansion to catch Gigi. Natalie grabbed the remote control and turned the television off. Rex turned it back on, so Natalie got up and unplugged the television. She knew that it had been hard to let Gigi go, but Gigi was gone, and Natalie refused to let Rex believe that Gigi was still alive. She was worried about her brother.\n\n\nRex insisted that he'd been in his right mind when he'd seen Gigi. He thought that Gigi needed him because she was in some kind of trouble, but she kept running away from him. Natalie wondered why Gigi would run away if she loved Rex. Natalie picked up her phone, and said that she was going to call someone who could help. A short while later, Natalie told her brother that the person she'd called had really been a help when Liam had gone missing. The doorbell rang, and Natalie went to answer it.\n\n\nNatalie answered the door to Madame Delphina. Madame Delphina had been expecting Natalie's call since the business with Liam hadn't yet been sorted out. Natalie insisted that it had all been sorted out. \"Not according to my sources,\" Madame Delphina replied, to Natalie's confusion. When Delphina walked into the living room, she yelled towards the ceiling. She said that a Texan kept calling her a \"she-devil.\" Rex was skeptical, but Delphina reminded him that she'd gotten him back from 1968.\n\n\nNatalie explained Rex's situation to Madame Delphina. A frustrated Rex only agreed to accept Delphina's help if she accepted that Rex had seen Gigi. Delphina agreed, and asked Rex to take her where he'd seen Gigi. When they arrived, Delphina needed something that had belonged to Gigi, so Rex handed her Gigi's wedding ring. They had to \"summon\" Gigi, so the three sat at a table. Delphina took out a candle and lit it. The three held hands.\n\n\nMadame Delphina called out to Gigi, and asked why Gigi was still there. She told Gigi that Rex wanted to talk to her. Fed up, Rex got up angrily from the table. Suddenly, the window slammed open, and a gust blew the candle out. \"Someone's here,\" Delphina said. \"Is it Gigi?\" Rex asked.\n\n\nBlair opened the door of La Boulaie to Todd. He handed her a copy of the Sun, with the headline \"I AM TODD MANNING!\" along with a picture of Todd. Todd wanted the brainwashing of his family stopped, and he wanted Blair's help. He vowed to do whatever it took to convince everyone that he was Todd. He called for Starr, but she wasn't there. \"At least Jack is on my side,\" Todd said. Blair had tried to convince Starr, but wondered who was going to convince Blair. Todd wondered what he could do to convince her. \"This,\" she said, and kissed him.\n\n\n\"What the hell was that, Blair? You know I'm married, happily married,\" Todd exclaimed. She'd wanted to test her memory, because she'd felt something when she'd kissed the man with the scar. \"How did I do?\" Todd wondered. She replied that she'd felt something familiar, but that was expected since they'd been married. Annoyed, Todd gave Blair a newspaper to give to Starr, and turned to leave. He wanted to \"work on Viki.\" When Todd was gone, Blair thought about kissing both Todds, and then kissing Tomas.\n\n\n Jessica entered the living room of Llanfair, and told who she'd expected was Todd, that the cover of the Sun should not be considered news. She was shocked when the man with the scar lowered the paper to show her his face. \"Libel's always news,\" he said. Jessica marveled at how much the man looked like Todd before his plastic surgery. She demanded to know who he was, so he told her to sit down.\n\n\nThe man filled Jessica in on his story from the beginning, to the odd DNA test results. He wondered if Jessica was still writing. She admitted that she worked at the Sun, which angered the man. The man wondered if Jessica had ever had any doubt about the man who was claiming to be Todd. Jessica told the man about how she'd been Tess when Todd had returned. When Jessica had returned, she'd thought it was strange that Todd had agreed to keep it a secret that Tess had been out. She mentioned that Tess had blackmailed Todd with the fact that he'd been hiding Marty in his house.\n\n\nThe man promised that he would have taken better care of Jessica. He wondered why no one had questioned \"Todd\" when they'd found out that he'd had an affair with Marty. Jessica apologized for not saying anything about Todd's odd behavior, but the man didn't blame her. Jessica mentioned that she'd also locked Natalie in the basement, and added that she'd been \"onto something.\" She explained her recent feud with Natalie to the man.\n\n\nThe man wondered if Jessica wanted him to talk to Natalie for her. She appreciated it, but she would see Natalie later at Clint's sentencing. She urged him to take care of his own twin, and she would take care of hers. Jessica hoped that \"this mess\" got sorted out. She was leaving to spend time with her kids. \"Lucky you. Sounds great. Wish I could do that. Hell, wish I could just prove they were mine,\" the man said unhappily.\n\n\nA short while later, Todd arrived at Llanfair, calling for Viki. The man walked out into the foyer, eating a sandwich, much to Todd's annoyance.\n\n\nThere was a knock on John's office door. Tomas entered, and requested John's help. Tomas explained that he'd promised to figure things out with the two Todds for Blair, because she couldn't move forward without the truth. John warned Tomas that the mystery could take a while to unravel. He thought that the quickest way to the truth would be through Agent Baker, which was why John had ordered an officer to tail Baker. The action pleasantly surprised Tomas.\n\n\nJohn's phone rang, and he answered it to the officer who'd tailed Baker. He asked the officer where Baker had gone, and wrote down the response. He told the man to continue the surveillance, and hung up. John disclosed that Baker had gone to Louisiana to a heavily guarded military base. John had plans to investigate it off the books. \"John McBain is going rogue?\" Tomas observed, amused. John had to do something, and told Tomas that he was going with John.\n\n\nInitially refusing, thoughts of Blair caused Tomas to accept. First, John needed to know what had happened with Marty. Tomas explained how Marty had found the disc with information linking Todd and Tomas with Baker. He knew that a friend had negotiated a trip out of the country for Marty, but he didn't know where she'd been taken. Tomas requested that they have another companion, preferably one with military experience. John told Tomas that one of his officers was a former Navy SEAL. \"Do you trust him?\" Tomas inquired.\n\n\nAt the gym, Vimal told Rama that they should go home and try to give Vimal's parents a grandchild. Rama agreed to go home, but only after she talked to Cristian, who was working out in the next room. Vimal refused to let her talk to Cristian, but Rama told him that it was a free country. She assured him that she'd chosen him over Cristian. She told him to speak to Brody, who was working out with Cristian, and left to talk to Cristian.\n\n\nVimal walked over to Brody, who was surprised to see Vimal. Vimal wanted to talk about Liam. He confessed to Brody that Todd knew about Liam being John's son. Brody was livid that Vimal had told Todd, but Vimal insisted that a drunken Todd had told Vimal. Vimal assured Brody that Todd wouldn't tell John. Todd hated John, so he didn't want John to find out that he had a son, and be happy. However, Brody thought that Todd was unpredictable. Vimal agreed, and said that he never knew what to expect at work. \"It's like there are two Todds!\" he exclaimed. Vimal reassured Brody, and walked away.\n\n\nBrody picked up his phone to call Todd, but it rang in his hand. He answered the phone to John, who told Brody to get to the station.\n\n\nCristian asked how Rama's fake belly had turned out. Laughing, she told him about how it had exploded, and Rama and Vimal had been forced to tell Vimal's parents the truth about everything that had happened. She added that she and Vimal were back together, and happier than ever. She thanked Cristian for the advice he'd given her about how she couldn't have love without honesty.\n\n\nRama hoped that Cristian would find someone to marry. \"Misery loves company?\" he asked. However, she said that he wouldn't be miserable if he found the right person. \"What if they're taken?\" he wondered. \"Then they're not the right one,\" she answered. She kissed him on the cheek, and hoped he'd find someone to \"wrap your Best Arms around.\" Vimal entered and agreed, as long as Cristian's arms weren't around Rama, and he led Rama away.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the station, and John showed him a map of where they were going. John told Brody that they were going to raid the military base in order to end the Todd Manning mystery. John showed Brody on the map exactly where Baker was \"holed up.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John contacts Tomas and tells him he needs his help in uncovering the mystery regarding Baker, his secret and why there appear to be two men with Todd's DNA. They are able to find out that Baker has gone to the Louisiana swamps. And John enlists Brody's Navy SEAL training to assist them on their mission. Everybody is questioning whether original Todd is an imposter or if the Todd they've known for 8 years has stolen Todd's identity. Rex tells Natalie he believes Gigi is alive and lost somewhere although they both know that Gigi has passed away and her heart has been given to Clint. SO they contact Madame Delphina to contact Gigi in the afterlife.",
