    "soap_central": "\nIf The Conduit Can Do It\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Cord and Tina were reunited, to Sarah's. Cord initially assumed that Tina was there to see Sarah as well, but when Cord began to scold Sarah for disappearing for weeks at a time, Tina admitted that she was the reason Sarah had gone missing. She told Cord it was all her fault, and after laying out the whole Mendorra story for Cord in the drawing room, Tina faced her ex-husband's fury. Sarah stood up for her mother, saying that Tina had tried to lay down her life for her child at the Hohenstein Falls. Over Tina's protests, Sarah told Cord that Tina's last words at the executioner's block had been \"I love you, Cord.\" Conflicted, Cord asked Sarah for a moment alone with Tina. \n\n\nIn Paris, Texas, Gigi and Madame Delphina arrived at the Bon Jour Cafe, where Gigi had a joyous reunion with Noelle and Moe. Gigi explained her plight and said she had come looking for Rex and Bo, who had been in the Bon Jour not long before. Delphina, still trying to commune with the spirit world, felt strangely attracted to Moe's bald pate. \"Really want to rub your head,\" she admitted, but Moe shooed her away, chiding Gigi for getting involved with an unreliable psychic. Delphina reminded Moe that his father, Jeremiah, believed in psychics, and asked how Jeremiah was doing in the nursing home. Her knowledge of strangers' lives unnerved everybody, and Delphina told Gigi that a storm was coming, and that midnight was the precise time for them to approach the portal to the past. After consulting Professor Fina's book again, she told Gigi she needed something more from her than money: She needed her faith. \n\n\nWhen Delphina went outside to commune with the spirits, Noelle tried to offer Gigi some encouraging words. She said she was sure Gigi would be able to find Rex again, and said that the Bon Jour was a magical place, not just for Gigi and Rex, but also for Moe and Noelle, and Viki and Charlie. Gigi relayed the news about Viki and Charlie's break-up, and said she hoped they'd find their way back to one another as well. Delphina returned to the cafe after communing with Professor Fina's spirit, and told Gigi it was time for them to head to the Buchanan ranch, Bo and Rex's most likely destination. Moe again tried to convince Gigi to cut Delphina loose, leading Delphina to work her psychic mojo again, telling Moe, \"I hope she says no.\" With that, Gigi and Delphina headed for the ranch. \n\n\nBack in 1968, Bo and Rex met with Professor Fina at the Buchanan ranch. Fina gave them the same information that Madame Delphina had given Gigi: Midnight that night was their window of time to escape back to the future. But it became clear that escape would be easier said than done when \"the Chucks\" arrived to remind \"Asa and Bo\" of the evening's big farewell bash for Bo and Chuck II, celebrating their departure for Vietnam the next morning. Rex was put even more ill-at-ease as he watched newsreel footage from Vietnam playing on the vintage television set. \n\n\nOut in the hallway, Maria Vasquez made her final preparations to leave Texas forever. Maria's fellow maid, Rosa, pleaded with her to stay and fight for Clint, but Maria knew it was impossible to stand against the power of Asa Buchanan, and said she would have to raise her child alone. When the young Clint returned home unexpectedly, Rosa covered for Maria, saying she had been fired instead and that Maria was escorting her out of town. The unsuspecting Clint told Maria he'd be waiting for her when she came back, and reminded Maria that she was a part of him. \"Te amo, Clint,\" Maria said sadly, and agreed that he was a part of her as well, \"the best part.\" Then, Maria and Rosa were gone. \n\n\nIn 2008, John and Blair were at Rodi's, comparing notes about Todd's mystery woman. John explained that he suspected that Todd was holding the same injured woman who Ramsey had been hiding at the penthouse, and laid out the chain of events for Blair. Blair was preoccupied with the possibility that Todd really had romantic feelings for the woman in his house, but John didn't believe it was about love, and said that Todd's boasts to Blair were merely about his own jealousy over John and Blair's liaison. John told Blair that with no proof and no visible crime having been committed, he would have to pursue the investigation on his own time, and urged her not to get involved. He reluctantly revealed that he was Acting Police Commissioner; pleased, Blair got John to agree to a celebratory date. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd reacted uncomfortably to Marty's tender touch. Feeling guilty, he told her that the whole situation was wrong; she didn't know who he really was, or even who she really was. Marty teased Todd, asking if he was afraid that she'd take advantage of him. Marty felt Todd's reticence to accept her closeness had more to do with Blair, and the fact that he was still in love with her. Todd resisted that conclusion, but Marty said he had to still have feelings for someone he'd been with for so long, despite all the pain and betrayal. Todd told Marty that she'd hated Blair as much as he had, and Marty said she could understand Todd's anger; \"I can't imagine someone keeping my children from me.\" She asked Todd not to harden his heart, but to express the pain and loss he was feeling at losing Blair and his family. Todd admitted that losing Blair did hurt. He said he was only guilty of loving his kids \"too much,\" and didn't want to abuse them the way his own foster father had; he said he and Blair had had it all, but everything was destroyed. Marty was pleased that Todd had been able to open up and trust her. \n\n\nOver at the Buchanan mansion, Clint and Nora cuddled up for the evening, only to be interrupted by the untimely arrival of Dallas, who came bearing gifts from London. As Clint hurried off to the kitchen with Dallas' tin of biscuits, Nora and Dallas engaged in tense niceties until Nora finally lost her patience and asked Clint's ex if she was in Llanview to win him back. Dallas coolly rejected Nora's suspicions, insisting that she and Clint were just friends and she didn't want him back. Nora didn't seem so sure. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan ranch, Chuck Wilson III greeted Gigi and Madame Delphina. Chuck remembered Gigi from their phone conversation about Rex, and handed over Rex's cell phone, which was burnt and scarred from the lightning strike. He reminded Gigi and Delphina that a dangerous storm was on the horizon, and offered to give the ladies a map leading to the location where he'd found the phone; as Chuck went to get the map, Gigi conferred with Delphina. Delphina told Gigi it was imperative that she not touch or use the phone further, and said that the phone was the \"conduit\" for the portal through time. As Gigi looked at her own phone's list of calls, she was stunned to see that the last call from Rex was dated \"July 29, 1968.\" \n\n\nIn 1968, Professor Fina told Bo and Rex that absolute precision was necessary to travel back through the portal in time safely. Meanwhile, Bo and Rex tried to figure out how they would slip away from the big party in order to go through the portal. When Clint blustered in, angry about Asa's firing of \"Rosa,\" Bo covered, and Rex defended \"Asa,\" saying he was a good father who only wanted the best for his family. After Clint left to tend to the party preparation, Bo and Rex pressed Professor Fina for more details on how they would get back to the future. \n\n\nAt the \"Good Day Cafe,\" Maria and Rosa stopped in to wait for Maria's ride back to Mexico from a young rancher named Al Roberts, later to be Cord's adopted father and the namesake of Al Holden. Though Jeremiah tried to woo Rosa with flowers, Rosa rebuffed his advances. Maria asked Rosa to give Jeremiah a chance, but Rosa was unwilling to open her heart, and said that Jeremiah would never be serious about a Mexican woman such as herself. Meanwhile, Maria was full of rage over Asa's cruel treatment of her, and vowed to someday have revenge on the Buchanan patriarch. \n\n\nAs Maria and Rosa waited, Emma Bradley and the young Renee blew into the Cafe, both of them full of anger over Asa's callous handling of their hearts. Emma admitted that she did want to go to the farewell party that night to say goodbye to Bo, whose recent kindness she had appreciated; she said she wanted to \"give him something\" before he went off to war. Renee, however, was simply incensed at not having been invited to Asa's big bash, and hustled Emma off to get ready to crash the party. \n\n\nWhen Al Roberts arrived outside, Maria said her goodbyes to Rosa, and swore that she would raise her baby, who she was sure would be a son named \"Cordero,\" the right way, saying that he would grow up a true Buchanan just like his father. An emotional Rosa then shared a final bittersweet moment with Jeremiah, and when he offered her another flower, she accepted. \n\n\nBack in 2008, Cord and Tina shared a private reunion at Llanfair. Tina acknowledged that what Sarah had said was true; her last thoughts when she faced death were of Cord. Tina told Cord that she still loved him, even after all the long years apart, and that no matter how she'd tried to run from their life together and what they'd had, no matter who else she was with or what she'd done, she always found herself back in the same place. To Tina's shock, Cord reluctantly admitted they he still loved her as well. Tina hoped that meant a new beginning for the two of them, and fell into Cord's arms. Though they were on the verge of a passionate kiss, Cord pulled away, saying that there was no chance for a reunion. He said that the Mendorra affair was just proof that Tina had not changed, that her lust for wealth and adventure was stronger than her love for him or their children; he didn't want them to reunite only for Tina to break Sarah's heart again when another Cain Rogan or David Vickers came along. A saddened Cord told Tina that she was still looking for hidden treasure, but he'd found his treasure years before, when they'd had C.J. and Sarah. Cord gave Tina his melancholy goodbye, and left with Sarah. Crushed, Tina collapsed against the drawing room doors, sobbing hysterically. \n\n\nIn Paris, back at the Bon Jour, Noelle and Moe were closing up the cafe when Moe asked to speak to Noelle about something. He related to his beloved one of his father Jeremiah's stories, about his \"true love,\" Rosa, who he had lost before meeting Moe's mother. Moe said he didn't want to be like his father, and wanted to hold onto happiness when he found it. With that, he proposed to \"Noelle Rosa Luisa Ortiz,\" who joyfully accepted. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan ranch, Gigi and Delphina found themselves in the same location as Bo, Rex, and Professor Fina, who were there forty years in the past. Delphina told Gigi that they were standing in the same foyer as the man she had lost. Gigi and Rex each wanted to call each other on their versions of the time-lost cell phone \"one last time,\" in case something went wrong with their separate attempts to breach the portal, but Delphina and Professor Fina prevented them from using the phone again, insisting that it was too much of a risk to the temporal conduit. If they made another mistake, the \"Finas\" warned, they could lose the ones they loved forever. Without realizing it, Gigi and Rex both sat down across from each other in opposite chairs, in two different eras, their hands resting on the same desk, desperate to find their way back to each other. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Rex are struggling to get out of 1968 and dependent on the help of the \"professor\". Gigi is struggling to find Rex and dependent upon the help of Madam Delphina. We see when Maria and Clint were prevented from being together after she got pregnant with Cord, in 1968. In the present, Cord reunites with Tina for the first time in many years.
