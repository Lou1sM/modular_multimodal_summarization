She attempted to duck back out of the room when she spotted Viki, to no avail.  As the ladies began to make conversation, Viki quickly brought up how Dorian had crashed her wedding.  Dorian apologized for her behavior, and insisted that her recent binge drinking was not going to become a habit.  \n\n\nDorian  changed the subject to David's return to Llanview, and told Viki that David planned to produce a reality show centered around the Cramer family, with herself as the star.  Dorian decried David's \"awful, just awful\" plans, but it was clear she was becoming enamored with the idea of celebrity.  \"America wouldn't just want to watch the Cramers,\" Dorian explained to Viki, \"they'd want to be the Cramers!\"  Viki admitted that the idea of becoming a reality TV star was intriguing, but Dorian continued to claim she would have no part of it.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Langston seized an opportunity when she heard that David's production crew needed a cameraman.  Introducing Markko, she told David and his producer, Ford, that Markko was an experienced camera operator who had been accepted to UCLA.  The crew was skeptical, but Markko said he was hard-working and learned fast.  Ford agreed to hire Markko as part of the team.\n\n\nWhen David heard that Markko was living at Llanfair with newlyweds Viki and Charlie, his ears perked up.  He told Ford that Dorian might have rejected their offer, but Viki, a \"real housewife of Llantano County,\" was an even better subject for reality television.  \"Between Viki and her daughter, Jessica, we have at least nine characters,\" he reasoned, adding that Charlie was an alcoholic, Jared an ex-con, and Natalie a \"trailer trash debutante.\"  As David reviewed the Lord-Buchanan family strife, he told the crew that they could begin taping Viki and then make her sign a consent form after the fact.  Markko protested, refusing to exploit Viki without her knowledge, and threatened to quit.  David relented and agreed to approach Viki up-front about \"The Real Lords Of Llanview.\"  An an aside to Ford and production assistant Priscilla, David reminded them that they still had a hidden camera for their first encounter with Viki, which Markko knew nothing about.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, John and Brody spoke in hushed tones about the undercover operation.  John told Brody to work as a go-between for himself and Cole, and explained that Cole had to start bringing in major drug revenue in order to meet the suppliers.  He warned Brody that Cole had to cut off all contact with most friends and family, especially Starr, in order to preserve his cover.  As Mayor Lowell entered the bar, John and Brody began to act out a scene for his benefit.  John slammed Brody into the wall, berating him for showing up at  work high, then sent him packing.\n\n\nJohn explained to Lowell that Brody was a drug-addicted vet who he wanted to help, but the m ayor was more interested in John's work at the police department.  Lowell was irate that John had made Cole Thornhart a special project, allowing him to beat a drug charge.  He wanted to know what John was working on, and demanded a list of all John's open cases.  John reminded Lowell that he didn't work for the mayor .  Lowell angrily told John to stop focusing on Cole and start cleaning up the city's drug problem.  Fed up, John told him to get out.\n\n\nIn a sunny local park, Cole was doing some community service, picking up trash, when he spotted Starr pushing Hope in her stroller.  As Starr and Cole embraced, Cole warned her that they were being watched by Russian gangster Serge, who was sitting on a nearby park bench, monitoring him.  Starr instantly began to play along, feigning her way through a conversation about Todd and how he was trying to keep them apart.  Serge walked over reading a newspaper, and intentionally \"bumped\" into Starr.  Serge apologized to her, and made several threatening comments about being distracted by the new guy working for him, and how accidents could happen, even to small children like Hope.  As Serge walked away, Starr and Cole continued their ersatz discussion; Starr pleaded with Cole to get their family away from Todd, and Cole promised to make enough money to help.\n\n\nAfter sending Starr and Hope away, Cole confronted Serge, angry that he was approached in front of his family.  He told Serge that he wouldn't screw up, and that he needed the cash.  He asked if the loyalty tests were over, but Serge warned him that he'd only completed the first round.  Just then, Brody walked up to Cole, shaking and pleading for more drugs.  Cole sent him away after telling him he was tapped out.  Serge was surprised Cole could turn away business, but Cole explained that he'd already given Brody too much \"weight,\" and that he suspected Brody of re-selling the drugs on his own.  \"You understand business,\" Serge said with admiration. \"You have natural instinct.\"  He told Cole that he'd speak to his boss, and maybe the man on top would want to meet him.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, John phoned another cop.  He asked for all the information on Mayor Lowell's anti-drug campaign to be placed on his desk.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the board meeting began with Viki presiding over the business of the day.  When Viki raised the issue of Marty regaining her medical license, several board members registered doubts regarding her mental state and recent brush with the law.  Viki defended her friend, reminding her colleagues that Marty had been cleared of all charges and recovered from injuries sustained in a car accident.  \n\n\nJust then, May or Lowell rushed into the conference room, wasting no time in registering his \"no\" vote against Marty.  He slammed Marty for her neglect of Cole, and suggested that as a doctor on staff, she could give Cole drugs.  He also attacked \"the company she keeps.\"  Viki coldly rebutted Lowell's accusations, and suggested that his attitude towards Marty had more to do with her involvement with John, who had exposed the mayor's office's negligence regarding Marty's abduction.  Viki called for a vote, which led to a tie.  The only board member who hadn't raised a hand was Dorian.\n\n\n\"Marty Saybrooke is a home wrecker,\" Dorian began.  She excoriated Marty for ruining her niece's marriage to John, and called her an absentee mother.  Dorian said she didn't like Marty, but that was irrelevant to her skills as a physician.  Dorian voted yes to Marty being reinstated, drawing a glare from Mayor Lowell.\n\n\nAs the board meeting adjourned, Dorian took one of her fellow board members aside.  She suggested they call another meeting soon to discuss her being reinstated as Chief of Staff, and asked him to keep it quiet.\n\n\nIn the drawing room at Llanfair, Jessica stared at her laptop, re-reading the newspaper headline about Nash's accidental death and Jared and Natalie's involvement.  Marty walked in, greeting her old friend, and they went out to the patio to talk.  Marty told Jessica she was nervous about regaining her medical license, but Jess reassured her she'd pass with flying colors.  Struggling with her emotions, Jessica asked about Hope, and admitted that she missed her terribly.  She wondered if her pain over the loss of her baby was what had driven her to distraction.  Marty asked Jessica what was wrong.  \"I'm seeing dead people,\" Jess replied.\n\n\nAs Jessica told Marty about the chain of strange events that had occurred since the night before the double wedding, she asked Marty if she was losing her mind.  She insisted the presence watching her felt real.  Marty suggested Jessica review the things in her life that might make her anxious.  \n\n\nJessica said she'd found new love with Brody, and had thought Nash would accept it.  She said she'd begun to wonder if it wasn't Nash watching her at all.  Marty theorized that Jessica was subconsciously communicating her own new feelings to Nash's spirit.  Jessica mentioned that she'd recently told Brody she loved him, on the heels of her and Nash's wedding anniversary.  She wondered if the stranger watching her was trying to pull her away from Brody.  Marty reassured Jessica that she wasn't crazy.\n\n\nViki returned home and broke the good news to Marty: she was reinstated.  Jessica asked if the decision was unanimous, and Viki explained that Mayor Lowell had been the only holdout.  As Marty said her goodbyes, Jessica walked her out.  She thanked Marty for listening, and asked her about John.  Marty hedged, and said that, like Brody, John was being very patient with her.\n\n\nAt Buchanan Enterprises, someone watched as Jared walked down the corridor and into his office.  Inside, Jared found Natalie perched on his desk in a sexy black business suit.  Unbuttoning her jacket, Mrs. Banks told her husband that he'd been working late too much, and she'd been compelled to return to work earlier than expected in order to drag him home.  \"Why wait to go home?\" Jared asked, taking Natalie in his arms and kissing her.  As the couple began to make love atop Jared's desk, the mysterious stranger outside left a package for \"Jared and Natalie Banks\" at the receptionist's station.\n\n\nAfter making love, Jared and Natalie got dressed and began to clean up.  As Natalie prepared to leave, they noticed the package in the hallway.  Opening it, they discovered a DVD, and returned to Jared's office to play it on his laptop.  The DVD began to display still images of Nash, and the accident at the Buchanan Enterprises  shareholders' meeting one year before.  Jared and Natalie were horrified as they stared at images of Nash falling, laying on the Palace floor, and dying in his hospital bed.\n\n\nJared rushed out of his office to look for the mailroom clerk, only to see the clerk hurrying away.  He called security.  When the security officer arrived, he told Jared and Natalie that the mail clerk had been gone for hours.  Jared protested that whoever had left the package for them had only been there after his secretary had gone for the night.  He requested security camera footage of the building, and asked for the package to be examined.\n\n\nBack in Jared's office, Jared and Natalie wondered who would torment them with the DVD.  \"I have an idea,\" Jared said glumly, and reminded Natalie that Jessica had been acting strangely.  Natalie insisted that Jess was integrated, and it couldn't be her.  Jared agreed that whoever had delivered the package had to also have been the culprit.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, Markko worked in the kitchen as Langston congratulated him on finding a new job.  Markko was impressed that David had agreed to do the right thing and approach Viki honestly about his TV show.\n\n\nIn the park, Cole continued picking up garbage, happening across a scrap of paper with a love note from Starr and Hope.  Turning around, he spotted them heading down the road.  Cole waved to her.\n\n\nNearby, Serge called his employer.  He explained that Cole was an intelligent young man with a head for business, and recommended that his boss meet him.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Marty arrived, happily informing John she'd been reinstated at the hospital.  As she recounted the vote, she mentioned that Mayor Lowell had opposed her because of his anti-drug platform.  John wasn't so sure that was the reason.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Viki asked Jessica about her talk with Marty.  Jessica said Marty had helped her with some issues that were between her and her shrink.  On the patio, a mysterious figure watched the women from the bushes.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang, and Viki went to get the door.  Answering it, she found David waiting for her, bursting with charm for what he assumed would be a surprise visit.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Jessica returned to studying her computer, and the newspaper headline about Nash, Jared, and Natalie.  Suddenly, she heard a noise and rushed out onto the patio, running straight into an unseen figure.  \"What do you want from me?\" Jessica demanded. \n\n\n",
