Delphina asked the spirit to identify itself and then told Rex and Natalie that she believed the spirit to be female.  Delphina informed the spirit that they were searching for Gigi and asked if the spirit had a message for them.\n\n\nAfter the s\u00e9ance, Delphina remarked that both the encounter and the message had been strange, and that the visitor had only made one thing clear.  Madame Delphina delivered the message about the spotted pony, but Rex and Natalie did not know what that meant.  Delphina charged Natalie 50 dollars for her visit and laughed with the spirits that Natalie had thought that she would live happily ever after with Lovett.\n\n\nNatalie chased after Madame Delphina, as she exited the house, and asked her what she had meant by the remark.  Delphina cried out that somebody had moved the island, and she ran off.  Rex then grabbed Natalie and told her to follow him to the stables.  Upon their return from the stables, Rex pondered that he had just rushed to the stables to look for a spotted pony, because some psychic had told him to, since he had been seeing his dead fianc\u00e9e everywhere.\n\n\nRex pleaded with Natalie to tell him that he was crazy, and that he needed to \"let go.\"  Natalie realized that Rex was grieving and remembered that she had encountered some problems in moving on after Jared's death.  Natalie had hoped that Delphina would tell Rex that Gigi was at rest, which would have given Rex some peace.  Rex sadly stated, \"I'm never gonna have peace.  Not without Gigi.\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, Destiny received Nora's phone call but refused to answer.  Destiny then listened to Nora's message that begged Destiny to not have the abortion, since Nora feared that Matthew would wither away and die.  Nora pointed out that Destiny carried a piece of Matthew and insisted that Nora and Bo would be willing to raise the baby, if Destiny could not.\n\n\nIn the exam room, Mrs. Evans thanked Dr. Wright for being there for Destiny, and Vivian recognized that Destiny would need comfort from her mother.  When Dr. Wright asked Destiny if she was ready, Destiny wondered what would happen if she decided not to have the abortion.  After Destiny expressed that she was still unsure what she should do, her mother claimed that they would all support her, no matter what Destiny decided.\n\n\nWhen Mrs. Evans asked if someone had persuaded Destiny to change her mind, Destiny answered that she had talked to Matthew's mother.  Destiny indicated that Nora had pleaded with her not to follow through with the abortion, because Destiny's baby would be all that was left of Matthew.  Destiny's mother asked who would be responsible for the baby, once it was born, and Destiny revealed that Matthew's parents would raise the baby, if she could not.\n\n\nMrs. Evans exclaimed that Matthew's parents should not be interfering with Destiny's decision.  Dr. Wright explained that if Destiny changed her mind, there would be no time left for an abortion at a later date, since Destiny was too far along.  Vivian declared that it was \"now or never.\"\n\n\nOnce Dr. Wright was in the exam room alone with her, the doctor assured Destiny that she would do everything possible to ensure that the baby was born safe and healthy.  Vivian informed Destiny that she would start her on prenatal care, and that Destiny would then have plenty of time to decide whether to keep the baby, or to let Matthew's parents raise it.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Jessica told Viki about her visit with the man with the scar and with Todd's original face and stated that the man had insisted that he was Jessica's Uncle Todd.  Viki related that the only person who would know the whole truth would be Irene Manning, who was dead.  However, Viki believed that John was trying to find out how the two men shared the same DNA, especially since they both claimed to be Todd Manning.  Jessica indicated that she had not been close to Todd for a long time, but that the new Todd had just wanted to pick up where they had left off eight years prior.\n\n\nJust as Jessica feared for Clint and his upcoming sentence, a cop pushed in Clint in a wheelchair.  The police officer informed Jessica and Viki that Clint had just been in the infirmary.  Jessica worried that Clint might have another episode in Statesville and wondered how they would deal with it.  During Clint's hearing, after Clint refused to address the court, Judge Lee delivered Clint's sentence of 20 years in Statesville.\n\n\nWhen Viki and Jessica expressed outrage at the long length of the sentence, the judge stated that the crime of kidnapping David Vickers and holding him in a Moroccan prison alone earned Clint that much.  After Clint's physician reminded the judge that Clint's health was not good, and Jessica cried that 20 years would be a death sentence for him, Judge Lee agreed and announced that he would consider an alternate site, as long as Clint wore an ankle monitor.\n\n\nAfter the judge added that Clint could remain on the premises of his house with the ankle monitor, Clint started to laugh.  Once Clint revealed that he no longer had a home, because his son had stolen it from him, Judge Lee stated that he had no choice but to sentence Clint to Statesville.  Viki then asked the judge if Clint could stay with her at Llanfair.\n\n\nJudge Lee asked if Nora had any objections, and Nora indicated that she did not.  The judge then ordered that Clint be fitted with an ankle monitor.  Clint said that he was not sure how to thank Viki, but Viki insisted that he did not need to.  Nora told Viki that she was on her way to visit Matthew, and Viki asked Nora to give Matthew a kiss for her.\n\n\nWhen Viki thanked Nora for allowing Clint to stay at Llanfair, since she could have stopped it, Nora related that she felt that she did not have the power to stop anything anymore.  After Viki left, Mrs. Evans walked up to Nora and slapped her.  Destiny's mother demanded to know how Nora had the nerve to mess with Destiny's life.\n\n\nAt the Manning estate, T\u00e9a told Dani that she had waited up for her daughter, but Dani said that she had needed time to think.  T\u00e9a indicated that she had not worried about Dani, although her father had.  Dani sarcastically asked which father T\u00e9a referred to.  T\u00e9a informed Dani that Viki had offered Llanfair to the man with the scar, and that Todd was terrified of losing his family.\n\n\nDani cried that she should not have run out on Todd, and that Todd had always been on her side, even when she had hated Todd and had chosen Ross over him.  When Dani asked T\u00e9a which Todd she thought was real, T\u00e9a claimed that she could not believe that the man she loved with all her heart was not Todd.  T\u00e9a said that Dani should have seen the look in Todd's eyes, when he had noticed T\u00e9a's doubt.\n\n\nT\u00e9a explained that they had then played a game, and for a brief while, Todd had seemed like his old self.  T\u00e9a noted, however, that there still was a man with Todd's old face.  T\u00e9a believed that they would get the answers through John's DNA tests, but Dani cried that she was not sure that she wanted the answers.  Dani sobbed that she was really scared.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a asked where Dani had been, Dani explained that she had visited Nate, not to get back together with him, but because she had needed someone to talk to.  Dani revealed that she was unable to talk to Destiny, because Destiny had her own problems.  T\u00e9a indicated that Destiny would get what she needed from her mother, because T\u00e9a knew how strong mother-daughter relationships were.  T\u00e9a insisted that she and Dani would be a lot stronger, once they reached the other side of their problem.\n\n\nAt a security plant in the Louisiana Bayou, two agents dragged in a supposedly unconscious John, and the superior agent wondered if anyone had ever wandered up to their front door in all of their years of operation.  The superior believed that the man was not there by accident.  After the agents pulled John into a cell, Brody and Tomas attacked and punched out the agents.  After John bound and gagged them, he discovered a file in the cell and flipped through it.\n\n\nWhen Tomas asked if the man with the scar had been held in the cell, John indicated that the cell had been occupied by another prisoner and showed Tomas a picture of Patrick Thornhart.  As John considered busting Thornhart out, Tomas revealed that he had already sprung him.  Tomas explained that he had reunited Marty and Patrick and then had sent them off into the sunset.\n\n\nJohn remembered that Todd had carried a secret at that time and had exclaimed that John would kill to know what it was.  John then announced that Baker was no longer their primary target, and that they needed to hunt down Baker's boss, the director.\n\n\nBefore he and Tomas left to search for the director, John refused to let Brody take any unnecessary risks, because of Natalie and Liam.  Just as an agent told Baker that he was sure that the director would put Baker out of his misery, John knocked the agent out, and he and Tomas wheeled Baker inside a cell.  John woke Baker up and demanded that he give them the name of the director.  Baker stuttered out, \"Irene.\"\n\n\nOnce Tomas voiced that they had to find Baker's boss, Baker insisted that they would need him to get to her.  As Baker held up his hand to the scanner to allow them access into Security Area 5B-4, Baker warned, \"She'll be ready for you, you know.\"  John and Tomas kicked in the doors.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, after Todd stormed in, the man with the scar and with Todd's original face walked out of the kitchen with a sandwich.  When the man with the scar said that his sister was out, Todd exclaimed that she was his sister, but the man stressed \"not for long.\"  Todd declared that just because Viki was letting the man stay at Llanfair did not mean that she believed the man with the scar.\n\n\nTodd revealed that Viki had run off to Paris, Texas; had let two alters resurface; and had even let Tina stay at Llanfair, which would indicate that Viki was not in her right mind.  When the man with the scar declared that Todd had ruined his entire life, David walked in and exclaimed, \"Oh, come on, it was never that good to begin with.\"\n\n\nDavid speculated that only a vengeful, wrathful God would unleash two Todds on the world.  The man with the scar expressed surprise that David Vickers was not dead, especially after the tanning bed accident.  David barked, \"Tanning bed...you think I'm that stupid?  My tan came from a can.  It's fake, just like one of you two.\"\n\n\nDavid studied the two Todds and cried that it was like Parent Trap's Hayley Mills fighting Parent Trap's Lindsay Lohan.  David recognized that a great deal of money was involved.  David then announced that he intended to buy the real Todd's rights to the movie, and that David would play Todd Manning.  David insisted that he was only authorized to deal with the real Todd Manning, so he had found a way to get to the truth.\n\n\nDavid had a foolproof question that only the real Todd Manning could answer.  \"How many pairs of hands, other than my own, did baby Jack pass through before he got back to Todd and Blair?\"  The man with the scar began to answer the question, \"I thought that Jack was Max Holden's kid, so I gave Jack to a Mexican nanny named Polumba.\"  After the two Todds questioned the nanny's name, the man with the scar continued, \"she gave the kid back to Blair,\" and Todd added, \"so I took him to the....\"  The man with the scar interrupted, \"No, I took him to the airport.\"\n\n\nTodd continued with the answer to David, \"pawned him off on a baby broker.\" The man with the scar submitted, \"but the baby showed up again, so I gave Jack to some Mexican nuns,\" and Todd finished the sentence, \"who gave him to you.\"  The man with the scar reminded David, \"Because you said Jack was your adopted love child with your gay lover, Todd.\"  Todd shuddered, \"Still gives me nightmares,\" and the man related, \"Tell me about it.\"  David claimed that he had his answer.\n\n\nThe man with the scar laughed and joked that he was glad to see that some things had not changed, and that David was still a complete idiot.  The man then suggested that they should just ask his mother, who could confirm that they were twins, when Todd noted that Irene was dead.  However, David announced that Irene was not dead.\n\n\nDavid emphasized that one did not need to be alive-alive to be alive, and that one only needed to leave something behind, so that one's memory would endure, such as an Oscar, Emmy, or diary.  When Todd reminded David that David had forged the diary, David insisted that he had only forged a couple of entries, and that the rest of the diary had been authentic.  When the man with the scar wondered if it had mentioned two Todds, David said, \"Well, obviously not, or otherwise I would have posed as both of you.\"\n\n\nDavid then asked the two Todds what they would be willing to pay for the diary.  The man with the scar warned, \"Todds don't bargain,\" and Todd threatened, \"We Todds take.\"  As the two Todds sauntered up to David, who insisted that he was not intimidated, the man with the scar reminded David that he knew where David lived.\n\n\nAfter David left the room, Todd wondered if there was anything in the diary, and the man with the scar hoped so, because it would be the only way to settle it.  The man finally then bit into his sandwich.  When David returned to the room, the two Todds asked if he had retrieved the diary.  David held it out and said, \"It looks like you two are going to have to learn how to share.  Happy Hunting.\"  The Todds glared at the diary, as David laid it on the table. \n\n\n",
