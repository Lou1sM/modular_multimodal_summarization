    "soap_central": "\n Lies and Whispers \n\n\nMarty enlisted John to help her in celebrating the fact that she had gotten her life back, with her reinstatement at the hospital being the icing on the cake. Brody arrived and whispering to John, told him about Sergei watching Cole at the park.  He did his part and came on strong, Brody added, and Cole refused to sell him any more drugs. John told Marty he had to discuss a scheduling problem and excused himself to make a phone call to an unseen party. He wanted to confirm that the file regarding the mayor's drug campaign was on his desk.\n\n\nMarty headed to the jukebox, but cringed when she spotted \"Heart and Soul\" as one of the selections. Confiding to John that she might have been wrong about getting her life back, she admitted to thinking about Todd. She explained the keyboard Todd had purchased for her and the song they had played on it. It was \"their song\" she told him hesitantly. Tearfully, she asked him not to give up on her. John told her it would take time and she needed to follow the same advice she might have given to one of her patients. Grabbing the disk out of the jukebox, he showed her that he was tossing it out.\n\n\nJohn wondered if he and Marty had a song and, in response to her no, he headed to the jukebox to select a song she might like. They began to dance as the strains of  \"Let It Be Me\" by Ray LaMontagne emanated from the jukebox. As their arms tightened around each other, they began to kiss. Suddenly, they stopped, thinking the move unwise. Her eyes tearing up again, Marty told John that she needed to leave. \"We will get there,\" she promised.\n\n\n\"Did you miss me like a plant misses the sun?\" David asked an unsuspecting Viki at Llanfair. She praised him for his hemorrhoid commercial and told him that he had probably helped lots of people with it. As he plied her with questions, she wondered if he was interested in filming a reality show. Outside, Jess spotted a man in the bushes and accusing him of stalking her, clunked him on the head with a flower pot. Hearing the noise, David and Viki rushed out. \"You killed Ford!\" David exclaimed.\n\n\nLearning that Ford was merely scouting locations and checking camera angles for David, and not stalking her, Jessica was apologetic. On the other hand, Viki was upset to learn that someone had been stalking Jessica, and she wanted to call the police. Jessica was relieved when Brody appeared and asked that everyone leave them alone. Viki returned to the study with David, Ford, and the assistant, Priscilla. David assured Viki that they wouldn't sue her for Jessica hitting Ford, but Viki quickly turned the tables, advising him that she wouldn't prosecute for their filming her without permission.\n\n\nDavid ordered the filming to resume and began to question Viki, who remained mum. When he gave  her instructions on where to stand and how to respond, an irritated Viki made it known to David that she wouldn't subject her family to his invasion of their privacy. \"Flat out no!\" she shouted. Continuing his attempt at getting Viki to change her mind, David suggested that perhaps Viki could summon her alternate personalities to make for more interesting television.\n\n\nJessica told Brody what happened and how she needed help if the stalking wasn't real. She forgot to mention to anyone that the person had drawn a heart on the window, though, she recalled. Brody promised to figure things out.\n\n\nLayla and Fish were surprised to find that Cristian was still in the apartment when they arrived home. Layla excused herself to take a shower, and Cristian demanded that Fish stop lying to Layla and tell her the truth. Fish insisted there was nothing to tell, and felt that Cristian was the one who really wanted a relationship with Layla and would be waiting for her. Cristian disagreed and maintained that he simply didn't want Layla hurt. Growling, Cristian advised Fish that he would tell Layla the truth if Fish didn't.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Greg and his date sat down at a table with Shaun and Rachel. Almost immediately, Greg and Rachel had words about Matthew's possible surgery and its risks and consequences. Greg blamed Rachel for teaching Matthew to be afraid. Rachel contended that her brother was more afraid of living his life in a wheelchair and therefore was not thinking clearly. She and Greg accused each other of being control freaks. Rachel thought Greg was condescending, and his date agreed with Rachel's assessment of the doctor. Both women headed for the ladies room and Shaun ordered his brother to \"back off.\"\n\n\nAt the bar, Roxy and Kyle conferred about Fish and the police officer's insistence that his romance with Kyle in college was a phase. Kyle admitted to no longer feeling sorry for Fish, noting that his former lover had made his choice. Cristian arrived to work and joined the conversation. If Kyle had assaulted Fish as Fish claimed, then he would have arrested Kyle, they all agreed. Roxy advised Cristian that Layla would need a good friend once she heard the truth from Fish. Cristian stressed that Layla would call him if she needed him. Kyle explained that Oliver Fish's family was ultra-conservative.\n\n\nLayla was eager to start on her romantic evening with Fish, but he seemed to stall, wanting a shower and something to eat. She reminded him that he had wanted to tell her something, but he assured her it would wait. She wondered if something was wrong, but he swore that everything was fine. She confirmed that they both had incidents in their past lives that they regretted, but suggested that the past stay in the past. As Fish seemed about to respond, the phone rang. His parents were calling and they asked to speak to Layla.\n\n\nShe identified herself as Fish's girlfriend, on his urging, and told them how wonderful their son was. Putting Fish back on the phone, he spoke to them briefly and hung up. Mortified, he told Layla that his parents wanted to visit. They began to kiss and headed to Layla's bedroom. As the kiss continued, Fish momentarily flashed back to his kiss with Kyle. He shrugged it off and stated that nothing was wrong in answer to Layla's question. The pair headed to the bed. A call from Cristian went unanswered.\n\n\nIn the ladies' room at Capricorn, Greg's date apologized for bringing up Matthew's surgery. She confided that it was obvious that Rachel's sparring with Greg looked like foreplay, and she was pretty sure that Greg wanted Rachel. She didn't mind, she added, as her relationship with the doctor was merely casual. She thought that Rachel was into Greg, too, she ended. Rachel considered the woman's thoughts off-base.\n\n\nThe women headed back to the table, and Rachel and Shaun headed for the dance floor. Greg kept his eyes on Rachel, and his date noted that there was something between the two. Greg didn't disagree.\n\n\nLeaving Viki's house, David felt that one of Viki's other personalities had appeared, since she was so mean. Ford stalked off to find a new star. When Jessica was summoned to read Bree a story, Brody looked around. He blew on the window and the heart, which Jessica had mentioned, appeared. Someone looked on from the bushes.\n\n\n",
