A distracted Jessica gave Nash grief at first but then backed off when he reminded her that he'd planned the visit in advance. He played with Brennan for a minute before sensing that something was not right with Jessica. When Nash inquired as to what was wrong, Jessica revealed that she was starting to have memories about her time with Leeds after reading Tess's journal. Jessica believed that she might not be strong enough to deal with what was happening, but Nash told her that she was already dealing with it, which made her stronger than she thought.\n\n\nWhen Nash suggested that Jessica let Tess take over to deal with things, Jessica became angry and threw Nash out, accusing him of trying to lure Tess out. Nash left but then returned telling Jessica that he was taking her to where she could get some help. Before they left, Nash called Antonio and told him to meet them at the hospital, where Nash had arranged for Jessica to speak with Dr. Jamison. Claudia tried to give Nash a shoulder to lean on, but Nash politely sent her away.\n\n\nAntonio went to Bo, and after discussing the incident at the club where he'd saved Claudia, he talked to Bo about getting his badge back. Antonio explained to Bo that although there was nothing he could do to help Jessica, since it was too late, he felt that he could help other children from being exploited by sexual predators. Bo reminded Antonio that the police force did not have a revolving door. Antonio acknowledged that he'd made a mistake by leaving the force in the first place, but he was ready to get his badge back and get back into doing what he loved.\n\n\nBo gave Antonio his badge back and welcomed him back to the police department. As he was leaving Bo's office, Antonio received a call from Nash, asking him to meet Nash and Jessica at the hospital. Antonio arrived and escorted Jessica to her appointment with Dr. Jamison as Nash looked on. \n\n\nAdriana awoke and found herself tied up in her abductor's car. She began to remember running away from Rex then getting a ride from a stranger who had revealed to her right before she'd passed out that it was he and not Rex who had been stalking her. Adriana began to panic and tried to escape, but her abductor thwarted her attempt. Adriana kicked Bruce, which only succeeded in making him mad. He pulled her out of the backseat and put her in the passenger seat before making a call and leaving a message for the person on the other end for them to get back to him as soon as possible.\n\n\nRex found Dorian and demanded to know where Adriana was. Dorian asked Rex why she should tell him anything, since Adriana had run away from him for a reason. Rex admitted that through a misunderstanding, Adriana believed him to be the stalker and that was why she had run from him. When Dorian seemed unfazed with Adriana's disappearance, Rex became suspicious. He accused Dorian of setting him up and making Adriana believe that she had a stalker to keep her away from Rex.\n\n\nDorian admitted to nothing, but Rex already knew the deal and reminded Dorian that Adriana was out there with no cell phone, money, or anything and could seriously be in trouble. Dorian ordered Rex to leave her office and to leave Adriana's well-being to her. After Rex departed, Dorian called Bruce back. He told her that the deal had changed before he hung up on her. Adriana asked Bruce who he'd been talking to, and he told her that she would find out soon.\n\n\nTodd and Blair discussed Starr's condition in the hospital corridor and wondered whether or not they could pretend that they were still engaged for Starr's sake. Todd didn't believe that he could pretend to still be in love with Blair just as he didn't believe that Blair could convince Starr that she was still in love with Todd with Spencer lurking around. Blair told Todd that due to Starr's condition, she couldn't be upset, and she would do whatever it took to help her recover. They both agreed that for the time being until they had the test results back, they would pretend to still be in love. When Blair made a comment about the kiss that she and Todd had just shared, Spencer walked up as if on cue.\n\n\nWhile Todd accompanied Starr to her CT scan, Spencer asked Blair to be straight with him and tell him if she was planning on leaving him for Todd. Blair did her best to convince Spencer that she loved him and was only pretending to be in love with Todd because of Starr's condition. She finally managed to convince Spencer that she loved him, only to have Todd and Starr return while Spencer was caressing her hair. Todd took Blair back into the hallway and blasted her for her display of affection with Spencer after having just said that she would keep up the charade with Todd. He accused her of being thoughtless and selfish. With her parents in the hall arguing, Starr revealed to her friend that she was faking her amnesia.\n\n\nJohn was worried that the picture that Blair had taken of a younger Spencer with the gun that might have killed his father would not be enough evidence to get a search warrant for Spencer's place. John believed that Spencer had hidden the gun in a safe deposit box that he had gotten in his father's name. While discussing with John whether or not the picture Blair had taken of Spencer and his father with the gun was enough to get a search warrant, Natalie revealed that she was on the verge of flunking out of the forensics program. She told John that she hadn't done so well on her exams because she didn't understand some of the material.\n\n\nJohn tried to help Natalie by going over some of the material with her. He asked her why she hadn't told him what was going on. Natalie told John that she'd wanted to handle the situation on her own. When the call arrived that a search warrant would not be issued, Natalie tried to convince John that Blair was the only one who could get the key to the deposit box and that even though it was dangerous, he should ask her, since Blair was determined to take Spencer down with or without police help.\n\n\n",
