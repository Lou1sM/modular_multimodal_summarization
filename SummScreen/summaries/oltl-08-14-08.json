She elusively assured him that there would be hours of entertainment in the room. He couldn't help but notice that there appeared to have been an extra room in the basement in the past, he mentioned to her. She literally told him the truth about the room, the story of a woman with multiple personalities who held someone hostage. Looking scared, Leo relaxed when Tess quickly assured him that she was only joking. Upstairs, Natalie and Jared had a heart-to-heart talk about their relationship and their sharing the bedroom while Viki was out of town. They could hardly believe that they weren't making great use of the bed and wondered if they should even stay at the house. \n\n\nAs Blair gave herself a spa beauty treatment, she daydreamed of John walking in and swooping her into his arms, kissing her passionately. She was disrupted from her dreams abruptly, when Dorian walked into the room instead, wondering if all of the measures were for Todd. Dorian startled her niece when she mentioned that Mel was annoying her and was wondering if Dorian had feelings for Charlie. Blair, quite confused, was certain that Mel was dead. Dorian attempted to explain how she had run into Mel the night of the car accident, when Viki was dead. He made some very valid points about her relationship with Viki, Dorian told a skeptical Blair, who was sure that her aunt had been drinking. \n\n\nAs Roxy spoke to a stuffed Morris at the hotel and expressed her concern about Rex, Charlie walked into the lobby and admitted that he missed Rex, too. He offered to lend an ear for whenever Roxy might want to talk to someone. As she cried on his shoulder, John walked in and Roxy hastily pulled away, citing her ongoing allergy problems. Learning that Bo also appeared to be missing, Roxy wondered if the men were together somewhere. \n\n\nIn 1968, Rex was out cold from Clint's punch, as Professor Fina adamantly tried to convince Bo that they had to leave right away. Clint had other issues in mind, though, as he ordered his father to give him answers on why he sent Maria away. Bo tried to explain how he only wanted to protect his son. When Clint only voiced hope that he would be nothing like his father in the future, Bo hurriedly assured him that he wouldn't be. A throat clearing Fina stopped Bo in a hurry before he said something that he shouldn't, and instead he ordered Clint back to the party and out of his way. Clint, wondering why his father was in a hurry to leave with a stranger, accused Bo of loving only himself and that he even had to pay whores to be with him. As the professor urged Bo to hurry, he grabbed Rex to drag him along, realizing that he could not bear to be Asa for much longer. They successfully arrived at the fence in the storm. \n\n\nIn 2008, Delphina and Gigi arrived at the burned grass and fence. Delphina realized it was the spot of the portal and the place where Rex had been struck by lightning. She lost her connection to the professor, though, and related that Rex was \"horizontal but not injured.\" Gigi lost it when she heard that-and that Rex had been hit by lightning. She accused Delphina of being a phony. She reasoned that if Rex had been struck by lightning, then he was probably in a hospital somewhere. Delphina pointed out all of the coincidences, such as the cell phone recording a call from 1968, even as Gigi yelled at her. \n\n\nNatalie felt obligated to stay at Llanfair and admitted that she was striving to find something to absolve her from the guilt she still felt over Nash's death. She was unable to sleep at all and she noticed that Jared wasn't sleeping, either. He confessed that he couldn't sleep when she was upset and didn't much care to be in a place where everyone hated him. He felt that he should move out and thought it could even be better for them. Natalie would then have somewhere to go when things got to her at the house. \n\n\nBlair assured Dorian that she was indeed over Todd, which caused Dorian to wonder if her niece had a replacement. Blair insisted that she was doing it for herself, to make herself feel good, especially since she was about to become a grandmother. In response to Blair's own questioning, Dorian insisted that she did not have feelings for Charlie and had already sampled Viki's seconds in the past. \n\n\nRoxy handed John some extra towels, noting that she saw Blair leaving his room early in the morning. She contended that she was very happy for him, but tried not to be too eager for details. \n\n\nAfter Bo and Rex left, Clint asked Chuck to help him to locate Maria. Chuck assured him that she was probably long gone. He also suggested that Clint would be hurt by his father again in the future, but he would certainly find a new love some day. \n\n\nBlair couldn't keep quiet and told her aunt that the new man in her life was John McBain. Dorian was thrilled and cited his \"dark, smoldering, sexy quality.\" Blair maintained that they were just friends and that she liked him and his straightforward way. She also pointed out that he had a dark side plus a couple of demons, but she thought he liked her. Dorian suggested that Blair put together a strategy and wondered if Blair and John were friends with benefits. \"Still waters run deep,\" Blair retorted, confirming that she and John had slept together. Dorian wondered why they weren't spending the evening together, but Blair tried to explain that she had no claims on him. \n\n\nJohn, with a sparkle in his eye, mentioned the other chick needing more towels, the handcuffs, and the action with the shoulder holster. Roxy could hardly take it all in as Charlie chuckled. Realizing that John was teasing, she gave him her thumbs up, stating that Blair was a good catch. Charlie again offered to listen to Roxy anytime. She expressed sadness that he really wasn't Rex's father. She thought that Rex himself would be a good dad and hoped that he and Adriana would get back together. \n\n\nWhen Blair's back was turned, Dorian placed a call to John in a British-accented voice, telling him that Blair was calling. She quickly handed the phone to Blair, telling her that John was on the line, and rushed out of the room, giggling. \n\n\nNatalie felt that even though she had been in love in the past, there was something about Jared, even when she hated him when they first met. Jared felt the same and they both admitted to being happy with each other. The pair made love, for the first time in months. Downstairs, Leo promised to return in the morning to start work on the room, after he and Tess finally agreed the room would be for music. Tess confirmed that the person using the room would be \"singing.\" Leo was confused as Tess originally told him it was a room to honor her husband and then it appeared that it was a surprise for her sister. She demanded that he start prep work before the morning hours, so that he wouldn't be seen by anyone. \n\n\nAs Gigi in 2008 and Bo and Rex in 1968 reached the portal at the same time, they were advised to hold onto the fence and hold their cell phones in the air, arms raised. The disbelieving threesome hardly wanted to be struck by lightning and all were consumed with questions. With Rex not wanting to go to Vietnam, and both of the men wanting to get back to Gigi and Matthew, they were first to jump on board. Gigi was dubious and couldn't believe that Delphina wouldn't be joining her due to not receiving enough money for that. Gigi was worried about getting stuck or finding her way back to 2008. Delphina told her to look for Professor Fina for help. She reminded the young woman of her quest to get back to her true love. Finally with hands on fences and arms and cell phones raised, the trio stood in the storm, in different years and endured the lightning hits.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Rex are struggling to get out of 1968 and back to the present and dependent upon the help of Professor Fina while Gigi is struggling to save Rex and dependent upon the help of Madam Delphina. Back in Llanview, Jared and Natalie sense that maybe they should not be living together under the same roof as Jessica, regardless of how cordial she appears. Meanwhile, Jessica is really Tess and is plotting a plan for some sort of \"construction\" work to be done in the basement that will have some sort of \"affect\" upon Natalie and Jared. Blair reveals to Dorian that she is seeing John. There are questions about what happened to Charlie when he was last seen at Dorian's home. And John is still wondering what is up with the mysterious invalid woman whom Todd is hiding in his new place.",
