Assuming that Fish had told Layla that he was gay, Cristian was certain that Layla had kicked Fish out if the apartment.  Relieved, Cristian decided to take the dog for a walk.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside Layla's bedroom, Layla and Fish discussed their incredible night of love-making.  Referring to Cristian as the voice of doom, Layla stated that she was grateful that Cristian had worked the night shift, allowing her and Fish the opportunity to enjoy a night alone in the apartment.  Holding Layla in his arms, Fish remembered Cristian's threat -- either Fish tell Layla that he was gay or Cristian would.    Smiling down at Layla, Fish announced, \"I'm a changed man when I'm with you!\"  Layla responded by giving Fish a passionate kiss.\n\n\nCristian was appalled when he returned home and Layla informed him that she had slept with Fish..  Realizing that Fish hadn't told Layla the truth, Cristian questioned her judgment.  As Cristian nearly blurted out Fish's secret, Fish appeared and interrupted the discussion.  Refusing to continue her argument with Cristian, Layla excused herself, leaving the two men alone.\n\n\nConvinced that Fish was using Layla, Cristian demanded that Fish tell Layla about his sexuality.  Denying that he was gay, Fish stated that Cristian had misunderstood Fish's interaction with Kyle.  Cristian reminded Fish that Cristian had observed Fish and Kyle sharing a passionate kiss.  Fish referred to his past relationship with Kyle as an experiment.   Angered by Cristian's harassment of Fish, Layla returned and suggested that Cristian refrain from interfering in her love life.  Frustrated, Cris stormed out of the apartment.   Alone with Fish, Layla stated, \"You said that you wanted to tell me something.  Is there something I should know before we get any deeper?\"  With a nervous smile, Fish replied, \"You mean a lot to me and last night was perfect.\"\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Todd informed Gigi that he had scheduled a very important meeting at the bar.  Outside the bar, Elijah spoke to someone over the phone.  Elijah informed the caller that he was meeting someone.  Before entering the bar, Elijah stared at a legal document that pertained to T\u00e9a.  Meanwhile, inside the courtroom, T\u00e9a prepared for Matthew's hearing.  \n\n \nTodd phoned, and the two enjoyed a flirtatious conversation.  After acknowledging that he missed her, Todd told T\u00e9a that he was searching for a lawyer who could successfully overturn the judge's decision that ordered him to reside with Blair in order to retain custody of his children.  A curious T\u00e9a asked if Todd had hired anyone she knew.  At that moment, Elijah approached Todd's table.   Claiming that he was merely interviewing candidates, Todd abruptly ended his phone call to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nTodd explained his dilemma to Elijah, who was confident that he could convince the judge to rescind the decision that ordered Todd and Blair to live together.  Elijah assured Todd that Elijah could help Todd gain joint custody of his children.    Todd hired Elijah to represent him on one condition -- Elijah couldn't reveal his new assignment to T\u00e9a Delgado.  When Elijah questioned why Todd wished to keep T\u00e9a in the dark about their newly formed relationship, Todd related that he was romantically involved with T\u00e9a.   Elijah agreed to keep Todd's secret, and headed off to the courthouse to represent Nora and Bo.  Outside of Rodi's, Elijah placed a call to someone and remarked, \"You won't believe who hired me!  Todd Manning!\"\n\n\nBack inside Rodi's, Jack met with Todd.  Certain that his father was up to no good, a wise Jack wondered why Todd had summoned him.   Todd announced his plan to seek joint custody of his children.  Surprised by Todd's decision to cooperate with Blair, Jack questioned whether T\u00e9a was responsible for Todd's change of attitude.  Commenting that T\u00e9a had changed Todd for the better, Jack suggested that Todd do everything possible to make his relationship with T\u00e9a work.\n\n\nA disheveled Roxy entered Rodi's and questioned Gigi about Rex.  Detailing her argument with Rex, Roxy wondered if her son was upset with her.  Stating that Rex had other things on his mind, Gigi revealed that Stacy might possibly be pregnant with Rex's child.  Convinced that Rex wasn't the father, Roxy suggested that Gigi help her get rid of Stacy once and for all.  Gigi informed Roxy that Rex would never abandon his child.  A worried Gigi told Roxy that Stacy intended to use the baby to trap Rex.  Near tears, Gigi stated that there wasn't anything that she could do to stop Stacy.    Roxy reminded Gigi that Rex loved Gigi.  Roxy believed that nothing could keep Rex and Gigi apart.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, a devastated Stacy received a visit from her old friend, Kimmy.  Relieved that her frantic call to Kimmy had been answered, Stacy welcomed her friend.  Kimmy wondered what had sent Stacy into a panic.   After detailing the miscarriage, Stacy claimed that she was too distraught to reveal the truth to Rex.  Blaming Gigi for the miscarriage, Stacy related that her hope of winning Rex's heart had died with the loss of her child.  Upon learning that no one else was aware that Stacy had suffered a miscarriage, Kimmy suggested that Stacy get pregnant again.\n\n\nIn the hall of the courthouse, Nora told Bo that Clint had encountered a problem at work and wouldn't be present at the hearing.  Noticing T\u00e9a inside the courtroom, Nora was convinced that T\u00e9a would expose Nora and Bo's kiss.  Bo smiled and informed Nora that they could face anything together.  Entering the courtroom, Nora and Bo approached T\u00e9a and asked if she intended to use the information against them in court.  Nora and Bo tried to convince T\u00e9a that the kiss had been an innocent gesture.  Enjoying causing Nora and Bo grief, T\u00e9a questioned why they were concerned about her mentioning the kiss, if it had truly meant nothing.\n\n\nBo asked T\u00e9a if she had ever kept a secret in order to prevent hurting someone that she loved.  An angered Nora commented that T\u00e9a didn't care about hurting anyone.  When Nora suggested that T\u00e9a wouldn't enjoy having her own dirty laundry aired, T\u00e9a appeared bothered.   Nora's remark caused T\u00e9a to remember Elijah's warning -- that he would reveal her secret if she exposed Nora and Bo's indiscretion.   Although T\u00e9a insisted that she didn't intend to use the information against them, Nora and Bo were skeptical.  Unable to reason with Nora and Bo, T\u00e9a exclaimed, \"Excuse me while I prepare to win Matthew's case!\"  To T\u00e9a's surprise, Elijah appeared and remarked, \"I doubt that!\"\n\n\nAlone with T\u00e9a, Elijah demanded, \"Drop your case or risk everyone learning the truth about you!\"  Appearing somewhat unsure of herself, T\u00e9a insisted that whatever information Elijah had regarding her had no bearing on Matthew's case.  T\u00e9a assured Elijah that he couldn't blackmail her.   A confident Elijah responded, \"Are you sure about that?  My information has a huge impact on you and your relationship with Todd.\"\n\n\nOut in the hall, while Nora worried about the possible outcome, Bo believed that they had handled the matter appropriately.  Consumed with guilt, Nora stated that she intended to tell Clint about the kiss.  Bo suggested that they keep the truth from Clint. Insisting that he didn't want to hurt his brother, Bo mentioned that Nora appeared happy at her wedding reception.  When Nora assured Bo that she was in love with Clint, Bo stated that his only wish was for Nora to be happy.  Bo was surprised when Nora blurted out that she had almost stopped the wedding.  Bo admitted that he had considered doing the same.\n\n\nAt Capricorn Blair demanded to know what information Rex had uncovered concerning T\u00e9a.  Handing Blair a file on T\u00e9a, Rex mentioned his surprise to learn of the bizarre history that Todd, Blair, and T\u00e9a had shared throughout the years.   Blair acknowledged pushing T\u00e9a out of a window, and mentioned the incident in which T\u00e9a and Todd had been shipwrecked on a deserted island.  Rex revealed that he could find no trace of T\u00e9a's existence following her rescue from the island.  \n\n\nRex said that it appeared that T\u00e9a had ceased to exist up until the time she surfaced in the Colombian prison to represent Ray Montez.  Rex was certain that T\u00e9a was hiding something.  Blair wondered what had happened to Ross Rayburn, the man that Todd had hired to steal Starr and Jack.  Ross had been rescued from the island along with T\u00e9a.  Rex's research revealed that Ross had vanished during the same time as T\u00e9a.\n\n\nWhen Rex criticized the desperate measures that Todd had taken to gain custody of his children, Blair warned, \"Wait until you have a kid and see what you'll do!\"   Rex questioned why Blair was determined to ruin T\u00e9a and Todd.  Rex listened as Blair asked, \"What if someone you didn't like, walked into your life and ruined your family?  Wouldn't you want to do something about it?\"  Rex cautioned Blair that her plan could backfire.\n\n\nAssuming that T\u00e9a had gone into hiding following her rescue, Blair wondered why.   Blair suspected that perhaps T\u00e9a and Ross were in cahoots.  Rex was convinced that T\u00e9a had assumed another identity, but he wasn't sure if he could uncover her motive.  Blair offered to pay him top dollar to discover T\u00e9a's secret.   When Blair scolded Rex about attempting to talk her out of pursuing the investigation, Rex sadly confessed,  \"I know what happens when you hide the truth!\"\n\n\nLater, Cristian arrived at Capricorn.  When Blair commented on his somber mood, Cristian asked, \"Why am I trying to break up a happy couple?\"  A look of guilt crossed Blair's face.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Roxy asked Gigi if Rex was upset with Roxy.  Rex entered the room and suggested that Roxy ask him, instead of badgering Gigi.\n\n \n\n\n",
