After begging her not to scream, Todd apologized for barging in, and expressed his undying love for his daughter. Todd begged Starr to hear him out. Although she wasn't in the mood for any of his antics, Starr allowed her father to speak. Starr listened as Todd continued to apologize for his past misdeeds, but was horrified when he presented her with a voodoo doll of Cole. An angered Starr demanded that her father leave her room at once. \n\n\nMeanwhile, down the hall, Blair sat up in bed and spoke to John over the phone. Blair apologized for the late night call and explained that Dorian had placed the call to John as a prank. As Blair prepared to say goodnight, she was pleasantly surprised when John asked her to pay him a late-night visit. Blair accepted John's invitation without hesitation. She told him that she would be right over after she checked on the kids. \n\n\nTodd begged Starr to reconsider giving her baby away. Citing the pain he faced every day over the loss of Sam, Todd warned Starr that she would regret handing her child over to Marcie. As Starr and Todd became embroiled in a heated argument, Blair knocked on the door. Starr allowed Todd to hide and pretended to be asleep. After Blair had gone, Todd thanked Starr for covering for him and was convinced that she did so out of love for him. Aware that her father was up to his old tricks, Starr suggested that he leave at once. Todd warned Starr to trust him. Starr refused and attempted to give Todd back the voodoo doll. As he exited Starr's room, he handed the doll back to her. In a sarcastic voice he said, \"Keep it! That way you'll have something left of Cole!\" \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Cole and Matthew relaxed and played video games. When Cole began to tease Matthew about his first day of high school, Matthew stated that Starr would protect him from any bullying. Sensing Cole's displeasure over the mere mention of Starr, Matthew apologized for bringing her up and wondered what had transpired between the couple. Cole said that he realized too late that they wanted different things out of life. An emotional Cole told Matthew that although he was certain that he would never mend his relationship with Starr, he still missed her terribly-the same way he missed his parents. Matthew's thoughts turned to Bo. Matthew told Cole that he missed his father and was concerned because he hadn't heard from him in weeks. \n\n\nBack in 1968, Professor Fina advised Bo and Rex to grasp the cell phone tightly and hold it up toward the sky. As volts of lightening charged through them, Fina cautioned them both not to let go. Meanwhile, in the present, Madame Delphina gave Gigi the same warning. Seconds later, Bo, Rex, and Gigi had vanished. \n\n\nMadame Delphina was clueless, but back in 1968, Professor Fina celebrated. Convinced that Bo and Rex had been catapulted back to the present, Fina jumped for joy, but reality set in when he discovered an unconscious Rex nearby. Once Rex regained consciousness, Fina had a difficult time explaining that Bo had made the transition but Rex had been left behind. When the portal opened, Rex had apparently lost his grip on the cell phone, causing him to remain in the past. Realizing that he would be shipped to Vietnam and never reunited with Gigi, Rex panicked. Fina suggested they return to the ranch and figure out their options. Rex was adamant that he would not live the rest of his life as Bo Buchanan. Fina warned him that he might not have a choice. Feeling defeated Rex walked towards the ranch, unaware that Gigi's unconscious body was sprawled on the ground behind him. \n\n\nBack in the present, Madame Delphina found an unconscious Bo lying near the gate. Bo had no recollection of what had taken place the past several weeks. The psychic explained that Gigi had hired her to locate both Rex and Bo. Gigi had been catapulted back in time. Upon learning that Rex was stuck in the past, Bo refused to leave Texas without his friend. Convinced that she could do no more to help Gigi or Rex, Madame Delphina told Bo that his family was worried and advised him to return to them. She stated that Rex and Gigi would have to fend for themselves. Along with Delphina, a shocked Bo walked to the ranch. \n\n\nAt the ranch, Bo placed a call to Matthew. Elated to hear from his father, Matthew asked where he had been and wondered why he had left without giving any notice. Bo apologized to his son. He told Matthew that he loved him and promised never to leave him again. \n\n\nBack in 1968, Gigi regained consciousness and called out for Delphina. Believing she was still in the year 2008 and that Delphina had scammed her, Gigi headed back to the ranch in search of her. \n\n\nMeanwhile, a dejected Rex sat in the hall of the Buchanan ranch. Clint approached Rex and began ranting about Asa sending Maria away. Clint warned Rex to live his own life, not in Asa's image. Clint informed Rex that he was leaving town and would be far from Texas by the time Rex returned home from the service. When Clint mentioned going into the newspaper business, Rex suggested that he head to eastern Pennsylvania. Clint believed that was an excellent idea. Rex sat alone and obsessed about losing Gigi. Consumed in his thoughts, Rex cried out, \"I never got a chance to tell Gigi what she meant to me!\" On the other side of the door, Gigi prepared to knock. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Blair smiled when she encountered John downstairs. The two flirted playfully with one another and then headed upstairs to enjoy the evening.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd comes through the window to Starr's room in an attempt to get her to understand that he wants what is best for her and wants his family back. She is still angry at him but doesn't let Blair know he came by. Blair is seeing John. Bo and Rex are still stuck in 1968 and dependent on the professor to get them back to the present. It looks like Bo has gone back and has been able to get in touch with Matthew. But Rex cannot get back. Gigi is also trying unsuccessfully to find Rex and dependent upon Madam Delphina until she gets struck by lightning and then wakes up in 1968 and she goes to enter the old Buchanan ranch.",
