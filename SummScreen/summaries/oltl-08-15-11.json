She'd thought that Tomas was smarter than to break into the government facility. She warned the men that they'd get jail time if they didn't put their weapons down. As Irene pushed a help button under her desk with her knee, John told Tomas and Brody to tear the office apart for information about Todd or Patrick. He added to Irene that he'd \"taken out\" every man that could respond to the help button. He announced that he was arresting her for attempted murder.\n\n\nIrene realized that she should have killed Tomas \"when I had the chance.\" John began to read Irene her rights, but she stopped him, wondering what he really wanted with her. John demanded to know which man was the real Todd Manning. Irene was sure that John would sort it out. John agreed, because Irene was going to help him. She wondered why she should help him. He replied that no one knew that the men, or Irene were there. He continued that no one would ever know if one of them were killed.\n\n\nJohn told Irene that Tomas was unhappy about all the \"dirty work\" he'd done for Irene. He added that Brody was \"just pissed that he didn't get to shoot Bin Laden.\" Brody grunted in agreement. John said that he could kill Irene, or she could return with them to Llanview to tell everyone what she knew about Todd.\n\n\nMrs. Evans slapped Nora, and demanded to know why Nora thought she'd had a right to mess with Destiny's life. Nora was shocked to learn that Destiny had decided to have the baby. Mrs. Evans told Nora that Nora's guilt-tripping had changed Destiny's mind. Nora thought that Destiny had already had doubts if she'd changed her mind so easily.\n\n\nMrs. Evans told Nora that Destiny had plans for her life, but Nora had expected Destiny to have the baby, and give those plans up. Nora disclosed that she and Bo had offered to raise the baby, and that Destiny could be as much of a part of the baby's life as she wanted. Nora apologized for interfering, and offered to talk to Destiny. Mrs. Evans told Nora that Destiny had already changed her mind, and that there was no time left for an abortion.\n\n\nNora tearfully apologized for her part in Destiny's change of heart. Mrs. Evans replied that, as sorry as she was that Destiny had to go through such tough decisions, Mrs. Evans was glad to have her daughter back. \"How wonderful for you,\" Nora responded. Mrs. Evans told Nora that the Evans family prayed for Matthew every night, and assured her not to give up hope. Nora hoped that she and Mrs. Evans could learn to get along, since they were both going to be grandparents of Destiny and Matthew's baby. Mrs. Evans only wanted to concentrate on getting Destiny ready to have the baby.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Starr was practicing a song when Baz entered. She asked about his trip to Paris. He told Starr that his mother had been trying to convince him that Tomas was dangerous. He continued that Tomas had also left him a lot of messages, probably trying to tell Baz that his mother was crazy. Starr, knowing what Tomas wanted to tell Baz, updated Baz on what had been happening with the two Todds.\n\n\nStarr recapped the events for Baz, who wanted to start working in order to give Starr a distraction. She related that she had plenty of distractions thanks to James. She admitted to telling James that Baz had kissed her. She continued that she'd told James that the kiss hadn't meant anything to her, so James hadn't been worried about it. She revealed that it had gotten Starr and James closer, and Baz realized what she meant. He thought that James was a \"lucky guy.\"\n\n\nBaz wondered if Starr still wanted to make music. \"Why do you think I'm here?\" she replied. It was \"just work\" to Starr. He asked about the song she'd been singing when he'd arrived, which she informed him that Langston had written. Baz admired Starr as she sang the song again. He wanted to make a few tweaks to the song, but thought it was almost ready to record. Starr replied that music helped her to forget about everything else.\n\n\nDani asked T\u00e9a when the results of the second DNA test would be ready. T\u00e9a hoped that it would be soon, and regretted how confused Dani was. Dani replied that everyone was confused. There was a knock on the door, and T\u00e9a answered it to Blair. Blair wanted to talk about the \"Todd situation.\" Dani wanted to go see Destiny anyway, so she left.\n\n\nDani walked outside, and was surprised to find Destiny. Dani wondered why Destiny wasn't at home, resting. Destiny confessed that she hadn't had the abortion. Dani asked why, and was surprised to learn that Nora had been a factor. Dani wondered what Destiny wanted, as opposed to what Nora wanted. \"I want Matthew back,\" Destiny replied.\n\n\nDani had many more questions, but Destiny didn't know what would happen, because she'd just made the decision. She only knew that \"the baby won't grow up like we did.\" She vowed that the baby would know both of its parents. Speaking of parents, Dani realized that she hadn't told Destiny about anything that had been going on. Dani explained the Todd situation to Destiny, and Destiny couldn't believe it.\n\n\nDani had been on her way to get food for Destiny. She invited Destiny to the Buenos Dias with her, unless Destiny wanted to stay at home. Dani was happy to know that Destiny was back living with her parents. She wondered how Mrs. Evans had felt about Destiny's decision to keep the baby. Destiny told Dani that Mrs. Evans had been surprised, but she was behind her daughter. \"She's not the only one,\" Dani replied, and the two set off for the Buenos Dias arm-in-arm.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wondered if Blair knew something that T\u00e9a didn't. Blair said that Tomas had promised to figure out what was been going on. She filled T\u00e9a in on everything Tomas had told her about being an assassin, which completely shocked T\u00e9a. Blair also told T\u00e9a that Tomas had gone with John to find out what was going on. Both women wondered how they couldn't tell which man was the real Todd. Each wanted to know what the other's kids thought. They shared that Dani and Starr didn't know what to think, but that Jack was \"one hundred percent\" behind the man they'd called Todd for the last eight years.\n\n\nT\u00e9a suggested that they'd wanted Todd back so badly that they'd seen what they'd wanted to see. Blair had gotten to know Todd as Walker, but hadn't even thought about any differences once she'd found out that he was Todd. Looking back, T\u00e9a divulged that Todd had been different in bed. She knew that Todd once had intimacy issues, and had never been comfortable in bed. However, the more recent Todd \"sleeps like the dead,\" and couldn't get enough sex.\n\n\nBlair related that the man with the scar hadn't seemed to have intimacy issues when he'd kissed her. She updated a curious T\u00e9a on what had happened after T\u00e9a had left the premiere. Blair continued that the kiss had felt familiar, but her kiss with T\u00e9a's husband had also felt familiar. T\u00e9a, getting angry, demanded to know when Blair had kissed Todd, and why. T\u00e9a had thought that Blair was done with \"both Todds.\" Blair called T\u00e9a paranoid, but T\u00e9a thought that Blair was desperate for a man.\n\n\nScreaming, Blair and T\u00e9a pushed each other. Blair ran towards the door as T\u00e9a yelled at her to leave. The fighting continued until Tomas burst through the door, and separated the women. Both tried to tell Tomas that the other had \"lost it.\" Blair wondered if Tomas had found any answers. He hadn't yet, but admitted that he'd found someone who had some information.\n\n\nTodd and the man with the scar both sat staring at Irene's diary. Both got up and ran to the diary, but Todd got to it first. Todd held it away from the man, who wondered if Todd didn't want the man to see the diary because it would prove that Todd wasn't really Todd. The man distracted Todd with his sandwich, and grabbed the diary. The two fought over it as Viki entered, and told them to stop.\n\n\nViki asked the men to be quieter because Clint was getting settled into the house. She demanded to know what they had been arguing over, and they showed her Irene's diary. Wide-eyed, she asked to see it, so the man handed her the diary. She flipped through the diary, and read an entry out loud about Irene's affair with Victor. She kept flipping through, and found an entry from Irene's second pregnancy. Both men eagerly attempted to read over her shoulder. She told them to stop hovering, and ordered them to sit down.\n\n\nViki read aloud about Irene giving baby Todd to Peter and Bitsy. Irene had been glad that she could give a good life \"to one of my kids.\" After scoffing at Irene's thoughts of a good life for Todd with Peter, Viki, Todd, and the man speculated on what Irene had meant when she'd written \"one of my kids.\" Going on, Viki read that Irene missed Todd, \"but I'm happy that I still have...\" Both  men demanded to know how the sentence was finished, but Viki revealed that it looked like the next page had been deliberately cut out.\n\n\nTodd and the man argued about the missing page, but Viki thought that there was no point in arguing. Viki figured that they'd never know what was on the page, and that it was something Irene had taken to the grave. The doorbell rang, and Viki instructed the men not to talk to each other while she was gone. \"God help me if you are both my brothers,\" she said as she handed the diary to the man.\n\n\nViki opened one of the double doors to John and Brody. She opened the other to reveal a woman. A shocked Viki marveled at how much the woman looked like Irene.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "It's still an unsolved mystery as to who is the real Todd manning, whether the \"two\" Todds are twins or which, if either is an imposter. John, Brody and Tomas go to find Irene and tell her they can get her charged with murder and shut her down if she does not return to Llanview with them and answer their questions. Viki concludes to both men that if they cannot find in Irene's diary, what her big secret is regarding the birth of her individual or twin sons, then she's taken it to the grave and they will never know. But when she least expects it, John and Brody ring her doorbell and present Irene to her. Blair and T\u00e9a are both uncertain at to which of the two men is the real Todd and get into a brawl over which of them could \"have\" Todd if he had a choice. Destiny's mom, Phylicia, goes to confront Nora for her having the gall to talk Destiny out of having an abortion by milking he \"keep Matthew\" alive upon her. She tells Nora that being a teen mom will affect the rest of her daughter's life. Nora apologizes and is ready to tell Destiny she's ok if Destiny would prefer to abort. But Felicia tells Nora it's too late. They will be the mutual grandmothers of a baby they had never planned on.",
