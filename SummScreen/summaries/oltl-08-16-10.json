Jess mentioned Ford's hepatitis C test, and Ford demanded to know how she'd found out. \"You just told me,\" she said. Jess knew he would have gotten tested if they had sex and asked him the question again. He finally admitted that they did, and asked if she was going to tell Brody. Jess wondered why he'd lied. Ford admitted that he didn't want Brody to kill him, and that he thought Jess would cry rape. He already had \"some dude\" bash his head in; he didn't need Brody after him as well. \"Dude? I thought it was Hannah O'Connor,\" Jess said.\n\n\nFord claimed it was a slip of the tongue and went back to the subject. Jess couldn't believe that she'd let Ford touch her, and asked if they had used a condom. Ford confessed that he thought Jess had birth control covered and apologized, saying that it was over. Jess proved him wrong, informing him that she was pregnant. Jess said that she believed the baby was Brody's. She instructed Ford to forget that she had been at his apartment, and that they had ever slept together. He agreed and she left.\n\n\nTodd and Dani sat at a table in Rodi's and Dani asked if it was Todd and T\u00e9a's place. Todd told her they didn't really have a place, so Dani said Rodi's could be her place with her father. It was good because there would be \"no reminders\" of her mother. Just then, a man walked up, and Todd asked if he had found T\u00e9a. The man admitted that he had lost them, and that they were probably pros. Todd was surprised to learn that there was someone helping his wife. Todd fired the man on the spot and reasoned that T\u00e9a must have known that Todd would hire someone to follow her.\n\n\n\"You don't trust each other?\" Dani wondered. Todd countered by informing his daughter that they trusted each other to not give up on each other. The two knew they needed a new plan. Putting money on the table, Todd told Dani he had something to show her, and they left. Todd spread a blanket on the roof and Dani wondered if they were having a picnic. He explained that they were going to watch the meteor shower. They lay down on the blanket and watched. Dani grabbed her father's hand as she said, \"Goodnight, mom.\"\n\n\nAt St. Kitts hospice, Greg made sure that T\u00e9a was all right. She was, but she wanted to verify with Shaun that Todd couldn't track her down. Shaun assured her he wouldn't let her down. T\u00e9a thanked him for his help. Shaun knew it was none of his business, but if he were in T\u00e9a's situation, he'd want his family next to him. Greg thought she was doing the brave thing, and said he would be there to help her. Greg left as Shaun helped her get settled, and T\u00e9a looked at a picture of Todd and Dani.\n\n\nShaun couldn't believe that his brother was going along with what T\u00e9a wanted, but admitted that his brother also wasn't very good at being a family man. Shaun gave T\u00e9a his card and told her to call if she needed anything, or if she changed her mind and wanted Todd and Dani there. Greg entered and told Shaun his taxi was there. T\u00e9a told Shaun that she hoped Destiny and Dani would be friends for a long time, so she knew that Shaun would always watch over Dani. Shaun promised to anyway. Shaun hugged T\u00e9a and left with Greg. Later, Greg informed T\u00e9a that Shaun had safely made his flight and told her to let her know if she needed anything else. She thanked him, closed the door, and went outside to watch the meteor shower.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair sat down and opened the book about Dani that T\u00e9a had written out for her. Eli walked in, and she put it down, noticing that something was wrong with her fianc\u00e9. She asked what was wrong, and he answered, \"John McBain.\" He explained how Hannah had tried to kill herself and that he went to St. Anne's, wanting to talk to her, but John wouldn't let him. John had then proceeded to question Eli like he was a criminal. Blair confessed that she knew why John was all over Eli.\n\n\nBlair explained that Kelly and John believed that John was involved in Melinda's murder. Eli wondered if that was the reason why he and Blair hadn't eloped. Blair admitted that there were more reasons than just that. Eli asked Blair if she believed Kelly, but Blair wanted to know if Eli was concerned about John. Eli wasn't, but still wanted an answer to his question. Blair knew it was impossible that Eli had anything to do with Melinda's murder. She informed him that there was no evidence, anyway, to Eli's relief.\n\n\nEli told Blair that he had nothing to hide as he opened his briefcase with T\u00e9a's will on top. Eli took his passport and I.D.s out of his briefcase, explaining that he wanted Blair to hire a private investigator to check him out. Blair didn't want to because she trusted his word, even though people close to her were telling her not to. As Blair looked in Eli's briefcase, his phone rang. It was Greg. Eli asked him if T\u00e9a was there, and Greg assured him that she was all settled in. Eli was satisfied to know that everything was going according to plan.\n\n\nOn the phone with Dorian at Rodi's, Clint reminded her that he wanted the stadium named after him because he was sick of pretending to be with her. Dorian promised he would get what she promised. Also at Rodi's, David was on the phone with Mandy. She wanted her money as soon as possible.\n\n\nMandy hung up and rang the doorbell at La Boulaie. Dorian answered and said she knew Mandy was pretending to be in love with David. As Mandy eyed Dorian's jewelry, Dorian said David couldn't afford Mandy, who accused Dorian of being jealous. Later, Dorian held out a stack of bills and a tape recorder as Mandy wore Dorian's jewels. Dorian reminded Mandy to enunciate.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, David ordered Clint to admit that he wasn't in love with Dorian because he would tell Clint what had happened to Kim. Clint accused David of being jealous, but wanted to know what David did to Kim anyway. David made Clint promise not to kill him because Bo would arrest Clint. David explained that he was protecting the family name and fortune, and that everything was on the flash drive in his hand. As Clint asked where Kim was, David told him to figure it out and held a tape recorder in front of Clint's face.\n\n\nLater, Clint left after telling David not to leave town because Clint would probably have questions. Dorian entered and smugly played the tape of Mandy saying, \"David Vickers hired me to pretend we were in love, only he's cheap and doesn't pay.\" David played his tape of Clint saying, \"Dorian promised to help me get the new stadium named after the Buchanans if I pretended to be in love with her.\" As the two declared their hate for each other, they got closer and shared a kiss.\n\n\nJohn didn't think that Hannah had tried to kill herself and asked if she'd had a visitor. Hannah lied that she didn't remember much. John wanted to help her and asked her to start from the beginning. Hannah wondered why John didn't want her dead for what she'd done to Marty, but John wanted to know what else Eli had told her. Hannah wanted him to leave her alone, but he kept asking questions. She finally said that it wasn't her that Eli was threatening.\n\n\nHannah admitted that Eli had threatened to kill Cole if she talked. She explained how Eli had held a gun to her and forced her to take the pills. He would have killed Cole if she hadn't. Hannah also divulged that she had seen Eli push Marty down the stairs, but she was the only one who'd seen it. John clarified that Hannah never thought it was Todd. Hannah said that she only said it was Todd because she knew it would break Starr and Cole up.\n\n\nJohn promised her that she had given him good information and that nothing would happen to Cole. Hannah knew her word wouldn't mean anything against Eli's, since she was the only one that had seen him push Marty, that heard Eli threaten Cole, and that heard him tell her to take the pills. She knew no one would believe her, but John said he believed her. John wouldn't tell anyone he had been there and informed Hannah that there was someone else he could ask for the truth.\n\n\nNatalie walked into the living room of Llanfair to find Brody looking at the things from when Jess was pregnant with Bree. She asked if he was making plans for the baby. Brody asked if she was making plans for \"our\" baby as Viki walked in. Viki congratulated Brody on the baby and the engagement and assured him that she approved. She warned him that she wanted a house full of grandchildren and thanked him for not giving up on Jess. As Brody explained that he and Jess wanted a simple wedding, Viki noticed that Natalie looked pale. Natalie told her mother she was pregnant too. Brody looked sick as Viki gushed to Natalie about how happy she was.\n\n\nJess entered and told Brody she was done at work. Noticing there was a celebration, Jess offered Natalie some champagne, but Natalie admitted to her sister that she was pregnant and had found out the same day Jess did. Jess wondered why Natalie hadn't told her. Natalie said that she thought Jess and Brody deserved the spotlight, but Jess told her sister that the spotlight was big enough for the two of them.\n\n\nClint entered, and Brody asked for his blessing to propose to Jess. Clint gave it to him, and Brody was happy because he had already proposed. Clint congratulated them, but Jess informed her father that congratulations were in order for Natalie too. Natalie told her father she was pregnant. \"It's John's, I assume?\" joked Clint. Natalie assured him it was. Clint got up to make a toast to his big -- \"and getting bigger\" -- happy family.\n\n\n",
