Natalie expressed how worried she was about Rex. Roxy said she knew, but Natalie revealed that Rex believed that Gigi was still around. Natalie explained about the meeting with Madame Delphina, and Roxy approved the decision to call Delphina. Natalie told Roxy about Gigi's apparent message of \"spotted pony,\" but both were confused as to the meaning. Roxy believed that it had to mean something, but Natalie thought that Delphina had been \"off her game.\"\n\n\nNatalie confessed to Roxy that Delphina had also said something about Natalie's relationship with Brody. She didn't know what Delphina had meant, but it hadn't sounded good. Roxy worried for Natalie, but Natalie assured Roxy that she and Brody were fine. Natalie was just sorry that Delphina couldn't help Rex.\n\n\nRoxy revealed that she'd just been thinking about Gigi, and how she'd been running around getting ready for her wedding. Roxy had given Gigi a tape recorder she'd found, because she'd thought that Gigi could listen to whatever music was on it. Natalie related that the tape recorder, which had turned out to be hers, had a blank tape in it. Roxy knew that it hadn't been blank when she'd had it. Natalie disclosed that John had practically accused Brody of erasing the tape. Natalie didn't think that anything mattered, because Marty was gone, and Liam was safe. Roxy thought Natalie's lack of memory had been eating Natalie alive.\n\n\nNatalie had to go meet Brody, and mentioned to Roxy that she and Brody were looking for a place together. Roxy was happy for Natalie, but urged her to figure out Delphina's message. Natalie wasn't worried about it. Roxy told Natalie that she liked Brody, but she truly believed that Natalie and John belonged together. She knew that John wasn't yet over Natalie.\n\n\nDorian entered her living room, and found the room a mess. She began screaming about calling the police, because she'd been robbed. David entered and admitted that he'd made the mess. He told her about how he'd had to find Irene's diary in order to give it to the two Todds. Dorian reminisced that \"that diary brought us together,\" because a faked entry had gotten her acquitted of murder charges. She began to unbutton his shirt, and said that she was glad she had locked the doors to the living room.\n\n\nA short while later, David answered the ringing phone, to Dorian's dismay. He had a short conversation, and hung up. He told Dorian that it had been his agent on the phone, who needed to see him. Dorian wanted to go with him, but David wanted to go alone. He told his wife that the agent \"has a thing for me.\" If Dorian weren't at the meeting, the agent would think she had a shot with David, and therefore work harder for him. Feigning acceptance, Dorian let him go. In exchange, David gave her a headshot signed with his new pen.\n\n\nWhen David was gone, the phone rang again. \"Okay, bitch, he's on his way!\" Dorian answered angrily. The agent wasn't on the other end, but it seemed to be someone important. Dorian assured the person on the phone that she was listening.\n\n\nViki was shocked to see Irene, alive, in her foyer. \"Long time no see,\" Irene replied. John, Brody, and Irene followed Viki as she made her way toward the living room.\n\n\nThe man with the scar shook out Irene's diary for the missing page. Todd thought that the man was just wasting time by looking. John, Brody, and Irene followed Viki into the living room. Todd held the old picture of Viki and Irene, and was confused to realize who was standing in front of him. Viki said that the last time she'd seen Irene had been when Irene had left Tina with Viki, because Irene had been dying of cancer. Irene admitted that she'd only wanted to give her daughter a better life. She'd wanted to reunite two sisters, and was happy that two brothers had been reunited as well.\n\n\nTodd and the man wanted the truth. Irene admitted to giving birth to a set of identical twin boys. When Victor had first found out about the second pregnancy, he hadn't wanted anything to do with Irene, or the children. He'd cut Irene off completely, leaving her alone, and unable to afford caring for a child. When she'd had twins, she'd given the one she'd named Todd to Peter Manning, in order to give the child a better life.\n\n\nIrene had raised the one named Victor Jr. by herself. Viki wondered if it was the first time that Irene had been with both boys since they'd been born. Irene confessed that it wasn't. During Irene's story, Brody informed John that there was backup outside. John thanked Brody for the help, and told him to go home, so Brody left.\n\n\nIn the nursery, Kelly was watching over Liam when Joey entered. He talked about Clint until Kelly started to cry. At Joey's worrying, she insisted she was fine. She missed Zane, and was sad that she'd missed so much of his life. She didn't want to miss anything else, so she told Joey that she'd decided to leave Llanview.\n\n\nA shocked Joey wondered what would happen to his relationship with Kelly, since they'd just gotten back together. Brody entered, and apologized for interrupting. He picked Liam up, and Kelly advised Brody to enjoy every moment he had with his son. He promised to follow the advice, and left. Continuing the conversation, Kelly regretted having to put the relationship on hold. She knew that Joey needed to stay with his father. Joey related that Clint had always wanted Joey and Kelly together.\n\n\n\"Now that I have you,\" Joey started, \"I'm not going to let you go again.\" Joey decided to go with Kelly to London, which made Kelly very happy. Joey wanted to tell Clint the good news. Kelly related how tough telling Dorian would be.\n\n\nA short while later, Kelly arrived at La Boulaie as Dorian hung up the phone. Kelly said that she had something to tell Dorian. Dorian was glad that Kelly was there, because she had something to tell Kelly as well.\n\n\nJohn's phone rang, and he answered it as the conversation continued. Desperate for a job, Irene had met a CIA agent, who'd gotten her involved in the CIA. She was explaining how she'd quickly \"climbed the ladder,\" when John announced the matter of his phone call. The second DNA test had backed up the findings in the first DNA test. John wondered how the men had the same memories, but Irene thought she would feel more comfortable speaking openly with John out of the room. With no one noticing, John set a tape recorder down on a table, and left the room.\n\n\nAs Brody walked down the stairs, he assured Liam that he wouldn't let Todd tell anyone about Liam being John's son. Brody bumped into John in the foyer, and John hadn't realized that Brody had moved back into Llanfair. Brody admitted to John that he and Natalie had decided to move in together. Changing the subject, Brody wondered which man was the real Todd, but John didn't know. Brody had to change Liam's diaper, so he went back up the stairs.\n\n\nA short while later, Brody put Liam back into his crib. He assured Liam that he'd erased Marty's session tape, so no one would find out that Liam was John's son.\n\n\nNatalie entered Llanfair and found John sitting in the foyer. He told Natalie that he was there to get answers about Todd. Natalie related that she needed answers. Since the Gigi Morasco case was closed, Natalie wondered if the tape recorder that was being held in evidence could be released to her. Even though she knew John would think she was crazy, she admitted that she needed it for a meeting with Madame Delphina. The psychic needed something to \"connect her with the spirit world.\" Natalie thought it might help her remember what had been on the tape she had almost died to get.\n\n\nAubrey and Cutter got drinks at Capricorn, and discussed how humiliating it had been to get thrown out of the Vicker Man premiere. Aubrey regretted that she hadn't gotten to find a new \"catch.\" Looking behind Aubrey, Cutter spotted Rex, and suggested that he would be a good mark. Rex had gotten all of Clint's money and holdings, and he'd stolen the Buchanan mansion from Cutter.\n\n\nCutter told Aubrey it would be perfect as long as Aubrey didn't fall in love with the mark again. Aubrey refused to hit on Rex, since he'd just lost Gigi. Cutter reasoned that Rex was probably lonely and \"desperate for a pretty shoulder to cry on.\"\n\n\nRex told Shane over the phone that he was all right, but he had work to do. Rex hung up, and typed \"spotted pony\" into the search bar on his computer. Cristian walked over to Rex, and handed him a large, rolled-up piece of paper. He'd been meaning to give it to Rex. Rex unrolled the paper and found a self-portrait of Gigi. Cristian thought that Gigi had had a lot of talent.\n\n\nRex asked if there was a wireless printer at the bar, which Cristian confirmed. Rex printed some pages, and looked at Gigi's drawing. Aubrey walked up behind Rex, and told him that Gigi had been beautiful. \"She still is,\" he replied. A short while later, Cristian handed Rex a stack of papers. As Rex looked through the papers, Aubrey thought that he looked frustrated. She offered to buy him a drink, but he needed to concentrate. When Aubrey was gone, Rex looked around the bar. He saw Gigi standing in a corner of the room.\n\n\nGigi walked away, and Rex immediately ran after her. Rex bumped into David, who was entering the bar, and dropped all of his papers. Rex returned a short while later, and blamed David for making Rex miss Gigi. Rex said that he needed to find the right Spotted Pony establishment. David recognized the name, and Rex asked if it meant something to David.\n\n\nAubrey returned to Cutter, who wondered when she was going to see Rex again. He already had a plan to get his mansion back. Aubrey was distressed because she seemed to be losing her touch. She hadn't wanted to \"seduce a guy in mourning\" anyway. Cutter thought that Joey had ruined Aubrey's confidence, but Aubrey just didn't want to hurt another nice guy. She reasoned that Rex was preoccupied with his fianc\u00e9e and his \"spotted pony\" research project anyway. Cutter seemed to recognize the name.\n\n\nIrene revealed that, after a while, she had no longer made enough money to support her and Victor. Therefore, she'd agreed to do special work for the CIA. She'd been keeping close tabs on Todd, and was surprised that Victor Lord had left Todd thirty million dollars in his will. She'd wanted to get the same for Victor Jr., but that would have required her to explain where she'd been, and what she'd been doing. She'd realized that Todd could be useful to her in other ways.\n\n\nIrene explained about how she had sent people to make a business deal with Todd, on the promise of Todd helping his country. Both men who claimed to be Todd remembered denying the deal. The man said that he'd figured out that the money was going to a rogue government organization. Irene continued that she'd instructed a CIA agent to \"eliminate\" Todd. Viki was appalled that Irene had ordered her own son to be killed. Irene explained that she'd long since stopped thinking of Todd as her son, because of the man she'd seen him turn into.\n\n\nIrene continued that Tomas had found Todd beaten nearly to death, but he'd delivered Todd to Irene. Neither man remembered being taken to Irene, but she remembered being together with both of her sons. She remembered having Todd tell her and Victor all about his life. She had gotten Victor to take on all of Todd's memories in order to become Todd. She said that Victor had learned everything there was to know about Todd's life, so that even he believed he was really Todd.\n\n\nIrene revealed that the two men had been identical, except for the scar on the cheek. She'd given Victor a scar on his cheek just like Todd's. Viki wondered how the two men had different faces, and demanded to know which man was really Todd.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Irene goes to face Viki and her \"two\" sons to tell the entire story of her pregnancy, birth of her \"twins\", how she gave up one and put him to use working for the CIA and then conspired to have him killed. And that is how original Todd turned into the completely different face of current Todd in 2003. She also speaks about how she was able to brainwash and program them both so that they have the \"same memories\" and the same lives and each believes that only he is Todd Manning. Brody goes upstairs to see \"his\" baby and reveals, privately to Liam that he has destroyed the tape that reveals that Marty switched the DNA so that people falsely believe Liam is Brody's when in fact he is John's. Downstairs, Natalie finds John, still not consciously aware of what was revealed on the tape nor having any clue that her baby is John's and not Brody's. But Roxy has urged her to find out the secret about what is revealed on the tape and seems to know that there is something Natalie has to realize regarding John. Delphina has also made a comment about that. Yet neither Natalie or John or anyone else have a clue that Liam is John's son.",
