Stunned by Bo's admission, Nora claimed that she considered stopping the wedding because she didn't want to have the kiss that she shared with Bo looming over her head.  When Nora stated that their kiss meant nothing, Bo questioned why they were keeping a meaningless secret from Clint.  Before Nora could respond, Matthew arrived to attend the hearing.  \n\n\nNora and Bo asked to speak to their son before the hearing, but Matthew was reluctant.   Relating that they were aware that Matthew had tried to prevent their secret from being exposed in court, Nora and Bo thanked Matthew for doing his best to protect them.  Admitting that he didn't want to hurt Clint or his parents, Matthew stated that his only wish was to walk again.\n\n\nInside the courtroom, Elijah urged T\u00e9a to convince Matthew to drop his case against his  parents.  When T\u00e9a refused to give in to his demands, Elijah boasted, \"I know the secret that you're keeping from Todd Manning!\"   T\u00e9a demanded to know what information Elijah had that pertained to her.  Elijah assured T\u00e9a that Todd wouldn't be pleased to learn the information that she was withholding  from him.  Todd phoned T\u00e9a and interrupted the conversation.  T\u00e9a nearly panicked when Elijah asked to speak with Todd.  T\u00e9a abruptly ended the call. \n\n\nEnraged, T\u00e9a screamed, \"You're bluffing.  You don't know anything about me!\"  Presenting T\u00e9a with the legal document that pertained to her,  Elijah teased, \"What do you think now?\"  Observing T\u00e9a's nervous demeanor, Elijah asked, \"Ready to play ball?\"  As Matthew, Nora, and Bo entered the courtroom, a terrified T\u00e9a stared at the file that contained her personal information.\n\n\nWhen the judge instructed T\u00e9a to give her opening statement, Elijah smiled as a nervous T\u00e9a reported that she hadn't prepared a statement for the court.  Obviously flustered, T\u00e9a stated that there was nothing she could say that would win the case for her client.  Certain that he had convinced T\u00e9a to cooperate, Elijah smiled.  Instead, T\u00e9a shocked everyone when she called Matthew to the stand.  T\u00e9a announced that Matthew would present his own case before the judge.  Elijah didn't appear pleased by the sudden turn of events.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Cristian admitted to Blair that he had witnessed  Fish involved in a compromising position with a man.  Relating that Fish had slept with Layla afterward, Cristian wondered if he should tell Layla the truth.  Startled by the revelation, Blair had no advice for Cristian.  Desperate for help, Cristian asked Blair if she would interfere if she knew that Todd was involved with a woman who could hurt him.  Recalling her conflict with T\u00e9a and Todd, Blair stated that she had to protect her children from T\u00e9a's influence.  \n\n\nRealizing that Blair was angry with T\u00e9a, Cristian wondered if Blair still had feelings for Todd.  Insulted by Cristian's suggestion, Blair said that Cristian wanted to expose Fish's secret because Cristian had feelings for Layla.  Claiming that he was only concerned about Layla's emotional state, Cristian stated that he didn't envy Blair's predicament.  \n\n\nTapping her file that contained Tea's personal history, Blair remarked, \"T\u00e9a shouldn't be a problem much longer!\"   Todd entered the club and overheard Blair's  comment.  Todd demanded to know the meaning behind Blair's statement.  When Blair refused to provide him with an explanation, Todd attempted to seize the file from Blair.  After an intense struggle, Todd obtained possession of the file.  Upon realizing that Blair had investigated T\u00e9a's background,  Todd demanded, \"What the hell are you up to?\"\n\n\nAt the gym, Fish approached Kyle and apologized for his behavior the previous night.  Insisting that their romantic relationship during college was an experiment, Fish claimed that he was happy with Layla, and begged Kyle to accept his decision.  Mentioning that he had slept with Layla, Fish was adamant that he had a future with her.  Hurt to learn that Fish had slept with Layla, Kyle told Fish that their romantic relationship in college was the most meaningful relationship that Kyle had ever had.  Kyle reminded Fish that he had  claimed to love Kyle once.   Stating that he didn't care how much Fish pretended to care for Layla, Kyle insisted that Fish had responded favorably to the kiss that Kyle had shared with him.  \n\n\nSensing that Fish was troubled, Kyle agreed to stay away from Fish if Fish promised to meet with Kyle one last time.  Commenting that Fish appeared to be experiencing a difficult time, Kyle stated that he merely wanted to help his old friend.  Inching close to Fish, Kyle lovingly rubbed Fish's shoulders and said that he didn't want to see his friend hurt.  While Fish and Kyle shared a special moment, Fish panicked when Cristian appeared and witnessed their intimate  exchange.  \n\n\nShoving Kyle away, Fish denied that anything had occurred.  Convinced that Fish was lying, Cristian demanded to know what had taken place between the two men.  Fish was terrified when Kyle attempted to answer.  To Fish's surprise, Kyle announced that Fish wasn't gay.  Kyle apologized and insisted that he had made a mistake about Fish's sexuality.  As he walked away, Kyle told Cristain that Fish was in love with Layla.  Unconvinced, Cristian warned Fish not to hurt Layla.  Later, as he watched Kyle flirt with a guy at the gym, Fish breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Kimmy listened as a defeated Stacy gave up all hope of claiming Rex.  Reminding Stacy that she was a fighter, Kimmy encouraged  Stacy to find someone else to impregnate her.  Determined to help her friend, Kimmy constructed a list of potential candidates.  \n\n\nPlacing Schuyler at the top of the list, Stacy cautioned Kimmy that Schuyler had developed serious feelings for Gigi.  Stacy was uncertain that she could convince Schuyler to have sex with her again.  Although she was able to recall her sexual encounter with Fish, Stacy couldn't remember his name.  Referring to him as Tuna, Stacy added him to the list.  Stacy chose Kyle as candidate number three.  Recounting the incident in which she attempted to bribe him with sex, Stacy related that Kyle had appeared to have no interest in her.  Studying her list, Stacy laughed, \"So boys, which one of you are going to make me pregnant with Rex's child?\"\n\n\nGreg paid Rachel a visit at the drug rehabilitation center.  Realizing that Rachel hadn't gotten over the argument they had the previous night, Greg tried to apologize, but Rachel   was in no mood to make peace.  Denying that she was upset, Rachel argued that Greg didn't know her very well.   With a sly grin, Greg drew her close and said, \"No, but I would like to!\"  After Rachel had calmed down, Greg wondered why their encounters always ended in an argument.  Rachel told Greg that Vivian had suggested that Rachel was attracted to Greg.  To Rachel's surprise, Greg related that Vivian had made the same comment to him.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, while Rex and Roxy argued, Gigi retreated outside to take her break.  Blaming Roxy for his problems with Stacy, Rex complained that he couldn't trust his mother to be honest with him.   Rex berated Roxy for refusing to reveal his father's identity.  In an attempt to change the subject, Roxy vowed to rid Rex of Stacy.  Informing Roxy that he wouldn't abandon his child, Rex instructed Roxy to stay away from Stacy, and him, as well.  Devastated, Roxy rushed out of the bar.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Schuyler encountered Gigi outside of Rodi's  Alerting Schuyler that Rex was inside, Gigi informed Schuyler that she had told Rex about their kiss.  Upon learning of Rex's concern, Schuyler suggested that he and Gigi end their friendship.  Insisting that he didn't want to cause Gigi any further problems, Schuyler doubted that they could remain platonic friends.  Near tears, Gigi stated that she didn't want to lose Schuyler as a friend.  As they hugged goodbye, an irate Rex appeared and pulled Gigi and Schuyler apart.\n\n\n",
