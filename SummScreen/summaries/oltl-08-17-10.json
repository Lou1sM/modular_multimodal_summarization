    "soap_central": "\n\nDavid and Dorian kissed passionately outside of Rodi's. They both agreed there was no point in denying \"it,\" but neither of them wanted to be the one to admit the truth first. \"You never got over me,\" each of them told the other. After several minutes of bickering, they settled on a plan to speak up on the count of three. When neither said a thing because they each knew the other wouldn't follow through, they tried again. Finally, \"I love you,\" was uttered in unison. They admitted to being too proud and too scared to arrive at their conclusion in the past, and they wondered where they might make love.\n\n\nAt St. Anne's, John and Hannah concurred that they hadn't seen each other, and their conversation didn't exist. John thought that Ford might be able to tell him the truth about Eli, and he suspected that Ford might even name Eli in the criminal acts. Hannah knew that Ford could indeed do that, but he wouldn't. She knew she had been the likely suspect, but she would not have committed such violent acts. She told John that she had asked Ford for help, but he had refused. John thought that Ford was probably scared, but Hannah divulged that Ford had an insurance policy.\n\n\nShe explained that he had written a letter that would be sent to the press if anything happened to him. The letter exposed Eli's actions, and Ford had told her to do the same thing. John called Ford an idiot and exclaimed that Ford and Hannah should have gone to the police. Eli had caught her with her own letter, Hannah continued, and he'd made her swallow the pills.\n\n\nSuddenly, she gasped. She realized that Eli had already had the pills with him when he visited her, so he had obviously planned for her to swallow them all along. She was worried about Cole, she told John. The detective advised her that Cole had been taken care of and nothing would happen to him. John promised to \"nail\" Eli, and he wanted Hannah to let Eli think she was playing along with him. He would have undercover cops keep an eye on Hannah around the clock. Hannah admitted she had obstructed justice when she lied, but John wanted to talk about that at a later time. Hannah noted that Eli could have been in jail already if it weren't for her, and she was sorry. John only wanted Eli to pay.\n\n\nFord checked the Internet for the possibility of a woman getting pregnant after having sex only one time. Frustrated, he jumped up and blasted music throughout his apartment. James emerged sleepily from his bedroom. He was annoyed about the music waking him up. He accused Ford of being angry because James had asked Langston out on a date, and Ford admitted that he thought Langston was just trying to get back at Ford. James was under the impression that Ford didn't care about Langston, and he wanted the truth from his brother. Ford thought that James was just angry because he couldn't have Starr and was trying to make her jealous by going out on a date with Langston.\n\n\nThe brothers began to argue. James pointed out that Ford had spoken about how much fun Langston was, and he figured he would just grab onto something he wanted like his brother did. Ford accused James of sounding like their father, but James noted that he sounded just like Ford.\n\n\nFord wanted James to call the date off, but James was tired of Ford ordering him around. He threatened to move out, and Ford thought that was fine. James announced that he would move in with his mother and brother, but that didn't sit well with Ford, and he stopped James. Ford stated that the others were family in name only, and he was only trying to protect his brother from Langston. She'd cheated on her live-in boyfriend with Ford, he raged. He offered his hand to James. \"Bros before hoes,\" he said.\n\n\nJames declared that he was able to take care of himself. Ford slammed around and suddenly turned to James in a huff. He noted that Langston had been through a lot, and he didn't want James to take advantage of her. He threatened to bury James if his brother didn't abide by that. James maintained that he wouldn't do anything that Ford himself wouldn't do.\n\n\nAs Dani and Todd watched a meteor shower from the rooftop, Todd mentioned that all of the shooting stars were merely dying out before their eyes. Unfortunately, his unintentional description carried the pair back to thoughts of T\u00e9a. \"Thanks,\" Dani told her father. She described the event was brilliant and amazing just like her mother, and Todd set the date in her phone calendar. He wanted to mark the event with his daughter every year.\n\n\nT\u00e9a lay awake in the St. Kitts hospice. She watched the same meteor shower as Todd and Dani. She remarked that time had passed too quickly. Out in the hallway, Greg spoke to Eli on the phone and assured him that Shaun would not disclose T\u00e9a's whereabouts to anyone. Greg noted that the hospice care was the best thing for everyone involved, and Eli advised him to remain there until the end. Greg wasn't happy with the situation, but Eli reminded him that it was what T\u00e9a wanted. Greg wanted to know why it had been so important to separate T\u00e9a from her family, but just then T\u00e9a wandered into the hallway to advise Greg that she had experienced some blurry vision.\n\n\nHastily, Greg urged her to get back into bed. He assured Eli that she hadn't heard anything. \"You need to be more careful,\" Eli admonished Greg. The doctor went to T\u00e9a's room and began to examine her. T\u00e9a remarked on the meteor shower she had watched, and Greg noted that it really consisted of debris. They joked about Greg's ability to ruin what might possibly be the last event that T\u00e9a witnessed. She couldn't believe she would never see Todd and Dani again, and she wondered if she had made the wrong choice.\n\n\nGreg reminded her that she had chosen to be at the hospice especially because of Todd and Dani. T\u00e9a thought she would be upset if the tables were turned, and Shaun thought she was doing the wrong thing too. He had made a good case, T\u00e9a contended. Greg believed that his brother thought with his heart, but he was unaware of reality. Greg pointed out that T\u00e9a wasn't being selfish but heroic. She had saved Todd and Dani from lots of pain. T\u00e9a thanked Greg for getting her to see things more clearly. Greg gave her a pain pill, and T\u00e9a lay down in bed. She looked at a photo of Todd and Dani, and it began to blur.\n\n\nStarr accompanied Langston back to La Boulaie and reminded her friend of the reasons why they had gone to Ford's apartment. She inquired whether Langston was really going to go out with James. He was Ford's brother, Starr emphasized. Langston confessed that she knew James had asked her out to make Starr jealous, and it had obviously worked.\n\n\nStarr insisted she wasn't jealous, and she pointed out that Langston couldn't be over all that Ford had done to her. Langston insisted that James wasn't Ford, and she had news for Starr. She was using James just as he was using her. She wanted to see how Ford felt because Ford said he didn't want anything to do with Langston.\n\n\nStarr thought that Langston was going from one bad thing to another, but Langston insisted it was just a date. As the girls stood in the foyer and talked, David and Dorian arrived, kissing as they walked through the door and headed to the kitchen. The girls were surprised, and Starr supposed that Dorian just couldn't get David out of her system. Langston thought that was a perfect reason for her to move on. She thought that James was cute too. Starr was sure that things wouldn't end well.\n\n\nOnce again, David and Dorian passed through on their way upstairs. They were armed with strawberries, whipped cream, and champagne. The girls shuddered, and Langston swore that she wouldn't get hurt. She saw it as a way of saving Starr and Cole's relationship. If she were to keep James busy, he wouldn't bother Starr, Langston said. Starr warned Langston to be careful. Langston reminded her that it was only one date.\n\n\nBlair was in the study as she observed Eli outside on the phone. She recalled the conversation about Eli that she'd had with John and looked at Eli's passport that she held in her hand. Her plan had been to see what Eli had been up to. She heard him as he gave his instructions to Greg, and when Eli spotted her, he claimed to have been speaking to an assistant of his. They walked into the study, and Eli spotted his open briefcase. Blair disclosed that she had opened it and removed his passport, and she had found something interesting. Eli was visibly angry as he attempted to stay calm. He asked what Blair had seen.\n\n\nBlair declared that she hadn't seen anything but had learned something. She had looked over Eli's passport and discovered that he had only been to Tahiti and London. She was happy that they could discover lots of new places together. Eli was noticeably relieved and admitted that he assumed Blair had been looking for proof of John's charges against him. Eli wanted to know that Blair trusted him, and Blair advised him she did. She also loved him, but she asked him about his real name.\n\n\nEli was surprised at the question, but explained that his real name was Elijah Clarke Rayburn. Due to his brother's activities when they were younger, Eli thought it was best to drop his last name as he attained his status as an attorney. Blair asked why Eli had arranged for Ross to enter his life again, and Eli shrugged. He told her he had \"caved.\"\n\n\nHe contended that he was not who John and Kelly thought he was, and he wasn't like Todd either. He knew Todd had lied to Blair, and Eli wanted Blair to trust him. Blair vowed to do all she could to prove that she did. She suggested that the best way would be for her to marry Eli as soon as possible. She and Eli agreed to marry the next day, and Eli declared that nothing would stop them.\n\n\n\"Nobody does it better,\" David uttered in Dorian's ear after making love. He thought they should get married the next day. Dorian was thrilled.\n\n\nDani and Todd headed inside, and Todd asked Dani if she wanted some milk and cookies before bed. Dani thought it was odd, but Todd admitted that he hadn't known her when she was younger, and he wanted to make up for lost time. She assured him he had with his search for her mother. She walked upstairs to go to bed. Todd made a phone call and asked someone to stop at the house.\n\n\nShortly after, Shaun arrived, and Todd advised him that they needed to locate T\u00e9a. She was sick and had gone off to die alone. He thought that Shaun was the best person to see the job through to the end, and he wouldn't be satisfied until he had located her. Shaun refused to take the job, since T\u00e9a didn't want to be found. Todd wondered how Shaun knew that, but Shaun pointed out that Todd had said it himself. Todd declared that T\u00e9a hadn't done the right thing. Shaun continued to flash back to his conversation with T\u00e9a in St. Kitts, and Dani sat on the stairs and listened to the men as they conversed.\n\n\nShaun insisted it wasn't about the money, but it wasn't right for him to pursue T\u00e9a. He left, but once outside, he asked himself, \"What am I gonna do?\" He received a phone call from Greg, who wanted to make sure that Shaun had arrived back in Llanview safely. Greg reminded his brother not to tell anyone about T\u00e9a because he needed to respect the wishes of a dying woman. Inside, Dani walked the rest of the way downstairs. She had thought that Shaun would help. Todd vowed to locate T\u00e9a on his own.\n\n\nJames headed back to bed, but was stopped when there was a knock on the door. It was John, who flashed his badge. James thought it was about Ford's loud music, and he deferred to his brother. Ford was surprised to see John and more so when John handcuffed him.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd and Dani do not want to give up on finding Tea. She appears uncertain that she really wants to die without them. Robert Ford wants to persuade James not to date or trust Langston. And Starr wants Langston to decide the same about James. Yet the reasons why either of them would care is due to their own respective \"incompletion\" (Starr likes James and Robert may have feelings he doesn't want to admit for Langston). John then concludes that the only way to get Eli in jail for the crimes he's committed it to get the only other person besides Hannah to testify what they know about Eli. SO he goes to find Robert and puts him in handcuffs. Blair continues to make Eli believe that she trusts him and disbelieves John and Kelly's accusations of him. David and Dorian are back together and admitting they were both denying their feelings for each other",
