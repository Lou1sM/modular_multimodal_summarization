John couldn't believe that Natalie wanted to hire a psychic, but Natalie insisted that she trusted Delphina. She continued that there had to have been something important on the tape if Marty had tried to kill Natalie over it. John eventually agreed, and reminded her to log the tape back into evidence when she was done with it. He wished her luck. She promised that it would be worth it, and left.\n\n\nAubrey wondered if Cutter knew what the Spotted Pony was. He claimed not to know. He informed Aubrey that she had a \"golden opportunity\" in front of her, because Rex was \"lonely, single, and rich.\" Aubrey didn't want to make a play for Rex because of what had happened with Joey. Cutter suggested that Joey had never really loved Aubrey at all. Offended, Aubrey stormed away from Cutter.\n\n\nRex demanded to know if David knew something about the Spotted Pony. David replied that he wasn't \"a horse kind of guy.\" Rex explained about his meeting with Madame Delphina. David denied knowing anything, but Rex informed David that the Buchanan family creed was \"family first.\" Rex threatened to go to Bo if David didn't help out his cousin.\n\n\nAs Cutter listened in, David broke down. He admitted that the Spotted Pony was a club in Anchorage, Kentucky, that he \"may or may not have been to.\" \"A strip joint?\" Rex asked. Rex found the paper with the information, and found that the Spotted Pony was a \"watering hole for gentlemen.\" Rex wondered if David had been there. David replied that if Dorian asked, David had never been there. \"Between you and me,\" David started, \"oh yeah, I've been there! This place is awesome!\"\n\n\nJust then, David's agent, Bev, entered the bar. He told Rex that Bev had a big role for him, and walked away. He sat at a table with Bev, who handed David a contract. David was satisfied to see that it was a thriller set in Sweden that would offer him seven figures, \"including the decimal point and the dollar sign.\" The only catch was that David would have to leave Llanview immediately.\n\n\nAubrey returned, and wondered why Cutter had been eavesdropping on Rex and David. Cutter revealed that Rex was \"ripe for the picking,\" and vowed to get to Rex if Aubrey couldn't. Aubrey didn't want Cutter to go after Rex, especially since everyone in town was onto who they really were. She left to go back to the motel, but Cutter stayed for another drink.\n\n\nMadame Delphina arrived at Foxy Roxy's, startling Roxy. Talking to her \"sources,\" Delphina said that Natalie was with her \"baby daddy.\" Roxy confirmed that Natalie had said she was going to see Brody. Delphina wondered if Natalie was getting the blank tape, which Roxy was shocked that Delphina knew about. Delphina questioned who Roxy thought had erased the tape. Roxy explained that Gigi had last been in possession of the tape, so she had probably taken the secret to the grave with her.\n\n\nRoxy admitted that she was happy about Natalie calling Delphina to help Rex. Delphina replied that Gigi's message of \"spotted pony\" was important to many people. Delphina's sources were showing her something sharp, like a knife, and she was confused as to why they were showing her \"the Have-A-Seat guy.\" The sources were about to answer the confusion, but Natalie burst through the door, yelling that she had the tape.\n\n\nNatalie handed the tape to Delphina. Delphina dropped the tape, claiming that it was hot. She picked the tape up with a nail-grooming tool, and put it on the table. Natalie wanted to know what had been on the tape, but Delphina reminded her that the tape had been erased. She did know that the tape had \"been around.\" Natalie wanted Delphina to ask Gigi if she'd listened to it, but Delphina had been having trouble getting a hold of Gigi.\n\n\nDelphina had gotten a hold of someone else, and tried to pronounce the name. Natalie recognized the name as Dr. Buhari. When Delphina asked the doctor what had been on the tape, the doctor apparently cited doctor-client confidentiality. Natalie wanted to know if anyone else knew what had been on the tape. Delphina disclosed that Todd knew.\n\n\nJust then, Delphina's phone rang, and she answered it to Rex. Rex had to see her because he'd seen Gigi at Capricorn. Delphina agreed, and hung up. Delphina apologized for not being able to help with the tape, and left. Natalie picked up the tape, and wondered what Todd knew.\n\n\nA short while later, Rex wanted Delphina to ask Gigi if she'd meant that the Spotted Pony was a strip club. Delphina replied that \"the circuits are down.\" She explained that Gigi had probably run away so that Rex would chase after her, run into David, and drop all of his papers, which led to David recognizing the Spotted Pony. She didn't think it was a coincidence. As Cutter listened in, Rex decided that he needed to go to Kentucky.\n\n\nKelly ran into the living room of La Boulaie, and was glad to find Dorian. She had something to tell Dorian, but found that Dorian had something to tell her as well. Both women admitted that they were leaving Llanview. Dorian revealed that she'd been offered \"the job of a lifetime\" thanks to the governor. The governor had told her that her party's senator for the state had gotten caught in a \"sexting scandal,\" and was resigning. He'd wanted to offer Dorian the job. She was to leave as soon as possible. An excited Kelly told Dorian how proud she was of her aunt.\n\n\nDorian wondered why Kelly was leaving. Kelly admitted that she'd missed Zane after leaving him a couple weeks before. She didn't want to miss any more of his life, so she was going back to London. She said that Joey was going with her, which made Dorian very happy. Dorian believed that Kelly and Joey were meant to be. Dorian told Kelly that she was more like a daughter, and Kelly said that Dorian was more than an aunt. Kelly didn't know what she would have done without Dorian when Melinda had died.\n\n\nKelly wondered if Dorian had told David about her new job yet, but Dorian said that she'd just gotten the call. She knew that David would be thrilled for her, and called it \"the role of a lifetime\" for him: her \"devoted husband.\"\n\n\nTomas wanted to know what Blair and T\u00e9a's fight was about, and told them to stop pacing. Both yelled about Tomas' news about Irene being alive, and responsible for the two Todds, and wondered how he expected them to sit still. He explained that Irene was at Llanfair, and was being interrogated. Blair grabbed her purse to go to Llanfair, but T\u00e9a thought she should be there. The two started yelling at each other all over again.\n\n\nTomas quieted both women. He informed them that he, John, and Brody had almost died trying to get to Irene, so the women needed to stay put. He assured them that they would know what was going on once John did. Blair insisted on going to Llanfair, but T\u00e9a wondered if Blair wanted to kiss Todd again. Tomas was shocked as the women argued about Todd. Finally, T\u00e9a demanded that Blair leave, and went to open the front door.\n\n\nBlair couldn't believe that T\u00e9a was kicking her out. When Blair wasn't moving fast enough, T\u00e9a began to yell in Spanish. Tomas agreed that space would be good for Blair and T\u00e9a. He promised to call if there was any news. \"Why don't you just try your taste test again?\" T\u00e9a spat, and slammed the door shut.\n\n\nTomas tried to calm T\u00e9a down. She realized that she'd attacked Blair, and that Blair wasn't at fault. Blair didn't threaten her, but she was worried about Todd's identity. She cried in Tomas' arms about what would happen to her marriage if she wasn't really married to Todd.\n\n\nA short while later, Blair walked through Capricorn with Cristian. She'd filled him in on the Todd situation. She knew she needed to explain her actions to Tomas. \"Now's your chance,\" Cristian said as Tomas entered the bar. She tried to explain to Tomas that she'd only been looking for answers, but that she knew that she'd gone about it in the wrong way. She begged for his forgiveness. \"That depends,\" he said, and kissed her.\n\n\nIrene explained how she'd successfully transferred all of Todd's memories to Victor. In order to make Victor identical to Todd, she'd even cut his face in the same way as Todd's scar. Viki thought that Irene owed the truth to the men, \"now.\" John returned, and Irene said she had thought that she was in a private meeting. John informed her that the entire conversation was being recorded anyway.\n\n\nMoving on, Irene had realized that she needed to figure out a way to disguise Todd from Mitch, who'd left Todd for dead. She'd looked at Mitch's file, and found a picture of his brother Walker. Irene had known that it was a good idea to fool Mitch, because Victor could first get to know Todd's family as Walker. Then, Victor would get what he'd been entitled to. Todd demanded to know what Irene was trying to say.\n\n\nIrene walked over to Todd, and called him Victor. She looked at the man with the scar, and called him Todd.\n\n\nThe man that Viki had known as Todd for years walked over to Viki, and pleaded with her to believe that Irene was lying. \"I know who I am. I'm Todd,\" he stated. Viki agreed that the story seemed far-fetched, but Irene insisted that it was true. Neither man remembered anything, but Irene told them they'd been \"brainwashed by the best.\"\n\n\nThe newly christened Victor demanded that John remove Irene from the house. Irene was proud of her plan, and how Todd's entire family had fallen in love with Victor as Walker. She was proud of Victor for dropping hints of his \"true\" identity to Todd's smart daughter Starr. Irene hadn't expected Victor to remember anything from before he'd become Todd, but assured him that he'd been \"magnificent.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know about your story,\" John said to Irene, \"but you're a piece of work.\" Irene thanked him, but informed him that he'd \"ruined everything.\" John started to lead Irene out of the room, as Viki and her brothers were solemn-faced. Irene warned everyone that \"this isn't the end,\" and walked out with John. Viki expressed her sympathy to Victor. \"Don't be sorry. I know who I am,\" he said, and walked out.\n\n\nViki wished she could still drink. \"Told you so,\" said the newly dubbed Todd. He asked for a hug, but Viki replied that her brother didn't like hugs. He replied that he'd been locked up for eight years, and the only time anyone had ever touched him was to torture him. \"I could really use your hug now,\" he said, and Viki tearfully hugged him.\n\n\nVictor unhappily returned home, and found T\u00e9a waiting for him. T\u00e9a told him that Tomas had found Irene alive. He admitted that he'd seen Irene. T\u00e9a wondered what she'd said.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair, T\u00e9a, and Tomas wait impatiently for word from John McBain about the Todds. T\u00e9a brings up Blair kissing Todd. T\u00e9a throws Blair out. T\u00e9a admits to Tomas that she overreacted. Irene Manning tells Viki and the two Todds that one of them is her son Victor and that she went to great lengths to make them identical, including giving Victor Todd's memories and scar so he could do the work that the agency needed. Viki wonders why they now look so different. Irene explains that when Mitch Lawrence thought Todd was dead after leaving him in a cave, she realized that sending Victor looking like Todd would be a death sentence. She says she gave Victor the face of Mitch's brother Walker so he could get to know Viki, Blair, and Starr as Walker before approaching them as Todd. Viki tells Irene that she has scarred her two sons in so many ways that the least she can do is tell them who is who. She reveals that Current Todd is her son Victor and Original Todd is her other son Todd. \"Victor\" says she is a liar and orders John McBain to arrest her. John takes her away. Viki tells \"Victor\" that she is sorry and he tells her not to be; he knows who he is. Todd (Victor) goes home to T\u00e9a. she asks him what Irene told him. Natalie asks John for the tape in the evidence room so she can have Madame Delphina try to determine what was on it or who erased it. John has no faith in Delphina's voodoo but lets Natalie borrow the tape. Delphina goes to Roxy's place and tells her that the spotted pony is important to other people besides Rex. Delphina sees a sharp object and the have-a-seat guy. Natalie rushes in with the tape and interrupts Delphina's psychic connection. Delphina says the tape is too hot to touch, many people have touched it, and the information that was on it could change lives, but she doesn't know what was on the tape. The psychiatrist that Marty murdered contacts Delphina and says she was robbed. She gets a message from another spirit that tells her Todd knows. Aubrey wants to know why Cutter's ears pricked up when Rex mentioned the spotted pony. He mentions the Buchanan stables and suggests she put the move on Rex. Cutter eavesdrops on Rex's conversation with David. David notices the spotted pony in the newspaper. Rex asks him if it means anything to him. David tells Rex that when he was a kid, the kid that spat on him every day had a spotted pony named Rex. Rex knows David made that story up and tells him the Buchanan creed is \"Family first.\" David reveals that he may or may not have been at a place for discerning gentlemen in Anchorage KY called the Spotted Pony, but asks that Rex not tell Dorian. Rex asks Delphina if she can pick up anything about the Spotted Pony strip club. She says she can't but that it is no coincidence that he ran into David and David recognized the name. Kelly and Dorian each tell the other that she is leaving Llanview. Dorian explains that she is going to Washington DC as interim senator because a scandal is forcing the current one to resign. Kelly tells Dorian that she is going back to London to be near her son, Zane and Joey is going with her. Dorian tells Kelly that she hasn't told David yet but she knows he will be thrilled. David's agent brings him an offer for a part in Switzerland.",
