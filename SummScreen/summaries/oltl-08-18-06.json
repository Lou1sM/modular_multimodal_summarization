Rex reminded his mom of the lengths Dorian had gone to in order to break him and Adriana up. He showed his mom some of the stalker's messages, where he'd called someone \"painted lady.\" Rex concluded that the stalker was a butterfly expert.\n\n\nA worried Dorian thought about Bruce. Bruce told his hostage, Adriana, that she'd soon know what he wanted from her and that she'd be going home soon if all went according to his plans. He wouldn't say what those were but didn't hesitate to chain her up. Adriana screamed for help and regretted thinking Rex had been her stalker. She thought back to their happy romp on the beach.\n\n\nDorian told Bruce that he could tell Adriana about their agreement because Adriana would believe her over him. Bruce revealed that he'd kidnapped her daughter and warned her not to call the cops. Later, Bruce rejoined his hostage. Adriana was confident that Rex would find her.\n\n\nAt the gala, Clint asked Viki what his ex thought of him. They agreed that they worked well together as parents. He promised that no matter what happened with him and Dorian, his and Viki's kids would be his priority. Viki asked if he thought she wanted to be with him.\n\n\nAlso at the gala, Claudia complimented Renee's setup of the Palace dining room, as Nash looked on. Nash informed her that he was looking for a new business opportunity in town. Claudia offered to invest in it, but he wasn't so sure. John and Natalie wondered how Blair was doing with Spencer. Natalie worried that Spencer was onto John.\n\n\nTodd told Evangeline that he was not in love with Blair anymore. Evangeline didn't really believe it. Cristian then arrived and told her that he didn't care who she had arrived with because she was going home with him. Vincent reminded him not to drink and to go to bed early so he'd be ready for his fight. When the guys went off to talk, Evangeline expressed her concern for Layla and Vincent's relationship.\n\n\nDavid was surprised to see Paige there. She revealed that she'd interviewed for a new job. Both planned for Spencer's downfall. After, David jokingly tried to flirt with Viki, but she wouldn't play along.\n\n\nTodd told Viki that he couldn't forgive Blair. Viki urged him to be happy he had gotten his life back and reminded him that he'd lied to Blair. She also stated that Starr had gotten hurt because the teen was upset over her parents' problems and had acted out. Viki then shared how grateful she'd been that Ben had forgiven her for pushing him out the window.\n\n\nEn route to the gala, Blair tried to get Spencer's safe deposit box key, but Spencer wanted to stop at a bank to get something from his box. Blair tried to get out of going to the event, but Spencer told her she had to because he had something \"special\" planned for her. Later, at the gala, Spencer proposed to Blair in front of everyone. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair has the key to the safety deposit in her purse. Spencer wants to stop at the bank first, she while he is buying her aspirin, she slips the key back on his key chain as it hangs from his ignition. He notices that she is jittery. She says she is nervous about the event as it is so important to him. He goes into the bank and Blair calls John to warn him that she doesn't have the key and that Spencer is going to his safety deposit box right now. Rex and Roxy talk at the station. She reads one of the stalker's emails and Rex realizes that the name of a butterfly is in the email. He refers to the Vanessa Atlanta but calls it rare, when in fact it is a popular butterfly. Adriana wakes again. She is in a room and free to walk around but only for a short time. He cuffs her to the wall so she can't take off. He assures her that she will be freed if things go as planned. He is positive that Rex has given up on her, but she knows better. Dorian paces the floor. She answers the phone to Bruce and she shouts at him for trying to control their deal. She tells him that this is called off. \"Have you seen her recently?\" Dorian gets suddenly quiet. He knew that would get her attention. He wants money, tons and tons of it or she will never see Adriana again. She picks up the phone to call Bo, but then quickly hangs up when she realizes that she could cause her poor Adriana to be hurt. Viki has a talk with Todd and explains to him that he needs to forgive Blair for the children's sake. She knows that he will not have any peace if he doesn't stop being angry. She also remembers that he lied to Blair for months about Margaret, so in fact he has been just as wrong. Viki feels the children are suffering for this now, and that maybe poor Starr was out that night and jumped the cliff because of all the tension in her life. John sends a man to watch Spencer and reports to Natalie that Spencer got something from the deposit box and it might be the gun. John hopes that is the case that Spencer hasn't gotten rid of the gun yet. Blair and Spencer arrive. Todd is trying to drag Blair off to talk to her but Spencer is making his speech now. Todd ignores him and keeps pulling on Blair's arm while Spencer is talking. Finally, she starts walking with Todd when she hears, \"Blair will you marry me?\" Todd and Blair stop walking and face the stage.",
