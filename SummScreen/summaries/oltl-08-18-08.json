    "soap_central": "\nLove The One You're With\n\n\nAt the Buchanan ranch in the year 1968, Rex sat in the hall thinking about losing Gigi forever. Walking away from the door, Rex said, \"Sorry Morasco!\" At that very moment, Gigi knocked at the door. After receiving no answer, Gigi entered the mansion and began her search for Rex. \n\n\nGigi stood in complete shock when she noticed Noelle and Mo, who were actually Maria and Jeremiah. Unable to get their attention, Gigi tried to understand what exactly was taking place. As she analyzed the situation, Renee approached her and called her Emma. Realizing that she had been transported to 1968, Gigi asked Renee if she had seen Rex. Believing Emma had hit her head while out in the storm, Renee escorted her into the dining room, to help Emma compose herself. Jeremiah entered the room and turned on his transistor radio. The radio announcer suggested that due to the severity of the storm, everyone should stay put and wait for the storm to end. Gigi was adamant that she couldn't stay the entire night at the ranch. \n\n\nStartled to learn that Renee might actually be Renee Buchanan, Gigi was more amazed at the sight of Clint, who looked like Jared. Unable to learn Rex's whereabouts from Renee, Gigi questioned Clint about Rex. Clint had no idea who Rex was, but he told Gigi that he had heard the name mentioned several times that day. Clint told Gigi that a strange man, who had been hanging around Asa and Bo, referred to his brother Bo, as Rex. Clint's statement raised Gigi's suspicion that perhaps Rex was nearby. \n\n\nStepping out in the hall to look for Rex, Gigi was horrified to see Spencer, who looked like Shane. When a frantic Gigi grabbed Spencer and held him tightly, Spencer responded by kicking Gigi. Gigi told the child that his name was Shane and she was his mother. Before running off, Spencer told her that she wasn't his mother. Gigi was puzzled when he told her that his name was Spencer, not Shane. \n\n\nAs Gigi tried to figure out her next move, Jeremiah approached her and began discussing Bo Buchanan shipping off to Vietnam. Realizing that Rex might actually be Bo, Gigi asked Jeremiah if he had seen Bo. Jeremiah stated that he had seen Bo headed down the hall several moments ago. \n\n\nWhen Rex attempted to turn in for the night, he was startled when Emma wandered into his room. As Rex expressed his fear of shipping off to Vietnam, Emma tried to calm his nerves. Rex mentioned how he regretted never telling Gigi how much he loved her, and feared he wouldn't see her again. Emma tried to convince him that he could find a way. As he stared into Emma's eyes, Rex was amazed at how much Emma reminded him of Gigi. Momentarily, Rex appeared to believe that Emma was actually Gigi. After regaining his senses, Rex said that there was no use to pretend because it wouldn't be fair to either of them. Attempting to comfort him, Emma told Rex that she could be Gigi for the night-if he wanted her to be. Emma offered to pretend to be Gigi, so Rex could say goodbye. A distraught Rex responded by returning Emma's kiss. \n\n\nWith thoughts of Gigi, Rex made love to Emma. Meanwhile, Gigi wandered through the halls looking for Rex. Opening every door she came across, Gigi vowed to find Rex and bring him home. As she nearly gave up, Gigi spotted a light on in a bedroom that she had yet to check. Inside the room, Emma slept as a bewildered Rex appeared bothered by his encounter with Emma. Moments later, Gigi opened the door. Failing to notice Emma, Gigi smiled as she locked eyes with Rex. \n\n\nAs Mike was headed up to John's apartment to turn in for the night, he encountered Marcie. She informed him that Cole had agreed to sign over his rights to Starr's baby. Marcie begged Mike to reconsider his decision about adopting the child. Mike expressed his love for Marcie, but said he couldn't go through the possible loss of another child. Mike promised to pray for Marcie and her baby, but refused to be a part of their lives. Marcie wondered if they were breaking up. Mike believed that their relationship had obviously come to an end. \n\n\nInside John's apartment, Blair and John flirted. Blair told John that he was still in mourning and she planned to cheer him up. Loving the attention that he was receiving from Blair, John had no objections. \n\n\nWhen Mike approached John's door, he realized that John was entertaining. As Marcie stood nearby, Mike stated that he would spend the night at the hospital. Marcie suggested that Mike stay at her apartment. Initially, Mike refused but changed his mind. Inside the apartment, Mike and Marcie argued over who would prepare the sofa for Mike to sleep on. The argument soon ended when the two stared into each other's eyes. Mike and Marcie embraced and questioned what they were doing to one another. \n\n\nBlair and John shared a drink and toasted to her new life, without Todd. \n\n\nAt Todd's residence, Marty had a terrible nightmare about the night she was raped. The nightmare revealed the dorm room where the rape had taken place many years earlier. After hearing blood-curdling screams coming from Marty's bedroom, Todd rushed in to check on her. Marty told Todd about her dream and described the dorm room. Todd regretted telling her about the night she was raped. When Marty revealed that she saw him in her dream, Todd nearly panicked. He tried to convince Marty that she was mistaken, but she was certain that Todd was indeed in her dream. She asked him if they had ever been together in that particular room. After Todd made up an excuse, she became convinced that she saw Todd's face because she needed help and was certain that he would've helped her if he had been there. Relieved that Marty didn't suspect him of raping her, Todd attempted to calm her nerves. Fearing that she would have another nightmare, Marty begged Todd to spend the night in her room. \n\n\nWith Todd by her side, Marty had a vision of John standing at the foot of her bed. \n\n\nAfter an intense lovemaking session, Blair and John fell asleep. John awoke and saw a vision of Marty in his bedroom. \n\n\nMike and Marcie made love. Afterward, Marcie watched as Mike wept.\n\n\n",
