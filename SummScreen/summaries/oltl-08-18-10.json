    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Sun, Jessica stared at the latest headline about Hannah and Ford as she spoke to Brody on the phone.\n\n\nOutside Starr and Cole's apartment, Brody apologized to Jessica for leaving Llanfair early in the morning, but said he was guarding someone for a case, and teased his fianc\u00e9e, warning her not to use her journalist's instincts to attempt to get the details.  Jessica asked him to be careful, and reminded him that he had a family to consider.  Flashing back to his conversation with Natalie, Brody told Jessica that family was all he could think about.\n\n\nAfter hanging up, Jessica stared at the Sun headline, and remembered her conversation with Ford and his confession about their night together.\n\n\nAt Rex's apartment, Rex answered the door for Kelly while still on the phone with Natalie at the police station.  Kelly was desperate for more information on Bennett Thompson, and over the phone, Natalie told Rex that she was almost done reconstructing some of the shredded documents and was recreating a picture that had been destroyed.  Kelly urged Rex and Natalie to hurry up, as her family was in danger, but ordered Natalie not to alert John to her activities.  Irked, Natalie told Rex to tell Kelly \"this ain't my first rodeo.\"  After finishing the call, Rex told Kelly that they had to wait on Natalie and her \"doohickey,\" and he would take a shower in the meantime.\n\n\nWhile Rex showered, Kelly got a call from Jessica.  Jessica told Kelly she needed to see her: \"I'm in big trouble.\"  As Rex emerged from the shower, Kelly told the confused amateur sleuth that she would be back soon, and ordered him to get dressed; she rushed out the door.  In response, Rex simply whipped off his towel.\n\n\nBack at Starr and Cole's apartment, Starr sat in the living room, staring at her laptop.  She was seething over Langston's \"Myface\" page, which indicated that Langston and James had become social networking \"friends.\"  As she remembered James and Langston making a date to go out, Cole emerged from the bedroom, which interrupted her.  Starr hastily closed her browser window and told Cole she hadn't been able to sleep due to bad dreams.\n\n\nAs Starr and Cole went to pick up the paper, they found Brody and Officer Flynn on their doorstep.  The teens were stunned, and Cole demanded to know why Brody was standing guard outside their apartment.  Brody said he didn't have the details, but Cole suspected their new police protection involved Hannah's case, and asked Brody again who had given the order for them to be watched.  When he mentioned needing to protect Starr and Hope the way Brody needed to protect Jessica and her new baby, Brody relented and told Cole that John wanted him and Starr kept safe.  Determined to get answers, Cole hurried to the police station with Officer Flynn in tow.\n\n\nStarr invited Brody inside and apologized for Cole's behavior, but Brody told her that Cole had nothing to worry about.  Brody was surprised that the news of Jessica's pregnancy had already made the rounds of Llanview proper, and Starr congratulated him on the impending new arrival.  She laughed at the thought of Jessica and Natalie getting pregnant simultaneously, and joked that it had almost seemed planned.  \"Right,\" Brody muttered, forcing a smile.  Starr said she was sure it was a happy accident, and told Brody she was very happy for him and Jess, who needed Brody by her side.\n\n\nAt the Ford brothers' apartment, James entered the empty living room, calling out for big brother \"Bobby.\"  Checking the second bedroom, he found no one there.  Next, he called Ford's voicemail, curious about where Ford could have gone with \"that cop\" who had visited the apartment the night before.  Then, fingering the dented bullet he wore around his neck, he threw a shirt on and headed out the door.\n\n\nAt the police station, Ford was handcuffed to a desk in an interrogation room, and was spitting curses at an impassive John.  He warned John that he couldn't be locked up indefinitely, and John suggested he get Ford a lawyer: \"Maybe we can call Eli Clarke.\"  After all, Elijah had done a great job with Hannah, and John figured he and Ford could talk about how Ford covered for him when Elijah had bashed his head in.\n\n\nFord played dumb, but John ordered him to tell the whole story about Elijah.  \"And if I don't?\" Ford snapped.  John replied that if Ford didn't cooperate, he'd release him, but not before leaking to Elijah that Ford had gone to the cops willingly and given them everything.  Enraged, Ford told the departing McBain that he'd sue John and take his badge.\n\n\nIn the corridor, John ran into Natalie, who dropped the documents she'd reconstructed for Rex and Kelly.  Hiding them from John, she lied that they were routine paperwork.  She asked John who he was interrogating, but John said it was nothing and wished her luck at her first doctor's appointment.  He told Natalie he wanted her and his baby to be healthy.\n\n\nJust then, Cole rushed into the station with Officer Flynn; Cole wanted answers from John.  As Natalie hurried away with the reconstructed documents, John took Cole aside.  Cole asked if the police protection John had put on him and Starr was about Hannah's case, and John confessed that Hannah might not be guilty after all.  Cole asked if John had new evidence, or another suspect, then realized that John was interrogating someone in the next room and asked if John had found the real culprit already.  Cole pleaded with John to let him into the loop; Marty needed justice, and so did Hannah.\n\n\nJohn told Cole he couldn't involve him, as the suspect he was investigating was clever, and the entire case was delicate and dangerous.  He promised to let Cole know the whole story when things were safer, and asked him to go home with Officer Flynn, lay low, and play it cool.  \"Let us do our job,\" John told the teen.  Cole reluctantly agreed, and thanked John for looking out for him and Starr.  He asked John to do whatever it took to get the true perpetrator, and John replied that he was already on it.\n\n\nWith Cole gone, John returned to the interrogation room and gave Ford two choices: talk, or take his chances with Elijah.  Ford told John he'd need police protection and immunity from prosecution, and John replied that immunity depended on the level of Ford's cooperation and value to the case.  \"I can give you Eli Clarke and I can exonerate Hannah O'Connor,\" Ford said.  He explained that Elijah, not Hannah, had attacked him, and said that Elijah had forced him to lie.  He told John that Elijah had assaulted him because he'd been blackmailing the nefarious lawyer with his other identity and his old name: Bennett Thompson.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair descended the staircase as Elijah finished a call to the doctors at St. Anne's, from whom he was dismayed to learn that John had barred Hannah from receiving any visitors.  Blair asked Elijah if everything was okay, and Elijah turned on a dazzling smile.  He told Blair everything was very okay because they were getting married, and pulled her into a kiss.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, David and Dorian sat opposite each other, each typing furiously on a laptop, each updating their \"Myface\" status to declare their undying love and happiness.  As they canoodled, Blair and Elijah entered the room and were immediately repulsed by the impromptu makeout session.  Dorian told the younger couple they had wonderful news, but Blair preempted her by revealing that she and Elijah were getting married that day.  Startled, Dorian told her niece that Blair couldn't wed Elijah that day, because Dorian and David were getting married instead.\n\n\nBlair and Elijah were floored by the sudden news, as was the passing Langston, who entered the drawing room and demanded an explanation.  David told Langston that he'd be her new \"poppa\" and asked for a hug, then ordered Blair to call him \"uncle,\" and warned that he'd no longer tolerate her blatant advances.  David and Dorian awaited the Cramers' best wishes, but their increasingly vivid honeymoon descriptions nauseated Blair and Langston.  Neither Cramer woman was enthused about the nuptials, but Blair agreed that it was good that David and Dorian had finally reclaimed their senses and admitted to their love.  David cracked that Blair knew all too well how hard it was to get over one's true love, invoking Todd's name repeatedly and taking a potshot at Elijah.\n\n\nDorian explained that she and David had wasted too much time denying their love, but like all great relationships -- \"Bonnie and Clyde, Romeo and Juliet, Sid and Nancy\" -- \"They all died!\" Langston noted. Vivian continued as if uninterrupted, they'd endured by getting over themselves and their pride.  David promised changes to the \"chaos\" he saw at La Boulaie, and said that the Cramers were done shedding tears.  He felt the family needed a strong male influence to get the Cramer girls \"back in the saddle and bringing sexy back.\"  \"Is Ray Montez still single, Dorian?\" Blair asked warily.  When David pooh-poohed Langston's recent romantic foibles and told her he'd help her find a new man, Langston warned Dorian to muzzle her fianc\u00e9 before Langston ripped his lips off.\n\n\nAs Blair and Elijah crept off towards the patio, Dorian attempted to referee between Langston's rising anger and David's condescending remarks about the teen's love life.  When Langston pounced at him, David cowered behind Dorian's shoulder pads.  Just then, the doorbell rang, and Dorian defused the standoff by asking her daughter to answer the door.  As Langston stalked out, David suggested he and Dorian get separate beauty regimens to prepare for their wedding.  Dorian said that could wait, as she wanted to sort out Blair and Elijah's problems first.\n\n\nOn the patio, Elijah asked Blair to let him whisk her away from \"this nonsense,\" but Blair told him that the scene in the drawing room was only a taste of life with the Cramers, and asked him if he was sure he wanted that.  Elijah said he wanted it all if it meant he got her.  Cuddling up to her fianc\u00e9, Blair told Elijah he was wonderful, but she feared they'd have to postpone their wedding once more.  \"No!\" Elijah said heatedly. \"Absolutely not!\"  Whatever it took, he swore he'd marry her that very day.\n\n\nDorian ushered Blair and Elijah back into the drawing room, where Elijah suggested that she and David postpone their wedding.  Irate, David asked if Elijah thought that he and Dorian wouldn't last.  \"You're just another flash in Blair's pants,\" David snapped. \"Dorian and I are the real thing!\"  Hoping to cool tempers, Dorian told the trio that she wanted to share in Blair's newfound happiness, and vice versa, with the kind of wedding her niece deserved - a double wedding.\n\n\nBlair reminded Dorian of their drunken spectacle at Viki and Charlie, and Nora and Clint's double wedding, and asked Dorian if she really wanted to share a wedding anniversary with her and Elijah.  Dorian said she'd be honored to share the day, and the altar, with Blair and Elijah, and suggested that the ensuing press of a mayoral wedding would help Elijah's career as well.  \"It's gonna be the hottest ticket in town!\" Dorian declared.\n\n\nBlair asked if her aunt wanted a double wedding to show Viki up, but Dorian insisted that she wanted the wedding to show Llanview who the Cramer women, and their men, really were, and asked the trio if they were with her.  \"What the heck!\" Elijah cried, and told Blair he'd waited too long to stand before God and make her his; he wanted to marry her that very day, alongside David and Dorian.  \"Aren't you gonna say yes?\" David asked Blair. \"You always say yes when a guy asks you to marry him.\"\n\n\nTo Dorian's delight, Blair agreed -- they'd have a double Cramer wedding.  Dorian suggested Andrew Carpenter officiate, but Elijah seemed anxious to have a justice of the peace perform the ceremony.  His fears were abated when Dorian remembered that Andrew was out of the country on a \"church exchange.\"\n\n\nAt Rex's apartment, Rex threw on some pants just in time to greet Natalie at his door.  Natalie told him she had the reconstructed documents, and the evidence he and Kelly needed.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly arrived at the offices of the Sun, where Jessica stated point-blank that she'd slept with Ford after all.  Kelly was shocked that Ford had lied to her even after being warned about Jessica's hepatitis C.  The ladies shared their disgust for \"the dog of Llanview U,\" who'd blamed Jessica for his keeping the secret.  Collecting herself, Kelly told Jessica that \"what's done is done,\" and urged her to stay calm.  But Jessica said nothing was done; \"everyone thinks I'm having Brody's baby except me!\"\n\n\nKelly told Jessica not to lose her head.  \"Clearly you don't know me very well these days,\" Jess quipped.  Kelly insisted that all they needed to do was figure out their next move and not assume the worst, but Jessica didn't want to sugarcoat things -- the fact remained that she could be pregnant with Robert Ford's baby.  Kelly said they couldn't know for sure, and asked if Ford had seemed to feel any sense of obligation regarding the possibility of fatherhood.  Jessica said that Ford hadn't cared less, but feared she couldn't count on him to keep his mouth shut in the future; after all, \"it's Ford!\"\n\n\nKelly checked her phone and discovered Dorian, David, and Blair's Myface updates indicating their double wedding.  Before she could process her shock, she received a text message from Rex asking her to head to the apartment.  Jessica assured Kelly she'd be fine, and told her to continue her investigation.  Kelly urged Jessica not to do anything rash, and reminded her she wouldn't know for sure about the baby's paternity until she got the test results.  After Kelly left, Jessica's calm facade collapsed into a mask of worry and fear.\n\n\nAt Starr and Cole's apartment, Starr discovered the Myface updates about the Cramer double wedding.  Stunned, she asked Brody if he could drop her and Hope off at La Boulaie.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston answered the front door and was surprised to see James.  She told him he needed to call before taking her out, but James said he was there looking for Ford, who he suspected might have visited her again.  Langston reminded James that he'd only asked her out because Ford had claimed he didn't want anything to do with her, and pushed him to admit that he'd only expressed an interest in her to get under Starr and Ford's collective skin.  \"Aren't you going out with me to stick it to him?\" James countered.  He urged her to go out with him, anyway, and promised it would be painless - \"well, maybe not for Bobby.\"\n\n\nLangston took James into the living room, where David and Dorian demanded an introduction to the handsome young man.  Acting the part of the patriarch, David immediately began quizzing James about his prospects and whether he had a job.  \"Do you?\" Blair shot back.  \"Blair, I'm in character!\" David groused, and said he didn't want Langston dating \"beneath her station\" in life.\n\n\nLangston moved to flee with James, but Dorian told her she couldn't leave when a Cramer wedding was afoot.  \"Oh, God, that's still happening?\" Langston moaned.  Dorian asked Langston to be her maid of honor, while Blair realized she still had to call Starr.\n\n\nOutside, Brody and Starr arrived at the front door, and Starr thanked a departing Addie for watching Hope for her during the nuptials.  Starr told Brody he could leave, but Brody insisted on keeping watch over her per John's orders.  Just then, his replacement officer arrived, and Brody bid Starr goodbye.  Amused, Starr told him that with his protective streak he'd make a great dad.\n\n\nEntering the house, Starr headed for the living room and discovered the wedding preparations.  Overjoyed, she embraced Blair and then Elijah, and welcomed him to the family.  Realizing she had to head upstairs to get dressed for the occasion, Starr spun around, only to find James in her path.  \"What's he doing here?\" she asked, immediately assuming the younger Ford was there to see her.  James informed her that he'd stopped by to take Langston on their date.\n\n\nIrritated, Starr told James that his timing sucked; they were preparing for a family wedding, and his date would have to wait.  David disagreed and suggested James be Langston's date to the double wedding.  As James smirked at her, Starr grew petulant and complained that she didn't want \"strangers\" attending an intimate family ceremony, but Dorian said it wasn't a private celebration.  Grasping at straws, Starr told James that the wedding would be too \"sentimental\" for him.  \"I love sentimental,\" James replied, holding up his bullet necklace. \"See?\"\n\n\nAs Starr smiled at James's gesture, David rushed out of La Boulaie to summon \"Pa\" Bo to his wedding.  James asked Langston when he should be back for the ceremony, and Dorian told him to return as quickly as possible -- they'd all waited long enough for love.  Elijah agreed, kissing Blair passionately.  As the lovers swooned, Starr glared at Langston and James drawing closer together.\n\n\nBack at the Sun, Jessica stared at the headline about Ford and Hannah again, and remembered Kelly's words of wisdom about the paternity test results.  Calling the hospital, she asked a nurse when she could expect to perform the test.  As she spoke, Brody walked into the office.\n\n\nAt Starr and Cole's apartment, Cole returned home and stared at the headline about Hannah, and brooded in silence.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Kelly arrived and met with Rex and Natalie.  Natalie unveiled the photo reconstruction she'd done: A fragmented image that clearly showed Elijah's mug shot as Bennett Thompson.  \"Jackpot,\" Kelly murmured. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John assigns Brody to guard Cole so Cole charges down to the station and demands to know if it has something to do with Hannah. John reveals that Hannah may not be guilty. John holds Ford at the station and suggests that Eli Clarke is really the person who hit Ford over the head. Ford says he can tell John everything he needs to know but only in return for protection and immunity. Ford tells John that Eli hit him and told him that he would leave him alone if he blamed Hannah instead. John wonders why Eli hit him in the first place. Ford reveals that he was blackmailing Eli because he had information about his prior identity as Bennett Thompson. Natalie reports to Rex that the shredded paper they are putting back together contains a photograph. Later, she goes to Rex's apartment with the partial computer reconstruction of Bennett Thompson's booking photo. Dorian and David are back together, happily in love, and planning to get married today. Eli and Blair prepare to get married today. Blair suggests that she and Eli postpone again, but Eli refuses. Dorian suggests a double wedding. James goes to La Boulaie to ask Langston if she has seen Ford. He suggests that since he is there, they should go on the date that they were planning. Langston tells him that he only asked her out to make Starr jealous. He tells her that doesn't matter because she is only going out with him to stick it to his brother anyway. The happy couples ask James to be Langston's date to the wedding. Starr says she doesn't think he should be at a family affair. Jessica tells Kelly that she found out she and Ford did have sex so he could be her baby's father. Kelly advises Jessica not to do anything rash. Jessica calls her doctor and asks how soon into a pregnancy a paternity test can be performed just as Brody arrives at the open office door.",
