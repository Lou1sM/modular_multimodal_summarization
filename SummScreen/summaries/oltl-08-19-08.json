Frightened, she asked what he was doing there, and slowly came to the realization that it was a dream.  John seemed surprised that she didn't remember him, and Marty said she knew all she needed to know; Todd had told her how John had hurt her and left her to die.  As she reiterated Todd's false version of events, John refuted her points, saying that he would never hurt her.  He told her that Todd was the liar, a dangerous man who had hurt her far worse than he.  Marty snapped that Todd was \"the exact opposite of [John].\"  John noted that Todd was also sleeping beside her.  Marty was put off by his insinuation; \"It's not that kind of relationship.\"  She said that Todd was her friend, who took care of her.  \"In your bed?\" John asked.  He told her that he hadn't taken Todd's wife and children from him, but that Todd had done that on his own.  Marty refused to believe John's words, sure that he was a liar and a criminal and she was well rid of him.  \"So why are you dreaming about me?\" John challenged.  Marty told John she hated him, and would go back to sleep and forget all about him, but John smiled, and assured her that she'd dream of him again.  As Marty lay back, John put a tissue in her hand to dry her tears, and disappeared into the night.\n\n\nAt John's apartment, John \"awoke\" to face his own dreaming vision - of Marty.  The spectre of Marty took a look at Blair lying beside John and quipped, \"Is this a bad time?\"  Marty was struck that John would be getting over her with Todd's ex-wife, a woman who hated her.  John said that Blair didn't hate Marty, not anymore; he was overcome by seeing Marty again, and explained that he thought about her everyday.  Marty asked if that was why he'd gotten involved with Blair, to numb the pain, but John said that \"we're not involved.\"  Marty asked if he was trying to get back at Todd, and sighed with disapproval; \"Anybody but Blair...\"  She warned John that Todd was most dangerous when wounded, and that with Blair in John's arms, he was badly hurt, and would soon strike back.\n\n\nJohn said he'd protect himself and Blair from Todd.  Marty wondered if that was what John was trying to do: \"Save Blair.\"  \"It is your way, isn't it?\" she mused aloud.  She said he'd had the same hero complex  with all of his women: Herself, Natalie, Evangeline.  Marty theorized that he was trying to reenact his failed romance with Caitlin Fitzgerald, with a different result, but each time he lost the woman he loved anyway.  \"If  you couldn't save me, how can you save Blair?\"  She urged him not to underestimate the danger of Todd and his vindictive nature, and said she knew it better than anyone.  John insisted that he could handle Todd, but Marty wasn't so sure.  She wondered if she could've been \"the one\" for John, but both she and John agreed they'd never know.  Looking to Blair, Marty cryptically commented that she should be where Blair was, and Blair should be where she was.  John asked what Marty meant by that, but Marty said she had to go.  \"You'll see me again,\" she told John, and the lovers shared a passionate kiss before Marty disappeared, leaving John in tears.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan ranch, Bo wandered through the deserted drawing room alone, only to find himself communing with the spectre of Asa.  Bo said he was glad he'd found his \"Pa\" again, and that it was time for them to put the past to bed for good.  He recounted to Asa what he'd gone through in recent weeks, and said he wasn't sure what his trip to 1968 had been; dream, fantasy, or something else.  When Asa learned Bo had had to stand in as him, he growled that Bo had \"big boots to fill.\"  Bo said Asa's boots hadn't fit him at all.  Bo told his father that he'd hated having to live Asa's life, having to treat people, especially women, as Asa had, and that as a result of Asa's domineering presence, Bo and Clint were still carrying around Asa's legacy in the present.  Asa said he'd done it all for his family, and snarled that he was a good father, whether or not Bo wanted to admit it.\n\n\nBo told Asa he'd felt empty when Asa died, because he'd never been able to fully prove himself to him.  Asa brushed that off, telling Bo that he was overthinking things as usual.  Bo said he wasn't like Asa in that he hadn't wanted to conquer or control women, but only wanted to be truly loved.  Asa scoffed at the assertion that Lindsay truly cared for Bo, and said she'd only been looking for a ticket out of prison.  Bo said that that was the way Asa saw things, but not reality; he said that his father had used women and pushed them away in his youth so he couldn't get fully involved, or hurt.  \"Better them than me,\" Asa replied.  Bo said that through his 1968 experience, he had found a way to finally let go of Asa.  Asa asked what his son would do without him, and Bo said he'd start over, and live for himself.  \"You'll always be Asa Buchanan's son,\" Asa intoned.  Bo countered that he'd also always be just Bo, his own man.  Asa chuckled, and said it was about time Bo had figured that part out.  Bo asked why Asa had never told him that, and Asa explained that Bo had had to learn about himself in his own time.  \"Rest now, Pa,\" Bo said.  He told Asa he'd miss him, and Asa replied that he'd miss Bo too.  \"You and your brother were the best things I ever did,\" Asa declared.  When Bo turned back to face him again, Asa was gone, leaving only his bar glass on the chair where he'd been sitting.\n\n\nAt the cottage, Brody brooded over Adriana's note, and Rex's toothbrush which she had sent along.  He hid the items behind a cushion when Shane came down the stairs complaining of bad dreams.  Shane told Brody that he'd dreamed that Brody wasn't really his father.  He said he'd dreamed Brody had died in the war, and worried that he'd go away if Gigi chose Rex, who Shane knew she loved, over Brody.  What if Gigi wanted Rex to be Shane's new dad, the boy asked?  Brody comforted his \"son,\" assuring Shane that even if Gigi and Rex were together, he wouldn't leave him, and would always be a big part of his life.  He said he couldn't make Gigi want what-or who-she didn't want, but when Shane said he wished his mother would see what she had in \"Dad,\" Brody couldn't help but agree. \n\n\nAs \"father and son\" played cards together, Shane explained that Gigi had never dated after Brody had left, and said that he knew that it was because she'd missed Rex, not Brody.  He confessed that when Gigi had stood up at Adriana's wedding, he'd been hoping that Rex would leave Adriana for his mother and make them a family.  Shane admitted that for a time, he'd wanted Rex to be his dad, and apologized to Brody.  Brody said it was all right; he understood.  He promised to always be there for Shane.  After Shane went back to bed, Brody uncovered Adriana's package, and mused over the contents again.\n\n\nIn 1968, Gigi was overjoyed to find Rex, but shocked to find him in bed with another woman-who looked exactly like her.  \"Who the hell is that?!\" she exclaimed.  Awkward and flustered, Rex leapt out of bed and embraced Gigi, who explained that she'd found her way back through time with Madame Delphina's help.  She couldn't get over the sight of the woman in his bed, and repeatedly asked how Rex could do that to her.  Rex said he only did it after learning she'd slept with Brody, but Gigi immediately saw through Brody's deception and gave Rex the true story.  Before Gigi could start railing at Rex about his \"cheatin' ways\" again, Emma spoke up, and told Gigi that he was only with her because of Gigi, who he'd thought he couldn't have.  Rex gave Gigi the full story behind his and Bo's trip to 1968, and how he thought he'd lost all chance of returning to the future, and sought comfort in the only woman who could remind him of her.  Rex swore to Gigi that he loved her and only her.  As Rex and Gigi embraced, Emma took that as her cue to leave and wished the lovers luck as she skipped out.\n\n\nAlone at last, Rex and Gigi compared notes.  Rex explained that he was set to go to Vietnam the next morning in Bo's place, and that though Emma had been the closest thing to Gigi that he could find in his misery, she wasn't Gigi.  Rex told her again that he was sorry, and that he loved her.  Though she was still perturbed, Gigi melted at his words, and said she'd been waiting so long for him to say that, which led to a passionate kiss.  After a brief makeout session, Rex explained to Gigi the connections between Madame Delphina and Professor Fina, who had gotten Bo home but not Rex.  Gigi said they had to go home and get back to Shane and their friends and family, but Rex wasn't sure it was possible-according to Professor Fina, the portal was closed and would not open again for twenty years.  Gigi was horrified at the prospect of being lost in the past, but Rex comforted her, promising they'd find a way back.  They embraced and walked off across the ranch house, with both Gigi and Rex agreeing they were glad they'd found each other again.\n\n\n",

    "tvmega_recap": "Gigi is traveling in 1968 and at the ranch. She seems to know that Rex is nearby. And she goes to find him in bed with Emma. She is upset but later realizes that he only loves her. He explains to her that Brody gave him reason to believe that she was done with him and sleeping with Brody. She tells him that is not true. And they conclude that they were meant for each other. Back in Llanview, Shane has a premonition that he will \"lose\" Brody, find out he is not his real dad and he admits to Brody that he can sense that maybe Rex is his real father and the right man for his mom. John is dreaming while Blair is in his bed. He sees Marty. She informs him that she believes what Todd has told her about him. At that same time, Marty dreams about John when Todd is sleeping in her bed. She asks him if he is the right person for her or if Blair is. Bo talks to Asa's ghost and stands up to his father by telling him he no longer wants to fill Asa's shoes. He does not treat women the way Asa does and is proud to be himself whether Asa approves of his choices or not.",
