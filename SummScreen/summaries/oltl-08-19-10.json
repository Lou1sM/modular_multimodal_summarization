He asked why she was making such a call, since he knew it couldn't be for their expected baby. Jessica quickly hung up and explained that she was working on a story for the newspaper, and she wouldn't be able to give Brody any details on it.\n\n\nBrody and Jessica settled down to look at the book with baby names. Brody thought he should have a say in the name since the baby was half his. He had circled some names and chosen some that were \"gender neutral,\" since they didn't know whether the baby would be a boy or girl. He noticed that Jessica had circled mostly girl's names, and he wondered if she had an idea about the baby's sex. Jessica denied that she did, but she indicated that twins ran in her family so it was a possibility. She also knew that she wanted the baby to be just like Brody.\n\n\nNeither wanted to share what they were working on, though Jessica voiced her desire to be able to tell Brody everything. He voiced the same. They shared a kiss, and each expressed their love for the other. Jessica picked up where she had left off before Brody had arrived and called the doctor's office. She asked when a paternity test could be given. She appeared distressed as she ended the call.\n\n\nJohn questioned Ford in the interrogation room, but the young man was reluctant to talk at first. Realizing that there was no alternative, he told John about his past and how he knew Eli's true identity. Ford revealed that when he had lived in Los Angeles, he'd had an affair with a woman named Olivia. As it turned out, she was married to Bennett Thompson. The woman insisted on meeting at her own house, and she was very rich, Ford continued. One day she just disappeared, the house was deserted, and he couldn't track her down. She'd simply vanished.\n\n\nJohn asked how the pair had met, and Ford revealed they had met at an art gallery. She'd spoken a lot about her husband, who had apparently only married her for her money. He remembered the photos of Olivia's husband around her house, but he didn't realize that Eli and Bennett were the same man until he'd arrived in Llanview and gotten involved with David's reality show. David had hired Eli as his attorney. Ford tried to get Eli to admit who he was and even threatened to go to the police. He knew Eli must have been hiding something and, being desperate for money, Ford began to blackmail him. Eli had threatened to go after James.\n\n\nJohn assigned someone to keep watch over James. Ford wished that Eli were behind bars, but that angered John. Thanks to Ford's lies and his choice not to involve the police sooner, Eli was still out on the street. He wondered why Ford hadn't gone to the police when Olivia disappeared, but Ford had thought she'd run away. He only wanted to protect her and himself. Ford thought it quite an irony that Eli was so bad he made Ford look like a good guy.\n\n\nKelly held onto her reconstructed mug shot of Eli Clarke and bumped headfirst into David as she hurried to see John. They had some words, but Kelly quickly tore away and burst in on John and Ford. John was miffed and ordered her out of the room because he was taking care of police business. He would see her later, he added.\n\n\nDavid found Nora peering into Bo's office window as her husband drew a map for the newly hired Inez. Bo wanted to make sure Inez didn't get lost as she tried to maneuver her way around the police station. David gave a look at Inez and predicted disaster for Nora's new marriage. \"Kiss pa goodbye,\" he proclaimed. Nora advised him that Inez was Bo's new assistant, but David didn't want to hear any explanations. He reminded Nora that Clint had married his new assistant, and he thought that Nora should \"take off the blinders.\"\n\n\nAnnoyed that David referred to her as \"ma,\" Nora told him the situation was different. David stated that Nora was \"sitting on a powder keg waiting to blow. Tick Tock!\" He added that first Bo would arrive home late from work, and then Inez would do her best to get chummy with Nora as she complimented Nora on many facets of her life. He thought his own marriage would last longer than Nora's if she let things continue. He revealed that he was getting married to Dorian. Nora couldn't believe that Dorian would be her new daughter-in-law.\n\n\nDavid rushed into Bo's office and announced that he wanted to speak to his father. Inez was surprised to learn that David was Bo's son. David was annoyed that Bo didn't have any photos of David around, and he promised to give his dad a wedding photo. Bo learned about the wedding, and David asked if Bo approved. \"Will it stop you?\" Bo asked. David asked if the question was a trick or if he'd lose his inheritance if he married Dorian. He didn't wait for Bo to answer but declared his love for Dorian instead. Bo thought that was a good response, but he wouldn't give his approval. David asked Bo to be his best man.\n\n\nInez and Nora met in the hallway. Inez exclaimed how kind and generous Bo was. She complimented Nora on her job and her son. David's dire predictions played through Nora's head as she spoke to Inez. Nora wondered if Nate was Inez's only son and was surprised to hear that Inez had two others. Nora quickly assured Inez that David was not her son, and Inez agreed that Nora couldn't be old enough. Nora heard David's voice in her head again. Inez admitted she and the boys' father had \"parted ways\" long before.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian continued to lay out her wedding plans and thought that James should don a suit if he planned to accompany Langston to the wedding. Starr thought she should have a word with Langston, but Dorian wondered why. She thought that James was a vast improvement over the vile Robert Ford. Starr was happy to point out that James was Robert's brother.\n\n\nLangston was annoyed with Starr, and while Dorian agreed she could see the resemblance, she thought it best to have a word with Langston, who refused. Langston noted that James was nothing like his brother, but when Dorian reminded her that James had almost gotten Starr killed, it was Langston who wanted to speak to Dorian. Starr advised James that she didn't want him to hurt Langston, but he retorted that he wasn't the \"hurting kind.\"\n\n\nOutside, Blair was less than thrilled to have to share her wedding day with her aunt, but Eli was happy. He'd never expected to get married and didn't mind the situation. Blair thought it was almost strange that Eli had never been married. He would look to her to lead the way due to her experience, he told her. He assured her that this marriage would be different from the others. He wanted her to think about buying a house he had seen.\n\n\nOut in the foyer, Dorian revealed that she knew Langston was trying to make Ford jealous. Langston pointed out that Dorian has just been through a similar scenario with David, but Dorian wasn't eager to discuss her own situation. Langston announced her intention to go out with James, citing the fact that it was only one date. She didn't care if Dorian liked it or not. Dorian interrupted Eli and Blair and exclaimed that she needed help with Langston and Ford. Eli uttered that he didn't like the man.\n\n\nEli and Blair headed into the house, and Eli introduced himself to James, who looked at him guardedly. \"I think you know my brother,\" James stated. \"Who's your brother?\" Eli inquired. \"Robert Ford,\" James replied. \"Oh,\" Eli said. He assumed that Bobby had told James that Eli was \"bad news.\" James agreed that he had. Eli thought it was simply because he had represented Hannah, but she was entitled to a defense, and that was his job. He didn't want James to hold it against him.\n\n\nDorian told Blair about Langston's situation, and Langston quickly announced that the brothers were nothing alike. Blair agreed that was usually the case, referring to Ross and Eli. Blair had a problem with all that James had done to Starr though.\n\n\nAs Eli and James chatted, the women reappeared. Dorian announced that because of all that James had done to Starr, he would not be permitted to be anywhere near a Cramer woman ever again.\n\n\nStarr left La Boulaie and arrived at her own apartment to find Cole already there. She wondered if John had told him why the cops were guarding them. Cole only knew it had something to do with Hannah, and Starr jumped at the thought that Hannah had escaped and was after them. Cole thought Starr had to be kidding. He disclosed that Hannah was innocent of all the charges made against her. He admitted that John hadn't exactly told him that, but John had made it obvious that she hadn't pushed Marty.\n\n\nStarr pondered the fact that Cole thought Hannah was innocent of everything, and Cole agreed that she also hadn't attacked Ford. Starr reminded him that Hannah had lied and tried to break them up. She would never forgive her for those things. Cole conceded that he wasn't asking Starr to forgive those acts. Starr wondered who had actually committed the attacks on Marty and Ford. All Cole knew was that it wasn't Hannah, and Starr agreed to accept it. She didn't want to fight, and she believed him, she replied. She informed him they would have to get ready for the wedding, and she filled him in on the latest. She said it was a great, but Cole thought that Starr didn't appear to be excited.\n\n\nHe wondered if she still wanted to talk about Hannah, but Starr admitted it was about James. He had showed up at La Boulaie to see Langston, and he was taking her to the wedding as a date. Langston only wanted to make Ford jealous. Cole asked if James wanted to make Starr jealous. Starr agreed that was probably so. \"Well, is it working?\" he wanted to know. \"Does it bother you?\" Starr asked, adding that she thought that Langston would regret it if she were dating James for the wrong reasons. Cole was worried about Langston, but Starr didn't think there was a need for that. She was sure Dorian wouldn't allow Langston to date James when she heard he was Ford's brother.\n\n\nFord appreciated the protection that John had arranged, but he still wanted immunity. He thought he had given John a lot of information. \"We'll see,\" John answered. Ford thought he and his brother would be dead if he actually didn't give enough detail. John tossed him a pad of paper and a pen and told him to write everything down. He stepped out of the office and saw Kelly with the mug shot photograph of Eli. She wondered if she had enough to get Eli arrested before Blair married him.\n\n\nJohn noticed that parts of the photo were missing, and he asked where Kelly had obtained it. She tried to deflect John's questions but finally admitted she had broken into Eli's hotel room. John wasn't happy to hear that, but Kelly wanted him to get the warrant.\n\n\nDavid revealed that he was getting married that day, but Bo didn't think he could leave the office. A disappointed David reminded his father that David had saved Bo's own wedding day. He persuaded Bo to join him and pointed out that it would be a good time for them to purge reminders of ill-fated weddings in the past. David left the office and found Nora and Inez together. Inez left on her errand, and David asked Nora to write a wedding toast. He whispered that she should not let Bo spend time with Inez. John and Kelly appeared, and John asked to meet with Bo and Nora.\n\n\nHe told them that Eli was not the only alias of Bennett Thompson. The station was investigating the name on the mug shot. Kelly explained how Eli always showed up whenever she and Rex were getting close to finding anything out. Eli had killed a clerk in Boston and her mother, Kelly stated. She grilled John and included herself in the \"we\" handling the investigation. John grew more annoyed by the seconds. Bo suggested she let John do his job. Kelly was livid that criminals had more rights than the victims.\n\n\nBo told the group about the wedding and the fact that they couldn't tip Eli off. John nodded his head at Brody who had just arrived at the station and looked through the office window. John told the assembled group that it wasn't Hannah who had committed the crimes against Ford and Marty. Eli had also threatened to hurt Cole, which was the reason that Hannah had swallowed the pills. Eli had forced her to do it. Nora realized that was the reason Eli had been shocked when she told him that Hannah had survived. John stressed that they needed to obtain the warrant before Eli knew what was going on. John revealed that Robert Ford was a witness to Eli's multiple identities. Kelly left to get ready for the wedding.\n\n\nInez looked at her map and wandered around, trying to find the correct room. She opened one of the doors and found Ford sitting at a table, writing. Ford jumped up, angered to see his mother walk in the door. He asked if John had sent her. Inez revealed that she worked there, and she wanted to know what he was doing. Ford mentioned that the police were using him to get information on someone else. He wanted her to stay away from him, and he didn't want her to pretend she cared. Inez asked about a lawyer, but Ford explained that he had been given the runaround. He shouted at her to leave.\n\n\nShe walked out and thumbed through the top file in the stack she held in her arm. It was Cole's file, and she looked for the name of his attorney. It was Elijah Clarke. She made a phone call to him. As Ford sat in the room and wrote, he thought back to Eli's threats.\n\n\nJames apologized to the group for his actions. He wasn't sorry he'd met Starr and learned about her family. In fact, he was jealous of her, he stated. She got to be surrounded by people who loved her, and he thought he could learn a lot by being around Langston. He wanted another chance. Dorian spoke up first. \"You got me with jealous of the family,\" she said. Blair muttered to Langston that it was all a mistake if she thought it was only to get back at Ford. It was certain to backfire.\n\n\nDavid wandered in and berated Dorian for standing in the way of young love. He waxed poetic, and by the time he was finished, Dorian was eating out of his hand. She agreed that Langston and James could see each other. \"But you hurt my daughter, you're a dead man,\" she said to James. David told Dorian that Bo would be his best man. \"Oh,\" she said, looking flustered.\n\n\nBlair kicked Eli out, pointing out that she had to get ready for her wedding. She apologized again for all the charges that Kelly had leveled at him. She ran upstairs, and Eli paused to answer his phone. It was Inez, and she told him she needed a lawyer for her son. Eli said he was sorry, but he was booked up. He offered to give her a referral. Inez was firm and explained that her son was being held at the station. His name was Robert Ford, and he was being held at the police station when he had done nothing wrong. The police wanted information on someone else. Eli changed his mind and agreed to help.\n\n\nBlair's phone began to ring, but when she saw that it was Kelly, she ignored the call. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Kelly is working to get the goods on Eli. Blair is making him believe that she trusts him and is not onto him. John has persuaded Robert Ford to tell him all he knows about Eli and write a statement. Robert might be their key witness since he has known of Eli's shady history and all of his aliases. But in an attempt to \"help\" her son, Inez calls a lawyer for Robert. And little does she know it's the very person who is threatening him and who the cops want him to implicate. Eli lets Robert know if he divulges what he knows, then James, his mother, Langston and many people he knows will die and it will be on Robert's hands. At that point, Robert chickens out. David is gloating about his wedding plans to Dorian. Jessica is uneasy about the possibility that Ford could be the father of her baby and has not told Brody of her suspicions.",
