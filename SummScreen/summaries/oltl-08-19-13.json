Rama hid when she saw Dorian make her entrance. Dorian headed to her portrait and asked Cutter to move it closer to the stage. Carl Peterson approached Dorian, and they made small talk as Jo and Leo did some filming for David's show.\n\n\nAwkwardly, Jo and David introduced themselves to Carl as Dorian led Carl away. Rama stopped in front of Dorian and offered up a tray of filled champagne glasses. \"Champagne when served by a slut loses its bubbles,\" Dorian declared as she refused a glass.\n\n\nA breathless Viki, who was to be mistress of ceremonies, ran toward the entrance to the club. Diego promised her that she wasn't late, and Viki apologized for Clint's behavior. Viki entered the club and spotted Jeffrey and Destiny first. \"Are you two...?\" she began. \"Officially dating? Yes,\" Jeffrey replied.\n\n\nViki saw Natalie next and assured her that Clint had seemed okay when she'd stopped to see him, and he'd quit drinking. Viki related that she'd suggested that he go home to bed. Natalie was certain that Clint had hidden bottles of alcohol around his office.\n\n\nViki's next stop was to greet Carl, and she pulled him along to meet Bo. Carl thanked Bo for stepping in during an awkward time. Bo and Nora stopped to chat with Dani and Arturo, who wanted to know how the investigation into Briana's death was going. Bo stated that Briana had not been forgotten.\n\n\nT\u00e9a saw her daughter with the older man and beckoned her over. \"Who's that guy?\" T\u00e9a asked. Dani replied that Arturo was Briana's uncle, the man she'd helped after Briana's death. Dani continued that Arturo was still at loose ends, and since he'd had an extra ticket that had been meant for Briana, Dani had agreed to accompany him to the gala.\n\n\nDani wondered about her mother's much younger date, Dean. \"To be continued,\" T\u00e9a called out as Dani headed over to speak to Michelle. The two young women began to argue about their identical dresses, and the fact that Dani hadn't appeared at the hospital when Drew had been ill. Dani blamed everything on Michelle and accused Michelle of being jealous that Dani and Matthew were roommates. Dani stormed off.\n\n\nMatthew saw the girls arguing and approached Michelle. She whined about Dani, even as she thanked Matthew for being so generous and buying the dress for her. Matthew promised to take care of it and walked over to Arturo and Dani.\n\n\nArturo received a phone call and walked away. \"Lay off Michelle,\" Matthew ordered Dani. He urged her to \"suck up to your sugar daddy\" instead. He was able to stop Dani as she raised her hand to slap him.\n\n\nMatthew assured a sulking Michelle that she looked better in the dress than Dani did. Bo and Nora noticed Jeffrey and Destiny together. Bo had hoped that Destiny and Matthew were getting together again, but Nora responded that the couple had only drawn closer because of Drew's illness. She made fun of Bo for being a romantic.\n\n\nCarl and Dorian made small talk. He praised her and noted that she'd been treated poorly in Washington. Jo and Leo continued to film them as Jo reminded David that Dorian had accused him of being the one who had cheated.\n\n\nT\u00e9a kept an eye on Dani and Arturo. Matthew wandered over and heard what Dani had told T\u00e9a about Arturo. Matthew informed T\u00e9a that not only was Arturo not Briana's uncle, but Arturo had paid Briana to sleep with him. Furious, T\u00e9a ran over and pulled Arturo away from Dani. \"Why did you lie to me?\" T\u00e9a shouted. As they began to create a scene, Viki encouraged everyone to take a seat.\n\n\nClint sat drinking in his office. He pulled out his checkbook and wrote a check, and then picked up the phone to ask for his limo. He stumbled around the office, barely able to stand on his feet. \"Ready or not, here I come,\" he mumbled.\n\n\nViki welcomed everyone to the gala and spoke of the wonderful auction they'd be holding. She announced that the \"glorious portrait\" of Dorian would be auctioned off first. Viki opened the bidding, and silence greeted her. Viki tried to get the crowd going, but the awkward silence continued. Finally, Carl shouted that he would bid $100,000. The portrait was his.\n\n\nMatthew fretted over Drew, but Destiny checked on their son and assured Matthew that the boy was fine. Natalie ordered a special martini at the bar. Nikki replied, \"Your date has been banging me for months.\" She added that Cutter had no intention of stopping.\n\n\nCutter sat down with Natalie. He tried to say that it wasn't what it appeared to be, but Natalie didn't want to hear it. She suggested that Cutter receive a certain sex act \"from the bitch behind me,\" instead. Cutter turned to glare at Nikki, who blew him a kiss.\n\n\nCarl was introduced as the keynote speaker as outside, Clint staggered to the club's entrance. \"Not you again,\" Diego moaned. Inside, Carl spoke about the country's freedom and security, and the high price that many who had served had paid. Blair sat and listened as tears rolled down her face. T\u00e9a promised, \"He'll be back, Blair.\"\n\n\nThe crowd toasted the veterans, and Viki took to the podium again. Nikki arrived at Natalie's table with the drink, but she poured it on Natalie instead. Rama quickly rushed Natalie off to the ladies' room.\n\n\nAs Viki spoke of Bo's good deeds and virtues, Clint stumbled down the steps. Bo stepped up to receive his trophy, but Clint walked up, pushed Bo out of the way, and grabbed onto the trophy himself. \"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. From the bottom of my heart, screw all of you,\" he shouted.\n\n\nJack found Kate sitting in her classroom, grading papers. She didn't hear him arrive but was happy to see him. They two began to kiss, undress, and make love on Kate's desk.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian asks Cutter to move her portrait closer to the stage. Carl explains that it is a very nice picture. Dorian is flattered that he likes it. Viki makes her way to Shelter with moments to spare. She asks if they should start the evening. She gives a speech. While this is going on, Nikki pours a drink on Natalie and Rama takes her to go get cleaned up in the bathroom. Jack shows up at Kate's classroom and wants to be with her. Katie is worried but Jack assures her that no one knows he is there. During the auction, Carl buys Dorian's painting for a lot of money when no one else seems to be interested. During Carl's speech, Blair seems to be very sad. When Bo is about to accept the award, Clint shows up and grabs the award and screams to everyone that it is his, and they all should screw themselves.",
