Dorian screamed that all of her senses were alive again, and that she could smell \"the deliciousness of the roses\" and the newly mown grass.  When Viki asked if Dorian was high on tea, Dorian revealed that she was high on love.  Dorian explained that the currents of emotion could run deep and sometimes it could take a little time to ignite them.  Dorian then announced that she was getting married, and Viki asked who Dorian was marrying and correctly assumed that this time Dorian was marrying a man.  When Dorian said, \"David Vickers Buchanan,\" Viki applauded.\n\n\nDorian insisted that David had begged and pleaded with Dorian to get back together, and that he had proposed.  Dorian informed Viki that the wedding would take place that day with another couple, her niece, Blair, and Elijah Clarke.  \"Yes, this afternoon in a double wedding extravaganza, which I tell you just based on sheer impulsive passion, is going to put all other weddings to shame.\"  Viki expressed confusion, because the last she had heard was that Dorian was seeing Clint.  Dorian explained the situation with Clint, David, and Mandy, and that all the foolishness was over.  Dorian claimed that the person David and Dorian had to thank the most for their reunion was Viki.\n\n\nViki was surprised to see Dorian happy and was shocked when Dorian apologized, because she had never thought to hear the words, \"I'm sorry,\" from Dorian.  Outraged, Dorian started to leave, and Viki begged her to stop.  \"Oh no, no, don't go.  Please, Dorian, please don't go.  Please don't.  See...I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  See how easy that is.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  What I really meant to say was you have nothing to thank me for.\"\n\n\nHowever, Dorian claimed that Charlie and Viki's childish charade had prompted David and Dorian's reunion.  Dorian exclaimed that it was due to Viki's revenge over Joey, and to seeing the appalling sight of Viki and David in bed together that Dorian and David's admitted their mutual love.  Viki voiced that the thought of revenge over Joey had not occurred to her, but that she guessed she deserved Dorian's wrath.  After she insisted that David never would have gone through with making love to Viki, Dorian stated that Charlie belonged to Viki, and that David belonged to Dorian, therefore, it was a win-win situation.\n\n\nViki was surprised that Dorian would want Charlie and Viki at her wedding, and that the wedding was to take place that day.  Dorian explained that she had contingency plans to cover almost anything, since she was the major.  After Viki gave a definite maybe to the invitation, Dorian said, \"David and I are registered online.  Don't stint.  This is going to be my last wedding,\" and left.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, David told Kelly not to mess up his wedding day, and not to be late.  Kelly asked David, as he ran out the door, if he knew where Blair was.  Kelly then found Eli in the parlor and congratulated him.  Eli asked Kelly about her theory that Eli was her mother's murderer, and that he was Bennett Thompson.  He demanded that Kelly back off, and Kelly replied, \"Or what?  You'll give me a heart attack too?\"\n\n\nAt Todd's mansion, Blair called for Dani up the stairs, as Dani talked on her cell phone to Nate about his newly found brothers.  Blair entered Dani's room and invited her to the wedding.  Dani was surprised about the suddenness of the wedding and asked where Blair and Eli were going for their honeymoon.  Blair realized that she and Eli had not yet talked about their honeymoon, as she grabbed Dani's hand.  Dani cried that she would be unable to attend.\n\n\nDani insisted that she had to stay home for Todd's call, in case he found T\u00e9a.  However, Blair refused to get married without Dani.  As Blair carried a board game to the table, Dani stressed that she did not want Blair to postpone the wedding for her.  Blair insisted on Dani's attendance and claimed that Eli would understand.  \"Believe me, there's not a mean bone in Uncle Eli's body.\"\n\n\nDani begged Blair to marry her Uncle Eli that day and maintained that she could not attend and bring all of the guests down.  But Blair related that Kelly would be attending anyway, and that Kelly was already \"the downer.\"  However, Blair agreed to marry Eli that day.  Blair and Dani joked about the lack of planning for the honeymoon.  Dani then observed that she missed T\u00e9a, and Blair hugged Dani, as she stated that she did too.  \n\n\nWhen Dani told Blair that Blair had meant a lot to her mother, Blair agreed that she and T\u00e9a had \"come a long way,\" since they had once been \"mortal enemies.\"  Blair asked Dani if she wanted Blair to deliver a message to Nate at the country club, where the wedding would be, or if Dani wanted to deliver it in person.  Dani said that she would need to find a dress, and they hugged and laughed.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Country Club, Matthew called for the towel boy, as he handed his empty glass to Nate.  \"My ice melted.\"  Matthew then changed his mind and demanded a can on ice to keep his drink cold.  Nate asked, \"Why are you being such a bitch?\"  Matthew responded that he would talk to Nate's manager about Nate's treatment of the guests.  \"Oh, Salinger, summer's not over yet, and I intend on making it as painful as possible for you, so get used to it.\"\n\n\nAlso at the country club, Shaun ran to Destiny and Darren and demanded to know why he had needed to rush over.  Destiny cried, \"Dani.  And why you won't help her dad find her mom?\"  Destiny knew that Shaun was up to something, and that Todd had asked Shaun to find T\u00e9a.  David arrived and yelled that he had a big announcement that they all would never guess.  Destiny stated, \"You're marrying Dorian.\"\n\n\nDavid was disappointed that Destiny had ruined his surprise, since they were supposed to be \"BFF's,\" but Destiny pointed out that David had already posted the news on MyFace.  Matthew indicated, as he walked up, that the whole point of posting on MyFace was so that everyone could see it.  Darren quoted love lines of Shakespeare to Destiny and then asked if David had pursued Dorian or vice versa.  David replied, \"Need you ask, Derwin?  When it comes to me, Dorian always comes crawling back for a little bit more.\"  David invited Destiny, Darren, Matthew, and Shaun to the wedding.  David insisted that he would need Shaun to act as a bodyguard, since the wedding would be such a big event, that he was sure someone would probably get shot.\n\n\nDavid then told Matthew that he had wanted his little brother to be his best man, but that their pa had insisted on doing the honors.  However, David told Matthew to arrive with Fawn on his arm, unless he still wanted \"Miss Smarty.\"  Matthew declared that Miss Smarty could rotate for all he cared, as long as she did not attend the wedding with the loser.  \"Plus I wouldn't want my big brother's wedding to be ruined.\"\n\n\nSpotting Nate, David invited the \"pool boy\" to act as Miss Smarty's date, as Matthew winced.  Matthew grabbed David's arm, and as they rushed to another area, he informed David that the pool boy was Nate, the loser.  \"The point is you're my brother.  You're supposed to have my back.\"  David then uninvited Nate, however, Nate declared that he would be at the wedding, anyway, serving drinks.  Nate informed Matthew that if he tried to embarrass Nate in front of Dani, he would only hurt Dani.  Nate insisted that Dani was fragile, since her mother was dying.  When Matthew scoffed, Destiny verified that it was true.  Matthew was shocked and wondered why Destiny had not told him about T\u00e9a.  Destiny claimed that she had not wanted to ruin Matthew's fun.\n\n\nDavid declared, \"Leave it to T\u00e9a to upstage my wedding.  Dorian is not going to like this.\"  Matthew apologized to Destiny, and when he asked if she had talked to Dani, Destiny asked how she could have talked to Dani, when her mother was dying.  David sympathized, \"Yes, yes, that's terribly tragic and all, but we have a wedding to attend -- mine.  Dagwood, gentlemen, tux time.\"\n\n\nDani arrived at the country club and joined Destiny and Shaun.  After Destiny introduced Shaun to her, Dani stated that she knew who Shaun was and demanded to know why Shaun had refused to help her dad find her mother.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, in the interrogation room, Inez announced that she had secured a lawyer for Ford and handed him the phone.  Eli sneered over the phone, \"Hello, Bobby.  I hear you've been a bad boy.\"  Eli told Bobby that he had heard that Ford had been \"singing his little heart out,\" and that every person that Ford cared for, including his mother, brother, and even Langston, would die, if Ford did not keep quiet.  Bobby reminded Eli of his letter, and Eli stated that he was sure that the letter would be a great comfort to Ford's mother and hung up.  Bobby demanded that Inez never talk to Eli again and begged her to stay out of his life.  After he screamed for her to leave, Inez sadly left the room.\n\n\nIn Bo's office at the police station, John informed Bo and Nora that according to Hannah, Eli Clarke had pushed Marty down the stairs, and Bo added that Eli must have attacked Ford also.  John revealed that Ford had been blackmailing Eli, since he had known that Eli was Bennett Thompson.  When Bo asked about the evidence in the file, Nora stated that the mug shot was inadmissible.  When Detective Price carried in the files, Nora indicated that they were out of time, because if Eli \"gets wind of what we're doing here, he'll blow Dodge.\"\n\n\nAs he held up a picture of a more youthful Eli, John revealed that the man in the photo was Greg Pattison, who had been arrested and cleared of his wife's murder, when it had been determined that she had died of a heart attack.  Nora advised that Eli's change of identity would not get them a warrant, but that they still had Bobby Ford.  However, Bo questioned if Ford's story would hold up in court.  Nora realized that Eli was a flight risk and suggested that they arraign him for assault.  Bo told John that the evidence discovered by Kelly was tainted, but John said that he would find a way around that and left.\n\n\nNora entered the interrogation room and asked for Ford's signed statement.  Bobby insisted that he could not sign it, because it was a lie, and that Hannah had actually attacked him.  When Nora asked if Eli had threatened him, Ford maintained that he could not sign the statement and crumpled it up.\n\n\nInez walked into Bo's office and told Bo that Bobby had been arrested and that she had put Ford in touch with an attorney, Eli Clarke.  Bo filled Inez in on Eli and their suspicions.  When Nora reentered Bo's office and announced that Bobby had recanted his testimony, Inez cried that it was all her fault.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Eli speculated that Kelly might be hostile and crazy, like her mother, but Kelly insisted that she just did not want Blair to be played for a fool.  Kelly stressed that she was so crazy, she could see through Eli's act.  \"I think you are trying to break into the big leagues...and you will kill anyone who stands in your way.\"  Eli demanded that Kelly show him the proof and reminded her that she had killed Blair's unborn child.  Eli exclaimed that if proof existed, John would be at La Boulaie with a warrant for his arrest, just as John walked in.\n\n\nJohn announced that he was at the mansion to make an arrest and then arrested Kelly for breaking into Eli's hotel room.  Eli voiced that Kelly's behavior had gotten erratic and stated that he had heard that Ford had been arrested.  John verified that Ford had been at the police station for questioning but had been released.  As John escorted Kelly out of La Boulaie in handcuffs, he told Detective Price that the detective knew what he had to do.\n\n\nOnce Eli walked out of La Boulaie, Detective Price called and updated John, who told Price not to lose sight of Eli.  At the police station, John explained to Kelly that he had needed to arrest her, in order to get the evidence in at trial against Eli.  When Kelly asked for the handcuffs to be removed, John ran out of the room and into Bo's office, where Nora blamed Inez for letting Eli \"go free.\"  Nora updated John about Ford's refusal to sign the statement and yelled, \"And now we got nothing.  No way to get an arrest warrant.\"  Bo indicated that Kelly's evidence was a start, and Nora wondered if they even could use it.\n\n\nNora stated that she would try to scare up an arrest warrant from the judge, and John insisted that he would try to get Ford to change his mind about signing the statement.  Nora asked how John could do that, since Eli had obviously threatened Ford and had even put him in the hospital at one time.  \"What do you think Clarke's going to do to Ford, if he thinks Ford gave him up?\"  Outside Bo's office, Inez looked at her framed picture of Bobby, as a child.  John said, \"It's a long shot.  I've got one card to play,\" as Ford gazed at the ceiling in the interrogation room.\n\n\nAs John took the handcuffs off of Kelly's wrists, Kelly remarked, \"I assume this means I can go.\"  John replied, \"No, not yet.\"  Kelly begged, \"Come on.  Are you serious, John?\"  John responded, \"I don't like it any more than you do, but you're right.  I need your help.  I can't bust Eli without you.\"\n\n\nBlair held up a wedding dress standing before a mirror, when Eli walked in.  Blair laughed and said, \"Eli, what are you doing?  It's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony.\"  Eli revealed, \"There's been a change in plans.\"\npointed that Destiny had ruined his surprise, since they were supposed to be \"BFF's,\" but Destiny pointed out that David had already posted the news on My Face.  Matthew indicated, as he walked up, that the whole point of posting on My Face was so that everyone could see it.
