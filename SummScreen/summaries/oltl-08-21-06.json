While hugging her fianc\u00e9, Blair slips the key to the safety deposit box out of Spencer's jacket pocket. Blair manages to slip away from Spencer and gives the key to John who is desperate to find out the remaining contents of the safety deposit box. \n\n\nLangston visits Starr and brings her the file that she requested which contains articles on amnesia. Starr relates to Langston how Spencer told her that the test results showed that she doesn't have any brain damage and that he is determined to get to the bottom of Starr's \"amnesia.\" Langston is afraid for Starr and cautions her against trying to keep up her charade especially in front of her doctor's but Starr is convinced that this is the only way to get her parents back together and to get Dr. Truman out of their lives. Starr is convinced that it is only a matter of time before her parents remember their love for each other and get married for real.\n\n\nAfter leaving the ball, John and Natalie head straight to the bank to get evidence against Spencer. They get near the deposit boxes under the ruse that they are there to get their own safety deposit box. With one key in hand, Natalie distracts the bank teller while John searches for the second key to open Spencer's safety deposit box. With no one in sight, Natalie turns her key and John turns his key which opens the box displaying the contents inside.\n\n\nMichael and Marcie escort Nora to the ball. R.J. and Lindsay show up and R.J. comments Nora on how nice she looks which sets Lindsay off. She makes a snide comment to Nora and then accuses R.J. of taking Nora's side when he comes to her defense. They argue again about the kiss that Lindsay witnessed. Lindsay wonders how R.J. would feel if she were the one placing kisses on another man's lips. R.J. says he wouldn't handle it by getting drunk and then lashing out at others. She decides to test R.J.'s resolve by planting a big sloppy kiss on Michael's lips. R.J. responds by grabbing Nora and planting a passionate kiss on her lips while a furious Marcie lets Lindsay have it with both barrels for kissing her husband. Nora confesses to Claudia that she is starting to have feelings for someone she shouldn't be having feelings for (and some say Lindsay is just paranoid when it comes to Nora stealing her men).\n\n\nClaudia tries to get Nash to admit that he did feel something for her when they were working together against her father. Nash reminds Claudia that his heart belongs to one woman only, Tess. After Claudia leaves, Nash calls Jessica and finds out that Brennan is running a fever. Even though Jessica tells Nash that Brennan will be fine and that he should stay at the ball, Nash ends up at the loft with items for Brennan. After seeing for himself that Brennan is ok, Nash decides to go back to the ball to continue his search for investors. Jessica is dismayed to learn that Nash is planning on sticking around. She tries to convince him to take Claudia up on her offer to finance Nash's project but Nash tells Jessica the same thing he told Claudia; that he hasn't given up on Tess. Nash reminds Jessica that she is the one who is starting to remember Tess' memories of the time they spent together. Nash heads back to the ball and Jessica talks to Brennan about her confusion regarding her memories of Nash and her love for Antonio.\n\n\nViki and Evangeline try to console Todd who is visibly shaken following Blair and Spencer's engagement. Todd is furious that he let Viki talk him into trying to talk things out with Blair only to be humiliated by what just happened. Always one for public displays himself, an emotional Todd stands on a table and asks everyone to join him in a toast for the good doctor and his slut. He goes on to declare that Spencer is a murderer and framed Todd for the whore he is about to marry.  Evangeline threatens to climb on the table and pull Todd down if he doesn't end his tirade. Todd eventually climbs off the table while David and Paige tell everyone that Spencer is guilty of everything that Todd said about him and more. Evangeline wants to comfort Todd but Cris convinces her that the best thing to do is to leave him alone. Viki approaches Todd and he begs her not to give him a lecture or anymore advice. She promises to do neither but shares with him her observation that when Spencer proposed to Blair, she looked like someone who was backed into a corner, not someone who was in love with the man she just became engaged to. \n\n\nCris has a special surprise waiting for Evangeline when he brings her back to his place.  He asks Evangeline to stay outside for a few moments while he cleans up a bit. While waiting for Cris, Evangeline is anxious to hear from Todd and decides instead to give him a quick call. Her plans are interrupted when Cris comes back outside and leads her inside to show her his surprise.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "lair is at a loss for words. The whole room waits for her answer. \"Yes,\" she says. Spencer tells all that he had to go to his safety deposit box that night to get it. John and Natalie wonder now if that is all that he went to the box for. Later, Blair and Spencer hug and she rummages in his pocket and gets the keys without him noticing. She rushes off and gives them to John and Natalie who sneak out to see what is in the safety deposit box. Todd can't deal with Blair marrying Spencer. Spencer gloats and goes to get his fiancee smiling meanly at Todd. Todd clears off a table and stands on it. 'I want to make a toast! To Spencer who tried to set me up to get killed for murdering a pregnant, so that he could marry that whore over there.\" He holds a knife to his chest but then does nothing with it. John and Natalie head to the bank and Natalie pretends she is going to throw up so the bank employee rushes off for a bucket. They open Spencer's box Langston brings Starr what she has asked for. It is information that she has printed off to continue faking her amnesia. She has to research this in order to fool Spencer into thinking that she is really ill. Lindsay has had a few too many and she is sarcastic to Nora that second that she sees her at the gala. RJ says Nora looks nice and that is enough to set Lindsay off. \"Why don't you just kiss her again?\" To get back at RJ, Lindsay goes to the first man that she sees, (Michael), and she lays a big hot juicy one on him. Marcie freaks out. She thought that Lindsay was her friend. \"I only did it as he was the first man I saw. He is a good kisser though.\" Marcie rushes off to have a shower now that she knows that Lindsay has put her mouth on Michael. RJ gets mad, but the truth is that Lindsay loves seeing passion finally from the man. \"You want to see passion?\" he asks. He goes to Nora and bends her over kissing her hand on the lips. \"Why do you keep doing that?\" Lindsay asks. Nora would like to know that too. Later while talking alone with Claudia, Nora says that she is starting to have feelings for something that she shouldn't and it is all wrong. Claudia says that she knows exactly what that feels like. Todd isn't ready to go and so he sits staring at Spencer and Blair. Spencer wants to continue their celebrating upstairs. He walks ahead of Blair. Blair stalls now, getting up slowly. \"Damn you John,\" she says under her breath. \"I need that damn key!\"",
