Citing the dog's fleas and his peeing on the floor, Tess let her aunt have it. She griped that she was fed up and reminded Tina that she wasn't invited to stay at Llanfair. She also refused to clean up after Tina and her dog and suggested that Tina stay with Sarah if she wanted a free ride. She further insulted the dog by pointing out that he looked more like a rodent than a dog. A shocked Tina reminded Tess that Llanfair was her house, that she wasn't looking for anyone to clean up after her, and that she could remember when her niece loved dogs. When Tess stepped over the line and accused her aunt of waiting around to sleep with Jared, Tina picked up the phone to call Viki. It was certainly not the Jessica she knew and loved, she complained. Tess, on a roll, pointed out that Tina never loved her, as she grabbed the phone from Tina's hand. As she ordered her aunt to quit complaining and stay out of her way, Cris and Sarah arrived to see Tina. Immediately, Cris felt that Tina was to blame. \"What did you do to Jess?\" he demanded to know. \n\n\nAt the airport, Antonio had some special time with his family before getting ready to board a plane for Mendorra. Jamie asked her dad to bring Talia back when he asked her what kind of souvenir she would like. She drew a map for her dad so that he could locate his princess and bring her home. The little girl was looking forward to a future of happily ever after. Carlotta voiced concern and wondered if Antonio had some kind of plan but he thought that she should know as little as possible. While she blamed Tina for all that happened, Antonio placed full responsibility on Carlo, and reminded her that he knew what it was like to have a mobster for a father. He vowed to help Talia as Carlotta helped him. \n\n\nAn eager Jared told Clint that he would do whatever he could to get himself and Natalie back into the good graces of the Buchanans. Clint indicated that Jared was the problem, not Natalie, and he had a job for him. His plan was for Jared to do to Dorian what he did to the Buchanans, enabling them to get their company back. He would have to \"hit her where she lives,\" and that involved Langston. He pointed out that family was the most important thing to Dorian, who always stood by her family members and defended them no matter what. He knew of someone to take Langston away from Dorian and had no doubts that Dorian would do what it took to keep her. \n\n\nAt the country club, as Langston sat with Markko, who was filling in an application for a new job, Cole walked in. He was thumbing through the college directory he received from Nora and noted that he wanted to be as far away as possible from Starr. Markko shared that he didn't want his family to spend money or be in debt with loans. Nora gave the three a pep talk on applying to college and believed that they should all be eager to leave their nests. Langston felt obligated to stay with Dorian because the woman took her in. \n\n\nInside, Blair, Starr, and Marcie sat through an awkward lunch, as they oohed and aahed over Starr's sonogram pictures. Marcie mentioned that she had asked Blair to remain in the baby's life as his or her grandmother, and wanted Starr to be a part of the baby's life, too. Starr replied that she finally understood all of Marcie's previous actions with Sam, even as Blair stepped up to defend Todd's actions. Starr continued that she didn't want the baby to be confused, and only wanted what was best. Therefore, she would not want the baby to even know of her until it was older, and she had even prepared a video for when that day came. She felt that Marcie, as the baby's one mother, would be sufficient. Marcie promised that the baby would learn all about his or her amazing birth mother when the time came. Starr reminded her that Cole should be included in that description. \n\n\nTodd told Starr's doctor that he wanted her to help him to get his grandchild, but she refused to discuss anything, citing confidentiality laws. Todd ordered her not to cross him. When he pointed out that Marcie was a felon, she reminded him that he was, too. She also reminded him that he'd lost his family because he always needed to have his own way. Refusing to be bullied, she picked up the phone to call security. When he mentioned the \"sad and pitiful life\" that she would have if she refused to listen to him and the secret regarding her own son, the doctor was forced to go along. \n\n\nAccording to the file that Clint handed over to Jared, Langston had an uncle living in Columbia, South America. Apparently, both he and Langston were unaware of each other, but it was Clint's plan to change that. He felt that if Dorian were threatened with the man taking away both Langston and her trust fund, she would give her new company back to the Buchanans in order to save what was dearest to her. Jared wondered what would happen if Dorian offered the man more money than Clint, but Clint suggested that he was ready to step in and handle that issue. He suggested that he and Jared had two things in common: Natalie, whom they loved, and Dorian, who brought out quite the opposite feelings for both of them. A sensitive Jared voiced concern for Langston, who had led a tough life. He also thought the job sounded dangerous, since it appeared from the file that the uncle was not exactly a \"white knight.\" Finding his need to get into Clint's good graces again more important than his own safety, Jared agreed to take on the job and all it entailed. \n\n\nNora left the teens momentarily, and Cole started small talk about the summer. This enraged Langston, who was angry that he was avoiding any talk of Starr, and ordered him to stop punishing his ex. A sorrowful Cole asked that Langston not mention him to Starr as he headed to his table inside with Nora. Markko and Langston felt that they should stick close to home when making their college choices. Langston wondered again over Delphina's words of her not being alone. Markko reminded her that she had him, though Langston felt sure that Delphina meant someone else. At the ladies' table inside, talk turned to all of the couples no longer together. Sorrow was expressed over Marcie and Michael, but Blair thought that Michael was right to worry about Todd. Quickly changing the subject, Starr asked her mom to be her coach at birthing classes, and she asked Marcie if she would like to be present during the baby's birth. The overjoyed women accepted immediately. \n\n\nTess responded hastily, referring to her hormones and pregnancy and stepping on the dog's tail. She added that she was going to the doctor shortly and hoped to get some help for herself. After she left the room, it was agreed that Jessica just hadn't been herself. Tina learned that Cord had departed for London without saying goodbye to her. Cris and Sarah explained that they were looking for anything at all to help Antonio in his quest to retrieve Talia from Mendorra. Thinking quickly to the hidden jewels, and just as quickly blocking them from her mind, Tina seized a book from the other room. It was a tell-all on all things Mendorran and went so far as to list schedules for happenings at the palace, such as the changing of the guard and the names of the hired help. Cris and Sarah were sure this would be a great help. Tess headed out, telling Tina to stay the hell out of her way. Once they all left, Tina felt happy that Sarah loved her, and expressed how lucky she was to have no problems for a change, other than Jessica. David Vickers attempted to get into the basement, but the door was locked. Tina realized that she wasn't the only one with secrets. \n\n\nTodd jogged the doctor's memory as he handed her a file, reminding her of her son's theft of drugs from the hospital and how she covered his tracks. Appalled, the doctor retorted that the incident had happened a long time ago and that her son had had treatment. He had become a respected teacher. Todd smugly assured her that he was only protecting his daughter as she protected her son and he only wanted a favor. \n\n\nWhen Starr retreated to the ladies' room, Blair and Marcie spoke of the awkwardness of their meeting. They agreed that Starr was a special person. Blair mentioned that she would have raised Starr's baby if it had been up to her. Nora and Cole walked in on the way to their own table, and Cole spied the sonogram. As Marcie thanked him for allowing her to adopt the baby, she invited him to be a part of the baby's life. He refused her invitation, emphasizing that he could not allow himself to be in and out. He needed to be alone and stalked off, putting a hold on his lunch with Nora. As Cole found himself outside, he came face-to-face with Starr. \n\n\nAntonio was ready to board his plane when Cris and Sarah arrived and announced that they were going with him. He attempted to change their minds, but it was no use; their minds were made up. \n\n\nTodd made his demands known to the doctor who reluctantly had to give in. He asked for updates on all of Starr's procedures and a phone call when she went into labor, none of which seemed too bad. Unfortunately, there was more, and when the doctor refused, Todd picked up the phone to call his newspaper and the police. Again, the doctor had no choice. Calling Todd a bastard, she unenthusiastically shook his hand when it was offered. Outside in the waiting room, a loud and obnoxious Tess was doing some demanding of her own. She wanted to see the doctor right away and didn't care what or who was holding her up. Todd heard the noise and recognized the voice. As he peered out from the doctor's office, he was aghast at what he saw.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr goes to have her ultrasound and later has lunch with Blair and Marcie. The three of them are ready to agree to all be a part of the baby's life. But not everybody is ok with that. Cole somehow seems to know that something is going on behind his back. And Todd threatens the nurse with blackmail, informing her that he knows her son got in trouble and he can send him back to prison if she does not \"cooperate\" with him. Meanwhile, Jared attempts to get into the good graces of Clint. Clint tells Jared they might be able to work together in order to overthrow Dorian. But it might involve some \"dirty business\" involving taking Langston from her. Tina seems to know how to make Sara and Cristian appreciate her when she shows them how she can help Antonio get Talia back. But she senses something is \"not normal\" about Jessica. Tess is really there and she rips into Tina with hostile abusive verbiage that her aunt knows is not who Jessica really is. And Tess also \"displays\" that she is not the real Jessica when she goes to the OB-GYN clinic and causes a scene, when Todd overhears her.",
