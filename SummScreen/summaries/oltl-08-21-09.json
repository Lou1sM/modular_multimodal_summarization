Relating that the previous doctor had left her with a full caseload of patients before he transferred, Marty insisted that she had a few moments to spare with John before her first appointment arrived.   Realizing Marty was nervous about returning to work, John reminded her that she was a fighter and a great psychiatrist.  When Marty mentioned that Mayor Lowell was gunning for her, John made it clear that Mayor Lowell was using Marty in an attempt to hurt John.   Marty feared how the mayor would react if he ever learned that Cole was working undercover.  Assuring Marty that the mayor had no knowledge of Cole's involvement, John promised to remove Cole from the task force if Mayor Lowell became suspicious.\n\n\nMayor Lowell held a press conference, announcing his bid for re-election.  Pleased to see Viki in attendance, the Mayor asked her for an endorsement.  Citing his abuse of the city budget, the increasing crime rate, and his personal vendetta against John, Viki declared that Mayor Lowell would never receive an endorsement from the Banner.  Unable to convince Viki to reconsider, an angered Mayor Lowell stormed off.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair smiled as she daydreamed about her rendezvous with Todd in the cabana.  Dorian interrupted her thoughts and demanded that Blair forget about Todd.  Displaying a check that was written to Rex, Dorian stated that she knew Blair had hired Rex to investigate T\u00e9a.  Admitting that she had hired Rex to discover T\u00e9a's big secret, Blair insisted that T\u00e9a's secret might cause harm to Blair's children.\n\n\nDorian pleaded with Blair to allow T\u00e9a and Todd to move on with their lives, but Blair was determined to learn exactly what T\u00e9a was hiding.   Informing Dorian that Rex was hot on Ross Rayburn's trail, Blair was certain that she could convince Ross to confirm her suspicions regarding T\u00e9a.  With a devilish smile, Blair declared, \"I know T\u00e9a has a terrible secret and I'm going to find out what it is if it's the last thing I do!\"  A frustrated Dorian asked Blair to join her at Mayor Lowell's press conference.  Dorian admitted that she wanted to support the mayor, in hopes that he would vote for her to resume the office of chief-of-staff at the hospital.\n\n\n As the press conference began, May or Lowell assured the citizens of Llanview that he would continue to be tough on crime.  Noticing John in the audience, the mayor criticized the police department and vowed to rid Llanview of self-serving police officers.   During the press conference, Officer Fish and his partner, Keaton stood guard.   Informing Fish that he was a member of John's new task force, Officer Keaton attempted to question Fish about any new developments.  Refusing to divulge any information, Fish suggested that Officer Keaton speak with John.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the press conference, Viki was disgusted when Dorian stated that she planned to support the mayor in the upcoming election.  Convinced that Dorian had an ulterior motive for offering the mayor her support, Viki questioned how Dorian could ever endorse such a terrible politician.  As Viki continued to criticize Mayor Lowell, several members of the press stood nearby and listened to the conversation.  Referring to Viki as self-righteous, a sarcastic Dorian suggested that Viki run for mayor.\n\n\nA few feet away, Fish informed John that Officer Keaton had inquired about the task force.  John was pleased when Fish related that he didn't offer Keaton any information.  Meanwhile, across the room, Officer Keaton approached Mayor Lowell.  As the two men shook hands, May or Lowell asked the officer if he had managed to infiltrate John's newly formed task force.  When Officer Keaton claimed that he was making progress, the mayor demanded immediate results from the officer.   As the two men parted ways, John and Mayor Lowell stared across the room at each other.\n\n\nAt Angel Square Park, Schuyler observed Gigi and Rex.   As they walked along hand in hand, Rex reminded Gigi of their wonderful night together.   Watching Rex and Gigi share a special moment, Schuyler appeared distraught.  Schuyler listened as Rex and Gigi promised to face the difficult times together.\n\n\nWhile enjoying lunch at Rodi's, Stacy received a call from Kim, who related that she was waiting for Schuyler to return to the drug rehabilitation center.   Frantic, Stacy pleaded with Kim to convince Schuyler to forgive Stacy.  Stating that in order to pass another child off as Rex's, Stacy reminded her friend that Stacy needed to get pregnant immediately.  Kim was confident that she could convince Schuyler to give Stacy another chance.\n\n\nUpon discovering Stacy at Rodi's, Rex and Gigi's happiness turned to frustration.  Reminding Rex that she had no income, Stacy announced that she had placed her meal on his tab.   As Stacy complained about the past due utility bills and lack of groceries at Rex's loft, Gigi became annoyed and wondered if Stacy planned to make an attempt to support herself.  Hoping to prevent an altercation between the sisters, Rex promised to provide Stacy with the necessities while she resided at his loft.   Gigi wasn't pleased by Rex's decision to accommodate Stacy.\n\n\nStacy grew nervous as Gigi questioned her about the pregnancy.  Upon realizing that Stacy hadn't obtained a gynecologist, Rex and Gigi advised her to make an appointment immediately.  As Stacy hesitated about placing the call, Rex received a business call.  Stepping away, Rex urged his business contact to locate Ross Rayburn.  When Rex returned, Stacy promised to phone the doctor later and provide Rex with the details.  Alone with Rex, Gigi expressed her concern that Stacy was using the baby to trap him.   Rex assured Gigi that Stacy wouldn't get between them again.\n\n\nSchuyler was shocked when he discovered Kim waiting for him at the drug rehabilitation center.  Kim told Schuyler that Stacy had phoned her upon learning that she was pregnant.  When Kim mentioned that Stacy was throwing her life away, Schuyler enlightened Kim about Stacy's terrible misdeeds.  Referring to Stacy as a psychopath, Schuyler claimed that he didn't want anything more to do with her.  As Schuyler continued to condemn Stacy's behavior, Kim smiled and told Schuyler that he was in love with Stacy.  After recalling the past relationship that Schuyler and Stacy had once shared, Kim managed to convince him to phone Stacy and check on her.\n\n\nKim phoned Stacy and related that Schuyler would be in contact with her.  Later, Stacy met Kim back at the loft.  Relating that Rex wanted to attend Stacy's first doctor's appointment, Stacy made it clear that she needed to get pregnant that day.  Stacy was thrilled when Schuyler phoned and asked to meet with her.  Stacy told Kim that she planned to reel Schuyler in.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a was surprised to find Todd waiting for her.  Todd advised her that they needed to discuss something, and T\u00e9a was alarmed when she spotted Elijah in the living room.  An infuriated T\u00e9a demanded to know what Elijah had told Todd.   Unaware of the tension that existed between T\u00e9a and Elijah, Todd informed T\u00e9a that, despite her warning, he had hired Elijah to represent him in his custody case against Blair.  Explaining that he needed Elijah's help in order to get the court ruling overturned, Todd pleaded with T\u00e9a to forgive him for going against her wishes.  As Todd and T\u00e9a argued, Elijah gave T\u00e9a a devilish smile and exclaimed, \"I'm sure you've gone behind Mr. Manning's back before.  We all have our secrets, don't we?\"  Explaining that the court had required him to meet with a psychiatrist, Todd rushed off to make his appointment.\n\n\nAlone with Elijah, T\u00e9a demanded to know if Elijah was going to reveal her secret to Todd.  When Elijah admitted that he was working for someone, T\u00e9a determined that his employer was Ross Rayburn.  Acknowledging that T\u00e9a's assumption was correct, Elijah stated, \"You know what my client wants!\"  An infuriated T\u00e9a announced, \"I got a message for your client.  Tell him I will not break, no matter what you do to me!\"  Elijah questioned if T\u00e9a wanted to challenge Ross Rayburn.  Elijah advised T\u00e9a that her life with Todd would be over if Elijah told Todd about her missing years.  Elijah assured T\u00e9a that her secret would be kept if she gave Ross what he wanted.  T\u00e9a appeared conflicted.\n\n\nLater, Rex and Blair met at Rodi's.  Rex informed Blair that he had located Ross Rayburn.\n\n\nAs Todd rushed into his psychiatrist office, both he and Marty were stunned to encounter one another.  Upon realizing that the court had failed to notify Todd that his case had been reassigned to her, Marty offered to find another doctor for Todd.  Stating that he had a court hearing scheduled that day, Todd suggested that Marty act as his psychiatrist.  To Marty's surprise, Todd instructed her to sign the court order, acknowledging that she had counseled him.  Amazed by Todd's behavior, Marty refused to lie about counseling him.  Shaking her head in disgust, Marty instructed Todd to take a seat.  Marty exclaimed, \"Maybe the only way to get you out of my head, is for me to get into yours!\"\n\n \n\n\n",
