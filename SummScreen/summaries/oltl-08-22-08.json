Meanwhile, inside the mansion, Clint urged Jared to help him regain control of Buchanan Enterprises. Insisting that he wanted Natalie and Clint to repair their shattered relationship, Jared agreed to help Clint battle Dorian. A confused Bo interrupted the conversation and received a pleasant welcome from Clint. With a look of shock on his face, Bo stared at Clint and Jared. Bo remembered having a strange dream that included them both. \n\n\nBo wondered if Clint had decided to forgive Jared, but Clint was adamant that he had not. Jared excused himself. Before Bo could question Clint further, Nigel interrupted and welcomed Bo back home. Nigel revealed that he had found a case containing letters that Bo had written to Asa while serving in Vietnam. Stunned, Bo accepted the case. As Bo opened the case, Matthew interrupted and welcomed his father home. Bo expressed his love for Matthew and promised his son that he would be a better father. Matthew briefed his father on events that had taken place during his absence. Bo was shocked to learn that Lindsay was serving time in prison for Spencer's murder. \n\n\nLater, Clint entered the room as Bo read the old letters. An amazed Bo revealed to Clint that exactly forty years ago, he had left to serve in Vietnam. As the brothers recounted that fateful day, the discussion turned to Asa. Bo admitted that he went to the ranch because he had wanted to prove to himself that he was tough-just like Asa. Bo told Clint that although he loved Asa, he realized that he didn't want to be like him. Clint stated that perhaps a son was destined to be like his father. Puzzled by Clint's remark, Bo inquired about Jared's presence at the mansion earlier. Bo asked if Clint had made a deal with Jared. Avoiding Bo's questioning, Clint changed the subject and informed Bo that John had been appointed police commissioner. Bo was certain that his friend could use his position as commissioner to help locate Rex and Gigi. Recalling that Rex left town to search for Bo, Clint asked his brother what had taken place in Texas. Bo had no answer. \n\n\nBack in 1968, Rex and Gigi expressed their love for one another and pondered their future. Exhausted from the ordeal, Gigi didn't want to discuss the situation, but Rex reminded her that unless something drastic happened, he was headed to Vietnam in a few hours. Rex and Gigi pleaded with Professor Fina to devise a plan to launch them back into the future, but Fina sadly informed the couple that the portal was closed and they were stuck in the year 1968. Horrified that she would never see Shane again, Gigi told Rex that he was all she had left and begged him to run off to Canada with her. With regret, Rex told Gigi that he couldn't alter the future and had to go to Vietnam-otherwise Bo would never meet Nora and Matthew would never be born. In tears, a devastated Gigi broke down in Rex's arms. \n\n\nClint, Chuck Sr., and Chuck Jr., awoke from a night of heavy drinking. Announcing that he wanted to spend some time with his brother before he was shipped off to Vietnam, Clint headed off to find Rex. As Rex comforted Gigi, Clint entered the room and interrupted the couple. An angered Rex demanded to have some time alone with Gigi, but Clint stated that he was looking for Asa. Unable to find Asa, Clint complained that his father had ruined his life and didn't have the decency to see Bo off to the service. Chuck Sr. advised Chuck Jr. and Rex that the time had come for them to prepare for their trip. A terrified Gigi watched as Rex walked away. \n\n\nWhile the family waited to say their goodbyes to Rex, Olympia consoled Gigi. Moments later, Rex surfaced dressed in his military uniform. As Olympia expressed her displeasure over Asa being absent, Asa (with an unfamiliar face) appeared and proudly announced that the time had come for Bo to serve his country. Upset over Asa's treatment of Maria, Clint informed Asa that he would lose both his sons because Clint was leaving town. \n\n\nRealizing that Bo was no longer Asa, Rex believed that Bo might have returned to the year 2008. Gigi prayed that there was hope for them as well. Before Rex could respond, Asa informed Rex that it was time to head to the bus station. Asa joked that the army would consider Rex AWOL if he arrived late. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, Brody left a message on Gigi's cell phone. Stating that Shane was worried sick about her, Brody begged Gigi to return his call. Layla joined Brody at the bar and appeared to be in a somber mood. Brody wondered how she was handling her breakup with Vincent. After admitting that she was having a difficult time, Layla told Brody that Adriana had inquired about a package that she had sent Gigi. Brody had a quick flashback of opening the package that contained Rex's toothbrush and immediately denied having any knowledge of the delivery. When Brody mentioned that Gigi hadn't returned from her trip, Layla realized that Gigi was still searching for Rex. Layla was certain that Rex and Gigi's disappearance was bad news for both Brody and Adriana. \n\n\nAlarmed when Madame Delphina approached him at Rodi's and returned his check, Brody demanded to know what had happened to Gigi. As Layla listened, the psychic informed Brody that she had lost contact with Gigi. Believing that Gigi was dead, Brody wanted answers. Madame told him that although Gigi had reunited with Rex and was very much alive, she couldn't come back. A panicked Brody reminded Layla that he wasn't Shane's birth father and feared the child might end up in foster care. Before leaving, Layla assured Brody that Gigi would return home with an explanation. Retrieving Rex's toothbrush from behind the bar, Brody studied the object. \n\n\nAt a nearby table, John asked a judge to grant him a search warrant for Todd Manning's home. John explained that Keys had given him an oral statement connecting Todd to Ramsey's murder. John stated that the mystery woman, who was staying in Ramsey's home the night of his murder, was residing in Todd's home. The judge reminded John that Keys was a criminal and that John didn't have probable cause to search Todd's home. Fearing that Todd might attack him in the press, the judge refused John a search warrant. After much convincing, the judge granted John's request but warned him-if his search uncover nothing, he would drop his investigation concerning Todd. \n\n\nUnnoticed, Todd observed an irate Tess perform inside Dr. Joplin's waiting room. As Tess berated the nurse, Todd watched with amusement. Upon noticing Todd, Tess appeared nervous, but quickly apologized to the nurse, citing her recent troubles as the cause of her emotional outburst. Avoiding eye contact with Todd, Tess explained that she hadn't been herself lately. A suspicious Todd agreed that his niece appeared disturbed. Tess became defensive when Todd continued to comment on her bizarre behavior. When Tess lashed out and made negative remarks concerning him, Todd's suspicions were confirmed-Jess was actually Tess. \n\n\nTodd was amused and played along with Tess's charade. While continuing to browbeat Todd, Tess ranted about her hatred for Natalie and Jared, and the fact that Tina was residing at Llanfair. Shocked to learn Tina was in town, Todd had questions for Tess. Believing that Todd could take Tina off her hands, Tess urged Todd to allow his sister to live with him. When Todd refused, Tess verbally attacked Todd and questioned why he was in Dr. Joplin's examination room. Tess suggested that Todd was planning a dastardly deed involving Starr's unborn child. In a threatening tone, Todd warned Tess to back off or he would cause her grief. Fearing Todd might be onto her scheme, a panicked Tess ran after him. \n\n\nTodd returned home and was annoyed when Tess forced her way inside. Todd advised her to leave, but Tess attempted to head upstairs. Upon observing Todd's nervous demeanor, Tess demanded to know what Todd was hiding. Fed up with his niece's antics, Todd revealed that he knew she was Tess. When Todd attempted to call Viki, Tess struggled with him over control of the phone. During the altercation, the doorbell rang. Tess wondered who had decided to pay Todd a visit. \n\n\nAt Angel Square Park, Cole ran into Starr. When Cole showed interest in her emotional state and revealed that he still cared for her, Starr appeared hopeful. However, reality set in when Cole reminded Starr that he could never forgive her for giving away their child. A group of Llanview High students interrupted Starr and Cole's conversation and made negative remarks concerning Starr's pregnancy. Defending her actions, an angered Starr lashed out at the teens and they quickly dispersed. Noticing that Cole was bothered by what had transpired, Starr asked him if he wanted to join the teens and stated that she had an appointment with Blair and Marcie. In disgust, Cole stormed off.\n\n\n",

But he believes that playing Asa really motivated him to smarten up and not follow in his father's footsteps. Tess runs into Todd at the clinic. She knows that he has secrets that could get him in trouble. He knows that she is Tess and only playing Jessica.",
