Dani admitted that it had been tough seeing the look in Victor's eyes as the true story had been revealed. The girls discussed his poor life and how he stood to lose everything. Dani noted that she would always love Victor, and she would always be in his life. Starr agreed, but she felt that she probably should have noticed that he wasn't the real Todd on her own.\n\n\nStarr thought that maybe she had really noticed, because there were times that Victor hadn't seemed like her father. She pointed out the time when Victor had hurt Cole and pushed Starr down the steps. It hadn't made sense. Then there was the time when Victor had been involved with Marty Saybrooke. Dani wondered why Starr hadn't mentioned anything before. Starr admitted that she'd thought it was just herself that thought that way.\n\n\nDani was confused. If Starr had had doubts about the man they'd known as Todd, Dani couldn't understand why Starr had tried to convince Dani to love him. She wondered why Starr was changing her mind. Starr insisted that she wasn't trying to hide anything. They agreed that Victor had done some bad things, but Dani angrily pointed out that it hadn't been Victor who had ganged up on Marty and raped her.\n\n\nDani had looked Todd up online, and he'd been involved in rape, murder, and prison. She'd been sickened to read that, and she'd pushed her father away to make him suffer. It turned out that he hadn't deserved that treatment, because he was Victor. \"Your precious Todd did that,\" Dani said accusingly. Starr insisted that it was Todd Manning who couldn't forgive Todd Manning, but Victor wasn't a saint either. Todd had been locked up for eight years.\n\n\nThe girls began to argue. Starr found herself defending Todd, while Dani was in Victor's corner. Starr thought that Victor wasn't so great, and he was sick. Dani reminded Starr that Victor had been programmed. Starr accused Dani of standing up for Victor, and the arguing grew louder. Suddenly, the girls stopped. They didn't understand why they were quarreling.\n\n\nDani thought it was all confusing, and they had a lot to think about. Both of the girls apologized to the other. They realized that they were lucky to have each other. Starr suggested that they never fight again, as they hugged. Dani laughed. \"Yeah, like that'll ever happen,\" she said. Dani pointed out that their dads probably felt just as bad, and Starr agreed that the men were \"freaking out.\" She knew that neither one of the men liked to be cornered.\n\n\nDani thought it was strange that another man was actually her dad, and she didn't know anything about him. She only knew what she'd read online. Starr agreed to tell her all about Todd.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Jack caught Todd as he stuck his hand into the wall safe and took Dorian's gun. Jack demanded to know what Todd was doing and threatened to call the cops. He called Todd a fake and a crook, and he added that he didn't want to hear Todd talk about how he was really Jack's father. Jack didn't care what had been said, because Todd was a stranger to him. Jack didn't know Todd, and he had no desire to get to know him.\n\n\nTodd explained that he understood how Jack felt, though Jack angrily advised Todd that Todd didn't know him either. Todd agreed that Jack had been young the last time he'd seen him, but he remembered his son. There had been clear moments every once in a while during his imprisonment, Todd added. Jack reminded his father that Todd had tried to give him away. Reluctantly, Todd admitted that he hadn't known the truth about Jack.\n\n\nJack wanted Todd to stop trying to get to know him, because Todd couldn't fool him. Todd advised Jack that he wasn't trying to stop Jack's relationship with Victor. Jack shouted that his father would do anything to help him, and Todd had no idea how far his father had gone for him.\n\n\nJack explained that he'd been arrested when Gigi had died, and his father had protected him. He called the man claiming to be his father \"Scarface,\" and Todd took exception. He ordered Jack never to say that again. He added that if Victor had raised Jack correctly, the boy wouldn't be such an obnoxious brat.\n\n\nTodd quickly apologized for what he had said and suggested they start over. Jack ordered him to get out of the house, or Jack would call the cops. Todd acceded and made his way outside. \"Way to go, Manning. Call the kid names. Great stuff,\" he muttered to himself. He realized that Jack couldn't help that he was an \"obnoxious little brat,\" and he blamed Victor for that. He removed the gun from his pocket.\n\n\nInside the house, Jack noticed that the coast was clear, and he walked over to look inside the safe.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Victor were alone at the Manning residence. T\u00e9a pointed out that the kids had all agreed to stick by Victor. He asked about T\u00e9a's feelings, but he was certain that she still loved Todd. Victor grumbled that he was a mere idiot whose soul had been sold without his permission. He felt that he'd lost everything to Todd. \"Everything I have is his, including you. The woman I love,\" Victor said, teary-eyed. He told T\u00e9a that she could leave.\n\n\nT\u00e9a reminded him that she'd vowed to love him, though Victor advised her that he wouldn't hold her to it. He informed her that she was free to go, especially because he knew how much she hated being lied to. T\u00e9a asked for her chance to talk, and Todd chuckled. He'd forgotten that she needed her closing argument. Suddenly, he lost his temper and began to yell about the unfairness of his life. He was ready to hear what T\u00e9a had to say.\n\n\nTearfully, T\u00e9a lost her own temper. She reminded Victor of what they'd been through, especially with her illness. He'd stood by her, and it had all been real. She agreed that he wasn't the man she'd thought she'd married, but they had both good times and bad times that they'd shared. Victor laughed. He wondered if it was T\u00e9a's way of saying, \"Look on the bright side.\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a insisted that she wasn't just trying to make him feel better. Victor wanted an answer, because he loved T\u00e9a. He wanted to know how T\u00e9a felt. T\u00e9a explained that things had changed, but some of the important things had remained the same. She'd married Victor, and she saw her husband, partner, and soul mate when she looked at him. \"I still love you, Victor,\" T\u00e9a said. \"Victory!\" she added. He had a good, strong name, she told him.\n\n\nVictor couldn't believe that he'd heard correctly: T\u00e9a loved him. She assured him that he'd never lose her. Victor was astonished. He declared that he had memories, and he realized that he wasn't even aware of who some of them belonged to. \"I'm real,\" T\u00e9a reassured him. She kissed him gently.\n\n\nT\u00e9a suggested that they go upstairs. They didn't hear Todd approaching the house or looking through the window as they climbed the stairs. The front door was locked, but Todd found an unlocked door around the back. He entered the house.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Victor made love, and they didn't see Todd as he opened the bedroom door. Todd pointed the gun at the couple. Victor noted how strange it was that the only thing he knew was Todd. T\u00e9a responded that he couldn't be Todd any longer, and it was okay to be scared. She revealed that she was scared, too, and they had lots of work ahead of them. Victor admitted that he was starting at zero.\n\n\nT\u00e9a added that they had each other, and as long as they stayed strong and healthy, they'd survive. They'd survived worse, she stated. Todd gently closed the door and pulled the gun apart.\n\n\nJessica yelled at Ford and ordered him to leave Llanfair, after he accused her of still being in love with Brody. He pulled her into a kiss, and Jessica pulled away and slugged him in the jaw. Feeling sorry for hitting him so hard, Jessica retrieved a bag of frozen peas and handed it to Ford. He apologized, and he admitted that she'd reminded him of Tess when she'd started to yell at him.\n\n\nJessica reminded him that only a small piece of Tess had survived. Ford agreed that he would no longer talk about Tess as though she were a real person. He thanked her for treating him so well during their shared custody of Ryder, and he asked that they forget the moment. Jessica wasn't sure that she could. Jessica insisted that Ford would have to get over Tess, or they wouldn't be able to have a relationship of any kind.\n\n\nFord wondered if he should just get over Tess and then phone Jessica. She agreed that would be good, because she had to get over Brody at the same time. Ford begged her not to take his son away from him, but Jessica was adamant that things would have to change. Ford emphasized that Ryder needed him. Jessica assured Ford that he could see his son, but they couldn't see each other.\n\n\nJessica was able to tell that Ford was thinking about Tess often when they were together, and she couldn't stand it. She didn't think it was healthy for her. Ford understood, and he admitted that he would miss her, even if she were only Jessica. He'd had some good times with Jessica too.\n\n\nJessica revealed that she'd enjoyed Ford's company also. She took it a step further and informed him that he was just about the only person she could talk to. Ford wondered if she were positive that she wanted to end their friendship, and Jessica assured him that she was. It was too intense when thoughts of Tess entered the mix. Ford was unsure of how they'd handle the custody of their son. Jessica planned to work out the details, and she wanted to shake on the deal. Ford grasped her hand.\n\n\nAt the Spotted Pony in Kentucky, Rex was aghast when he heard the announcement that the next stripper on deck was named Gigi. \"Oh, my God,\" Rex declared when he saw the woman prancing and dancing around the bar. It was Kimberly Andrews, and she was equally shocked to see Rex when she leaned down to grab his offered currency.\n\n\nRex demanded to know why Kimberly was using Gigi's name, and she explained that it had been the name that her best friend Stacy had used. It was a tribute to her deceased friend. Rex urged her to find another name to use, and sarcastically, Kimberly wondered if Gigi wanted to use it. Rex revealed that Gigi was dead, and Jack would pay.\n\n\nKimberly was sad to hear about Gigi, but Rex told her not to overdo her sympathy. He reminded her that she'd never cared for Gigi. Kimberly felt that she understood after the death of her best friend Stacy, but Rex advised her that it wasn't the same. Rex informed her that Gigi had been Clint's organ donor after a major heart attack. \"My Clint,\" Kimberly exclaimed. Rex assured her that Clint was doing well.\n\n\nKimberly insisted that her marriage hadn't been a joke, and she'd really cared about Clint. David Vickers had made her leave town. Rex revealed that the Buchanan money no longer existed for Clint, because someone else had it. Kimberly wondered who it could be. \"Me,\" Rex declared. He thought it had been a small price for Clint to pay for Gigi's heart. He also revealed that he was Clint's son.\n\n\nKimberly was shocked, but joked that she could have been Rex's stepmother. Rex confessed that he didn't understand why he was at the club, but he'd contacted a psychic due to his sightings of Gigi. She had appeared very real to him, and she appeared to want to tell him something. He wondered if Kimberly might have any ideas.\n\n\nKimberly told him she had none. Rex stated that David had been familiar with the club, and perhaps the entire episode was just related to Kimberly using Gigi's name. The psychic had probably thought that Gigi was there. Awkwardly, Kimberly agreed that was probably it.\n\n\nThe manager was annoyed that Kimberly had to be replaced with another dancer, and she apologized. She explained that she'd been saying goodbye to an old friend. She asked Rex not to mention that he'd seen her. She asked about Clint, and Rex filled her in quickly on Clint's latest antics. He informed her of Clint's prison sentence that had him living in the \"lap of luxury.\" Rex added that a highlight of Clint's crimes had been his playing around with his children's paternity tests.\n\n\nKimberly was certain that a reason for Clint's crimes had been because he'd missed her an awful lot. Unenthusiastically, Rex agreed that it had played a small part. Kimberly was sorry to hear about Gigi. \"Yeah, aren't we all,\" Rex replied.\n\n\nOn his way out of the club, Rex asked a woman about validating his parking ticket. Suddenly, he was certain he saw Gigi. \"Don't give up,\" Gigi said to him. Just as quickly, her face was replaced by one of the club's employees. She told him the cost of the ticket.\n\n\nKimberly stopped to visit an unseen female in a hospital bed. \"Oh, my God, girl, you'll never believe who walked into the club tonight.\" She grabbed the female's hand.\n\n\n",
