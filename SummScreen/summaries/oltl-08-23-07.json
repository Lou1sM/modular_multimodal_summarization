They both agree that he's a nice guy. Cole decides to go to Starr's house. After he leaves, Marty witnesses a cop having a difficult time with an unruly prisoner and it causes her to have a flashback. She asks to see John right away and the cop on duty agrees to give him a call. \n\n\nWhen Blair finds a pair of boxers, Starr owns up to playing strip poker with her friends during Monte Carlo night. Blair is none too happy at first but accepts Starr's explanation that Cole jumped into the water and no one saw anything. She tells her mom that it was the first fun for Cole in a long time. They get to talking about Blair's relationship with Todd and she tries to explain that though she loves him and they make a good team, she cannot live with him. Starr has difficulty in understanding her mom's reasoning. Cole arrives and Blair expresses her concern about his mother, even though they've had differences. Cole tells them the jury has been selected. As she's about to head upstairs Blair receives a call from Todd. He asks her to attend the Woman of the Year banquet with him, even though its already begun. Starr is worried about Todd seeing Cole but Blair reassures her. Cole is surprised to find his boxers and admits that he's been falling asleep fully dressed at night and quickly changing clothes in the morning. He hasn't been sleeping well and he didn't even realize that he wasn't wearing them. The kids are just happy that Blair was the one to find them. \n\n\nAt Rodi's, John summons the police officer who lost his job the night Spencer was killed. He's reluctant to talk to John until the detective offers to put in a good word for him. He is not much help as he looks at the picture John has and tells him he did not see that person on the night of the murder. John receives a phone call from the cop at the jail  who explains that he knows it's unusual but Marty is frantic to see him. He heads over right away. \n\n\nJared shows up at Roxy's for her secret game. Nash realizes he heard the password in the steam room. Roxy tries to deny him by explaining that he has to be recommended but when the young man pulls a wad of bills from his pocket, he's in. Roxy's other friends arrive and the game begins. Nash is on a roll and the other friends end up leaving. Jared asks lots of questions and makes comments about Jess (whose picture is on the table by Nash). When Nash calls him on it, Jared claims to just be making friendly conversation. It all boils down to the final hand and both men toss in all of their chips. Jared adds a piece of jewelry to the pot as well. They're both in it until the bitter end and both want to win badly.\n\n\nJohn reaches Marty and hears her announce that she knows she didn't kill Spencer. She remembers being slammed against the wall, dropping the scissors and being dragged out of the room where she passed out. She's still a little worried that she may have woken up and gone back but John quickly informs her that he knows who committed the murder. She has another brief flashback and remembers getting up, dizzy, and heading back to Blair's room. The door opened and someone came out. \n\n\nIt's time for the Woman of the Year banquet and Lindsay is thrilled that Bo is there to support her. Rex and Michael are anxious about John's plans and agree that they're safe as long as he's quiet. They cover up and make light hearted talk in front of Marcie, but she is suspicious of their serious faces when she sees them together. Bo explains the recent history of the awards dinner to Rex and how it always ends up in disaster. Nora is presenting and anything can happen, he adds. Dorian pulls Nora aside and warns her that she had better give a decent speech. Nora replies that she will hardly make a fool out of herself as Lindsay once did. Marcie opens the presentation and talks about Lindsay being her family. She introduces Nora who decides not to use her prepared speech, much to everyone's apprehension. She talks about their shared holidays in the past, as well as getting down and dirty and having Lindsay by her side when she won (all of the double meaning references are accompanied by wonderful flashbacks). As everyone listens, worried, Nora states that though they have many differences, Lindsay deserves the award. They both love their children, which is something that they have in common. Lindsay gave to many others when she lost her child instead of retreating, Nora continues. A teary Lindsay listens to Nora's spur of the moment, right from the heart speech. As Nora announces Lindsay's name, Marty recalls that it was Lindsay coming out of Blair's room! \n\n\n",
