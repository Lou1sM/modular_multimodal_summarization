Langston and James entered and Dorian pulled both of her girls aside to tell them to \"come to [her] cabana\" soon. As Cole and James went to get drinks, Starr reminded Langston that Ford wasn't there to see Langston with James. Langston told her friend that she was taking advantage of Starr's disinterest. Starr told her to have fun, since James was a decent guy.\n\n\nAt the table of refreshments, Cole grabbed James's arm and informed him that Starr would never leave him for James. James related that Starr had said she'd be with Cole forever, but likened it to a prison sentence. Cole demanded that James stay away from his girlfriend and compared James to Ford. As they argued and began to push each other, Shaun pulled them apart and changed the subject. The girls wondered what was going on, but Cole claimed that he and James couldn't agree on what drinks to get.\n\n\nStarr pulled Cole aside, and he assured her that nothing was going on. Shaun watched as Cole and James shook hands. They agreed on a truce, and that they didn't want to fight. Cole reminded James to stay away from Starr. James countered that he would just sit back and watch Cole ruin the relationship all by himself.\n\n\nDani talked to Shaun about finding T\u00e9a. Shaun refused to help, and Destiny walked away, disgusted with her brother. Shaun told Dani that he wasn't a detective. Dani wondered how he could let T\u00e9a die alone. Shaun wished things were different. Dani did, too, but knew they would never be, and walked away.\n\n\nIn a cabana at the country club, Blair admired her dress. Eli entered and told Blair that they weren't going to get married. Eli explained that he thought a bride shouldn't have to share her special day with another. He still wanted to get married that day, just somewhere else. He wanted to elope. Blair wondered if it was because of John and Kelly, but Eli informed his fianc\u00e9e that John had apologized for everything and arrested Kelly for breaking and entering in Eli's hotel room. Blair said that they could make plans as soon as Todd returned to town because she had promised him that she would watch over Dani.\n\n\nHowever, a persistent Eli convinced Blair to leave \"right now.\" Eli left and, as Blair began to pack, Dorian entered. Blair caught Dorian up on what was going on with her and Eli. Langston, Starr, and Dani entered and wondered why Blair wasn't dressed. She brought them up to speed, and they protested. Blair promised that they would have a huge party when she returned.  She told Dani to call if she needed her and said that all the women in the room could always count on one another.\n\n\nThe women all grabbed drinks from the table and toasted to Blair and Eli, David and Dorian, and the Cramer women. They shared a group hug, and the younger girls left the women to get ready. Blair made Dorian promise to take lots of pictures. The women were excited that, the next time they saw each other, they would both be married.\n\n\nStarr explained the wedding situation to Cole and said that they should enjoy the day. They agreed that there would be no talk of Hannah or James and kissed. James caught a glimpse of the kiss, but Langston assured him that Starr and Cole were going to be a solid couple for a long time. James said he was just thinking about his beautiful date and said that they should just enjoy the day too.\n\n\nDetective Price, who was following Eli, was on the phone with John. He informed his boss that Eli was with Blair. He got off the phone and bumped into Darren, his younger brother. Darren asked question after question, which prompted his brother to tell him to stop watching so many cop shows. He warned Darren that there would be trouble if his cover were blown. Darren left, and Eli exited the cabana, followed by Price.\n\n\nDavid was getting ready for his wedding in one of the cabanas when there was a knock on the door. It was a country club employee checking on him. David promptly ordered champagne, caviar, a full-length mirror, and embroidered napkins. As the employee walked away, Viki entered, assuring David that Dorian had invited her. She informed a surprised David that Dorian had thanked Charlie and Viki for helping her and David. Viki wondered if David would forgive her as well.\n\n\nDavid forgave her, but knew there was some truth in Viki's scheme to get him into bed. Ignoring him, Viki reminded David that he had devastated Dorian at their last wedding by deserting her. David promised he was in it \"for the long haul.\" A proud Viki hugged her friend as Dorian entered. Viki gave the couple her best wishes and left. David thought it was bad luck to see the bride before the wedding, but Dorian confessed that she was checking to see that David was still there. David kissed her and assured her that someone would have to kill him to keep him away.\n\n\nJohn wanted Eli locked up but needed Ford's statement and Kelly's help. Kelly was worried about ruining Blair's wedding, but John thought that Blair would thank her later. Kelly agreed to help. As John pushed Kelly into the same interrogation room as Ford, she screamed for a lawyer. John slammed the door, and Kelly told a curious Ford that she was waiting to be processed for breaking and entering. Ford observed that Kelly liked to \"stick her nose\" where it didn't belong.\n\n\nKelly informed him that Jess had asked for Kelly's help, and that he should understand wanting to protect someone he cared about. Ford told Kelly that he was in for obstruction of justice, which was \"bogus,\" just like her charges. Kelly nonchalantly maintained her guilt, but justified it by explaining to Ford all of the crimes Eli had committed. Kelly told Ford that he was the only one who could help put Eli behind bars. Kelly asked Ford if he was tired of people treating him like a \"bad smell,\" which he was. Kelly reasoned that if he gave a signed statement, he could be a respected hero.\n\n\nJohn knocked on the judge's door and entered. He gave the judge case files and made a case for the judge to sign an arrest warrant for Eli. The judge thought that the case was too personal for John to be on. Changing the subject, John informed the judge of Eli's wedding. John was convinced that something bad would happen to Blair if she married Eli.\n\n\nThe judge couldn't give an arrest warrant without probable cause, and asked for a signed statement. John said he was working on it. John decided that he would make up charges just so he could pick up Eli. The judge reminded John that it would mean he would go to jail. Kelly entered with a court clerk, carrying Ford's signed statement.\n\n\nKelly returned to Ford and informed him that he'd done the right thing, and that Eli was being arrested as they spoke.\n\n\nDarren complimented Destiny on her dress, but quickly realized something was wrong. Destiny explained to Darren how disappointed she was with Shaun. Darren offered to help find Dani's mother. Darren left a confused Destiny and found his brother. Darren asked for his brother's help. Detective Price said he wasn't a detective, but John McBain's right-hand man. As Price explained to his brother that he was following someone, Eli listened in. Darren and Destiny reunited, and Eli \"stumbled\" upon them, telling them to have fun at the wedding.\n\n\nEli went into the cabana, and Price reappeared, telling Darren and Destiny to leave and not return until they heard from him. On her way out, Destiny found Dani and apologized for her brother's behavior. She knew that Shaun was hiding something. Back in front of the cabana, Price told someone on the phone that he thought Eli had overheard some information. He said that he was in front of the only door of the cabana and wasn't going anywhere.\n\n\nEli greeted David and said that he and Blair were eloping and giving David and Dorian their own day. As David looked into the mirror and babbled about having to look good, Eli pulled a gun out of his briefcase.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the country club and told Detective Price that backup was on the way. John knocked at the locked cabana door and yelled that he had an arrest warrant for Elijah Clarke.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "David is getting ready for his wedding and boasting. Dorian is doing the same. John and Detective Price are ready to find Eli and arrest him before it's too late. John knows that Robert Ford is their key witness who can testify against Eli. Yet, he knows that Eli has gotten to Robert and caused him to chicken out. So he takes Kelly down to the station and locks her in the room with Ford where she persuades him to do the right thing and help the cops nail Eli by writing a sworn statement. Yet, Eli is very clever. He overhears Destiny and Daren talking to Dani about how if Destiny's brother Shaun won't find her mom for her, then maybe Daren's brother, the cop can. Eli knows that Price is looking for him. He persuades Blair to elope with him. And we wonder if the cops will be able to stop him in time.",
