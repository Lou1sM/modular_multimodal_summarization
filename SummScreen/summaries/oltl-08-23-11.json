    "soap_central": "\n\n\"Mornin', Pa,\" Bo greeted Asa as he arrived at Asa's grave. Bo advised his father that he wished Asa was only hiding. Bo confessed that he would be willing to overlook the arrest warrant he'd had for Asa and look the other way, if only Asa could return. Bo declared that everyone missed Asa and the fact that Asa had always taken care of the family. Everyone was doing a \"lousy job\" without Asa, Bo admitted. He was certain that Asa would have something to say about all of it.\n\n\n\"I need you,\" Bo proclaimed. He turned quickly when he heard a branch snap behind him. It was Renee, and she and Bo greeted each other with a hug. \"How's the old coot doing?\" Renee asked. Bo explained that he'd wanted to update his father on all that was going on. Renee laughed that the old man was probably a better listener then he used to be. Bo was certain that Renee was the only person who Asa had ever listened to.\n\n\nRenee admitted that she was finally accepting the fact that Asa was gone. \"Well, that makes one of us,\" Bo responded. He wished that Asa could just return and \"whip\" everyone into shape. He acknowledged that it wouldn't be without a fight. Renee looked at Bo and asked him what was wrong. She could tell that something wasn't right.\n\n\nBo revealed that part of him was glad that Asa wasn't there. Asa wouldn't have approved of the way that one of his sons was behaving.\n\n\nKelly and Joey spoke on the phone to each other and agreed they were ready for their move to London. Kelly looked at her mound of luggage, but assured Joey that she didn't have much. They were both interrupted when someone rang their doorbells, and they said goodbye.\n\n\nIn the study at Llanfair, Clint studied a photo of Asa, as Nigel walked into the study with Clint's breakfast. Clint didn't want it, but Viki advised Nigel to put it down in front of Clint. \"He will eat. Warden's orders,\" Viki stated. Clint accused Viki of allowing him to live at Llanfair in order to boss him around.\n\n\nClint was depressed about the fact that Joey was leaving, but Viki thought that Clint could have a new chance with Rex and Shane. She reassured Clint that the rest of the family were still around too. Clint reminded her he had been \"kicked to the curb,\" though Nigel piped up that he was comfortable at their new residence.\n\n\nViki reminded Clint that he was alive thanks to Shane's mother, and they were the only family that Rex and Shane had. Clint grumbled that there was hardly any family left, and Viki retorted that he was only saying that because of Joey's move. Nigel handed Clint the framed photo of Asa. Viki gasped. She'd forgotten that it was the anniversary of Asa's death.\n\n\n\"Feels like yesterday,\" Clint stated. He couldn't believe that it had happened four years before. Viki offered to take flowers to Asa's grave, but Clint didn't think it was a good idea. The grave was probably already inundated with flowers thanks to Renee. Clint was still sulking about Joey's imminent departure, and Nigel assured him that his family in London would \"do right\" by Joey.\n\n\nViki was sure that Joey would be fine with Kelly, and they were right for each other. Clint declared that the couple had always been right for each other, but the \"gold-digging tramp\" had gotten in the way. Viki proclaimed that Joey had learned his lesson, and Clint agreed that Kelly would keep Joey in line.\n\n\nViki suggested that Joey might return home one day, but Clint disagreed. He noted that they couldn't count on that, because people always left without saying goodbye. At that point, Viki thought it would be a good idea to invite lots of people to the house to talk about Asa. Nigel returned to the room with a huge glass of orange juice, but Clint was unhappy. He had always poured a glass of bourbon on the anniversary of Asa's death, he told Viki.\n\n\nViki volunteered to get a bottle of bourbon, and she'd be the one to pour it. Clint argued that it had to be done at his family home, and Asa would be furious if the event didn't occur there. He demanded a car, but Viki reminded him that he would be arrested if he left the house. She suggested that they start a new tradition instead, and she went off to get a bottle of bourbon. Nigel agreed to get some ice.\n\n\nClint looked at Asa's photo. \"Pa, don't you worry. I'll be seeing you at home today. I don't give a damn what happens to me. This is one promise I'm never going to break.\"\n\n\nJoey answered the front door at Llanfair and was surprised to see Aubrey standing there. Aubrey spotted Joey's luggage and asked if he were heading for a vacation. Joey announced that he was moving away for good. Aubrey was surprised to learn that Joey was moving to London, especially because she knew how close he wanted to be to his family in Llanview.\n\n\nJoey explained that he wanted to make a \"fresh start.\" He began to brush Aubrey off as she continued to chat. He advised her that he didn't have time, but he stopped short when she handed him her engagement ring. Joey reminded her that it was her ring, but Aubrey declared that she should have returned it sooner. She had held onto it because it had felt like she was still with him, she explained. Joey confessed that he'd forgotten all about it.\n\n\nAubrey acknowledged that she'd thought about pawning it, but she set it on the table. Joey revealed that he was going to London with Kelly. Shocked, Aubrey made it clear that she had really loved Joey, though she assumed that he wouldn't believe her. She hoped that Joey and Kelly would be happy.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian tried on her new name for size. \"Senator Dorian Lord,\" she said. David walked into the study with a Swedish breakfast, and both the husband and wife announced that they had some news. David advised his wife that they were moving to Stockholm, but Dorian replied that she couldn't move there. \"I got a movie, baby,\" David disclosed. It was a big-time movie, one based on a comic book, he added.\n\n\nDorian was speechless. \"This can't be happening,\" she proclaimed. David rambled on about how great Sweden would be, but Dorian revealed her own news. She was going to Washington to finish out the term of a senator who had been involved in some scandal. She'd also been asked to run for the office in November. The deputy mayor would be taking over for her in Llanview. She thought the sound of her name sounded good. David frowned.\n\n\nDorian defended her position. She felt that she could make a real impact in Washington, and she wanted David to accompany her. They could show everyone what a \"stable home life\" they had. David replied that she was asking him to give up his dream, and Dorian responded that the same went for her. \"One of us is going to have to make a sacrifice,\" she said.\n\n\nThey agreed that they both had a \"chance of a lifetime.\" Dorian described how Washington needed more women in office, and she even had a solution for the health care program. David admitted that Dorian should go, and he decided that he would go with her after all. Dorian was thrilled, but she had something to say. While she loved David, she'd just realized that he couldn't go with her.\n\n\nDorian thought it would be a \"recipe for disaster,\" and David would resent her and start to look at other women. David resolved that they could be a power couple. He'd be in Hollywood, and Dorian could stay in Washington. He would return by election night, and they would rule Washington. Dorian agreed, and after that, they could rule Hollywood. Then the world, David added. They sealed the deal with a kiss.\n\n\nKelly hung up the phone and answered the door. It was John, and he was there to see the mayor. Kelly advised him that Dorian was busy, but she had news of her own. Kelly was moving to London with Joey. She explained that she wanted to be with her son, and she insisted that she'd wanted to say goodbye. They joked that it was Kelly's way to avoid a tearful scene with John. He wished her luck, and he asked why she really hadn't told him.\n\n\nKelly admitted that she was aware that John would have his own opinion of things, and John agreed. He felt that Kelly deserved someone better than both himself and Joey. He asked if it were the \"real deal.\" Kelly stated that it was, just like John and Natalie.\n\n\nKelly believed that John could work it out with Natalie. She didn't think that John should move on without trying, and she didn't want him to let his pride get in the way. John agreed to think about it. Kelly advised John to take care of himself, and they hugged each other.\n\n\nNatalie and Rex returned to Rex's house upon their return from Kentucky. Natalie understood that Rex was disappointed, but Rex revealed that he did have some news. He had seen a Gigi after all, but \"not my Gigi,\" he said. Natalie asked if it were just some random woman with the same name. Rex awkwardly explained that it had been the woman's stage name.\n\n\nNatalie could sense that Rex was hiding something, and after lots of shouting, Rex admitted that the woman had been Kimberly Andrews. Natalie wasn't surprised to hear that Kimberly was \"back on the pole,\" after breaking Clint's heart. Natalie clarified that she would hate for Kimberly to be with Clint again, but Rex thought maybe it would be a good idea if he helped to get the couple back together.\n\n\nNatalie made Rex promise not to tell Clint that he'd seen Kimberly, and she assured Rex that she'd check on him later. Rex thanked her for flying out to Kentucky with him. He revealed that when he'd spoken to the waitress at the end of the evening, he'd really seen Gigi. Natalie hugged him and told him how sorry she was. \"It'll stop,\" she said. Rex said it wouldn't, because Gigi had advised him not to give up.\n\n\n\"Good morning, looking-good girl,\" Kimberly said to the unconscious woman lying in the bed in a hospital room. Kimberly told the unknown woman that Rex had visited, but she hadn't revealed anything. Rex hadn't changed, and she'd had no chance to talk about Sierra Rose, Kimberly continued.\n\n\n\"My cowboy had a heart attack,\" Kimberly announced, as she told the woman all about the latest details of both Clint and Rex. She was upset that Clint had almost died, and he would have died thinking that Kimberly was a tramp. \"Clint needs me,\" Kimberly declared. She also thought it was time that she got back at David for forcing her to leave.\n\n\nKimberly promised that she would make certain that the staff looked after the woman. Clint needed Kimberly, and Kimberly had to return to Llanview. She would get her money and her man, and she would take care of David. Kimberly admitted it would be a risk, but she thought that Clint was worth it. She promised to always take care of the woman. A photo of Kimberly and Stacy sat on the table next to the bed.\n\n\nJoey insisted that Aubrey keep the ring, as he'd given it to her in good faith. Aubrey reminded him that she hadn't accepted it in good faith, but Joey placed it in her hand. Aubrey wished him luck, and just as the couple hugged, Kelly arrived.\n\n\n\"Oh, that was nothing,\" Aubrey stated as she and Joey separated. \"I know,\" Kelly replied. Aubrey wished them luck. \"But we don't need luck,\" Kelly said rudely. \"Must be nice,\" Aubrey said as she left. Kelly apologized for being harsh, but Joey thought she'd been just right.\n\n\nViki and Nigel returned to the study with the bourbon and ice, but Viki thought it would be a good idea to retrieve Joey to say goodbye. Clint ordered Nigel to get the car, and take the bourbon along too. He assured the butler that they'd have their drink before anyone noticed they were gone. Nigel reminded his employer of the ankle monitor that would go off, but Clint strongly felt that he couldn't break a promise to his father.\n\n\nViki was out in the foyer with Joey, and she couldn't believe all of the luggage that sat there. Joey assured her that it was mostly Kelly's. Suddenly, they heard an alarm. They followed the sound to the study, and Joey picked up the monitor sitting on the desk. \"Dad where did you go?\" Joey wondered.\n\n\nJohn met with Dorian, and she revealed that she'd resigned her position as mayor. She urged John to speak to the deputy mayor instead. John assumed there had been a scandal, but he was there because Irene Manning had asked for Dorian. He wanted to know why.\n\n\nDorian suggested that Irene might have thought that Dorian could use her influence to obtain Irene's release, but Irene was crazy. Dorian claimed that she hardly knew Irene, except for their connection through Victor Lord. \"Is that right?\" John inquired skeptically.\n\n\nDorian urged him to wish Llanview's ex-mayor luck, because she had been appointed to the Senate. \"Luck. We're all gonna need it,\" John declared on his way out. Dorian ran off to her office. David heard the doorbell and opened the door. It was Kimberly. \"You,\" was all he could muster.\n\n\nJohn returned to the police station, deep in thought. He recalled Kelly's parting advice regarding Natalie.\n\n\nAlone, Rex looked at the photo of himself, Shane, and Gigi. He asked for a sign. He turned when he heard a noise, and it was Clint, who was sitting in his wheelchair.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "It's the 4-year anniversary of Asa Buchanan's passing. Bo is at his father's gravesite admitting that he kind of wishes Asa was back since everybody's lives have been in shambles without him. Renee also comes by and greets him while visiting Asa. Clint is also aware of this day. While staying at Viki's on house arrest, he tells Nigel that he knows his father would be disgraced to know that Clint has allowed himself and Nigel to give up his house to Rex. So, although Viki tells him she will not \"help\" him get to Asa's and he knows it's a parole violation, he is determined to defy it to get to Asa's home so that he and Nigel can toast Asa. But sure enough, as soon as he escapes, the alarm goes off and Viki and Joey know he's gone and gotten himself into trouble. Joey is ready to move to London with Kelly. Aubrey comes by and admits she is till not over Joey. John comes by Kelly's home to say good bye to her and she urges him not to give up on Natalie like she almost gave up on Joey. Rex reveals to Natalie that while at The Spotted Pony in KY, he ran into Kimberly the pole dancer who was briefly married to Clint after attempting to scam him with her best friend, Stacy, Gigi's sister, whom everybody believes has died. It sounds like Kimberly is going to attempt to reach out to Clint and get him back. She knows that she will have to \"defy\" David who broke them up. And it appears that Stacy Morasco, Gigi's sister, may not be dead.",
