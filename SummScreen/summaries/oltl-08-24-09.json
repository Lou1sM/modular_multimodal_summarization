Initially, Todd hesitated, but he agreed to allow Marty to counsel him.  The counseling session became intense when Marty questioned why Todd  had slept with Blair, although he claimed to have feelings for T\u00e9a.  Explaining that Blair had seduced him, Todd maintained that he was finally over Blair, and  expressed his desire to move forward with T\u00e9a.\n\n\nFascinated by Todd's sense of logic, Marty continued to press Todd for answers.  Marty listened intently as Todd related his experience with T\u00e9a on the deserted island.  Realizing that Todd was serious about his feelings for T\u00e9a, Marty wondered why Todd was hesitant to admit that he loved T\u00e9a.  Confessing that Marty was the last woman that he had loved, Todd reminded Marty of the hurt he had caused her.  As Marty continued to delve into Todd's past, she became convinced that Todd's past involvement with her was preventing him from moving forward and building a new life with T\u00e9a.\n\n\nMarty appeared affected by her discussion with Todd.  Marty warned Todd that he would never have a meaningful relationship unless he stopped living in the past.  Baffled by Marty's emotional outburst, Todd wondered if Marty was actually referring to her own situation.   Touched by his conversation with Marty, Todd admitted that he had been holding back concerning his true feelings for T\u00e9a.   With a look of concern, Todd told Marty, \"I don't want to be the reason you can't move on with John.  I seriously hope you can!\"  As Todd left the office, Marty appeared stunned by his statement.  Later, Marty noticed the lunch that John had prepared for her.  A smile crossed Marty's face as she thought about John.\n\n\nAt Todd's house,  Elijah urged T\u00e9a to cooperate and give Ross Rayburn what he desired.  Pleading with Elijah to understand, T\u00e9a claimed that she was unable to give Ross what he wanted.   Terrified that Todd would learn of her secret, T\u00e9a begged Elijah to convince Ross that Elijah had failed to retrieve the item that Ross sought.  When Elijah refused to sympathize with her, T\u00e9a scolded him for working with Ross, and vowed to take her secret to the grave.  Elijah warned T\u00e9a that threatening Ross wasn't a good idea.\n\n\nClinging to a renewed sense of hope, T\u00e9a remembered that as a result of the role he had  played in the attempted kidnapping of Todd's children, Ross was living in Tahiti as a fugitive and was unable to enter the United States.  Relating that Ross had nothing to lose, Elijah made it clear that Ross wouldn't hesitate when it came to destroying Todd.   Furious, T\u00e9a threatened to use her power to have Ross extradited back to the U.S.  Once Ross was returned to Llanview, T\u00e9a stressed that he would be prosecuted on kidnapping charges and sent to prison.  \n\n\nGloating, a confident T\u00e9a remarked, \"Tell Ross to back off!\"  With a smirk, Elijah placed a call to someone.  Handing the phone to T\u00e9a, Elijah stated, \"Tell him yourself!\"  T\u00e9a accepted the call and spoke directly to Ross.  Displaying no fear, T\u00e9a declared, \"Ross, you think you can push me, I'll push right back!\"\n\n\nReminding T\u00e9a that Ross was a dangerous man, Elijah commented that T\u00e9a's secret would destroy her relationship with Todd.  Near tears, T\u00e9a begged Elijah not to reveal her secret to Todd.  Unmoved by T\u00e9a's emotional state, Elijah walked away.  Alone, T\u00e9a fell to the floor and wept.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Blair was elated when Rex announced that he had located Ross Rayburn in Tahiti.  Blair was certain that Ross could provide answers regarding T\u00e9a's missing years, but Rex informed her that he hadn't uncovered any evidence that linked T\u00e9a to Ross during the time period in question.  Rex related that Ross had been living with an unknown woman during the time T\u00e9a's whereabouts were unaccounted for.  Stating that Ross had used several aliases, Rex admitted that T\u00e9a might have also lived under an assumed name.  When Blair insisted that T\u00e9a was the mystery woman, Rex reminded Blair that her assumption hadn't been proven.\n\n\nAnxious to expose T\u00e9a's past, Blair suggested that Rex accompany her to Tahiti to confront Ross.  Explaining that he had family business to attend to, Rex told Blair that he couldn't travel to Tahiti.   Cautioning Blair that Todd might seek revenge against her for hurting T\u00e9a, Rex warned Blair that she might also ruin her own life in the process of destroying T\u00e9a.  Disregarding Rex's warning, Blair raced off with the file that contained information regarding Ross Rayburn's whereabouts.\n\n\nWhile walking along the pier, Schuyler encountered Gigi.  Noticing  Schuyler's nervous demeanor, Gigi reminded him that Llanview was a small town and that they would probably run into each other often.  Schuyler told Gigi about his conversation with Rex.  Gigi was appalled to learn that Rex had paid Schuyler a visit and suggested that he leave town.\n\n\n Irritated by Rex's interference, Gigi stated that she had made it clear to Rex that the kiss she had shared with Schuyler meant nothing.    Unable to contain his emotions, Schuyler blurted out, \"It meant something to me!\"  Schuyler confessed to a shocked Gigi that he had strong feelings for her and couldn't stop thinking about the kiss.  Touched by Schuyler's revelation, Gigi replied, \"I do care about you, but I'm in love with Rex!\"  Stating that he understood Gigi's predicament, Schuyler insisted that he place some distance between Gigi and himself.  Schuyler was doubtful that there was any reason to remain in Llanview.  Gigi told Schuyler that she didn't want him to leave town.  As a teary-eyed Gigi stated that she wanted Schuyler to be happy, Schuyler walked away.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy and Kim discussed  how Stacy would seduce Schuyler.  Insisting that in order to trick Rex into believing that she was carrying his child, Stacy was adamant that she needed to conceive that night.  Commenting on Schuyler's love for Gigi, Stacy wondered if she would succeed at convincing Schuyler to have sex with her in one night.\n\n\nDisplaying a bottle of pills, Kim suggested that Stacy drug Schuyler.  Reminding Kim that Schuyler was a recovering addict, Stacy was skeptical about drugging him.  Kim convinced Stacy that a small amount of the drug wouldn't hurt Schuyler.  Kim was certain that placing the drug in his drink would allow Stacy the opportunity to have her way with Schuyler.  Pushing Stacy out the door, Kim laughed, \"Get out there and make your baby!  You'll have a new bun in the oven and no one will know it isn't Rex's child!\"\n\n\nAt Mayor Lowell's press conference, a sarcastic Dorian attempted to provoke Viki by suggesting that Viki run for mayor.  When Viki expressed no desire to enter the political arena, Dorian stated that Viki wasn't capable of launching a successful campaign against Mayor Lowell.  As Dorian and Viki bickered, Charlie barged into the press conference and confronted the mayor about  rescinding Charlie's work permit.  While the members of the press took notes, Charlie questioned how the mayor could sacrifice the large number of jobs that Charlie's construction project brought to the community.  Sensing that a media attack was on the horizon, Dorian pledged her support to Mayor Lowell's campaign and ushered the press members away from Charlie.  Afterward, May or Lowell warned Charlie not to make any public accusations unless Charlie could back them up.\n\n\nDetermined to convince the mayor to vote in favor of her becoming chief of staff of Llanview Hospital, Dorian offered him her private number and suggested that they discuss plans for an upcoming fundraising campaign over dinner.  Meanwhile, a disgusted Viki cringed as she listened to Dorian flirt with Mayor Lowell.\n\n\nLater, Viki laughed as she told Charlie about Dorian's  proposal that Viki run for mayor.  To Viki's surprise, Charlie reminded Viki of her love for the town, and suggested that she consider a mayoral run.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Gigi confronted Rex about his visit with Schuyler.  Outraged, Gigi questioned why Rex would encourage Schuyler to leave town.\n\n\nDistraught,  Schuyler returned home and trashed his apartment as he thought about his failed relationship with Gigi.  Schuyler was surprised when he discovered Stacy at the door.  Reminding Schuyler that he had invited her over, Stacy barged into the apartment.  Observing Schuyler's emotional state, Stacy wondered if something had gone wrong between him and Gigi.  When Schuyler commented that Gigi loved Rex, Stacy reminded Schuyler of the close times they once shared.  Stacy insisted that she wanted to help Schuyler.  As a depressed Schuyler lay across the bed, Stacy laced his drink with drugs.  Unaware of Stacy's plan for him, Schuyler took a sip.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, an elated Dorian rushed into Blair's room.  Excited to tell her niece the news about her possible reinstatement at Llanview Hospital, Dorian paused when she discovered Blair packing.  When Dorian inquired about Blair's plans, Blair announced, \"I booked a flight to Tahiti!\"\n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a headed to the door with her luggage.  When T\u00e9a opened the door, she discovered Todd standing there.  Staring at her bags, Todd asked, \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\n",
