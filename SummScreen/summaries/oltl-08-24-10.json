Jessica found it amusing that they had so many coincidences with their pregnancies, like the fathers of their babies. Natalie was taken aback, but Jessica clarified that both fathers-to-be were cops. Both she and Natalie were sick at the same time and had found out they were pregnant the same day. They had the same doctor, and they were there at the same time. The girls had a laugh, and then Jessica was called to see the doctor first.\n\n\nNatalie gasped as she remained in the waiting room and filled out forms. In the space for the name of the baby's father, she had imagined Brody's name written in. Jessica spoke with the doctor and explained that she wasn't sure about the date of conception. It was one of two dates. The doctor asked for some information on the father, and Jessica was hesitant. The doctor noted that Jessica had lost a previous baby to Rh disease, and she told Jessica that whatever Jessica had to say would remain confidential.\n\n\nJessica confessed that she was 99% sure that the baby was Brody's, but she wasn't completely positive. The doctor confirmed that Jessica would be unable to have a paternity test until the second trimester. Jessica was afraid of putting the baby at risk, but Dr. Wright advised her that treatment for a possible Rh disease wouldn't be conducted until later in the pregnancy, so there was no danger right away. She thought that Jessica should concern herself with having a healthy baby, and Jessica agreed.\n\n\nJessica was finished with her examination, and Natalie was called to see the doctor. The doctor suggested genetic counseling for the baby's father, and she asked Natalie the same questions she had asked Jessica. Curiously, Natalie's answers were the same. She confessed that she was 99% sure that the father of her baby was her boyfriend, and she had two possible dates of conception. Dr. Wright advised Natalie about the paternity test, and as Natalie went to undress, she mumbled that the baby had to be John's. She didn't think it would be fair for him to lose another one. Both young women learned that their due dates were in February.\n\n\nAt the country club, many of Llanview's finest citizens were gathered for the double wedding. John knocked on the door of David's cabana after being informed that Eli was inside. There was no response, and after Brody arrived, John kicked in the door. The place was empty. Detective Price arrived and advised the men he had been jumped from behind. He had found himself lying in the bushes.\n\n\nDestiny apologized to Dani for Shaun's refusal to help find T\u00e9a, but she knew he was hiding something. She suggested that Darren's brother might be able to help instead, since he was a cop. Dani told Darren and Destiny that she had heard from Todd. He wanted her to know that he hadn't had any luck in locating T\u00e9a yet. Destiny thought that Todd always got whatever he wanted.\n\n\nStarr told Cole that he should \"enjoy the show\" of the day, and she kissed him as James looked on. She thanked Cole for \"setting James straight,\" though she was unhappy that the two young men had been about to fight. Langston informed James that Starr was with Cole. \"End of story,\" she added. James claimed that he just wanted to have a good time at the double wedding. Starr and James couldn't keep themselves from looking at each other. Starr wanted to check with the babysitter, and Cole went to get refills for their drinks.\n\n\nLangston assured James he could drop her hand after Starr looked away. She advised him to stay away from Starr, and she threatened him if he didn't follow her advice. James admired her loyalty. Langston had wedding duties, and she left James alone. He sent Starr a text message that read, \"Having fun yet?\" \"Shouldn't you be asking your own date?\" Starr replied. \"I'm asking you Twinkle,\" James wrote back.\n\n\nBo hoped to give David some fatherly advice, he told Matthew and Nora. After Matthew wandered away, Bo confided that he was looking forward to hearing that John had placed Eli under arrest.\n\n\nCole and Matthew empathized with each other regarding the women and situations in their lives. Cole returned to Starr as she texted back to James, \"Don't you Twinkle me.\" She admitted to Cole that she hadn't called the babysitter because she had been receiving text messages from James. Cole read the latest one that stated she was beautiful when she was angry. Cole wanted to put an end to James's latest undertaking, and he promised that he wouldn't \"lose it.\" He knew James wanted that to happen, and Cole was not about to look like the bad guy. Starr asked Cole to behave. He stated that he was \"a lover, not a fighter.\" He began to kiss her passionately as James watched.\n\n\nMatthew ran across Darren and Destiny, and they explained they were trying to catch all of the garters and bridal bouquets at any wedding they attended. Matthew compared himself to his brother and admitted that he had been a jerk to Dani and Nate. Destiny didn't disagree, and she thought that Matthew should talk to Dani about her mother.\n\n\nShaun called his girlfriend, Dr. Vivian Wright, but she informed him that she was unable to get away for the wedding. She had several appointments in her busy office, and she was enjoying the rotation in the field. Shaun confessed that he thought something was bound to happen. Dani found Shaun and begged him again to help her find her mother. Shaun stressed that T\u00e9a didn't want to be found, though he wished he could help.\n\n\nMatthew located Dani and told her how sorry he was about her mother. He mentioned how T\u00e9a had been a great help to him, but he remembered how special it was when he and Dani turned out to be such good friends. He admitted he had been a jerk, and Dani agreed. She wondered if he would have apologized if her mother weren't ill. Matthew acknowledged that he would have done so \"eventually.\" He still cared about Dani, and he wanted her to know he was there for her.\n\n\nCharlie and Viki couldn't believe that Dorian had thanked them for their success in getting her and David back together. Viki thought there was no one around more perfect for each other than David and Dorian, but Charlie took exception to that. Viki smiled, and the pair embraced.\n\n\nDorian looked at herself in the mirror in her cabana and admitted that she was \"the happiest woman.\" She tried to practice her vows, but Langston arrived to find out about any last-minute errands. She urged her mother to \"speak from your heart.\" Langston was happy for Dorian, but Dorian thought that Langston was \"remarkable.\" She hoped that Langston would be able to find a man to make her as happy as Dorian was.\n\n\nLangston learned that Blair and Eli would not participate in the wedding ceremony, and she left to announce it to the assembled crowd. As the muttering ensued, Nora chased after Langston for further information. Langston assured her she didn't know where Blair and Eli had gone, and Starr didn't know anything either. Nora ran off to find Bo. Viki was worried and hoped there wasn't a disaster. Langston retrieved Dorian's bouquet and delivered it to her mother. Langston headed back to James and found him watching Cole and Starr kiss. \"Do you get it now?\" she asked him. She couldn't stay because she was still trying to find David.\n\n\nBo arrived at David's cabana and learned that Eli had escaped when Detective Price was knocked out. Bo picked up an envelope that was left behind, but he informed the others the note inside had nothing to do with Eli's escape. Nora arrived and filled the cops in on Blair and Eli's departure. Bo sent out for an immediate search for Blair and Eli, and he handed Nora the envelope. Brody learned that Eli had picked up his car, and the attendant had overheard Eli telling Blair that she would have \"a wedding to end all weddings.\"\n\n\nNora went to search for Dorian, and when she found her, asked to speak to her alone. Dorian was annoyed and suggested all manner of ways for Nora to get a message to her because Dorian was about to be married. Nora noted that it wasn't official business. She handed the note to Dorian, but the mayor refused to look at it. Dorian admitted she had Langston looking for David. Nora was adamant, and Dorian finally acquiesced to read the note. \"Oh David, not again,\" Dorian muttered. She told Nora she was fine and walked away.\n\n\nNearby, Viki and Charlie watched. Viki still had a bad feeling about the day's events. Cole wanted to make his point again, and as he and Starr began to kiss, Starr looked over his shoulder. She realized that something was wrong and left Cole to find out what. Cole received a text message from James that said, \"We kissed like that for show too.\"\n\n\nViki and Starr joined Nora and read the letter. Langston stood with them as Viki announced to the crowd that there would be no wedding. A shocked Dorian was back in her cabana. She wondered how he could do that to her as she cleared a table of all of its items in one swift motion, knocking them all to the floor.\n\n\nBack at the police station, Bo asked Price to look at some mug shots. Brody revealed that all plane, train, and bus routes had been covered, and it was apparent that Blair and Eli had not left town via any of those modes. John suggested that all toll roads, and everything pertaining to travel by car, be checked out. Price was unsuccessful with the mug shots. Bo decided that he couldn't let any of the Cramers learn about the crisis yet.\n\n\nNatalie and Jessica stood at the front desk of the doctor's office to make their next appointment. The clerk was confused and thought that Brody was the father of Natalie's baby. Natalie corrected her, and the clerk laughed. Obviously the women knew who their babies' fathers were. She had looked at the wrong file.\n\n\nVivian called Shaun and advised him she'd be able to make the wedding after all, since she had a cancellation. Shaun admitted he had lots on his mind, and the wedding had been postponed. He would see her later, he told her. Their connection was broken abruptly. Shortly after, an unseen assailant dragged an unconscious Shaun across the ground. His phone lay nearby.\n\n\nEveryone at the country club was stunned at the latest turn of events. Nora told Matthew that David was gone, and she confirmed that Bo had gone to look for the groom.\n\n\nThe police were able to determine that a couple fitting Blair and Eli's description had been seen boarding a plane at a small airfield. There was no flight plan, and the couple's destination was unknown. John proclaimed that they needed to find the couple before Blair was Eli's next victim.\n\n\nViki advised Charlie that she wanted to stay to support Dorian. She urged him to go home. Charlie was proud of her and noted that was one of the things he loved about her.\n\n\nStarr felt sadness towards Dorian, but she thought it was better than being with the wrong person. Cole felt that was a good reason to be able to hold onto the right person when someone found them. James was still busy sending text messages. Cole texted \"Go to hell.\"\n\n\nLangston approached Dorian's cabana and heard screaming and crying as Dorian destroyed the interior. Finally finished, Dorian held a pillow to her mouth and screamed her lungs out. Langston called out to Dorian and walked in gingerly when she heard silence in return. She found Dorian curled in a fetal position as she sobbed on the floor.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian is ready for her wedding. All the guests are there. But nobody can find David. Meanwhile, the cops are ready to find and bust Eli before it's too late. But he's gone and they suspect he's kidnapped Blair. Starr is with Cole but appears to have James on the brain and responds to texts he sends her whenever one or both are alone. James is with Langston clearly distracted and only wanting to use her to make Starr jealous. Cole catches him sending texts to Starr and confronts him. Meanwhile, Natalie and Jessica both have OB/GYN appointments. Vivian, Shaun's girlfriend is their OB. She asks them both the date of conception and about the fathers of their respective babies. And they both admit to her, after confirming that she is bound by confidentiality laws, that they are 100% certain of whom the father of their baby is. At the wedding, Dorian gets what appears to be a letter from David telling her he's left her at the alter again. So the wedding has to be called off. And she breaks down and loses it.",
