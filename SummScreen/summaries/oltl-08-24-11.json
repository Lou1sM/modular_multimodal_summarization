    "soap_central": "\n\nRenee wondered what Bo had meant when he'd talked about \"what Asa's sons had done to the family.\" Bo clarified that Clint seemed to be a stranger, and Bo had let his son down. He continued that Asa had always said that a man was measured by his family, and his word. Bo believed that \"I came up short on both.\" Renee told him to stop talking like \"a damn fool.\"\n\n\nRenee knew that the family had lots of troubles, but insisted that they were stronger for it. She recognized how much David had improved as a person since finding out that he was a Buchanan. She went on that what had happened to Matthew was a tragedy, but there was nothing that Bo could have done about it. Renee knew that Asa had always been proud of his sons. She told Bo that she saw Asa every time she looked at Clint and Bo.\n\n\nRenee told Bo that there were many things to be grateful for. He agreed, and thought that it was time to start telling people that he was going to be a grandfather. Thinking he meant David and Dorian, Renee began to laugh hysterically. She stopped laughing when Bo admitted that Matthew was the one having a child. Shocked, she didn't know what to say. He explained that it had happened right before Matthew's accident. He and Nora had been surprised too, but said it was a good thing, even though it would be tough. \"That's what Buchanans live for,\" Renee replied.\n\n\nRex looked at Gigi's picture, and promised that he wouldn't give up. He wanted her to tell him more, and begged for a sign. Just then, Clint wheeled himself into the room, and Rex demanded to know what Clint was doing there. Clint replied that he wanted a \"father-son moment.\" At Rex's skepticism, Clint clarified that he'd meant between himself and Asa. He explained his annual ceremony that he'd performed every year on the anniversary of Asa's death, but Rex demanded that Clint leave.\n\n\nRex threatened to call the police, but Clint called Rex's bluff. He'd thought that Rex would understand, because Rex knew what it was like to lose someone, and do everything he could to keep that person alive. Exasperated, Rex asked what the ceremony involved. As Clint explained it, Rex followed step-by-step. He poured a glass of bourbon for Asa, and put it on the mantel, along with a picture of Asa. Bo entered the house and watched as Rex poured a glass for Clint. \"Thank you, son,\" Clint said as Rex handed him the glass.\n\n\nBo entered the room, and Clint wondered if Bo had his handcuffs. Clint promised that Nigel was going to take him right back home. Bo poured a glass of bourbon for himself, and lamented the fact that Asa had never gotten to know Rex as his grandson. He explained that Asa had been tough, but would always admit when he was wrong about something or someone. Bo toasted to learning from Asa's strengths and weaknesses. Clint swore that he could feel Asa in the room.\n\n\nRex told Bo and Clint to do what they needed, but Rex had somewhere to be. Bo said that he smiled thinking about his father, and hoped Rex would someday get the same chance. \"I won't hold my breath,\" Rex said, and turned to leave. Rex told Nigel to lock up on the way out, and left the house. Bo told Nigel to take Clint. Nigel wondered where he was supposed to take Clint. \"Home,\" Bo said, and smiled.\n\n\nRex arrived at Gigi's grave with flowers in hand. He'd heard that visiting her grave was supposed to make him feel closer to her, but it didn't. He continued that the gravestone said that Gigi was there, but he refused to believe it, because believing would make it true. He said he hadn't seen Gigi since he'd asked for a sign from her, but realized that her absence could be the sign he was looking for. He brushed away an old bouquet of flowers, and was shocked to find that Gigi's death date on the gravestone was completely scratched out.\n\n\nViki hoped that Kelly would return to say goodbye to her and Clint, and Joey assured her that Kelly would return. They heard a beeping sound from the living room, and entered to see Clint's ankle monitor on the table. As Joey turned it off, Viki told her son that Clint's car was gone. She tried to call Clint, but he didn't answer. Joey was sure that the police were going to go after Clint. Viki thought that Clint would be going to Statesville after all. Once Clint returned, Viki vowed to make Clint wish he'd gone to Statesville.\n\n\nFurious, Viki ranted about how Clint had thrown away the chance he'd gotten. The court had shown Clint mercy, but Viki knew that they wouldn't show it again. Joey was amazed that Clint had put Viki through so much, but Viki had always stood by Clint. She explained that they had been through a lot, but he was the father of her children, so she would always care about him. Joey told her that he'd thought he only cared about Kelly after all of their history, but he loved her. Viki insisted that the two situations weren't the same.\n\n\nJoey explained that he and Kelly had finally realized that they were meant for each other, and Viki and Clint would eventually realize the same thing. He believed that his parents belonged together like Asa had always said. Viki called Joey a romantic, and said that people in love always wanted those around them to be in love as well.\n\n\nJoey insisted that Clint acted differently, and happier around Viki. Viki wondered why Clint had left if he'd been so happy. Joey knew that Clint hadn't left because of Viki. He thought that Viki had been the greatest thing to happen to Clint, and that Clint was finally realizing it. Viki appreciated the kind words, and hugged her son.\n\n\nClint wheeled himself into the house. Livid, Viki demanded to know where Clint had been. He apologized for worrying them, but he'd had something to take care of. Joey wondered when the police would arrive to \"haul you off.\" Clint was sure that he would be fine, and showed them his new ankle monitor. He said that it had been a gift from Bo, and a nice officer had given Clint the replacement. Joey was surprised that the police had cut Clint some slack, but Viki spat that Clint had been lucky.\n\n\nViki yelled at Clint for leaving, and Clint promised that he wouldn't leave again. \"You'd better not,\" she warned. She shouted that Clint had better be in the same spot she left him when she returned. He wondered where she was going. Angrily mocking Clint, she said that she had something to take care of, and left. Clint wondered what was wrong with Viki. Joey replied that he and Viki had been worried about Clint.\n\n\nDorian entered her office to screams of \"Surprise!\" In her office were Starr, Blair, Kelly, and Addie holding red, white, and blue balloons. They'd wanted to throw her a Bon Voyage party, and showed her a cake. On it was Dorian's face, and the words, \"Congratulations, Dorian, The Original Cramer Woman.\" Addie handed her a gift bag, and Dorian looked inside. She pulled out a photo album filled with pictures of all the Cramer women throughout the years. Starr told Dorian that the women didn't want Dorian to forget them, or the crazy things they'd been through.\n\n\nStarr cut the cake as Dorian wondered how her girls would get along without her. Addie said that they would muddle through, while Dorian still meddled. Blair tried to explain to an offended Dorian that Addie had meant that the women wouldn't have Dorian's advice anymore. Kelly thanked Dorian for getting Kelly back on her feet, and ready to start over with Joey. Suddenly, Dorian blurted out that she wasn't leaving.\n\n\nTalking all at once, the Cramer women wanted to know what Dorian meant. Blair told Dorian that she couldn't back out. Addie promised that they would call her. Dorian wondered why they were trying to push her out the door. Starr wanted Dorian to fulfill her destiny, and be on the world stage. The women wanted Dorian to be happy. Kelly told Dorian that she'd been called to do important work, and that the Cramer women had never been prouder of Dorian.\n\n\nDorian wanted to make a toast, but Blair said she was the \"lady of honor,\" so she couldn't. Blair urged Kelly to start. Kelly remembered arriving in Llanview in a \"terrible place,\" having just lost her mother. Dorian had encouraged Kelly to find out what had happened to Melinda. Kelly thanked Dorian for being the mother she'd never had, and hugged Dorian.\n\n\nAddie stood next to address Dorian. She told Dorian that the big sister was always supposed to take care of everyone, but Dorian had taken over when Addie hadn't been able to. Addie promised to keep the Cramer women safe for as long as Dorian was gone. She hugged Dorian, and handed the spotlight to Starr next.\n\n\nStarr apologized that Hope couldn't be there, but she assured Dorian that she was going to teach Hope everything that Dorian had taught Starr. She promised to teach Hope to respect herself, to stay strong, to fight for her family, and to remember her roots. Starr hugged Dorian, and tears began to be shed. Blair stood to speak, and remembered how she and Dorian hadn't been able to stand each other in the beginning. She continued that there was no one in the world that she trusted as much as she trusted Dorian, because Dorian had always told Blair the truth.\n\n\nThe women clinked glasses, and drank. Dorian thanked them for the party, and for letting her into their lives. Starr set up the timer on her camera. The women posed, and the last Cramer women picture was taken. A short while later, Dorian packed up her office alone. As she walked towards the door, Viki entered the office.\n\n\nThe doorbell rang at La Boulaie, and David was shocked to answer the door to Kim. He thought that she had nerve to return to Llanview, but she was there to pay David back for his blackmail. She walked into the house as she told David that she wanted Clint back. She explained that \"what I did in Kentucky\" had happened a long time before, and that she was a different person because of Clint. David informed Kim that Clint was broke, but Kim already knew. David was surprised that Kim would still want Clint, and wondered why. Kim insisted that she loved Clint, and that there were more important things than money. \"That's debatable,\" David replied.\n\n\nDavid wondered if Kim would want Clint if he was poor and sick, instead of the rich and healthy man that he'd been when Kim had met him. He asked if Kim thought that Clint would take her back. She reminded David how hard Clint had tried to track her down, and how he'd sent David to Morocco when he'd found out that David was the reason she'd left. She wanted David to promise that he wouldn't try to stop her from winning Clint back. David had to protect his uncle according to the \"Buchanan creed,\" but Kim assured David that Clint wasn't in any danger from her.\n\n\nKim told David that he had everything, so was probably very happy. \"Can't I get a shot at happiness too?\" she asked. He agreed, because he was feeling generous. He told Kim that Clint was all hers, and that Clint would never find out about what she'd done at the Spotted Pony, \"at least from me.\"\n\n\nA short while later, David sat on the stairs of La Boulaie, looking through a book, as Blair and Addie entered. They told him about the Bon Voyage party they'd thrown for Dorian. He said something in a foreign language, which Addie recognized as Swedish. He wondered where Dorian was. Blair explained that she was saying goodbye to the most important person in her life.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Clint told Kelly and Joey that they made him happy, but he wasn't happy that they were leaving. Kelly had promised to take Zane to Llanview for his birthday, so she assured Clint that he would see them again. Joey told Clint that Zane wanted to hear all about the family history. \"The real history, or the cleaned-up history?\" Clint joked. Kelly and Joey ordered Clint to take care of himself, and he told them to do the same.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Joey asked if Kelly was ready. She replied that she'd been ready for years. He knew it had taken a while to get to their happy ending, but he thought it had been worth the wait. She agreed, and kissed him, and the two left Llanfair.\n\n\nKim entered Llanfair through the living room door. Clint turned and was shocked, but happy to see her. \"Hey stranger,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo talks to Renee about what disappointments Asa's sons turned out to be. Renee tells him to stop talking nonsense and look at what a great father he has been. He tells her it's time for him to start telling everyone he is going to be s grandfather. Renee breaks up in laughter thinking David and Dorian were having a baby. When she realizes it is Matthew, she becomes serious. Joey discovers that Clint is missing. Viki is concerned that Bo will turn Clint in. Joey suggests that Viki's concern for Clint is more than just concern. Clint goes to Buchanan Mansion to have a father-son moment. He clarifies to Rex that he wants a moment with Asa in the room where he always pays his respects on the anniversary of Asa's death. Rex orders Clint to leave, but then changes his mind and puts Asa's picture and a glass of bourbon on the mantle so Clint can toast him. He gives Clint a glass of water and says he won't let him mess up Gigi's heart. Bo watches from the doorway and hears Clint call Rex, \"son.\" Bo enters and doesn't arrest Clint. Instead, he joins in the toast. Later he tells Nigel to take Clint home. Viki is furious when Clint returns to Llanfair. Joey suggests to Clint that perhaps he still cares for Viki. Rex goes to Gigi's grave and asks for a sign, ready to admit that she is dead. When he picks up the old bouquet of flowers, he sees the date of death has been removed from the headstone. Stacy Morasco's friend, Kim, shows up La Boulaie and tells David she is there to get Clint back. David tells her Clint is broke. She knows and doesn't care. She asks David not to interfere.
