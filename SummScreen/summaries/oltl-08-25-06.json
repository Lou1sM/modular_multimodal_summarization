Spencer sincerely doubted that and wouldn't stop pressing Natalie for details. Spencer wondered what people were saying about him. Spencer asked Natalie what Blair and John were talking about the times he saw them together. Natalie left and ran to the police department. \"I think I screwed things up,\" she blurted to John. \"I think I may have tipped off Spencer.\" When Blair wouldn't answer Spencer's calls he went to find her. \n\n\nBlair told Todd that she was sleeping with Spencer to help him (Todd). \"Do you believe me?\" Todd replied, \"Yes, I do.\" Blair explained the whole scenario regarding the safe deposit box key. Blair wanted Todd to look her in the eye and \"tell me that you love me again.\" Todd didn't think he could and Blair began to cry. \"I really did try to help,\" she wept and then she and Todd began kissing passionately. Clothes started to come off. \n\n\nBruce continued to taunt Adriana, who refused to eat and be friendly to him. Adriana wanted proof that the stalking was Dorian's idea. David popped in at Dorian's to distract her, allowing Rex to snoop around Dorian's house and eavesdrop. Dorian denied any wrongdoing regarding Adriana. \"I know how you like to protect your girls,\" said David. Dorian thought it was hurtful that David would suggest she break up Adriana and Rex. \"You are a liar,\" Rex said as he burst in. Dorian was not amused and was furious with David. Rex demanded the name of the man she hired to stalk Adriana. Dorian wasn't about to give up anything. David left, though Rex wasn't about to leave. In fact, Rex picked up the phone when Adriana was allowed to call home. \n\n\nJohn was surprised to hear that Dr. Snyder (the same drunken doctor who was in the operating room when his father died) was also under investigation for child pornography. Antonio found this out in his new/old job as cop. John realized that this must be what Spencer was holding over Snyder. Antonio searched Snyder's apartment and found the tape called \"Tess.\" Jessica came to the apartment and faced Snyder. \"This tape tore me in half, literally.\" Jessica was also horrified to see a photo of little Jessica/Tess on his computer. \n\n\nHugh came in with the actual safe deposit box. John read a letter that Spencer had written to Todd and Margaret's child. Among many things, Spencer suggested he not try to find his father because he was a bad man. A handwriting expert confirmed that Spencer had written that letter. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie is facing Spencer and she demands to know what the man did to Blair. Spencer wants to know why she would think that he would hurt her. Natalie clams up, but Spencer doesn't let her off the hook. She tries to leave but he will not let her. He wants to know why she thinks that he would hurt Blair. \"I have seen her huddled with McBain Is there something that I should know about?\" Natalie gets him off her back saying that Blair and Starr are her family and she has a right to be concerned about them. Blair spills and tells Todd everything. He is calm for a moment but then realizes that she has been sleeping with this man even though she knew that he was innocent. He thinks that the cops have been pimping her out but she tells that she has been doing this all on her won. She tells of the safety deposit key. \"What is in there?\" Todd asks. She has no idea. John and Hugh look through the safety deposit box back at the office and they find a letter. It is in handwriting but not signed. An expert is brought in and the man is presented with the letter from the safety deposit box and another and he confirms that the author of both letters is the same person. Todd is having trouble absorbing all that Blair has dumped on him. He is afraid that he can't accept this. She had a feeling that things were going to end up this way, but she had to try. He is kind to her at this point. Antonio finds kiddie porn at Eugene's house and when he looks up, Jessica is at the door. She comes in and shouts at Eugene for his crimes. Hugh finds the letter that Spencer has written to be very strange. It seems that it is going to be sent to Todd's child when he is older. There is a photo with the letter. The letter tells the child not to go looking for his father as he wasn't a very good man Bruce has Adriana calm now. He promises that he will not hurt her. He just wants the cash. He lets her call Dorian. Rex gets David to help him sneak into the house and he is there when the phone rings. He gets to it before Dorian. \"Hello?\" he answers. \"Rex?\" she replies. It was almost a 'good' thing. Hugh describes him as a narcissist who likes to be the one who decides what should go on and who gets what. Natalie runs to John and confesses that she might have come on too strong and that Spencer might be on to Blair. \"If he is on to Blair, then she is dead!\" John says. Todd and Blair are too close and they end up kissing tearing their clothes off. Spencer things about Blair and then runs out to find her.",
