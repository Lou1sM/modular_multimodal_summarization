    "soap_central": "\nThe Thin Line Between Love And Rage \n\n\nJohn and Fish set up a sting operation in the hopes of discovering who Keaton was in cahoots with.  John was impressed that Fish had managed to steal Keaton's police shield in order to plant a small bug on the back of the badge.  Fish would be able to monitor Keaton's conversations and track the bad cop's whereabouts on a laptop that he had set up in John's office.  Within a short time, Keaton placed a telephone call to arrange a meeting with someone.\n\n\nWhile John and Fish waited for Keaton to meet his contact, Fish took the opportunity to reveal that he was dating Layla.  Fish was a bit surprised that John didn't appear to have an issue with co-workers dating.  As Fish spoke, he confessed that he feared he might hurt Layla.  John was surprisingly intuitive; he wondered if Fish was concerned because he was lying to Layla about something.  Fish was spared from having to answer John's question when the computer program alerted them that Keaton was near the warehouse front along the piers.\n\n\nFish and John eagerly waited to hear whom Keaton had arranged to meet.\n\n\nCris was outdoors, working on a painting, when Layla approached him.  She had decided to jog to the gym.  As Cris and Layla chatted, Layla confessed that she couldn't get over Stacy's attempt to seduce Fish.  Cris was confident that Stacy wasn't Fish's type.  As Cris reassured Layla, an image of Kyle and Oliver flashed through his mind.\n\n\nAt the gym, Nick and Kyle talked about Fish.  Nick felt bad for the way that Fish had treated Kyle.  Kyle appreciated Nick's support.  Before Kyle walked away, Nick and Kyle made plans to meet.  Later, Layla noticed Nick stretching on a yoga mat.  When Nick saw that she had a similar mat tucked under her arm, he invited her to join him on the floor.  Layla hesitated until Nick assured her that he wasn't trying to pick her up.\n\n\nLayla relaxed when Nick revealed that he was involved with someone.  The two struck up a conversation as they went through their stretches.  Layla confessed that she was happily involved with someone, which prompted Nick to open up about his new relationship.  Layla was surprised when Nick mentioned Kyle's name.  Nick was equally astounded when he discovered that Layla's roommates knew Kyle.\n\n\nLayla was stunned when Nick began to talk about Kyle's ex-boyfriend.  Nick revealed that Kyle's ex-lover was a police officer who was pretending to be straight by dating a woman.  Nick was unaware of the bombshell that he had dropped.  Layla's shock gave way to nausea.  She quickly excused herself before she lost the contents of her stomach .  A short time later, Layla left the gym.\n\n\nKyle was out for a run when he bumped into Cris.  Kyle confided that he had decided to move forward with his life.  He told Cris that he wished Fish well, but it was time to put everything that had happened between them in the past.  Moments after Kyle left, Layla walked up.  She was visibly shaken as she sat down.  Layla realized that Cris had spent months trying to tell her something. She admitted that she knew what it was: Oliver was gay.   Layla explained that she had been forced to face the truth after a chance encounter with someone at the gym.\n\n\nStacy slipped Schuyler some drugs.  Her plan was to trick Schuyler into sleeping with her in the hopes of getting pregnant.  When the drugs took effect, Schuyler flopped down on his bed.  Stacy quickly undressed Schuyler and then climbed into bed with him.  Despite the drugs, Schuyler resisted Stacy's attempts to seduce him.  Schuyler didn't want to be with anyone except Gigi.  Eventually, Schuyler managed to climb out of bed.  He decided to take a shower, but first he wanted Stacy to leave.\n\n\nSchuyler stumbled across the room to open the door and then ordered Stacy out of his apartment.  In the hallway, Stacy worried about how she would get pregnant.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi confronted Rex about his demands that Schuyler leave town.  Gigi was furious, while Rex was unrepentant.  He insisted that Schuyler wanted  Gigi.  Rex feared that Schuyler would eventually take advantage of Gigi's friendship.  Gigi was adamant that she loved Rex.\n\n\nRex lashed out at Gigi as the argument escalated.  He didn't think that asking Schuyler to leave town was any worse than Gigi's attempt to persuade Stacy to have an abortion.  Gigi was hurt by the reminder.  She explained that she had been desperate to save her relationship with Rex.  Gigi admitted that she had a difficult time accepting the fact that her \"bitch of a sister\" was pregnant with Rex's baby.\n\n\nAs the heated argument continued, Gigi decided that she needed some fresh air.  Rex blocked Gigi's efforts to leave the house.  The pushing and shoving gave way to passion as Gigi jumped on Rex and then began kissing him.  After they made love, Rex admitted that he had been wrong to expect Schuyler to leave town.  Rex realized that he didn't have any reason to be concerned about Gigi's fidelity, because she wasn't in love with Schuyler.\n\n\nGigi appreciated Rex's apology.  However, Gigi declined Rex's invitation to join him in the shower.  Gigi claimed that she wanted to straighten up the living room before Shane discovered the mess and figured out what his parents had been doing.\n\n\nT\u00e9a prepared to leave Todd's house, but when she opened the door, she found her way blocked by Todd himself.  When Todd saw T\u00e9a's suitcase, he realized that she was headed out of town.  Todd suspected that T\u00e9a had no intention of returning, despite her claims that she was going to Tennessee for a short business trip.  Todd didn't believe T\u00e9a because she had clearly planned on leaving without informing Todd of the trip.\n\n\nTodd suspected that T\u00e9a was attempting to run away because things were getting serious between them.  He admitted to his own attempt to sabotage their relationship by sleeping with Blair.  T\u00e9a wondered where Todd's insight and honesty were coming from.  Todd surprised T\u00e9a by revealing that he had a therapy session with Marty.\n\n\nTodd confessed that T\u00e9a made him happy and he was also fairly certain that he made T\u00e9a equally happy.  T\u00e9a was moved to tears, but she insisted that she couldn't cancel her trip.  Todd refused to watch T\u00e9a walk away from what they had.   He wondered if T\u00e9a's decision to leave had anything to do with Todd hiring Elijah.  T\u00e9a insisted that Elijah was not the issue, but she refused to elaborate beyond that.\n\n\nTodd resorted to pleading in an effort to sway T\u00e9a to stay in Llanview.  When that failed, Todd tried to bribe her with a romantic dinner in Manhattan.  T\u00e9a refused to change her plans; she maintained that her trip was business-related and that she would return.  Todd grew desperate.  He decided to give T\u00e9a what she wanted.\n\n\nT\u00e9a's confusion turned to disbelief when Todd declared that he loved her.  T\u00e9a warned Todd not to lie about something that important, but Todd insisted that he was sincere; he loved T\u00e9a.  T\u00e9a confessed that she'd been waiting a long time to hear those words.  She said she loved him, too, but she refused cancel her trip.  Todd stood quietly as T\u00e9a gathered her suitcase and then walked away.  However, T\u00e9a didn't get far.  After a few steps, she turned to look back at Todd.\n\n\nTodd approached T\u00e9a, took her suitcase, and then went inside.  T\u00e9a hesitated a few seconds before she followed Todd.  Inside, T\u00e9a and Todd kissed and then slowly walked upstairs to the bedroom, arm in arm.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian opposed Blair's decision to fly to Tahiti to track down Ross Rayburn.  Dorian thought it was unhealthy for Blair to continue obsessing over Todd.  Blair argued that she needed to know what T\u00e9a was hiding, for the sake of the children.  Dorian didn't believe Blair; she was certain that Blair was motivated by a desire to reconcile with Todd.\n\n\nDorian threatened to call John; she hoped that John could talk some sense in to Blair.  Blair was forced to confess that she wanted to \"stick it to that bitch, T\u00e9a Delgado.\"  Dorian wasn't mollified.  Dorian insisted that Blair deserved better than Todd.  Dorian wanted Blair to find someone who would earn Blair's love.  Dorian advised her niece to focus on herself, rather than on Todd, but Blair refused to be deterred from her mission.\n\n\nDorian urged Blair to reconsider; she didn't want Blair to humiliate herself.  Blair watched Dorian leave and then resumed her packing.  Later, as Blair waited for her flight to take off, she vowed that she would ruin T\u00e9a.  Blair was confident that T\u00e9a wouldn't know what hit her until it was too late.  \n\n\n",
