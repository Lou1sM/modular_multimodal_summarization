He stunned Kelly and Ford when he told them that Elijah had disappeared and taken Blair with him for an elopement.  Ford was livid at the thought that he'd put James's safety at risk while Elijah remained at large.  John promised that he'd find his quarry, but Ford had his doubts.  Noticing all the text messages James had sent him, Ford hurried out after ordering John to stop Elijah before anyone else got killed.\n\n\nRetiring to his office with Kelly, John began burning up the phone lines and dispatched a sketch artist to take an eyewitness' description of the person who'd assaulted Detective Price at the country club.  Kelly didn't understand how Elijah could've accosted Price and still found time to escape with Blair, and wondered aloud if the nefarious legal eagle could have accomplices in his scheme.  John admitted it was a possibility, but felt there was still an element of the case that he hadn't yet cracked.\n\n\nAs John continued with his work, he noticed Kelly feverishly making a list.  Kelly was attempting to catalog her every encounter with Elijah for the record, but she couldn't keep it all straight and broke down.  She wept as she told John that her mother hadn't had much of a life, but that Melinda had been a good, kind person who deserved justice; Kelly felt that she'd failed her.  Taking Kelly in his arms, John told her that without her help, they'd never have caught on to Elijah's dirty deeds. He said she'd done well.  \"What if we never find him?\" Kelly asked as she hugged John. \"Or Blair?\"\n\n\nPulling away, Kelly apologized for losing her composure and made light of her tears.  Still solemn, John told her he'd find Elijah, and that Melinda's death would count for something -- Elijah would pay for all his crimes.  \"Now let's go find your cousin,\" he declared, and led her out of the office.\n\n\nAt the hospice, Greg tested T\u00e9a's eyesight, but was dismayed when the ailing attorney told him that she could only see through a haze.  Greg suggested her drug regimen was at fault, but T\u00e9a suspected she was losing her sight permanently.  She wanted him to give it to her straight: \"How much time do I have left?\"  After hemming and hawing, Greg told her she only had a few days.\n\n\nGreg asked T\u00e9a if he could get her anything.  \"Todd and Dani,\" she replied. \"I want to see them -- my husband and my daughter.\"  Greg reminded her of the decision she'd made to say her goodbyes on her own terms, and asked if she was prepared for her family to see what she'd become.  \"I know it ain't pretty,\" T\u00e9a admitted, but said she couldn't stop thinking about Shaun keeping her secret, and what he'd said to her about how he'd fight to spend every last second with his mother if he was in Danielle's position.  \"That's what Dani wants,\" she realized.\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Greg she'd been wrong to push Todd and Danielle away, and admitted she was scared to face her final hours alone.  \"I want to hear my daughter's voice,\" she sobbed. \"I want to see my husband's face.  They have to be the last sounds, the last things I see and hear.\"  Suddenly on edge, Greg told T\u00e9a it was a late date to change her arrangements, but T\u00e9a clung to him and begged him to summon Todd and Danielle to her, whatever it took.  \"I'll hold on,\" she vowed.\n\n\nIn sunny Tahiti, Elijah carried a giddy Blair over the threshold into Ross Rayburn's cottage.  Blair reminded him they weren't married just yet, and reminisced about her last visit to the South Pacific, as Ross's co-conspirator against T\u00e9a.  Elijah told her that Ross wouldn't be there until the following morning, while Blair struggled to get a cellular signal for her phone.  She remembered being able to call out the last time she'd been there, but Elijah pleaded ignorance and blamed the remote location of Ross's island hideaway.\n\n\nElijah thanked Blair for allowing them to visit Ross despite his fugitive status, but Blair recalled that Elijah and Ross weren't very close, and asked her betrothed why they were really there.  Elijah claimed he hadn't cared much for his ne'er-do-well clan until he'd grown close to Blair and the Cramers and seen the \"value\" in it; he wanted a family who could be happy for him.  Remembering how Ross had taken her and Danielle hostage, Blair doubted the con artist would greet her with open arms, but Elijah said that Ross had been pushed to the brink, and mused that he might have snapped worse than his brother if put in a similar corner.\n\n\nBlair couldn't believe that Elijah could ever be anything like Ross.  Elijah wasn't so sure, and recounted how Danielle hadn't wanted to return to Llanview after finding her foster dad alive in Tahiti; if not for Ross's insistence, Danielle would never have gone back to the States and grown close to Todd at all.  As Blair prepared to take a shower, she reminded Elijah that they needed to head back to Llanview immediately after their morning wedding, and said she wanted to be there for Danielle in her time of need.  Elijah promised her they'd take the first flight back.\n\n\nAs Blair headed for the shower, Elijah quietly produced a pistol from a concealed ankle holster and placed it in his briefcase, along with a copy of T\u00e9a's last will and testament.  Just then, his phone rang.  It was Greg, calling with bad news: T\u00e9a wanted Todd and Danielle to join her at the hospice.\n\n\nHeading outside the cottage, Elijah hoped to conceal from Blair that he'd disabled her phone.  Speaking in hushed tones, he ordered Greg to talk T\u00e9a out of her change of heart.  \"You know the woman!\" Greg said, exasperated.\n\n\nElijah warned Greg that if Todd and Danielle found T\u00e9a, \"it's over for us.\"  \"It's already over for me, Eli,\" Greg replied, and said he'd taken a Hippocratic Oath to \"first do no harm\" -- he felt that keeping T\u00e9a from her family was wrong.  Elijah said that Todd and Danielle would do T\u00e9a harm, and told Greg not to \"grow a conscience\" when their plans were so close to reaching fruition.  He'd thought he was backed up against the wall, as well, but explained to Greg how the random goons who'd abducted \"the guy next to me\" at the wedding had helped him escape Llanview and evade the police.  Elijah told Greg that his random luck and flight from justice was a sign, and that if they kept Todd and Danielle away from T\u00e9a, they'd both get what they wanted.\n\n\nElijah warned Greg that if he were caught, he wouldn't go down alone, and promised the police would hear all about Greg's involvement in his scheme before he headed to prison.  Just then, Blair stepped outside, and asked Elijah why he was talking about going to prison.  Hanging up on Greg, Ross claimed he'd caught a local call from Ross, and that they'd been joking about his brother's shady record and Kelly's wild accusations.  Embracing Elijah, Blair reminded him that Kelly was a thousand miles away, and they were finally alone together.  As Elijah escorted her back inside the cottage, he told Blair that nothing would get in their way anymore -- he wouldn't let it.\n\n\nAt the hospice, Greg returned to T\u00e9a's room and lied that Todd and Danielle were on their way.  He injected T\u00e9a with a drug and said it was something that would help her sleep.  T\u00e9a asked if her family would be there when she woke, and Greg cryptically replied that Todd and Danielle were likely to be the first faces she saw.  T\u00e9a thanked him for his help, and Greg told her to sleep well.  As T\u00e9a curled up under a blanket, she asked Greg to send Todd and Danielle to her safely, and soon.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, in the bridal cabana at the country club, Langston rushed to comfort the brokenhearted Dorian, who was curled up on the floor.  Dorian told Langston to go away, but Langston refused to leave her foster mother's side.  There was a knock at the door, and Langston assumed it was David, but Dorian was sure it wasn't -- \"David is not here.\"  She insisted Langston leave and take the visitor with her, as she didn't want anyone seeing her in such a state.\n\n\nThe knocking continued, and Langston asked who it was.  When Viki responded, Langston said she'd get rid of her, but Dorian asked the teen to let Viki in.  Langston helped Dorian fix her makeup and wipe her tears, then opened the door and left Viki and Dorian alone together.  Surveying the wrecked room, Viki told Dorian she was so sorry.  \"You should be,\" Dorian replied softly, her face frozen in a wan smile. \"This is all your fault.  You spiteful bitch.\"\n\n\nPicking up the scattered furniture and pillows, Viki asked how Dorian's wedding fiasco was her fault.  Dorian explained that Viki and Charlie were responsible for her and David reuniting.  \"I knew better,\" she said. \"I was through with the man.  I knew if I ever gave him a second chance, he'd hurt me again.\"  \"See, I don't think that David did this,\" Viki replied, but Dorian insisted that David's latest failure was right on schedule with Viki's \"plan.\"  \"I'm running this town,\" Dorian murmured in a shaky voice. \"I'm the mayor.  I'm doing good things.  People look up to me.  I was a happy, strong woman...and you couldn't stand to see that.\"\n\n\nViki said that Dorian was wrong about her, but Dorian couldn't get over the fact that Viki had pushed her and David back together despite David's past history -- thanks to Viki, he'd left her at the altar not once, but twice.  Viki couldn't believe that was the case, and said she thought something had happened to David; she knew he loved Dorian more than anything.\n\n\nRetrieving the letter Nora had given her, Dorian read it aloud to Viki.  In it, David told her that he couldn't marry her because he couldn't commit to one woman \"'til death do us part,\" and that it wasn't her fault, but his.  He signed off with \"lotsa love.\"  \"The man makes himself very clear,\" Dorian spat.\n\n\nViki remained skeptical that David had written the letter, and asked if it was in his handwriting.  \"It's his spelling,\" Dorian replied, noting David's many typos.  She suggested Viki gloat and bask in her misery, but Viki told Dorian that she was terribly sad for both Dorian and David- - she was sure that even if David had left Dorian, he'd regret it, because he loved Dorian and always would.  \"So what?\" Dorian asked, her voice choked with bitterness. \"It doesn't matter because he doesn't love me enough.  He doesn't love me enough to make a commitment to me -- me!  And that is all that matters.  David will always be the man who did not love me enough.\"\n\n\nAs Dorian attempted to fix her lipstick in the cabana mirror, Viki promised her that she'd eventually learn the truth behind David's sudden disappearing act, but Dorian insisted it didn't matter.  Viki asked her what she was going to do next, and Dorian half-joked that she'd move into the cabana for good to avoid the ensuing public ridicule of her latest rejection at the altar.  Viki told Dorian she had no reason to hide: \"You are Dorian Cramer...Lord, and you can walk out of here with your head held high.\"\n\n\nViki reminded Dorian of what she'd told Viki after Viki had put her own heart on the line to reunite with Clint, only for him to marry Lindsay Rappaport.  \"Yes, that was humiliating,\" Dorian burbled, but Viki cut to the heart of the issue -- back then, Dorian had told her that the important thing had been that Viki had learned to trust again, and give her whole heart, and that in itself was a victory.  \"So you can hold your head up,\" Viki explained, \"because you are the strongest, toughest, bravest person that I know.\"  Touched, Dorian gave Viki a weak smile.\n\n\nViki told \"Mayor Lord\" that it was time for her to go out and face the world.  She told Dorian that she'd sent the guests home, and would help her get a clear path to her car.  Struggling to collect herself, Dorian thanked her archrival for the help.  \"Anytime,\" Viki replied, and exited the cabana.\n\n\nAlone in the cabana, Dorian began to rend and tear her wedding bouquet. \"David Vickers can rot in hell for all I care,\" she hissed to herself. \"I never want to see that man again.\"\n\n\nIn a darkened and forbidding prison, a bruised and battered David was dragged into a grimy cell by a pair of burly goons in uniform.  Alone in his cell, he warned the men that they'd made a big mistake by trifling with the son of the police commissioner.  The head guard approached the cell and told David that his father couldn't help him \"there.  David asked where there was, and the guard replied that they were on the other side of the world from Llanview.\n\n\nDavid pleaded with the guard to tell him where he was, and the guard told David he'd been there before -- \"think back.\"  Taking a few steps backward, David examined the cell, and a horrifying realization struck him.  \"Oh, no,\" he moaned. \"Not again!  I'm in Morocco!\"  The head guard laughed and walked away.\n\n\nScreaming at the unseen guards, David told them that his fianc\u00e9e was the mayor, who loved him and would find him.  \"Dorian knows there's no reason I'd ever leave her at the altar again,\" he reasoned to himself.  He told the men in the shadows that they couldn't keep him prisoner, because he knew people -- \"Hell, I am people!  I'm a Buchanan!\"  He warned them that Bo would bring the might of the Buchanan empire down upon them, and wondered who would dare go against the family by taking him hostage.\n\n\nWhen the head guard returned, David warned him to \"hold the couscous,\" because when Dorian and Bo found out what had happened to him, all his captors' days were numbered.  \"Nobody comes for you, Vickers,\" the guard replied, stalking off, as David insisted his last name was Buchanan.\n\n\n\"I gotta get back to my bride!\" David howled into the darkness.  He feared that Dorian was crying her eyes out, worried sick about him.  Sinking onto the bench of his cell, he bemoaned how his jailers had forced him to leave Dorian again.  Hearing footsteps in the corridor, David rushed to the cell doors, and begged the figure stepping out of the shadows to help him make a phone call to Dorian.  When he saw the identity of the person behind the bars, his eyes went wide: \"You?\"\n\n\nBack in Llanview, in the country club courtyard, Starr and Cole waited for word on Dorian as James lounged in the rows of empty chairs, texting away.  Cole was anxious to head home and relieve Hope's babysitter, but Starr insisted on waiting for Dorian or Langston.  As she spoke, she seemed to keep one eye on James.\n\n\nLangston entered the courtyard and told her friends that Viki was with Dorian.  Cole assured Starr that Dorian would be fine and suggested they leave, but James sauntered up and told the teens he had a better idea -- he wanted to take advantage of the club's amenities and have a good time.  Cole immediately shut him down and said that he and Starr were leaving, and Langston told James she was tired and not in the mood.  Just then, Ford entered the courtyard, and Langston's train of thought ground to a screeching halt.\n\n\nJames asked Ford where he'd been.  Langston assumed Ford had been with his latest conquest, but Ford replied that he'd been in police custody and that it was a long story.  He asked why James was out with Ford's ex yet again, and Langston gloated that James had been her \"plus one\" at not one but two aborted weddings.\n\n\nFord was relieved to hear that Elijah and Blair had disappeared to parts unknown, and asked James to accompany him back to their apartment.  Before James could get a word in edgewise, Langston told Ford that she and James were about to hit the pool.  Calling her bluff, Ford said that he was up for a swim as well.\n\n\nNear the pool area, Nate continued his rounds with Danielle by his side.  Danielle told him that Todd was still searching for T\u00e9a, and asked if he'd seen Shaun.  She was sure that Shaun knew where her mother was and wanted to help, but wouldn't talk.  She despaired at her dwindling chances of finding T\u00e9a still alive.  \"For all I know, my mom's already gone,\" Danielle whispered.\n\n\nNate kissed Danielle's forehead and offered to drive her home.  Before they could leave, however, Ford, James, and Langston burst onto the scene, ready to take a dip.  Langston began to make introductions, and asked James if he knew Nate.  \"No,\" Ford shot back. \"He's our brother.\"\n\n\nTaking the revelation in stride, Langston focused on needling Ford; she told Nate that James was her guest, but Ford wasn't a club member, and suggested Nate eject the elder Ford from the premises.  Nate refused to get involved, and told the trio to enjoy themselves.  Langston sneered that Ford still couldn't enjoy the pool, since he had no suit.  In response, Ford promptly began to strip.  \"Let's get outta here,\" Nate told Danielle, and the young couple hurried away.\n\n\nBack in the courtyard, Cole asked Starr why she insisted on staying at the club with Dorian being looked after.  Starr said she'd get a ride home from Dorian's driver, and claimed that it was Langston she wanted to watch over.  She told Cole she feared that Ford would hurt Langston again if Starr weren't there to watch her friend's back.\n\n\nCole told Starr he did want to go out and have fun, and Starr promised him they'd have time alone soon.  Cole kissed her goodbye, and told her Langston was lucky to have Starr looking out for her.  As Cole left, Starr murmured that she wasn't sure Langston saw things the same way.\n\n\nIn the pool area, Langston had stripped to her bikini, taunting Ford as she asked James to help her adjust her straps.  James was flustered, but when Langston noticed Ford's eyes on her, she planted a passionate kiss on the younger Ford brother.  Infuriated, Ford launched himself into the pool with a yell.  Starr entered the pool area just in time to see Langston and James making out.  Mortified, she loudly cleared her throat, and Langston pulled away from James.\n\n\nJames removed his bullet necklace, and asked Starr to hold onto it while he and Langston swam.  \"Reminds me of you,\" he told her with a smile, then dashed into the water with Langston on his arm, leaving Starr alone and confused.\n\n\nAs Langston and the Fords emerged from the pool, Starr gave James back his necklace.  After an intense moment passed between them, she hurried away to check on Dorian.  Meanwhile, Ford put the moves on Langston, urging her to drop the act and leave James alone.  Turning cold, Langston told Ford it was no act; he'd had his chance with her and blown it.  As she headed away with James to find a snack, she alerted one of the club staff to the fact that Ford wasn't a member.\n\n\nAt Todd's, Shaun was bound and gagged to a chair with duct tape.  As Todd tore off Shaun's blindfold and gag, he ordered Shaun to reveal where T\u00e9a was.  \"I can't help you,\" Shaun muttered.  Todd said he knew Shaun and Greg knew T\u00e9a's whereabouts, because Todd noticed Greg's leave of absence from the hospital; he asked if the Evans brothers were splitting T\u00e9a's payment.  Shaun said he hadn't helped T\u00e9a for money, but because he genuinely liked her and cared about her.\n\n\nShaun explained that T\u00e9a had only wished to be left alone in peace in her final days.  Todd replied that he, too, had one wish, but warned Shaun that if his was not granted, five large men were waiting outside with pliers to give Shaun an extreme manicure.  \"Go to hell,\" Shaun spat, and said he could handle Todd's goons, because he didn't go back on his word.\n\n\nAs Todd left to summon his minions, Shaun broke free from his bonds.  When Todd returned to the living room, Shaun confronted him at the door, thoroughly put out.  \"Don't ever try to hold me down,\" he growled, advancing on Todd.  He asked if Todd was enough of an ass to deny a dying woman's last wish.  \"Yes!\" Todd replied, and blithely admitted that he often thought he was the last thing T\u00e9a would ever want to see before departing the earthly plane.\n\n\nWhile Todd cowered from his former bodyguard's massive frame, Shaun turned on his heel and stalked into the foyer, warning Todd to leave him alone.  Undaunted, Todd pursued him, and asked Shaun to forget about him and think of Danielle's need to say goodbye to T\u00e9a.  He knew how much Shaun's family had done to help him during his coma the year before, and how their love and support had helped him back from the brink, and asked Shaun if Danielle didn't deserve the same chance to be there for her mother.\n\n\nOutside, Nate escorted Danielle to the front door.  He asked her to call him with any news on her search for T\u00e9a, and gave her a kiss and a hug.\n\n\nInside, Todd and Shaun had reached an impasse, but their silence was broken as Danielle entered the house.  Danielle asked the big man if he was there to help her find her mother, and before Shaun could speak, Todd told her that Shaun indeed knew where T\u00e9a was.  Overjoyed, Danielle embraced Shaun, babbling about how great he was and how she'd known he would help her find T\u00e9a.  Stymied, Shaun told Danielle he wasn't sure of T\u00e9a's condition, but he'd take her to her mother just the same.\n\n\nAs Danielle rushed into the foyer, Todd stopped Shaun and thanked him for his help.  \"I didn't do this for you,\" Shaun snapped, but Todd thanked him anyway, for Danielle.  \"Let's go,\" Shaun said, leading Todd and Danielle out the front door. \n\n\n",
