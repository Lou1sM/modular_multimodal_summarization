Bo told Matthew that he loved his son, and that he'd see Matthew the next day. As he hung up the phone, there was a knock on Bo's office door. David burst through the door, and said that he had good news and bad news. Bo didn't want any bad news, but David told Bo anyway. He revealed that he was leaving town.\n\n\nA short while later, Bo congratulated David on his movie role. He thought that David deserved the break. David gave Bo the credit, and said that finding out he was Bo's son had made him want to aim higher in life. David apologized that he would be gone for months with Matthew in his condition. Bo wanted David to go for the opportunity, and said that he would miss his son.\n\n\nBo tried to imagine Dorian as a senator. \"She'll be the next Hillary, minus the cheating husband,\" David illustrated. David could picture Dorian getting to the White House, and Bo marveled at the fact that David could be \"the first husband.\" David was supposed to be leaving, but he couldn't get a hold of Dorian. She was apparently saying goodbye to the most important person in her life. David tried to think of who that could be, if it wasn't him, or Dorian's hairdresser.\n\n\nDavid tried to call Dorian, and was concerned that she hadn't answered. He wanted to check on her, but Bo assured his son that Dorian was crazy about him. There was a knock on the door, and an officer entered. He needed Bo for \"a situation.\" David was happy that his \"pa\" was saving the day. He told Bo that he would be channeling his father onscreen. David told Bo that, by the time David returned, Matthew would be applying to colleges. Bo hoped so, and told David to stay in touch. David promised that he \"tweeted\" every thirty minutes, so Bo wouldn't even know that David was gone.\n\n\nNatalie gave John the tape recorder, and John wondered what Madame Delphina had said about it. She replied that Delphina had said that what had been on the tape had the potential to change lives. Delphina had also said that Victor apparently knew what had been on the tape. However, Brody had convinced Natalie it didn't matter, because Liam was safe, and Victor probably wouldn't give Natalie a straight answer anyway. John felt bad for Victor, because someone he should have been able to trust more than anyone had lied to him. \"Kind of like I did to you,\" Natalie replied.\n\n\nJohn assured Natalie that what had happened between them was in the past. Natalie hoped that John could one day forgive her. \"Done,\" he said. Natalie walked away to sit at her desk, and John followed her. He told her that he'd seen Kelly before she and Joey had left, and she'd given him some good advice.\n\n\nNatalie's phone rang, and she took the call. She wrote down an address, and told the person on the other end that she and Brody would be there. John looked disappointed as Natalie hung up the phone. She apologized, and asked John what he was saying about Kelly giving him advice. He replied that Kelly had advised him to go after what he wanted in life. He was pleased to see that Natalie seemed to be doing just that. He wished her luck, and walked away.\n\n\nVictor looked around his office at the Sun. He picked up his \"Todd Manning\" nameplate. He threw the nameplate towards the door, as Brody entered. Brody picked up the nameplate, and said that he wasn't sure he'd find Victor there. He continued that it was Todd's office, and Victor was not Todd. However, Victor was \"the man I want to see,\" Brody stated.\n\n\nThe secretary entered and asked Victor if he needed anything. Victor wanted her to lead Brody out of his office, but Brody insisted that he was there on police business. The secretary left, and Brody wondered how long it would take for the employees at the Sun to find out that Victor wasn't Todd. However, Brody was there to talk about his life with Natalie and Liam, and the information Marty had given Victor about Liam.\n\n\nVictor thought the information had more to do with John than with Brody, and wondered how Brody had found out that Victor knew. Brody believed that the only thing that mattered was that Victor kept the information to himself. Recognizing that Brody was threatening him, Victor warned Brody that secrets didn't stay secret very long in Llanview. Victor admitted to getting satisfaction from seeing John \"moping around town, oblivious.\" Brody was glad that Victor had agreed not to say anything, but Victor reminded Brody that he hadn't agreed to anything.\n\n\nBrody wanted Victor's word. He pleaded that he was the only father Liam had known. They loved each other, and they were finally a real family with Natalie. Victor understood about finding out that his kids weren't really his. However, the difference was that Victor had actually believed the kids were his, whereas Brody knew that Liam wasn't his. Brody wondered when Victor had grown a conscience. \"When I found out my life is a lie,\" Victor replied. He didn't feel like keeping secrets anymore, because he believed that keeping secrets would make him as bad as Irene. He believed that John deserved to know the truth.\n\n\nBrody reminded Victor that Victor had lost his kids because of John. He told Victor that if he did anything to destroy Brody's family, Victor was a dead man. The secretary entered, and announced the arrival of the web designer that Victor was supposed to meet with. Victor asked if Brody was done. \"As long as we're clear,\" Brody said. He reminded Victor that if Victor said a word to anyone, Brody would make him regret it. When Brody was gone, Victor looked at the paper with Liam's paternity test results. He scrolled through the address book on his phone, and stopped on John's number.\n\n\nBrody arrived at the station a short while later, and saw John carrying the tape recorder. John explained that Delphina hadn't known what had been on the tape, but she had disclosed that Victor knew. John wanted to talk to Victor about it, but Brody revealed that he already had. Brody lied that Victor had no idea what Brody had been talking about.\n\n\n\"Lookin' pretty good, cowboy,\" Kim told Clint. Clint, ecstatic to see her, wondered why she was there. She replied that she wouldn't want to be anywhere else, since she'd heard that he'd almost died. Clint replied that he'd known she'd left because David had been blackmailing her. He wondered what David had on her, because even his best private investigators hadn't been able to figure it out. He continued that he could have helped her out.\n\n\nClint wondered if Kim was in trouble. She answered that she couldn't imagine a world without Clint. He said that his doctors believed he would be all right. He asked where she'd been. \"Same old, same old,\" she replied. He realized that she'd been stripping. Kim noticed his ankle monitor, and related that both of them had clearly been up to things they hadn't been proud of.\n\n\nKim wondered how things were between Clint and Rex. Clint told her that he'd seen Rex earlier to honor Asa on the anniversary of his death. Kim was disgusted that Rex had basically made Clint pay for Gigi's heart. She thought that Clint should be in his own home, but Clint thought that there were perks to living at Llanfair. Kim inquired if he and Viki were back together. He admired her for getting right to the point, but assured her that he was only there because Viki had taken pity on him.\n\n\nKim had needed to see for herself that Clint was all right. She'd missed him, and wanted to make sure that he was being taken care of. He asked again why she was there, because he didn't believe her reason. As she was about to answer, Natalie entered the room. Angry to see Kim, Natalie pushed her out the door, calling her a slew of offensive names.\n\n\nDorian was surprised to see Viki at her office door, and wondered what she wanted. Viki had heard about Dorian's new job, and had wanted to say goodbye. Dorian had thought that Viki hated her after it had been revealed that Dorian had been responsible for Clint's condition. They argued about Clint, and the punishment he'd deserved for his various crimes. Dorian slammed her office doors shut so no one would hear the yelling. Viki related that the family had accepted him into Llanfair because they had forgiven him. \"I have not, and I will not,\" Dorian stated, and called Clint a \"cruel, heartless bastard.\"\n\n\nViki understood Dorian's feelings, and wished her well in Washington. Viki walked over to the doors to leave, but couldn't open them. She informed Dorian that the doors were jammed shut, after Dorian had \"theatrically slammed\" them. Dorian attempted to open the doors, but failed. She couldn't believe that they were trapped in the room together, and banged on the doors, yelling for help. Dorian wondered if Viki was playing a practical joke, but realized that Viki was \"challenged in the humor department.\"\n\n\nViki and Dorian banged on the walls, yelling for help. Dorian remembered that everyone in the building had already left for the day. Viki knew that her cell phone was in the car, so she told Dorian to use hers. After looking, Dorian realized that her phone was in her car as well. Viki picked up the office phone, but found that there was no dial tone. Dorian informed her that a security code was needed to use the phone, but she didn't know it.\n\n\nDorian had no way to reach her private security guard, because he was in the car, waiting for her. Defeated, she remembered telling the guard that she had a lot to do, so she could be a while. Viki sat, and said that they appeared to be trapped again. Dorian was horrified as Viki began to laugh.\n\n\nViki marveled at how many times before that she'd been trapped in a room with Dorian. Dorian thought it was only fitting for \"one more go-round\" with her nemesis. Viki thought that she was more like Dorian's \"frenemy.\" Dorian believed that Viki would be \"bored to tears without me.\" However, Viki promised to watch over Dorian on the televised Senate proceedings.\n\n\nViki genuinely apologized for all the times that she'd caused Dorian pain. \"You are my friend, and I love you,\" Viki said. Dorian was angry at Viki for saying so, because she'd wanted to be the bigger person. Viki said that she'd miss Dorian. \"I know I'm going to miss you,\" Dorian replied. She got two glasses of leftover champagne, but Viki reminded Dorian that Viki couldn't drink. \"One sip won't kill you,\" Dorian said, and handed her the glass.\n\n\n\"To us,\" Dorian toasted. She couldn't imagine life without Viki, and Viki agreed that she couldn't imagine life or Llanview without Dorian. Both women agreed that neither would be the same without the other. Viki started to grow teary-eyed, but Dorian stopped her. They reminisced about all of the times they'd been trapped together, and all of the good times and bad times throughout the years. The women clinked their glasses together, and shared a hug.\n\n\nJust then, David burst through the doors. He was shocked that Dorian was hugging his best friend. Dorian told him that Viki was her \"very good friend.\" However, David refused to let Dorian \"have her.\" He told Dorian that the car was waiting. He promised to email Viki from Stockholm. Viki hugged David, and he vowed that he'd get a star on the sidewalk in Los Angeles. Viki only asked that David take her calls. As Viki began to cry, Dorian and David left.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Viki goes to say good by to Dorian and wish her well. At first they argue and both appear to be glad to be rid of each other. Viki blames Dorian for almost having Clint killed. Dorian tells Viki she is very disappointed in Viki giving Clint a free pass after all the crimes he's committed and what he did to David by letting Clint stay in her home with all the luxuries. And right when they are ready to happily part company, they get locked in a room together. At that point we relive their long history together. And they declare that they are enemies but also dear friends with how each has stepped up to help the other with many things. Brody goes to confront Todd and warns him that he better not reveal that John is Liam's father and ruin Brody's future with Natalie or Todd will be sorry. Meanwhile, Kimberly comes to see Clint and he wonders why she'd contact him unless she's in trouble and needs something. John is ready to take Kelly's advice and reach out to Natalie but decides not to do it when he sees she is serious about moving in with Brody and having a future with him.",
