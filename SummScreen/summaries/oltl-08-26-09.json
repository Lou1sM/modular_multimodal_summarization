    "soap_central": "\n The Real Buchanans of Llantano County \n\n\nAs Starr and Langston lounged around the pool at La Boulaie, the girls talked about going back to school in September. Starr made a startling declaration, informing her best friend that she would not be returning to school. She wanted to stay home and take care of Hope, since she had already missed out on so much of her baby's life. Mortified, Langston stressed that there was a waiting list of babysitters at La Boulaie and nothing could be worse than Starr giving up her own life.\n\n\nCole was disturbed when Sergei showed up at the rehabilitation center, and wondered why the man seemed to be following him. He didn't feel that it was necessary for every minute of his life to be accounted for, Cole retorted to his boss. Demanding to know why Cole was with the authorities, Cole informed the man that he wanted to stay clean and needed to put on a good show for his mother's boyfriend, who was a cop. Sergei wanted a list of Cole's customers, but Cole felt that he wouldn't be needed if he provided that. Sergei advised him that he wasn't needed, and if he had nothing to hide, he shouldn't be worried about being followed.\n\n\nT\u00e9a vehemently objected to Elijah's line of questioning regarding Matthew's judgment making. The judge allowed Elijah to continue as he pursued the reasons for Matthew being in the wheelchair.\n\n\nJessica visited Brody at Rodi's and confided that she was probably hallucinating all of the signs she had been spotting of Nash's return from the dead. No one knew about the \"heart thing\" except herself and Nash. Brody explained that he had managed to spot the heart drawn on the glass door, and rebuked the notion that Jessica herself had put it there. He had managed to lift a fingerprint, he explained, and her visions were real. He suggested that perhaps someone had seen her draw the heart on her baby's casket at the cemetery.\n\n\nAs Jared and Natalie showed Clint the DVD they had mysteriously received showing Nash's death, Nigel was busy attempting to keep David Vickers and his film crew from entering the premises. As David narrated his latest foray into the world of reality, Ford felt that it wasn't working. Ford complained  that he was promised crazy rich people. David soothed his associate, explaining that he had needed to offer the \"shots of fame\" to Dorian and Viki first, but his family was just as interesting.\n\n\nHe proceeded to fill Ford in on his relatives like the cowboy, the madam of a brothel, and his own brother, who was the \"Tiny Tim of Llanview High.\" Priscilla began to tickle Nigel in order to sidetrack him and she succeeded, allowing David and company to pass through. Bursting into the room where Clint, Natalie, and Jared were deep in conversation, Nigel attempted to explain. As Clint ordered the camera crew out, he went out to have a chat with Nigel. David turned his sights on Jared and Natalie.\n\n\nFacing the camera to narrate, full of explanations for his audience, he commenced. \"Cousin Natalie, former trailer trash and a pool hall hustler, and now the dainty flower of Buchanan house. Like Natalie, I came to the Buchanan family picnic late,\" David added. As Jared pushed David away, calling him a freak, David spoke to his audience again. \"Speaking of freaks...\" he pointed to Jared. David commented on the man who posed as Natalie's uncle and was someone who could be violent, pushing Natalie's sister's husband to his death. Markko continued to film in his new role and part-time job as cameraman.\n\n\nReturning to the room, Clint yelled that everyone knew that Nash's death had been an accident. Suddenly, Clint had a thought and wondered out loud if David had been the one to send the DVD with pictures. Natalie found it strange that the pictures had turned up the same day as David. As David began to pursue a new angle, Jared pushed David, and Clint punched David in the face. Landing on the floor, David remembered to turn to the camera. \"And that's how we roll. We're the real Buchanans of Llantano County.\"\n\n\nClint advised Jared and Natalie to warn Jessica about the existence of the recently received pictures. On her way out, Natalie advised Markko to be careful. She understood his predicament of needing a good paying job.\n\n\nJessica paid a surprise visit to Madame Delphina, who acknowledged feeling another presence from the \"other side,\" besides Asa, during the night the family celebrated at the lodge. Jessica expressed her belief that she had seen signs that Nash was around. Delphina offered to contact Nash, noting she was \"running a recession special on s\u00e9ances.\" While Jessica contended that she didn't believe in ghosts, Delphina explained that spirits returned to check on their loved ones.\n\n\nFinished with scheduling, Langston informed Starr that she had signed Starr up for classes, but had kept the school day to a minimum. Starr seemed to be full of additional excuses, and Langston sensed that something else was wrong. Starr admitted that she was concerned about Cole and his community service, and couldn't wait for it to be over. She confided that she was unable to disclose any other information to Langston.\n\n\nSergei was confused over a book he found in Cole's possession, and the young man explained that he needed to obtain his GED, head to college, and make more money. He felt that it would be profitable to sell drugs to all of the incoming freshman, and he wanted more business. Sergei offered to help him, and made veiled threats towards Cole's family again. Once he left Cole, Sergei made a call to someone about a shipment. Cole eavesdropped behind the office door.\n\n\nAs Elijah continued his attack on Matthew, Destiny stood up and shouted that it was all the fault of Becca and Justin. She was ordered to sit, and Elijah picked up from where he left off. Citing the fact that Cole was on drugs, Matthew stood up for his friend, informing the court that Cole had tried to toss him from the car. This brought Elijah back to Matthew's poor judgment and how he not only stayed in the car, but didn't have his seatbelt on. Matthew pointed out that everyone made mistakes, including his parents. Elijah suggested that Matthew's next decision might put him in the ground.\n\n\nT\u00e9a resumed questioning and the courtroom was enlightened on Matthew's newly found decision-making skills. He explained that he fully researched any aspect that had to do with his possible surgery, including the doctor and the doctor's former patients. He had done extensive investigation on the Internet. With Matthew finished, the court was adjourned for the day. Bo and Nora were not happy with Elijah's attacks on their son, but their attorney felt that T\u00e9a and Matthew weren't above playing dirty. T\u00e9a felt confident that she had won. She ripped up the paper that Elijah gave her regarding her past.\n\n\nDavid insisted that he was waiting for his father, Bo, to arrive home. When he learned that Bo no longer lived there, and that Nora was married to Clint, his new attack on the family began, comprehensively clarified for a prospective audience. He accused Clint of stealing his father's love by marrying Nora. David went on about brother versus brother. When Clint had enough, he tried to choke David. He refused to sign a release form, but then changed his mind. He felt it would be good viewing because he was planning to kill David on camera. Leaving the room but hastily returning, Clint pointed a gun at David.\n\n\nNatalie and Jared rushed into Rodi's to see Jessica, but Brody informed them that she had gone to Bree's school. He asked them if they had noticed anything strange at Llanfair. He was of the opinion that Jessica had a stalker, he advised them. Jared and Natalie mentioned there was a picture of someone on the security camera taken at Buchanan Enterprises.\n\n\nCole made a quick phone call to Starr. Sergei made another phone call, suggesting that Cole sell drugs to freshman at Llanview University. He told the unseen person that it was his idea. He said that so far, Cole checked out, but something about him \"put a bug in my ear.\" He was of the opinion that Cole was eager to \"move up.\"\n\n\nAs Bo, Nora, and Matthew arrived at the mansion, Bo suggested they talk about what Matthew had said while on the stand. He told Matthew that he wanted to tell Clint about the kiss if Matthew planned on using it against them. As they walked into the house, the first thing they saw was Clint's gun trained on David. Clint demanded that David turn over all footage that had been filmed. \"My dad's here,\" David exclaimed when he saw Bo.\n\n\nAs the s\u00e9ance began, the doors flew open. \"Nash, is that you?\" Jessica asked.\n\n\n",
