    "soap_central": "\n\nHeld in a Moroccan prison, David was confused but happy to see Clint standing on the other side of the bars. \"Peace be upon you,\" Clint said in Arabic and then English. He urged David to learn it because peace would be scarce behind bars. David reflected on a movie he had seen called Midnight Express because he thought the entire scenario reminded him of the film. Clint noted that there had been a big escape in the film, but there would be no escaping the Moroccan jail cell.\n\n\nDavid believed Dorian to be worried about him, and he was sure she would be desperate enough to search him out. Clint laughed that Dorian wouldn't be worried. That was because David had dumped her again. Clint handed David a copy of the same letter that had been left behind for Dorian and called it \"vintage Vickers.\" David admitted it was his handwriting, but he hadn't written it. Clint pointed out that Dorian wouldn't know that, because Clint had hired a professional to write the letter. David understood that it had been Clint who had kidnapped him.\n\n\nClint hoped that Dorian would realize that David loved himself the most. He thought that the Cramer women always made the same mistakes with the same men. Clint revealed that he'd had David imprisoned because David had sent away the woman Clint had loved. David pleaded to be let out, and he offered to help Clint find Kimberly. Clint wanted revenge, and he was joyful that David would lose Dorian.\n\n\nHe also advised David that he would never share in Asa's fortune, especially with Dorian by his side. Dorian had stolen Clint's company, and Clint held her responsible for his son-in-law's death. Clint had asked the Moroccan authorities for David's old cell, and they had been happy to oblige. David would be imprisoned for 20 years, Clint rejoiced.\n\n\nDavid was dumbfounded and accused Clint of being worse than Asa ever was. Clint proclaimed that he was his father's son. \"Get used to it,\" he growled. David said he was the same to Bo, and Bo wouldn't let him rot in prison. Clint wondered who would tell Bo that David was in jail, and David replied that Bo would know. Clint retorted that Bo was aware that David was a loser who always took the easy way out. David's MyFace status would reflect that, he added. David couldn't believe his page had been hacked, and Clint told him there would be proof of David with other women.\n\n\nClint advised David he'd be freed in 2030, and he should stay away from Llanview. He repeated his earlier phrase, \"peace be upon you.\" David vowed to \"kick [Clint's] ass\" in order to get back to Dorian. \"As God is my witness,\" he stated. Clint crumbled the letter and tossed it into the cell before he left.\n\n\nAs darkness fell, Dorian re-read David's letter as she remained in the country club cabana. She crumpled it up and tossed it on the floor as Langston walked in. Dorian wanted her daughter to stop feeling sorry for her. Langston stooped to retrieve the letter, and hid it behind her back. Dorian was certain that David would never return. Outside, Starr called for a car and told James that she thought he should leave the property. James wanted to thank Langston for inviting him to the wedding.\n\n\nJust then, Langston emerged from the cabana. James thanked her and asked to see her again. Langston agreed. Starr mentioned that the Cramer household wasn't exactly a \"man-friendly zone.\" After James left, the girls put their arms around Dorian protectively as she hid behind a pair of sunglasses. The coast was clear for her to leave.\n\n\nAt the police station, John told Brody and Natalie about the events at the country club and sent them to the premises to look for clues in the disappearance of Blair and Eli. Marty arrived to see John as the pair left. Brody thought that things seemed pretty good between Marty and Natalie. \"Ya think?\" Natalie retorted. She suggested he \"rethink the whole detective thing.\" Inside of John's office, John told Marty that Hannah had not been her attacker and was innocent. Cole walked in and heard what John had to say. John was annoyed, because he had asked Cole to wait outside.\n\n\nCole had known all along that Hannah was innocent, he proclaimed. John revealed that Eli had forced Hannah to swallow the pills, and Cole turned to rush out the door. John stopped him first. He wanted Cole to understand that the police were looking for Eli and Blair, and he didn't want Cole to say anything to Starr. He couldn't have the Cramers involved yet, and he wanted Cole's word. There was a reason he had asked Cole to wait outside. Cole promised to stay mum, and he left.\n\n\nMarty insisted she was fine, but John knew better. Marty thought maybe the truth would help her to heal. John wrapped his arm around her as they sat side-by-side. John wasn't certain about Eli's motive, but he thought it might have been Eli's way of getting John off of another case when John got too close to finding out about Eli. John blamed himself for not realizing it sooner, but Marty told him he couldn't be responsible for everything bad that happened. She had tried to make him see that before, but maybe Natalie would have more success. John took a deep breath and told Marty that Natalie was pregnant.\n\n\nFord arrived home to find Jessica sitting in his apartment. \"Go home,\" he told her, not understanding how she even got into his apartment in the first place. He claimed to be expecting visitors. Jessica insisted that she needed information from Ford. She wanted to know about his Rh factor, because there was a small chance that he was her baby's father. Her baby could be in danger, and she had lost a baby previously due to the incompatibility of the Rh factor. Ford was visibly concerned, and he grabbed a folder that contained several papers.\n\n\nHe perused them quickly and advised her he was Rh positive. Jessica was comforted since she knew she would be able to protect her baby with that information. James returned as Jessica left. He cited his brother's ability to not waste time. Ford displayed his annoyance at James for borrowing his jacket for the wedding without asking first. James accused Ford of being touchy because the blonde girl had rejected him, though Ford made it clear that he didn't plan on spending any more time with the woman, especially if he didn't want an STD. James joked that Ford probably had a clinic on speed dial, but Ford wasn't laughing.\n\n\nHe demanded that James give him half of the rent money. James protested that Ford had promised to take care of him after deserting him, but Ford announced that he had changed his mind. He didn't appreciate James taking things that weren't his. James asked if Ford meant Langston, but Ford asked James for cash instead. James wanted Ford to admit if he didn't want James dating Langston. Ford obliged and stated that he didn't want James to go out with Langston.\n\n\nJames made fun of his brother and accused him of caring about Langston after all. Ford defended his request and pronounced that they shouldn't be dating each other's ex-girlfriends. James agreed not to ask Langston out, but he didn't think it meant that Langston would return to his brother. Ford wanted to discuss James's future, and he suggested that James take the GED in order to attend college. James realized that Langston attended Llanview University.\n\n\nBrody and Natalie proceeded to do some forensics work in the cabana. Brody wondered about Jessica's doctor's appointment, and Natalie advised him she had been there for hers at the same time. All had gone well, she told him. She reiterated that he was not the father of Natalie's baby because John was, and she had written John's name down on the doctor's form. As Natalie continued searching for clues, Brody suggested that she was taking a long time in order to avoid Marty at the station. Judging by Natalie's reaction, Brody announced that his detective skills were excellent.\n\n\nNatalie explained that she hadn't seen Marty since the night Marty had taken the letter that Natalie had left for John. It was also the night Natalie had gotten drunk and slept with Brody. She blamed the chain of events on Marty, and she knew things wouldn't get any easier when Marty found out that Natalie was pregnant. Natalie recapped that night and ended with the fact that Brody could be the father of both babies from twin sisters. Jessica walked in as Natalie concluded.\n\n\nStartled, Natalie clarified that she was telling Brody about the incident in the doctor's office when the clerk erred and thought that Brody was the father of Natalie's baby. Jessica laughed and apologized for showing up at the scene. She wanted to tell Brody about the appointment. Natalie headed for the station, and Jessica asked Brody about his Rh factor. Brody knew it was negative since all soldiers had that fact on their tags. He knew the baby would be okay, since Jessica was also negative. Brody wanted to be sure to attend the next doctor's appointment with Jessica. He wanted to see their baby on the sonogram.\n\n\nDorian, Starr, and Langston arrived at La Boulaie. Dorian wanted the girls to stop hovering over her, and explained that the worst had already happened. She told them that David had left, and that was what he always did. They walked into her bedroom, and Dorian recalled being in bed with David. Suddenly, she doubled over as if in pain and began to scream. The girls were frightened. \"How could you leave me again?\" Dorian wailed.\n\n\nDorian calmed down and told the girls that she hated the room. She said that it reeked of David and his things. She began to toss David's belongings around. Langston suggested that her mother take a hot shower while Starr and Langston cleared out the room. Dorian agreed and told Langston to destroy the letter she had picked up. Dorian began to laugh that she would \"wash that man right out of my hair.\"\n\n\nAs Starr and Langston picked up David's things, the girls talked about how they thought that David and Dorian were one couple who \"had it together,\" but looks could be deceiving. Starr pointed out that it was the same as when James looked at Langston, and Langston turned defensive. She asked what Starr meant by her remark. Starr told her to forget it, but Langston persisted. Starr didn't want Langston to believe everything James said, she finally answered. Langston countered that James hadn't lied to her yet. Starr couldn't believe that Langston planned on seeing James again.\n\n\nThe girls cleaned up some broken glass that was in pieces like Dorian. Starr believed that happened when someone gave their heart to the wrong person. Langston took it personally, even though Starr insisted that she hadn't been referring to Langston. The girls argued, and Starr maintained that she was merely looking out for Langston. Starr didn't want her friend to get her heart broken. Langston thought that there was something Starr wasn't telling her, and she suspected that Starr thought about James a lot.\n\n\nLangston didn't want Starr to make a mistake like she had when she'd dated Ford behind Markko's back. She hadn't talked to anyone then, and she wanted Starr to be able to share her feelings about James. Finally, Starr admitted that she thought about James often, but she didn't love him. She had no right to be jealous of Langston, because she and Cole would work things out eventually. Langston promised to stay away from James, and she would find another way to make Ford angry. \"Well done girls,\" Dorian said as she looked around her clean bedroom, and grabbed her computer.\n\n\nThe girls refused to allow her to update her MyFace status, but Dorian wanted to check David's page. The girls agreed as long as they were there to oversee it. Dorian clicked onto David's page and read his status, \"single and loving it.\"\n\n\nHannah was surprised when Cole walked into her room at St. Anne's. He revealed that he knew that Eli had committed the crimes, and Hannah urged him to get out of town quickly after Cole admitted that Eli wasn't in jail yet. She was concerned that John had given the information to Cole. She acknowledged that she had swallowed the pills to protect Cole, and he was stunned to hear that. She avowed that she couldn't allow anything to happen to Cole because she had loved him. She realized she had been obsessed with him, and Starr had been right to warn him about Hannah. She had done awful things.\n\n\nJohn apologized to Marty for telling her about the pregnancy. He hadn't planned it, but Natalie's name had been mentioned. Marty declared that she was happy for John, though she gasped for breath and looked upset. She maintained that she'd always known that John and Natalie were meant for one another.\n\n\nNatalie returned to the station, and there was an awkward moment between her, Marty, and John. Marty urged them to be careful with a new baby on the way. She choked up and ran out of the office as she began to cry, and wished them congratulations on their new family.\n\n\nA musical montage to \"Holding Out for Love\" by Ashtar Command played. Marty held herself up against the wall outside of John's office while inside, John gently placed his hand on Natalie's stomach. Cole grabbed Hannah's hand as he said goodbye. Starr and Langston lay in bed with Dorian in the middle as they all tried to sleep. Starr thought about James, and Langston thought about Ford. At Ford's place, James daydreamed about Starr, and Ford flashed back to being with Langston at the country club. David sank to the floor of his cell and vowed to get back to Dorian, \"somehow, someday.\" He hoped she would wait for him.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "David is being held prisoner in Morocco, and surprisingly Clint is behind it. He informs David that he won't let him take his family's fortune and share it with Dorian, regardless of whether David is Bo's biological son. Clint also smugly tells David, he's made Dorian believe that David has left her at the alter and after that, David must know that she is not about to care where he is or what has happened to him. Neither will Bo when everybody believes that David is a no good person and has no way of proving otherwise. Meanwhile, Dorian is emotionally devastated. Starr and Langston stand by her side and support her although they both have incomplete issues in their lives; Starr with the dilemma of whether to stay with Cole or admit her feelings for James, and Langston with not knowing who is right for her. Eli has Blair with him in Tahiti and she wants him to believe she trusts him. But the cops are ready to find him at any cost.",
