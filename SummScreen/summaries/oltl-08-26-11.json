Shane suggested that Brody set up a sting operation, because Shane believed that Jack was ready to confess and just needed a push.  When Brody reminded Shane that Jack's friend had already taken responsibility for Gigi's death, Shane told Brody about Jack's visit.\n\n\nShane explained that Jack had announced that Shane would be able to return to school.  Shane added that Jack had said that he would ensure that everyone would leave Shane alone at school.  Shane insisted that Jack had felt bad about everything.  Shane asked, \"Why would someone that's innocent do that?  He wouldn't.  Only someone that's guilty would.\"  Shane believed that Jack would have confessed, if Rex had not kicked him out.  Shane screamed that he hated Jack and Todd and wished that they were dead.\n\n\nWhen Shane maintained that he hated them both, Brody stated that he understood how Shane felt.  After he remembered his confrontation with Victor, Brody related, \"Shane, I understand that when someone goes after your family, you want to make them pay.\"  However, Brody believed that Shane did not have that in him, because of the way Gigi had raised him.  Brody noted that revenge was a Manning thing, not a Morasco thing, to do.  Brody promised to get justice for Gigi.\n\n\nIn the cemetery, Natalie found Rex at Gigi's grave and saw the date of Gigi's death scratched off of her tombstone.  Natalie apologized to Rex and explained that vandals had likely done it.  When Natalie indicated that she would call the authorities, Rex stopped her and claimed that Gigi had sent him a message, and that something was wrong.  Rex told Natalie about the waitress in the Spotted Pony, who had looked like Gigi, and about how she had told him not to give up.  Rex believed that Gigi was still alive.\n\n\nNatalie questioned why, if Gigi was still alive, she would run away from Rex and then wondered how Gigi would end up in a strip club in Kentucky.  Rex still felt that he was right, but he stated that if he was wrong, Natalie could feel free to check him into St. Ann's.  Natalie claimed that she understood Rex, because Jared had once visited her, shortly after his death, to say goodbye, so that Natalie could move on.\n\n\nHowever, Natalie insisted that she was on Rex's side, and that if Rex said that Gigi was still alive, that was good enough for her.  When Natalie offered Rex a ride home, he refused.  Once Natalie left, Rex begged Gigi for more signals, and then he walked off.  Kim quietly crept up to the grave and touched the scratches on the tombstone.  She then heard a noise and jumped.  A groundskeeper discovered Kim at the grave and believed she was a vandal.  Once the groundskeeper realized his error, he admitted that he was surprised to see the death date scratched out.\n\n\nAt the police station, Rex chased Bo into his office and asked Bo to exhume Gigi's body, because Rex did not believe Gigi was dead.  Rex claimed that he kept seeing Gigi -- first at the mansion, then at Capricorn, and finally at a strip club in Kentucky.  After Bo asked, Rex admitted that no one else had seen her, but he still felt that Gigi was out there, and that she needed his help.\n\n\nAfter Bo asked what Rex would do if they found Gigi's body in the grave, Rex realized that he would have to move on.  Bo believed that exhuming Gigi's body might traumatize Shane, however, Rex felt that Shane would face more trauma by having to grow up without her.  Bo reminded Rex that both Rex and Shane had family and friends to stand by them.  Rex then insisted that he would exhume Gigi's body with or without Bo.\n\n\nBack at the gravesite, the groundskeeper indicated to Kim that Rex had ordered for Gigi's body to be exhumed.  When Bo and Rex arrived at the site, Kim hid behind the gate.  The authorities opened the coffin, and Bo and Rex discovered Gigi's body.  Rex was confused, and Bo tried to comfort him.  Shane arrived at the site and demanded to know what Rex was doing.\n\n\nRex stopped Shane from seeing Gigi, and Bo ordered the cops to cover up the coffin.  When Shane demanded to know why they had dug up his mom, Rex said that they would talk about it at home.  After they all left the cemetery, Kim walked up to Gigi's grave and laid flowers on it that she had stolen from Asa's grave.\n\n\nAt the Fords' apartment, James greeted Starr, who told him about Dorian's going-away party.  Starr reflected back to a time when she was young, and her Aunt Dorian had stated that Starr was a Cramer, and that nothing was more important than family.  Starr cried, and James hugged her.\n\n\nJames voiced that it made sense for Starr to miss Dorian, and that he and Starr both could always just jump on a train to visit her anytime.  Starr was pleased that James had offered to travel with her, but she also felt that everything in her life was changing.  After James mentioned the instance such as Starr finding out that the dad she had known for the last eight years of her life was, in reality, her uncle, Starr told James about the fight between herself and Dani.\n\n\nStarr explained that she had told Dani that Starr should have known that Victor was not their father, and that, in fact, she had known in a way.  When James said that Starr could not have possibly known that Victor was not her father, Starr claimed that she should have known after Victor had beaten Cole up, when he had pushed her down the stairs when she was pregnant, and when he had secretly set up house with Marty and had decided to kidnap Hope and raise her himself.\n\n\nStarr blamed herself, because she was the first one to reveal to everyone else that Walker Laurence was her father, after he had told her that he was.  James reminded Starr that a DNA test had been done, and he told her not to blame herself.  When James asked for Starr to move on, she wondered if her Uncle Victor would be able to.  As Starr got up to leave, James pointed out that her family would help her through it all.  He then offered her a bedtime book to read to Hope.  Starr thanked James for making her feel better.  Starr kissed James.\n\n\nAfter Blair answered the door to T\u00e9a at La Boulaie, they both expressed shock that the man that they had known as Todd for eight years was really Victor Lord Jr.  After Blair asked if T\u00e9a had walked out on Victor, once she had learned the truth, T\u00e9a revealed that she had actually slept with him.  T\u00e9a then explained what had happened with Victor, when they had all found out the truth.  T\u00e9a insisted that she still loved Victor.  Blair then asked T\u00e9a to convince Victor to give Todd back everything that belonged to him.\n\n\nBlair requested that T\u00e9a think about what Todd had gone through, but T\u00e9a insisted that it had not been Victor's fault.  Blair reflected that Todd did believe that he was one of a kind, and that he had been ready to kill Victor, so Blair had offered Todd a gun.  When T\u00e9a began to yell, Blair stressed that she had only offered Todd the gun, and that she had not actually given him one.\n\n\nBlair explained that she had offered Todd the gun to give him more perspective, and to stop him from leaving.  Blair insisted that she had reminded Todd that he would be in jail for a long time if he shot Victor, and that he would not be able to see or be around his kids.  T\u00e9a then demanded to see the gun in the safe.  As Blair started to retrieve it, T\u00e9a received a phone call from Bo.  T\u00e9a announced that Todd had just barged into Victor's office.  T\u00e9a and Blair ran out the door, and the safe was shown to be empty.\n\n\nAt the Sun, Todd stormed into Todd Manning's office and told Victor to get out.  When the assistant ran in, Todd insisted that she worked for him.  When Victor told her to leave, the assistant left, and Todd yelled out that she was fired.  Victor refused to leave, because he said it was his newspaper.  Todd declared that he was Todd and again demanded that Victor leave his office, as he held a gun hidden in the back pocket of his pants.\n\n\nTodd tossed all of the pictures off of the desk and yelled, \"Game's over.  Your time is up.  You know you don't have to just sit here and pretend to be newspaper magnate guy anymore.  My desk surrounded by people that I love, spending my money, running my newspaper.  This is my life, and I'm taking it all back.\"  Victor shook his head and claimed that it was his legacy, every bit as much as Todd's, and that he would not give up any of it.\n\n\nTodd declared that he had started the newspaper, that he had written the headlines on the newspapers posted on the wall, and that he was \"Todd Manning, Publisher,\" as was indicated on the nameplate.  When Todd exclaimed that Victor would have to hire a team of lawyers to get rid of him, Victor indicated that he controlled everything there, including the real estate, stocks, and money.  Victor stressed that he was in charge and told Todd to get shipwrecked, or to return to Louisiana.\n\n\nAs Victor asked to see Todd's I.D., Todd gave Victor three seconds to give Todd his life back.  Victor revealed that the kids did not care if Victor was their father or their uncle, and that they still loved him.  Victor insisted that the kids were on his side, even Starr, and that they would never accept Todd as their father.  When Todd started the count down to three, Victor warned, \"Well, if you want to get rid of me, you're gonna have to kill me.\"\n\n\nThe police barged into the office, and Todd and Victor both ordered that the police arrest the other for trespassing.  Blair and T\u00e9a ran in, and Blair asked to take Todd home.  Bo indicated that they could not just take Irene Manning's word on Todd's identity, and that it would have to be decided by a court of law.  Bo told Todd that he would have to leave, and the cops grabbed his arms to escort him out.  Blair insisted that they would settle it.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a and Victor were alone, T\u00e9a wondered why Victor had goaded Todd, and Victor reminded her that it was who he was and whom she had married.  Victor mentioned that he should sue Todd, and T\u00e9a only wished for an equitable way to settle it.  After Victor claimed that Todd did not deserve it, T\u00e9a believed that Todd would do whatever it took to get back what was rightfully his.  When T\u00e9a asked Victor if he really wanted to go to war with his brother, Victor cried, \"Bring it on!\"\n\n\nOn the porch of Llanfair, Blair said to Todd, \"I promise you first thing tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and find you a good lawyer, cause T\u00e9a, she is a shark.\"  Todd added, \"And she's on his side.\"  Blair pointed out, \"And I am on yours, so just get in there and get some rest and promise me that you will stay away from Victor.\"  Todd noted, \"It won't be hard.  I really can't stand the guy.\"  Blair said, \"Whatever,\" as she walked away.  Todd pulled out the gun and looked at it.  \"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be needing a lawyer.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex persuades Bo to exhume Gigi's grave when he sees that her date of death is missing. He has a \"vision\" that Gigi is still alive somewhere and he needs to get to her. Meanwhile, Shane calls Brody over to the house and tells him that he needs his help taking matters into his own hands to make Jack and Todd Manning pay for his mother's death. Brody tells Shane that he knows neither himself nor Shane nor Gigi behave the way the Mannings do. Yet Brody remembers that he has felt a need to \"threaten \" Todd not to tell anybody the secret about John being Liam's father and the fact that Brody is covering it up. So he has another \"motivator\" for Todd although he does not tell Shane. Meanwhile, all the people in Todd's life are still living with the \"dilemma\" about whether to believe or recognize the Todd they've known for 8 years who's really Victor, or original Todd. Bo tells original Todd that the police cannot help him and have to arrest him for trespassing when he goes to The Sun and current Todd calls the cops to have him removed. Bo tells him that all they have is Irene's word and that is not proof that he really is Todd Manning.",
