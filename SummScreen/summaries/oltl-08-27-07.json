    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie is confused by Miles' actions and the fact that he knows more about Todd's son than he has let on. Miles holds up a key that holds the solution to the whereabouts of Todd's son. Miles rushes out. Antonio sits at the bar when Talia starts into the bar. When she sees Antonio, she is embarrassed by her outfit and starts to leave. Antonio sees her and tells her to come back. Talia explains to him what she was doing dressed like that. Jared Banks comes into the bar and approaches the table where Natalie and Miles are. Natalie tells him, once again, that she is not hiring him at Buchanan Enterprises. Jared then walks over to Antonio and introduces himself. Jared offers him top dollar for his share of Nash's vineyard. Antonio is reluctant to sell to him, at first, but after talking to Talia, Antonio agrees to sell. Nash still grieves over losing the money to buy out Antonio. Roxy tries to help him think of a way to get back his money. Jessica calls and wants to know what was going on, but Nash is reluctant to tell her. John arrests Lindsay for the murder of Spencer Truman. Marcie can't understand why Lindsay will not tell them that John made a mistake in the arrest. Rex and Adriana are just as confused, but Adriana begins to understand why Lindsay could have killed Spencer. Lindsay is taken to the police station for questioning, but she refuses to answer any of John's questions. Miles goes to the locker where the vital info about Todd's son is. He is visited by the ghost of Spencer. Miles takes the file out of the locker and begins to read it. Todd and Blair begin to realize that they are a good team when it comes to the newspaper business.",
