While Sarah and the brothers hid nearby, Talia made sure that Bitterman found her in bed with Jonas. Talia explained Jonas' unconscious state, suggesting that it was exhaustion after their night of passion. Satisfied that the marriage had been consummated, Bitterman told Talia that he was concerned by Carlo's sudden disappearance. Talia lied and told the royal aide that Carlo had gone boar hunting earlier that morning. Talia then put the next phase of their plan into motion. She ordered Bitterman to lift the blackout on the press corps and invite the reporters into the palace. A short time later, Talia held a press conference to announce that the King and Queen of Mendorra were ready to be crowned. Talia then offered to take the reporters on a tour of the palace. \n\n\nA chorus of shocked gasps rang out when Talia swung the doors open to the royal suite, and revealed Jonas and Carlo-naked, in bed, and fast asleep in what appeared to be an intimate embrace. Talia pretended to be as stunned as everyone else by the discovery. \n\n\nBo visited Lindsay in jail to thank her. He told her that as deeply as Bo had been hurt by her deception, it had forced him on a spiritual journey, which lead Bo to find himself. Bo admitted that, even though he might never forgive Lindsay for what she had done, he had come to understand what had driven her. Bo realized that love could force a person to do extraordinary things in order to preserve it. Bo then wished Lindsay well and told her that he hoped her time in prison would pass quickly. Lindsay seemed hopeful and started to suggest that she might look him up when she was released from prison, but Bo stopped her before she could finish her sentence. He told her \"good luck,\" and left. \n\n\nIn Paris, Texas, Rex continued to grapple with the revelations that Gigi loved him and Shane was his son. Gigi reassured Rex that it was all true. Acceptance led to anticipation. Rex began making plans for the future. Besides calling Adriana, Rex wanted to tell Shane the truth so that they could begin bonding as father and son. Gigi didn't want to rush into telling Shane the truth, because it would be a lot for a young boy to deal with. When Gigi mentioned that she had not been able to reach Shane since their return to 2008, Rex encouraged Gigi to call \"their son.\" \n\n\nAt home, Shane gave Brody a special gift as they prepared to go to the kitchen for breakfast. It was a scrapbook, which Shane had made for his father, of the important moments in Shane's life. Brody was touched by the gesture and sat down while Shane explained the significance of each picture. They were interrupted when Gigi called. Shane was happy to hear from his mother. Gigi told him that she missed him and that she would return on the first available flight. They chatted for a bit before Shane passed the phone to Brody. Brody's joy soon turned to annoyance when Gigi told Brody that she was with Rex. Brody became defensive and justified his recent actions by claiming that everything he had done was for Shane's sake. \n\n\nAfter Gigi hung up, Rex quickly realized that Gigi felt bad for Brody because he would end up losing the son that Rex gained. Gigi didn't deny it, but agreed that Shane had the right to know that Rex was his father. \n\n\nAt the house, Brody received a timely package. The test results were in and they showed that Brody was a DNA match to Shane. Shane was thrilled when Brody handed him the papers confirming that Brody was his biological father. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina was disappointed by Todd's indifference to seeing her. Todd didn't seem concerned about Tina's hurt feelings. He was only interested in talking to Jessica. At the mention of her niece, Tina went on a tangent about how different Jessica had seemed since Tina's return to Llanview. As Tina recounted several recent events to illustrate the changes in Jessica, she mentioned the reaction Jessica had to David Vickers trying to get into the basement. Todd tried to cover for Tess, attributing her recent behavior to the stress of pregnancy and losing her husband, Nash, but Tina wasn't placated. Tina felt that Jessica's recent problems didn't give her the right to treat her aunt poorly. When Tina decided to call Viki, Todd stepped in and stopped her. Before he left, Todd warned Tina to steer clear of Jessica. \n\n\nTess went to the police station to talk to John about Todd's mystery woman. Tess tried to convince John that the woman didn't exist. Unfortunately, her desperation to convince John that the woman didn't exist had the opposite effect. After Tess left, John placed a phone call to find out when the 3-D reproduction of the woman would be completed. Bo walked in as John ended the call. \n\n\nTess returned to Llanfair and bumped into Todd in the foyer. Todd was furious when he learned that Tess had been at the police station. Tess confidently assured Todd that her mission had been a success. She told Todd that John had all but closed the case. Todd wasn't convinced. Tess promised him that as long as her secret was safe, Todd's secret would be safe. Todd asked Tess which secret she referred to, that she was Tess or that she was hiding something in the basement?\n \n\n\n",
