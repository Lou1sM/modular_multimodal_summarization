    "soap_central": "\nLeave The Bottle\n\n\nIn a darkened alleyway, an anxious Cole met up with John.  Cole asked John how long he would have to continue as an undercover operative, and said he missed his family.  He asked about Starr, Hope, and Marty, and John gave him updates and reassured him that everyone was fine.  Cole was pleased to hear that Marty had gone back to work at the hospital, but dismayed that he was unable to be there for his loved ones.  John told Cole that they were close to a bust, and explained that they'd tracked a leak in the department back to the source of the drug trafficking.  \n\n\n\n \nJohn was reluctant to name names, but after Cole pushed him, he nodded towards a nearby campaign poster for Mayor Lowell.  Cole was shocked to realize that the mayor himself was involved in the drug network, and asked why John hadn't moved on him.  John explained that they were still building their case.  Cole was worried about Lowell's reach, and feared for Starr and Hope's safety.  John promised him that his family was in no danger.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr watched Dorian, dressed to the nines, greet Mayor Lowell .  As Dorian introduced Starr, and Starr brought up Hope's babysitting schedule, Lowell was put out to realize that Starr was an unwed teen mother.  Annoyed by his attitude, Starr left to check on Hope, while Dorian and Lowell got into campaign mode.  Dorian explained to Lowell that she was eager to help his campaign, and be helped in return in her efforts to regain the chief of staff position at the hospital.  Lowell told Dorian he couldn't help her, as the chief of staff was a close friend and contributor.  \n\n\nDorian was about to withdraw her support, but Lowell made her a counter-offer, suggesting she become his campaign manager.  Lowell flattered Dorian, calling her \"the queen of Llanview,\" and said that his new run was going to be a launchpad for the governorship and beyond; he promised Dorian a position as his right hand, with equal amounts power and prestige.  Charmed, Dorian agreed to his proposal.\n\n\nStarr returned to the drawing room with Hope in her arms, just in time to hear Dorian accept Lowell's offer.  She was upset that her aunt would support a politician who was against young mothers.  Lowell quickly backpedaled with Dorian's help, insisting that he only wanted to promote \"family values,\" no matter what kind of family that might be.  Seizing a P.R. opportunity, Dorian handed Hope to Lowell over Starr's protests, then told Starr and Lowell to stand together for a picture.  \"Say 'White House!'\" Dorian trilled, snapping the shot of Lowell, Hope, and the irritated Starr.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki and Charlie sat up in bed, hard at work on their individual projects.  The television caught Viki's eye, and she turned on the sound, only to hear a broadcast of Mayor Lowell's speech from earlier in the day.  Disgusted, Viki began to vent about Lowell's corruption and incompetence once more.  Charlie again urged Viki to run against Lowell, but Viki scoffed at the idea.  She said whoever opposed Lowell would need money, influence, and experience, but Charlie reminded her that she possessed all three.  \"Give 'em hell!\" he said.\n\n\nViki said she didn't want to put the children in the public spotlight, and warned Charlie that Lowell would use Jessica's troubles as a lightning rod for criticism against her.  Charlie reassured her that Jessica was strong, and would only be encouraged by Viki's example.  He reminded Viki that she'd run for mayor, and won, once before, but never served her full term due to her gunshot injury.  He asked her how different Llanview would have been if she'd served her full term, leaving no room for men like Stan Lowell to take control.  Viki said that she loved Llanview as her home, and hated to see men like Lowell ruining it with greed and corruption.  Charlie pushed Viki to take on Lowell, and finish what she'd started.\n\n\nAs Viki and Charlie cuddled in bed, she told him that they'd have less time for themselves if she became mayor.  Charlie suggested they take a page from the president and have \"Date Night,\" then asked Viki if that was a \"yes\" to running against Lowell.  Viki hedged and said she'd have to talk to the children.  Charlie rooted around for the phone, suggesting she call them immediately, and said there was no time to lose against Lowell.  He said she could beat Lowell, and Viki replied that she could do anything as long as she had Charlie.  \"I'm with you,\" Charlie said, embracing her.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan stables, Markko returned to find Langston in an intimate conversation about \"love stories\" with Ford.  Interrupting, he informed them of the footage he'd shot at the house with Greg and Rachel.  Ford asked if there had been sparks or tension between the two, and Markko said there was definitely action with Greg, Rachel, and their anger at David.  Ford quickly rushed off to find David and Priscilla.\n\n\nWith Ford gone, Markko confronted Langston about her new rapport with Ford.  Langston said they'd only worked on creative ideas for the show's \"story arcs,\" and suggested they center around romance.  Markko asked if that meant she was working on the show, as well, and Langston wondered if he had a problem with that.  Markko said he didn't, and that it just meant more time for them to be together.  He asked about Langston's obvious approval of Ford, and Langston teased him as she recounted the tableau of Ford dousing himself with a bucket of water.  Markko decided to outdo the young producer by stripping off his shirt and repeating the same scene with the bucket, drenching himself and Langston.  Turned on, Langston said he was hotter than Ford, and asked if he had a condom.  When Markko said yes, she pulled him back into the stables.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi and Rex were annoyed to see Stacy, who introduced them to Kim.  Stacy said they had to talk about the baby, but before she could get a word out, Kim and Gigi began to spar, with Gigi calling Kim a whore and nearly charging her.  Kim defended Stacy, but was nonplussed to hear Gigi retell the tale of her sister's assault on her car and the attempt to throw Gigi down the hospital stairs.  Stacy told them to stop fighting, and said she had something important to tell everyone.\n\n\nOnce again, Stacy was interrupted as Shane returned home, shocked to see his not-so-loving aunt.  Furious, Shane began to unload on her, calling her a liar who had pretended to be his bone marrow donor and made his parents break up, just so her father could love her.  He told a tearful Stacy that Rex didn't love her, and never would.  Shane raged that Stacy had made him think his mother was a slut, but instead, \"you're the slut!\"  He screamed that he wished she wasn't pregnant, and that her baby was dead.  Kim intervened, calling Shane a brat and telling him not to speak to his aunt that way.  Stacy apologized to Shane and began to speak, but Kim cut her off.  Defiant, she warned the Balsom-Morasco family that Stacy and her pregnancy were a fact of life that they would have to get used to.\n\n\nKim began to usher Stacy out, but Stacy attempted once more to tell Rex and Gigi the truth, despite Kim's protests.  \"I have to tell them!\" Stacy said.  Rex asked Stacy what she wanted to say, and Stacy folded, making up a story about how she'd found another doctor for her check-up.  With that, the two  strippers beat a hasty retreat.  As the Balsoms recovered, Shane apologized to Gigi and Rex for what he said about the baby.  Gigi hugged him and said she knew how he felt.\n\n\nAt Layla's apartment, Fish returned home, only to find Layla waiting for him in the living room.  Fish arrived  bearing wine and gifts, ready for a romantic evening, but Layla wasn't in the mood.  She told him she needed answers about him and Kyle Lewis.  Fish was full of denials, but Layla pressed on with what she'd heard from Nick at Serenity Springs, and inquired about his mysterious college years.  She asked him point-blank, \"Were you sleeping with Kyle Lewis?\"  Fish admitted that he'd been involved with Kyle in college, but said that he'd been young and confused, experimenting.  He said he ha d put his past behind him and was thoroughly heterosexual, ready to commit to Layla.\n\n\nLayla dropped the other shoe, asking him to explain the kiss with Kyle that Cristian had witnessed at the Buenos Dias.  Fish insinuated that Cris was manipulating them because he wanted Layla for himself, and said that Kyle had assaulted him against his will.  Layla didn't buy it, explaining what Nick had told her about \"Kyle's jealous ex,\" and how Cristian had said that both men were into their kiss.  She said she'd worked with many gays and lesbians in the fashion world and could understand youthful experimentation, but that wasn't what Fish was.  \"Say the words,\" Layla snapped. \"You're gay.\"\n\n\nDeep in denial, Fish refused to tell Layla what she already knew.  He insisted that his relationship with Kyle had been a phase, but Layla said that his run-ins with Kyle proved that his feelings were still there.  Growing tearful, she told him she feared having a \"safe,\" loveless relationship with a good man who cared for her, but kept all his passion hidden away for secret trysts with other men.  She said she wanted a man who could give her all of himself, and wanted her the way Fish wanted Kyle, not just as arm candy to impress his parents or co-workers.  Fish reminded Layla that they'd made love.  \"It's not supposed to feel like a test, Fish,\" Layla said softly, and told him she wouldn't let him use her to hide his secret.\n\n\nCrying, Fish pleaded feebly with Layla, reminding her that he'd told his parents about her.  He said he needed her, that she was the perfect woman, but his platitudes began to sound increasingly platonic as Fish told Layla he loved hanging out with her and could be what she needed.  \"I can't be gay,\" Fish insisted, claiming it wasn't how he was raised or who he wanted to be.  Fish said he wanted a family, but Layla told him gays and lesbians raised families.  Growing angry again, Layla called him \"a gay homophobe,\" and accused Fish of hating himself.  Fish begged Layla to give him another chance, promising he'd go to therapy or church, but Layla told him no.  She said he was lying to both of them, and she deserved better.\n\n\nLayla asked  Fish to leave.  As he prepared to go, Fish wept and told Layla that he was sorry and had never meant to hurt her.  \"I'm sorry too,\" Layla said, slamming the door in his face.  After he left, Layla picked up Fish's Llanview Police Department cap and held it, then collapsed to her knees.  She sobbed her heart out as she threw the cap across the living room.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Kim and Stacy regrouped after the disaster at the carriage house.  Stacy was sure her pregnancy dreams were a thing of the past.  Kim insisted that they were down but not defeated, and suggested Stacy reconsider a sperm bank donor.  Beaten, Stacy refused, and asked Kim to go back to the loft.  Kim kissed Stacy's forehead and said  she'd give her friend an hour.  Alone, Stacy ordered a bottle of tequila, saying to herself that it didn't matter anymore.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan stables, Langston and Markko cuddled together in the hayloft, basking in the afterglow of their lovemaking.  Langston reassured Markko that Ford might have piqued her fancy, but Markko was the only man for her.  Satisfied, Markko pulled Langston into a kiss.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi and Rex sat on the porch, musing over their run-in with Stacy and Kim.  Gigi was skeptical about Stacy's visit, and wondered if Stacy had really visited just to confess about finding a new doctor.  Rex told Gigi that it didn't matter, because it was over.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Stacy got her tequila and prepared to drink herself into a stupor.  Unbeknownst to her, Fish sat across the bar, downing shots. \n\n\n",
