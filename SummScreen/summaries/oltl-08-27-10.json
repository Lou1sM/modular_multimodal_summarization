    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, as Detective Theo Price and John McBain studied a map, Price indicated that he wanted to be the one \"to get the guy,\" since he had let him get away.  John informed the detective that Eli and Blair had left Llanview in a plane that had landed in Los Angeles.  \"Where they went next is anybody's guess.\"  Price suspected that Eli had crossed the border, where \"he's in the wind,\" to make it more difficult to find him.  \n\n\nJohn received a call and learned that Eli and Blair had boarded a plane with a 4,000-mile fuel capacity at the Los Angeles airport.  John speculated that Eli and Blair had not traveled to Honolulu, since the distance was only 2,500 miles.  John then ordered Price to return home, so that the detective could recuperate.  Price insisted, \"As soon as the doctor signs off, I'm coming back to take Clarke down.\"\n\n\nIn the men's steam room at the country club, Rex told Cristian that he knew about the file on Bennett Thompson and was working on the case with John.  Rex informed Cristian that the first person who stole the file was Eli Clarke, and the second person was Kelly; just then, she stormed into the steam room.  Cristian reported to Rex and Kelly that someone had broken into his apartment to steal the file on Bennett Thompson.  Kelly revealed that Eli Clarke was Bennett Thompson and filled Cristian in on the whole story of what Rex, John, and Kelly had suspected about Eli.  Kelly insisted that she and Rex needed to find Eli, before he hurt Blair.  Cristian thanked Kelly for the update on the case and left.\n\n\nLayla carried in another map to John and voiced that Evangeline would have wanted to know that her file had helped prove that Eli Clarke was Bennett Thompson.  After Layla begged John to capture Eli, she walked into the lobby and found Cristian, who greeted Layla with a kiss.\n\n\nCristian told Layla that Eli Clarke was Bennett Thompson, and Layla admitted that it was true.  \"He knocked you out and stole the file.  But you were one of the lucky ones.  He's killed people -- including Evangeline.\"  When Cristian asked how Eli had killed Evangeline, Layla said that her mother had called Bennett Thompson to get his advice, and the attorney had told Lisa to remove Evangeline from life support.  Layla yelled that Eli had made her family kill Evangeline for him.\n\n\nCristian reminded Layla that Eli had not put Evangeline in the coma, however, Layla remarked that thanks to Eli, her sister was gone, and that she missed her.  \"It makes me so angry that someone could use the condition of a dying woman to suit their own evil needs.\"  Cristian felt that Evangeline was \"resting in peace\" and would want Layla to find her own peace.  Layla agreed and decided to let John take care of Eli.\n\n\nStill at the country club, Rex reminded Kelly that she was in the men's steam room, and Kelly stated that she was desperate to find Blair, before Blair ended up as Eli's next victim.  When Kelly begged Rex to help her locate Blair, Rex said that he would.  Rex asked Kelly if she knew of any places that had been significant to Blair, such as \"a chateau in France, a village in Montego, a hut in Timbuktu,\" but Kelly was not sure.\n\n\nHowever, Kelly knew that Eli had been to Boston, where he had \"killed the poor records clerk, Glen,\" and to California, where he had killed her mother, Melinda.  Rex commented that those were unlikely honeymoon places.  Kelly then revealed that before Eli was Bennett Thompson, he had been married to a lady, who had died under suspicious circumstances, and that when Eli was Bennett Thompson, his wife had \"vanished off of the face of the earth.\"  Kelly pondered, \"Blair has no idea that she is in way over her head.\"\n\n\nKelly yelled at Rex that since he was the private investigator, he should be the one with all of the ideas.  Rex recollected that when Blair had hired him to locate Ross, Rex had found Ross in Tahiti.  But Kelly and Rex doubted that Blair and Eli would get married in Tahiti, since Ross was dead.  Kelly wondered if Ross had established an estate, and if Eli would receive an inheritance.  Rex stated that he would present the theory to John, as Detective Price entered the steam room.  Rex grabbed his gun, and he and Kelly ran out.  The detective shook his head and exclaimed to himself that he did not want to know what that was all about.\n\n\nJohn checked out the distance from Llanview to Greenland and Llanview to Caracas on the computer but determined that the distance was too short.  He then discovered that Tahiti was 4,005 miles from Llanview.  Rex ran into John's office and exclaimed, \"John, we had an idea, where Eli might have taken Blair.\"  John simply stated, \"Tahiti.\"\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Eli stepped out of the hotel room and called Greg at St. Kitts.  Eli demanded to know if Greg had told T\u00e9a that she was right not to see her daughter, and Greg replied that he had told T\u00e9a that Dani and Todd were on their way to see her, even though he knew it was not true.  Greg regretted lying to T\u00e9a, and Eli reminded Greg that he would never have to lie to T\u00e9a again.  As Eli yelled, \"This is going to work,\" Blair walked through the door.\n\n\nEli hung up the phone and kissed Blair, who realized that her phone should be working too.  Eli insisted that what he had meant was that his phone was going to work, but that, alas, it still did not.  Blair claimed that she had promised T\u00e9a to watch over Dani, therefore, Blair needed to get back to Llanview.  Eli told Blair that they would leave just as soon as they did what they had set out to do, and that Ross was already on his way to the room.  Blair pleaded with Eli to leave Ross a note, as she tripped over Eli's suitcase, which opened and revealed T\u00e9a's will, unseen by Blair.  However, Blair saw a gun and demanded to know who owned it.  Eli stressed that the gun belonged to Ross, and Blair asked why it was not put somewhere safe and claimed that it gave her \"the willies.\"\n\n\nEli reminded Blair that he had wanted everything to be perfect when they got married, and Blair replied, \"Eli, listen to me.  You are perfect for me, and I'm going to love you no matter where we say, 'I do,' okay?\"  Eli and Blair decided to get married in Llanview, and as they kissed, Ross walked in.\n\n\nBlair greeted Ross, and Ross stated that he was glad to see that Eli had arrived all right.  However, Blair voiced that Ross already knew that Eli had arrived, since they had just talked on the phone the previous night.  Ross asked about Dani and insisted that he still thought of Dani as his daughter, and that learning that he was not her biological father had been the hardest thing that he had ever had to go through.  Eli told Ross that Dani was fine, but Blair revealed that T\u00e9a was dying.\n\n\nRoss was shocked that T\u00e9a had a brain tumor and asked what would happen with Dani.  When Blair informed Ross that Dani was with Todd, Ross related that he was glad that he had asked Dani to work on her relationship with Todd.  After Blair told Ross that she was leaving for Llanview, Ross said, \"No, no, no, Blair, I'm sorry.  You're not going anywhere.\"\n\n\nRoss showed surprise that Blair and Eli were getting married, since he did even know that they knew each other, but insisted that he was happy for them.  \"This is why you can't go.  Uh-uh...not until you do what you came here to do -- which is to become Mrs. Eli Clarke.\"  However, just as Eli insisted that \"Blair's family comes first,\" a Tahitian municipality representative arrived to perform the ceremony.  Blair agreed to get married in Tahiti and left to change.\n\n\nFor the ceremony, Blair made a grand entrance in a stunning white wedding gown.  Eli expressed that he wanted to make Blair his \"wife as soon as possible.\"  The Tahitian representative read Eli the vows, and Eli responded, \"I do.\"  Once the representative read Blair her vows, all turned to look at Blair for her response.\n\n\nOn the plane, Dani and Todd were both anxious to see T\u00e9a.  Shaun insisted that Todd's threats had not made him take them to Tea.  Shaun believed that Dani needed to see T\u00e9a, and Todd was certain that T\u00e9a needed to see Dani.  \"Her last memory shouldn't be of some cold, heartless doctor.\"\n\n\nShaun revealed that he had asked T\u00e9a why she had stuck it out with Todd, and that T\u00e9a had replied that Todd wasn't so bad, and because Todd was scared and afraid to show the world who he really was.  Todd laughed and said that T\u00e9a did not know what she was talking about.\n\n\nDani called Nate and announced that she was on her way to see her mother.  Dani insisted that she would stay with T\u00e9a until the end, and Nate stressed that he would be there for Dani, when she returned.  Dani hoped that T\u00e9a would not be mad at her and Todd for going against her wishes, and that T\u00e9a would be happy to see her.  Nate exclaimed that T\u00e9a would be very proud of Dani.  After she thanked Nate, Dani told him that she would call him later.\n\n\nOutside of the room at the country club that had been destroyed by Dorian, Darren covered Destiny's eyes and asked, \"Guess who?\"  Destiny refused to play and indicated that she was watching out look for Nate.  As she started to clean the room, Darren told Destiny that his brother had an ice pack on his head, and that he hoped that Theo did not think that Darren had blown \"his cover and tipped off the perp.\"  Destiny assured him that the only person who had overheard them talking had been Eli Clarke.\n\n\nNate walked in, and Destiny informed him that he looked \"awful.\"  Nate revealed that Shaun was taking Dani and Todd to T\u00e9a.  Destiny cheered, \"Yes, I knew my brother would come through.\"  Destiny only wished that her other brother, Greg, could help T\u00e9a, as much as Shaun had.  \"Greg's the big success -- our star.  The rest of my family is pretty much blue collar.\"  Darren claimed that his \"folks\" were white collar, except for Theo.  However, Darren revealed that he preferred the good life to keep his lady in style.  Destiny denied being his lady and called Darren a player.  Destiny exclaimed that she wanted to be successful in her own right.  Nate explained that even though he and his mother were going through tough times, Dani had it worse.\n\n\nThey finished cleaning, and Darren asked Destiny for a kiss, as they walked out of the room.  Destiny allowed Darren to kiss her on the cheek, and Darren sauntered off.  Nate thought that Darren was hilarious, and Destiny revealed that Nate was not the jackass that she had thought he was when he had stolen Dani from Matthew.  \"You're not so bad.  I mean, you've really been there for Dani through all this.\"  Nate sadly stated, \"Yeah, I think she's going to need me more than ever when she gets home.\"  Nate then hoped that the trip would give Dani what she was searching for.\n\n\nTheo welcomed Darren in the country club steam room, and Darren revealed that he had told his \"peeps\" that he was proud of his brother, even if he could not understand why Theo had wanted to be a cop.\n\n\nDani rejoined Todd on the plane, and they fastened their seat belts to prepare for the landing.  Later, Todd, Dani, and Shaun arrived at St. Kitts and demanded to see T\u00e9a.  Greg informed them that it would be impossible.  Todd yelled that Greg could not prevent Dani from seeing T\u00e9a, and the three of them stormed into the room.  When they saw the empty bed, Dani and Shaun demanded to know where T\u00e9a was.  Todd screamed, \"Where is she?  Where's my wife?\"\n\n\nTodd asked again, \"Where's T\u00e9a?\"  Greg answered, \"She's gone.\"  Todd snarked, \"Yeah, I can see that.  Where is she?\"\n\n\nTodd demanded to know one more time, \"Where's T\u00e9a?\"  Greg responded, \"That's what I have been trying to explain.  I'm sorry to tell you, but uh...T\u00e9a died last night.\" \n\n\n",
