Then, the young lovebirds were making out until Auntie Dorian came in.  Dorian explained the Lindsay arrest at the Woman of the Year's awards for Spencer's murder.  Cole asked about his mother since Lindsay is now a new suspect.  Dorian said that Marty wasn't mentioned.  Cole wanted to go pick up his mom, get the apartment together and get the new keys, since Nora changed the locks.  Dorian told him that John was probably going to bring her home but he left anyway.  Dorian admitted to Starr that Cole was a good kid, when he gave Dorian a hug.

Todd attacked Miles again and tells Miles if he could name two of his children, he'll let him live.  Miles said he has three; but only names Starr and Jack.

John said he doesn't want any of this to come out and Lindsay told him to protect his family by not letting it come out.  \n\n\nRex and Marcie separately defend Lindsay to Nora and Bo stating that it couldn't be possible that she could have killed Spencer.
