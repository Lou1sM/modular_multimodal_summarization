He was less than thrilled to be working there, but needed to earn money for college. Langston reminded him of her own inability to tap any money in her trust fund. When Delphina showed up to give Langston a reading and requested $100, Markko was floored. He pointed out how long he had to work to make a similar amount. \n\n\nTrying to advise Langston that Delphina was merely a phony, Markko was stopped in his tracks when Delphina called him Geraldo Rivera. Upon questioning by Langston, he admitted that Geraldo was indeed his real name, just like the newsman, but he had changed it to Markko. He still felt that Delphina could have easily obtained that information anywhere. Delphina proceeded to have a conversation with a dark-haired woman and again told Langston that she was not alone. \n\n\nAt the diner, a persuasive Jared talked up Charlie's skills to Carlotta, regarding the post-fire makeover. Carlotta disclosed that her heart was really with Antonio and what he was involved with but she was unable to share any details. She decided that talk about rebuilding the diner was just what she needed to take her mind off of her son and give her hope for the future. She agreed to let Charlie put together an estimate of all of the improvements she might want, but advised him she had no money until the insurance company completed their investigation of the fire. \n\n\nJared confessed to Natalie that he was doing something for her father, in order for them to be in the man's good graces again. He admitted that he could not tell her what that something was due to it being something unethical. When Natalie vowed to go to Clint to get the details for herself, Jared felt that he had no choice but to tell her what he was doing. A shocked Natalie was dismayed that Clint wanted Jared to go after a teenager and could hardly believe that Jared would so readily do Clint's dirty work. Picking up the phone to call Clint herself to tell him off, Natalie unhappily allowed Jared to convince her otherwise. He explained that Langston was not an orphan and that he would merely orchestrate a tiny threat to get Langston's uncle to try to take custody of Langston. He was sure that Dorian would return Buchanan Enterprises to the family when her ward was threatened with this action. He hated seeing Natalie unhappy and was doing it to try to get things back to the way they were before. \n\n\nRex and Gigi stopped at the Bon Jour Caf\u00e9 before leaving Paris, Texas, and talked more about their future together. Gigi tried to reassure Rex that he would be a great dad to Shane. She acknowledged that her success at raising a child herself was due to lots of love and laughter, and not letting her son get away with anything. A doubting Moe pointed out that Rex was still married, but Rex pledged his commitment to both Shane and Gigi. When Rex mentioned Moe's father and his diner in 1968, Moe was taken aback and wondered how in the world Rex would know anything about him. Rex assured him that Mr. Stubbs was quite legendary. Noticing Noelle's engagement ring, Gigi was happy for her friends. Moe pointed out that Delphina was wrong with her prediction. Rex thought it was the first time the psychic had not been right. Moe and Noelle had some goodies for Shane and Viki packed and ready to go back to Llanview. \n\n\nJohn was surprised but pleased to see Bo when the former police head walked into his office. John let him know that he was only keeping Bo's seat warm until Bo could once again be the \"commish.\" Bo wondered if the mayor was aware of John's proposal, and confessed that he left town not only because of the mayor, but because of his father and Lindsay, too. He was comforted to know that John understood. \n\n\nAs the men spoke, the mayor himself showed up. Ordering Bo out of the office, he suggested that John see Bo on his own time. He added that Bo had brought shame and degradation to the department and he had no respect for him. Bo spit out his coffee at the mayor's remarks. As soon as the mayor stopped his rant, the iron-willed new police commissioner jumped in. John advised the mayor that he would do as he pleased. Putting the icing on the cake, he ordered the mayor to re-appoint Bo as the police commissioner. John was adamant that the town needed Bo back, especially since John had no intention of ever making the mayor look good, as Bo would. As the mayor sputtered, John offered to call a press conference to let everyone know what had happened while Ramsey headed the department. A reluctant mayor gave Bo his old job back but gave orders to leave Todd Manning alone. A grateful Bo advised his friend that he owed him. John refused to accept Bo's thanks and instead they agreed that it was time to go after Todd. \n\n\nAn over-the-top Talia sobbed on Bitterman's shoulder as she spied her husband and father in bed together. As the press looked on, the men slowly awakened. As he realized the situation, Carlo immediately ordered everyone out of the room. As Talia continued to bawl about the affair between Jonas and Carlo, the press asked questions of the men, regarding gay marriage and their sexuality. Carlo insisted they were set up, but the claim fell on deaf ears. Bitterman recalled the men always having their heads together and being holed up in meetings late at night. Mendorra was defrauded, with Carlo wanting to bleed the country dry! \n\n\nSuddenly it dawned on Carlo, seeing Antonio, Sarah, and Cris together; he and Jonas had been drugged. Carlo called for the guards as he mournfully expressed his love for Talia, reminding his daughter that he had made her a queen. She quickly pointed out with a straight face that she had returned the favor and advised him that pictures were probably already all over the Internet. She stood her ground and told her father that she and her friends were heading back to Llanview. \n\n\nAs Carlo continued to call for the guards, Talia begged him not to. When they finally showed up, he ordered that the intruders be arrested. Things backfired when Carlo was arrested for fraud instead. As he and Jonas were taken out, they learned that beheading was the punishment for such a crime. Talia refused to intercede. \n\n\nAs an inquisitive Todd continued to press Tess on what she might have hidden in the basement, Tess smoothly changed the topic of conversation to Todd's own secret about Marty. She again threatened to divulge the identity of his secret housemate if he continued to meddle in her business. Todd skillfully figured out that Natalie and Jared were the two people that Tess would want to hurt, recalling the faulty brakes on Natalie's car. He realized that the secret in the basement had something to do with them. Inside, Tina was enjoying the news coverage of the latest events in Mendorra. \n\n\nTess pointed out that Nash's death was no accident, as she recounted the events of that day. Nash was shoved and she was still holding Jared and Natalie accountable for that. As Todd owned up to not liking Tess, he suddenly grabbed her. Pushing her against the wall, he demanded that Jessica return, yelling and calling to her. As they continued to struggle and grab at each other, Jessica suddenly emerged. She told her uncle that she was back and wanted to be there. As Todd gradually accepted Jessica's remarkable return, she was gone in an instant when Tess spitefully called him Uncle Rod. She wondered if he had noticed that she was as good a faker as he was. As Todd forcefully grabbed her again and began to shake her, Natalie and Jared arrived home. They immediately deemed Todd the culprit and demanded to know if he had hurt Jess. Both Todd and Tess quickly covered up, explaining that Todd was merely offering comfort. \n\n\nDelphina advised Langston that the person close to her shared blood and she was hearing the Columbian national anthem. Langston let on that both she and her mom had been born in Columbia but that her mom was an only child. Delphina was unable to learn anything else but mentioned that someone far away was talking about this person. \n\n\nAn agitated Natalie decided that she didn't want her father back if he were going to do something to hurt Langston. She wanted Jared to call Clint and tell him no.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex and Gigi agree to go back to Llanview and be parents to Shane. They visit with Noelle and Moe, at the Bon Jour cafe. They are not certain what to do but want to be a family with Shane. Tess is still Tess and has the goods on Todd. He also had the goods on her. Natalie finds out that Clint has put Jared up to helping him with a plan that could \"motivate\" Dorian by possibly hurting Langston. And she demands that he calls it off. And if that causes Clint to disown them both, so be it. In Mendorra, Talia, Antonio, Cristian and Sara orchestrate a plan to have reporters and media people believing that Carlo and Jonas are having a gay affair. And Antonio confirms to Carlo that it's all over now. He is taking Talia back to Llanview.",
    "soapcentral_condensed": "Don't Cry For Me, Mendorra is out now. It is the first of a two-part series about the town of Llanview, Texas. In it, Markko tries to convince Langston that Delphina is merely a phony. Rex and Gigi talk more about their future together before they leave Paris, Texas for Llan View, Texas, to be with Shane and Viki. Bo returns to his old job as the police commissioner, only to find the mayor had re-appointed him as the mayor's chief of police, with John Ramsey as the new chief of the police. The town is back on its feet, but the mayor has no respect for Bo and calls him a \"degraded\" man, prompting John to call a press conference to let everyone know what had happened while Bo was out of the town for a few weeks, and that he would be back in the job soon as soon as he was able to get back on his feet.\n"
