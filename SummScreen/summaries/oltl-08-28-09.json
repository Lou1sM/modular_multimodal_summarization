    "soap_central": "\nWho Am I, Anyway?\n\n\nWhen Layla awoke, Cristian greeted her in the kitchen. A concerned Cristian inquired about Layla's meeting with Fish.  Layla told Cristian that she had confronted Fish about engaging in a physical relationship with her, while hiding the fact that he was gay.   Explaining that Fish was in an emotional state when he left the apartment the night before, a worried Layla stated, \"He could have spent the night anywhere!\"\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Fish was stunned when he awoke and found himself in Stacy's bed.  When Fish inquired about what had taken place, Stacy proudly informed Fish that he had cheated on Layla.  Suffering from a serious hangover, Fish had a flashback of the previous night.  Fish remembered that Kyle had confronted him at Rodi's and accused Fish of interfering in Kyle's relationship with the guy from the gym.  Fish cringed when he recalled how Kyle had demanded that Fish admit that he was gay.\n\n\nWhile Kim tried to kick Fish out of the apartment, Stacy offered him comfort.  Stacy told Fish that he had been in desperate need of company at Rodi's.   Insisting that she had wanted to ease his pain, Stacy told Fish that they had shared an intimate night together.  As Stacy continued to flirt with him, Fish pulled away, and informed Stacy that she had no idea of who he really was.\n\n\nWhile a tormented Fish tried to remember the details of the previous night, Kim sought answers from Stacy.  Reminding Stacy that she had already seduced Fish, Kim was adamant that Stacy no longer had any need to keep Fish around, and questioned why Stacy hadn't sent Fish on his way.   With a sly look, Stacy related that she was still ovulating and wanted to have sex with Fish one more time just in case her attempt to conceive the night before had been unsuccessful.  Desperate for another opportunity, Stacy did her best to seduce Fish again.  Terrified, Fish related that he couldn't hurt another person, and raced out the door.\n\n\nLayla blamed herself for not realizing that Fish was gay.  Cristian listened as Layla recounted her conversation with Fish.  Layla stated that Fish initially denied his sexuality, but finally admitted that he had been romantically involved with Kyle in college.  While Layla appeared concerned about Fish's emotional state, Cristian criticized Fish for using Layla in an attempt to hide his secret.  Touched by Cristian's concern for her, Layla thanked him for being a good friend.  As Layla and Cristian shared an embrace, Fish entered the apartment.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Viki and Charlie met with Jessica, Natalie, Jared, and Brody.  Viki informed her family that she was considering a mayoral run.   Everyone was pleased to learn of Viki's venture, but she warned them that the life of a public official was difficult.  Viki informed her family that every aspect of their personal lives would be scrutinized.   Viki wondered if her family members were willing to live their lives in a fish bowl during her run for mayor.  \n\n\nAssuring Viki that they were willing to make the sacrifice, Jessica, Natalie, Jared, and Brody encouraged Viki to go ahead with her plans to run against the corrupt Mayor Lowell.  When Charlie mentioned that their family secrets were all known, Viki noticed her daughters' uneasiness.\n\n\nSensing that Jessica and Natalie were hiding something, Viki questioned if they were keeping secrets again.  Upon learning that someone was trying to convince the family that Nash was still alive, Viki became concerned.  Assuring their mother that Bo was handling the matter, Jessica and Natalie urged their mother to run for mayor.   After agreeing to throw her hat in the ring, Viki was appalled to see a headline in the Intruder that introduced Dorian as Mayor Lowell's new campaign manager.  Viki knew that Dorian would do her best to humiliate Viki.\n\n\nLater, Jessica, Natalie, Jared, and Brody exited Rodi's.   They discussed how the campaign would help the entire family move forward.  Brody believed that the stalker might leave the family alone once the campaign placed them in the spotlight.  As they walked away, someone stood in the bushes and observed them.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, while Dorian placed phone calls in support of Mayor Lowell, Blair phoned and interrupted Dorian's campaign work.  Dorian was disturbed when Blair proudly announced that she had arrived in Tahiti and was standing in front of Ross Rayburn's home.   Dorian advised Blair that Todd had won joint custody of the children and was no longer required to reside at La Boulaie.  Hoping to convince Blair to give up her plan of reuniting with Todd, Dorian revealed that Todd had spent the night with T\u00e9a.  Commenting that Todd had moved on, Dorian begged her niece to return home.  Blair refused, and set out to discover T\u00e9a's secret.\n\n\nUpon discovering Hope's picture in the Intruder, alongside Mayor Lowell, Starr lashed out at Dorian.  Refusing to allow Dorian to use Hope for political gain, Starr warned Dorian to back off.   Ignoring Starr's request, Dorian tried to convince Starr to use her experience as a teen mother to enhance the mayor's campaign.  Viki and Charlie arrived and interrupted the argument.   Dorian was speechless when Viki announced that she was running for mayor.  A smile crossed Starr's face.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Blair stared at Ross Rayburn's residence and exclaimed, \"I'm going to find out T\u00e9a's secret!\"  After knocking on the door and receiving no answer, Blair picked the lock and gained entry.  As Blair looked around, she was startled when Ross appeared. Ross immediately recognized Blair and questioned why she was in his home.  \n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a and Todd lay in bed after a night of passionate sex.   As the two proclaimed their love for each other, Todd received a call from Elijah, who informed Todd that the custody case had been resolved in Todd's favor.  When Todd remarked to T\u00e9a that he was free of Blair, Elijah asked to speak with T\u00e9a.  Claiming that Elijah probably wanted to discuss Matthew's case, she agreed to talk to Elijah, and sent Todd on a breakfast run.  Warning T\u00e9a that he was going to reveal her secret to Todd, Elijah assured her that Todd wouldn't be pleased when he learned the truth about her.  Before Todd left the house, he overheard an angry T\u00e9a remark, \"That isn't going to happen!\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Elijah that she had a proposal for Ross.  When Elijah related that Ross would never agree to T\u00e9a's terms, T\u00e9a became enraged.  As she screamed into the phone, Todd returned and witnessed her outburst.   Later, Todd tried to romance T\u00e9a, but she informed him that she had plans to pack and move back into the Palace.  To her surprise, Todd informed her that he wanted her to live with him permanently.\n\n\nBlair demanded that Ross reveal T\u00e9a's secret.  Ross claimed that he hadn't seen T\u00e9a since they were rescued from the island.  Unable to get answers from Ross, Blair threatened to contact John, her ex-husband with FBI ties.  The mention of a former FBI agent sent Ross into panic mode.  Cornered, Ross revealed, \"T\u00e9a is my wife!\"  Blair's jaw fell to the floor.\n\n\n Back at Todd's home, T\u00e9a was stunned when Todd proposed marriage to her.\n\n \n\n\n",
