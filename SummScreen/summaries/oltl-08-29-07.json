Then she asks him about his conversation with Todd, and he shows her the black eye Todd gave him. Miles says he thought Todd was going to kill him. Miles says he withheld the information because he thinks Todd is unstable, but Natalie says Todd is never that way around his kids. Miles says he has real information, but he doesn't know how to get it to Todd without Todd killing him. Natalie suggests telling Blair instead. \n\n\nBlair talks on the phone to Todd about the article on Lindsay in the Sun. She says he wrote a bloodthirsty article because of his fight with Miles, and Blair is worried about him. Dorian arrives in the kitchen with Lindsay's Woman of the Year trophy bowl. Dorian says she's taking charge of the award until the new recipient is found; Blair accuses her of stealing it. Dorian says she didn't. Dorian thinks she deserves the Woman of the Year award. Blair tells her to give it back, recounting how something bad always happens to the winner. Blair tells her about Miles' assertion that Todd's baby is alive and in Llanview, and how Todd beat Miles up after that. Dorian wonders if Miles might be telling the truth. Blair worries that if Miles is lying, then he will kill Miles. Natalie and Miles show up at La Boulaie and Blair asks if Miles has a death wish. Miles finds out about Lindsay's arrest. They try to tell Blair that Todd's baby is alive, and she tells them they can't get to Todd through her. They argue about how Miles has \"helped\" Todd so far. Natalie leaves. Miles tells her that Tommy is Todd's son and Blair is clearly shocked. \n\n\nLindsay is brought up from holding and claims she won't be saying a word to John, but it was really Bo that asked to see her. Lindsay says they have nothing to talk about, but Bo convinces her to talk to him, privately, in his office. Lindsay asks why he's being so nice to her and if he and John are playing \"good cop, bad cop\" with her. Bo says he doesn't believe that she killed Spencer, that she doesn't have a motive. Lindsay says she can't talk to Bo without a lawyer present. Bo remembers once when Lindsay says she had something to tell him; she refuses to answer. Lindsay thinks Nora is chomping at the bit to prosecute her. Bo says to help herself, and tell someone what's going on. Bo wants to help. Bo says most times, prior acts are inadmissible. Lindsay is unconvinced. Bo asks if Lindsay's admitting to the murder. She says no. Bo advises her to claim self-defense or to say she killed Spencer to stop him from hurting Blair. Then she thanks Bo for being kind to her, and she gives him condolences about Asa's passing. Lindsay says he doesn't owe her anything and she can take care of herself. Bo just wants to be her friend, and his offer of help stands. Bo has Lindsay returned to holding. \n\n\nNora comes into John's office and asks why he arrested Lindsay without notifying the DA's office. John shows her some evidence in the case, the bloody dress Lindsay was wearing the night of the Truman murder, and says the warrant was in order. Nora asks about the evidence and goes over the timeline with him, wanting to know why Lindsay would keep the dress. John says Lindsay is not cooperating but Nora will still get a good case. Then Nora pretends to be Lindsay's defense attorney, running a devil's advocate scenario with John. Nora tells him that if they press charges against Lindsay, Lindsay's lawyer will get Marty's eyewitness statement implicating Lindsay thrown out, and if they lose the statement, they've got nothing. Nora also says Marty isn't a good witness. John tells Nora that Lindsay went to see Spencer a few days before his murder. John insists that Lindsay did it; Nora says they don't have a prayer of getting a conviction with the current evidence. Nora says they need a motive, and he flashes back to his conversation with Lindsay, where she says she will protect Michael, Marcie, and Tommy. John hedges to Nora, saying Lindsay wanted to keep Spencer quiet about \"something\". Nora wonders why Lindsay was going to see Blair. Nora says without the something, they don't have a case. John doesn't have a motive, and Nora tells him to find it. Nora says there was a long list of people who wanted Spencer dead, and Lindsay was not on it. John gets the report on Lindsay's dress from the lab, and shows it to Nora. Nora says he was right: the blood is Spencer's. Nora wonders again why Lindsay would keep that dress around. Nora doesn't want to recuse herself from the case and she doesn't want anyone to think that she's trying to frame Lindsay, but something is going on in the case and Nora wants to know what it is. \n\n\nJohn tells Bo that the blood on Lindsay's dress belongs to Spencer. Nora says that they will proceed, based on the evidence, and the charges against Marty will be dropped. Marty will testify against Lindsay. \n\n\nAntonio prepares to paint his loft with Jamie, who remembers Jessica. Jamie and Antonio start painting her toy box. Talia arrives with a folder for Antonio, and Jamie asks Talia to help her paint. Antonio tries to give Talia an easy out, but she says she likes to paint, and asks Antonio for an extra tee shirt so she can paint with them. Jamie asks if Talia is going to be her daddy's new girlfriend. Antonio tells Jamie that Talia can't be his girlfriend because they work together, and they're friends, and besides, Talia has a boyfriend. Then he apologizes to Talia for Jamie's words. Then they paint his loft, getting into the inevitable paint accident with each other. Nash shows up at the door with an offer to get out of each other's lives. Antonio tells Nash that he sold his share to someone else. \n\n\nClint shows up to talk to Nash at the vineyard, wanting to take him to breakfast. Nash says he's too busy. Clint asks if Nash is having money trouble. Nash says no, it's just a cash flow problem. Clint threatens to call Jessica to find out what is going on, so Nash caves and says he needs money to buy out Antonio before he sells his share to the highest bidder. Clint asks Nash how much cash he has: Nash says none, and has to admit that he lost it all in a poker game. Nash says he got himself into this mess and he will figure a way to get himself out, but he won't take Jessica's money. Clint has a solution: take the money from him. Nash says that taking money from him is the same as taking money from Jessica. Clint says it's a loan, and Nash will be charged interest. Clint writes Nash a check. Clint says if Nash doesn't pay him back, he will send Natalie after him. Nash says \"not the crazy redhead,\" then asks Clint not to tell Jessica. Clint agrees. \n\n\n",

Talia comes to visit Antonio and finds them painting the living room. Both Jamie and Antonio encourage her to help. When Antonio is out of the room, Jamie asks Talia if she is going to be her daddy's new girlfriend. Talia is really surprised, but Antonio sets her straight. Clint gives Nash the money to buy the vineyard from Antonio. When Nash arrives at Antonio's, Nash finds out that Antonio had already sold his share of the vineyard. Lindsay has a heart to heart talk with Bo, but still will not divulge any info that John and Bo can use against her. John gets the info he needs to charge Lindsay with murder. They take the info to Bo. Miles lets Blair know that Todd's son is with Michael and Marcie and the boy's name is Tommy.",
