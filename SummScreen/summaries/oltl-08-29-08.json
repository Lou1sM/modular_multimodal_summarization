    "soap_central": "\nNot The Safe!\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair prepared for Sam's custody hearing. Fearing that Todd might gain custody, Blair expressed her love for the child to Dorian. Blair told Dorian that she didn't want to lose Sam and revealed that she loved him as if he were her own. Dorian sympathized with Blair and stated that Todd destroyed everything he touched. Blair asked Dorian to babysit Sam while she attended the hearing, and Dorian obliged. \n\n\nAlone with Sam, Dorian played with the child and told him how fortunate he was to have Blair in his life. Dorian told Sam that Blair felt the same love for him that Dorian felt for Langston. As Dorian stated that she considered Langston a Cramer girl, Langston appeared in the doorway. Langston reminded Dorian that she wasn't a Cramer girl - her lineage consisted of Wilde and Montez blood. Apologizing for ignoring Langston's true heritage, Dorian stated that she shared the same love for Langston as she did her own daughters. Acknowledging that Langston had no blood relatives, Dorian promised Langston that she would never be alone, because the Cramers were her family. Dorian was stunned when Langston said that she might have a living relative. Unable to keep the news to herself, Langston revealed Madame Delphina's claims - an uncle existed in South America. Although she didn't want to discourage Langston, Dorian felt it necessary to mention that Delphina had made a few mistakes in the past. Dorian told Langston that a true family consisted of those that had unconditional love for one another. \n\n\nAfter Dorian left, Langston turned her attention to her computer. Gaining access to a search engine entitled \"Family Find,\" Langston entered the name \"Montez.\" \n\n\nBefore heading to the custody hearing, Todd checked in on Marty. Still upset over John's search of the house, Marty feared that John would harm her. Worried that Jessica might reveal her whereabouts to John, Marty stated that she needed to get well so she could defend herself. Todd assured Marty that Jess would never confide in John, and promised that he would never allow John to hurt her again. Todd asked Marty if she trusted him. She replied, \"Probably more than I should!\" \n\n\nAt the courthouse, Blair spoke with the social worker. Meanwhile, Todd showed up late with several demands for his lawyer. Todd insisted on receiving custody of Sam and demanded to have the restraining order lifted so that he could see his children. \n\n\nInside the courtroom, the social worker spoke highly of Blair and told the judge that Sam was thriving in the Cramer home. Todd interrupted the proceedings several times and was warned by the judge. Fed up with Todd's antics, the judge asked if Todd had attended his anger management classes and enrolled in driving school. When Todd's lawyer informed the judge that Todd had been preoccupied and hadn't completed his court-ordered assignments, the judge ruled that Blair would retain custody of Sam. Stating that Todd had violated his restraining order several times and refused to allow Child Services to conduct a home visit, the judge ordered him to complete the orders of the court. He advised Todd that if met the requirements within a year, he could file for custody again. \n\n\nAfter the proceedings, Blair suggested that Todd re-examine his life. Unwilling to listen to Blair's assessment of his life, Todd advised her that he would see his children again. \n\n\nTodd returned home and spoke with Marty. He told Marty that he had lost custody of Sam, but received some good news. Todd claimed that Starr had agreed to allow him to raise her unborn child. \n\n\nIn the police commissioner's office, John told Bo that he suspected Jessica of helping Todd hide the mystery woman, who disappeared from Ramsey's apartment on the night of his murder. John related that he believed Jess faked false labor pains in order to create a diversion for Todd. Bo was shocked to learn that Jess would act as an accomplice, but acknowledged that Jess had been behaving strangely since Nash's death. John informed Bo that he intended to prosecute Todd once he gained enough evidence to link him to the crime. Explaining that he wanted to assure the case wasn't botched, John insisted that he couldn't protect any accessories, including Jess. Bo refused to believe his niece could be involved, but gave John the go-ahead to proceed with the investigation. Believing Jess would be truthful with him, Bo offered to question his niece about her possible role in the crime. As John headed off to investigate further, Bo warned him to be cautious. Bo reminded John that the mayor would cause problems if he discovered that John had reopened Ramsey's murder case. \n\n\nJohn noticed one of the mayor's assistants with a box filled with evidence involving Ramsey's murder investigation. The assistant informed John that the mayor requested that the evidence be placed into storage. After convincing the detective to allow him to sign for the materials, John intercepted a security tape. The tape contained surveillance surrounding Ramsey's building. The date on the tape was the night of Ramsey's murder. \n\n\nIn the library of Llanfair, Natalie and Jared argued relentlessly. Upset that Jared accepted Clint's request to locate Langston's uncle, Natalie demanded that Jared call Clint and refuse to do her father's dirty work. Jared told Natalie that he felt obligated to do everything in his power to help the family regain control of Buchanan Enterprises from Dorian. Disgusted that Clint and Jared would use Langston to get revenge on Dorian, Natalie insisted that the child had suffered enough and didn't need further conflict in her life. Meanwhile, in the foyer, Tess exploded when she discovered Leo, the carpenter, at the front door. Screaming, Tess reminded Leo that she had instructed him to use the back entrance. As Tess berated Leo, Tina observed from the staircase. Unnoticed, Tina appeared suspicious of her niece. When Tess ordered Leo to use the back entrance, Tina approached and asked if she could be of assistance. Glaring at Tina, Tess explained that she had hired Leo \"the electrician\" to install lights in the kitchen. While Tess attempted to cover her tracks, Natalie and Jared's intense conversation poured out into the foyer. Thankful for the diversion, Tess sent Leo off to finish his work. As Tina tried to keep an eye on Leo, Tess motioned for Tina to help her referee the argument between Natalie and Jared. \n\n\nTess was curious to learn what was upsetting her sister. Natalie explained that Clint had asked Jared to go on a business trip. When Tess discovered that the trip was designed to help B.E. and that Natalie objected, she suggested that Jared go anyway. Natalie was obviously annoyed by her sister's interference. Attempting to calm the situation, Tina offered her opinion, which led to a shouting match between Tina and Tess. Frustrated with her family's meddling, Nat demanded that they stay out of her affairs. When Tina asked Tess why the electrician was in the basement with the door locked, Tess made up a lie and began to scold Tina for butting into her business. Stating that he had a plane to catch, Jared attempted to kiss Natalie goodbye but she turned away. Once Jared had left, Tina tried to console Nat. Refusing any comfort, Nat said that she had some business to take care of and stormed out of the house. While Tina appeared worried, Tess turned away and laughed hysterically. A confused Tina stared at her niece. \n\n\nAfraid that Tina was watching, Tess continued to give Leo other jobs to do around the house, in hopes of throwing Tina off her trail. Fed up with Tess's ridiculous requests, Leo stated that Tess was making his job difficult to perform. Demanding that Leo follow her orders, Tess pushed him into the library and closed the door. Tina watched from the staircase. Inside the library, Tess chastised Leo about finishing the job quickly. As Leo walked toward the door, he stopped and observed a painting on the wall. Although unknown to Leo, the painting was hung over the safe that contained Tina's jewels. Bolting into the library, Tina screamed, \"No! Not the safe!\" A curious Tess observed her aunt's nervous demeanor. Realizing that she had said too much, Tina ran out into the foyer. Tess followed and inquired why Tina was concerned about the safe. After Tina gave Tess a flimsy excuse about taking safety precautions, an unconvinced Tess joined Leo back in the library. \n\n\nTina tried to convince herself that she hadn't revealed her secret to Jessica. Meanwhile, in the library, Tess gave Leo more orders. As the two argued, the library doors opened. Bo entered the room and asked his niece what was going on. \n\n\nAt the airport, Jared stared at a photo of Langston. To his surprise, Natalie appeared and insisted that they talk. Jared defended his actions. Citing that he was to blame for Dorian taking control of B.E., Jared wanted to help the family take back the company. He pleaded with Nat to understand that his actions could result in regaining the inheritance for Jess's children and possibly helping the family get over Nash's death. Nat understood Jared's position and begged him to be careful. After expressing her love for him, Nat pleaded with Jared not to do anything that would cause harm to Langston or himself. Jared assured Nat that he didn't want to hurt Langston in any way. He promised that his actions wouldn't cause Langston any pain. His only concern was convincing Dorian to return the company to the Buchanans. Jared and Nat kissed goodbye.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd and Blair have a custody hearing for Sam. The judge rules in her favor without hardly an argument from either of their lawyers and believes Todd is a menace to society. he is upset for a while. But when he returns to Marty, he informs her that Starr has agreed to let him raise her baby. Tess is having the contractor do his \"remodeling\" in the basement but makes certain that nobody else has access and that it's locked so nobody knows what is going on. Tina asks what is going on. Natalie and Jared also find it odd. Natalie goes with Jared to the airport after Clint has asked him to go to South America to find out some way to \"motivate\" Dorian by using Langston. But she tells him she is not going to accept him doing anything that could hurt a teenage girl. Meanwhile, Langston and Dorian talk together and seem to have some sort of \"premonition\" about extended family that Langston may have that she's never heard about.",
