She was certain that Kim had an agenda, though Clint retorted that there was no gold left to dig, thanks to Rex. He was happy to see Kim, but Natalie really didn't want her father to have anything to do with Kim, and she didn't plan to be around the stripper herself.\n\n\nJessica encountered Todd as he was about to leave Llanfair, but she stopped him from leaving. She really wanted to have a chat, and she wondered what Todd was up to. Todd was in a hurry, and he maintained that it was Clint who was making him feel uneasy. Jessica offered to help her uncle, claiming that Clint was really a \"pussycat.\" Jessica tried to engage Todd in some chit-chat, but finally, Todd gently pushed Jessica aside and headed for the front door.\n\n\nJessica walked into the study just as Natalie was exclaiming that she would move out if the bitch were to stay at Llanfair. Assuming that Natalie was referring to her, Jessica announced that she was tired of hearing Natalie talk about moving out. She was also tired of having herself referred to in that manner. She wondered why Natalie was still around.\n\n\nNatalie explained that she'd been referring to Kim, but she suggested that Jessica should be the one to move out instead. The sisters proceeded to have words, as Clint did his best to try to stop the young women from arguing about the same old things again. Natalie informed Jessica that Kim had shown up to make another play for Clint, and Natalie thought that they should toss Kim out of the house.\n\n\nOutside of Rodi's, Kim paused to look at a photo of herself with Stacy, and then she placed a phone call to an unknown person. She wanted to check on the mysterious woman in the hospital bed. Kim referred to the person on the phone as \"Ratched\" and declared that she would take care of the hospital bill soon.\n\n\nKim ended the call. She turned and bumped into Shaun, who was headed into Rodi's to pick up his order. She demanded that he stay away from her, and she called him an oaf. Shaun noted that Kim had no manners, and she sounded just like Stacy. Kim retorted, \"Stacy Morasco is the best person I know.\" \"Don't you mean was?\" Shaun inquired.\n\n\nKim stuttered and explained that she still thought of Stacy as being alive, especially because her body had not been found. Shaun understood, and he inquired whether Kim had heard about Gigi. The pair agreed that it was sad that the women had both died so young. Shaun went into Rodi's.\n\n\nKim made another phone call and apologized to the person for the Cuckoo's Nest reference. She promised to take care of the bills.\n\n\nInside, Dani and Destiny were comparing their new school schedules, but Dani seemed preoccupied. After Destiny called her on it, Dani admitted that she'd been thinking about her two dads. She told Destiny about the fight she'd had with Starr, though they had eventually settled things.\n\n\nStarr had accused Dani of being loyal to Victor, but Dani had explained that she wasn't familiar with the new Todd who'd shown up in Llanview. Dani also recalled Starr's comment that the two men would be dangerous if cornered. Destiny advised her friend that she wasn't in it alone. Dani mentioned that her mother still loved Victor, though Dani felt that the father she'd known was scared that he would lose everyone.\n\n\nDestiny asked Dani to sleep over, in order for T\u00e9a and Victor to have some time alone to talk. The girls saw Shaun, and he informed them that he was in the midst of packing. He was taking Vivian on a vacation to Costa Rica. He looked at Dani and asked the teen if she were feeling okay. Dani assured him that she was fine.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair found Jack studying a typed piece of paper, and she grabbed it from him when Jack wouldn't reveal its contents. Jack snatched it back and told his mother that it was none of her business. Blair had seen the contents, and she asked Jack about the donation requests for the Gigi Morasco Scholarship Fund.\n\n\nJack admitted that it had been his idea to establish the fund, after learning that Gigi had been attending college when she'd died. He wanted to honor her, and he thought it would be a good tax break for his father. Blair wondered why Jack had chosen to honor Gigi out of everything that was available, and she thought it was time for Jack to talk about what had happened. She asked him how he felt. Blair knew that her son had a big and sensitive heart underneath the tough exterior.\n\n\nBlair was aware that her son had no one to talk to, and she knew that he felt terrible. \"I promise I'll always listen to you,\" Blair told him. She could be trusted, contrary to what Jack's father had stated. Jack mentioned that \"Scarface\" wasn't a saint either, as Jack had seen him stealing something from the safe. \"No, he couldn't have,\" Blair gasped.\n\n\nBlair jumped up to check Dorian's safe. \"It's gone,\" Blair uttered. She promised to continue her conversation with Jack at a later time. Blair placed a call to T\u00e9a and hurriedly left a message. She explained that she thought Todd had a gun. Jack overheard.\n\n\nJohn led Irene into the outer office at the police station and advised her that the Feds were on their way to pick her up. Irene pretended to be scared, and she advised John that she wanted her phone call. John admitted that he was disappointed. He'd expected Irene to be a terror, but she'd only been acting like a \"common crook.\" He wondered who she would even have to call.\n\n\nAt his Sun office, Victor insisted that he wouldn't give up. \"Bring it on,\" he said, referring to Todd. His brother wanted his life and company. T\u00e9a reminded Victor that technically, everything really belonged to Todd in the first place. While Todd really lacked a legal identity, though, he wouldn't be able to take anything away from Victor, T\u00e9a clarified.\n\n\nVictor didn't doubt that Todd would find a way to take what he thought belonged to him, and Victor wanted a restraining order against Todd. T\u00e9a suggested that perhaps the two men should get to know each other instead, but Victor chuckled. \"Are you serious?\" he asked. They were interrupted when Victor's phone began to ring.\n\n\n\"Hello, junior. It's your mother,\" Irene said. She wanted Victor's help. Victor suggested that she not hold her breath, but then he changed his mind and urged her to do so. Irene advised Victor that if he helped her to be released from jail, she would help him in return. \"I know what's good for you. I'm your mother,\" Irene declared.\n\n\nLater, Todd made his way into the office at the newspaper and found T\u00e9a lying on the sofa. She jumped up when she heard him and informed him that he wasn't supposed to be there. She explained that Victor had gone to visit Irene. Todd jumped on T\u00e9a's information, and he accused Victor of being in on things with Irene all along.\n\n\nT\u00e9a confirmed that Victor hated Irene just as much as Todd did. T\u00e9a made it clear that Victor had received a phone call from Irene, and Irene had some kind of weird hold on Victor. Sarcastically, Todd declared that Irene was going to \"sic\" Victor on him.\n\n\nTodd admitted that he'd had no idea what Irene had wanted from him during the eight years he'd been captive. He had been asked the same questions over and over. Apparently, he'd had something that Irene had wanted, but Todd had never had a clue as to what that something was. He didn't care any longer, and he preferred to use his energy towards something more positive. He wanted to get acquainted with his new granddaughter, and his new daughter. He'd rather have his family.\n\n\nT\u00e9a pointed out that the men were like two peas in a pod, and they were both paranoid. Todd thought that he had plenty of reason to be paranoid after he'd been replaced and almost killed. T\u00e9a replied that Irene had wanted to kill Victor also. She didn't think that Irene was finished with Todd, but Todd declared that he was done with Irene. T\u00e9a disagreed. She believed that Todd needed to find out why Irene had done what she had.\n\n\nJohn was surprised to see Victor at the station, and he wondered why the man was visiting his prisoner. \"A good son always respects his mother's wishes,\" Irene announced. She advised Victor that he'd always been her favorite son. John didn't want Victor there, but Victor insisted that he'd only talk to Irene for a minute. Then he would never return. John agreed to give Victor ten minutes.\n\n\n\"You're going to get me out of here,\" Irene advised Victor. He retorted that maybe he would get all the charges dropped while he was there too. Irene vowed that she would help Victor, but she was unable to do that while she was behind bars. Irene was certain that Todd planned to take everything away from Victor. First it was Viki, then it would be Victor's children, and finally Blair and T\u00e9a, Irene goaded Victor.\n\n\nAs Victor spoke to Irene, Brody arrived. He advised John that he'd visited with Shane, and the teen wasn't doing too well. Shane had been consumed with the idea of getting back at the Mannings. \"Maybe there's a way we can make that happen,\" Brody suggested.\n\n\nJohn assured Brody that \"Victor-Todd\" would pay. Victor's tracks might have been covered, but they'd be there when he slipped up, John added. Brody was concerned that it wouldn't be soon enough.\n\n\nVictor proclaimed that he didn't want any more help from Irene, and he would never help her. Irene continued to taunt him. She told him that he would lose everything to Todd. Victor declared that he'd fought harder battles than that, though Irene replied that she was the one who'd made Victor the way that he was. Victor acknowledged that she'd made him into a freak.\n\n\nIrene continued that if Victor believed he was a freak, he'd been even more of a freak previously. He'd been a physical, emotional, and mental \"runt,\" she declared. Victor's success was due to her, and she predicted that he would fail all alone because he would have abandoned his mother. She advised Victor that she would still love him, but she'd be the only one.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Natalie argued that she was only trying to protect her father, but Jessica accused Natalie of always interfering. The sisters began to argue again, and Jessica referred to Natalie as the \"town tramp,\" comparing Natalie to Kim. Jessica felt that neither woman had much self-respect.\n\n\nJessica received a phone call from Blair, who was looking for Todd. Jessica explained that he wasn't there, and he'd been in a hurry to leave the house.\n\n\nBrody phoned Natalie, but she advised him that she couldn't talk. She told him loudly that she was ready to sign for the apartment that they'd visited together. She thought it would be the perfect place for their family, and she needed to get out of Llanfair. Jessica and Clint were both surprised. Natalie went to pack her things, and she snapped that her room could be given to Kim.\n\n\nClint was tired of hearing his girls argue, and he wished that they could \"peacefully coexist.\" Jessica didn't think that would be possible, and she pointed out that the relationship between the sisters was comparable to that of Clint and Bo. Clint was adamant that his girls not be like him and his brother. Jessica had to admit that she agreed with Natalie though. She was certain that Kim wanted Clint back.\n\n\nAfter listening to Irene ramble on, Victor began to hug his mother. After a short time, he wrapped his hands around her throat and began to choke her instead. John rushed over to pull Victor away from Irene. John couldn't believe that Victor had allowed Irene to manipulate him again. He urged Victor to leave the station right away.\n\n\nBefore he left, Victor remembered that he owed John something. John replied that they were even, but Victor stated that they weren't. They would be, though, Victor added. Brody glared at Victor. John received a phone call that the Feds had arrived for Irene.\n\n\nAs Victor left, Irene called out that he should visit her again. The next time, he should have his children with him. She added that children were vulnerable. Brody stopped Victor and asked why Victor had been talking to John.\n\n\nBrody wondered if Victor planned on keeping his arrangement with Brody. Victor admitted that he'd been rethinking the deal. He didn't think one should keep a man away from the truth. Brody toyed with his gun.\n\n\nStill in the office at the Sun, Todd asked T\u00e9a if she were friendly with Blair. T\u00e9a received a phone call and learned that Victor was on his way. She turned to tell Todd, but he was gone. Todd stood outside of the office and looked at his gun.\n\n\nShane stormed into the house, with Rex following close behind. Shane was angry that Rex had arranged to have Gigi's body exhumed, and he also demanded to know when the Mannings would pay for her death. Shane stormed upstairs, and Rex headed over to his safe and opened it. He eyed his gun. He was determined to get justice.\n\n\nVictor returned home and was surprised to find Jack waiting for him. The teenager was almost hysterical. Jack advised Victor that Todd had a gun, and there was no time. Todd wanted Victor dead. Victor pointed out that the description applied to other people, as well, but Jack felt that it only applied to one person in particular at that moment.\n\n\nJack informed Victor that he'd seen \"Scarface\" steal the gun, though he'd thought the man had been taking money at the time. Jack had confronted Todd, but Todd had gone into how they should get to know each other. Jack still planned to call Victor his father, and he wanted to get Victor away. Victor insisted that he wasn't going anywhere. \"Don't worry. No one's gonna kill me,\" Victor assured Jack as a tear ran down Victor's face.\n\n\nBrody spent some time with Liam at Llanfair. He held the baby and told him how exciting it was that they would finally be in their own place. Brody couldn't let anyone interfere with that plan, especially Victor Lord, Jr. The man was a bad guy, and Brody was afraid that Victor would tell John the truth.\n\n\nBrody chattered on. He told Liam about playing the \"Navy SEAL card,\" and he'd told Victor that he could make Victor disappear. Brody wasn't pleased with himself for saying that, but he hadn't had a choice.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When John releases Irene from jail, she calls current Todd to tell him that she can \"help\" him knowing he will depend on her for help as it's only a matter of time before all the people in his life realize he's an imposter and forget all about him while original Todd reunites with them. And she knows she can motivate him to keep her out of jail. But current Todd does not want to cooperate with her nor see her as his mother. Brody is at the station observing Todd's animosity and reminds Todd that they have a \"deal\" where it would not be in Todd's best interest to tell John that he and not Brody is Liam's father knowing what Brody knows about Todd's secrets. Natalie and Jessica both affirm that they do not care for nor respect each other and don't want to reconcile although Clint tells his two daughters he'd like them to reconsider instead of behaving as he did with his brother, Bo. Kimberly is still on the prowl in Llanview, with a \"motive\" to reconnect with Clint. And she reveals to Shaun when she sees him outside of Buenos Dias, that Stacy may be alive.",
