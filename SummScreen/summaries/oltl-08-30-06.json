Kelly was angry that Kevin thought he would just drag her back home. The doctor came in and told her to relax to keep her blood pressure down. Kevin left Kelly to relax and went to the hall with the doctor. She told Kevin that Kelly desperately wants to have the baby and that he should help her however he can. An affected Kevin went back into Kelly's room and smiled as she slept. He told her that he was sorry for everything he did. Kelly woke up. He said he understands why she felt she needed to get away and that he knows how much she wants to have the baby. \"Whatever you need to make you feel safe, That's I what I want to give you,\" he said. \"That's why I'm here, if that's okay.\" She asked him to stay and listen to the baby's heartbeat with her, which the doctor said sounds strong and healthy.\n\n\nJohn arrested Spencer. \"You've got nothing,\" Spencer said as they put cuffs on him.\n\n\nDavid met Paige and told her Spencer had been arrested. They headed to the police station to witness it.\n\n\nEvangeline went to the penthouse to talk to Todd. She said she was worried about him since his outburst at the gala. He told her that he learned that the whole Blair and Spencer deal was a ruse, just as he'd always expected. They found out that Spencer was busted and headed down to the station to see it.\n\n\nSpencer taunted each and every person at the station there to see him go down. He reminded Todd that he'd be dead and buried if it weren't for him. John read the lengthy list of charges to Spencer and then had him taken away. He shot a desperate look at Blair as they dragged him off. John told the cops to search everywhere for the gun that shot his father.\n\n\nNash showed up at Llanfair. He was upset that they planned the integration therapy without telling him. Jessica got upset and stormed off. Antonio followed her. Viki told Nash no one was trying to shut him out, but that it was up to Jessica to decide whether he was part of what happens to her or not.\n\n\nJessica told Antonio that she's ready to be integrated now. She warned Antonio that after integration, even if Tess is gone forever, she will never be the same. \"If I'm not, will you still want me?\" she asked. Antonio said of course he would. Jessica then went back to Nash and said she needed to speak to him alone. She told Nash that she was sorry but Tess was going to be gone forever. \"I know how much you love Tess, I can feel it inside,\" she said. \"But I'm not Tess. And I don't love you.\" She said she can't let Tess out for him to say good-bye. Nash grabbed her and kissed her. She told him she is so sad for him and Tess and asked him to be there for the integration session no matter what Antonio thinks. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John comes into Spencer's apartment with an officer. He is cuffed and he smiles as he is being cuffed. He is sure that he will be out in no time. Blair assures him that she will have him out of jail the following day. \"I want to speak to my fiancee in private.\" John will not allow it. Spencer taunts John that he is doing this for the media attention and that he can suck it up all he wants but it won't be for long. Spencer is led out and Blair calls Spencer to tell him that Spencer has been arrested. Todd wants to know that Blair told Spencer the truth about her not really loving him. She hasn't done that yet. She wants to make sure that this is over before she comes clean to Spencer. Nat is sad. She tells Bo that she failed her exam. She was too wrapped up in the investigations and John and didn't stay focused enough. Hugh gives the word that their prisoner has arrived. David and Paige arrive happy as clams. Todd and Evangeline arrive next. Blair is the last to come in and she smiles at Todd when she sees him. Jessica arrives home. Everyone knows that the time is close. Her integration time is near. She is remembering the abuse and that is the major clue. She warns Antonio that she might not be the same person at the end of this. He assures her that he doesn't care, they will work this out. She talks alone to Nash next. He can see that she is telling him goodbye. She is sorry that she can't let Tess out to say goodbye to him. He doesn't let her finish her speech and he suddenly grabs her and kisses her. She is sorry for he and Tess. She has a session the next day and she invites Nash to it. 'Simple Assault, Dealing in Infant Children, Obstruction, Abuse of Corpse, Kidnapping, Intimidation of Witnesses, Conspiracy There are just some of the charges that are going to be tossed at Spencer. He jokingly turns to David for support but there isn't any. He reminds Paige that she has made mistakes herself and they will never go away. \"Go to hell!\" is how she responds. Spencer remarks that Hugh isn't having such a great career. First he puts an innocent man on death row and now this. He assures the Commish that none of this will stick. He is sure that Todd only wants to see him in jail because he's been having sex with Blair. \"You will never have her,\" Spencer sneers. \"I already do,\" Todd retorts. John has lots of charges, but there is one that isn't on there that he wants. \"We have to get a warrant for his office, hotel room and anywhere else the bastard hangs out. We have to find that gun!\"",
