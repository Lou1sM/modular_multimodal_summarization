Todd didn't believe him, and he was sure that Greg was lying. He wanted to know where the body was, but Greg told him there was none. Todd accused Greg of hiding something, and he threatened to harm Greg if he didn't show them T\u00e9a's body. Greg assured them that T\u00e9a had died peacefully, and the last thing she had seen was a photo of Todd and Dani.\n \n\nDani began to hyperventilate as Todd accused Greg of setting things up. He grabbed Greg and shoved him into the wall. Greg and Todd continued to argue, and Shaun broke them up. Todd thought that Shaun was in on the deceit. Shaun denied it, and Todd declared that Greg was \"playing us.\" He was sure that T\u00e9a was there. Dani had to sit down. She told her father that she believed Greg and Shaun. They were too late, and her mother had died alone. Todd continued to ask to see the body, but Greg finally disclosed that it had been T\u00e9a's wish to be cremated.\n \n\nGreg was sorry for Dani and Todd's loss. He and Shaun left the room. Dani began to cry as Todd comforted her. Greg thanked Shaun for pulling Todd off of him, but Shaun told his brother that he had instincts. He believed that Greg was concealing something.\n \n\nClint paid a visit to Dorian's bedroom at La Boulaie. He announced that he had something for her from David. Dorian was disturbed that Clint was allowed into her home, but Clint confessed that Dorian's maid liked him better than she liked Dorian. He had heard that David left Dorian, and he was concerned. He proceeded to quote from memory, various paragraphs in David's letter. Dorian demanded to know how Clint knew details from her very private letter, and he claimed that Viki had told him about it, since she was worried about Dorian.\n \n\nClint revealed that he felt responsible for the entire ordeal, since he was the one who \"blew the whistle\" on his phony romance with Dorian. David had then gone back to Dorian. It was because of Kimberly that Clint had pushed David and Dorian back together, Dorian believed. Clint handed her a box from Logan's Department Store. It contained a ring that David had wanted to give Dorian on their honeymoon. Clint had it because David had charged it to Clint's account, he said. The store had called Clint about it.\n \n\nDorian denied that she wanted it, but he left it on the desk for her as he walked towards the door. He confirmed that his name would still be on the stadium. He confided that he would want to \"skin him alive\" for what David had done if he were Dorian. He offered to take Dorian to lunch, but then mentioned that she was the popular subject of the early morning talk radio shows that day. \"People are cruel,\" he uttered. Dorian headed back to bed, and Clint declared he would tell the maid not to let anyone disturb Dorian. He chuckled on his way out. Dorian got out to look at the ring again, but she put it down abruptly and climbed back into bed.\n \n\nMatthew ran into Destiny at the country club, and she advised him to look for her if he needed anything. She didn't want him to accost Nate when Nate was worried about Dani. She wanted Matthew to leave Nate alone. She pointed out that Matthew had changed, and it wasn't in a good way. He asked what she meant, and Destiny stated that Matthew seemed to have gone over to the \"dark side.\"\n \n\nMatthew swore he had just had a few bad days and had been dumped, but Destiny warned him to be careful. She thought the trait could be genetic, and she pointed out the attributes of both Asa and Clint. Plus, David had just deserted Dorian at the altar for the second time, she added.\n \n\nMatthew inquired if he and Destiny were still friends. Destiny assured him they were but to \"beware of the dark side.\" Matthew promised he would only \"use it for good.\" Later, he lay on a chaise longue but realized there was someone standing over him. It was Clint, and he thought it was time that he and Matthew had a talk.\n \n\nCristian and Layla tried to figure out when they should have their wedding, especially since Layla wanted to be sure that her mother enjoyed it. When there was a knock at their door, Layla assumed it was the sample invitations she had been waiting for. Cristian was astonished that the package delivery was for him instead. It was from the Llanview University art department and they had extended him a grant, use of a private studio, and the ability to display his artwork. He would also be able to teach. Layla admitted that she had been the one to apply for the grant, since she had experience in that area.\n \n\nSomeone knocked at the door again, and Layla was sure it was her invitations. It was her turn to be stunned as she looked at a huge box with a return address in Paris. It was from Layla's favorite designer, and it turned out to be her wedding dress, the one she had designed and never believed she would have. It was entirely too expensive, but it was her dream dress. Cristian confessed he had found the sketch and sent a copy to Adriana, who had gotten a good deal on it. He just had to see the finished dress on Layla. \n \n\nThe couple couldn't believe the steps they had taken for each other. They made love, and Layla announced that they had to get married before all of the college co-eds had a look at Cristian. She wanted to call Adriana, and she urged Cristian to jump in the shower. When he returned, Layla told him about her phone call to Adriana. The designer had loved Layla's work and wanted her to work with him. She would be able to create her own designs and would be his first assistant. Cristian knew it was her dream job, and he was ecstatic. She would have to move to Paris, Layla told him reluctantly.\n \n\nJohn, Rex, and Kelly stood in John's office at the police station. They had all arrived at the conclusion that Blair and Eli were in Tahiti, but no one had been able to reach her on the phone. Kelly was certain that Eli had sabotaged Blair's cell phone. John assumed that Eli had a plan and wouldn't remain there for any length of time. He had probably already chosen another identity for after he killed Blair. A worried Kelly steadfastly believed that they had to move quickly.\n \n\nA female police officer interrupted the trio and handed John a document. John noted that Ross was apparently still alive, and the utilities had been in use at his house in Tahiti. There were cancelled checks, and someone had been paying the bills. He explained that they had never found Ross's body. John thought it was time he had a discussion with Bo, and he warned Kelly and Rex not to touch anything when he left the office. While John was gone, the police officer returned and placed a file on John's desk. It had additional information on Ross along with his cell phone number.\n \n\nKelly, worried that they would be too late to save Blair, asked Rex to get her some water. As soon as he was gone, she rushed to the file and dialed Ross's telephone number.\n \n\nIn Tahiti, the wedding ceremony concluded, though Blair hesitated before repeating the vows. Ross snapped a photo of the happy couple and made a toast. He hoped Blair made Eli happy for as long as they lived. Blair couldn't wait to get home to check on Dani, and Eli promised they would be on the next flight out of Tahiti. The only problem was that the flight wasn't until later in the evening, he revealed. Ross handed his brother the photo and told the newlyweds to enjoy the house for their brief honeymoon. He wanted Blair to tell Dani he loved her, then gathered his belongings and headed outside. He didn't see his cell phone laying on the floor.\n \n\nOutside of the house, Eli thanked Ross for his help in the marriage plan, because he hadn't thought Blair was going to go through with it. Ross believed that one had to \"go for the gold\" and \"pull out all the stops\" to get something they wanted. Eli declared that Blair would not be stepping onto the plane, and he was certain that he had things \"smoothed out.\" Ross was ready to leave but realized he had misplaced his phone.\n \n\nInside, Ross's phone began to ring, and a shocked Blair answered it. She had believed that there wasn't any phone service available. It was a poor connection at first, but Blair heard Kelly on the other end. Kelly spoke quickly and urgently and tried to update Blair on the fact that whatever Kelly had told her previously about Eli was true. They had proof. Blair told her to \"give it up,\" but Kelly was adamant. John was prepared to get the warrant thanks to Kelly's finding a mug shot of Eli with a different name on it.\n \n\nKelly explained that Eli, known as Craig, had murdered his first wife and then changed his name to Bennett. Olivia was his second wife, and she had disappeared and was presumed dead. He then changed his name to Eli. Kelly had obtained the phone number from the police. Rex returned and found Kelly on the phone, but just then, the transmission ended.\n \n\nEli found Blair with the phone and asked about the call. He assumed it was a local call for Ross.  He grabbed the phone and looked at it. Back outside with Ross, he saw it was a restricted call and figured it was an international call. Ross declared that he knew lots of people overseas, but Eli knew that they couldn't take any chances. \"You know what we have to do,\" he said. He returned to Blair and asked her who called.\n \n\n\"Olivia Thompson, your wife,\" Blair retorted. Eli was calm and looked properly confused, but he articulated that Blair was his wife. He hadn't even been married before, he reminded her. He thought that Kelly was crazy, and Blair was listening to what Kelly had said. Blair asked about Craig instead, but Eli asked brusquely who had been on the phone. Blair revealed it wasn't Oliva or Eli's first wife, because he had killed them. \"Now you're gonna kill me, too, aren't you?\" she asked. \n \n\nJohn returned to his office with the news that the cops in Tahiti were on the way to Ross's house. He saw the open file on his desk. \"Tell me you didn't call Rayburn's number,\" he shouted. Kelly admitted that she had and had spoken to Blair. John asked for details of the call, and Kelly pronounced that she had told Blair everything, but the phone went dead. John wondered if Eli had heard Blair on the call. John answered his phone, received the word, and hung up. He advised Rex and Kelly that the cops were at the house and had arrested Eli.\n \n\nIn Tahiti, the cops were face-to-face with Ross. They asked for Eli. \"You got me,\" Ross replied.\n\n\n",

Meanwhile, Destiny tells Matthew she's concerned that he might be going to the \"dark side\" and turning into somebody not unlike Asa or Clint. He tells her he does not think ill of them.
