    "soap_central": "\n\n\"Dad?\" Shane uttered as he saw Rex standing in their study. There was an approaching thunderstorm. Rex was illuminated when lightning lit up the room, and cast eerie shadows. Rex had been looking at his gun. Shane asked the reason for Gigi's exhumation, but Rex revealed that it wasn't easy to explain.\n\n\nShane interrupted as Rex tried to get his thoughts in order. Shane advised his father that he thought he knew the reason for what Rex had done. Rex had been looking for a clue to link Jack to Gigi's death. Shane had wanted the same thing as Rex. \"I didn't find what I was looking for, Shane,\" Rex advised his son.\n\n\nShane admitted that he'd asked Brody to organize a \"sting\" in order to nab Jack for Gigi's death, because Rex had never made the Mannings pay like he had promised. Shane was sorry for overstepping, but Rex understood. He'd made promises, and Shane had been grieving. Rex had gotten sidetracked, but he would see to it that Victor and Jack were punished. Rex would make certain of it.\n\n\nShane inquired whether Rex had been planning something when he'd traveled out of town. Rex revealed that it had been a wasted trip, but he was working on something. Shane didn't think it was enough. His mother was dead, the Mannings were alive, and it wasn't fair. Rex suggested that Shane go to bed, though the teen admitted that he hadn't been able to sleep since his mother's death. Rex promised that things would get better.\n\n\nBlair tried to reach Todd on the phone, without success. She ran for the door and bumped into Starr. \"Have you seen your father?\" Blair asked. \"Which one?\" Starr replied. Blair stated that she had been anxious to locate the real Todd, and she ran out the front door of La Boulaie just as James walked inside. Starr explained that her mother had gone off to find her dad, the one with the scar. James noted how weird it was for Starr to clarify her statement.\n\n\nStarr confessed that the dad situation had grown easier after meeting up with her real dad. \"Something clicked,\" she declared. She added that she still had a connection to Victor, though, and James wondered what would happen. Starr made it clear that Victor had risked his life for her, and she would always love him. \"My father is my father,\" Starr added. She was happy that it hadn't been Todd who had done the unforgivable things that Victor had done.\n\n\nJames hoped that Todd wouldn't harm him, especially because James believed that Victor had finally been more accepting. James was worried about Todd's reaction to Starr's boyfriend. Starr thanked James for being patient with Hope, who had shown that she loved James. Todd would see that and have to agree, Starr rationalized. James informed her that he only cared about her opinion.\n\n\nAll of a sudden, James spotted the CD that Starr and Baz had been working on. He wanted to listen to it, but Starr explained that there was still work to do. She didn't want James to hear it. James assured her that she had nothing to lose, as he was her biggest fan.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody held Liam and told his son that he had to get the \"bad guy.\" Brody wondered if he could go through with ridding the world of Victor Lord, Jr. He needed a reason to do so. Brody knew that Vimal wouldn't reveal the truth about Liam's real father, and Brody could not allow Victor to ruin everything.\n\n\nBrody wondered if he could even take someone's life, though he had done so in war. He told himself that the circumstances were like a war. He heard the doorbell and was surprised to find Blair. She was distraught, and she quickly described how upset Todd had been that Victor had taken everything away. She'd tried to explain that none of it was Victor's fault, but Todd hadn't wanted to hear it.\n\n\nBlair felt that she'd made things worse after she'd argued with Todd and had dared him to take Dorian's gun. He hadn't taken the gun then, but after he'd left the house, the gun had been gone. She was worried about what Todd might do. Blair was certain that Todd hadn't been thinking straight\n\n\nBrody put his son to bed and promised to look for Todd. Blair was going to look for Victor so that she could warn him that someone was after him.\n\n\nJack rushed to Victor's side to warn him about the very real possibility that Todd was out to shoot Victor that night. Victor assured Jack that Todd would have killed him already when he'd had the chance at the newspaper. \"I kicked him out,\" Victor declared when Jack asked what had happened. Victor vowed to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court, because he would not allow Todd to steal everything that Victor had worked for.\n\n\nVictor also didn't believe that Todd would shoot him and risk the chance of going to jail. Todd had already been locked up for eight years, Victor explained, and had merely made an empty threat. Jack wasn't pacified though. \"Stuff happens,\" Jack proclaimed. He added that people ended up dead when they weren't supposed to.\n\n\nVictor realized that Jack was referring to Gigi, and he told his son that it had been an accident. Jack hadn't known about the carbon monoxide, and he'd had no control over what had happened. He thought that Jack should put it past him and look to the future. Gigi's death hadn't been Jack's fault. Jack wanted to tell his father about his new idea for the scholarship fund under Gigi's name. Victor looked it over and suggested that the name could really be Origami Cogs.\n\n\nJack was confused, and Victor explained that he'd learned that the corporate name had been an anagram for Gigi Morasco. Jack felt that his father didn't like the scholarship idea, but Victor urged him to pursue it. It might be like a peace offering, Victor thought. Victor also suggested that the war might be over, because Rex had seemed to be easing up. Jack believed the opposite might be true -- that it would never end.\n\n\nTomas found T\u00e9a at the Sun, and T\u00e9a revealed that Victor had gone to see his mother at the police station. Tomas was angry to hear that Irene was still controlling Victor, and he confessed that he had been looking for Victor to tell him to leave town and never return. T\u00e9a reminded her brother that he really had a problem with Todd, not Victor.\n\n\nTomas insisted that Victor was just as dangerous. T\u00e9a believed that the fault was with Irene, and Victor would be able to be his own person. Tomas thought that the years of programming that Victor had endured could not easily be deleted, and he'd run to Irene when she'd called him. T\u00e9a disagreed. She was sure that Victor had made a conscious choice to visit Irene, and he wasn't a robot. Victor hated Irene.\n\n\nTomas argued that Victor had been damaged, and he was desperate enough to do something dangerous. He didn't want T\u00e9a to be foolish. \"Don't push me,\" T\u00e9a growled. It was her life, and Tomas couldn't tell her what to do. Tomas had lied to her since he'd arrived in Llanview, she reminded him. Tomas insisted that he'd only wanted to protect his sister and his niece.\n\n\nTomas pointed out that Victor had lied after learning about his true identity. Victor had wanted to save what he'd believed to be his, and Victor was innocent compared to Tomas, T\u00e9a snapped. Victor had been scared. Tomas was afraid that T\u00e9a and Dani would be caught in the middle of two men who would be willing to do anything to save what they each thought they had a right to have.\n\n\nT\u00e9a understood that both Todd and Victor were volatile. She was hopeful that she would be able to calm them both down. She advised Tomas that he underestimated her influence on the men, and she suggested that he concentrate on Blair instead, especially since Todd was back in town. Tomas was certain that Blair was ready to move on, but T\u00e9a accused Tomas of deluding himself.\n\n\nT\u00e9a explained that she and Blair went way back, and she knew all about her on-and-off friend. Blair was not over Todd and never would be. Tomas disagreed. T\u00e9a announced that her truce with Blair was over, though Tomas thought that the women were still friends. T\u00e9a was tired of Blair telling her what to do, and friends didn't do that. Tomas was off to meet up with Baz. He told T\u00e9a he loved her and to be safe, though that wasn't possible until Victor was out of her life.\n\n\nBo and Nora sat in Bo's office at the police station. Bo informed Nora that he had visited Matthew, and there had been no change in their son's condition. Nora was depressed, and Bo did his best to cheer her up. He told her about other cases, similar to Matthew's, that had turned around. They couldn't give up.\n\n\nBo informed Nora of Gigi's exhumation, and how surprised Rex had been to see that Gigi's body had still been there. Rex had thought the casket would be empty. Bo didn't quite understand, but he thought that Rex had believed that he'd seen Gigi. Rex might have been having hallucinations, Bo suggested, but Bo almost believed Rex too.\n\n\nNora explained that when one wanted something to be true, one would believe something crazy. She admitted that she always bought Matthew's favorite milkshake whenever she went to visit him, in the event that he woke up and reached out for it. Also, she thought that she could hear Matthew's voice whenever she walked down the hallway to his room, and she always ended up running to the room. Bo confessed that he always seemed to hear Matthew laughing, and that was because Matthew lived inside of them.\n\n\nBo believed that Matthew would return to them. They had hope, but Rex didn't. Bo concluded that digging up Gigi's grave had backfired, especially because Shane had arrived to visit his mother's gravesite.\n\n\nNora picked up the stack of mail that she'd retrieved from home. She hadn't had the time to look through it, and she began to sort through it. She found a letter from Llanview University addressed to Matthew, and Bo opened the envelope. The letter stated that the school was hopeful that Matthew would apply, and Nora was sad.\n\n\nThose were the types of things that Matthew should be doing, Nora stated. She suggested that maybe they could have another child, and do those things for that child instead. Bo was aghast. \"Another child? Now?\" he asked. Nora laughed. She had been thinking of Destiny's and Matthew's child. Bo cited the fact that it depended on what Destiny wanted to do.\n\n\nNora pointed out that Destiny would be receiving the same letters as Matthew. Destiny should be out exploring life and not stuck at home with a baby, Nora proclaimed. \"We could share in the raising of Matthew's baby,\" she told Bo. \"Did you tell her that?\" Bo wondered.\n\n\nReluctantly, Nora admitted that she'd already discussed it, though she should have asked Bo first. Bo was concerned. He'd never had the opportunity to raise any of his sons from a young age. It was a big decision. He thought quickly. He thought it would be an honor to raise a child with the best mother in the world. Nora was ecstatic.\n\n\nBlair called out for Todd as she ran into Victor's house. Victor wondered why, and Blair replied that she thought Todd would be there. Jack spoke up and announced that he knew about the gun that Todd had taken. Blair urged Victor to get out of the house, and she wanted Jack to leave with her right away.\n\n\nVictor assumed that Blair wasn't worried about him, and she was only there to prevent Todd from going to death row. Blair thought that was ridiculous. Victor assured her that he wasn't a coward, and he'd survived the last time he'd been shot. Blair reminded him that John had been there to save him, and she wondered what would happen if no one were around the next time.\n\n\nVictor thought that Todd was big on threats, but wouldn't follow through. He also didn't think that Todd would want to be locked up after his eight years imprisonment. Blair dragged an unwilling Jack out of the house, and she advised Victor to call Shaun, because Victor needed a bodyguard. Victor agreed, if only to get Blair \"off my ass.\"\n\n\nBrody walked out of Llanfair and into the approaching storm. He readied his gun.\n\n\nVictor stood at the door, drink in hand, and looked out at the miserable weather.\n\n\nJames finally coerced Starr into allowing him to listen to the CD. Blair advised an argumentative Jack that he was better off not getting caught in any crossfire between Todd and Victor. She was sure that neither man would want to see Jack hurt.\n\n\nAs Starr sang what appeared to be a newer-sounding theme song for One Life to Live, Jack sat on the stairs and looked at his proposal for the scholarship. He went upstairs. Blair looked in on James and Starr. Shane sneaked downstairs and headed to the safe. Later, Rex did the same. T\u00e9a listened to Blair's urgent phone message.\n\n\nAs Victor placed a call to Shaun, he heard a noise. \"Hello?\" he called out. He resumed his phone call as someone walked into the room. \"Oh, my God, what the hell are you doing here?\" Victor asked. Someone shot Victor in the stomach, and he fell to the floor.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jack observes original Todd with a gun and warns both current Todd and his mom that original Todd is armed and dangerous and his father could get killed. We see Rex with a plan holding a gun. Brody also has a \"plan\" for victor Lord Jr. after Victor has threatened to expose Brody's secret that Liam is not his child. Bo has exhumed Gigi's grave for Rex and has told Nora that he understands Rex's need to never give up hope not unlike their hope for Matthew who is not dead and who could still get better although they always get their hopes up for nothing when they see that their son has made no changes. Nora is still determined to raise Destiny's and Matthew's baby although it does not seem anybody else is as \"enthused\" about the idea as she is. And at the end of the episode, we see Victor lying in the floor in a puddle of blood after somebody has shot him unseen and unknown.",
