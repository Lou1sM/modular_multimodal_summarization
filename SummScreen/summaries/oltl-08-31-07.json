John questions Natalie about how much she knows and where Blair is.  Natalie tells John that she has no knowledge of who the child is but she is sure Blair is giving Todd the information this very moment.

Marcie tells Blair how she has had a fear that Tommy would be taken from her and that she is unable to have children of her own.  Blair is uncomfortable when Marcie tells her that as long as she and Michael have Tommy, their family will be okay.  Todd returns and hands Marcie a copy of the new cover story.  Marcie is satisfied by the headline, \"Rouge Cop Railroads Woman of the Year.\"  Todd rudely asks her to leave and to take the baby with her.
