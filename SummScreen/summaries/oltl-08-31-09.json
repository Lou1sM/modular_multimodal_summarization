Fish revealed that his parents were eager to meet his girlfriend, so they had decided to drive from Des Moines to Llanview.  Fish had no idea what he was going to do when his parents arrived in a few days.  Cris and Layla urged Fish to be truthful with his parents.\n\n\nFish explained that he loved his parents, but they weren't tolerant of the homosexual lifestyle.  Fish's parents belonged to a church that supported an organization dedicated to helping gay people live a heterosexual lifestyle.  According to Fish, admitting their son was gay would be like his parents denying the existence of God.  Fish insisted that he had to hide his sexuality from his parents.\n\n\nWhile Fish went to take a shower, Cris and Layla went to the kitchen to cook.  Layla wondered if she had been too hard on Fish.  Cris reminded Layla that Fish had hurt her.  Layla admitted that she was angry and hurt, but she believed it was nothing compared to what Fish was going through.  Layla shifted the focus off of her by thanking Cris for being a good friend.  She hugged him and then promised that he would never have to deal with her boyfriend troubles again.  Layla had decided that she was through with men.\n\n\nAt Mayor Lowell's campaign headquarters, Dorian advised the mayor to keep a low profile about his stance on gay issues.  She suggested that the mayor focus on spearheading an anti-drug campaign.  Dorian thought it would be a great idea if the mayor's son became involved in the cause.  Neither Dorian nor the mayor realized that their every word was being monitored by Bo and Nora, thanks to the listening device that John had planted in the paperweight on the mayor's desk.\n\n\nAt the park, Sergei questioned Cole's reluctance sell drugs to Justin Lowell.  Cole realized that he could compromise his cover if he continued to refuse Justin's request, so Cole took Justin to a secluded area.  After Cole sold Justin some marijuana, they parted ways.  Sergei questioned Cole about his hesitation to sell the pot to Justin.  Cole admitted that he didn't like dealing to kids.\n\n\nThey were unaware that Todd had been lurking nearby.  Todd had taken a picture with his cell phone of the drug transaction between Justin and Cole.\n\n\nAfter Sergei and Cole parted ways, Cole called John.  Cole was upset because he feared something terrible would happen to Justin as a result of the drugs that Cole had sold to him.  John assured Cole that the drug deal had been necessary in order to protect Cole's cover.  However, John did promise to try to keep Justin from using the drugs.\n\n\nStarr approached Cole as he ended his call with John.  Cole was uncomfortable talking to Starr, but she insisted that it wouldn't raise suspicion, since they shared a daughter.  Cole argued that it was too dangerous to risk being seen together.  Starr refused to walk away while Cole was upset.  Eventually, Starr persuaded Cole to reveal that he'd been forced to sell drugs to Justin.\n\n\nWhen John tracked down Justin, the drugs were in plain view.  John promptly arrested Justin and then took him to the police station.  Bo and Nora were surprised that John had handcuffed the teenager.  John explained that Justin had made several attempts to escape.  Nora was reluctant to charge Justin because of his age, but John insisted that it was necessary.  John hoped that Mayor Lowell would be distracted by his son's troubles enough to drop his guard.\n\n\nJustin called his father, asking for help.  A short time later, Dorian and the mayor arrived at the police station.  The mayor was furious when Nora informed him that Justin had been arrested for drug possession.  Dorian accused Nora and Bo of trying to discredit the mayor.  Nora ignored Dorian's comments; instead she advised the mayor that she would release Justin if the mayor paid a fine and Justin agreed to enter a drug counseling program.\n\n\nMayor Lowell accused John of planting the drugs on Justin.  The mayor denied that his son used drugs, but no one appeared to believe him.  Nora repeated her offer, while Justin pleaded with his father to help him.  The mayor snapped \"shut up\" at his son and then demanded that Justin be released from police custody.\n\n\nJohn called Cole to let him know that he had found Justin.  John assured Cole that things would be over soon.\n\n\nLater, in Bo's office, Nora worried that they had been too hard on Justin.  Bo reminded Nora that Justin had been one of the kids who had bullied Matthew on the night that Matthew had been paralyzed.  Moments later, they heard the mayor, Justin, and Dorian return to the campaign headquarters.\n\n\nDorian advised the mayor to be truthful with his constituents.  She was confident that it would be the most effective way to prevent the scandal from ruining the mayor's re-election campaign.  They mayor agreed to Dorian's suggestion and then asked to have a moment alone with his son.  After everyone cleared out, the mayor backhanded his son.\n\n\nJustin began crying as he cradled his injured head.  The mayor didn't show any remorse for hurting his son.  He berated Justin and then demanded to know if his son had bought the drugs.  Justin told the truth and revealed that Cole had sold the marijuana to him.  The mayor handed his son some money, instructed him to get something to eat, and then ordered him to return afterwards because they had more to discuss.\n\n\nAfter Justin left, the mayor called Sergei.  The mayor was livid; he told Sergei that Cole had sold drugs to his son.  The mayor insisted that it could not happen again or heads would roll.  In Bo's office, John, Bo, and Nora looked at each other with concern when they heard the mayor's ominous threat.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Blair listened to Ross's side of his conversation with T\u00e9a.  Ross was curious how T\u00e9a managed to attract so many enemies wherever she went.  T\u00e9a ignored the question; she demanded that Ross sign the divorce papers.  Ross wanted to know why T\u00e9a was so eager for a divorce.  T\u00e9a claimed that she was moving on and then confessed that Todd had proposed marriage to her.\n\n\nWhen Ross refused to comply with her demands, T\u00e9a threatened to send a bounty hunter after him.  Todd entered the room moments later.  T\u00e9a phrased her words carefully, so that Todd would assume that she was on the phone with a client.  In Tahiti, Ross hadn't been intimidated by T\u00e9a's threat.  He dared her to send anyone, including Todd, after him and then chuckled because he knew T\u00e9a would never risk Todd crossing paths with Ross.\n\n\nAfter Ross disconnected the call, T\u00e9a scolded Todd for not respecting her privacy.  She resented his interruption while she was working.  Todd dismissed the call, pointing out that it couldn't have been important if she had been willing to hang up on the person.   Luckily for T\u00e9a, Todd wasn't interested in whom she had been speaking to.  He had other things on his mind.\n\n\nTodd held up his phone to show T\u00e9a the picture that he had taken of Cole.  He asked her what she thought of it.  T\u00e9a agreed that it looked like a drug buy; she advised him to tell Marty that her son was using again.  Todd clarified that Cole hadn't purchased the drugs, he had sold them.  T\u00e9a was surprised that Todd had only snapped the picture.  She confessed that she would have expected him to have had a more violent reaction to the situation.  Todd admitted that there might be more to the picture than met the eye.  He was also reluctant to alienate Starr.\n\n\nT\u00e9a suggested that Todd talk to Starr about the incident.  Todd didn't want to rock the boat, but he promised that he would consider T\u00e9a's advice.  He then switched gears to discuss the wedding proposal.  T\u00e9a was uncomfortable with the topic, but Todd pushed for an answer.  He promised that T\u00e9a had nothing to fear in regards to Blair; he insisted that he would never sleep with Blair again.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wanted another day to think about the proposal.  Todd admitted that her reluctance to agree to marry him might be a sign.  T\u00e9a was surprised; she asked if Todd was withdrawing his proposal.  Todd made it clear that he wanted to marry T\u00e9a, but he didn't want her to feel as if she had been forced into the marriage.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Ross revealed that Todd had asked T\u00e9a to marry him.  Blair was stunned.  She hadn't realized that things had moved quite so rapidly between Todd and T\u00e9a.  Ross suggested that T\u00e9a wouldn't be involved with Todd if there were any chance that Todd and Blair would reconcile.  However, Ross intended to remain married to T\u00e9a until T\u00e9a gave him what he wanted.\n\n\nBlair wondered what it was that Ross wanted from T\u00e9a, but Ross kept the information to himself.  He would only say that T\u00e9a alone could provide him with what he wanted.  Blair urged Ross to give T\u00e9a the divorce.  Ross was surprised by Blair's suggestion.  He was curious why he should give up his one bargaining chip.  Blair was secretive about her plans, but she promised that she knew what she was doing.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was surprised when Ross called her back to announce that he would sign the divorce papers and then have Elijah drop them off to T\u00e9a.  According to Ross, he realized that T\u00e9a would never cave in.  When T\u00e9a disconnected the call she told Todd to buy her the \"damn\" ring, so that she could accept his proposal.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Blair was delighted that Ross had decided to go along with her plans.  She hoped that T\u00e9a was busy planning her wedding to Todd.\n\n\n",
