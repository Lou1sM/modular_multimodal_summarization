    "soap_central": "\n\nJames and Ford walked into the steam room after a heavy workout at the gym. Ford wanted to bond with his brother, and he wanted them to be too tired to think about Starr and Langston. James was in a lot of pain, but he thought he already had enough to worry about without the girls clouding his mind. He revealed that he wouldn't go out with Langston again if it hurt Ford too much.\n\n\nFord claimed not to care. \"Who am I kidding?\" Ford asked his brother. He still regretted leaving James behind at home when he was young, but James swore he was okay with it. He thought the brothers were on track to being friends, and that nothing would break them apart. Just then, Nate walked into the room. In an awkward moment, Nate advised the pair that he hadn't realized they were there. He offered to leave, but James wanted him to stay. He wanted to get to know Nate. Ford darted evil looks in James's direction, but James insisted that anything that had happened was not Nate's fault.\n\n\nNate knew why Ford didn't like him. Nate confronted his brother  and said Ford thought that their mother had chosen Nate over Ford. \"She did,\" Ford responded. James pointed out that it wasn't Nate's fault because he hadn't even been born. Ford noted that Nate had still been the reason their mother had left. James reminded Ford that their father had been involved and had kicked their mother out of the house. They argued over the past, and Nate was upset too. He told them that his mother wasn't a bad person, and things had been difficult for them also.\n\n\nFord and James were entitled to their opinions, but they were brothers, Nate added. He had been lonely, and it was a huge thing for him to find out that he had siblings. He wanted a chance, and James was willing to be friends. Nate held out his hand to Ford, but Ford refused to shake it. He claimed that his hand was sweaty. Nate had to leave, and James suggested they hang out together another time. Nate agreed, and after he left, James called Ford a jerk.\n\n\n\"Would it have killed you to shake our brother's hand?\" James asked his brother. Ford meekly stated that his hand was sweaty, but James was annoyed. He supposed it was, considering they were in a steam room, he growled. Ford had to leave to go to the university freshman orientation, and he suggested that James go with him to sign up for classes. Scornfully, James mentioned the fact that he hadn't graduated, and he couldn't afford it anyway. Ford knew that James only needed to take the test for his GED, and since Ford had been appointed a full professor, he had a discount. Ford thought that he might be able to pull some strings and get James a \"full ride.\"\n\n\nStarr and Langston found themselves at the Llanview University freshman orientation. They discussed David because they felt bad they had left Dorian at home alone. Langston didn't believe that David had left Dorian, and she thought there was more to the story. She didn't think that David would actually desert Dorian since he loved her so much. She thought that either David had been blackmailed like the first time he'd left Dorian, or someone had interceded because they didn't want Dorian to marry David. Both of them had enemies. Starr could only laugh.\n\n\nLangston was glad she and Starr were friends again, because she hated when they argued. She confessed that she wouldn't see James again if it upset Starr so much. As the girls walked around and picked up flyers, Starr admitted that she had been slightly jealous. Langston thought that was funny and compared it to the Pope being slightly Catholic. Starr explained that she had gotten close to James while they were on the run, and when Cole wasn't in the picture. She and Cole were together, and they were back on track, Starr concluded. She was only interested in Cole.\n\n\nThe girls retrieved their class schedules, and Starr was thrilled to see that she had been admitted into the entomology class. She recalled her obsession with snakes as a youngster. Langston talked about a writing class that she hoped to take, especially since the class description portrayed her so accurately.\n\n\nClint found Matthew at the country club and suggested they talk about Matthew's future. It was a fact that Asa wanted Matthew to run Buchanan Enterprises someday, Clint told his nephew. Matthew hadn't thought his grandfather was serious, but Clint assured him that Matthew was the only Buchanan with the \"stones\" to do the job, other than Clint. Matthew thought that David was a possibility, but Clint guffawed, though he admitted that he knew how Matthew felt about David. He pointed out that Matthew had the \"killer instinct.\"\n\n\nIt was the Buchanan family trait, Clint pronounced. He hated David because David had sent away the woman he loved, and he intended to pay David back some day, Clint declared. He didn't do it previously because he hadn't wanted to ruin Bo and Nora's wedding. He knew that Matthew was familiar with paybacks after what he had done to Nate.\n\n\nMatthew pretended to be innocent, but Clint called him on it. He knew all about what Matthew had done after Nate found the money. Matthew was worried that Clint would tell Bo, but Clint promised that he wouldn't expose Matthew. He thought that Nate deserved whatever Matthew had given him.\n\n\nClint enlightened Matthew that Bo didn't have the \"killer instinct,\" and they saw things differently. Bo and he both believed in justice, Clint explained, but Bo had faith in the system while Clint wanted \"an eye for an eye.\" He thought Matthew was just like him and would go far in the family business if he made the right choices. Matthew could start his training right away, and it was possible he would be the next company CEO.\n\n\nClint wanted Matthew to start working part-time and learn the company from the bottom up. He suggested that Matthew work after school and some weekends. His first lesson would be to make sure no woman ever hurt Matthew again. Matthew hesitated, believing that his parents wouldn't allow it.\n\n\nAt the police station, John informed Bo that Eli had been taken into custody in Tahiti. He confirmed that both Kelly and Rex had been in his office at the time of the news, so they were aware of it. Bo assumed that Kelly was relieved, and John agreed, but he wasn't too sure that Blair was safe. No one had been able to talk to Blair on the phone after Eli was captured, and John had received a runaround from the cops. He wished that Eli were imprisoned in Llanview.\n\n\nJohn confided that he would like to fly to Tahiti to get Eli, even if it were not practical. Bo knew that Eli had been \"jerking\" them around, and he was tired of it. \"You go get the bastard,\" Bo advised John. Bo would start the extradition proceedings, and he wanted John to leave for the airport immediately.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Blair confronted Eli and asked if it were true that he had killed two previous wives. She wondered if he planned on killing her next. \"You think you've got it all figured out, don't you, Blair?\" he asked. He professed that her accusations hurt him, and he blamed it on Kelly's crazy ideas. He thought that Blair knew him better than that, he declared. He couldn't believe that she trusted Kelly more than him, and he didn't understand why John had it in for him as well.\n\n\nBlair suggested that perhaps it was because Eli killed rich women for their money. Eli's face darkened, but he controlled his thoughts. He indicated that maybe it was because he represented Hannah, and because both John and Kelly were obsessed with him when they had no evidence. Blair advised him there was enough evidence for a warrant. She wanted to know why he had insisted on eloping. She wondered if he had been on the run from the cops.\n\n\nEli maintained that the only reason for the trip to Tahiti was his desire to marry Blair. Llanview had turned into a circus with Dorian's wedding. Blair stressed that Craig Pattison's mug shot looked like Eli, even though Eli insisted he didn't have a mug shot. Blair agreed that he didn't have one because he had tossed it out, and Kelly had retrieved the shredded photo after she broke into Eli's room. The photo had been reconstructed, Blair yelled.\n\n\nEli was unable to hide his alarm as Blair continued with the story of Craig, who turned into Bennett, who was then Eli. She wondered who else he had killed besides his two wives, Melinda, Rodney, and the clerk in Boston. \"You got me. I confess,\" Eli uttered. Blair was shocked and asked what Eli wanted to confess to. He wanted to talk, and he felt she deserved the truth.\n\n\nHe had been lying to her for a very long time about everything, Eli confessed. It wasn't him the cops had been searching for. It was Ross. He was the one with the multiple identities, and he was the one who had committed all of the murders. Eli had found out after he learned that Ross was still alive, Eli continued. Blair wondered why Eli had covered for his brother, and Eli admitted he had been wrong to do so. He didn't want to lose his brother after he'd found him again, Eli confessed. He wanted to get his brother help. Blair was angry and wanted to know why Eli had put her in the middle of danger when his brother was so unstable.\n\n\nEli was certain that Ross would never hurt Blair, especially since he still carried a torch for her. Blair mentioned previous encounters with Ross, but Eli insisted his brother had regretted his past actions. Eli's plan was to fly to Tahiti to warn Ross, and he had Blair with him so as not to raise any suspicions with the police. He also wanted a perfect wedding, and Blair couldn't deny that it had been anything less than perfect. She agreed, but thought of herself as a \"smokescreen\" for Eli. He insisted he loved her, but it had been important for him to help Ross. She of all people knew what it was like to protect people she loved, he added.\n\n\nAt the hospice in St. Kitts, Shaun demanded that Greg tell him what was going on. Greg insisted there was nothing, and Shaun knew everything there was to know. Shaun was not convinced. Greg challenged his brother and asked Shaun what he thought Greg was hiding. Shaun just thought it was curious that Greg did his best to keep Dani and Todd away from T\u00e9a. Greg contended he was only following T\u00e9a's wishes.\n\n\nShaun felt he knew T\u00e9a quite well, and he wondered if she had changed her mind about seeing her family. Greg maintained that T\u00e9a was headstrong and stubborn, and she'd never changed her mind. T\u00e9a had not been alone, though, because he had been with her at the end. Shaun asked why it was Greg who had been with her.\n\n\nGreg stated that he was her doctor, and he had been abiding by her wishes. Shaun knew that his brother had made his patient comfortable, but Dani had not been able to say goodbye, and he still suspected that Greg wasn't hiding anything. Greg wished he had been able to do more for Dani.\n\n\nInside T\u00e9a's room, a distraught Dani cried that she hadn't been able to say goodbye to her mother. She had wanted to see her one last time. Todd did his best to console his daughter. He told her that he wanted to see T\u00e9a again and would have given anything to have one more day with her. He thought it best if they moved on with their lives and went home. Dani wondered about T\u00e9a's belongings, and Todd agreed they could pack them and take them along. He showed her the photo of him and Dani, while Dani picked up a blouse and sniffed it. She could still smell her mother, she told Todd.\n\n\nThey packed T\u00e9a's things, and Greg and Shaun returned to the room. Shaun advised Todd he'd escort them back to Llanview. Greg planned on staying in St. Kitts to wait for T\u00e9a's remains. He apologized for not doing enough for them. Shaun darted a dirty look at Greg, who didn't see him.\n\n\nAfter John left Bo's office, Nate arrived looking for his mother. Bo told him that Inez had gone out for a while, but he invited Nate in. Bo asked how the teen was doing, and Nate mentioned wryly that he had two new brothers, but only one of them hated his guts. Bo noted that Nate's mom had been in a \"real tough spot.\" Nate thanked Bo for giving his mother the job. Just then, Matthew walked in. He asked \"what the hell\" Nate was doing there.\n\n\nNate explained he had been searching for his mother, and a sarcastic Matthew asked what she had been busted for. Bo interceded and told Matthew that Inez was his new assistant. Matthew was shocked and inquired how his dad could do such a thing after what Nate had done to Matthew.\n\n\nNate left Bo's office, and Matthew gave Bo grief for hiring Inez. Nate had stolen his girlfriend, Matthew snapped. Bo told his son that the hiring had nothing to do with Matthew. He protested that Dani wasn't only his girlfriend, but she was there for him during his surgery, and when he took his first steps. He blamed Nate for that, and he demanded that Bo fire Inez. Bo refused, and he cited the fact that everyone had the right to work. Matthew retorted that Bo shouldn't have a problem then, if Matthew were to work with Clint.\n\n\nJohn left a phone message for Natalie, and explained that he had to go out of town on police business. He missed her, he said.\n\n\nLangston was ecstatic when she learned she had been assigned to the writing class she wanted, and she tried to convince Starr to take the class with her. Starr explained that she planned on going into pre-med, but Langston was sure the class would fill one of Starr's liberal arts requirements. Starr finally gave in, and the girls went to the table so that Starr could sign up. She wondered who would be teaching the course, \"Imitation of Life-Shaping Reality into a Narrative Fiction.\" \"I am,\" said a voice behind them. It was Ford, with James in tow.\n\n\nEli begged Blair to understand. Ross was the person the cops were after. As he walked towards her, Blair backed up and grabbed the gun laying on the table. \"You believe me, don't you?\" Eli inquired. Blair pointed the gun at Eli. \"Not for one damn second,\" she replied.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Robert takes James to the gym and the steam room showing him how he relieves stress and gets over personal problems. Right then, they run into Nate. Robert makes it clear that he could cares less about him or his mom and does not see them as family. But James wants to make peace with them and tells Robert he was out of line for how he treated their little brother. Meanwhile, Clint goes to find Matthew and offers him a job opportunity at B.E. He explains to his nephew that he knows that he might have the \"killer instinct\" that someone needs in order to some day be the C.E.O. He tells him he knows that Matthew got a bounty hunter to go after Nate Salinger and almost got him killed when Nate took his girlfriend. They agree that Bo is not power hungry nor suited for business the way Clint is. Clint wants to get Matthew trained starting now so that he can one day run the company. Matthew notices his father being friendly to Nate and finds out that Bo hired Nate's mom. He is angry and tells him that if Nate's mom has the right to work for Bo, then he has the right to work with Uncle Clint at B.E. In Tahiti, Blair confronts Eli who tells her that he has been covering for his criminal brother, Ross, but she does not trust him any more than she trusts Ross. Bo and John are ready to go after Eli and have him locked up. Starr and Langston are starting freshman classes at L.U. Langston is ready to take a writing class that she's very excited about. Unknown to them, Robert is ready to continue teaching, wants to become a full professor, and is going to pull strings to get James enrolled in school.
