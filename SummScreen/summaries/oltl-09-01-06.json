Dorian refused, saying that they have to stick to the original plan, so that they don't endanger Adriana.\n\n\nAdriana fought with Bruce, telling him that he will never get the money, because for Dorian, money and reputation come before her family. She offered to hand over her entire inheritance to Bruce if he lets her go.\n\n\nEvangeline told Todd to pay her only what he owes her and not the \"bonus\" he wanted to add. He changed it, and then she ripped up the check because she owes him a lot. The friends talked about Blair. Evangeline assumed they are back together now that Blair admitted that she had been playing Spencer. Todd insisted that Blair is, and always will be, a lying slut. He's such an adoring husband, isn't he? He said he's not willing to wait for her to stop, \"doing her sex thing.\" Evangeline pointed out that Blair has always been like this and he still fell in love with her. Todd said that Blair is too much for him to deal with now. Evangeline was sympathetic and they toasted with beer.\n\n\nBlair meanwhile was at the jail with Spencer, who begged her to tell him that they are okay. Spencer maintained that he is innocent, but Blair told him that she has seen evidence. Then she told him that she's responsible for him being in jail. Spencer thought that the McBains had poisoned her mind against him, but she explained that she had collected the evidence against him. She told him that she only loves Todd and no one else. Then she explained that he doesn't love her, that he had fallen in love with an image, not the real her. She also said she and Todd recently made love. Blair tossed his ring on the floor and walked away as Spencer yelled for her to come back. He reached through the bars to retrieve the ring, flashed back to moments with Blair and vowed to himself that she'd be back after Todd hurts her again.\n\n\nBlair went to see Todd, when the elevator doors opened, she caught him in an embrace with Evangeline.\n\n\nNash came to the Lord manse with Bree. The entire family was unhappy to see him, but Nash wanted to be there for Tess. Viki urged him to make peace with losing Tess. Jessica stepped forward and told him she wanted him to stay, much to antonio's dismay. Jess said that she will always love Tess for fighting her battles for her, but that she now has to let Tess go. Nash took off to put Bree to bed before coming back in. Natalie came in to support her sister, then Jess told Antonio that she was ready. Under hypnosis, Jessica was taken back to the bar that Niki had taken her to. She remembered going with Norman to his house and playing with his stuffed animals. In her hypnotic state, Jessica picked up her younger self, and tried to take her away, but Viki's voice broke through and asked Jessie to stay in the state she was in, even though Jess was terrified since Norman was coming back. Jessica steeled herself to stay along with her 5-year old self. Norman came in then, and told Jessica that they were, \"Going to make a movie.\" Everyone looked distressed by Jessica's mental journey. The hypnotist took Jessica to her second visit where Tess first appeared She winked at Nash and implied that she wasn't going away. When the hypnotist finished up and asked who was present, Jessica (or was it Tess?) stared back at him.\n\n\n",

Spencer feels like she has thrown everything away. In spite of it all, he still loves her and is in love with her. He can even do the only thing that Todd can't do for her. He forgives her for all this. She knows that this night she will be sleeping well, as she will be as far from his engagement ring as she can get. She fishes it out of her cleavage and drops it on the floor. He calls out for her loudly as she walks off. Todd walks Evangeline to the elevator and they hug goodbye.
