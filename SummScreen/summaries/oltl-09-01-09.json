    "soap_central": "\nThe Big Kahuna\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Matthew greeted Destiny in the foyer.  Destiny explained she'd had to walk from the bus stop because Greg hadn't picked her up.  Matthew was surprised Destiny was standing by his side throughout his lawsuit, but Destiny gushed that she'd always make time for him.  Embarrassed, she awkwardly backtracked from her adoration.  Matthew told her he just wanted the case over and his family back to normal.  The doorbell rang, and Destiny answered it to find Shaun, who was equally surprised to see her.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Rachel prepared for her court date, while David nagged her about signing a release for his reality show.  Rachel refused to be a part of the spectacle, even as David gushed about the supposed fireworks between her and Greg.  As he replayed the video of Rachel and Greg's \"dance match,\" Greg arrived.  Rachel launched into another attack on Greg for taking Matthew's side in the lawsuit, and was outraged to learn Greg had already signed a consent form for his likeness to appear on David's show.  Greg told Rachel he had nothing to be ashamed of, making light of it by claiming that she did, since he'd \"whupped her ass\" in their video game duel.  \n\n\n\n \nRachel and Greg bickered about their gaming skills, as David refereed.  Greg admitted Rachel had some natural dancing ability.  \"Baby's got back,\" David agreed, raising his hand for a high-five. \"Up top, right?\"  \"Shut up, David!\" Rachel snapped.\n\n\nAs the good-natured argument over the game continued, Shaun entered, staring at the videotape of Greg and Rachel falling over one another.  Shaun asked the trio to explain the tape.  Greg and Rachel insisted their game had only been harmless fun, ignoring David's attempts to film the sibling rivalry.  Flustered, Greg hurried out to prepare for his day in court, followed by David.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Greg exchanged words with Destiny and Matthew about the lawsuit.  His curiosity piqued, David listened in.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, May or Lowell and Justin prepared for the boy's arraignment on drug charges, while John met with Nora at the opposing counsel table.  Nora was confused as to why Lowell hadn't taken the police department's simple plea bargain agreement for a first offender.  John assured her he was still several steps ahead of Lowell.\n\n\nAcross the aisle, Dorian rushed in, anxious to spin the public relations catastrophe for her candidate.  She told Lowell that they'd sell Justin's run-in with the law to the voters as \"normal parental challenges.\"  Justin suggested giving up Cole's name to the police in order to make the charges go away, but Lowell said no.  He wanted to wait to use Cole against John.  As the arraignment began, the judge asked Justin for his plea.  Lowell stood up and began to grandstand, declaring that his son was not guilty.  As he pontificated, he told the gallery that his son had been set up by John McBain.\n\n\nAfter the court adjourned, Lowell ordered Justin to wait in the corridor.  Dorian asked him why he'd openly attacked John yet again, but Lowell was insistent that McBain had framed Justin.  Dorian found his claims hard to believe.\n\n\nAcross the aisle, Nora and John put their heads together.  Nora wondered if the mayor knew Cole was undercover, and John said he had to make sure Lowell didn't, then made a quick exit.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Cafe, Starr and Hope shared breakfast with Marty.  Marty asked how parenthood was treating her, and Starr admitted that she was missing Blair and Cole.  She was pleased that John had told her Cole's work would soon be done.  Cole arrived, eager to reunite with his loved ones.  After some face time, Starr and Hope said goodbye, leaving Marty to talk to her son.  Cole told Marty that he worried about his family's safety during his undercover work, but Marty promised him they were well cared for.  Cole congratulated Marty on getting her job back, and Marty explained she'd already been faced with new challenges.\n\n\nAt Todd's, T\u00e9a awoke to find Todd greeting her with breakfast in bed, complete with a beautiful engagement ring hidden in her grapefruit.  \"Way to change my mind about grapefruit!\" she exclaimed, overjoyed.  As Todd slipped the ring onto her finger, he told her it was official, they were engaged.  Todd wanted to marry that day, but T\u00e9a refused, saying they could afford to wait and have a big wedding.  She reminded him that he hadn't even told his kids.  \n\n\nTodd was surprised T\u00e9a wanted pomp and circumstance since he was \"the only husband you've ever had.\"  He asked if she was purposely stalling, then apologized for becoming suspicious and paranoid.  T\u00e9a was touched by Todd's newfound patience.  He assured her that nothing could stop their marriage, not even Blair.  Kissing her goodbye, Todd left to go tell his family the good news.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Blair continued to rant and rave to Ross Rayburn about Todd proposing to T\u00e9a.  Ross told Blair that he'd overnight-mailed the fake divorce papers to T\u00e9a, and assured her that T\u00e9a would think she was free and clear to marry Todd.  Blair delighted in the thought of T\u00e9a's new life blowing up in her face.  Ross was surprised by Blair's level of  vengeance, and suggested she relax in their tropical settings.  He accused her of targeting T\u00e9a in order to get Todd back, but Blair continued to deny it, lamely insisting that it was T\u00e9a's lies that made her a danger not only to Todd but to Blair's children.  Blair wanted Ross to return to Llanview with her under an assumed name, and promised him she'd drop the charges against him once they arrived.  Ross agreed, and said he couldn't wait to see T\u00e9a's face when she was reunited with her not-quite-ex-husband.\n\n\nAs the duo packed to leave Tahiti, Blair wanted to strategize, but Ross had a better idea, tossing Blair a swimsuit and shedding his shirt.  Blair thought Ross had designs on her, but Ross explained that he wanted to teach her how to surf before they left their island hideaway.  Blair reluctantly donned the bikini as Ross gawked at her figure.  He explained that she looked even better in the bikini than T\u00e9a had, which grossed Blair out.  \n\n\nBefore they could head for the beach, however, a rainstorm descended on the island.  Ross wanted to hit the waves anyway, urging Blair to live a little.  \"I wanna live a lot!\" Blair retorted.  Ross suggested that he could teach her to surf from the comfort of his living room, and laid out his surfboards on the carpet, taking Blair through a series of balancing exercises.  Ross held Blair close, helping her keep balance before she fell into his arms.  After a tense moment, Blair suggested they get back to business.\n\n\nBack at the courthouse, Dorian said goodbye to Mayor Lowell and Justin in the corridor, just as Matthew, Destiny, Greg, and David exited the elevator.  Matthew and Justin locked eyes as the boy wheeled himself towards the courtroom.  David followed the action with his camera, continuing to badger Greg about the tension between himself, his brother, and Rachel.  T\u00e9a ushered Matthew and the Evanses into the courtroom, but shut the doors in David's face, ordering him to keep out.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Rachel laughed to Shaun about her video game tournament with Greg, and David's annoying presence.  She continued to insist there was nothing between her and Greg, but Shaun disagreed, and suggested the only reason she hadn't explored anything with his brother was because of loyalty to him.  Rachel admitted that Greg pushed her buttons and made her crazy.  \"And I don't,\" Shaun replied.  Softening his tone, he said he knew they weren't moving forward, and asked Rachel to be straight with him if she didn't want to.  \n\n\nShaun said he knew Greg was making a move on her, even if he didn't realize it himself or mean any harm.  He said that women, games, and medical school were all the same thing to Greg, something he had to win at all costs.  Shaun said he wasn't like his brother, that he was all heart, not looks.  He said he was \"straight up,\" not a player, and that for him, Rachel was the only woman in the room at any given moment.  He asked Rachel to give him time to prove that he was the right Evans man for her.  Touched, Rachel agreed.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, John arrived to meet Marty and Cole.  Marty asked John if the drug case was close to being solved, and if he knew who was behind it.  Suddenly, the Lowells entered.  Sending Justin to the counter, May or Lowell made a beeline for John and the Thornharts, dropping veiled comments about the three of them.  Marty and Lowell traded barbs about her medical license, while Lowell needled Cole about his \"community service,\" and began to talk about the scourge of drug dealing in Llanview.  After he left, John assured Marty and Cole that Lowell was only toying with them.  Marty kissed John and Cole goodbye, asking them to be safe.\n\n\nAlone, John and Cole retreated to the men's room to talk in private.  Cole asked if Lowell was on to them, and said he was scared for Starr and Hope after Serg i's comments about them.  John said Lowell didn't know the truth, and decided to speed things up by publicly \"arresting\" Cole, dragging him out of the restaurant.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr returned home with Hope to find Todd waiting for her.  Todd said he had good news and bad news, and opened with the bad as he revealed that Cole was a \"drug dealer.\"  Starr took Todd's news in stride, and diplomatically explained that he hadn't seen what he thought he'd saw.  Todd was amazed that Starr wasn't shocked or upset.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Dorian arrived, yelling into her phone as she ordered Blair to return home immediately.  Overhearing voices in the drawing room, she listened in just in time to hear Starr tell Todd that Cole was not a drug dealer, but an undercover agent working for John.\n\n\nIn the courtroom for Matthew's civil case, David crept in, continuing to nag Greg about Rachel.  Infuriated, Greg told David to leave him alone, and stormed off.  David turned his lens onto Destiny and Matthew, asking why she hated his father.  Destiny said she didn't hate anyone, but supported Matthew's choice.  As David grew giddy at the possibility of a filmed courtroom drama, Nora stalked over and ordered him to get out.  As David slithered  away, Nora told Matthew she'd love him no matter what the verdict in their case.  Matthew agreed.\n\n\nAt the plaintiff's table, T\u00e9a was preparing Matthew's case as Elijah walked up, handing her an envelope.  T\u00e9a was thrilled to realize her \"divorce papers\" had arrived.  Elijah and T\u00e9a were both surprised Ross had finally given in to her demands, but T\u00e9a said she knew Ross would do anything for the right amount of cash.  Blissfully happy, T\u00e9a slipped her engagement ring off her finger and onto her necklace.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, Blair and Ross prepared to leave for Llanview.  Ross wanted to stay awhile and catch more waves, but Blair refused.  \"I'm through hanging ten,\" she said. \"Now it's time to hang T\u00e9a.\" \n\n\n",
