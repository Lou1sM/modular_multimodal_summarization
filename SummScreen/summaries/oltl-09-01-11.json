    "soap_central": "\n\nBlair, Starr, and Jack couldn't believe that Victor was dead. John apologized that they had to hear the news from him, and expressed his sympathy for their loss. Jack screamed that John was lying, as Blair and Starr sobbed in disbelief. Blair wondered what had happened, and John admitted that Victor had been shot at home.\n\n\nJack wondered why Starr was upset, because she had turned against Victor as soon as Todd had shown up. Starr tried to defend herself, and said that Victor had been her father for eight years. She'd loved him. Jack replied that only he and Dani had believed in Victor, so Dani was the only sister he had. Blair scolded Jack for talking to Starr like that, but he continued that Todd had killed Victor. Jack said that Starr was probably happy that Victor was dead. She began to sob, and ran out of the room.\n\n\nJohn suggested that Jack \"stop acting like a jerk at a time like this.\" John said that he'd put an APB out on Todd, but it was too early in the investigation to focus on one person. He continued that the only evidence they had was Jack's keys. John thought Blair should check on Starr, but Blair was afraid to leave Jack alone. John thought that Jack would be more apt to talk if it was just John and Jack. Blair asked John to go easy on Jack, and left the room. John closed the door behind her.\n\n\nJohn asked Jack about what had happened to him that night. Jack explained that Blair had taken him home from Victor's because she'd found out that Todd had a gun. He'd gone to bed, but had sneaked out of the house, and back to Victor's. When he'd gotten to the house, he'd pulled out his keys. That had been when he'd been hit, but he hadn't seen who had hit him. Despite that fact, he knew that Todd had killed Victor.\n\n\nJack realized that it had felt like a gun that had hit him on the head. He reminded John that it wouldn't have been the first time Todd had knocked Jack out. However, Jack didn't think that John cared about Jack or Victor, because of \"what you think we did\" -- Jack and Victor's involvement with Gigi's death. John confirmed that he believed that Jack had something to do with Gigi's death, and that Victor had helped get Jack out of it. However, John vowed to do his job and find the killer. He left the room.\n\n\nBlair found Starr sitting outside Jack's room. Starr was happy that Todd was back, but she was nowhere near happy that Victor had died. Blair told Starr not to listen to Jack, because he'd only been taking out his anger on her. Blair couldn't believe that Victor was gone, because they'd all loved him. Starr revealed that she'd told Victor that she still loved him, and Blair was glad that Starr had gotten the opportunity. Starr regretted that she'd \"ratted him out,\" and was unsure that he'd forgiven her for it.\n\n\nStarr wondered if Blair thought that Todd had killed Victor. John entered, and Blair asked if Jack had been any help. John revealed that Jack hadn't seen who had hit him, but the person had thought enough to take Jack to the hospital. Blair thought it sounded like someone who cared about Jack, and believed that it could have been Todd. John still had to look at the evidence, so he didn't know. John told the women to let him do his job, and to focus on dealing with their loss. He again expressed his sympathy, and left.\n\n\nBlair knew that John was right, and hugged Starr. She wanted to see Jack, but didn't want to leave Starr alone. Starr urged Blair to go, so Blair entered Jack's room. Starr looked at a picture on her phone of her, Hope, and Victor.\n\n\nJack demanded that Blair leave his room, because he blamed her for Victor's death. He cried that he should have been there, because he could have helped. \"After all he did for me, I wasn't there!\" he wailed.\n\n\nDani entered the house, and saw the body bag. She demanded to know who had died. In tears, T\u00e9a told her daughter to go upstairs, but Dani didn't want to. After much pleading, T\u00e9a finally told Dani that Victor had died. Dani defiantly refused to believe it. She ran toward the body bag and tried to open it, but Brody dragged her away. T\u00e9a finally told Dani what had happened to Victor, and Dani fell to the floor in Brody's arms. Practically hyperventilating, Dani wanted to know what had happened to Victor. T\u00e9a told her that he'd been shot and killed.\n\n\nOn the phone, Brody told someone that they were \"bringing the body out.\" Brody remembered telling Liam that Victor needed to be stopped. Dani wondered why someone would want to hurt Victor, which interrupted Brody's thoughts. She couldn't think of anyone who would want to hurt him. T\u00e9a thought about Blair's message about Todd taking the gun. T\u00e9a didn't know who would want to hurt Victor, but promised that the police would figure it out. \"How can my dad be dead?\" Dani wondered.\n\n\nRex entered his house, soaking wet, and was startled to find Shane. Shane wondered where his father had been. Rex replied that he'd been out, but Shane wondered what had been so important to go out into the storm for. When Rex wouldn't give Shane a straight answer, Shane asked again where Rex had been. Rex admitted that he'd gone to see Gigi's grave. \"You mean after you dug it up?\" Shane spat.\n\n\nRex apologized for having Gigi's grave dug up without telling Shane. He'd visited the grave to make sure that Gigi was peaceful. He'd also apologized to her for \"doing things that I shouldn't have done.\" Shane apologized for yelling at Rex about paying back Jack and Victor. Rex replied that he'd needed to hear it, and that Shane was perfect. Shane didn't think so, and said that he was tired.\n\n\nShane told Rex that, when he couldn't sleep at night, he'd watch movies with Gigi. The two sat down in front of the television, and Rex turned it on. A Blanca Morales news report started, and showed the body bag being wheeled out of Victor's house. She announced that Victor was dead. Shane watched wide-eyed as Brody appeared on the television. Blanca attempted an interview, but Brody refused, and demanded that they leave the private property. He pushed the camera, and Blanca finally agreed to leave.\n\n\nRex turned off the television, and couldn't believe that Victor was dead. Shane wondered what had happened. Rex remembered taking the gun out of his safe. Shane wondered who had killed Victor, but Rex didn't think it mattered. He added that many people had wanted Victor dead. Rex thought that he and Shane were free of Victor. Rex warned that they shouldn't celebrate Victor's death, because it would disrespect Gigi's memory.\n\n\nShane complained that Jack was still walking around \"free and easy.\" Rex reminded him that Jack had lost his father, just like Shane had lost his mother. Shane solemnly figured that Jack and Victor had finally gotten what they'd deserved. Rex thought it was time for them to put the bad times behind them, and forget about punishing the Mannings.\n\n\nRex and Shane sat down to watch a movie, and found that Blanca was no longer on the television. They talked about how angry Brody had seemed on the news show. Rex wanted Shane to help find a movie to watch, but Shane was tired. Rex made sure that Shane was all right. Shane said goodnight, and went up the stairs. When Shane was gone, Rex closed the living room doors.\n\n\nTomas entered the diner, and was glad to find Baz. He wondered why Baz wasn't at Capricorn, but Baz reminded his father that they were supposed to meet there two hours before. Baz wondered what had been more important to Tomas than listening to Baz's music. Tomas claimed to have had a flat tire, but Baz didn't believe him. Baz wanted the real reason. Tomas admitted that he hated that T\u00e9a hadn't left Victor as soon as she'd found out who he really was. Baz wondered what Tomas could do about it.\n\n\nTomas told Baz that he'd fought with T\u00e9a, and had thought that driving around would calm him down after the fight. When he'd realized he was late for his plans with Baz, he'd gotten a flat tire. He assured Baz that it had nothing to do with Baz's music. Tomas wanted to hear the music. He thought it might make his bad day better. Baz reluctantly handed Tomas his MP3 player, and said that the music was better since he'd started working with Starr.\n\n\nA short while later, Tomas had Baz's headphones on. Tomas was disappointed how short the song was, because he loved the way it had been arranged. He apologized for not understanding Baz's music before, and related that Baz and Starr made a great team. \"Musically,\" Baz clarified. Tomas wondered if Baz wanted more than a musical partnership with Starr, but Baz didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\nTomas and Baz walked outside, joking around, and bumped into Blanca. She wondered why John hadn't yet detained Tomas. To the confusion of the men, Blanca informed them that Victor had been shot and killed.\n\n\nBrody returned to T\u00e9a and Dani, and Dani demanded to know if Brody had any more information. He didn't, but she wondered when he would. He assured her that John would find something soon. He had to go back to the station, but suggested that the women get a hotel room for the night. He again expressed his sympathy for their loss. \"Find out who did this to my father,\" Dani told him, and he left.\n\n\nTomas and Baz entered the house, and expressed their sympathy for T\u00e9a and Dani. Tomas comforted his sister, and Baz hugged Dani. Tomas remembered his conversation with Dorian, when Dorian had told him that Todd would always be the love of Blair's life.\n\n\nBrody returned to the station and found John. He wondered if Jack had been any help, but Jack hadn't had any information. Brody related that T\u00e9a and Dani had been \"too broken\" to point fingers at anyone. John and Brody wanted to know each other's opinions, but neither had any ideas. John walked away to see if there had been any word on Todd's whereabouts. Brody looked at a picture of Liam, and smiled as he said that the only person who might have told someone about Liam's paternity was gone. \"And the truth is buried with him,\" he added.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The man we've known for 8 years as Todd Manning who is now found out to be Victor Lord Jr. has been shot to death. Tea, Dani, Jack, Starr and Blair are all devastated. Yet others are clearly relieved. Nobody has seen or heard from original Todd and he is a prime suspect since Blair knows he had a gun and admitted he might use it on Victor. Jack adamantly believes original Todd did it and that John will let him get away with it because John blames Jack for Gigi Morasco's death as well as current Todd for letting his son get away with it. Tomas has also been unaccounted for during the shooting when Sebastian wonders where his father has been for the last 2 hours when he forgot to meet his son at Capricorn and has no credible alibi. Tomas admits that he will not rest until his sister gets rid of current Todd and we remember Dorian informing him that Blair has a terrible problem being unable to get over Todd and find another man. Rex also returns after being gone and unaccounted for in the storm when Shane asks but does not get a straight answer from his dad where he's been. Brody is also similarly \"spooked\" and under suspicion when we recall his intent to \"silence\" current Todd after current Todd threatened to let it be known that Brody is not Liam's father and Brody's admitting that he might seriously consider killing Todd for that and the fact that he let Jack get away with Gigi's death. Yet there is no proof or revelation of who did, in fact, do it, however.",
