It wasn't long before the two women began trading stories about their past misdeeds. As they talked about all of the things that they had done wrong, Tina and Roxy appeared to forge a friendship. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Bo expressed his concern for Jessica. Tess was annoyed when she learned that Bo's worry stemmed from a recent conversation with John. However, Tess managed to calm Bo's fears without raising his suspicions. After Bo left, Tess and Leo, her contractor, went to inspect his work on a secret room. \n\n\nTess was satisfied with what she saw in the basement. Leo had built a cozy room, which was fully furnished and was completely soundproof. A flat-screen television was mounted on one wall. The television was hooked up to various security cameras, located throughout the house. The opposite wall consisted mainly of glass and had a security door. The lock on the door was digital and would only open the door when a code was keyed in. \n\n\nUnfortunately, Tina's dog, David Vickers, followed Tess down to the basement. When Tina went in search of her pooch, she found more than David Vickers. Tina stumbled upon Tess and Leo as they were talking about the secret room. Tess appeared less than pleased to see her aunt. \n\n\nJohn was at the police station studying a picture that was captured by a security camera on the day of Ramsey's murder. The picture showed a blurry image of a woman being wheeled out of Ramsey's apartment shortly after his death. John arranged for Fish to clean up the image in the hopes of identifying the woman in the photograph. \n\n\nIn Marty's bedroom, Todd made the startling announcement that Starr had decided to give her baby to Todd to raise. Marty believed every word that Todd said as he spun his tale. In Todd's version, Starr realized that Marcie was an unfit parent. Starr then decided that the best home for her baby would be with Todd. Marty was happy for Todd and suggested that she might make new living arrangements. \n\n\nMarcie was at the hospital, for a childbirth class with Starr, when she ran into Michael. Michael was happy for Marcie but he made it clear that he did not want to have any part in Marcie's life if she continued with her plans to adopt Todd's grandchild. Michael felt that Marcie was in denial about the threat that Todd posed. Marcie was disappointed by Michael's reluctance to compromise. She did try to reach out to Michael, though. Marcie invited Michael to the childbirth class before she walked away.\t\n\n\nStarr felt uncomfortable, being a teenager among adult couples, in the childbirth class. She told Blair that she felt like a walking example of an irresponsible teen. She was also embarrassed that Cole was not with her. Blair reminded Starr that the class was about the baby and what Starr could expect from childbirth. Blair advised Starr to focus on that and not worry about what others were thinking. Marcie soon joined them and the three sat down for the class. In the hallway, Michael kept himself hidden as he peeked through the window to watch the class. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd has a \"plan\" which he reveals to Marty. He tells her that he is going to raise Starr's baby and she can help him. She seems a bit confused as to why he is so \"confident\" that it will work. But he seems to believe that he can have things his way. Meanwhile, John is investigating Todd's home with surveillance cameras and suspects \"Jessica\" of knowing Todd's secrets. Bo goes to talk to his niece. Tess makes efforts \"play Jessica\" and give Bo no reason to suspect that she is not herself, but she cannot answer his questions. Meanwhile, Tess and the contractor go down into the basement and forget to close and lock the door. Tina's dog follows them unseen while they are distracted. Tina then goes after her dog and asks them what their big \"secret\" is. Starr is still adamant about having Marcie adopt her baby with or without Michael or Cole on board with her plan. Blair and Marcie both accompany her to her birthing class. But Todd spies upon them and has \"other plans.\" Cole reveals to Langston that he and Starr are not getting back together, and he may have a better \"connection\" to her.",
