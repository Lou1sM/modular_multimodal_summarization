    "soap_central": "\n Law & Ardor \n\n\nAs Matthew's case was about to resume in court, he asked Destiny if she thought he was doing the wrong thing. She answered truthfully, and advised him that his parents would be thrilled if, someday, they were able to see him doing the things that he used to do. Greg wondered if Shaun was angry when he saw the tape of Greg and Rachel together. Rachel assured him that it was only a \"silly dance-off,\" and Shaun was not angry. Elijah was surprised to learn that Ross was giving T\u00e9a an unconditional divorce.\n\n\nOnce the judge called the court to order, T\u00e9a summoned her first witness to the stand. Elijah objected to Loretta Hogan, who entered the courtroom in her wheelchair. He maintained that he had not been notified of the witness, though T\u00e9a insisted she had followed all of the proper channels. The judge allowed the witness to take the stand, and the young woman recounted her life as a gymnast and the freak accident that caused her life, as she knew it, to be over. She confessed that Dr. Evans had performed her surgery and, to everyone's surprise, she suddenly stood up and walked around.\n\n\nNora and Bo looked at their son with horror on their faces as Rachel, and then Nora, decried the use of T\u00e9a's theatrics. Ms. Hogan prattled on about Dr. Evans as Elijah objected to the stunt. His objection was denied. He pointed out that the woman had made her decision for surgery at the age of 18, not 15, as Matthew was.\n\n\nGreg Evans was the next to take the stand. He confirmed that he had been practicing for twelve  years and had performed hundreds of surgeries. T\u00e9a pointed out that there had been many magazine articles lauding the doctor and his technique. He agreed that he had received a consulting fee from Clint Buchanan to examine Matthew, and that he had never lost a patient. Elijah pointed out that Matthew's parents had been pushed into the consultation, because it wasn't either of them who had requested it.\n\n\nElijah continued to question Greg, asking about the risks of the surgery, if a patient could become a quadriplegic or if they could die. He balked at Greg when the doctor tried to clarify his answers. He would only allow Greg to answer with a yes. Greg added that he felt that Matthew was old enough and mature enough to decide his fate, even if he hadn't made some wise decisions the night of his accident. He believed that Matthew had more time to consider his options regarding his surgery.\n\n\nT\u00e9a resumed questioning, wondering what would happen if Matthew waited until he was 18 to pursue the surgery. Greg felt that the teen would develop infections or lesions. He wondered why the boy's parents were so resistant to the surgery. He thought they were afraid of losing their control. As Greg continued to elaborate on his true feelings for Matthew's parents and his opinion that they were taking the safe choice out of fear, among other things, Rachel jumped up. \"That's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard,\" she shouted.\n\n\nAt the caf\u00e9, Carlotta confessed that she had a dream about Cristian and his old studio. While they both agreed that they missed it, Cris assured her that his new apartment living was fine. Carlotta hoped that Fish settled down with a nice girl.\n\n\nAt the police station, Layla attempted to find out how Fish was going to tell his parents the truth about being gay, but he brushed her off and cited his concern with the case he was working on. He headed for John's office and resumed listening to the tracking device, planted at Lowell's headquarters. John delivered Cole to a cell. He apologized but explained that it had to be done to throw people off if they were suspicious. He worried that Cole's cover had been blown, and deemed Cole finished with his undercover work after selling drugs to the mayor's son.\n\n\nJohn promised that both Lowell and Keaton, the dirty cop, would be taken care of, and that the police would take over where Cole had left off. Upstairs, Keaton looked for John, and Layla informed him that Fish was in John's office. Demanding to know why Fish was in there without him, Keaton burst in as Fish listened to Lowell. Quickly making up an excuse that he was fixing John's computer, Fish gasped as Keaton began to grab at the equipment.\n\n\nCole berated himself for selling drugs to the mayor's son, but John assured him that he had to do what Serg i had wanted him to do. John needed to find out if Lowell knew about Cole selling the drugs. He figured that if Cole's cover was indeed blown, that he'd be safest in the jail cell. Cole asked that John fill in Starr and Marty on the latest. John headed off to check in with Fish.\n\n\nCharlie and Viki arrived at Mayor Lowell's campaign headquarters and invited the mayor to Viki's upcoming press conference. Lowell was surprised to hear that Viki planned on throwing her hat into the ring for the mayoral race. She felt that Lowell should show up at her conference, in order to support her quest for a clean campaign, one without negativity. She thought his appearance would be a \"show of confidence\" for himself.\n\n\nAs Dorian eavesdropped on a conversation between Starr and Todd at La Boulaie, she was amazed to hear that Cole was not a drug dealer, but merely working undercover for the cops. Todd refused to believe it at first, though Starr did her best to convince him otherwise. She swore that Cole was not using drugs, or selling them, and implored her father to accept it as fact. \"I'll be damned,\" Todd finally uttered, trusting that his daughter was telling him the truth. She begged him to be quiet about it as he showed concern for the safety and welfare of his daughter and granddaughter. Having heard enough, Dorian took flight, heading straight for Mayor Lowell's headquarters.\n\n\nTodd felt that he should have been advised of Cole's work, and stressed that John had gone too far. Starr assured him that John was protecting both her  and Hope. Todd thought that Cole should stop his work right away, but Starr was afraid that her father would do something to get Cole killed. She implored him to keep quiet and not let anyone know what she had confided to him. Todd consented to his daughter's request to remain silent.\n\n\nArriving at Lowell's, Dorian was surprised to find Viki and Charlie there. Even more surprised to hear why, she criticized Charlie's qualifications as Viki's campaign manager. Viki turned the tables quickly, assessing Dorian's own skills in the same position for Lowell. As soon as the couple left, Dorian eagerly advised Lowell that she had a plan for clearing his son of drug charges, citing the fact that the seller, Cole, had been working undercover.\n\n\nDorian soothed the mayor, explaining that he and John were really after the same thing, to see the drug dealers in the town put away. She only wanted to see Justin Lowell free of charges and protect Cole at the same time. Lowell praised Dorian, advising her she had \"saved the day.\" He asked her to get him out of having to go to Viki's press conference.\n\n\nAs a confused Keaton wondered about the equipment on John's desk, Keaton received a phone call from Lowell, which saved Fish. The mayor informed the cop that one of their dealers was an informant. He was angry with Keaton for not knowing who it was, and thought it possible that John was aware of both Keaton and Lowell being involved with the drug scene. Lowell worried that he would be \"fried\" if John found out about him.\n\n\nLowell informed Keaton that the spy was Cole. He wanted to know if Cole was aware that the mayor was involved. He ordered Keaton to kill Cole if he knew anything. Keaton returned to the office and told Fish he needed to leave early.\n\n\nLayla arrived at the caf\u00e9 and sat down with Cris, as Carlotta lingered, happy to see the couple together. Once Carlotta was gone, Cris showed Layla a book he had purchased for Fish, How to Tell Your Parents You're Gay. Layla praised Cris for buying it and, in answer to Cris' questioning, she admitted to trying to find some good in her experience.  She thought that if she hadn't sworn off men, she would have kissed Cris for buying the book and being so thoughtful. They passed the book back and forth, each thinking the other should present it to Fish.\n\n\nViki and Charlie arrived, and Carlotta readily agreed to support Viki for mayor. Dorian walked in and expressed her regrets for Lowell's inability to attend Viki's press conference. Viki stressed that she wanted a positive and clean campaign, and couldn't believe that Lowell would pass up the opportunity to show his face. She wondered if that meant his take on local issues was weak and he needed to fight a dirty campaign. Dorian denied that the mayor was fearful, and was confident her man would win. She accepted a challenge on his behalf for a debate with Viki.\n\n\nWalking by her son's table, Carlotta spotted the book that Cris and Layla were pushing around. Cris tried to cover up the title, but it was too late.\n\n\nTodd showed up at Lowell Headquarters with a favor to ask in return for his newspaper's support of the mayor. He reported that he had learned that Cole was working undercover in a drug sting, and he was concerned for Starr and Hope. \"Yank Cole off the operation,\" he demanded. He was afraid of retaliation on his family members.\n\n\nJohn returned to his office and learned that part of the feed from Lowell's office was missing due to Keaton's interference. Luckily, the conversations had been recorded on the computer. As he and Fish heard Lowell speaking about Cole, John cringed. There was a disturbing jolt to his operation and Cole's welfare. They heard the threat to Cole and realized the mayor was talking on the phone to Keaton.\n\n\nMaking a frantic call to Cole that went unanswered, Starr expressed worry for \"messing up.\" As Cole remained in his cell, he received a visitor. It was Keaton.\n\n\n",
