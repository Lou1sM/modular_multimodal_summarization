John informed the nearest officer that they had taken in the wrong guy, but the cop insisted that he just did what he was told. John accused Ross of covering for Eli and wondered where Eli was. The cop told John they hadn't searched the premises. John asked where \"the premises\" was, and needed to get there as soon as possible. Ross told the cops to let him go, but they wouldn't since he was still wanted in the states.\n\n\n Pointing a gun at Eli, Blair warned him that she would pull the trigger. Eli lunged at her and the two struggled over the gun. Eli pulled her into a kiss, but then a shot was fired. Eli fell to the ground unconscious, knocking a lit candle over. As Blair ran to Eli, she noticed that the candle had started a fire. She got a pitcher of water off a table and poured it on the fire. When that didn't work, she grabbed a blanket to cover the fire, but the blanket caught on fire. She threw the blanket, spreading the fire.\n\n\nBlair implored Eli to get up and tried to lift him. John burst through the doors, pointing a gun. As John tried to get in, part of the ceiling collapsed. Blair yelled to John that Eli was unconscious, but she couldn't leave him. John promised he would come back for Eli, but she needed to get out. John pulled her out of the house and closed the doors, asking how hurt Eli was. Blair confessed that she had shot him.\n\n\nAs part of the ceiling collapsed on Eli, Blair brought John up to speed about the phone call from Kelly, how Blair had confronted Eli, and how the two had struggled over the gun. John gave her his phone and told her to report the fire as he ran into the house to get Eli. Blair begged him to come back out and he stumbled out of the house without Eli. He claimed that the fire was too hot and it had spread too much. Just then, Ross ran to the house and asked what happened and where his brother was.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Jess told Dr. Wright that she might need treatment for RH disease after all. She explained that her fianc\u00e9 was compatible, but the other man wasn't. Dr. Wright informed her that there would be enough time to start treatment after the paternity test was done, but Jess wanted to wait to do a paternity test until after the baby was born. She wanted to take every precaution possible. Viki entered and asked if everything was all right.\n\n\nJess insisted everything was fine and Dr. Wright told her that they would talk soon. Viki again asked Jess what was wrong. Jess explained that she was just paranoid about RH disease and the fact that one of her personalities could surface again and affect the health of the baby. Viki's phone rang and she announced that it was Todd.\n\n\nAt the park, Starr received a text message from Cole, but yelled that she was mad at him. \"Why are you mad at me?\" James walked up and asked, thinking she was talking to him. Starr asked if he was following her, but he claimed that he had gone to the park to study for his GED. However, he had thought that he would run into her there. He asked her if she wanted to talk about what had happened with Cole.\n\n\nStarr wondered why she would want to confide in him, but James claimed that they were friends. Starr didn't think that was a very good idea. James agreed, because then he'd have to tell her that she was wrong and Cole was right. James explained to a stunned Starr that Cole was trying to protect her and do the right thing. Starr stated that she didn't need protection. James assured Starr that if her mother was anything like her, Starr had nothing to worry about.\n\n\nStarr told James that he didn't know her mother. \"But I know you,\" he told her. He explained how amazed he was when she stood up to Bull. He began complimenting her and the two stepped closer together. Just then, Starr's phone rang and it was Todd. Starr had to go, but James wanted to go with her. Starr refused and left. James sat down at a table and began to study.\n\n\nLangston couldn't believe that Ford would accuse Hannah of assaulting him when she was innocent. Ford explained that Eli had threatened James and Langston \u2013 \"people I care about.\" He said that Eli had gotten to him before he could go to the police about his attack. Langston didn't believe him, but he insisted it was the truth. She told him that the guy that cared about other people wasn't him, it was James. She said that James gave her someone to compare Ford to. Ford wanted to prove to Langston that he had changed.\n\n\nLangston wanted to know how Ford had put himself in position to mess with a killer. Ford informed her that he had found something out about Eli's past and blackmailed him. Langston was disgusted that he put his loved ones in danger for money. He explained that he did it because he wanted to get his brother away from their father. Langston admitted that everything Ford had seen happen between her and James was to make Ford jealous. He confided that it had worked.\n\n\nLangston was surprised, but then told him that she never knew what was real with him. Ford admitted that she deserved someone better, like James or Markko, who put her up on a pedestal. He tried to convince her that he was different, and promised that things would be different if she trusted him. Ford explained that he knew what he was missing and he would do anything not to miss it anymore. He pulled Langston into a kiss.\n\n\nDestiny ran into Nate at his second job at the diner. They made small talk but then Shaun entered. Destiny wanted to know if Dani had seen T\u00e9a, but Shaun informed her that it was too late. Destiny was upset that Dani didn't get to see her mother again. Greg entered and Shaun asked why he was there, and where T\u00e9a's remains were, because Greg was supposed to escort them back to Llanview. Greg explained that he had business at the hospital and that the remains would be shipped securely.\n\n\nAn angry Shaun blamed Greg for T\u00e9a's death, but Destiny said that he was making things worse by blaming Greg. The brothers agreed to put their differences aside, but that didn't stop Shaun from glaring at Greg. Greg explained that T\u00e9a died peacefully and comfortably, but that Dani was hurting. Destiny came up with the idea of getting food for Dani and Todd since those that are grieving sometimes forget to take care of themselves. Greg thought it was a great idea and offered to pay the bill for it.\n\n\nLater, Dr. Wright entered and Greg left, citing work at the hospital. Shaun explained that T\u00e9a had died and she hugged him. She believed that Greg had done all he could. Shaun wasn't so sure about that because he thought that Greg had been acting weird. Dr. Wright thought it was because Greg was used to saving his patients, not losing them. The two agreed to spend a little time together before she went back to work and left the diner.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Greg left a message for Eli. Greg needed to talk to him about T\u00e9a's death.\n\n\nDani opened T\u00e9a's duffel bag of things and pulled out the statuette of the Empire State Building. She reminisced about their trip to New York, and making wishes at the fountain. Todd entered as Dani was smelling one of T\u00e9a's shirts. She was sad as she realized that the smell of her mother would eventually fade away, just like T\u00e9a did. Todd asked if she wanted food, but Dani didn't want to see anybody. Suddenly, Dani threw all of T\u00e9a's stuff at Todd, saying she didn't need any more memories of her mother. The ones she already had \"sucked.\" She hated her mother and always would.\n\n\nDani began to lash out and badmouth her mother. She ripped T\u00e9a's necklace off her neck and threw it. Todd grabbed Dani and shook her, telling her to knock it off. Todd admitted that he was angry too, but they couldn't bring T\u00e9a back to yell at her, so they would just have to live with things the way they were. They both agreed that they loved T\u00e9a despite their anger, and Dani became upset that she broke the necklace, and reminisced about the day her mother gave it to her.\n\n\nTodd divulged that T\u00e9a knew they would hate her for what she did, but she was all right with it. She thought the hatred would bring Todd and Dani together, but Todd hoped it would be something better that brought him and his daughter together. The doorbell rang and Todd answered it to Destiny and Nate carrying bags of food. They knew Dani needed friends. Dani entered the foyer and hugged her friends who offered the food to her.\n\n\nDani thanked them for coming and for the food, and they expressed their sorrow at her loss. The doorbell rang again, and Todd answered it to Starr, Jess and Viki. They all comforted Todd and entered the living room. Todd thanked Starr for visiting because Dani needed her sister, and hoped that he didn't take her away from anything important. \"Nothing could keep me away,\" she assured him.\n\n\nViki told Destiny what a good idea the food was, and that everyone was lucky to have her. Destiny explained that she wanted to help, but food was the only thing she could think of. She explained that her brothers did their best for T\u00e9a, but it wasn't good enough.\n\n\nStarr wished Blair was there. Todd was annoyed because Blair promised to be there for Dani, but she'd rather be \"honeymooning with Elijah Clarke.\" Starr disagreed with him and told him to sit down for what she was about to tell him.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dani is distraught that her mother died without wanting to be with her on her last few days and admits to Todd that she hates her mother for what she did. He tries to tell her she cannot say that but admits he does also. Meanwhile, Destiny and Nate know that they have to be there for Dani so they bring food over to the house. Viki and Jessica also go to be there for them. Starr and James follow them. After Starr finds out that Cole knew that Eli was a serial killer yet said nothing knowing full well that her mother was marrying and eloping with him, she is very angry with him. But James seems to know how to say the right things to her. Robert admits to Langston that he lied for Eli because he threatened the people Robert loved including her. She asks him how he could say that he loves or cares about anybody except himself. She wants to distrust him but they end up kissing. In Tahiti, Blair pulls the gun on Eli and it goes off accidentally, shooting him. She regrets what she's done and tries to help him. But somehow, a fire starts. John comes by and makes sure she's out of there before it's too late. But they are both unsuccessful, it seems, in saving Eli. Ross rushes to the house to see that they have left his brother to die in a fire.",
