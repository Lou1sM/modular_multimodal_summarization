    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Rama searched on the computer online for women, who could be possible matches for Cristian:  She Hearts Art, Loveless in Llanview, and Erica, See You in Pine Valley.  Cristian rejected all of the choices and emphasized that he was happy with his job and with his painting.  Rama insisted that she would fill the void in Cristian's life, as Vimal walked in.\n\n\nRama hugged Vimal, and Cristian explained that Rama had been playing Cristian's matchmaker.  Vimal then announced that Victor Lord Jr. had been murdered.  When Rama stated that Victor had been a tyrant, Vimal disagreed and declared that Victor has been a saint.  After Rama remarked that somebody had held a reason to want Victor dead, Vimal exclaimed that he needed to leave, because he had left the iron on.  Rama noted that he was lying and said, \"We don't have an iron.  I send everything to the cleaners.\"\n\n\nCristian decided to call Blair and offer his condolences about Victor's death, and Rama hoped that Blair still cared about Cristian.  Rama exclaimed that Blair and Cristian were very comfortable with one another.  After Cristian told Rama to give it up, Rama went into Cristian's profile on the computer to look up his past loves:  Layla, Sarah, Vanessa, Roseanne, and Jessica.  Rama cheered when she realized that Jessica Brennan would be the perfect choice.\n\n\nCristian insisted that although he and Jessica had been first loves, it would never work, because too much had happened since.  Rama had noticed that there had still been a spark between Jessica and Cristian, and added that Cristian was single, and that Jessica was no longer sick.  Rama declared that Cristian should take charge of his life, or that he would die in his studio, surrounded by buckets of paint and an old dog to keep him company.  Rama believed that Cristian should start with Jessica, because he had the chance to recapture those old feelings from their past love.  Rama cried, \"And hurry...because you only have so much life to live.\"\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Natalie found Rex reading a newspaper article about Victor's death.  Rex insisted that he was not celebrating Victor's death, but that the world was better off, and that he and Natalie had both hated Victor.  Natalie reminded Rex that he should feel bad for T\u00e9a and the kids, but Rex refused to feel sorry for Jack, since Jack was the reason that Rex and Shane had to mourn Gigi's loss.\n\n\nNatalie informed Rex that the police department was still waiting on the forensics for Victor's case.  She then wondered why Rex had exhumed Gigi's body, and Rex revealed that he had needed to see Gigi to know, for sure, that she was dead.  Rex guessed that kids had played a prank and scratched out the date of death on Gigi's gravestone.  When Rex commented that he was supposed to have found Gigi in Kentucky, Natalie noted that Rex had actually found Kim, who had flown directly to Clint.\n\n\nNatalie exclaimed that she had discovered Kim all over Clint at Llanfair, and she wondered what Kim would want, since Clint was broke.  Rex indicated that Clint would either catch on to Kim, or that Kim would move on, because Clint was poor.  Natalie just feared that Kim was looking for another way to ruin their family.\n\n\nWhen Rex told Natalie to keep her eye on Clint, Natalie revealed that she had moved out of Llanfair.  She explained that she, Brody, and Liam had leased their own place, because that was what families did.  Natalie then acknowledged that she had to return to the police station and stated that she would still check in on Rex.  As Natalie left, she mentioned that they hoped to determine the kind of gun that had killed Victor.  Rex walked over to the safe and removed his gun.  He held the gun up, aimed, and pointed it.\n\n\nIn the room in Kentucky, Kim carried flowers to the girl in the bed and updated her about what had happened in Llanview with \"the redhead.\"  Kim informed her girl that David was the easiest part of the whole deal, but that Clint had not looked so hot, even though Clint had still managed to maintain his spark.  Kim yelled that Natalie had flown in on her broom and had thrown Kim out of Llanfair.  Kim laughed, as she stated that Natalie would eventually be calling her mom.\n\n\nKim noticed that Rex had kind of lost it at Gigi's grave, because he had been dealing with his grief over losing Gigi.  Kim told her girl that the date of death had been scratched out on Gigi's gravestone, and that she had worried about Rex when they had opened the coffin.  Kim expressed that it had all been a little creepy.  Kim declared that Rex had acted a little nuts, and that Shane had shown up.  Kim exclaimed that it had all been a total freak show.\n\n\nKim then showed her girl a new picture of Sierra Rose and indicated that her girl had to get better, because that would make Sierra Rose a happier little girl.  Kim pulled out a magazine to catch her girl up on the latest gossip, and she discovered an article about Cutter.  The article announced that two con artists, Cutter and Aubrey, had tried to pull a con on Joey Buchanan.  Kim cried that she had to rush right back to Llanview and ran out of the room.\n\n\nIn the Minute Man Hotel, as Aubrey primped herself in the dingy bathroom, she realized that she needed a new life.  Cutter burst through the door and announced that not only had he gotten the donuts, he had also gotten the job.  Cutter declared that he was the new front desk clerk of the hotel.  After Aubrey stated that it was a little drastic, Cutter claimed that he wanted to change for Aubrey.\n\n\nCutter realized that Aubrey was finished with doing cons, and he knew that she had wanted to leave him, so he was willing to change for her.  Aubrey was stunned that Cutter would try to do that for her.  When Cutter called Aubrey her old name, Christine, again, Aubrey indicated that she no longer knew who Christine was, and that she wanted to remain Aubrey.  Cutter asked her to remain Aubrey, and then he kissed her.\n\n\nIn bed, Aubrey insisted that she did not want Cutter to change completely.  Cutter then realized that he needed to return to work, so he leaped out of bed, as he yelled, \"Live the dream.\"  Aubrey declared Cutter an inspiration and picked up the newspaper to search for a job.\n\n\nLater, Aubrey walked into the Buenos Dias with the newspaper, and Rama greeted her.  Rama realized that Aubrey was job hunting, and Aubrey announced that she and Cutter were reuniting.  Aubrey considered reverting back to her old name.  Aubrey voiced, \"Although I do really like Aubrey Wentworth...even though it belongs to someone else.\"  Back at the Minute Man, Cutter opened the door of his room to Kim and said, \"Aubrey.\"\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica and Clint discussed Victor's death, and Jessica stated that she was worried about Viki.  When Jessica remarked that they had not even named a suspect, Clint believed that Natalie might know something.  Jessica sarcastically remarked that they should put Natalie and Brody on the case, so that it would be solved, that is, if they could keep their hands off each other long enough.  Clint reminded Jessica that Natalie had moved out.  However, Jessica was still angry that Natalie had kicked Kim out of Llanfair.\n\n\nJessica told Clint that if he wanted a second chance with Kim, he should \"go for it.\"  After Jessica asked what had happened between Clint and Kim during their meeting, Clint was evasive and only said that they had done a little catching up.  Clint reminded Jessica that he was under house arrest, and that he was lucky to be alive.  He insisted that was all he thought about.  Jessica then announced that she and Ford had kissed.\n\n\nClint yelled that he had not forgotten what Ford had done to Jessica, and Jessica insisted that Ford only stayed around because he loved his son.  Jessica realized that Bobby had seen something in Jessica that had reminded him of Tess, so he had kissed her.  Jessica understood that it hurt Ford too much to be around Jessica.  Jessica then declared that she and Bobby had decided not to see each other anymore.  Clint stressed that Jessica deserved a man who loved her and the kids.  Clint knew that Jessica would find that man...or that he would find her.\n\n\nAt the police station, John talked on the phone to Viki, who was worried about Todd.  When Viki mentioned that Todd was not stupid, John wondered if Todd was impulsive and prone to fits of rage, and if he was capable of killing a man, as John looked at Brody.  After John got off of the phone, he told Brody that Todd was only one suspect.  Brody reminded John that Todd had publicly threatened Victor, and that Todd was on the wind.  Brody insisted that the innocent did not run.\n\n\nJohn noted that Todd Manning was a stranger, and that they did not know what he was capable of.  John reminded Brody that they did not have the gun that had killed Victor.  John told Brody to start with Victor's enemies, and to work backwards.  John observed, \"I'm guessing Manning wasn't even the only one that threatened him this week.\"  John ordered Brody to get assistance from the squad, so that they could find other suspects, because it was just a matter of time until they found them.\n\n\nAfter John walked off, Vimal ran in and demanded to know from Brody who else knew the secret.  Vimal realized that only he, Marty, and Victor knew that Liam was John's son, so he wanted to know if Brody had killed Victor.  Vimal feared that Brody had killed Victor, and because Brody was a Navy SEAL, Vimal believed that Brody could make Vimal disappear as well.\n\n\nWhen John entered the room, Vimal claimed that he wanted to ensure that they found Victor's killer.  After John asked Vimal about Victor, Vimal insisted that Victor had been very kind to him.  Vimal then announced that he had information that would lead John to the killer.  Vimal said that Todd Manning had broken into the Sun and had wished ill will against Victor, so Todd was obviously the killer.  As Vimal left the station, he pleaded with Brody not to make him disappear.\n\n\nIn the lobby at Llanfair, Viki feared that she had lost both of her brothers, when Todd walked in.  After Viki announced that Victor was dead, Todd responded that he already knew.  Todd held up the latest edition of the Banner and declared Victor a jackass.  When Viki asked if the newspaper was the first time that Todd had known about Victor's murder, Todd exclaimed, \"Victor and I weren't close.  It's not like we had that...uh, otherworldly twin thing, where you cut one of us, and the other one bleeds.  I only knew the man well enough to hate him.\"\n\n\nTodd realized that Viki thought he had killed Victor, however, Viki denied that and stated that the police were searching for Todd, because he had taken a gun from Blair's safe.  Todd indicated that just because he'd had a gun did not mean that he had killed Victor.  Todd was still hurt and insulted that Viki had believed Victor's lies, and Viki reflected that they had wanted Todd back so much, they had been willing to believe what Victor had told them.  Todd said, \"Let me ask you something, Viki.  Did Victor ever stand up for you?  Did he ever protect your children?  Was he ever a brother to you?  The world's better off without that parasite.\"\n\n\nViki picked up the phone to call John, so that Todd could tell John that he had not killed Victor.  Todd refused and claimed that even if he had killed Victor, he would not have shot him.  Outraged, Todd stormed out of Llanfair, as Viki begged him to not run away, because running was not the answer.  Jessica wheeled Clint into the lobby, and Viki took Clint out of the room.  Jessica answered the door and found Cristian.\n\n\nTodd walked up to John at the police station and said, \"Heard you're looking for me.\" \n\n\n",
