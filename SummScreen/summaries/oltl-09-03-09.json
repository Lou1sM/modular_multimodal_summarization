To Cristian's surprise, Carlotta appeared thrilled to learn that her son was gay.  Citing Cristian's failed relationships with women, Carlotta stated that she wasn't surprised to learn that Cristian was gay.  As Cristian tried to explain that he wasn't gay, Carlotta continued to offer him her support.  Amused by Carlotta's reaction, Layla hesitated before informing Carlotta that Cristian was a straight male and that the book was meant for a friend.  Upon learning that her son wasn't gay, Carlotta assured him that he would find the right girl to settle down with some day.\n\n\nAfterward, Layla wondered why Cristian didn't feel comfortable presenting Fish with the book.  Commenting that Cristian was a great guy, Layla was certain that Fish would benefit more if he received the book from Cristian, rather than from Layla .    At Layla's urging, Cris agreed to present Fish with the book, and encourage Fish to reveal the truth about his sexuality to his parents.   Cristian couldn't believe that Carlotta had been receptive to the idea of his being gay.  Layla and Cris joked about Cristian finding the right girl some day, and the fact that Layla had sworn off men.\n\n\nIn the courtroom, Rachel fumed as Greg testified on the witness stand.  Convinced that Greg wasn't concerned about Matthew's well-being, Rachel blurted out that Greg was only helping Matthew because Greg had an agenda, and she pleaded with the judge to allow her to testify.  While T\u00e9a welcomed Rachel's testimony, Nora, who was well aware of T\u00e9a's underhanded tactics, asked her daughter to reconsider.\n\n\nOn the stand, Rachel told the court that Greg wasn't fighting for Matthew's cause.  Rachel believed that Greg's actions were meant to cause her grief.  T\u00e9a questioned if Rachel's outburst was an attempt to discredit Greg and help her mother's case.  Denying that she had an ulterior motive, Rachel related that Greg had accused her of being afraid to lose control.  T\u00e9a encouraged Rachel to continue informing the court of her past conversations with Greg.  \n\n\nConsumed by her anger with Greg, Rachel announced that she knew Greg very well.  T\u00e9a questioned if Greg was aware of Rachel's past.  In response to T\u00e9a's badgering, Rachel admitted that she had informed Greg that she was a recovering drug addict.   Sensing a prime opportunity to attack, T\u00e9a asked if Greg knew that Rachel had turned to a life of prostitution to support her drug habit.  Greg was stunned when Rachel admitted that she was once a prostitute.\n\n\nAs Nora, Matthew, Bo, and Greg looked on in horror, T\u00e9a reminded Rachel of her past involvement with Georgie Phillips.  The mention of Georgie Phillips caused Rachel's face to drop.   T\u00e9a ordered Rachel to inform the court of what happened to Georgie Phillips.  As Matthew ordered T\u00e9a to stop interrogating his sister, Rachel blurted out that she had killed Georgie in self defense.  A relentless T\u00e9a, maintained that Rachel had been sober when she killed Georgie.  T\u00e9a claimed that Rachel had murdered Georgie because Rachel feared that Georgie would cause the breakup of Nora and Bo.\n\n\nHumiliated, Rachel fled the courtroom, and Greg ran after her. A livid Nora referred to T\u00e9a as a monster.  Amazed that T\u00e9a would attempt to destroy Rachel on the stand, Nora reminded T\u00e9a that Rachel was once her friend.   Admitting that her cross-examination of Rachel had been difficult, T\u00e9a contended that Rachel had attacked her witness, and that T\u00e9a did what was necessary to prevent Rachel from discrediting Greg.  As T\u00e9a declared that she was trying to protect her client, Matthew yelled, \"You're fired!\"   Pleased by Matthew's concern for his sister,  a smile crossed the face of both Nora and Bo.\n\n\nT\u00e9a tried to convince Matthew to reconsider, but Nora intervened.  Reminding T\u00e9a that Matthew was capable of making his own decisions, Nora advised T\u00e9a that she had been fired.  As Nora continued to lash out at her, T\u00e9a shocked Nora when T\u00e9a announced that Rachel would eventually get over the attack.  An angered Nora exclaimed, \"I wish you had a child, maybe then you would know how it feels when someone goes after your child!\"  T\u00e9a insisted that she would allow her children to make their own decisions, if she had any.\n\n\nAfter blaming Nora for Rachel's drug abuse, T\u00e9a also forewarned that Nora would be the cause of Matthew's confinement to a wheelchair.  T\u00e9a stated that Nora was incapable of ever admitting that she was wrong.  Realizing that she had struck a nerve, T\u00e9a shouted, \"When it comes to your kids, you are their worst enemy!\"  Nora responded by slapping T\u00e9a.  Fed up with their courtroom antics, the judge ordered the bailiff to place both T\u00e9a and Nora under arrest.  Matthew, Bo, and Destiny watched as Nora and T\u00e9a were carted off to jail.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, as Starr placed a frantic call to Cole, Shaun arrived and informed her that Todd had instructed him to guard Starr and Hope with his life.   When Starr expressed her fear that Todd's actions might cause harm to Cole, Shaun insisted upon knowing what was going on.  Unwilling to place Cole in further danger, Starr refused to provide Shaun with any answers.\n\n\nRealizing that Shaun was consumed with thoughts of Rachel, Starr wondered what had taken place between them.   Admitting that he was aware that there was a special connection between Greg and Rachel, Shaun confided in Starr that he found it difficult to compete with his brother.  Starr advised Shaun that he didn't need to compete with Greg because Shaun was a great person.  Starr suggested that Shaun find someone else, if Rachel didn't appreciate his wonderful qualities.  \n\n\nPouring out his heart to Starr, Shaun exclaimed, I don't want anyone else.  I want Rachel!\"  Mentioning that he had a date with Rachel that night, Shaun stated that he wanted to charm her on their date.  Shaun said that he thought he was falling in love with Rachel, and he wanted her to feel the same way about him.  A supportive Starr told Shaun that Rachel should feel lucky to have found someone like him.\n\n\nGreg found Rachel weeping in Angel Square Park.   As Greg tried to console her, Rachel ordered him to stay away and exclaimed,\"You had me figured out, I am a scared little girl!  I am afraid of losing control,. When I lose control, people die!\"\n\n\nApologizing for provoking Rachel, Greg said he had no idea about her past and didn't judge her for it.  Relating that Georgie had been a sick individual, Rachel expressed guilt over murdering her.   Stating that his behavior had been a game, Greg insisted that he had only hoped to see the real Rachel.  As Rachel continued to condemn herself, Greg reminded her of the help that she had provided others.  A terrified Rachel acknowledged that she had tried to avoid her own life by interfering in the lives of those around her.   \n\n\nRachel admitted that she actually wanted Matthew to stay confined to the wheelchair, in hopes that he would remain safe.   Racked with guilt, Rachel declared, \"You wanted to see the real Rachel, well here she is!  If you were smart, you'd stay away from her!\" When Greg refused to leave her side, Rachel questioned what he wanted from her.  Greg surprised her with a kiss.\n\n\nOutside the courtroom, Matt blamed himself and worried about Rachel's state of mind.  Destiny assured Matthew that Greg would help Rachel deal with the events that had transpired in court.  Reminding Destiny that Rachel hated Greg, Matthew was certain that Greg's interference would only make the situation worse.\n\n\nInside their jail cells, T\u00e9a and Nora glared at each other.\n\n\nAt Mayor Lowell's campaign headquarters, Todd pleaded with the mayor to intervene in John's drug operation.  Todd feared that Cole's involvement might place Starr and Hope in danger.  Refusing to give Todd any information, the mayor assured Todd that he was aware of the situation and promised to handle it.   Frustrated, Todd announced that he was headed to La Boulaie to protect his family.\n\n\nDorian arrived at the campaign headquarters and questioned if the mayor had placed Starr in danger by blowing Cole's cover to anyone other than John.  Mayor Lowell denied leaking the information to anyone.  When Dorian asked if the mayor had spoken to John about the revelation that Justin's arrest had been the result of entrapment, the mayor changed the subject and began plotting against Viki.\n\n\nInside John's office at the police station, John and Fish listened to the tape in which Mayor Lowell ordered an unknown person to kill Cole.  Realizing that Officer Keaton was the unidentified person, John and Fish raced downstairs to save Cole.\n\n\nDownstairs, in Cole's cell,   Keaton approached Cole and attempted to discover if Cole was aware of the mayor's involvement in the drug trafficking ring.  Explaining that he was a member of John's task force, Keaton questioned Cole about the operation.  Convinced that Keaton was one of John's men, Cole turned his back on Keaton and sighed, \"I still can't believe that Mayor Lowell is behind this!\"  Pointing a gun at Cole, Keaton stated, \"That's all I needed to hear!\"   \n\n\nAs Keaton prepared to kill Cole, John appeared and shot Keaton.  As Keaton released his grip on Cole and fell to the ground, Cole exhaled.\n\n\nAfter determining that Keaton was still alive, John called for an ambulance to transport him to the hospital.   When John revealed to Cole that the mayor had ordered Keaton to kill him, Cole expressed his desire to protect Starr and Hope, but John prevented him from leaving.  John told Cole that he was to remain at the station until the mayor had been arrested.  Fish agreed to protect Cole, but John related that he had a better idea.\n\n\nInside John's office, Cole listened as John briefed Brody about the situation.  John regretted that he had involved Cole in the dangerous plan.  John instructed Brody to guard Cole.  Handing Brody a loaded revolver, John instructed Brody to lock the office door, and use the weapon if needed.  Afterward, John and Fish headed to Mayor Lowell's office to place the mayor under arrest.  Brody assured Cole that the situation would soon be over.\n\n\nBack at campaign headquarters, upon noticing Sergei, May or Lowell asked Dorian for a moment alone with the stranger.  As Sergei approached the mayor, Dorian watched the interaction between the two men.  The mayor was alarmed when Sergei related that Keaton was unsuccessful in performing the hit on Cole, because John had shot Keaton. While Mayor Lowell worried that Cole was aware of his involvement in the drug cartel, Sergei was more concerned that the mayor had placed Sergei in the middle of the situation.\n\n\nWhen Lowell ordered Sergei to do something, Sergei commented that he had plans to silence Cole by going after Starr and Hope.   Advising Sergei that Starr and Hope were related to his campaign manager, Lowell told Sergei that they were guarded by private security, and that Todd was also at the home.    Unfazed by Lowell's warning, Sergei had no intention of diverting from his plan.  As an intense argument ensued between the two men, Dorian interrupted and questioned if there was a problem.   \n\n\nClaiming that Sergei was a campaign worker, May or Lowell sent Dorian on a campaign errand.  While Lowell worried that Keaton might cut a deal and expose him, Sergei was only concerned with Cole, and insisted that it was necessary to send Cole a message.   A nervous Mayor Lowell instructed Sergei not to involve him in any further developments.   In a confident tone, Sergei, warned, \"Keaton failed, but I won't!\"\n\n\nIn a frantic state, Todd arrived at La Boulaie and questioned if Starr and Hope were okay.  Realizing that her father was in an anxious mood, Starr demanded to know what he had done.  Shaun left after Todd dismissed him .  Moments later, John phoned Todd and asked if Starr was okay.  Before John could warn him of the impending danger, Todd blamed John for placing Starr in harm's way, and hung up the phone.  When Starr asked if Todd had told anyone about Cole, Todd replied, \"I took care of it Starr, that's what I do!\"\n\n\nJohn and Fish stood outside Mayor Lowell's office.  John advised Fish to go strictly by the book when they placed the mayor under arrest.  With guns drawn, John and Fish entered the office and discovered Lowell was nowhere in sight.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, as Starr demanded answers from Todd, they were both startled when Sergei entered the room.  Holding them at gunpoint, Sergei revealed that he was Cole's boss and had discovered that Cole wasn't who he had claimed to be. \n\n\n",
