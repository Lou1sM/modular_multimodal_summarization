Ford stressed that he was not the same person as before, and that he had learned what was important.  \"I know I've treated you really badly in the past.  But if you...if you just give me a chance, I promise I can make it up to you.\"  Langston stated that she did not trust Ford and never would.\n\n\nFord claimed that since his brother and mother had shown up in Llanview, he had a family, and that he realized that he \"had to be better.\"  Bobby insisted that since he had almost died, he knew that he had to change.  Langston said, \"It all sounds great, but somewhere between your near-death experience, your family showing up, your weeks in the hospital, you still managed to have sex with someone, who could have given you an STD.\"\n\n\nFord insisted that Langston was the only girl that he wanted, but Langston stressed that Ford \"brought out the worst\" in her.  Bobby begged to know what he could do to change and claimed that the other girls had just been a way for him to forget Langston.  After Langston revealed that she might believe that Ford was trying to break down his walls, she claimed to have walls of her own.  However, Langston announced that she was not dropping Ford's class.\n\n\nBobby asked if it were true that they would still get to see each other a couple of days each week, and Langston answered, \"Yes, but if you make another pass at me, I'll bring you up on sexual harassment charges, and you'll lose your job.\"  Ford insisted that losing his job would not matter to him, and Langston remarked that Ford would soon be on to the next girl.  As Langston walked off, Bobby begged for her not to leave.\n\n\nIn the Llanview Hospital, Dr. Wright told Nurse Sharon to put a note in Jessica's file about the Rh disease, and Brody claimed that she did not need to do that.  Brody explained that he was Jessica's fianc\u00e9 and asked why Jessica would need treatment.  The nurse laughed and said that the doctor had confused Jessica with Natalie, as she had done earlier.\n\n\nBrody claimed that he had told Jessica that they were Rh compatible, and Dr. Wright indicated that she would make a note of that in Jessica's file.  Brody asked to know the chances that the baby could contract Jessica's hepatitis C, and Dr. Wright stated that the chances were excellent.  Brody insisted that he was going to be with Jessica for all of her doctor's appointments.  Just as Brody claimed that it was important for him to be a good father, Natalie walked into the hospital lobby.\n\n\nAs Natalie scheduled her sonogram, the nurse laughed at how she had thought that Natalie was having a baby with Officer Lovett.  Natalie explained to Brody that she had just talked to John on the phone and stressed that John was her baby's father, no matter what.  Brody told Natalie that he would let it go -- for the moment.\n\n\nIn the lobby at Todd's mansion, Kelly arrived and hugged Jessica.  Kelly asked Jessica about Todd and Dani.  Jessica informed Kelly that things had been tough for Dani, and that Todd was with Starr.  When Kelly asked about Jessica and the baby, Jessica exclaimed, \"Fine, we're fine...except I'm no closer to knowing whether the father's the love of my life, or the biggest mistake I'll ever make.\"\n\n\nKelly worried about \"the Rh thing,\" and Jessica explained that Ford was not compatible, so that she would need to get the necessary shot.  Jessica believed that Brody would know that Jessica had been lying to him, if she got the shot, and asked Kelly how she could explain that to Brody.  Kelly voiced that Jessica should get the shot when Brody was not around.  When Jessica asked, Kelly announced that Rex had saved the day when Kelly had broken into Eli's apartment.  \"I know he was amazing...especially when he took his clothes off.\"\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Rex asked Gigi if she got the classes that she had wanted.  Gigi informed Rex that she had, but she was worried how she would pay for them.  Rex showed a check that he had received from Kelly and said, \"Your problem's solved.\"\n\n\nGigi questioned why the check was more than what Rex had requested, and Rex informed her that the case had been bigger than he had imagined.  Gigi speculated, \"Maybe Kelly's just tipping you for all those times she saw you naked.\"  Rex insisted that the higher pay was because he was a good private investigator.  However, Rex revealed that Kelly had walked in on him, just as he was preparing to take a shower, and Gigi speculated that maybe Kelly had planned it that way.  Rex expressed his surprise that Gigi was actually jealous.\n\n\nGigi commented that Kelly was both rich and gorgeous.  Gigi also insisted that she, herself, might get some attention from the frat boys, like Bobby Ford, at the college, because they were her type.  When Rex questioned how Ford was her type, Gigi reminded Rex that he was a bad boy, and that Rex had been a bad boy too.  Gigi realized that she had already missed her chance with Ford, since she was a hot coed, and Bobby would not be allowed near her, due to his job.  Rex believed that would not stop Bobby Ford.\n\n\nIn Tahiti, John called Natalie, who was at the Llanview Hospital, as Blair sadly sat and stared into space.  After Natalie asked, John told her that Blair was \"not okay.\"  John insisted that he wanted to be with Natalie for her first sonogram and asked her to back up the date of her appointment.  Natalie claimed that she would \"take care of it.\"  Natalie held her stomach, as she sat down.\n\n\nAfter John told Blair that Ross was in lockup, Blair revealed that Eli had tried to blame Ross for everything, and she wondered how she could fallen in love with a man who had killed someone as nice as her Aunt Melinda.  John reminded Blair that she had a lot of people who loved her, as he comforted her in his arms.\n\n\nIn the living room at Todd's mansion, Starr wanted Todd to help Blair, but Todd refused.  Todd reminded Starr that Blair had promised to \"be there\" for Dani.  \"And just when Dani needs her support the most, what does she do?  She runs off with Eli Clarke.\"  Starr then announced that Eli Clarke was a killer.\n\n\nTodd insisted that if Blair could survive Todd, that she could survive anything.  When John called Starr, and after Starr asked, John claimed that Blair was not hurt, but that she had been shaken up.  John then put Blair on the phone.  On the phone, Starr claimed that she had been scared for Blair, and Blair cried that she had been scared too.  Starr stated that she had been shocked that Blair had married Eli, and Blair told Starr the story of how she had shot Eli.  Blair insisted that if the shot had not killed Eli, the fire had.\n\n\nBlair asked about Dani, and Starr told Blair not to worry about anything, and to just get home as soon as she could.  Starr reminded her mother that she loved her, and Blair stressed that she loved Starr too.\n\n\nOnce Todd entered the lobby, Kelly expressed her regrets and sorrow over T\u00e9a's death.  Starr walked into the lobby and announced that Eli was dead.  Kelly expressed her regrets to Starr on Blair's behalf.  When Kelly asked if there were anything she could do, Todd said, \"Why don't you go write tomorrow's headline and go with 'the scum is dead.'\"  As Kelly left, she told Jessica that she was worried about Jessica and the baby.\n\n\nStill at Rodi's, Rex maintained that he would want a date with Gigi every night, even if only to flip the pages of her textbook.  As Rex and Gigi kissed, Natalie arrived and announced that Eli was dead.  Rex wanted to know if Kelly knew about Eli's death, and Gigi declared that Rex could ask Kelly himself, since Kelly had just walked through Rodi's door.\n\n\nAfter Rex left to talk to Kelly, Gigi asked about Natalie, and Natalie revealed that she had just scheduled her first sonogram at the hospital.  Natalie feared that John, as a detective, would be able to figure out that the baby might not be his from the sonogram.  However, Gigi believed that there would be no way for John to figure it out from the sonogram and stressed that Natalie needed to \"ease up,\" so that John would not suspect that something was wrong.\n\n\nKelly told Rex that she wished that she could have faced Eli as her mother's murderer.  Kelly believed that after all of the hard work that she and Rex had done, Eli had taken the easy way out.  \"My mom had to die all alone for no good reason at all.\"  Rex hugged Kelly, as Gigi and Natalie watched.\n\n\nBrody arrived at Todd's mansion and greeted Jessica with a kiss.  When Brody asked how Todd and Dani were coping, Jessica declared, \"Not good.\"  Brody then questioned why Jessica would still need the Rh treatment, since he had already told her that they were compatible.  Brody added that Dr. Wright had not given him an answer and had been very vague.  Jessica falsely stated that Dr. Wright was just being careful.  Brody insisted that he and Jessica would straighten that out with Dr. Wright when they saw her at Jessica's sonogram.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Nurse Sharon asked Dr. Wright if Jessica truly needed the shot, and Dr. Wright answered that Jessica did.\n\n\nAt Todd's mansion, Starr realized that Blair could have died, and Todd blamed himself.  He explained that he had never liked Eli but had never told Blair.  In fact, Todd had actually told Blair \"to go for it.\"  Todd claimed that he had not wanted to appear \"controlling, jealous, stingy,\" and that Blair could have died because of him.\n\n\nTodd revealed that he had not seen that Eli was a psycho, even though T\u00e9a had tried to warn him.  Starr then announced that she knew how to say goodbye to T\u00e9a and told Todd that they should have a special ceremony for T\u00e9a.  Starr exclaimed that they could have photos of T\u00e9a's life and tell all of the great T\u00e9a stories, but Todd did not want to do that.  Starr still insisted on having the memorial for Dani, so that Dani would have a time and a place to say goodbye to T\u00e9a.  Todd kissed Starr and told her to have the memorial.  Starr left to prepare, and Todd sat on the living room floor and looked at a wedding picture of Todd and T\u00e9a toasting each other with champagne.\n\n\nJohn informed Blair that the authorities had found Eli's body.  When Blair asked if Eli was dead, John exclaimed, \"We'll see.\"  After Blair asked what John had meant, John declared, \"It means 'I'll believe it when I see it.'\"  Blair announced that Eli had pushed Marty down the stairs, and John indicated that he had already known that.  As the EMS attendants rolled in the body, John stressed that Eli could not hurt Blair anymore.  Still, Blair insisted that she wanted to see the body.  \"I want to see if he is really gone.\"\n\n\nWhen Blair saw the body, she gave a small cry and buried her face in John's chest.  Blair revealed that the man's face had been badly burned, and that he could have been anybody.  The EMS attendant gave Blair a plastic bag that contained a singed wedding picture of Eli and Blair that he had found on the body.  Blair pleaded with herself, \"Why didn't I see it?\"\n\n\nBlair cried to John that Eli had won her over with a lie, when he had claimed that Blair was the first woman that he had ever wanted to marry.  John maintained that Eli could never hurt Blair again, and Blair pointed out that she thought that she was marrying someone who was unlike Todd, yet Eli had been worse than Todd ever had been.  Blair observed that Kelly and Jack had tried to warn her, and she regretted that she had not listened to John when he had also tried to warn her.  John said that Blair had nothing to be sorry about, however, Blair disagreed.  \"There are a lot of things to be sorry about.  I fell in love with a man, who killed your baby.  How could I have been so blind?\"  John and Blair hugged.\n\n\nJohn insisted to the officials that he wanted a complete transcript of Ross's interrogation and demanded proof that the body belonged to Eli Clarke.  When John walked back to Blair, she took her wedding ring off, as she looked at the supposedly blissful wedding picture.\n\n\nBlair threw the picture into the trash, and John walked her out of the room.  John said, \"I'll buy you a drink.\"  Blair responded, \"Okay,\" as the picture laid in the trash can. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair is distraught after Eli has been burned in the fire and for not seeing him for who he really is. She goes to the Tahiti police station with John and gets ready to return to her family. Back in Llanview, Todd and Dani are feeling the same way over the loss of Tea. Starr is also mourning her since they were close but encourages her father to celebrate Tea's life. She also realizes that Todd had no clue that Blair has married a killer. When he finds out that Eli pushed Marty and got both Hannah and himself wrongfully accused, he is angry. He feels guilty for encouraging Blair to marry him for and for not finding Tea until it was too late. Brody finds out that Jessica asked Dr. Vivian to do an Rh test which she does not need if he's the father of her baby. Natalie is similarly concerned that it's possible that Brody is the father of her baby. Meanwhile, Robert Ford tries and fails to win Langston over and apologizes for how he has treated her. She sounds like she will never trust or believe a word he says.",
