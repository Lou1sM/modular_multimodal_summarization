    "soap_central": "\nA Pain In The Glass\n\n\nAt an airport, presumably in Texas, several Llanview residents gathered for their respective flights. Gigi and Rex couldn't wait to get back to their home, though Gigi was still wondering exactly how she would tell Shane that Rex was his real dad. Jared was waiting for a connecting flight to South America, so that he could do some work for Clint. Waiting for the next portion of their flight on their long way home from Mendorra, were Antonio, Talia, Sarah, and Cris. \"Sex Scandal Rocks Mendorra\" was the headline in the New York newspaper that Cris picked up and showed his companions. Chuckling at the picture of Carlo and Jonas in bed together, the Mendorran group wondered what had become of the men. \n\n\nIn Llanview, the local newspaper's headline, \"The King is a Queen?\" gave Nora some laughs, but her smiles disappeared abruptly when Natalie arrived to tell off her father. She filled Nora in on Jared's whereabouts and how he was doing some dirty work for Clint by going after a teenager. Clint quickly came to his own defense, citing his desire to merely return the family company into the hands of the Buchanans. Natalie felt that she could empathize deeply with Langston's finding a new family to be with and her fear of losing them, and made it clear that she was not happy with Clint's methods. She called her dad a hypocrite and accused him of being worse than Jared, who never intended to hurt anyone in his scheme to be a Buchanan. \n\n\nAn angry Clint felt there was no comparison and felt sure that Langston would remain with Dorian. He emphasized that he only wanted his company back. A concerned Natalie wondered what would happen if things didn't go according to plan. Clint insisted he wasn't troubled by any of his moves at all. Natalie wondered why he had kept Nora in the dark if that were truly the case. She wondered who was doing all of this, as it certainly wasn't her father. She stormed out. \n\n\nMichael and John met up at Capricorn, with John mentioning that he was waiting for something at the station and had some time to kill. Watching his brother's interaction with Blair, Michael realized that they were more than friends. He was happy for John and hoped that he wasn't still working on the identity of the mystery woman. John admitted that he was, and Michael only hoped that she didn't come between John and Blair. \n\n\nAs Todd and Marty started to have their long-anticipated chat, Todd received a call from Tess, demanding that he show up at Llanfair. She threatened to talk to John about Marty if he didn't. Claiming to have a problem at the newspaper, Todd told Marty they'd talk again. After Todd left, Marty decided to freshen up, asking Janet to apply some makeup and to help her into the gown that Todd had purchased for her. \n\n\nAs Tina banged and pleaded to be let out of the secret room, Tess advised her that she, Tess, was nothing like Jessica, and Jessica was dead. She turned off the sound to the room and further advised Tina that no one would know she was there. \n\n\nAs Rex and Gigi shared a kiss, the crew from Mendorra looked on in astonishment. Approached by Antonio and Cris, Rex asked Gigi to call Shane. The perturbed Vega brothers demanded to know what was going on, reminding Rex that he was married. Rex advised them that it was over, though Cris pointed out that he was sure Adriana didn't know about it. Rex stopped Cris from placing a call to her and asked that he be allowed to tell her the news himself. A seemingly more understanding Antonio ordered him to take care of it quickly without causing any embarrassment to his sister. Rex understood that they were only being protective. \n\n\nAs John and Blair flirted with each other, Michael pulled up a seat next to Layla, informing her of his separation from Marcie. He confided that he was sure Todd would break Marcie's heart again. Layla was shocked, noting that everyone wanted a perfect relationship like the McBains. John heard about Todd showing up at Starr's childbirth class and he and Blair wondered what Todd's agenda was. They agreed they didn't believe his apologies. \n\n\nTodd arrived at Llanfair where Tess told him that Tina was a problem. Tess informed him that Tina knew she was really Tess, not Jessica. Todd insisted that he would not take Tina in, no matter what Tess threatened to do to him. Todd wondered if Tess had killed her. Tess asked for help, insisting that she didn't want to kill her aunt. Todd's best suggestion was to find something to use as leverage against Tina. When Tess pooh-poohed that idea, Todd pointed out how remarkably it had worked for him. He reminded her that he could hurt her as much as she could hurt him. \n\n\nSarah spotted Jared, who informed her that he was doing a job for Clint. He remained close-mouthed, merely stating that he was all about getting the family company back. She thought that maybe she would even like him again if he did that. \n\n\nAs Layla was drinking tequila shots to drown her sorrow over Vincent, Michael joined her, even though they agreed they didn't feel better. Layla persuaded Michael to dance with her. Blair sang and dedicated her song to John. She promised him an encore later. \n\n\nClint reminded Nora that Dorian was the bad guy and he was just using Langston for leverage. Nora was more upset that she had not been confided in on more than occasion. He asked if she would have approved, and suggested that they would have just argued about everything. As Nora contemplated what her next move should be, Clint pointed out the confidentiality rule. A distressed Nora reminded him that she was not his lawyer, but a friend. She actually thought they were headed to being partners. She thought it best that one of them leave, and remembered that the house was hers. Clint snarled that he had no problem with being the one to move out. Later, Clint stopped for a drink at Capricorn and ran into his old girlfriend, Dallas. \n\n\nAt the airport, Cris learned that the group's departing flight only had three seats left. He offered to be the one to remain behind. \n\n\nThinking about what she could use for leverage against Tina, Tess recalled Tina's reaction when she had been caught at the safe. What a surprise Tess found when she managed to get the safe open. Spilling the jewels into her hand, Tess was gleeful. Then Natalie arrived home. \"What are you doing in the safe?\" she asked her sister. Down in the basement, Tina vowed to beat Tess at her own game. \n\n\nArriving home to a strikingly different looking Marty, Todd remarked on her appearance. She advised him that she thought she might feel better if she looked better. She also gave him an answer to his proposal. She agreed to help him raise his grandchild, citing her excitement at the prospect of a baby being around the house. \n\n\nWorking at the police station on John's mystery woman image, Fish called the detective and advised him he wouldn't have anything for him before the morning. John told Blair he had the rest of the evening free. \n\n\nAs Cris bade Sarah farewell, an airport employee approached him. Due to a cancellation on another flight, they had room for him a bit earlier than originally thought. As Cris accompanied the gentleman, he was accosted and dragged away. \n\n\nThe online image of the mystery woman became more clear.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex and Gigi are ready to head back to Llanview. Cristian and Antonio notice them and tell Rex he better not be doing anything behind Adriana's back. Cristian later runs into a guy who tricks him and has him knocked out and kidnapped. Tess knows she better do something now that Tina might be onto her. So she locks her in the room in the basement and asks Todd if he any any suggestions. Both she and Todd know that neither better \"sell\" the other out since neither she nor Todd want to be found out. John is having his uniform cop attempting to find out whom the woman is that Todd is hiding. Marty tells Todd that she will help him raise Starr's child regardless of how impractical it may be. Tess brainstorms as to how she can \"get the goods\" on Tina. And she remembers that Tina hid something in the safe. So she goes and uncovers the jewels. Natalie enters and discovers \"Jessica\" reaching in the safe. Nora and Clint admit that they might be breaking up now that she's found out about his secret scheme involving Langston that he did not trust her to know about and assumed she would be against.",
