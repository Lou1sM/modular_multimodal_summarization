Todd says \"Dirty Harry\" has dreamed up a phony arrest to keep him away from his son and Todd promises to make trouble. Blair says John must be desperate. John says Miles wants to press charges for the assault and he's taking Todd in. Todd refuses to go, saying John has nothing, and it's just to keep Todd from going to the McBains' and yanking the kid out of there. John says that would be the worst thing to do. Todd says he has no proof, so John asks Blair to help him by giving a statement about the assault. Todd says no one cares what he did to Miles. John defends Michael and Marcie and says they took good care of Tommy, and that they didn't know Todd was the father, and that Marcie can't have children of her own.

Todd is still defiant and, looking right at Todd, Blair makes a statement about the assault that allows John to arrest Todd. Todd is put in jail and says John should have done the right thing. Todd wants to be Tommy's father; he's risked everything for the kid. Even John is sympathetic, and defends Michael and Marcie again. He says, with Spencer involved, it could have been much worse. John is only asking for one night. Todd thinks he will take Tommy and run. John leaves. Todd remembers showing Marcie his son's death certificate. Blair shows up on the other side of the jail cell.
