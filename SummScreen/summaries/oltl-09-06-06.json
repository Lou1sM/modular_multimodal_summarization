He's sure that Todd has his sights on Evangeline and he'd prefer that she not see him any longer, he implores her. Todd is using her friendship and loyalty in order to make Blair jealous and it looks to him like their own relationship no longer stands a chance; perhaps they are too different. Evangeline is insistent that she and Todd are only friends and is hurt that Cris doesn't trust her. She believes that she and Cris are from the same mold, both fighters and is sure that Todd won't get to her because she loves Cris and won't allow it. It's Todd that he doesn't trust, Cris responds. She agrees to end her friendship with Todd if he appears to want more than she's offering.\n\n\nBlair visits Starr to tell her some news but Todd shows up behind her. It's not what you think, she tells him. Starr is going home tomorrow. He proceeds to divulge that Starr really has no memory lapse and has been scamming everyone all along. Blair has done the same, he tells his daughter, who is amazed to learn that Blair doesn't love Spencer. Blair is upset that she didn't know about Starr's memory even though she finds out that it's because Starr wanted things the way they were before. Blair and Todd argue about her not knowing and it goes into whether they really love each other. Todd indicates that they merely have great sex and thinks it best that they end it all. She reminds him that she expressed her true feelings earlier and doesn't think that she betrayed him. She just lost faith. Todd doesn't know if he can make up since Blair was totally with Spencer until Margaret showed up. \n\n\nJess and Antonio agree to celebrate. She assures him that she will never leave again. They make a stop at Capricorn first so that Antonio can take care of something. Nash is there, pouring out his woes to Claudia, assuming that the happy couple will not show up. He expects to be pushed out of his baby's life and has lost everything. He does know that he and Jessica share no feelings whatsoever for each other. Spotting Jess and Antonio, he staggers away. Claudia makes a wise remark to Jessica about Humpty Dumpty being fixed up. When Jess heads over to speak with Nash, Antonio threatens to fire Claudia, accusing her of being jealous and orders her to stay away from Jess. He's decided to propose marriage again. She apologizes but was really unsure of what to say. Jess promises that the baby is ok but is taken aback when Nash declines her invitation to visit. He thinks he should exit his daughter's life, just stay away so that his daughter won't be confused. The baby will be clear on everything, swears Jess. And don't forget, Tess will always be her mother.\n\n\nRex and Dorian race to meet Bruce as Adriana pleads with the kidnapper to lose the gun. He makes a play for her, insisting that if she won't come along with him, he'll have to get what he wants before he leaves. Adriana manages to break her ties and clunk Bruce over the head but he recaptures her as Dorian appears, followed by Rex (Dorian tells Bruce that Rex must have followed her). Guns are pointed but Bruce gets Rex to drop his as Adriana runs into his arms; Dorian aims a gun. There's talk of Dorian calling for the money but Rex suddenly kicks the gun out of Dorian's hand and jumps Bruce. They fall to the ground, wrestling and a shot rings out.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nash goes for a drink and tells Claudia about Jessica. Jessica tells Nash that he can be in Bree's life. He doesn't want to confuse Bree though. Todd outs Starr when she tries to use her 'illness' to put her parents together. Blair is angry but then gets over it when she realizes Starr's goal. Todd can't take Blair back. Adriana sits on a picnic bench with her hands tied behind her back. Bruce waits for Dorian to arrive to the scene. Adriana is worried when she sees him getting his gun ready. She asks him to take out the bullets and pretend that it is loaded but he ignores her pleas. He looks at Adriana now with new eyes. He tells her how he will have ten million dollars and would like it if she were with him. She wouldn't ever go willingly with this clown anywhere. He breathes in her face then and relates that he would even settle for a one-time go at her. She would rather be dead first! He will take that under advisement. Headlights appear and when Bruce looks at them, Adriana kicks him and he falls to the ground. She tries to run but Bruce tackles her. He is angry now and holds his gun on Adriana in anger. \"Get that gun away from her!\" Dorian has arrived and offers to call to make the transfer now. Bruce is so mad, he threatens to shoot Adriana anyway. Rex appears now with his gun aimed at Bruce. Bruce puts Adriana in front of him and orders Rex to drop his gun. Rex has no choice and does as he is told. Bruce pushes Adriana to Rex, but something is wrong. Dorian has her back to everyone. \"Turn around!\" Bruce orders with his gun trained on Dorian. She turns but has a gun in her hand when she does, and in one move, has it pointed at the dirt bag's head. They are at a standoff. They get closer, each determined to win the game of chicken! Adriana kicks and Dorian's gun drops instead of Bruce's. Rex jumps on Bruce and they struggle on the ground, each with their hands on the one gun between them. BANG!",
