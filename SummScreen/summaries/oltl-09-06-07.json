She thinks he's teasing and doesn't quite understand since they haven't discussed it in a very long time. When he says he's thought about it for a while, she's willing to consider it but is afraid she'll get on his nerves and then they'll break up. He'll be upset when she moves in and cramps his style, she tells him. He compares the whole thing to the excitement that one gets when jumping out of an airplane. She finally agrees but makes him promise to let her know the very second she's getting on his nerves.\n\n\nVincent and Layla have planned a nice cozy evening at home but are unable to get Sean to leave. He's sensitive and alone and they feel bad so they let him stay. After a movie and popcorn and the three of them on the sofa together, it's time. As he sadly heads out, the couple is feeling guilty and they ask him to stay. The three fall asleep on the sofa.\n\n\nRoxy stops by to see Marcie and fill her in on her latest plan to help Lindsay. She's had Free Lindsay T-shirts made and thinks they should have a rally. When they get arrested and have lots of publicity, Lindsay will be set free when an impartial jury can't be found. Marcie doesn't really care for the idea and thinks that Lindsay is just not herself, not pushing to get free and there must be something else they can do. Roxy will just sleep on it. \n\n\nMiles is worried that he did the wrong thing and should have kept his mouth shut, if only for the baby's sake. As he doubts himself, Natalie tires to console him though she's shocked when she hears that it's Tommy who is Todd's son. When she thinks back to John's latest actions, she realizes that he probably knew. She's concerned that the news will now be out pretty quickly, but she still thinks that Miles did the right thing. They both feel a need to help though and she puts in a phone call to John, which goes unanswered.\n\n\nMichael is summoned to John's office where he discovers that Todd knows about his son. He's furious with his brother who promised not to say anything. John explains that Todd was told by Blair, who in turn got the news from Miles via Spencer. Right now Todd is locked up on an assault charge that won't stick but they have a little time to get to Marcie first and tell her. No, he doesn't know the motives behind Miles' disclosure of the news, John responds to Michael's question. He tries to get Mike to see that it's over, that he can no longer run interference for him. Michael breaks down and John offers to be the one to tell Marcie, but Michael declines at first. He's her husband and he has to be there to take care of her, he explains. John doesn't think that Mike should let Marcie know that he already knew about this for the sake of their marriage; Mike feels he should come clean. Let Marcie hate him if someone has to take the blame, John offers. Mike is persuaded to head home and spend some time with Marcie; John will come by in a bit. He appreciates John putting his reputation on the line and thanks him profusely. The teary detective gruffly gives orders to never thank him again. Downstairs, a very loud and obnoxious Todd creates a scene, demanding his son, a lawyer, a phone. He realizes that Lindsay is in the cell opposite and he complains about the dirty cop McBain who is keeping him from his son. Lindsay accuses him of fishing and of being insane. Tommy is his son and Marcie and Michael will pay through the nose, Todd vows. Doing her best to convince him that his story is pretty unlikely, Lindsay points out that he's gotten his information from an \"insane, dead murderer.\" John confirmed that he's right, Todd responds, and that's why he's in jail, so that John can be the one to break the news. Tommy is where he belongs, Lindsay retorts, with his mother and father who he loves and has bonded with. Maybe a shared custody would work, she suggests. When Todd gloats that the McBains will have to start over, Lindsay states that she will lay her life down before he takes Tommy from them. Todd refuses to be stopped. He won't be kept away, he growls. Lindsay threatens to ruin Jack's life by disclosing what Todd did when the boy was born, pretending he was dead and giving him away.  He made those moves on purpose and DNA doesn't make a dad, she continues. Todd accuses her of playing dirty but he can too. He asks about Will in Los Angeles and suggests she worry about her own child. He will have her son hurt if she messes with his, he threatens back. Which family does she value more? A frantic Lindsay cracks when she hears that her own son could be in possible danger. She'll do anything to protect him, she pleads. Suddenly, Marcie and Tommy arrive to say goodnight to Lindsay!\n\n\nMichael gets home and Marcie isn't there. When John arrives they wonder where she can be. \n\n\n",

Roxy visits Marcie and Tommy and tells Marcie that what she has in this box will get Lindsay off the hook. Marcie looks at her and is puzzled. Michael comes in to John's office and begs John not to tell Todd that Tommy is his. John lets him know that it is too late, that Todd already knows. Todd bangs on the bars of his cell as the officer brings Lindsay back to her cell. Todd asks the officer to give him his phone call. Lindsay wants to know what Todd did now. Todd lets her know that he is going to sue John for keeping him from his son. Sean decides to spend the evening with Layla and Vincent.
