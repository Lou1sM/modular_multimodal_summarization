She thought it was nice of him to stop by, but he confessed that there was another reason he had visited. They sat down, and Jessica waited for Cristian to begin speaking. However, Cristian admitted that he felt awkward talking about the other reason for his presence at Llanfair. Jessica insisted that she needed to talk about something that wasn't sad.\n\n\nRelenting, Cristian explained to Jessica about Rama's love life advice for him. He started that Rama had talked about how sometimes the wrong people ended up together. Jessica interrupted Cristian, and said that she and Ford weren't seeing each other anymore. She explained to a confused Cristian that she'd thought that Ford had sent Cristian to pick Ryder up as a favor. He told her that he and Ford were no longer friends, and that he was actually there to talk about \"you and me.\"\n\n\nCristian continued that Rama's mission was to help Cristian find happiness. Jessica's name had been mentioned in their conversation. Rama had believed that Cristian should reconnect with his first love, and see if something was still between them. He related that it was the first time in years that they were both single, so there was nothing to lose. Jessica embarrassingly mentioned how she had strained things between Cristian and Layla when Jessica had thought that she was a teenager. Cristian reminded her that she no longer thought she was a teenager, and he was no longer with Layla. \"Are you saying you want us to try again?\" Jessica questioned.\n\n\nCristian knew that it was that last thing Jessica had been expecting, because they'd been friends for so long. He also knew he'd regret it if he didn't talk to her. She was happy that he could be honest with her. He suggested that too much time had passed, but she reminded him that things had worked out between Kelly and Joey in the same kind of situation. Jessica continued that it might not work out the same for her and Cristian, but Cristian thought it was worth finding out. She wondered how, and he said that there was only one way, \"if it's all right with you.\" She nodded, and he kissed her.\n\n\nAubrey told Rama that she'd thought about taking her old name, but she'd decided not to. Rama replied that she liked the name Kristine. Aubrey continued that she and Cutter were going to try to be a real couple, with no more conning. Rama was reminded of \"the real Aubrey, and what she did.\" The real Aubrey had wanted to reinvent herself with a new name. Aubrey remembered that Rama and the real Aubrey had been roommates at boarding school, and asked about the woman.\n\n\nRama started that she and Aubrey had been \"thrown together\" as roommates, because they'd both been to the school on scholarship. They'd also initially gotten along because Rama had been \"the token minority,\" and Aubrey had been \"an ugly duckling.\" Aubrey thought back to the picture of the real Aubrey in the boarding school's yearbook. Rama continued that Aubrey had wanted to get plastic surgery to make her beautiful. The girls had been best friends until Aubrey had disappeared with all of Rama's hard-earned money. She'd vowed to find Aubrey, and eventually did at a place in Kentucky called the Spotted Pony.\n\n\nAubrey was stunned, and Rama wondered if she knew the place. Aubrey clarified that Rex had been talking about the place, and Cutter had recognized the name. However, Cutter had gotten \"weird,\" and refused to talk about it. Aubrey wondered what Rama had found at the Spotted Pony, but Rama didn't want to talk about it. Clearly lying, she said that it had been a dead end, because Cutter and Aubrey had already left. When Rama had found Cutter in Llanview, he'd claimed not to know where Aubrey was.\n\n\nAfter hearing Rama's story, Aubrey was glad to be done with \"that life.\" Rama reminded her friend that changing her name wouldn't change who she was on the inside. Aubrey hoped to get in touch with \"the old me.\" Rama assured Aubrey that Rama had lost herself, but had gotten back to where she belonged. Rama wondered if the real Aubrey had ever used Rama's money to get the plastic surgery that she'd wanted.\n\n\nCutter couldn't believe that his sister was there. She reminded him to call her Kim, but he assured her that she'd always be Aubrey to him. She wondered what he was doing in Llanview, and related that she'd heard he was after the Buchanans. He replied that he'd gotten everything from them, but he'd eventually gotten kicked out. He thought that he and his sister had a lot of catching up to do. She agreed that a lot had changed \"since the Spotted Pony.\"\n\n\nKim admitted that she'd gone back to the Spotted Pony, and Cutter demanded to know why. Kim assured him that \"no one remembered anything,\" but he wasn't convinced. Cutter told Kim about Rex asking about the Spotted Pony, and she revealed that Rex had shown up at the club. \"You didn't tell him, did you?\" Cutter yelled. Kim reassured Cutter that she didn't want to go to jail any more than he did. He said that no one could ever know about what they'd done.\n\n\nCutter opened the door, and told Kim to go back to the Spotted Pony before Rama saw her. Kim knew that Rama wouldn't recognize her after the plastic surgery. Cutter reminded Kim that she'd stolen the money for the surgery from Rama, who would want the money back once she figured out who Kim was. Kim vowed to pay Rama back in full once she remarried Clint. Cutter admitted that he'd heard about Kim's marriage to Clint in the paper, which was how he and Aubrey had started their plan to con Clint's son.\n\n\nA short while later, Kim had Cutter in a headlock, and yelled at him for scamming Clint. She released Cutter, and warned him to stay away from Clint \"from now on.\" He reminded her that Clint was broke, but she thought that the Buchanan name still carried weight. Cutter wondered what her plan was, but she didn't want to tell him. He wondered who she was working with. She replied that she was working alone, but she did say that it wasn't only her happiness at stake. After much convincing, Kim decided that it would be nice to have someone to talk to. She handed Cutter a picture of her and Stacy.\n\n\nBlair, Starr, and Jack entered La Boulaie. Blair told Jack to get some rest, but he was too angry about Todd walking around free after Todd had killed Victor. Blair reminded him that the investigation was still going on, and Starr reminded him that Todd was their father whether Jack liked it or not. Starr told Jack not to accuse Todd of murder just because Jack wanted it to be true. Jack thought that Blair believed that Todd had shot Victor. Starr wondered if that was true, because Blair kept avoiding the question.\n\n\nInstead of answering, Blair promised that the police would find the murderer, and punish the person accordingly. Blair wanted her family to stop fighting, and start helping each other through the tragedy. Starr didn't know what to tell Hope, and Blair didn't know how to tell Sam. Starr believed that it would be the hardest on Sam, because Victor was his real father. Jack yelled that Victor was his father as well. Starr told him that their real father had fought his way back to them.\n\n\nStarr knew that it wasn't Jack's fault that he didn't know Todd the way she did. She admitted that something had been missing when Todd had been gone, but it meant a lot to her that he'd returned. Jack related that the father he'd loved, that had loved him, was gone, and it was Todd's fault. Blair told her kids that they'd have answers soon, and Starr left. Blair wanted to get Jack a pain pill, but he insisted that he was fine. Blair wondered what she could do for him. He told her to go back in time, and save Victor from Todd. In shock, she left to get Jack a pill.\n\n\nWhen Blair returned, Jack stood in front of the open back door. She wondered where he was going. He didn't want to wait to hear news -- he wanted to find it out for himself. Blair told him to rest, but Jack yelled that he was \"doing it for Dad, because no one else will.\" Sam entered, and wondered why everyone was yelling about his father. Blair told him to go back to his room, because they needed to talk. Jack yelled that Sam needed to know the truth. As Sam started to walk up the stairs, Jack grabbed him and yelled, \"Dad is dead, and your friend Scarface killed him!\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Dani entered their house. T\u00e9a spotted the bloodstain in the living room, and tried to stop Dani from going into the room. Dani saw the stain anyway, and the two embraced sadly. Dani wondered why the police had left the stain, but T\u00e9a suggested that they go back to the Palace. Dani refused the suggestion, because she wanted to be at the house \"with his things.\" She lamented her choice to go out the night before, but T\u00e9a was glad that Dani hadn't gotten caught in the crossfire.\n\n\nDani wondered if Victor had said anything when T\u00e9a had found him. T\u00e9a admitted that she'd asked Victor who had shot him, and she swore that he'd tried to say something starting with the letter \"T.\" Dani wondered if Victor had been trying to say \"Todd,\" but T\u00e9a reasoned that it also could have just been a random sound. She remembered saying all she could to get Victor to hold on, but she'd ended up telling him that she loved him over and over. Dani smiled and thought that Victor had been trying to say \"T\u00e9a.\"\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a was smelling a jacket of Victor's when Dani entered with tea for T\u00e9a. Starr entered the house, and hugged her sister and stepmother. T\u00e9a wanted to go to the station to check on the investigation. She hadn't wanted to leave Dani alone, but thought Dani would be fine with Starr there. T\u00e9a left, and both girls expressed their disbelief in what had happened.\n\n\nStarr assured Dani that she'd loved Victor, even when they'd found out that he wasn't Todd. She knew that the situation had been different for Dani and Jack, because Victor had been the only father they'd known. Starr continued that Jack thought she was a traitor, and said that she wasn't his sister anymore. She wanted to know if Dani still considered her a sister.\n\n\nDani started that she'd loved Victor even though she hadn't meant to. She'd spent so much time fighting, and hating Victor, but he'd never given up trying to be her father. \"One day, I loved him back, and you helped do that,\" Dani said. She thought that Starr had helped her see the good in Victor, and she was happy about it. Dani understood Starr's feelings, and Starr thanked her for understanding. Dani concluded that it didn't matter which man they were closer to -- Starr was still her sister, and always would be. \"Good, because I really need my sister right now,\" Starr said, and hugged Dani.\n\n\nJohn ushered Todd into an interrogation room, and told him that he'd done the right thing. John asked if Todd had killed his brother. \"He's not my brother,\" Todd replied. John wondered if Todd had stolen the gun, but Todd only admitted to borrowing it. John questioned whether or not Todd had intended to use the gun on Victor. \"Yes. No. Maybe,\" Todd replied. Todd clarified that he'd wanted his life back, and had known that Victor wouldn't give it back. He'd intended to take it back.\n\n\nJohn created the scenario of the murder. He imagined that Todd had knocked Jack out, taken Jack's keys to let himself into the house, and shot Victor. However, Todd said that it wasn't true. John tried again, this time including an argument, and a struggle over the gun. Todd denied the story again, so John asked for the truth.\n\n\nTodd admitted to thinking about killing Victor, but not to killing him. He'd thought of Blair's words about missing out on more time with his family. He'd also known that Jack would have hated him for killing Victor, and he hadn't wanted to do that to his son. John wondered where the gun was. Todd told him about bumping into Louie on the docks, and giving him the gun for the Guns for Cash program. He told John that the gun that had been registered under Dorian's name had never been fired. John left to check for it.\n\n\nA short while later, Todd was pacing around the room when John returned. John told Todd that there had been no gun turned in. Todd was angry because Louie had promised to turn it in to John. Todd wanted to talk to Louie, but John said he would. He told Todd to stay in the room and to ask the officer outside the door if he needed anything. John left.\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a arrived in front of the interrogation room, and asked if Todd was there. The officer replied that Todd wasn't allowed to have any visitors outside of a lawyer. T\u00e9a claimed to be Todd's lawyer, so the officer let her in.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cristian goes to see Jessica after Rama has encouraged him to see if he could re-kindle his romance with his first love. Aubrey talks to Rama about whether she and Cutter are really ready to go back to the way they were when they first fell in love, before they starting doing their scamming business and she was known as Christine. We then find out for the first time that Kimberly is Cutter's sister, the real Aubrey Wentworth. She didn't used to look like she does now. She had plastic surgery with money she stole from Rama. Rama admits to Aubrey that she is on the warpath to get revenge upon the real Aubrey for that. All the people who have known Victor Lord Jr. to be Todd for the last 8 years mourn his death. They all consider the possibility that original Todd killed him. Both Rex and Brody are suspects with motive and without alibis to prove they did not do it.",
