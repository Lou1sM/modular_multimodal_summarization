Paige popped over to watch Bo and John rifling through Spencer's things and cheered their efforts, telling Bo how to find a key to Spencer's box. Paige and Bo decided to meet up at Capricorn later (of course). Clint talked to Natalie about Dorian's unpredictability and how much he liked it. \"Whatever floats your boat,\" Natalie said. She urged him to spill \u2014 and he did, about failing his kids. John and Bo used an administrative key to unlock Spencer's secret. \"Well, well, well,\" John drawled as they spied the mysterious contents then and gave the box to the CSU guys. At Capricorn, Natalie buoyed up Clint's doubts about his parenting skills. \"You're not God, just a Buchanan,\" she chuckled, and, \"you're a great dad.\" She reminisced about being...um, a bit bitchy...when she first hit Llanview and thanked Clint for not failing her. (Aw!) John soon showed up to hang with Natalie and he smiled (yes, he smiled!), finally close to finding peace. The lab called with a break and they jetted. \n\n\nSpencer cooled his heels in jail and David dropped by to take \"cheap shots\" and a snazzy picture with his camera phone. \"You look overweight and anemic at the same time,\" he sniped. Spencer wasn't havin' it, though. \"I am an innocent man!\" he postured. The one-liners flew fast and furiously as David and Spencer discussed their mother not being around and Spencer's vendetta against the Buchanans. \"Drop it before they find out,\" David advised. \"Let it go.\" Spencer refused to share the root of his anger and then Paige showed up to gloat. David and Paige tag-teamed Spencer. Snark ensued. Paige lorded her secret over Spencer. \"Are you feeling angry, helpless, impotent?\" she taunted. \"You are on your own,\" Dave told Spencer before walking away. Later, at Capricorn, Paige celebrated sticking it to Spence. \"Cut him off cold turkey,\" she prescribed an worried David. Speaking of turkey, Spencer talked to himself, assuring David he'd be just fine. Paige kept up her happy dance with Bo but he wondered if she'd ever really be free of Spencer since they shared a son. \n\n\nMichael and Marcie, meanwhile, were told by Janice that they were about to lose Tommy. At the Arizona clinic, Kelly and Kevin awaited news about losing Kelly's baby. The doctor told them that the baby was doing well and they were discharging Kelly. Yay! But Kelly wasn't exactly ready to go home. Janice told Marcie and Michael that she's looking to permanently place Tommy with another family. Oh, no! Alone, Michael and Marcie reeled from the news. Kevin wondered why Kelly wasn't packing to come home. \"I have to do what's best for my child!\" she said, and she didn't want her baby to feel unwanted. Speaking of babies, Michael assured Marcie they would be able to keep Tommy if they told Janice they wanted to adopt the boy. Giddy Marcie hugged him and they told Janice their decision. They then happily cuddled Tommy. Not so cuddly were Kelly and Kevin. Kevin told Kelly he was working on his Duke issues but Kelly said she'd risked too much. \"I have to go on without you.\" \n\n\nRex and Bruce rassled at the rest stop and the gun went off. Bruce ended up with no pulse and Rex ended up in Adriana's arms. Cue passionate necking (and Dorian glaring). \"I'm fine,\" Rex mumbled as they cuddled. Adriana was getting her anti-Dorian tirade on when Rex gasped, \"You're bleeding!\" Silly rabbits, it's not Adriana bleeding...it's Rex. The less-than-savvy lad collapsed. A fading Rex did the deathbed whisper thing: \"I love you.\" Adriana called frantically for her mom. Dr. Cramer instructed Adriana in CPR and, together, they got Rex started up again. \"I never want to see you again,\" Adriana bitterly announced to Dorian once Rex was safe with the EMTs. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "BANG! The gun goes off. Adriana and Dorian watch as Rex pushes Bruce's dead body off him. Adriana rushes to Rex and they hug and kiss while Dorian watches quietly. Jo, Bo and their men arrive to execute a search for more evidence to hang Spencer. \"Bo, I think I found something.\" Meanwhile, David arrives at the jail to visit his brother. He gets out his picture phone and takes a pictures, being sure to get himself in it as well as his brother who sits behind bars, behind him. He knows that Dorian will find this picture to die for. Natalie is at the bar and she sees Clint looking at his phone and then putting it down. She knows that he is thinking about calling Dorian and she tells him to just do it. Dorian checks the man out and confirms that he is dead. She feels they should call the police now. Adriana tells that she would love to do that, so that she can tell them all that her mother has done. Rex doesn't care about that now. Adriana is bleeding. She can't understand it. She doesn't feel pain anywhere. Rex starts staggering. Adriana and Dorian can't understand what is wrong with him. Suddenly he falls hard to the ground. John and Bo get the strong box open, but John closes the lid again. A strange mist, or fog drifts out of it. Paige told them that the box is sometimes used for cold storage. They look in the box again and are not sure what it is that they are looking at. \"Maybe it is the thing that he used to make Margaret forget her life.\" Paige arrives at the jail to ask Spencer how it feels to be locked up and put aside. He starts to threaten but she isn't afraid of him anymore. Rex has been shot and Adriana and Dorian work hard to keep him alive while the paramedics make there way there. There is a point where it seems like Rex isn't breathing anymore. When Rex is strapped in, Adriana starts making her way to the ambulance but Dorian tells her that isn't a good idea. \"I don't care what you think, and I never want to see you again,\" Adriana says. Bo and John send the storage box to the lab. John gets the call that there is news and he and Natalie head out. Bo gets a call that Rex has been shot and he and Paige head out to meet him at the hospital. Spencer thinks about his brother's visit. They discussed the Buchanans and how Spencer hates them. He knows that unlike his brother and mother, he is strong. Michael and Marcie decide that they need to adopt Tommy and because of that, they are allowed to take him home with them right away.",
