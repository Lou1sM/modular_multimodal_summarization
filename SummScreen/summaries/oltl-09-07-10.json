    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Natalie knocked loudly on John's door, but he wasn't there.  Roxy wandered by, her arms laden with clean towels. She stopped to open the door with her master key and disclosed that she had just returned from a visit to Schuyler at Statesville. Roxy wondered how life might have turned out if Schuyler had known she was his real mother. She hadn't known he was her son, either, and she had lied to Rex about his father, but everything had turned out all right. She was excited that Natalie would be having her sonogram that day, and she babbled on about John and Natalie until Natalie yelled at Roxy to shut up.\n\n\nNatalie stated that everyone made mistakes, and Roxy agreed that the world would be a boring one if there weren't people making mistakes all of the time. Natalie smiled slightly, and Roxy was pleased to see that Natalie had cheered up some. Roxy asked about baby names and hoped that the baby would be named Roxanne if it turned out to be a girl. She felt somewhat responsible for the pregnancy because she was the one who had gotten Natalie and John back together. She was happy that Natalie hadn't done anything stupid that night. Natalie admitted that she had, but Roxy assumed it was something related to Natalie leaving Rodi's and almost getting on the plane the night the couple finally reconciled.\n\n\nJessica and Brody nervously waited for Dr. Wright so they could proceed to their sonogram appointment. Brody was filled with excitement, but the doctor finally appeared and asked to speak to Jessica alone. Brody was confused, but the doctor assured him that everything was okay. Alone with her patient, she wanted Jessica to be aware of the fact that Brody had asked questions about the Rh disease and had stated that he and Jessica were compatible, so there would be no need for any treatment. Dr. Wright had scheduled the procedure for the vaccine, and she promised that she wouldn't say anything about it in front of Brody. They should be concerned about the baby's health, she said, and she didn't want Jessica to be stressed about anything.\n\n\nThe sonogram proceeded, and Brody told the women how happy he was that the Rh factor wasn't an issue in Jessica's pregnancy. He bubbled over with happiness as they looked at the baby. \"Look what we created out of love,\" he exclaimed. Jessica was close to tears as Brody continued to chatter, and he thanked the doctor for everything. After the doctor left the room, Brody expressed his amazement at seeing his child for the first time. He thought that Jessica might not understand, since she had a large family. Jessica was all that he had. He stated that no one would ever be able to take his baby away from him.\n\n\nJessica cried out that she couldn't do it anymore. She loved Brody more than anything, and she knew he would probably hate her. \"This baby, there's a chance it might not be yours,\" she told him.\n\n\nRex and Gigi spread a blanket out on the ground at the quarry and looked forward to a day of relaxation. Rex had a surprise for Gigi, and he ran off to retrieve his special briefcase. He urged her to open it, and she found it filled with brand new school supplies. She was quite excited, but informed him that he was not to buy her a new computer. She would share their old one with Shane. It was all she would need along with Rex's support.\n\n\nGigi decided to spend the day filling out her grant application from school. It was called \"Live and Learn Grant,\" she explained to Rex. She had to write about all she had done since she had been in school and why it was important. She hadn't done anything important for society, she sighed. Rex corrected her. She had been a mother and raised a child alone for ten years. That was the most important thing she could have done, he said gently.\n\n\nOutside of the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Greg tried unsuccessfully to reach Eli. He wanted Eli to get in touch with him so they could talk about T\u00e9a's death. Destiny approached him and asked about the call. As they headed inside, he explained that he had been playing \"phone tag\" with another doctor. Destiny wandered over to visit with Layla and Cristian, who had been having a discussion about their new jobs. She expressed sorrow for their loss, since she knew that Cristian had been friendly with T\u00e9a. The couple was unaware of T\u00e9a's death, and they were saddened that they hadn't been able to say goodbye to her. Destiny quickly let them know that Greg had been the only party present during T\u00e9a's last moments.\n\n\nGreg awkwardly joined the group and admitted he was sorry that he hadn't been able to save T\u00e9a's life. Layla mentioned the latest news about Eli, and Greg was taken aback. He had worked with Eli in the courtroom, he stuttered. Claiming to have a surgery, he took off for the hospital before anyone could say anything.\n\n\nJack arrived at his father's house and gave Dani a hug. He was sorry about her mother's death, because he had truly adored T\u00e9a. He especially liked her more than Eli, he admitted. Quietly, Todd announced that Eli was not around any longer. Dani was stunned, though Todd was unable to provide many details. She noted that her father resided in Tahiti, but Todd quickly reminded her that he was her father. Eli was not who Dani thought he was, Todd stated.\n\n\nJack was quick to point out that he had nailed Eli as a psycho killer like the man in the movie he had seen. Todd noted that there were lots of people dead because of Eli. Dani could only shake her head in disbelief. She thought there had to be a misunderstanding, but Todd briefly told her about Eli's past, and his several identities, and missing wives. Todd was sympathetic as his daughter refused to accept the facts. She had trusted Eli, and he had turned out to be a murderer. She couldn't see why she should trust anyone, and she ran off. Jack asked Todd why he hadn't followed Dani, but Todd knew she needed her mother.\n\n\nJohn accompanied Blair home from Tahiti and made sure that she was safely inside at La Boulaie. She told Kelly she was a new bride, a widow, and a murderer all at once, but she was happy to be home. She only wanted to take a long shower, because she felt dirty after being with Eli. She thanked John for everything and walked slowly upstairs. Kelly asked John for details, and he obliged. He was still waiting for information on the cause for Eli's death, he explained. The man had been \"burned to a crisp,\" but Eli's personal effects had been recovered at the scene, along with the bullet in his shooting.\n\n\nKelly revealed that she was disappointed, since she had looked forward to telling Eli off in person. John thought that words were overrated, but Kelly supposed it would have made her feel better. Kelly's mom would have been proud of Kelly, John stated, and he wanted to thank Kelly too. They had nabbed Eli because of her. Kelly reminded him that she had made him mad during the investigation, but John assured her he was always mad. Kelly thought it was time she got back to her real life, since she had been sidetracked for so long.\n\n\nLater, Blair descended the stairs after her shower, and Kelly asked her for more facts. Blair urged her cousin to say \"I told you so,\" but Kelly swore she would never say such a thing. Blair thought otherwise, but she believed it was appropriate. Even Jack had warned his mother not to marry Eli. Kelly claimed that she'd merely had a few clues, and she had been lucky to learn the truth about Eli. Blair was grateful.\n\n\nKelly wondered if Eli had spoken about Melinda, and Blair admitted that she had been able to get Eli to confess to all of his crimes. Apparently, Melinda had shown a photo of Blair and Eli to Rodney, who had recognized Eli as Bennett Thompson. Melinda had called Blair to warn her, but had gotten Eli on the phone instead. Blair apologized for having Eli around their family, but Kelly assured her that she was a victim too. Blair asked that Kelly tell everyone that Blair was fine, but Blair needed to get to Dani. Kelly revealed that she had horrible news, too, and Blair guessed that it was about T\u00e9a. Kelly comforted her as Blair broke down in tears.\n\n\nBlair couldn't believe how times had changed, and she was crying on Kelly's shoulder. Kelly pointed out that it was also strange to find that Blair and T\u00e9a had been friends. Blair apologized again for not believing Kelly's warnings about Eli, and Kelly shrugged. She had been worried about Blair, she told her cousin. Blair was sorry that she disliked the vase that Melinda had made, but it really had been ugly, she confided to Kelly. \"A vase that only a daughter could love,\" Kelly said sadly, as Blair departed for Todd's house.\n\n\nJust as Natalie started to correct Roxy's assumption, John walked in. He gave Natalie a huge hug, and Roxy warned him about Natalie's mood swings. She hugged and kissed the pair awkwardly and took a hint to leave. Blair's entire planned life with Eli had all been a lie, John said. Natalie asked John about his trip to Tahiti, and he told her about the latest turn of events. The cops had arrested Ross, because they had thought he was Eli. Natalie realized that Ross had been in on his brother's misdeeds. John was waiting for the medical examiner's report, but he agreed with Natalie's assessment of justifiable homicide, in the event that Eli had died from his bullet wound. John would want someone dead if they did \"that\" to him, he said adamantly.\n\n\nNatalie was glad to hear that Blair wasn't physically hurt. Gruffly, John told her that Eli had committed his crimes just because he had wanted to stop the truth. \"Lying never works,\" he said simply. Natalie nervously offered to change her doctor's appointment in the event that John was too tired to go, but he was excited and just wanted to take a shower. When he finished up, Natalie was sitting on the edge of the bed and sulking. He asked what was wrong, and she stood up. She had to tell him something, she said uneasily.\n\n\nRex decided to go for a swim and left Gigi to her application. Instead, he saw Kelly as she stood on the bridge with an urn filled with her mother's ashes. Kelly explained that Melinda had loved the quarry, and they had spent a special day there one time. It was a day when Melinda had been clear of mind, and Kelly had promised to take her back there some day. She \"introduced\" her mother to Rex and whispered that Rex had believed in them. Rex left Kelly alone and headed back to sit with Gigi, who had completed her application.\n\n\nKelly said goodbye to her mother and told her she loved her. She slowly poured her mother's ashes into the water.\n\n\nLayla and Cristian continued to urge each other to accept their new jobs, even though Layla would be off to Paris while Cristian remained behind in Llanview. Each admitted they had asked for job deferments in order to please the other. They couldn't figure out what to do. Destiny overheard the conversation from her own booth nearby, and she turned to join in on the discussion. She compared the couple's dilemma to a science fiction book she was reading. The couple in the book were separated by time, though, with one person in the past, and the other in the present. She hadn't finished yet, so she was not familiar with the ending. She also couldn't remember if it was a romance or a tragedy.\n\n\nBlair arrived at Todd's house, and Jack hugged his mother. He was glad she was okay, but he reminded her that he hadn't wanted her to marry Eli. He went to get Dani, and Blair had a moment alone with Todd. He was happy that she was back, and he was amused that she had shot Eli. She and Todd both admitted that they weren't really okay like they had been telling everyone. Dani and Jack returned, and Dani wondered if all she had heard about Eli were true. Blair told her it was, and he had fooled lots of people. She was there for Dani and sorry she had left in the first place. Dani assured her she was fine, but Blair knew she wasn't. \"It all just sucks,\" Blair said as she wrapped her arms around the teen.\n\n\nShortly after, everyone left except for Todd. He wanted to wait for Greg, who was accompanying T\u00e9a's remains. He just needed T\u00e9a, and Dani needed Blair, he told his ex-wife. Blair expressed her sympathy for Todd's loss. Greg arrived as expected, but he didn't have T\u00e9a's ashes. He had something to tell Todd about T\u00e9a.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair returns home distraught to know that she's been betrayed by Eli and feeling guilty and embarrassed to know that she did not listen to all the people who warned her about him. Rex wants to support Gigi in going back to school. But he runs into Kelly who is ready to throw her mother's ashes into her favorite river. Cristian and Layla find themselves having a dilemma between their respective career dreams and being together. Jessica finds that she cannot keep the secret from Brody anymore. So she admits that he may not be the father of her child. Natalie is similarly keeping her secret from John as well as from Roxy.",
