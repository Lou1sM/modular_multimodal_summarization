Todd expressed his sympathy for Victor's death and acknowledged that while Victor had been a fraud, he had been T\u00e9a's fraud. T\u00e9a's response was to slap Todd's face, and she accused him of being the one who had killed Victor.\n\n\nT\u00e9a went off on Todd. While she understood Todd's feelings towards Victor, nothing had been Victor's fault, she said. Todd's stolen life could be blamed on Irene. T\u00e9a was irate that Todd could have killed Victor without considering his children's feelings. \"I didn't,\" Todd said. T\u00e9a continued to shout. She wondered how Todd thought that Dani might have felt as she'd watched Victor's body zipped into a body bag.\n\n\nTodd began to shout back, and he insisted that he hadn't killed Victor because he'd thought about his kids. \"Liar,\" T\u00e9a yelled. Todd continued to deny T\u00e9a's charge. She pointed out that he was innocent, yet oddly, he had been detained at the police station. Everyone had been searching for Todd, because he had been the prime suspect. Todd explained that he had turned himself in for that reason. He was innocent and he could prove it.\n\n\nTodd agreed that he had taken the gun out of Dorian's safe and had planned to confront Victor. If the gun had accidentally gone off, he wouldn't have been upset, though it would have been Karma who had shot the gun, Todd declared. He had realized that it hadn't been his children's fault that they hadn't known that Victor hadn't been their father. \"Prove it,\" T\u00e9a ordered him.\n\n\nTodd explained that the gun would be located at the station, and everyone would see that it had not been fired. T\u00e9a began to shout again, and Todd proclaimed that T\u00e9a hadn't changed. She'd never listened when he tried to talk. T\u00e9a continued to rant, but Todd demanded to know why T\u00e9a hadn't seen through Victor. Todd hollered that she had married an imposter, and therefore, she was an idiot.\n\n\nT\u00e9a maintained that she wasn't at fault as she'd even had a DNA test run to prove that the man with the new face had been who he'd said he was. Todd couldn't believe that the thought hadn't occurred to T\u00e9a that it really hadn't been him. He pointed out that Starr had known, especially after the man claiming to be her father had pushed her down the stairs when she'd been pregnant. Also, when the man had locked up Marty in his house.\n\n\nTodd wondered how people could have believed that Victor had been Todd after some of the things that Victor had done. T\u00e9a maintained that Victor had been trying to make up for some of the things he'd done, and she ordered Todd not to say anything bad about Victor. He had been just like Todd and had made some mistakes, T\u00e9a asserted.\n\n\nVictor had had all of Todd's bad qualities, but he'd had good qualities as well, T\u00e9a insisted. They were good qualities that Todd had never had. Victor had loved her \"in a way you never could,\" T\u00e9a declared. Victor had been passionate, giving, and gentle while Todd had abandoned her on an island. \"He gave me back my life,\" and was a great lover, T\u00e9a continued. \"I really don't want to hear this,\" Todd proclaimed.\n\n\nTodd repeated that Victor hadn't been a kidnapper or bully. \"He wasn't a sex offender. Never raped anyone, unlike you,\" T\u00e9a snapped.\n\n\nElsewhere in the station, Natalie informed Brody and John that she had learned what kind of gun had been used to kill Victor. It had been a nine-millimeter. Brody pointed out that it was the same type of gun that was missing from Dorian's safe. John noted that it was a common gun and standard issue for police officers. He revealed that Todd had turned himself in.\n\n\nThe gun that Todd had claimed he had given to Louie to turn in for cash was not to be found. John requested that Brody look for Louie in order to prove Todd's claims. Natalie confirmed that forensics was still analyzing items for fingerprints, though the killer might not have touched anything in Victor's house. Awkwardly, Natalie noticed that John continued to stare at her, and out of the blue, he told her he was sorry.\n\n\nNatalie was confused. \"Sorry?\" she asked. John responded that while he knew that Natalie's relationship with her uncle had been complicated, he was sorry for Victor's death. Natalie agreed that no one ever deserved to die the way that Victor had, and there were plenty of people suffering due to Victor's death. She noted that Rex had been happy.\n\n\nJohn wondered if Rex might have been motivated to seek justice, but Natalie hurriedly assured him that Rex would never consider killing someone. John was surprised when Brody returned, and he again asked Brody to check on Todd's story. Brody announced that he'd already been to the docks, and there had been no signs of Louie. All of the man's belongings were gone.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wondered if she'd touched a nerve with Todd, but he replied that he didn't want to talk about the past. Tearfully, T\u00e9a stated that was all she had left thanks to Todd. He swore that he wasn't the one who had killed Victor, and he grabbed T\u00e9a's wrists. He wanted her to believe him. T\u00e9a struggled to break free and demanded that Todd let her go. John walked into the room and ordered Todd to take his hands off of T\u00e9a.\n\n\nJohn wondered how T\u00e9a had managed to get into the room, and she assured him she was leaving. Todd asked whether John had located Louie and checked out the gun, but John revealed that Louie had disappeared. They didn't have the gun. T\u00e9a wondered if Todd still wanted to insist that he hadn't killed Victor.\n\n\nJohn suggested that Todd hire a lawyer, and he wondered whether Todd wanted to change his story. \"Delgado's gonna represent me,\" Todd announced.\n\n\nEcho greeted Rex and Shane when they returned home. She asked to speak to Rex alone, and she showed him the gun she had found. She wondered if Rex had been the one to shoot Victor. Rex was indignant. He admitted that while he'd thought about committing the crime, he hadn't done it. Echo reminded him that he'd made an attempt at the movie premiere, but Rex declared that he'd lost his nerve that time. \"Did you get it back?\" Echo wondered.\n\n\nRex maintained that he hadn't changed his mind, and he hadn't killed Victor. Echo revealed that she was aware that Rex had gone out late at night in a thunderstorm, and she'd seen his muddy shoes. Rex asked if Echo had turned into a private investigator, but he confessed that he'd gone to visit Gigi's grave. He had been there earlier in the day, and he'd wanted to check to see that things were okay. He told her about the exhumation.\n\n\nRex was certain that he hadn't imagined seeing Gigi, and he'd wanted to make sure. \"Now I know Gigi really is dead,\" Rex said sadly. Echo understood that grief and anger made people do desperate things. Rex wondered if she were referring to the grave, and Echo replied that she was aware that Rex had wanted justice. She wanted him to trust her, and he could tell her if he'd done something drastic.\n\n\nAt the caf\u00e9, Ford imagined that he saw and heard Tess, but he told himself that he was only having hallucinations. He admitted that he probably needed some caffeine, and he shrugged it off. Suddenly, Tess appeared again. She accused him of trying to get rid of her. Ford denied the accusation and informed her that he missed her and wanted her back.\n\n\nTess pointed out that he had been avoiding Jessica, and he would have to \"get in her face,\" in order to force Tess to reappear. \"Jessica's integrated now,\" Ford declared. \"So disintegrate her,\" Tess demanded. Ford stressed that he would not interfere with Jessica's sanity. Jessica had been trying to rebuild her life, Ford explained. He loved Tess, but it was Jessica's body and life. Tess accused him of loving Jessica more than her.\n\n\nTess insisted that they would get back together, or Ford would lose her forever. She wanted him to fight for her \"hard and dirty the way I like it.\" She disappeared, and Ford began to shout. The waitress hurried over and asked if he were calling for her. Ford asked for his check.\n\n\nCristian paid a visit to Llanfair. He and Jessica shared a long kiss in order to find out if there might still be something between them. They both agreed that the \"spark\" was still there. \"What do we do about it?\" Cristian wanted to know. Jessica didn't think they should \"read too much into it,\" and she pointed out that she had too much to deal with in her life with all of her family members. She suggested that the kiss had been more of a confusion than a spark.\n\n\nCristian contended that he knew the difference between excitement and confusion, and he thought that there might be a connection of some kind that would change their lives. \"If we let it,\" he added. Jessica insisted that her life was crazy, and she'd hurt lots of people. She'd abandoned her children, among other things. She also acknowledged that she couldn't be with Ford because she reminded him of Tess.\n\n\nSuddenly, Jessica recalled that Cristian had been married to Natalie at one time, and she could \"stick it to Natalie.\" Cristian didn't want Natalie to be a reason for anything. He would always care for Jessica, but he agreed that maybe it wasn't a good idea to turn back the clock. Jessica thought that he was sweet, and Cristian recalled how comfortable and safe he'd felt when he'd dated Jessica in high school.\n\n\nJessica agreed that she would love to have an uncomplicated life, but they were different people from who they'd been in high school. Cristian showed her an old letter he'd found. He agreed that their lives were complicated, but still good. He thought it was great that they were still in each other's lives, and he loved her just as so many other people did. Jessica kissed him. \"I'll always love you, too, Cristian,\" she said.\n\n\nCristian excused himself, citing the need to get ready for a new school year after they looked up and saw Ford walk in. \"So, what's going on?\" Ford asked. Jessica had the same question for Ford. She recalled agreeing not to see each other due to reminders of Tess. Ford wondered what was going on between Jessica and Cristian.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Sam walked down the stairs and found Jack and Blair talking together. Against Blair's advice, Jack grabbed the little boy and told him that his father was dead. Scarface had been the one who had killed Victor. \"You're lying,\" Sam replied. Blair was livid, and she ordered Jack to go upstairs. She had planned to talk to Sam herself. Sam insisted that none of it was true.\n\n\nJack had a habit of telling lies, Sam reminded Blair. She agreed that Jack did lie at times, but for once he had been telling the truth. \"Daddy's gone,\" Blair told Sam. \"Where did he go?\" Sam asked. Blair did her best to explain that Sam's daddy had been hurt badly, couldn't get better, and had died. The man had loved his children very much, and they would be able to feel his love shining down on them, Blair asserted.\n\n\nBlair advised the boy that his family would stick by him, and memories of Sam's father would keep the man alive. \"It's not the same,\" Sam replied. Blair assured him it was okay to be sad and brave, and she told him to keep his chin up so that his father could see Sam smile.\n\n\nJack was surprised when Shane showed up, and he wondered if Shane were gloating over Victor's death. Shane expressed his sympathy and noted that he knew how it felt to lose a parent. Jack promised that the killer wouldn't get away with it, and Scarface would be going to jail. Shane noted that someone had been held in jail for killing Gigi, but the real killer was still walking around. \"For now,\" Shane added.\n\n\nSam decided that he wanted to get his things ready for school. He didn't want his father to be dead, and he asked about his father's killer. Blair explained that John would find out who'd committed the crime.\n\n\nJack found his mother crying, and he apologized for telling Sam the news. He'd been angry. Blair informed him that she was angry, as well, but she didn't want Jack to accuse Todd of shooting Victor without all of the facts, because Todd was his father. Jack agreed that he wouldn't upset Sam again, but he was certain that Todd had been the one who'd killed Victor. He believed that Blair felt the same way.\n\n\nEcho didn't want Shane to lose his father after losing his mother. Rex assured her that wouldn't happen. Rex hadn't killed Victor, though he was grateful that it had happened. Echo insisted that she'd feel better if the gun weren't in the house, but Rex clarified that the gun was always kept in the safe. Echo declared that she didn't want it around at all.\n\n\nRex reiterated that he hadn't shot Victor, and the gun had never been fired. The pair didn't hear Shane walk in, and Rex wondered how long his son had been standing there. Shane replied that he had just walked in from the kitchen, and he asked what Rex and Echo had been talking about. Rex made up something about a moat, and he suggested that he and Shane go upstairs to check out Shane's new computer.\n\n\nAfter the guys were gone, Echo emptied the gun and counted the bullets. One of the bullets was missing. \"This gun's been fired. Rex was lying,\" Echo proclaimed.\n\n\nCristian returned to the caf\u00e9, and the waitress handed him a note from Carlotta. It stated that Cristian should call the dean at the university as soon as possible. Cristian placed the call. \"You want me to what?\" Cristian asked incredulously.\n\n\nBrody advised Natalie that he was heading home, and she promised to follow after she finished checking on the fingerprints from Victor's house. She mentioned dinner, but Brody said he wasn't hungry. Natalie asked him if something were wrong. He assured her that all was fine.\n\n\nA young woman walked into the station and stated that she had been Victor's secretary. She wanted to speak with John about Victor's murder. Natalie explained that John was busy, and she offered to hear what the woman had to say. The secretary insisted on privacy, and Natalie took her into John's office. \"It involves a police officer named Brody Lovett,\" the woman said.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sam refuses to believe it when Jack says Scarface killed their dad. Blair explains it in a way that a small child can understand. Shane goes to La Boulaie to express his condolences to Jack. Jack tells him that his father's murderer will go to jail. Shane tells him his mother's murderer is still free, for now. Echo sees that Rex has a pistol and wonders if he shot Victor. He assures her that he did not. He tells her that he was at Gigi's grave making sure she was still there. He says he had her exhumed and now he knows she is dead. Echo recommends that Rex get the handgun out of the house anyway. Shane overhears them talking about the gun.
