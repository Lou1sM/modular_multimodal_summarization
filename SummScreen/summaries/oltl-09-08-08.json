    "soap_central": "\n\"Live, From the Lord Library...\"\n\n\nTodd helped Marty take her first steps across the room. Thrilled by her progress, Marty and Todd embraced and shared a passionate kiss. Feeling guilty, Todd pulled away and apologized to Marty. Believing Todd had no reason to apologize, Marty wondered what was bothering him. Todd suggested that he and Marty move far away from Llanview and start a new life together with his grandchild. When Marty reminded Todd that he would be leaving his children behind, Todd acknowledged that he was aware that he would no longer have access to his children, but expressed his need to get far away from Blair and John. Citing that it was the only way to start over, Todd urged Marty to consider changing their identities and relocating to a deserted island. Marty worried that John would find her, but Todd assured her that he wouldn't. Marty agreed to start a new life with Todd. \n\n\nOn the roof of the Angel Square Hotel, John and Blair flirted over a few drinks. Blair wondered if John was still consumed with thoughts of Todd's mystery woman. After admitting that he was, John inquired about why Blair no longer wore her wedding ring. Stating that she had no regrets, Blair confessed that she still thought about Todd spending time with another woman. \n\n\nJohn and Blair discussed their relationship. Unable to keep their hands off one another, John and Blair kissed. Moments later, they headed downstairs to John's apartment. \n\n\nInside John's office, a clear image of Marty appeared on the computer screen. \n\n\nIn the basement at Llanfair, Tina tried to figure out a way to free herself and David Vickers from Tess's secret room. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Sarah interrupted Tess's conversation with an unconscious and drugged Natalie. Claiming that Nat was asleep, Tess tried to convince Sarah that Nat hadn't been feeling well because of her troubled relationship with Jared, and needed to rest. Upon observing Nat in an uncomfortable position on the couch, Sarah suggested that they wake her so that she could go to sleep in her own bed. Attempting to prevent Sarah from disturbing Nat, Tess asked Sarah to leave. A determined Sarah tried to wake Nat, to no avail. Fed up with Sarah's interference, Tess pushed Sarah out the door. \n\n\nWhile cuddling David Vickers, Tina discovered a television remote in the locked secret room. Upon turning on the television monitor, Tina witnessed Sarah arguing with Tess. Screaming at the top of her lungs, Tina demanded that Tess stay away from her daughter. Enclosed in the sound-proofed room, Tina's screams went unheard. \n\n\nOut on the patio, Tess continued to chastise Sarah about interrupting Nat's nap. Realizing her cousin wasn't herself, Sarah asked to see Tina. A devilish Tess told Sarah that her mother had gone to New York to shop and wouldn't return home until late. After Sarah left, Tess headed inside to plot her next move. \n\n\nTess entered the basement and spoke to Tina through the glass window. Tina demanded to know what Tess had done to Sarah and pleaded with her niece not to hurt Natalie. After assuring Tina that Sarah was safe, Tess unlocked the door and allowed Tina to leave. Revealing one of the Mendorran stones to a shocked Tina, Tess told her that she would tell Carlo about Tina's thievery unless she did Tess's bidding. Tina refused to allow Tess to hurt Nat. Reminding her that Carlo would undoubtedly harm Sarah if he were to ever find out that Tina had escaped with the jewels, Tess blackmailed her aunt into keeping quiet about her knowledge of Tess surfacing. Tina was convinced that Carlo was locked inside a Mendorran prison and couldn't wreak havoc any longer. Tess reminded Tina that Carlo would escape and torture his enemies. \n\n\nTess advised Tina to leave David Vickers in the secret room because she would need the use of both her hands. Cornered, Tina followed Tess back upstairs. \n\n\nAs David Vickers watched from the secret room, Tess and Tina dragged an unconscious Natalie out of the library. Moments later, Tina watched in horror as Tess locked a sleeping Natalie inside the secret room. Tina wondered how Tess could do such a thing. Screaming, Tess claimed that everything she had done was for Bree. Turning off the lights, Tess remarked, \"Good night, Sis!\" \n\n\nInside an unknown location, an enraged Carlo spoke to an unconscious and shackled Cristian. Carlo ranted about the embarrassment Talia, Cris, Antonio, and Sarah caused him in Mendorra. Carlo stated that Cris and his accomplices should have made sure that he was dead before attempting to go on with their lives. \n\n\nUpon regaining consciousness, Cris attempted to unshackle himself and attack Carlo. Unable to free himself, Cris continued to struggle with his restraints and lunge at Carlo. Laughing and staying out of Cris's reach, Carlo taunted Cris. Frustrated, Cris demanded to know what Carlo had planned for him. Citing that he wanted to keep him alert, Carlo assured Cris that he didn't intend to kill him. Cris warned Carlo that Antonio would find him. Carlo exited the room and locked the door behind him. \n\n\nAt the cottage, Brody provoked Rex into hitting him in front of Shane. After coming to Brody's aid, a furious Shane demanded that Rex leave at once. Rex pleaded with Shane to allow him to explain, but the child made it clear that he didn't want anything to do with Rex. Reminding Rex that he had a chance with his mother and blew it, Shane stated that Rex chose Adriana. Gigi threatened to punish Shane unless he apologized to Rex. Refusing to apologize, Shane said he couldn't be punished because he had everything he always wanted-his dad. As Shane bolted out of the room, Rex and Gigi appeared devastated. With a smirk, Brody insisted that Rex leave. \n\n\nRex and Brody became embroiled in another argument. Brody continued to degrade Rex about running out on a pregnant Gigi, and Rex insisted that Brody remove himself from Shane's life. Upset over Shane's display of anger and the battle between Rex and Brody, a teary-eyed Gigi asked Rex to leave. \n\n\nInsisting that Shane needed to know the truth about his paternity, Rex begged Gigi to tell their son that he was Shane's father. Agreeing that Shane needed to know the truth, Gigi begged Rex to give her more time to break the news to him. Gigi walked Rex to the door. Stating that she was exhausted from the trip, Gigi promised to tell Shane the truth in the morning. Rex agreed to leave, but reminded her of her promise. Gigi presented Rex with a photo of Shane and assured him that she would make Shane understand the truth about his paternity. Rex appeared hopeful. As they hugged and said goodbye at the door, Brody interrupted and told Gigi that Shane was waiting for her. While Rex walked away distraught, Gigi found Shane and Brody waiting to speak to her. A tearful Gigi listened as Shane announced that he hated Rex and never wanted to see him again.\n\n\n",
