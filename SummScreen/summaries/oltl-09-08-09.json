    "soap_central": "\nBetween Shaun and the Dark of Night\n\n\nAt the police station, Nora picked up her belongings, delighted to be released from jail.  Matthew and Destiny arrived, and Matthew apologized to his mother for T\u00e9a's cross-examination of Rachel.  Nora told Matthew she didn't blame him.  Matthew asked if she'd heard from Rachel, and Nora replied that Rachel had left her a message and seemed better.\n\n\nAfter the kids left, Nora called Clint and promised to be home soon, only to eat her words as Bo and the squad dragged in the protesting Mayor Lowell.  Nora was shocked to see Lowell in cuffs, and Bo explained that he'd been caught on tape ordering a  hit on Cole.  Marty and Cole walked in, relieved to hear of Lowell's arrest.  Marty thought it was all over, but Cole still had one question: Where was Starr?\n\n\nIn a darkened warehouse, Starr pleaded with Sergei and his men to let her and Hope go, warning him that her family was powerful and well-connected.  Sergei was unimpressed, and told her that no one would find them.  As Cole called Starr's phone again, Sergei ignored the ringing.  He asked Starr if she'd helped Cole spy on him, if they'd mocked him behind his back.  As Sergei's anger grew, Hope became hysterical, crying loudly.  Starr begged Sergei to let her hold and comfort her daughter, and Sergei finally agreed.  He told Starr that she and her little girl were his ticket out of Llanview.  Examining her phone, he ogled a picture of Blair, and then told his hostage it was time for her to do as he said if she wanted to live.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, John and Fish rushed onto the crime scene.  As Fish secured the perimeter, John struggled to resuscitate Shaun, who still had a pulse.  Hearing a noise, Fish checked the closet and found Todd, bound, gagged, and beaten.  Todd recounted the attack, and slammed John for involving Cole and Starr in his sting operation.  He told John the mayor would have his badge.  \n\n\nJohn explained that Lowell had been the center of the drug ring.  Mortified, Todd blamed himself for exposing the family to danger by going to Lowell, but John said it wasn't his fault, and that the mayor had already known about Cole.  After the EMTs arrived to take Shaun to the hospital, John tried to convince Todd to accompany them.  Todd refused, insisting that Sergei had told him to stay and wait to hear about Starr.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a unpacked her things and happily reclaimed her necklace with her new engagement ring on it.  She marveled at the \"divorce papers\" Ross had sent her, and spoke aloud about how her freedom had been worth the money she'd had to give up to get Ross Rayburn out of her life.\n\n\nOn an international flight back to Llanview, Blair and Ross sat in awkward silence, whiling away the hours.  Ross attempted to break the ice and make conversation, urging Blair to get to know him.  Blair wasn't interested; she insisted they stick to business, and the details of her strategy to nail T\u00e9a.  She warned him that when they returned to Llanview, he'd have to stay out of sight for several days.  She promised Ross suitable \"harmless\" entertainment in the meantime, but the carefree Ross scoffed that there was no kind of fun that was harmless.  Ross was taken with Blair's aggressiveness, and called her a hell of a woman.  Blair pointedly told him that hers was normal behavior for the Cramer women.\n\n\nBack at Todd's, Rachel arrived, running smack into T\u00e9a.  T\u00e9a hoped to mend fences, but Rachel called T\u00e9a a self-serving bitch, and said she was only there to see Shaun.  T\u00e9a said he was out and suggested Rachel wait in the living room.  Unable to think of an alternative, Rachel resigned herself to T\u00e9a's company.  The former roommates quickly began to argue about their fracas in court, with Rachel tearing into T\u00e9a for humiliating her in front of everyone.  T\u00e9a reminded Rachel that she'd made herself vulnerable by standing up and challenging Greg's testimony, making it about herself for no apparent reason, and asked her why she'd done it.\n\n\nRachel quickly replied that there was nothing between her and Greg, but T\u00e9a had never said there was.  Rachel told T\u00e9a that her personal relationships were none of T\u00e9a's business, and that they hadn't been friends for a long time.  Yet she vented, admitting that she'd needed her confrontation with T\u00e9a in court to shake her up, and make her face some truths.  The only problem was that she'd wrecked her relationship with Shaun in the process.  Rachel acknowledged that she wasn't into Shaun the way he was into her, and had played it safe with a man who wouldn't challenge her or test her boundaries.  She wanted to find Shaun so she could be straight with him about their future, or lack thereof.\n\n\nT\u00e9a decided to call Todd to get Shaun's whereabouts.  At La Boulaie, Todd answered, expecting Starr.  After Todd explained the kidnapping and Shaun's injuries, T\u00e9a passed the news on to Rachel, and the ladies rushed out into the night.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Destiny escorted Matthew home.  Matthew couldn't stop worrying about Rachel and her whereabouts, but Destiny told him not to fret.  She suspected Rachel was preparing for her big date with Shaun.  Destiny told Matthew that Shaun was a stand-up guy, her rock, who was always there for her.  She said that both her brothers were good men, but very different.  Destiny felt that Shaun and Rachel were the real deal, because they'd started as friends and become more.  \"That's how it always happens,\" Destiny mused.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Greg was working the night shift with Dr. Vivian Wright.  Vivian asked Greg how his day in court had gone, and Greg told her about Rachel's meltdown on the stand.  Hearing the emotion in Greg's voice, Vivian told him she'd been right about his feelings for Ms. Gannon.  Greg flashed back to his kiss with Rachel, but told Vivian that it wasn't like that, and that Rachel was committed to Shaun.  Pleased to have the competition out of the way, Vivian suggested they go out on another date.\n\n\nJust then, the EMTs rushed in with Shaun on a gurney.  Horrified, Greg rushed over, attempting to help, only to be turned away.  Watching helplessly as the doctors prepped Shaun for surgery, Greg spoke up when they asked for next of kin.  Rachel arrived, looking on as Greg tried once more to assist with Shaun's care, only to be pried away, screaming and crying, with Vivian comforting him.  \"Shaun!\" Rachel cried, staring at the wounded bodyguard as Greg turned to see her.\n\n\nOvercome, Rachel rushed into the corridor, calling Matthew.  Matthew was pleased to hear from his sister, but Rachel interrupted his apologies and immediately asked if Destiny was with him.  After Rachel told Matthew the bad news, Matthew hung up, his face falling as he turned to Destiny.  \"What's wrong?\" Destiny asked as Matthew took her hand.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the surgical team wheeled Shaun off to the operating room  as Greg begged them to save his brother.  Sharing a tearful gaze with Rachel, Greg quickly ran after Shaun.  Rachel was left alone in the hallway, sobbing.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Todd struggled to reassemble the house's landline connection, hoping to hear from Sergei.  T\u00e9a arrived, shocked to see Todd's condition, and immediately began to play Florence Nightingale, bandaging his wounds and calling the pharmacist.  T\u00e9a couldn't believe that Mayor Lowell was behind the drug ring, or that Cole had become an undercover operative.  T\u00e9a told Todd he had to call Blair and tell her about the kidnapping.  Todd said Blair was away on business, but T\u00e9a urged him to try anyway.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station , Nora was thrilled to have Lowell behind bars.  Lowell didn't seem worried, and gloated that he'd never do time.  As news of the abduction at La Boulaie broke, Cole went wild, attempting to rush the mayor, but Bo pulled him back .  Bo and Nora hammered Lowell, demanding he give up Sergei's location.  Lowell played dumb until Fish and John arrived, playing the tape of Sergei and Lowell discussing Starr and Hope's whereabouts before the kidnapping.  Though he was caught red-handed, Lowell insisted he didn't know where Sergei took the girls.\n\n\nAfter Nora led Lowell away, John, Bo, and Cole struggled to figure out where Sergei could've taken his hostages.  Just then, Starr called Cole's phone.  Starr told Cole that she and Hope were all right, prompting Sergei to commandeer the call.  Sergei asked to speak to Bo, who told him that Lowell was in custody and they needed to egotiate.  \n\n\nSergei said there would be no negotiation, only cooperation, as he had hostages.  He demanded a million dollars and a jet at Llanview Airfield.  While Fish used a GPS tracker to follow the signal, Bo attempted to keep Sergei on the line, but Sergei had timed his call, and hung up before the computer could trace his location.  Luckily, Fish's technical wizardry used another layer of detection, and the police were able to pinpoint the location and visual on Sergei's warehouse hideout.  Cole wanted to pay Sergei's ransom, but John told him that Sergei had no intention of freeing the girls.\n\n\nOn the plane, Ross awoke to find Blair asleep on his shoulder.  He enjoyed the moment until Blair woke up, immediately pulling away from him.  Ross was anxious for their flight to land so he could set foot in the United States once more.  Blair couldn't wait for them to get home and put their plan into motion, and promised that T\u00e9a would never know what hit her.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Todd left another angry voicemail for Blair, ordering her to call him back immediately.  T\u00e9a plied Todd with coffee and  TLC, hoping to calm him down, but Todd grew emotional as he told her how powerless he felt to help his daughter and granddaughter.  He wanted to rush off and find Sergei himself, but T\u00e9a stopped him, reminding Todd that all they could do was wait.  As she told him about her day in court, Todd noticed T\u00e9a's engagement ring was no longer on her finger.  T\u00e9a revealed her necklace, and promptly slipped the ring back onto her hand.  Comforted by T\u00e9a's presence, Todd asked if she'd stay with him.  Curling up next to Todd, T\u00e9a promised him that she was with him forever.\n\n\nAt the warehouse, Starr and Hope sat tied up and helpless as Sergei and his thugs strategized.  The other men suspected trickery by the cops, but Sergei was confident that the LPD would cooperate.\n\n\nAt the police station, Bo and John laid out blueprints for the warehouse block that Fish's tracker had pinpointed.  Fish reminded them that Sergei and his men could be in one of several warehouses, and they didn't have time to search them all.  Cole wanted to accompany the police strike team, but Marty asked him to let the cops do their job.  John promised Cole that he would bring Starr and Hope home safe.  \"How?\" Cole asked.  John had no answer. \n\n\n",
