John told Natalie not to answer it, but Natalie expected Roxy butting in again and went to shoo her foster mom away.  Instead, she found Marty waiting outside.\n\n\nWelcoming the interruption, Natalie let Marty in.  Embracing John, Marty told him she had heard all about Elijah, and thanked him for his efforts to nail the murderer of their unborn child.  John confirmed that Eli had been killed in the fire in Tahiti, but wished he had been able to take the murderer back to Llanview to face the music.  He told Marty that Eli had murdered their child simply to pull John out of Kelly's investigation, and blamed himself for allowing the baby to become collateral damage.\n\n\nMarty assured John that he had done everything he could, and that the important thing was that Eli couldn't hurt them or their loved ones ever again.  She was ready to move on, and suggested that John and Natalie had a very good reason to do the same.  The truth would help her deal with her loss.  Commenting on the awkwardness of the situation between the three of them, Marty told John and Natalie that despite everything, she was happy for them, and glad that John had a second chance at being a father.  Natalie listened with trepidation to Marty's words of wisdom, and remained silent as John walked his ex-girlfriend out of the apartment.\n\n\nReturning to Natalie, John told her they didn't have much time before the sonogram appointment, and asked her what she had to tell him about Brody and the baby.  Stumbling over her words, Natalie managed to spin a cover story about how she had run into Brody at the obstetrician's office, and learned about Jessica testing their baby's Rh factor.  Natalie claimed that she had been spurred by her encounter with Brody to think of all the things that could go wrong in a pregnancy, and asked if John was okay with the risks.\n\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm okay with it,\" John philosophized, \"but when life throws you a curve ball, you swing away.\"  \"So if something happens,\" Natalie began, wrestling with her secret.  \"...We deal with it,\" John finished, but said that all he was planning on was living his life with her and their child.  Hugging Natalie, he told her nothing was going to get in the way of that dream.\n\n\nHowever, Natalie remained uncertain about the future.  She told John she was worried about Jessica's pregnancy as well as her own, and knew from past experience that anything could happen.  John felt that there was no point living in fear and worrying constantly, but promised that he would do the worrying for \"the three of us,\" as long as Natalie made the next nine months the happiest of their lives.  As they embraced, Natalie told him he had a deal, and walked out of the apartment with John by her side.\n\n\nArriving at the hospital, John and Natalie met with Dr. Wright.  As she signed in, Natalie noticed Jessica's signature above hers on the form, and was surprised to learn that Brody and her sister had a sonogram appointment on the same day.  Dr. Wright assured her that all was well with Brody and Jessica's child, and led John and Natalie to an open exam room.\n\n\nIn another exam room, a less happy scene unfolded as Jessica told a shocked Brody that he might not be the father of her baby, and that she had slept with someone else.  Weeping, she explained her indiscretion on prom night, and said she hadn't been in her right mind when she had made love with the wrong man.  Brody couldn't believe someone would have taken advantage of Jessica in her fragile state, but even as Jessica took pains to hide her bedmate's identity, Brody quickly realized that she had slept with Ford when she had gone to Cristian's apartment that night.\n\n\nJessica explained that Ford had repeatedly denied the truth until she confronted him with his recent Hepatitis C test.  She had blocked out their lovemaking, but Ford remembered it all.  Stunned, Brody reasoned that since she had only been with Ford once, the lecherous professor might not be the baby's father.  Brody's face fell when Jessica explained that she and Ford hadn't used protection.\n\n\nBrody raged over Ford's irresponsible behavior, but Jessica said it was her fault as well; she had fled the truth about Cristian's love for Layla, and about her traumatic experience with Mitch.  \"You were fragile and Ford used that,\" Brody spat, disgusted.  Jessica admitted that Ford had swayed her by saying all the right things.  She had kept quiet about the possibility that the baby was Ford's, until she learned he was Rh-positive, and she hadn't wanted to hide the truth.  Brody was stricken to realize that Dr. Wright knew the truth as well.\n\n\nBrody stood in shell-shocked silence as Jessica explained that after seeing their baby for the first time during the sonogram, she hadn't been able to lie anymore.  She couldn't bear to think what it would do to Brody if Ford were the father instead, and feared Brody wouldn't want anything to do with her or the child.  Brody's face grew more and more downcast as Jessica said she knew he would never have kept such a secret if their situations were reversed.  She still loved him and wanted to marry him, and promised that whether or not the baby was biologically his, she would still want Brody to be the child's father and wouldn't let Ford near it.  \"This is your baby,\" Jessica vowed through her tears, \"and we love you, if you still want us.\"\n\n\nJessica begged Brody to say something.  Dumbstruck, Brody finally told her he had to go and fled the exam room, ignoring her pleas for him to return.  Sobbing, Jessica stared at the sonogram photograph of her baby.\n\n\nIn another exam room, Dr. Wright led John and Natalie through their first sonogram.  Natalie wept as she saw the baby's face.  \"Looks good to me,\" John marveled.  Wright asked them if they wanted to know the baby's sex, and John and Natalie voted to keep it a surprise.\n\n\nDr. Wright told the couple that their baby appeared to be healthy and normal.  Touched, John kissed Natalie's forehead.  \"I'm the luckiest guy on earth,\" he declared.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd was infuriated when Greg said that he didn't have T\u00e9a's ashes.  Todd demanded to know where the remains were.  \"That's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Greg began. \"T\u00e9a's -- \"  Just then, he received an anonymous text message, which read, \"Don't say another word.\"\n\n\nSpooked, Greg lied to Todd and said that the St. Kitts authorities were forcing him to send T\u00e9a's ashes home separately.  Todd was baffled by Greg's insistence on stopping by with useless information, and asked if Greg was hoping to ease his conscience - he had hidden T\u00e9a from her loved ones in her final hours, and the guilt was eating away at him.  Rattled, Greg told Todd his conscience was clear and insisted he had only done what his patient wanted.  Todd asked Greg if he had ever wondered if T\u00e9a's tumor had eaten away at her, as well, stripping away her ability to reason and think in her right mind.  As Todd railed at him, Greg grappled with his emotions, and finally blurted out that T\u00e9a had changed her mind and asked for Todd and Danielle before passing away.\n\n\nPinning Greg to the wall, Todd demanded to know the details of T\u00e9a's last request.  Greg confirmed that T\u00e9a had a moment of clarity and had asked him to summon her family.  \"Why didn't you call me?\" Todd hissed.  Greg said he had thought T\u00e9a was having one of a series of delusional episodes, but claimed he had tried to reach Todd and Danielle anyway; unfortunately, they had already left Llanview, and when they arrived in St. Kitts, it was too late.\n\n\nTodd was deflated to realize T\u00e9a had needed him, and he hadn't been there.  Greg apologized for not telling Todd sooner, but claimed to have not wanted to add to the family's grief.  Fed up, Todd told Greg to get out. As Greg left the house, he checked his phone again, troubled by the mysterious text message.\n\n\nAt Llanview University, Langston searched for her classroom on a campus map.  When Ford offered to step in and help, Langston shrugged him off, even though it was his classroom she was searching for.  Brandishing a copy of the university's student-teacher fraternization policy, Langston warned her ex that since he was her professor for the fall semester, he would have to find someone else to play with, and stormed off.  \"But you're the only one that I want,\" Ford mused aloud.\n\n\nIn Ford's classroom, Starr was surprised when James arrived and asked if the seat beside her was taken.  James was equally surprised that Starr had made it to class for the first day, given her family strife.  Starr told James that on top of her mother's ordeal with Eli, she had T\u00e9a's death to contend with, and a memorial to plan.  James gave Starr his condolences, and asked if there was anything he could do.  \"You're already doing it,\" Starr said with a smile.\n\n\nJames asked Starr if all her troubles had led her and Cole to put their issues as a couple on hold.  \"Not exactly,\" Starr said as she sighed.  She explained that she had been at Todd's all night, and Cole had been gone when she woke up.  They kept missing each other, and hadn't talked things out.  Starr admitted she didn't know what they would say to each other when they finally found the time.\n\n\nJust then, Cole appeared in the doorway.  He told Starr that he had another class to attend, but wanted to make time for her and wish her luck on her first day.  Cole was perturbed to see James sharing a class with Starr, and asked when the junior Ford had given up stealing cars.  James explained that he had gotten his GED and was attending Ford's class while awaiting full acceptance into L.U.  \"Well, lucky for you, the admissions office is asleep at the wheel,\" Cole groused.\n\n\nAt Starr's prompting, Cole apologized for his snide remark and said he just wanted a few minutes of her time.  \"I'm sure good old James will cover for you for the first few minutes of class,\" he added as he steered Starr out of the classroom.\n\n\nSoon, Langston arrived and James explained that Cole had dragged Starr out.  Langston teased him about his jealousy, but James said that he and Starr were friends, period, \"just like you and Bobby.\"  Langston corrected him, and said that she and Ford weren't friends, but strictly student and teacher.  James expressed skepticism about things staying professional between the two, but Langston promised that she would have nothing to do with Ford on a personal level as long as he was her instructor.\n\n\nLangston and James noted how empty the classroom was. A passing faculty member quickly informed them that the class had been canceled for the day, as the instructor was being replaced.  The man told the teens that Ford had decided he couldn't teach the class, and that it was \"something about a conflict of interest.\"\n\n\nIn the student union, Starr and Cole had it out.  Cole accused Starr of avoiding him, but Starr said she was only hoping to avert an argument.  Cole said they couldn't pretend things were okay between them, and Starr admitted that she was still angry at him for hiding the truth about Eli.  Cole reminded her that it hadn't been his call, as John and the police had ordered him to keep quiet for fear that the truth would've led to the situation spinning out of control and endangering Blair and Starr.  Starr shot back that John wasn't always right, and that Cole wasn't a cop, but the man she loved.\n\n\nStarr was stunned that Cole had chosen to keep secrets from her even after all they had been through.  Cole insisted that he had lied to her for her own good, and said that if he had to do it over again, he wouldn't have changed a thing.  \"You're starting to sound exactly like my father,\" Starr muttered.  \"You did not just compare me to your dad,\" Cole growled.  Starr said that she didn't need Cole to protect her, and the frustrated Cole asked her just what she did need him for.\n\n\nExasperated, Starr told Cole she loved him and didn't want to fight.  Cole agreed, and asked if they couldn't put all their issues aside and let things be the way they were supposed to be between them.  Starr said she wanted that as well, but she had to get to class.  \"With James?\" Cole asked, then apologized for jumping on the inference, and vowed to be nicer.\n\n\n\"Okay,\" Starr mumbled, heading down the hall.  As Starr left, Cole told her to have a good first day, but before he could finish getting the words out, she was already around the corner and gone.\n\n\nBack in Ford's classroom, Starr found James waiting for her with the news about the cancellation.  James asked if she and Cole had kissed and made up, then apologized for overreaching, and admitted he didn't know the rules of their friendship.  \"That makes two of us,\" Starr said with a sigh.  She said that she and Cole were always apologizing and fighting, and James compared it to the animal instinct of \"fight or flight,\" from Starr's favorite subject, biology.  \"You're not someone who flies,\" James said, and told her that from their days on the run together, he knew she was a fighter who wasn't ready to give up on Cole, though James hated to admit it.\n\n\nStarr admitted that James was right: she couldn't give up on Cole.  Putting his hands on Starr's shoulders, James told her to go to Cole and talk things out once and for all, as that was the only way their relationship would work.  Just then, Cole passed by the classroom, and spotted Starr and James deep in their hushed conversation.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Todd barged into Marty's office, ignoring her protests about his latest intrusion.  He pleaded for her help, and said he needed to do something and couldn't without her expertise, even though she was the last person in the world he wanted to kowtow to.  Todd asked Marty how she had moved on after Patrick had died and left her and Cole alone in the world.  Spotting the picture of Starr, Cole, and Hope on Marty's desk, Todd stressed that he didn't want her pity over T\u00e9a's death, but just wanted to know how to handle the grief and the loss.\n\n\nMarty told Todd she had bad news for him, as there was no \"quick fix\" for a death in the family, and said that he and Danielle would be hurting for a long time.  All they could do was get through each day together, and in time they would learn to live with their loss.  \"T\u00e9a may be dead but she's not gone,\" Marty reasoned, and said that Todd would see T\u00e9a in Dani, just as Marty saw Patrick in Cole.  Dissatisfied, Todd told Marty he found her sage advice lame, and rejected her offer of a referral to another doctor.  \"I hate shrinks,\" Todd growled, storming out. \"I hate all doctors.\"\n\n\nAfter Todd's departure, Marty greeted another surprise visitor: Greg.  Marty assumed he was there to discuss a patient, but Greg told her he was the patient.  The agitated Dr. Evans said he needed to talk to her, and that Marty was the only one he could trust.\n\n\nTodd returned home and received a package from the funeral home in St. Kitts.  Opening it, he found an urn containing T\u00e9a's ashes.  As he sat on the couch in the living room, he recalled his good times with T\u00e9a in her final months, including their wedding and her \"bucket list\" achievements.  Todd sank back onto the couch, clutching the urn to his chest.\n\n\nAt the Llanview University student union, Langston confronted Ford about his \"conflict of interest\" that had led him to withdraw from teaching her course.  Throwing the student-teacher fraternization policy back in Langston's face, Ford told her that his conflict was his desire to get her back.  The fraternization policy only applied if she was his student in his class; therefore, he had withdrawn.  Langston told Ford that whether or not he was her teacher, he didn't have another chance with her, for plenty of reasons.  Ford vowed that he wouldn't stop until he shot all her reasons down, and won her heart once more.\n\n\nFord assured Langston that she didn't have to take him back that day.  \"Tomorrow's not lookin' so hot either,\" Langston quipped, and called him cocky and foolish.  Ford said he had reasons to be confident, and swore that all the old names she used to throw at him -- \"player,\" \"bastard,\" and so on -- would soon fail to apply, as he was entering therapy with Marty Saybrooke to deal with his issues with women and fidelity.  He was taking her and his brother's advice about his problems, and wanted to become a better man, for her.  He pleaded with her to give him a chance, as he was trying to change.\n\n\nLangston was dumbfounded, and told Ford that it would take much more than a mere attempt to win her favor again.  Ford assured her that he would stop at nothing to make her happy, and said that when he was through, she wouldn't even recognize the lying bastard he used to be.  Just then, Brody burst into the student union and punched Ford out before Langston's stunned eyes. \n\n\n",

Natalie is about to tell John that Brody could be her baby's father when Marty stops by to ask John if Eli is really dead. After John and Marty discuss the child they lost, Natalie decides to continue to keep the secret. John and Natalie go to have their first sonogram.

Another teacher comes in and announces that today's class has been cancelled because Ford withdrew as the teacher because of a conflict of interest.
