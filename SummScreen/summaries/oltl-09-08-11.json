He advised Carlotta that a fellow teacher was sick and unable to accept a teaching position in Barcelona, Spain. The position had been offered to Cristian, and he would have to leave in a couple of hours. He thought it was crazy.\n\n\nCarlotta thought that Cristian should take advantage of the opportunity that had been offered to him, because she felt that something was missing for her son in Llanview. He was single and without children, and he had the freedom to go, Carlotta said. Those kinds of offers didn't happen every day, she told him. The kids needed a teacher, and he needed an adventure. Cristian agreed that it would be an amazing experience to be able to paint and teach full-time in Spain, though he worried that there would be no one around for his mother.\n\n\nCarlotta was excited at the thought of being able to visit, and she didn't want Cristian to worry about her. Cristian agreed to accept, and mother and son hugged each other. An excited Rama smiled when she saw them. \"I knew it! You and Jessica are back together,\" Rama exclaimed. Cristian informed Rama that wasn't the case, and he and Jessica had decided that it wasn't to be. He was celebrating his new dream job instead.\n\n\nBlair advised Starr that she was on her way to the police station. Unfortunately, Jack had informed Sam about Victor's death and the fact that Todd was the killer. Blair needed to \"light a fire\" under John in order to found out who had really killed Victor. Starr thought that Blair would need some luck, because T\u00e9a was also at the station. Blair and Starr went back into La Boulaie, and Baz and Tomas showed up right behind them.\n\n\nTomas announced that Todd was at the police station, answering questions, and Baz was curious as to how his father knew that. Tomas stated that he'd made a phone call. Tomas asked Blair about her sons, and Blair revealed that they weren't doing well. She decided that it would cheer Sam up if she bought him something at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, and Tomas offered to accompany her.\n\n\nStarr said that she would keep watch over her brothers, and Baz remained behind with her. She told him that she prayed it wasn't true that Todd had killed Victor, because she had just gotten her father back. Baz revealed that his own father had lied about his whereabouts the night of Victor's murder. Baz didn't know if Tomas had been involved in Victor's death.\n\n\nBaz explained that on the night of Victor's death, Tomas had been late in showing up for a meeting with his son, and he'd never called. Tomas had related a fake story about a flat tire and a dead phone. After he'd read about the time of Victor's death, Baz had realized that Tomas had been missing during the same hours. Tomas had looked guilty when he'd finally arrived for their meeting, Baz added.\n\n\nBaz recalled that Tomas had hated Victor, and Tomas had been angry that T\u00e9a hadn't left her husband. Tomas had also been involved with the CIA, and he'd called the police for information. Baz wondered how anyone could just make a phone call like that. He didn't trust Tomas. Starr didn't believe that Tomas had anything to do with the murder, and she while she didn't believe that Todd was involved, she was preparing herself for the worst.\n\n\nJohn asked Todd if he wanted to change his story, since Louie and the gun hadn't been found. He suggested that Todd hire a lawyer. Todd announced that Delgado would represent him, because she'd be able to prove his innocence. \"Are you kidding?\" T\u00e9a asked.\n\n\nTodd begged T\u00e9a to represent him, and T\u00e9a almost found it amusing. She wondered how it would look if the dead guy's wife represented the killer. Todd thought it would show that he was innocent, but T\u00e9a found the idea to be insane. Todd reiterated that he wouldn't have been stupid and killed Victor.\n\n\nTodd also couldn't believe that the police had been unable to locate Louie and the gun that Todd had given him to turn in for cash. Louie didn't have money to go somewhere else, Todd insisted. Todd knew that the gun would prove Todd was innocent or perhaps John should locate the real killer, Todd pointed out. Todd thought he was being railroaded.\n\n\nJohn was adamant that he was conducting the investigation \"by the book,\" and he was looking into other suspects. He noted that Todd had had the motive, means, and opportunity to kill Victor. Todd stressed that the most important thing to him was his kids, and he would never have done anything to lose them. If he had killed Victor, then Starr's heart would have been broken, and Dani and Jack would have hated him.\n\n\nTodd wanted to get to know Dani. He added that he had a granddaughter, and Jack was in a bad way. His family needed him. He turned to T\u00e9a and again pleaded that she take his case. He offered to give her five million dollars. \"Is that supposed to be funny?\" T\u00e9a asked. \"Kind of,\" Todd replied. He suggested that T\u00e9a represent him for their daughter.\n\n\nTodd's suggestion angered T\u00e9a, and she ordered him to never use their daughter to manipulate her. T\u00e9a would never defend Todd in order to get him off for killing her husband. T\u00e9a advised John that quite the contrary, she would do everything in her power to help convict Todd, and she wanted John to be certain to contact her if he needed anything. She hoped to see Todd rot.\n\n\nAmused, John suggested that Todd might want to find himself another lawyer. Todd asked if John were charging him with a crime. John acknowledged that he wasn't arresting Todd. He warned Todd not to leave town. \"Everything I have is here,\" Todd replied.\n\n\nVictor's secretary had news on Victor's murder, but it was sensitive news, and she wanted privacy. Heading into John's office, Natalie was shocked to hear Victor's secretary state that Brody had threatened Victor. She attempted to clarify what the woman had said, and she wondered if it really had anything to do with Victor's murder. The secretary tried to leave. The young woman noted that she knew how it was with cops, and they would stick together.\n\n\nNatalie begged the secretary to stay, and she assured the woman that whatever she had to say would be taken seriously. She wanted the woman to provide some details. The woman, who identified herself as Tracey, reported that Brody had burst into the office, so she had decided she would eavesdrop by the door. When Tracey had heard Brody and Victor arguing, she had actually walked into the office, sight unseen.\n\n\nBrody had been furious, and he had threatened to kill Victor. Natalie wondered exactly what Tracey had heard Brody say. \"You're a dead man if you destroy what I have,\" Tracey replied. Tracey assumed that had been a death threat. Natalie promised that someone would look into it.\n\n\nOnce she was alone, Natalie muttered to herself. \"Why? What could Victor destroy of yours?\" she wondered. \"Natalie. Something wrong?\" John asked as he walked into his office. Natalie was startled, and she asked John if Todd had been arrested. John replied that he hadn't had enough to hold Todd, but he felt that Todd would have been stupid to kill Victor. He was aware that Todd had been stupid in the past, but Victor had had many enemies.\n\n\nJohn asked Natalie again if something were going on. He could tell that something was bothering her. Natalie assured him that it wasn't a big deal, and she believed that her uncle's murder had affected her more than originally realized. John urged her to finish up and get home to her son. Natalie was distracted as she walked out.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Ford wondered what was going on between Jessica and Cristian. Emphatically, Jessica advised him that it wasn't any of his business, and the only reason for his presence should have been regarding Ryder. \"Tell Tess to leave me alone,\" Ford demanded. Jessica was anxious, and inquired where Ford had seen Tess. He admitted that he'd seen her at the diner, though not actually, he added. It had seemed as though Tess were trying to get out.\n\n\nJessica assured him that it wasn't happening, and Tess hadn't been out. Ford agreed that it had probably just been him, though it had felt real. Ford swore that he wasn't there to force Tess to return. He advised Jessica that he'd made arrangements for his mother to pick up and return Ryder for all visits. Jessica would never have to see him again. He turned to leave.\n\n\n\"Ford, wait, I changed my mind\" Jessica called out. He asked what she'd changed her mind about, and Jessica declared that there were several things.\n\n\nFirst of all, she was not involved with Cristian, and they'd only been talking about high school and how intense things had been. She wasn't planning on getting together with Cristian. Secondly, she assured Ford, he wouldn't have to worry about showing up. Ford could pick up their son himself, unless he was uncomfortable with that.\n\n\nFord was thrilled, and he assured Jessica that he would love it. He promised to keep his hands to himself, and Jessica declared that she believed him. Ford wanted to be friends, especially because of their son. They began to discuss future scenarios involving Ryder, like his first day at school and his first love. Ford admitted that he'd never had a first love in high school, because he'd been a \"scrawny, underfed runt.\"\n\n\nFord explained that he'd begun to work out in college. \"So you never had a first love,\" Jessica declared. \"I didn't say that,\" Ford replied hastily. He confessed that he was a dog who just liked to score, but Langston had been the person to change him. He pointed out that he'd done something horrid to Jessica, but she reminded him that they had their son.\n\n\nFord had believed that he'd loved Langston, but he really hadn't. His first love had been Tess. Jessica was sorry to hear that, and she couldn't believe that Tess would have taught Ford anything. Ford disagreed, but proclaimed that as a dad, he had real love.\n\n\nJessica showed him the high school letter that Cristian had written. She was sorry that Ford didn't have similar memories and feelings. Ford hoped that they could have it as adults, and they each assured the other that it would happen again, once the heartbreak was over.\n\n\nThe moment was awkward. \"Thanks for being a friend,\" Ford said as he headed to the door. \"You too,\" Jessica said quietly. She began to read out loud from her letter. \"I ne'er was struck before that hour...\"\n\n\nBlair and Tomas arrived at the caf\u00e9, but Blair was hesitant to go inside. She wanted to collect herself. She blamed herself for Victor's death, because she'd been the one to mention Dorian's gun to Todd. Tomas was certain that it all had nothing to do with Blair.\n\n\nBefore the couple could go into the caf\u00e9, T\u00e9a walked up. She informed them, \"That son of a bitch tried to hire me to defend him.\" She seemed flustered and ran into the caf\u00e9. The first person she saw was Cristian.\n\n\nEveryone gathered around Cristian to wish him luck in his new venture. T\u00e9a was weepy, and Cristian was sorry that he wouldn't be there for her. Blair promised to look after T\u00e9a, who hugged Cristian and walked away quickly. Blair advised Cristian that she'd replace him at the club, but she couldn't replace his friendship. She hoped he found happiness in his new life, and he wished the same for Blair.\n\n\nBlair advised Tomas that she and Cristian had been close, and she would miss him. Tomas assured her that they all felt the same. Cristian made several phone calls to tie up loose ends, but Carlotta urged him to get going. She was teary, too, as she hugged her son. Rama was sorry that she'd been wrong about Jessica, but she knew she was right about love. She assured Cristian that he'd find it, because the right person was waiting for him.\n\n\nCristian left the diner and looked at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 sign as if to commit it to memory.\n\n\nSitting in a booth, Blair advised T\u00e9a that she owed her for the stupid fight they'd had over Blair kissing Victor. T\u00e9a figured they'd been nice to each other for a year, and they'd been due for a fight. Blair knew that Victor had loved T\u00e9a very much. T\u00e9a confided that Dani had spent the night with her, and Dani had been shaking the entire time.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked about the boys, but Blair didn't want her to worry about anything. She offered to take T\u00e9a home and assured her she'd help her through it all, even if she fell. \"I'll catch you,\" Blair promised a crying T\u00e9a.\n\n\nTomas made a phone call to an unknown person and asked that he be kept posted on the investigation.\n\n\nBaz received a phone call and spoke to someone excitedly. He advised Starr that a producer had loved their demo and thought it could be a hit. Just then, the doorbell rang, and Starr ran to answer it. It was Todd, and he was obviously happy to see his daughter.\n\n\nTodd explained that he'd tried to clear his name, though John hadn't been able to prove Todd's innocence. Lots of people hated Victor, Todd clarified. Baz introduced himself, but Todd was anxious for the young man to leave. The man obliged, and Todd announced that he had something to say to Starr.\n\n\nTodd swore he hadn't killed Victor, and he needed Starr to believe him. He wanted to know that she was on his side. He would never hurt his children. Starr assured him that she was indeed on his side and she believed that he hadn't killed Victor. She gave her father a hug.\n\n\nJohn made a call and ordered his staff to drag every body of water in order to find the gun that Todd had claimed to give to Louie. Natalie returned, and John joked that she couldn't get enough of him. Before Natalie could say anything, Baz walked in and obviously wanted privacy before he spoke to John. Natalie left, and Baz introduced himself.\n\n\nBaz wanted John to check Tomas' alibi for the night of Victor's murder. Baz was certain that his father had lied.\n\n\nCristian arrived in Barcelona and tried to find his classroom. He encountered another teacher, and she turned around to face him. They introduced themselves. Her name was Erin, and she was the English teacher. Cristian stared at the poem that Erin had been writing on the blackboard. \"I ne'er was struck before that hour...\" Cristian recognized the poem by John Clare, and Erin was impressed. Cristian stared at her intently. He admitted that she reminded him of someone that he had once known.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cristian gets a call from his employers at LU that there's a teaching opportunity that needs to be filled in Barcelona, Spain. he is reluctant to leave although his mother encourages him and both she and Rama tell him that maybe there is something \"missing\" in his life in Llanview that he will be able to find in Barcelona. Meanwhile, Jessica confirms to Robert Ford that although she is not certain about her future with a man, she and Cristian are not getting back together. Cristian was her first love many years ago when they were teenagers but it's in the past. And she reveals to Robert that she is not angry with him nor is he unwelcome to come to her home and talk to her when picking up Ryder. And they talk about \"first loves\" where he reveals that he did not have a \"life\" in high school and believes that the first time he found \"real love\" was with Tess. Hearing that, Jessica is in awe not knowing what to say or think. Meanwhile, Cristian leaves and meets his co-teacher in Barcelona. He stares at her looking stunned and declares that she \"looks like somebody he used to know\". She tells him her name is Erin. And we see that she is Erin Torpey, the actress who played Jessica when she and Cristian were teenagers. There's still the unsolved mystery of who killed Victor Lord Jr. And Todd's secretary goes to privately meet with Natalie and tells her she has a very strong suspicion that Brody could have killed Victor. Hearing that, Natalie is puzzled as to Brody's motives to do that. Sebastian also reveals to both Starr and to John McBain, that he has suspicions about his own father who could not account for his whereabouts right at the time when Victor was killed.",
