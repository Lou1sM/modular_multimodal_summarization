    "soap_central": "\nSaving Face\n\n\nBlair woke up in John's bed to find him sitting at the foot of the bed, on the phone with Officer Fish. John told Fish he wanted to meet as soon as possible. As John finished his call, Blair pulled John back into bed for more lovemaking. Afterwards, Blair and John talked about his priorities; Blair said she knew the \"Jane Doe\" case was still important to him, and John admitted that she was correct, and that the mystery still preyed on his mind. Blair said that she understood that his work often came first. She mused that at times she felt as if she didn't really know him, but insisted she understood the way his life worked. Blair said that when she was with John, she didn't dwell on the past or worry about the future, but only lived for the present, \"just now.\" Fish called John, and informed him that there was a high likelihood that the scanning program was already done processing their image. John ordered Fish to meet him at his office immediately, and rushed off to the Llanview Police Station with Blair's encouragement. Meanwhile, at John's office, the finished image of Marty was crystal clear on the computer screen. \n\n\nOutside John's office, Fish was confronted by Mayor Lowell and his flunky. Lowell wanted to know what Fish was doing there, and where the keys to John's office were. Fish made a cover story about hoping to come back to the LPD, and said he didn't have the keys; Lowell told Fish to leave, then conferred with his crony. The mayor was determined to get into John's office and get to any incriminating evidence about his activities with Lee Ramsey before John could use it. As Lowell schemed, Fish listened in from the adjoining corridor. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina struggled to open the wall safe in the drawing room, only to find that Tess had changed the combination. Tess slunk in, gloating about her triumph, and told \"Auntie T\" that she would have to keep her mouth shut about Tess's plans for Natalie if she ever wanted to retrieve the crown jewels. Tina demanded to know what Tess had planned for Natalie, and asked Tess how she could do such terrible things to her sister. Tess snapped that Natalie was not her sister, and said Jared and Natalie would get what they deserved for what they'd done to Nash and the Brennan family. \n\n\nFed up, Tina rushed to a phone to call an old friend-Bo. She said she was going to end Tess's charade. Tess reminded Tina that she had skeletons in her closet, as well, and promised that if Tess went down, Tina would, too. She also warned Tina that if the world knew Tina had the jewels, nothing would stop Carlo, Jonas, and others from coming after Sarah to get to Tina. Frightened for Sarah, Tina relented and put the phone down. She asked if Tess was going to kill Natalie. Tess said Natalie would wish she was dead, and that she and Jared would learn what it was like to have love torn away from them. \"That bitch broke my heart,\" Tess said, \"and I'm gonna break her. Totally.\" She ordered Tina to stop asking about her plans and to forget what she'd seen, then flounced out to see to Natalie. Anguished, Tina took an old picture of herself and Viki off Viki's desk and spoke to it, apologizing for being such a terrible sister, castigating herself for her dirty deals. She said she was forced to choose between being a good sister and putting Sarah's life in danger. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd greeted Marty with breakfast in bed. Marty was touched, and told Todd she'd dreamed of him the night before. Todd assumed it had to be a nightmare, but Marty said it had been a good dream, one of their future. Marty mused that it had seemed too good to be true, and wondered if Todd's plans for them to move away and start a family with his grandchild weren't just a fantasy. Todd insisted his plan could work, but Marty said that taking on a child was already a huge responsibility, and \"we don't know what we are to each other.\" Todd said they could figure that out one day at a time. \n\n\nTodd presented Marty with a gift: A piano book, and a large electronic piano. He explained to Marty that she had once been a piano prodigy, and had taught his niece, Jessica. He hoped that by providing her with the tools, Marty would be able to recover innate \"muscle memory\" of how to play the piano, using it as \"occupational therapy.\" Hesitant, Marty tried it, and was overjoyed to find that she did indeed remember how to play. After playing \"Fur Elise,\" Marty urged Todd to sit on the bed beside her and join her in an impromptu duet. Todd was a slow study, but managed to participate by doing one half of \"Heart & Soul\" along with Marty, to Marty's delight. \n\n\nBack at John's apartment, Blair attempted to make coffee, only to find John's milk supply to be horribly past its expiration date. As she ordered breakfast by phone, she felt awkward asking for it to be delivered to John McBain's residence. When she went looking around the apartment for a pen to leave John a note about his milk, she stumbled upon a framed picture of John and Marty in his bedside drawer-unbeknownst to her, the same picture Ramsey had given the amnesiac Marty. Unsettled by her discovery, Blair tried to shrug it off as she wrote her note to John and closed the drawer, writing to John that it was time for him to replace his milk: \"out with the old, in with the new.\" \n\n\nAt the LPD station, Bo returned to work, proudly restoring fallen police officer John Perry's plaque to its place on the wall outside his office. As Bo settled in behind his desk, Antonio and Talia rushed in to congratulate the \"Commish\" on his return. Bo thanked them for their well-wishes, but said he was eager to have them both return to work as well, and asked them to fill him in on the \"long story\" behind their \"summer hiatus.\" As Antonio and Talia recounted the Mendorra caper with Tina and Carlo, Bo did his best to take the new information in stride. Talia apologized for not telling the LPD the truth about her parentage when she came to town, but said she hadn't wanted to be judged by her diabolical father and what he stood for. Bo assured Talia that he could understand what it was like to grapple with the legacy of a domineering parent, as could Antonio, and happily reinstated her to the police force. He was pleased to have both Antonio and Talia back on the job. \n\n\nJohn met Fish outside his office, where Fish warned him that Mayor Lowell had been prowling around trying to get inside. Worried, John rushed in, only to find Lowell already there, sitting behind John's desk-in front of the computer, and the finished image of Marty, which only Lowell could see. Lowell had gotten a master key from an on-duty officer, and harangued John for wasting taxpayer dollars on a closed investigation that he had been ordered to abandon by the Commonwealth. John shot back that Lowell was only trying to cover his and Ramsey's tracks. Furious, Lowell slammed the laptop closed, shutting it down without the image being saved to the hard drive. Lowell and his men confiscated the computer and John's files and stormed out. John and Fish were infuriated that they had come so close to discovering \"Jane Doe,\" only to be stymied again. Fish told John that Mayor Lowell had to have seen the finished image, and not wanted anyone else to. \n\n\nBack in Bo's office, the trio of cops was wrapping up their meeting when Sarah rushed in, screaming to Bo that something had happened to Cristian. Sarah explained to the others that Cristian had yet to arrive home from his later flight despite it being a day later. Bo dispatched Antonio and Talia to check all possible leads, but they continued to come up with no sign of Cristian at any airports. Antonio and Bo both feared that Carlo could be behind Cris's disappearance. Just then, John entered to speak to Bo. Bo told John that Cristian was missing, and they could use his help. \n\n\nIn Colombia, Jared arrived at his destination, entering a darkened building. He called Natalie multiple times, only to receive her voicemail over and over. Finally, he left a message, fearing that she was screening her calls and avoiding him. He begged Natalie to try to understand why he was doing Clint's bidding, and said he had to make things right for the Buchanans and the business so that the family could forgive Natalie. He told Natalie that he loved her, and hung up. Alone with his thoughts, Jared flashed back to his goodbye with Natalie at the airport, where he'd told her not to get any ideas about disappearing on him. \n\n\nIn the basement below Llanfair, in Tess's secret room, Natalie awoke to find herself trapped in an unfamiliar place. Wondering where she was, she tried the door, only to find it locked. Screaming for help, she had no idea that the room was soundproofed. She reviewed her memories but found that the last thing she could recall was having tea with \"Jessica.\" Natalie tried another door and found a bathroom, where she discovered a gift-wrapped present addressed to her. Returning to the main room, Natalie unwrapped the present, a large scrapbook labeled \"Memories.\" As Natalie flipped through the strange book, she found it was full of newspaper clippings relating to her rocky history in Llanview, as well as Jared's, focusing on his Buchanan scam and the downfall of Buchanan Enterprises. \n\n\nTowards the end of the scrapbook the pages began to fill with disturbing homemade images, such as Jared and Natalie's pictures with a heart drawn around them, and a dagger plunged through the center. The final image was of Nash's bloodied body on the ground after his fall at the BE shareholders' meeting. Horrified, Natalie flung the scrapbook aside, and looked up to see Tess watching her from behind the glass wall. Natalie rushed to the glass, begging \"Jessica\" to let her out. Tess expressed disappointment that Natalie didn't like her \"present,\" which she'd worked hard on. Natalie was horrified as she finally realized that \"Jessica\" wasn't Jessica...she was Tess. \n\n\n",
