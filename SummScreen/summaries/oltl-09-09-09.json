He mentioned how futile his attempts to reach Blair had been, and said he had only been able to leave her messages. T\u00e9a talked him out of heading to the police station and convinced him  to stay home and wait for a call from Sergei instead.  Unbeknownst to the couple, Blair and Ross had just arrived from the airport and were outside of the house. Ross was unhappy to learn that Blair wanted him to stay hidden in the cabana. He reminded her of the deal they had-- that Blair would drop all charges against him in exchange for his return to the United States.\n\n\nBlair informed him that she had a new deal and that she would not drop those charges until Ross did what she had taken him to Llanview to do, which was to expose T\u00e9a. She knew that Todd would be crazed to learn that T\u00e9a had been hiding her marriage to Ross. Blair wondered if Ross would prefer jail over the cabana. Sighing, Ross agreed to remain out of sight, but he demanded to be fed first. Blair retorted that her first plan of action was to check on her kids.\n\n\nStepping into the house, a sarcastic Blair wanted to know why T\u00e9a was there. When a bruised Todd limped  down the stairs, he announced that he had bad news for his former wife. and had been trying to reach her. Blair stuck to her story of being on a business trip and having a phone that needed recharging. Filling her in on the results of Cole's so-called community service, Todd blamed John for all that had happened. T\u00e9a felt strongly that everything would work out. Blair blamed Todd, but T\u00e9a quickly stood up for her man, pointing out that he was both beaten and shot.\n\n\nTodd pointed out that drug dealers were used to getting their way and that this time, the lawbreakers included the mayor. A suddenly forgiving Blair put her arms around her former husband to comfort him. Having a need to hear the latest at the police station, Blair asked Todd to accompany her. In turn, he requested that T\u00e9a stay behind in case Sergei called. Ross, hiding behind the bushes, looked into the study and saw some fruit on the table. Heading through the open doors, he noisily removed several pieces of the fruit.\n\n\nAt the police station, Marty did her best to reassure Cole that Starr and Hope would be safe, as he continued to blame himself for the girls' kidnapping. When Asher was led into the station in handcuffs, Cole attacked him immediately, grabbing Asher's shirt close to his throat. He demanded to know where Starr and Hope were. Asher told him they should work together and remain quiet. As Cole became louder and more violent, nearby officers rushed over to separate the boys.\n\n\nJohn put Brody back on the case, confident that Brody's training as a Navy SEAL would be of great use. As they worked on a plan, not knowing the layout of the warehouse, Sergei called. He threatened to kill his hostages if his plane was not ready, and he was annoyed when Bo informed him that it was being prepped. Sergei noted that the clock was ticking. He also mentioned obtaining food for the baby, which confused Bo and John. They wondered how someone could have been out and back into the warehouse without being seen.\n\n\nBrody left, and  John pulled Asher into hiss office and questioned the boy . Asher claimed he didn't know anything about the kidnapping or the area where the drug dealers were hiding out. When Fish noted that Asher had been picked up in that very area as he was heading to the warehouses, Asher retorted that he had just been hanging out there. John advised him that Lowell was in prison and would not be able to help him like he did previously. Asher pressed his lips together firmly, stating that he would not comment any further without a lawyer.\n\n\nSummoning Brody back into the office, John and Bo made sure the blinds in the office were closed. As John noted that Brody's testimony would put Asher away, Brody grabbed Asher's shirt, lifted him out of his seat and growled at the boy that Starr and her baby had been taken. John calmed Brody down and sent him out of the office. He suggested that Brody didn't like Asher very much. Asher was sufficiently shaken to agree to divulge when he knew.\n\n\nShaun's parents waited for word on their son at the hospital, as Rachel praised Shaun for being a hero and told them what she knew of his shooting. They admitted to always being proud of Greg, but never realizing how proud they were of Shaun, too. Destiny appreciated Matthew waiting with her, and he assured her that he wanted to return the favor. Greg received updates on his brother's condition and asked to have more tests run. The doctor in charge suggested that they wait on the tests, as Shaun had an uphill battle to endure first.\n\n\nGreg entered Shaun's room and spoke to his unconscious brother. Suddenly, Shaun awoke, but his primary concern was for Starr and Hope, not himself. Out in the waiting area, Rachel learned that Shaun had told his parents all about her, and they seemed thrilled. When Greg announced that Shaun was awake, Mr. and Mrs. Evans and Destiny headed for his room. Rachel graciously maintained that the family members should go first. Destiny praised Shaun as a hero and vowed to be nicer to him in the future. Greg remained with Rachel. She told him that she had been on her way to break up with Shaun at the time of the shooting. He admitted to telling his friend, Vivian, that Shaun didn't understand Rachel.\n\n\nRachel finally went into Shaun's room. He apologized for missing their date, and she began to cry. He promised to get better for her soon and vowed they would have the date they had missed. Greg informed his family that Shaun had been shot in the chest and neck, but that his condition was stable and his recovery was promising. Matthew learned that Destiny had told her parents all about him.\n\n\nRex and Gigi were annoyed that Stacy had attempted to cancel out of another doctor's appointment, which caused Gigi to be suspicious. She was certain that her sister was stalling and she was starting to believe that Stacy wasn't really pregnant. Rex reminded her that he had been with Stacy every step of the way during her blood test. He vowed that he would get Stacy to the doctor. Gigi suspected that Stacy was merely afraid of having the paternity test.\n\n\nFrantically, Stacy informed Kim that Rex was forcing her to go to the doctor. Kim calmly handed her a home pregnancy test for early results, suggesting that she use it immediately. Stacy might very well be carrying Fish's baby, she reminded her best friend. Once the test was taken, an anxious Stacy waited for the outcome.\n\n\nDisappointed when the test did not reveal a pregnancy, Stacy sadly admitted that she had lost Rex and would never get him back. Just then, Gigi and Rex arrived, with Rex bursting through the door. As Kim pushed him out, Rex sarcastically advised Kim that the place was his. Kim informed him that Stacy wasn't dressed, and she kept him by the door as she and Gigi traded insults. Informing the couple that she'd let them know when Stacy was ready, Kim headed back inside. Gigi felt sure that the other women were up to something.\n\n\nAs Rex and Gigi waited for Stacy, Rex thanked Gigi for accompanying him to the doctor. Inside, Kim urged Stacy to \"think outside the box.\" She suggested that when the doctor advised Stacy that the baby had been lost, Stacy should act surprised. Rex would probably comfort her. Gigi, tired of waiting, entered the loft. She spied Kim throwing something away. Stacy informed her sister that she was not welcome to attend the doctor's appointment with them, but she wanted Kim to go along instead, or she would make a stop for cigarettes and alcohol. Rex was furious, but Gigi assured him that she was fine.\n\n\nCole admitted to his mom that he was sorry he had worked undercover. Todd arrived at the same time and overheard Cole. He snarled that he was sorry that Cole had done it, also. Cooperating with the authorities, Asher pointed out different aspects of the warehouse. He revealed that there was a secret trap door in the basement, which led to the river. He explained that it was how drugs were delivered. He swore he didn't know about the kidnapping. Ordering Asher to a cell, John planned the police attack. Brody volunteered to handle it alone, advising John that he would notify John when Starr and Hope were safe.\n\n\nSergei called again, and Bo advised him that the plane was almost ready. Sergei refused to allow Bo to speak with Starr as the police commissioner requested. Bo asked that one hostage, the baby, be released. Sergei declined, and refused to let Bo stall any longer. Bo assured him they had the plane and were obtaining the money. An annoyed Sergei was heard saying \"Give me the baby.\" Suddenly, there was a gunshot.\n\n\nOnce everyone left for the doctor, Gigi let herself back into Rex's loft. She headed straight for the trashcan and pulled out the box from the home pregnancy test.\n\n\nAs Greg scrutinized Shaun's x-rays, he was confident that everything was looking good. Suddenly, he gasped. There was a bullet fragment next to the brain stem, which could prove dangerous if it ever moved.\n\n\nHearing noise in the study, T\u00e9a entered and looked around. Seeing nothing but the wide open doors, she walked outside and called out. As Ross remained hidden behind the bushes, an uneasy T\u00e9a twisted her engagement ring. She appeared confused but turned and went back inside, closing the doors behind her. \"You'll see me soon enough,\" Ross uttered.\n\n\nTodd, Marty, and Blair argued over who should be blamed for the predicament they found themselves in. Marty insisted that John be allowed to do his job.\n\n\n",
