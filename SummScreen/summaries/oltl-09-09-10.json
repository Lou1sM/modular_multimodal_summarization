Marty assured him that he had given T\u00e9a the best care possible, and that there was nothing else he could have done. Greg countered that there was something else he could have done. Greg confessed that T\u00e9a had changed her mind about wanting her family by her side, buy Greg hadn't been able to make it happen. Someone else \"didn't want it to happen,\" and he was just following orders.\n\n\nMarty wanted to know who objected and how they'd forced him, but Greg couldn't say anything else. He confided that people he loved would get hurt. He also knew that Marty would be obligated to report certain things. Giving him a strange look, Marty said she could only report someone planning a murder, or someone who knew of a murder plan.\n\n\nGreg looked at the text on his phone that said, \"don't say another word,\" and decided that he couldn't say anything else to Marty. Marty didn't know what was going on, but advised Greg to be careful. As Greg left Marty's office, his phone rang. He answered it, asking who it was on the other end, and got very upset.\n\n\nAt the police station, Inez offered lunch to Bo as a peace offering. She hadn't realized that Bo hiring her would cause such problems between Bo and Matthew. Clint entered and asked Bo why he'd been called in. The two went into Bo's office, and Bo wondered why Clint would offer Matthew a job without consulting Bo and Nora first. Clint said that it was his way of making amends for all that had happened between them. Bo wasn't happy about it, but he would let Matthew take the job as long as his grades weren't affected.\n\n\nOn the way out of Bo's office, Clint noticed Inez's small salad. He offered to take her to the Palace, where they had big, good salads. He said he'd give her a call and left. Bo apologized for his brother hitting on her, but she thought Clint just felt bad for her. Bo asked Inez if the DNA results on Eli were back yet, but they weren't.\n\n\nAt school, Nate couldn't believe that Dani had shown up. Dani imagined her mother saying that the only good excuse for missing school was a fever over one hundred. Nate thought T\u00e9a would be proud of Dani and kissed her. Matthew saw, but proceeded to practice for the basketball tryouts. Destiny interrupted Matthew and told him not to go to the dark side, making Matthew take notice of Nate. Matthew assured her that Nate had nothing to worry about.\n\n\nNate walked over and started shooting at the same hoop as Matthew, who wondered why Nate picked the same sport to do as Matthew. Nate explained that it would look good on his college applications and asked why Matthew thought everything was about him. Matthew informed Nate that he would make Nate regret signing up to try out. The two began to play one-on-one.\n\n\nThe tryouts began, and Matthew and Nate were on opposite teams for a scrimmage. A smug Matthew shoved Nate. As Matthew deliberately tripped Nate, Destiny told Darren Matthew was playing dirty, and that she could see why Dani chose Nate. As Matthew and Nate took their places next to each other for a foul shot, Matthew said Dani wanted to have sex with him. Nate pushed Matthew, who fell, and yelled about his leg. Matthew claimed that Nate had pushed him out of nowhere, so the coach benched Nate. Clint looked on, pleased.\n\n\nAfter the tryout, Matthew wondered how long Clint had been there. Clint had seen what Matthew had done to Nate and thought that Matthew had \"killer instincts.\" On the other side of the gym, Nate told Destiny that he shouldn't have lost it, but Destiny thought Nate did the right thing. Destiny wondered what Matthew had said to Nate, but Nate said it didn't matter.\n\n\nIn an exam room at the hospital, Natalie and John were excited about what the future held for their child. They wondered what their baby would be like, but Natalie just wanted a baby like John.\n\n\nDown the hall, Jess thought about Brody's reaction when he found out that the baby might not be his. She walked out of the exam room, crying, and dropped her ultrasound picture.\n\n\nExiting the exam room, Natalie found Jess's ultrasound picture and saw Jess crying. Jess assured a questioning Natalie that the baby was all right. John left to go to work and left Natalie to talk to her sister. Jess told her sister that her baby might not be Brody's. Jess told Natalie the story about how she and Ford had slept together. She hadn't planned to tell Brody about it, but he had seemed so happy when he saw the ultrasound, she couldn't lie anymore.\n\n\nJess thought that it might tear her and Brody apart, but Natalie assured her that things would work out. Natalie blamed Ford and asked Jess what would happen if it turned out to be Ford's baby. Jess thought that Brody would try to love the baby, but she wasn't sure if they could work through it. Natalie was confident that they could get past it and told Jess to have faith. Jess left to find Brody. At Llanview University, Brody beat Ford up, as Langston demanded to know what was going on. She ran to get security. Langston returned with a security guard, who asked what was going on. \"Ask Jessica,\" Brody replied.\n\n\nBrody enlightened Langston about what had happened between Ford and Jessica. Langston wondered where Ford had fit sleeping with Jessica in, \"before or after Karen? And me?\" Ford told her that she didn't know the whole story, but she didn't want to. Brody threatened to charge Ford with statutory rape. Ford assured Brody that Jess loved Brody, that they would all get past it, and that he was sorry. He tried to convince Langston that he had been a different person then, and that he was trying to change, but Langston said it was too late. \"Hear me out,\" Ford pleaded.\n\n\nLangston blasted Ford, asking if he intended to punish the entire female population for his mother walking out on him. Ford promised that, if he had the chance, he wouldn't make the same choice. He implored her to not let Brody spoil the fact that she was starting to believe in him. Langston wanted to thank Brody for reminding her of what kind of guy Ford was. She left Ford to nurse his wounds. Jess entered and saw Ford. She knew Brody had found him. \"You just missed him,\" Ford informed her.\n\n\nBrody entered the hospital and found Natalie. He asked where Jessica was. Natalie informed Brody that Jess had told her everything, and that Jess had gone to find him. A very angry Brody ranted to Natalie about how the baby was \"supposed to be\" his.\n\n\nTodd put the urn with T\u00e9a's ashes on the desk, wondering if it was really her. Dani walked in and saw it, becoming upset. Todd told Dani about Greg's visit, and how T\u00e9a had changed her mind about having her family with her. Dani angrily asked why they hadn't been there. Dani had known her mother would change her mind. She wished Greg would \"go to hell,\" which Todd seconded. The doorbell rang, and Todd answered it to John.\n\n\nJohn offered his condolences to Todd and Dani and sang T\u00e9a's praises. Dani thanked John and went back into the living room. Listening in, she heard John ask if Dani had heard from Ross. She hadn't, but Todd would let John know if Ross got in contact with Dani. Todd asked if John thought that the brothers had teamed up. John said there was no evidence of it and left.\n\n\nDani asked if John had said something about Ross. She had been thinking about him and thought he deserved to know that T\u00e9a had died. Todd warned her to steer clear of Ross. Changing the subject, Dani asked what they should do with T\u00e9a's ashes. Todd told her that, if she knew what T\u00e9a wanted done with her remains, she should tell him. As she wished her mom wanted her ashes to be in Tahiti, she received a text message that said, \"I'm coming for you.\" Todd asked whom it was from, but Dani lied and said that it was from Nate checking on her.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the police station and asked Bo if anything had arrived from Tahiti. Bo wondered if John knew something that Bo didn't. Bo asked if John thought Eli and Ross were working together. John told him that there was always a connection between brothers. Bo asked if John thought Eli was still alive. John only said that he needed the DNA results \"now.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John and Bo have not yet gotten the DNA evidence to confirm Elijah Clark's death. Clint goes to talk to Bo about whether Bo approves of Matthew working with his uncle at B.E. Bo reluctantly agrees to let his son take the job. Bo notices Clint acting uncharacteristically friendly toward Inez and asks if his brother was \"hitting\" on her. Yet, Clint knows that her son is the boy whom Matthew has competitive and \"killer instincts\" toward since Nate took Matthew's girlfriend from him. Meanwhile, both boys are trying out for varsity basketball at the high school. Matthew is trying everything to defeat and be nasty to Nate. Clint goes to observe and tells his nephew he knows what he's doing but he need not justify himself for it. Meanwhile, Dani and Todd are wondering what to do about Tea's death. Dani then gets an anonymous text from an unknown caller. Greg goes to talk to Marty in an attempt to \"confess a secret,\" but he gets an anonymous call from what looks to be the same source. John goes to ask Todd and Dani if they have heard from Ross Rayburn knowing that he's still alive and may want to see them after his brother's untimely death. Yet, John later concludes to Bo that there is no confirmation that Eli is even dead, so maybe they should not assume it. After Jessica confesses to Brody that she slept with Robert Ford and he may be the father of her baby, Brody goes to LU and is ready to physically hurt Robert. Langston overhears them and finds out what Robert did to Jessica during her prom night when she was ill. Jessica realizes she may be pregnant by him and concludes that she will never forgive Robert or trust him after that.",
