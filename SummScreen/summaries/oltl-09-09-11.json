Nigel then admitted Kim inside Llanfair but refused to allow her to see Clint, who was reading a newspaper article about Victor Lord's murder.  When Nigel refused to let Clint see Kim as a guest, Kim pointed out that she was family.  Once Kim stressed that she and Clint had bonded, Nigel noted that they had bonded as a tapeworm does to its host.\n\n\nClint welcomed Kim into the living room, and Kim ordered Nigel to serve her breakfast.  After Kim indicated that she would have her usual, Nigel quipped that Kim would want \"fresh blood and babies' tears.\"  Later, as Nigel carried in a tray, Kim raved over Nigel's scones.  Nigel remarked that he was British, and that he also had a talent for beheadings.  Clint requested that Nigel attend the flea market to add to Nigel's antique button collection.  Kim insisted that she would take care of Clint.  As Nigel left, he reminded Clint that he was only a phone call away.\n\n\nClint told Kim that Nigel was protective of the family, and then Clint wondered what Kim was after.  Kim revealed that she had been working double shifts to pay for the medical expenses of a sick friend.  Clint wished that he could write Kim a check, instead of Kim having to strip for the money.  Kim then stated that she needed Clint's advice about how to invest money.  Kim indicated that she had lied to the collection agency, and that she had actually saved for a rainy day.  Kim said that she needed more money, before her friend just withered away.\n\n\nKim feared that her friend was fading away, and that the hospital would cut her friend loose, if Kim could not pay.  Clint remembered how Kim had once wanted to help her friend, Stacy, when Stacy had still been alive.  Clint told Kim that he would help her on the condition that Kim did not return to the Spotted Pony or any other strip club.  Clint stressed that Kim was too good for that.\n\n\nKim got up to leave and informed Clint that she needed to find a place to stay.  Kim also wanted to leave on her own, before Nigel threw her out.  Clint said that he would get started on her investment portfolio, and that Kim would always be welcome at Llanfair.  Kim acknowledged that Clint was the best -- at everything.\n\n\nAt the flea market, Echo held a bag containing Rex's gun and realized that a bullet was missing from the gun.  Echo ran into Roxy, who held \"a primo position\" for a booth at flea market day.  When Echo noticed that Roxy's front desk clerk, Morris, who was a large stuffed porcupine, was for sale, Roxy showed Morris's secret hiding place to Echo.  Roxy saw that Echo was trying to hide something in the bag and stated that she would sell the thing in the bag, if Echo would buy Morris for 100 dollars.  Roxy and Echo wrestled with the bag, and the gun fell out.\n\n\nRoxy yelled that she had zero tolerance for weapons in her hood and then wondered why Echo had a nine-millimeter gun.  Roxy also recollected that Victor Lord had been killed with a nine-millimeter.  Echo remarked that she had not killed Victor, but that Rex had.  Echo reflected that Rex had taken the gun to the movie premiere to kill Victor but had then changed his mind.  Echo claimed that Rex had denied shooting Victor, and that Rex had said that he had been at Gigi's grave the night of the murder, but Echo had found that the gun had been fired.\n\n\nEcho knew that Rex had been obsessed with wanting Victor dead.  When Echo announced that she would find a better place to dispose of the gun, Roxy stated that she would get rid of it.  Roxy said, \"Just stay.  Just watch my stuff.  Don't discount any lower than 10%, okay?  That's it.\"  Nigel then arrived and asked what Roxy had for him.  To distract Nigel, Echo showed him the collection of buttons, and Nigel asked Roxy where she had gotten her treasure.  Roxy answered, \"If I tell you, then you'll never come back.  You know, some things have to remain a secret.\"\n\n\nAt the Minute Man Hotel, Cutter and Aubrey lay in bed, and Cutter jumped up to get ready for work.  Cutter schemed to move up into the manager position, because he believed it would be available with the use of well-placed bed bugs.  Cutter remarked that he and his sister, Aubrey, had done that scam in the past.  Aubrey leafed through the yearbook to learn more about the original Aubrey.  After Cutter claimed that he tried not to think about his sister, Aubrey remembered that Rama had found the original Aubrey at the Spotted Pony, after Aubrey had stolen Rama's money.\n\n\nAubrey wondered what Cutter was hiding and what he and his sister had done at the Spotted Pony.  Aubrey felt that Cutter and Rama were keeping something from her.  Cutter then admitted that he had done some things in the past that he was not proud of, and that some of those things had taken place at the Spotted Pony.  Cutter informed Aubrey that his sister had used Rama's money to improve her looks, so she could score money off of men.  Once the men caught on to her, Cutter and his sister had parted ways.  Cutter envisioned in his mind that his sister had shown him a picture of her and Stacy.\n\n\nCutter showed Aubrey a box of the lost and found items from the hotel, and Aubrey regretted that they had lost all of the luxury items from their fancier way of life.  However, Cutter stated that at least they had each other, and he kissed her.  After Cutter left, Aubrey looked at the picture of the original Aubrey in the yearbook and wondered aloud what had ever happened to her.  Aubrey heard a knock on the door and opened it to find Kim.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Nigel returned from the flea market with his hands full of bags.  Clint revealed that Kim had left, and Nigel was relieved.  Then Clint added that Kim had left -- after she had agreed to marry him.  Clint admitted that he was joking and said that Kim had returned to get help for a sick friend.  Clint claimed that Kim knew that Clint had no money.  After Clint insisted that Kim was being loyal to her sick friend, he said to Nigel, \"You know, the two of you have more in common than you think.\"\n\n\nIn the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, as Brody and Natalie sat in a booth, Natalie declared that Victor's secretary had information that she had overheard Brody threaten Victor's life on the day of the murder.  After Natalie asked if the secretary's story was true, Brody revealed that he had gone to see Victor about what was on Marty's tape.  Brody indicated that he had wanted to know what Victor had known about the tape, but that Victor had denied knowing anything about it.\n\n\nBrody felt that the secretary had been exaggerating, but he then noted that he had gotten into Victor's face, because Victor had gloated that he had once hidden Marty at his place.  Brody admitted that he could have threatened Victor and said that Victor was a dead man, but that he had not meant it.  Natalie guessed that John would have questions for Brody, and she wished that they had the murder weapon.\n\n\nTo settle the matter, Brody took out his gun and asked Natalie to test it.  Brody told Natalie to send the gun to ballistics, but Natalie refused to do it.  Natalie knew that Brody would not lie to her.  Natalie then exclaimed that they needed to find Victor's killer.  When Natalie said that she would be working the case that morning, Brody felt that the case would break open.  Brody indicated that he would be glad when it was all over.\n\n\nAt the police station, when John questioned Tomas about his alibi for the night of Victor's murder, Tomas indicated that he had been with his son.  John revealed that he had already talked to Baz, and that Baz's story had been quite different from what Tomas had indicated.  Tomas was upset that John had questioned Baz without telling Tomas, but John indicated that Baz was not a suspect.  John stated that, in fact, Baz had traveled to the police station to talk to John.\n\n\nJohn again wondered about Tomas' story of blowing out a tire so badly that it had knocked out the service of his cell phone for several hours.  John then asked Tomas if he wanted to revise his story, but Tomas chose to stick with it.  John speculated that the blown tire must have messed up his alignment.  Tomas then revealed that he had run into Sebastian at the diner, and that Baz was upset with Tomas, because Baz thought Tomas had been avoiding him.  Tomas was supposed to have met Baz at Capricorn to listen to some new tracks.\n\n\nJohn announced that a phone call from a fellow police officer, who had checked out Tomas' car, had revealed that it had no new tires.  Tomas maintained that he had not killed Victor Lord, because his sister and his niece had love Victor, and Tomas did not want to lose his entire family.  Tomas reminded John that Victor had a list of many enemies.  As he handed John the associate's card, Tomas declared that he had spent time with an associate, and that they had been searching for a legitimate way to take out Victor.  Tomas revealed that the associate's name was Calmar, and Tomas stressed that he did not own a nine-millimeter gun.\n\n\nStarr answered the door at La Boulaie and found Baz.  She informed him that she was getting pictures ready for the memorial.  After Starr said that she hoped for an arrest, Baz indicated that he suspected his dad's story about a flat tire.  Baz then stated that Victor's murderer could have either been his dad or Starr's.\n\n\nWhen Starr stated that she needed to get ready, Baz announced that a producer wanted to talk to them about their new single.  Starr asked that Baz meet with the producer and insisted that she knew that Baz would not give their song to some hack, as Rick flew through the door.  Rick declared that Starr and Baz were pop stars, and that they looked hot together.  When Starr asked how Rick had found them, Rick revealed that everyone knew about La Boulaie.\n\n\nAfter Starr and Baz questioned how Rick was involved with the music industry, Rick exclaimed that he had worked with the scores of movies, that he knew music and marketing, and that the label trusted his instincts.  Rick then mentioned that he needed to make a note to self about a music spin-off.  When Starr stressed that she would never work with scum like Rick, he declared, \"I'm it.  But, hey, I am sure there are a lot of producers that will love to work with artists with no following and lots of attitude.\"\n\n\nStarr insisted that she and Baz would take their chances, and Rick sent his private number to Baz's phone.  After Rick flew out, Baz mentioned that they could write up a contract that would keep Rick away from them.  However, Baz noted that Rick Powers was probably the only chance for their song.  Starr then answered the door to Tomas, who wondered if Baz had expected him to be in jail.  After Tomas and Baz left to have a talk, Starr looked at a picture of herself, Victor, and Hope and commented that there were things she still had to do.  Starr sighed.\n\n\nRick arrived at the flea market, and Cutter held out money that he had received for the box of lost and found items.  Cutter wanted to buy a gift for Aubrey at the flea market.  When Echo demanded to know where Roxy had placed the gun, Roxy revealed that she had hidden it in Morris' \"hidey-hole.\"  An unseen buyer looked at Morris, as Roxy declared that she would take Morris down to the docks to get rid of the gun.\n\n\nWhen Roxy and Echo returned to Roxy's booth to get Morris, they found he was gone.  Echo yelled that they must have misplaced Morris, and Roxy cried, \"Oh, put him someplace else.  Like it's so easy to lose a big, stuffed porcupine.\"  They then discovered that a Sacagawea had been left in Morris's place.  Echo noted that whoever had Morris had the gun also.  At the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cutter gazed at Morris and said, \"Aww.  Best Sacagawea I ever spent.  Aubrey's gonna love you.\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at the police station, Shaun walked into John's office and declared that he would help John solve Victor Lord's murder.  John sat back and said, \"You have my complete attention.  What do you got?\"  Shaun replied, \"Victor Lord's murder.  I have the recording.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Sebastian informs Starr that he sent in their musical demo and got an offer from a music producer. It looks positive to both of them until Rick the porn producer walks into the house uninvited and informs them that he is their producer. They first tell him they want nothing to do with him but later realize that they don't have many options knowing how competitive the music recording business is. Tomas comes by to tell his son he knows he gave his father up to the cops. Besides Tomas and original Todd, there is also suspicion cast upon both Rex and Brody. Echo is haunted with the possibility that her son lied to her about killing Victor Lord. She takes the gun in her purse and sits alone at the flea market when Roxy catches her. She informs Roxy that they both need to protect their son. Roxy offers to hide the gun and puts it inside her stuffed porcupine. Cutter attends the flea market with \"good intention\" to buy some stuff for himself and Aubrey while still poor and purchases the porcupine unaware of what's inside of it. When Roxy and Echo discover it's gone, they freak. Natalie admits to Brody that Victor's secretary informed her that she overheard Brody making death threats and telling Victor that he cannot let him ruin Brody's life with a \"secret\", she asks him what is up with that. He is confident that she will never know the truth about Liam and shows her the gun that he has. When John is alone in his office, Shaun Evans comes by unexpectedly and tells him he thinks he can shed some light on who killed Victor Lord.",
