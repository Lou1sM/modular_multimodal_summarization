    "soap_central": "\nInmates on the Inside:\n\n\nJohn, Antonio, and Talia were at the police station, gathered in Bo's office. Bo couldn't quite wrap his mind around the fact that Talia was Carlo Hesser's daughter. Attention quickly diverted to Sarah, when she walked into her uncle's office. She was frantic because Cris had suddenly vanished. Everyone soon realized that Carlo could be involved in Cris's disappearance. Bo decided to place a call to the authorities in Mendorra. Their fears were realized when Bo was told that Carlo had managed to bribe his way out of prison. John, Antonio, and Talia decided to start their search for Cris in New York. Before they left, Antonio and Talia were reinstated to Llanview's police force. \n\n\nCris woke up from a romantic dream of Sarah, and discovered that he was chained to a wall. His captor was Carlo Hesser. Rather than show fear, Cris began taunting Carlo with how much Talia hated her father. Carlo tried to dismiss what Cris was saying, but couldn't for long. He soon grew annoyed with his prisoner and began issuing threats. Cris refused to be intimidated. He told Carlo that Talia would kill him the first opportunity she had. Carlo had had enough. He informed Cris that they were headed to Columbia, where Carlo intended to throw Cris into a prison to rot. As Carlo walked out of the room, two of his goons stepped in and began pummeling Cris. \n\n\nJared walked into the Del Plato prison in Bogota, Colombia, and was taken to a room. While Jared waited for the guards to fetch Langston's uncle, his cell phone rang. It was Clint, calling to check on Jared's progress. Jared took the opportunity to inform Clint that Langston's uncle had been convicted of murder. When he asked Clint if he wanted to reconsider their plan, Clint refused. He instructed Jared to make sure Ray Montez came to Llanview. \n\n\nAfter Jared ended his call with Clint, Ray was brought into the room. His hands were cuffed behind his back. Ray quickly guessed that Jared was an American. He demanded to know what Jared wanted. Jared broached the subject slowly. He told Ray his sister, Linda, and her husband had been killed in a car accident and left behind a daughter. When Jared told Ray about the plan for Ray to go to Llanview and petition for custody of Langston in order to force Dorian's hand, Ray refused. \n\n\nRay insisted that he be given more incentive to cooperate, than just his freedom. He wanted a big payoff from Jared, something that would make it worth playing the \"concerned\" uncle to Langston. \n\n\nStarr strolled out to the pool and found Langston working on the laptop. Langston was doing research, hoping to find her long-lost relative. Starr was concerned about Langston's search. She pointed out that there might have been a reason that Langston's mother had not talked about her family. Starr reminded Langston of Adriana's story and how Dorian had to hide her daughter's existence for her own safety. Langston appreciated Starr's concern, but she wasn't deterred from her quest. \n\n\nThe conversation then switched to Cole and his latest visit to LaBoulaie. Starr was upset when Langston told her about the incident with Karen at the country club. Langston was quick to let Starr know that she didn't have any reason to worry; Cole wasn't interested in Karen. Talk of Cole led to talk of school. Starr admitted that she was nervous about returning to school pregnant. She worried that she would be ridiculed by her peers. Langston reassured Starr that she would not be alone; Langston would be by Starr's side. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Matthew turned to Cole for advice on what to wear the first day of school. Matthew was starting his freshman year in high school and was desperate to make a good first impression. Cole didn't think Matthew had anything to worry about, but Matthew didn't believe him. He told Cole about the things he had read, posted by previous freshman, on a popular blog site. Matthew also pointed out that, as a senior, Cole was at the top of the social ladder. \n\n\nThings took a momentary uncomfortable turn when Matthew brought up Starr's name. Cole quickly dismissed Matthew's apologies, saying they were unnecessary. He told Matthew that he had to get used to hearing Starr's name and seeing her, since school was about to start. Cole then switched the topic back to Matthew. Cole let Matthew know that he would keep an eye on Matthew, to make sure no one gave him a difficult time. Matthew appeared greatly relieved. \n\n\nNatalie was stunned when she realized that Tess had returned and was the personality in control. Tess was happy to confirm Natalie's worst fears. As Tess walked Natalie through the previous few months, Natalie was shocked to learn that Tess was responsible for Viki's car accident. She was also surprised to discover that Tess had served Natalie and Jared poisoned risotto. Hope sprang eternal when Tess revealed that it was Jessica who had stopped Natalie and Jared from eating the deadly dish. Natalie warned Tess that Jessica would regain control. For the first time, Tess appeared rattled, but she quickly recovered. \n\n\nTess took delight in letting Natalie know that she intended to make Natalie suffer the same fate that Natalie and Jared had forced Tess to endure. Tess wanted Natalie to know what it felt like to live without the man she loved. Natalie feared that Tess meant she would kill Jared, but Tess told her that what she had planned was far worse than death. \n\n\nNatalie watched helplessly as Tess walked away and sealed Natalie away in her hidden prison. \n\n\nTina was plagued with guilt over her role in Tess's plot for retribution. Tina paced the living room and spoke her regrets aloud, as if she were speaking to Viki. Clint walked in and overheard Tina talking. Luckily, for Tina, Clint didn't hear anything specific. \n\n\nClint explained that he had stopped by to see Jessica. Tina lied and told him that Jessica was in the shower, hoping that Clint would leave. He didn't. Clint decided to wait for Jessica in the living room. When Tina tried to leave, Clint stalled her. He mentioned that he had spoken to Cord, who had told him that Tina was in Llanview for Sarah's sake. Tina seemed to grow increasingly nervous as the visit progressed. A few innocent comments by Clint seemed to trigger Tina's desire to confess. Just as Tina appeared to be on the verge of telling Clint about Tess and Natalie, Tess walked in. Tina froze when she saw her niece. \n\n\n",
