Upon determining that a bullet fragment was lodged near Shaun's brain stem, both men agreed than if the fragment moved one millimeter near Shaun's brain stem, Shaun might die instantly.  The doctors concurred that only a qualified neurosurgeon could perform the necessary surgery.\n\n\nInside Shaun's hospital room, as Shaun's parents fawned over Rachel, Shaun gazed up at her and exclaimed, \"I got a reason to get moving!\"   As Shaun's parents continued to refer to her as Shaun's girlfriend, an uncomfortable Rachel bolted from the room.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Rachel listened as Greg informed her of the dire situation facing Shaun.  Greg explained that any sudden movement could cause the bullet fragment to cut Shaun's brain stem and kill him.  Greg was adamant that he was the only doctor on staff who could successfully perform the surgery that Shaun needed.  When Rachel questioned if Greg was capable of being objective, Greg related that he had successfully performed the required surgery several times.\n\n\nGreg returned to Shaun's hospital room and informed Shaun, Destiny, and their parents of Shaun's condition.  Assuring his family that he was capable of performing the surgery, Greg stated that the decision was up to Shaun.  Apologizing for the separation that existed between him and his family over the years, Greg expressed his desire to save his brother's life.   As the family awaited Shaun's decision, Shaun's surgeon entered the room and related that the hospital administrators had agreed to allow Greg to perform his brother's surgery if Shaun signed a waiver relieving the hospital of any liability.  Observing Rachel through his hospital window, Shaun reached for the form and sighed, \"I can't live my life like a time bomb!\"\n\n\nBefore heading off to surgery, Shaun proclaimed his love for Rachel and promised to dazzle her on their date.  As Shaun was wheeled away, Rachel and Greg exchanged knowing looks.\n\n\nInside Stacy's examination room at the clinic, Stacy grew anxious as Rex and Kim argued.  While Rex demanded to remain in the room during Stacy's examination, Kim complained that Rex's presence would cause Stacy and her baby unnecessary stress.  After Stacy persuaded Rex to leave the room, Kim advised Stacy that unless they came up with a plan, Rex would discover that she wasn't pregnant.\n\n\nWhile waiting for the doctor, Stacy feared the doctor would discover that she had suffered a miscarriage.  As Stacy sulked over the negative results that she had received from her home pregnancy test, Kim promised to help her friend through the crisis.   Stacy asked her friend to distract Rex while the doctor examined her.  Moments later, Stacy was stunned when the doctor examined her and announced that Stacy was approximately one week pregnant.   Shocked, Stacy thought back to her rendezvous with Fish that had taken place the previous week.\n\n\nAs Kim and Rex argued relentlessly out in the hall, the doctor informed Kim that Stacy had asked to speak privately with Kim.  Inside the examination room, Kim congratulated her friend upon learning the good news.   Thrilled to learn of her pregnancy, Stacy exclaimed, \"Fish did the trick!\"  Upon hearing Kim's squeal of delight, Rex approached the door.  When Kim reminded Stacy that it was necessary to keep Rex in the dark, Rex entered the room and questioned what was going on.   The girls immediately made up an excuse and attempted to prevent Rex from speaking with the doctor.   Ignoring their desperate attempts, a suspicious Rex asked the doctor to answer a few questions.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, a nervous Schuyler approached Gigi.   Schuyler admitted that Gigi's words of wisdom had convinced him to remain in Llanview.  When Schuyler questioned how Rex would handle the news, Gigi explained that Rex was preoccupied with Stacy's pregnancy.   Gigi credited Rex for doing the right thing, but she was convinced that Stacy was hiding something.   Displaying the empty home pregnancy test box that she had discovered in Stacy's wastebasket, Gigi wondered why a pregnant woman would be in possession of such an item.  As Gigi continued to relate her suspicions concerning Stacy, Schuyler had a flashback of the night that Stacy attempted to seduce him.\n\n\nAt the police station, Marty, Cole, Blair, and Todd waited to receive word concerning Starr and Hope.  Fearing for Starr and Hope's safety, Blair pleaded with Todd not to interfere in the police investigation.\n\n\nInside Bo's office, Bo and John realized that Sergei meant business when he fired a shot over the phone and threatened to kill Starr and Hope.  After firing a warning shot, Sergei allowed Starr to tell John and Bo that she and Hope  hadn't been harmed.   Instructing John and Bo to provide him with cash and a fueled plane, Sergei threatened to kill Starr and Hope unless his demands were met.   As Bo and John attempted to stall for time, Sergei made it clear that he expected results and abruptly ended the call.    Afterward, Bo advised his men that they needed to move fast.\n\n\nAt the warehouse, Sergei's co-conspirators complained about caring for an infant.   When his soldiers suggested that they kill the girls, Sergei reminded his men that Starr and Hope were related to very important people.   Convinced that his hostages were his only key to survival, Sergei announced, \"We'll take them with us and later sell them back to their rich daddy or whoever pays the most!\"\n\n\nBack at the station, Bo and John prepared a plan of attack.   After advising a team of officers to set up a perimeter around the warehouse, Bo briefed Brody on how to enter the building and rescue Starr and Hope.  As Bo and John exited Bo's office, Todd confronted them and demanded to be involved in the rescue.  Fed up with Todd's antics, John handcuffed him to a desk and set off to save Starr and Hope.  Demanding to provide the ransom money, Todd yelled after John, \"You know, I'm gonna kill you!\"\n\n\nMoments later, Bo, John, Fish, Brody, and the entire Llanview Police department descended upon the hostage site.   While Bo and John gave orders to their men, Brody managed to gain entry to the warehouse through the trap door that Asher had informed the police of.    Over his radio, Brody told his superiors that he had gained entry and alerted them that Starr and Hope were being held hostage by four Russians.\n\n\nThe Russians grew nervous when they observed the large police presence around the building and the sharpshooters on the roof.  One of Sergei's henchmen demanded that they take the girls and flee before the police gained entry.  Reminding his soldier that their third ally was downstairs checking the garage for a breach in security, Sergei informed him that they would flee through the trap door once their partner returned.  Meanwhile, Brody attacked Sergei's soldier, rendering him unconscious.  \n\n\nAt that moment, Sergei phoned the missing soldier.  Brody advised Bo and John that Sergei was attempting to locate his missing counterpart.  Bo and John feared that Sergei would realize a breach had occurred if Sergei didn't hear from the missing soldier within thirty seconds.   Determined to save Starr, Hope, and Brody, John disarmed and began walking toward the building.  Bo tried to stop John, to no avail.  Approaching the building, John called out to Sergei, \"I'm coming in!\"  Bo feared that John had given the kidnappers another target.   Sergei instructed his henchman to locate the missing soldier.\n\n\nObserving John through the window, Sergei exited the room to speak with John downstairs.  Meanwhile, Brody entered the room and took down the soldier that was guarding Starr and Hope.  As the wounded henchman lay unconscious, Brody rescued Starr and Hope, and the trio fled the main room.  Downstairs, Brody and Starr listened quietly as Sergei spoke to John through the half-opened loading dock door.   As John attempted to distract Sergei with promises of a getaway, Brody and Starr waited for the opportunity to escape.\n\n\nFinally, as John managed to convince Sergei to allow him entry, Sergei received a call from his only remaining soldier, who informed him that the police had entered and attacked one of their men.  Immediately, Sergei locked the door and ran upstairs to evaluate the situation.  At that moment, Brody and Starr fled from their hiding place and made a dash for the basement.  Hearing the commotion, Sergei fired a shot at them, but Brody managed to lead Starr and Hope to the trap door that led to the river.\n\n\nAn unarmed John entered through the garage door, but was unable to gain entry to the main building due to the locked door.   Realizing that his officers were in serious trouble, Bo raced into the building through the same garage door and assisted John by shooting the lock off the dock door.  Bo provided John with a loaded weapon, and the two men entered the main building and searched for Starr, Hope, Brody, and the Russians.\n\n\nDownstairs, in the basement, Brody safely guided Starr and her baby down the trap door.  Helping Starr on the raft that awaited her, Brody instructed Starr to paddle to safety.   Afterward, Brody headed back upstairs to help John and Bo battle the Russians.   Upon encountering Sergei's last remaining soldier, Brody tackled the soldier and forced him to drop his gun.  As Brody and the Russian struggled over the weapon, John searched for Brody.   In the shadows, Sergei lurked unnoticed.\n\n\nObserving the struggle between Brody and the Russian, John drew his weapon.   At that moment Sergei appeared and placed a gun in John's back and declared, \"I will kill the little girls while you watch. Then I will kill you!\"   In the next room, the Russian soldier stabbed Brody in the chest with a sharp metal object.  Brody gasped in pain.\n\n\nPaddling frantically, Starr looked down at her little girl and assured the child that they would be safe soon.\n\n \n\n\n",
