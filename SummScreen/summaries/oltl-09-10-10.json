Langston joined Starr, and Starr acknowledged that Ford had canceled the writing class and asked if Langston would give Bobby Ford another chance.  Langston updated Starr on what had happened between Ford and Jessica on prom night. She also revealed that Brody had punched out Ford, after he'd claimed that Ford had taken advantage of Jessica that night.  Langston whined that Ford had vowed to change, but she did not see that Ford had changed at all.  Langston explained that Ford had slept with Jessica on prom night, after he had already been with Karen, and after he had also \"hit on\" Langston.  Langston announced that Jessica's baby could be Ford's.\n\n\nLangston maintained that even though the incident on prom night had happened months before, if Ford had changed, it no longer mattered.  Langston then asked Starr why she had been late to class.  When Starr related that Cole had arrived just before class to talk to her, Langston believed that Starr and Cole would work out whatever had been wrong between them.  Starr pointed out that more was wrong between them, and that James was part of the problem.\n\n\nStarr believed that Cole still saw James as a threat and admitted that she still did not trust Hannah also.  However, Langston felt that Starr and Cole had \"what it takes to stay together,\" unlike Langston and Ford.  Langston stated that she had to pretend that Ford had never existed.\n\n\nLangston stressed that Starr needed to remember how she and Cole had felt, when they had first met.  Starr reflected that she and Cole had started out as friends, but that their relationship had turned into \"so much more.\"  Starr agreed that she and Cole should go back to the beginning.  She then pointed out that Bobby had backed out of the class, so that he could be with Langston.  However, Langston emphasized that it would never happen.  \"I don't ever want to see him again.\"  Starr bid Langston goodbye, and they hugged.\n\n\nCole pounded on the Fords' door and demanded that James stay away from Starr.  James hesitated then allowed Cole in.  Cole indicated that he was at the apartment to educate James on the relationship between Starr and Cole and reminded James of Hope.  When James claimed that he understood, Cole replied, \"I don't think you do.  You see, we're not just a couple of clueless kids trying to figure out what we want to do, when we grow up.  We're already grownup, and unfortunately, we had to do it really fast.\"  James wished to know the point of Cole's visit, and Cole exclaimed, \"The point is we might be going through a rough time right now, but we've gone through a lot more, because we love each other, and we always will.  So, if you could stop complicating things, that'd be really nice.\"\n\n\nJames stated that Starr had made it very clear that Starr and Cole were a couple, so he had backed off.  James then wondered if Cole would no longer allow James to be friends with Starr.  Cole insisted that he had seen how James had acted around Starr and claimed that James only wore the bullet around his neck to remind Starr of the \"great adventure\" that they had shared.  Yet, James claimed that he wore the bullet around his neck to remind himself of how close he had been to dying.  James then insisted that Cole worry about his relationship with Starr, before \"you lose the best thing that's ever happened to you.\"\n\n\nJames promised not to interfere with Starr and Cole and insisted that all he wanted was for Starr to be happy.  James warned Cole that he was giving Cole another chance with Starr.  \"Don't screw it up.\"\n\n\nAt the school, Cole found Starr at her locker.  He invited Starr to coffee before their next class, and she accepted.\n\n\nIn the hospital lounge, as Bobby Ford nursed his injured mouth, he joined Jessica at a table and related that he understood why Brody had been upset about Jessica's baby.  When Jessica asked if Brody was okay, Ford answered, \"Okay?  The guy found out that the kid he thought was his could be mine.  It's pretty hard to see the sunny side of that.\"  Ford insisted that even if he was proven to be the father, Brody and Jessica could raise the baby, because Ford did not want the child.  However, Jessica declared that she had no longer been able to lie to Brody.  \"Yeah, well, if it turns out it's your baby, Brody may not want it either.\"\n\n\nJessica only wished that the baby belonged to Brody.  Ford announced that he did not want anyone but Langston, and that because of Jessica, Langston was \"out of my life for good.\"  Jessica and Ford discussed their guilt for what had happened on prom night, and Jessica agreed that she had been partially to blame.  Jessica realized that she had been feeling hurt and, therefore, had done \"something really stupid.\"  Jessica acknowledged, \"The only one who hasn't done anything wrong is Brody.\"\n\n\nJessica declared that she was leaving to find Brody, and that she hoped that he had the strength to deal with the situation.  Ford emphasized that Brody loved Jessica, but she was unsure.  Ford exclaimed, \"Are you kidding?  It's only because of you, he decided to spare my life.  So, don't give up on him.\"  Jessica left.\n\n\nBobby entered his apartment, as James stared at the bullet on his necklace.  James was upset that Ford had quit the writing class, but Ford claimed that was his plan, so that there would be no conflict of interest.  At a picnic table, Langston angrily scratched out Ford's name on her class schedule.\n\n\nIn an exam room at the hospital, Brody cried that it had never occurred to him that he was not the father of Jessica's baby.  Brody told Natalie that when Jessica had given him the news, his only desire was to punch out Ford.  \"What am I supposed to do now, huh?  Just go on like nothing's wrong...or wait until the baby's born and see who it looks like?\"\n\n\nBrody blamed himself for prom night, because he had told Jessica that Mitch was her biological father.  Brody then realized that he could be the father of two children, of zero children, or of one child with \"the wrong woman.\"  Brody believed that it was karma, since he had made his mistake with Natalie.  When Natalie pondered, \"My twin sister and I are almost in the exact same situation,\" Brody pointed out that Jessica had actually told him the truth, but that he and Natalie were still lying.  Natalie insisted that she had tried to tell John the truth, but that something had always stopped her.\n\n\nBrody realized that it was not fair to blame Jessica for something that he had done himself and announced that he intended on telling Jessica the truth.  However, Natalie wondered how it could be fair for two couples to break up, when it would result in two confused children.  Natalie insisted that Jessica and Brody loved each other, and that they would marry and raise Jessica's baby.  Brody pondered if Jessica would think that Brody was attempting to get back at her, if he told her the truth.\n\n\nWhen Natalie begged Brody to tell her first, once he had decided what to do, Brody promised that he would.  Natalie voiced, \"And Brody, try to remember the good side of this.  We've got two brand new lives, two miracles, that could really bring a lot of joy to our lives, if we let them.\"  Brody nodded and left the room.\n\n\nNatalie called John and left a message, which said that \"this kid is going to be a real looker.\"  She hoped that the baby had John's eyes and then asked for John to meet her at the station to look over the sonogram pictures again.\n\n\nAs Brody called and left Jessica a message, which stated that they needed to talk, he heard a knock on the door.  Brody answered the door and found Jessica.\n\n\nIn the high school gym, Nate bounced a basketball, as Dani walked up to him.  Dani cried that Todd had appeared lost after he had received T\u00e9a's ashes.  \"It's just so unreal to think that's my mom...that that's all that's left in that container.\"  Nate hugged Dani and kissed her cheek.\n\n\nDani insisted to Nate that she was fine and remarked that she had received the text, \"I'm coming for you.\"  Dani stated that the number had been blocked, but that she thought she knew who had sent it.  Dani believed that Ross had sent the message.  Dani felt that Ross was reaching out to her, however, Nate thought that it sounded like a threat.\n\n\nDani revealed that she and Ross had played a game in the ocean, where she would swim, and Ross would act as a monster and would state that he was \"coming for\" her.  Dani remarked that she had told Todd that the text was from Nate, however, she believed that Todd had lied first.\n\n\nDani insisted that Ross would not help Eli with his crimes, yet Dani was thankful that Todd had helped her while her mom was sick.  Dani claimed that she did not know where Ross was, but Nate believed that Ross already knew about T\u00e9a, which was why he was \"coming for\" her.  Nate was concerned that Dani might have to choose between Ross and Todd.\n\n\nDani admitted that her relationship with Todd had changed, since she had first hated him, and that she felt \"horrible\" about lying about the text.  Plus Dani believed that Ross would be arrested if he tried to enter Llanview.  Nate hoped that Dani would never have to worry about choosing between her two dads.\n\n\nGreg located Destiny at her high school locker and yelled that he was relieved to see that she was fine.  Greg covered and stated that he knew that high schools had hazing, and Destiny claimed that everyone at the school had been treating her fine.  Destiny suspected that Greg was worried due to what had happened to Dani's mom.  Destiny told Greg that it made sense that he was overprotective and announced that she and Shaun should treat Greg to hamburgers at Rodi's.  Greg regretfully stated that he had to leave to \"take care of something,\" and Destiny understood that Greg needed to clear his head.  As he hugged her, Greg told Destiny to never forget that he loved her and left.\n\n\nDestiny discovered Nate in the gym and mentioned that Matthew should be sent to reform school for what he had done to Nate.  However, Nate reported that Dani was having a difficult time dealing with her troubles, and Destiny insisted that Greg was also.\n\n\nAt an unknown place, Greg unlocked a door, and just as he entered the room, he cried, \"You're alive!\"\n\n\nAt Todd's mansion, Todd answered the doorbell to Kelly.  When Kelly asked how Todd was doing, he sarcastically joked that T\u00e9a was in the living room, if Kelly wanted to say hi.  Kelly explained that she needed Todd's advice about her next column, and Todd suggested, \"Bloody Brothers...Murdering Sibs in Cahoots in Tahiti.\"  Kelly asked Todd if he had known that Ross was alive and was \"aiding and abetting\" Eli, and Todd responded, \"That's what 'in cahoots' means.\"\n\n\nTodd insisted that Kelly return to the office, but Kelly stated that she needed to get a quote from John McBain first.  Todd told Kelly to forget it, and Kelly wondered what Todd was \"up to this time.\"  Kelly speculated that John would cast doubt on Todd's exclusive story and guessed that Todd was fine with lying to the public.  Todd claimed that he did not care about the public; he only cared about Dani.\n\n\nWhen Kelly asked if Todd was lying to Dani, Todd exclaimed that he had to stop Dani from telling Ross about Tea's death, and that he had to \"nip it in the bud.\"  Todd revealed that he would use his newspaper to claim that Ross was involved in Eli's crimes.  Kelly believed that using the newspaper would be extreme, but Todd did not want his bond with Dani to change.  When Kelly stated that she understood, Todd exclaimed, \"I'm not sure that you do.  I just lost my wife.  I'm not going to lose my daughter too.\"\n\n\nKelly insisted that Todd would lose Dani if Todd lied about the person who had raised her.  Kelly advised Todd to tell Dani that he had said negative things about Ross in the past for his own selfish reasons.  Kelly also observed that when Todd felt cornered, he would do something crazy like kissing Kelly.  She believed that it was time for Todd and Kelly to discuss the kiss.\n\n\nKelly believed that the kiss had happened at the time, when she was still recovering from the breakup with Kevin, and when Todd was dealing with T\u00e9a's illness.  When Kelly expressed her hope to have a friendship with Todd, he said, \"You know, I'm not real big on the whole friendship thing, but if I were, you'd probably make the cut.\"  Kelly replied, \"Oh, gee, thanks.  So, can I run with the story that I'd originally planned, before I was so rudely interrupted?\"  Todd asked, \"What story's that?\"  After Kelly handed Todd a paper, Todd read, \"'T\u00e9a Delgado Manning...A Tribute,'\" and then said, \"Yeah, run with it.\"\n\n\nAfter Todd escorted Kelly out on the lawn and she left, Dani walked up.  Todd announced, \"Hey, there's something I need to tell you.  I lied about Ross.\"  Dani revealed, \"So did I,\" as someone unseen peered at them through the bushes. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "There seem to be suspicious circumstances regarding Eli's death and the cops question if he is really dead. Dani gets an anonymous text from an unknown caller telling her they are coming for her. Greg gets a text telling him that he better not say a word, right when he is talking to Marty ready to confess his secret. People suspect that Ross Rayburn might be looking for Dani and ready to come to town to avenge his brother's death. Todd admits to Kelly that he does not want Dani to have anything to do with Ross and wants her to believe he's a murderer even if they do not know that. He talks to Kelly. Dani talks to Nate. Brody is furious with Robert Ford for taking advantage of Jessica when she was in a fragile state and for not using a condom. Also he cannot cope with the possibility that Robert could be the father of her baby. Natalie is having a similar situation still not telling John that Brody could be the father of her baby. Robert Ford wonders if it's possible to get Langston back, then he can resume teaching his writing class at LU. Starr admits to Langston that she and Cole are having problems and she is friends with James and that is all it is.",
