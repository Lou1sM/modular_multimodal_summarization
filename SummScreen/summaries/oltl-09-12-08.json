    "soap_central": "\nEverybody in the (Gene) Pool!\n\n\nAt Rodi's, an angry Shane demanded to know why Rex felt the need to intrude on his time with Gigi and Brody. While Rex listened, Shane announced that he wanted to change his last name to Lovett. Blindsided by Shane's request, Gigi urged her son to reconsider, but Shane was adamant about having the same last name as his father. Unnerved by Rex's presence, Shane lashed out at him. Reminding Rex that he chose Adriana over Gigi, Shane pushed Rex and said that he hated him. A distraught Rex apologized to Shane and walked away. \n\n\nGigi scolded Shane and begged Rex to stay. Rex conceded that they had waited too long to tell Shane the truth. Fearing that Shane would hate him and Gigi, Rex said he couldn't bear to tell the child the truth. Although Gigi wanted to tell Shane that Rex was his father, Rex refused to hurt his son. Urging Gigi to calm Shane down, a hurt Rex left the bar. As she watched Rex leave, Gigi was heartbroken. \n\n\nAlone with Shane, Gigi tried to convince the child to keep his given name, but Shane refused. After Shane stormed off, Gigi approached Brody and informed him that she didn't plan to lie to Shane any longer. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Roxy presented Marcie with a handful of mail. Looking troubled, Marcie stated that she had already gone through the mail and it all belonged to Mike. As Marcie headed out the door, Roxy told Charlie that Marcie and Mike should have never broke up. While Roxy babbled away about losing Rex because of her refusal to tell him the truth about his father, Charlie reminded her about his renewed relationship with Jared and assured her that things could change. \n\n\nAs Roxy continued to confide in Charlie, a distraught Rex entered the hotel. Excited to see Rex, Roxy wondered what was troubling him. Both, Roxy and Charlie were stunned when Rex announced that his son hated him. Realizing that Rex was referring to Shane, Roxy had questions. Rex spoke rudely to Roxy and Charlie and berated them about the lie they had told him. Charlie apologized to Rex and hoped that he could work things out with Shane. Before leaving, Charlie told Rex that he didn't come to the hotel because he was angry with Roxy-he needed his mother. \n\n\nAs Rex told Roxy about the situation involving Shane, Roxy comforted her son. When Roxy applauded Rex for putting his love for Shane ahead of his own feelings, Rex appeared touched. Roxy assured Rex that it might take time, but he would develop a relationship with his son. Rex apologized for his treatment of Roxy over the past several months. Acknowledging that Charlie was right about him needing his mother's love, Rex allowed Roxy to console him. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Layla approached Mike and apologized about causing any problems between him and Marcie. Mike assured Layla that she had no reason to apologize for simply being a friend to him. Agreeing that they had helped each other deal with matters of the heart, Mike and Layla hugged. As Mike and Layla thanked each other with a friendly embrace, Marcie approached and gave them a knowing look. Layla apologized again and quickly excused herself. \n\n\nMike wondered if Marcie had come to visit him, but Marcie announced that she had an appointment to see Starr's gynecologist, Dr. Joplin. Although Mike and Marcie attempted to be cordial to one another, the conversation became tense when Marcie asked Mike to accompany her to speak with the doctor. Mike declined Marcie's offer and wished her luck. \n\n\nAt LaBoulaie, Dorian told Langston that she wanted to legally adopt her. Appearing stunned by Dorian's announcement, Langston wondered if Dorian wanted to adopt her out of fear that Langston was searching for her relatives. Overhearing the conversation, Starr approached and reminded Langston how much the family loved her, and advised her to accept Dorian's offer. Admitting that Delphina's revelation about Langston's possible relative prompted her to seek adoption, Dorian expressed her love for Langston and the desire to make her an official member of the family. After much urging from Dorian and Starr, Langston happily agreed to allow Dorian to legally adopt her. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Clint spoke to Jared over the phone. As Clint ordered Jared to keep him updated on his progress concerning bringing Langston's uncle to Llanview, Nora entered the room and overheard the conversation. Clint abruptly ended his call. A sarcastic Nora suggested that they toast to Clint's desire to destroy Langston's life. Nora was certain that Clint's scheme would somehow hurt Langston. Upset, Clint promised Nora that his plan wouldn't cause Langston any problems. As Clint advised Nora that he had to use Langston as leverage against Dorian, Markko interrupted the discussion and asked what was going on regarding Langston. Markko had come to the mansion looking for Cole, but wanted answers from Clint. \n\n\nMaking up an excuse, Clint avoided directly answering Markko's question. Clint told Markko that he intended to regain control of Buchanan Enterprises and take down Dorian. Clint said he feared Langston might get hurt in the process. Satisfied with Clint's explanation, Markko stepped away to answer a call from Langston. As Clint and Nora listened, Markko rejoiced at the news that Dorian planned to adopt Langston. Overhearing the news, Clint appeared interested, but Nora was visibly worried. Before leaving, Markko remarked that Dorian was a kind-hearted person and suggested that perhaps Clint was wrong about her. \n\n\nNora was concerned that Clint wasn't bothered by the possible outcome of his plan. Expressing his animosity for Dorian and blaming her for the destruction of his family, Clint was determined to take back his company, but promised to spare Langston. Clint assured Nora that Dorian wouldn't actually lose Langston-the plan was for her to believe that she might. Nora feared that Clint's plot wouldn't go as planned. \n\n\nAn elated Markko showed up at LaBoulaie and congratulated Langston and Dorian. Dorian announced that she intended to throw a lavish party to announce to the world that Langston was a Cramer woman. \n\n\nTodd panicked when he entered Marty's bedroom and couldn't find her. Smiling, Marty appeared in the doorway and demonstrated her new and improved walking skills. Realizing that Todd was worried, Marty asked him if he was disappointed by her progress. Todd admitted that he feared Marty might not need him anymore. Marty told Todd that she was thankful for all that he had done for her and assured him that she had no intention of deserting him. Marty was certain that her improved health was a good thing because it meant she was with him because she chose to be and not because she needed him. Marty reminded Todd that she needed to be healthy in order to help him raise his grandchild. \n\n\nMarcie paid a visit to Dr. Joplin and asked some questions concerning Starr's pregnancy. Delighted to speak with Marcie, the doctor gave her a good report. Marcie thanked Joplin for taking such great care of Starr. After Marcie left, Dr. Joplin appeared deep in thought. Seconds later, she picked up the phone and placed a call. \n\n\nMarty asked Todd to dance with her, and he obliged. While the two glided across the room, Todd's cell phone rang. Noticing that the call was from Dr. Joplin, Todd answered. The doctor requested that Todd come to her office immediately. When Todd refused, Dr. Joplin demanded to see him. Todd excused himself and headed over to the hospital. \n\n\nOutside of Dr. Joplin's office, Marcie placed a call to someone and stated that her baby was due in November. Todd appeared and stared at Marcie as she walked away. Todd entered Joplin's office and inquired about what she wanted. Joplin informed Todd that she had no intention of giving him Starr's baby.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex and Gigi try unsuccessfully to get through to Shane that Brody is not his real father. And Rex gives up when he can see that his son hates him. He goes and talks to Roxy, revealing that he blames himself for the situation since he abandoned Gigi all those years ago and gave her reason to assume that Shane must believe that Brody was his real father even though they believed that Brody was dead. Nora admits to Clint that she believes it is unforgivable that he intends to use Langston in order to get to Dorian. Marco then goes to ask them what they were talking about that he almost overheard and he reveals that Langston called him to reveal to him that Dorian has agreed to adopt her and she's asked him to join her and Dorian and Starr to celebrate. Todd notices that Marty is able to walk and reveals that he feels \"threatened\" by the fact that she is no longer dependent upon him to take care of her. Marcie is determined to adopt Starr's baby with or without Michael. She reveals that to Starr's doctor. And at that point, Starr's doctor informs Todd that she will not help him take Starr's baby from Marcie.",
