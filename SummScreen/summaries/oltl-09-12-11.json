He pretended to place a call to the station and asked for someone who hadn't slept with Natalie. She didn't think he should be one to criticize, and she informed him that she had been looking for Liam's jacket. Happily, she had just found it under the sofa.\n\n\nTodd noted how Natalie had really stuck it to her twin, and Natalie retorted that at least she hadn't killed hers. Todd advised her that he hadn't killed Victor, and he would be found innocent once the gun he'd had in his possession had been located. He figured that Brody hadn't looked that well or even at all for Louie and the gun that Todd had given Louie.\n\n\nTodd stressed that he had no intention of going back to jail, though Natalie was convinced that Todd would do anything to hide what might harm him. Todd thought that Natalie should understand, having a child of her own. He had children, and he'd never do anything to hurt them, he insisted. Victor had raised Todd's kids, and they'd loved Victor. Todd understood that.\n\n\nNatalie assured Todd that he shouldn't count Jack to ever be on his side. Todd clarified that the only thing he'd been guilty of was not being around to raise Jack. He'd thought about nothing but his children during his years of imprisonment. As Todd explained, Natalie grew to understand all that Todd spoke of. Todd noted that Victor hadn't been much of a father, and Natalie confessed, \"Victor let Jack get away with murder. Literally.\"\n\n\nTodd was confused, and Natalie suggested that he talk to Blair. Todd insisted that Natalie explain what she'd meant, because the charges against Jack had been dropped. \"Jack's a bully,\" Natalie stated. She told Todd how Jack had picked on Shane, and she included the fact that Shane had attempted suicide because of Jack. She filled him in on the day of Gigi's death.\n\n\n \"I don't believe you,\" Todd proclaimed. Natalie informed him that Victor had paid off another father to have that man's son plead guilty. Todd blamed himself, but Natalie didn't think that was fair. She stated that most parents weren't even aware of what their kids did when they left the house. She pointed out that the old Todd would have tried to help his son, but the new one was giving up. Natalie's words hit home, and Todd thanked her for listening. Natalie promised that it wouldn't happen again.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square flea market, Roxy and Echo pondered the disappearance of Morris the porcupine along with Rex's hidden gun. The women agreed that they would have to locate the thing before Rex's life could be destroyed. \"What thing?\" Rex asked as he walked up to them. Echo quickly changed the subject and asked about Shane's first day back at school. \"What are you guys up to?\" Rex replied, changing the subject again.\n\n\n\"My porcupine is missing,\" Roxy declared. She knew how much Rex had always loved Morris, and she needed to get it back so that Rex wouldn't be upset. He'd had too much to upset him in his life. Someone had stolen Morris \"accidentally on purpose,\" Roxy added. Rex didn't believe Roxy's story, but Echo hastened to tell him that Roxy had seller's remorse. Rex urged Roxy to try to find Morris, and she took off.\n\n\nRex confessed that Echo had been right to tell him to get rid of his gun. He had realized that it wasn't safe for the gun to be around Shane, given his history. Echo added that it wasn't good for Rex, either, since he hated Jack so much. Rex insisted that he could never shoot Jack, and he hadn't shot Victor. \"No luck,\" Roxy announced when she returned. Rex decided to find Shane, in order to hear about the first day of school.\n\n\n\"Tell him I love him,\" both Echo and Roxy called out simultaneously to Rex. Echo thought it had been a close call, and she'd wanted Rex to believe her when she'd agreed that he couldn't have shot anyone. She also didn't want Rex to find out that they'd \"screwed up royally,\" when they'd lost the gun inside of Morris. Roxy had an idea.\n\n\nCutter talked to Morris as he sat with the stuffed animal at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9. He advised the porcupine, \"You're an antique, and you're priceless.\" He hoped that Aubrey would enjoy her gift. \"What the hell are you doing with that thing?\" Brody inquired as he walked into the diner. Cutter informed him that he'd obtained the porcupine fairly at the flea market, and he suggested that Brody ask Roxy if he didn't believe it. He found it curious that Brody knew the animal's name.\n\n\nCutter announced that he was taking the porcupine home, though he expressed amazement at how heavy the animal was. Shane arrived and headed over to Brody. Upon questioning, Shane admitted that his first day at school hadn't been bad. While he'd had the chance to go to private school, he had realized that at least everyone at Llanview High School had already been familiar with his life, and he wouldn't have known anyone at the new school anyway.\n\n\nBrody remarked that all artists had \"crappy childhoods,\" and Shane acknowledged that probably meant that he was a genius. Shane had been happy that Jack hadn't been in school. Brody pointed out that it made sense that Jack had stayed home due to Victor's death, and the police were still investigating that. Shane announced that he hated Jack, though he had thought he'd feel better if Jack lost something, and he didn't. Shane announced that he had something to tell Brody.\n\n\nRex strode into the diner before Shane had a chance to talk to Brody. Rex asked about Shane's school day, and the teen revealed that it had been okay. Rex recalled that both of Shane's grandmothers had sent their regards, though they were both acting \"nutty.\" They had been distraught over a missing Morris. \"I know who has him,\" Brody informed them.\n\n\nRex thought it was too bad for Roxy, because she would have to pay heavily in order to get the porcupine back from Cutter. He asked Brody about the murder investigation, and Brody revealed that they didn't have any new information. Brody had to leave. He advised Shane to get in touch with him if he still wanted to have a conversation. Shane assured his father that he was feeling good about school.\n\n\nRex asked about Brody's offer to talk. He knew that Shane and Brody were good friends, but Rex wanted Shane to know that Shane could tell Rex anything also.\n\n\nKim knocked on the door of the Minute Man Motel in order to visit with her brother, and she was shocked when Aubrey answered the door. Aubrey assumed that Cutter had been lying to her, and the \"slut\" was another of Cutter's girlfriends. Aubrey asked the woman's name. \"It's Aubrey. Aubrey Wentworth,\" Kim stated.\n\n\nAubrey picked up the copy of the old high school yearbook. She couldn't get over the fact that the girl in the senior photo was the same woman standing in the room. Aubrey noted that the woman had taken Rama's money for plastic surgery. Kim snapped that the money issue was between her and Rama. Just then, Cutter rushed in with Morris in tow. He was excited until he saw the two women standing there. \"What's going on?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"What's the matter, honey? You don't recognize your sister, Aubrey?\" Aubrey/Christine inquired. Awkwardly Cutter went over to Kim/Aubrey and kissed her on the cheek. He acted as though it were the first time that he was seeing her. He attempted to introduce the two women, but he called them both Aubrey on his first try. He started again, and introduced his sister Aubrey to his girlfriend Christine. He also introduced Morris.\n\n\nAubrey/Christine turned up her nose. Cutter explained that he'd thought the stuffed porcupine would \"perk up the room.\" Aubrey/Christine received a phone call, and she ran into the next room. \"What the hell are you doing here?\" Cutter asked his sister. Kim/Aubrey retorted that she hadn't known that Cutter's girlfriend would be around, but she needed to talk to Cutter. He refused, advising her that it wasn't a good time.\n\n\nCutter couldn't risk Aubrey/Christine overhearing any talk about the Spotted Pony, because she had already been asking questions. Kim/Aubrey wanted Cutter's help to pay for her friend's hospital bills, but Cutter ordered her to leave. Aubrey/Christine returned to the room and happily announced that she had a job interview at Capricorn.\n\n\n \"So where are we gonna have this little guy bunk?\" Cutter inquired, nodding his head at Morris. Aubrey/Christine gave him an annoyed look. The couple admired the animal, and Aubrey/Christine touched him, but she stuck her finger on him. Cutter suggested that Morris go next to the bed, but Aubrey/Christine quickly rejected that idea. Cutter thought the animal would give them luck.\n\n\nAubrey/Christine awkwardly picked Morris up by the head in order to move him. The animal fell apart, and the gun fell out.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Jack was angry to learn that Todd hadn't been arrested for Victor's murder, though Starr did her best to convince him that Todd hadn't been the killer. The siblings argued about Todd again. Jack was adamant that Todd had killed Victor, especially because Jack had seen Todd take Dorian's gun out of the safe. Starr emphasized that Jack didn't know any more than that.\n\n\nJack retorted that Todd had knocked him out at the office, and he was certain that the killer would be found once the gun was found. He was sure that person would be Todd, no matter what Starr had to say. Jack also thought that while Todd could have been the great guy that Starr believed him to be, Todd had probably changed after eight years of being locked up and tortured. Something had probably happened to Todd's brain.\n\n\nTodd had blamed Victor for everything, and he'd wanted Victor dead. He had gotten his wish, Jack concluded. Starr was adamant that Jack not jump to conclusions. She promised that the police would learn the truth. She was aware that Jack loved and trusted Victor and felt horrible without him. She had loved Victor too; he had raised her for eight years. Starr wanted Jack to grieve and to give Todd a chance. He was lucky to have a father.\n\n\nShaun arrived at the police station to see John. He held his phone out and told him about the voicemail he'd received from Todd. Shaun explained that he and Vivian had been away on vacation, and he hadn't received his phone messages previously. The men played the message, and they heard the shot go off that had killed Victor. Shaun admitted that he was concerned about Dani and T\u00e9a, and he'd always gotten along okay with Victor.\n\n\nShaun noted that if Victor hadn't spoken to him properly, Shaun had always put the man in his place. He thought that Victor's call had sounded like a call for additional security. John pointed out that it was apparent that the shooter had gotten into the house on their own, there'd been no fight or confrontation during the call, and nothing had been said once the gun had been fired. John stated that it had definitely been premeditated, and Shaun replied that it would be murder one.\n\n\nShaun asked about the APB that had been out on Todd, and John clarified that they'd only been looking for Todd because of the missing gun. They didn't have anything on Todd, and the gun was still missing, John stated. John asked to keep Shaun's phone for a few days, and Shaun agreed. He asked John not to look at any of the photos that he and Vivian had taken in their birthday suits in a deserted area. John shuddered and promised.\n\n\nShaun wanted the killer to be caught. John wondered if Shaun knew Louie, the homeless guy, and Shaun replied that everyone knew the man. John related that Louie was missing, along with the gun that Todd claimed to have given him, so that the man could turn it into the police for cash.\n\n\nRoxy arrived at the police station and requested that John put out an \"IUD\" on missing Morris. John made a face and advised her he was busy. She advised John not to look inside of Morris when he found the animal. \"I'm afraid to ask. Why not?\" John wondered. Roxy stuttered. She made it clear that Morris was fragile and would fall apart.\n\n\nRoxy asked whether John had arrested anyone for Victor's murder yet, and she thought he'd have luck if he found Morris first. She began to ramble on about Natalie, and she advised John that both she and the detective knew that Natalie belonged with John.\n\n\nJack didn't want to give Todd a chance, but he and Starr were interrupted when Shaun arrived bearing a casserole. He wanted to pay his respects, and his mother had made the dish. He acknowledged that Victor had been a tough but fair boss, who had paid well and loved his kids. He was certain that John would locate the killer. \"We know who did this,\" Jack announced. He stormed off, and Starr was angry.\n\n\nShaun only wished that his voicemail from Victor could have been more helpful. He revealed its contents. \"You heard the murder?\" Starr gasped. She was shocked, and she wanted to know what had been said. Shaun told her, and Jack listened from the next room.\n\n\nStarr was upset and hugged Shaun tearfully. She swore that her dad hadn't committed the murder. Shaun suggested that maybe there had been an eyewitness, and he thought that Todd had nothing to worry about. Jack left the house.\n\n\nRoxy returned to the flea market and advised Echo that she had someone working on her case. Echo wanted to know who it was, and Roxy advised her it was \"need to know.\" Echo growled that she needed to know, but Roxy was confident that no one would look inside of the stuffed porcupine.\n\n\nTodd arrived at La Boulaie to see Jack. Starr wished him luck, because her brother was angry. She had tried talking to him without success. Todd acknowledged that he was just a murderer, but he asked Starr to get her brother. He wanted to talk to him. \"Look at you,\" Starr said admiringly. They joked that Todd was a \"new and improved\" dad. They found out that Jack was gone.\n\n\nNatalie ran into Brody. She informed him that she'd located Liam's jacket, and she'd spoken to Todd.\n\n\nJohn listened to Victor's voicemail again. Jack burst into the office, and John yelled at him to step outside and knock. At first Jack refused, but John was firm and angry. The teen stepped outside and knocked. John called him in. \"I remember what happened,\" Jack announced. He stated that Scarface had committed the murder.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Original Todd talks to Natalie telling her he does not trust her for taking Jessica's boyfriend and that she and Brody and John better drop the charges against him. She informs him that he is a suspect and they also get into a conversation where she informs original Todd of the first time that he is a bully, harassed a tormented Natalie's nephew Shane until Shane tried to kill himself. And Jack and his friends locked Shane's mom in a basement where she died of carbon monoxide poisoning but Todd enabled his son to get away with murder. He is shocked to hear that. Shaun goes to see John and later goes to see Starr informing her of his suspicion about who killed Victor Lord. Jack overhears and is determined to take the law into his hands believing that original Todd killed his father. Morris, Roxy's porcupine is missing and so is the gun that she and Echo need to hide in order to protect Rex from getting charged with murder. Cutter purchases the porcupine at the flea market suspecting nothing and intends to give him as a gift to Aubrey. he somehow knows this porcupine is their \"ticket to good fortune\". Kimberly comes by and meets Aubrey for the first time. And when Cutter and Aubrey least expect it, the gun falls out of inside the porcupine.",
