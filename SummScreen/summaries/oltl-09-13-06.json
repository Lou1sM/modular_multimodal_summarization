Cris vows to win his fight and everything else just for her.\n\n\nHugh furiously guarantees Spencer that he will have him convicted and sentenced to death, while Spencer vows to make everyone suffer. John hastily summons Hugh to his office to berate him for almost disclosing the truth about himself in his anger. It's not the right time, he says. Now that David is no longer the suspect in the murder case, Spencer will slip up. Nothing else will stick though, unless the murder weapon is found.  Hugh affirms that he can handle the case but is worried that they can be wrong the way they were with Todd. John responds that too many people know the truth this time. He also reassures him that he's not his dad, his biological one. Meanwhile, the crowd in the police station becomes unruly as Kevin accuses Spencer of giving him the virus and tries to go after him. Spencer insists that he's not responsible for Kevin's infertility but merely using the virus for research. Paige disputes this. Todd Is displeased too and voices his rage, threatening him along with Kevin. He taunts him with how his treatment will be in prison and how it will feel when he's about to be put to death. He has a deal to make though; if Spencer tells him where his son is, he'll speak to Hugh about life imprisonment instead. Spencer suggests he ask Margaret the baby's whereabouts. Bo assures Todd that they're working on it. He reins everyone in, calming them down. When Kelly overreacts to her baby's movement and has some pain, Natalie convinces her to leave and get something to eat. David learns that Dorian has been arrested. Paige is not sure how she'll handle Spencer when he learns about Hugh but she's sure she did the right thing in keeping them apart.

Hugh assures him that everything will be handled perfectly to the letter.\n\n\nAt the diner, Natalie tries to get Kelly to see that she can't let Spencer get away with what he did to her and Kevin. She begs her not to leave town. Kelly states that she cannot live with Kevin's constant anger on a daily basis but agrees to think it over when Natalie expresses her confidence in her brother's ability to handle it. She also states that the baby needs to have family around.\n\n\nMichael and Marcie are extremely nervous when they are summoned by the caseworker regarding Tommy's adoption. They learn that there's a problem.\n\n\nStarr's discharge from the hospital is imminent, pending the signing of the release papers. While she and Blair wait, the girl once again voices her disgust over her mother sleeping with Spencer, regardless of the reason. Blair has only proved that sex will get you what you want, she charges her. There were other choices but she acted like a slut. She herself will be a pariah in her new school, due to her abnormal family. Todd appears and they learn that Spencer is out on bail. Blair is worried for Starr and she's also upset that her daughter will never forgive her. She wants Spencer to pay for what he's done. Todd promises to get Spencer if justice doesn't.\n\n\nPaige makes her own offer to Spencer; he tells her where Todd's son is and she'll tell him where his own is.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Hugh almost tells Spencer that they are related as father and son. John is furious and lets him have it in the office about almost blurting out the secret. Hugh promises that he will handle this right. All John cares about it getting Spencer convicted of shooting his father. He knows that Spencer will be doing damage control as soon as he leaves the station and John will have him nabbed the second the man does something. \"Funny isn't it?\" Hugh observes. \"The son of the victim is teaming up with the son of the killer, to bring justice to the whole matter.\" Blair has Starr ready to go home but they have to wait for the papers to be signed. Starr lays into her mother about climbing into bed with Spencer when she knew that Todd was innocent and was wronged. She tells her mother that she disgusted. She knows that there had to have been another way to handle this and that her mother just looked at that option, of using sex to get what she wants. Kelly gets pain from her pregnancy and when she feels better, Nat whisks her off to get something to eat. Natalie implores Kelly to stay in town and not rob the family of the chance to know the baby. \"Don't let Spencer win.\" Kelly says that she is thinking of the baby and not about winning. She will stay for now to deal with the Spencer thing and then she is leaving town. Kelly remarks in a joking fashion that Natalie is awful bossy and reminds her of Dorian. \"Then there is something to be said about Dorian,\" Nat says. Todd wants to know where his son is, while Kevin wants to know why Spencer made him sterile. \"I never did that!\" Spencer does have a flashback though to the time last winter where he found Kevin in the phone booth and knocked him out. Kevin was laying in the snow, and that was when Spencer felt safe enough to remove his mask and do what he had to do. Todd offers to talk to Hugh to keep the bastard out of the death chamber, but all Spencer says to that is. \"The lot of you can go straight to hell!\" David asks about Dorian. When he hears the woman is in a holding cell, he rushes to her. Paige can see that there is still love there Cristian and Evangeline spend the day in bed making love, eating and making love again. \"We have something.\" One of Bo's men comes in and announces that the tracker that they put in Spencer's watch is giving off signals. \"He is at the hospital!\" Paige finds Spencer at the hospital. \"I will make you a deal. You tell me where Todd's son is, and I will tell you where your son is \"",
