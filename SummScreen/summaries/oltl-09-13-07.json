She wants to celebrate her \"new lease on life\" and extends a dinner invitation for later in the week. They decide to grab a bite and head for the docks. While there, Marty decides to get rid of her marriage license (to Miles) and John turns it into a paper airplane. He talks about how he tried to do the right thing for Mike and Tommy but things turned out badly. He still considers Tommy a McBain. He gives her advice on flying the airplane; \"just like darts\" into the water. \n\n\nBusy at work, Natalie is interrupted by an anonymous message online. She finally realizes it's an obnoxious Jared and she cuts him off abruptly. \"Jackass,\" she says as Jess walks in.

The talk turns back to the person that Nat was referring to and Jess is shocked to learn it's Jared. She claims to have just met him the previous night. Nat fills her in on the fake who's tried to get a job, claimed to have known Asa and had a false resume. She's thinking about calling security. She even picks up the phone when she learns he's Nash's new partner but Jess stops her. She and Nash are working with him and they will handle it, she says.
