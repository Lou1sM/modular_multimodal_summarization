Cutter warned Aubrey not to get her fingerprints on it, but she wanted it out of her sight. Cutter remembered that the gun that had killed Victor was supposed to be a nine-millimeter gun, which was what the gun sitting in front of him was. Aubrey wanted to call the police, but Cutter stopped her.\n\n\nCutter thought that the police would try to pin the murder on him and Aubrey. He knew that they would keep digging until they found something connecting the couple to the murder. A suspicious Aubrey wanted to know what was going on with him, because he'd been acting weird since his sister had shown up. He promised to tell her everything after they figured out what to do with the gun.\n\n\nAubrey wanted to know how Cutter had gotten Morris. He explained that he'd bought the porcupine at Roxy's flea market table while Roxy and Echo were arguing. He'd left the money on the table, and had taken Morris. Aubrey wondered what the women had been arguing about. Making the connection, Cutter suggested that Rex had killed Victor, and the women had been arguing about hiding the gun. Cutter thought that Rex would want the gun back, and reminded Aubrey of how much money Rex had.\n\n\nAubrey was horrified that Cutter would blackmail Rex, but Cutter explained that Rex could feel generous after getting his gun back. Aubrey had known that Cutter would never change, but Cutter insisted that he was doing it for her. Suddenly, Aubrey remembered her job interview. On her way out, she told him that he wasn't going to blackmail Rex, and that he was going to turn the gun in to the police. Cutter didn't want to lose her again. She promised that he wouldn't, as long as he turned the gun in. She kissed him, and she left.\n\n\nCutter picked up the gun with two plastic bags on his hands, and placed it into a larger plastic bag. He reasoned that what Aubrey didn't know wouldn't hurt her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Dani looked through all the pictures of Victor that Starr had put together. Dani related that she wanted to tell Victor how hard living without him was, but she couldn't. T\u00e9a promised to help Dani through, but Dani wondered who would help T\u00e9a.\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a opened the door to Destiny and Mrs. Evans. They wanted to express their condolences, and offered homemade cookies. Mrs. Evans handed T\u00e9a a list of local support groups. Dani said that she only wanted to know what had happened. Destiny blurted out that Shaun had a message from Victor at the time that Victor had been shot. T\u00e9a and Dani were glad to know, even though Mrs. Evans scolded her daughter.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Mrs. Evans left to put the cookies on a plate. Dani confided that she wasn't doing very well. She knew that a lot of people had probably been angry at Victor, but she believed shooting Victor was evil. T\u00e9a and Mrs. Evans gave the girls the plate of cookies, and went into the living room. Mrs. Evans wondered if T\u00e9a was still a practicing lawyer, but then felt bad for asking since T\u00e9a had just lost her husband.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wanted to talk about something other than Victor's death, so she mentioned Destiny's pregnancy. She knew that there were plenty of legal issues with an underage mother. Mrs. Evans explained that Nora was the problem, and told T\u00e9a about her issues with Nora. T\u00e9a wondered if Mrs. Evans wanted to hire T\u00e9a. Mrs. Evans admitted to wanting to hire T\u00e9a before Victor had died, but didn't want to burden T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a advised Mrs. Evans that life was too short to argue, so she and Nora needed to enjoy being grandparents together.\n\n\nDani wished that she could have been at school with Destiny. Destiny related that she had gotten teased, but Shane had had her back. She urged Dani not to worry about her, since Dani had just lost her father. Dani didn't want to talk about Victor anymore, because she wanted to talk about something happy, \"like you and your baby.\"\n\n\nDestiny admitted that she didn't know why her mother was so angry with Nora. Dani wondered what Destiny wanted, considering it was her child. Destiny confided that she loved that a part of Matthew was growing inside her, but she didn't know if she was ready to be a mother. Destiny knew that she didn't want her child to grow up being told lies like she had. T\u00e9a and Mrs. Evans exited the living room, and Mrs. Evans asked if Destiny was ready to go. Destiny made sure that Dani would be all right. \"I have my mom,\" Dani said. \"Me too,\" Destiny replied, smiling.\n\n\nT\u00e9a couldn't believe that Victor was gone, and confessed that she kept almost texting him. Dani expressed sympathy for her mother because she knew that T\u00e9a had loved Victor, even if he hadn't been the man that T\u00e9a had thought. \"He wasn't Todd, but I loved him with all my heart,\" T\u00e9a said, and hugged Dani.\n\n\nJack barged into John's office, and stated that he'd remembered what had happened the night of Victor's murder. To John's curiosity, Jack explained that he'd sneaked back to Victor's after Blair had taken Jack home. He'd been about to open the front door when he'd heard a noise behind him. He claimed to have seen Todd, who'd knocked him out, and entered the house with Jack's keys.\n\n\nJohn was suspicious of Jack's changed story. Jack insisted that he'd had a concussion, but had gotten his memory back. Jack continued that he'd been on the ground, dazed, and he'd heard Victor say, \"Hello?\" and then, \"What the hell are you doing here?\" He'd heard a gunshot, and then he'd passed out. John wondered how Jack had ended up at the hospital. Jack didn't know, citing that Todd was \"weird.\"\n\n\nJack wondered if John was going to arrest Todd. John informed Jack that the court didn't look kindly on people who changed their stories. Jack asserted that he was telling the truth, and that he'd testify if he had to. John took out a pad of paper, and told Jack to write his story down. When Jack was finished, John told him to sign it. Jack signed the paper, and left.\n\n\nRex told Shane that he knew Shane and Brody were friends, but Rex assured Shane that he could tell Rex anything. He wondered what was going on with Shane. \"Jack,\" Shane replied. Just then, Bo and Nora entered, and sat down with Rex and Shane. Rex asked about Matthew. Nora replied that nothing had changed, but she was sure that Matthew would get better. She saw that as a good reason to be involved with his child's life. A confused Rex asked for clarification, and Nora explained about Matthew and Destiny.\n\n\nShane admitted that everyone at school had been talking about Destiny and Matthew. He said that he'd tried to help her, since she'd reached out to him when he had been bullied, but Destiny had \"mopped the floor\" with the kids. As Nora began to explain her problems with Mrs. Evans to Rex, Shane moved to another table to do homework.\n\n\nA short while later, Bo, Nora, and Rex were talking about Victor's murder. Bo assured Rex that, even though Rex had motive, no one would point the finger at him. Bo's phone went off, and he announced that there had been a development in the case, so he had to go to the station. He left, and Rex went to sit with Shane. Rex wondered what Shane had tried to tell Rex about Jack. Shane only said that Jack had been going through a lot.\n\n\nMrs. Evans entered the diner and bumped into Nora at the counter. Nora admitted that she had been anxious to talk to Mrs. Evans. Mrs. Evans wanted to talk to Nora about the baby. Nora told her, \"Now's good!\" and Mrs. Evans agreed.\n\n\nA short while later, John asked for Bo's opinion on Jack's story. The two agreed that Jack had a reason to want to frame Todd. John revealed that Jack had gotten everything Victor had said, \"verbatim.\" Bo reminded John that Todd had motive, opportunity, and no alibi. John wished for the gun that Todd had stolen to be in his possession. Bo informed John that they had enough evidence to make the charges stick, even without the gun. He wondered if John was going to make the arrest.\n\n\nBlair was shocked to see Todd when she entered La Boulaie. Todd wondered where Jack was, but Blair didn't know. Todd needed Jack to know that he hadn't shot Victor. Blair knew that Jack wouldn't listen to Todd, because he didn't know Todd. Todd revealed that Natalie had told him all that Jack had done thanks to Victor's influence. Blair insisted that Victor hadn't been all bad, and he'd loved the kids.\n\n\nBlair informed Todd that Gigi's death had been an accident, but Todd thought that Jack should still take responsibility for it. Todd demanded to know where Blair had been when Jack had bullied Shane, and killed Gigi. She hadn't known what had been going on, but swore that she'd punished Jack when she'd found out. She'd talked to Jack, and had thought that she'd gotten through to him, but he'd reverted to his \"cold self\" once Victor had died.\n\n\nTodd suggested that genetics were to blame. \"The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree,\" Todd stated. Blair knew that Jack wasn't a saint, but she knew that he was a better person than Todd and his father. She thought that there was hope for Jack, but Todd wanted to get his son real help. Todd apologized for blaming Blair, and vowed to fix things. She hugged him, just in time for Jack to see as he entered the house.\n\n\n\"You're hooking up with dad's murderer?\" Jack yelled in disbelief. Todd said that he was at the house to tell Jack that he hadn't shot Victor. He swore that he wouldn't have done that to Jack. He hadn't wanted to give up his chance to be Jack's father. \"You deserve to be locked up in a cell for the rest of your pathetic life,\" Jack spat, and walked away.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Original Todd goes to talk to Blair about how it is that Jack has become a bully and responsible for killing a woman. They argue about whether Jack is not unlike his rapist father and/or child molester grandfather or whether it's the last 8 years of being raised by Victor or if she has neglected to properly raise Jack. Meanwhile, Jack goes to the station and tells John he now \"knows\" that original Todd murdered his father. John is not about to take his word for it but realizes its \"very odd\" that Jack would know the exact words that John has heard the two of them saying on the tape recording Shaun gave him. Little does John know that Jack overheard Shaun play the tape for Starr behind closed doors. John then confirms that to Bo and they both realize that he has grounds to arrest original Todd for murder. Destiny and her mom go to visit and offer their condolences to Tea and Dani. Tea and Felicia talk privately about Nora's \"determination\" to raise Destiny's baby. Phylicia tells tea that she believes her daughter has been manipulated and coerced. Tea is fascinated to hear that and they conclude that maybe Tea could represent Felicia's legal interests. Cutter and Aubrey discover the gun inside Morris the porcupine and when he remembers it was Roxy's porcupine and she was seen distracted and arguing with Echo about something involving Rex, they put two and two together that Rex might have used that very gun to kill Victor Lord, his two moms were trying to protect him by hiding the gun and that is the explanation. Right away, Cutter knows if a perfect way to blackmail Rex now that Rex is rich. Aubrey tells him she will not be any part of that. but as soon as Cutter is alone, he puts his plan into motion.",
