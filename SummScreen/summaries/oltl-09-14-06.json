The adoption agent revealed that the other couple interested has been married for years and lives in a nice house with a backyard. After, the McBains told the judge why they'd make the best parents for the baby. Marcie explained that they love Tommy and that Michael's a hands-on dad. She promised to spend as much time as possible with the child and would tend to his every need. She then went off on a tangent about how much Tommy loves The Little Mermaid (nice Disney tie-in). \"What can you specifically offer the child?\" the judge pressed. Love, Marcie said, adding that even though she and Michael are newlyweds, they're meant to be a family with the boy. Tommy began to cry; Marcie picked him up and began to sing to him. \n\n\nAt the Manning home, Blair blasted Todd for trying to turn their kids against her. Todd told Jack that they'd be spending more time together now. Jack wanted to know if Todd could take him sailing like Spencer had. Todd tried to hug his son, but Jack refused to hug him back. Todd blamed Blair for Jack's behavior.\n\n\nPaige informed Spencer that their son is alive and living in Llanview. Spencer was shocked. Paige refused to say anything more until he filled her in on his dealings with Todd. Spencer couldn't believe that she was capable of blackmail.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Hugh told John that it was true \u2014 he's Paige and Spencer's long-lost kid. He wondered what Spencer would've turned out like had they had a relationship. \"He's my father. He's also a sociopath and I have to live with that,\" Hugh sighed, not being sure what he should do in the case. He assured John that he could keep his emotions in check. \"I want to see the right man pay for the crime, even if that man is my father,\" Hugh said.\n\n\nAdriana visited Rex in the hospital and apologized for doubting their relationship. She shared that her love for him is what got her through being held hostage. Rex promised that nothing would come between them again. Later, Bo stopped by. Adriana happily told him that Rex might be going home soon. She stepped away and Bo gently scolded him for trying to take matters into his own hands. Rex was happy when Bo asked for his help in the Todd/Margaret/Spencer case. After, Adriana lamented that she didn't really have a home to go to. Rex invited her to live with him.... Bo ran into Paige in the hospital lobby. She said that she's excited to begin her new job as a junior researcher and revealed that she told Spencer about their son. Bo didn't want her to take on Spencer by herself. \n\n\n\"You look very 'woman behind bars,' \" scoffed David to a jailed Dorian. He stated that she needs a better lawyer. She insisted that she didn't do anything wrong and was only trying to protect Adriana. David angrily pointed out that Adriana could've been killed and that he thinks of Adriana as his own. Dorian pleaded with him to go to Adriana on her behalf, but David noted that even if he did do it, Adriana would still be in love with Rex. Dorian said that she's willing to do whatever it takes to win back Adriana's trust because she doesn't want to lose everyone she loves. \"You haven't lost everybody,\" replied David, reaching in between the bars to stroke her cheek. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Paige tells Spencer that he has a son and he doesn't believe it. She tells that five months after they divorced, she realized that she was pregnant and didn't tell him because she saw the way that he treated she and David and she didn't want that for their child. She moved to the West Coast to have the baby but realized that she had too many doubts about her ability to mother and be a doctor at the same time. Spencer thinks that Bo or McBain has set Paige up to do this. She can't convince him any more than she has and so she shrugs and starts walking off. \"Wait! Okay, I will listen. Tell me more about my son!\" Paige asks if Todd's son is still alive. Spencer will not give that up. \"I need more or we stop talking now.\" Paige thinks and says that all she will tell him right now is that his son lives in Llanview. Bo and John figure that Spencer must have some serious family issues, as he is obsessed with things surrounding families. John thinks that is something that they can use. John goes to Hugh and hears how Hugh wonders what kind of man Spencer could have been had he not decided to live his life the way that he has. He tells John not to worry as he will not blow this case. \"What if we want you to though?\" John figures that he could use Hugh to pull a scam on Spencer and get him properly convicted. Hugh says that he will help in any way that he can and he will not lose check of his emotions. Jack is upset when he hears that his mother is broken up with Spencer and he worries that his mother is going to marry his father. \"I want Dr. Spencer!\" he shouts. Todd shouts at the child making him cry. \"I am your father!\" Jack secretly calls Spencer and tells him that he needs to talk to him. John and Hugh put a plan together to fool Spencer into giving up what they need. Dorian is in jail and David comes to her, angry that she almost got Adriana killed. He is mad but he will help her and be a friend to her. Bo hasn't done anything about Dorian's charges, and so David is sure that the man is only trying to scare her. Adriana plans to move out of the house. Rex says that she can move in with him if she wants. Todd manages to have a nice talk with Jack. The boy warms up to him but refuses to give the man a hug when is asked to. Todd warns that if Jack doesn't warm up to him, he will never forgive Blair. After Todd leaves, the doorbell goes off. Blair opens the door to Dr. Spencer Truman",
