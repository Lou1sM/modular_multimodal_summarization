Roxy visits Michael and would like to know exactly how Rex is involved in keeping Tommy's paternity a secret.  Roxy threatens to contact her \"friends\" who will take care of Todd Manning.  Michael tries to explain to Roxy that he knew nothing about Todd being Tommy's father.  Roxy realizes that Rex forged the death certificate; she knows that Todd will be able to get the same information and is worried about Rex's safety.  Marcie has dragged Rex back to the apartment and Roxy confronts her about involving Rex.  Roxy tells them if they all plan to take on Todd Manning that they will need her help.  Roxy leaves and the McBains enlist Rex's help to make a case against Todd.  Michael and Marcie want Rex to prove that Todd is an unfit parent.  Rex offers free help, but the McBains tell him that they will need to hire him; they want any dirt on Todd that Rex is able to dig up.  They do not care if the uncovered information destroys Todd; Michael and Marcie want to keep Tommy at all costs.   Rex promises to prove Todd is unfit but questions Michael and Marcie about whether or not they really want to do this.  Rex is concerned about the adverse affect this would have on Starr and Jack.   The McBains feel Todd is out of control; they offered to give Todd visitation but he refused and wants full custody.  At this point, they are only concerned with what is best for Tommy.  Rex tells Michael and Marcie that he is sure he can find enough evidence that will convince the judge to allow the McBains to keep Tommy for now.  Marcie screams at Rex uncontrollably that they want to keep Tommy forever.   Rex tries to warn them that Todd will fight back. Marcie confronts Rex about knowing the truth about Tommy and not telling them.  She understands why he did it but feels they could have been better prepared if they had known all along.   As a nervous Michael looks on, Rex admits to knowing for a long time.  Marcie becomes angry with Rex after learning this.\n\n\nBlair tries to convince Todd that she wants to help him.  Todd wants nothing to do with Blair and attempts to throw her out of his apartment.  Blair refuses to leave until Todd understands why she had him thrown in jail.  Blair talks playfully with Todd, but he is unreceptive.  Blair tells Todd that she did everything she could to help find him while he was missing and that she will always be there for him.  Todd is unconvinced; he blames Blair for Tommy still being with Michael and Marcie.  Blair urges Todd to work out an arrangement with the McBains or to let the courts make a decision; she doesn't want Todd to take the law into his own hands.  Todd vows to Blair that he will get his son back.  Blair is convinced that Todd has plans to run off with Tommy.  She tells him that Starr and Jack would be hurt and questions what kind of life Tommy will have on the run.  After being unable to reason with Todd, Blair angrily tells him that she understands what Marcie is feeling because she knows what it is like to lose a child.  Blair reminds Todd of how he hurt her and Jack, when he kept Jack away from her.  \n\n\nAs John and Marty share a passionate kiss on the docks, Natalie and Miles solemnly watch nearby.

Before leaving, Natalie takes a painful look back at John and Marty.  Marty apologizes for placing John in a bad situation by impulsively kissing him.  John tells her there is no need for her to apologize because she has done nothing wrong.  John tells her it would have been interesting to see what she would have done if they had not been interrupted.  John and Marty have a meaningful talk on the docks.  Marty values their friendship and hopes she has done nothing to damage it.  John answers by affectionately stroking her hair and then gently caressing her face.

Meanwhile, Miles sits in the steam room deep in thought.\n\n\nNash opens Jared's hotel door and finds an angry Jessica there.  Nash questions her about why she is shouting and pounding on Jared's door.  Jessica quickly covers and tells Nash that she has come to warn Jared about harassing Natalie.  Jared explains that he was merely trying to get Natalie to hire him.  Jessica tells Nash that Jared is a liar and has an agenda.  Jared asks Jessica why he would have an ulterior motive since he has never met her before.  He then questions Jessica about whether or not they do know one another.  Nash stares confusingly at them both.  Jessica tells Jared that he knows nothing about her and she is used to people trying to scam her family.  Nash receives an important business call and is unsure about leaving the two alone.  After Nash leaves to take the call, Jared turns his attention to Jessica.  He angrily yells at her, \"Why did you try to ruin my life?\"  Jessica tells Jared to come to her if he wants revenge but to leave Nash and Natalie alone.  Jessica wants to know why Jared is playing cat and mouse games with her; why hasn't he told Nash the truth?  Jared questions Jessica about why she hasn't told Nash about their past.

Natalie accepts a drink and begins to give Jared the sordid details of her encounter of John and Marty on the docks.  Jared begins to get a buzz from the alcohol.  After Natalie rants and raves about John, she begins to get a little out of sorts from the alcohol.  Jared tells her that maybe she should take it easy on the alcohol.  Natalie continues to gulp down alcohol and take out her frustration on Jared.\n\n\nNash is convinced that there is something that Jessica is keeping from him concerning Jared.   Jessica quickly takes Nash's mind off of Jared with a kiss.  Jared tells Natalie that most women would be concerned drinking in a strange man's motel room.

Rex continues to explain himself.  Michael tells Marcie that Rex put himself at risk to protect them.  Marcie realizes he had good intentions but is still upset; she leaves to check on Tommy.
