As John prepared to help the wounded officer, Sergei placed a gun in John's back.  Threatening to kill John, Sergei ordered him to drop his weapon.   John managed to get the upper hand on Sergei, and the two men struggled over Sergei's gun.   As the men fought, Sergei accidentally shot himself and fell through a nearby window.  As Sergei's motionless body dangled through the window pane, John stood over him and exclaimed, \"Dasvidania, Comrade!\"\n\n\nAfter critically wounding Brody, the Russian pointed his revolver at Brody, but Bo rushed into the room and shot Brody's attacker.  As blood gushed from Brody's body, Bo urged the soldier to hang on until help arrived.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Rachel and Matthew stood vigil with Destiny and her parents, and awaited word on Shaun's condition.   After informing Rachel that Matthew had contacted her about Shaun's accident, Nora thanked her son for realizing that they needed to be together.   As Destiny continued to brag about Greg's surgical capabilities, Mr. and Mrs. Evans, and Rachel worried about the outcome of Shaun's surgery.\n\n\nPrivately, Rachel and Nora discussed Rachel's relationship with Shaun.   Stating that her feelings for Shaun weren't romantic, Rachel admitted that she and Greg did share a few special moments together.  Consumed with guilt, Rachel told her mother that she regretted not telling Shaun the truth about her feelings for him.  Offering her daughter support, Nora told Rachel that she had done the right thing.   Acknowledging that Rachel had decided to spare Shaun's feelings after the accident, Nora told Rachel that everything would be fine if Rachel told Shaun the truth after he recovered.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside the operating room, Greg assured Shaun that the surgery would be a success.  Greg was touched when Shaun related that he trusted his brother with his life.  As a confident Greg prepared to perform surgery on his brother, he was shocked when Vivian entered and advised him that she would be assisting him.  Greg argued that he was capable of operating on his brother, but Vivian expressed her concern that Greg had emotional ties to the case.  Vivian stated that if Greg hesitated for one moment, it could result in Shaun's death.  Greg allowed Vivian to assist in the surgery, but was confident that he would single-handedly save his brother's life.   Upon removing the bullet fragment from the base of Shaun's brain, Greg boasted about his skillful work.\n\n\nBack inside the waiting area, a nurse informed the Evans family that the surgery had been completed, and that Dr. Evans would later answer their questions.  Everyone was pleased to learn that the surgery was over, but expressed a slight concern about the limited update on Shaun's post-surgical condition.\n\n\nOnce the surgery was completed, Greg became alarmed when he examined Shaun's x-rays and learned that a small piece of the bullet fragment was lodged inside Shaun's brain stem.  With a look of horror, Greg explained to Vivian that the fragment was embedded deep inside the base of Shaun's brain.  Greg feared that he might cause severe damage to his brother if he tried to remove the fragment.  Vivian reminded Greg that there was no other alternative.   Moments later, as he prepared to operate on his brother for the second time, a panicked Greg confided in Vivian that he didn't think he was capable of performing the surgery.  Reminding him that he was the best qualified surgeon, Vivian convinced Greg to perform the surgery.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the hospital to learn the condition of both Shaun and Brody.   John informed everyone that Starr and Hope were safe.  Shaun's parents were pleased when John referred to their son as a hero.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi shared her suspicions concerning Stacy with Schuyler.  Explaining that she had discovered an empty home pregnancy test box inside Stacy's trash, Gigi wondered why a pregnant woman would be in possession of the kit.   As Gigi commented that Stacy might not be pregnant with Rex's child, Schuyler had flashbacks of his recent encounter with Stacy.   Unable to recall what had actually taken place between him and Stacy, Schuyler listened to Gigi's suspicions, but remained silent about his possible involvement.  While Gigi continued to accuse Stacy of trapping Rex, Natalie approached and was stunned to learn of Stacy's pregnancy.  Schuyler appeared sad when Natalie assured Gigi that no one would ever succeed at causing the breakup of Gigi and Rex.\n\n\nAt the clinic, Stacy and Kim nearly panicked when Rex asked the doctor for information regarding a paternity test.  In an attempt to deflect Rex's questioning, Stacy accused Rex of not loving their child.  As Stacy and Kim continued to criticize Rex's behavior toward the unborn child, Rex became annoyed and asked the doctor to explain how far along Stacy was in her pregnancy.  Stacy and Kim's prayers were answered when the doctor received an emergency phone call.  Dismissing Rex's questions, the doctor presented him with a pamphlet concerning his role as a father, and rushed off to her patient.  Afterward, Stacy begged Rex not to punish their child because of his feelings for her.   A frustrated Rex promised to support Stacy and their unborn child.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Clint expressed his happiness regarding Jessica's relationship with Brody.  Clint was surprised when Jessica confided in her father that Brody was working undercover for Bo.   Thrilled by her blossoming relationship with Brody, Jessica assured Clint that the dangerous undercover operation was nearly completed and that Brody would soon sail through the police academy, safe and sound.  Seconds later, Jessica received a call from Bo, informing her that Brody had been injured.\n\n\nNearby, Schuyler suggested that Gigi tell Rex about discovering the home pregnancy test box.  Gigi feared that Rex would look down upon her if he learned that she had rummaged through Stacy's trash.   Advising her to trust her own instincts, Schuyler reminded Gigi that she had reason to be suspicious of Stacy.  Schuyler's words of wisdom convinced Gigi to tell Rex the truth.  After having another flashback of his rendezvous with Stacy, Schuyler quickly excused himself and rushed out of the bar.\n\n\nBack at the clinic, Stacy and Kim plotted their next move.   Stacy wondered how they would pull off a paternity switch, but Kim came up with a plan.  While the two women strategized, Schuyler appeared and demanded to know if he and Stacy had slept together the night she had tried to seduce him.  After informing Schuyler that they didn't have sex that day, Stacy and Kim rushed out into the hall.  While Schuyler observed them through the window, a nervous Stacy told Kim that Schuyler might uncover her secret.   Easing Stacy's fears, Kim promised that everything would work out in Stacy's favor.\n\n\nRex paid Gigi a visit at Rodi's.  When Gigi told Rex about her discovery, Rex dismissed her suspicions.  Gigi expressed her belief that Rex hadn't fathered Stacy's child, but Rex was adamant that it was a strong possibility that he was the father.  Informing Gigi that he planned to be a father to his child, a frustrated Rex walked away.   Observing Rex as he read the pamphlet that he had received from the doctor, Gigi dropped the home pregnancy test box in the trash.\n\n\nGreg removed the bullet fragment, but Shaun's blood pressure continued to drop.   Greg and his staff used the  defibrillator to resuscitate Shaun.  Meanwhile, Brody was rushed into the emergency room.  As the doctors tried to save Brody's life, they feared that he had lost an enormous amount of blood.  While Jessica observed the doctors tend to Brody through the examination room window, she cried, \"Dear God, not again!\"  Clint, Nora, and Natalie consoled a grief-stricken Jessica.\n\n\nMoments later, the doctors removed the metal object from Brody's abdomen, and his blood pressure became stable.   Meanwhile, Shaun's condition continued to decline.\n\n\nLater, Greg entered the waiting room and approached his family.  As they bombarded him with questions about Shaun's condition, a devastated Greg stood silent.\n\n\n",

Gigi knows there is something very fishy with Stacy having a home pregnancy in the trash if she is really pregnant. Kim covers for her when Rex demands some answers about her pregnancy. But since it appears she is a few days pregnant, she knows she need not worry how she can \"pull it off\" to Rex that she is pregnant.",
