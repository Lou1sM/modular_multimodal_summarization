Starr was happy to see him, and she advised James that he was the only one that could enable her to get through everything. Starr explained that Jack believed that Todd had committed the murder, but Starr had no doubts that Todd was innocent. She was the only one that her father could never lie to, and she believed what Todd had told her.\n\n\nStarr noted that Baz didn't believe his own father's alibi for the night of the murder, and Baz thought it possible that Tomas was guilty of murder. Starr stressed that there had been lots of sadness surrounding the house of late, and even Hope could tell that Starr had needed an extra hug.\n\n\nJames inquired about the demo that Starr had made with Baz, and Starr confided that Baz had found a producer. James was excited, but Starr assured him that it wasn't a good thing. The producer had turned out to be Rick, who had apparently \"branched out.\" James grumbled that the guy was a creep, and Starr assured him that she would have nothing to do with Rick. The problem was that Rick had been the only producer to make an offer.\n\n\nJames disagreed. Rick had only been the first producer to make an offer. James was sure that after people heard the song, it would be a hit. James didn't want her to settle, and he only wanted the best for Starr. He wanted her to make Baz understand that they needed to wait for the right offer to show up. Starr understood. She had James after waiting for the right one.\n\n\nStarr thought that they should leave for the funeral. She was pleased that James was there and would be sitting next to her. She was sure that things would get better for them. James informed her that he was there for \"the long haul.\"\n\n\nBaz found Dani looking through photos, and he offered to help her out. Dani replied that the only thing she wanted she couldn't have. Baz wondered if Dani had put together any music for the funeral, and she realized that she hadn't thought about it. Baz proposed that he put together a disc, and he suggested that she look at some music.\n\n\nBlair arrived to help T\u00e9a get ready for the funeral, but Tomas advised her that he'd already knocked on T\u00e9a's door and she hadn't answered. Blair suggested that maybe T\u00e9a didn't want anything to do with Tomas, due to the fact that he might have been the one to kill Victor. Blair reminded Tomas that he'd always wanted to get rid of Victor, and even Baz was suspicious of Tomas.\n\n\nTomas pointed out that his son didn't know him well, due to the fact that Tomas hadn't been around to raise him. Tomas would have never shot Victor. Blair demanded that Tomas tell her if he'd had anything at all to do with Victor's death. Tomas admitted that he had wanted Victor gone, because Irene had brainwashed her son. Victor could have been dangerous, because Irene would have always been in control. Tomas had always feared for T\u00e9a and Dani, though he agreed it hadn't been Victor's fault.\n\n\nTomas confessed that he'd gone to see his friend Calmar, to find out if there would be a way to get Victor to leave T\u00e9a. That was where he had been the night of the murder. Blair declared that she had wanted answers like everyone else, and she had realized that Tomas wouldn't have shot Victor after he'd already saved Victor the first time he'd been shot. Tomas accepted that as Blair's vote of confidence, and she hoped it would help with Baz.\n\n\nTomas responded that he'd told Baz the same story, and Baz had been non-committal. Blair thought it was a start. They walked into the living room and found Dani and Baz. Blair comforted Dani, who recalled almost shooting Victor herself when they'd first met. Baz received a phone call, and he stepped away.\n\n\nIt was Rick, and Baz advised him that Starr would have nothing to do with Rick. She had a funeral to attend, but Baz was confident that he could speak for both himself and Starr.\n\n\nTomas revealed that he had to fly to Langley in order to give a report on Irene. Blair felt that she owed Tomas an apology. She'd been suspicious of him, and therefore couldn't get close to him. That meant that she couldn't get her heart broken. She had no more reasons to stay away from him though.\n\n\nRoxy found Nate sitting at a table at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9. She showed him a copy of the flyer she'd had made and posted around town. It was a picture of Morris, and the flyer stated that he was missing. Nate wasn't familiar with the animal, and Roxy was annoyed that he didn't recognize a porcupine when he saw one. She announced that finding Morris was a matter of life or death.\n\n\nNate was perplexed, and Roxy mumbled about something being inside of Morris. Nate wanted her to explain, and Roxy made up a story about Morris having a heart. He was a member of the family, and she'd do anything for him. Nate suggested that another method might work better, and he told Roxy that she might want to call her psychic.\n\n\nRoxy thought that was a great idea, and she reached for her phone. Delphina called Roxy first and agreed to meet her at the diner. Roxy and Nate looked at the newspaper and talked about Victor. Nate admitted that he was concerned about Dani, but he was certain that he was the last person that Dani would want to see.\n\n\nAs Nate got up to leave, Roxy handed him a flyer to post, and Delphina arrived. Delphina stopped the teen and urged him, \"Go to her. She needs you.\"  Delphina took a seat at the table with Roxy, and Roxy told her all about Morris. Delphina asked for something belonging to Morris in order to make a proper connection with her contacts. Roxy handed her a sweater that she'd used to cover up Morris on chilly days.\n\n\nDelphina looked up and began to chat with the unseen contacts. She revealed that she'd been given the number nine, and two letter m's, lower case. Roxy was aghast. She couldn't believe that Eminem had Morris. Delphina repeated the clues and realized that the m's stood for millimeter. She asked Roxy about a gun, but Roxy denied that a gun was involved.\n\n\n \"And I'm Lady Gaga,\" Delphina proclaimed. Again, she asked Roxy about a gun. Roxy leaned over and began to whisper. She admitted that there was a gun inside of Morris, and someone she cared about might have used it to kill someone. Delphina wanted more information. Roxy revealed that it might have been Rex who had killed Victor, though she didn't believe it. Echo had thought it possible though. Delphina turned and spoke to her dead associates again.\n\n\nAubrey woke up and began screaming when she saw Morris sitting in the bed next to her at the Minute Man Motel. Cutter ran into the room and apologized, but he'd thought that the stuffed animal was kind of cute. Aubrey was only glad that Cutter had gotten rid of the gun they'd found inside of Morris. Cutter thought back to his putting the gun back inside of the animal, but out loud he told Aubrey that it had been easy.\n\n\nAubrey was shocked that Cutter had listened to her, even though they didn't know for sure whether Rex had actually used the gun to shoot Victor. Cutter was convinced that Rex was guilty, especially the way that both Roxy and Echo had appeared to be covering for Rex. Aubrey kissed Cutter, because she was so proud of him. She was pleased that they wouldn't be making a profit off of the gun. Cutter muttered that Rex would be paying for it one way or another.\n\n\nCutter wanted to think about the future instead of Rex. Aubrey informed him that her first interview at Capricorn had gone well, but she still had to meet with Blair. She lacked confidence, though, and told Cutter that she didn't have any skills. She couldn't dance and take her clothes off like Cutter's sister, Aubrey. Cutter replied that they should call his sister \"Kim,\" as she seemed to prefer that. Aubrey wondered why Kim was in town.\n\n\nCutter exclaimed that Kim had wanted a loan in order to help a sick friend in the hospital. \"Seriously?\" Aubrey asked. She wasn't buying the excuse for a minute, but Cutter had something to say about his sister. He described Kim as someone who would never turn her back on anyone, and he spoke about how kind and caring she was.\n\n\nAubrey asked about the money that Kim had stolen from Rama. Cutter clarified that those two women really hadn't been close. Aubrey wondered what kind of secrets Kim might have on Cutter. She asked him if he had been geeky in high school, and she teased him about his probable nose job. Cutter assured Aubrey that he'd never had any work done, and their kids would have nothing to worry about in the looks department.\n\n\nAubrey was amazed. She was astounded that Cutter was talking about kids, something that he'd never done in the past. He was a \"whole new Cutter,\" she said. She thought that she would run out and buy a newspaper, in case the Capricorn job didn't work out. Cutter was certain that it would, and he handed her money to buy a new outfit instead.\n\n\nAubrey was reluctant, pointing out that they couldn't afford it, but Cutter convinced her to do it. \"I don't think I've ever been as happy as I am now,\" Aubrey uttered. She left, and Cutter turned to Morris. He hadn't wanted to lie, he told the porcupine.\n\n\nKim arrived at Llanfair and found a smiling Clint there to greet her. She had been nervous, because he had asked to see her, and she thought that something might be wrong. Clint had some good news. He revealed that thanks to his clout at Llanview Hospital, he'd spoken to his contacts there. He had a solution for the medical expenses for Kim's friend. He'd arranged to have the woman transferred to Llanview Hospital.\n\n\nKim was speechless at first, and then she began to make up different excuses for refusing Clint's offer. Clint assured her that all expenses would be paid, but Kim was adamant. Firmly, she told Clint that she had to refuse his offer. Her friend could not be moved, because it was too much of a risk. Clint asked what the friend's name was, so that he could have an administrator talk to someone at the hospital in Kentucky.\n\n\nKim assured him that it didn't matter what the name was. She would just leave her friend at the Kentucky hospital, and take care of those bills. She thanked Clint for his gesture and promised him that she would never forget it. She left the room, and she stopped to look at the photo of herself with Stacy on the way out.\n\n\nClint thought that Kim was stubborn, and he wheeled himself over to the laptop computer. He began to look up hospitals in Kentucky and recalled that it was near the place called the Spotted Pony.\n\n\nRex paid a visit to Gigi's grave, and he updated her on what was happening in both his life and Shane's. He admitted that he thought he would have felt better after Victor had been killed, but he hadn't. Rex was aware that he had to let Gigi go, especially after he'd seen her lying in her coffin. He knew that the date on her headstone had probably been scratched out due to some mischievous kids.\n\n\nTurning away from the grave, Rex gasped. Gigi was standing there, and he called out to her. He stood and ran towards her, but she disappeared. Rex turned around, and Gigi was in another spot. \"Don't give up,\" she said.\n\n\nRex quickly shouted how she'd told him the same thing previously, and he'd tried to find her at the Spotted Pony. He'd only found someone else using her name, just as Stacy had done. Gigi disappeared and reappeared in yet another spot. Rex begged her to explain, but she was gone again and did not return.\n\n\nBaz made plans to meet with Rick, and just as he left the house, Nate arrived to see Dani. Nate admitted that he'd been thinking about Dani, and he was sorry for Victor's death. He knew that it hurt when someone's dad died, even if it was a dad that one didn't care about. He couldn't stay away, and he didn't think that Dani should be alone. After barely saying a couple of words in agreement, Dani wrapped her arms around Nate.\n\n\nRex arrived at the diner and stopped at the table where Roxy and Delphina sat. Delphina had been conversing with her contacts again, but she announced that her connection had been lost when Rex showed up. Roxy revealed that Delphina had been helping her to locate Morris. Rex proclaimed that Brody had seen Cutter with the porcupine, and Roxy rushed out.\n\n\nDelphina wondered if there were anything that she could help Rex with. Rex advised her that he didn't want to hear anything else about the Spotted Pony. Delphina reminded him that he had found a girl using Gigi's name. \"Don't give up,\" she declared. Suddenly, Delphina paused and listened to one of her invisible informants \"Ask your father,\" she advised Rex.\n\n\nRex was mystified. He couldn't understand why he would be asking Clint anything. \"That's all I got,\" Delphina emphasized. She didn't want Rex to ignore her. She advised him that the message had \"packed a punch.\"\n\n\nKim showed up at the motel to visit with her brother. She was distraught, and she told him about Clint's caring offer that she'd had to turn down. Cutter agreed. They couldn't have Kim's friend in Llanview. Kim wondered how she would get the money she needed, and Cutter turned to look at Morris.\n\n\nKim was disturbed, and she wondered why Cutter was staring at the porcupine. She thought it was creepy. Suddenly, there was a loud knock at the door, and Roxy shouted that she wanted her baby.\n\n\nClint found the hospital in Kentucky, and he asked for information on Kimberly Phillip's friend.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair presses Tomas to tell her if he killed Victor. He says he didn't do it. She believes him. He asks her to convince his son. Starr tells James that Jack is certain that Todd killed Victor and she is just as certain that he did not. Starr tells James that Baz found a producer for their demo, but she won't do business with him because he is the porn producer blackmailed Nate and Deanna. He says they should hold out for a better producer. Baz tells Dani to pick some music that she thinks would be meaningful to victor so that he can put it on a disc for her to use at the funeral. Baz gets a call from Rick, the porn/record producer and tells him that he can speak for Starr. Rex goes to Gigi's grave and has a conversation. He tells her that he thought seeing Victor Lord and his family suffer would help ease the pain of losing her, but it didn't and he doesn't know how to let go. An apparition of Gigi, dressed in white, with pale blonde hair, and holding a white rose appears. She says, \"Don't give up.\" Nate suggests that Roxy call Delphina for help in finding Morris. Delphina tells Nate Dani needs him. Nate goes to Dani's house to offer condolences. She holds him. Delphina sees the digits \"9mm\" and wants to know about the gun. Roxy tells her about Echo suspecting that Rex might have killed Victor. Rex tells Roxy that she doesn't need a psychic to find Morris; Cutter Wentworth has him. Rex asks Delphina what Gigi meant by \"Don't give up.\" Delphina gives Rex the message to ask his father. She adds that it is a strong message that should not be ignored. Cutter has Roxy's stuffed Porcupine, Morris, in his possession. He allows Aubrey to believe he got rid of the gun in the porcupine. Aubrey wonders why Cutter's sister, Aubrey, looked him up after all this time. He tells her his sister needed a loan to help a sick friend and that she goes by Kim these days. Clint arranges to have Kim's sick friend in Kentucky transferred to Llanview Hospital. She tells thanks him for the offer but says her friend cannot be moved. When Kim leaves, she looks at a picture of herself and Stacy. Clint does an Internet search for hospitals in Anchorage, KY, and then starts calling them. Kim goes to Cutter's place.
