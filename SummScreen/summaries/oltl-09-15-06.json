Vincent made an ominous comment to Ted that Cris will need a lot more than inspiration to win the fight. Ted told him that \"it's all taken care of.\" After the press left, Vincent walked over to wish Cristian luck. Cristian thanked him for backing him and said it means a lot. Vincent shook his hand and told him he'd do great. Evangeline wished Cristian luck and then went to tell Vincent that she's grateful that he has been there for Cristian, believing in him. Vincent said it's nice of her to say. Later, Vincent snapped at Ted, obviously bothered by what he was doing to Cristian. \n\n\nNash told Claudia he was thinking of buying a vineyard that happened to lie right there in Llanview. It was priced much higher than he could afford, unfortunately. Nash was really downing the booze and Claudia told him to ease up. Nash basically told her to buzz off.\n\n\nBo spied Antonio looking at an engagement ring in the police station locker room. He told Antonio he couldn't be happier. Antonio went home and told Jessica to run over to Capricorn to pick up a laptop he accidentally left there. Jessica walked into the bar and saw Claudia and Nash. She sauntered over to say hello. Claudia got a call from Antonio. He asked if Jessica was there and told her about his plan to propose to her when she returns from the bogus laptop errand. Jessica said good-bye, grabbed the laptop and left. Claudia told Nash to pour himself another drink because Antonio is proposing to Jessica. Despite a bunch of romantic flashbacks of he and Tess, Nash said it was probably for the best.\n\n\nJessica went home to find Antonio there with Jamie and Brennan and balloons strung up all over the apartment. Jamie walked up to Jessica, told her to \"say yes to daddy\" and handed her the ring box. Antonio followed up by getting on a knee and proposing. Jessica said yes.\n\n\nJohn watched as cops searched Spencer's room. He got a call from someone saying that Spencer stopped at an address. John gave the address to Bo who informed him that it was Blair's place. John grabbed a cop and told him to call Spencer's cell phone from the front desk of the hotel and to tell him that cops were upstairs tossing his room. \n\n\nSpencer dropped by to see Blair. She asked him how he would dare show up, but Jack gave the doctor a big hug and told Blair that he called Spencer and invited him over because he misses him and doesn't want to live with Todd any more. Blair sent Jack upstairs so she could talk to Spencer. She told Spencer she was none too pleased that he was using her children that way. Spencer told Blair that she was the biggest mistake he'd ever made and accused her of using sex to get what she wants. Spencer got the call from John's cop and told Blair how his suite was being ransacked, and then left. Jack came back down and asked Blair if Spencer was ever coming back. Blair said no and to not call Spencer any more. He got upset and stomped back upstairs. Later, Kelly dropped by and Blair moaned about her mistakes.\n\n\nJohn told Hugh that Spencer was on his way over and told him to be sure he's ready. When Spencer got to his suite, Hugh was the only one left there. After Spencer yelled and screamed, Hugh told him, \"I'm your son.\" Spencer didn't believe him. Hugh handed him documented proof of his birth and adoption. He assured Spencer that Paige and everyone else would rather Spencer were not his father, but that it simply is the truth. Hugh told Spencer he put his career on the line by not fighting his bail because he wants to help him. He told Spencer that if there is anything at all linking him to Thomas McBain's murder that he better find it and destroy it. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Spencer shows up at Blair's place. Jack comes running and jumps into the man's arms. \"Have you moved back in with Todd?\" Blair will not talk about this in front of her son. She sends him upstairs. \"You have gone too far!\" Blair spits. John and Hugh put their plan into action. They are tossing Spencer's room. They are really making a mess of it, just to make the crazy bastard nuts. John gets a call. Spencer has been spotted at 202 Lincoln Road. Bo calls and he recognizes that address. That is where Blair lives. John has to get Spencer away from her. John sends one of his men to the hotel phone downstairs. \"Call this number and tell the man that there are cops at his apartment.\" Blair tells Spencer that he shouldn't have come. He tells that Jack was the one that called him. She orders him out of her life. He sees clearly that she is finished with him now that she done what she set out to do. \"You use sex to get what you want Blair. I have made a lot of mistakes in my life, but you were the biggest one!\" He gets the call and turns to her again. \"Cops are ransacking my apartment. Are you happy now?\" John learns that Spencer is on his way. \"Are you ready Hugh?\" The officers leave and Spencer enters his apartment. It is completely destroyed. Hugh steps out of the bedroom. Spencer didn't realize that it was the personal job of the DA to see to these things personally. He asks Hugh what he is still doing there. \"I am your son \" Spencer gets immediately angry. He thinks that this is an elaborate trick and that John and Bo have come up with it. Hugh tells him that it isn't. He reminds the man of the courthouse and how he was staring at Spencer, saying that he was trying to see if there were any similarities between them. He hands Spencer the proof that Paige gave him, proving that they were related. Spencer takes the papers and now asks quietly if Hugh is really his son. \"Yes,\" Hugh replies. He tells how he will not be prosecuting the case after all. Even so, Spencer can't understand why Hugh would be coming to him now like this to help him. He wonders what is in it for Hugh. Hugh tells that he has already screwed up by letting to bail money be low. \" I can't do this. I want to help you. I can't send my father to death row. If you have anything that connects you to the Thomas McBain murder, you are to get rid of it, right away!\"",
