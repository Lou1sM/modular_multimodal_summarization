When Langston proudly announced that she would be the newest member of the family, an emotional Starr thought about the child that she was giving up for adoption. In the next room, a delighted Dorian gave the staff detailed instructions on how to decorate the mansion for Langston's adoption party. Dorian relished in her accomplishments - she owned Cramer Enterprises and would soon become Langston's mother. Worried that Dorian might be moving too fast, Blair warned Dorian that an unexpected snag could delay the adoption. She advised Dorian to celebrate after the adoption was finalized. Dorian was adamant about celebrating the same day that Langston agreed to become her daughter. Convinced that nothing could possibly go wrong, Dorian dismissed Blair's fears and continued with her party plans. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Nigel announced to Clint that Jared had arrived with an unsavory character. A devilish smile crossed Clint's face when Jared entered the room with Ray Montez. Ray had questions for Clint. Ray wanted to know what was expected of him and demanded the fee for his services. Clint told Ray that he had already been paid - he had his freedom. He threatened to send Ray back to prison if he didn't cooperate. Clint said that Ray would present himself to Langston as her uncle, and then make an attempt to take custody of her. After Ray made it clear that he had no plans of becoming Langston's guardian, Clint informed him that the scheme wouldn't go that far. Clint further stated that if things went smoothly, Ray would receive a bonus. Ray questioned what Clint would get out of the deal. Refusing to answer Ray's questioning, Clint directed him to the guesthouse and ordered him to clean up so he could carry out his duties. \n\n\nAlone with Clint, Jared informed him that Ray was in prison for murder. Jared warned Clint that he was unleashing a deadly character upon Langston. Refusing to believe that Langston would be harmed by his actions, Clint ignored Jared's pleas and inquired about Natalie. Believing that Nat was avoiding him because of his plot, Clint was curious to learn if Jared had heard from her. After checking his phone messages, Jared mentioned that he hadn't spoken to Nat and dreaded informing her that Montez was a murderer. Reminding Jared that Nat didn't have a guilty conscious when she helped scam the family, Clint had little interest in Nat's concern for Langston. A troubled Jared assured Clint that he had no idea to what degree Natalie was actually suffering. \n\n\nAttempting to ease Jared's fears, Clint promised that after his plan was carried out - Montez would go back to Columbia, Langston would become Dorian's daughter, and Clint would regain control of Buchanan Enterprises. \n\n\nIn the basement of Llanfair, a trapped Nat sat in the secret room Tess had built for her. Tess paid Nat a visit and told her sister that no one was looking for her. Nat was convinced that Jared would search for her, but Tess had plans for Nat. As Nat listened in horror, Tess read a Dear John letter that she had prepared. Nat would copy the letter in her own handwriting and direct it to Jared's attention. Tess would ensure that Jared received Nat's instructions to stay out of her life. When Nat refused to write the letter, Tess threatened to kill Jared. In order to spare Jared's life, Nat complied. With Nat's Dear John letter in hand, Tess left Nat alone to watch Tess's plan unfold. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Sarah arrived and informed Tina that she planned to stay at Llanfair for a while. Worried about Cristian, Sarah sought comfort from her mother. Terrified of Sarah being within Tess's evil grasp, Tina tried to convince her daughter to go back home. Tina warned Sarah that Jessica and Natalie weren't getting along. Sarah couldn't believe that Jess had made an attempt to forgive Nat and Jared. Longing for Cris, Sarah told her mother that she would go after anyone who harmed Cris. As Sarah proclaimed her love for Cris, Tina consoled her daughter. \n\n\nJared returned to Llanfair. An anxious Sarah asked Jared if he had encountered Cris at the airport. When Sarah informed Jared that Cris was missing and Carlo Hesser was suspected in his disappearance, Jared remarked that he heard of Carlo but didn't have any information regarding Cris. Jared asked if Nat knew about Cris. Sarah told him that she hadn't seen Nat. As Nat watched from the secret room, Tess approached and handed Jared the letter. Natalie was distraught as she listened to Jared read the letter. In tears, Nat pleaded with Jared to see through Tess's evil plot. \n\n\nAt the Colombian prison, Cris argued with the guards. Wearing Ray Montez's prison uniform, Cris maintained that he was an American citizen and asked to place a phone call. The guards brought him a cell phone and demanded money. When Cris stated that he didn't have any money, one of the guards shattered the phone into pieces. In a fit of rage, Cris lunged towards the guard. Before Cris could make contact, another guard pulled a gun on him. The guard remarked that Cris wouldn't be speaking with anyone for a long time. \n\n\nAs the guards continued to terrorize Cris, his temper subsided when he entertained thoughts of reuniting with Sarah. Cris vowed to return to her. The guards interrupted Cristian's thoughts when they informed him that his wife had come for a visit. Cris was startled when Mrs. Montez, a beautiful young woman, entered his cell and demanded to know where her husband was. \n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Marcie and Markko arrived for the party. Surprised to learn that Blair had invited Marcie to the celebration, Starr welcomed her with open arms. Although Dorian gave Marcie the third degree concerning her adoption of Starr's baby, Marcie appeared to enjoy bonding with Starr and Blair. Marcie was delighted when Starr allowed her to feel the baby kick. Later, Starr confided in Blair her fear of returning to school pregnant. Blair told her daughter to hold her head up high. \n\n\nAddie, Jack, and Sam joined the party. Addie welcomed Langston into the family. Enjoying the attention from her new family, Langston was on top of the world. As Dorian announced that Langston was her daughter, there was a knock on the door. Claiming to be family, Ray entered the room and introduced himself as Langston's uncle. An eerie silence filled the room. \n\n\nAs Nigel watched, Clint drank a toast to the return of the Buchanan legacy. \n\n\nIn Dr. Joplin's office, the doctor refused to help Todd carry out his plan to steal Starr's baby. Citing that she didn't want to destroy so many lives, Joplin pleaded with Todd to exclude her from his evil scheme. Unconcerned with Joplin's conscience, Todd informed Joplin that he wanted the child and she would do his bidding. Reminding the doctor that he would report her son's past misdeeds to the authorities, Todd warned Joplin to do as she was told. Joplin feared that the child would be killed, but Todd assured her that no harm would come to Starr's child. Fed up with Joplin's lack of cooperation, Todd had a warning for her - his past offenses proved that he didn't like to be screwed with. A terrified Joplin succumbed to Todd's threats. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian calls for a celebration to declare that she is ready to officially adopt Langston. Starr invites Marcie to attend and affirms she wants Marcie to be her child's mother. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Clint has Jared find Langston's uncle and pays him to go and find her and threaten to take her from Dorian. Jared is very uncomfortable helping him with his plan. And Todd is plotting a plan to have Starr's doctor \"stage\" the death of Starr's baby so that nobody will know that Todd and Marty are secretly raising the baby. Tess writes a letter to give to Jared that he will believe is Natalie informing him that she must leave him and go away as not to hurt her family. Natalie knows she is helpless to do anything about it. Sarah is very worried about Cristian. Cristian is in captivity and it seems his captors are going to \"swap\" Langston's uncle who has been released form prison, in exchange for Cristian as their new prisoner assuming the identity of Langston's uncle.",
