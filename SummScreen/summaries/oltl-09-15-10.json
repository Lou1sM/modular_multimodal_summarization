He didn't understand how his search could benefit Dorian, who he knew hated David for abandoning her, but he swiftly changed his tune when Kelly told him the job meant a free trip to Europe.  Rex asked Kelly if she thought Dorian wanted David back despite his MyFace boasts of numerous female conquests, and Kelly said that Dorian was through with David -- she felt all Mayor Lord really needed was payback, so as not to continue to feel powerless.  Kelly explained that she wanted David dragged back to Llanview so Dorian could woo him and make him beg for Dorian to take him back, only to dump him once and for all.\n\n\nRex was skeptical of the plan, but Kelly felt confident that it would give Dorian the closure she needed.  She feared Dorian's behavior at the Palace was symptomatic of the Cramer family's mental illness, and worried that Dorian's depression could lead to a downward spiral if not properly treated.  Rex wondered if Kelly herself was crazy, and warned her that chasing David around the world would cost her.  Kelly reminded Rex that David was updating his MyFace page seemingly every hour, and said she had faith in Rex's abilities as a detective.  Rex couldn't believe Kelly was willing to spend a fortune just so Dorian could find David and dump him again, but Kelly was determined to quell her beloved aunt's despair before it led to something even worse.\n\n\nRex told Kelly her money was too good to refuse, and took the job -- he would find David Vickers, wherever in the world he was.  He explained that he needed the money to help boost the Balsom family finances with Gigi back in school; he wanted to have more funds ready in case Gigi's tuition cost more than she bargained for.  \"You know something, Balsom, you're okay,\" Kelly marveled. \"Gigi's a lucky girl.\"  Kelly and Rex sealed the deal with a handshake, and Kelly asked him where he would start in his search for David.  Rex said he would start where he always started: \"Family.\"\n\n\nAt the St. Kitts hospice, Elijah told Greg that his \"something valuable\" was a girl.  Greg immediately deduced that Eli was talking about Danielle, and Eli explained that his plan had led to Ross and Todd clashing over T\u00e9a's will, which disputed who custody of Dani would go to after T\u00e9a's death.  Greg asked if Eli and Ross had been working together all along, and Eli said that after the police had foiled his original plan, he had adapted and targeted Dani, the most lucrative option available.  \"Todd Manning will pay dearly to hold onto his little girl,\" Eli declared, and said that he had swapped T\u00e9a's will for a forgery, which she had signed, and which had given custody over to Ross without her realizing it.\n\n\nGreg asked Eli if he was planning to ransom Dani to Todd and split the proceeds with Ross.  \"Something like that,\" Eli admitted.  Greg was outraged, and told Eli that his scam wasn't what T\u00e9a had wanted for her daughter; he was playing with a grieving, traumatized girl's life, a girl he claimed to love.  Eli reminded Greg that it was a little late to display \"moral qualms\" after what he had done to T\u00e9a.  \"T\u00e9a isn't -- \" Greg began, then trailed off. \"...What?\" Eli asked.\n\n\nRecovering, Greg told Eli that T\u00e9a wasn't an issue anymore; however, Danielle was an innocent, and didn't deserve to be part of his scheme.  Rising from his hospital bed, Eli calmly said Greg didn't have to be a part of Eli's plan; he could turn around, walk out the door, and forget all about Eli.  But, he added, it would be much wiser for Greg to help fix Eli up and accomplish Eli's goals, and then Eli promised never to bother Greg again.  \"We both know that's not an option,\" Greg muttered, and Eli called him a smart man.\n\n\nGreg asked how Ross would manage to take Dani and walk out of Llanview, given his wanted status.  \"I've taken care of that,\" Eli replied.  Greg agreed to help Eli, but warned that Eli needed to stay in the hospice and recover from his subdural hematoma.  Eli asked how long he would have to convalesce, and accused Greg of stalling his plans.  Greg warned Eli that if he pushed, his hematoma would burst and he would die instantly.\n\n\nEli agreed to trust Greg's diagnosis, and Greg prepared to head back to Llanview for T\u00e9a's memorial service.  \"Give T\u00e9a my respects, too,\" Eli cracked. \"Oh, and Doc?  I hope you're not trying to play me.\"  \"Why would I do that?\" Greg asked, frightened.  Eli replied that he didn't know, but warned the doctor of the consequences if he ever did attempt to double-cross Eli.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Ross confronted Todd and Danielle at Todd's house, and informed them that T\u00e9a's will named him as Dani's legal guardian.  Todd didn't believe it was possible, and Ross presented him with the signed documents legitimizing the claim.  Dani was shocked, and Ross told her that it had been a surprise to him, as well, but he knew that it was what T\u00e9a had wanted for her.  Todd was sure it was a mistake, and reacted violently when Ross embraced Dani.  He ordered Ross to let go of his daughter and get out of his house.\n\n\nDani asked how they could be sure the will was real, and Ross explained that Eli had drawn up the document prior to T\u00e9a's passing, an answer that elicited jeers from Todd.  Ross reminded Todd that Eli had been a lawyer first, serial killer second, and claimed his brother had executed T\u00e9a's wishes to the letter.  Confused, Danielle was unsure of the truth, and Todd demanded Ross fess up to his copy of the will being another con job by the Rayburn brothers.  But Ross pleaded his innocence, and said that he hadn't known anything about the will prior to Eli and T\u00e9a's deaths.  Hugging Dani, he told her how sorry he was about his ex's untimely demise, as Todd looked on, baffled.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian sat in bed with her laptop, fuming over David's alleged MyFace updates.  His latest told of a \"hot night in Hamburg -- this is some foxy frauleins!\"  \"What, David?\" Dorian scoffed, disgusted. \"No overt details?\"  There was a knock at the door, and Blair entered the bedroom, immediately informing her aunt that she didn't want to talk about Eli or Tahiti, but instead T\u00e9a's memorial service.  Blair wanted the Cramers to open their home and their hearts to Dani as an honorary member of the family, and hoped to have the reception after T\u00e9a's service at La Boulaie.\n\n\nNoticing Dorian hiding under the covers, Blair confronted her and asked what was wrong.  Emerging from her cocoon, Dorian recounted her altercation at the Palace with Bo and Nora, and groused about how humiliated she'd felt; she blamed Kelly for making her face the world too soon.  Blair wasn't surprised, and suspected that Dorian was exhibiting symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Dorian realized that Blair had been having a terrible month, as well, particularly her situation with Eli, her serial killer groom -- \"Operas have been written about less,\" the elder Cramer noted.  Blair said that the one-two punch of Eli's betrayal and T\u00e9a's death had nearly crippled her, but working on T\u00e9a's service kept her sane, and gave her a much-needed distraction from her grief and pain.\n\n\nBlair said Dorian needed her own distraction from David's rejection, and ordered her to stop sitting around wallowing in self-pity.  She asked Dorian to help her plan T\u00e9a's service, for Dani's sake.  Dorian told Blair that she was welcome to hold the service at the house, but Dorian wouldn't be there; however, Blair insisted on all the Cramers in residence being present.  Blair said that it was a \"family thing,\" and from then on, they would all be obligated to Dani, in accordance with T\u00e9a's dying wish for Blair to raise the girl.\n\n\nJust then, Todd called Blair and told her it was an emergency, and he needed her right away.  Blair rushed off to deal with Todd's latest crisis.\n\n\nAt Todd's, Ross told Danielle he had missed her very much.  \"I missed you too,\" Dani replied, uncertain.  \"We're gonna be together forever,\" Ross promised, and said they would finally have the life together T\u00e9a had wanted them to have.  Sulking in the doorway, Todd asked Ross how that would be possible with Ross's wanted status in Seattle.\n\n\nBlair arrived and was stunned to see Ross back in the States.  She asked how he had escaped custody in Tahiti, and Todd presented her with T\u00e9a's will naming Ross as Dani's father.  Blair didn't understand what she was reading; she knew what T\u00e9a had wanted, and she was positive T\u00e9a had asked for Todd to get custody with Blair as backup legal guardian.  Ross replied that Blair was still in the document, but he would be primary custodian instead of Todd.  Neither Todd nor Blair bought Ross's argument, and as they bickered with the con man, Danielle grew hysterical, asking them who she was to live with, and who her mother had wanted to raise her.\n\n\nBlair soothed Danielle, and told Ross that she didn't care what was written in the will -- she had promised T\u00e9a she would be a mother to Dani, and that was exactly what she would do.  \"Call the cops, Todd,\" she ordered, and Todd complied.  Ross begged him to stop, and asked him to think of Dani.  Dani pleaded with Todd, reminding him of his promise to let Ross go free, but Todd said he no longer had a choice.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Renee let John and Natalie into Eli's old suite on police business.  She wasn't sure what was left for them to investigate with Eli dead, but John claimed it was merely a routine follow-up.  After Renee left them alone, Natalie asked John why they hadn't told Renee the truth about their search for a DNA sample.  John explained that there was no need to scare anyone until they acquired proof of whether Eli was dead or alive.\n\n\nAs the crime-busting couple combed the room, they found themselves stymied; Natalie couldn't find a single trace of Eli, but John was sure that no criminal got away clean.  Natalie said that even if they found something of Eli's, they would have to compare it against the burnt corpse in Tahiti.  John informed her that they weren't going to Tahiti together, because Natalie wasn't going anywhere.  Natalie told her beau that he needed her forensics expertise, but John reminded her that she was pregnant, and didn't need to be flying or taking any unnecessary risks, even in her first trimester.  Natalie couldn't imagine what risks there were -- she was pregnant, not an invalid -- and asked John what was the worst that could possibly happen.\n\n\nAs John grew silent and morose, Natalie realized her mistake, and acknowledged his fear of history repeating itself in a miscarriage like John and Marty's recent loss.  She apologized for putting her foot in her mouth, but John said she hadn't done anything wrong, and he simply didn't want her to be reckless.  \"Me?\" Natalie quipped.  Turning serious, she promised to stay behind for his sake; she understood his concern, and she was touched that he cared so much.  Natalie promised John that the baby would be first, always.\n\n\nJust then, John's phone rang, and Todd ordered him to help deal with Ross Rayburn.  Exasperated, John made tracks for Todd's house.\n\n\nNatalie continued to search Eli's room alone, but Renee interrupted her and had hoped to congratulate both John and Natalie on Natalie's pregnancy.  She told Natalie how much the baby would have meant to Asa, who had always known Natalie was a true Buchanan with a good head on her shoulders.  Renee warned Natalie that the baby would be one tough cookie, \"one half Buchanan, one half McBain.\"  Natalie said she was proud to carry Asa's great-grandchild, and admitted she missed him terribly.  Renee told her that Asa would live on in Natalie's \"little one.\"\n\n\nNatalie was irritated at the lack of clues in the room, and told Renee it was as though Eli had never even been in the suite.  She was sure she was missing a vital clue.  Renee bemoaned Eli's two-faced nature, and said he had seemed like such a nice man, even when he and Blair were demolishing furniture in their sexcapades; in fact, he had passed out envelopes and tipped all the hotel staff on his way out of town in thanks for their help in cleaning up the mess.  Her interest piqued, Natalie asked Renee if the envelopes had been sealed, and if there were any left.  When Renee said one envelope was still unclaimed, Natalie asked for it, and said it could be very important.\n\n\nLater, Natalie was alone in the darkened suite, bagging Eli's sealed envelope.  She envisioned Eli sitting at his desk, licking the envelope closed.  \"That's our DNA evidence,\" she said triumphantly.  It was just as John had told her -- no one got away clean, and there was always one fatal mistake.\n\n\nIn the Palace restaurant, Clint and Inez attempted to tempt Bo and Nora into staying longer for their dinner by dangling the promise of Nora's favorite dessert, baked Alaska.  Bo quickly took his wife aside, suspicious of Clint's motives.  Nora, still preoccupied by the prospect of baked Alaska, was sure Clint was merely hoping to reach out to them.  \"Plus, it's baked Alaska!\" she reasoned.  \"Why didn't you tell me you wanted baked Alaska?\" Bo groused. \"We could've ordered it ourselves!\"\n\n\nNora didn't see the harm in Clint's overtures towards Matthew and Inez, and Bo finally relented in the face of her reasoning.  Turning to Clint, he agreed to stay, only for Inez to inform the trio that she had to leave and tend to Nate.  Clint asked her to stay longer, but Inez thanked him for the night out.  Clint told her he hoped they could do it again.\n\n\nAs Inez left, Clint blamed Bo for scaring off his date with the obvious tension between the three of them.  \"That's not fair,\" Nora replied, but Clint needled Bo, asking if he had overstepped his bounds with his brother and his ex-wife by offering a hand to both Bo's son and new assistant.  Bo snapped that he wasn't angry at all, and asked what more Clint wanted from him after he had let Matthew take the job at Buchanan Enterprises.  Clint asked if Bo was fine with his courtship of Inez as well.  Fuming, Bo insisted he had no objection; Inez was a grown woman and could make her own choices.\n\n\nStressing the baked Alaska, Nora persuaded Bo to stay and finish their meal.  Just then, Rex arrived and asked the Buchanan brothers if they knew where David was.  When Rex explained that Kelly had hired them to find the wayward Buchanan scion, Clint's ears perked up, and he asked what Kelly wanted with David.  Rex said that Kelly felt Dorian needed to find a way past her grief over David, and Nora agreed that Dorian was falling apart.\n\n\nBo told Rex he didn't have any idea where David was, and didn't expect to hear from his prodigal son.  Nora invited Rex to stay for some baked Alaska.  \"Yeah, I love things that are flaming!\" Rex replied excitedly, but his face fell when he realized he was still \"on the clock\" and had to get back to work.  As Rex left the dining area, Clint quickly told Bo and Nora he was taking his leave, as well, and departed.\n\n\nWith Clint gone, Bo and Nora sat alone at their table, with Nora lamenting the loss of her promised baked Alaska.  Bo seethed over Clint's insinuation into their lives, and told Nora he felt Clint was getting \"too close for comfort.\"  Nora felt Clint was merely hoping to normalize the situation between the three of them and stop making them his enemies, and told Bo they needed to encourage Clint's generosity.  Bo agreed, but warned Nora that she also needed to stop feeling guilty about leaving Clint -- they were married, and happy, and what was done was done.  Glad for it, Nora gave Bo a kiss.\n\n\nBo and Nora were startled to realize Clint had stiffed them with the check for dinner.  Bo was irritated at the exorbitant amount Clint had spent on wine for him and Inez, but Nora said Clint had every right to pursue the fetching single mom.  However, Bo still couldn't help but think Clint was attempting to stick it to them.  \"He did,\" Nora said, eyeing the check. \"And I don't blame him.\"\n\n\nIn the lobby, Clint intercepted Rex on his way out of the hotel.  He suggested that everyone in Llanview would be better off if David stayed gone, and reminded Rex that David was a reckless, destructive troublemaker.  He was sure Dorian would be much better off without her ex.  When Rex noted Clint's extreme dislike of his newfound nephew and recalled Clint's outburst at Bo and Nora's wedding, Clint agreed that he had good reason to hate David for costing him his marriage to Kim.  As Clint stormed off, he told Rex that if he ever saw David again it would be too soon.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Kelly knocked before entering Dorian's room, bearing apologies.  She was sorry she had forced Dorian to face the public so soon.  Dorian primly accepted Kelly's penitence, but said the only thing that could make her feel better was telling David off.  \"What if you could?\" Kelly asked.\n\n\n\"Kelly dear, keep it real,\" Dorian sighed, and said that David was long gone, globetrotting around the world; she couldn't face him even if she wanted to.  Kelly asked Dorian to pretend that Kelly was David, and channel her anger into Kelly.  Dorian said she didn't need \"psychobabble\" to deal with her problems, but Kelly insisted it would be therapeutic to get revenge on the man who had broken her heart twice over.  \"Don't tempt me,\" Dorian growled. \"I wanna deck the guy.\"  \"Okay,\" Kelly replied. \"Slug me!\"\n\n\nGrabbing a throw pillow for protection, Kelly urged the reluctant Dorian to attack her as though she were David.  Launching into an imitation of David, Kelly listed David's many youthful conquests, and called Dorian a \"battleaxe\" David was glad to be rid of.  Dorian's temper boiled over and she slammed her fist into the pillow over Kelly's midsection, causing Kelly to fall back onto the bed.  Dorian rushed to Kelly's side, apologizing for her outburst, but a breathless Kelly insisted that it was fine, and asked if Dorian felt better.  Dorian said she did, and gave her niece a high-five.\n\n\nDorian told Kelly that her pillow fight was her only solace, as she would never be able to confront David for real with him traveling across Europe.  \"You never know,\" Kelly mused. \"Life is full of surprises.\"\n\n\nBack at Todd's house, Dani was furious that Todd had called the cops on Ross.  Todd and Blair struggled to calm her, but Dani clung to Ross, fearful that he would be sent back to prison.  Ross consoled her as Dani told him that he was her dad who had raised her; he was all she had left with her mother gone.  Blair reminded Dani of what Ross had done to them in Seattle, but Dani said that her foster dad had been desperate.  Blair told her to take a long, hard look at Ross; he had doctored T\u00e9a's will, and what he was doing was wrong.\n\n\nDani begged Ross to flee before the police arrived, but Ross told her that Todd and Blair were right; he needed to face the music for his crimes and move forward.  Holding Dani, he promised never to turn his back on her again.  Todd didn't buy his \"noble act,\" and said Ross was only afraid of being apprehended once more.\n\n\nJohn arrived with a uniformed officer, who handcuffed Ross.  Todd showed John T\u00e9a's \"will,\" and ordered Ross to be charged with fraud.  As John alerted the Seattle police to Ross's arrest, the strangely calm Ross told Dani everything would be fine.  Blair wanted to take Dani back to La Boulaie, but Dani insisted on remaining with Ross until she found out the truth about T\u00e9a's last wishes.\n\n\nGetting off the phone, John gave Todd and Blair bad news: there were no outstanding warrants for Ross in Seattle, as the charges against him had been dropped.  Todd blamed Eli's legal chicanery, and he and Blair demanded justice.  \"That son of a bitch is guilty!\" Todd yelled.  John said there was nothing he could do, and told Ross he was free to go.  Ross smiled at Dani as he was uncuffed.\n\n\nPowerless, Todd and Blair watched as Ross and Dani hugged.  Ross told Dani he had missed her terribly.  \"Come on,\" he said. \"I'm gonna take you home.\" \n\n\n",
