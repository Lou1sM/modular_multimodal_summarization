He hid Kim in the bathroom, and opened the door to Roxy. He told her that he'd paid for the porcupine fair and square, but Roxy refused to leave without it. She was angry that he'd \"gypped\" her, so he said he'd pay her the extra ninety-nine dollars she'd wanted. She refused it, and wanted Morris back instead, because she claimed that the porcupine was her good luck charm.\n\n\nRoxy offered the dollar back that Cutter had paid for Morris, but he refused. Cutter claimed that Aubrey had fallen in love with Morris. As Kim listened in, Roxy said she needed Morris back because the porcupine's spikes were dangerous. He told her that it was time for her to go, so he pushed her out the door, and closed it behind her.\n\n\nKim scolded Cutter for torturing Roxy. She wondered why Cutter hadn't given the porcupine back, because she knew that Aubrey wasn't a fan. She tried to pick Morris up, but Cutter stopped her. She demanded to know what was in the porcupine. He told her of his theory about Rex shooting Victor, and his \"moms\" trying to cover it up. Kim thought the situation was perfect.\n\n\nKim explained how she'd gone to Clint for financial help, but she'd found that he'd lost all of his money to Rex. She knew that blackmailing Rex would solve all their money problems. However, Cutter told her that he'd promised Aubrey to \"go straight.\" \"Well, I didn't promise her a damn thing,\" Kim replied. She went to put the gun in her purse, but Cutter stopped her. He had to go to work, but refused to leave her alone with the gun.\n\n\nCutter pushed Kim out the door, and made sure the door was locked. When Cutter walked away, Kim returned in front of the door. She attempted to open the door, using a credit card.\n\n\nEcho saw a \"missing\" flyer for Morris, and thought back to her conversation with Roxy about hiding Rex's gun. Rex walked up to Echo, breaking her thoughts. She remarked that it looked like Rex had seen a ghost. The two sat down in the diner, and Rex explained how he'd seen Gigi in the cemetery. She'd again told him not to give up. Rex didn't believe in ghosts, so Echo suggested that it was Rex imagining her to assure himself that Gigi wouldn't be forgotten.\n\n\nRex disclosed that Madame Delphina had told Rex that if he wanted to know what Gigi had meant, he should ask Clint. Echo reasoned that Gigi wanted Rex to spend more time with his father, but Rex was skeptical. Rex admitted to having a \"moment\" with Clint, when Clint had visited the Buchanan mansion for the anniversary of Asa's death.\n\n\nChanging the subject to the Mannings, Rex made sure that Echo had gotten rid of the gun. \"Yeah,\" she replied uneasily. Rex remembered that Victor's funeral was that day, and stated that Jack finally knew what it felt like to lose a parent like Shane did. Echo told him that he could let his grudge go. \"For now,\" he answered. He had more important things to do, like finding Gigi. Echo didn't think he had any other choice but to talk to Clint about it.\n\n\nA short while later, Echo bumped into Roxy outside the diner. Roxy sputtered that Cutter had Morris, but he wouldn't give the porcupine back. Echo realized that she had to do something.\n\n\nA short while later, Kim answered Echo's knocks on Cutter's door. Kim offered her help. As Echo was about to refuse it, she spotted Morris in the room. She entered the room, and told Kim that she collected porcupines, and that Morris looked like a \"perfect specimen.\" Kim was happy to help Echo.\n\n\nDani asked Blair where T\u00e9a was, because they needed to get to the church for Victor's funeral. T\u00e9a walked down the stairs and past them in her robe, looking miserable. Blair told Dani to go to the church, and Blair and T\u00e9a would be there shortly. Dani left, and Blair found T\u00e9a lying on the couch. Blair said that T\u00e9a needed to get dressed to get to the church, but T\u00e9a said that she couldn't. Blair appealed to T\u00e9a that both she and Dani needed T\u00e9a. \"I couldn't get through it without you,\" Blair said. \"If you can't do it, I can't.\"\n\n\nBlair explained that Sam hadn't understood when she'd told him that his father had died. She needed T\u00e9a to get showered, dressed, and out to the church, \"even if I have to get naked and get in the shower with you.\" She pulled T\u00e9a up off the couch, and steered her up the stairs. A short while later, both women descended the stairs, dressed and ready. Blair promised that the day would soon be over, and led T\u00e9a out of the house. \"You know, you really are a pain in my ass,\" T\u00e9a said, and Blair nodded.\n\n\nViki told Jessica that she'd meet her daughter at the church, so Jessica left. Viki entered the living room just as Clint mentioned Kim's name in a phone conversation with the hospital in Kentucky. He hung up the phone, and was surprised to find that Viki hadn't yet gone to the church. Clint wondered if Viki had heard him mention Kim's name, but knew that she must have gotten \"an earful\" from Natalie. He told Viki about all that had been going on with Kim, and her sick friend. He related that any day he could put a smile on Kim's face was a good day.\n\n\nViki warned Clint to be careful, because the information David had on Kim had to have been \"potent\" to scare her away so easily. Viki worried about Clint, but he promised that Kim wouldn't pull him back in. Viki told him that she considered him her closest and dearest friend. Clint told her to go, because she would be late for the funeral. Viki related that she had no idea what to say in her eulogy, but Clint was confident that she'd find the right words.\n\n\nViki was glad that Clint was staying with her, because she liked having someone who understood her to talk to. She wanted him to promise to take care of himself. \"For you, anything,\" he replied. He expressed his sympathy for Viki's loss, and Viki left.\n\n\nA short while later, Clint was arguing on the phone with someone from the hospital in Kentucky. When they wouldn't give him any information, he tried to use his name as clout. \"Don't you know who I am?\" he shouted into the phone, as Rex entered. Rex answered that Clint was a broke convict with a monitor around his ankle, and someone else's heart in his chest. Clint informed Rex that Natalie had moved out of the house, but Rex revealed that he was there to see Clint.\n\n\nSam asked Starr why a picture of his dad was up in the church. Starr replied that Victor couldn't be there, but the day would be all about him. Sam wanted his father there, but Starr swore that if he were quiet enough, he'd be able to hear Victor talk to him. \"It's not the same,\" Sam replied. Starr replied that Victor would always be watching over them.\n\n\nSam worried that Victor had seen Sam take candy from someone earlier. James was sure that Victor wouldn't mind Sam having a little candy. Sam explained that he was holding a Philadelphia Phillies baseball card because his father had promised to take him to a game, \"without Jack.\" James knew he wouldn't replace Victor, but offered to take Sam to a game. Sam excitedly agreed.\n\n\nOn the phone, Jack demanded to know if there had been an arrest in the Victor Lord murder case. Clearly getting a displeasing answer, Jack shouted that there was something wrong with \"you people.\" Shaun entered the church, and wondered what was going on with Jack. Jack expressed his discontent that Todd hadn't yet been arrested for Victor's murder. Shaun remembered that there hadn't been enough evidence. Jack replied that there was enough evidence, so Shaun asked him to elaborate. Just then, Jessica entered and hugged Jack. She expressed her sympathy as Dani entered. Shaun promised to talk to Jack later, and walked into the church with Jessica.\n\n\nShaun picked Sam up and carried him away, saying that they should find seats. Starr thanked James for making Sam smile. He told her that her family was his family, and he also felt like he owed Victor. Victor had reached out to James after finding out that Eddie had beaten up on James. Starr reminded James that Victor had been brainwashed to think that Peter had beaten him. Starr suddenly realized that Dani, T\u00e9a, Viki, and Blair were still missing.\n\n\nJack wanted to talk to Dani about Todd being Victor's murderer. Dani admitted that she didn't know what to think. She related that there was no concrete evidence. Jack blurted out that an eyewitness had surfaced. Dani demanded to know who it was. Avoiding the question, Jack wondered whose side Dani was on. Just then, Starr ushered her siblings into the church.\n\n\nA short while later, Viki hugged Sam, and told him that he had wonderful sisters. Dani asked Starr if T\u00e9a was at the church, because Dani was starting to get worried. Just as Dani wondered what she'd do without her mother, Blair and T\u00e9a entered. T\u00e9a hugged Dani, and Blair asked Starr how Sam was doing. Starr replied that James had been very good with Sam. Blair caught sight of Jack and hugged him, saying that the family needed to stick together. Everyone sat as a preacher said a prayer.\n\n\nMoments later, Viki stood to speak. Viki said that no one had known who Victor really was until the previous few weeks, but he'd been \"very real.\" She related that he hadn't been perfect, but that he had loved his family, and especially his kids. The family always had forgiven Victor for his wrongs because they'd loved him, and always would. Viki sat back down.\n\n\nA short while later, the mourners gathered at Victor's grave with flowers in hand. Sam put his baseball card on top of the grave. One by one, each mourner placed a flower on the grave, eventually leaving only T\u00e9a, Blair, and Jack. Blair said goodbye to Victor, and that she loved him. She hugged T\u00e9a as Jack walked away. T\u00e9a stared at the grave, and expressed her disbelief that Victor was gone. She told Blair to take the kids to Capricorn, and that she'd catch up. Blair kissed her on the cheek, and walked away. T\u00e9a fell to her knees next to the grave.\n\n\nA short while later, a man entered the dark church, and stared at Victor's picture. The man walked up the aisle towards the picture. T\u00e9a entered the church, and saw the man. \"Victor?\" she asked hopefully.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Current Todd's funeral is underway. Everybody in his family is able to get there except for Tea who is too distraught to face it but with the help of Blair who motivates her, she gets there. Jack is determined to get original Todd charged with murder and is very dissatisfied with the fact that the cops have not arrested him. Shaun finds out that Jack assumes he \"knows\" something that Shaun questions how he could know since Jack did not hear his tape, regarding what happened when Victor got shot. Roxy goes to find Morris the porcupine when she learns that Cutter has him and furiously fights to get him back before it's too late for Rex. Knowing why she might have a \"desperate situation\" but that she doesn't want to implicate her son, Cutter asks her why she's freaking out over a porcupine and dismisses her. Kim then finds out the gun is in the porcupine and after overhearing Cutter's interaction with Roxy, knows her brother's theory must be correct. They conclude that Rex killed Victor Lord, as he had motive and Roxy has hidden the gun in the porcupine and now realizes Cutter has it and needs it back to save her son from murder charges. And Kim also sees a good way to \"motivate\" Rex before Cutter has a chance to.",
