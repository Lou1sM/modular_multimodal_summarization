    "soap_central": "\nTess, Lies, and Videotape\n\n\nIn Colombia, Cristian was introduced to Ray Montez's beautiful wife, who took one look at him and exclaimed (in Spanish), \"Who the hell is this?\" The guards insisted that the man was Ray Montez, but Cristian continued to assert his own identity. Mrs. Montez sent the guards away and spoke to Cris alone, demanding to know where her husband was. She suspected that he was a fellow prisoner who had murdered Ray and taken his uniform, but Cris said he had never met Ray. Cristian explained his situation to Mrs. Montez, and said he was a kidnapped American citizen. He begged her to use her phone to contact the American authorities and Antonio, and get the full story. Mrs. Montez, frightened and confused, feared that the entire scenario was a trap to endanger her or Ray, and said she couldn't commit to doing anything for him with her husband still missing. She called for the guards and prepared to leave. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie watched in frustration as the scene in the drawing room played out on Tess's closed-circuit television. Jared read Natalie's fake \"Dear John\" letter for himself, and was flabbergasted; he couldn't believe Natalie would suddenly leave town over their argument, especially after making peace at the airport. As Tess tried to subtly convince Jared that the letter was legit, Natalie added her own running commentary from inside the secret room, talking back to the TV, urging Jared not to believe her. \"Jared, it's not true,\" Tina chimed in. \"Natalie would never leave you.\" As Tina and Tess each fought to make Jared see things their way, Tess invoked the threat of Carlo again as she \"reflected on the family's troubles.\" With the danger to Sarah fresh in her mind, Tina backed down, and agreed to go with Sarah to check with the Llanview Police Department on the progress of the search for Cristian. \n\n\nOnce Tina and Sarah were gone, Tess worked on Jared alone, and claimed that Natalie's guilt and anguish over the family situation had gotten the better of her while Jared was away. Her soothsaying had little effect; Jared was convinced the letter was a fake, and that someone had forced Natalie to write it. As Natalie rejoiced below, Jared fingered the wrong culprit, blaming the letter on Clint. He thought Clint had planned to take Natalie out of play while Jared was in Colombia, and said that after their reconciliation at the airport, Jared could never believe that the passionate Natalie he loved would hide her pain from him. Tess made a show of blaming herself, and said that her own heartache over Nash had only made Natalie feel worse while Jared was doing Clint's bidding. She said that Natalie didn't leave because of Clint -- she left because of her own grief. Tess \"sadly\" declared that Jared was in denial about Natalie's letter, and reminded him that with Natalie gone, it was \"just us now.\" As she put her arm around a skeptical Jared, she promised that they would \"take care of each other.\" Enraged, Natalie threw her pillows around the secret room. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Ray introduced himself to Langston and the surprised Cramers, and said he would know Langston anywhere, due to her physical resemblance to his late sister, Linda-Langston's mother. He told Langston it was a pleasure to meet her, and drew the stunned young girl into an awkward embrace. The rest of the party reacted badly, as Blair summoned Shaun, and Markko grabbed Ray and threw him up against the wall. Dorian wanted Shaun to throw Ray out, but Ray continued to insist that he came in peace and could verify his identity. Addie came to Ray's defense, speaking a little Spanish with him and flirting up a storm; she said she saw the resemblance between Langston and Montez herself. \n\n\nLangston asked Dorian to let them hear Ray out. Ray then produced an ancient photograph of himself with Linda from many years before; Langston recognized the photograph, and explained that she had seen it in her parents' things, and her mother had reacted badly to Langston's questions about it. Ray told Langston that he and Linda had become estranged over her marriage to \"the Americano,\" and had both been too proud to clear the air before her death. When Dorian asked Ray where he'd been over the years, Ray made sure not to bring up prison, and instead said he had moved on with his life, with no idea of Langston's existence until reading about Dorian in a magazine and recognizing the name \"Langston Wilde.\" Ray said that he knew Linda had married a man named Wilde, and that Langston Hughes was her favorite poet. When he quoted Linda's favorite Hughes poem to Langston, the young girl was touched. Ray said he had tracked Langston from the article, and learned about his sister's death and Langston's new family. Dorian was sure Ray was a con man, but Ray insisted that his only reason for coming to Llanview was to get to know his niece. \n\n\nAs Langston softened to her uncle, she sat with him as the Cramers watched, and spoke quietly with Ray in Spanish about her mother's youth in Colombia. Unnerved, Dorian cut in, telling Langston to get to bed to prepare for the first day of school. Langston wanted to put Ray up at La Boulaie, but Ray said he had other accommodations and promised to see her soon. He gave her the old picture of himself with Linda, to which an emotional Langston replied, \"Gracias...Tio.\" Ray kissed his niece's hand and left, as the elder Cramer women watched. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint communed with Asa as he gazed at \"Pa's\" picture, and told his father, \"I did what you would've done\" in order to wrest control of Buchanan Enterprises away from Dorian and save the family empire. He was certain that Ray's arrival would mean Dorian's downfall. He blamed Jared for starting the entire mess, but when Nigel entered and overheard, the anxious butler felt compelled to confess his role in the \"Buchanan heir\" scheme. He told Clint that it was unfair to only blame Jared and Natalie, when Nigel had kept David Vickers's identity secret the longest, and had made a command decision for the family's security, choosing Jared as \"the lesser of two evils.\" The butler said he blamed himself for the entire fiasco that had led to the loss of Buchanan Enterprises. Nigel handed in a letter of resignation, but Clint tore up the letter and told Nigel he could understand his reasoning and motivations. He said that the only thing he required from Nigel was the same unquestioning loyalty and transparency that Nigel had given Asa. Nigel agreed. \"It's as if Mr. Buchanan himself had spoken,\" he declared. \n\n\nAt the LPD station, Bo and John exchanged notes on the search for Cristian; John told Bo that Antonio and Talia had found no trace of Cris at airports in the States. He told Bo they did have one lead, and held up a DVD. When Tina and Sarah arrived on the scene, anxious for news, the two cops showed them the DVD's contents: surveillance footage of the international airport where Cristian had disappeared, showing Cris being led away by the faux \"airline official\" who had lured him into a trap. Though footage of the actual kidnapping was nowhere to be found, all four were positive that that man had helped abduct Cris for Carlo. Bo promised Sarah and Tina that they would find Cristian no matter what. In private, Sarah reviewed the footage over and over, growing more and more frightened. \n\n\nBack in Bo's office, John stole a moment with Tina before Bo returned. He told her he knew she was the woman at Ramsey's penthouse in June, and that they wouldn't discuss it further, \"for now.\" Bo came back in and shared a happy reunion with Tina, assuring her that everything would be all right. He asked her how things were at Llanfair with Jessica. Evasive, Tina mumbled that \"Jessica\" had \"good days and bad days.\" Bo got Tina to admit that Jessica was \"not herself,\" and said he'd sensed the same when he met with her not long before. Bo openly questioned the possibility of whether Jessica's dissociative identity disorder could have returned, and asked Tina if she'd seen any signs of abnormal behavior. Tina was desperate to spill the beans, but she flashed back to Tess's warning about Carlo coming after Sarah again, and forced herself to cover for \"Jessica's\" behavior yet again, blaming it on grief and hormones. She asked Bo to get police protection for Sarah from Hesser, and then hustled out to leave with her daughter. \n\n\nEvents unfolded in a montage at the same time both in Llanview, and in Colombia: Mrs. Montez exited, leaving Cristian at the mercy of the guards in Plato Prison. In Llanview, Clint mused over his file on Ray Montez, while at the LPD, Sarah tore her gaze away from the surveillance footage of Cristian to leave with Tina. In Bo's office, John and Bo identified the ex-con who had posed as an airline official. And at La Boulaie, the Cramer women toasted Langston's adoption again, while Langston moved away from the crowd to gaze at the faded picture of Ray Montez and her mother, leaving Dorian to watch her with concern and trepidation. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ray Montez goes to interrupt Langston's adoption celebration to inform her that he wants to have a relationship with him. Dorian does not trust a word he says. But Langston does. He proves that he really is her uncle and appears as charming and convincing as Clint has instructed him to be. Meanwhile, Ray's wife goes to the prison where he's vacated from and notices Cristian Vega in her husband's place. Cristian urges her to call his brother and the cops in Llanview. They might be able to help her find her husband if she can help him get out of there. But she does not trust him. Tess plays Jessica and attempts to get Jared to believe that Natalie has dumped him and wrote him a letter. But he knows that she would not do that. Tina is ready to spill the beans to Jared. But she knows she must help her daughter find Cristian. When the talk to Bo and John, Tina is ready to tell Bo what has happened to Jessica. But remembering that Tess threatened to expose both her and Sara to Carlo Hesser if she does, Tina then realizes she better not. Nigel then admits to Clint that he helped Jared scam them. But Clint is not angry at Nigel. He asks him to keep doing the job he did for Asa and have the same loyalty for him that he had for his father.",
