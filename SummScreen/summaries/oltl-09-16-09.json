Then, he examined four medal cases on his desk.  An officer entered the office and told him that the men he wanted had taken the day off.  Bo wasn't worried; he said he had a plan to bring those men in.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr and Cole rejoiced in being together again, safe and sound.  Cole wanted to get more \"alone time\" with Starr, but Starr cryptically said they had other obligations for the day.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Langston and Dorian had breakfast.  Langston was stunned that Mayor Lowell had turned out to be the ringleader behind the drug trafficking.  Starr and Cole entered, and asked Dorian about Shaun.  Dorian told them that Shaun's prognosis wasn't good.  The teens were angered at the thought that Todd had gone to Lowell, blowing Cole's cover and leaving Starr, Hope, and Shaun in danger.\n\n\nSquirming, Dorian admitted that she was the one responsible for outing Cole to Lowell.  The kids were incensed, but Dorian said she hadn't known about Lowell's crimes and had meant no harm.  She begged their forgiveness, which they grudgingly gave.  Dorian tore into Lowell, calling him an arrogant narcissist.  The kids couldn't believe that Lowell had yet to resign, and Langston was shocked when Dorian haltingly revealed that she had yet to quit as his campaign manager.  Under pressure from her daughter, Dorian agreed to confront Lowell at the police station, quit, and singlehandedly force him to resign.\n\n\nAfter Dorian flounced out, Starr convinced Cole to get dressed up in a suit.  Cole didn't understand why the pomp and circumstance was needed to visit the station and give a simple statement, but Starr fibbed and said he had to look his best.  As Langston took in Hope, and Cole walked to the car, Starr and Langston enjoyed a private secret.  Starr said Cole didn't suspect a thing, and Langston promised that she would watch everything on television.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Viki and Charlie greeted Jessica and the recovering Brody in Brody's hospital room.  The Bankses were full of praise for Brody's heroics, and pleased to learn Brody intended to stay on the force.  Jessica was furious at the thought that someone had exposed Cole to Mayor Lowell, and that had led to the kidnapping of Starr and Hope.  Viki said that whoever had named Cole needed to be locked up.  \n\n\nCharlie brought up the mayoral race, realizing that with Lowell behind bars, Viki would be running unopposed.  Viki wasn't so sure, and reminded them that Lowell had refused to resign.  Jessica was outraged, and said he was responsible for everything that had happened to Starr and \"Chloe\" -- then corrected herself by saying \"Hope.\"  As Viki comforted her, Jessica tearfully admitted that Hope was still very close to her heart.  Brody said he'd known that when he'd gone on his rescue mission, and would've done anything to protect the people Jessica loved.\n\n\nAt the station, David and his camera crew, consisting of Ford and Markko, accosted Bo in his office.  \"It's 'Take Your Kid To Work Day!'\" David declared.  David introduced his reluctant father to the camera, and called him a local hero.  Bo barked at the crew to get out, banishing them from the room.  David remained, eager to connect to \"Dad\" any way he could.  David said he knew Bo was just lashing out at David because Bo was angry with Matthew over the lawsuit, but Bo said that wasn't true.  David noticed the medals of honor laid out on Bo's desk, and snatched one up over his father's protests.  Approaching his tense father, David awkwardly pinned one of the medals to Bo's chest, and said that no matter what Bo thought of him, he knew his father deserved a commendation as much as his officers, even if he would never admit it.\n\n\nAt John's apartment, John and Marty basked in the afterglow of their second night together.  Sated, Marty told John it was even better than she'd remembered.  John told her he was taking the day off and urged her to do the same.  Marty said she had patients, but could fit one more round of lovemaking in.  Afterwards, noticing he was distracted, Marty told John that he wasn't responsible for Shaun's condition.  She told him to go to work, and bask in the glory of having done something good.  John could tell Marty was up to something, but she remained coy.\n\n\nAt Fish's apartment, Oliver awoke to find Cristian and Layla making a celebratory breakfast for the conquering hero, complete with a framed copy of the  Sun.  Fish was touched by his roommates' gesture, and Cris and Layla assured him he deserved it for his courage.  Layla told Fish that Bo had ordered him into work, even though, like John, he'd wanted to take the day off.  Oliver moaned that he was stressed enough with his parents coming to town, as they were still unaware of his sexual orientation.  When Cristian presented him with the How To Tell Your Parents You're Gay book, Oliver freaked out, and said he couldn't possibly come out to his ultra-conservative family.  Cristian agreed to leave it up to him.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Cafe, Kyle and Roxy enjoyed a meal together.  Roxy said she hadn't seen Kyle in awhile, and asked if he and Fish had reunited.  Referring to Nick, Kyle said he was seeing someone else, who'd encouraged him to clean up his act and get re-admitted to medical school.  He wished he could share his new life with Oliver, but said that his ex was too deeply closeted to associate with him again.\n\n\nBack at John's, John and Marty dressed.  When John stepped outside, he found David and his crew on his doorstep.  David began yammering into the camera about the black-garbed knight of Llanview, but didn't get far before John flung him down the hallway and slammed the door in the trio's faces.\n\n\nFed up, Ford told David the reality show was over.  Markko said he couldn't miss his first day of college classes, and Ford blamed David for blowing their budget on paying Matthew's legal fees.  David couldn't believe his dream was dying.  \"We're done, David,\" Ford said, walking out.\n\n\nInside John's apartment, Marty pushed him once more to go down to the station.  John finally agreed.\n\n\nAt the Lllanview Police Station, Dorian navigated a media circus to enter Bo's office.  She asked him what the crowd was for, and Bo said there was going to be a press conference about the undercover operation.  Bo confronted Dorian about blowing Cole's cover, and Dorian insisted it was an honest mistake.  Bo teased her, suggesting she go down to the cell block with him and convince Mayor Lowell to resign his office.  Dorian asked Bo if he intended to lock her up, as well.  \"Don't tempt me,\" Bo cracked.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston welcomed Markko with a kiss.  Markko said he had to get to class, but Langston convinced him to hang around long enough to see Cole on TV.\n\n\nBack at the station, Starr and Cole arrived with Hope.  Cole was curious about the media, but Bo said it was just for his press conference and asked for Cole to wait a few minutes.  As John reported for work, Bo grabbed him on his way to his office and told him to hang around, as well.  John was itchy to get away from the cameras, but was surprised when Marty appeared and said she didn't have any patients, after all.  Finally, Fish arrived with Layla on his heels, and asked what Bo needed.  Bo told Oliver to wait, too.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Jessica turned on the television set in Brody's room, slyly suggesting that the family would want to see Bo's public comments.\n\n\nPeople across Llanview watched their televisions as Bo began his press conference at the police station.  Bo lauded the men who had put a stop to the drug network in Llanview, and paid tribute to the efforts of John, Brody, Cole, Fish, and Shaun, who remained in critical condition.  He said that though \"courage tasted of blood,\" the men had not wavered from their duty.  He also thanked Marty, Starr, and Layla for dragging John, Cole, and Oliver to the station so they could be properly honored for their service.  As Bo awarded medals of honor to Cole, Fish, and a reluctant John, their friends and family watched with pride, while Kyle stared longingly at Oliver on the television at the Buenos Dias.  Looking into the cameras, Bo addressed Brody, and said he was also to be honored as part of the police force.  The crowd in the police station applauded wildly as Bo presented the heroes of the hour.\n\n\nAfter the ceremony concluded, Bo apologized to John for duping him.  John said he didn't need any medals, but Bo pushed him to accept the award and take the day off with Marty.  John agreed, and told Layla and Fish to take the day off, as well.\n\n\nViki and Charlie arrived at the station, looking for Bo.  Just then, Dorian waltzed in and took the podium, grabbing the media's attention to kick off an impromptu press conference of her own.  Dorian told the assemblage that she had just visited Mayor Lowell and convinced him to resign, due to the corruption in his administration, and held up Lowell's letter of resignation in triumph.  Viki and Charlie were impressed by Dorian's seemingly selfless actions.\n\n\nBo walked up, and Viki thanked him for honoring Brody's heroism.  Bo said he planned to give Brody a medal, as well.  He was delighted at the thought that with Lowell out of the race, Viki would be mayor of Llanview once more.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, David hounded Ford into the restaurant, pleading with him not to give up on their show, but Ford said they couldn't do anything without stars willing to sign release forms.  David said there were reality stars right in front of them.  \"Look at Roxy, she's a train wreck!\" David exclaimed as he grabbed his old friend.  Irritable, Roxy stalked off.  \n\n\nDavid turned to Cristian for inspiration instead: \"He was once brainwashed and he speaks Spanish!\"  He suggested \"Viva La Vida Vickers\" as a new title for the show. Ford was adamant: David was out.  He assured David he could fulfill the terms of his contract by simply doing a show about one of America's other \"David Vickers.\"  David was shocked at the thought there could be another him out there.  Ford said there was, a better one.  With that, Ford stormed off.\n\n\nFish entered the caf\u00e9, where Cristian approached him and continued to cheer him on.  Oliver said he had some friends from the station arriving for a celebration, and Cris said his tab was on the house.  Just then, Oliver ran into Kyle, who offered hesitant congratulations.  He asked Fish where Layla was, but Fish said that he wasn't with Layla anymore.  Kyle asked what happened, and Oliver replied that he thought Kyle had all the answers.  Just then, Kyle's phone rang.  Kyle told Oliver he had to go; it was his boyfriend.\n\n\nNoticing his friend's sorrow, Cristian was back at Fish's side in a flash.  Crestfallen, Fish told Cris he was going to go home instead and spend some time alone.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr, Cole, and Hope returned home with medal in hand.  Starr was grateful that everyone was safe and happy, and that they'd added a fifth to their \"fantastic four\" -- Hope.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Bo arrived in Brody's room and presented him with his medal of honor.  Saluting, Bo welcomed Brody to the Llanview Police Department as Jessica looked on with pride.\n\n\nAt Fish's apartment, Fish returned home, still upset about Kyle.  Staring at the Sun headline, Oliver sat down and picked up Cristian's \"coming-out\" book.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, David ordered comfort food by the Baggie as an older couple entered.  The woman asked Cristian for directions to an address which Cris recognized as his own.  He asked the couple if they were Fish's parents, and Mrs. Fish said they were very proud of their son.\n\n\nAt the police station, Viki and Charlie were still pondering the mayoral race.  Charlie rejoiced in the thought that Viki would soon be \"Mayor Victoria Banks.\"  Dorian walked back in and announced that she wasn't so sure about that.  Charlie challenged Dorian, reminding her that Viki was running unopposed, but Dorian said that was no longer the case.  Viki asked who was running against her.  \"I am,\" Dorian declared. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John and Marty wake up together. Dorian admits to Langston, Starr, and Cole that she inadvertently blew Cole's cover. Bo holds a press conference and presents Cole, John, Brody, and Oliver with Medals of Honor for their work on the task force that broke up a drug ring and exposed a corrupt mayor. Dorian convinces the mayor to resign and makes the announcement at the end of Bo's press conference. She later reveals that she will be running for mayor against Viki. Fish tells Layla and Cristian that he is concerned about his parents' arrival tomorrow. They give him the book that Cristian bought for him, \"How To Tell Your Parents You're Gay.\" Fish thanks them for the book but tells them that no matter how he says it, they will not accept it. Kyle tells Roxy that he has been readmitted to medical school and his record expunged. They watch Bo's press conference on television together. When Fish comes to the Buenos Dias to meet some guys from work to celebrate, he runs into Kyle who tells him he is very proud of him. When Kyle leaves to take a call from his new boyfriend, Fish decides he doesn't feel like celebrating, so he goes home and checks out the book Cris gave him. A middle-aged couple comes into the Buenos Dias and asks Cristian for directions. He notices that the address they are looking for is his apartment so he asks them is they are the Fishes. They are; they have arrived a day early to surprise Oliver. After unsuccessfully trying to get Bo and John to participate in David's reality TV show, Ford gives up and leaves Llanview.",
