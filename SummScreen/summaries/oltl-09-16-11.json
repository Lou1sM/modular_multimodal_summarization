After Kim wondered why Echo wanted to see Cutter, Echo revealed that she wanted to buy the porcupine to add to her collection.  Echo then voiced that she believed that she knew Kim from somewhere.  When Kim claimed that she used to model, Echo remembered that Kim had once been a stripper, and that Kim had also been a Buchanan at one time, when Kim had been married to Clint.\n\n\nKim acknowledged that she was Clint's ex-wife and pointed out to Echo the saying about the cow giving the milk away for free, as Echo had done with Clint.  Kim then claimed that no self-respecting stripper would ever call herself Echo DiSavoy.  Kim admitted that she had googled Echo's name on the computer.  Kim then asked Echo who had sent her, and Echo explained that Roxy had not wanted to sell Morris and was simply beside herself.  Echo said, \"Oh, come on, have a heart.  Really, I mean, I know it's strange, but who cares, right?  He keeps her company.\"\n\n\nKim winced and insisted that she did not want to know what Echo meant by her remark.  When Echo offered to buy Morris at a fair price, Kim claimed that it was not about the rodent, but about what had been inside of Morris.  Kim realized that Roxy and Echo did not want anyone to know that Rex was a stone-cold killer.  However, Echo denied that Rex was a killer and then picked up Morris to search for the gun.  Kim said to Echo, \"Let's deal.\"\n\n\nWhen Echo asked Kim to name her price, Kim indicated that she wanted everything that Echo's brat had exploited from Kim's cowboy, so that Clint could get Gigi's heart.  Echo demanded that Kim give her a realistic number -- a big, fat chunk of money that would not raise any questions.  Echo believed that Kim only wanted Clint to get his money back, so that Kim could then bleed him dry.  However, Kim claimed that she actually wanted to help a sick friend.\n\n\nAfter Echo laughed and asked Kim to see reason, Kim insisted that if Echo wanted the gun back, she would deal with Kim, or that Kim would turn in the gun to the Llanview Police Department.  Echo pleaded with Kim not to take the gun to the cops, because of Shane.  Echo then announced that she did not have access to Rex's money, and that Rex did not even know that Echo suspected him.  Kim told Echo to figure it out, before she raised her price.  Kim then showed Echo the door.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Rex wondered why Clint had been calling hospitals, and why Clint had been bullying the hospital personnel.  Clint informed Rex that he was trying to help a friend, Kimberly Andrews.  Clint added that Kim had a sick friend, and that Kim was having problems paying the friend's medical bills.  Clint claimed that he was just trying to help her out.\n\n\nRex revealed that Gigi had sent him to Clint, through a message from Delphina, but that he had also seen Gigi in the house, in Kentucky, and even at Llanfair.  Rex stated that Gigi kept telling him not to give up, and that Delphina had claimed that Rex's father would know what that meant.  Rex wondered if that had to do with the person in the hospital and believed that Kim was the connection.  Rex reminded Clint that Rex was a private investigator, and that he needed to find out why Gigi kept sending him messages.\n\n\nClint wrote down the information about the hospital and handed it to Rex.  Clint asked Rex to find the girl, because Clint wanted to help Kim, who was \"a remarkable woman...one of a kind.\"  Clint realized that Rex had lost a loved one too soon and suddenly.  When Rex asked if Clint was okay, Clint insisted that he was as strong as he ever was, because he had a good heart.  Clint explained, \"Every morning I wake up, I know that I have Gigi Morasco to thank for the privilege.  No, I will never forget what she did for me.\"  Rex turned and left the room.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Shaun found Destiny and asked why she had not been at the funeral.  Destiny revealed that she had not been at the hospital for a check-up but had instead visited Statesville Prison.  Destiny said that she had seen Greg to forgive him, since she had already forgiven her parents.  She added that she had also taken Matthew's medical records to Greg to get his expert opinion.  Shaun expressed that he was glad that Greg had determined that Matthew would get better, as Rex walked into the caf\u00e9.\n\n\nEcho joined Rex in a booth, and Rex announced that he was taking a jet to leave on business.  Echo laughed and stated that she had forgotten that Rex even had a jet.  Echo then voiced that it was not natural for Rex to have all of the Buchanan money and property, and that Rex should return it all to Clint.  Back at the Minute Man, Kim gazed at a picture of Stacy and Kim and insisted that she would make it right again for all of them.\n\n\nAt the police station, Bo welcomed Deputy Mayor Kathleen Finn into his office, who corrected Bo and reminded him that she was Mayor Finn.  Kathleen asked about the progress of Victor Lord's murder and revealed that she had heard that there had been an eye witness.  Bo agreed that there was a witness, but that the witness was the victim's son, and that it had been too convenient, because Victor's son hated Todd Manning.  Bo added that the witness had already had issues, because of Gigi's case.\n\n\nAfter Kathleen asked about the recording and noted that the witness had known what Victor had said word for word, Bo indicated that the kid's story just did not smell right.  Kathleen declared that it was for the jury to decide, and that it was Bo's job to arrest Todd Manning.  Bo reminded Kathleen that his job was to thoroughly investigate the case, and then to make an arrest.  When Kathleen pondered why Todd Manning was getting preferential treatment, Bo stressed that Todd had gotten no breaks from the police.\n\n\nBo insisted that they did not have enough credible evidence to make an arrest.  Bo remembered about the upcoming election and felt that Kathleen just wanted to look tough on crime.  Kathleen clarified that she wanted to be tough on crime and insisted that Todd would get no breaks.  Bo indicated that the district attorney was not ready to indict, and Kathleen realized that Nora had not been in the office all week.\n\n\nWhen Bo reminded Kathleen of Matthew's situation, Kathleen feared that Nora needed to take a leave of absence.  Bo exclaimed that Nora was fine, and that she knew about all of the evidence and still did not believe that there was enough.  Kathleen revealed that the assistant district attorney disagreed and was ready to indict.  When Bo wondered if that was Kathleen's way of getting back at Nora, Kathleen insisted that she would not hold a grudge, because Bo had once refused to go out with her \"ages ago.\"\n\n\nKathleen said that she was just trying to do her job, and that she would get Bo a warrant.  As Kathleen flew out of the door, Bo yelled that they could not just take Jack Manning's word for it.  Later, Kathleen returned with a warrant for the arrest of Todd Manning and demanded that Bo do his job.  Bo announced that a unit had spotted Todd, and that there would be an arrest.  Bo then declared that he would keep investigating, and that even though the arrest might give Kathleen the election, the truth would end up biting her.\n\n\nDani discovered Jack at Victor's grave and asked him who had witnessed Victor's murder.  Dani wondered why no one had been arrested yet, and she insisted that she needed to talk to the eyewitness.  Jack then admitted that he was the witness.  Confused, Dani remembered that Jack had been unconscious, but Jack announced that he had seen Scarface with the gun.  Jack also recollected that he had heard a noise that night and had turned around.  He claimed that as he had tried to run, he had gotten hit in the head.\n\n\nWhen Dani again wondered why no one had been arrested, Jack screamed that Dani did not believe him.  Dani reminded Jack that Scarface was their father, however, Jack yelled that Victor was their father, because he had been the only one who had cared.  Dani admitted that she also missed Victor, and she made Jack swear to her that he was telling her the truth.  Jack swore that he was and asked Dani to leave him to say goodbye to his dad in peace.  Dani left.\n\n\nIn the church, T\u00e9a walked back in and, next to Victor's picture, saw the back of a man's head that she thought was Victor.  The man turned, and T\u00e9a saw that it was Todd.  When he asked how she was doing, T\u00e9a laughed.  After T\u00e9a then demanded to know what Todd was doing there, Todd indicated that it was the least that he could do for Victor.  T\u00e9a felt that Todd was just there to gloat and cried that he could not fool her, but Todd reflected that Victor had been the one who had fooled everyone.\n\n\nOnce Todd realized that T\u00e9a blamed him, he claimed that although he had hated Victor, that did not mean that he was happy about what had happened to him.  Todd felt that it had been hard on Victor when he had found out what Irene had done, and that had not been Victor's fault.  When Todd then asked about Dani, T\u00e9a refused to answer and only said that if Todd had cared about the kids, he would not have killed Victor.\n\n\nWhen Todd insisted that he had not killed Victor because of the kids, T\u00e9a responded, \"Yes, you could.  Yes, you could, because that's what you do.  You do horrible things, and then...and then you feel horrible about it.  You come back, and you try to make up for it, but it's too late.  That's the Todd Manning I know.\"  Todd maintained that he had not done anything and asked T\u00e9a to be his lawyer, but T\u00e9a refused.\n\n\nT\u00e9a screamed that she hated Todd, and that she had loved Victor, and that Victor had loved her in a way that Todd never had.  T\u00e9a cried that they were on sacred ground, and that Todd could not be there.  T\u00e9a demanded that Todd get out.  Todd walked away, and T\u00e9a fell to the ground.  T\u00e9a sobbed, as Todd watched, and then he left the church.\n\n\nOnce she was alone in the church, T\u00e9a told Victor that she could not let Dani see that T\u00e9a was upset.  T\u00e9a reflected that Victor had been a good father to Dani and wondered how she would be able to keep it together for Dani.  T\u00e9a did not know how to teach Dani to move on, if T\u00e9a could not do so herself.  Dani then walked in and saw that T\u00e9a had been crying.\n\n\nDani remembered that Victor had been a mess, when they had believed that T\u00e9a was dead, but that Dani and Victor had always had each other.  T\u00e9a hugged Dani and cried that they still had each other.  Dani then announced that there was something that her mother needed to know about Jack.  Dani revealed that Jack had told the police that he had seen Todd shoot Victor.\n\n\nBack at Victor's grave, Jack apologized to his dad for the lie but insisted that he wanted to make Todd pay.  Jack claimed that he would get justice and questioned why Scarface would get to walk for what he did.  Jack indicated that he had received a sign to be the perfect witness, and that since Victor had always had Jack's back, Jack would have Victor's.\n\n\nTodd walked up to Jack at the gravesite and stated that he knew how much Victor had meant to Jack.  Todd denied killing Victor however.  After Jack screamed that Todd was a freak, and that he was sick, Todd sadly revealed, \"The only thing that kept me alive for eight years, Jack, was you...you and Starr and Viki and everyone else.  Coming home to you was all I wanted.  I owe you my life, Jack, because I came home for you.\"\n\n\nTodd admitted that as much as he hated Victor, he would not have killed him, because that would have hurt Jack, and Todd could not have done that to him.  Jack screamed, \"Get away from me.  You are nothing.\"  The police then arrived and announced, \"Todd Manning, you're under arrest for the murder of Victor Lord.\"  Surprised, Todd exclaimed, \"Hold, hold, hold on a second, okay?  There's no...what?  You can't arrest me.\"\n\n\nThe police officer stated, \"Judge Runyon issued a warrant an hour ago,\" and Todd replied, \"How'd that happen?  There's no evidence.\"  The officer explained, \"An eye witness put you at the scene with a gun.\"  Todd asked, \"What eye witness?\"  Jack declared, \"Me.\"  Todd turned and looked at Jack.\n\n\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Todd's funeral, Tea is distraught and believes original Todd killed her husband. Jack is determined to \"seek justice\" for his father even though he knows that Victor is watching over him and knows he's lying to say he saw original Todd kill him. Meanwhile, the new mayor tells Bo that she needs the cops to arrest Todd manning and if he doesn't do it, she will go over his head and get a warrant. Yet he knows she is \"motivated\" to make an arrest so that she can get re-elected. So the cops go to \"surprise\" original Todd by finding him and arrest him when he least expects it and knows they have no evidence. Destiny admits to Shaun that she went to see Greg to see if maybe he could help Matthew. Kim tells Echo if she wants her to hand over the gun so that Rex does not get charged with murder, Rex needs to give Clint his money back. Meanwhile, Clint and Rex have a conversation and sound like they might be bonding and care for each other when Rex is ready to help Kim get medical care for her \"mysterious\" friend as Clint needs and Clint somehow knows that Rex needs some answers about Gigi. And they both seem to know that those two situations are related.",
