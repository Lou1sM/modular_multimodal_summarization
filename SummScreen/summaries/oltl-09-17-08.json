    "soap_central": "\nDear John\n\n\nIn the secret room, Natalie dreamt that Jared had discovered her in the basement. Natalie awoke in time to witness a conversation between Jared and Tess on the television monitor. Tess tried to convince Jared that Natalie was gone for good, but Jared refused to believe that Natalie would leave him. Jared revealed that he had spent the entire evening looking for Natalie but had no luck. He said it appeared as if she had fallen off the face of the earth. Natalie watched in horror as Tess attempted to console Jared about losing the love of his life. When Tess continued to offer Jared no hope of Natalie's return, he stormed out of the mansion in search of her. Frustrated because she couldn't reveal herself to Jared, Natalie threw a temper tantrum in the locked secret room. Tess flashed Natalie a devilish smile. \n\n\nAs Natalie flew into a rage, Tess paid her sister a visit. Natalie demanded answers from Tess. She wanted to know exactly what Tess had planned for her. Enjoying Natalie's frantic state, Tess continued to play mind games. Giving vague answers, Tess implied that Jared would move on and forget about Natalie. When Natalie pleaded with Jessica to surface, an aggravated Tess threatened to kill her. Fearing that Tess would make good on her promise, Natalie tried to reason with Tess. Realizing that part of Tess's plan was to end Natalie's relationship with Jared, Natalie questioned exactly what Tess would gain from the breakup. A look of shock crossed Natalie's face when Tess gave her the news. Tess said that she would receive great pleasure when Natalie witnessed Jared fall out of love with her and in love with Tess. \n\n\nJohn visited Blair at Llanfair. John told her that Cris was missing and that he was leaving town for a few days to search for him. Pleased that John took time out to update her on his whereabouts, Blair admitted that she was impressed with John's character. After the two shared a goodbye kiss, Blair headed upstairs to help Starr prepare for the first day of school. \n\n\nBlair was surprised to find Starr already dressed for school. When Blair complimented her daughter on her appearance, Starr expressed her fear of returning to school pregnant. Starr expected to receive her fair share of nasty remarks from her classmates, but her biggest concern was running into Cole. Blair comforted her daughter. Starr admitted that something else was bothering her. She showed Blair a text message that Todd had sent her. In the text, Todd wished his daughter a great first day at school. \n\n\nDownstairs, Dorian placed a conference call to her team of lawyers and ordered them to expedite Langston's adoption. As Dorian instructed her lawyers to investigate Ray Montez and supply her with every sordid detail of his past, Langston entered the room. Langston demanded to know why Dorian wanted to investigate her uncle. Dorian insisted that she had every right to check into Ray's past. Fearing that Ray might have an ulterior motive, Dorian cautioned Langston that he might have surfaced because he was after Dorian's money. Refusing to believe Ray had ill intentions, Langston was convinced that Ray's appearance was divine intervention. Mentioning Delphina's prediction, Langston believed she had been forewarned of her uncle's arrival. Unmoved by Langston's emotions, Dorian remained disturbed by Ray's presence. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Clint gave Ray instructions on how to manipulate Langston and Dorian. Relying on his pleasant encounter with Langston, Ray believed that he would have little trouble dealing with her. Appearing to have a genuine fondness for Langston, Ray told Clint that she reminded him very much of his late sister. Delighted by Ray's apparent progress, Clint insisted that Ray continue to use Langston's love for her mother as a way to gain her trust. \n\n\nRay surmised that Dorian was a shrewd woman and wouldn't be easily intimidated. Clint told Ray that Dorian had a strong affection for Langston, and that it was necessary to use her devotion to Langston as a means of regaining his company. Detailing his encounter with Dorian, Ray concluded that she obviously disliked him. Advising Ray that Dorian viewed him as a threat, Clint cautioned him not to underestimate her. Ray informed Clint that he had experience dealing with Dorian's type. Concerned that someone other than Nigel might see Ray, Clint suggested that he head over to LaBoulaie. As Clint ushered Ray to the door, Bo appeared. Claiming that Ray was a business associate, Clint sent him on his way. \n\n\nBefore Bo could question Clint about Ray's identity, Nora, Matthew, and Cole entered the study. The family attempted to cheer up Matthew, who was nervous about fitting in on his first day of high school. While Nora fussed over him, Clint and Bo managed to ease his fears. Cole promised to look after him, and the two headed off to school. Alone with Clint, Nora thanked him for calming Matthew's nerves and commended him on his caring nature. When Nora mentioned that she hoped Clint's desire to regain control of the company didn't change him, Clint became defensive and maintained that he was the same person that he had always been. Nora didn't appear convinced. \n\n\nCole returned to the mansion to search for Matthew's missing wallet. Nora thanked him for being a friend to Matthew and asked how he was handling the return to school. Cole confided that he feared running into Starr. Remembering his mother, Cole wondered how she would feel about him deserting his pregnant girlfriend. Nora told Cole that he had nothing to be ashamed of and assured him that Marty would be proud of him. \n\n\nLater, an emotional Nora cried on Clint's shoulder. Nora couldn't believe that her little boy was in high school. As Nora wept, Clint held her. While Nora was consumed with thoughts of Matthew, Clint glanced at his watch. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Ray paid Langston a visit. Langston was elated to see her uncle, but Dorian was furious. When Dorian insisted that Langston head off to school, Ray stated that he wanted to present Langston with a special gift. Ray handed Langston a beautiful necklace. He explained that it had belonged to Langston's mother and she had treasured it. Ray told Langston that she possessed many of her mother's good qualities and stated that her resemblance to her mother was amazing. Touched by Ray's words, Langston embraced him. Both Dorian and Blair appeared suspicious. Unable to contain her emotions any longer, Dorian insisted that Langston and Starr head off to school. Langston hugged her uncle and kissed Dorian. Before leaving, Langston asked Dorian to be pleasant towards Ray. Alone with Ray, Dorian demanded to know what he wanted with her and her daughter. \n\n\nAt the police station, John asked an officer to provide him with every known alias of Carlo Hesser. Jared bolted into the station and informed John that Natalie had been kidnapped. Upon viewing Natalie's letter, John appeared unconvinced and believed that Natalie had left Jared a \"Dear John\" letter. Insisting that the letter was out of character for Natalie, Jared wondered if John could forgive himself if it were later discovered that Natalie was really in danger. \n\n\nAn officer interrupted John and Jared's discussion with news regarding Carlo Hesser. Carlo had left Mendorra using the alias, \"Mortimer Bern.\" Immediately, Jared realized that he had encountered the suspect at the Colombian prison. Upon receiving the lead from Jared, John promised to look into Natalie's case. Jared placed a call to someone. He stated that Natalie was missing and asked to meet with the unidentified person. \n\n\nAt Plato prison, Cris was surprised when Vanessa Montez returned for a visit. Attempting to undress him, a seductive Vanessa stated that she had come for a conjugal visit. When Cris refused her advances, she asked if he found her attractive. Cris believed that Vanessa didn't want a sexual encounter with him - she wanted her husband. Vanessa apologized and related that it had been a long time since her last conjugal visit. Cris pleaded with Vanessa to place a call to Antonio. Vanessa agreed to help Cris only if he assisted her in finding her husband. Cris assured Vanessa that Antonio's police contacts would lead them to Ray. When Cris attempted to give her Antonio's number, Vanessa refused it and claimed she would have no problem finding Antonio. Cris begged her to contact Antonio immediately. Before leaving, Vanessa informed Cris that her husband had endured many years in prison. She was certain that if her husband survived, so could Cris. \n\n\n",
