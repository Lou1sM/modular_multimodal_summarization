He wanted a family meeting, he told Jack, as he asked the boy to find his mother. Curious, Starr gasped when Todd made a point of flashing T\u00e9a's engagement ring in front of his daughter.\n\n\n\"It's great?\" Starr said after much hesitation. She admitted to liking T\u00e9a, but was suspicious at her father's insistence at being happy with T\u00e9a. Nonetheless, she congratulated them half-heartedly, adding that she expected the same treatment when she eventually announced her own engagement to Cole. She was only worried about Blair's reaction to Todd's engagement and couldn't believe it when Todd insisted that Blair already knew about it. Starr wondered why her mother had been quiet about it and had not provided the usual fireworks.\n\n\nBlair found Ross lounging by the pool and ordered him to return to his hiding place in the cabana. She was worried that someone would see him. She wondered aloud how people would react if they saw Ross, especially her kids. \"Guess we're about to find out,\" Jack called out, waving to his mom.\n\n\nBlair faltered over her words as she introduced Jack to her friend, Randy. Looking at Ross in his bathing trunks, she added his last name, Abner. Jack inquired if he was the same kind of friend as Todd's friend, half-naked lady. He mentioned that Todd and T\u00e9a were in the house. Gasping, Blair told her son that her friend was a secret agent and Jack couldn't tell anyone about the man's presence. Jack told Blair she was lame as Ross pretended to shoot a gun at him. Blair and Jack headed back to the house.\n\n\nOnce Blair and Jack stepped inside, Todd announced his upcoming marriage to T\u00e9a. Jack wanted to know if Blair planned on stopping it, because he wanted his parents to be together. Blair quietly explained that Jack's father wanted T\u00e9a instead, though she thought that he probably hadn't thought it out. She hoped it wasn't a mistake, she continued, but she knew that T\u00e9a loved Todd. She snidely added that it wasn't the first time that T\u00e9a was marrying Todd, though she couldn't talk since she had married six or seven times herself. T\u00e9a suggested that it was more like ten or twelve times, starting with Asa. Blair asked that Asa not be mentioned, since she was a different person then. \"Who wasn't?\" asked Todd.\n\n\nBlair added that she really admired T\u00e9a because she knew that T\u00e9a's heart really belonged to Todd. An alert T\u00e9a realized that Blair was onto something. As talk turned to the wedding, Blair felt that it would show unity if she attended. It would indicate that they had buried the hatchet, she explained. \"Where, in my back?\" T\u00e9a asked. Blair went a step further and offered to help plan the wedding. Upset, Jack bolted from the room and Todd went after his son. Blair also offered to help with the honeymoon planning, sensing a deserted island in the tropics as the way to go. T\u00e9a looked at Blair suspiciously and asked point-blank what Blair's scheme was. She knew Blair wasn't being on the level.\n\n\nTodd told Jack that he was rude. While Jack admitted that he liked T\u00e9a, he did not want her as a mother and did not want to take orders from her if he stayed at Todd's house. Todd assured him that he already had a mother and T\u00e9a would not replace her. Jack divulged that Blair had a new friend who was on the premises. Heading towards the pool area, Todd spotted a man lying on a chaise lounge. He called out, but Ross turned and ran into the cabana, locking himself in. Todd ordered him to leave the cabana, or Todd would go in after him.\n\n\nLayla returned to her apartment and was pleased to see that Oliver was reading the book  How To Tell Your Parents You're Gay  that Cristian had purchased for him. Oliver assured her that he was not planning on telling his parents the truth. He noted that his parents wouldn't throw him a party like the parents in the book did. He divulged that Kyle's parents had actually \"outed him to himself\" when they admitted they had known all along that Kyle was gay. Oliver maintained that he was happy that Kyle had himself a new boyfriend, and he apologized to Layla for so much of their lives centering around him.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cristian was shocked when Oliver's parents showed up a day early. He introduced himself to George and Barbara Fish and learned they had arrived ahead of schedule after hearing that their son was a hero. Barbara mentioned that Oliver had described Cristian's muscles so she would have recognized him anywhere. Cristian's attempt at stalling their visit to the apartment by mentioning how messy it was didn't work, as the Fishes insisted on heading over to see their son's residence.\n\n\nLayla assured Oliver that she had moved on and forgiven him, but that he still needed to forgive himself. She wanted him to stop hiding the truth. As if on cue, Cristian arrived with Oliver's parents. \"Surprise!\" both George and Barbara called out. After some small talk, the parents announced that they wanted to take everyone to dinner and meet Oliver's girlfriend. When they learned that it was Layla, things momentarily became awkward. They hadn't realized she was black. After the initial shock, they admitted that they didn't mind and were happy that their son was happy. Oliver interrupted Barbara, who was eager to hear details of the relationship. He and Layla had really broken up, he confessed.\n\n\nOliver disclosed that he had never told his parents because he didn't know how. Cristian offered to leave with Layla to give the Fish family some privacy, but Oliver asked that they stay. He admitted that he hadn't been straight with his parents and had not told them everything. Layla explained that while she hadn't been right for Oliver, some special person would be there one day to appreciate all of Oliver's exceptional qualities. Barbara wondered why Layla wasn't right for her son if Oliver was so wonderful.\n\n\nGeorge offered to help his son out as an uneasy Oliver stumbled over his words. Barbara suggested that her family sit down. As they seated themselves on the sofa, George uncomfortably found himself sitting on something else. Reaching underneath him, he pulled out the book that Oliver had been looking at earlier. \"What is this?\" George inquired.\n\n\nSitting at a table at the caf\u00e9, David learned that he had been recast in a television show about himself after speaking to his agent on the phone. He pleaded for any kind of job, even that of a daytime extra. Hearing Dorian announce her candidacy for mayor on the television, David had a new thought. He wondered how he could make the announcement work for himself.\n\n\nAt the police station, Dorian announced her candidacy, and informed Viki that Viki would be \"in for the fight of your life.\" Viki could only chuckle when Dorian listed her qualifications, including her stint as ambassador to a \"key and strategic country,\" also known as Mendorra. Dorian confirmed that she wanted change, and Viki challenged her. Viki wondered how they could all trust a woman only recently aligned with the corrupt Mayor Lowell.\n\n\nDorian assured the gathered press that it would be \"politics as usual\" from her opponent with all of Viki's mudslinging and charges, but she promised she would \"never betray your trust\" and would \"uphold your faith in the principles of American democracy\" if people gave her their votes. Viki reassured a worried Charlie that she intended to run her clean campaign and that Dorian would end up \"digging her own grave,\" so they didn't need to worry about anything that Dorian said. The women accused each other of being terrified. They were momentarily distracted when David noisily arrived, stumbling and crashing into the furniture, but looking for the television cameras. \"I rest my case,\" Viki told her husband.\n\n\nRealizing that the cameras were long gone, David straightened up and became serious. He stated that he had decided to take a new path and wanted to become more sophisticated and more meaningful in his pursuit of his career. A thrilled Viki asked him to become a member of her campaign staff, as she needed someone to do some research on her opponent. David informed her that he was looking for a paid job and had thought a celebrity endorsement to be more of what he was seeking. He wanted perks, too.\n\n\nAs David considered Viki's offer, especially after she added free room and board, Dorian couldn't let her adversary get the best of her. She asked David to be her campaign manager. Viki admitted that the position on her team would be that of a volunteer but there would be room for growth. Dorian offered a paycheck and suggested that David's beautiful hands would be covered with calluses if he was relegated to stuffing envelopes for Viki.\n\n\nA torn David finally apologized to Viki. Assuring her that she was his best friend ever, he had decided that he needed to take the paid job with Dorian. Viki felt certain that things had turned out for the best. She enlightened Charlie that the couple would be fighting with each other soon enough. With the words barely out of her mouth, they turned at the sound of shouting as Dorian and David had their first argument.\n\n\nJared, Natalie, and Clint, wondering if the unknown stalker was still around, were startled when another package addressed to Jared and Natalie was delivered at Buchanan Enterprises. After company security had perused the package, Jerome the security officer advised them that it was safe to open. It was another DVD, which Natalie promptly placed into the computer. A male, with distorted voice and shadowed face, accused Natalie and Jared of murdering Nash Brennan, and promised to make them pay for it.\n\n\nJerome admitted that previous holes in the company's security system had been closed up, but they still were unaware of how the latest package was delivered sight unseen. He promised that surveillance cameras would be checked further. He thought that the stalker was a threat. Natalie felt obligated to see Jessica in person at the hospital to fill her in on the latest goings-on. Jared felt uncomfortable letting her go out alone, but Natalie promised to keep Jared informed on her every move.\n\n\nAfter Natalie left, Jared went to his office. He closed the door and headed to his desk. Someone jumped him from behind!\n\n \n\n\n",
