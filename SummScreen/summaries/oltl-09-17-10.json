    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Ford's office at the university, James asked if Bobby was still the teacher of the advanced writing class, because James knew that Ford and Langston had \"hooked up.\"  Bobby told James to never give up, because if Langston could return to Ford, anything was possible.  Ford insisted that he was serious about Langston.  Bobby also claimed that it was good that their mom was in Llanview, so that he could see \"why I am like I am.\"  When James questioned why Langston had given Ford a second chance, Bobby answered that Langston had taken \"a leap of faith.\"\n\n\nStarr signed the book at T\u00e9a's memorial service.  When Blair revealed that she had once heard T\u00e9a singing \"Dancing Queen,\" Starr stated that she had not known that T\u00e9a was an ABBA fan.  Blair had hoped that the memorial would have helped Todd deal with T\u00e9a's death, only Ross had taken Dani away.\n\n\nAt the ceremony, after Todd requested that Shaun \"do a hit\" for him, Shaun warned Todd to behave.  Otherwise, Shaun would kick Todd out of the memorial service.\n\n\nLangston commented that Blair had done a great job with the arrangements but regretted that Blair had dealt with the lies from Eli.  \"It's easy to believe someone, when you love them.\"  Blair responded, \"And that's a good lesson for you to learn about Ford.\"  Langston stressed that she would never allow Ford to hurt her again.  Langston then asked Blair if a part of her wished that Eli were still alive, so that Blair could make Eli as miserable as he had made her.  Blair voiced, \"Sweetheart, you have no idea.\"\n\n\nDani introduced Nate to Ross, who noted that Nate was his \"little girl's boyfriend.\"  When Dani admitted that she was embarrassed, Ross stated, \"Hey, I'm your father.  It's my right to embarrass you.\"  As Nate asked Ross if he would remain in Llanview, Todd strode up and insisted that Ross would leave that night.  When Ross told Todd that T\u00e9a's will had spelled out what was best for Dani, Todd blared, \"Ah, that will was faked by your psycho brother.  Oh, tell you, if he wasn't already dead, I'd kill him myself.\"\n\n\nRoss reflected that the day was supposed to be about T\u00e9a, not Todd.  Starr grabbed Todd's arm and pulled him aside.  Starr stressed that the lawyers would fight the will, and that as for Ross, Todd would \"blow him away.\"  Starr reminded Todd that Ross had been Dani's only father for years and pleaded with Todd to do nothing.  Starr believed that Dani should decide what to do to be happy.\n\n\nNate explained to Ross that he and Dani needed to return to school.  Ross claimed that once the judge had dealt with the will, no attorney would be able to overturn it.  As they left, Eli called Ross and claimed that Dani would be Ross's again and insisted, \"Ross, that document is air-tight.  No judge can change it.\"  When Ross appreciated what Eli had done for him, Eli pointed out that he had done it as much for himself as he had for Ross.\n\n\nBlair rushed up and demanded to know if a phone call was Ross's way to pay his respects to T\u00e9a.  Ross explained that he had been talking to his attorney.  Still on the phone, Eli guessed that it was Blair, and Ross stormed off into another room.  \"Yeah, who do you think? She wasn't too happy to see me either.  I wonder why.\"\n\n\nDani told Starr that she needed to get away from \"the dueling dads,\" and Starr understood completely.  As Starr hugged Dani, she wished that Dani would stay in Llanview but knew that Dani had to arrive at a decision that would make her happy.\n\n\nStarr and Langston ran into the university classroom late, and after a snaky remark, Ford started class.  Dean McKenzie walked into the room and asked to speak to Ford in private.  In the hall, the dean asked Ford if he were romantically involved with Langston, and Ford denied that he was still involved with her.  Dean McKenzie showed Bobby the photos of a kiss between Ford and Langston.  The dean reminded Ford of the school policy, which was \"one strike and you're out,\" so she said that she would \"have to let him go.\"  Dean McKenzie walked back into the classroom and announced to the class that they would have a new professor for their next class session, due to Ford's inappropriate behavior with a student.\n\n\nAs they walked out of the classroom, Starr questioned why Ford would be with another student, since he had been trying to work things out with Langston, but Langston stormed off.  Starr asked James if Langston had known about the other student.  James replied, \"You could say that.\"  James then informed Starr that Ford had actually been with Langston.\n\n\nLangston located Ford in the park.  When Ford wondered who had taken the pictures of them together, Langston acted innocent.  After Ford asked who had hated him enough to get him fired, Langston announced that she had.\n\n\nAs they strolled outside, Nate and Dani discussed Dani's two dads, and Nate reminded Dani that he did not have a dad.  Dani speculated that she had a spare to give him but immediately realized that her comment had been a bad joke.  Dani confirmed that the text had been from Ross and then explained about T\u00e9a's will, which had stated that Dani was to be with Ross.  When Nate asked about her wishes, Dani thought that Nate was asking which father she would choose.  Dani questioned if the will was \"real\" and just wanted to know what her mother would have wanted.  Nate asked Dani again what she wanted.\n\n\nDani stated that, at one time, she had missed her dad, Ross, and had wanted him to take her from Llanview.  But she said that she was not so sure about that anymore.  Dani confessed that she had finally gotten to know \"the real Todd,\" after he had shown that he would do anything for T\u00e9a.  Dani realized that she did not want to leave Blair and her sister, Starr.  Dani claimed that she loved Ross but did not want to give up everything -- and that included Nate.\n\n\nDani wished to have both of her dads in Llanview.  Her desire was that Todd and Ross would get along, so that she could have both of her fathers.  \"More than that, more than anything, I wish my mom were still alive.\"\n\n\nBlair insisted to Todd that they leave for the reception, but Todd asked for the chance to say one last goodbye to T\u00e9a.  After Blair left, Todd confronted Ross and asked how much money it would take for Ross to go away, and to never hurt Dani.  Todd demanded that Ross take the money, or Ross would be a dead man.  Ross asked if he decided not take the money, whether Todd would kill him, and Todd pulled out a gun.  \"That's exactly what I'm going to do.\"\n\n\nRoss wondered how Todd would be a father to Dani, while he was in prison, and Todd insisted that he would never be sent to prison.  \"\"Yeah, while you were at the Palace, watching pay-per-view on my dime, I got the bill.  Thanks a lot.  I spoke to some people who work for me, and I have someone to dispose of your body.  I've got a guy who will have your name on his passport, and a bunch of witnesses, who just saw me leave this memorial before you.\"  When Ross mentioned that Todd was taking his time pulling the trigger, Todd reflected that he had pulled a trigger before.  \"So, what's it going to be?  The money or the bullet?\"\n\n\nBlair walked into the room, as Todd pointed the gun at Ross.  Blair begged Todd not to kill someone that Dani loved and asked if Todd really wanted to put Dani \"through that kind of pain.\"  Blair insisted that T\u00e9a's spirit was watching over them.  \"Don't do this to Dani.  Don't let her lose somebody she loves, please.\"\n\n\nTodd yelled for Ross to leave, before he changed his mind, and Ross ran out.  Blair admitted that she would have preferred that Todd had shot Ross, but that she had remembered that she had made a promise to T\u00e9a to protect Dani.  Blair cried that she always kept her promises.\n\n\nFrom his hospital bed at St. Kitts, Eli called Greg, who was at Rodi's.  When Eli asked if Greg would be on the next plane back, Greg insisted that he had needed more time, and that he had also needed to pay his respects to T\u00e9a.  Eli demanded that Greg be on the next plane.  \"And I need you to give me a clean bill of health.  I've got so much to do.  And I am bored to death of being dead.\"\n\n\nGreg announced that Eli's prognosis was not good, and that Eli had to remain in the hospital.  Eli suspected that Greg had motives and warned Greg that he had better be on the next plane.  Greg answered, \"I will get there, when I get there,\" as Shaun walked up to his table.\n\n\nWhen Greg offered to buy Shaun a drink, Shaun refused.  Shaun asked Greg what was up with him, and Greg brushed off his telephone call and stated that he had just returned from T\u00e9a's memorial service.  Shaun suspected that something else was going on, but Greg explained that he had regretted that he had to tell Todd and Dani that they had been too late to see T\u00e9a at the hospice.  Shaun indicated that Greg had looked shady at the memorial and declared that he knew trouble, because that was his business.  \"I know how to keep people out of it.  I know how to get them through it, when they're in it.  And I can smell it twenty feet away.\"\n\n\nShaun insisted that he could help Greg out of his trouble.  Shaun then glimpsed T\u00e9a's file on the table and questioned why Greg still had T\u00e9a's medical file with him.  Greg claimed that he had the file to verify that he had not missed anything with her condition.  When Shaun refused to believe him, Greg begged Shaun to \"stay out of it\" for Shaun's and Destiny's sakes.  Greg warned that Shaun would put the three of them in danger if he did not back off.  After Greg insisted that he could handle it, Shaun said, \"If you need me, I'm there,\" and left.\n\n\nEli called Ross and stressed that it would only be a few more hours until the judge validated the will.  Eli declared, \"Soon you will be on your way to having everything you wanted, and so will I.\"\n\n\nJohn and Natalie entered John's apartment, and after they sat on the couch, John rubbed Natalie's feet and asked her if she was okay.  Natalie claimed that she just felt sad for Dani.  Then Natalie announced that she had received a text message that had stated that the DNA from the burnt body was in, and she handed John a sonogram picture of the baby to take with him to Tahiti.  When John revealed that he would not be traveling to Tahiti, because the Tahitian police had lost the body, Natalie cried that there was no evidence left to prove that Eli was alive.  John said, \"Not necessarily.\"\n\n\nJohn held up a plastic bag and showed Natalie the wedding ring that Eli had put on the body and requested that Natalie get DNA evidence off of the ring.  When Natalie told John to accompany her to the lab, he handed Natalie her shoes.\n\n\nWhen John and Natalie returned to their apartment, Natalie yawned, so John insisted that she take a nap.  Natalie agreed to lie down but insisted that she would be unable to sleep until they received the DNA report that would reveal if Eli were dead or alive.\n\n\nWhen John hung up his cell phone, Natalie leaped up in bed, while she claimed that she had not fallen asleep, and asked about the call.  John responded, \"That was the lab.  Well, the DNA from Clarke's envelope doesn't match the ring.\"  Natalie remarked, \"So you were right.\"  When John announced, \"It wasn't Clarke's body,\" Natalie confirmed, \"He's alive.\"  John nodded.\n\n\nStill at the memorial, with a picture of T\u00e9a in the background, as Blair looked above, she felt that T\u00e9a would be proud that Blair had stopped Todd from killing Ross.  Blair said, \"Well, I told Todd that I don't make promises that I can't keep.  I know.  We both know that that's not true, and that I would have said anything to make him put the gun down.  Finally, I guess I really do believe that you are here.  I'm standing here talking to you, aren't I?  Yeah, well, girlfriend, if there ever was a time that we needed you, it's right now.\"\n\n\nAs Todd gazed at T\u00e9a's urn in another room at the memorial, Todd stated, \"I never believe in promises anyway.  The only truth that I know is that you left me.  You died and left me.  I don't want your spirit anyway.  I want you.  I want you standing here, right here, to tell me what a jackass I am.  I couldn't last two minutes without you.  I'd love to hear you say that.  I'd let you say that.  I could forgive you for saying that.  I don't think that I can forgive you for dying on me.  I can't do this.  I can't do this without you, T\u00e9a.  I want you back.  Why don't you just come back to me?  Just come back to me.\"\n\n\nGreg grabbed a chart and walked into a hospital room.  He adjusted a monitor and checked on T\u00e9a, as she lay in the hospital bed.\n\n\nTodd yelled into the air, \"Come back to me -- please!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Tea's memorial service is about to start. All the people who loved her attend. Todd and Ross find they cannot be in the same room when Ross acts like Dani's father and appears very confident he can get custody of her and take her away. Todd first attempts to buy Ross off. When Ross tells Todd he refuses to take his money, Todd pulls a gun on him and tells Ross he knows how to get away with eliminating him and nobody will ever find Ross's dead body. But Blair walks in on them and urges Todd to stop. She admits she'd like to help Todd get away with killing Ross. But she can't let him do it for Dani's and for Tea's sake. John and Natalie are working diligently to find DNA evidence to prove that Eli is not dead. Greg is privately talking to the secretly alive Eli and warns him that he has a serious brain injury and cannot return to Llanview or else a fatal injury could happen to him. Eli questions whether Greg is lying. But Greg tells him he does not have to listen to his doctor's medical advise if he does not want to. It's his brain. And Eli somehow becomes afraid to take his chances and defy Greg's orders to stay where he is. Right when everybody is missing Tea and telling her \"spirit\" that they need her and want her to come back, we see Greg privately entering a secret hospital room. And we see Tea alive in the bed.",
