    "soap_central": "\nWhen Nat's Away, Tess Will...\n\n\nThe high school students filed in for the first day of school, sitting in the gymnasium for a welcome back speech. Running late, Langston and Starr tried to sneak in, thought better of it, and turned to leave. Unfortunately they were seen and made to walk through the crowd to the front of the room. As soon as Starr was spotted, there were loud jokes made at her expense. Cole and Markko jumped to her aid, though the melee was stopped and the students involved were warned. Even Matthew stood up to defend Starr's honor. \n\n\nAs the students involved in the fray were escorted into the hallway, Starr grabbed the microphone. She urged the students to use condoms during sex or the girls would look like her. She dared them to make fun of her. She challenged them to line up and feel her belly, affirming that she was pregnant and not a freak. Again, she urged them to use condoms, but she was interrupted and deemed not a role model by the school staff. Starr felt differently, but it was suggested that she try out for the debate team instead. Her future at the school also looked doubtful, she was told. \n\n\n\"Cut the crap\" was Dorian's response to Ray's insistence that he only wanted to know his niece and nothing more. He confessed that he had failed as an uncle and brother, that he had changed and was looking for forgiveness. Assuring him that he would merely get a wave goodbye from Langston, Dorian admitted to his questioning that she hadn't known Langston for very long, nor did she know Langston's mother. Explaining how they ended up together, Dorian assured Ray that Langston was a Kramer in every sense of the word, as much as the rest of the family. A grateful Ray reminded her that by blood, Langston was a Montez and still a minor, and that he would be the one to raise her. Dorian, insisting that he would not extort money from her, ordered him out of the house. He would go to court, he told her, because he just wanted his niece. Dorian vowed to fight him. \n\n\nAs Montez appeared to be concerned for the well-being of his niece, Dorian demanded to know where he had been over the years. She coldly wondered why he had waited until Langston was in her house. She added that he would not change the secure young woman from what she had become since living with Dorian. As he left, Montez assured her he'd be in touch. A shaken Dorian called her attorneys and demanded that the adoption be expedited. She also wanted dirt on Ray Montez. \n\n\nAs Brody was having a dream related to his days as a soldier, he tackled Shane when the boy tried to wake him up. Gigi began to scream to awaken him and made him aware of his surroundings. Shane announced that he wanted his dad to take him to his first day of school, even though his mother had always done it in years past. His disappointed mom was informed that she could pick him up when the school day was over. As Brody and Shane were departing for school, Marcie arrived to share some good news with Gigi. \n\n\nAn anxious Jared paid Rex a visit and asked where he was hiding Natalie. Rex was pretty sure that his sister had finally realized that she could do better than Jared and had done the right thing and dumped him. Jared's pleas that Natalie wouldn't desert the rest of her family fell on deaf ears, as Rex had plenty of excuses for why Nat had probably up and left without telling anyone. As Jared departed, Rex received a phone call from Adriana. She missed him and thought that they should spend a couple of weeks together, to repair their marriage. Rex responded with his request for a divorce, maintaining that they should never have married in the first place. \n\n\nA shocked Adriana told Rex she loved him but his reply was not what she wanted to hear. He advised her that he didn't feel the same and that it was all her fault. He surprised her further by asking if she knew all along that he was Shane's father. He remembered his toothbrush in the bag that Adriana had claimed was needed for proving that Charlie was his dad. He realized that she had sent it to Brody. Adriana was silent. Rex advised her that he would have divorce papers sent to her and no amount of pleading and crying would change his mind. He admitted his love for Gigi and was never more sure of anything, he told her. \n\n\nNat could do nothing but laugh when she learned that Tess was planning on making Jared fall for her instead. While Nat felt that nothing could make Jared go after Tess, Tess insisted there was \"...life after you, Natalie.\" Reminding Tess that Jared hated her, Tess let it be known that it was Jessica that Jared would be seeing. Natalie was sure that with Jared's suspicions, he would catch on to Tess in no time. She emphasized that Tess would be betraying Nash by going after Jared, and made sure to drive that fact home, repeatedly, in an attempt to bring Jess back. An upset Tess fought back, assuring her sister that Jess would have returned already if she were still around. \n\n\nPointing at the screen, Tess informed Nat that she had already lost Jared and could watch Tess seduce him on reality T.V. She further planned to have Jared be her birthing coach, she gloated. Nat was sick to hear that Tess would use the baby in her scheme. \n\n\nMarcie was proud to announce that she had been accepted as a substitute teacher, on probation, by the Llanview School District. She also noticed that Shane was still unaware that Rex was his father. Hearing about the fake DNA test that Brody had conducted, Marcie tried to reassure Gigi that, while things would get worse, it was best that Shane hear the truth. She knew that one day he would understand why his mom had lied, and she was sure that Rex would stand by Gigi's side. \n\n\nBrody returned home, but was cut to the quick when he started to tell Gigi about Shane's first school day, complete with pictures. Instead, she ordered him to pack and get out. She and Rex would pick Shane up after school, hear about his day, and tell him the truth, she added. Brody attempted to dissuade her but Gigi refused to listen to his arguments any longer. After she was gone, he received a call from Adriana. She accused him of screwing up and ruining Shane's life. He ended the call and destroyed the carriage house, breaking furniture and tossing everything to the floor. \n\n\nRoxy had a celebration for herself in honor of Grandparents' Day, complete with cake and candle. She asked Charlie to help her celebrate and, as she lit the candle, Jared arrived. Roxy realized that she hadn't seen Natalie in a while and suggested that Jared speak to Rex. Having done that already, Jared became resigned, but Charlie wouldn't allow it. He gave his son a pep talk, insisting that Jared go by his gut and not the letter. If he felt that Natalie was indeed missing, then Jared should not give up looking for her, no matter what others said, Charlie recommended. He added that if Jared loved her enough, he should fight for her. \n\n\nGigi showed up at Rex's place. She told him that they needed to tell Shane the truth after school.\n\n\n",
