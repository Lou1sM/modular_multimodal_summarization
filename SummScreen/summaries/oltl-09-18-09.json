While Starr assured her friend that Markko had eyes for only Langston, Cole and Markko rushed into the caf\u00e9 with good news.  The girls were thrilled when Cole announced that he planned to take the G.E.D. examination and attend college with Markko.  The celebration was cut short when Mrs. Rivera entered the caf\u00e9 and asked to speak privately with her son.   Langston feared Mrs. Rivera's arrival would cause Markko distress.\n\n\nMrs. Rivera inquired about Markko's living arrangements and offered him money to rent an apartment.  Mrs. Rivera's gesture caused Markko to realize that his father had no intention of allowing him to ever return home.  Pleading with his mother to accept that he and his father would never make peace, Markko declared his love for Langston and refused to end their relationship.  Mrs. Rivera stated that she was proud of her son, and rushed out of the caf\u00e9, leaving Markko distraught.   When Markko returned to his friends, Cole offered to share his apartment with Markko.  Delighted that his problem had been solved, Markko gladly accepted Cole's offer.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, a heated argument ensued between T\u00e9a and Blair.  T\u00e9a demanded to know why Blair was intent on causing problems between T\u00e9a and Todd.    Blair insisted that she was aware of T\u00e9a's big secret.  Although she denied keeping secrets from Todd, T\u00e9a appeared bothered by Blair's statement.  Realizing that she had struck a nerve, Blair continued to taunt T\u00e9a.  Referring to T\u00e9a and Todd's engagement as a sham, Blair questioned if T\u00e9a really wanted to marry Todd.\n\n\nOutside, Ross hid from Todd in the cabana.  Assuming Ross was another one of Blair's conquests, Todd ordered Ross to open the door and show his face.  While Todd continued to shout demands through the door, a terrified Ross searched the cabana for his cell phone.   Unable to persuade Ross to open the door, Todd threatened to burn down the cabana.\n\n\nInside La Boulaie, Blair exclaimed, \"I know who and what you are hiding!\"  T\u00e9a was adamant that Blair would never succeed at preventing T\u00e9a's marriage to Todd.  While Blair and T\u00e9a continued to argue, Blair received an urgent text message from Ross.\n\n\nBack outside, as Todd lit a match and prepared to burn down the cabana, Blair doused him with a bucket of cold water.  Upon hearing the commotion, T\u00e9a approached and wondered why Todd was curious to learn the identity of Blair's new suitor.   As Todd lit another match, Chad, the swimming instructor opened the door.   Realizing that T\u00e9a had fled, Todd raced after her.   Afterward, Blair thanked Chad for entering the cabana through the back door.  Once Chad had left, Blair scolded Ross for nearly being exposed.  While Blair continued to rant, Ross flirted shamelessly with her.  Pulling Blair into an embrace, Ross gave her a passionate kiss.\n\n\nTodd found T\u00e9a fuming inside La Boulaie.  Enraged, T\u00e9a suggested that Todd remain at La Boulaie with Blair.  Unable to understand T\u00e9a's logic, Todd pleaded with her to give him another chance.  Convinced that Todd would never change, T\u00e9a informed Todd that the wedding was off.\n\n\nInside his apartment at the Angel Square Hotel, Kyle was emotional as he read the newspaper article that proclaimed Fish a hero in the kidnapping caper.  Kyle became distracted when Nick knocked on the door.  Thrilled that Kyle had been readmitted to medical school, Nick announced that he wanted to celebrate his lover's good fortune.  Nick drew Kyle into an embrace, but Kyle pulled away.  Discreetly hiding the newspaper, Kyle claimed that he had to report for duty at the hospital.   \n\n\nSuspicious, Nick wondered if Kyle was actually consumed with thoughts of Fish.  Denying that he harbored any feelings for Fish, Kyle promised to return to the apartment after he finished his shift at the hospital.  Once Kyle had left, Nick discovered the newspaper that Kyle had hidden under the bed.    Staring at the article about Fish, a look of sadness crossed Nick's face.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Fish nearly panicked when his father discovered the book entitled How to Tell Your Parents You're Gay.  As Fish struggled to tell his parents about his sexuality, Mr. Fish insisted that he already knew the truth -- Cristian was a homosexual.  Convinced that Cristian was gay, Mr. Fish offered to help find counseling for Cristian.  When Cristian argued that there was nothing wrong with being gay, Mr. Fish became offended.  Declaring that his family was against homosexuality, Mr. Fish insisted that his son move out of the apartment at once.\n\n\nUnwilling to allow his father to verbally attack his friend, Fish announced that he was gay, not Cristian.     When Mr. Fish refused to believe his son's declaration, Fish pleaded with his mother to tell his father the truth.  Mr. Fish demanded answers from his wife, but Mrs. Fish denied having any information.  As Mr. Fish listened in shock, Fish revealed that his mother had observed an intimate moment between Fish and Kyle during Fish's college days.  Fish related that his mother's reaction had caused him to break up with Kyle and pretend the event had never taken place.  \n\n\n\n\nInside Brody's hospital room, Natalie paid Brody and Jessica a visit.  Realizing that her sister was withholding information, Jessica insisted that Natalie explain what was going on.   As Natalie began to warn Jessica and Brody about the threatening letter, Jared stumbled into the room, badly beaten.   Jared informed them that the stalker had attacked him at Buchanan Enterprises after Natalie had left the office.  Jared explained that he hadn't seen the face of his attacker.  \n\n\n\n\n",
