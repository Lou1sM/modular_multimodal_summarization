After informing Bo that the mayor had confiscated his files on the Ramsey murder case, John asked Bo to recover the evidence for him. \n\n\nBefore heading to the office, Todd checked on a sleeping Marty. Todd had a flashback of the day Marty taught him to play the song, \"Heart and Soul\" on the keyboard. Without waking her, a concerned Todd wished her sweet dreams. \n\n\nMarty dreamt about John. In the dream, Marty awoke to find John playing, \"Heart and Soul\" on the keyboard. John asked Marty why she was living with Todd. Aggravated, Marty told John that Todd had helped her recover from her injuries, and they intended to leave town and start a new life together. John wondered if Marty planned to give up on her old life. Stating that Todd was the only person in her life, Marty was convinced that she didn't have anything to give up. When John asked her if there might be more to her life than she was told, Marty became agitated. Marty asked John why he was taunting her about her past. Reminding Marty that the song, \"Heart and Soul\" was from her past, John insisted that she play the song with him. As they leaned in to kiss, Marty awoke from her dream. \n\n\nMeanwhile, John saw an apparition of Marty. She questioned John about his relationship with Blair. John insisted that the relationship wasn't serious. Marty wondered why John had dreamt of her. Reminding John that he only saw her when he needed her, Marty assumed that he needed her help again. Although John had no answer, Marty did. Marty believed that John was troubled because he was getting closer to both her and Blair. Marty told John that she had to go. When John questioned where she was going, Marty said that she didn't know. John leaned in to kiss Marty, but he also awoke from his dream. \n\n\nAt the loft, Gigi told a surprised Rex that she planned to tell Shane that Rex was his father. Gigi informed Rex that she had already warned Brody of her plans and that he didn't take the news very well. Both Gigi and Rex worried about Shane's reaction, but agreed that the child needed to learn the truth. \n\n\nWhen Gigi blamed herself for lying to Shane, Rex placed some of the blame on both Adriana and Brody. Rex was shocked to learn that Gigi had known all along that Adriana was aware of Shane's paternity. As they discussed details about Adriana obtaining Rex's DNA from his toothbrush, the two surmised that Brody used the toothbrush to fake the DNA test. Rex feared that Shane would never accept him as his father because he worshiped Brody. Stating that Rex was a wonderful person, Gigi was certain that Shane would grow to love him. When Rex asked how Brody would react to the situation, Gigi said that Brody would have to accept her decision and move on with his life. \n\n\nAfter trashing the cottage in a fit of rage, Brody drank himself into a drunken stupor. As Brody became emotional over losing Shane, there was a knock at the door. Outside, Marcie called out to Gigi. Brody opened the door and told Marcie that Gigi wasn't at home. Insisting that she needed to retrieve some very important papers that she had left at the cottage, Marcie brushed past Brody. Upon seeing the trashed living room, Marcie questioned what had happened. Screaming that he had lost Shane, an obviously disturbed Brody told Marcie that she was to blame. \n\n\nAccusing Marcie of brainwashing Gigi, Brody was convinced that Shane needed him. Terrified, Marcie tried to reason with Brody. Explaining that he could still have a relationship with the child, Marcie remarked that Brody needed to realize that Shane wasn't his son. Enraged by Marcie's words, Brody shattered his liquor bottle against the wall. Fearing Brody's wrath, Marcie attempted to call Gigi, but Brody stopped her. Grabbing her arm, Brody warned Marcie not to make the call. Marcie watched in horror as Brody appeared to lose touch with reality. As Brody tried to wrestle the phone from Marcie, she jerked away and fell. Marcie hit her head on the table and was knocked unconscious. \n\n\nAfter checking Marcie's pulse, Brody removed a gun from the closet. Vowing that he would never allow Rex and Gigi to take his son away, an armed Brody headed upstairs. \n\n\nBack at the loft, Rex revealed that he had told Adriana that he loved Gigi and asked for a divorce. The two embraced and Rex remarked that they were meant to be together. As they shared a passionate kiss, a frantic Roxy interrupted with news of Natalie's disappearance. Upon noticing Gigi, Roxy stated that she was delighted to have Shane as her grandson. After being asked to keep Shane's paternity a secret, Roxy was surprised to learn that Jared had already informed Rex that Natalie was missing. When Roxy asked why Rex wasn't looking for his sister, Rex informed Roxy that he had personal matters that needed his immediate attention. Realizing that Rex was referring to his son, Roxy didn't force the issue. Rex was certain that Natalie wasn't in any danger and would return home when she was ready. \n\n\nAfter Roxy had left, Rex and Gigi made plans to pick Shane up from school. They decided to tell their child the truth together. Realizing that they had quite some time before Shane's school dismissal, Rex and Gigi made love. \n\n\nAs Tess locked the basement door, she was met by a barking David Vickers. When Tess warned Tina to keep her \"mutt\" under control, a sarcastic Tina suggested that perhaps the dog realized that Tess had locked her sister in the basement. Reminding Tina that she would expose her thievery if she revealed Natalie's whereabouts, Tess cautioned Tina to keep quiet. Before heading off, Tess ordered Tina to convince Jared that Natalie had left him. \n\n\nIn the secret room, an enraged Natalie attempted to escape. Natalie hurled a chair at the glass, but the chair broke into pieces. \n\n\nTodd arrived at his office and found Tess. She had prepared a cover story for the Sun. Tess told Todd that she wanted him to print a story stating that Natalie had ended her relationship with Jared and had left town heartbroken. Todd questioned whether Tess had harmed her sister. Assuring Todd that Natalie was alive and well, Tess demanded that he write the story or risk her telling the world that he was harboring Marty in his home. Refusing to write the story, Todd warned Tess that he would physically harm her if she mentioned Marty's whereabouts to anyone. Tess taunted Todd about falling in love with Marty. Todd denied being in love with Marty and claimed that he was simply being nice to her. Fed up with Tess's threats, Todd tossed her cover story at her. Revealing that he had plans of leaving town with Marty in a few weeks, Todd ordered Tess out of his office. Before leaving, Tess made a final threat -- unless Todd printed her cover story, she would tell Marty that he had raped her years ago. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs in the kitchen, Tina found a key that Tess had apparently dropped. Believing it was the key to the basement, Tina tucked it away. Moments later, Jared entered the kitchen and asked Tina if she had heard from Natalie. Jared refused to believe that Natalie had left town. Back in the basement, Natalie turned on the television monitor and observed Jared and Tina talking in the kitchen. While Jared ranted about everyone believing that he was crazy for searching for her, Natalie begged Jared not to give up. As Jared agonized over losing Natalie, he convinced himself to allow her to return home on her own. \n\n\nFeeling sorry for Jared, Tina told him not to give up on true love. Tina stated that Jared would find Natalie no matter how hard someone tried to keep them apart. Tina's words left Jared curious, but the arrival of Roxy gave Tina an excuse to change the subject. After Roxy left, David Vickers began scratching at the basement door again. Jared tried to open the door, but discovered that it was locked. Pretending to find the key, Tina gave it to Jared. Claiming that something in the basement had spooked David Vickers, Tina urged him to find out what was downstairs. As Jared picked up the dog and walked towards the door, Natalie lost sight of him. Natalie panicked and tried to locate him on the monitor but couldn't. Jared opened the door and headed downstairs. \n\n\nTess returned home. Upon discovering the basement door opened, Tess demanded to know what was going on. Tina was at a loss for words. \n\n\nTodd returned home and checked on Marty. He found Marty in a state of confusion. When she told him about her dream, Todd questioned why she had dreamt of John. Marty had no idea, but thought Todd might.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie is still stuck in the locked room, helplessly watching the video where Tess attempts to convince Jared that she's left him. But when Tina is alone with him, she tells him she believes differently. He also gets a pep talk form Roxy and from Charlie. John is on a flight, and he's having \"dreams\" about Marty. She is sleeping in the room where Todd lives and having dreams about him. Tess discovers that Todd has \"feelings\" for Marty and warns him he better not defy her or she'll tell everybody everything. Rex and Gigi declare that they are going to be together and Shane must know that Rex is his real father regardless of the consequences, but Brody is furious at what they have done. Marcie comes by and he goes off on her knowing that she encouraged Gigi to dump him.",
