Jack admitted that he had been an eyewitness to Victor's murder, and he'd reported to John that he'd seen Todd there too. \"You didn't see me, because I wasn't there,\" Todd stated calmly to his son. Jack insisted that he had told John the truth, but Todd disagreed. He chuckled and asked exactly what Jack had said.\n\n\nJack recited the details of Sean's voicemail message that he'd overheard. \"Seriously?\" Todd asked. \"Oh come on, Scarface...you know it,\" Jack retorted. \"Do I?\" Todd inquired. Jack and Todd began to argue about the night of Victor's murder, and whether Todd had actually been present. Jack advised the cops that he was telling the truth as they began to cuff Todd and take him away. \"My son is lying,\" Todd contended. He asked to have a few words with his son, and the cops relented.\n\n\nTodd declared that he had no idea when his son had turned into a liar, but he cared about his son. Jack insisted that Todd had stolen Dorian's gun and had killed Victor with it. Todd had knocked Jack out and had stepped over him, Jack added. The men continued to argue about Todd's innocence or guilt until the cops grabbed onto Todd to take him to the station. \"You're going down, Scarface,\" Jack shouted.\n\n\nTodd proclaimed that he was getting arrested because Jack had lied. He was aware that Jack was upset, but Jack would regret it. Jack wondered if the cops had heard Todd's threat, but Todd clarified that he meant that one day Jack would really regret what he had done. He again accused Jack of making up the story.\n\n\nTodd was aware that Jack didn't know much about him, but Todd knew Jack. Todd had thought about Jack for eight years, and he didn't want to return to another jail. While it was okay for Jack to hate Todd, it would never lead to Victor's return, Todd declared. \"You'll just lose the only father you have left,\" Todd called out.\n\n\nJack was quiet as Todd continued to talk. Todd thought that John would understand if Jack wanted to take back what he'd said. Jack insisted that he knew what he'd seen. \"And I saw you,\" he said pointedly. \"I didn't do it,\" Todd replied. He advised Jack that Victor was watching.\n\n\nInside the church, T\u00e9a couldn't believe her ears when Dani revealed that Jack had claimed to have heard Victor's murder. She had thought that Jack had lost his memory. \"All of a sudden his memory's come back,\" Dani explained. Jack had informed Dani that he'd recalled the events of the night in question, and Dani recited all that Jack had told her.\n\n\nApparently, Jack's memory had returned the day before, and he'd gone to the police station, Dani told her mother. T\u00e9a was taken aback that Jack had gone to the police before telling his own family members what he had witnessed. Dani related that Jack had claimed that he hadn't wanted to upset the family and disrupt Victor's funeral.\n\n\nDani noticed that her mother was quiet, and she wondered what T\u00e9a was thinking. T\u00e9a asked Dani what she was thinking instead. Dani pointed out that they were aware that Jack hated Todd, and they were aware that Jack told lies. She wondered if he would actually lie about this though.\n\n\nT\u00e9a replied that Jack still thought of Victor as his father, and she knew that Jack was confused. Dani added that Jack believed everyone to be traitorous if they didn't go along with Jack's way of thinking. \"What about you?\" T\u00e9a asked her daughter. Dani admitted that she didn't know Todd, but she hadn't really known Victor for long either. She had also always thought that Ross had been her dad.\n\n\nBoth Victor and Ross were great, and they had both loved Dani very much, T\u00e9a asserted. Dani felt that compared to all that was going on with the brainwashing and change in fathers, things had been rather tame in the past. \"Do you think he did it?\" she asked her mother. T\u00e9a thought that she'd known Todd quite well, but he'd been locked up for eight years. Anyone might be capable of murder under the circumstances, T\u00e9a thought.\n\n\nDani wondered if Todd had always had a temper. T\u00e9a admitted that he had, but he would never have killed anyone in cold blood. They wondered again if Jack could be lying. T\u00e9a stated that she'd also known Jack once, until the accident with Gigi. Dani pointed out that Jack had lied then. \"What if he's lying again?\" Dani asked.\n\n\nDani noted that Jack wasn't the \"poster child\" for telling the truth. The women debated whether Jack might have actually been a witness to Victor's murder.\n\n\nCutter returned to his room at the Minute Man Motel and told Morris all about his horrid day at work. \"Wait a second, you look different,\" he said to the stuffed porcupine. Suddenly, Cutter recalled that Morris had been facing a different direction, though he was certain that Aubrey couldn't have moved him. Cutter knew that Morris \"creeped\" Aubrey out. He began to tell the animal how he needed the hidden gun for his future, but Aubrey walked into the room.\n\n\n\"Why are you messing with that porcupine?\" Aubrey inquired. She really hoped that Cutter had turned the gun in as he had promised he'd done. Cutter claimed that he had been \"straightening up\" for Aubrey's return. As the couple got romantic, Aubrey suggested that Cutter \"wash off work.\" She announced that she'd already picked up their dinner at the diner.\n\n\nOnce Cutter headed for the shower, Aubrey turned to Morris. \"So, Needles, level with me.\" She inquired whether Cutter was lying to her. She began to remove their dinner from the bag, and she called out to Cutter. Not getting a response, she rushed over to Morris. Just as she unenthusiastically began to pick Morris up, Cutter walked out of the bathroom.\n\n\nAubrey maintained that she had been trying to make friends with the porcupine, because she thought he was really creepy. Cutter thought it was more like she was trying to find out if Cutter had been lying to her. She insisted that she had to look for the gun, but Cutter implored her to trust him. When she knocked the animal over, she was relieved to see that Morris' hiding spot was empty.\n\n\nAubrey apologized. She should have trusted Cutter, but it was difficult. They'd been conning and lying for a long time. Cutter reminded her that they'd never lied to each other until Aubrey had fallen in love with Joey.\n\n\nCutter decided they should celebrate his first honest paycheck, and he showed it to Aubrey. He had been disappointed in the amount, and she agreed it was a \"whopper.\" She called the government criminal and offered to buy the wine herself. She advised him that he could keep his paycheck, and she promised to learn to trust him again.\n\n\nOnce Aubrey had gone, Cutter looked at Morris. \"Damn it, Kim, I know it was you.\" He was unsuccessful in trying to reach his sister on the phone.\n\n\nBack at the hospital in Kentucky, Kim told her comatose friend how Rex would be the one to solve all of their problems. She explained how Rex had changed and murdered someone, and Kim had been able to retrieve the murder weapon from Roxy's stuffed porcupine. Kim filled her friend in on all of the details surrounding the gun and who was involved. She also noted that she couldn't understand how Clint had once slept with Echo. She assumed the woman had been more attractive in the past.\n\n\nKim rambled on, making sure not to miss any details as she related events in Llanview. She explained that she needed the money to support her friend in the hospital, so she'd taken Rex's gun out of the porcupine. She'd made a deal with Echo, and if Echo managed to get all of Clint's money back to Clint, Kim would turn the gun over to Echo for Rex's protection.\n\n\nKim added that Cutter had no idea that Morris was empty or that Kim had the gun. Kim thought it was a winning situation for everyone. Her friend would get better, Clint would get his money, and Rex wouldn't get caught as Victor's murderer. Kim also explained that Clint had wanted to move the patient to Llanview, but Kim had held firm. No one could ever see her friend.\n\n\nEcho sat with Rex at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 and urged him to give all of Clint's belongings back to Clint. Rex was confused. It was obvious that Clint no longer needed any of his money or the corporate jet, and he didn't understand why Echo felt as she did. Echo recalled Kim's blackmail threat. \"I'm doing this to help you because of Gigi,\" she said aloud to Rex.\n\n\nEcho had realized that Rex's conscience was bothering him, because he really knew deep down that Gigi wouldn't have approved of Rex's activities regarding Clint. Rex considered Echo's words for a moment, but he believed that Clint had deserved everything he'd gotten. Echo admonished Rex, and she advised him that along with taking all of Clint's money, Rex had also taken Clint's pride and dignity.\n\n\n\"It made me feel good,\" Rex replied. Echo thought that things had grown worse between father and son, and she was certain that Gigi would have wanted peace between Rex and Clint. Gigi deserved to have her heart rest in peace, just as Rex and Shane deserved it, Echo said. Rex was skeptical. He insisted that Gigi had been aware of the bad feelings between Rex and Clint.\n\n\nEcho contended that she was only trying to protect Rex and save his soul. Rex thought that Echo was being overly dramatic. He informed her that he'd figured it out, and thanks to Delphina, he'd learned that Clint had held a piece of the puzzle. Rex had spoken to Clint after he'd heard Clint on the phone.\n\n\nClint had given Rex information regarding Kim's friend in the hospital in Kentucky, and Rex believed that Gigi had wanted Rex to find out about that person. Rex was planning on going to Kentucky on the private jet. Echo wondered if the sick friend really existed, but Rex was certain it was true. Clint cared about Kim, so Rex had believed Clint when he'd said he wanted to take care of the friend's hospital bills.\n\n\nRex revealed that he had actually had a decent conversation with his father. Echo asked him again to consider giving everything back to Clint, especially if Kentucky turned out to be a dead end. She thought it would give Gigi peace. It would give Rex peace too. Rex insisted he was fine, especially with Victor Lord \"out of the picture.\"\n\n\nBrody was astonished to hear Natalie reveal that Todd was being arrested due to an eyewitness who placed Todd at the murder scene. Natalie wondered why Brody was surprised. Brody replied that he'd only assumed that an eyewitness would have spoken up sooner. Natalie revealed that the witness was Jack, and his memory had just returned. She thought it peculiar, since her own memory of the fight with Marty hadn't returned yet.\n\n\nNatalie admitted that she had believed Todd when he'd said he hadn't killed Victor, but if John had obtained a warrant for Todd's arrest, then there had obviously been just cause. Natalie apologized for thinking that Brody had been involved in Victor's murder, and she had been ridiculous to suspect Brody of anything.\n\n\nBrody understood that Natalie had been \"on edge,\" because Victor had been family. Natalie added that Victor's secretary had been quite upset after she'd heard Victor and Brody arguing, but Natalie had realized that they were only words the secretary had heard. It had been a heated but meaningless argument.\n\n\nBrody was curious about John's reaction after Natalie had mentioned the secretary's information. Natalie confessed that she'd never told John anything. Brody didn't want Natalie covering up for him, but Natalie insisted that she hadn't. Since Jack had revealed that he'd overheard the murder, none of it mattered anyway, she stated.\n\n\nJack remained by Victor's grave after Todd and the cops were gone. \"The hell with Scarface,\" Jack announced. He thought that Todd deserved to go to prison. \"So what if I didn't see him.\" He was certain that Todd had killed Victor, and he asked Victor for some kind of sign.\n\n\nNothing happened, and Jack continued. He might have lied, but he'd \"nailed\" Scarface. Justice had been served. Jack was unaware that someone was watching and listening from the bushes.\n\n\nNatalie and Brody unwound at their new residence. Happily, Natalie compared Liam to Brody, and she swore that she could see Brody in their son. Brody couldn't believe that his little family was finally settled in their own place. \"We've come so far,\" he said. Later, as Natalie looked at photos, Brody stared at her. She wondered what he was doing. \"Marry me,\" he said.\n\n\nEcho received a call from Kim after Rex left for Kentucky. She told Kim to go to hell, but she asked what Kim wanted. Kim advised Echo that Echo knew. Echo asked for more time, and Kim ordered her to hurry.\n\n\nShortly after, Echo's phone rang again. \"Listen, you gold-digging whore,\" she answered. It was Roxy, though, and Echo admitted that she hadn't retrieved the gun yet. She informed Roxy that they had a major problem.\n\n\nKim also received a phone call, but she ignored it when she saw that it was Cutter. It appeared that Cutter had figured out what had happened to the gun, Kim told the unconscious patient. Kim announced that she would return after she fetched fresh water for the flowers. She opened the door of the room and saw Rex stopping at the nurse's desk.\n\n\nTodd arrived at the police station and demanded that he be allowed his one phone call. \"What the hell do you want?\" T\u00e9a demanded after she heard from Todd. \"I've been arrested for the murder of Victor Lord,\" Todd announced. He wanted T\u00e9a's help. T\u00e9a refused, and she hung up on him. Todd demanded that he be allowed another call, but the cops dragged him away from the telephone.\n\n\nDani could see that her mother was upset. T\u00e9a informed her that Todd had been arrested for the murder.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The cops come and arrest original Todd for the murder of Victor Lord Jr. and Jack admits he's the eye witness. Yet, Todd confidently affirms to his son that they both know that Jack is lying and asks him if he really wants to go through with this. But Jack tells him he's ok with having him charged with the murder of his father. However, as soon as Jack is alone to talk to his deceased father, he asks victor if he did the right thing and urges him to give him a sign. Still not having a clue what Clint and Kim's connection to Kim's friend in the hospital in Kentucky has to do with finding Gigi and/or a message she is giving to Rex, Rex still somehow knows he needs to find out what is there that may solve and unravel some mysteries for both himself and Clint. Kim has right then, threatened to turn Rex's gun over to the cops if Echo does not persuade her son to give Clint back his money. So Echo goes to find her son and attempt him to make amends with Clint and give him back his money. Rex does not listen but fuels up the Buchanan jet to Kentucky, finds the hospital and is stunned to see Kim in the very room where he goes.",

The episode ended on a cliffhanger, with the women discussing whether or not Jack would actually lie again.\n"
