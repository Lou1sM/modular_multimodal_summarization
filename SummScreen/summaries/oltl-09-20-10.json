They determined that Eli had to be alive, since the DNA on the dead body in Tahiti did not match Eli's DNA that Natalie had discovered by happenstance on an envelope in Llanview. John disclosed that he had a tail on Ross, and he was confident that they would locate Eli through his brother. John had already been informed that Ross had been on the phone for a very long time.\n\n\nIt was a beautiful day and several of Llanview's young people found themselves in the park. James told Starr that his brother had been accused of having \"inappropriate contact\" with a student, and that student was Langston. To make matters worse, Langston was the one who'd had the idea, he divulged. Starr couldn't believe that her friend had gone back to Ford at all. James wondered who had given photos to the dean, since both Ford and Langston were trying to keep their relationship a secret. Starr didn't know anything about it.\n\n\nStarr was worried about Dani, who was having a hard time, and she realized that things had probably been difficult for James, too, due to his father. James explained that he was too smart to count on anyone for anything, since things always fell through. He'd already lost his chance at college due to Ford being fired. He wasn't \"cut out\" for it anyway, he told Starr, and should probably just steal cars. Starr thought he should fight for something if he wanted it. She suggested that James apply for some kind of grant, loan, or scholarship, and she offered to help him.\n\n\nLangston admitted that she was the one who'd had Ford fired, because of all of the horrible things he had done to her in the past. Ford reminded her he had done a complete turnaround with his life and had changed, but Langston had been appalled over his intimacy with Jessica. He couldn't believe that Langston had been the one to set him up. She thought it had been \"too easy\" and explained that she had left a camera running out in his hallway. Markko would have been proud of her.\n\n\n\"Remember him?\" she asked. Ford reluctantly gave James credit, pointing out that his brother had said it was all \"too much, too fast,\" when Langston had returned, but Ford had defended her. He was in shock. He was sorry for hurting Langston, and he had been stupid and selfish. He cared for he,r though, and he was certain that their kiss had meant something. Langston noted that she had set Markko up, too, for all she had done to him behind his back. She was a coward, but she'd gotten what she'd deserved, and so had Ford.\n\n\nFord blamed himself for all that had occurred, and he noted that Langston had turned into someone he didn't even recognize. Langston admitted she almost believed in him, but everyone had warned her to stay away. Ford accused her of not only hurting him, but James as well. She had taken away Ford's job and career. Ford admitted that Langston \"got [me] good,\" but he still missed her. Langston believed that James would be fine, and both he and she would be better off without Ford.\n\n\nOn a class trip, Destiny ran into Nate and Dani as she collected two sets of leaves, one for Dani, and one for herself. Dani filled Destiny in on how Nate had rescued Dani from her two fathers, and Nate provided some extra detail. Dani explained that Ross wanted custody of Dani, and he wanted to take her back to Tahiti. She added that Todd thought the will that Ross had was a fake.\n\n\nDestiny knew that T\u00e9a had wanted Dani to remain in Llanview, which was why she had taken Dani there in the first place. Dani thought it was possible that T\u00e9a had changed her mind, especially since at first Dani had always talked about missing Tahiti. She couldn't know what her mother might have thought at the end. Destiny guessed that her brother might be more familiar, since he was the last one to be with T\u00e9a, and her death had hit him hard. Dani didn't want anything to do with Greg, since he had lied to her previously.\n\n\nShe explained that she and Todd had arrived at the hospital too late, and Greg hadn't told them that T\u00e9a had changed her mind about seeing them. He had confessed later. Destiny was certain that her brother had a good reason to lie. Nate wondered why he had confessed at all, and Destiny made it clear that her brother had never been a good liar.\n\n\nDani urged Nate to return to school for a special project, but he was worried in case Ross won custody and took Dani away. She promised she would say goodbye first, but Nate assured her they would never say goodbye. Destiny suggested that she and Dani head for the courtroom to check things out. Even though Dani had been told to stay away, Destiny reminded her that the two of them never listened to what they were told.\n\n\nGreg spent time with an unconscious T\u00e9a in a hospital room in an unspecified location. He had to talk to someone and get everything off of his chest. He felt compelled to talk to her, he confessed. He was sorry for all he'd done, but Eli had something on Greg, and so Greg didn't have a choice. He had to save his family in exchange for hurting T\u00e9a's family. He hoped that she would forgive him someday, but he couldn't even forgive himself. He had once thought that Eli was a good guy.\n\n\nRoss sat at the bar in Rodi's and spoke to Eli on the phone. Eli was surprised that Todd had pulled a gun on Ross but was stopped when Blair interceded. Eli thought it was a \"good thing we kept her around.\" The brothers spoke about the custody hearing, though Ross thought it was sad that T\u00e9a had to die in order for him to get his daughter back. The woman had been strong and amazing, and he found it difficult to understand how she had died so quickly. He also thought it had been convenient, and he implied that Eli had been involved in some way.\n\n\nEli was indignant about his brother's insinuation, and he related the last few months of T\u00e9a's life. He had been with her when T\u00e9a had her first episode, and he had insisted that she go to the hospital after she felt faint. Eli flashed back silently to the day in the courtroom when he had put something in T\u00e9a's glass of water, causing her to feel woozy. Ross knew how T\u00e9a had hated hospitals and agreed that it must have been difficult for her to go. Eli declared that it was bad news that T\u00e9a had a brain tumor, and he certainly couldn't have made that happen. He only took advantage of the situation when it was time for Dani's custody.\n\n\nAt the same time that Eli related his story to Ross, Greg told T\u00e9a his own story. He couldn't understand why she had lost consciousness originally, and he had run all kinds of tests. He was surprised when the results turned up, and he had been just about to call her, when Eli walked into Greg's office. Eli had acted worried, and he had persuaded Greg to give him the results of the tests. Greg had relayed that the tests were negative, and T\u00e9a would be fine. Greg told a sleeping T\u00e9a that she had been perfectly healthy until she met Greg, because Eli had other ideas.\n\n\nHe wanted Greg to tell T\u00e9a she was dying, and he insisted that it was necessary for both of them that she hear that. Eli had admitted that he had slipped something in her drink because he had a plan. Greg refused to listen, but Eli told Greg it was his destiny. Greg had been confused, but Eli cleared it up instantly. It was about what Greg didn't want Destiny or anyone else to know. Greg had no choice but to take orders from Eli. He had to deliver the bad news to T\u00e9a, though he had no idea why Eli wanted things that way.\n\n\nGreg had falsified reports, switched records, and prescribed medication to mimic the symptoms of a brain tumor, he continued his explanation to T\u00e9a. Eli had recommended the hospice, as well, and she had been brave and determined. Then she had changed her mind, as Greg continued to lie and deny her last wish to see her family. That had killed him, and he knew he had to do something. He couldn't kill her, but he couldn't allow Eli to destroy Greg's family. He worked many favors and got T\u00e9a back to the States. They were there at that moment, and he was waiting for her to recover, he continued. He needed a plan.\n\n\nHe had heard that Eli was dead, and he had rushed over to tell Todd the news. Then he'd received an ominous text message and had learned that Eli was still alive. Eli had faked his own death, Greg exclaimed. Greg promised to make things up to T\u00e9a, and continued with his account. He had put her into a coma to enable him to rid her body of all of the drugs he had given her previously. She would recover, he vowed, and she would get back to Todd and Dani. In the meantime, he needed to pay Eli a visit and try to convince him that he needed surgery. Actually, Eli was fine, Greg clarified, but once he got Eli onto an operating table, he would be able to kill him. He put a family photo on the table for T\u00e9a to see when she awoke.\n\n\nEli urged his brother to head for the hearing. He was waiting to hear from Greg so that he could be out of bed and on his way. Ross was engrossed in his telephone call and didn't see Natalie walk up behind him. She grabbed the phone from him and put it up to her ear silently. \"Ross?\" Eli called out. He called out twice more. \"Who is this?\" he asked. When he didn't receive an answer, he hung up. Natalie claimed that she thought it had been her phone that had been stolen. Ross replied that he didn't take things that didn't belong to him.\n\n\nJohn walked over, and Natalie apologized to Ross. She realized it wasn't her phone after all. Ross stalked off, and Natalie advised John that she was certain she had heard Eli's voice on the phone. John was unable to obtain a trace of the call, but Natalie was positive it was Eli who she'd heard. She had noted how nervous Ross had appeared. The pair discussed the hearing and contemplated the sudden show of \"brotherly love.\" They wondered what was in it for Eli and tried to figure out what his motive behind his actions could be.\n\n\nBlair and Todd arrived at the courtroom. Blair thought it was lucky that she had insisted that Todd leave his gun behind. She didn't think that shooting Ross should be one of the options that Todd had to consider. She asked how Todd was doing, and he admitted that he'd been sure he'd see T\u00e9a again, so he hadn't properly said goodbye to her when Dani did. Then the men he had hired to follow her, had lost her.\n\n\nHis attorney turned up and advised him that the case appeared complicated. The will had been drawn up, signed in front of Blair, and notarized. Todd stated that it couldn't have been T\u00e9a's signature, but the lawyer said he'd had it authenticated. Todd was certain that Eli had done something to the will, and in the meantime, he was Dani's father and her surviving parent. The attorney assured Todd that he had a strategy, and he and Blair advised Todd to control his temper during the hearing.\n\n\nAs they headed into the courtroom, Ross walked up. Blair turned and walked over to him. She shouted \"How dare you try to take Todd's child from him.\" Ross declared that T\u00e9a had wanted him to raise Dani. \"She did not, you son of a bitch, and you know it,\" Blair yelled. She accused Ross of using T\u00e9a and of setting her up when she was dying. She accused Eli of never caring about T\u00e9a, and called him a lying murderer. She hated Eli, she screamed, as she shoved Ross into the wall. She continued to hit him until Todd, hearing the commotion, ran over and pulled Blair away.\n\n\nRoss asked if Blair were fighting Todd's battles, because even though Ross couldn't get through to Blair's \"endless devotion\" to Todd, he thought that Eli had succeeded. Ross strolled into the courtroom as Blair put her head on Todd's shoulder. She cried and muttered that she hated Eli. Todd agreed that he did too.\n\n\nShortly after, the hearing started. Destiny and Dani sneaked in and hid behind a row of chairs. Ross proclaimed that he couldn't afford an attorney, but the judge didn't see a problem with that. She had examined the will and had found it to be genuine and straightforward. She awarded Ross full custody of Dani. Todd stood up and began to speak out that he was the biological father and T\u00e9a's husband. His attorney took charge quickly, and the judge agreed to listen to arguments. It was Ross's turn to stand, and he held a piece of paper in his hand. He had something to clear things up, he said. He had Dani's birth certificate, and he had been named as Dani's father.\n\n\nEli lay in his bed in the hospice and phoned Greg. He was waiting for Greg to arrive, but the doctor claimed that he had things to do. Eli threatened him, but Greg advised the killer to have patience, otherwise his blood pressure might rise and it could be fatal. Eli noted that \"life is full of unlucky accidents.\"  Later, he spoke out loud to himself. He apologized to Ross because even though his brother would receive custody of Dani, he wouldn't be seeing a lot of her. He added that Dani wouldn't see Ross either.\n\n\nStarr and Langston ran into each other at the park. Starr grilled Langston until Langston admitted that she had been the one behind Ford's dismissal and had done what she was accused of. \"So what if I did?\" she asked her friend.\n\n\nFord carried his boxful of belongings and sat down to rest, depressed and angry. He set the box down and kicked it. He looked up at a shadow and saw Nate standing there. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "For the first time, we learn that Tea never had a brain tumor and Greg lied to everybody that she did. It was because Eli threatened his family. He feels terribly guilty knowing that he made her ill so that it would appear she was dying. He stands over her bed in a private medical facility while she is unconscious. We see Eli talking to Ross, assuring his brother he will get custody of Dani and nobody will be able to prove that the Will was falsified. Little do either of them know, however, that Tea is not dead. Greg is also scaring Eli into believing that he could suffer a fatal brain injury if he does not wait and get surgery before returning to Llanview. But Greg confirms that he's lying to Eli in order to make him believe he needs surgery so that Greg can kill him. Meanwhile, in Llanview, the judge rules in Ross's favor for him to get custody of Dani. Todd and Blair are furious. Dani talks to Destiny and Nate who are really baffled. Langston confesses to Robert that she set him up. James and Starr talk and he tells her that now that Robert is fired from his professor job, he no longer has any way to get tuition to enroll in school. Starr then tells him she will help him apply for a grant or scholarship and won't let him give up on starting school at LU.",
