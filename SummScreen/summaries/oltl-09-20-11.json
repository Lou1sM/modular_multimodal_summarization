Shane showed himself, and Jack angrily wanted to know why he was there. Shane said that he was there to visit Gigi. He asked how Victor's funeral had been. Jack replied that it had been terrible, and Shane knew exactly what Jack meant.\n\n\nShane continued that the burial had been the worst, because he'd just kept thinking that it was his mother in the ground, and that she didn't belong there. They glared at each other. Shane thought it was interesting that Victor was right next to Gigi in the cemetery. Shane wondered if anyone had been arrested for Victor's murder. Jack answered that Todd had been arrested, because there'd been an eyewitness. \"Me,\" he clarified.\n\n\nShane was stunned that Jack had seen Todd murder Victor. Jack summarized what he'd told the cops. Jack had to leave, so he walked away, glaring at Shane. Shane sat down next to Gigi's grave, and told her that he intended to get justice for what had happened to her. Shane related that Jack had thought telling the cops that Todd had killed Victor had been justice. \"There's one problem,\" Shane admitted, adding, \"Jack's lying.\"\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Starr put pictures of Victor into a box. James thought the stories people had told about Victor had been amazing, and that Starr had to tell him some more. She agreed to do so the next day, because she just wanted the day to be over. Baz and Rick entered, and Starr demanded to know why Baz was with \"that sleaze.\" Rick insisted that he was there in peace. She wanted Rick gone, but Baz told her that she should reconsider.\n\n\nStarr realized that Baz had missed supporting his family at Victor's funeral because he'd been in a meeting with Rick. Baz urged her to have an open mind, because Rick wasn't a bad guy. James wondered if Baz was \"crazy or stupid.\" Starr and James reminded Baz of what Rick had done to Nate, and how it had hurt Dani, \"your cousin.\" Rick mentioned how James had stolen cars \"before you were a self-righteous jackass.\" Starr wondered where Rick got off talking to James like that, but James shot back that if he hadn't stolen cars, his father would have beaten him.\n\n\nBaz confessed that he'd already signed contracts with Rick, because he believed it was the best thing for them. Starr and Baz argued over signing the contracts, until Baz finally snapped. He spat that the music might just be a hobby for \"a snobby rich girl,\" but it was his dream. He told her to sign over her rights to the song if she didn't want to work with Rick.\n\n\nOffended, Starr let loose on Baz. \"How dare you accuse me of not taking this seriously?\" she yelled. She admitted that music had been her dream, but things had gotten in the way, \"like having a child.\" She continued that both Todd and Victor had told her not to give up on her dreams, and she promised that she was still fighting. James pulled a livid Starr away, and told her that she was too good to work with the \"lowlifes.\"\n\n\nStarr finally told Baz that she refused to sign her rights to the song away. She told him that, if he believed that Rick could do something with the song, then she was onboard. She wasn't happy about it, but reasoned that the worst that could happen would be Rick ruining the song so no one would hear it. She warned Baz that it would be the last time he made any decisions that affected her behind her back. She warned Rick that there was to be \"no sleazy business, because I'm onto you.\"\n\n\nRick assured Starr that she wouldn't regret the decision. \"I better not,\" she replied. Baz related that she'd have time to get used to the idea, because he had to go to Paris for a gig. He told her not to worry about anything, and left with Rick. Starr confided that she feared that she'd made the wrong decision. James urged her to fight for what she wanted, and left.\n\n\nJack entered, and Starr demanded to know where he'd been. He replied that he'd been at Victor's grave. Starr wanted to go home, but Jack wanted to stay at Capricorn to celebrate. He explained to a confused Starr that, because of him, \"Scarface is behind bars.\"\n\n\n\"Marry me,\" Brody said to Natalie. Stunned, she wondered where he'd gotten the thought. He admitted that he hadn't planned it, but it had to do with Victor's murder. He claimed that, when Victor had died, he'd been reminded of how short and fragile life was. He thought that he, Natalie, and Liam were a family anyway, so they should just make it official. He got down on one knee in front of Natalie, and asked her again to marry him.\n\n\n\"This is the part where you say yes. I feel like an ass,\" he said, and laughed, at Natalie's silence. She thought it was sudden, and answered no. She cited Jessica as a reason, and said that she'd never again have a relationship with her sister if she married Brody. He thought that Jessica would find a way to understand. Brody reasoned that she'd actually said no because of John.\n\n\nNatalie denied the accusation, because she realized that she and John were over. She explained that she and Brody loved spending time together, but hadn't even talked about their feelings for one another. \"I love you,\" Brody blurted out, shocking Natalie. He told her that he meant it, and wondered what they were doing if she didn't feel the same. He asked her to honestly tell him if she loved him.\n\n\n\"Maybe,\" Natalie answered. She admitted that she loved spending time with Brody, but she didn't know if she loved him. \"I'll take it. For now,\" he answered. He told her to think about his proposition, and she promised to.\n\n\nRex arrived at the hospital in Kentucky, and asked the nurse at the desk for information about a patient. Kim hid behind a bouquet of flowers, and went back into the room. The nurse asked for the patient's name, but Rex admitted that he didn't know it. He knew it was strange, but the nurse thought it sounded suspicious. He told the nurse that he knew that Kim was taking care of the patient's bills, and there was no law against telling him about Kim.\n\n\nInside the hospital room, Kim told her friend that Rex was there. She wished her friend would wake up and help Kim figure out what to do, because Rex couldn't see them. Thinking quickly, Kim pushed the help button.\n\n\nThe nurse excused herself from Rex's company, and walked away. Rex told Gigi that he was trying to fulfill her wishes not to give up. Just then, he spotted a patient list on the front desk. He started to read the list, and took out his phone in order to make notes.\n\n\nThe nurse rushed into the hospital room. She checked the patient's vitals. Finding them normal, she wondered why Kim had pressed the help button. Kim told the nurse that the man at the desk was her friend's abusive ex, who'd put her friend in the hospital. She begged the nurse to get rid of him. The nurse didn't want to get involved in a domestic dispute. She wondered why she should believe Kim, because Kim could be a criminal. Kim pleaded with the woman again, and she left. Kim prayed that the nurse would get Rex to go away.\n\n\nThe nurse returned to the front desk, and wondered what Rex was doing looking at the confidential patient list. He apologized as she took the list out of his hand, and stressed the importance of finding the patient he was looking for. The nurse told him that the patient he'd inquired about had been discharged that morning. He begged for more information, but the nurse told him to leave before she called security, so he walked away.\n\n\nKim emerged from the room, and thanked the nurse. Just then, Rex returned because he'd forgotten his phone on the desk. He was surprised to see Kim standing there. He asked about her sick friend, but Kim told him that it was none of his business. Rex updated Kim on all that he'd seen and heard between Gigi and Delphina, and thought that it was important to find out who Kim's sick friend was. He begged Kim to tell him.\n\n\nKim lied that her friend was a fellow dancer name Annie Edwards. Annie's abusive ex had put her in the hospital, and she'd been discharged earlier. Rex related that it was miraculous that Annie was going home, because Clint had told Rex that Annie had been too sick to be moved. Kim admitted to lying to Clint, and claimed that Annie couldn't leave because she'd been in trouble with the cops.\n\n\nKim continued that Annie's family had taken care of the bills, and that Kim was only there to collect Annie's things from her room. She hoped Rex found what he was looking for. He related that he wouldn't give up, and walked away. Kim returned to the room, and said, \"He's gone, thank God! That was a close one, Stacy!\" Kim vowed not to let Rex see her friend.\n\n\nJohn was in his office when Bo entered. John asked about the break Bo had had in the Victor Lord murder case. He revealed that he'd arrested Todd for the crime, because the mayor had given him no choice. He continued that Todd was \"kicking and screaming\" that he was innocent. Bo knew that John thought Todd was innocent, and John knew that they had no case against Todd without the gun. Bo explained that the mayor had found Jack's statement persuasive, but sensed that John thought Jack was lying. \"He's in custody for the one thing he didn't do,\" John said of Todd.\n\n\nBo wondered who else John thought could have murdered Victor. John suggested Rex, but Bo didn't think that Rex was capable of murder. John related that Rex had changed after Gigi died, and had done a lot to go after Victor. He continued that Rex had been crazy with grief, which made people do strange things. John also suggested that Irene could have been involved.\n\n\nTodd was led to a holding cell, uncuffed, and locked up. He claimed that he hadn't murdered Victor, even though he'd wanted to. He threw a chair in frustration. \"Careful son, you could hurt yourself,\" he heard Irene say from the next cell. She urged him to call her mom, but he related that it would be \"a cold day in hell\" before he did. She felt guilty for the mistakes she'd made as a mother, but Todd told her that she made \"Joan Crawford look like Donna Reed.\"\n\n\nIrene was glad that Todd had been successful in his \"mission\" to kill Victor. Todd insisted that he was innocent, and that he was only there because someone had falsely placed him at the scene. Irene knew it had been Jack. Todd was stunned that she knew, but she only said, \"I have my ways.\" Todd admitted to taking the gun, but insisted he had never fired it. He related that the cops would know that if the person who had the gun hadn't \"gone AWOL.\"\n\n\nIrene thought it was too bad that Louie had gone missing. Todd realized that Irene had made Louie disappear. He told her that he had thought of something that she could do to assuage her guilt. However, she wanted him to do something for her first. She alluded to something of hers that Todd had had for a \"long, long time,\" that she wanted back. He didn't know what she wanted, and assured her that he didn't have whatever it was.\n\n\nIrene advised him not to tell anyone his \"crazy theory\" about her making Louie disappear. If he did, she assured him that the gun that could exonerate him would never be found. A cop entered, and told Irene that John had questions for her. As the cop cuffed Irene, she told Todd to think about her offer. \"A boy's best friend is his mother,\" she said as the cop led her away.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and John both admit they doubt that original Todd murdered Victor Lord and believe it's very possible that Jack is lying even though Jack somehow knew how to \"appear\" to know what happened. Original Todd gets taken to jail although he protests he did not do it. Right then, Irene goes to see him and he concludes that he knows she has framed him and might very well have killed not only killed Victor but also \"arranged\" to make both Louie and the gun disappear so that he got framed for the murder. she all but admits she has and that she can help him find the gun to get exonerated if he does what she wants. Brody proposes to Natalie and she tells him no. He concludes it must be because of John. Rick convinces Bas to sign a contract with him so that Bas and Starr can produce music together. Starr and James are adamantly against her working with Rick. But she reluctantly agrees to do it when Rick tells her that their dream will be ruined if they don't work with Rick and tells her she is not serious the way he is. Rex goes to the Kentucky hospital knowing that there is something of significance there regarding Gigi although he does not know specifically what it would be. Kim notices him and attempts to urge the nurse to get rid of him by telling her he's dangerous. But he is able to stay and is very surprised to see her there. He then urges her to tell her what she knows. But she realizes she better not and then she reveals that she is keeping Stacy, Gigi's sister, in the private hospital room and needs to keep a secret that Rex must never know.",
    "soapcentral_condensed": "Starr and Baz argued over signing the contracts, until Baz finally snapped. Starr wanted to go home, but Jack wanted to stay at Capricorn to celebrate. James urged Starr to fight for what she wanted, and left with Rick. Brody said to Natalie, \"Scarface is behind bars, so make it official in front of him\" He got down on one knee, and said, \"Marry me, Natalie. Marry me\" The episode also featured a visit from Shane, who told Jack that he intended to get justice for Gigi's death, even though Jack was lying about the murder of Victor, and that he'd been at the funeral for the victim, as well as at the burial of his mother, Gigi. The episode ended on a cliffhanger, with Brody telling Starr that he was going to propose to Natalie in the middle of the night, but that she'd have to wait until the next day to find out if it was true.\n"
