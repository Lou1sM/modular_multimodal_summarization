Adriana arrived at the station demanding to see Bo. She wanted her mother locked up for the rest of her life. Rex tried to calm her down and think about what she was doing, but Adriana was tired of forgiving Dorian for her misdeeds. Bo advised Rex not to get involved. \n\n\nThe Cramer women all gathered for lunch so Kelly and Blair could interrogate Dorian about her latest arrest. The gals lashed out at their aunt for being the one behind Adriana's stalking and demanded to know why she would do it, so Dorian began her version of her tale (which was complete with flashbacks). She told her nieces about meeting Bruce at that very bar and stated that, of course, she was completely innocent in the entire plan. (The flashbacks, however, proved otherwise.) Dorian requested that Kelly and Blair help her out and get Adriana to talk to her. Before the ladies could further discuss the situation, David arrived and revealed Spencer had been arrested \u2014 again. Blair immediately headed to the police station. Later, Adriana showed up at the Country Club. Dorian was extremely pleased and put forth great effort to reconcile with her daughter. Unfortunately, all Adriana had to say to her mother was \"I quit\" \u2014 Crazed, that is. \"I'm no longer your employee or your daughter.\" \n\n\nSpencer was a very popular jailed man today. His first visitor was none other than John McBain, there to confront the person behind his father's murder. He was pleased her could finally take comfort in knowing Spencer was behind bars. \"If by some miracle you end up getting off, make no mistake, I will kill you myself,\" the detective warned before leaving. Next up? David. He was finally able to dismiss Spencer from his life for good. As David was leaving, Spencer cryptically warned him that he'd regret what he did once he found out all Spencer knew. After David left, Hugh arrived to see his dad, but they didn't exactly have a father-son bonding moment. Spencer wasn't alone for long once his son parted \u2014 Blair arrived soon after. \n\n\nAfter leaving Spencer, John ran into an old family friend, Pete, at the station. John was pleased to inform Pete that his dad's killer was behind bars. Pete then gave John a Christmas present that he had found in his basement. It was from Tom. He had hid it at Pete's house, but didn't survive to give it to his son. The gift was a special Patrol man's hat for a child. John was touched and thanked Pete, for the gift and the tip. Pete assured John how proud his father must be right now, and John couldn't help but tear up. Later, during a chat with Bo, John sighed and stated that with Spencer now behind bars, it was time he said goodbye to his father. \n\n\nIn Angel Square, Michael informed Hugh that he was starting the adoption proceedings for baby Tommy. Speaking of becoming a parent, Hugh revealed Spencer was his biological father. After Hugh told him the whole sordid tale, he left and Michael had a little one-on-one time with Tommy. Later, John arrived and had a poignant moment with his brother before leaving for his father's grave. Meanwhile, at home, Natalie arranged for a surprise for John, to celebrate moving forward with his life. Unfortunately, as John was driving, he took his eyes off the road  and was headed right for an accident. \n\n\n",
