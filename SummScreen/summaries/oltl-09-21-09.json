Rex expressed concern over Schuyler's attraction toward Gigi.   When Bo related that it was terrible to place oneself in the middle of someone else's relationship, Rex was adamant that different circumstances existed in regards to Bo and Nora.  Refusing to admit his feelings for Nora, Bo acknowledged that he and Nora shared a special moment, but insisted that he had made a mistake by interfering in Nora's relationship with Clint.   Stating that Nora and Clint were happily married, Bo informed Rex that if Rex's relationship with Gigi was solid, Rex had no reason to worry about Schuyler's desire for Gigi.\n\n\nAt Angel Square Park, Gigi encountered Schuyler, who was worried about his teaching career.  Confiding that he hadn't heard from the school board, Schuyler informed Gigi that he couldn't resume his teaching career until the school board granted approval.  Reminding Schuler that she was friends with Viki and Rex was close to Bo, Gigi offered to use her connections to help Schuyler get his job back.  Schuyler was certain that Rex would never help him.  Explaining that Rex had agreed to accept her relationship with Schuyler, Gigi insisted that Rex understood that it was possible for an innocent friendship to exist between a man and a woman.  Schuyler didn't appear convinced by Gigi's statement.\n\n\nAs Schuyler and Gigi strolled through the park, Gigi admitted that she was experiencing trouble confiding in Rex about her suspicions regarding Stacy.  Gigi told Schuyler that Stacy had talked Rex into postponing the paternity test until Stacy gave birth.   Expressing her fear that Rex was actually excited about the birth of his child, Gigi was convinced that Rex would spend most of his time with his newborn and have very little time for her and Shane.   Schuyler reminded Gigi that Rex would never fall in love with Stacy, but Gigi countered, \"But he will fall in love with his child!\"\n\n\nAlthough Rex was certain that neither Stacy nor Schuyler could cause Rex and Gigi to breakup, Rex wondered if Gigi could ever accept his child.  Bo assured Rex that things would work out after the baby was born.  When Rex asked Bo for advice on how to explain the situation to Shane, Bo related that he was the last person to seek parental advice from, because his own son was suing him.    Explaining that a relationship took work, Bo advised Rex to take action or risk watching his relationship deteriorate.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, T\u00e9a called off her wedding to Todd.  Recalling Todd's attempt to murder Blair's suitor in the cabana, T\u00e9a was convinced that Todd was still in love with Blair.  Todd claimed that he was only concerned with his children, but T\u00e9a insisted that Todd and Blair both continued to use their children as an excuse to hide their true feeling for each other.   T\u00e9a believed that Todd was curious about what Blair and her lover were doing in the cabana at that very moment.\n\n\nInside the cabana, Blair rejected Ross Rayburn's advances.   Ross insisted that Blair had enjoyed his kiss, but Blair stated that she wasn't impressed.   When Ross accused Blair of saving herself for Todd, Blair claimed that she was only concerned with her children's welfare.   Ross doubted that Blair was over Todd.   Blair was startled when Ross suggested that Blair consider a relationship with him.\n\n\nUnable to form a physical connection with Blair, Ross asked how long he would have to remain hidden in the cabana.  A conniving Blair announced, \"Until I'm ready to drop the bomb!\"   Blair related that she might reveal Ross's existence at the wedding.  Citing that T\u00e9a had stormed off in a fit of anger, Ross wondered if a wedding would actually take place.   Ross was certain that he and Blair could have fun together if she wasn't in love with Todd.  \n\n\nFed up with Ross' antics, Blair sneered, \"You'll have to settle for me dropping the criminal charges against you.  Afterward you can go back to your little island and we won't have to see each other again!\"  As Blair exited the cabana, Ross muttered, \"You never know!\"\n\n\nBack inside La Boulaie, T\u00e9a pleaded with Todd to be honest concerning his feelings for Blair.  T\u00e9a reminded him about the escapade on the island, in which Todd abandoned her for Blair.   Although Todd insisted that things had changed, T\u00e9a believed that Todd would abandon her again.   Proclaiming his love for T\u00e9a, Todd vowed to stand by her side.  Down on bended knee, Todd asked T\u00e9a to marry him that day.  \n\n\nAs Todd proposed to T\u00e9a, Blair entered and eavesdropped on the conversation.  Claiming that she wanted a special ceremony, T\u00e9a insisted that she couldn't marry Todd that night.   Understanding T\u00e9a's dilemma, Todd asked her to marry him in a week.  Disturbed by what she had overheard, Blair rushed off and informed Ross that Todd and T\u00e9a planned to marry within the week.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Todd and T\u00e9a discussed wedding plans.  Todd insisted that he didn't want Blair in the vicinity of the ceremony, but T\u00e9a stated that she wanted Blair in attendance.\n\n\nBack inside the cabana, Blair told Ross that it was necessary to find out the exact date and location of the wedding so that Ross could make an appearance.  A confident Blair exclaimed, \"Oh, I'm going to rub T\u00e9a's marriage to you right in her smug little face!\"\n\n\nAs Todd and T\u00e9a celebrated with a kiss, she received a call from the courthouse.   While T\u00e9a stepped away to answer the call, Todd phoned someone and made plans for a lavish wedding.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Rachel expressed guilt over dating Shaun while she was attracted to his brother.  When Rachel insisted that Greg had helped her to realize that she was afraid of taking risks, Nora was adamant that Rachel had reason to guard her feelings.  Stating that she had a tendency to interfere in the lives of others, Rachel apologized for meddling in Nora's relationship with Clint.   Maintaining that she was in love with Clint, Nora emphasized that Rachel had helped Nora answer some important questions regarding her feelings for Bo.\n\n\nSensing Rachel's extreme guilt, Nora asked her daughter if she was concerned about being torn between two brothers.  Stressing that she wasn't involved with Greg, Rachel claimed that he had helped her to realize that she shouldn't pursue a relationship until she became aware of what she actually wanted.   Rachel told Nora that she had plans to visit Shaun at the hospital.  When Nora inquired about his condition, Rachel informed her mother that the longer Shaun remained in an unconscious state, the greater the likelihood that he would never wake up.  Before leaving, Rachel admitted that she felt terrible for Greg and wondered what she would say to him.\n\n\nInside Shaun's hospital room, a guilt-ridden Greg pleaded with his brother to wake up.  As Greg cried at his brother's bedside, an apparition of Shaun appeared and accused Greg of purposely placing Shaun in a coma.  Contending that Greg was jealous of Shaun's relationship with Rachel, the image of Shaun charged Greg with acting unethically, by ignoring the risk involved in operating on his brother.  Yelling at his hallucination, Greg insisted that he had hoped to save his brother's life.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Matthew presented Destiny with a medal that the Llanview Police Department had issued in Shaun's honor.  When Matthew asked about Shaun's progress, Destiny announced that Greg would \"fix\" her brother.\n\n\nLater, Matthew ran into Bo at the caf\u00e9.  Recounting his conversation with Destiny, Matthew mentioned that Destiny believed Greg would perform a miracle surgery and heal Shaun.    Advising his son that Greg wasn't perfect, Bo told Matthew that something had gone seriously wrong during Shaun's surgery, and that Greg could possibly make a mistake if he performed surgery on Matthew.  Acknowledging that he realized that Greg wasn't perfect, Matthew related that his surgery was in no way similar to Shaun's surgery.   Insisting that Greg might make another mistake during Matthew's operation, Bo related that he wasn't willing to take that chance.\n\n\nBack inside Shaun's hospital room, Greg kneeled at his brother's bedside and cried, \"I tried to save your life!  Tell me what I can do to fix it!  You can't die Shaun, I won't let you!\"  Greg was startled to discover a teary-eyed Rachel standing in the doorway.\n\n\nUpon observing Gigi and Schuyler at the park, Rex stood nearby and eavesdropped on their conversation.  Rex listened as Gigi confided in Schuyler that she loved Rex but felt that they were growing further apart.  Gigi related how happy they had been, before Stacy announced that she was pregnant.  Gigi feared she and Rex could never have the future they had once dreamed of.   Desperate to speak with Gigi, Rex approached the couple, and Schuyler quickly excused himself.  Gigi was stunned when Rex proposed marriage.\n\n\nBack at the Buchanan Mansion, Matthew apologized to his parents about the events that had transpired between them.  Stating that he had given the matter a lot of thought, Matthew said that he realized how important his family was to him.  As he announced that he had something very important to tell them, T\u00e9a phoned and interrupted Matthew's declaration.   Matthew stood silent as T\u00e9a reported that a verdict had been reached in his case.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Matthew observes what has happened to Shaun when Greg attempted to perform miracle surgery, he gets ready to tell his parents that he may be reconsidering letting Greg perform surgery on him. But before he can tell them that, he gets a call from Tea informing him that the verdict has come in from the courthouse. Todd tells Tea that he wants to marry her. But she's concerned that he is still not over Blair. Ross wants to be with Blair and wishes she was over Todd. But she clearly indicates to him that she is not. Gigi talks to Schuyler alone about the problems she's having with Rex and Stacy and the baby. She admits that she and Rex are being driven further and further apart. But right then, Bo encourages Rex to not give up on Gigi. So Rex goes and finds Gigi, right when she is talking to Schuyler and appears to want to propose to her.",

The two of them were reunited at the end of the episode. The episode ended on a cliffhanging cliffhanger, as Todd was about to kill Blair's suitor in the cabana and T\u00e9 was on the verge of doing the same to him.\n"
