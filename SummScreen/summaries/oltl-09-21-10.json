    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the courtroom, as Destiny, Dani, and Blair stooped hidden behind the benches, Ross handed the judge Dani's birth certificate, which the judge called \"compelling evidence.\"  Todd insisted that custody of Dani should be awarded to him, because T\u00e9a had been his wife, and Dani was his daughter.  Todd claimed that he would not leave, until the judge \"got that.\"  When Todd stated again that he was Dani's biological father, the judge asked Todd and Ross to respect the process and informed them that she wanted to hear the evidence.\n\n\nThe judge asked Todd why he should raise Dani.  \"Because I'm...uh...she's...heh, heh, God, she's everything I want right now in the whole world.  I don't know what I'd do without her.\"  Ross stressed that the only thing that mattered to Todd was Todd, and that everything was always all about him.  Todd reminded the court that he had not known that Dani had even existed.  When Blair testified as a character witness for Todd, she verified that Todd had always loved all of his children, and that he \"would walk through fire for any of them.\"  However, Ross insisted that T\u00e9a had known about Todd's past and could never trust him.\n\n\nRoss believed that T\u00e9a would never leave Dani with \"a killer, an abuser, a rapist.\"  Todd admitted that he had a shady past but questioned why Ross was hiding in the South Pacific and had lived under two different names.  Todd then exclaimed that he loved Dani and had supported her through the worst time in her life.\n\n\nRoss claimed that the will spoke for itself, yet Todd claimed that the will was a forgery.  Blair backed up Todd's claim that he did love Dani.  Destiny jumped up from behind the bench and demanded to know why no one had asked Dani what she wanted.\n\n\nDestiny informed the judge that she represented Dani Rayburn, and the judge requested that Dani please take the stand.  Once Dani reached the stand, she placed her hand on the Bible.\n\n\nThe judge asked Dani how she felt.  \"The truth?  I feel alone.  I miss my mom.  And it hurts that I miss her so much.\"  Dani declared that she did not want to hurt either of her dads but admitted that Todd had been good to her.  However, Dani exclaimed that when she looked at Ross, she saw her whole life, since he had raised her.  \"How do you expect me to choose?  I care about them both.\"\n\n\nNate entered, as the judge stated that she would deliberate and return with her ruling.  Dani begged Nate to take her out of the courtroom, and they walked out together.  Ross informed Todd that the memory of Dani's exit from the courtroom would be Todd's last memory of Dani.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Gigi studied the letter from Llanview University that awarded her the Live and Learn Grant.  Kelly and Rex ran in.  Rex told Kelly that he wanted to be the one who took the risk with Clint.  \"This is what you pay me for.  If Clint knows you hired me to find David, he'll be suspicious of me.  What if he catches you?\"  Kelly asked, \"What's he going to do?  Is he going to throw the mother of his great grandchild in jail?  We're family.\"\n\n\nGigi welcomed Kelly and Rex, and Kelly immediately said that she had to leave.  Gigi remarked, \"That makes me feel better.\"  Gigi made Rex promise that Kelly would not get Rex \"arrested or dead.\"  Gigi then announced that she had received the grant.  Rex grabbed Gigi in his arms and hugged her.\n\n\nIn Clint's office at Buchanan Enterprises, Clint laughed at a picture of David in jail.  Clint then admitted that he was having \"way too much fun\" with David's dilemma.  The assistant, who had handed Clint the photo, advised Clint that the warden wanted more money, because David was a big star in Morocco.  David had appeared in Pretty People Crime Go Bust, a super model crime club, and had a huge fan club, which made security a problem in Morocco.  Clint told the assistant to double the warden's salary, but to keep Clint's name out of it, just as Matthew arrived at the office door.\n\n\nMatthew introduced himself to Clint's assistant, who did not respond.  Clint dismissed his assistant and insisted that the man was Clint's \"handyman, one of B.E.'s secret weapons.\"  When Matthew asked what the \"handyman\" did, Clint stated, \"Anything I ask...unofficially.\"  Matthew pondered if Clint really meant illegally.  Clint joked that Matthew must mean that Clint was a drug dealer.  Matthew realized that he had used the wrong word, because the talk had seemed \"private.\"\n\n\nMatthew mentioned that he was just an intern and was willing to learn, and Clint commented that Matthew was lucky that he was not \"mucking out stalls,\" as Clint and Asa had done when they had first started.  However, Clint believed that Matthew would be in the boardroom in no time at all.  Clint pointed out that although the law was cut and dry, things at B.E. were gray.  Clint stated that Matthew was the future of B.E., as Kelly knocked on the door.\n\n\nWhen Kelly asked if Clint were ready for lunch, Clint pulled out his wallet, which he had laid on his desk, and revealed that he had something to give to Matthew.  As Clint handed a set of keys to Matthew, Kelly snatched Clint's passkey out of his wallet.  Clint informed Matthew that he would start out by making copies.  After Kelly suggested it, Kelly and Clint decided to eat at Rodi's.\n\n\nKelly returned to Rodi's and asked for a table for two.  Rex understood that Kelly had been successful in her mission.  Rex informed Gigi that even though he had to leave, he would not be long.  Rex then insisted that he wanted to hear all about Gigi's school supplies when he returned.\n\n\nAt the table, Clint and Kelly discussed Zane, and Clint thought that Zane should be in Llanview.  Clint stressed that Zane had family in Llanview, and that he hoped that Zane would be able to learn about the B.E. business.  However, Clint claimed that he did not know how long he would be able to keep B.E. afloat, if Kelly and Rex did not \"give up the crusade to bring David Vickers back to Llanview.\"\n\n\nAs Matthew carried two boxes out of Clint's office, Rex watched, unseen.  Rex then took Clint's passkey to open the office door.  \"Okay, Clint, what are you hiding, and where are you hiding it?\"  On Clint's computer, Rex discovered flight plans scheduled for the day that Dorian was to have married David and then used his Blackberry to determine that Clint had flown to Morocco on the day of the wedding.  Rex pried open a desk drawer.\n\n\nKelly revealed that Dorian needed to see David \"one last time,\" so that she could recover, but Clint believed that Kelly needed to \"do right by the Buchanan side of the family\" for a change.  Kelly doubted that David would hurt the Buchanans, however, Clint disagreed.  \"David plays the buffoon, but it's a diversion.  It's an act of his.  He's a con man.  He's survived his entire life being a con man.  And he's had more than one run at the Buchanan money.\"\n\n\nKelly thought that David had money, and Clint informed her that David did get a settlement, but that he had really wanted B.E.  Clint felt that it would be better for everyone, including Dorian, if David stayed gone.  Kelly thought that Clint was exaggerating, but Clint insisted that David was \"just bad news.\"  Kelly agreed, and as Clint grabbed the bill for the food, he gave Kelly a goodbye kiss on the cheek.  Kelly reached for her phone.\n\n\nRex answered his phone to Kelly and exclaimed, \"You would not believe what I am looking at.\"  Kelly warned Rex that Clint was on his way back to B.E.  Rex grabbed his briefcase and opened the office door to Matthew, who asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\nGigi walked up to Kelly and asked if Kelly had a minute to talk.  \"It's about Rex.\"\n\n\nIn the park, Langston told Starr that Ford had received a taste of his own medicine.  Langston then admitted that she had been willing to give Ford another chance, until she had heard about what he had done to Jessica.  \"Ford's just a dog who's never going to change.\"\n\n\nStarr informed Langston that Bobby Ford was not the only one who had deserved another chance, and told her about James.  However, Langston was determined not to feel guilty and insisted that Bobby could have refused to take the bait.  \"Ford's going to be just fine.\"\n\n\nStarr wondered why Langston was not celebrating, and Langston admitted that gloating over Ford's downfall was not her.  Starr agreed and stated that it did not appear that Langston felt good about what she had done, and Langston claimed that she did not.\n\n\nLangston had seen how happy Ford had been when he had believed that they had another chance together.  Langston realized that she had seen the same expression on Ford's face when he learned of Langston's betrayal as she had seen on Markko's after he had found out that she had cheated on him.  Starr claimed that Langston could undo \"the lousy thing\" that she had done to Ford, and that she could report her plot to the dean.  But, Langston was worried that she would be expelled from the university.  Starr insisted that Langston could always attend another university, however, Bobby would never get another teaching position if that were to stay on his record.  Starr asked Langston to consider what she had said and left.\n\n\nIn another area of the park, after Ford kicked his box of belongings that he had removed from the university, Nate asked if Bobby was okay.  When Ford bent down to retrieve his stuff, Nate started to help.  Bobby yelled, \"No.  You don't help.\"\n\n\nFord called Nate spoiled, and Nate reminded Bobby that he was working two jobs and had just been evicted from his home.  Ford relented and revealed that he had just been fired, because he had totally \"screwed up.\"  Nate mentioned their mother and insisted that he and Inez had never talked about Bobby, because it \"hurts her too much.\"  Ford refused to care.  Nate cried, \"Do you know how many people would kill to have one more day with their mom?\"\n\n\nWhen Bobby compared Inez to a wounded bird, Nate screamed for Ford to shut up.  Nate threw Ford's award, which broke.  Nate then noticed that Bobby had won the Vallardo Award and informed Bobby that he had not realized that Bobby was \"that Ford.\"  Nate exclaimed that he had seen Bobby's film that had won the award.  Nate insisted that he would have an expert fix Ford's award and would later return it to Bobby.  As Nate started to leave, Ford called out and claimed that Nate knew \"his stuff.\"  Bobby joked that was a good thing, since Nate's pitching arm \"sucked.\"  Nate laughed, as he walked off.\n\n\nFord carried his box of belongings, as he walked by the university building, and he spotted Langston.  When Langston noticed Bobby, she sighed, put her purse over her shoulder, and rushed off.\n\n\nIn the hall at the university, James found that the Live and Learn Grant had already been awarded.  Inez greeted James and related that she had been thinking of both James and Bobby, since school had started.  James informed Inez that Bobby had just been fired, so James would have to quit school.  When Inez asked why Ford had been fired, James would only say that it had been because of a scam.\n\n\nInez wanted to fix the problem, but James insisted that it was not her problem to fix.  James continued to refuse Inez's help.  \"Cause it's not like you're really my mom anyway.\"  James revealed that he had always wanted a mother, especially when his father had been hitting him, or when something stupid like Parent's Day, Halloween, or making pancakes, had arisen.  Inez asked what costume James had worn on Halloween, and James said that his pirate costume had him laughed out of school, so he had quit.  However, James added that he had learned how to make pancakes.  James insisted that he could take care of himself, and that he no longer needed a mom.  Inez apologized for \"not being there\" for James and left.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Inez took a sip of wine.  Clint peered over her shoulder and asked, \"Do you want to talk about it?\"  Inez sadly smiled.\n\n\nIn the park, Starr found James in tears, as he attempted to hide his face from her.  \"Hey, James, what's wrong?  Are you okay?\"  James grabbed Starr and kissed her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Matthew starts his first day as Clint's new intern at B.E., Clint is meeting with one of his \"contacts\" who is keeping David Vickers in the Moroccan prison for him and making it appear that David is making a spectacle of himself on Facebook. Matthew observes how his uncle does things a bit differently than his parents do and inquires if Clint's \"relationship\" with this guy might be illegal when he senses that Clint is keeping a secret. Right then, Kelly enters the office to get Clint to go to Rodi's with her so that Rex can get into Clint's office and attempt to find out what Clint is up to regarding David's disappearance. It appears that Rex uncovers some information that Kelly can use and she makes sure he's out of there before Clint catches him. But as soon as Rex gets out the door, Matthew catches him and asks what he's doing there. Meanwhile, Starr convinces Langston that even if Robert Ford deserves to experience cause and effect for his behaviors, setting him up and getting him fired is not the thing to do. She tells her that it's not just Robert who is suffering consequences. James is prevented from having an education after his brother is no longer a faculty member when James has not done anything wrong. James meets up with Inez and admits that he lost out on having a mom. He cries alone and Starr rushes to him. He ends up kissing her. Robert runs into Nate and at first is unfriendly to his younger brother. But they find out that they are both have a passion for theater and Robert becomes interested in talking to Nate at that point. In court, Todd Ross and Blair all testify about who should get custody of Dani. But Destiny sneaks in unseen with Dani and suddenly stands up to make her presence known, introduces herself to the judge, and urges them all to stop arguing and think about what Dani wants. At that point, the judge lets Dani testify. She admits there is no simple answer. She does not want to choose between Todd and Ross. She loves them both and knows choosing either one will hurt the other. And she tells them that nothing is ok as long as her mother is gone.",
