He gasped when he saw a figure sitting in the dark, and his first thought was that it was Gigi. It was Natalie, and he filled her in on his unsuccessful trip. He wondered why she had been sitting in the dark. He sensed that something was wrong. \"Brody proposed to me tonight,\" Natalie informed him.\n\n\nRex was surprised. \"Great?\" he asked as he looked at Natalie's face. \"Maybe, maybe not,\" she replied. She added that it had been out of nowhere, and she'd had no idea of what to say. She'd told Brody she would have to think about it, but she had assured him that it had nothing to do with John. Rex wondered if that were really true.\n\n\nNatalie admitted that John still couldn't forgive her for lying, so she'd had to give up and move on. Rex inquired whether Natalie loved Brody. She replied that she did, but Rex asked if she were in love with Brody. \"Are you still in love with John?\" Rex asked. Natalie agreed that part of her would always love John, and John didn't love her anymore. She thought that a life with Brody was possible.\n\n\nBrody had lots of great qualities, Natalie pointed out. He was also a great father, and a good boyfriend. \"Brody's perfect,\" she decided. She thought that maybe she didn't have to love Brody in the same way as she loved John. Rex wondered if she were trying to convince Rex or herself.\n\n\nRex confessed that Gigi had been the love of his life, though he'd been with Adriana when Gigi had shown up. He had known he'd made a mistake to marry Adriana, and it had taken a long time to fix his mistake. He would have done anything for Gigi. Natalie agreed that Brody would do anything for her, and he \"touches my heart,\" Natalie insisted. He was her son's father, and they always had a good time together.\n\n\nNatalie wondered if that were enough to have a relationship, and she asked Rex what she should do. Rex advised her that she would be the only one who could answer that. She reminded Rex that he'd said he would have done anything for Gigi, so she wondered if he were going to give up on Gigi. Rex asked what he should do. With a little bit of attitude, Natalie informed him that he was the only one who could answer that.\n\n\nIn the Kentucky hospital room, Kim assured Stacy that she'd taken care of Rex, and she would have to do the same with Cutter and the gun. Kim promised to return, but she needed to refresh herself with a walk around the hospital. She stepped out of the room. \"Hello sis,\" Cutter exclaimed. Kim was shocked, but she advised him that she had no time to talk to him. Angrily, Cutter declared that he'd trusted Kim, but she'd stolen the gun from him to blackmail Rex.\n\n\n \"The deed is already done,\" Kim replied. Cutter found it difficult to believe that Kim was already blackmailing Rex. Kim insisted that it wasn't about Clint, and she only wanted money for her friend's hospital bills. \"I need that gun,\" Kim said firmly. She added that she'd done Cutter a favor when she'd removed the gun from Morris. Aubrey had believed that Cutter had turned it in to the police.\n\n\nCutter ran into Stacy's room. \"Whoa,\" he said as he looked around. Kim was sure she'd told Cutter about her friend, but Cutter insisted she'd left a \"big chunk\" out of her story. Kim emphasized that she couldn't lose Stacy, and she needed the gun to ensure that. Cutter felt bad. He'd really intended to do the right thing until Kim had stolen the gun from him. He wondered what would happen if Aubrey learned the truth.\n\n\nKim was confident that Cutter could make something up, because he had always been a good liar. Cutter thought the situation \"takes the prize.\" He wondered what Kim would do if Echo didn't follow Kim's orders. Kim assumed that Echo would do whatever she had to do to save Rex.\n\n\nCutter agreed to allow Kim to keep the gun, and she had one more favor to ask. She begged him not to tell anyone about Stacy. Cutter promised that he would remain silent. He figured that no one would believe him anyway.\n\n\nRoxy met with Echo at Rodi's to hear about Echo's visit with Cutter. Echo confessed that she'd been unable to obtain the gun, and that Kim had taken ownership of it. Echo explained that Kim had threatened to go to the police about Rex killing Victor, if Echo didn't give Kim what she wanted. Roxy insisted that Echo follow Kim's orders, but Echo advised her that Kim had demanded that Rex return all of Clint's belongings back to Clint.\n\n\nEcho revealed that she'd already attempted to convince Rex to do that, and she'd told him that Gigi wouldn't have appreciated all that Rex had done. Rex hadn't bought it. Roxy thought that it was time to tell Rex the truth. She and Echo believed that Rex had killed Victor. Echo thought there might be another way, and she showed Roxy a document that she'd had drawn up.\n\n\nThe document stated that Rex had agreed to return everything to Clint. Echo thought she might be able to find a way of not letting Rex be aware that she and Roxy believed he might be guilty of murder.\n\n\nRoxy walked over to the bar for a drink, and the bartender informed her that someone had been arrested for Victor's murder. \"Oh, my God, was it Rex Balsom?\" she asked. \"No, Todd Manning,\" the bartender replied. Roxy was ecstatic, and she proclaimed that John always got the right guy.\n\n\nEcho pointed out that the police still didn't have the gun, and Rex might not be home free. She thought that they needed to \"play ball\" with Kim. Roxy prodded Echo for plans, but Echo was ready to return home. She announced that she would do what she had to in order to keep Rex out of jail.\n\n\nIrene was ushered into John's office, and she demanded that she be allowed to make some phone calls. John reminded her that she'd already had her one call, and he noted how touching Irene's grief was over the death of her son. She explained that she was grieving on the inside, but John assured her that it was really guilt for killing Victor.\n\n\nIrene was angry over John's accusation, and she advised him not to insinuate anything. He promised her that he wasn't insinuating anything, and he believed that she'd killed Victor. Irene noted that Todd had been arrested, but John informed her that it had been the mayor's call. Irene assumed that the mayor must have had sufficient evidence.\n\n\nJohn growled that he didn't care about the mayor. He was determined to find the real murderer. \"Don't look at me,\" Irene stated. \"I'm looking right at you,\" John replied. Irene pointed out that brother hated brother, and a similar story could be found in the Bible. Sarcastically, John snapped that he'd been to Sunday School, and there had also been an old story about a mother killing her son.\n\n\nIrene insisted that she had loved Victor, because he had been the son that she'd kept. Todd had been the one she'd given away. John reminded her that he'd been present when Victor had attempted to strangle Irene, and had to be pulled away from her. Irene called it a misunderstanding. John proclaimed how coincidental it had been that Victor had ended up dead after that, but Irene maintained that lots of people had wanted Victor dead.\n\n\nJohn declared that the list had included Irene, who had tried to kill Victor another time. Irene was impressed with John's detective skills. She reminded him that she'd been locked up when Victor had been killed, so she'd had the perfect alibi. John responded that she could have arranged the murder, but Irene suggested that he search for a suspect if he didn't believe it had been Todd.\n\n\nContinuing his sarcasm, John noted how shattered Irene's heart appeared to be. He ordered another cop to take Irene back to her cell. He had plenty of time to wait for the truth.\n\n\nDani visited Todd's cell. He apologized for staring, but he explained that he couldn't believe that she was really his daughter. \"I'm not here to bond,\" Dani assured him. \"Did you kill my father?\" she asked.\n\n\nA confused Dani began to explain that she knew that Victor hadn't been her father, but Todd stopped her. He understood that she'd thought of Victor as her dad, and he knew that she'd loved Victor. He would have never taken something that she loved, Todd assured her. He swore that he hadn't killed Victor.\n\n\nDani mentioned Jack's reciting of the murder details, and the fact that Jack had sworn it was true. She had known Jack longer than she'd known Todd, but Todd pointed out that Jack was lying because he hated Todd. \"He did what he had to do,\" Todd added. Todd wanted Dani to believe him when he said he was innocent, and he presumed that Dani had some doubts if she was there to ask Todd about it.\n\n\nTodd stressed that he understood Jack's actions, and he would never hold them against him, because Jack was his son. Everything could be blamed on Irene, Todd believed. \"She seems totally postal,\" Dani agreed. She'd never heard anyone talk about Irene.\n\n\nTodd went on to talk about Dani's relationship with Victor. Since she called Victor dad, Todd didn't expect Dani to accept Todd as a father. He was aware that it had taken her a long time to accept Victor, even though as it had turned out, Victor hadn't done the awful things that Dani had believed he'd done. It had been Todd who'd actually committed those.\n\n\nDani continued that she'd treated her father poorly. She began to talk about growing up thinking that Ross had been her father. He'd taught her how to do lots of things on the island, and she'd really wanted him to be her father. Todd noted how he hadn't gotten along with Ross and had left him and T\u00e9a on the island in order to go back to Blair. Todd was grateful to Ross for doing such a great job of raising Dani.\n\n\nTodd hoped that one day Dani would begin to accept him. Dani informed him that it was a \"long way off.\" Todd had a favor to ask Dani. He wanted her to help to prove his innocence. \"Convince your mother to help me,\" he pleaded.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was the best lawyer Todd knew, but Dani was certain that T\u00e9a would never agree to it. Todd insisted that he needed T\u00e9a to make sure that the right person paid for Victor's murder. Dani assured Todd that T\u00e9a already believed the right person had been arrested, though T\u00e9a was \"torn up\" over the situation. Todd insisted that someone was setting him up.\n\n\nRecalling Irene's threat, Todd advised Dani that he couldn't tell her who that person was, because it was dangerous. Again, he begged her to talk to T\u00e9a. He swore he would be able to prove his innocence.\n\n\n\"Oh, is that my granddaughter?\" Irene called out as she was led to her cell. She held out her hand to Dani. Todd shouted that Dani should leave right away. Irene continued sweetly. She couldn't wait to get to know Dani, but Todd promised that Irene would never get close to the girl. Irene was certain that she would, and so would Todd. If Todd would only give Irene what she wanted, he could be close to Dani and his entire family again.\n\n\nAggravated, Todd yelled that he had no idea what Irene wanted. \"Your freedom is in your hands, my son,\" Irene stated. \"Give me what I want, and I'll give you what you need to prove your innocence.\" She added that Todd could then be with his family.\n\n\nTomas carried a tray full of goodies up to T\u00e9a's room. He wanted to cheer her up, and he wanted her to eat something. T\u00e9a announced that Todd had been arrested for Victor's murder, but she was aware that Tomas had hated Victor. She grabbed a plateful of food and threw it at Tomas angrily.\n\n\nTomas explained that he'd wanted Victor out of T\u00e9a's life, but he hadn't killed him. T\u00e9a asked about his alibi the night of the murder, and Tomas confessed that he'd been to see an associate to find out how he could protect T\u00e9a and Dani from Victor. He reminded T\u00e9a that he'd saved Victor during the first murder attempt, and he would have never killed the man that T\u00e9a loved.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was furious that Tomas had missed Victor's funeral. Tomas explained that he'd had to take care of business involving Irene, but T\u00e9a thought that it could have waited. Tomas insisted that he was trying to make things up to T\u00e9a. She apologized for being angry with him, and she began to cry. She informed him that she'd seen Todd everywhere, and it made things confusing.\n\n\nTodd was at the police station, and T\u00e9a had \"gone off\" on him when he'd asked her to represent him, T\u00e9a revealed. \"I'll bet you did,\" Tomas chuckled. Todd had shown up at St. James on the day of the funeral, and then he'd called her to defend him, T\u00e9a continued. Tomas wondered whether T\u00e9a believed that Todd had committed murder.\n\n\nT\u00e9a admitted that she wasn't certain she believed Jack's story, especially since he'd changed it. She updated Tomas on the latest details. \"We all know Jack is a good liar,\" T\u00e9a declared. Tomas advised his sister that she was thinking like a lawyer. T\u00e9a thought it was better than thinking like a widow, but she missed Victor.\n\n\nDani arrived home. She admitted to T\u00e9a that she'd been to visit Todd, because she'd wanted to hear his story. She advised T\u00e9a that Todd had begged for T\u00e9a to represent him, because T\u00e9a was the only person who could save him.\n\n\nEcho saw Rex sitting at his desk when she returned home. She asked about his trip to Kentucky, and he told her it had been a \"bust.\" He stood up. He wanted to check on Shane, and he refused to listen to Echo talk. He advised her that he would not return anything to Clint. Echo looked at her document and at all of the papers that Rex had left out on his desk. She recalled forging the donor document with Gigi's signature, and she sat down at the desk. She began to practice Rex's signature.\n\n\nJohn walked into Rodi's and saw Roxy lying on the bar. She was trying to reach a bottle underneath. \"We talked about this, Roxy. No planking on the bar,\" he ordered. Roxy revealed that she'd heard the good news about Todd's arrest, but John admitted that it was only according to the mayor. He didn't want to talk about it.\n\n\n \"How about we talk about you and Natalie instead?\" Roxy suggested. Neither of them saw Natalie as she walked into the bar and listened.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John McBain questions Irene Manning. She points out that Todd is already under arrest for Victor's murder, and that she was in police custody at the time of the murder. John has not ruled out murder-for-hire on her order. Dani asks Todd if he killed Victor. He tells her he would never take someone she loved away from her. He says, since she asked, she must doubt Jack's eyewitness statement. He tells her not to correct herself when she calls Victor her dad. She tells him about her first dad, Ross Rayburn. Todd says he didn't know Tea was pregnant with her and that he is grateful that she had Ross in her life. He asks her to convince her mother to represent him. She says Tea thinks he killed Victor. He tells her that Tea will want to find out who really killed her husband. Irene asks Todd if he is ready to give her what she wants in exchange for the gun that will prove his innocence. Tomas tells Tea that at the time of Victor's murder, he was meeting with his associate about determining whether Irene still had control over Victor. He asks her if she is accusing him because she has doubts about Todd's guilt. Tea says she doesn't have much faith in Jack's \"eyewitness\" account because Jack is a liar. Tomas gives her a drawing that he did of Victor and Tea's wedding. Dani Tea that Todd said he is innocent and that Tea is the only person that can save him. Rex returns to Llanview and finds Natalie sitting in the dark in his living room. She tells him that Body proposed to her and she couldn't answer. Rex asks her if she loves Brody or if she is still in love with John. She admits that she is still in love with John, but John doesn't love her anymore. He reminds her that he married Adriana even though Gigi was the love of his life, and it didn't work out. Cutter waits outside of Stacy's hospital room. Kim admits that she is blackmailing Rex with the gun. Cutter is shocked to see Stacy in the bed. He lets Kim keep the gun and she asks him not to tell anyone about Stacy. He says nobody would believe him anyway. Echo tells Roxy that Kim has Rex's gun and intends to blackmail them. Echo shows Roxy a document that she had a lawyer draw up for Rex to return Clint's assets to him. Roxy knows Rex won't sign it. The bartender at Rodi's tells them that Todd Manning was arrested for Victor Lord Jr.'s murder. Echo says they still have to deal with Kim. Echo returns to Rex's house and forges his signature on the document. John won't talk to Roxy about the case, so she suggests they talk about Natalie.",
