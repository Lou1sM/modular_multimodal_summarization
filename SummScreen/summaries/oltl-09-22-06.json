    "tvmega_recap": "Spencer tells Blair that he really did love her the whole time and that she was the one who lied to him. Todd suddenly appears spewing how love means never having to say that you are sorry. \"Drop dead!\" Todd reminds the good doctor that he was dead once and that he was the healer who brought him back to life. Spencer knows that he has been made out to be the bad guy in all this but he knows that Todd is worse and that is why it was so easy for him to steal Blair away from him. John is holding on the wheel, trying to steer the car to safety. Suddenly, he is at the graveyard, standing over his father's grave. His father appears, knowing that John has caught the killer. John seems troubled and his father wonders if finally, after having spent most of his adult life chasing this killer, if John is finally at peace. He isn't sure. John feels something was missing. He wanted to be there for his father. He remembers the night at the ER. His father was pointing. John thought that it was he, his father was pointing at, but it was actually Truman who was part of the team there to save Thomas. David was there as well and he was panicky staring at the scene of Thomas slowly dying. \"Get that kid out of there!\" Spencer grabbed his brother and ordered him to go home! Natalie is home and she smiles as she thinks about the past and memories of she and John in the beginning. She remembers telling him how he treats her like no one else. Cristian is in trouble. The public believes that he took a dive. The replay the part of the fight where he falls and Abbot's glove doesn't even make contact with Cristian's face. Cristian tells the press that there was something on Abbot's glove but everyone just laughs at his desperate attempt to save himself. The commission is investigating and will be making a decision on all that has gone on, but after that, Cristian vows to figure out what happen. John has his memories and even thinks sees the kids that he could have one day with Natalie. His father tells that this is the way that it should be. \"You are going to propose aren't you?\" A car horn is heard in the distance and John has to go. He gets up and walks out of the graveyard. He is back in his care in an instant, still trying to guide it to safety. His life flashes before him, each a snapshot of a special time then CRASH! Everything is broken and nothing moves.",
