    "soap_central": "\n\n\"I miss Tess,\" Ford declared solemnly. \"I miss Dani,\" Nate said soberly. \"I miss Starr,\" James chimed in. \"Seriously?\" Nate asked. \"What? It's been like a whole...hour,\" James proclaimed as his brothers stared at him. The brothers were lounging in the steam room at Serenity Springs. After James's proclamation, his brothers did their best to set things straight. They teased and wrestled with him mercilessly.\n\n\nJames announced that he was trying to relate to the others, but his brothers didn't want to hear it. \"Have some respect. You have a relationship,\" Ford said. \"We don't,\" Nate added. James understood, and he was aware that he was lucky. Ford made it clear that he didn't want to hear about James and Starr frolicking in an orchard gathering strawberries. James leaned over and uttered that they had gathered apples. Ford slugged him, and James agreed that he'd keep his relationship to himself.\n\n\nJames turned to Nate instead. He'd thought that Nate and Dani were doing well. Nate revealed that he'd spoken to Dani, but she was involved in losing her father, and she didn't need Nate. \"Maybe she does,\" James suggested. Ford thought that was good advice. Nate recalled the recommendation he'd received from the \"weirdo\" at the diner, who had ordered him to visit with Dani.\n\n\nNate admitted that he had followed up, and Dani hadn't even told him to leave. She'd even \"sort of\" hugged him. James thought that Nate should work towards gaining Dani's forgiveness after Nate's part in the porn film. James also mentioned that Rick was in his life, having turned into a record producer. The brothers were shocked to hear about Rick's change in career, and they weren't happy to hear about his part in Starr's life.\n\n\nJames clarified that it had been Baz's fault that Rick was around. Ford declared that he wouldn't risk losing a girlfriend to someone like that, and he thought that James should step in. Ford noted that his situation was totally different from the others, because Tess didn't even exist except in Jessica's body. Things were okay with Jessica as long as he didn't mention Tess.\n\n\nFord wondered if James were happy that Tess was gone. James made it clear that he hadn't wanted Ford to be hurt. Ford thought it was time that he work on his relationship with Jessica instead. \"If she'll let me,\" Ford said.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair received a phone call from Viki and learned that Todd had been arrested for Victor's murder. She turned to Starr to break the news, but the young woman had already heard thanks to \"my sweet little brother.\" Jack wandered into the kitchen, and Starr began to taunt him. She pondered why he was suddenly so quiet when he'd obviously had lots to say at the police station.\n\n\n\"Dad is back in jail thanks to you,\" she snapped. Jack noted that killers were supposed to be locked up, and his statement started an argument. \"What about liars?\" Starr inquired. If that were the case, then their mother would be visiting Jack in jail, too, Starr asserted. Jack called Starr a traitor, and the siblings continued to bicker. Jack claimed that his memory had returned, and he'd suddenly recalled the evening in question.\n\n\nStarr thought it was strange that Jack's memory had returned like it did. Blair asked Jack to tell her what he had told the police, and Jack reported the details from Sean's voicemail as he'd overheard them. After the shooting, he'd lost consciousness, he added. Starr pointed out that he wasn't really an eyewitness if he'd passed out, but Jack announced that it had obviously been enough for the police.\n\n\nStarr was certain that her brother was lying. Jack challenged her to go to the police to say something, but she remained quiet. \"Your dad killed mine,\" Jack retorted. Starr asked Jack to think about being away from his family for eight years. Their father had missed a lot. \"So?\" Jack asked. Starr explained that they had given their father the strength to go on whenever he'd thought about them.\n\n\nStarr begged Jack to change his story, and she asked Blair to make Jack admit that he was lying. Blair spoke up. \"I don't think he is,\" Blair said. Starr was shocked. She wondered which person had the head injury, and she pointed out how many times Jack had lied in the past. Blair explained that there was a life at risk, and her son would never lie about that.\n\n\nStarr reminded her that Jack had already taken someone's life when Gigi had died. She and Jack began to argue again, and Blair ordered Jack to go to bed. After Jack was gone, Starr started up with her mother. \"What are you doing? Everything he says, you're going to believe it?\" Starr asked. \"Who says I believe it?\" Blair retorted, clarifying, \"I said what I had to say.\"\n\n\nBlair began to talk about Jack. He'd changed since he was a young boy, and maybe she'd been a bad mother. She had always wanted to make certain that her children were good people, but she was afraid she'd lost Jack. She'd allowed Jack to associate with Victor, and Jack was struggling to figure out who he was. Blair had to gain his trust.\n\n\nBlair thought that her little boy still lingered inside of Jack. He had seemed to want to open up previously, and she'd thought that something was bothering him. Starr worried that it would take some time. \"So where does that leave dad?\" Starr asked. Starr refused to see her father sacrificed.\n\n\nJust then, Jack ushered James inside. James and Starr stepped outside. James wondered if she were doing okay. Starr advised him that she wasn't. Inside, Jack thanked his mother for believing him, and they shared a hug. He smirked behind his mother's back.\n\n\nDani tried to persuade T\u00e9a to represent Todd, but T\u00e9a wanted no part of it. T\u00e9a believed that Todd had been using Dani, because that was his usual method. Dani was concerned, and she wondered if that meant that Todd didn't really care about her. T\u00e9a started to say that Todd would summon someone to see him and work his magic, but Dani broke in quickly. She had gone to visit Todd on her own.\n\n\nT\u00e9a declared that Todd had been aware that Dani would show up, and he was really only out for himself. Dani argued that she would never get to know Todd the way that T\u00e9a did, especially if he remained behind bars. T\u00e9a thought that her daughter was better off not knowing Todd, but Dani reminded her mother that she'd said the same thing about Victor.\n\n\nThey had still loved Victor, and he'd loved them, Dani told her mother. T\u00e9a said that things had been different with Todd, and he'd treated her horribly. Dani pointed out that T\u00e9a had married Victor under the premise that he'd been Todd. T\u00e9a was adamant. She wouldn't defend Todd if he had killed her husband. \"But what if he didn't?\" Dani asked.\n\n\nT\u00e9a insisted that it was good enough for her if the police had believed that Todd was the right person to arrest. Dani pronounced that it had been because of Jack, the same person who had said he hadn't done anything to Shane. Jack believed that he was doing Victor a favor, Dani said.\n\n\nTodd had revealed that he believed he'd been set up. He wouldn't tell Dani anything, but Dani was certain that he would probably confess all to T\u00e9a if she would defend him. Todd trusted T\u00e9a with his life, Dani added. She begged T\u00e9a to reconsider. T\u00e9a considered Todd to be a \"master at self-justification.\" He would be guilty of something, but cry that it wasn't his fault due to his childhood. T\u00e9a was adamant that Todd not get a free pass.\n\n\nDani maintained that Todd had never said anything about his childhood during their conversation. T\u00e9a tried a different tack. Perhaps Todd had just believed that Dani was vulnerable. \"I feel it,\" Dani emphasized. She couldn't explain it. She didn't think that Todd was the killer, and she was grieving. \"Mom, he needs you,\" Dani pleaded.\n\n\nThe women were interrupted when Dani received a phone call. T\u00e9a agreed to think about Todd's request in order to appease Dani. Nate was on the phone, and he wondered how Dani was doing. He offered to talk with her if she needed someone. Dani advised him that she was tired and wanted to go to bed. \"Maybe tomorrow,\" she added. She thanked him for calling. Nate was cheered up.\n\n\nLater, Dani walked into her mother's bedroom as T\u00e9a lay in bed. Dani announced that she didn't want to be alone, and she climbed into bed with her mother.\n\n\nBrody put Liam to bed, and he told his infant son how happy he was that the family was together. Brody was waiting to get Natalie's answer to his marriage proposal. He was surprised to find Jessica when he answered a knock on the door. She held out one of his war medals. She'd had it for a while, but she wanted to return it. He suggested she keep it.\n\n\nJessica assured him that the medal no longer held the same meaning for her that it once had. She turned to go. \"Wait, Jessica. Please don't go,\" Brody called out. He exclaimed that he didn't like the way things were between them. Jessica agreed, but she admitted that she saw no way for things to change. Brody thought that they could try.\n\n\nJessica thought it was about time she focused on her children instead. Brody wondered if she was comfortable with the tension and anger that described the state of their relationship. Jessica replied that she couldn't help it, but every time she saw Brody, she envisioned him in bed with Natalie.\n\n\nJessica was aware that it was partially her fault, and Brody wondered if she could forgive them. Jessica felt that it didn't matter. Brody informed her that he'd proposed to Natalie and was waiting for her answer. Jessica was astonished. She assumed that Natalie was unsure if she hadn't given Brody an answer. Brody acknowledged that Natalie had a lot to consider, including Jessica's feelings.\n\n\nJessica disagreed. Natalie had never considered Jessica's feelings, so her delay probably had to do with thoughts of John.\n\n\n\"Don't give me those snake eyes,\" Roxy ordered John as he looked at her silently. They were at Rodi's, and Roxy was trying to get John to admit his true feelings for Natalie. John insisted that there was nothing going on. Roxy demanded that he admit the truth to her or he would have to admit that he had no life. Natalie had just walked into the bar, and she remained hidden, in order to listen.\n\n\nRoxy continued to demand that John answer her, as he tried to get the liquor away from her. He advised her that it didn't matter what he felt, but Roxy described how he and Natalie went together like many things, including peanut butter and jelly. She wanted to get the couple back together. John admitted that he was confused. He was aware that Roxy had already given her blessing to Brody and Natalie.\n\n\n\"There are blessings and then there are blessings,\" Roxy stated. She informed him that Natalie and Brody weren't really happy. John reminded her that Natalie had stated that she was happy, but Roxy indicated that her daughter was a good actress. Roxy thought that John was a good actor, as well, because he and Natalie were pretending that everything was okay.\n\n\nJohn reminded her that the couple had moved in together. Roxy had an answer for that. She proclaimed that things had blown up between Jessica and Brody prior to the same thing happening between John and Natalie. Brody and Natalie had ended up together because of that and their child, but Natalie would be better off with John.\n\n\nJohn assured her that he and Natalie had talked about it, and they were both \"in a good place.\" Roxy began to yell at him. Natalie had only said that because she'd thought she had no chance with John. Roxy was warning John that he had to make his move before Natalie and Brody ended up married.\n\n\n\"There's Dolly Parton,\" John shouted. Roxy turned her head, and John finally managed to clean up Roxy's drink. He wanted to close up. He realized that Roxy's heart was in the right place. Roxy accused him of being afraid to reveal his feelings, but John wondered why he should. He pointed out that Gary Cooper had never revealed his feelings.\n\n\nRoxy insisted that if John were to tell her the truth about his feelings for Natalie, she would leave. She would \"honor the request of a dying man.\" She ordered him to look into her eyes and tell her that he didn't love Natalie any longer. After Roxy repeated it several times, John looked at her. \"I do not love Natalie anymore,\" John said. Natalie turned and fled the bar.\n\n\nRoxy called John's declaration \"a giant load of crap.\" She asked for a calendar in order to mark down the date that John had given up. She accused him of being scared. She continued to provoke him, until John gave in. He lost his temper and shouted, \"Fine. I admit it. I still love her.\"\n\n\nRoxy apologized for her behavior, but she'd had to do it. John replied that it was a dead end, and he wanted to be left alone. He advised her that his confession didn't change anything. \"It can. You tell her what you just told me before it's too late,\" Roxy ordered as she finally left Rodi's.\n\n\nFord found Jessica standing in the corridor by his apartment when he got home. She admitted that she wasn't okay, but then she changed her mind and turned to go. It had been a bad idea to visit Ford, Jessica confessed. He urged her to talk, and she admitted that she'd heard about Brody's marriage proposal to Natalie. She'd had time to get used to the couple, but it still bothered her.\n\n\nFord pointed out that Jessica and Brody had loved one another and had made promises to each other. He was sorry for her. Jessica was the one who was sorry. She'd broken the rules. She was aware that they were only supposed to see each other during visitation switches with Ryder. Ford advised her that she could talk to him until she found someone else to take over. \"Just call me your last resort,\" Ford said. Jessica smiled.\n\n\nNatalie arrived home and found Brody sitting quietly. He showed her the medal that Jessica had returned to him. He asked where Natalie had been and if she'd been alone. Natalie confessed that she'd gone out for a drink in order to consider Brody's proposal. \"Did you come to any decisions?\" he asked. Natalie revealed that she had. She would marry him. Her answer was yes.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie admits to having second thoughts about marrying Brody. Jessica finds out he's proposed and her sister said no and tells him she knows the sole reason for that is because Natalie is not over John and not because she could care less about what she's done to Jessica by taking her sister's fianc\u00e9 from her. Jessica wants to be able to not care that her ex fianc\u00e9 proposed to her sister but realizes she is upset. She goes to see Robert Ford who has admitted to his brothers that he misses Tess. He's happy to see her and she-him. But Jessica is not over Brody and Natalie is not over John either. Blair tells Starr that although she does not believe that Jack saw original Todd kill his dad, she has to \"back\" her son because she's afraid if she turns against him, he will shut down and she will lose the boy who once had a conscience. Dani convinces a furious and non responsive Tea to represent original Todd because she believes that he did not kill her father.",
