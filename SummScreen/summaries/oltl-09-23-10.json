The dean asked if she should blame Langston. Ford told her that he was a human, and he'd made a mistake. If she hired him back, he would be an inspiration to the students. \"By inviting them to your bedroom?\" she asked. She told him that her decision stood.\n\n\nGigi arrived early to Cristian's art class. She expressed her fears about college to Cristian, but he told her to stop worrying. Other students began to enter and one of them recognized Gigi as a waitress at Rodi's, to Gigi's discomfort. The students began to intelligently talk art, only adding to Gigi's discomfort. Cristian told everyone to sit at an easel and he asked everyone why they were there. After listening to two advanced students talking smugly, Gigi said that she was there because someone she cared about believed in her.\n\n\nCristian set up a table of objects in the middle of the room and gave everyone time to draw. When time was up, Cris asked everyone to explain why they'd drawn what they did. One of the smug students explained that his was aesthetic, but Cris told him that if he wanted that, he could have taken a picture. Gigi explained that hers was about how the past \"gets pushed in the background but still lingers,\" and Cris praised her. After class, Gigi thanked Cris again for the encouragement because she was starting to see the possibilities ahead of her.\n\n\nAt the gym, James and Nate worked out together. James told him that he was meeting Ford, implying that Nate should leave. However, Nate informed James that he'd had a breakthrough with Ford. They had started to bond over film. James told Nate about Ford's job. Later, Inez called Nate, wondering where he was. He said that he was at the gym with James, which shocked her. He said he'd be home soon and hung up.\n\n\nWhen Nate got off the phone, James updated him about what had happened with him and Inez. He felt bad about telling her that she wasn't his mom, but Nate understood. He told James that \"families are inherited but relationships aren't.\"\n\n\nBrody was working out when Jess entered. He had just asked how her yoga class had been when the yoga instructor entered. The instructor addressed Brody as the father of Jess's baby and said she'd see Jess at the next class. Jess apologized and asked Brody if he wanted to join her for coffee. He said he was about to start with the punching bag, but he'd see her later. Jess left and Brody prepared to use the punching bag. Ford entered and asked if he should get gloves so the two could duke it out again.\n\n\nBrody told Ford that it was over. Brody and Jess were getting married and having a baby, which would be Brody's. He told Ford not to cause any problems. Ford related that he had plenty of problems of his own. The yoga instructor walked by and said that she hoped the baby got Brody's muscles. Ford continued and said that the last thing he needed was a kid, especially being unemployed.\n\n\nBrody punched the bag with fury, hearing himself, Jess, Ford, and the yoga instructor talking about the baby. Cris entered and asked Brody if he was all right. Cris asked who Brody was trying to kill, and Brody looked at Ford. Cris related that he didn't care much for Ford and asked Brody if he was done with the punching bag. \"Layla is three thousand miles away so I have some frustrations of my own,\" he explained. Brody said he'd had enough and left.\n\n\nAfter his workout, Cris got a text message from Layla that said \"Oh, baby, I miss you too! XOXO.\"\n\n\nFord found James and began to work out. James asked Ford if he knew who had gone to the dean. \"No idea,\" Ford replied.\n\n\nLangston and a disguised Dorian entered the coffeeshop after a full day of shopping. Dorian asked Langston how school was going. Langston said that Ford was supposed to be one of her professors, but that he'd gotten fired because of her. Langston told Dorian about everything that had happened with her and Ford, and Ford and Jess. Dorian got up and hugged Langston, telling her how proud she was.\n\n\nLangston felt bad, but Dorian said that Ford had gotten what he deserved. She related that she would have tried to get David fired if he'd had a job. Langston thought she'd gone too far because of the consequences for James, but Dorian didn't think Langston had gone far enough. She assured her daughter that Ford had brought it all upon himself, and that Langston should just concentrate on herself. Anyone who got in the way of that would just be collateral damage.\n\n\nDorian told Langston she'd be right back and ran out of the coffeeshop. Jess entered and said hello to Langston. After a moment of discomfort, they both related that what Ford had done to them was low. However, Jess thought that Brody was hurting the most. She showed Langston her ring and assured her that everything was fine between them.\n\n\nDorian returned and congratulated Jess. Jess thanked Dorian and said goodbye. Dorian gave Langston a gift bag. Langston opened it and took out a necklace. She recognized it from seeing Blair and Kelly wearing necklaces just like it. Dorian said it was a family tradition, and that Langston was a true Cramer woman. Dorian put the necklace on Langston and told her to always remember who she was.\n\n\nBrody entered the coffeeshop and found Jess. She asked why he'd left the gym so early, and he replied that it was too crowded.\n\n\nClint told Rex that it would be unwise for Rex to share what he had found. Rex wondered if Clint had something to do with David being in jail in Morocco. Rex reasoned that Clint could be getting back at David for what David had done to Kim, and getting back at Dorian for trying to take over Buchanan Enterprises. Clint said that he had only told the Moroccan authorities where to find David, since David was a criminal in Morocco.\n\n\nRex thought that Bo should know what had happened to his son, but Clint said that Rex wasn't going to tell Bo anything. Clint said it would humiliate the commissioner to know that his son was a criminal, and also to arrest Rex for burglary. He wondered how Bo would feel to learn that Rex had tried to get Matthew to cover for him. He could also file charges against Kelly. As Rex tried to defend Kelly, Clint said that \"there's also Gigi to worry about.\"\n\n\nClint explained to a confused Rex that their relationship couldn't possibly last if he was in jail. Rex decided that he'd take his chances with Bo, but Clint decided to make him \"an offer you can't refuse.\" Clint knew that Ultraviolet wasn't doing very well, and that Rex had expenses. He offered to double what Kelly was paying him. Rex told Clint about Gigi's grant, and said he didn't need Clint's money. Clint said it would be a shame if the grant fell through because that kind of thing happened all the time.\n\n\nRex said he needed some air, but Clint told him to sleep on it. Clint knew that Rex would do what was best for everyone. After Rex left, Clint made a phone call to the dean of Llanview University.  He needed to call in a favor.\n\n\nNora entered Rodi's to find Bo and Inez laughing and wondered what was so funny. They tried to explain that they were laughing about the way Clint dealt with his problems -- with a shotgun. \"That's funny?\" Nora asked. Feeling awkward, Inez got up to freshen up. Nora thought Bo had been trashing his brother, but he insisted that he was trying to give Inez some insight about Clint. He was trying to encourage her, but knew that she could form her own opinion. Nora thought they would make a cute couple.\n\n\nBo asked about court, and Nora told him about what had happened with Hannah. She thought that it was the right decision for Hannah to be in Marty's custody. The two figured out that they both had the night free, right when Inez returned. She had to go, but appreciated Bo's talk about Clint.\n\n\nWhen Inez was outside of Rodi's, her phone rang. She answered it to Clint. He told her that he had a hunch things would work out for James.\n\n\nGigi returned to Rodi's and put on her apron, telling it that its days were numbered. Rex entered and asked how her day had been. She'd loved it, and she thought that her life could really change. It helped that Cris was a great teacher. Just then, Gigi's phone rang. Rex took the opportunity to tell Bo that they needed to talk. Before Rex could say anything, he noticed Gigi's face fall. She told him that there was some kind of technical issue, and her grant had been rescinded. She wondered how she would pay for school. Bo asked Rex what he wanted to talk about, but Rex said it wasn't important as he comforted his girlfriend.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Clint catches Rex in his office and realizes that he knows that Clint sent David away and has the goods to get Clint in legal trouble, Clint warns him he might not want to do that. He tells Rex he knows that he and Gigi are not rich. She is going to school and dependent on a grant and Shane needs medical care for his asthma. Right then, Gigi attends Cristian Vega's art class and for the first time, she is encouraged to pursue her dream. Clint tells Rex that there are ways for Gigi to lose her grant money. He then calls in a favor to the LU Dean. And it looks like he's going to pull strings for James to get the grant that was previously Gigi's. He wants to impress Inez. Clint tells Rex that he can double whatever Kelly is paying him. If Rex accepts that offer and forgets what he knows about Clint running David out of town to be put in a Morocco prison, he can double the amount of money Kelly has paid Rex to investigate what Clint has done. Clint reminds Rex that he can enable him and Gigi and Shane to have all they want and need. Meanwhile, Brody is having issues knowing that Robert could be the father of Jessica's baby. Langston informs Dorian that she got Robert fired after finding out that he slept with Jessica and may have gotten her pregnant, prom night when Jessica was in a fragile state believing that she was still in high school. Dorian now knows something that may be of interest to her.",
