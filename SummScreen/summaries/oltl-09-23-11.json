Bo then found John, who took a sip from a pitcher of water.  Bo requested John's presence at work but also asked that John wait until he was no longer drunk.  John explained that he had just been through a rough night, and Bo reflected that the last time John had tied one on had been after John and Natalie's non-wedding.\n\n\nJohn expressed surprise that Bo wanted John to share his feelings and stated that he had not seen Natalie.  However, John acknowledged that he had talked to Roxy, who had gotten under his skin by insisting that John still loved Natalie.  John claimed that he had only admitted that he loved Natalie to shut Roxy up.  Bo realized that John still loved Natalie and insisted that John tell her.  John refused because he felt that Natalie had a family with Brody and Liam.\n\n\nBo then announced that the police department would have to cut Irene Manning loose.  John was not too surprised, since he knew that Irene had friends in Washington.  When Bo indicated that the federal government was sending someone to ensure Irene's release, John joked that \"the Feds\" believed that Bo and John needed help unlocking the cell door.\n\n\nAt Natalie's apartment, Natalie got out of bed and shuffled through the mail on the desk.  She found an envelope containing the paternity test results and opened it.  Once Natalie read that John McBain was the DNA match for Liam, Natalie woke up and found she was in bed with Brody.  The motion woke up Brody, who declared that he had a surprise for Natalie.\n\n\nBrody showed Natalie a ring, and Natalie exclaimed that she loved it.  Natalie squealed that it looked like he had spent a fortune on it.  As she put it on her finger, Natalie frowned and stated that she could picture Jessica seeing it.  Natalie insisted that she wanted to do what was right for Jessica and for them.\n\n\nBrody returned to the bedroom and announced that Liam was still asleep.  Brody claimed that he would play with Liam, after the child woke up.  Natalie exclaimed that Brody was the best daddy ever.  Brody then insisted that he wanted to call Clint to make their engagement official.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica lay on the sofa, and Brody woke her up and told her to get ready for their wedding.  As Jessica and Brody kissed, Jessica woke up and found Clint standing over her.  After Jessica worried over Clint, because he was on his feet, Clint expressed that he was just getting some exercise.  When Clint commented that he had heard Jessica up several times during the night, Jessica said that Bree had suffered with a fever, but that she would be fine.\n\n\nClint begged Jessica not to wear herself out and thought that she had been having nightmares.  However, Jessica explained that she had actually had a nice dream, and that reality was the nightmare.  Jessica told Clint about her dream, where Brody had worried about seeing her in her wedding dress.  Jessica joked that if the dream had continued, she would have discovered that Brody had proposed to Natalie.  Jessica then sadly revealed that Brody had actually proposed to Natalie, but that Natalie had not yet given him an answer.\n\n\nClint believed that Natalie had hesitated on making a decision to Brody's proposal, because of her concern for Jessica's feelings.  However, Jessica revealed that Natalie had not made a decision, because of her feelings for John McBain.  Clint related to Jessica that he had made Natalie promise him on his deathbed that she would try to resolve things with John.  Clint's phone rang.\n\n\nClint discovered that it was Brody on the phone and remarked that even though Brody had once been engaged to Jessica, he had proposed to her twin sister.  Clint growled, \"Is that supposed to make us feel warm inside?\"  When Brody asked for Clint's blessing, Clint wondered what would happen if he refused to give it.  After Brody stated that he and Natalie would get married anyway, Clint yelled that they were done and hung up the phone.\n\n\nJessica applauded and cried out that was awesome.  Clint, however, revealed that Natalie had given her answer to Brody, and the answer was yes.  As Clint hugged Jessica, she stated that she had really believed that Natalie would say no, because of John.  Jessica then heard Ryder cry on the baby monitor, and Clint offered to make them blueberry pancakes.  Clint, however, refused to reveal his secret blueberry pancakes recipe to Jessica.\n\n\nBack at their apartment, Brody told Natalie that her father loved her, but that it would take some time for Clint to accept their engagement.  Natalie was proud that Brody had stood up to Clint.  Natalie acknowledged that she had been the bad guy in the past, and that she was pretty good at it, but Brody insisted that she could still back out of the engagement.\n\n\nNatalie stressed that she would not let anyone tell her who she could be with.  Natalie exclaimed that she wanted to be with Brody, as she put her ring back on.  Natalie and Brody hugged and climbed back into bed.  Later, Brody carried Liam into the room and handed him to his mother.  When Natalie stated that she had to leave, Brody took Liam from her arms.  After Natalie left, Brody informed the child that Liam would be his boy, and that no one could take that away from him.  \"All that trouble died with Victor Lord,\" Brody said.\n\n\n Back at Rodi's, Natalie walked in and found John sweeping up a broken beer bottle.  Natalie said to John, \"I have something...uh, I have something I need to tell you,\" and John replied, \"I have something to tell you too.\"  Natalie remarked, \"Okay, why don't you go first this time?\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a woke up in her bed, and as she reached for the man next to her, she cried out, \"Todd...Victor.\"  When the man turned over, she was stunned to see that it was Todd.  T\u00e9a snapped awake in an empty bed.  Blair knocked on T\u00e9a's bedroom door and realized that T\u00e9a had forgotten that Victor was dead.  When Blair requested that T\u00e9a get up, T\u00e9a insisted that it would only get worse, because not only was Victor dead, but Todd wanted her to prove he had not killed Victor.\n\n\nT\u00e9a informed Blair that Todd claimed that he was innocent, and that T\u00e9a was the only lawyer who could get Todd cleared of the charges.  Blair explained that it was because T\u00e9a was a shark.  T\u00e9a was unsure if Todd had killed Victor, because Jack had been known to lie.  Blair agreed and added that she had her own reasons to suspect Jack's story.  Blair feared that Jack would believe that it was okay to lie to the cops, and T\u00e9a acknowledged that he might if the ends justified the means.\n\n\nBlair insisted that she would defend Jack and just hope that Jack could find his conscience on his own.  Blair revealed that she had an idea of how to uncover Jack's conscience.  Blair then placed a box from the Sun onto T\u00e9a's bed.  Blair carried out a dress for T\u00e9a to wear and told T\u00e9a to call if she needed anything.  Blair left the room.\n\n\nT\u00e9a opened the box and discovered a family photo of herself, Victor, and Dani.  As T\u00e9a picked up her billfold, she remembered when Todd had offered her five million dollars to represent him and then asked her to take his case for their daughter's sake.  T\u00e9a lay back down in the bed.  Later, all of the contents of the box were spread out on the messed-up covers of T\u00e9a's bed.  On top of the pile was Liam's paternity test results that announced that John McBain was Liam's DNA match.\n\n\nAt the Llanview jail, Jack apologized to Todd about lying to the cops.  Jack then called Todd \"Dad.\"  Todd suddenly woke up in his prison cell.  When Irene asked if Todd had slept well, Todd growled back at her.  Irene replied that it was a bad greeting to give the person who could set him free, and Todd asked if Oprah was there and laughed.\n\n\nTodd requested that Irene return the gun that she had stashed, and that he had never fired.  Todd added, \"And I am sure that you will give it back, as soon as I dig up whatever it is that you think that I have, even though I don't have it, and I don't know where it is, and I have no idea how to find it.\"  Irene believed that Todd was playing with her.\n\n\nTodd reminded Irene that he had been tortured for eight years, and that he would have told her then if he had known.  When Irene maintained that it was deep inside of Todd, he asked Irene to draw him a map or diagram, or maybe she could phone it in, or he could ask the audience.  Todd pleaded with Irene to just tell him.\n\n\nIrene remembered that she had been angry when she had discovered that Todd's father had left Todd 28 million dollars, which could have helped her and Victor.  When Todd asked Irene again about the thing she was looking for, Irene cautioned, \"Patience.\"  Irene reflected back to when she had first sent her agents to recruit Todd, and Todd quipped that Irene had felt that Todd could use his media empire to serve his country.  Irene said if only Todd had been sincere, and Todd responded if only he had known that her agents were evil.\n\n\nIrene claimed that Todd had taken a little insurance with him -- a microchip that contained information that could wreak havoc on the agency.  Irene revealed that was when she had known that Victor had needed to replace Todd, and that they had to utilize Todd's mind to program Victor.  Irene explained that they had tried to persuade Todd to surrender the microchip.\n\n\nTodd still denied knowing anything about the microchip, and Irene offered her techniques for Todd to recover his memory.  When Todd turned her down, Irene held out Todd's freedom to him.  Irene pointed out that Todd would spend the rest of his life behind bars if he did not work with her.\n\n\nBo and a federal agent entered the jail and released Irene.  Todd was shocked, and Irene told Todd that it had been a pleasure.  Bo threatened that if Irene did anything remotely illegal in Llanview, or did anything to make Viki's life harder, Irene would pay, and that she would have no more free passes.  Irene pondered that Victoria had always been able to inspire such intense loyalty in her friends, and that she could get so much help, whenever she needed it.  Irene voiced, \"That must be a wonderful feeling.\"\n\n\nAs the federal agent walked Irene out, she told Todd that they would be in touch.  Todd yelled to Bo, \"So, that's it, huh?  You just...you just let Irene walk,\" and Bo replied, \"I hate this as much as you do.\"  When Todd stressed, \"She's a danger to everyone in this town,\" Bo yelled, \"I don't owe you any answers, Manning.\"\n\n\nTodd smirked and declared, \"This is just ducky.  She gets government-issued, get-out-of-jail-free cards, and I can't get competent representation.  I can't even post bail.  Aren't these things my rights?\"  A police officer walked in and announced, \"Commissioner...uh, Manning has a visitor.\"  When T\u00e9a walked in, Todd grinned from ear to ear.\n\n\nJack tapped his pencil on his schoolwork, and when he looked up, he saw that his teacher was Gigi.  His teacher remarked, \"You know the answer, don't you?  I heard you know all about carbon monoxide.\"  When Jack woke up in class, Shane observed that it looked like Jack had seen a ghost.\n\n\nTwo of Jack's classmates asked if Jack's dad had really killed Victor, and Jack refused to acknowledge Todd as his dad.  Jack replied that Todd had killed his dad, and that it had been the worst day of his life, as Shane glared at Jack.  When Jack demanded to know what Shane was looking at, Shane denied that he was looking at Jack.  Jack slammed his books shut and ran out of the classroom.  Jack ran into Blair in the hall.\n\n\nBlair told Jack that she had feared that it was too soon for Jack to have returned to school, and Jack asked, \"After what Todd did to my dad?\"  When Blair stated that she understood, Jack replied, \"You do?  So, you believe me?  You know it was Todd too?\"  Blair answered, \"Well, Jack, of course I do, because you said you saw him.  I believe you.\"\n\n\nShane listened at the door and remembered that he had hit Jack over the head with a gun, and that he had seen Jack lying still on the ground.  Shane walked back to his desk and looked at a picture that he had drawn of himself standing with a gun in hand over Jack's body.  Shane closed his notebook and put his head in his hand. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Many people are having dreams. John envisions telling Natalie that he is in love with her but awakens on the bar stool at Rodi's realizing he drank himself to sleep without reaching out to Natalie. Jessica envisions getting back with Brody and having him propose to her, but she awakens to the cold reality that she and Brody are through and he's proposed to her sister. Jack Manning is in the classroom having a dream that his new teacher is Gigi who grills him in front of everyone to admit that he knows all about carbon monoxide poisoning which killed her. Shane sits across from Jack staring at him and revealing he has a secret. Blair informs Starr and then Tea that she believes the only way not to \"lose\" Jack and salvage any hope of her son developing a conscience is to \"back\" him and believe that he's told the truth about seeing original Todd kill Victor although she knows he's lying.",
