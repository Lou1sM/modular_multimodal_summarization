    "soap_central": "\nThe Only Easy Day Was Yesterday:\n\n\nIn the school gym, Markko and Cole were shooting hoops while they discussed the things that were bothering them. Markko was worried about Langston. He'd been trying to reach her on her cell phone, to no avail. Cole, meanwhile, was concerned about the long-term ramifications of Starr's decision. Cole didn't think he could look at Starr without remembering that she gave their child up for adoption. \n\n\nIn another part of the school, Blair arrived as Starr and the school's principal were arguing about Starr's future. Blair was furious when she learned that the principal wanted Starr to be home-schooled for the duration of her pregnancy. The principal justified her recommendation by declaring that Starr's presence in school was disruptive. Starr was outraged by the accusation. Starr explained to Blair that she had been forced to defend herself when a fellow classmate had ridiculed her. \n\n\nBlair threatened to use all of her considerable resources to bring the school's discriminatory attitude to the public's attention. Starr also received surprising support from Cole and Markko. They had overheard the argument between the principal and Blair, and threatened to walk out of the school if the principal forced Starr out. Duly pressured, the principal backed down and let the matter drop. A frantic phone call from Langston interrupted their celebration. \n\n\nDorian, Langston, and Ray were gathered at court to petition a judge for custody of Langston. Dorian had hoped that her private detective's report about Ray's criminal past would have an impact on the judge's decision, but it didn't. Ray's attorney argued that Ray had been released and the charges had been dismissed against his client. \n\n\nThe judge gave Ray and Dorian an opportunity to plead their cases. Ray played the family card and argued that his biological connection to Langston was important to his niece's upbringing. Dorian pointed out that Ray had been estranged from Langston's mother for 20 years and that Dorian's home was where Langston belonged. Before the judge went to deliberate the case, Langston asked for an opportunity to address the court. She told the judge that she appreciated Ray's desire to be a part of her life, but she wanted to live with Dorian. \n\n\nThe judge promised to consider Langston's request then adjourned to his chambers. A short time later, the judge returned with his decision. Blair, Starr, Markko, and Cole arrived just moments before the judge spoke. Once they were seated, the judge rendered his decision. He said that whenever it was possible, he tried to keep families together. For that reason, the judge granted custody of Langston to her uncle, Ray. \n\n\nBo was at the Palace Hotel, waiting for Clint, when Dallas approached him. While they were chatting, Clint walked up. Dallas quickly excused herself so the brothers could speak privately. Once they were alone, Bo asked Clint about his plans to coerce Dorian into signing over the company. Clint was evasive, but assured his brother that he didn't intend to do anything illegal. Bo had to leave when Rex called with an urgent request for help. \n\n\nAfter Bo left, Dallas sent a waiter to Clint's table with a drink, compliments of her. Clint was impressed by her choice and joined Dallas at her table. She asked Clint how things were with Nora and lent a sympathetic ear as Clint told her that he and Nora had agreed to disagree. Dallas continued to cozy up to Clint. She assured him that she was one of those 'gals' who got it; sometimes you had to dirty your hands in order to clean up a mess. Clint seemed to appreciate Dallas' support. \n\n\nDallas was momentarily called away when the hotel manager asked to speak with her. When Dallas returned to the table, she told Clint that she had been asked to leave the hotel. A pipe had burst and, unfortunately, the hotel was completely booked so they couldn't accommodate the inconvenienced guests. When Dallas suggested calling the Angel Square Hotel to see if they had an available room, Clint invited her to stay at the Buchanan Mansion. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Charlie ended a business call just as Michael walked into the lobby. Charlie took the opportunity to tell Michael how sorry he had been to hear that the McBains had split up. Michael appreciated Charlie's concern but made it clear that a reunion with Marcie would not happen. Charlie was disappointed to hear Michael talk that way about his marriage. He told Michael that he had once felt that way about his relationship with Viki, but had decided to pursue her when she returned to town. Charlie loved Viki and was hopeful that they would work things out. \n\n\nMichael didn't share Charlie's optimism. He explained that Marcie's desire to adopt Todd's grandchild was something that Michael couldn't live with. The discussion came to an abrupt end when Marcie walked in. Michael immediately saw her injury and whisked her away to make sure that she was okay. Afterward, when Marcie walked away, Charlie told Michael that he could see that the young couple still loved each other deeply. \n\n\nAt Gigi's home, Gigi became distraught when she realized that Brody had a gun with him. Rex called the police. When Rex learned that Bo was not in his office, he reported Shane's abduction and then called Bo on his cell phone. Bo arrived minutes later and began questioning Marcie. Marcie told Bo about the events that lead up to her injury, which led Bo put out an APB on Brody. Within a short time, Bo learned that Brody had been spotted at the courthouse with Shane. Bo, Rex, and Gigi headed to the courthouse to question the security guard. He told them that Brody had left an hour before their arrival. \n\n\nAfter Brody refused to go through a metal detector, he and Shane were escorted out of the courthouse by a security guard. Shane was excited when Brody took him to a park and told him that they would be camping there for the night. To keep Shane from becoming suspicious, Brody pretended to call Gigi and leave her a voicemail message about camping with Shane. After Brody changed from his dress uniform into a set of fatigues, he rejoined Shane at their campsite. \n\n\nShane appeared to have his first inkling that something was wrong when he walked up to Brody to ask him what they would do next. As Brody stared intently off into space, he slowly pulled out a gun for Shane to see.\n\n\n",
