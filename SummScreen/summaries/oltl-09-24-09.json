He advised his father that everything in Charlie's past would be exposed. Charlie felt that he had nothing to hide and advised his son that everyone's skeletons would be made public during the campaign. Charlie felt himself aligned with Viki's belief that everyone deserved a \"second chance for positive change.\" \n\n\nCharlie and Jared reminisced when Charlie showed his son a picture of the two of them from the past. They remembered how they had always talked about what their future would be like. They marveled at how far they had come since that long ago day.\n\n\nT\u00e9a attempted to have a serious conversation with Todd but after some interruptions caused by wedding deliveries, they decided to head to Todd's place to be alone.\n\n\nNatalie visited the scene of the crime at Buchanan Enterprises and was startled when John appeared at the door. He advised her that his department had collected all of the evidence related to the attack on Jared and apologized for questioning Jared so soon after the attack. He explained that it was important to conduct the interview while things were still fresh in Jared's mind. John revealed that something had been found on the security tapes and he was going to view them.\n\n\nJohn placed the DVD on the computer and Natalie gasped as she and John witnessed the attacker jumping Jared from behind. As the men struggled, they were suddenly out of view and then the camera went off. John explained that the camera was in a spot hardly noticeable and that it would have been difficult for someone to have broken it. He figured that the perpetrator had to have known about the camera and that it would have been an inside job. As the attacker had not been seen entering or leaving the building, it would have been someone who had changed clothes after arriving, he summarized.\n\n\nNatalie was certain that Jared would have recognized his attacker if it had been someone employed at B.E. \"You would think,\" John replied. Going into attack mode, Natalie demanded to know what John was implying. He quickly assured her that he wasn't implying anything and was trying to look at the incident from many angles. He thought it was possible that someone held a grudge against Jared o,r perhaps it was someone from Jared's past, maybe someone he had done time with. Annoyed, Natalie accused John of thinking that Jared was a suspect and advised him that he needed to look for a real one.\n\n\nWhile John denied thinking that Jared was a suspect, the expression on his face told otherwise. In the meantime, Jared, newly arrived at B.E., overheard the conversation between his wife and her former boyfriend. \"So, you really think I'm stalking Natalie's sister?\" he wanted to know.\n\n\nJohn agreed that Jared had no motive and was the victim. Walking out, John stopped to ask Jared if he knew how the camera might have been broken. Jared assured him he had no idea. Once John was gone, Natalie worriedly told her husband that John was looking into Jared's background. She also believed that John suspected Jared of being involved in his own attack. An unconcerned Jared reassured his wife that he wasn't worried.\n\n\nDorian paid Ross a visit in the cabana, advising him that she wanted to \"discuss his options.\" She revealed that she would be either his worst nightmare or his ticket to all of his dreams come true. She wanted to know why his marriage to T\u00e9a had been a secret, and continued to bombard Ross with questions. She advised him that Blair didn't know it, but the plan had been changed.\n\n\nWriting him a huge check, Dorian advised Ross that she wanted him to \"romance Blair,\" sweep her off her feet, and get her out of Llanview. Ross sighed, noting that Blair wasn't interested in him. Dorian was surprised, since Ross was definitely Blair's type, \"feral and felonious.\" Going on with her plan, Dorian added that she wanted the couple gone before the wedding, before Todd and Blair had a chance to be uncivil and angry at each other, since that always led to them getting back together again. \"Do we have a deal here?\" she asked.\n\n\nSticking the check into Ross' shorts, Dorian advised him that she would get the charges against him dropped and his divorce finalized. Ross turned her down, admitting that he didn't want to double-cross Blair. Firmly, Dorian advised him that he needed to make sure that Todd and T\u00e9a were married and that Blair was kept away from Todd. Returning the check to Dorian, Ross declared that he couldn't help her. Dorian vowed to keep adding zeros to the check until Ross saw it her way.\n\n\n\"Whatever you're hiding, you can keep it hidden with this,\" she said, sliding the check back into the girly magazine Ross had been looking at when she arrived. She wanted him to reconsider her offer, but vowed to stop payment on the check if Todd's marriage didn't go off as planned.\n\n\nInside La Boulaie, Starr questioned Blair's motives on attending Todd's wedding. She didn't believe her mother's insistence that she only wanted to create a civilized relationship between the adults and that Blair had resigned herself to Todd and T\u00e9a getting married. Starr requested that Blair not cause any commotion, since Starr had been through enough drama in her life. If Blair were planning on interrupting the wedding, then she needed to do it before the ceremony, Starr advised her mother. She added that one day Blair would be swept off her feet by someone new.\n\n\nBlair advised her daughter that she had no time for romance. Their conversation halted abruptly when Jack and Sam arrived in their tuxedos. Jack loudly proclaimed that he didn't want T\u00e9a as a stepmother, but Blair assured him that everything would be fine.\n\n\nAfter Dorian left the cabana, Ross began to rip up the check. He wasn't fast enough though, as Blair showed up with his tuxedo for the wedding. She announced her intent to make a grand entrance at the wedding, after everyone was assembled. Once Ross was dressed, Blair proclaimed that it was time to crash the wedding. As Ross picked up the check from Dorian, he muttered, \"Or maybe not.\" Dorian ripped up the wedding invitation back at the house.\n\n\nMarty showed up at Cole's new apartment with some groceries and was startled to learn from her son that Todd and T\u00e9a were getting married. She felt strange, realizing that could have been her getting married to Todd instead, and that Cole might not know that she was alive. She felt happy and lucky, and warned Cole that Starr's family was full of minefields. Cole agreed that he would always be on the lookout. Marty also admitted that she and John were an item, and said she hoped that Todd and T\u00e9a would work it out. In answer to Cole's prodding, Marty admitted that her relationship with John was official. Cole was happy to hear it.\n\n\nLater on, Marty was impressed when Cole appeared, all dressed for the wedding. She proudly took his picture and they both admitted to being content that they were like regular and boring people, without all of the excitement and calamity of the past. Marty fretted that her only problem was that John was obsessed with a new case and she would probably not be able to see him much. She expressed her desire for everyone to have a new beginning.\n\n\nArriving at Todd's house, T\u00e9a had no success in talking to Todd. He insisted that he didn't want to know about her past and insisted that anything she had done couldn't possibly have been worse than what he had done over the years. Standing by her intention of getting the truth out, T\u00e9a advised Todd that she wanted no surprises or misunderstandings, and she needed him to know what had happened after he left her on the island.\n\n\nT\u00e9a confessed that she had taken up with Ross, but Todd stopped her again and confessed that he was okay with it. The more that T\u00e9a tried to explain what was on her mind, the more Todd refused to listen. She admitted that she had returned to Llanview for Todd, but before she was able to go further, Todd's sons arrived. Todd professed that he wasn't nervous and that his marriage to T\u00e9a would last forever.\n\n\n",

So she bribes Ross and encourages him to sweep Blair off her feet. He is torn between which direction to take.

And he implies that Jared could have set this up. Todd and Tea's wedding is ready to start and she is very worried what could happen if Todd finds out her secret.",
