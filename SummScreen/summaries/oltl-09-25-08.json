    "soap_central": "\n \"Me Llamo McBain...John McBain\" \n\n\nAt Plato Prison in Colombia, John flashed pictures of both Carlo and Cris to the guard, to no avail. The guard advised John that he was unable to give any information on a prisoner, which allowed John to realize that Cris was indeed there. Trying to work his way into the prison, he was mystified when Vanessa Montez arrived and was immediately admitted. Inside, she reiterated to Cris that she would be unable to help him unless he aided her attempts to locate her husband. He assured her that he would, pleading that he was afraid of being killed, due to her husband getting under everyone's skin there. She acknowledged that she would get him out in her own way and would not make the phone calls that Cris had requested of her. Cris swore on his mother's life, as he held onto the cross around Vanessa's neck, that he would assist her in finding her husband. \n\n\nAs John tried to get somewhere with the guard, the warden arrived. As the warden conversed with the guard in Spanish, John broke in, speaking Spanish as well. Introducing himself, he insisted that he knew the men he was looking for were on the premises and he requested that he not be jerked around. He admitted that he was not there on official business, but could make it that way with one phone call. As Vanessa left the cell to retrieve her purse, John went to her immediately, holding out the picture of Cris. Losing his temper, the warden insisted that he had never seen either of the men, and vowed to lock John up instead, if he continued to harass him. He reminded Vanessa of their business and he led her back into the cell. Once there, she handed him a roll of money that he obviously and eagerly anticipated. In addition, she held out her purse with more money and asked if it was enough to buy the American's freedom. Insisting the prisoner was Ray Montez, the warden backed down and accepted the bribe when she offered to speak to John about the picture he had shown her. \n\n\nOutside, the guard urged John to leave before the warden returned. John went to work quickly and, baiting the guard, mentioned that he knew about Hesser passing around lots of money. He assumed the warden had obtained some and doubted that the guard had received any himself. He suggested that when everything blew up, the warden would be able to pay off whomever he needed to, while the guard would not be able to do the same. Looking around, the guard told John to return in ten minutes, once the warden was gone. \n\n\nLater, the guard led John to the cell where Cris had been held. It was empty, except for a prison suit with the name Montez stamped on it. \n\n\nIn the courtroom, everyone was visibly shocked as the judge rendered his decision to give custody of Langston to her uncle. As friends and family alike shouted at the judge, Dorian knocked over the table at which she was sitting. Her attorney announced that there would be an appeal. Langston was speechless as Ray advised her that she would grow to love Colombia. He was grateful to Dorian for looking after Langston, but figured that the girl would adapt as easily to her new home as she did with Dorian's family. He explained calmly that he had come to the United States merely to retrieve his niece and would be returning to his own country. It was pointed out that Langston was a citizen of both the United States and Colombia. A livid Dorian accused Ray of doing nothing more than child trafficking. \n\n\nDorian continued to plead with the judge, citing the corrupt prison system in Colombia that released Ray from jail. She wondered how it was possible to leave Langston alone with this man. Dorian pointed out how her family loved her, even with all of her faults. She advised the judge how Langston herself had helped Starr in a time of crisis. She painted Langston as a survivor who overcame many personal losses and even brought Markko into the speech, acknowledging how much of a man he was and a wonderful boyfriend to Langston. She berated the judge for not listening to Langston's own choice to remain with Dorian. As the judge sympathetically told her that life was unfair and that there was no right answer, but that his decision would remain unchanged, Dorian turned into a ferocious animal, protecting her cub. She snarled and yelled at the judge, calling him several names, a \"son of a bitch\" and a \"soulless tyrant\" among them. \n\n\nAs Dorian sobbed, she told the judge that she had no respect for him. She ordered him to reconsider his decision or she would ruin his life as she ruined the Buchanans' lives. As Dorian continued, the judge finally had enough. He cited her in contempt, and warned the rest of the clan as they continued to shout, that he would make more room in the cell. He advised her that she could conduct his downfall behind bars. An agitated Dorian was led out in handcuffs. \n\n\nAs the search for Brody and Shane continued, Bo phoned in the AMBER Alert to the television networks. Rex handed over a photo of Shane to accompany the official notifications. He also made a quick call to Layla and learned that she was able to provide them with the phone number of Brody's sister. Unfortunately, they were unable to reach her. Bo was unable to learn of Brody's military background, discovering that the man's records were sealed. Regrettably, they presumed that meant that something was being concealed. Gigi blamed herself for all that had happened, because of her hiding the truth over the years. Not getting anywhere on leads to Brody's whereabouts, a stumped Bo thought that perhaps they could locate the soldier in the picture that was found among Brody's things. He thought that the man might be able to provide some insight into Brody's past. \n\n\nThe soldier's name was legible once the photo was blown up. Tracking him down, Bo called the man, Wes, and asked for some help. Refusing to speak against Brody and rat him out, Wes changed his mind when he heard that Gigi was there and that there was a child involved. He recalled how Brody used to talk about Gigi. He admitted that there had been an incident in Iraq and Brody had shot and killed a child. \n\n\nUp on Llantano Mountain, Brody reacted angrily as Shane reached for his gun. \"You don't touch another man's gun,\" he snapped. Losing his temper, he began to instruct Shane on the proper handling of the gun, while hearing gunshots from battle in his head. Realizing he scared the boy, Brody attempted to lighten the mood by getting Shane to chuckle. He spoke of his military experience and at first refused to answer when the boy asked him if had ever killed anyone. Suddenly he opened up, confessing that he had killed many people in Iraq. He learned too late though, that he was killing a part of himself every time, he added. \n\n\nContinuing with Shane's lesson, Brody coolly hit his target in the tree. He realized that he had forgotten an important part of the lesson, which was choosing the target. When Shane asked to try to shoot, an annoyed Brody gave in. He asked the boy to stand in front of the target first. \n\n\nTalia and Antonio attempted to comfort a somber Carlotta, worried over her son's disappearance. When Layla and Sarah arrived with bags of food, a recipe book and no idea of how to prepare some favorites, Carlotta was snapped out of her funk and eagerly focused on helping the young women prepare a feast. She shared the fact that Cris was secretly a better cook than she, having improved on some of the family recipes himself. \n\n\nTalia berated herself for not acting like a Hesser and listening to her father's own teachings. She should have killed Carlo when she had the chance, she confided to Antonio. She thought that she needed to take him out, before another member of Antonio's family was in danger. She also felt that she was the reason for the danger, though Antonio quickly pointed out his family's history with Carlo. It was Antonio's opinion that they should be better than their fathers, and not associate themselves with their violence. Everyone sat down to a great feast and Antonio said grace, praying for protection for Cris. \n\n\n",
