When he discovered the photograph of John and Marty, he calmly cut John from the photo and ripped it into pieces. Janet appeared and told him that Marty was upstairs doing research on child rearing. Pleased to hear that Marty was making plans to care for his grandchild, Todd told Janet that Marty was excited about the birth of the child. Janet surmised that Todd was also anxious to raise the child. When Janet mentioned that Starr obviously trusted Todd because she had decided to allow him to raise her child, a look of guilt crossed Todd's face. \n\n\nAs Todd and Janet discussed the arrival of his grandchild, Todd was surprised to learn that Janet also had a daughter. Janet informed Todd that she was estranged from her family and was considered dead to them. Janet told Todd that he was fortunate to be close to his own daughter, and advised him to pray that things stayed that way. Todd appeared bothered by Janet's words. \n\n\nJanet discovered a photograph of Viki and was shocked to learn that she was Todd's sister. Janet listened to Todd speak lovingly about his family. Todd smiled as she commended him for being a family man. Janet told Todd that Marty was looking forward to raising his grandchild and truly cared for him. Alone, Todd stared thoughtfully at photos of Marty and his family members. \n\n\nAt Plato Prison in Colombia, John and the guard discovered Cris missing from his cell. Upon finding the prison uniform that Cris was wearing, John questioned why the name Montez was on the prison jumpsuit. John demanded to know why Cris was in Plato Prison under an assumed name. Unable to provide John with answers, the guard turned to leave but John restrained him. As John ordered the guard to give him information on Cris's whereabouts, the warden placed a gun against John's back and threatened to shoot him. \n\n\nOutside the courtroom, Ray sent Clint a text message stating that the job was complete. Ray asked for further instructions. \n\n\nInside the courtroom, Blair tried to calm Langston, Starr, Markko, and Cole. Enraged that the judge had given Ray custody of Langston and that Dorian had been arrested, the teens struggled to deal with Ray's decision to take Langston to Colombia. Vowing to protect Langston, an angered Starr, Markko, and Cole promised to take care of Ray. Blair warned the teens that they would cause trouble by reacting hastily. After promising to handle the situation, Blair pleaded with the teens to focus on their studies. \n\n\nWhen Ray entered the courtroom, he faced the wrath of Blair and the teens. Langston asked her uncle why he wanted to take her away from her family and friends. Ray told Langston that Colombia was her home. Ignoring their pleas, Ray informed Blair and the kids that the judge had already made his decision - Ray was Langston's legal guardian and she would be raised in Colombia. Fed up with Ray's insensitivity, Starr demanded to know who was responsible for Ray coming to Llanview and claiming Langston. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint smiled as he read Ray's text message. Before he could respond, Dallas interrupted him. When Clint expressed his pleasure over having Dallas as a houseguest, Dallas reminded him that Nora wouldn't share his enthusiasm. Although Clint assured Dallas that he could sway Nora, Dallas insisted that he contact her immediately. Upon learning from Nigel that Rachael and R.J. had unexpected called Nora away to Chicago, Clint instructed Nigel to escort Dallas to the guest quarters. Alone, Clint placed a call to Ray. \n\n\nStepping out in the hall, Ray spoke with Clint over the phone. Clint was elated to learn that Ray had won custody and that Dorian had been thrown in jail. Citing that since Dorian was in jail and wouldn't be able to witness Ray dragging Langston away, Clint instructed Ray to allow Langston to spend the night with Blair at La Boulaie. Returning to the courtroom, Ray informed Langston that he had business to tend to and would allow her to stay at La Boulaie for the night. Ray advised Langston to pack her belongings because they would be leaving for Colombia. Before leaving, Ray assured Langston that she would adjust to the situation. Blair instructed Markko and Cole to take Starr and Langston home. Starr, Markko, and Cole vowed to stand by Langston. \n\n\nIn Bo's office, Gigi and Rex listened as Bo spoke with Wes over the speakerphone. When Wes told Bo that Brody had killed a ten-year-old boy during the war, Gigi flew into hysterics. As he tried to calm Gigi, an anxious Rex demanded to know why Brody would kill a child. Wes tried to explain the harsh reality of being a soldier, but Rex wanted direct answers involving the incident. While attempting to quiet Rex, Bo explained to Wes that Brody had taken Shane without Gigi's permission and that they were concerned. During the phone conversation, an officer entered the room and informed Bo that Brody's car had been spotted on Llantano Mountain. Bo and his men rushed to Llantano Mountain, and Rex and Gigi followed behind. \n\n\nAt the police station, Blair demanded that Dorian be released from jail. The officer refused to help her and informed Blair that the only person who could help her was out of the country. \n\n\nBack at Plato Prison, the warden reminded John that he didn't have any authority in Colombia, and continued to hold him at gunpoint. When the warden threatened to throw him in a cell and stated that he would never be found, John advised him that he was an officer with connections to the FBI. After assuring the warden that the US authorities were aware of his whereabouts, John warned him that he wasn't done with his investigation and calmly walked away. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr, Markko, and Cole comforted Langston. Alone with Cole, Starr confided in him that she would feel alone if Langston weren't around for the birth of her baby. Before leaving, Cole promised that he would be her friend and help her through the pregnancy. Starr appeared hopeful. \n\n\nDallas overheard Clint requesting that Ray return to the mansion. Dallas agreed to keep quiet about her discovery and left so that Clint could speak privately with Ray. When Ray arrived, Clint reminded him that he didn't want him to remain at the main house for very long because he feared that someone would see him. Extending his hand, Clint thanked Ray for a job well done. At that moment, Cole entered the room unnoticed and witnessed the handshake. \n\n\nBlair told Starr that she was unable to get Dorian released from jail. Starr expressed her concern for Langston and told her mother that she didn't know how Langston would handle losing another parent. Nearby, Markko tried to console Langston. Markko promised Langston that he wouldn't allow Ray to take her away from her family. \n\n\nUp on Llantano Mountain, a crazed Brody held a gun in his hand. He promised Shane that he would allow him to fire the weapon, but told him to stand in front of his target. When the child questioned why, Brody envisioned the face of the ten-year-old child he had killed during the war. Upon realizing that Shane wasn't the child from the war, Brody told Shane that he had second thoughts about teaching the child to shoot a weapon. Pleading with Brody to teach him, Shane stated that Brody was his father and wondered who would instruct him if Brody didn't. Shane's words gave Brody a change of heart, and he handed the child his weapon. As Shane held the gun and asked Brody if he could fire, Brody envisioned Shane as the child he had killed in the war. Brody's visions sent him into a state of panic. \n\n\nOn the way to Llantano Mountain, Rex tried to comfort a panicked Gigi. She blamed herself and feared that the situation would have a devastating outcome. Rex assured Gigi that Shane would be fine. \n\n\nAs Shane held the gun, Brody continued to have flashbacks of his violent days in Iraq. Brody fell to the ground and sobbed. When a concerned Shane approached him, Brody embraced the child. In tears, Brody professed his love for Shane and apologized to him. Brody held the weapon and told Shane that he would never hurt him. Shane didn't believe he would. At that very moment, Bo and the Llanview PD surrounded Brody and Shane. \n\n\nWith weapons drawn, the officers ordered Brody to surrender. Gigi pleaded with Brody to release Shane, but the child screamed at his mother and told her that he knew the truth. Holding onto Brody for dear life, Shane screamed that Gigi was trying to take his father away from him and demanded that the officers withdraw their weapons. A sharpshooter informed Bo that he had a clear shot of Brody and asked for permission to fire. Bo instructed him to stand by. A tearful Brody insisted that he would never hurt Shane. Acknowledging that he was aware of Brody's concern for Shane, Bo ordered Brody to drop the weapon. \n\n\nPointing his weapon at the police, Brody yelled that he couldn't let them take Shane from him. Standing behind Bo and the array of officers, Gigi and Rex begged Brody to let Shane go. When Gigi screamed that Shane was her son, Brody told the child to go to his mother, but Shane refused. Shane was certain that Brody would be killed if Shane left his side. Shane insisted that they were making a mistake. Hearing Shane's words, Bo commanded his men to lower their weapons. Rex begged Bo to reconsider, but he wouldn't. Brody ordered Shane to go to Gigi, and Shane followed his father's instructions. \n\n\nCrying, Shane pleaded with his mother and Bo to understand Brody's side of the story. Speaking to Brody as a fellow serviceman, Bo told him that he understood how circumstances from the war could affect a man. At that moment, Brody had another flashback from the war. Falling to the ground, Brody began yelling that he was following orders and didn't mean to kill the child. As everyone watched, a hysterical Brody continued to have flashbacks of Iraq. Believing that he was in Iraq, Brody felt he was under attack and pointed his gun in the direction of Rex, Gigi, and the police. Bo demanded that he drop the weapon. \n\n\n",
