    "soap_central": "\n\n\"Hello, Victoria,\" Irene greeted Viki after Viki opened the front door at Llanfair. Viki's first thought was to call the police to report Irene's escape from jail, but Irene told her to go ahead and call them. Irene announced that she'd been released, and she followed Viki inside. Viki phoned Bo, and he reluctantly confirmed that Irene had worked out a deal with the \"Feds.\" Viki was outraged, and Bo advised her to be careful.\n\n\nViki ordered Irene to leave, but Irene looked around the foyer. Irene declared that she had expected the house to have been left to Irene after Victor Sr. had died. Irene claimed to be there to extend her sympathy to Viki for Victor Jr.'s death, and Viki was aghast. She didn't believe that Irene knew the meaning of sorry. Irene voiced her condolences and stated that she had loved Victor too.\n\n\nViki couldn't understand how Irene could claim to have loved her sons when she had destroyed them. Irene affirmed that she'd done her best, and a sarcastic Viki mentioned the torture and prison that Irene had involved her sons in. Irene was angry that her former husband, Viki's father, had left everything to Todd.\n\n\nIrene was also angry over the situation as it stood. Viki pointed out that it had been Irene's own fault, but Irene denied it. She pointed out that Jack had witnessed Todd shooting Victor. Viki was skeptical, and she admitted that she doubted Jack's story. Irene's actions and agency had set everything into motion.\n\n\nViki recalled how close she and Irene had been at one time. \"You have lost yourself,\" Viki told her former friend. \"What happened to you?\" Viki asked. An angry Irene declared that Victor had used her, but Viki disagreed. She'd thought that Irene had been willing. Viki added that she had gone through insufferable acts at the hands of her father, but she hadn't turned out the way Irene had.\n\n\nIt was Irene's turn to disagree. She felt that Viki had also committed unspeakable acts, but she had been able to pin everything on her alters. Viki accused Irene of abusing her children, though Irene still insisted that she'd loved them. Viki couldn't believe her ears. Irene had tried to kill both of her sons, and she'd abandoned her daughter. Irene had pretended to be dying, and she'd left Tina at Llanfair, Viki charged.\n\n\nIrene acknowledged that she'd done that, but she'd always felt that Tina needed more attention than Irene had been willing to give. Viki recalled that Irene had also neglected to mention that Tina and Viki were sisters. \"Do you even know where she is?\" Viki asked Irene. \"Do you?\" Irene countered.\n\n\nViki admitted that she hadn't seen or heard from Tina in a few years. Irene observed that Tina had always been a handful, but Viki quickly reminded her that Tina had been abandoned. Tina had turned out to be shallow, thoughtless and selfish just like Irene. \"Pity it didn't take,\" Irene noted of her decision to have Viki raise Tina and instill other qualities in her.\n\n\nViki ordered Irene to leave again, but Irene announced that there was still some unfinished business. Irene again wanted to apologize. She'd never meant to hurt Viki. \"Right,\" Viki retorted. Irene held up a gun.\n\n\nBo visited Todd's cell and explained how sorry he was that he'd had to let Irene go. Todd was furious that he had to remain behind while Irene had been able to leave after committing so many crimes. T\u00e9a arrived to see Todd, and Todd asked for some privacy while he spoke to his \"hot, ex-wife lawyer.\" Bo obliged and left the couple alone.\n\n\nTodd was ecstatic to see T\u00e9a, but she advised him that she hadn't agreed to represent him yet. She was angry at Todd for manipulating Dani, but he denied it. \"You have to help me,\" Todd implored T\u00e9a. He informed her that Dani had been there to visit, and their daughter was strong and beautiful like T\u00e9a. He advised T\u00e9a that she'd done a good job of raising Dani.\n\n\nT\u00e9a called Todd a \"suck-up,\" but Todd went on about how Dani had even understood his jokes. Todd began to tell a joke, but he grew serious. He announced that someone was setting him up. He added that Jack hated him and had been lying about what he'd claimed to have seen. Jack had invented the entire eyewitness scene, Todd insisted. T\u00e9a admitted that she'd found Jack's story \"shaky.\" Jack had forgotten everything, and then he'd suddenly remembered.\n\n\nT\u00e9a divulged that even Blair had doubted Jack's story, and Blair had been \"working on\" her son. Blair was trying to gain Jack's trust. \"Jack wants me to fry,\" Todd proclaimed. The couple spoke about the missing gun. T\u00e9a was hopeful that the person who decided to represent Todd would find the gun. She felt as though there was something that Todd wasn't telling her.\n\n\nTodd recalled Irene's threats. He advised T\u00e9a that he would tell her everything, but only if she agreed to represent him. Then they would have attorney-client privilege, and no one would be able to force T\u00e9a to talk, he explained. T\u00e9a agreed that she would have to believe and trust Todd in order to represent him, but he would have to do the same. When Todd remained quiet, an annoyed T\u00e9a called out for the guard.\n\n\nTodd quickly gave in and agreed to risk his life to tell her everything. T\u00e9a warned him that it had better not be a trick. Todd revealed that Irene had threatened him. Irene had been in a nearby cell at the same time, and she'd alluded to the fact that she had the missing gun, Todd disclosed. Irene had also made Louie go away.\n\n\nApparently, Irene still wanted a microchip that she believed Todd to possess, Todd revealed. He had no clue what Irene had been referring to, and he didn't remember anything. \"They dismantled my brain,\" Todd stated. His family had been the only thing that had kept him going. He needed T\u00e9a to help him or the entire eight years would have been wasted.\n\n\nT\u00e9a summed up all that Todd had told her, and she clarified that he wanted her to defend the man accused of killing her husband. Todd swore on the lives of his children that he was innocent. He also wouldn't have killed Victor because of T\u00e9a's love for the man. \"I'm not the only lawyer in town,\" T\u00e9a reminded him. Todd insisted that she was the only one for him, and if she believed him, a jury would too.\n\n\nT\u00e9a thought about how difficult it would be for her to go through evidence and photos. Todd promised to make it up to her. \"Our daughter will have a father,\" he added. \"You're a real son of a bitch,\" T\u00e9a declared. Todd was thrilled. T\u00e9a admitted that she believed in him, and she would represent him. Todd thanked T\u00e9a as she got ready to leave. She had lots of work to do.\n\n\nDani called out for T\u00e9a and walked into her mother's bedroom. T\u00e9a wasn't there, but Dani spotted the box that had been delivered from the Sun. The contents, that included all of Victor's personal belongings, were spilled out on the bed. The DNA test results that stated that John was Liam's father was sitting in the pile.\n\n\nTomas wandered into the bedroom, looking for T\u00e9a also, and found Dani sitting on the bed. She told him what she'd found and picked up a photo of herself and Victor. Tearfully, she explained that she had only recently begun to call Victor \"dad.\" She was also crying because she'd been to visit Todd. He had been happy to see her, and they had enjoyed a talk.\n\n\n\"He told me he's innocent,\" Dani told her uncle. Todd had seemed sincere, but she really didn't have anything to compare it to, as it had been their first conversation. She felt bad for Todd, but she wondered if she were being \"too easy\" on Todd. Tomas doubted that she was, and he was sorry for the eight years that Todd had been locked up. Tomas blamed himself. He'd thought the agency he'd worked for had been the \"good guys.\"\n\n\nTomas explained that he'd turned Todd over to the agency, because he'd believed that Todd had been an \"enemy of the state.\" It had turned out, though, that Todd had merely been an enemy of the people who'd worked at the agency. Tomas had done the dirty work for them. Dani assured her uncle that it hadn't been his fault, and she didn't want him to be so hard on himself. It had been her \"twisted grandmother,\" Dani asserted.\n\n\nTomas still thought there was no excuse for what he had done, and he still blamed himself. Dani hoped that Todd wouldn't remain locked up if he were innocent. She hoped Todd would be treated fairly. Suddenly, Dani spotted Blair's wallet.\n\n\nBlair promised to take Jack to the stables for some riding, but they stopped at T\u00e9a's house to look for Blair's missing wallet. She advised Jack that she needed her driver's license, and she apologized to him for returning to the house. She realized that it was Jack's first time back since the murder that he'd witnessed.\n\n\nJack assured his mother he was fine, as Blair continued. She pointed out that the Todd she'd known would have never done the things he'd been accused of doing. Blair looked around the living room for her wallet as she and Jack spoke. Blair admitted that she'd been thinking of  \"poor Victor,\" and she couldn't believe that she'd been married to Todd at one time.\n\n\nBlair had been in love with Todd, but she'd been na\u00efve, Blair stated. The day she'd married Todd had been the happiest day of her life. It was the end of the Todd they all knew, Blair declared. He'd been accused of killing the man who'd raised Jack, but Todd would \"burn in hell, thanks to you,\" she told Jack.\n\n\nThe murder had obviously been pre-meditated, and Todd would be sentenced. Luckily, Todd would receive the death penalty, Blair concluded. \"The what?\" Jack shouted. Blair emphasized that Todd deserved it, but Jack began to grow panicked.\n\n\nBlair advised Jack that he'd told the truth, so whatever happened was not Jack's fault. \"Maybe he made a mistake...he doesn't deserve to die,\" Jack stammered. He hadn't meant for Todd to die, he added. \"Jack, what are you saying?\" Blair asked her son. She noted that if Todd were executed, then Jack would have done the right thing.\n\n\nJack tried to talk, but he found it difficult. Blair informed him that he could tell her whatever he wanted to. \"Mom, I didn't mean to...\" He was interrupted when Dani and Tomas walked down the stairs with Blair's wallet. \"Jack, are you okay?\" Tomas asked. Blair stated that they were just having a chat. Blair was happy to get her wallet back, and she explained that she must have dropped it when she'd had a visit with T\u00e9a.\n\n\nTomas asked Blair to go out, but she declined his offer. She wanted to spend some time with her son. Tomas asked Dani next, but reluctantly, she advised him that she wanted to stay home to wait for her mother. Tomas went out alone, and Blair turned to Jack. She was ready to head to the stables with him, so that they could finish their conversation. \"I have nothing else to say to you,\" Jack snapped.\n\n\nNatalie found John at Rodi's and advised him that she had something to say. John did too, and Natalie urged him to go first. \"It's about us,\" John began. He warned her that he'd had a chat with Roxy, and Natalie knew how Roxy was. Natalie stopped him. She'd heard what John had said, because she had been eavesdropping. She'd dropped by to talk to him, and she'd heard the conversation between John and Roxy.\n\n\n\"You don't love me,\" Natalie stated. She really didn't want to hear John's explanation, as he stuttered and tried to talk. \"I get it,\" Natalie declared firmly. John was frantic as he tried to explain that Roxy wouldn't let go of the conversation, and he'd said something else. Natalie advised him that he didn't have to explain. John grew insistent, but then he spotted the diamond ring on her finger.\n\n\n\"Brody just popped the question. Out of the blue,\" Natalie confirmed. \"You said yes?\" John inquired. Natalie informed him that was the reason for her visit. She'd wanted to tell him herself. John smiled faintly. \"Congratulations,\" he told her. He was sure they'd be happy, and he appreciated hearing the news from Natalie.\n\n\nJohn advised her that he had things to do, and he was busy. Natalie wondered what he had wanted to say. \"It doesn't matter anymore,\" John replied. Bo arrived as Natalie was leaving. She hid her face from Bo as he rushed inside to see John. \"Did you talk to her?\" Bo asked John anxiously. \"She and Lovett are getting married. That's all I gotta say, Bo. End of story,\" John announced.\n\n\nJack and Dani stared at the photo that Dani had found amidst Victor's belongings. Both teens declared that they missed Victor. T\u00e9a returned home and advised Blair that she intended to represent Todd, because she believed him. Blair informed Jack of T\u00e9a's decision.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Blair huddled together and whispered. Blair revealed that she'd almost gotten Jack to admit that he was lying. There was a knock at the door. It was an attorney, and he had the last will and testament of Victor Lord Jr.\n\n\nTodd received his lunch. He lifted the lid and found a letter for him. He opened it up and read it. It was from Irene, and she threatened him again. She advised him that he would not get the gun back, and she would have to take \"drastic action\" if she did not get what she wanted. She ordered him to meet her at the docks. \"Or I will take your loved ones out one by one,\" the letter's conclusion stated.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair acts \"unrealistic\" toward Jack in an attempt to bond with him by telling him that Victor was the love of her life, that he did the right thing and told the truth that original Todd murdered the only father he's ever known and that original Todd will get the death penalty and deserves it. And right at that point, Jack is almost ready to admit that he lied. Irene goes to see Viki and tells her that Viki's father should have given herself and Victor his home and fortune when he died instead of Viki. Viki wants nothing to do with her and is outraged that she's been released from jail when original Todd has been falsely accused of murder. Tea agrees to represent him and he admits to her that Irene is threatening him and is his only source for finding the gun that will exonerate him. John is ready to admit to Natalie that he is in love with her. But it's too late when he sees she's not only accepted Brody's proposal but has incorrectly overheard him telling Roxy that he does not love Natalie.",
