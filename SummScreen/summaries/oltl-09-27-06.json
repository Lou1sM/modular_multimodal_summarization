It has to involve something that she cares about, Adriana decides. Money? Men? Her Girls? She also relates that she's quit her job at Craze and is not sure what she wants to do now.\n\n\nRenee tries to toss David out of the Palace for allegedly propositioning the mayor's wife, but Dorian comes to his defense. Everyone should get a second chance, she advises Renee. They console each other for being on the outs with everyone and Dorian thanks him for coming to her rescue. He's decided to leave town and wants Dorian to come with him. She declines, citing her desire to win back Clint and Adriana. The timing is quite coincidental when a casting agent hands David a card. He's a natural and ought to try to make it in show business. David decides he'll head for Hollywood. Dorian is skeptical but they part with a kiss.\n\n\nBefore making love, Claudia asks Nash if he realizes who she is; that she's not Tess. He's perfectly aware and knows that Tess isn't coming back, he says, as he turns down her picture on the nightstand.\n\n\nThe news of John's death begins to make its way through Llanview. A devastated Michael stumbles home and falls into Marcie's arms. She doesn't notice at first, wrapped up in her own news. The judge has decided to award Tommy to them; they will become his parents. Michael breaks down and shares his own news. He makes Marcie promise that they'll never leave each other. He in turn promises Tommy that they'll always protect him. He realizes that he has to tell his mother (who was coming to give John her ring for Natalie) of her son's death. Jess and Antonio are interrupted by a phone call about John; Jess frantically decides that she needs to locate and be with Natalie right away. Bo breaks the news to Nat who refuses to believe her uncle at first and demands to see the body. Not accepting that the body had tattoos, or was of the same weight or that his ID was found, she finally cracks when Bo mentions the medallion found, the one that she gave him. She breaks down as Bo tries to comfort her. She wants to stay behind in John's place, wants to be alone. He agrees to honor her request but wants to hear from her; he wants her to call her family. As he leaves, Jess arrives to be with her sister but Bo convinces her to allow Nat her privacy for the time being. Jess returns to Antonio. She can feel Nat's pain but agrees it best that she be alone. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo is at Natalie's place and she tells him that she is studying and can't talk right now. He insists and boldly walks in the place. \"It is about John.\" She closes the door but hopes that he makes the visit short. She explains that the balloons are for a celebration that she plans to have when John comes home. \"He isn't coming home.\" She grabs her coat, \"Well, what hospital is he in?\" Bo says that John was in an accident and didn't make it. Michael tries to put on a better face before entering the house but Marcie hears him coming in and opens the door to tell that they got the go-ahead to adopt Tommy. He tries to be glad but she can see that something is wrong. He blubbers and finally gets it out that John is dead. Marcie is stunned. He tells the whole story and only feels better when Tommy is in his arms. David is getting tossed out of Renee's restaurant. He apparently made a pass at the mayor's wife. Dorian saves him from getting kicked out. He asks Dorian to run away with him. He isn't kidding. He is getting treated badly in town and doesn't want to stick around for Spencer's trial. Dorian can't leave. She has to work things out with Clint and Adriana. A woman comes to David and hands him her business card. She is a movie director and thinks that David is hot for his age. She offers her work if he will call her. David says his good-byes to Dorian and they share one last magic kiss before he is out the door. Claudia is in bed with Nash, and she keeps stopping him to make sure that he knows that she isn't Tess. He does. While she is busy kissing his body literally from top to bottom, he looks over at Tess's picture on the bedside table and he puts it face down. In the morning, he remembers that he put it down and picks it up again. Michael is about to call his mother but then decides not to. She is coming to town the next day anyway. She was going to bring her engagement ring for John to propose with to Natalie. Natalie won't believe that John is dead unless she sees the body. Bo doesn't want her to see what he saw. \"He was burned Natalie.\" It is only when he shows her the necklace John had on him that Natalie accepts what is told to her. Bo wants to take her to stay with family but she insists on staying at the house 'with John' alone. When alone, she puts on John's leather jacket, and pulls it tight around her while she inhales his scent from it. She spends the night sitting at the window, in the jacket, staring out into the night.",
