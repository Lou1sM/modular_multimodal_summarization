He told Dani that they had no time and needed to leave right away. Dani inquired where he planned on taking her, and Todd told her it was time to go back to court to hear the judge's decision on the custody case. Dani wanted Nate to accompany them, but Todd refused her request. Nate offered to follow in his own car, but Dani suddenly realized that she hadn't heard from Blair, who was supposed to phone her if the judge's decision had been made.\n\n\nShe was instantly suspicious of Todd and realized that he wanted to run away with her. Todd pointed out that Blair knew he was picking Dani up, but Dani suspected Todd of lying. Todd gave in and agreed, and he recommended that she get into his car \"if [you] want to honor [your] mother's dying wish.\" He planned to take her far away. Dani chastised her father, because she knew he was doing it for himself and not her mother.\n\n\nHe agreed that he was, but also for Dani, because she was his daughter. Dani pointed out that he had other children, but Todd sadly acknowledged that he wouldn't have Dani if she ended up with Ross. Dani admitted that she cared about Todd.\n\n\nTodd announced that he had a private jet on standby, but Dani turned him down. She didn't want him to go to prison for kidnapping her, and she knew that T\u00e9a wouldn't have liked it. They bickered over T\u00e9a's will and whether it might be a fake one. Todd was sure it was, and Nate urged him to prove it somehow. Todd thought that Dani reminded him of T\u00e9a more and more everyday. Dani was right, he conceded. T\u00e9a wouldn't have liked his plan.\n\n\nElsewhere on the school grounds, Darren and Destiny walked and talked after their own Driver's Ed class. Destiny admitted that she had trailed her brother Greg to Cherryvale, where he was treating an apparently important woman. Greg had barred her from seeing even a glimpse of the woman, though Darren thought maybe Greg was worried about losing another patient. Destiny was confused that Greg even had a patient somewhere besides the hospital, since he wasn't known to make house calls. Darren wondered if there might be something special about the patient, and Destiny decided she would check it out herself.\n\n\nThe teens checked their funds but realized they were low on cash and wouldn't be able to make the trip in a cab. It was an hour away. Destiny suggested they steal one of the cars from the driving class, but Darren was aghast at the idea. He wondered what Greg's patient might even be able to tell them, but Destiny thought that perhaps Greg might be more open with his patients than with his family.\n\n\nTodd expressed the need to see Greg, since Greg had been the last one who had spoken to T\u00e9a. He could get Greg to testify for him. Destiny and Darren walked up, and Destiny shared the news that her brother had been in Cherryvale. She was confident that Todd would solve the mystery there. Todd quickly got into his car and took off.\n\n\nBoth Starr and Blair showed up at Todd's house separately with the same idea of keeping Todd company until the judge reached her decision. Todd wasn't around, and they both prayed that the judge would side with Todd and award him custody of Dani. They straightened up the place while they chatted and wondered where he might be. Blair was concerned that Ross would win and take Dani out of the country. She wondered how Starr was doing and apologized for devoting all of her time to Dani. Starr confessed that she was stressed, though she advised her mother that she and Cole were still working on their relationship.\n\n\nHer problem was with James, Starr admitted. They had gotten close while they were on the run, but she had told him she just wanted to be friends. James had wanted more, and while she was hopeful that she and Cole would be happy again, she kept thinking about James. She was unhappy that James just wanted to walk away from their friendship, because she wanted him in her life. Blair gave her daughter a hug.\n\n\nStarr stressed that she still loved Cole, and she felt like a bad person. Blair promised that it wasn't the first time a woman had loved two different guys, but Starr could only have one. Starr was adamant that she wanted Cole, and she knew that he would be happy that James was gone from her life.\n\n\nJames met up with his brother at Rodi's and let him know that he was still in pursuit of the person who had gotten Ford fired. Ford let it slip that he knew who the perpetrator was, but as James continued to push to make Ford reveal the person's identity, Ford backed off. He explained that he didn't know specifically but assumed it was someone he had \"screwed over.\"  James pointed out that Ford really cared about Langston, but Ford acknowledged that sometimes a person had to give something up if he really cared about it.\n\n\nJames was disappointed that he would be at the university without his brother, but Ford explained that it was probably better in the long run. James would be able to have a fresh start. Ford was busy checking out jobs. James pointed out that Ford wouldn't have to lose Langston, and since he was no longer teaching, he could date her openly. Ford informed him that it wasn't to be, and James wondered why. Ford flashed back to Langston's confession of being the person who had caused him to lose his job.\n\n\nOut loud, Ford asked why James was so interested in Ford's love life. James thought that it would be nice if someone were happy, and Ford asked about Starr. He thought Starr and James were friends. James admitted he had kissed her, and it was too difficult to be friends. It was killing him to not to be able to talk to her, and he would transfer out of class if he did happen to run into her. Ford had to leave for a job interview at the mall camera shop, and James was horrified to hear that it was in sales. James was angry again at the malicious party who had destroyed Ford's life, especially since that person was probably laughing about the entire incident.\n\n\nGreg spoke quietly to T\u00e9a in the Cherryvale hospital when she awoke and asked for Dani and Todd. She was waiting for them, she told him. She grew hysterical, and wanted to know where they were. She expected them to walk through the door at any moment. Suddenly, she looked around and realized that she was no longer in the same room in the hospice.\n\n\nGreg declared that it was a different room because T\u00e9a's condition had changed. She wasn't worse, he assured her. She was getting better and had made a \"dramatic turn.\" He advised her that the tumor was no longer life-threatening. T\u00e9a was flabbergasted, and she began to cry. She called Greg a \"miracle worker.\" He wanted her to stay calm. He received a phone call from Todd, but he ignored it. T\u00e9a asked him to call Todd for her, because she wanted to be informed when his plane would be landing. She assumed she was still in St. Kitts.\n\n\nGreg pretended to call Todd, and he claimed to have reached Todd's voicemail. In his fake message, he stated that T\u00e9a was awake and had asked for him. He told T\u00e9a to get some rest, though she was too excited to sleep. He told her to try counting sheep. She looked at her family photo and proclaimed, \"I'll see you real soon, okay? I'm coming back to you.\"\n\n\nLangston unexpectedly bumped into Markko at Hallowed Grounds and learned that he was back in Llanview to see his father, who was scheduled to have heart bypass surgery. She wanted to know why Markko hadn't informed her of it previously. \"Why would I?\" he asked. Langston thought they'd eventually be friends, but Markko made it clear that they knew it wouldn't be possible. Langston started to cry and began to speak. She started to say she thought maybe...She was interrupted when Markko's phone began to ring.\n\n\nHe turned away to talk and thanked the person on the other end for the early ride to the airport. \"I didn't want to wake you. You were sleeping so soundly,\" he added. He finished his conversation and turned back to Langston. She asked if that were Karen, and she was surprised to hear that Karen and Markko had \"hooked up\" in Los Angeles. Markko replied that they had just been \"hanging out,\" and Langston quickly answered that she had no right to ask in the first place. Markko mentioned T\u00e9a, and what an amazing person she had been. That led to talk of Ford, and Langston shared the news that he had been fired for being involved with a student.\n\n\nMarkko called him a jerk, though he thought the man had been a good teacher. He wasn't surprised to learn that Ford had been with another student, but Langston quickly clarified that it wasn't exactly as it sounded. The details weren't known yet, though, she stated. Markko informed her that things were great in California. He had to get to the hospital, and Langston sent her good wishes for his dad, though she knew his dad wouldn't want to hear them. She wondered if she would get to see Markko again.\n\n\nMarkko declared that he would be returning to school, and he was only there to be with his dad. They said goodbye to each other and Markko left. A teary Langston went to the counter to order, and Ford walked in behind her. He looked at her longingly but turned around and ran out. Langston sensed someone behind her, but when she turned around, there was no one there.\n\n\nCole visited his mother on the premise of having a break from class, but Marty wondered if he were really there to see Hannah. Just then, the young woman walked into the room and told Marty that she was thrilled to be there, and Marty had been \"amazing.\" She had no idea how she'd repay Marty for all of her kindness, especially after saving her from both St. Anne's and certain jail time. Marty believed that everyone deserved a second chance. Cole mentioned his sociology course, and Hannah recalled that she had wanted to take that same class. Marty frowned when Cole noted that there was still time for Hannah to drop and add courses.\n\n\nShe thought that Hannah should take care of one thing at a time, and she thought that Hannah should concern herself with counseling first. Hannah left the others to take a shower, and Cole asked his mother how Hannah was really doing. Marty reminded him that Hannah had only been there for one night, but she thought the young woman had a \"fighting chance.\" Cole acknowledged that Hannah had made mistakes, but she had risked her life for him, and he wanted to help her. Marty urged her son to back off. She noted that it wasn't too long before that Hannah had been obsessed with Cole, and Marty wouldn't want her to misinterpret Cole's actions.\n\n\nCole emphasized that he and Starr were committed to each other, and Hannah was aware of that. He confessed that he hadn't told Starr about Hannah's living with Marty because he hadn't had the time. Marty told him he was giving her excuses and not reasons. Cole was sure that Starr would not react well to the news, and she would \"go ballistic.\"  Marty didn't think it was a good idea to keep the information from Starr, because Marty wouldn't want to see that ruin Starr and Cole's relationship. Cole agreed that he should talk to Starr. As the pair spoke, Hannah listened from the next room. She walked out and asked Cole if she could look at his Sociology notes. She might be able to get into his class, she added.\n\n\nCole did an about-face and thought it better that she not rush into anything. She had other things to take care of, and school could wait, he told her. He sent Starr a text message and left to meet her. Hannah was clearly annoyed with Marty. She said she'd seen Marty's reaction when Cole had first mentioned class. Hannah asked if Marty thought that Hannah was still a \"psycho\" who was after her son.\n\n\nStarr received a text message from Cole and headed out to Rodi's. Before she left, Blair made it clear that she thought James had done the right thing to walk away from Starr. Her daughter didn't feel right about it, but she was happy that she wouldn't have to worry about running into him at the university.\n\n\nStarr arrived at Rodi's, and the first person she saw was James. He headed to the door, though she assured him that he didn't have to leave. He disagreed with her. Cole walked in and saw the pair standing together. James said goodbye and left, and Cole went over to Starr. He was sorry for interrupting, but she assured him he hadn't. He had something to tell her, and they needed to talk in public, he told her. It was about Hannah, and Starr wasn't going to like it.\n\n\nDani was sure they would receive the judge's decision momentarily. Destiny convinced Darren that they needed to go to the library, and they walked off. Dani realized that Destiny was giving her some alone time with Nate, who declared that Todd was \"going all Bonnie and Clyde.\" Dani thought Todd was just like Ross in that way, and Nate proposed that it was because they both loved her. Just then, Dani received a phone call from Blair. The judge had reached her decision.\n\n\nBlair looked at the wedding photo of Todd and T\u00e9a and promised T\u00e9a that things would turn out as she had wanted them too.\n\n\nTodd arrived at the hospital in Cherryvale and called out for Greg in the hallway, right outside of T\u00e9a's room.\n\n\n",
