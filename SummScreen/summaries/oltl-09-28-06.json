She sobbed and asked if Natalie knew John was going to marry her, and when Michael said no, Eve said maybe she should. Michael said telling Natalie might make it harder for her to cope. Marcie said that if it were her she'd want to know everything about him before he died and that Natalie deserves to know how John felt. \"We have to tell her or she'll always go on wondering,\" Eve said. \n\n\nJessica visited Natalie. A barrage of media calls came through, but Jessica blew them off and unplugged the phone. Natalie thanked Jessica for coming, but said she wanted to be alone. Jessica Told Natalie she'd run out and get a soothing fruit shake that would make her feel better. When she came back, Natalie wasn't in the apartment.\n\n\nBo asked Antonio to replace John as chief of detectives. Seeing as he'd returned to police work at least a full month ago, Bo felt that there was no one better suited for the job. Antonio asked about John's caseload, but Bo said it was more important that they plan John's funeral.\n\n\nJessica called Antonio to tell him Natalie was missing, and he informed her that Natalie had just showed up at the police station. Natalie demanded that Bo let her see John's body, no matter how bad it was. Bo said okay. Natalie heard Spencer talking about how it was too bad John didn't live long enough to find out that he's really innocent. She ran up to Spencer and told him, \"You caused this! You killed John!\"\n\n\nNash fantasized that he was in bed with Tess and was disappointed when he realized it was Claudia. He got up and made himself a hangover shake that he said Tess used to make for him. He told Claudia he didn't remember how much he drank the previous night, but admitted that he remembered having sex with her. Claudia said it was no big deal, but Nash said he felt like he cheated on Tess. Claudia pointed out that you can't cheat on someone who doesn't exist and asked if maybe he feels like he cheated on Jessica. Nash said that's ridiculous. He told Claudia he wishes her the best and that's why they can never have sex again. Claudia agreed and said she doesn't want to jeopardize their friendship. Nash gave her a peck on the cheek and said good-bye. Jessica was walking up the hall and saw it.\n\n\nA man completely covered in bandages was shown lying in a hospital bed. A cop told the nurse watching over the patient that the person's name was Hugh Hughes.\n\n\nNora told Spencer that they were going to request that he be held without bail. She also questioned him about why he insisted Paige operate on Thomas McBain when he knew she came from a Christmas party where she was likely to have been drinking. Spencer said it doesn't make a difference, but Nora said she thinks the answer could help clear Paige of malpractice. Later, Nora told Paige that she'd done research and believes Spencer knew she was drunk when he insisted she operate. Paige said she'd blocked out that night for so many years and lived by Spencer's version that she doesn't really even remember what happened. She asked Nora why she was helping her. Nora admitted she wasn't fond of Paige's relationship with Matthew at first, but that now she sees how great she is with him and wants to help her out and assure that justice prevails. Nora took a call from the cop at the hospital. He said he needed to speak to Hugh Hughes's next of kin, so Nora passed the phone to Paige. The cop said that Hugh's been in an accident and is at the hospital. Nora offered to drive her. Paige visited the mummy that the doctors said was Hugh and said she hoped he knew she was there. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie sits alone. She hears knocking and goes running to the door thinking that John is there. It is Jessica and the disappointment shows on her face. Jessica soothes her sister and even makes her a banana and honey shake for her headache. Nash is working the blender and explains to Claudia that bananas are good for a hangover. She wants to know if he remembered the night before and he did. He remembered everything. He actually wants to talk to her about that He feels like he cheated on Tess. Claudia asks if he actually feels like he cheated on Jessica. There isn't anything in the kitchen to make the shakes so Jessica heads out to get the ingredients. When she returns, Natalie is gone! She calls Antonio and tells him that Natalie has done a runner. He turns and sees Natalie in the doorway. He goes to get Bo for her. While he is gone, Natalie sees an officer erasing John's name and runs over to him, shouting at him that John hasn't even been dead five minutes yet! Bo comes to her and she tells him that she really needs to see John. Just one more time. He brings her to the office and tells her that she should read some of John's files, and read about the cases that he worked on if she wants to feel John again. Eve arrives and gets the bad news about her son. She looks at her engagement rings and she and Marcie agree that Natalie deserves to know what it is that John was planning for her. He tells her that she doesn't deserve a one-night stand and that the sex the night before isn't going to happen again. She takes his rejection well, and dresses. He walks her to the door, wearing nothing but a towel, and pecks her on the cheek. Trouble is that Jessica is in the hallway and sees them. Natalie comes across Spencer in the station as he is being questioned. \"You did this! You bastard! You are the reason that John is dead!\" Nora gets a call for the next of kin for Hugh Hughes. Luckily Paige is standing with her. Hugh was in the same accident that John was, but he wasn't killed. Paige and Nora head over to the hospital where they find Hugh bandaged from head to toe with 2nd and 3rd degree burns. \"How do you want to handle this Paige?\" Nora asks. \"Are you going to tell Spencer?\" The bandaged man clenches and unclenches his fist at the sound of Spencer's name.",
