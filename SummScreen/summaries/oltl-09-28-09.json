Gigi promised to ask her supervisor if she could end her shift early and make the show.\n\n\nGigi was pleased to see Schuyler enter the bar, but soon realized that her friend was troubled.  Schuyler reported that he had been officially banned from teaching in the Llanview Public School system.  A distraught Schuyler insisted that he needed to find another line of work.  Reminding Schuyler that he had already completed several credits toward his biology degree, Gigi suggested that Schuyler consider attending medical school and remain in Llanview.\n\n\nRecalling that his drug problem had led to him dropping out of college, Schuyler stated that his mother would still be alive, had he made better choices.  Pleading with him not to live in the past, Gigi urged Schuyler to finish school and make his mother proud.   After Gigi managed to convince him to continue his studies, Schuyler realized that he needed a job to cover his expenses.  Jeff, Gigi's boss, offered Schuyler a bartending position at Rodi's, but Schuyler declined.  \n\n\nCertain that Rex would object to Schuyler working with Gigi, Schuyler stated that he didn't want to cause any problems between Gigi and Rex.  Encouraging Schuyler to accept the job, Gigi insisted that Rex wouldn't have a problem with Schuyler working at Rodi's.   Schuyler was surprised when Gigi mentioned that Rex had asked her to marry him, and that she had turned him down.  When Schuyler pressed her for answers, Gigi replied, \"It's complicated.\"\n\n\nBack at Ultraviolet, Stacy and Kim tried to scam their way into the concert by informing the bouncer that Stacy was Rex's baby mama.  In an attempt to avoid a disturbance, a humiliated Rex allowed the girls entry.   Once Kim had left them alone, Stacy informed Rex that she had observed him and Gigi at the park earlier.  Stating that Rex appeared miserable at the park, Stacy insisted that Rex's state of mind hadn't changed.  Annoyed by Stacy's interference, Rex replied, \"You imagined it!  Gigi and I are great!\"\n\n\nAfter Rex had stormed off, Kim returned to Stacy's side.  Both Stacy and Kim were certain that Rex's bad mood was a sign that he was experiencing problems with Gigi.   Kim wasn't convinced that Gigi didn't have feelings for Schuyler.  Declaring that Stacy needed to stake her claim on Rex, Kim suggested that Stacy discover the weak spot that existed between Rex and Gigi, and to capitalize on it.    Kim believed that Schuyler might be the answer to Stacy's prayer.  While Stacy focused her attention on Rex, Kim headed off to Rodi's, hoping to spy on Gigi and Schuyler.\n\n\nRex became annoyed when his bartender questioned if Rex was experiencing problems with Gigi. When the bartender inquired about Rex's relationship with Stacy, Rex replied, \"It's complicated.\"  Denying that his relationship with Gigi was in trouble, Rex declared, \"Gigi and I are better than ever!\"  Meanwhile, Stacy watched him intently.\n\n\nWhen Rex spoke harshly of Kim, Stacy questioned why Rex hated her and her friend.  Insisting that Kim was the only person that she could rely on, Stacy stated that it hurt to hear just how much Rex hated her and their baby.  Reminding Rex of his promise to be a part of the baby's life, Stacy commented that she hadn't seen him since her last doctor's appointment.  Realizing that she had hurt Rex's feelings, Stacy apologized and asked Rex if he would keep his promise of being a support system for her.  Stacy wondered if Gigi would have a problem with Rex helping Stacy.  Rex insisted that Gigi would have no problem with his relationship with Stacy, as long as the focus was on the baby.\n\n\nAs Gigi urged Schuyler to accept the job at Rodi's, Kim lurked nearby.  Upon gaining the information that she sought, Kim raced back to Ultraviolet to report her findings to Stacy.\n\n\nBack at Ultraviolet, as Rex walked away, Kim returned and made certain hat Rex overheard her report.  While Rex listened, Kim told Stacy that Gigi had helped Schuyler get a job at Rodi's.   Rex appeared upset by the news.\n\n\nMarkko was pleasantly surprised when Langston paid him a visit at his new apartment.  While Langston was eager to make love, Markko was anxious to complete his film project for school.    Markko stated that he was required to film something that was important to him--that being Langston.  After convincing Langston to participate in his school assignment, Markko videotaped Langston as she went on about her everyday life for a few moments.  Afterward, Markko fiddled with the video camera.  Appearing to turn off his video camera, Markko called out to Langston and said he was done filming.  Tearing each other's clothes off, the two prepared to make love.  Meanwhile the video camera recorded their every move.\n\n\nAt the country club, Todd and T\u00e9a stood at the altar and prepared to recite their wedding vows.  Noticing that Todd continued to look off into the audience, T\u00e9a was convinced that he was looking for Blair.  When Todd admitted that he was curious to know where Blair had disappeared, T\u00e9a ran away, leaving Todd at the altar.  Todd, Viki, and Starr raced after her.  Professing his love for her, Todd begged T\u00e9a to marry him.\n\n\nInside the cabana, Blair ordered Ross to accompany her to the ceremony, so that she could humiliate T\u00e9a and stop the wedding.   Stalling for time, Ross locked himself in the bathroom.  Staring at the check Dorian had presented him, Ross continued to hide from Blair.  Moments later, Ross dragged a screaming Blair from the cabana.\n\n\nAs Todd pleaded with T\u00e9a to reconsider, Blair and Ross spied on them from the bushes.  When T\u00e9a agreed to marry Todd, Blair attempted to call out to them, but Ross covered Blair's mouth and carted her away.  Leading her to a boat just a few feet away from the country club, Ross locked Blair inside the cabin of the boat.  As Blair screamed to be released, Ross sped off far into the ocean.\n\n\nBack at the altar, T\u00e9a related that she had written her own vows, and urged Todd to speak from his heart.  Encouraging him to go first, T\u00e9a exclaimed, \"If you're truthful with me, I'll be truthful with you!\"  As T\u00e9a listened, Todd admitted his true feelings for T\u00e9a.  Declaring that they were meant for each other, Todd stated, \"It's because of you that I am this happy at this very moment!'   To T\u00e9a's surprise, Todd promised to be the man that she deserved.  Moved by Todd's honesty, T\u00e9a kissed him.\n\n\nDesperate to tell Todd the truth about her relationship with Ross, T\u00e9a tried her best to be honest with Todd, but he continued to interrupt her.    T\u00e9a stated, \"After you were honest with me, I owe you honesty!\"  Todd continued to interrupt T\u00e9a's attempted confession.   Looking lovingly at Starr, Jack, and Sam, T\u00e9a began to cry and said that she wanted to be a part of their family.   Realizing that T\u00e9a was in an emotional state, Viki pleaded with Todd to allow T\u00e9a to complete her thoughts, but T\u00e9a stated that she was too overwhelmed and forgot what she had intended to say.   The only words that T\u00e9a could muster were, \"I love you Todd and don't want to lose you!\"  Beaming with joy, Todd insisted that the minister pronounce them man and wife.\n\n\nOnce he had steered the boat into the middle of Llantano Bay, Ross stopped the boat.  Blair demanded that Ross head back to the country club so they could stop the wedding.  Reminding Blair that he was still legally married to T\u00e9a, Ross tried to convince Blair that it didn't matter if Todd and T\u00e9a wed.   While Blair continued to protest, Ross yelled, \"I'm trying to save you from making a fool of yourself. Todd Manning isn't worth it!\"  Removing her clothes, Blair threatened to swim back to shore.  When Blair began to struggle with Ross over the steering wheel, he tossed the keys overboard.  Looking through a set of binoculars, Blair focused in on Todd and T\u00e9a's ceremony.  Realizing that they were exchanging wedding rings, Blair screamed, \"Nooo!\"\n\n\nBlair grabbed Ross's foghorn and began to blow it.  The sound of the foghorn could be heard miles away.\n\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Blair tells Ross that she demands he helps her break up Todd and Tea's wedding, he tells her he has a \"better idea and he takes her out on a boat telling her she needs to get over Todd Manning.

And right after Todd urges her not to go, she is ready to reveal to him that she has a deep dark secret.
