    "soap_central": "\n\nNatalie and Jessica bumped into each other in Angel Square. Before Natalie was able to say anything, Jessica acknowledged that she'd heard the news about Natalie's engagement to Brody. Sarcastically, Jessica asked to see Natalie's ring, and she grabbed Natalie's hand. Jessica thought that the ring was a \"pretty little diamond,\" and she suggested that because of Natalie's hand size, the ring should have been larger.\n\n\nJessica also thought that it would have been a good idea for Natalie to just use Jessica's ring instead. Natalie was apologetic and stated that she just wanted to make things right between the two of them. Jessica wondered how things could be nice and okay after Natalie had stolen Jessica's fianc\u00e9. Natalie disagreed, and she began to explain how Brody had waited for Jessica for months.\n\n\nJessica saw things differently. She believed that Natalie had accepted Brody as a consolation prize, after John had rejected her twice. Jessica figured that Natalie would leave Brody in a second if John were to change his mind. Natalie didn't think that was a fair assessment, and she was angry. She, Brody, and Liam were a family.\n\n\nJessica wondered how it would be around holiday tables, and she stated that the family was not happy with Natalie's choice. Natalie insisted that Viki was happy, but Jessica felt that Viki hadn't had a choice. Jessica accused Natalie of successfully destroying the family just as she'd set out to do when she'd first arrived in Llanview. Natalie couldn't believe that Jessica had held onto that thought after so many years.\n\n\nNatalie accused Jessica of walking all over her, and Natalie would no longer stand for it. Jessica called her \"trailer trash\" who had slept with her sister's fianc\u00e9. Natalie pointed out that at least she hadn't hidden behind her mental illness, and she accused Jessica of enjoying being Tess in order to torture Brody. Jessica had been able to order him around and be a bitch, Natalie added.\n\n\nThe argument continued to escalate. Jessica called Natalie trash again, and she shouted that she wished they'd never found out that Natalie had really been a Buchanan. They had all been happy before Natalie's arrival. Natalie reminded Jessica that she was actually more family than Jessica was. Natalie's real father was Clint, while Jessica's father was Mitch Laurence.\n\n\nJessica was appalled, and she snapped that Clint was her father in every way. She had always been Clint's daughter. \"Your father is a deranged psycho killer that killed my husband when you didn't finish the job yourself,\" Natalie accused. Jessica retorted that she hadn't been responsible for the fact that Mitch had killed lots of people. Natalie added that she had forgiven Jessica for her wrongs, but Jessica had been unable to return the favor.\n\n\n\"Brody is lucky to be rid of you,\" Natalie growled. \"You are Mitch Laurence's psycho daughter and always will be,\" she concluded. Jessica slugged Natalie in the face with all of the strength she could muster. Natalie grabbed her head and then slapped Jessica as hard as she could. The growing argument had turned physical, and the girls grabbed and pulled at each other until they fell to the ground.\n\n\nBrody was determined that Clint give his blessing to Natalie for her engagement, and he paid Clint a visit at Llanfair. Clint advised Brody that he had no intentions of changing his mind. Brody indicated that he refused to accept that, and he wouldn't leave the premises until he received the blessing. Clint was angry, and he advised Brody that Brody had taken things too far.\n\n\nClint reminded Brody that Jessica had loved Brody, and Brody had proceeded to tear two sisters apart. Brody had his own recollections. Brody had waited for Jessica for quite some time. He'd thought that he could handle Jessica's illness, but it hadn't worked out. Clint accused him of then turning to Natalie, but Brody protested. He and Natalie hadn't meant to fall in love, but they also had a son together. Brody had everything he'd always wanted.\n\n\nClint recalled that Brody had had a son with Jessica, also, but he hadn't been able to love a son who wasn't the same blood. Brody took exception and shouted that he was indeed able to love a child that wasn't his. Clint wondered what Brody meant, and Brody quickly assured him that he loved Bree.\n\n\nClint pointed out that he had left Bree's mother, but Brody retorted that Clint wasn't married to his children's mother either. Brody maintained that he'd had to move on, and he hadn't wanted to hurt Jessica. Clint thought the solution to that should be that Brody shouldn't marry Natalie.\n\n\nNatalie was determined that she wouldn't sacrifice herself for Jessica again, and she would marry Brody no matter what Jessica thought, Brody explained. He wondered if Clint cared about Natalie as much as Jessica. If he did, then he had to make Natalie aware of it, Brody advised. Brody was afraid that Natalie might even want to move away.\n\n\nBrody extended his hand to Clint, and reluctantly, Clint grabbed it. It didn't mean he was happy about things, but he wanted peace, Clint maintained. He expected Brody to make Natalie happy. Brody agreed with all that Clint said, and he acknowledged that they'd made a start towards a common goal. \"I hope so,\" Clint said.\n\n\nAfter Mr. Heller read Victor's will to the assembled family members, everyone was in shock. All of Victor's possessions had been left to Irene. T\u00e9a and Dani jumped up from their seats. Tina asked that the will be read again, while Jack wondered how Irene could obtain everything after all she'd done. \"Good question,\" Blair said to her son.\n\n\nViki didn't think the reading had been right. \"There is no way that Victor wrote that voluntarily,\" Viki accused. Irene claimed that she had been as surprised as everyone else. \"Obviously, this is your dirty work,\" Viki declared. Viki was certain that Victor would have provided for his children. Irene thought it was all very touching, but the rest of the family was certain that the will had to be fake.\n\n\nT\u00e9a grabbed the papers in order to read them over. Blair felt that Victor wouldn't have had a right to any of the holdings, because he hadn't been Todd. T\u00e9a noted that Blair had had it legally declared in 2003 that Victor had really been Todd. Irene announced that none of that really mattered anyway, as Victor Sr. had originally left his empire to his male heir, and the name hadn't even been mentioned.\n\n\nTina wondered where her share might be. Irene advised Tina that her brothers hadn't thought highly of Tina, so they wouldn't have left her anything. \"There's no way they would have left it to you. You bitch,\" Blair spat at Irene. \"You'll be sorry you called me that,\" Irene responded. She allowed herself to touch the gun that was hidden in her purse.\n\n\n\"Did you just threaten me?\" Blair inquired. Irene backed down. She called Blair's name-calling hurtful and without just cause. Irene was upset at having just lost her son. Viki accused Irene of using Victor his entire life, and Tina wondered if the entire thing was a scam. T\u00e9a declared that her first move would be to contest the will, and Viki advised Irene that Irene would not be able to manipulate all of them.\n\n\nIrene made it known that she had been the only one who had understood and loved Victor. Everyone snickered, as Irene continued. Victor had wanted to take care of his mother, and the other women could provide for their children on their own, Irene said. Tina spoke up. She wanted Irene to be aware that there were other people present. T\u00e9a wanted to make certain that Dani received what she was entitled to. \"Be careful what you wish for,\" Irene pronounced.\n\n\nMr. Heller announced that he wanted to hand everything over to Irene right away. He held a portfolio that contained all references to Victor's holdings. Irene pointed out that Victor had made his wishes quite clear, but T\u00e9a was adamant that she be able to contest the will. Blair couldn't believe that Mr. Heller was giving the portfolio to Irene, but the banker declared that he didn't have a choice.\n\n\n\"Is there anything you need help with, Mom?\" Tina asked Irene in a faint voice. The others grumbled their disbelief as Tina made her position clear. Irene had another announcement. Everything belonged to her, including the house they were in. She ordered T\u00e9a and Dani to pack their things and leave that evening.\n\n\nT\u00e9a announced her intent to file an injunction, as she had no plans of leaving the house. Irene announced that Jack was the only one who could stay there. She was aware that Victor had been teaching his son the business, and Irene wanted Jack to run the Sun. Also, Todd had ended up in jail thanks to Jack.\n\n\nWithout warning, Blair hauled off and slapped Irene. \"Stay away from my son,\" Blair ordered. Blair acknowledged that they wanted nothing to do with Irene. Tina ran and retrieved a cold cloth for her mother. \"Are you all right, Mom?\" Tina asked. The other family members gagged. Tina pointed out that everyone did things they later regretted, and she'd missed and needed her mother.\n\n\nBlair thought that Tina was shameless, but Tina called Blair unfeeling. Tina wondered why both of her brothers had married Blair. Irene was sorry for the trouble her absence had caused Tina, and Tina suggested that Irene make it up to her. Family was important to her, and she wanted something to remember Victor by, Tina declared. Irene looked through the portfolio and handed Tina a ring, with the letter L embossed on the front.\n\n\nThe ring had belonged to Victor Sr. \"Is it worth anything?\" Tina inquired. Irene pointed out that while it might retrieve a few hundred dollars, it had sentimental worth, and that was important. \"Tina, you're rich,\" Blair taunted. \"That's a special, special gift...You must feel so loved,\" Blair mocked. Tina was speechless.\n\n\nIrene didn't want to be everyone's enemy, and Viki suggested that she give her son's family what they deserved. Irene agreed, and she advised T\u00e9a and Dani that they could remain in the house for the night. They would have to leave the next morning. Irene also wanted to be friends with Viki again. \"Hell will freeze over first,\" Viki said as she sneered.\n\n\nIrene picked up her portfolio and headed to the door. She stopped at Jack first. \"So like your father,\" she said to him. She advised him she'd be in touch. After she was gone, Jack whined to his mother. He didn't want to be anywhere near that \"nut job.\" Blair assured him he wouldn't have to be.\n\n\nTina wanted to get her ring appraised, and T\u00e9a began her phone calls. Dani received a frantic call from Destiny, and T\u00e9a advised her daughter that it was okay to leave. T\u00e9a had plenty of people around to turn to. Outside, a hidden Irene watched Dani leave, and then she turned to a newly arrived associate. He announced that he had what Irene had ordered. Irene muttered that Todd had to realize that there would be consequences.\n\n\nBack inside the house, Tina continued to grumble over the ring she had been given. Viki wondered if everyone was supposed to feel sorry for Tina, but Tina exclaimed that Viki had no idea what it was like to be on her own. Viki retorted that Tina didn't know a thing about loyalty, and she ripped into Tina for not disclosing that she'd been aware that Jessica was really Tess.\n\n\nViki hollered that her daughter had done lots of damage to loved ones, including Natalie. Tina claimed that she hadn't had a choice, and she'd made a mistake. She was certain that Viki's daughters had kissed and made up. Viki accused Tina of never wanting to be sisters. Tina had only wanted to use Viki, Viki accused. Tina cried that Viki had no idea what her life had been like. \"That was your choice, Viki,\" Tina charged.\n\n\nOutside, Irene set up an explosive. \"Pretty soon, money will be no problem for Todd's family. Shame to lose the house though,\" she said to her associate. Irene was happy that there would be no one left to fight her for Victor's money.\n\n\nStarr visited with Todd in jail. He advised his daughter that she would have to \"bust me out of jail.\" He was firm that the cops would be of no use. Todd was the only one who would be able to take care of the family, or everyone would be killed. He had no clue about the location of the microchip that Irene believed him to possess, and he was certain that Irene also had the evidence he needed in order to be set free.\n\n\nStarr suggested that she could arrange to have everyone move away until things were settled, but Todd didn't think that would work. He believed that Irene was already having the family watched. He called Starr a genius, and he was certain that Starr could figure something out. \"Starr. Please. Daddy needs your help getting out of jail,\" Todd begged. Starr thought a moment. \"Okay. Let's do this,\" she replied. Todd beamed proudly.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes, Todd asked Starr about her plan. \"I got nothing,\" he advised her. Starr wasn't sure yet. \"Could you think faster?\" he urged. Starr finally fixated on a plan, and she tossed lots of medical terms at her father. Todd was confused, and he inquired whether his daughter had planned on being a doctor. She clarified that she wanted to be a singer. Todd suggested a singing doctor, and annoyed, Starr ordered him to focus.\n\n\nStarr explained that she had described a heart attack to him, and she wanted Todd to pretend that he was having one. As Todd began to protest, she doused him with water from her water bottle. She wanted him to look as though he had been sweating. Todd wasn't thrilled, and he declared that heart attacks happened to \"old guys.\"\n\n\nTodd took his place on the floor, and Starr began to shout for help. She grew hysterical, and the guard finally arrived. He believed that Todd was faking, but Starr pleaded with him not to let her father die. Another guard arrived. Starr called out for someone to perform CPR, but suddenly she grabbed the gun from one of the guard's holsters. She pointed it at both men.\n\n\nThe guards assumed that it had been Todd's plan, but Starr corrected them gruffly. \"It was my idea. Nobody move,\" she shouted. The guards raised their hands. Todd made a weak attempt to stop Starr, but she was giving orders. \"Take the radios and gag them,\" Starr instructed. Todd praised his daughter and told her how well she'd done. He thought she was a genius.\n\n\nTodd took the remaining guns and began to rip up the sheets. He noted that he had to find the microchip and kill his mother. He admitted that he hadn't been comfortable when Starr had waved the gun around, and she admitted that she hadn't been comfortable either. Starr tossed the guns into another cell. Todd exclaimed that they needed the guns for when he met up with his mother, but it was too late. He advised his daughter that he would be her biggest fan when she turned into a singing doctor.\n\n\nBrody left Clint and happened to find Jessica and Natalie fighting in Angel Square. He pulled the young women apart, and he picked Natalie up. He carried her away from the scene as Jessica screamed after them. \"I hate you. I'm gonna hate you 'til the day that you die,\" she yelled.\n\n\nClint sat in his wheelchair with his back to the door. He heard someone enter, and he turned around. \"Oh, dear God. I can't believe it's you,\" he proclaimed.\n\n\nBlair, Viki, and T\u00e9a began to strategize, but they were interrupted when Starr and Todd arrived. They were confused, because Todd had been behind bars. Starr told them it had been an emergency. Todd learned that Irene had been there, and he was concerned. \"I was worried, but you're okay. You're all okay,\" he declared.\n\n\n",
