    "soap_central": "\nThe Golden Hour\n\n\nUp on Llantano Mountain, Bo and a S.W.A.T. team from the Llanview Police Department aimed their weapons at a delusional Brody. While Rex, Gigi, and Shane watched in horror, Brody refused to surrender and fired a shot in their direction. Bo and his men surrounded Brody. \n\n\nUpon realizing that she and Shane were covered in blood, Gigi panicked. She discovered that both she and Shane were fine, but flew into hysterics when she determined that Rex had been shot. Gigi screamed as she ran to aid an unconscious Rex. Shane ran towards Brody, who had been placed in police custody. As the officers prevented Shane from making contact with Brody, the child demanded to see his father. With a blank stare, Brody continued to mumble, \"I had to shoot him.\" \n\n\nUpon hearing Gigi's screams, Bo ran to Rex's aid. As Bo tended to Rex's wound as best he could, Bo demanded to know what was taking the bus so long to arrive on Llantano Mountain. An officer informed Bo that the bus driver was having a difficult time because the road was extremely narrow. A terrified Gigi tried to help care for Rex, but Bo was concerned about the extreme bleeding. He feared that Rex might bleed to death or go into shock. Bo promised Rex that he wouldn't die on his watch. When Bo instructed his officers to take Brody to jail, Shane yelled at the authorities to release his father. Barely glancing in Rex's direction, Shane insisted that the shooting was accidental. \n\n\nIn her jail cell, Dorian demanded to be released. Addie paid her sister a visit. Dorian begged Addie to help her prevent Ray from taking Langston away. Informing Dorian that Ray had agreed to allow Langston to spend her final night in Llanview at La Boulaie, Addie complimented her sister on her bravery, and stated that she would have acted in the same manner. Addie's words comforted Dorian. \n\n\nUnaware of the incident, Dorian teased Brody when he was placed in the cell adjacent to hers. A despondent Brody continued to mumble to himself. He repeated, \"I did what I had to do. I followed the code.\" Brody had a vision of the ten-year-old boy that he had killed in the war. The child pointed a gun at Brody. Brody wept. \n\n\nUpon learning that Brody had shot Rex, Dorian appeared concerned. Dorian asked Addie to keep her updated on his condition, and gave her permission to contact Adriana. Reminding Dorian that she was a strong woman, Addie urged Dorian to continue to fight for Langston. Addie promised to come through for Dorian, the same way Dorian had done for her for so many years. Dorian thought about how badly both her girls needed her. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr and Markko offered Langston their support. Stating that she had caused the recent change of events by wishing for a relationship with her unknown relatives, Langston had no idea how she would adjust to life in Colombia. Refusing to allow their friend to blame herself, Starr and Markko promised to stand by Langston. The teens wondered who was actually responsible for Ray's arrival in Llanview. Starr wished that she knew someone who could take care of Ray. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Cole witnessed the handshake between Clint and Ray. After sending Ray on his way, Clint prepared to cover his tracks with Cole. When Cole confronted Clint about his association with Ray, Clint tried to assure Cole that he had the wrong idea, but Cole was unconvinced. Citing that Langston was his friend and that she was hurting because of Clint's interference, Cole accused Clint of using Langston to get his revenge on Dorian. Cornered, Clint defended his actions by placing blame on Dorian. Unmoved by Clint's defense, Cole informed him that he planned to tell Dorian about Clint's scheme. Placing a hand on Cole's shoulder, Clint warned Cole that he might want to reconsider. \n\n\nDenying any involvement with Langston's uncle, Clint pressured Cole to keep quiet about his suspicions. In disgust, Cole left the mansion. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Markko announced that he was staying overnight. He vowed to remain by Langston's side until her uncle came for her. Starr was convinced that they had the entire night to come up with a plan to keep Langston in Llanview. Langston believed only a miracle could help her. \n\n\nRay entered the mansion and asked Clint if Cole was aware of their plan. In a confident tone, Clint said that it didn't matter. Clint stated that Ray was taking Langston back to Colombia and no one could prevent it. \n\n\nCole arrived at La Boulaie. He informed his friends that Clint had brought Ray to Llanview to take Langston away from Dorian. Langston, Starr, and Markko were stunned by the news. \n\n\nA concerned Michael dropped by Marcie's apartment to check on her head injury. Michael had questions for Marcie and wanted to know how she had sustained the injury. In an attempt to keep Gigi's secret about Shane's paternity, Marcie gave Mike vague answers about how she was injured. \n\n\nAlthough Marcie insisted that she felt fine, Mike was adamant about tending to her wounds. As Mike lovingly placed his hand on her head, Marcie turned away. The couple obviously enjoyed each other's company, but neither would state that fact. When Mike placed a bandage on Marcie's cut, the two leaned in to kiss one another but the buzz from Mike's pager interrupted them. Looking at his pager, Mike told Marcie that there was an emergency at the hospital and he had to leave. \n\n\nAlone at the apartment, Marcie assembled a baby crib. Marcie told herself that she would be able to raise her child alone. Marcie sang a lullaby to her unborn child and promised that they would be a family. \n\n\nAccompanied by Gigi, Bo, and Shane, a badly injured Rex arrived at Llanview Hospital. As Rex was wheeled into an examination room, Shane pressured Gigi for answers concerning Brody's whereabouts. A distraught Gigi screamed that Brody was exactly where he should be. Before Gigi could chastise Shane any further, Mike approached and was surprised to find Gigi and Bo. Upon learning that Rex had been shot, Mike questioned another doctor about the extent of his injuries. \n\n\nWhile Gigi and Bo listened, the doctor gave Mike the grave news. The doctor stated that Rex was hemorrhaging and needed immediate surgery. The doctor told Mike that they needed to hurry because the \"golden hour\" had passed. Fearful of the doctor's words, Gigi questioned Bo about the term. When Bo told her that time was running out for Rex, a look of panic crossed Gigi's face. Consumed with thoughts of only Brody, Shane stood in the background. \n\n\nIn the emergency room, the doctors struggled to find the source of the bleeding. Mike begged Rex to hold on. \n\n\nIn the waiting area, Bo tried to console Gigi, and a frustrated Shane banged his fist against a gurney. Fed up with Gigi's concern for Rex, Shane demanded to know when he could see his dad. In a state of shock, Gigi told Shane that he couldn't see his father because he was in terrible shape. When Shane agreed that his father was in a terrible condition because he was in jail, Gigi realized that Shane was referring to Brody. Aware of the misunderstanding, Bo excused himself to check on Rex's condition. Alone with his mother, Shane continued to ask for Brody. Unwilling to listen to anymore of Shane's pleas for Brody, an angered Gigi screamed at the child to stop asking for Brody because she was concerned about Rex. In disbelief, Shane told Gigi that she didn't care about his father, and stormed off. \n\n\nAs Gigi tried to run after Shane, Bo approached and suggested that she allow the child some time to calm down. Gigi told Bo that he didn't understand the circumstances. She was surprised when Bo revealed that he knew that Rex was Shane's father. In tears, Gigi told Bo that she couldn't lose Rex. Bo assured her that neither he nor Gigi would lose Rex. \n\n\nShane listened as Mike told Gigi and Bo that Rex's condition was bad. He had lost a great deal of blood and could possibly lose his spleen. Mike feared that Rex had suffered brain damage. Mike explained the procedure that would be performed on Rex, but was unsure of his chances for survival. As Mike left to prep Rex for surgery, Gigi cried in Bo's arms. \n\n\nBefore Rex was wheeled into the operating room, Mike allowed Gigi and Bo a few moments with him. Bo recalled Rex's ability to get out of tough jams. He pleaded with Rex to fight for his life. Gigi promised Rex that he would survive the operation and come back to her. After Rex was wheeled into surgery, Bo assured Gigi that Rex would be fine. Flustered, Gigi stated that she needed to find someone to look after Shane. Gigi panicked when she turned around and realized that Shane was gone.\n\n\n",
