    "soap_central": "\nEndless Love Boat\n\n\nBlair was stranded on a boat with Ross and forced to watch Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding through a set of high-powered binoculars.  She was furious that Ross had prevented her from stopping the wedding.  Blair scoured the boat for something that might help her to return to shore before Todd and T\u00e9a's ceremony concluded, but her search didn't yield anything useful.   Meanwhile, Ross discovered a bottle of alcohol, which he invited Blair to share with him.\n\n\nBlair promised Ross a miserable death if he didn't help her to stop the wedding.  Ross seemed unconcerned by Blair's threats as he leaned back and then took a few swigs from the bottle.  Blair returned to watching Todd and T\u00e9a wedding through the binoculars, chanting to herself, \"Todd don't do it.\"  When she saw them exchange rings, Blair made a final last-ditch effort to stop the wedding by blasting a foghorn while screaming at the top of her lungs.  The loud noise echoed throughout Llanview.\n\n\nAfter Blair ran out of breath, she slumped down in dejection.  She was livid that her moment to ruin T\u00e9a had slipped through her fingers.  Blair blamed Ross; in her rage she snatched up a spear gun and then aimed it directly at Ross.  For the first time, Ross appeared nervous.  He pleaded with Blair to put the gun down, but Blair was blinded by her anger.  She fired off a spear, but missed her target, much to Ross's relief.\n\n\nBlair decided that she would track down Todd as soon as she returned to shore.  She was determined that Todd would learn the truth about his new bride.  Ross warned Blair that Todd would not appreciate Blair for making him look like a chump.  He was brutally honest with Blair as he insisted that Todd did not love her.  Blair didn't care; according to her, she didn't want Todd.  She claimed that she simply didn't want T\u00e9a to be a part of her children's lives.\n\n\nRoss didn't believe a word out of Blair's mouth.  He questioned what kind of mother would hesitate to act on damaging information if she truly believed that it could hurt her children.  Blair realized that Ross saw through her lie; she reluctantly admitted that she had feelings for Todd.  Ross ruthlessly reminded Blair that Todd did not return those feelings.  Blair shifted the focus to Ross.  She demanded to know why Ross had suddenly backed out of their agreement.\n\n\nRoss recalled the check that Dorian had given him, but he did not tell Blair about it.  Instead, Ross claimed that he had changed his mind about ruining T\u00e9a's wedding once he had seen how happy she was with Todd.  Blair didn't believe Ross; she was certain that he was hiding something.  However, she wasn't in a position to do anything about it on the boat, so she decided to bide her time.  When Ross offered her the bottle of booze, Blair accepted.\n\n\nA loud obnoxious noise interrupted Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding.  Jack wondered what it was; according to him, it sounded like a dying unicorn.  Todd compared the sound to a cat being strangled.   It was actually Blair and her foghorn.  Once the annoying noise stopped, Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding resumed.  Moments later, Todd and T\u00e9a were pronounced husband and wife for the third time.  Afterwards, Jack offered his father and T\u00e9a a toast.  He forgot the speech that he had prepared, but he congratulated his father on not messing things up.  Jack also admitted that he thought T\u00e9a was good for Todd.\n\n\nAs the guests mingled, Viki thanked Charlie for attending the wedding with her.  Viki realized that she had quite a bit of personal baggage, including Todd, whom she compared to a steamer trunk, but she appreciated Charlie's support.  Charlie reminded Viki that he would rather be with her than anywhere else.  When he spotted the bride, Charlie noticed how happy T\u00e9a looked.  He hoped that her secret wouldn't destroy what she had with Todd.\n\n\nLater, T\u00e9a pulled Viki aside to thank her for agreeing to be her matron of honor.  Viki confessed that she'd been flattered by the offer.  However, it was clear that Viki was concerned about the impact that T\u00e9a's secret would have on T\u00e9a's newfound happiness.  T\u00e9a revealed that she intended to tell Todd the truth after their wedding night.\n\n\nTodd took a moment to speak to Starr.  Starr was preoccupied because she was worried about Blair.  Todd assured Starr that Blair was fine.  He suspected that Blair was off somewhere licking her wounds.  A short time later, Starr tried to call her mother.  Her concern grew when the call went to Blair's voicemail.\n\n\nCris and Layla talked about Todd and T\u00e9a's marriage.  Layla was surprised when Cris expressed doubt that the marriage would last.  He explained that Todd's pattern was to turn on T\u00e9a at the first sign of trouble.  Cris didn't have any reason to suspect that things were different.  Layla admitted that she was a firm believer that people could change.  She hoped everything would work out for Todd and T\u00e9a.\n\n\nWhen the reception ended, Cris offered to take Layla home.  Layla didn't want the night to end, so she suggested that they attend Lionel Richie's concert at Ultraviolet.\n\n\nTodd ushered T\u00e9a to a cabana that had been transformed into a honeymoon paradise.  Todd seemed eager to start their new life, confident that there weren't any ugly secrets to mar their bliss.  T\u00e9a smiled, but said little.  Moments later, she went to slip out of her wedding dress.  Todd was struck by T\u00e9a's beauty when she emerged from the bathroom a short time later wearing a stunning negligee.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Markko and Langston glowed in the aftermath of making love.  Both were unaware that the camera had recorded everything.  After a few minutes of cuddling, Markko and Langston began to kiss.  However, the mood was ruined when Langston heard a radio announcer offer four tickets to Lionel Richie's concert at Ultraviolet.  To win, a caller had to know what Lionel Richie song had been featured in the movie \"Election.\"\n\n\nLangston knew that the answer was \"Three Times a Lady,\" so she called in.  Langston was thrilled when she won the tickets.  In her excitement, she threw herself into Markko's arms.  Things quickly became heated, but before they could go too far, Cole and Starr walked in.  Markko and Langston were mortified.\n\n\nMarkko and Langston quickly got dressed.  When Markko returned to the living room, Cole suggested that the next time that Markko and Langston wanted to be intimate, they should use the bedroom.  Markko didn't argue.  Moments later, Starr revealed that Langston had extra tickets to the Lionel Richie concert, so she had offered them to Starr and Cole.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Schuyler noticed that Gigi was dressed up.  Gigi explained that she intended to meet Rex at Ultraviolet for Lionel Richie's concert with Jeremih.  Before she left, Gigi confided that she intended to tell Rex about Schuyler's new job at Rodi's.  Schuyler hoped that Rex wouldn't be upset by the news.\n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, Kim and Stacy informed Rex that Schuyler had been hired as a bartender at Rodi's.  Rex immediately saw through their ploy.  He wondered if they ever intended to stop making trouble.  Stacy and Kim pretended that they had no idea what Rex was talking about.   A short time later, Gigi arrived at the bar.  Kim and Stacy listened intently as Rex asked Gigi if Schuyler had been hired at Rodi's.\n\n\nKim smiled victoriously when Gigi appeared surprised.  Kim decided that the time was perfect for her to head to Rodi's to ask Schuyler to go out on a date with her.  Stacy remained perched in the booth, watching the scene between Gigi and Rex unfold.\n\n\nGigi was curious how Rex had heard about Schuyler's new job, while Rex was more interested in knowing why Gigi hadn't told him about it.  Gigi explained that Brody had quit his job earlier that day.  Schuyler happened to be at Rodi's at the right time.  Gigi admitted that she had encouraged Schuyler to take the job because he had learned that he would not be able to return to teaching.  Schuyler needed a job in order to put himself through medical school.\n\n\nRex admitted that if he had known, he would have offered Schuyler a job at Ultraviolet.  Gigi was surprised until Rex confessed that he would have preferred that Schuyler not work with Gigi.  She revealed that Schuyler had been reluctant to accept the job at Rodi's because he was worried that it might put a strain on her relationship with Rex.  Gigi wondered if it would pose a problem.  Rex made it clear that he trusted Gigi.\n\n\nRex acknowledged that he didn't have any room to complain, given his situation with Stacy.  He was honest that he wasn't happy about Gigi working with Schuyler.  Rex freely admitted that he wished Gigi would turn to him with all of her problems instead of confiding in Schuyler.  However, Rex was determined that he wasn't going to let Schuyler's new job become an issue.\n\n\nKim arrived at Rodi's and then promptly planted herself in a seat at the bar where Schuyler was working.  She immediately struck up a conversation with him and eventually asked him out on a date.  Schuyler was flattered, but he turned down her invitation.  Kim wasn't easily discouraged.  She switched tactics to confess that she had always had a thing for him, even back in Las Vegas when he had been dating Stacy.\n\n\nSchuyler was stunned by the admission; however, he remained undeterred.  He didn't want to hurt Stacy by going out with Kim.  Kim assured Schuyler that Stacy wouldn't mind.  According to Kim, Stacy would want Schuyler to move on instead of pining away for Gigi.  Schuyler made it clear that he and Gigi were just friends.  Kim smiled brightly as she pointed out that there wasn't any reason for Schuyler not to go out with her.\n\n\nLater, Rex introduced Grammy award winning singer Lionel Richie to the crowd in Ultraviolet.  Everyone cheered as Lionel Richie and Jeremih took to the stage to perform.\n\n\nThis episode featured \"Just Go,\" by Lionel Richie, featuring Jeremih.\n\n\n",
