Shane replied that nothing was wrong, and that he liked it in Angel Square, because he could think. Rex urged Shane to talk to him, and informed him that, if they couldn't talk, Gigi would say it was \"trouble waiting to happen.\" Shane thought back to hitting Jack, and pointing a gun at him, and answered, \"Jack Manning.\"\n\n\nRex had thought that Jack hadn't been causing Shane any problems, and Shane confirmed it. However, Shane believed that Jack had lied about Todd shooting Victor, because Jack lied about everything. Rex assured his son that no one got away with something like that forever. Shane related that everyone believed Jack, but Rex reminded Shane that it thankfully had nothing to do with him.\n\n\n Rex wondered why Shane liked Angel Square. Shane replied that the angel statue reminded Shane of Gigi. Shane admitted that he sometimes talked to Gigi, and imagined that she spoke back to him. Rex confessed that he heard Gigi, and saw her as well. Shane didn't believe his father, but Rex insisted that Gigi had been trying to send Rex a message. He showed Shane the check from the diner. Shane recognized that \"DON'T GIVE UP\" was written in Gigi's handwriting, but couldn't believe it.\n\n\nShane suggested that Gigi wanted justice for what had happened to her, but Rex didn't think so. Rex assured Shane that Gigi was watching over them, and thought it was a good thing. He put his arm around Shane, and they left for home.\n\n\nBo was on the phone with Nora on his way to the police department's holding cells. When he arrived, he told Nora that he'd have to call her back. He went into Todd's cell and found two officers cuffed and gagged. He untied the gags, and demanded to know what had happened. One officer implicated Starr in the escape, and Bo couldn't believe it.\n\n\nA short while later, Bo had uncuffed the officers. He warned them to get ready for an Internal Affairs investigation. Another officer entered, and Bo told him to put out an APB on Todd and Starr.\n\n\nAs David Vickers sniffed around the paper on which Natalie's paternity test results were printed, Tina frantically searched the house for the dog. When he barked, Tina finally found him sitting on T\u00e9a's bed, on top of the paper. She begged him to get off of the paper, because the grieving T\u00e9a \"doesn't deserve dog spit all over her legal papers.\" She told the dog about her bad day, and complained about only getting the ring. Later, she took the dog downstairs, and scolded him.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wondered why Todd wasn't in jail. He only babbled on that he had needed to get out, because Irene had threatened the lives of all of his loved ones. Outside, the bomb read \"53:00.\" Todd explained about the note he'd received from Irene, and about the microchip he didn't remember possessing. Blair wondered how the cops had gone along with Todd getting out of jail. \"I kind of busted him out,\" Starr reluctantly confessed, and Todd smiled lovingly at her.\n\n\nTodd tried to illustrate how worried he had been, but Blair could only focus on the fact that Starr would probably face jail time for breaking Todd out of prison. Jack entered the room, and stopped dead when he saw Todd. \"Why is this murderer in my father's house?\" Jack demanded to know. He told Todd to leave, or he would make Todd leave. Starr angrily pushed Jack into a chair, and told him that Todd had gotten out of jail to protect his family.\n\n\nStarr yelled that Todd wouldn't have even been in jail if Jack hadn't lied to the police. Jack tried to defend his story, but Todd insisted that he hadn't even been at the scene of the crime that night. Blair wondered why Todd hadn't just shown the note to the cops. Starr admitted that Irene had used disappearing ink. \"How'd you get out? An invisible cloak?\" Jack cracked. Blair wondered if Starr had taken Todd's word for it without seeing the note. \"Yes,\" Starr simply stated. Blair asked T\u00e9a how much trouble Starr would be in. \"A lot,\" T\u00e9a replied.\n\n\nJack taunted that he'd been asked to be more like Starr, but Starr had \"screwed up\" so badly that she was facing jail time. \"You mean, like you did?\" Starr shot back. She yelled that Jack hadn't had to pay for the crime he'd committed, even though Shane's mother had died. Blair stopped the argument, and wondered how Todd could have used Starr like that. Starr insisted that she'd made her own decision to help her father, and she'd do it again.\n\n\nJust then, Tina entered, surprised to see Todd. Annoyed, he wondered why Tina was there. She wanted to know how he'd gotten out of jail after killing Victor. He revealed that he hadn't done it, and that Irene was setting him up. \"So is Jack,\" Starr added. Tina revealed that she was there to claim her rightful inheritance, but she'd only gotten the ring. Todd looked at the ring, and remembered putting the microchip inside of it. He announced that he remembered, and grabbed the ring on Tina's hand.\n\n\nTodd and Tina fought over the ring, until Viki ordered Tina to give the ring to Todd. She begrudgingly obeyed. Todd had to go give Irene the ring, but T\u00e9a didn't want it to look like he was running away. Everyone tried to convince him to stay, but he walked out of the house anyway.\n\n\nJack slipped out of the room, and outside. He called the Llanview Police Department, and told the officer that he knew where Todd was. As he gave the address, the bomb hit forty minutes remaining on the timer. Jack reentered the house and found David Vickers whining in Tina's bag. He took the dog outside, and said he'd wait for the cops while the dog did its business.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Clint couldn't believe that Cord was standing in front of him. Cord happily related that it would take more than a transplant to take Clint down, but he wished that he'd been there during the transplant. Clint asked about London, and Cord told his father that he was there because Buchanan Enterprises was in \"serious trouble.\" He relayed to his father that BE was going downhill thanks to Rex.\n\n\nClint tried to explain to Cord about the tough time Rex had been having. Cord related that he and Kevin had tried to help Rex, but Rex had been too stubborn to listen. Cord spat that Clint had told him that Rex was a thief, and a con man. Clint stopped Cord and said, \"That's enough! Leave my son alone!\" He told Cord that he had to accept Rex as his brother. Just then, Bo entered, ecstatic to see Cord. Noticing the tense atmosphere, Bo wondered if things were all right between the men.\n\n\nCord mentioned that it had to do with BE, and Clint asked why Bo was there. Bo told them about Todd's escape from jail, and explained that he was looking for the fugitive. Clint knew that Viki wouldn't hide Todd at Llanfair. Just then, Bo's phone rang, and he told the caller that he was on his way. He told Clint and Cord that Starr had helped Todd to escape, but Jack had turned Todd in. He left, and Cord related how their family had issues as well.\n\n\nTina couldn't believe that Viki had made her give the ring back. T\u00e9a suggested that Viki and Tina leave before the cops showed up, because the fewer that appeared to know about Todd, the better. Tina had nowhere to go, but Viki refused to put her sister up at Llanfair. After Tina begged, Viki finally broke down. Tina related that she'd known that Viki couldn't have held a grudge forever. \"Wanna bet?\" Viki said, and left.\n\n\nAs the bomb got down to twenty-four minutes, Jack played fetch with David Vickers, and wondered where the cops were. Viki and Tina walked out, and Jack wondered if Todd were still in the house. As Jack entered the house, Blair told him that Todd had left, and Jack was livid. Blair told him to stop obsessing over Todd, because they had to figure out what to do about Starr. Blair wanted to talk to T\u00e9a in private, so T\u00e9a opened the door. As the bomb hit the nineteen-minute mark, Bo grimly stood in the doorway.\n\n\nCord apologized for badmouthing Rex, because he was grateful that Rex had given Clint's life back. Clint implored Cord to reach out to Rex again. Cord understood how Rex felt losing someone he loved. Just then, Cord was shocked when Viki and Tina entered the room.\n\n\nTodd arrived at the docks, calling for Irene. He yelled that he had what she wanted, so she needed to \"end this nonsense once and for all.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cord Roberts, Clint's oldest son, makes a surprise visit. Little does he know that his ex, Tina, has come back for the reading of Victor's will. Cord tells his father they must not let Rex Balsam ruin their company and is very surprised to hear Clint defending Rex and recognizing him as his son. Shane indicates to his dad that he has some sort of \"secret\" involving Jack Manning that nobody else knows. And we see a \"flashback\" of Shane knocking Jack out in the rain outside Victor's home and getting a hold of a gun. Yet that's all we know. Starr returns to the house with original Todd and everybody is horrified to see that she's helped him bust out of jail although they both protest that she had to do it because Irene threatened to kill them all. Todd finally recognizes the mysterious microchip when he sees the ring that Tina apparently got from their mutual mom and he goes to meet Irene at the docks.",
