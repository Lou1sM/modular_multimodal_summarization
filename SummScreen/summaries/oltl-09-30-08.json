Langston didn't want to believe \"Uncle Ray\" would be involved with Clint's schemes, but Markko and Starr were delighted that they finally had something they could use against Ray. Cole questioned whether Ray was even Langston's real uncle. Langston reminded them of Ray's proof of identity and family keepsakes, but Markko questioned whether Ray's credentials could have been faked. Cole said that regardless of Ray's identity, there was still no explanation as to how Ray had known about Dorian's last-minute custody hearing in time to file an injunction, unless someone in the courthouse had been in Clint's pocket. The teens all agreed that Dorian could put a stop to Clint and Ray's plans, and resolved to head to the police station to see her immediately. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Gigi freaked out when she realized Shane was once again missing. Bo assured her that he'd find the boy, and urged her to stay with Rex and keep giving him moral support. Gigi reluctantly agreed, and attempted to question a nurse about Rex's condition, but got no information, as she was not \"immediate family.\" Left alone to worry, Gigi fervently said a Hail Mary. \n\n\nAt the police station, Shane wandered in and approached the desk sergeant, asking to see \"Lieutenant Lovett.\" Before Shane could persuade the sergeant to let him into the cellblock, a phalanx of reporters descended upon the front desk, anxious to get information on the Llantano Mountain shooting. As the sergeant attempted to manage the crowd, Shane slipped away, and snuck into the cellblock alone. After Shane disappeared, Bo arrived on the scene, shooing the reporters away. When he learned that a child matching Shane's description had been spotted on the scene, he chewed out the desk sergeant and hustled away to intercept Shane. \n\n\nDown in the cells, Brody continued to lose his grip on reality as his hallucinatory visions haunted him. The Iraqi boy he'd killed paced outside his cell as Brody sobbed, saying over and over again that he was sorry. As Shane approached Brody's cell, he didn't realize that Brody wasn't talking to him. He told his \"dad\" that he was fine, and asked him why he was sorry. Brody lashed out, grabbing at \"the dead boy\" while really clutching at Shane's lapels, hissing at him to \"leave me alone\" and stop tormenting him. Frightened and confused, Shane tried to make Brody see sense, and cried that it was him, \"I'm your son!\" \"You're not my son!\" Brody howled, sinking to his knees. Seemingly lucid, Brody sobbed for Shane to leave him alone, as Bo came up behind Shane and tried to comfort the upset boy. \n\n\nBo took Shane back upstairs, and promised him that Brody would be fine; he said Brody was \"confused\" due to trauma from the war, and would be tended to by special doctors. Bo then called a relieved Gigi and told her he was bringing Shane back to the hospital. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tess cuddled with Bree in her bedroom as she read \"Goodnight Moon\" to her daughter. In the basement, Natalie looked in on the tender moment on the closed-circuit television. Becoming emotional, Tess told Bree that \"Daddy\" was watching over them, and promised that they would have a wonderful life together with the new baby, even if Nash couldn't be there with them. In a choked voice, Tess said she wished Nash could be there, and told Bree that it was Aunt Natalie's fault he wasn't. Tess told Bree to wave goodnight to her father and Aunt Natalie, beckoning to the secret cameras. In the hallway, Jared passed by and overheard Tess's final words, and burst in asking for an explanation. \n\n\nTess covered in front of Jared, and said that she and Bree said goodnight to everyone they loved, regardless of whether they were there or not. As Tess put Bree to bed, Natalie watched and prayed for Jared to see through Tess's lies. When Tess returned to her bedroom, Jared asked her if she'd heard from Natalie. \"No,\" Tess replied, \"and frankly, it pisses me off.\" Tess tried to turn Jared against Natalie as she \"vented\" about her frustrations with her sister. She said Natalie hadn't had enough courage to face the family's crisis and Jessica's loss at Jared's side, choosing to instead leave him in the lurch. Tess told Jared that Natalie was \"blowing you off,\" and reluctantly admitted that it made her wonder: \"If she really did love you, why did she leave?\" Jared tried to stick up for Natalie, but Tess wasn't having any of it. \"She treats you like garbage and she calls it love,\" Tess shot back. She said she wasn't surprised, reflecting on Natalie's dysfunctional childhood and upbringing; Tess claimed that Natalie had no concept of real love, which was why all of her previous relationships had failed. \"Enough!\" Jared snapped, losing his patience. \"Shut your damn mouth.\" \n\n\nJared told \"Jessica\" he could understand what she was going through, but that he wouldn't hear her put down Natalie anymore, and accused \"Jess\" of using her grief to drive Natalie away. Tess played innocent and calmed her rhetoric, but said she couldn't help feeling as she did. Jared apologized for blowing up, but as Natalie fumed downstairs, Tess fawned over the wounded Jared, suffering without the love of his life--just like Jessica. Tess said that without Bree in her arms, she felt lost, and asked Jared not to leave, saying she didn't want to be alone. Feeling awkward, Jared turned on Jessica's television. Tess and Jared were shocked to hear the local news report about Rex's shooting, which a horrified Natalie also overheard on the closed-circuit T.V. Jared wanted to call Natalie immediately, then realized he couldn't. \n\n\nTess headed into the basement and confronted Natalie in the secret room, where a tearful Natalie begged Tess to free her and let her go see Rex. Tess gleefully refused, and fantasized about how disgusted the family would be at Natalie's refusal to support her loved ones in their time of need. Tess said that was who \"the real Natalie\" was: Selfish and self-absorbed, just like she'd been when she'd chosen Jared over Buchanan Enterprises, and destroyed not only the company, but the love of Tess's life. With that, Tess left Natalie to sob. Natalie watched helplessly as Tess returned to Jared's side and hugged him, claiming to be worried about Rex. As Jared left Llanfair to head for the hospital, Tess gloated about Natalie's pain and taunted her through the cameras. \"You know,\" she said, \"you just can't plan torture like this.\" \n\n\nAt the police station, the teens arrived and harangued the desk sergeant, pleading with him to let them in to see Dorian. Langston and Cole were desperate to warn Dorian about Clint's treachery, but the sergeant insisted that visiting hours were coming to an end and they would have to come back the next day. Defeated, the teens headed back to La Boulaie, but not before Starr thanked Cole for saving the day on Langston's behalf. Cole said he hadn't done it just for Langston -- \"I did it for you.\" \n\n\nIn the cellblock, Dorian screamed for bottled water, but got none. What she did get was a requested visitor: local crime figure, Jackie McNaughton, an old acquaintance of Viki, Ben, and R.J. Gannon. Jackie said he'd come at Addie's insistence, and added, \"Your sister Addie's got brass ones.\" \"I never noticed,\" Dorian replied. She told Jackie she needed his help getting her out of jail as soon as possible, and railed about Ray, claiming that \"a deviant\" wanted to whisk her foster daughter away to Colombia. Jackie told Dorian that a contempt citing was no big deal and she'd be out the next day, but Dorian said that a day would be too late. Dorian scowled that according to the Llanview courts, \"blood trumps love,\" and said she would do whatever it took to protect her daughter from \"a criminal.\" After a lot of hemming and hawing, Dorian told Jackie that she'd requested him because she was hoping for a \"more permanent solution\" to the problem of Ray Montez--and that she wanted it done that night. Jackie warned Dorian not to enter into such a discussion lightly, and insisted she take the night to sleep on it and get back to him. Jackie called for a guard and left Dorian to brood alone in her cell. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, the teens plotted their next move. The boys wanted to confront Clint and Ray, but Langston said they would do nothing without talking to Dorian first. The others were deflated about their failure, but Langston was upbeat. She told her friends that because of their ingenuity and quick thinking, she had hope. Langston, Starr, and Markko linked hands, and as Cole joined their circle, Langston declared that \"the Fantastic Four\" were back, at least for one night. Gazing at Starr, Cole said they were back for good. \n\n\nIn Brody's cell, the delusional soldier watched as both the Iraqi child and Shane appeared before his eyes, then disappeared, leaving only his service revolver on the ground outside the bars. \n\n\nBo brought Shane back to the hospital, where Gigi embraced her truant son. \"I just wanted to be with my Dad,\" Shane said sullenly. As Bo left to check on Rex, Gigi tried to explain to Shane what had happened with Brody, and recounted what he had done to the cottage and how Marcie had been hurt. Shane snapped that all Gigi cared about was Rex, and said he wanted to go back to his father. Frustrated, Gigi finally told her son the truth: \"Brody is not your father.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cole goes to inform Langston, Marco and Starr of the conversation he overheard between Ray Montez and Clint Buchanan. Clint revealed to him that he has a \"war\" with Dorian Lord since she took his company from him. And he bets that that is why Ray showed up out of nowhere and the judge awarded him custody of Langston so that Dorian will never see her again. And they are all determined to get to the bottom of it. Rex is in critical condition. Gigi and Bo are worried about him and notice that Shane has wondered off. Shane goes to find Brody who's been taken to jail. Brody is traumatized remembering the young boy whom he shot. Gigi finally reveals to Shane that Brody is not his real father. Rex is. Meanwhile, Tess \"works\" on Jared to make him believe that Natalie has bailed on her family and dumped him. And he deserves better. Yet he still does not believe that Natalie would do that to him. And when they all hear that Rex is in critical condition, Tess uses that against Natalie. She realizes that when people find out that Natalie has done nothing and not even shown up to be there for her brother who could be dying, they'll all see what a worthless, selfish person Natalie is. Natalie is distraught and horrified that she cannot see Rex and is locked in the room where Tess has kept her.",
