    "soap_central": "\nThe Blair Essentials\n\n\nSomewhere in Llantano Bay, Blair awoke hungover and alone on the commandeered boat.  As she searched the deck for Ross, she failed to notice Dorian's check in his coat pocket.  Suddenly, Ross crawled aboard soaking wet; he'd gone for a morning swim.  Blair was still furious at him for foiling her scheme, and desperate to return to shore.  Sighting a passing boat, Blair screamed for help.\n\n\nRoss told her that no one could hear them, and Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding was over.  He urged her to give up her mission and move on.  Blair wondered why he was sticking up for the newlyweds all of a sudden.  Ross said he knew a \"no-win situation\" when he saw one, and said it was time for her to let go, move on, and stop humiliating herself.\n\n\nBlair asked Ross why he cared what happened to her.  \"Because I like you,\" Ross said mischievously.  Blair told Ross that they weren't friends; they had common goals and once those were reached, they'd be done with each other.\n\n\nRoss was dismayed that his camaraderie wasn't mutual, but gave Blair a pleasant surprise: The keys to the boat.  He explained that he'd found them while diving.  Overjoyed, Blair ordered him to start the engines.  Ross took the wheel, but warned Blair that whatever happened when they got back to land was up to her.\n\n\nAt the country club, Todd and T\u00e9a greeted the morning in their honeymoon cabana amidst a tangle of arms, legs, and sheets.  T\u00e9a was satisfied and happy to be with her new husband, but told him she couldn't be \"Mrs. Manning.\"  Before Todd could get the wrong idea, T\u00e9a clarified by saying that she would be keeping her maiden name; she refused to share the same name Blair had once used.  Todd agreed, and told her that he was glad they'd gotten everything out in the open.  He said he didn't even mind the years she'd spent with Ross after the island.\n\n\nThe mention of her past made T\u00e9a freeze up.  Todd didn't notice her uneasiness, and continued to sing the praises of once again being a married man.  He reminded T\u00e9a that she could no longer testify against him in court, and T\u00e9a countered that she couldn't defend him anymore, either.  Todd said that wouldn't be necessary, as \"you married a saint!\"  He promised he'd be on his best behavior, and urged T\u00e9a to trust him.\n\n\nT\u00e9a grew melancholy and said she wanted to trust him; she wanted to feel safe, as though she could tell him anything.  Todd promised her that she could.  Anxious to change the subject, T\u00e9a needled him about looking for Blair during the ceremony.  Todd insisted that he hadn't been looking for Blair, while T\u00e9a muttered that she had nothing to prove to her rival.  \"Enough about Blair,\" Todd said, grabbing T\u00e9a for another round of lovemaking.\n\n\nFrom the Buchanan mansion, Clint called John at the police station and asked him for an update on the stalker case.  As he examined his file on Jared on his computer, John said he was working on it and hoped to have news soon.\n\n\nAfter he finished his call to John, Clint greeted Nora and asked about her appeal in Matthew's case.  Nora hoped to have a ruling soon.  She told Clint that after what had happened to Shaun, the judge would have to look twice at Greg Evans, who'd almost killed his own brother.  Matthew wheeled into the room, having overheard the conversation.  He accused Nora of using the tragedy with Shaun to prevent his surgery.\n\n\nNora told Matthew that she didn't want what had happened to Shaun to happen to him.  Matthew said the cases were totally different, and he trusted Greg's ability.  Clint chimed in by saying that Asa would be proud of Matthew's fighting spirit, but wouldn't want the family torn apart.  He said that if he'd known flying Greg into town would hurt Bo, Nora, and Matthew the way it had, he'd never have done it.\n\n\nMatthew said he didn't know what Asa would have thought of his choices.  Seizing on Matthew's doubts, Nora reminded him that Shaun had wanted a risky operation just as he did.  She told him that the Evans family could just as easily be her, Bo, and Rachel, sitting in a waiting room, praying for a miracle for Matthew instead of Shaun.  Hesitant, Matthew told them he had to see Greg.  After Matthew left, Nora embraced Clint, and thanked him for his support.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jared and Brody were chafing under \"house arrest,\" courtesy of Natalie and Jessica, who refused to let them exert themselves during their recoveries.  Jessica stopped Brody at the door as he tried to escape to the gym, and said he wouldn't be going anywhere until his stitches were taken out.  In the living room, Natalie told Jared he wasn't going anywhere until she said so.  Jared was turned on by her take-charge attitude, and kissed her passionately.\n\n\nAs Natalie and Jessica headed for the kitchen to make breakfast, Jared answered a call on his phone.  He spoke in hushed tones, and warned the person on the other end never to call him at home.  Brody entered the living room just as Jared finished his call.  Jared covered his tracks by claiming that it had been someone from Buchanan Enterprises.  Brody was unconvinced.\n\n\nJessica returned with breakfast on a tray. She teased the men about fortifying themselves in case of another run-in with trouble.  Jared played down his assault, and said he'd just been a victim, not a hero like Brody.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Natalie answered the door to find John, who said he had some more questions.  Natalie bristled, but John assured her that he wanted to question everyone, not just Jared.  Natalie led John into the living room, where John asked the couples to recount the stalking incidents for him from the beginning.  Jessica explained what had happened at the lodge the night before Clint and Nora's wedding, and mentioned that she'd had another incident, a false alarm, where she'd found David's producer, Ford, on the patio outside Llanfair.\n\n\nAs Jessica reviewed the chain of events, Jared looked increasingly uncomfortable.  John asked about each of the foursome's whereabouts during the incidents.  He noted that Jared was with Charlie on both the night before and the morning of the double wedding, calling Jared's father his alibi.  Natalie blew up, accusing John of railroading Jared.  John said he had no choice but to ask his questions.\n\n\nAs the argument continued, Jared's phone began to vibrate again, unnoticed by the others; he ignored it.  Natalie told John that Jared couldn't have been the stalker, and Jessica agreed.  John said he only wanted to figure out why Jared was the one who'd been assaulted at Buchanan Enterprises.  He thanked the family for their time, and told them to enjoy their breakfast.  Irate, Natalie warned him to call the next time he wanted to pay them a visit.\n\n\nAs John left, Brody followed him into the foyer, claiming he wanted to talk about the drug bust.  Once they were alone, Brody informed John that Jared had been asking questions about the case, and had just taken a suspicious-sounding call on his phone.  John said he couldn't get access to Jared's phone records without a warrant and just cause.  Brody said he'd try to get his hands on the phone.  \"Watch your back,\" John cautioned.\n\n\nIn the living room, Natalie was still upset about John's focus on Jared.  Jared defended the detective, and said John had no choice but to ask the tough questions.  As he hugged her, his phone vibrated yet again.\n\n\nAt the police station, David burst into Bo's office with a gift: A DVD set containing all the footage from David's failed reality show.  Bo was less than touched, and refused the memento.  David assured his father he'd want to see the footage.  Bo reluctantly loaded one of the discs into his computer, and watched as David's hidden camera at the Buchanan mansion showed Matthew and Destiny discussing the lawsuit during the trial.  Frustrated, Matthew told Destiny that he was prepared to tell the judge that Bo and Nora did not have his best interests at heart, and had kissed the night before she'd married Clint.\n\n\nStoic, Bo told David that his filming the kids without their knowledge was an invasion of privacy.  Noticing that Bo was not denying the kiss with Nora, David crowed, \"I knew it!\"  Bo asked if David intended to blackmail him with the footage, so David wouldn't go to Clint.  David said he wouldn't, mostly because he hadn't been able to make any copies.  He promised Bo that Clint would never see the footage on the disc.\n\n\nClint and Nora entered the office while David was speaking.  Clint demanded to know what he would never see.  Thinking fast, David claimed he'd agreed to keep Clint's \"star turn\" in reality television out of the public eye for fear of shaming the family.  He said he knew the Buchanan motto was \"family first.\"  Nora found David's devotion hard to swallow, since he'd helped fracture the family bonds by footing Matthew's legal bills.\n\n\nNora asked Bo for news about their appeal, but Bo had none.  She told him she thought Matthew might be wavering on the operation.  David encouraged Bo and Nora to admire Matthew's strength, and suggested that Bo could be proud of both his sons for doing what was right.  \"Isn't there a housewife that's desperate for you somewhere?\" Nora snapped.  David quickly exited, but not before handing the trio \"Dorian Lord for mayor\" buttons and loudly promising never to use the embarrassing family footage against them.\n\n\nAs Clint slammed the office door in David's face, John walked back into the lobby.  Having overheard David's comments about embarrassing footage of Clint and Jessica, John asked David about his DVD, and the incident with Jessica and Ford.  David said he'd be willing to part with the second disc for a fee, but John grabbed it and told David to get lost.  Moaning about John's lack of respect, David left.\n\n\nInside the office, Bo, Clint, and Nora tossed their \"Dorian for mayor\" buttons in the trash.  Clint kissed Nora goodbye as he left for Buchanan Enterprises.  Alone again, Bo and Nora reviewed the footage of Matthew and Destiny.  Nora was shocked that David had left the scandal alone, and suggested that Bo was rubbing off on his son.  Bo looked pained as she wrote their kiss off as a moment of weakness and bad judgment.\n\n\nBo smashed the disc and tossed it into the trash.  Nora mused that Matthew hadn't needed to use the information he'd had on them to win his case.  She warned Bo that Matthew was on his way to the hospital to see Greg, and could have already scheduled his surgery.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Destiny sat at Shaun's bedside, playing his favorite music and teasing him about his looks and the medal he'd won for bravery.  Greg walked in, and Destiny explained that she'd been hoping to get Shaun mad in order to wake him from his coma.  Greg told his little sister that the only person Shaun had reason to be angry with was Greg.  Destiny apologized for lashing out at Greg before, and said he was still the best doctor in the world.  She told him he'd prove that again once he helped Matthew.\n\n\nGreg wasn't so sure he could help Matthew.  He told Destiny that he couldn't be her hero anymore.  Destiny said her brothers would always be her heroes, and reassured Greg that Shaun would wake up soon.\n\n\nAfter Destiny left, Greg began to read to Shaun from one of his favorite detective novels.  The story was about a man killed by his \"two-timing\" brother, murdered over a woman.  \"It was a clear case of fratricide,\" Greg said aloud as he glanced at Shaun, stricken with guilt.\n\n\nIn the corridor, Destiny ran into Matthew.  Matthew asked if she was okay, and Destiny said she was better for having seen him.  She said she needed friends around, with the rest of her family distracted.  She was sure that Greg could still save Shaun, and Matthew, as well.\n\n\nMatthew grumbled that his parents were still nagging him, second-guessing him about his surgery.  Destiny asked if he was having second thoughts himself.  Before Matthew could answer, Greg emerged from Shaun's room.  Matthew asked Greg when they could schedule his operation.  Morose, Greg told Matthew he wouldn't be operating on him.\n\n\nBlair and Ross arrived outside Todd and T\u00e9a's honeymoon cabana.  As Blair prepared to bust up the newlyweds, she heard T\u00e9a's giddy laughter from inside.  Blair stopped dead, horrified.  A waiter wheeled a room service cart towards the cabana, and asked Blair and Ross if they were the Mannings.  \"I'm not Mrs. Manning,\" Blair mumbled, deflated. \"Not anymore.\"\n\n\nThe waiter knocked on the cabana door.  Still wrestling with T\u00e9a, Todd yelled at him to leave the food and go.  As the waiter left, Ross began poking around the room service cart, while Blair seethed.  Ross asked her what she wanted to do.  \"Take me home,\" she said softly, and let Ross usher her away.\n\n\nInside the cabana, T\u00e9a got dressed, ready for breakfast.  She stepped outside and found the room service cart unattended.  Then, she discovered the crumpled check on the ground, where it had fallen from Ross's coat.  As she spotted the name \"Ross Rayburn,\" T\u00e9a grew stricken.  When Todd called out to her, T\u00e9a grabbed the breakfast cart and returned to the cabana.\n\n\nAt the station, John watched David's DVD, examining the footage of Jessica's run-in with Ford on the patio outside Llanfair.  As Ford and his camera dashed through the bushes, John caught sight of someone else standing unnoticed beside the French doors.  He zoomed in on the image, revealing a mysterious man lurking on the periphery.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Brody spotted Jared's phone.  Before he could examine it, Jared pocketed it and told Brody he was going to take a shower.  Anxious, he hurried upstairs and dialed a number.\n\n\nIn the living room, Brody was lost in thought as Jessica comforted an agitated Natalie.  Jessica reminded Natalie that for Jared to be the stalker, he would have had to be in two places at once.\n\n\nJust then, the mysterious man from David's DVD appeared on the patio, watching Brody and the girls.  He answered his phone; Jared was on the other end.  Jared told the man that he couldn't have spoken to him while he was with the others.  \"I've got them in my sights,\" the stalker said, gazing at Jessica and Natalie. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Ross tries to convince Blair to get over Todd and leave him and Tea alone. He takes her back to shore and they go to the cabana at the country club where Tea and Todd are honeymooning so Blair can ruin it. Blair changes her mind at the last minute and decides to leave. Ross drops the check that Dorian gave him. When Tea comes to the door to get the breakfast that room service brought, she sees the check on the ground. David gives Bo a copy of the footage from his reality TV show that reveals Matthew and Destiny talking about Matthew seeing his parents kissing the night before his mother married his uncle. Bo later shows it to Nora. They are both glad that Matthew didn't use that information to undermine their credibility in court. Clint and Nora try to convince Matthew to change his mind about having the surgery in light of their loss of confidence in Dr Evans after his mistake that caused his brother to become comatose. Matthew protests that he knows the risks and this isn't even the same kind of surgery that Shaun had. Matthew goes to the hospital to find Dr Evans and ask how soon he can have the surgery. Dr Evans informs him that he will not perform the surgery. Someone keeps calling Jared and he doesn't answer the phone. John and Brody both find that odd and suspect that Jared is involved with the stalker. While John is questioning everyone about what they were doing when the stalker struck, he finds it unusual that Jared was with his father on every occasion. Natalie thinks it is ridiculous that John is accusing Jared. Finally, Jared goes upstairs alone and calls the person back. That person is a blond man who is out on the terrace at Llanfair watching Jessica and Jared. David gives John another copy of his reality TV show footage. John watches the clip of Jessica coming out on the terrace thinking she has seen Nash. When he zooms in on the bush by the door, he sees a man hiding there. It is the same man that Jared is talking to on the telephone.",
