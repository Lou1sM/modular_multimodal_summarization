Greg was offended and asked why he'd lie, but Destiny said that still wasn't an answer. He apologized if it wasn't what she wanted to hear. Just then, Nate stepped off the elevator and asked if the judge had made a decision yet. Greg said they should go in the courtroom because Dani would need them, and he left.\n\n\nInside the courtroom, the judge returned. She explained that she thought it was in Dani's best interest to be in Ross's custody. Furious, Blair insisted that T\u00e9a had wanted Dani with Todd. Todd related that the judge had made the wrong decision. The judge told Todd to say his goodbyes and that her decision was effective immediately. Destiny and Nate entered the courtroom just in time to hear the decision.\n\n\nRoss threatened to fight it if the judge granted visitation rights to Todd. The judge wanted to know why. Ross brought out a tape recorder and hit play. It was a recording of when Todd was threatening to shoot Ross. Dani was horrified, and Todd claimed that it was out of context. Todd tried to tell Dani that he would do anything for her, but the judge ordered everyone to sit down. She gave Ross permission to take Dani out of the country as soon as he wanted to.\n\n\nThe judge ordered Dani to go home with Todd and a police escort to go pack her things and say her goodbyes. An upset Dani ran to Nate and wondered how they could make her leave. An equally upset Nate promised her that he would fix things, kissed her, and left. Destiny blamed the judge's decision on her brother. Dani wished Nate was there and wondered why he'd left. Destiny knew he wouldn't have left without a good reason.\n\n\nTodd fired his lawyer and vowed to find a way to get Dani back. As Ross took Dani's hand and told her everything would be all right, Todd pushed Ross away from her. With the help of a cop, Blair ushered Todd, Dani, and Destiny out of the courthouse.\n\n\nIn his apartment, James flipped through a textbook. Not wanting to look at it, he threw it over his shoulder toward the door just as Ford walked through. Ford was depressed about not getting the job at the camera shop. James filled Ford in on Nate's problems with his car and then Dani, but Ford thought his and James's problems mattered more than Nate's \"love life.\"\n\n\nJames told Ford about Nate's suggestion to wait tables at the country club. He said that Nate had offered to put in a good word for Ford. James had to go study for a quiz, but advised his brother to stop letting his ego get in the way and take Nate up on his offer.\n\n\nFord entered the country club and told the manager that an employee had told him there was a job opening. The manager asked if he was Nate's brother and said that Nate had spoken very highly of Ford. Since Ford had no experience, the manager started him out as a busboy, much to Ford's chagrin. However, he promised that Ford would move up quickly if he worked hard, and started him on the spot.\n\n\nAt the country club, Clint and Inez toasted to \"another fine evening.\" Clint told Inez that he wanted to talk about her son. She began to talk about James, but Clint wanted to talk about Ford. Inez explained how he had loved teaching and that she didn't believe the accusations against him. Clint thought there was unnecessary pressure to fire Ford because the student involved with him was the daughter of the mayor. Clint offered to help get Ford reinstated.\n\n\nInez appreciated it, but refused because Ford didn't want any kind of help from her. She told Clint that he was a busy man and he shouldn't waste his time. He wondered why she was fighting. Inez wondered how long he would keep doing things for her without expecting something in return. She didn't understand why he would give so much help to people that he barely knew. He explained that he was a rich man with a lot of power, and it was no fun unless he got to utilize his power. All he wanted in return was her company.\n\n\nInez said she'd think about it. Ready to order, Clint called a waiter over. Ford walked over to the table and was as shocked as his mother. Ford said he had just started and that Nate had put in a good word for him. He left to get a waiter, since he wasn't allowed to take orders yet. Clint wondered if Ford's career change was a good fit. Inez couldn't stand seeing Ford so unhappy and accepted Clint's offer for help.\n\n\nIn a classroom at Llanview University, the dean talked to Langston and Starr. She said that the school would review its fraternization policy to make sure it would never happen again. She explained that the incident was on Ford's record and that he would never teach again. As the dean was about to leave, Langston called her back, but only thanked her. Starr wondered if Langston was going to tell the dean that Ford was innocent, but Langston said she wasn't.\n\n\nLangston filled Starr in about running into Markko, only to find out that Starr and Cole knew about Markko's father having surgery. Starr said the guys were supposed to go out later that night and that she needed a breather anyway. Starr updated Langston about Hannah staying with Marty and about how Cole had admitted that he had feelings for Hannah. She had also admitted that she had feelings for James. However, they were just going to forget about James and Hannah. Langston wasn't so sure Starr could do that.\n\n\nStarr said it would work, and the two walked out of the classroom. Starr literally bumped into James in the hallway. After an awkward moment, James told her that he had gotten the grant and was back in school. In unison, both said that they'd better go, and James walked away. Langston sarcastically commended Starr on her effort to forget about James as Starr's phone rang. She answered it to Blair, who informed her about Dani. Starr's face changed and Langston asked what had happened. \"My sister...\" was all Starr could say.\n\n\nBack at his apartment, James resumed flipping through his textbook when there was a knock at the door. He answered it to Nate, who said that he badly needed James's help.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, John and Natalie wondered why Greg would testify in favor of Ross because he didn't seem like a typical accomplice. John suggested that Eli was threatening Greg. John and Natalie decided that they needed someone who had been around T\u00e9a right before she died to contradict Greg's story. John took out his phone to call the hospice.\n\n\nAt the hospice, Eli yelled at the aide that they couldn't hold him against his will and that he needed his doctor. The aide said that it was doctor's orders, and that Greg was considered the best in his field. She was sure Greg would check in soon. Eli said that if Greg didn't check in by the end of the day, Eli was going to leave. Another aide entered the room and said there was a call for the aide working with Eli. She said it was \"a detective from the States\" calling about a former patient. Eli looked panic-stricken.\n\n\nOn the phone, John asked the aide if she'd had any contact with T\u00e9a before T\u00e9a died. He wanted to know if T\u00e9a had ever mentioned her will, or arrangements she wanted made for her daughter. The aide explained that T\u00e9a had been heavily sedated, and she hadn't spent much time with the patient, anyway, because Greg had taken over most of the duties involving T\u00e9a. She said that it wasn't typical, but he'd seemed to have a strong personal interest in T\u00e9a. The last time she'd seen Greg was a few days before.\n\n\nJohn got off the phone and updated Natalie. Natalie asked why Greg had been back to the hospice after T\u00e9a's death. John said that was what they needed to find out. He wanted Greg at the station for questioning.\n\n\nLater, John got off the phone, and Natalie asked if John was having someone pick Greg up at the Palace. John said that Greg wasn't at the Palace because he had already \"hopped a plane\" back to the hospice.\n\n\nThe aide returned to Eli's room, and Eli apologized to her for being so rude. She left, and Eli received a text message from Ross saying that he had won custody of Dani. Eli said that it wouldn't be long, which Greg walked into the room and heard. \"For what?\" Greg asked. \"Until I get what's coming to me,\" Eli replied. Greg couldn't agree more. Eli explained that he had just heard from Ross, and thanked Greg for his \"expert testimony.\" All Eli needed was a clean bill of health, but Greg refused, saying that there was \"no way in hell\" Eli could leave. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Robert and James are both struggling to make ends meet now that Robert is unemployed. He goes out looking for jobs that underpay and that he feels are beneath him while giving up on fighting for his professor job at LU. While Clint is having dinner with Inez, he tells her he can pull strings with LU to get Robert a film director job regardless of the trouble he got into as a professor. She does not want to continue to accept favors from Clint and knows that Robert would not want a \"favor\" this way. But then, James and Nate tell Robert that maybe he should take a job that Nate referred him to waiting tables. Robert reveals to the manager he has no restaurant experience so he has to start out bussing tables. The first customers he has are Inez and Clint. At that point, it looks like Inez might reconsider Clint's offer. Starr and Langston talk about Starr's dilemma with her feelings for James and how Langston regrets losing Markko. In the courtroom, the judge rules in Ross's favor with no proof that the will where Tea named him as Dani's legal guardian has been falsified. Dani is torn between her two fathers. Unknown to anybody, Tea is in a private hospital, alive and getting better but completely unaware of what Greg has done. Greg is still afraid of Ross and Eli's threats to his family if he does not do what they want, but he's determined to prevent Eli from returning to Llanview and getting away with what he did.",
