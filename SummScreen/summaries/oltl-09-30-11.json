Inside of the estate, Blair declared that she would take Starr home and opened the door to Bo, who announced that he was looking for Todd Manning.  Bo revealed that Jack had call \"9-1-1\" and reported Todd's escape.  T\u00e9a revealed that Todd had found what Irene Manning had been looking for and then had run out of the house to give it to her.\n\n\nBo called in to the police station and reported Todd's escape and then asked to talk about Starr's part in it.  When T\u00e9a asked if Bo had any evidence of Starr's participation, Bo claimed that two cops had witnessed Starr's part in the escape.  Starr explained that Irene had threatened to hurt her family, but Jack insisted that Irene had been at the house for the reading of Victor's will.  Jack was shocked that Starr had believed Todd, and Jack felt that Starr would follow Todd's orders like a little puppy.\n\n\nAs David Vickers scratched on the door and barked, Jack exclaimed that Todd had made everything up and then revealed to Bo that Starr had said that Irene's note had been written with disappearing ink.  After Starr explained to Bo what had been written on the note, Bo declared that Starr had not done Todd any favors by breaking him out of jail.  David Vickers barked at the bomb, as Bo arrested Starr.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Blair insisted on escorting Starr to the police station, and Blair demanded that Jack return home.  When Jack opened the door, he wondered why Tina had not taken her crazy dog with her.  Jack closed the door after he walked out.  T\u00e9a, Starr, Blair, and Bo opened the door to David Vickers and felt that she was trying to tell them something.  Bo followed David Vickers and found the bomb.\n\n\nOn the docks, Todd searched for Irene, and she stepped out.  When Todd announced that he had found what Irene wanted, she questioned why Todd's memory had suddenly returned.  Todd answered, \"What can I say?  Being locked up, drugged, and tortured for eight years kinda did a number on my head...thanks to you.\"  When Irene mentioned that Todd blaming his mommy for his troubles was convenient, Todd said that he might have gotten his memory back sooner, if her goons had not been lighting him up like a Christmas tree.\n\n\nAfter Todd announced that the microchip was in Victor Lord's ring, Irene laughed and said that Victor Jr. had kept it in his possession all of that time, and that Irene had even held it in her hand before she had given it to Tina.  Todd admitted that he had needed to wrestle the ring away from Tina and exclaimed that it was a good thing that he still had his teeth.  Todd held up the ring.\n\n\nTodd demanded proof that he had not killed Victor, and Irene pulled out a gun.  Todd insisted that Irene give him the gun first, and then he would return the ring to Irene, but then he realized that it was not the gun that he had given Louie.  Irene revealed that Louie and the gun were both at the bottom of the river.  Irene cheered that Todd would take the fall for Victor's murder, and that Irene would enjoy everything else Victor had owned without Todd's or anyone else's interference.\n\n\nIrene demanded to have the ring, and Todd yelled, \"You sick, disgusting mother.\"  Todd screamed that Irene had kept him from his family for eight years and had put his brother in his place.  Todd added that Irene had killed Louie, who had saved Todd's life.  Todd noted that Louie was a stranger, who had saved him, while Irene was Todd's mother, who was trying to kill him.\n\n\nWhen Todd threw the ring into the river, Irene howled and pointed the gun at him.  Irene yelled, \"You son of a bitch,\" and Todd observed, \"Well said.\"  Irene cried that all of her bargaining power was in the microchip, and that the information on the microchip was all she had, and Todd responded, \"That and your sunny disposition.\"  After Irene wailed that it was a disaster, Todd noted, \"It's really awful when bad things happen to good people.\"  When Irene said, \"You can say that again.\" Todd did just that, so she shot him.\n\n\nTodd rolled over, as he held his wound, and commented, \"So much for my tennis career,\" and Irene admitted that her aim had been off.  Irene informed Todd that the microchip had been the only thing keeping Todd alive, and that she would finish the job.  When Todd told Irene to ask herself one question, Irene asked, while she pointed the gun, \"Do you feel lucky?\"\n\n\nTodd speculated if Todd Manning would really throw his last bargaining chip into the river, and Irene replied, \"Yes, because Todd Manning is a rash, selfish imbecile, who never thinks before he acts...are these trick questions?\"  As Todd noted that he might have been lying, they heard a loud boom.  Irene smiled and said, \"That, my son, was the sound of your family dying.\"\n\n\nIn the living room at Llanfair, Cord said to Clint that there were some people that you could never get over, as Tina walked into the room.  When Tina ran up and tried to hug Cord, he stopped her.  Cord could not believe that Tina could act like nothing had ever happened and used the Mendora jewels as an example.  When Tina tried to explain her way of out that, Cord noted that Tina would do anything, hurt anyone, or steamroll her way over anyone if they stood in her path to money.  Clint and Viki left the room to give Cord and Tina a chance to talk alone.\n\n\nThe first thing Cord wanted to discuss was how Tina's greed had almost gotten their daughter killed.  Tina insisted that Carlo Hesser had blamed her for the death of his son, but that she would gladly have traded the jewels for their daughter, Sarah.  Tina pointed out that Cain had stopped her, and that David Vickers had actually gotten Tina and Cain together, however, Cord did not want to hear about the romance between Cain Rogan and Tina.\n\n\nWhen Tina insisted that she needed to find David Vickers, Cord was outraged that Tina was back with David Vickers, although he had thought that David was with Dorian.  Tina revealed that it was not that David Vickers, but Cord did not want to hear any more of Tina's lies.  Tina declared that David Vickers was her dog, and that the name had suited the dog, until he, or rather she, had given birth to a litter of puppies.  Tina picked up the doggy bag and found that David Vickers was gone.  When Tina feared that David Vickers had been kidnapped, Cord said that they would look for him -- her.\n\n\nIn the kitchen, Jessica reached for a bag of ice to place on her black eye and bruised cheek.  She remembered her argument with Natalie, and that Natalie had yelled that Clint was not Jessica's father -- Mitch Laurence was.  Jessica felt that she must be crazy, because she was Mitch's psycho daughter, and that she always would be.  Jessica threw the bag of ice against the wall, as Clint and Viki walked in.\n\n\nViki was concerned over Jessica's injury, but Jessica just brushed it off.  Jessica sarcastically snipped that Natalie and Brody were engaged, which was the only thing that was important, and that the rest of the family did not matter.  As Viki started to leave and said that she would talk to Natalie, Jessica admitted that she had also tried to strangle Natalie.  Viki cried, \"Okay, okay, I'm going to go and talk to Natalie, and when I come back, I am going to find a way to heal this family.  I will not have you and Natalie ending up the way Tina and I did.\"\n\n\nAs Clint walked Viki out of Llanfair, he commented that it was convenient that Tina had shown up just in time for the reading of Victor's will.  Viki revealed that Tina had been disappointed, because Victor had left everything to Irene.  Viki worried because she knew that Irene would stop nothing to get what she wanted.\n\n\nClint returned to Jessica in the kitchen and placed the bag of ice on her cheek.  Clint revealed that Brody had visited him in person, and Jessica hoped that Clint had let Brody have it.  However, Clint admitted that he had given Brody and Natalie his blessing to make things better between Natalie and Jessica.  Clint stated that he would do anything to make it better for Jessica.\n\n\nJust as Jessica stated that she knew that Clint was her real father, Tina ran into the room and cried that her David Vickers was missing.  When Tina feared that David Vickers had got locked in the secret room in the basement, Jessica announced that the secret room had been torn down.  Tina ran out crying, \"David Vickers, David Vickers.\"\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Tina returned and asked Cord if he had found David Vickers.  When Cord admitted that he had not located Tina's dog, Tina threw herself into Cord's arms.\n\n\nBrody walked in the apartment with Natalie, who had a wrap around her strained neck.  Natalie informed Brody that Clint had told Jessica that they were engaged.  Brody reentered the room and announced that Liam was sound asleep and then asked how Natalie and Jessica had \"come to blows.\"  Natalie explained the details of the fight between her and Jessica.  Natalie indicated that she had gone out of her way not to throw their engagement in Jessica's face, but that Jessica had insisted that Natalie had ruined her perfect little life.\n\n\nNatalie added that Jessica had kept on, so Natalie had snapped and had said something to Jessica that had hit below the belt.  Natalie insisted that Jessica had pushed her buttons and had said that Natalie was not part of the family.  Brody pointed out that Natalie's family loved Natalie, and Natalie regretted that she had resented Jessica for being the princess and the ballerina.  After Brody related that Natalie had never felt like a ballerina, Natalie insisted that she would not let the conflict stop her from marrying Brody.\n\n\nBrody stressed that he would never want Natalie to lose her family because of him, but Natalie relayed that what Jessica had said had been very hurtful.  Natalie regretted that her father was unable to even give his blessing.  Brody then announced that he had just visited Clint, and Natalie wondered if Clint had given Brody the wrong end of his shotgun.  However, Brody revealed that Clint had actually given his blessing, because that would be the only way to make peace between Natalie and Jessica.\n\n\nBrody answered the knock on the door and found Viki, who congratulated Natalie and Brody.  Viki was upset by the physical altercation between Natalie and Jessica and asked if they knew how hurt Jessica was.  Brody indicated that he had to leave, but that he hoped that they could all get past it.  Natalie questioned if her Uncle Todd was making things harder on himself with his escape, and if Viki was wondering about Natalie after taking one look at Jessica's face.\n\n\nViki admitted that she hated being in the middle of her two daughters and felt that something needed to be done.  Viki questioned if Natalie would really want to marry someone who was supposed to have married her sister.  Natalie maintained that she just wanted her family, and to be happy, but that she had moved out of her home and had lost her dad, and that she feared that she was losing her sister.\n\n\nViki insisted that Natalie would never, ever lose her as a mother.  Natalie stressed that she and Brody loved each other, and that they had a beautiful son, Liam, so Viki asked, \"And what about John McBain?\"  Natalie replied, \"Oh, Mom, any hope I had of John and I getting back together died the day he discovered he wasn't Liam's father.\"\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Jessica found Tina's doggy bag on the floor and cursed, \"Damn it, Tina.\"  Jessica then picked up the document of the paternity tests results stating that Liam's DNA was a match to John McBain.  Jessica cried, \"Oh, my God!\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "At Victor's home, everybody is wondering what to do with Irene and Todd on the loose. Bo wants to believe Starr that Irene wrote the death threat letter but needs proof which she can't give him since the letter was written in \"invisible ink.\" Bo has no alternative but to arrest Starr. Outside, Tina's dog escapes and she doesn't even know it until hours after she's been at Viki's. She runs into Cord unexpectedly, and he is not happy to see her knowing all of the foolish things she did in 2009 that endangered Natalie as well as their own daughter Sarah. The dog seems to know that Irene has planted a digital time bomb outside Victor's home although the people inside are completely distracted without a clue. Jessica and Natalie have been injured when they got into their fight. Viki goes to talk to Natalie somehow knowing that her daughter might not be doing the right thing by marrying Brody, because she is not over John. When Jessica is alone, she notices Tina's purse on the floor and discovers the document that may prove the accurate results of the DNA test that John is the father of Natalie's baby and not Brody.",
