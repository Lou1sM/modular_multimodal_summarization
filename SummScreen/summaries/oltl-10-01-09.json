    "soap_central": "\n Who's Zoomin' Who \n\n\nAt the rehab center, Schuyler confided in Rachel that he had obtained a second job in order to pay for medical school. Rachel had her doubts when she heard that the second job was at Rodi's, where Gigi was also employed. She thought that Gigi was Schuyler's \"drug of choice\" and things would be too difficult for Schuyler to handle. Schuyler didn't agree and then shared the news that Kim had asked him out. He knew that Gigi would be unhappy about it but he had turned her down, because he didn't feel that he had anything in common with \"Princess Thunder Thighs,\" which was Kim's stage name, anyway. Rachel felt that Schuyler should go out with Kim.\n\n\nCris surprised Layla and dropped her forgotten gym bag off at the police station. He revealed that he had a meeting with an art dealer who wanted to know all about Cris and his inspirations for his art work. The two would be hitting the town. Immediately suspicious, Layla accused Cris of having a date with the dealer, who was probably a cougar, and suspected it was not a meeting at all. \"Why do you care?\" Cris wanted to know.\n\n\nAssuring Cris that she didn't care at all, Layla pointed out that they were friends and she was obligated to look after him. She thanked Cris for taking her to the wedding and concert, and they agreed that those weren't considered dates.\n\n\nGigi and Kim had some words at Rodi's when Gigi accused Kim and Stacy of spying on her. She pointed out that Rex had learned about Schuyler's new job at Rodi's within seconds of it happening. She referred to Kim and Stacy as the \"Sisterhood of the Traveling Sluts\" and was obviously jealous when Kim dropped a bombshell; she had asked Schuyler out on a date.\n\n\nKyle and Oliver bumped into each other at the bar in Rodi's, and Kyle mentioned how proud he was about Oliver \"coming out\" to his parents and standing up for himself. Before Oliver could express some self-doubt, Kyle told Oliver that he was perfect. Oliver wondered what would have happened to them as a couple if his mother hadn't discovered them together back in college. When Kyle pointed out that Oliver wouldn't have come out any sooner anyway, Oliver agreed. Their conversation was over when Kyle's date, Nick, arrived and the couple headed for a table.\n\n\nArriving at Rodi's and plunging into his new job, Schuyler was surprised to see Kim, who whined that she hadn't heard from him after she had asked him out. Schuyler accepted the offer and the pair made plans for the end of Schuyler's shift. \"Have you lost your mind?\" Gigi yelled at Schuyler. When Gigi called Kim \"Vegas trash,\" Schuyler rushed to Kim's defense. He advised Gigi that he couldn't wait around any longer for the right girl to happen along. He had already tried that and it didn't work, he reminded her.\n\n\nGigi apologized for rubbing Schuyler's nose in his feelings for her. She agreed that she shouldn't be hovering over him, but she was sure that Kim and Stacy were up to something. Schuyler assured her that he'd be on the lookout, but he had to move on. She urged him to be careful. In the meantime, Kim called Stacy to share the good news about her date, and was thrilled to add that Gigi was positively jealous.\n\n\nAs Cris waited around for the art dealer, he struck up a conversation with Oliver. He urged his roommate to sit at the table with Kyle and Nick, but Oliver was loath to interrupt the date. Noting how Oliver and Kyle had been looking at each other, Cris suggested that his motto \"No ring, no strings,\" should be Oliver's as well. He noted that Kyle and Nick hadn't been dating that long. Cris  strongly suggested that Oliver needed to tell Kyle how he felt. Oliver agreed that he would do that when Cris did the same thing and confessed his feelings to Layla. Cris insisted that he didn't have feelings for Layla and that they were merely friends and roommates. Oliver ordered Cris to follow his own advice. He added that he had seen how Cris and Layla looked at each other.\n\n\nAt their table, Kyle told Nick about running into Oliver's dad. He had mentioned it to Oliver, but not the part about Mr. Fish catching a kiss between Nick and Kyle. Nick wondered if Kyle was into Oliver or if it was the other way around. Kyle assured Nick that Oliver just needed a friend. The guys shared a kiss goodbye when Nick had to leave, and they agreed to meet up again. Cris insisted that Oliver head to Kyle's table and he finally agreed that he would talk to Layla. Just then, Layla arrived and Cris admitted that the art dealer had stood him up. Oliver walked over to speak to Kyle.\n\n\nAs the presumed stalker, who was lingering outside of the study at Llanfair, focused on Natalie and Jessica, Jared headed off to take a shower. Stealthily, Brody headed for Jared's bedroom and, hearing Jared's running water, he picked up Jared's phone that was laying on the bed. He quickly scanned Jared's latest calls. He found several from an unknown caller, but as the water stopped, he tossed the phone back onto the bed and fled. Entering from the bathroom, Jared curiously picked up his phone and looked around.\n\n\nDownstairs, the stalker appeared ready to make his move, but Brody returned to the girls in the study. Natalie received a call from John, advising her that he was on his way over. Jared headed into the study  and asked his wife if she had been upstairs, since he thought he heard her voice. Natalie assured him that she hadn't been there. John arrived with his enhanced picture of the stalker and passed it around to everyone.\n\n\nJessica thought it might have been the person she saw in the yard, but she wasn't sure. John explained that the photo was courtesy of David Vickers and his filming crew. John asked if he would be able to show the photo to Bree and, while Jessica was okay with it, Natalie put up a fuss. After reconsidering, Natalie agreed, thinking that it would get John off of Jared's back.\n\n\n\"Daddy,\" Bree called out after being shown the photo. She told John that it was the same man who had given her the stuffed elephant. Natalie advised John that he had his stalker and would be able to leave Jared alone. Outside, the stalker kept watch. He advised an unknown party on the phone that he had lost his chance, but would get another one.\n\n\nNatalie grilled Jared about the stalker's photo but Jared insisted that he had no idea of who the man was and said he had never seen the man at Buchanan Enterprises.\n\n\nBack at the police station, John received information from an FBI friend on the stalker's identity. The man had done prison time in the same place as Jared and at the same time. Brody arrived and told John what he had seen on Jared's phone.\n\n\nAt the hospital, a still distraught Greg informed Matthew that he wouldn't be operating on him or anyone else ever. He continued to blame himself for the mistake that had caused Shaun's plight and he vowed to make sure that something like that would never happen again. Greg promised to give Matthew a referral for another doctor and had an associate in mind. He would speak to him on behalf of Matthew.\n\n\nAn angry Matthew did his best to convince Greg to perform the surgery as promised, but Greg refused to give in. He assured the teen that his mind was made up and he wouldn't do it. Sadly, Matthew told Destiny that he would probably be in his wheelchair forever. Rachel arrived and overheard her brother's declaration. She entered Shaun's room and found Greg talking to his unconscious brother. Rachel demanded to know what had happened, and Greg informed her that he hadn't held up his end of his oath, the part that said \"Do no harm.\" He planned on never operating again, he added.\n\n\nOut in the hallway, Rachel berated Greg for making decisions based on fear, the same thing that he had accused her of doing. \"What about those people you healed?\" she asked him. She was sure that Shaun would praise Greg if he had the chance to do so, and he wouldn't want his brother to give up. They continued to argue over Greg's decision and Rachel admitted that she didn't have a clue as to what Greg was going through. She knew that it was difficult to go through it alone and she suggested that Greg speak to a psychiatrist. She noted that she herself was seeking help with Marty Saybrooke. Greg lost his temper and brushed Rachel off; he headed to sit beside Shaun again.\n\n\n",
