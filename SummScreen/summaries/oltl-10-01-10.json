John believed that after Eli Clarke had received the injuries in the fire, he had needed someone that he could trust to treat him.\n\n\nShaun arrived, and John asked about Greg.  John stated that he was aware that Greg had flown back to the hospice, and Shaun indicated that Greg had wanted to review T\u00e9a's case.  However, Shaun was surprised to learn that Greg had been back to St. Kitts twice.  Shaun informed John and Natalie that T\u00e9a had wanted to die alone, because she had loved Todd and Dani.  However, when John announced that Greg had testified in the custody case that T\u00e9a had wanted Ross to raise Dani, Shaun yelled, \"No.  Hell, no!\"\n\n\nShaun insisted that T\u00e9a had wanted Todd and Dani to stay together and stressed that something was just not right.  Shaun then excused himself, so that he could meet with Destiny.  When Shaun joined Destiny at her table, Destiny regretted that Dani had to leave with Ross and wondered what Greg was \"mixed up in.\"\n\n\nAfter Shaun left, John and Natalie speculated that Greg had asked T\u00e9a to sign the fake will, while she was weak from her condition.  John decided that it was time that he flew to St. Kitts, and he told Natalie that Detective Price would be accompanying him.  After John gave Natalie a kiss, Natalie yelled out at John to call her.\n\n\nDestiny continued to ponder over Greg's new mystery mission, and Shaun guessed that Greg was \"standing in some deep shade these days.\"  Destiny believed that Greg should have been more relaxed after his vacation, but also felt that \"something about T\u00e9a had gotten to him.\"  Destiny informed Shaun that she had a plan that involved Darren, but Shaun refused her help.  \"You are not messing in our brother's business.  Leave that to me.\"\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Todd, escorted by two police officers, informed Viki and Charlie that the judge had awarded Dani to Ross, who was taking her to Tahiti within the hour.  Viki hugged Todd, as he expressed his grief over losing his daughter.  Todd insisted that Viki and Charlie could help him.  When Todd asked for some private time to speak with his sister, Charlie assisted the policemen out into the lobby.\n\n\nTodd announced his plot to kidnap Dani.  \"Viki, I just can't let her go like this.  She's my daughter.  And she's T\u00e9a's daughter.  She's all I have left of T\u00e9a.\"  Todd explained that he would have his private plane ready, when one of the policemen walked into the room and told Todd that it was time to leave.  Todd begged Viki for her help, and Viki refused.  Todd yelled at Viki to forget helping him and screamed that he was sorry that Viki could not help Dani.\n\n\nAfter Todd stormed out, Charlie asked if Viki was okay.  Viki cried that Todd was right, and that made him want to do something desperate.  Later, on the phone, Viki found out about Todd's threat to kill Ross.  Viki offered to act as a neutral party to prevent Dani from leaving, but she was turned down.  Viki informed Charlie that there was no way to stop the process.\n\n\nCharlie was outraged that Todd had threatened to kill Ross but also did not want to judge Todd.  Viki voiced that Todd had lost T\u00e9a and Dani, which made Viki afraid that Todd would lash out.  When Charlie asked if Todd would try something else, Viki claimed, \"Oh yes, and it will probably be something really foolish, or very, very dangerous.\"\n\n\nWhen Natalie arrived at Llanfair, Viki greeted and hugged her.  Viki told Natalie of Todd's visit, and Natalie expressed that she could not possibly imagine what Todd was going through.  Natalie gave Viki a kiss and headed off to bed.  As Viki wistfully watched Natalie walked up the stairs, Charlie commented that Viki looked like she wanted to tuck Natalie in -- and read her a story.  Just as Viki hoped that she could help Todd out somehow, the doorbell rang.  Charlie opened the door to Echo DiSavoy.  \"Chuckles, long time, no see.\"  Echo threw her arms around Charlie, and he stood with a shocked expression on his face.\n\n\nIn Todd's mansion, Dani walked in, stunned, and Blair swore that Dani would not lose them.  Starr arrived and wondered why the cops were on the porch.  After Blair explained about the verdict of the trial, Starr could not believe that Dani had to leave immediately and asked why Todd was not at home.  Blair remarked that Todd was at Viki's, because he was avoiding the reality.\n\n\nBlair informed Starr that, during the court hearings, Ross had played a tape of Todd's threats to Ross.  Blair also related that although Dani loved Ross, Dani did not want to leave her friends and family.  Blair regretted that Dani would never get the chance to know her father as T\u00e9a had wished.  When Blair and Starr later found Dani in her room, Dani sadly stated that she had not yet started to pack.  Starr asked about Nate, and Dani suspected that Nate would find it too hard to say goodbye.\n\n\nIn Ford's apartment, Nate announced to James that Nate would lose Dani if they did not do something to help.  Nate exclaimed that he would never see Dani again.  Nate insisted that he and James had to hide Dani, so that no one could find her, but James considered Todd.  \"He's a huge problem, man.  He's loaded, he's powerful, and he's crazy protective of those girls.  Why isn't he all over this?\"\n\n\nNate explained that the cops would not allow Todd to be close to Dani but offered that if Nate and James prevented Dani from moving to Tahiti, they would be heroes to Todd.  James pondered about the timeline, especially in regards to prison time, because he was just starting school.  So, Nate yelled that he would do what needed to be done himself.\n\n\nStarr called and insisted that Nate rush over to Todd's mansion to say goodbye to Dani.  Nate informed James that Starr had said that Nate needed to step up for Dani.  Nate started to leave, but James stopped him.  James announced that he would help Dani.  After James revealed his plan, Nate felt that it was a good plan and believed that they could make it work.  Nate thanked James, who said, \"Look, don't thank me, until we get Dani out of that house, okay?\"\n\n\nAt St. Kitts hospice, T\u00e9a awoke in her hospital bed and whispered, \"Todd.\"  A nurse entered the room, and when T\u00e9a asked about Todd, the nurse claimed that he had already left the hospice.  After T\u00e9a asked if her daughter had been with Todd, the nurse stated that she had not seen Dani.  The nurse informed T\u00e9a that Dr. Evans had left strict instructions that T\u00e9a was not to be disturbed.  However, the nurse told T\u00e9a that she would try to find out when Todd would return, and she left the room.  T\u00e9a cried out loud, \"Why did you leave, Todd?\"\n\n\nAlso at St. Kitts, Greg told Eli that if Eli were to leave the hospice, he would be a dead man.  Greg informed Eli that the bed rest had helped him, but that he had a blood clot in his brain.  \"If it blows, you're dead.\"  Greg explained that the nurse only knew about Eli's vital signs, so she would believe that Eli was fine.  Greg insisted that Eli was a walking time bomb, and if the clot moved around in his brain, it would blow.\n\n\nGreg informed Eli that he needed surgery.  Eli wondered why he did not have any symptoms, but Greg maintained that Eli could have a stroke, so Greg had scheduled an operating room for later that day.  Eli yelled, \"No, no, Doc.  I don't have time for major surgery.  I have things to do.\"  Greg replied, \"Well, you can't do anything if you're dead.  I'm going to prep.\"\n\n\nAs Greg walked out of the room, his phone rang.  When the nurse told Greg that T\u00e9a had questions, Greg demanded that the nurse follow his orders and said to give T\u00e9a a sedative to calm her.  Greg reentered the room and told Eli that the ugly red blotch in his brain would be gone by the next day.\n\n\nWhen Eli questioned Greg about his odds of survival during the surgery, Greg was vague.  Eli declared that Greg could not fool him, because he had created that con.  Greg cried that he could not do it anymore, and Eli said that Greg was in way too deep.  When Greg said that he could still correct it, Eli warned, \"Really, how?  Because no matter what you do, T\u00e9a Delgado will still be dead.\"\n\n\nGreg still begged for Eli to let Greg \"fix\" him, and Eli wondered why Greg would want do that.  Greg insisted, \"I want the dying to stop.  My job is to keep people alive.\"  When Eli stated that he had \"places to go and a teenage girl to see,\" Greg remarked, \"I don't think so,\" as he held a needle and syringe in his hand.\n\n\nGreg tried to stab Eli with the needle, but Eli fought him off.  Greg screamed, \"The poison that you wanted me to give to T\u00e9a Delgado.  It'll kill you too.\"  Greg and Eli fell onto the floor.\n\n\nBack at Todd's mansion, Todd walked through the front door and announced that Viki had refused to help.  Blair did not blame Viki, and Dani told Todd that she had just one question.  \"Would you really have killed Ross, if you had the chance?\"  Blair explained to Dani that Todd had been desperate and had been afraid of losing Dani.  Blair only hoped that Dani would never have to feel that desperate.  However, Dani reflected that she already had, when she had held a gun on Todd.\n\n\nTodd insisted that he loved Dani and would never want to do anything to hurt her, and that included killing Ross.  Todd told Dani that he would always love her.  Starr stated that she loved Dani, and that Dani would always be her sister.  Blair said that she loved Dani, as Blair kissed her on the head.  Dani revealed that when the judge had asked in court what Dani had really wanted, she had mentally chosen to be with Todd.  Todd was pleased that Dani had chosen him, and Dani ran upstairs with Starr to get her \"stuff.\"\n\n\nTodd exclaimed to Blair, \"She chose me.  She wants to stay with me.  I know that's what T\u00e9a wanted.  That was her wish.  I can't believe she's not going to see it come true.\"  Todd sadly shook his head.\n\n\nWhen the nurse reentered T\u00e9a's room at the hospice, T\u00e9a insisted that she needed to see her husband and her daughter and pleaded with the nurse to let T\u00e9a use the nurae's phone.  When T\u00e9a declared that she needed to talk to her daughter, the nurse informed T\u00e9a that the doctor would return, once he was finished with his other patient.  When the nurse asked T\u00e9a to get some rest, T\u00e9a claimed that she could not sleep.  The nurse left to get medication.\n\n\nThe nurse returned and bent over T\u00e9a to give her a pill and a drink of water.  The nurse stated that she would check on T\u00e9a later and exited the room.  T\u00e9a then looked at the phone in her hand, which she had taken from the nurse.\n\n\nJohn arrived at St. Kitts and asked the nurse for the location of Dr. Greg Evans.  The nurse pointed at a room and indicated that the doctor was with a patient.  John reached for his gun and kicked open the door of the room.\n\n\nIn her room, T\u00e9a punched in some numbers on the cell phone.  Blair and Todd walked into the living room in his mansion.  Todd declared, \"My daughter loves me,\" and Blair observed, \"Well, you earned that.\"  When Todd's phone rang, Blair asked, \"Who is it?\"  Todd replied, \"I don't recognize the number.  It can wait.\"  Blair insisted, \"No, it might be somebody from the court about Dani.\"  When Todd picked up the phone, T\u00e9a gasped, \"Todd...Todd.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "TOdd and all the people Dani has to leave are devastated that she has to move to move to Tahiti with Ross. And the judge has gone so far as to deny Todd visitation rights after Ross has played the tape recording for the judge of Todd threatening to kill him and dump his body. Dani admits that she would have chosen Todd, calls him dad and tells him she loves him for the first time. He first urges Viki to help him kidnap Dani, knowing the cops will trust her with her niece and she won't get in trouble. She declines to help him but admits she knows how he is feeling and that what has happened to him is not ok. John and Natalie consult with SHaun who tells them that Tea confided in him before she died and he knows, for a fact that she could not have named Ross as Dani's legal guardian. He knows that she wanted Todd and Dani to be together. ANd they all wonder why Greg would testify under oath that she wnated Ross to raise Dani. Meanwhile, Greg is determined to prevent Eli from doing more damage by scaring him into believing that he needs surgery in order not to have his brain blow up on him. But Eli somehow knows not to trust Greg's diagnosis. He also has a nurse preventing Tea from calling Todd althugh neither the nurse nor Tea have a clue as to why. Tea somehow manages to get a hold of the phone and calls Todd. Nate persuades James to help him prevent Dani from leaving him.",
