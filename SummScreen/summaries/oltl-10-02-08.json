    "soap_central": "\n A Parting Gift \n\n\nAs John waited for his plane to take off for Llanview, he spied an old friend from the police department sitting nearby. Pete, a blind, retired cop was in Colombia working with the police department. Once settled next to each other courtesy of the flight attendant, Pete asked John if something was bothering him. John filled him in on the hidden woman eluding his sights in Llanview. Pete felt the case was personal to John and told him he had to be \"in it to win it.\" Used to depending on other senses, Pete advised John to draw on his brain and intuition in trying to solve the case. \n\n\nThe former cop urged John to put what he didn't know out of his mind and close his eyes. He made him go over the story and posed different questions to him. What did Ramsey want from the woman he was hiding and what did the woman have? As John's mind wandered, the images of Marty's fatal accident in Ireland flashed into his head. He opened his eyes and saw Marty. \n\n\nMarty, gasping for air, awoke in a sweat after having a nightmare of her long-ago rape. She called out for both Todd and Janet, and hearing nothing but silence, she climbed out of bed. Making her way downstairs and to the front door, she gulped the fresh air and began to breathe slowly again. As she turned and headed back inside, she spotted Todd's laptop. She was drawn to it and sat down in front of it gingerly. She slowly typed her name and other key words into the search engine. She hit enter and began to read, as articles about her rape appeared. \n\n\nTodd paid a visit to Tess, and taunted her about loving-mother Jessica not being around to take care of her daughter. Tess gave it back, shooting darts at loving-father Todd. When he sarcastically inquired as to Natalie's whereabouts, she compared her imprisonment of Natalie to his own confinement of Marty. Tess accused Todd of suddenly developing a conscience, thanks to his time with Marty. Todd reminded Tess that Nash was not hers to avenge, and that Nash had left Tess for Jessica. He was sure that Jess would return. This did not sit well with Tess and voices were raised. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Gigi informed the gathered that Shane was aware of Rex being his father and how he had saved their lives. Roxy draped her arms around her newfound grandson, inviting him to head to the cafeteria with her. As the boy looked around, looking scared, Bo stepped in and saved him, declaring that he had questions for him. Layla continued to leave Adriana messages. Jared decided to look for Natalie again. \n\n\nBo pulled Shane aside and empathized with his two-father situation. He explained, kindly, how Matthew would understand Shane's predicament fully. He requested that Shane take his time to think about Rex and get to know him. The boy quickly retorted that he already knew Rex, and he was no Brody. Bo quickly added that Brody would get all of the help he needed and he agreed that Rex was certainly not the soldier type. However, he thought that Rex, too, deserved a medal for heroism after saving Gigi and Shane from Brody's bullet, and thus injuring himself. It was certain that Rex would be different as a father, Bo continued, and he trusted Shane to do the right thing and give Rex a chance. Bo asked Shane to think about how he would miss Rex if he died. \n\n\nMichael announced that Rex's liver was saved, but the spleen had been removed. The young man was still critical and still had to fight-and they could still lose him. He was sedated and on a ventilator, and could have one visitor at a time. As Rex was wheeled through, sobbing could be heard. Charlie gave Roxy a pep talk, as she tried to think of reasons for not sitting with her son. Finally, she agreed. Making fun of his looks, Roxy fondly remembered an incident from when he was a boy. She told him that Shane was aware of Rex being his dad and Shane needed him. She knew that Rex would come back to her. \n\n\nIt was Bo's turn next and he gave Rex a dressing down for never listening to him and always having something going on. He then switched tactics and told the young man how proud he was of him, and gave him some orders. Rex was not to check out and he would do whatever it took to get better. If he didn't listen, Bo would never forgive him. \n\n\nAs doctors continued to frantically work on Rex, he was back on the set of So You Think You Can Be Shane Morasco's Father? The game was over, Colin told him, because he had flatlined. The judges, though, continued to mull over Rex's answer of selecting Bo as his father. Rex pleaded his case, stating that he learned \"if you want to be a man, you have to see a man.\" Bo had changed him and he had become a better person-and he would be a great father. Suddenly, Colin announced that they would continue into the lightning round. Rex would have to leave Gigi to get Shane. \n\n\nRex was adamant; he would not choose because that was not an option to him. Colin offered to sweeten the deal, offering sexual fulfillment with meaningless affairs and a portion of Cramer Enterprises in his divorce settlement. Rex still refused, even if it meant sacrificing himself. Suddenly, the game was over. Colin left and the lights went out. Rex continued to yell, explaining that he couldn't choose because his family needed him. He didn't care what the rules were, he insisted. \n\n\nThe unconscious Rex heard a voice, telling him to open his eyes. He did what he was told and saw Adriana. \n\n\nJared walked in on the arguing Tess and Todd, wondering what they were yelling about. Immediately, Todd spoke up, and pointed out that Jess just wasn't herself. He announced that he had just fired her from the newspaper. Tess retorted that she needed to focus on her family, anyway, and didn't care. Upon Jared's questioning, Todd confirmed that he had not seen Natalie. Once Todd left, Tess proclaimed that she was going to bed. Jared was quite curious as to why she didn't even ask about Rex. Claiming that she didn't want to pry, Tess was let off the hook. When he asked if she was going to the hospital, she once more came up with an excuse. They talked about Natalie and wondered if she knew about her brother. Tess figured she was far away, where nothing about Llanview would be mentioned. \n\n\nJared finally began to appear suspicious of Tess's behavior and her answers. As he left, Tess wondered if the \"idiot\" was on to her. \n\n\nAs she flipped through the articles online, Marty was oblivious to Todd returning home. Observing her on the computer, he asked what she was looking at. \"My rapists,\" she replied.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John is returning from his flight after unsuccessfully looking for Cristian. But he runs into an old acquaintance who \"enlightens\" him about whom the mysterious woman might be who Ramsey might have hid in his house before he died and who Todd is now hiding. Meanwhile, Marty finds her way downstairs and gets on the computer to find the newspaper article where she got raped. But she still cannot find out whom the rapist was. Rex is hanging between life and death. And he has a dream where he's on a game show that is called: \"Are you fit to be Shane Morasco's Dad\". Deceased Colin McIver and Jen Rappaport host the show and it's in the format of \"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire\". And they ask Rex many questions about his shady past. And one specific question comes up that he cannot answer and that is about who (among 8 choices of men) is Rex's real father. And it looks like Rex might have lost the game where Brody has won and Brody is seen as Shane's real father.",
