    "soap_central": "\nExes and Oh's!\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian met with David, her campaign manager, and expressed her delight that Ross had succeeded at preventing Blair from disrupting Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding.  Informing Dorian that she had no reason to celebrate, David presented Dorian with the latest edition of the Sun.  The article stated that Viki was ahead of Dorian in the election polls.  Blaming David for her troubles, an enraged Dorian instructed her campaign manager to uncover damaging evidence against Viki.  \n\n\nInside her rented cabana on the country club grounds, T\u00e9a examined the check that had fallen from Ross's pocket.   Todd crept up behind T\u00e9a and presented her with the latest edition of the Sun.  The cover featured the newly married couple and a title that read, \"Nothing can come between them.\"  Realizing that his bride was troubled, Todd questioned why T\u00e9a was upset.  In an attempt to deflect Todd's questioning, T\u00e9a stressed that she wanted to start a new life with Todd and his children.  \n\n\nThe mention of family life caused Todd to suggest that he and T\u00e9a  start a family of their own, leaving T\u00e9a in complete shock.  T\u00e9a advised Todd that having a child would be an unwise move, but pointed out that she loved him for considering the idea.  Claiming that she had a family court date, T\u00e9a quickly excused herself.\n\n\nInside the cabana on the grounds of La Boulaie, Ross attempted to console Blair by urging her to forget about Todd.  Insisting that he cared for her, Ross invited Blair to join him in Tahiti, and gave her a passionate kiss.  Initially, Blair responded to Ross's kiss, but eventually pulled away.  After she promised to have all legal matters against Ross dropped and file his divorce papers, Blair said goodbye.\n\n\nOnce Blair had left the cabana, Ross phoned Elijah and exclaimed, \"I did it!  T\u00e9a thinks we're divorced and Dorian issued me a large check!\"  As he boasted about his instant wealth, Ross realized that the check was missing.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at La Boulaie, Blair explained to Dorian how Ross had dragged her away and ruined her opportunity to stop Todd and T\u00e9a's wedding.  When Blair related that Ross had claimed to have feelings for her, Dorian suggested that her niece consider a possible romance with Ross.  Stunned by Dorian's advice that she become involved with an ex-felon, Blair stormed out of the room.\n\n\nMoments later, Ross stumbled into La Boulaie and asked Dorian to issue him another check.  Dorian didn't believe Ross's claim that he had lost the check and refused to issue him another.  While Blair listened out in the hall, Ross reminded Dorian that he had earned the money by distracting Blair -- just as Dorian had instructed him to do.\n\n\nUpon learning that they had schemed against her, Blair lashed out at Ross and Dorian.  Hurt and confused, Blair reminded Ross that he had claimed to have feelings for her.  Although Ross argued that he did care for her, Blair refused to believe him.  Blair announced that she wouldn't drop the charges against him, and insisted that she would add a list of additional charges.  Angered by their betrayal, Blair warned, \"Nobody's going to get away with this!\"  As Blair rushed out of the house, Dorian pleaded with Ross to go after her.  Stating that Blair was determined to get what she wanted, Ross advised Dorian that she was fighting a losing battle.  \n\n\nRoss related that he didn't want T\u00e9a to discover him at La Boulaie, and suggested that he end his stay.  Cautioning Ross that T\u00e9a was the least of his worries, Dorian reminded Ross that that he would face the wrath of Todd once Todd learned that Ross was actually married to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nBlair arrived at Todd's honeymoon cabana and teased him about having valuable information regarding T\u00e9a.  Unwilling to play games with Blair, Todd refused to hear any accusations made against T\u00e9a.  After a brief hesitation, Todd demanded to know what information Blair had uncovered about his wife.  With a devilish smile, Blair remarked, \"You can't be T\u00e9a's husband, because she already has one!\"\n\n\nAt that moment, T\u00e9a barged into La Boulaie and called out to Dorian.  As T\u00e9a demanded to know why Dorian had written a check to Ross Rayburn, T\u00e9a was stunned to discover Ross in the room, instead of Dorian.\n\n\nIn the library of Llanfair, Charlie was pleased to learn that Viki was leading Dorian in the polls, but warned that Dorian had a trick up her sleeve.  Charlie reminded Viki that Nick Chavez, an activist for the Llanview Gay and Lesbian Alliance, had scheduled a meeting with Viki to discuss Viki's stand on gay rights issues.  \n\n\nViki and Charlie welcomed Nick into their home.  When Nick asked Viki if she supported gay marriages, Viki stated that every human being deserved respect and equal rights under the law, which pleased Nick.  As Viki assured Nick that she was a supporter of gay rights, David arrived and interrupted Viki's session with Nick.  Certain that Dorian had sent David to spy on her, Viki asked David to leave, but Nick insisted on learning Dorian's stand on gay rights.  Startled by the request, David searched for answers, but came up short.  When Nick learned that Viki employed a gay individual on her campaign, Nick questioned whether Dorian did the same.  Unable to present Nick with a convincing answer, David quickly excused himself.\n\n\nLater, David returned to La Boulaie to update Dorian on recent developments.  David explained that it was necessary for Dorian to hire a \"queen\" to work on her campaign.  To his surprise, Dorian announced, \"I don't need one, I already have you!\"\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Natalie questioned whether Jared was certain that he had never seen the stalker before.  Reminding Jared that John was convinced that the culprit had once worked at Buchanan Enterprises, Natalie thought it was surprising that Jared didn't recognize the suspect.  A look of suspicion crossed Natalie's face. While Jared continued to deny knowing the stalker, Jessica entered and the couple ended the conversation.\n\n\nInside John's office, John informed Brody that Jared and the stalker had served time in prison together.  Convinced that Jared knew his attacker, Brody questioned how John intended to proceed with the case.  Relating that he hadn't determined if Jared actually knew his attacker, John told Brody that he wanted to include someone else in the investigation.\n\n\nWhile Jessica spoke with Natalie and Jared, Brody phoned and asked Jessica to meet him at the police station.  Jessica grew nervous when Brody insisted that she not reveal where she was going to Natalie or Jared.  After hanging up with Brody, Jessica quickly made up an excuse to leave.  Once Jessica had left, a suspicious Natalie informed Jared that Jessica had lied to them.  Natalie began to question if John had enlisted Brody's help in searching for the stalker.  \n\n\nCertain that Natalie's was worried about John's suspicion of him, Jared assured Natalie that John couldn't hurt him because he was innocent.  As Jared tried to ease Natalie's anxiety, he received a mysterious call.   Answering the call, Jared screamed into the phone, \"I'll have to call you back!\"  After lying about the identity of the caller, Jared informed Natalie that he was taking her on a special date, and insisted that she get ready for a night of fun.  As Natalie left to prepare for the date, Jared received a text message that read, \"I'm on the terrace.\"\n\n\nJessica arrived at the police station and was shocked to learn of Jared's possible connection to the stalker.  Jessica couldn't believe that Jared would ever want to cause harm to Natalie and her family.  Recalling that Tess was responsible for Jared's stint in prison, Jessica wondered if Jared was actually using Natalie to seek revenge against Jessica.   Jessica wondered if Natalie was in danger.\n\n\nOnce Natalie was dressed and ready for their date, she searched downstairs for Jared.  As Natalie approached the terrace, a sudden fear struck her.   Opening the terrace doors, Natalie discovered Jared kneeling over the bloody, motionless body of the alleged stalker.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, a shocked Kyle listened as Fish confessed that he was still in love with Kyle.  As Fish began to pour his heart out, Kyle was skeptical of Fish's true feelings.  Reminding Fish that he had hurt Kyle in the past, Kyle stated that he wasn't willing to put his heart on the line again.  Kyle believed that Fish wasn't sure of his true feelings, but Fish insisted that he wanted to renew his relationship with his former lover.  \n\n\nTo Fish's surprise, Kyle related that he was happy with Nick and wanted to give the relationship a try.  Informing Fish that they couldn't become involved again, Kyle suggested that Fish enjoy his new freedom as a gay male.  While Fish continued to declare his love for Kyle, Nick approached and questioned if he had interrupted an important conversation.   After saying goodbye to Fish, Kyle ushered Nick in the opposite direction.  When Nick expressed concern about Kyle's friendship with Fish, Kyle assured Nick that there was no need for concern.\n\n\nAcross the room, Layla chastised Cristian for convincing Fish to reveal his true feelings to Kyle.  When Layla insisted that it was too soon for Fish to become involved in a relationship, Cristian questioned if Layla was actually speaking about her own situation.  Reminding her that she was still hurting, Cristian wondered if Layla would want to know if someone had feelings for her.  Layla wondered if Cristian was trying to tell her something.  \n\n\nJoining Cristian and Layla, Fish informed his friends that he had failed at renewing his relationship with Kyle.  Apologizing for encouraging Fish to express his feelings to Kyle, Cristian stated, \"You're a better man than me.  I would never have the guts!\"  Consoling Fish, Layla stated that it was too soon for him to become involved with someone.   Cristian listened intently as Layla exclaimed, \"I'm not ready, either.  If Prince Charming were to walk through that door right now, I wouldn't even notice!\" \n\n\n",
