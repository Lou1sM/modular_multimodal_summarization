Marty gets Tommy to go down for a nap and John compliments her on her technique. Marty says the two of them are really cute together. John jokes about his parenting skills. Marty asks if John just came by for babysitting advice, or if he really was there for something like a kiss. Then they kiss. Marty says she's not usually so bold. John says he doesn't mind. John says they don't need to talk about it, just go forward. They talk about Tommy, which reminds Marty of how Patrick was when Cole was a baby. Then she realizes that talking about Patrick might be weird for John. He assures her it doesn't bother him because Patrick is part of who she is. Marty says she really likes who he is.

Michael avoids the question, flashing back to the day Rex told him that Todd was Tommy's biological father. Michael lies and says he found out the same time as everyone else. The lawyer tries to get Michael to see it from Todd's side. Michael says he would be guided by what was best for his son, not by his own interests. Todd stands up and argues, and the judge admonishes him. Michael says DNA doesn't automatically make you a father. Michael's testimony is over and Marcie gives him a kiss. Marcie is called to the stand. She tells the court why she should be Tommy's legal guardian. She says because she would die for Tommy and she would die without him. She says Tommy is a part of their hearts and their lives. She apologizes that circumstances took Tommy away from Todd, but she's not sorry that Tommy came to the McBains. She begs the judge to let them keep Tommy. Todd's lawyer tells Marcie they can adopt again, and she goes off on him. Marcie is then excused. She tells Todd that if he loves his son, he would not try to take him away from the only family he's ever known. Todd's lawyer says that Todd is Tommy's birth father, and that he should be reunited with his real father. The McBains' lawyer says that biology is not the primary issue, and that Todd is an unfit parent. The judge rules that Tommy will stay with the McBains while he makes his decision. Marcie drops her purse and Tommy's binky as she leaves; Todd picks them up and hands them to her without a word. \n\n\n",
