    "soap_central": "\nThe Full Story\n\n\nAt his home, Todd found Marty downstairs and staring at the computer screen. Todd questioned what she was doing. In complete shock, Marty replied, \"Looking at my rapists.\" Marty pointed to a past photo of Kevin, Powell, Zack, and Todd -- before his reconstructive surgery. As he stared at the picture from his past, Todd had a flashback of an article that had appeared in the Sun several years earlier. The headline had read, \"Brand New Face, Same Old Todd.\" She demanded to know why Todd had told her that she was raped by only three men, but news reports verified that four men had committed rape against her. \n\n\nTodd told Marty that she had been raped by three men but had mistakenly identified an innocent man. Todd said that Marty was drunk on the night of her rape and had confused the innocent man as one of her attackers. Marty listened as Todd stated that she had later cleared the innocent man. Racked with guilt, Marty asked Todd which man had she falsely accused. Todd slowly pointed at Kevin. Showing some doubt, Marty wanted to know about Kevin. Todd convinced Marty that Kevin was innocent of the crime, but she blamed herself for hurting so many people. Todd tried to convince her that she had also suffered and had no reason to feel guilt. Marty appeared distressed. \n\n\nAs she stared at the photo of her attackers, a troubled Marty told Todd that she needed to know more about them. A look of panic crossed Todd's face when Marty stated that she wanted to know their names. Pleading with Marty not to dig any deeper into her past, Todd warned her that she would regret it. He said that she would open up old wounds and be filled with pain and hate. Debating over whether she should continue with her search, Marty's hand hovered over the computer mouse. \n\n\nAt the police station, John instructed an officer to obtain the official files from Marty's accident for him. Afterward, he encountered Antonio and Sarah, who wanted to be briefed on Cristian's disappearance. John told them that the key to finding Cris depended on locating a guy named Ray Montez. Recounting his trip to Colombia, John told Antonio and Sarah that Cris had been held in prison under the name Montez, but was no longer an inmate. Sarah blamed herself for failing to stay by Cristian's side. Fearing that Cris was in trouble, Sarah and Antonio tried to figure out what had taken place in Colombia. John reminded them that Cris had managed to escape and believed that he would eventually contact them. \n\n\nAs they searched for information on the police terminal, Antonio and Sarah were shocked to learn that Ray Montez was actually in Llanview. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Ray barely escaped being noticed by Nora. Having arrived back in town after a long layover in Chicago, Nora was shocked to find Dallas dressed in Clint's robe and sleeping on the couch. After waking her, Nora was obviously upset to learn that Clint had invited Dallas to stay at the mansion. Alone with Clint, Nora expressed her displeasure over him moving in his ex. Attempting to deflect Nora's questioning, Clint asked her for a kiss. Nora had no interest in a kiss. Instead, she wanted to know how Clint's scheme against Dorian had progressed. \n\n\nRecounting the details of Langston's custody hearing, Clint informed Nora that Ray had threatened to take Langston to Colombia and Dorian had been jailed for contempt. Displeased with Clint's lack of compassion, Nora wondered if he felt any guilt over hurting Langston in his attempt to get revenge against Dorian. A defiant Clint stated that Ray would leave town without Langston if Dorian did his bidding - return Buchanan Enterprises back to the family. \n\n\nAt her residence in Plato, Colombia, Vanessa tried to make Cris feel at home. Upon learning that she didn't have an Internet connection or a working telephone, Cris reminded Vanessa that there were several people looking for him in Llanview. Unconcerned with Cris's dilemma, Vanessa told him that the power was out and she appeared to have an agenda. Cris demanded to know exactly what she wanted with him. Stating that she had lied about wanting to find Ray, Vanessa informed Cris that Ray wanted to kill her and that she needed Cris's help. \n\n\nConvinced that Vanessa had an ulterior motive, Cris accused her of lying to him. Claiming that Cris owed her, Vanessa reminded him that she had bought his way out of prison. Cris questioned who Ray was and how he had escaped from prison. Fed up with Vanessa's lies, Cris demanded the truth from her. Vanessa said that Ray was a terrible man who had threatened to kill her if he ever got out of prison. Begging for Cris's help, Vanessa told him that she needed to get as far away from Ray as possible. Vanessa asked Cris to take her to Llanview with him so that the three of them could be safe. Confused, Cris asked who the third person was. Vanessa called out to someone named Lola. A beautiful young girl appeared. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, Langston, Starr, Cole, and Markko gathered at the courthouse in time for Dorian's hearing. Planning to tell Dorian that Clint was responsible for bringing Ray to town, the teens expected to prevent Ray from taking Langston to Colombia. \n\n\nWhen Dorian was escorted into the courtroom, Langston and Starr greeted her. Apologizing for ruining Langston's custody hearing, Dorian embraced Langston and vowed that she wouldn't allow Ray to take Langton away from her. Cole related to Dorian that he had learned that Ray was working for Clint. Realizing that Clint was seeking revenge against her, Dorian promised the teens that she would handle both Clint and Uncle Ray. Before the hearing began, Starr and Dorian's lawyer reminded Dorian to show repentance in court. Unnoticed, Ray entered and sat in the back of the room. \n\n\nDorian apologized to the judge for her behavior, and was released. The judge urged her to accept his decision because it was final. As Dorian and Langston embraced, their reunion was cut short when Ray approached. When the teens tried to verbally attack Ray, Dorian curtailed them and announced that they were late for school. Acknowledging Ray as Langston's legal guardian, Dorian politely asked Montez if he would allow Langston to attend school with her friends one last time. Ray agreed, and the teens headed off to school. Alone with Dorian, Ray asked if she wanted to speak with him privately. A smug Dorian informed Ray that she didn't have anything to say to him, but she did intend to speak with the man who hired him. \n\n\nRay phoned Clint and informed him that Dorian had been released from jail and was aware of their connection. Clint told Ray not to worry, and promised to take care of Dorian. Before Clint could hang up the phone, Dorian entered the mansion and interrupted his conversation with Ray. Clint and Nora were stunned to find Dorian in their presence. In a confident tone, Dorian told Clint that she planned to take care of him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Roxy, Bo, and Layla gathered outside of Rex's room. Informing Roxy that Marcie had taken Shane to the cafeteria, Gigi approached and insisted on going in to visit Rex. She was surprised when Roxy told her that she couldn't see Rex because he had a visitor. Noting that Rex's entire family was already present, Gigi wondered if Rex was being examined by a specialist. When Layla stated that his entire family wasn't in the hall, Gigi peered into Rex's room and was shocked to see Adriana hovering over him. \n\n\nInside Rex's room, Adriana lovingly stroked Rex's hair and told him that everything would be okay because she was home. As Rex opened his eyes, a tearful Adriana recounted her last conversation with him. Remembering Rex announcing that he wanted a divorce and proclaiming his love for Gigi, Adriana told her husband that she was hurt by his words, but would always love him. When Rex tried to speak, Adriana prevented him from doing so. She told him that she would die if she ever lost him. \n\n\nMeanwhile, back in the hall, Gigi wanted to know why Adriana was in Rex's room. Admitting that she had contacted Adriana, Layla reminded Gigi that Adriana was Rex's wife. Feeling Gigi's pain, Roxy told her that they hadn't had a chance to warn her. Attempting to prevent an argument from ensuing, Bo reminded the women that they needed to focus on Rex waking up. As Bo tried to calm Gigi, Adriana stepped out into the hall and reported that Rex had opened his eyes. Walking towards the room, Gigi announced that she was going in to see Rex, but Adriana blocked her path. In a disgusted tone, Adriana remarked, \"I don't think so, Gigi!\" A catfight was avoided when Roxy returned with the doctor. When Adriana told him that Rex had regained consciousness, the doctor went in to examine Rex. \n\n\nExplaining that things had changed since Adriana was in town, Bo suggested that Adriana allow Gigi a moment with Rex. Adriana told Bo that he could visit with Rex, but Gigi couldn't. Citing that Brody shot Rex because of Gigi, Adriana blamed Gigi for the chain of events. Refusing to back down, Gigi reminded Adriana that she had unleashed Brody on them. \n\n\nAs the women argued, the doctor approached and announced that Rex had regained consciousness, but was still in critical condition. He related that Rex needed to remain in a calm and peaceful state. Gigi begged to see Rex, but Adriana ordered the doctor to refuse Gigi access to Rex. Although everyone appeared disappointed by Adriana's behavior, she wouldn't reverse her decision about Gigi. When Layla asked Adriana to reconsider, Adriana said that the sight of Gigi would make Rex remember being shot. Gigi countered that the sight of Adriana would remind Rex of all the terrible things she had done to keep them apart. Gigi told Adriana that she couldn't keep them apart forever, but Adriana was certain that she could. \n\n\nBo told Gigi that Shane could return at any moment and didn't need to be exposed to the situation between her and Adriana. For Shane's sake, Gigi agreed to leave, but told Adriana that Rex would eventually ask to see her. Gigi vowed to not allow Adriana to keep her from Rex. Moments later, Roxy exited Rex's room and said that he was trying to speak. Brushing past everyone, Adriana announced that Rex wanted his wife. \n\n\nBack at the police station, John recovered the files on Marty's accident. As he walked down the hall, he bumped into Cole, and the folder fell to the floor. When Cole reached down to help John retrieve the contents of the folder, he was startled to see a picture of his mother. Cole asked John what was going on.\n\n\n",
