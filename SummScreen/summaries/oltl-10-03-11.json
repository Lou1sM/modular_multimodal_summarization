He explained that he'd tossed the bomb into the pond. Tomas arrived as T\u00e9a and Starr also emerged from the next room and thanked Bo for saving their lives.\n\n\nEveryone took turns informing Tomas of Irene's release from jail, and Bo clarified that Irene had worked out some kind of deal with the Feds. Bo was satisfied that he would be able to have a new cause for which to arrest Irene, as everyone was certain she had planted the bomb. Tomas was concerned about the possibility of another bomb on the property, and Bo assured him that he'd checked around the estate. Bo had also contacted the bomb squad, and they were on the way.\n\n\nBlair begged Bo not to arrest Starr, and T\u00e9a pointed out that Starr had aided her father due to an imminent threat to the family. Bo suggested that T\u00e9a discuss motives in court, because he couldn't look the other way regarding Starr's action. Blair assured her daughter she'd be okay, and she leaned over to give Starr a hug.\n\n\nStarr began to whisper in Blair's ear. She advised her mother that the note Todd had read had ordered him to meet Irene at the docks, and he was probably there. Starr was worried about her father's safety. Bo led Starr out of the house, and T\u00e9a followed them. After the others were gone, Tomas asked Blair what Starr had said.\n\n\nBlair filled Tomas in quickly, and she urged him to hurry to the docks to save Todd from Irene. Tomas wondered why Blair hadn't told Bo about it. Blair didn't think that Bo would believe her, and besides, Bo had her daughter in handcuffs, among other things. Tomas reminded her that Bo was the police.\n\n\nFrantically, Blair stated that Tomas knew Irene, and he would be the best one to help Todd. Tomas maintained that Blair had changed since Todd's return, and he believed that Blair still had feelings for her ex-husband. He kissed her slowly, and then he headed for the door. Blair begged him to hurry.\n\n\nViki visited Natalie. She wondered if Natalie were doing the right thing by marrying Brody. Natalie stressed that she had no hope of getting back together with John, and they had been over ever since John had learned he wasn't Liam's father. \"What if he were Liam's father?\" Viki asked. She wondered if John would forgive the one night that Natalie had spent with Brody. Natalie reminded her that she'd also made a fool of John at their wedding.\n\n\nViki inquired whether John and Natalie would be able to trust each other again. Natalie thought they could, as they'd been through a lot together and they'd always understood each other. Natalie noted that John had always been quiet and private, but he had changed after Natalie's pregnancy.\n\n\nJohn had even carried around a stuffed animal from Seattle to Llanview, and she had even caught him smiling, Natalie reminisced. She hadn't wanted to ruin things. It no longer mattered, because John wasn't interested, and the baby was Brody's, Natalie added. Viki thought it was obvious that Natalie still loved John, and she didn't see the same kind of love between Natalie and Brody.\n\n\nViki inquired whether Natalie would still marry Brody if he weren't Liam's father. Natalie mentioned that she'd told Rex about a dream she'd had, and Viki was interested in hearing about it. Natalie tried to avoid telling her, but she finally gave in as Viki continued to pursue it. Natalie described how she'd dreamt that she'd woken up and had gone through her mail. There had been something important from the hospital, and it had turned out to be Liam's DNA test. She'd opened up the envelope.\n\n\n \"Except this time, John was Liam's father. Not Brody,\" Natalie concluded. It had just been a dream, she said. She tried to brush all thoughts of it aside, and she confessed that she should have told the truth when she'd first heard it. Viki thought it was a good idea to always tell the truth as early as possible, in order to avoid pain in the future.\n\n\nViki was sorry for Natalie who hadn't had any peace since the wedding. Natalie disagreed. She felt happy and had good times whenever she was with her son. She wasn't too certain she'd ever be able to fix things with Jessica though. Viki stated that she loved Natalie, but she still wondered if Brody made Natalie happy.\n\n\nNatalie felt that John had had his chance, and her son was the most important thing to her. Viki understood that Liam needed a father, and Natalie concurred that she only wanted to do what was best for her son. Viki agreed that Brody and Natalie had Liam in common, but she wanted more romance for her daughter.\n\n\nNatalie admitted that she would always love John, but he was just a memory. She and Brody were real, and she needed to focus on that. Viki thought it was a good idea for everyone to accept Brody and Natalie, though Natalie declared that she didn't want to force anyone into it.\n\n\nViki agreed that she would try to talk to Jessica. Natalie confessed that she was sorry about the things she'd said about Jessica's father, and Viki believed that Jessica also regretted some of the things she'd said to Natalie.\n\n\nLater, Natalie looked at a family photo of herself, Brody and Liam. She recalled the first time she'd read the DNA test results.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica picked up Tina's dog carrier and found a piece of paper protruding from it. She opened it up and began to read Liam's paternity test results. She was shocked to find that John was a match, not Brody. Before she was able to contemplate it any further, Brody walked into the kitchen and called out her name.\n\n\nBrody picked up on a jumpy Jessica, but she declared that she'd been startled when he'd arrived. Brody informed her that Todd had escaped from jail, and he wanted to check the premises for Todd's presence. Jessica gave him the okay even though he admitted that he didn't have a search warrant. Jessica didn't think that Todd would return to Llanfair.\n\n\nBrody headed upstairs, and Jessica returned to her perusal of the DNA test. She was confused. She thought it looked official, and she wondered why it was in Tina's dog carrier. Before she could think about it any further, Brody returned. He announced that he hadn't located Todd in the house, but he'd had the opportunity to look in on Ryder. The couple talked about the little boy briefly.\n\n\nJessica wanted to talk to Brody about something, but he advised her that he was busy with the hunt for Todd. He defended Natalie, and he ordered Jessica to grow up and move on. He stormed out of the house.\n\n\n\"Have you tracked down our fugitive, Todd Manning?\" the mayor asked John at the police station. He admitted that he hadn't had a chance to brief his unit, and the mayor noted that she was concerned about the approaching elections. She didn't want to have a murderer on the loose.\n\n\nThe mayor also questioned John about Todd's assistance from Starr, and she noted how happy she was to hear that Jack had called the station to report that Starr and Todd were at the Manning house. She was pleased that there was at least one law-abiding family member. She ordered John to be careful about which cops he chose to aid him in Todd's pursuit. \"Only use people that you trust with your life,\" she told him.\n\n\nIrene held a gun on a prone Todd as he bled from the shoulder wound she'd already given him. Suddenly, she heard an explosion, and she smiled. \"That was the sound of your family dying,\" she told her son. Victor's house had blown up. \"They're all dead Todd. Just like mother promised,\" she advised him.\n\n\nIrene further explained that she had inherited Todd's fortune through Victor's will, and she was certain that the family would have attempted to steal it from her. She couldn't have that, so she'd placed a bomb at the house. \"Bye-bye, Blair,\" Irene said. She continued to name all of the family members one by one. Todd was upset and accused her of lying. He cried out that it wasn't possible, but Irene advised him that he would get to join them.\n\n\nIrene said goodbye to Todd and apologized for her impending action. She'd always thought that Todd had potential. Todd had one question for her, and he inquired how she'd been able to give him away to Peter Manning. Irene admitted that she'd thought it would be good for her cousin to have some responsibility. She confessed that she'd made a mistake.\n\n\nTodd was outraged that she'd treated him like no more than a dog, and he managed to push her and knock her down. The pair wrestled on the ground and struggled over the gun. Todd emerged the victor, and he trained the gun on Irene as she remained on the ground. His shoulder wound was bleeding profusely.  \"I hate your guts,\" Todd proclaimed. \"Now, now. I am your mother,\" Irene chided.\n\n\n\"What kind of mother tortures her own kid?\" Todd inquired. Irene taunted him, and she declared that Todd would never shoot her. Todd fooled her, and he shot her in the stomach. Irene was stunned. \"I underestimated you, Todd,\" Irene confessed. \"Not for the first time,\" she added. She compared Todd to his father, and she called him ruthless.\n\n\n\"Keep it up. I'll just shoot you again,\" Todd threatened. Irene advised him that he'd be locked up for killing both Victor and herself. Todd swore that he hadn't killed Victor, but he thought that Irene's death would be a public service. Irene advised him that he wouldn't be rid of her, but then she looked down at all of the blood. She fell over. She appeared to be dead. Todd kicked her foot, and then he fell to the ground too.\n\n\nBo and Starr arrived at the station, and the mayor praised Bo for saving lives. John and Bo agreed that Irene had been the one responsible for the bomb, but the mayor indicated that she believed Todd had been the one to set it up. Starr took exception to the mayor's accusation, and the mayor asked Starr about Todd's whereabouts. T\u00e9a walked in and accused the mayor of questioning Starr without her lawyer present.\n\n\nBo and John stepped aside and again agreed that Irene would be the person they were searching for regarding the bomb. Blair arrived, and the mayor suggested that Blair might be a co-conspirator in the case. T\u00e9a requested that the mayor be kept away from her clients, and Bo proposed that the mayor might want to keep politics out of the way.\n\n\nBlair announced that Starr had saved the family, and the mayor grabbed onto the statement. She pointed out that Blair had indicated that Starr was guilty of helping her father to escape. T\u00e9a thanked her lucky stars that there was a jury system in place, while once again, the mayor thought that things should be focused on the man responsible for almost blowing everyone up.\n\n\nBo repeated that Irene was the suspect. Quickly, the mayor changed the subject and wondered why Starr hadn't been booked yet. Brody returned to the station and saw John, and he began to say something about his engagement. Cutting him off, John announced that he already knew, and he congratulated Brody. John was more concerned with police business, and he'd received a phone call that shots had been fired at the docks. He asked Brody to accompany him there.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Blair stepped out of earshot of the mayor. T\u00e9a figured the mayor would probably brag about jailing a college student, but Starr had nothing to worry about, because Starr had the best attorney in town. Blair voiced her concern about Todd, and she told T\u00e9a what Starr had whispered to her at the house. Blair confessed that she'd sent Tomas to the docks.\n\n\n\"You sent my brother after that maniac?\" T\u00e9a asked angrily. Blair thought that Tomas had been the perfect person for the mission. \"You have a better idea? He's a trained operative. He used to work for Irene. Who's better to stop her than him?\" Blair insisted. \"You've got a point,\" T\u00e9a agreed. \"Why have an agent in the family if he can't step up when you need him?\" Blair added. She thought that Dani needed to have the opportunity to get to know her father.\n\n\nA handcuffed Starr returned to the office. Blair was angry that she had been fingerprinted, but Bo explained that it was standard procedure. T\u00e9a wondered if they would be able to move the case along quickly, and Bo replied that he was doing the best that he could. The mayor checked back with Bo, and she ordered him to escort Starr to her jail cell. The mayor didn't want the family to receive any special treatment.\n\n\nBlair lost her temper, but the mayor responded that Starr was a flight risk and an accused felon. \"Todd Manning's daughter stays locked up until further notice,\" the mayor commanded. Starr's only concern was for her father.\n\n\nJessica didn't know what to do with the information she had found. Viki returned to Llanfair, and she asked how Jessica felt. Jessica hoped that she felt better than Natalie. Viki announced that Natalie had been sorry, and Viki had something to say too. Viki had done some thinking, and she'd realized that she'd never proven to Victor how much she'd loved him.\n\n\nViki had lost her chance, but she'd decided she would try to make things right with Tina. Viki was aware that it was difficult to forgive, but one could lose the chance if they didn't try. \"I'll think about it,\" Jessica retorted. Viki decided to check on Ryder, and once she was gone, Jessica looked at the test results again. Shortly after, Viki returned to the kitchen and called out to Jessica, but Jessica was gone.\n\n\nTomas arrived at the docks and found Todd with the gun. \"What happened?\" he asked Todd. \"I murdered my mother,\" Todd replied. Tomas walked over to Irene and leaned over her. \"She's definitely dead,\" Tomas announced. \"Told you,\" Todd retorted. Tomas wished that Todd would have picked a less conspicuous time to kill Irene, but he didn't blame him. \"She murdered my family,\" Todd declared. He mentioned the bomb.\n\n\nTomas assured Todd that everyone was fine, and that Bo had tossed the bomb into the pond. Todd couldn't believe it. He groaned loudly, obviously in lots of pain. \"I'm going to fry for this, aren't I?\" Todd asked. Tomas promised that he wouldn't let that happen, and he thought it had been self-defense. Todd proclaimed that everyone had thought he'd killed his brother, but Irene had gotten rid of the evidence. Suddenly, they heard sirens.\n\n\nTodd couldn't believe that he was about to be locked up again after eight years. His freedom had been short-lived. Tomas grabbed the gun, and pushed Todd's hand up to the injured shoulder, advising him to apply pressure. \"Maybe there's another way out of this,\" Tomas stated.\n\n\nBrody and John arrived and found Tomas alone and with the gun. Brody held his gun pointed at Tomas. \"Again, Delgado?\" John asked. \"All right, tell me what happened,\" he said to Tomas. \"I finally killed Irene Manning,\" Tomas replied.\n\n\nNatalie decided that she should occupy her time with what was real. \"John will never be Liam's father,\" she said to herself. Jessica approached the apartment with the DNA test in hand.\n\n\n",
