    "soap_central": "\n\nUpstairs at Todd's house, Starr helped Dani to pack her things even though Dani stated that she didn't want to go with Ross. Starr revealed that Todd had tried everything he could think of to stop Ross, but he hadn't been successful. He loved Dani \"so, so much,\" Starr added. Dani reminisced about the fun things she had done in Tahiti and stated that she was going back to \"Paradise.\" She tried to look at the positive side of it briefly, but she admitted that she would trade it in a \"heartbeat\" for the chance to remain in Llanview. \n\n\nDani wondered why Greg had lied at her custody hearing when she knew perfectly well that T\u00e9a had wanted her to stay with Todd and not Ross. Starr suggested that maybe T\u00e9a would be able to send them a miracle from beyond the grave. Dani was also concerned that Nate hadn't shown up to say goodbye. Starr was surprised that Dani's boyfriend hadn't appeared, and she wondered if something was going on. Dani admitted that Nate had confided that he planned on \"fixing things.\"\n\n\nDownstairs, Todd received a phone call from a woman, and he was positive that it was T\u00e9a. \"Todd?\" T\u00e9a asked weakly. \"T\u00e9a, is that you?\" Todd replied. The call ended abruptly, and in shock, he told Blair about the call. She did her best to convince him that T\u00e9a was dead, and he had been mistaken.  \n\n\nNate finally arrived but the cops on duty outside of the house prevented him from going inside. He argued with them loudly as James managed to climb a tree and bang on Dani's bedroom window. The girls were stunned to see him, and Starr began to berate him for going to extremes and tracking her down. James quickly clarified that he was helping Nate, and he was there for Dani. He explained that he believed that when two people were meant to be together, one should do whatever was needed in order to make it happen. \n\n\nNate continued to argue with the cops and he began to hammer loudly on the front door. Finally, Blair opened it and persuaded the cops to allow Nate to enter the house. They agreed but only with the condition that they accompany Nate. This time Blair began to argue with them. She told them, \"Three's a crowd.\" After threatening to call Bo, the cops relented, and Nate ran upstairs. \n\n\nAt the Cherryvale clinic, the nurse grabbed her phone from T\u00e9a's hand, just as T\u00e9a had placed her call to Todd. The nurse asked how T\u00e9a had gotten hold of the phone and scolded her. She reminded T\u00e9a that Dr. Evans had given strict instructions that the phone was not permitted. T\u00e9a was upset and was certain that Greg would have allowed it. \"Why is he doing this?\" she asked. She grew hysterical and begged the nurse for help. Just then, the phone began to ring. The nurse ran out of the room to answer it. It was Todd and he wanted to know who had called him from the nurse's telephone number.\n\n\nThe nurse claimed she had dialed a wrong number, but Todd insisted that the voice sounded like his wife's. The nurse apologized for the call and hung up. Todd was in shock and told Blair that he had spoken to a woman who gave him \"bull.\" He was positive he had heard from T\u00e9a, and he pointed out that they had never seen her body. Blair reminded him that T\u00e9a had been cremated, but Todd noted that while Greg had told them that, Greg had lied about other things also. \n\n\nBlair was sure that Todd's mind was playing tricks on him, and nothing would change. T\u00e9a would not be returning from the dead to make things right, she informed Todd. He was certain that his mind was fine. \n\n\nNate ran into Dani's room and urged his girlfriend to slide down the tree outside of her room and leave with James. At the same time, Ross arrived at the house to take Dani with him. Blair pleaded with him to allow Dani to stay, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. Ross coldly reminded her that Todd had upset him and tried to kill him. Blair suggested an alternative arrangement, one that would have both fathers sharing custody of Dani. She proclaimed that Todd would buy Ross a house or a boat or anything that Ross wanted. She promised that Todd would never lay a hand on Ross again. \n\n\nWhen that didn't work, Blair began to beg for Ross to do what T\u00e9a wanted. She remembered a different Ross, one that wanted to see T\u00e9a happy. She asked that he honor T\u00e9a's memory. Ross merely rolled his eyes. He felt sure that T\u00e9a would want him to do what was best for Dani.\n\n\nUpstairs, Dani hesitated at Nate's suggestion. Starr jogged Dani's memory. Dani didn't want to go with Ross, Starr said. Dani didn't want to hurt Ross, and she remembered how he had lost it the last time she ran away. James, Nate and Starr did their best to convince Dani to go along with Nate's plan. Starr asked if Dani wanted to go away forever and leave Nate. Suddenly, Starr had an idea. She wondered if Dani would like Starr to go with her. \n\n\nBlair stopped Ross from going upstairs. She advised him she would check on Dani. As she went upstairs, Starr descended the stairs and stopped to tell Ross off. When she finished speaking her piece, Starr declared that she had to return home. Ross wanted to go upstairs, but Blair returned and demanded that he allow Dani to say goodbye to her boyfriend. Shortly after, Nate walked down the stairs and announced that Dani was finishing up her packing. Ross rushed upstairs with Blair. \n\n\nDestiny insisted on leaving Rodi's with Shaun in order to visit the Cherryvale clinic where Greg was working with a patient. She was sure that Greg was in trouble. Shaun advised her that he would \"deal\" with their brother alone, even though Destiny pointed out that she had been the first one who was \"on to\" Greg. Shaun disagreed, but he managed to get some help when Darren showed up. Darren believed that Destiny was upset about Dani leaving, and she was taking it out on Shaun by being argumentative and difficult.\n\n\nShaun and Destiny wondered what Greg was up to, and Destiny suggested that Greg might even be on drugs which were causing his odd behavior. Darren proposed that Destiny allow Shaun to handle an investigation of Greg alone, and the two of them could head to the airport to see Dani off. Shaun promised to keep Destiny updated. He imagined he might even learn something in Cherryvale that would change things for Dani.\n\n\nAfter Shaun was gone, Destiny told Darren about Greg's testimony at Dani's custody hearing and the lie he had told. She divulged how successful Greg had been in the past and how he had always made her feel special because she was his sister. She believed that Greg was in trouble with the cops and exclaimed that Darren's brother could be arresting her brother at that very moment. Destiny stated that her brother had never been in trouble before, though Darren believed it was possible that he just hadn't been caught.\n\n\nDestiny believed that Greg had lied on the stand for a reason. Darren related that big brothers were cool, but they made mistakes too. His own brother had righted his own mistakes. He changed the subject when Destiny attempted to pursue it and announced he was ready to go to the airport. Destiny mentioned that she had hated Dani at first for stealing Matthew, but she liked her after all. She found it difficult to admit that Dani would be leaving. Darren wanted her to cry so that he could look after her. \n\n\nJohn and Price found an unconscious Greg laying on the floor of a room in the St. Kitts hospice. Detective Price rushed out, hoping to catch a glimpse of Eli. The hospice doctors worked over Greg until they revived him. They rushed him to the intensive care unit. John showed a picture of Eli to a nurse, and she confirmed that he had been the patient in the room and had been there for weeks. Greg had only allowed a limited amount of people into the room. John sent out an all points bulletin on Eli. \n\n\nPrice returned without news of Eli. He wondered if the criminal would try to get in touch with Ross. John presumed Eli would do so when it was safe. Price hoped that no one would get in Eli's way, and John pointed out that it looked like Greg already had. The doctor returned and informed the detectives that Greg had received a lethal dose of morphine. He wasn't on the way to recovery yet. John ordered road blocks. He began to think that everything was involved with T\u00e9a's death and her daughter in some way. \n\n\nCharlie opened the front door of Llanfair to see a woman standing there. She threw her arms around him and called him Chuckles. She was thrilled to see him. Viki walked into the foyer and saw them. As the woman reminisced about old times, Charlie turned to introduce the two women to each other. He was shocked to hear that Viki and Echo DiSavoy already knew each other. \"Viki and I go way back,\" Echo announced. \"Echo slept with my husband,\" Viki retorted. Charlie was perplexed. \"Which one?\" he asked. Viki told him it was Clint, and Echo claimed that Clint had been the one to do the seducing. She had fallen in love with him. The women flashed back to the long ago scene when they'd had words with each other. \n\n\nCharlie explained that he and Echo had been friends in Atlantic City long ago, but Echo urged him to be honest, because Viki would find out the truth eventually. Echo blurted the truth herself and proclaimed that she and Charlie had been lovers. \"Looks like I slept with two of your husbands Viki,\" Echo observed. Charlie quickly made it clear that it had been long before he met Viki. She was still feeling the \"sting\" of Viki running her out of town, Echo added, though Chuckles and vodka had made her feel better. Both Charlie and Viki asked why she was back in town. \n\n\nEcho explained that she had looked Chuckles up on the internet and couldn't believe he was married to the same Viki she knew. Quietly infuriated, Viki stated that Clint was the one who knew her. Echo wanted to \"kill two birds with one stone\" with her visit. This prompted Viki to call Echo a predator. Echo continued that she was there to both check on Chuckles and apologize for the past. She wanted to make sure he was okay after their wild life in Atlantic City, and she wanted to \"bury the hatchet\" with Viki. She felt bad for all that had happened. Viki told her she had just apologized and dismissed her abruptly. Echo declared that she wanted to \"right the wrong\" because she used to have manners. Viki wryly stated that Echo used to claim to be a countess too. \n\n\nCharlie asked that he and Viki be given time to think about Echo's appearance, and Echo suggested they all meet for drinks. Charlie advised her that both he and Viki didn't drink any longer, but Echo didn't care if they only had tea. She insisted on taking a photo of the couple, and she told them how lucky they were. She informed them she'd be in touch, and she left. Charlie thought it was all \"some coincidence.\" \"Oh yes, some big coincidence,\" Viki replied. \n\n\nThe nurse returned to T\u00e9a's room after the brief phone call with Todd. She was afraid that she would lose her job if she didn't follow the doctor's orders, she explained to T\u00e9a. He had been angry previously when she had asked him about T\u00e9a using the phone. T\u00e9a asked to speak to Greg herself, but the nurse explained that he wasn't there. Shaun arrived looking for Greg and another nurse suggested that he try T\u00e9a's room. \n\n\nHe headed there as T\u00e9a's nurse emerged from the room. She advised him that she thought Greg was out of town when Shaun asked to see his brother. He asked to speak to the patient but the nurse refused to allow it. The woman couldn't have contact with anyone except for her caregivers. Shaun thought that was unusual. Inside the room, T\u00e9a began to wonder why Todd sounded surprised to hear from her. She cried out for someone to help her. \n\n\nShaun attempted to call Greg and was confused when Price answered Greg's phone. The detective advised Shaun that he couldn't give him any details, but Greg had been badly injured and might not make it. Shaun was devastated though he looked around when he heard \"Somebody help me,\" from T\u00e9a's room. He didn't pursue it. Instead, he headed back to Rodi's. T\u00e9a was hysterical again and the nurse gave her a sedative. \n\n\nDetective Price was upset because it had been difficult to divulge the information about Greg to Shaun. John hoped that Greg lived. John declared that Greg had answers to the questions that they didn't know to ask. \n\n\nDestiny tried to call Shaun but she was unable to reach him. Suddenly, he walked through the door of Rodi's and found that Destiny and Darren were still there. Reluctantly, he gave them the bad news. Destiny began to cry. \n\n\nA musical montage showed a forlorn Todd sitting with T\u00e9a's ashes, T\u00e9a removing the sedative from her mouth after the nurse was gone, and Blair and Ross finding an empty bedroom. The kids were gone. \n\n\nJames, Dani and Starr were thrilled to get to James's apartment sight unseen. Dani threw her arms around the others and James's hand accidentally touched Starr's hand. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "A \"lady friend\" of Charlie's pays him a surprise visit and it turns out she's Echo, an old adversary of Viki's, who slept with Clint years ago when he was Viki's husband. And low and behold, Viki learns that Charlie and this woman used to be \"involved\". Meanwhile, Nate convinces James to help him enable Dani to escape before Ross takes her to Tahiti. Starr is also there for them. Yet, Eli has escaped and may be on the loose after injecting Greg with a lethal dose when he tries to convince him that he needs surgery. Greg is critical and they are not sure if he's going to make it. Tea is stuck in her hospital room helpless to get out or know where Todd is and doesn't know why she cannot call him.",
