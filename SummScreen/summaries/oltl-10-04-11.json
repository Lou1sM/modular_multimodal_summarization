John asked Tomas what had happened. \"I finally killed Irene,\" Tomas replied. John felt Irene's pulse, and determined that she was dead. Tomas revealed that he was ready to make a full confession, but John demanded to know where Todd was. Tomas hadn't seen Todd, and related that if Todd had been there, he'd been there before Tomas had arrived.\n\n\nJohn wondered if Tomas had stumbled upon Irene's body during a walk. Tomas claimed that he'd been looking for Irene. He continued that he'd found Irene, wrestled the gun away from her, and shot her. John warned Tomas that if Tomas was lying, he'd just be making things worse for Todd instead of better. John told Brody to widen the perimeter of the search for Todd while John escorted Tomas to the station.\n\n\nT\u00e9a hung up the phone, and told Blair that she couldn't get Starr out of jail because of the mayor. Blair was so furious about Todd involving Starr in his plan to get out of jail that Blair swiped piles of papers off the desk in front of her. T\u00e9a forced Blair to help clean up the papers, and advised her to behave until T\u00e9a could get Starr out of jail.\n\n\nBlair confided that she was afraid Irene would finish Todd off, \"before I get a crack at him.\" She related that it was \"classic Todd\" to make everyone feel sorry for him, and then do something stupid. T\u00e9a wondered why she and Blair kept going back to Todd. Blair swore it was because of the kids, but T\u00e9a knew that the kids weren't the explanation.\n\n\nT\u00e9a confessed that Tomas thought Blair still had feelings for Todd. She informed Blair that Tomas liked Blair, and Blair confirmed that she liked him as well. T\u00e9a again wondered why she and Blair kept running to Todd's rescue. Blair answered that they did because no one else would. John entered with a handcuffed Tomas, and Blair and T\u00e9a demanded to know why. John told them that Tomas had claimed to be a murderer, but T\u00e9a advised her brother not to say anything else. Tomas told her it was too late, because he'd already confessed to killing Irene.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked for a minute with her client. John hoped she could handle the large caseload she'd taken on. John told an officer to start Tomas' booking process, and left. T\u00e9a demanded to know what had happened. Blair asked about Todd, so Tomas told her that Todd had been shot in the shoulder. He advised one of the women to get to Todd before he bled out. Blair wondered where Todd had gone, but Tomas had no idea.\n\n\nT\u00e9a pulled Blair aside, and told her that Blair needed to find Todd. Blair thought that Todd should get himself out of trouble, because he was the one who'd gotten himself into trouble. Blair wondered what would happen if she couldn't find him. T\u00e9a needed to be at the station on behalf of Tomas and Starr. Blair was worried that John would find Todd before she could. As Tomas listened in, T\u00e9a told Blair that she needed to step up, because she knew Todd better than anyone.\n\n\nT\u00e9a returned to her brother. She needed to prepare Tomas for John's interrogation. T\u00e9a wondered why Todd would have run away if Tomas had been the one to shoot Irene. Suddenly, it dawned on her that \"you didn't shoot Irene. Todd did.\"\n\n\nJessica held Natalie's paternity test results behind her back as Natalie answered the door. Natalie told her sister that she didn't have the energy \"to go another round.\" Jessica told Natalie that they needed to talk, and that it was \"now or never.\" Just then, Liam started to cry, so Natalie invited Jessica in. Jessica put the results into her purse as Natalie returned to the room with Liam.\n\n\nJessica apologized for what she'd said to Natalie, and admitted that she'd crossed the line. Natalie agreed that she'd crossed the line too. She knew that blood didn't make family. \"Except it does,\" Jessica replied to a confused Natalie. Jessica went on about how DNA could also make a family, until Natalie got a phone call. It was the police station, so she took it. She told the caller that she'd be right there.\n\n\nNatalie regretfully informed Jessica that their talk would have to wait. There had been a body found at the docks, and Natalie had to go because the station was shorthanded. Natalie was about to call Roxy to watch Liam, but Jessica offered to watch Liam for Natalie. She assured a concerned Natalie that Viki, Clint, Tina, and Cord were with her own sleeping children. Jessica promised that she had been as surprised as Natalie was about Tina and Cord being back. Jessica went on that she would love to spend time with her nephew.\n\n\nNatalie gave Jessica a few basic instructions, and promised she'd only be gone a couple hours. She thanked Jessica very sincerely, and left. Jessica picked up Liam, and looked at the test results. Jessica told Liam that she didn't know what to do, and tried to reason it out. She wondered who would want to fake the results. If the results were real, she knew that Brody would lose both Natalie and Liam. She knew that Natalie and John would get back together, and that Natalie would have everything, \"and I'll have nothing.\"\n\n\nJessica knew that Liam didn't care what happened, as long as he had parents. She realized that if she kept the secret, she would be no better than Clint. She knew that, no matter what she decided, someone would get hurt. She wished that Natalie had left Brody alone so Natalie would be with John, and Jessica would be with Brody, so things would be \"how they're supposed to be.\"\n\n\nNatalie arrived at the scene, and Brody was surprised to see her on her night off. She saw Irene's body, and wondered if the family knew. Brody didn't know, but wondered who was watching Liam. Natalie assured him that Jessica, who had stopped by to apologize, was watching Liam. He was surprised, because Jessica hadn't been nice to him when he'd stopped by Llanfair, looking for Todd.\n\n\nNatalie started to examine Irene. She determined that she'd been shot at close range, so she had most likely known the shooter. Brody replied that Tomas had confessed, but John didn't believe him. She realized that there was only one bullet in Irene, but that there were two bullet casings. Brody replied that Tomas hadn't been shot. She noticed blood on the dumpster, and didn't think it was Irene's because of the angle of the blood.\n\n\nJohn arrived, and asked about what had been found. Natalie explained all of her findings to him, and said that the blood on the dumpster probably belonged to the shooter. John was sure that the blood was Todd's.\n\n\nIn her jail cell, Starr realized that Todd had been in the cell the last time she'd been there. James entered, and told her about a news report he'd heard on the radio about her breaking Todd out of jail. Starr answered that she'd do it all over again. He knew that she'd be in a lot of trouble, but she informed him that Irene had threatened her entire family. He wondered why she hadn't gone to him for help, but she hadn't wanted to involve him.\n\n\nJames wondered what Starr wanted him to do. He offered to go out looking for Todd, and to spend time with Hope. She asked him to stay safe, and not to take any risks. She also wanted to know if there had been any developments in finding Todd. He told her that he'd be right back, and walked out. He returned a short while later, and told her that there was no news. Starr felt that something bad had happened. James told her to focus on the positives, like that facts that she was smart, and James wasn't in jail. Between the two of them, he knew they could get something done. Starr wanted James to help her clear Todd's name.\n\n\nTodd stumbled up the front steps of Viki's cabin, and was frustrated to find that it was locked. He found a key in a flowerpot, and entered the cabin. He sat on the floor, and figured that there were worse places to die. He realized that if he didn't die there, Viki would kill him for bleeding all over her cabin. He tried to stand up, but couldn't. He heard someone walk down the stairs, and was shocked to see Irene.\n\n\n\"I killed you,\" Todd said. \"Yet here I am,\" Irene replied. He yelled that she couldn't hurt him anymore, but she proceeded to poke Todd's gunshot wound, and he cried out in pain. Irene assured Todd that she and Victor \"are saving you a seat.\" She thought that people would be relieved to find out that Todd was dead, but she promised Todd that he would be with Irene and Victor for eternity.\n\n\nTodd replied that he wasn't going anywhere, and that he only had a scratch. However, Irene knew it \"won't be long. A mother knows these things.\" She told Todd that no one was on their way to help him. He told her that she was wrong, and that his family loved him. She thought that his family would be more than happy to replace him, like they had with Victor. As Todd made his way over to Viki's phone, Irene estimated that he had twenty minutes left to live.\n\n\nTodd crawled across the floor towards the phone as Irene instructed him to give up. Irene held out her hand to him, and advised him to take it in order to make all of his troubles go away. Todd laid his head on her hand, but grabbed the phone, and fell on the floor. Todd told her to go to hell. \"I'll see you there,\" Irene said, and she disappeared. Todd looked at the phone and whimpered. \"I don't know the number!\" he wailed.\n\n\nA short while later, Blair burst into the cabin. She was grief-stricken to find an unconscious Todd bleeding on the floor.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica goes to see Natalie with the document she found in Tina's purse that names John as Liam's father instead of Brody. Knowing that this could ruin her sister's relationship with Jessica's ex fianc\u00e9, she knows she can't ignore it. But when Natalie is courteous to her and she sees that it could also affect baby Liam, Jessica does not show Natalie the document. She also realizes that it may be false. Natalie then gets called into work and helps John with the investigation of the murder of Irene Manning while Jessica watches baby Liam in her absence. Jessica tells her infant nephew she's not certain what to do but concludes that lying is not going to benefit anybody so she must let the truth be known. Todd finds his way to Viki's carriage house and crawls on the floor bloody, in pain and fatally wounded after being shot. He sees the ghost of Irene telling him he's all alone and going to die before anybody in his family notices or does anything about it. Starr is in jail which makes Blair furious at Todd and unmotivated to help him for putting their daughter up to doing his dirty work for him. But she reluctantly goes to see him after he's passed out and near death while Tea stays behind and represents both Starr and Tomas who are in trouble with the cops.",
