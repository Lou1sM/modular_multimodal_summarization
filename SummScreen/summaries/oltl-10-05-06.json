Michael assured Natalie that she was family, but they hadn't wanted to upset her. Eve asked her to please stay. Natalie asked what they were planning for the funeral. Michael said there would be an honor guard from the Llanview Police Department and bagpipes. After choosing the casket, which was very difficult, she exited and ran into Cris in Angel Square. She then sat on a park bench and tried not to cry as Vince almost interrupted her reverie.\n\n\nIn the ICU, Kelly visited Hugh as Paige watched from afar. Kelly started to cry when she talked to Paige about how successful Hugh had become. \"I wish I had told him [I was his mother] sooner,\" Paige said wistfully. Kelly assured Paige that Hugh would pull through. Kelly told Paige how Hugh had helped her get through the beginning of her pregnancy. \"You son is a beautiful, beautiful man,\" Kelly said through the tears.\n\n\nVince tried to convince Cristian to stop trying to get the boxing commission to change its mind. Cris reminded Vincent that his reputation was ruined. \"The last thing I need from you is bad PR,\" barked Vincent. Vincent said Cris needed to accept the situation and move on. Cris wasn't that sure and stormed out of his own apartment. Vincent pounded the door after Cris left.\n\n\nEvangeline loved the story Todd had published about John McBain. \"John is one of the reasons I'm sitting here,\" Todd said, but he added, \"He wasn't an easy guy to like.\" \"Like you,\" Evangeline said as she smiled. Evangeline grabbed Todd's hand when Blair slithered in and smirked. Evangeline told Blair that she and Todd were having a private conversation. Blair said she was there to talk to Todd about their children.\n\n\nEvangeline left, and Blair slipped into her seat. They needed to figure out where Jack and Starr were going to live. Todd wondered if Blair would sue for custody but then sniped that she could always just sleep with the judge. Blair stated that she wanted to move back into the penthouse, and she wanted their lives to be the way they had been two years before, the way they were supposed to be. \"Marry me, Todd,\" she said bluntly.\n\n\nAntonio and Bo were overwhelmed with the volume of flowers that were being delivered for John. Antonio and Bo talked about John. \"One of the best cops I ever met,\" Antonio said. Bo pointed out that John was gone while Spencer Truman was sitting in a cell, trying to get away with murder. Bo and Antonio vowed that wouldn't happen.\n\n\nEvangeline headed to the police station and asked Bo if he would go through John's office with her. Evangeline had just been retained as the lawyer for the McBain family, and apparently, John had not left a will. Evangeline was hoping they might find something in his office, but she felt awkward going through the office alone. Bo and Evangeline decided to start with the file cabinet. Later, a grief-stricken Bo sat in John's office as Evangeline ran into Cris's arms.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd and Evangeline sit in the diner and they talk about John and what a wonderful guy he was. Evangeline feels that Todd has a lot of those great qualities that John had. She touches his hand. Blair is outside and she sees the two with touching hands. She sidles in and drops her purse hard on the table. Evangeline tells her that they were having a private conservation. Blair would like to have a private conversation with Todd now. Evangeline leaves and Blair tells him that they have to decide where their children are going to live. Todd sees no problem. He just wanted joint custody. Blair isn't going to give him that. If he wants equal control of the children, then she will give it to him only if he lets her move back into the penthouse and marries her. He can't forget that Margaret started something but then Blair kept the ball rolling. She reminds him of the earth-shattering love they made last. He says that he might not feel anything for her anymore. Natalie shows up at the funeral home, displeased that she wasn't asked to come with them to set up the funeral. Marcie, Michael and Eve didn't mean to shut her out. She gets involved and makes some decisions but Michael feels that her being there is a mistake. She suddenly leaves and heads to the park. She is pissed that John is in a place where there are so many flowers, the man hated flowers. Cristian is there but leaves when she tells that there isn't anything that he can do for her. Vincent comes over and has words of wisdom but she doesn't believe them. She knows that he hated John. He says that the man is dead and everything else is irrelevant. He knows that she is in pain but hopes that soon the pain will turn to happiness so that she will be able to have the chance to love again. Evangeline goes to Bo and asks if they can go and look in John's office to see if he left a Will. They search the room and find that John was very sentimental. He kept photos of family in his desk After Natalie leaves, the McBains make the rest of the decisions and finally decide on a photo that will be used on the flyers for the funeral. Bo is alone in John's office now and he turns out the light and stays in the room. Soon his body is shaking from his sobbing. Natalie stays in the park alone and cries, Vincent sees her but chooses to leave her be this time. He can see that she is hurting. He turns and walks off.",
