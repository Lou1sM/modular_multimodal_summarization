    "soap_central": "\nA Tale of Two Husbands\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, David was shocked when Dorian announced that she wanted him to pose as her gay campaign manager, in an attempt to advance her campaign for mayor.  Initially, David refused to go along with Dorian's plan, but Dorian convinced David that it was in his best interest to do her bidding.\n\n\nAs David attempted to change Dorian's mind, a knock on the door interrupted their conversation.  Dorian let out a gasp when she discovered a woman on her doorstep, who bore a striking resemblance to Mel, the apparition that Dorian often witnessed when she performed an unscrupulous act.   Certain that Mel's arrival was a result of Dorian's latest campaign plot, Dorian admitted that she had attempted to bribe David into pretending to be gay so that she would capture the gay and lesbian vote.\n\n\nTo Dorian's surprise, the woman announced that her name was Amelia Bennett.  Amelia stated that she was a lesbian and wanted to work on Dorian's campaign.  Upon observing Amelia's impressive credentials, Dorian immediately demoted David and offered Amelia the job as her campaign manager.  When a suspicious David objected, Amelia offered to work as David's assistant, but Dorian was adamant that Amelia was the perfect person for the job.\n\n\nAfterward, Amelia stood alone in Dorian's foyer and exclaimed, \"That was easier than I thought!\"\n\n\nInside John's office, Brody and John shared their suspicions about Jared with Jessica.  John and Brody were convinced that Jared was in cahoots with the stalker.   John admitted that he was concerned about Natalie's safety.  Jessica argued that Jared would never manipulate Natalie, but Brody believed that Jared's plan was to convince everyone that he was a victim.   Jessica became alarmed when John stated that he had no idea of what Jared's next move would be.\n\n\nWhen Jessica continued to question Jared's possible motive, John explained that the stalker was a man named Wayne Landers, who was released from Statesville Prison. That release coincided with Jessica's first sighting of Nash.  Reminding Brody that Jared was his friend, Jessica wondered if Brody was convinced of Jared's guilt.  Admitting that he didn't have all the answers, Brody informed Jessica that Jared had been behaving suspiciously.  Terrified for her sister's safety, Jessica rushed off to alert Natalie.  Instructing Brody to stick close to Jessica and Natalie, John asked Brody to observe Jared's reaction to the news that Jared and the stalker had been prison mates.  Brody rushed off to catch up with Jessica.\n\n\nOn the terrace at Llanfair, a frightened Natalie observed Jared kneeling over the dead body of the stalker.  Jared claimed that he had discovered the body moments before Natalie's arrival.  Picking up a cement plaster a few feet away from the body, Jared said he believed the plaster was the murder weapon.  Natalie shrieked, \"Jared, why did you pick that up?\"  Jared screamed, \"I don't know what I was thinking!\"\n\n\nJared wondered if Natalie thought he was guilty.  Admitting that his actions looked suspicious, Natalie related that she believed her husband, but worried that John wouldn't because Jared's fingerprints were on the murder weapon.   Natalie attempted to phone the police, but Jared suggested that they come up with an alternate plan.  Natalie convinced Jared that their only hope was to contact the police.  The thought of John discovering the dead body, sent Jared into a panic, but Natalie advised him that she intended to go over John's head.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Nora informed Bo that the judge's verdict to allow Matthew to make his own decision about the surgery had been upheld.   Reminding Bo of Shaun's medical condition, Nora was convinced that Greg might have a change of heart about performing Matthew's surgery.   Interrupting his parents' conversation, Matthew informed them that Greg had decided not to perform the surgery.  Bo and Nora tried to convince Matthew that Greg had made a wise decision, but Matthew's mood remained somber. As Bo and Nora attempted to comfort their son, Bo received an urgent call from Natalie.\n\n\nNora suggested that she and Matthew attempt to repair their relationship.  While Nora came up with solutions for Matthew's life confined to a wheelchair, Matthew announced that he would find another doctor to perform his surgery.\n\n\nAs Natalie and Jared waited for Bo to arrive at Llanfair, Jessica and Brody returned home.  When Jessica asked for a moment alone with her sister, Natalie made up an excuse to stick by Jared's side.  Meanwhile, Jared panicked when Brody headed for the terrace.  Jessica and Brody were shocked to discover the stalker's dead body on the terrace.  As Natalie and Jared attempted to explain, Bo arrived.  Brody slipped away and phoned John.\n\n\nWhile Bo questioned Jared, Natalie became enraged when John arrived at Llanfair.  John asked Jared if he could identify the murder victim.  A stunned Jared claimed that he had never met the individual.  Informing everyone that Jared and Wayne Landers had spent time in prison together, John retrieved the stalker's cell phone.  John phoned the last number that the stalker had dialed.  A look of shock crossed everyone's face as Jared's cell phone rang.\n\n\nBlair barged into Todd's house and announced that T\u00e9a was married to Ross Rayburn.  When Todd reminded Blair that he and T\u00e9a had been married the previous day, Blair took great pleasure in relating that T\u00e9a and Ross had married after their rescue from the deserted island.  Blair informed Todd that T\u00e9a and Ross had never divorced; therefore, T\u00e9a wasn't Todd's bride.\n\n\nTodd refused to believe Blair's claims, but Blair persisted.  As Blair continued to accuse T\u00e9a of bigamy, Todd began to have flashbacks of T\u00e9a attempting to give him details of her relationship with Ross.  Before Todd ordered Blair to leave his home, Blair insisted that she had proof to back up her claims.  Presenting him with the phone number of the town hall in Tahiti, Blair suggested that Todd investigate T\u00e9a's marriage to Ross.\n\n\nOnce Blair left, Todd stared at the number she had given him.  Appearing torn, Todd picked up his cell phone and dialed the number.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was stunned to discover Ross living on the grounds of La Boulaie.  T\u00e9a demanded to know why Ross was in Llanview, but he gave her vague answers.  Displaying the lost check, T\u00e9a questioned why he was on Dorian's payroll.  When T\u00e9a mentioned that she had discovered the check the day after her marriage to Todd, Ross lashed out at her.  Chastising her for marrying Todd before the ink had dried on their divorce papers, Ross recalled how his marriage to T\u00e9a had never stood a chance because of her obsession with Todd.\n\n\nRealizing that Ross was hurt, T\u00e9a apologized for her part in their failed marriage, but Ross continued to berate her for falling for Todd again.  In an attempt to hurt T\u00e9a, Ross commented that he might reveal her secret to Blair.  A suspicious T\u00e9a questioned Ross about his relationship with Blair, but Ross refused to provide her with answers; instead he asked why T\u00e9a hadn't told Todd about him.  T\u00e9a insisted that she would tell Todd about her marriage to Ross when the time was right.   Before storming out of the room, T\u00e9a warned, \"You stay away from Todd or I'll make you regret it!\"\n\n\nLater, Blair paid Ross a visit and lashed out at him for interfering in her plans.  When Ross offered to tear up the check, Blair informed him that his services were no longer needed.   A worried Ross wondered what Blair had done.  Blair announced, \"I've taken matters into my own hands!\"  Blair told Ross that Todd knew the truth.  Ross replied, \"Not the whole truth!\"\n\n\nTodd learned that T\u00e9a and Ross were married and there was no record of divorce.  As Todd hung up the phone, T\u00e9a returned home and stated that she needed to tell him something.  T\u00e9a attempted to reveal the truth to Todd, but he glared at her and asked, \"You're married to another man?\"\n\n\n",
