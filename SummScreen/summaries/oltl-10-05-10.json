Cole arrived and wondered whether Starr was really telling the truth. She insisted that Dani had just disappeared, and she asked how many times the cops would continue to ask the same questions. Cole was suspicious and pulled her outside. He was certain Starr was lying, and she finally had to admit that Dani was with James.\n\n\nCole was aggravated that Starr didn't tell him about it, though Starr tried to explain that Nate had gone to his brother for help because Nate would have been too obvious to the cops. She hadn't had the chance to tell Cole about it, but it was pretty clear to her that Cole was only angry because James was involved. Firmly, she told him she'd had no clue of the plan until Nate and James had showed up. She'd had no time to think about an alternative. Cole was livid that she had allowed Dani to go with a boy who stole cars. He claimed that he wasn't angry because of James, but only at the fact that Starr would be named as an accomplice, while Cole had been in the dark.\n\n\nStarr stated again that she hadn't known anything about the plan. Cole was insistent that something was always going on when James was around. Starr had been put into a bad position. Starr responded that she had only been thinking about Nate and Dani. \n\n\nStarr reminded Cole that they had run away once too. She wondered if Cole had forgotten about that. Cole promised that he'd never forget, because his life had begun then. Starr pointed out that it would be the same for Nate and Dani. Cole thought that things were different because he and Starr were older and had a child. He was worried that Starr would be arrested.\n\n\nStarr assured him she wouldn't be arrested and again told him he was only \"freaking out\" because James was involved. In fact, she wanted Cole to admit the real reason for his anger. Cole agreed that he was angry because James was a part of the escapade, and Starr was part of it too.\n\n\nFord was ready to go out for the day and called to James on his way. He assumed James was still asleep, but as soon as Ford left, James and Dani emerged from the bedroom. She thanked him for getting her away from Todd's house. James was worried that Ford would be infuriated if he found out about Dani, but as the pair sat at the kitchen table and ate breakfast, Ford returned. He had forgotten his duffle bag. Dani ran off to hide, but Ford saw the two cereal bowls. He asked James how long \"this\" had been going on.\n\n\nJames claimed that both bowls belonged to him, but it was obvious to Ford that James was hiding a girl. He presumed it was Starr, since she was hiding, and he was angry. James accused him of \"jumping to conclusions.\" Suddenly, James realized that his bullet necklace wasn't around his neck. \"Get rid of her. Now,\" Ford ordered. He reminded James that Starr's father and boyfriend were psychos. Ford called out to Starr to show herself, or he would drag her out himself. He was astonished when Dani walked out instead.\n\n\nJames was happy to show Ford that Ford had been wrong, but Ford asked Dani's age. When she replied that she was 16, Ford chuckled sarcastically. He couldn't believe that James was \"hooking up\" with his brother's underage girlfriend. Dani was disgusted, but Ford wondered how James could commit such an act. James asked why Ford even cared, since he pretended that Nate wasn't his brother. Ford admitted that Nate had helped him out. James retorted that not everyone \"lived in the world according to Robert Ford\" where everyone slept in bed with each other. James was hiding Dani from her father.\n\n\nFord was aghast. He couldn't believe that James was keeping her from the psycho. \"Wrong father,\" James told him. He and Dani explained the story to Ford, but Ford was annoyed that Nate had involved James. Nate would do the same for him, James retorted. Sarcastically, Ford wondered if that would be due to James and Nate's long history together -- of the past few weeks. Ford asserted that James had defied a court order and kidnapped a minor. They would be known as \"Public Enemies number one.\" They would be on everyone's hit list, Ford declared. Dani was sorry for their involvement.\n\n\nFord wanted to know if there were a plan, and James made it clear that they were waiting for Dani's family to fight the court order. He added that Starr had nothing to do with the entire scheme. Ford asked why Nate wasn't hiding Dani, but James thought it would have been too obvious, and Nate would have been followed. James felt that his apartment was the safest place for Dani. Ford didn't share that opinion and threatened to call the cops if James didn't do the right thing and take Dani back.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Shaun spoke quietly to Vivian as they waited for Greg's arrival. Shaun knew that Greg was in trouble, and he was sorry that he hadn't followed through on his instincts. Vivian was sure that Shaun would be able to help his brother pull through. Mrs. Evans and Destiny showed up and approached John as he escorted Greg's stretcher to the intensive care unit. Mrs. Evans asked what had happened.\n\n\nShortly after, a nurse advised everyone that Greg was stable. She invited Greg's mother to see her son, but she was too upset, especially because her husband was out of town. She urged Destiny to sit with Greg as Mrs. Evans composed herself. Destiny assured her mother that Greg would be fine. Mrs. Evans wanted to know why Greg had been plied with a lethal dose of morphine, and John explained that the perpetrator was at large.\n\n\nHe named Elijah Clarke, and a surprised Shaun noted that Eli was dead. John clarified that Eli only wanted everyone to believe it. He added that Greg had been listed as Eli's doctor at the hospice, but Mrs. Evans refused to believe that her son would have been involved with Eli. Shaun believed that Greg had been under pressure and Shaun was worried, but his mother stressed that had been Greg's job. John continued to question the family, but Mrs. Evans insisted John was wrong. She went off in search of an extra blanket for her son.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Destiny sat with Greg and told her unconscious brother that she would talk to him non-stop. She told him things were messed up. He fixed people, but he needed someone to fix him, she said.\n\n\nJessica showed up for her appointment with Vivian. The doctor examined her, and explained that she had to recheck Jessica's blood pressure. She asked Jessica about any unusual symptoms. Jessica confirmed that she'd revealed the uncertainty of the baby's father to Brody, and while he would occasionally get angry, it was at the situation and not at her. She was certain the baby would be Brody's, though, she told Vivian.\n\n\nVivian explained that Jessica had consistently high blood pressure, and with the hypertension would need bed rest. It was usually stress related, and it probably had to do with the baby's father being in question. Vivian wanted to speak to Brody.\n\n\nNate, Todd, and Ross were at the police station in light of Dani's disappearance. Ross accused Brody of being in cahoots with Todd and Nate, but Brody glared at Ross and began to ask Nate questions. Nate claimed that Dani has asked for a minute alone, and she was gone. Todd denied having any knowledge of his daughter's escape. Ross was certain that Todd was involved, since he had acted strangely at the house. Todd recalled his strange phone call, but out loud he claimed to have been thinking of a way to say goodbye to Dani. Todd emphasized that Dani didn't want anything to do with Ross, since he'd had T\u00e9a's will changed, so she had run away.\n\n\nNate could hardly contain his smug look as Ross and Todd began to argue and accuse each other of Dani's disappearance. Todd pointed out that the last time Dani had run away, she'd had assistance from a boy. Suddenly, he stole a glance at Nate and looked away quickly. Todd suggested that the police look at the Buchanan boy for a lead. Instead, Brody turned to Nate, but Nate insisted he would be with Dani if he could. \"I lost her too,\" he said.\n\n\nBrody asked Nate who was responsible, but Nate had nothing to say. Ross started in on Todd again, and grabbed him violently. He demanded to know what Todd had done. The cops pulled Ross away, and Todd turned back to Nate. He inquired who had helped Nate, but the teen maintained that he hadn't seen Dani. Todd insisted that he had a right to know everything.\n\n\nAnother police officer announced that there had been no sign of Dani as yet, but they had added roadblocks. Adamantly, Ross advised Brody that Todd had been the one to get Dani out, and Ross feared she was halfway across the world. Brody received a phone call from Vivian, who asked to speak to him right away.\n\n\nTodd grabbed Nate and tried to get information from him. Todd noted that he had the resources and experience to help Dani better than Nate. When Todd didn't get anywhere, he began to threaten Nate. Brody broke them up and advised them they would be able to leave. As Todd continued to talk to Nate, Ross wandered over. \"Look who's buddy-buddy,\" he called out. Todd wondered if Nate were holding out on them and grabbed him again. Suddenly, he decided that Nate couldn't possibly be involved, and Todd chased him out.\n\n\nRoss and Todd had words again and continued to threaten and accuse each other. John returned to the station. \"What are you girls gabbing about?\" he asked the men. \"Anything I should know?\" The guys went off again, and Ross declared there would be \"hell to pay\" if his daughter were not returned. He left the station, but John stopped Todd. He wanted to talk to him about Eli. John was certain that Eli was headed to Llanview.\n\n\nBrody reached the hospital and met with Vivian and Jessica. The doctor explained the situation and stressed that Jessica would need to reduce her tension. She left the couple alone. Jessica assured Brody she felt fine, but Brody blamed himself. Jessica was only happy that Brody had been honest with his feelings. She stressed that they had to tell each other everything. Brody wanted to get her home so he could take care of her and the baby.\n\n\nDestiny told her mother that Greg had been different lately. He hadn't been willing to talk to anyone, and he had lied in court, she told her mother. Mrs. Evans was certain her son would explain himself eventually. Shaun stated that both he and Destiny had noticed Greg's personality change, and it was possible that Greg had been working with Eli. Perhaps Eli had found Greg's weak spot. Mrs. Evans refused to accept it.\n\n\nNate turned up at Todd's house and asked loudly why all of the cops were there. Starr advised him that Cole knew what had happened. Nate didn't think the cops had followed him to Todd's, and he was certain that Starr wasn't a suspect. Nate wanted Starr to do a favor for him. He asked her to call James to check up on Dani. Nate was afraid that his own call would be traced. \n\n\nStarr looked at Cole for approval. \"Do what you have to do, Starr,\" Cole said. Starr looked at Cole. \"I'm sorry, I have to do this,\" she told him, as she dialed James's number. She wanted to do it for Nate and Dani. Cole couldn't hide his resentment. \"It's too bad you won't do anything for us,\" he uttered.\n\n\nJames asked Ford to give him 24 hours. He asked Ford to do it for Nate. Ford only wanted to keep James safe. Just then, James received a phone call. It was Starr, and she asked how Dani was doing. At the same time, Brody began to knock loudly on the door, and he called for James. Starr heard the commotion and asked what was happening. \"I'll tell you in a minute,\" James told her. He ran to hide Dani as Brody continued to yell and bang on the door.\n\n\nDestiny wanted to call Darren and tell him the latest news. Mrs. Evans kept Greg company, while Shaun met up with Vivian. Shaun confessed that his mother didn't believe that anything could be wrong, but Vivian advised him not to read into anything. Inside of Greg's room, Mrs. Evans spoke to her unconscious son. She knew that he had been trying to protect his brother and sister. She knew the reason why he had done Eli's dirty work.\n\n\nRoss wandered to the docks and tried to call Dani. He left her a message to call him. \"You looking for me?\" someone asked him. Ross turned and saw Eli standing nearby. Eli was not happy, and he demanded to know why Ross hadn't shown up with Dani in Caracas.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Dani escaped and is staying in James and Robert's apartment, James knows he better not let his brother know she's there because he might not understand and may give her up to the cops. Sure enough, Robert tells James he and Nate cannot get themselves involved in Dani's problem with her family. They are defying a court order and harboring a minor and he has to think about himself and them and not about Dani and her friends. But James tells his brother he needs to just let her stay there another 24 hours. Yet, Brody bangs on the door outside and demands that Robert open up. Robert assumes that is the reason, but Brody is concerned about Jessica's stress level and the fact that she may be carrying Brody's baby. Greg is in critical condition. His mother is angry at John for failing to protect her son. Shaun tells her that he is certain John is correct that Greg got mixed up with Eli and that is why he's in the coma. She doesn't want to believe that but realizes that Eli may have threatened Shaun or Destiny and that could be the reason. Meanwhile, Ross is furious and wants Todd arrested assuming he's hiding Dani. Todd is not as upset, at least knowing that somebody else is preventing her from being taken to Tahiti and attempts to get Nate to tell him where his daughter is although Nate does not give her up. When Ross goes down to the docks, Eli shows up unexpectedly.",
