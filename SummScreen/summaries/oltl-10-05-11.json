She thought that John deserved to know the truth, and she had to do what she thought was right for everyone. She was aware that the truth would always emerge at some point.\n\n\nBrody returned home from work, and he divulged, off the record, that Tomas had confessed to killing Irene Manning. He took his son from Jessica's arms, and thanked her for watching the boy. He had been surprised to hear from Natalie that Jessica was babysitting. Jessica asserted that she and Ryder were Liam's flesh and blood.\n\n\nBrody sighed. He noted that in a perfect world, they would all be able to forget the past. Jessica eyed the DNA test in her purse and told Brody it wasn't possible. Brody asked her to try to make peace with Natalie, though he didn't have a right to ask her that. \"You seem really happy,\" Jessica said. \"I am,\" Brody replied.\n\n\nFamily was really important to him, Brody explained. Jessica recalled how Brody couldn't be a father to Shane, and how devastated he'd been. Brody acknowledged that he'd grown to accept that, and he was stronger than he had been in the past. Besides, Liam was his son, Brody pointed out. He knew that things were painful for Jessica, and he hoped that she could be happy for him one day.\n\n\nJessica admitted that she already was happy for Brody, and she was aware of what it felt like to feel broken. She was glad that Liam had helped Brody to heal, and she would never want to make him feel broken again.\n\n\nSam was sitting at the kitchen counter, having a late snack, when John paid a visit to La Boulaie. \"Am I in trouble?\" the little boy asked when he saw the detective. John assured him that he wasn't, and in fact, Sam was his best deputy. He was hoping that Sam might help him to find the man with the line on his face.\n\n\nSam asked if the man had really killed his father. He fiddled with some silly band bracelets on the counter, and he picked one up that was in the shape of a shark. He had planned to give the bracelet to his father. \"My dad can't use it,\" the boy said matter-of-factly. He offered it to John instead.\n\n\nJack found the pair in the kitchen and asked whether the police had located Todd yet. John confessed that they hadn't. \"What is wrong with you people?\" Jack asked. He sent his little brother to bed and advised Sam that he shouldn't be talking to the cops. John announced that Irene was dead, and he was looking for Todd.\n\n\n \"I told you that guy's a maniac,\" Jack proclaimed. Jack didn't have a clue on Todd's whereabouts. John headed for the door and urged Jack to call the police if he heard anything from Todd.\n\n\nJames agreed to honor Starr's request to help clear Todd's name while she was in jail. He was reluctant, as he had no idea of where to start. Starr explained that Todd shouldn't have been arrested for Victor's murder, and Irene had taken the evidence that proved otherwise. Todd was hiding, and he needed the murder charge to be dropped.\n\n\nStarr noted that her brother was a witness, but she was certain that Jack had made the story up. She wanted James to get Jack to tell the truth, and she had a plan. James promised to do his best, though he hated to leave Starr in jail. Starr declared that she was scared for her father, and she would be fine. She thanked James for helping her dad, but James clarified that he was doing everything for Starr, because he loved her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a insisted that her brother tell her the truth, while she and Tomas sat in the police station. Tomas continued to maintain that he had been the one to kill Irene, but T\u00e9a was positive that he was lying. She wondered why he hadn't even told the cops that Todd had been present at the scene, and she wanted to know why Tomas was covering for Todd. As they sat and waited for the next step in the arrest process, Natalie walked into the room.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wondered if there were any news on the case, and Natalie advised her there wasn't. T\u00e9a reminded Natalie that as Tomas' attorney, T\u00e9a had the right to be aware of the latest case developments. Natalie assured her that forensics was still analyzing the blood found at the scene, though they were aware that it probably didn't belong to either Irene or Tomas. Natalie wondered how the blood might have gotten on the trash bin, with Irene lying a distance away.\n\n\nTomas maintained that he'd struggled with Irene, and the blood had gotten on the bin at that time. Irene had staggered and then fallen a short distance away. Natalie feigned surprise and noted that if that were the case, there would have been a trail of blood. She wondered if Tomas had something to say. T\u00e9a jumped in and challenged Natalie's questioning of Tomas without his attorney.\n\n\nNatalie backed off and stated that they would just wait for John. She suggested that Tomas tell John about Todd, although they would know about Todd once the blood testing was completed. She walked away, and an incensed T\u00e9a got into her brother's face. It was obvious that Natalie didn't believe Tomas, and neither would the detectives. They both knew it was Todd's blood that had been found. Tomas replied that the blood could belong to anyone.\n\n\nAgain, T\u00e9a disputed her brother's story. They knew that Todd had shot Irene, and the blood would prove that Todd had been at the scene. She demanded to understand why Tomas was protecting Todd and taking the fall for Irene's murder. \"I know what I'm doing,\" he replied. Todd would face yet another murder charge, and his life would be over, Tomas explained. \"Why is this your problem?\" T\u00e9a inquired roughly.\n\n\nJohn returned to the station and announced that he hadn't been able to locate Todd. He ordered Tomas to tell him what had really happened, but Tomas replied that he had. Natalie had the forensics results, and she made it known that the blood found at the scene had been Todd's. Tomas still had nothing to say. \"Book him,\" John commanded his staff.\n\n\nDownstairs in her cell, Starr asked the guard if he'd had any word about Todd. The guard was one of the men that Starr had held at gunpoint. He was sarcastic and brief, and he advised her that he had no plans of helping her out. He added that Starr and her father were both \"bad news\" and they were \"going down.\"\n\n\nIt was time for Tomas to be escorted to a cell. John praised Natalie for the work she'd done, especially returning to the station on short notice. She looked at John's watch and conceded that it was time for her to get home to Brody and Liam. Natalie admired John's shark bracelet, and he revealed that he'd received it from Sam.\n\n\n\"How'd you rate that?\" Natalie asked. John thought it was because he'd paid attention to the little boy. \"I always knew you'd be good with kids,\" Natalie replied. After Natalie was gone, John remained in place quietly and thoughtfully. He played with the shark bracelet around his wrist.\n\n\nStarr was astonished when Tomas was placed into the cell across from her own. She was confused, and T\u00e9a explained that he'd been arrested for Irene's murder. Starr couldn't believe that her grandmother was dead, but she wondered where her father was. T\u00e9a leaned over and spoke softly. She advised Starr not to worry, because Blair was looking out for Todd.\n\n\nT\u00e9a apologized for Starr having to remain behind bars overnight, but she promised to see to the young woman's release the next day. Starr admitted that all she cared about was her father.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wandered over to Tomas' cell, and she advised him that she wanted to help him, but he would have to be willing to help himself first. She admitted that she hadn't told Starr about Todd being shot, and T\u00e9a only hoped that Blair had found Todd and been able to help him.\n\n\nBlair found Todd lying on the floor of Viki's cabin. Hysterically, she leaned over his bloodied body and began to cry. She was sure he was dead. Suddenly, Todd opened his eyes. \"Don't go burying me yet,\" he ordered weakly. Blair shrieked. \"Quit your screaming. You're gonna give me a heart attack,\" Todd begged. Blair shouted that he'd given her one, as she had thought he was dead. She asked what had happened.\n\n\n\"My bitch mother shot me,\" Todd explained briefly. Blair was aware that she would have to staunch the profuse flow of blood, and she began to look around for something to use. She grabbed some of Viki's decorative pillows and began to apply pressure to Todd's shoulder wound. Grimacing in pain, Todd advised Blair that Viki would never send Blair a Christmas card again. He asked how Blair had located him.\n\n\nBlair explained that she'd had a missed call on her cell phone from Viki's landline phone. Blair wondered why Todd hadn't called T\u00e9a or Viki instead. Todd explained that he knew that Blair cared about him. Blair was still annoyed over everything that Todd had gotten the family involved with, especially with Starr landing in jail.\n\n\nTodd acknowledged that he would have to fix that, but he'd had to escape from jail. Irene had planned to kill everyone he loved. Blair leaned over him and picked up her phone. She thought it best if she call someone to take care of Todd, but he grabbed the phone away. He disagreed, but Blair still felt she should call an ambulance. Todd insisted that he only had a flesh wound, and he thought that Blair could clean and wrap it.\n\n\nBlair advised Todd that it would be his own fault if he died. She gathered up some towels, found a first aid kit, and managed to help Todd to get his shirt off. He attempted to joke with her while she took care of him, and he noted that he hadn't expected their reunion to turn out the way that it had.\n\n\nBlair cleaned the wound. She was covered in Todd's blood. Suddenly, Todd passed out, and Blair continued to talk to him. She didn't want him to die. \"Am I dead?\" Todd asked as he woke up again. He ordered her not to use the \"d\" word. He went on about his death that had been eight years in the past, and how he'd thought he would be able to make a fresh start. \"I'm so tired,\" Todd said. He thought that hell would be great.\n\n\nBlair yelled at him for saying such things, and she advised him that he couldn't die. Todd owed it to Starr to stay alive, and especially after he'd caused everyone so much trouble, Blair insisted. She slapped Todd's face, and he yelled at her. She still wanted to call a doctor, as the bleeding hadn't slowed down. She wondered who she could call who wouldn't turn Todd in.\n\n\nThe thought occurred to Blair almost instantly. She would call Dorian. When she reached her aunt on the phone, Blair asked her how to fix a gunshot wound. \"How'd you know it was Todd?\" Blair asked her aunt. \"I want a real doctor,\" Todd shouted. Blair urged him to keep quiet, and she described the situation to Dorian. After listening to some instructions, Blair advised Todd that she had to look at something.\n\n\nTurning Todd onto his side gently, Blair advised her aunt that there wasn't an exit wound, and she took note of Dorian's further instructions. Blair announced that she would have to remove the bullet, and Dorian would talk her through it over the phone. \"You gonna dig it out with one of Viki's melon ballers?\" Todd questioned her. Blair promised that she would, if it was still his choice not to go to a hospital.\n\n\nBlair collected the necessary items for the surgery. She'd located a sharp knife and boiled some water. She sterilized her equipment in the boiling water. She didn't have any alcohol though, she told her aunt. \"She says this might hurt a little,\" Blair warned Todd. She handed him an expensive pen and told him to bite down on it. She advised him that he would have to replace it if he broke it.\n\n\nBlair admitted she was scared, but Todd indicated that he trusted her. Blair thought that proved that Todd was crazier than she thought. She put down the phone.\n\n\nJames arrived at La Boulaie and advised Jack that he was there to warn Jack. Todd had been taken into custody, and the gun that would prove Todd's innocence in Victor's murder had been retrieved. The police were running tests, and it was only a matter of time before it was proven that Jack had lied about Todd.\n\n\nJack wondered why he should be afraid of that. James chuckled at Jack's naivet\u00e9. James advised Jack that both Starr and James were aware that Jack had lied, and it made sense for Jack to confess to the cops first, before they showed up at his door. James offered to accompany Jack to the station. Suddenly, Jack looked over at the television and turned up the sound. The newscaster was saying that Todd was still at large.\n\n\n\"You bastard!\" Jack shouted at James. Jack realized that James and Starr had tricked him, and he demanded that James leave the house. James promised that the scenario he'd stated could still happen, and the gun would prove that Todd hadn't killed Victor. Jack vowed to take his chances. James assured Jack that he wasn't telling Jack to stop hating his father.\n\n\n\"He's not my dad,\" Jack yelled. \"Yeah, he is,\" James replied. \"And you can't change that no matter how much you want to,\" James added. He thought that Jack should tell the truth for himself, or he'd wind up in jail. Jack reminded James that Starr was behind bars, and she should be more concerned with taking care of her own problems.\n\n\nBlair successfully removed the bullet from Todd's shoulder. She replaced the dressing, and she advised Dorian that Todd was barely alive. Blair ordered her aunt not to tell anyone about Todd, and she ended the phone call. Leaning over, Blair gently stroked Todd's face. She wondered if he were okay.\n\n\n\"Peachy,\" Todd responded. He noticed that she hadn't totally screwed things up, and he planned to thank her in the morning if he were still alive. He grabbed her hand to his chest. Blair advised him that she had to leave, but Todd begged her to stay. He claimed that he wasn't scared. \"I just don't want you to leave,\" he admitted. After he continued to plead with her, Blair agreed to stay.\n\n\nJessica advised Brody that she had to get back home. He thanked her again for staying. Natalie returned before Jessica left and advised Jessica that she hoped to return the favor some day. Once Jessica was gone, Natalie made it known that she thought things had looked cozy between Jessica and Brody.\n\n\nBrody explained that he and Jessica had been talking. Jessica had made it clear that things wouldn't be perfect, but he was glad that the horrible chapter of their lives appeared to be over.\n\n\nJessica stopped outside and thought to herself. She couldn't break Brody's heart.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica contemplates whether to tell John that he is Liam's father or not. After watching Brody with Liam, she keeps mum. John asks Sam to help him find the man with the line on his face. Jack tells him not to talk to police. He tells Jack to call the police if they hear from Todd. Starr asks James to persuade Jack to tell the truth so the police will drop the charges against Todd. James tells Jack that the police have the murder weapon, the forensics report will match Todd's story and Jack will be in trouble with the police for lying. A news report contradicts James's story. James concedes that it hasn't happened yet, but asserts that it is only a matter of time until it does. Neither Natalie nor Tea believes Tomas's confession to Irene's murder.
