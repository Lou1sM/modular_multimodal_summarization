    "soap_central": "\nI'll Make You An Offer...\n\n\nAt her home in Colombia, Vanessa introduced Cristian to Ray's daughter, Lola. Revealing that Lola was her stepdaughter, Vanessa told Cris that Ray murdered Lola's mother and that Lola witnessed the crime and turned Ray in to the authorities. At Ray's trial, Vanessa and Lola testified against him. Begging for Cris's help, Vanessa informed him that Ray had threatened to kill her and her stepdaughter, if he were ever released from prison. Concerned by Vanessa's claims, Cris asked Lola for details of the murder. The young girl told Cris that she actually heard the murder being committed and was terrified of her father. Sensing his compassion, Lola asked Cris to take her and Vanessa back to Llanview with him. Vanessa asked Lola to leave the room so that she could have a word with Cris. Lola obliged. \n\n\nVanessa assured Cris that she had no idea how Ray had escaped from prison, and feared that Ray would follow through with his threat against her and Lola. A concerned Cris asked Vanessa if she actually believed that Ray was capable of killing his own child. Presenting him with fake passports for the three of them, Vanessa informed Cris that Ray would also kill him because of his connection to her and Lola. Vanessa was certain that Ray was searching for them, but felt he would be thrown off the trail if she and Lola traveled with Cris. Examining the passports, Cris agreed to take Vanessa and Lola back to Llanview with him. \n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Department, Talia learned from Antonio and Sarah that Cris was last seen in Plato Prison - as an inmate under the name of Ray Montez. After surmising that Carlo was involved in Cris's imprisonment, the group struggled to uncover what role Ray played in the plot. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Dorian confronted Clint about bringing Ray to Llanview to take Langston away from her. With a smug look, Clint denied any involvement. Noting that Nora was a mother, Dorian appealed to Nora for her help in convincing Clint to end his vendetta against Dorian because it was ruining Langston's life. A speechless Nora excused herself and left Dorian and Clint alone to discuss the situation. Out in the hall, Nora looked disturbed as she listened to Dorian plead with Clint not to allow Ray to take Langston out of the country. \n\n\nAlone with Dorian, Clint reminded her that she had stolen Buchanan Enterprises from his family and he was determined to gain control of the company again. Dorian continued to criticize Clint's disregard for Langston's well-being. Reminding him that Ray was a convicted murderer, she argued that Clint's crime was far worse than any that she had ever committed. Clint accused Dorian of causing Nash's death and the loss of his grandchildren's inheritance. As Dorian pleaded with Clint to have a heart, she was surprised when Clint blatantly informed her that she could save Langston by returning B.E. to him. Clint told Dorian that he had the ability to send Ray back to prison. Advising Dorian to cooperate by signing legal documents that would transfer ownership of B.E. back to him, Clint promised to take care of Ray and return Langston into Dorian's custody. \n\n\nAs Clint presented Dorian with the legal documents, she surprised him by stating that she needed time to consider his offer. A shocked Clint told Dorian that Langston's future was at stake. He promised to send Langston to Colombia if Dorian didn't comply with his wishes. Appearing unmoved by Clint's threats, Dorian promised to get back to him and calmly left the mansion. Clint couldn't believe Dorian would risk the chance of losing Langston. Outside, Dorian placed a call to Jackie McNaughton. Dorian told Jackie that it was necessary that they continue the important conversation that they had discussed earlier. \n\n\nAntonio and Talia were determined to find the connection between Ray and Cris. As Antonio and Talia discussed the case with Sarah, Nora entered the room and was surprised to learn that Ray was a convicted murderer who had been mysteriously released from prison. Antonio asked Nora if she had any information concerning Ray, but Nora denied having any knowledge of Montez and stated that for the very first time, she actually felt sorry for Dorian. Antonio informed Nora that Ray could possibly provide them with information about Cris's disappearance. When Antonio suggested that they pick up Ray for questioning, Nora agreed. Before heading off to locate Ray, Antonio expressed the need to determine who was responsible for Ray's arrival in Llanview. \n\n\nIn the halls of Llanview High School, Langston, Starr, and Markko discussed what Dorian might do in order to prevent Langston from leaving Llanview. As the teens deliberated, they were obviously shaken when Ray approached them. Stating that he had come to the school to examine Langston's learning environment, Ray tried to convince the teens that he wanted the best for Langston. Ray listened as Langston, Starr, and Markko lashed out at him for ruining Langston's life. Langston appealed to her uncle to reconsider taking her away from her family and friends, but Ray refused. \n\n\nBack at the police station, Cole questioned why John was still investigating his mother's tragic accident. Citing that Marty was dead, Cole couldn't understand why John was still looking into the case. Attempting to deflect Cole's questioning, John stated that the investigation was never actually closed because of Bo's sudden exit as police commissioner. John told Cole that he was simply tying up some lose ends. \n\n\nAccepting John's explanation, Cole asked John to help prevent Ray from taking Langston away from Dorian. Explaining that Clint and Ray were working together, Cole begged John to look into the situation. Cole told John that Langston felt as though she were losing her mother all over again. Cole was certain that he could never handle losing a parent twice. Concerned by Dorian's statement that she would handle Clint and Ray, Cole expressed his fear that Dorian might jeopardize any chance that Langston had of remaining in Llanview. Cole told John that he was worried that Starr wouldn't be able to handle losing her friend, and pleaded with John to pay a visit to La Boulaie to investigate Dorian's plans. Cole suggested that the task would be an easy one because John was involved with Blair. Uncomfortable by Cole's statement, John attempted to change the subject. Cole reminded John that he had a right to move on with his life, but asked John to remember Marty. \n\n\nSensing that Cole was still dealing with the loss of his mother, John engaged Cole in a conversation about Marty. The two reminisced about happier times they both shared with Marty. Cole revealed that he still had unresolved feelings concerning the way Marty disappeared suddenly. He reminded John of a day that the three of them traveled in John's car. Cole smiled as he remembered his mother's laughter and the way her hair blew in the wind. Before leaving, Cole told John that he was still bothered that he wouldn't be a part of his child's life, but realized that he wanted to remain friends with Starr. John supported Cole's decision and told him that it was important to remain close to both Starr and Langston, because he might need a friend himself. \n\n\nAlone in his office, John studied Marty's case file. As he stared at the words, \"Presumed dead\" on a report, John mumbled, \"It's possible!\" He crossed out the word, \"Dead\" and wrote the word \"Alive.\" \n\n\nAt Todd's home, Todd was relieved when Marty announced that she wouldn't continue to search for information concerning the rape. Marty told Todd that she wanted to forget the past and look forward to her future with him and his grandchild. Surprised that Marty was able to walk downstairs by herself, Todd expressed his pleasure that she was getting better. When Marty mentioned her desire to move on with her life, Todd appeared moved. He told Marty to get dressed because he wanted to take her for a drive. \n\n\nAs Todd drove, Marty sat in the passenger seat and laughed as she enjoyed the ride. Later, Todd helped Marty walk along a beautiful picnic area. A delighted Marty thanked Todd for a new beginning. Todd responded by giving Marty a loving kiss. \n\n\nCole called Starr and told her that John would help them protect Langston from Ray and Clint. As Langston, Starr, and Markko continued to plead with an unmoved Ray, they were all stunned when Nora, Antonio, and Talia appeared. Nora announced that Ray was being taken to the police station for questioning concerning the disappearance of Cristian Vega. Ray asked Nora who Cristian Vega was. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah stared at a photo of her and Cris. Sarah begged Cris to return to her. \n\n\nBack in Colombia, Cris told an elated Lola that he would protect her from her father. The young girl smiled as Cris told her to pack her bags because he was taking her to Llanview.\n\n  \n\n\n",
