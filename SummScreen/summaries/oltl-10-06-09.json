    "soap_central": "\nAn Arresting Development\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair perked up when Ross let it slip that T\u00e9a had more to hide than her marriage to him.  Blair wanted details, but Ross wasn't eager to share.  Ross accused Blair of being desperate to reconcile with Todd.  He realized that Blair intended to run to Todd with the information.  Blair didn't deny it; she claimed that it was what T\u00e9a deserved.  Ross suspected that the real reason that Blair wanted to spill all of T\u00e9a's secrets was because Blair feared that Todd would forgive T\u00e9a for not telling him about her marriage to Ross.\n\n\nBlair denied it, but Ross didn't believe her.  Ross was confident that Blair was worried that Todd and T\u00e9a would work through their problems and emerge stronger than ever.  Blair remained determined to learn all of T\u00e9a's damaging secrets.  Ross offered to tell Blair everything that she wanted to know if Blair could prove to him that she was over Todd.  Blair wondered what she would have to do in order to persuade Ross.  Ross suggested a kiss.\n\n\nBlair gave Ross a quick peck on the lips, but it wasn't what Ross had in mind.  Blair decided that she'd had enough of Ross's games; she ordered him to leave her home before the police arrested him.  Ross realized that Blair had not dropped the kidnapping charges against him.  Without an ounce of remorse, Blair claimed that she had forgotten.  Ross quickly gathered his things.  Before he left La Boulaie, Ross admitted that he suspected Blair would always be obsessed with Todd; however, he hoped that she would prove him wrong.\n\n\nAt the Manning residence, Todd confronted T\u00e9a about her marriage to Ross.  T\u00e9a insisted that she wasn't married to Ross, but Todd disagreed.  He explained that he had called an official in Tahiti, which had confirmed that the divorce papers had never been filed.   The news shocked T\u00e9a.  She promised that she could arrange for the papers to be filed and post-dated, so that their marriage would remain valid.  T\u00e9a was crushed when Todd revealed that he preferred being single.\n\n\nT\u00e9a couldn't believe how easily Todd had written off their marriage.  She insisted that she hadn't loved Ross in years.  Todd was unmoved; he wasn't interested in her explanations.  T\u00e9a refused to be dismissed. She reminded Todd that he had done worse when he had slept with Blair in the cabana.  Todd argued that he was furious because she had lied to him while he had been struggling to be a better person for her.\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a mentioned the children, Todd's temper flared.  He shouted at her that she wasn't anyone's mother.  T\u00e9a agreed, but didn't elaborate.  As the fight drained out of her, T\u00e9a headed to the front door.  Before she left, she handed Todd some tickets for a wrestling match that she had bought for the boys.  Todd took the tickets and then slammed the door in T\u00e9a's face.  Moments later, he tore the tickets up.\n\n\nOutside, T\u00e9a cried as she gave in to her grief and frustration.\n\n\nStacy and Kim huddled together in a booth at the diner, reviewing notes about Schuyler's likes and dislikes.  Kim didn't understand why she had to know everything about Schuyler, since she was just going out on a date with him, not applying for a job.  Stacy reminded Kim that their goal was for Kim to snag Schuyler's interest long enough to make Gigi jealous.  Kim assured Stacy that she had everything under control, and then dashed out of the diner to meet Schuyler.\n\n\nAs Kim approached Rodi's, she overheard Rex on his cell phone.  He was confirming that he had reserved two tickets for a movie later that evening.  After Rex entered the bar, Kim pulled out her cell phone and then ordered two tickets to the same movie.\n\n\nSchuyler approached Gigi at the bar to ask her opinion about his outfit.  Gigi admitted that Schuyler looked very nice and then wondered why he was \"gussied up.\"  Schuyler told her that he had a date.  Gigi was surprised that Schuyler was actually going to go out with Kim, the \"skank.\"  Schuyler defended Kim, claiming that she could be a decent person, sometimes.  Besides, he reminded Gigi, he didn't have women lined up eager to date him.\n\n\nGigi didn't think that Schuyler should settle for the \"first set of knockers\" that he saw.  Schuyler confided that he wanted an opportunity to get to know someone who liked him.  Neither Gigi nor Schuyler realized that Rex stood in the doorway watching them.  Rex approached them moments later, just as Gigi reluctantly admitted that maybe Schuyler would have a good time.  When Rex questioned the comment, Gigi explained that Schuyler had a date.\n\n\nMoments later, Kim breezed into the bar.  She walked up to Schuyler to ask him if he was ready to go.  After Schuyler and Kim left, Rex announced that he had arranged for Gigi to have the evening off, so that they could go to a movie.  Gigi was touched that Rex was willing to see a \"chick flick\" with her.\n\n\nAfter Schuyler and Kim left Rodi's, Schuyler suggested that they go on a haunted hayride.  Kim told him that she was allergic to hay, but promised him that she had a better idea.\n\n\nAs Gigi entered the theater, she spotted Kim and Schuyler seated a few rows ahead of her.  Kim noticed Gigi, but she didn't tell Schuyler.  Moments later, Rex joined Gigi.  While Rex watched the movie, Gigi watched Kim and Schuyler.  Kim took full advantage of Gigi's attention by flirting and cuddling with Schuyler.  At one point, Gigi's jealousy prompted her to throw some popcorn at Kim.  Kim smiled as she picked the popcorn out of her hair and then ate it.\n\n\nWhen Kim kissed Schuyler, Gigi decided that she'd had enough; she told Rex that she wanted to leave.  Rex was reluctant to walk out on the movie because he was enjoying it.  In her exasperation, Gigi argued that the movie was a disappointment.  The crowd didn't appreciate Gigi's comments, so they shushed her.  Gigi ignored everyone as she panned the movie and then revealed the ending, in an effort to persuade Rex to leave.\n\n\nSchuyler and others were furious with Gigi's antics.  Schuyler stood up to berate Gigi, but stopped mid-tirade when he realized that Gigi had been the rude person who had spoiled the ending of the movie for everyone.\n\n\nWhen Gigi and Rex returned to Rodi's, Gigi apologized for her behavior at the movies.  She admitted that she had let her dislike for Kim get the best of her.  Rex suspected that Gigi was upset because Kim had been on a date with Schuyler.  Gigi insisted that Schuyler could do better than someone like Kim.  Rex reluctantly agreed.  Gigi changed the subject by inviting Rex to take her home to have with his way with her for the remainder of the night.\n\n\nRex went to fetch the car, but when he stepped outside, he stopped and appeared to be deep in thought.  Meanwhile, Gigi sat in Rodi's thinking about Schuyler's kiss with Kim.\n\n\nAfter the movie ended, Kim announced that she had decided to go home alone.  She skillfully manipulated Schuyler by claiming that it had been obvious that Gigi had feelings for Schuyler.  Schuyler denied it, but after Kim left, Schuyler sat down in the theater to reflect.\n\n\nAt the diner, Stacy returned a hamburger that she claimed had been raw, not rare.  Stacy couldn't believe that she would be served a substandard meal in her \"obvious\" condition.  When the waitress admitted that she didn't have a clue what Stacy was talking about, Stacy clarified that she was pregnant.  Oliver entered the diner in time to hear Stacy's announcement.  Oliver immediately asked Stacy for confirmation that he had heard her correctly.\n\n\nStacy realized that Oliver thought that the baby was his.  She admitted that she was pregnant, but lied when she claimed that Rex was the baby's father.  Oliver was relieved.  He wanted children, but in the future, not right away.  Stacy assured Oliver that she had been pregnant when she had slept with him.  At the mention of their last night together, Oliver talked about his decision to live as an openly gay man.  Eventually he confessed that his reluctance to accept who he was had cost him a relationship with Kyle.\n\n\nWhile they chatted, Oliver's cell phone rang.  It was John.  John wanted Oliver to meet him at Llanfair.  After Oliver ended the call, Stacy offered him some advice.  She urged him not to give up on Kyle.  Oliver appreciated Stacy's encouragement, but he was certain that it was too late for him and Kyle.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, John hit the redial button on the dead man's cell phone.  To everyone's surprise, Jared's cell phone rang.  John and Bo questioned why the stalker had called Jared.  Jared assured Natalie that things were not as they appeared.  John wanted to rule Jared out as a suspect, but he needed answers.  Natalie leapt to Jared's defense, claiming that her husband was not a murderer.\n\n\nBo and John asked Jared to walk them through the events of the day.  Jared maintained that he'd never had contact with the stalker until he had found the man, dead.  John wondered why the stalker had text messaged Jared to meet him on the terrace.  Jessica suggested that Jared contact a lawyer, but Natalie refused to consider it.  She declared that her husband was innocent.\n\n\nWhen Bo and John wondered if they would find Jared's fingerprints on the murder weapon, Jared revealed that they would.  According to Jared, he had picked up the murder weapon after he had discovered the body.  Natalie confirmed Jared's story.  John admitted that things looked bleak for Jared.\n\n\nAs everyone entered the living room, Oliver arrived.  John asked Oliver to collect Jared's computer as evidence.  Jared strongly objected to the computer being removed; he insisted that there was sensitive business information on the hard drive.  Bo didn't think that Clint would have a problem with him searching the computer for possible evidence that might exonerate Jared.  John offered a compromise; he suggested that Oliver check the computer on the premises.\n\n\nOliver went to work and within a short time found numerous electronic bank receipts that confirmed money transfers from Jared Banks to Wayne Landers, the dead stalker.  Jared claimed that he had been set up.  John and Bo decided to arrest Jared.  Jared begged Natalie to believe him and then warned her to be on guard.  Natalie vowed that she would get Jared out of the mess that he was in. \n\n\n",
