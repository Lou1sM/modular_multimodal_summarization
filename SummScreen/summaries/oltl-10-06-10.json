    "soap_central": "\n\nNora arrived in Bo's office at the police station with a bagful of Rodi's burgers.  She found Bo weighted down with the Eli Clarke case, as well as Danielle's recent disappearance.  Nora remained amazed that Eli could have survived the fire in Tahiti, and feared that Eli might have had a hand in what had happened to Dani.  Bo assured Nora he would find the girl, and said he didn't think either of her two fathers had made off with her.  His spirits lifted when he realized Nora had another lunch delivery for the two of them.\n\n\nWhile chowing down on their burgers, Bo and Nora each worked their phones on their respective cases.  After finishing a call, Bo informed Nora that Natalie was over at Todd's searching for clues to Dani's whereabouts, but he feared she hadn't found anything.  Nora fussed over her own case, but couldn't help but notice Bo's obvious distraction.  She feared he had lost his taste for burgers, but Bo said it wasn't that -- he was fed up with them eating all their meals in the office, and never having any time alone together off the job.  Nora agreed, and she and Bo decided to leave the case to John, take the hour off, and \"blow this joint\" arm in arm.\n\n\nBrody pounded on the door to the Ford brothers' apartment as inside, James begged Ford not to let on that James was hiding Danielle.  Feverishly multi-tasking, he asked Starr over the phone if anyone had told the cops he was hiding Dani, but Starr said no one had spilled the beans.  As Ford bickered with him about getting caught up in the Mannings' problems and Brody continued to demand entry, James was forced to hang up on Starr.\n\n\nFord shouted to Brody that he was getting dressed, then grudgingly ordered James to head to the rear of the apartment and stay there while he dealt with Brody.  As James hid, Ford let Brody in.  \"What are you hiding in here?\" Brody asked him.\n\n\nHiding in one of the bedrooms, James listened in on Ford and Brody's confrontation.  When his phone buzzed with another call from Starr, he ignored it.  At Todd's, Starr was confused and dejected.  Back at the apartment, James whispered to the hidden Dani to stay quiet as he continued to monitor Brody and Ford.\n\n\nIn the living area, Brody asked Ford if he was alone, and Ford said that James was studying in the back room.  He asked what Brody wanted, and Brody said it wasn't police business -- he wanted to talk about Jessica.  Ford said they had nothing to discuss; as far as he was concerned, her baby was Brody's.  Brody reminded him that they wouldn't know that for sure until the paternity test, but warned him that his involvement had led to Jessica developing hypertension.  \"Is she okay?\" Ford asked.  \"What's it to you?\" Brody snapped, getting in his face.\n\n\nFord told Brody he cared what happened to Jessica, but Brody laughed off his attempt at \"passing as a human being.\"  He warned Ford that he had spent all day chasing after one runaway child caught between two fathers, and he wouldn't allow his son or daughter to face the same heartache in a custody battle someday.  Ford promised not to fight Brody for custody of the baby.\n\n\nOn his way out, Brody told Ford that the girl he was searching for was Danielle, Nate's girlfriend, and asked if Ford knew anything about her whereabouts.  Ford told Brody he barely knew Nate, let alone Dani.  Brody ordered him to call the station if he discovered anything, and left.\n\n\nJames reentered the living area, stunned to hear that his brother could be a father.  Ford attempted to drop the subject, but as James continued to push him for details, he spilled the story of his dalliance with Jessica.  He insisted that there was only a slim chance he could be the baby's father, but Brody wouldn't stop harassing him -- he didn't want anything to do with the child, and he wanted Jessica and her \"cop\" to be happy and leave him alone.  \"That's not what I heard,\" James teased.  As Ford continued to deny caring about Jessica and the baby, James asked his big brother if he intended to cut his kid loose just as Inez had done to them.\n\n\nFord said his situation and Inez's were nothing alike -- Jessica's child was a Buchanan, set for life, with two loving parents.  But James called Brody crazy, and insisted that \"Bobby\" would make a good father, the same way the Fords could become a good family again.  Ford warned that it could all fall apart if James went away for kidnapping a minor.  James asked if Ford wanted Danielle to leave, but Ford reluctantly said she could stay until they figured something else out.  James thanked him for his help, but Ford said he wasn't doing it for Dani, or Nate -- he just wanted to wipe the smug look off Brody Lovett's face.\n\n\nAs Ford prepared to leave to pick up food for Dani, James thanked him and said Ford was a good guy after all.  \"Don't,\" Ford warned, sensing the trajectory of James's gushing.  \"You're a natural!\" James insisted.  \"I don't wanna hear it,\" Ford declared. \"Baby isn't mine, end of story.\"  With that, he left.\n\n\nOver at Todd's, Natalie was hard at work outside the house, hunting for clues.  She spotted Cole on his way out, and told him she was collecting evidence in the search for Dani.  She showed him James's bullet necklace, and asked Cole if he had any idea who it could belong to.  Cole instantly recognized the necklace.\n\n\nAt first, Cole played dumb, but as Natalie continued to ponder the necklace, he lost his patience.  \"It would take a total jackass to wear something that stupid,\" he blurted out.  Natalie asked whom he meant, just as Starr exited the house.  \"Ask Starr,\" Cole snapped, and walked off.\n\n\nAlone with Natalie, Starr struggled to maintain an innocent fa\u00e7ade, despite her cousin's probing questions about the necklace.  Noting the bullet's caliber and the fact that it had been fired, Natalie recalled the caliber of the bullet Starr had accidentally shot James Ford with.  She asked Starr if the necklace belonged to James, and Starr confessed that it did.  She said that James had kept it because it reminded him of her.\n\n\n\"So he has a thing for you?\" Natalie asked.  Starr said James had been interested in her, but she had told him she was with Cole, and he had gotten rid of the necklace.  When Natalie asked how the necklace could have ended up outside Dani's window, Starr reluctantly admitted that she had held onto the necklace, expecting that James would want it back.  She asked if Natalie had ever gotten mixed up with the wrong guy, and ended up with something she hadn't meant to hold onto, but couldn't throw away.  Struck by the parallel to her own troubles, Natalie told Starr she understood.\n\n\nBelieving the necklace to be unrelated to the case, Natalie gave it back to Starr, and asked her to call if she heard from Dani.  She warned Starr that Cole hadn't seemed happy to see James's necklace again.\n\n\nAt Marty's place, Hannah rummaged through Marty's case files and discovered the file on Brody.  Scanning the documents, she found mention of Ford and Jessica, and secrets that Brody couldn't confess.  Before she could read further, Marty returned, surprised to find Hannah reading the files.  Suspicious, she warned the girl that her files were confidential.  Hannah claimed that she had knocked the files over and was only cleaning them up, then rushed off to cook dinner as Marty picked up Brody's file.\n\n\nSoon thereafter, Marty told Hannah she had to go to the police station to speak to John.  Eyeing Hannah with caution, she said she would see Hannah later.\n\n\nMinutes after Marty's departure, Hannah was surprised by Cole's arrival.  Cole was clearly pleased to see Hannah.  As he entered the house, Hannah told him Marty was out, but Cole said he was there to see Hannah, to apologize for avoiding her.  Hannah said she couldn't blame him after everything she had done, and promised to keep her distance.  \"What if I don't want that?\" Cole asked.\n\n\nCole said that he and Starr had agreed to steer clear of Hannah and James, respectively, but Starr hadn't kept her promise, so he didn't see why he should.  Hannah warned him that whatever was between Starr and James didn't matter, as Starr loved him and he loved her.  Cole reminded Hannah that they had been through a lot together, but Hannah said that Starr and James had, as well, and it didn't mean Starr loved Cole any less.  Cole apologized for dumping his problems on Hannah, and said he was a hypocrite -- he hated that Starr had feelings for someone else, but she wasn't the only one.\n\n\nFloored, Hannah asked Cole if he was joking.  \"No,\" Cole replied. \"I care about you.\"  Hannah couldn't believe what he was saying, and told him not to make a fool of her; she couldn't handle hearing what she had always dreamed of hearing from Cole, because she knew he would take it back.  \"This isn't a joke, or revenge,\" Cole said, advancing on Hannah. \"It's the truth.\"  With that, he kissed her.\n\n\nAt the Fords' apartment, James answered a knock at the door, expecting that Ford had forgotten his key.  Instead, he found Starr standing there.\n\n\nMarty arrived at the police station and immediately ran into Brody.  She told him that she was open to another session if he needed to unload again.  Heading down the corridor, she encountered Natalie, and said she was looking for John.  On her best behavior, Natalie greeted Marty and asked what she needed John for.  \"It's personal,\" Marty muttered, and stalked off.\n\n\n\"Why do I even try?\" Natalie said, sighing as she walked over to Brody.  Brody said he liked Marty, who had been a great help to him.  Natalie asked how, and Brody confessed that he had been seeing Marty as a therapist to deal with the pressures of the baby situation.  Horrified, Natalie asked if he had told Marty about their one-night stand.\n\n\nBrody said he hadn't told Marty about his night with Natalie, only about his anger regarding Ford and Jessica.  He had no one else to turn to about his feelings, and couldn't keep sharing clandestine meetings with Natalie that would look suspicious.  He promised Natalie he would get better at keeping their secret.  He had hoped to confess everything to Jessica, but with her hypertension, he feared she could lose the baby.\n\n\nNatalie told Brody that all he could do for the moment was comfort Jessica and hold it together.  She asked him to stop talking to Marty, and Brody informed her that even if he told Marty the truth, he was protected by doctor-patient confidentiality.  \"I know everyone likes her, but I don't trust her,\" Natalie muttered, and ordered Brody to find a new therapist.  As Natalie and Brody headed down the hall, Marty walked up, perturbed by her glimpse of their hushed conversation.\n\n\nOver at La Boulaie, Dorian pressured a frazzled Blair to take medication to help her sleep, but Kelly rushed into the drawing room and intervened.  As Dorian and Kelly began to argue, Blair stepped in and told her clan that she wouldn't be able to rest until Dani was home safe.  Remembering Dani's distress over leaving Llanview, she couldn't believe that Dani had gone off alone, and blamed herself for not looking after T\u00e9a's daughter as she had promised.  Just then, the guards dragged in Todd.  Todd ordered Dorian to get him released, because he had important information: \"Eli Clarke is alive.\"\n\n\nKelly told the guards to let Todd go, and said he was \"family.\"  As Todd was released, he told the stunned Cramers that Blair wasn't safe there, and explained that John had discovered that Eli had staged his death in Tahiti.  Todd believed Eli was headed for La Boulaie to take revenge on Kelly and Blair, and decided to search the grounds.  Reeling, Dorian agreed with Todd that La Boulaie would be Eli's first stop, and immediately called the police.  She told her girls that Eli was hell-bent on vengeance, and it was only a question of which of them would be Eli's first target.\n\n\nAs Todd returned to the drawing room, he dispelled Blair's fears that Eli had Dani.  He told Blair he knew who had Dani, but not where; as long as the girl stayed hidden, she was safe.\n\n\nAs Kelly and Dorian gave them a moment alone in the foyer, Todd told Blair he agreed with Dorian that she needed protection, and said he wanted to get her and the boys out of Llanview.  Blair refused to run, but Todd reminded her that Eli knew La Boulaie's security inside and out.  Blair said she had no intention of bunking at his place, but Todd suggested they take a boat and sail away with the kids after retrieving Dani.  Blair said they had a life in Llanview, and couldn't just sail away from everything they knew.  \"Why are you doing this?\" she asked.  \"Because I lost T\u00e9a,\" Todd said softly. \"And I just don't want to lose you.\"\n\n\nSitting on the staircase, Todd told Blair that she had almost died in Tahiti, but promised he would be there to save her the next time Eli went after her.  Taking Blair in his arms, he said he didn't want to put their boys through what Dani had been through when she lost T\u00e9a.  \"Come with me,\" he pleaded.  Blair reluctantly agreed, and as Todd rose to leave and retrieve their boat, Blair told him to hurry back.\n\n\nOutside, Dorian and her security team watched Kelly brood.  Dorian pleaded with Kelly to come in from the cold, and encouraged her to let the security team and the police do their jobs.  Kelly couldn't get the thought of Eli still on the loose out of her head, and began quietly goading him to show his face - \"I'm waiting.\"  She laughed at Dorian's promise of police protection, and said that the cops wouldn't know a thing about Eli if not for her and her investigation into Melinda's death.  \"You've done your job,\" Dorian insisted.  \"Not until Eli Clarke pays,\" Kelly shot back.\n\n\nDorian told Kelly she had loved Melinda, and that her sister had never gotten anything she deserved, except Kelly.  She said Melinda wouldn't want Kelly risking her life.  \"Don't you want to see this man dead?\" Kelly asked.  Dorian admitted she did, but said that vengeance was a dark, messy road.  \"You could lose your soul,\" Dorian warned, \"and I'm not going to let that happen to you.\"\n\n\nReturning to the foyer, Kelly continued to quietly rage about Eli remaining at large.  She wondered how long he would continue to evade justice, and how many more people he would hurt.  \"Elijah Clarke is capable of anything,\" she warned Dorian.\n\n\nOn the docks, Ross asked Eli what he was doing back in Llanview, and Eli said his plans had changed -- they needed to pick up Danielle and leave immediately.  Ross told him they couldn't, and explained Dani's disappearance.  \"What the hell happened?\" Eli snapped, livid. \"How could you let her out of your sight?\"  Ross told him the police were searching for the girl, and Eli was infuriated at the thought of the town crawling with cops.\n\n\nRoss was consumed with worry over Dani, but Eli had other things on his mind.  Fuming, Eli couldn't believe such a thing could happen after everything he had worked so hard for.  \"What have you worked so hard for?\" Ross asked, confused.  Eli claimed he only wanted to get Dani back for his brother, but Ross remained unconvinced and suggested Eli head back to Caracas, where Ross and Dani could meet him.  Turning cold, Eli asked why Ross and Dani would ever show up if Ross had what he wanted.\n\n\nRoss was sorry for Eli's predicament, but urged him to start over once again, just as he had so many times before.  Eli told Ross that starting over took cash, cash he no longer had access to thanks to John and Kelly's meddling in his affairs.  He told Ross they needed to use Dani to squeeze Todd for every penny he had.  Ross rejected the idea, and said Todd would never play ball. Ross added that he would never give Dani up again, to Todd or anyone else.  \"What if she's not yours to give?\" Eli asked, voice eerily quiet.\n\n\nEli urged Ross to cooperate with his scheme, and said he would take Dani until Todd paid up, then give her back to Ross safe and sound, and ride off into the sunset alone.  \"With Dani's trust fund?\" Ross asked, dubious.  Eli suggested Ross consider it payment for getting his daughter back, and said they should leave immediately and find Dani.  Ross he said he needed to check in with the police and get information on the search for Dani, but Eli was instantly suspicious.  Pulling a gun, he ordered Ross to give him the phone.\n\n\nHanding Eli the phone, Ross reminded Eli that they were brothers.  Eli told Ross their blood connection had cost him everything, ever since Ross had called him a year before, whining about T\u00e9a taking Dani.  Ross admitted to blackmailing Eli to go to Llanview, and said he had been desperate.  \"And here you are again,\" Eli snapped, \"story of your sad, sorry life.\"\n\n\nRoss was confident Eli wouldn't kill him, but Eli laughed off their family bond -- he explained that he had gotten T\u00e9a pumped full of poison and murdered just to get his brother's kid back, but Ross remained ungrateful.  \"You killed T\u00e9a?\" Ross cried, horrified.  \"And you're next,\" Eli murmured, raising the gun.\n\n\nRoss was stunned that Eli had murdered T\u00e9a, but Eli said he had done anything he could for his brother, all to no avail and with no payoff.  \"What do you want?\" Ross asked.  Eli said he didn't want anything from Ross, because Ross had nothing to give him anymore -- they hadn't been able to hold onto Dani long enough to get her out of the country, and Ross was useless to him without Dani as leverage against Todd.  Ross mused that John had warned him that Eli would turn on him.  \"You should've listened,\" Eli replied, and pulled the trigger, shooting Ross.\n\n\nRoss collapsed onto the docks, struggling to breathe.  \"Sorry, Ross,\" Eli sighed. \"I always loved you, even when you were a pain.  It was nice having a brother.\"  With his last breath, Ross croaked Dani's name.  \"Don't worry,\" Eli soothed. \"You'll be together again soon.\"  Then, he shoved Ross's body into the water and watched it sink.\n\n\nAs Eli stared at the water, he heard a noise nearby, and trained his gun at the source of the sound: Todd. \n\n\n",
