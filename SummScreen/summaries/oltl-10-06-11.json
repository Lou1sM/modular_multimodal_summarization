    "soap_central": "\n\nT\u00e9a was asleep when she muttered, \"Victor,\" and woke up. Tina entered, and immediately apologized for waking T\u00e9a up. She explained that Dani had let her into the house, and that she was there about her missing dog. She continued that David Vickers had found her way into T\u00e9a's room the day before, and Tina had thought that the dog could have returned. T\u00e9a revealed that she hadn't seen the dog. Tina promised that, as soon as she found David Vickers, she would return the paper the dog had taken.\n\n\nTina continued that it had looked like a legal paper, but T\u00e9a realized that it had probably been one of Victor's papers. Tina was proud of her dog for warning everyone about the bomb, and wondered how Irene could have planted the bomb. Tina admitted that she was glad that Irene was dead, \"again,\" and wanted to thank Tomas for it. T\u00e9a said that she had to get ready for Tomas' arraignment, and Tina offered to testify that Tomas was a hero for his actions. T\u00e9a replied that Starr was the one she was worried about. Tina observed that T\u00e9a had a lot of clients all at once.\n\n\nA short while later, T\u00e9a left Blair a message that she should call T\u00e9a back with news of Todd. Tina returned to the room, and said that she couldn't find David Vickers anywhere in the house. Tina wondered how T\u00e9a could function at work after losing Victor, and not being able to find Todd, because Tina could barely function after losing her dog. T\u00e9a informed Tina that work saved her life, because it helped her to focus on things other than Victor.\n\n\nTina admired T\u00e9a for being so strong, but T\u00e9a insisted that she wasn't as strong as she looked. Tina expressed her sympathy for T\u00e9a, and reminded her that they were sisters-in-law. She told T\u00e9a to ask for anything she needed from Tina, and the women embraced. T\u00e9a thanked her, and Tina left.\n\n\nTodd stirred in his sleep. Blair touched his face, and Todd suddenly awoke, and grabbed her arm. \"What are you doing?\" he demanded to know. Todd muttered on about how Irene had the gun that could clear him, and that she was going to kill his family. Blair assured him that everyone was fine, and that Irene was dead. \"She dead, 'cause I killed her,\" he stated. A confused Blair told him that Tomas had confessed, but Todd insisted that he'd done it. He related that it didn't matter anyway, because everyone thought he'd killed Victor, and Irene had gotten rid of the gun that could clear him.\n\n\nTodd told Blair to close the windows, because he was freezing. She saw that no windows were open, and felt his head as he pulled the blankets tighter around himself. She told him that he was burning up. A short while later, she explained that Dorian had called in an antibiotic for Todd, and she had to go pick it up. He grabbed her hand, and wanted to know how long she was going to be gone. Todd wondered if he was going to die. Todd didn't want her to go, because, \"If I die, I don't want to die alone.\" She told him not to talk like that.\n\n\nOn the phone, T\u00e9a wondered why Tomas' arraignment had been set, but Starr's hadn't. She angrily promised to take it up with the judge, and hung up. Just then, her phone rang, and she answered it to Blair. She told T\u00e9a that she'd found Todd, who wasn't doing very well, at Viki's cabin. She asked T\u00e9a to pick up Todd's antibiotic, because he was too sick for Blair to leave him alone.\n\n\nT\u00e9a promised to get the prescription as soon as she was done in court. Blair informed T\u00e9a that Todd had confessed to shooting Irene. T\u00e9a wanted to figure out why Tomas was taking the blame for Todd's crime. T\u00e9a promised to be at the cabin within an hour, and expressed the faith she had in Blair to keep Todd alive. Blair hung up the phone, and wiped her eyes. Todd called her a crybaby, and wondered if she was crying because Todd was going to die, or because he was going to live.\n\n\nBlair claimed that she was scared for Starr because of the situation that Todd had put her in. She told Todd that T\u00e9a was getting the prescription, so he had to hang on. \"Piece of cake,\" he replied weakly. She told him that he had eight years of tormenting her to make up for. He agreed, and she went to get him a cold compress. She talked to Todd as she prepared it, but received no answer. She found Todd unconscious on the couch, and begged him to open his eyes.\n\n\nJessica looked at Natalie's paternity test results, and picked up some matches. Cord entered, and she stuffed both into her purse. She hugged Cord, and expressed how happy she was that he was home. He told her that she didn't look very happy, but she was just exhausted because of Ryder. She wondered where Tina was, and he told her that Tina was out looking for her dog. He related how much better off everyone would be if Tina cared about people half as much as she cared about her dog.\n\n\nCord related that Tina always had secrets that she used for blackmailing purposes. Jessica wondered if Cord thought that Tina was still capable of blackmail. He didn't think it mattered, because he sensed that something was wrong with Jessica. She explained about her fight with Natalie. Cord reminded her that he was staying right upstairs if she ever needed to talk. She thanked him, and left the room.\n\n\nCord saw one of Tina's \"missing dog\" flyers on the table and smiled, as Tina entered the room. She asked if David Vickers had returned, but Cord hadn't seen the dog. Tina whined that David Vickers going missing was the worst thing to happen to her. Cord angrily reminded her that their daughter had once been presumed dead. Tina remembered, and insisted that she'd only exaggerated because she was upset.\n\n\nTina never wanted to relive when Carlo Hesser had tied Sarah up, and sent her over the waterfall, like he'd done to Tina. Cord related that everyone had thought Tina was dead. She angrily recalled that she'd fought her way back just to find that Cord had married Kate Sanders. She reminisced about the kind Indians that had nursed her back to health, and related that she'd only been thinking of Cord the whole time. He mentioned that she'd given him a child that hadn't been his, but she reasoned that they'd gotten married anyway, because they'd loved each other.\n\n\nTina smiled as she thought about having Sarah, but Cord remembered that Tina hadn't even been sure that Sarah was Cord's. She said that they always got back together, but he countered that it never lasted. Cord told her that she always had a way of getting through to him. The two pulled each other closer.\n\n\nAs James moved things around in the kitchen, Ford sleepily told James to quiet down. James said that he was putting together a care package for Starr, even though he knew that the only thing she needed was her dad. He told Ford about the one thing Starr had asked him to do, but he'd messed it up. Ford thought that all Starr needed was to see James.\n\n\nA short while later, James was gone, and Jessica arrived with Ryder. Ford noticed Jessica's black eye, so she told him about her fight with Natalie. Jessica remarked on how much Ryder was starting to look like Ford. Ford related that, even when everyone had believed that Ryder was Brody's, Ford had felt a pull towards Ryder that he hadn't been able to ignore. He continued that finding out Ryder was his had been the best day of his life, but Jessica asked him to stop talking.\n\n\nFord apologized for saying the wrong thing, and he expressed how happy he was that Ryder had made him and Jessica friends. He related that Natalie and Brody had already been friends, so it probably hadn't taken much for them to get to the next level. He instantly apologized for the statement, but Jessica informed him that she'd watched Liam the night before. She was confused about how she'd felt about it, and Ford wondered why. \"Because of this,\" Jessica said, and handed him Natalie's paternity test results.\n\n\nA guard gave Starr breakfast and told her that she would be there for a while. She asked for news about Todd and demanded to talk to John or Bo. Tomas said that the guard should tell her what he knew or leave her alone, but the guard walked away. Tomas assured Starr that Todd had survived eight years of torture, so he was sure that Todd had \"more reasons than ever to stay alive.\"\n\n\nStarr remembered that Tomas had been at the docks the night before, and wondered if he'd seen Todd. He replied that he'd only found Irene, and had taken his shot at her. Starr feared that Irene had killed Todd and dumped his body in the river. He assured Starr that Blair was looking for Todd, and if she found him, Todd would be in good hands. Starr realized that Todd had been hurt. She was yelling that she had a right to know what had happened when James entered.\n\n\nJames wondered what was wrong, but Starr said she was fine. James regretfully told her that his plan to get Jack to confess his lies hadn't worked. She wasn't concerned about Jack, and only cared about whether or not Todd was all right. She related that Tomas knew something but refused to talk. James walked over to Tomas' cell, and demanded that Tomas tell Starr what he knew about Todd.\n\n\nStarr knew that Tomas was trying to protect her, but she knew she could take the truth. T\u00e9a entered, and Starr asked about Todd. Lowering her voice, T\u00e9a confided that Todd was alive, but he'd been shot. She continued that things were bad, but that Blair was taking care of him. The guard warned T\u00e9a that the judge was waiting for her, so she assured Starr that Todd had too much to live for, and left. James attempted to comfort Starr through the bars.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica keeps quiet about the document that names John instead of Brody as Liam's father and goes to Robert Ford's home. She somehow concludes that she is comfortable showing it to him, wondering why her Aunt Tina had it in her possession and what she should do about it. He seems to understand all too well, her very tempting option of using it to break up Natalie and Brody. After Todd was shot and is stranded in Viki's cabin with Blair, she struggles to save his life without a doctor knowing it will only send Todd back to prison. She manages to urge Tea to help her after Tea is done representing both Starr who is in jail for helping her dad escape from jail, and Tomas who has taken the rap for killing Irene although everybody knows Todd did it. And it seems Blair and Todd are reliving their history and how they fell in love. Tina goes looking for her dog who is missing when Cord confronts her to tell her he will never forgive her for the things she's done. Yet they end up staring adoringly at each other and indicate they may still have feelings for each other.",
