    "soap_central": "\nCold-Blooded Woman\n\n\nIn Colombia, Cristian, Vanessa, and Lola prepared to leave for the United States, but their plans were dashed due to a tropical storm. As Cristian and the ladies rushed back to the house, they were soaked and forced to change their wet clothes. Cristian stripped off his shirt, and Vanessa, in a bathrobe, gave him some of Ray's old clothes. Cristian told Vanessa that they'd leave the next day, and Vanessa reassured him that Ray would be home soon. Cristian asked her about how she became involved with Ray Montez, and Vanessa kept things ambiguous. When Lola emerged from her room to ask Cristian questions about America, Cristian promised her she would find an exciting new life in Llanview. After the girl left, Vanessa commented on how sheltered her stepdaughter was, and how much she meant to Vanessa. Cristian told Vanessa that she and Lola would not be alone in Llanview; she'd still have his friendship and support. Vanessa told him he was very kind, and that \"[his] Sarah\" was a lucky woman. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, Nora, Antonio, and Talia cornered Ray at Llanview High and ordered him to accompany them back to the station. Nora told him he was wanted for questioning in connection with the disappearance of Cristian Vega, whom Ray claimed not to know. Reluctantly, Ray said his goodbyes to Langston and her friends, but warned her that they were still going back to Colombia. With the adults gone, Langston and the teens freaked out about the implications of Ray's run-in with the police. Starr wondered if Dorian had made a move, and Langston asked how Nora had found out about Ray. Langston became upset, and said she wished Dorian had not started the feud with Clint in the first place. She said that no matter what the cops did, it would not make a difference--Ray would still take her back to Colombia and away from Starr, whom she had promised to support through her pregnancy. Cole and the others calmed Langston down, and assured her she wasn't going anywhere. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair welcomed Dorian home with a hug while Dorian berated Judge Jenkins for making her grovel to him. She told Blair she had a plan to deal with Clint and Ray, and right on cue, Jackie McNaughton arrived at the door. Blair was dubious about Dorian's new association, even as Jackie insisted he was \"a consultant.\" Dorian hustled her \"consultant\" into the drawing room, away from prying eyes, while Blair eavesdropped. \n\n\nInside the drawing room, Dorian told Jackie she was still in need of his services--\"I want Ray Montez removed from Langston's life, permanently.\" She explained the situation with Clint and the clash over Cramer Enterprises, but said she would not take Clint's deal, claiming that Clint had no guarantee that Ray would relinquish custody even if she came through. Jackie didn't buy that Ray's word was Dorian's only concern, and realized she wanted to have both the company and Langston. Dorian responded by railing about how hard she had worked to acquire the company from the Buchanans. She said Clint could not get everything he wanted while she scraped by with nothing. Jackie said Dorian's passion for victory was obvious, but asked her, \"Are you a killer?\" \"Do it, Jackie,\" Dorian replied, handing him an envelope full of cash. Jackie agreed to Dorian's request, but warned her that since he had taken her money, \"there's no going back.\" \n\n\nOutside the drawing room, Blair's eavesdropping was interrupted by Addie's arrival. Blair hadn't heard the details of Dorian and Jackie's transaction, but told her mother that Dorian was trying to deal with the Ray Montez problem. Addie fretted over the unhappiness the Cramer women were facing, and said the only one who seemed happy was Blair. Blair was confused, and asked Addie how she figured that. Addie told Blair that she could tell when her daughter was happy, and said it had to be because of \"that handsome policeman you're sleeping with.\" \n\n\nBlair was embarrassed, and tried to lie that she and John were not sleeping together. But Addie saw through her; \"What are you doing, playing checkers? Honestly, Blair, I'm so happy that you've found someone to play checkers with!\" Blair reluctantly admitted that she and John were friends, \"with benefits,\" as Addie termed it. Addie asked if they could be something more than that, and urged Blair to think with her heart, and not her head. Blair agreed that she was open to John being more than just a friend. Addie told Blair to do as she did: \"Carpe diem! (Seize the day)\" Addie said she never knew how much time she had left after all her years in St. Anne's and the uncertainties of her new medication, and told Blair to take as many chances with her own life as her mother had with hers. \n\n\nAt the morgue, John reviewed the police report on the van crash in Ireland, while flashing back to his own memories of the explosion that \"killed\" Marty. He entered an exam room and met with Michael, who was preoccupied regarding a lost patient as well as Rex, who he said was still in critical condition. John expressed his sympathies. He reminded Michael about the X-rays for the mystery woman, which John had brought him from Lee Ramsey's office, and told Michael she might not be a mystery for much longer. John tried to keep his true thoughts concealed while talking in veiled terms about the circumstances surrounding Marty's injuries. He asked Michael if the mystery woman could have survived the explosion. Michael told John that the woman from the X-rays could not have been in the explosion, but had to have been pulled from the van wreckage just before. That left the crash as the only explainable cause for her injuries. When Michael asked John how he knew so much about the exact circumstances of the incident the woman had been injured in, John was forced to confess his suspicions: the mystery woman was Marty. \n\n\nMichael was dubious, but John pressed on, and told Michael that Mayor Lowell wanted him off the case, but he would not give up. He was positive that Ramsey had doubled back after the crash and saved Marty while John was preoccupied with Cole. As John and Michael argued, John lay out the connections between Todd and Ramsey, including their mysteriously using the same nurse and both having unknown women in their homes, with Todd appearing at the penthouse and then gaining a houseguest just after Ramsey was killed. Michael asked why Todd would imprison Marty, and John said that Todd was a lunatic and didn't need a reason. He was determined to barge into Todd's place and blow the case wide open, while Michael urged him not to risk his badge. John said that for Marty, it would be worth it. Michael pleaded with him to wait and gather more information, lest he cause Todd to move Marty to a place where she could never be found. John calmed down and grudgingly agreed. As John left the morgue, Michael warned him not to set himself up for disappointment if he didn't find what he was looking for. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint confided in Dallas about the details of his campaign against Dorian, and said that at any moment, Dorian would agree to his terms and he would get Buchanan Enterprises back. Dallas marveled at Clint's masterful strategy. \n\n\nDown at the police station, Nora, Antonio, and Talia grilled Ray in an interrogation room. They showed him a picture of Cristian, but Ray insisted that he had never seen the man before. When the officers asked about the circumstances of his release from Plato Prison, Ray said he had been exonerated and no new trial had been necessary. While Ray asked for and got his \"one phone call,\" Nora and the cops conferred. Nora kept the Clint connection to herself, while Antonio and Talia tried to figure out the connection between Cristian, Ray, and Llanview. \n\n\nWith Antonio and Talia out of the room, Ray called Clint and told him he had been taken into custody by the LPD. Clint was furious when Ray told him \"the lady DA\" was giving him a hard time, and ordered Ray to put Nora on the phone. Nora had a terse, \"official\" conversation with her significant other, and ignored Clint's angry demand that she let Ray walk. Nora told him that if he didn't like how she operated, maybe he shouldn't live with the DA, then she hung up on Clint. \n\n\nAs Antonio and Talia returned to the room, the trio resumed their interrogation of Ray. Nora showed him pictures of Carlo and \"Mortimer Bern,\" but Ray denied knowing the men. When Antonio brought up his flying to the States on the same plane as Jared Banks, Ray saw an opening and busted Nora and Clint, claiming he was in town to do business with the Buchanans as well as see to Langston. As Talia continued to question Ray, Antonio took Nora aside and demanded she explain things. Chagrined, Nora said there could not be a connection between Ray's dealings with Clint and Cristian's disappearance. She told Antonio and Talia to throw Ray in a holding cell and, as the officers took Montez away, Antonio pointedly told Nora to have a talk with Clint. \n\n\nDorian placed a call to Clint, who expected Dorian to agree to his offer. He was shocked when Dorian told him there would be no deal, and he said she was bluffing. Dorian said she wouldn't bluff, and told him to tell Ray that if he wanted Langston, \"come and get her.\" As she hung up, Addie entered the drawing room, asking about Dorian's meeting with Jackie. Dorian made up a quick lie to cover her tracks. \n\n\nIn the park, Todd and Marty unpacked the food for their picnic as Marty rejoiced in the sunlight and their \"perfect day.\" Todd said it was time for them to figure out their future together, but Marty said that though she had decided to put her rape behind her, she still needed to learn about the rest of her past if she was going to look forward. Todd promised to help Marty learn about the rest of her history, and handed her a travel atlas, so she could pick where they would go to start their new lives. While considering different parts of the world, Marty reminded Todd that if she had to let go of her past, he needed to do the same. Todd claimed he was ready to let go, but Marty challenged him, asking why he was still wearing his wedding ring. \n\n\nJohn returned home and called one of his contacts, asking for more information on Todd's most recent employees-his bodyguard Keys and the private nurse, Janet Ketring. While staring at the framed photo of himself with Marty, he urged his contact to dig deeper. John mused over his file on Marty, but put everything away when he heard a knock on the door. When John went to answer it, he found Blair on his doorstep. \n\n\n",
