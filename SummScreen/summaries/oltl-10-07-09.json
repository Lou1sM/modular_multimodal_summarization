    "soap_central": "\nChildren Of A Lesser Todd\n\n\nCole and Markko raced around their apartment, scrambling to clean up after themselves in preparation for a visit from the ladies in their lives.  Markko grumbled about Cole's untidiness, while Cole decried the myriad of \"choking hazards\" that lay in wait for Hope in the living room.  Starr and Langston arrived with Hope, and immediately turned up their noses at the boys' bachelor lifestyle.  Embarrassed, Cole ushered Starr and Hope into his room.\n\n\nLangston cozied up to Markko and examined his computer.  Markko explained that he'd finished his film project, but had something else to show her: video footage of their making love on the couch.  Langston was mortified, and Markko apologized for accidentally leaving the camera on, but wondered if they couldn't keep the footage in a separate file, \"for us.\"  Langston ordered Markko to delete the footage immediately, and Markko agreed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDorian, David, and Amelia arrived at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9  for an \"outreach\" session with Llanview's Latino community.  Dorian began to spin the tale of her long association with the Vega family, but Amelia thwarted her when she  pointed out that Carlotta was wearing a \"Viki Banks\" campaign button.  David needled Dorian about her bad track record as an employer, desperate to drive a wedge between Dorian and her new campaign manager, but nothing seemed to connect.\n\n\nAs they sat in a booth, Dorian delighted in the latest Sun headline, featuring Jared and his arrest for murder.  David only seemed to feel sorry for Jared and Natalie, even after Dorian reminded him that the couple had kept him hostage in Asa's stables.  Dorian complained that the Buchanans had turned David soft, and said that was the reason she'd replaced him with Amelia; after he refused to \"play gay\" for the campaign, she'd realized he no longer had any loyalty to her and couldn't get results.  Her point seemed proven as Amelia walked over and gave Dorian the good news about her boost in the polls.  As Dorian basked in her victory, David seethed.\n\n\nReady for her close-up, Dorian stood to address the predominantly Latino customers of the caf\u00e9: \"Yo soy Dorian Lord!\"  Speaking in broken Spanish, she pointed out the Sun headline about Jared as she asked the citizens of Llanview whether they really wanted to weather another of Viki's family scandals.  Her speech drew applause, and Dorian gloated to David.  Grumpy, David reminded her that she was no innocent, mentioning her role in Nash's death at the Buchanan Enterprises shareholders' meeting.  Dorian scoffed and said that Jared was responsible for Nash's fall; she remarked that he probably had similar plans for Natalie, and said the heiress should watch her back.\n\n\nResuming her star turn, Dorian sat in a booth, cradling a small Hispanic infant in her arms as she told the assembled crowd about her own children.  \"Adriana's father was Latino,\" she said solemnly, and commented that she'd also adopted a Colombian orphan, proving that her roots in Llanview's multi-racial community were deep.  As Dorian held forth, Amelia was on the phone with someone.  Amelia told the person on the other end that she had Dorian Lord eating out of her hand, and promised that \"Part 2\" of their plan was about to begin.  As she ended her call, David cornered her.\n\n\nDavid asked Amelia if she knew of his work as the star on his television show, Supermodel Crime Club.  \"I played a really smart detective, who was smart.\"   David told Amelia he knew she was up to something, and asked who she'd been talking to.  Amelia claimed she'd been speaking with a colleague, setting up a series of campaign events for Dorian.  As Dorian rejoined them, she was thrilled to hear that Amelia was planning a press conference for her to address Llanview's gay and lesbian community.\n\n\nAsleep in her room at La Boulaie, Blair  dreamt of Todd by her bedside; he was thanking her for her loyalty and for helping him rid himself of T\u00e9a.  As Todd drew her into a kiss,  Blair was jolted awake by cold water splashing into her face.  T\u00e9a was standing over her, holding a pitcher of ice water.  \"Rise and shine, bitch,\" she snapped.\n\n\nAs Blair rose from her bed, T\u00e9a accused her of conspiring with Ross, holding up T\u00e9a's  divorce for Blair's own ends.  T\u00e9a blamed Blair for the destruction of her relationship with Todd, but Blair said T\u00e9a  could've averted disaster by telling the truth about Ross in the first place.  She told T\u00e9a that Todd had deserved to know.  T\u00e9a wasn't sure she agreed, but insisted she'd planned to tell him in her own time.  When Blair asked why she'd waited, T\u00e9a muttered, \"I had my reasons.\"\n\n\nBlair wasn't satisfied with T\u00e9a's evasive attitude, and asked her to think back to her near-death experience; she wanted to know why T\u00e9a hid the truth.   Blair knew T\u00e9a's secret had to be something bigger than a dead marriage to Ross.  T\u00e9a deflected the questions by reminding Blair of what was really important: Todd didn't want her, and would never want her again.  She told Blair that  Blair would never be more to Todd than sloppy sex.  Furious, Blair backhanded T\u00e9a  and T\u00e9a slapped her back.\n\n\nReeling, T\u00e9a asked Blair to step back and let them avoid a catfight; she said her choices were none of her rival's business.  But Blair didn't agree, and kept pressing T\u00e9a about her secret.  T\u00e9a asked why Blair couldn't let go of Todd, scoffing at her excuse about \"protecting her kids.\"  Blair shot back that T\u00e9a could never understand what motherhood meant, what it was like to love and protect a child at all costs, especially from a liar like T\u00e9a .  As Blair tore into her, T\u00e9a's face fell.\n\n\nAt the police station, Viki and Charlie watched with concern outside the interview room containing John and Jared.  Viki reassured him that Jared would be fine, but Charlie wasn't convinced.  He asked Viki if she knew that Jared was completely innocent, and confessed that he wasn't sure.  He wondered if Jared had gotten in over his head with something and was being blackmailed.\n\n\nInside the interview room, John went through the facts of the case with the exhausted Jared.  John asked Jared to give him something, anything to clear his name.  Jared insisted that he knew nothing and was completely innocent.  He claimed that he hadn't known Wayne Landers in prison, hadn't paid or communicated with him in any way, and was being framed.  John was skeptical.\n\n\nJared laughed, and said he was beginning to agree with Natalie that John had it in for him.  He accused John of still loving Jared's wife and wanting her for himself.  John said he'd always care about Natalie, and since Jared was unable to account for the evidence against him, John had begun to worry that she'd married a homicidal scam artist.  He said that he wanted to help Jared, and that he knew Jared knew more than he was saying.  He asked Jared to level with him, but Jared said that he wanted his lawyer.\n\n\nJohn received a call from the crime lab, and told Jared to reconsider his statement.  He explained that the lab had found email correspondence between Jared and Landers on Jared's computer, discussing their stalking of Jessica and faking the kidnapping attempt at Buchanan Enterprises.  Jared dismissed the emails as forgeries, planted to make him look guilty, and asked why he would do something like that to the people he loved.  John wasn't satisfied with Jared's answers.\n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd sat alone in the living room, and pondered his solitude.  Hearing a knock on the front door, Todd called out for T\u00e9a and rushed to open it, only to find Natalie standing there.  Natalie held up the latest edition of the Sun and demanded to know why \"Uncle Todd\" had smeared Jared in the press.  She wanted to hire T\u00e9a for Jared's defense, and asked when she'd be back.  \"If I'm lucky, never,\" Todd replied coldly.\n\n\nNatalie was stunned that Todd had disposed of T\u00e9a only a few days into their latest marriage, and said it was record time for him.  Todd said he was done with T\u00e9a, who'd made a fool of him the same way Jared had Natalie.  Natalie snapped that her husband was innocent and she was standing by him, despite Todd's slander in the Sun.  Todd said  the evidence against Jared was damning.  Natalie sarcastically asked him if that should be her excuse for abandoning Jared, the way Todd did to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nTodd said that T\u00e9a had lied to him.  Natalie laughed, reminding Todd that he lied to everyone.  She told him that he was in no position to throw stones, and suggested that he let T\u00e9a explain her mistakes, the way Starr had let Todd explain his own.  She told Todd that she could forgive, and would stand by Jared and hear him out, because he deserved it.  Storming out, Natalie told Todd she could give her husband a chance, even if Todd couldn't do the same for his wife.\n\n\nAt Llanview High, Starr and Langston's American Studies class began, with Nick Chavez as their substitute teacher.  Some of the girls in the class admired Nick's good looks, teasing Starr about her infatuation with Schuyler.  Langston defended Starr, and one student told another that it was hopeless, as she'd seen Nick on television with the  gay/lesbian alliance.  Nick admitted that he was a member of the \"LGLA\"--the Llanview Gay and  Lesbian Alliance-- and said that any questions about him or his work could wait until after class.  As Nick spoke, Starr got a text message from Cole, telling her that Hope was okay.\n\n\nBack at Cole and Markko's apartment, Hope was not okay and was crying hysterically.  As the boys struggled to calm her down, someone knocked at the door.  Markko realized his parents had arrived, and feared their reaction when they discovered Cole's out-of-wedlock child.  Cole said they couldn't hide Hope from the Riveras and ordered Markko to let them in.  As Markko opened the door, Mr. and Mrs. Rivera were surprised to see Cole holding his crying daughter.\n\n\nAt the police station, John left the interview room and met with Viki and Charlie.  He said Charlie could speak to Jared, but they wouldn't be releasing him.\n\n\nAs Charlie entered the interview room, Viki told John that she knew he still cared for Natalie, but promised him that Jared was innocent.  John said all he wanted was to find the truth.  Just then, Natalie walked into the corridor, glaring at John.  Viki told Natalie that John wasn't the enemy.  \"Neither is Jared,\" Natalie replied.\n\n\nInside the interview room, Charlie said that he'd stand by Jared, no matter what, and cautiously said that he could never judge his son, given his own mistakes.  He said that whatever Jared had gotten himself into, they'd work it out together.  Speaking up, Jared said he needed his father's help.  Before he could explain, Natalie entered the room, and Charlie exited to give the couple some time alone.\n\n\nOutside, Viki asked Charlie what Jared had had to say.  Concerned, Charlie mumbled that he hadn't said much, and hugged her.\n\n\nIn the interview room, Natalie embraced Jared and told him she was staying by his side.  \"Natalie, I've been lying to you,\" Jared said with a sigh.\n\n\nAt Cole and Markko's apartment, the Riveras sat on the couch playing with Hope, charmed by the adorable baby.  Markko apologized for the messy apartment, and told his father how much he appreciated his father's gift of a vacuum cleaner.  Everything was going well until Ernesto discovered that, though Cole was caring for his child, he was not married to Starr or living with Hope.  Aurelia smoothed things over by reminding Ernesto that Cole was taking care of his responsibilities.\n\n\nRight on cue, Starr and Langston returned, surprised to see the Riveras.  Ernesto was perturbed that Langston had keys to Markko's place.  He kept his temper as Cole and Starr explained that, though they were raising Hope together, they'd decided to wait for marriage until after Starr finished high school.  Determined to grin and bear it, Ernesto suggested Markko show them his film project.  Markko loaded the video file onto his computer, but was horrified when the footage of his tryst with Langston played instead.\n\n\nDorian and David walked out of the Buenos Dias, as Dorian continued to ramble on with praise for Amelia and her political strategies.  David remained unconvinced, and suspected that Amelia had an agenda of her own.  He glanced inside the caf\u00e9 and saw Amelia once again talking on the phone.\n\n\nInside, Amelia was back on the phone with her co-conspirator, Nick.  Amelia told him their press conference was ready to go later that day, and that Dorian had no idea what they were really planning.\n\n\nBack at Todd's, Todd drowned his sorrows in booze, mulling over Natalie's words about standing by the people she loved.  He picked up his phone and considered calling T\u00e9a.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair and T\u00e9a continued their confrontation.  T\u00e9a grew emotional and said that Blair was wrong, T\u00e9a  could understand being a mother.  Blair scoffed, and said that T\u00e9a was too selfish to care for a child, or know how to love one.  \"How do I know what it's like to love a child?\" T\u00e9a snapped. \"I have one!\" \n\n\n",
