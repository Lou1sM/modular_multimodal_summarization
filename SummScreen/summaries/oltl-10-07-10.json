As they marveled that there was no chance of interruption, Bo's phone began to ring. Then, Nora's phone rang. On the phone, both told the person on the other end of the phone that they would \"be right there.\" The two were sad to see their \"us time\" end, but agreed that their work was never done. They got dressed and talked about their plans for the rest of the day. Nora related that she felt bad for what Todd was going through.\n\n\nAs Ford sat at the bar in Rodi's, a girl walked over to him and asked if there was a chance he could beat the charges because his students missed him. He said there was no chance as Inez entered. Echo, who was also sitting at the bar, told Inez she looked familiar. Inez agreed, but Echo walked away, more interested in Charlie, who had entered Rodi's.\n\n\nInez told Ford that she hated seeing him so miserable and she wanted to make it up to him. Inez explained that Clint had offered to help get Ford his job at Llanview University back. Ford wondered what Clint wanted in return, especially after helping James get the grant. Inez related that Clint was a parent too, and just wanted to help because he was a generous man. Ford warned his mother that there was no such thing as \"a free lunch,\" and left.\n\n\nOn the phone, Clint told the dean that he would end Buchanan Enterprises' support to the university, and hung up. Viki entered and asked if he was threatening someone. Clint put a file entitled \"Robert Ford\" into a drawer and related that he was just playing hardball. Viki told Clint that Echo was back in town. Both agreed that Echo wasn't welcome. Clint regretted his affair with the woman, but Viki had long since forgiven Clint for it. Viki informed Clint that Echo wasn't in town for Clint, but for Charlie.\n\n\nViki explained how Echo and Charlie had met in Atlantic City. Echo said she didn't want anything, but Viki didn't believe her. Clint told Viki to call if Echo gave her any trouble, and Viki left. Clint got a call on his phone about a visitor. He wasn't expecting anyone, but said to let the visitor in. Ford entered and wanted to know why Clint wanted to help Ford get his job back.\n\n\nClint said he was doing it for Inez. Clint went on that he'd had a rough year and he needed good company. He liked spending time with Inez and wanted to help her and her children, since he had the means to. He picked up his phone and called the dean again. He asked her if she had thought any more about Ford. He smiled and told her that he was glad they were seeing eye-to-eye. He got off the phone and told Ford the charge was history and that he should expect a call from the dean soon. Clint also said that he was glad both of his daughters were taken. A wide-eyed Ford thanked Clint and left.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Echo asked Charlie where Viki was, but Charlie needed to speak to Echo alone. Charlie didn't want Echo causing trouble for him and Viki. Charlie said that he didn't want Echo interfering in his marriage, and that he would never cheat on Viki. Echo was happy for him. She claimed to have learned her lesson after what had happened with Clint and said she was trying to be a better person. She wanted to apologize to Viki.\n\n\nCharlie had to leave for work, which surprised Echo because Charlie had \"married a millionaire.\" Charlie hoped Echo understood his suspicions and warned her once again that Viki was the love of his life and that he wouldn't let anything hurt her. They began to reminisce about Atlantic City until Viki entered. Charlie left, and Viki told Echo that they needed to \"get a few things straight.\"\n\n\nAt the police station, Marty asked John why he needed to see her. He informed her that Eli was alive. He explained to her how Ross had probably helped Eli fake Eli's death. She asked where Eli was, but John disclosed that they hadn't found him yet. He said that he would send a patrol car to her house to keep a watch on Marty and Hannah, and Marty left.\n\n\nNate entered the station, complaining about a cop taking him out of school. He maintained that he had answered all of John's questions the night before and that morning. John informed him that Dani could be in danger because Eli was still alive. As Inez entered the station, she saw Nate and asked if he was in trouble. Inez said he had answered all of their questions and asked if they were calling him a liar. John related that he just wanted to find Dani before the \"bad guys\" did.\n\n\nAfter hearing that Dani could be in trouble, he told John about how he had helped her get away. Nate told John he would take him to her.\n\n\nLater, Inez went back to her desk and asked a passing cop if there was any word on Dani. There wasn't. Inez's phone rang, and she answered it to Clint. He asked if she was free for dinner that night, but she needed to spend time with Nate. Clint asked her about after because he had good news and wanted to tell her in person. They agreed to get together later that night.\n\n\nHannah and Cole kissed, but Cole pulled away. Cole claimed that kissing Hannah made his feelings for her stronger. He apologized for being unfair to her and maintained that he loved Starr. Hannah ordered Cole to leave. Hannah related that she had almost died for him, and didn't survive to be Cole's \"go-to girl\" when he and Starr got into fights. Hannah again told him to leave as Marty entered.\n\n\nMarty was surprised to see Cole there. She explained about Eli to Hannah and Cole. Cole assured his mother and a very distressed Hannah that he wouldn't leave them alone. Marty appreciated that Cole was willing to stay with them, but assured him that there would be a patrol car watching over them. \"What about Starr?\" Marty asked. Cole saw no reason for Eli to go after Starr and insisted that he wouldn't leave Marty and Hannah.\n\n\nStarr entered James's apartment and demanded to know where Dani was. Dani entered, and Starr was glad she was safe. Starr explained about Natalie finding James's necklace. Dani hated that everyone was lying for her and thought that she should just give up and leave with Ross. Starr wouldn't let Ross take her, but Dani said that Ford hated that Dani was in his apartment. Starr thought they needed to move on to plan B for multiple reasons. She cited the fact that Cole was the other reason.\n\n\nAfter James went off on Starr for telling Cole, she assured James and Dani that Cole was okay with her helping Dani, but not that James was involved. However, Cole wouldn't say a word. Starr had an idea about what plan B could be, since James and Nate hadn't thought of one. Dani said that no matter where she went, Ross would never stop looking for her. Starr tried to tell Dani that anything was better than going with Ross because that wasn't what T\u00e9a had wanted.\n\n\nThe sisters agreed that they would go through with the plan for T\u00e9a. Starr explained that Todd had a boat and that Dani could stay there for a while. Dani went to get her things together, and Starr gave James's necklace back to him. He told her to keep it so they could keep up with the lie that Starr had told Natalie about the two getting into a fight. Starr thanked James for his help. The two almost kissed, but Dani reentered, ready to leave.\n\n\nJames told both girls that if they ever needed a sister kidnapped again, \"I'm your guy.\" Dani gave James a kiss on the cheek and thanked him for helping her and Nate. He said he was just doing what he thought was best for everyone. The two left. Later, John and Nate arrived at the apartment, looking for Dani. James played dumb, but Nate said that he had told John everything. James said that Dani had been there, but she was gone.\n\n\nEli pushed Ross into the water and told him that he and Dani would be together again soon. Todd walked by and Eli pointed his gun at Todd. Todd took his gun out and pointed it at Eli, saying that Eli was going to die a second time. Eli said it would be better if they just went their separate ways, but Todd disagreed. Eli had faked T\u00e9a's will and made Todd lose Dani. Looking into the bubbling water, Eli assured Todd that he could make sure Ross was no longer a problem.\n\n\nTodd shot Eli. He walked over to him and kicked the gun out of his hand. As Todd stood over him, Eli hit Todd, knocking the gun out of his hand. Todd reached for the gun, but Eli jumped on top of him and the two hit each other. Eli grabbed Todd's gun and pointed it at Todd, telling him not to move. Eli ran away and Todd grabbed the remaining gun. Suddenly, Ross emerged from the water and grabbed Todd's arm.\n\n\nRoss begged for help, but Todd only pointed the gun at him. Todd reasoned that Dani would hate him if he let Ross die, but she probably wouldn't find out anyway. Todd walked away and Ross went back under the water, grasping for the side. Todd returned and helped Ross out of the water. Todd asked why Eli had shot Ross. Ross replied that Eli wanted Dani and passed out.\n\n\nAt the docks, Starr gave Dani the marina pass, and the alarm code for Todd's boat. Starr apologized for having to leave, but Dani thanked her sister for everything she had done. Starr left, and Dani began to walk toward the boat. As she made her way to the boat, she saw Todd holding a gun over an unconscious Ross.\n\n\nStarr arrived in front of her apartment and noticed a stain on the floor that looked like blood. Her thoughts immediately went to Hope as she fumbled in her purse for her keys. She finally entered the apartment to find Eli pointing his gun at her.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Viki goes to talk to Clint and informs him that Echo is back in town and surprisingly used to date Charlie right after she was done with Clint, years ago. Robert Ford asks Clint how it is that he can do all of these \"favors\" for Robert's mother including getting James' grant reinstated and getting Robert's professor job back when he's been charged with sexual harassment. Clint gets on the phone and shows Robert he can do it and asks if it matters how he does it as long as Robert prefers teaching at LU over bussing tables. Todd finds Ross and Eli at the docks and gets in a struggle with them. Ross gets shot by Eli and falls in the river. Todd pulls him out. But right when Starr finds a way for Dani to escape via Todd's yacht at the marina, Dani sees Todd standing over Ross's unconscious body after he's been shot and assumes Todd tried to kill him. Starr returns home and finds that Eli has killed her babysitter and is going to use her and baby Hope as his next hostages. Greg is still unconscious after his scuffle with Eli and everybody knows that he must have been \"working\" with Eli who threatened him or his family. But nobody can ask him or find out the details.",
