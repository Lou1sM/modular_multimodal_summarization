Jessica stated that David Vickers had given it to her, and when she saw that Ford was confused, Jessica stated that she had meant David Vickers, Tina's dog.  After Jessica expressed that David Vickers was gorgeous, Bobby wondered how the dog and Tina had ended up with Liam's paternity test results.  Jessica declared that she did not know.\n\n\nWhen Ford speculated that the document was a fake, Jessica felt that the test might be legitimate and pondered that John McBain might be Liam's father.  Jessica revealed that she had almost told Brody but had changed her mind.  Jessica explained that Liam appeared to make Brody whole, and that she could not take that away from Brody.  However, Bobby felt that if the truth were revealed, Natalie would return to John and have her happy ending, which Jessica did not want.  Ford admitted that if it were up to him, he would show the paper to John, but that it was Jessica's decision to make.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, as Tina and Cord started to kiss, Clint walked in and interrupted.  Cord denied that there was anything to interrupt.  When Tina claimed that she had lost an eyelash, Clint wondered if Cord had been trying to remove it with his lips.  Tina insisted that Cord had been trying to comfort her over the loss of her dog, David Vickers, and asked Cord if they could continue their conversation at a later date.  Tina said that she had to continue her search for David Vickers, because the last time the dog had disappeared, she had been in a very delicate condition.  Tina remarked that she was not birthing any more babies and left.\n\n\nWhen Clint demanded to know if Cord was sleeping with Tina, Cord yelled that it was none of Clint's business but then denied that he was.  Clint feared that Cord was falling for Tina again, and Cord admitted that he had never been able to \"let go\" of Tina.  While Clint appreciated that Tina had given him two grandchildren, he believed that Cord needed to wash his hands of Tina.  Cord maintained that he and Tina had a bond, much like the connection between Clint and Viki.\n\n\nCord reminded Clint that they had both had a complicated history with two very unforgettable sisters.  When Clint refused to discuss his and Viki's relationship, Cord maintained that he and Clint were dealing with the same situations, although Clint denied dealing in any situation with Viki.  Clint exclaimed that he and Viki managed along very well, but that Cord had a blind spot, when it involved Tina.\n\n\nCord thanked Clint for his advice but admitted that he did not know what would happen between Cord and Tina.  However, Cord promised that if he were faced with anything that involved Tina, he would do it with his eyes wide open.  However, Clint still insisted that Tina would blindside Cord, as Clint walked up the stairs.\n\n\nIn the library at Llanfair, Viki talked to Natalie on the phone, and Natalie stated that she thought Bo and John would find Todd.  However, Viki feared that Todd had been injured, after she had heard about the blood at the docks.  Natalie picked up the edition of the Sun with the headline, \"Scarface Kills Again\" and noticed that Jack had written it.  When Natalie worried that Viki was stressed also because of Tina, Viki indicated that she was more concerned about Natalie and her sister.\n\n\nNatalie revealed that Jessica had watched Liam, when Natalie had suddenly been called in to work.  David Vickers ran into Natalie's apartment, unnoticed.  When Viki hoped that the sisters' relationship was on the mend, Natalie joked that had to mean that Viki and Tina would work it out as well. After she got off the phone, Natalie told Liam that she had to take a shower and left the room.  David Vickers walked into the room and said to Liam, \"Afternoon, Chubby Cheeks.\"  Liam responded, \"Back at you, Fleabag.\"\n\n\nDavid Vickers introduced herself as the princess, David Vickers, and when Liam noted that she had a lot of name for a little dog, David Vickers admitted that she was really a bitch.  Liam remembered that was what his mom always called his aunt and wondered what it meant.  David Vickers announced that she had news, and that it was not good.  Liam threw out his pacifier.\n\n\nDavid Vickers revealed that Liam's parents were not who Liam thought that they were, and that Liam's father was really John McBain.  Liam remembered that John was a cop and refused to believe the dog.  Liam cried, \"Hey, you come in here with your fleas and your ticks and your groundless accusations....\"  After David Vickers stated that she had proof, Liam yelled, \"Yeah, where is it?  Don't tell me...you ate it.\"  David Vickers declared that the proof was at home, and she ran off to get it.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Tina burst in on Viki and announced that David Vickers was still missing.  Tina exclaimed that David Vickers had a huge Twitter following and asked Viki to put her dog's picture on the front page of the Banner.  When Viki refused, Tina pointed out that they were sisters, and Viki exclaimed that was only when it was convenient for Tina.  Viki declared that Tina always put herself over those that she claimed to love, and that Viki would do everything to protect her children from Tina.\n\n\nTina reminded Viki that their brothers, Todd and Victor, had constantly put all of their children in danger, but that Viki had always welcomed them back with arms wide open and had always given them a free pass.  Tina thought that she knew why.  She cried, \"Hold the presses!  Oh, I have got your headline, you see. 'Llanview Mourns the Passing of the Town Know-It-All.  City Safe for Idiots.'\"\n\n\nViki insisted that she had never called Tina an idiot, but Tina felt that Viki believed that Tina was.  Tina cried that Viki was wrong, and that Tina had not returned only for Victor's money.  Tina claimed that she was there for Viki also.  When Viki expressed surprise that Tina still needed her, Tina admitted that she had just arrived from an awkward encounter with Cord, and that they had almost kissed.\n\n\nTina explained that Clint had interrupted them and then added that she needed to strike while the iron was hot.  Tina believed that she always made the right choices when she was with Cord, and that he had brought out the best in her.  Tina hoped that if she could make it work with Cord, she could also make it work with Viki.\n\n\nTina begged Viki to tell her that it was not too late and then vowed that she would never leave their family in a lurch again.  Viki agreed that it was not fair to give their brothers second chances, but to deny a second chance to Tina.  However, Viki still refused to put David Vickers on the front page of the Banner.  Viki cheerfully announced that David Vickers was not missing, as David Vickers barked.  Tina picked up the dog and hugged and kissed her.  Tina declared, \"This day just keeps getting better and better.\"\n\n\nAt the Llanview jail, Starr prayed that her dad would be okay, when Jack handed her the edition of the Sun.  Starr noticed the headline and the author and yelled that it was a lie.  Jack exclaimed that if Starr wanted \"some bedtime story about how you're innocent until proven guilty, go read Aunt Viki's rag.\"\n\n\nWhen Starr pointed out that Tomas had already confessed to Irene's murder, Jack growled that Todd had killed Irene, and that Tomas was covering up for Todd.  Jack called Todd a coward who only cared about himself, and Starr cried that their father had taken a bullet for them.  However, Jack refused to believe Starr and insisted that she was just trying to make him feel guilty.\n\n\nStarr declared that Todd had wanted to return something to Irene, so that she would leave them in peace.  Starr added that if Todd died, it would be Jack's fault for putting their dad in jail for something that he had not done.  Starr knew that Todd was wounded and feared that he would be returned to jail.  Jack slipped and exclaimed that he knew that Todd had killed Victor, because he had heard it on Shaun's voicemail.\n\n\nStarr then realized that Jack had overheard the tape, and that he had also overheard Shaun and Starr's discussion about it.  Starr understood that Jack had known what was said that night, because he had overheard Starr and Shaun talk about it.  When Starr demanded that Jack admit that he had overheard their conversation, Jack stated that even if he admitted that he had, Starr would still have no proof of it.\n\n\nAt Viki's cottage, Blair begged Todd not to die and slapped him.  Todd yelped and asked Blair what was wrong with her.  Todd told Blair that if she let Todd die, she could finally be rid of him.  Blair laughed and reminisced about the night when they had first met.  Blair insisted that Louis Armstrong had been playing on the jukebox, but Todd claimed that it had been Nat King Cole.  As they thought back, Blair relented and agreed that it had been Nat King Cole.\n\n\nWhen Blair mentioned that she had thought that Todd was not sentimental, Todd admitted that he was not, but that he was cursed with an infallible memory.  Todd just wished that he could take an eraser and erase all of the bad stuff from his life.  Todd then speculated that if Blair erased all of the bad stuff from her life, she would have no memories of him left.  Blair expressed that it was the bad stuff that made her appreciate the good stuff.\n\n\nTodd and Blair thought back again to the first night that they had met, when they discussed who was the biggest loser of the two of them.  Todd then wondered if that had been a good memory.  Blair said that it had been good, because before that night, she had been all alone in the world, and after that night, she no longer had been.  Todd indicated that he had gotten a bad rap as the biggest loser that night, because Blair had been more pathetic, since she had drunken herself into a stupor over Max.\n\n\nTodd then reminded Blair of the stables, where they had shared their first kiss.  When Blair told Todd that he was a survivor, Todd stated, \"You don't need to tell me.  I was married to you and lived to tell the tale.\"  Blair declared that Todd was no walk in the park, and that he had not exactly swept her off of her feet.  Todd and Blair remembered when they had gotten married the first time.  Todd reflected that he had married Blair because he had believed that she was pregnant, but that Tina had revealed to him that Blair was only after his money.  Blair snarled and said, \"Tina.\"\n\n\nTodd related that the first time he had held Starr in his arms was the very first time that he had felt alive.  Todd remembered that he had wanted so much for Starr.  Todd reflected that he had declared back then, \"I want my daughter to be alive.  I want her to be healthy.  I want her to play on the swings and get a dog and go to the Junior Prom.  And I want her to graduate from college, meet some guy who's not even remotely good enough for her and be the president of the United States of America.\"  Blair believed that Starr would surpass all of Todd's dreams.\n\n\nTodd believed that he would never be able to make it up to Jack for giving him away as a baby, and Blair agreed that it had been the worst thing that Todd had ever done to her.  After they remembered Blair's discovery of Jack's kidnapping and adoption, Todd indicated that the trip down memory lane had done wonders for his soul.\n\n\nTodd wondered if Blair had told their kids bedtime stories while he was gone, and Blair said that after they had traveled to Paris, the children only liked to hear love stories.  Todd said, \"Speak for yourself.  I like a fairy tale now and then.\"  When Blair claimed that her stories did not sound authentic, Todd declared that was because Blair did not believe, but that he did.\n\n\nBlair and Todd thought back to their wedding, when he had showered her with gold -- golden balloons.  Blair looked at Todd and sadly said, \"I thought fairy tales were supposed to have happy endings,\" and as he gazed at Blair, Todd replied, \"Who says this one's over.\"  Blair and Todd leaned in to kiss. \n\n\n",
