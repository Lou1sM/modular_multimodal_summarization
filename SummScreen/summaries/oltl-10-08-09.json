    "soap_central": "\n Definitely, Baby \n\n\nAt the apartment shared by Cole and Markko, horror ensued as everyone watched the video of Langston and Markko making love, in lieu of Markko's film project for school. Screams were plentiful as Langston, Markko, Cole, and Starr did their best to stop it from playing, though Mr. and Mrs. Rivera had already seen enough. Pointing out that the pornography they had just witnessed was the worst thing they had ever seen, Markko's parents prepared to leave. They refused to listen to any explanations.\n\n\nIn order to stop them, Starr called out that Langston was pregnant and planned on giving the baby up for adoption. As a flabbergasted Langston tried to deny it and a shocked Markko stammered and asked Langston if it were true, the Riveras stopped dead in their tracks. Alarmed and shocked, they calmed down and insisted that they be given the baby to raise.\n\n\nAmelia and Nick met at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 to finalize their plans for Dorian's press conference. Nick emphasized that his involvement was not to be made known. Nearby, Oliver sat at the counter and overheard the couple mention Dorian being targeted for their higher cause. \nAfter Amelia left, Nick gave Oliver a special invitation to the press conference  . Nick pointed out that all of the \"power gays\" would be at the reception where Dorian would be taking a stand on gay rights.\n\n\nIn the park, David and Dorian prepared to host a press conference for the gay community. David's insistence that Amelia was up to something fell on deaf ears. Instead, Dorian called him homophobic. David pointed out that with all of the offenses the two of them had committed over the years, Dorian should be suspicious and be able to see the signs on Amelia.\n\n\nWhen Amelia showed up, she announced that representatives from organizations representing women's groups and other minority groups would also be present. She explained that Viki's dive in the polls was temporary, and her numbers were apparently rising once again. A perturbed Dorian couldn't believe it, in the face of the latest family tragedy at Viki's Llanfair.\n\n\nAmelia advised that Dorian was \"left of Lowell and right of Viki,\" and a lesbian for a campaign manager would not be strong enough to save her campaign. She wanted to know how far Dorian was willing to go. Amelia divulged her plan of having Dorian announce that as her first act as mayor, she would perform a wedding ceremony for Amelia and her partner. Dorian pointed out that she would be unable to disregard the law, but Amelia suggested that Dorian challenge that law. She would make national news.\n\n\nPrivately, Dorian and David argued over the move, with David proposing that it would destroy Dorian's campaign. \"No guts, no glory,\" she responded.\n\n\nAt the police station, Todd arrived looking for T\u00e9a, and advised Viki that his marriage was over. He added that it really wasn't a marriage, anyway, since T\u00e9a was already married to someone else. Viki felt certain that it was all a misunderstanding and wondered if Todd had given T\u00e9a a chance to explain. She was sure that T\u00e9a would not have broken the law, since T\u00e9a was a lawyer and was probably afraid of Todd's temper.\n\n\nTodd confessed that he had not allowed T\u00e9a to explain and was surprised that Viki wasn't shocked at his news about T\u00e9a. He was annoyed that Viki seemed to be defending T\u00e9a. Viki declared that she had known that T\u00e9a had something to talk to Todd about, and it wasn't her place to tell Todd about it. She was irritated that Todd wouldn't give T\u00e9a a chance. Todd stormed out in his pursuit of T\u00e9a.\n\n\nJared admitted that he had been lying to Natalie but John interrupted them before further discussion. John had more questions for Jared and, reluctantly, Natalie left the room. John showed Jared a list of visitors to Wayne Landers in prison after Jared was released. He wanted to know if Jared recognized any of the names. Smugly, Jared declared that he was not acquainted with anyone on the list.\n\n\nAn attorney, William Sheridan, showed up to take Jared's case. Charlie wanted to discuss what would happen if Jared were found guilty of anything, but the attorney cut the conversation short. As John accused Jared of hiding something, Sheridan entered the room and advised Jared that he was there to represent him. John left them alone and Sheridan demanded that Jared be honest with him. He wanted to know if Jared had murdered Landers.\n\n\nJared declared that people would get hurt if they knew the truth, but when Sheridan advised his client that things weren't looking good, Jared began to reconsider. John told Charlie that Jared should cooperate, since he was the only suspect the police were looking at.\n\n\nVerifying that their conversation was confidential, Jared spoke at great length to his attorney. He confirmed that no one would be able to learn what he said. Jared was taken to a cell, and informed that the police had forty-eight hours to hold him. John thought that Natalie was starting to doubt Jared and, while she denied his accusation verbally, the look on her face said otherwise.\n\n\nHalting the commotion that resulted after her surprise announcement, Starr reminded the Riveras that they had thought the video of Langston and Markko making love was the worst thing ever. They had heard something worse. She made it clear that Langston and Markko were caring and responsible people. Markko again apologized for the video and didn't want to give up on all the progress he and his parents had made towards renewing their relationship. Mrs. Rivera agreed to forgive, and accepted the circumstances they found themselves in. Mr. Rivera had no choice but to follow suit.\n\n\nTodd showed up, still in pursuit of T\u00e9a. He admitted to his daughter that he had thrown T\u00e9a out of his house, but blamed T\u00e9a for his action. Upon questioning from Starr, he confessed that he had learned of T\u00e9a's offense from Blair and had overreacted. Starr suggested that T\u00e9a was probably with Blair, attempting to straighten things out.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, the argument between T\u00e9a and Blair continued. After admitting that she had a child, T\u00e9a backed off and insisted that she was referring to Blair's children. Blair didn't buy it, and figured that a child had been the deep dark secret that T\u00e9a had referred to when they were both trapped together in the old fraternity house. T\u00e9a wanted to leave, but Blair refused to let her go until she heard the truth. Just then, T\u00e9a's phone began to ring, but Blair grabbed it from her. Blair saw that it was Todd calling and, taunting T\u00e9a, she threw the phone against the wall.\n\n\nDemanding to know the full story from T\u00e9a, Blair insisted that she would keep digging until she found out what the secret was. T\u00e9a, calling Blair a \"hateful, obsessive shrew,\" claimed that there was nothing else for Blair to learn. Blair disclosed that Ross had shown her photos of T\u00e9a's child. Raging, T\u00e9a couldn't believe that Blair had seen photos of her child. A devious Blair claimed victory, noting that she had not really seen pictures at all. Reluctantly, T\u00e9a admitted that she indeed had a child.\n\n\nShe had discovered her pregnancy after leaving the island, and Ross had done the right thing, T\u00e9a enlightened Blair. They were happy for a while but then they weren't, as Blair herself had experienced, T\u00e9a added. An angry Blair accused T\u00e9a of child abandonment while traveling all over the world. She continued to berate T\u00e9a for denying the child's existence, and called her a monster. T\u00e9a believed strongly that Blair had no room to talk, as Blair only recently left her children when traveling to Tahiti. She reminded Blair of the danger Starr had been in. Blair rejected the idea that she was the same as T\u00e9a, and declared that she had always been around for her kids.\n\n\nThinking out loud, Blair still found it odd that T\u00e9a had kept her child a secret. Going over the facts in her mind, the truth slowly dawned on her. The child was Todd's, she realized. An anguished T\u00e9a cried as Blair grasped the truth. As Blair babbled, T\u00e9a claimed it wasn't true. \"And Todd has to know it,\" Blair declared. Breathing heavily, T\u00e9a tried to stop Blair. She and Blair began to struggle and suddenly, Blair went crashing through the window.\n\n\nAs the crowd grew in anticipation of Dorian's address, both Oliver and Kyle arrived, separately. Oliver advised a doubtful Kyle that he thought Nick was planning to assassinate Dorian. Kyle was outraged that Oliver would invent something so despicable, merely to hurt Nick. Oliver advised Kyle that he had overheard the questionable conversation between Nick and Amelia, as he pointed to the pair having a confidential conversation nearby. Reminding Kyle that he was a cop, he emphasized that it was his duty to investigate.\n\n\nDorian was called to the podium and announced her support of gay Americans, and  stressed that she would fight discrimination. She introduced Amelia, her campaign manager, who in turn proclaimed that Dorian would be making an historic announcement. Members of the crowd and the press began to yell out questions and comments to Dorian. Someone called out  and wondered why this was the first time her support of gays had come up. She was accused of exploiting her campaign manager. The challenges and comments flew  fast and furious.\n\n\nAmelia asked everyone to listen. Insisting that she believed in equal rights and wanted equal rights under the law, Dorian vowed to prove it. She stated that her campaign manager was also her partner and fianc\u00e9e. Todd arrived, still looking for T\u00e9a.\n\n\nLangston gathered everyone around the television so that her kind and generous mother could be heard.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian is determined to win votes from gays and lesbians. So she entrusts Amelia and Nick to help her campaign. But Fish overhears Amelia and Nick and warns Kyle that they cannot be trusted. Blair finds out that Tea has a child. And she then tells her that she bets it's Todd's child. John and the cops are ready to send Jared to jail although Natalie, Viki and Charlie don't want to believe the charges.",
