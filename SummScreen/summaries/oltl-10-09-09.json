    "soap_central": "\nThe Defenestration of Blair Cramer\n\n\nWith David and Amelia by her side, Dorian held a press conference in the backyard of La Boulaie.  Several members of the press demanded that Dorian prove her commitment to gay rights.  Dorian shocked everyone, including David and Amelia, when Dorian announced that Amelia was her domestic partner and that they were engaged to be married.   Todd, who was searching for Blair, shook his head in disbelief.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in an upstairs bedroom, T\u00e9a panicked when Blair realized her secret.  Blair surmised that T\u00e9a had given birth to Todd's child and that T\u00e9a had managed to keep it a secret from Todd.  As Blair attempted to rush off and expose T\u00e9a's secret to Todd, T\u00e9a grabbed Blair and a struggle ensued.  To T\u00e9a's horror, Blair pulled away and fell through the bedroom window.   As Dorian made her stunning announcement downstairs, everyone gasped as Blair landed on top of a pool cover -- before their very eyes.  While Dorian and Todd ran to Blair's aid, T\u00e9a screamed hysterically upstairs.  T\u00e9a couldn't believe what had transpired before her eyes.\n\n\nWhile Dorian and Todd cared for Blair and waited for the ambulance to arrive, the press swarmed around an unconscious Blair.  While Dorian worried about Blair's condition, Todd observed a terrified T\u00e9a in the upstairs bedroom.  Once she noticed that Todd had spotted her, T\u00e9a rushed downstairs.\n\n\nAt Markko and Cole's apartment, Markko, Langston, Cole, and Starr tried to make Mr. and Mrs. Rivera comfortable.   After several unsuccessful attempts at making the Riveras' visit a pleasant one, the teens decided to ease the tension by tuning in to Dorian's televised press conference.  A look of shock crossed their faces when Dorian announced that she was a gay and moments later Blair landed on the pool cover.\n\n\nAs a frantic Starr attempted to rush off to the hospital to meet Blair, Hope began to cry in the next room.  Realizing that she couldn't take her daughter to the hospital, Starr wondered how she would learn of her mother's condition.  Instructing Starr to head for the hospital immediately, Mr. and Mrs. Rivera offered to care for Hope.\n\n\nOnce Star and Cole had left, Markko and Langston were pleased by the Rivera's concern and care for Hope.   Mrs. Rivera wondered if Langston knew of Dorian's alternative lifestyle.  Langston informed the Riveras that she had no idea about Dorian's claim of being gay.  As Langston tried to apologize to Markko's parents for the mishaps that had occurred during their visit, Mr. Rivera announced that his only concern was Blair's condition -- he lead them in a prayer for Blair's rapid recovery.\n\n\nLater, Markko and Langston enjoyed time alone with the Riveras and baby Hope.  Langston thanked them for their support.  The Riveras gave her a loving smile.  Marrko appeared pleased.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, before riding along with Blair in the ambulance, Dorian instructed David to entertain the members of the press.  Pointing out that Amelia was doing a fine job of handling the press, David warned Dorian that her plan was risky, and questioned Amelia's true motives.  Assuring David that her claim of being gay would enhance her campaign, Dorian ignored David's warning and rushed off to be by Blair's side.\n\n\nA suspicious Fish continued to observe Nick's actions.  Nick appeared elated by Dorian's stunning announcement.  Realizing that Nick had some involvement in Dorian's apparent scheme, Kyle confronted his lover.  Confessing that he shared some of the responsibility, Nick was adamant that Dorian's plan could help gay individuals claim the right to marry.  Kyle was disgusted by Nick's admission.  Later, Kyle and Fish both watched as Nick conferred with Amelia.  Although excited about the possibilities, Nick questioned if Amelia was willing to marry Dorian, a relative stranger.  Insisting that her marriage to Dorian would be a great support to their cause, Amelia exclaimed, \"How bad could Dorian Lord be?\"\n\n\nFish watched as T\u00e9a approached Todd on the lawn.  Relating that he had spotted T\u00e9a in the window, Todd accused T\u00e9a of pushing Blair through the window.  T\u00e9a insisted that it was an accident, but Todd was convinced that T\u00e9a was angry enough to cause harm to Blair.  An angry Todd announced that he was going to the hospital, and left T\u00e9a sobbing.  Fish confronted T\u00e9a and attempted to question her about her involvement in Blair's accident.  When Fish tried to detain her, T\u00e9a broke away and reminded him that he had no probable cause to arrest her.  Announcing her rights as a citizen, T\u00e9a walked away.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Matthew entered Shaun's room, where Destiny was attempting to will her brother back to consciousness.  Destiny was shocked when Matthew informed her that he had made an appointment with a surgeon, who was willing to perform his delicate surgery.  Although Destiny warned Matthew that he knew very little about the surgeon, Matthew related that the surgeon flew into town to examine him.  Matthew was adamant that he would find a doctor to operate on him no matter what.\n\n\nNearby, Rachel approached Greg, who was taking great care to perform only routine medical services.  Reminding Greg that he was a great surgeon, Rachel tried to convince Greg to practice the type of medicine that he excelled at.  Pointing out the damage that he had caused Shaun, Greg was adamant that he had no intention of performing surgery on any patient.   Rachel told Greg about Matthew's decision to find another doctor to perform his surgery.   Pleading for Greg to save her brother's life, Rachel asked Greg to reconsider his decision not to perform Matthew's surgery.  Rachel told Greg that he was risking Matthew's life by refusing to perform the surgery.\n\n\nWhile Rachel continued to plead her case to Greg, the paramedics arrived and told Greg about Blair's injuries.  Greg showed signs of nervousness when the paramedics announced that a neurosurgeon was needed to consult on Blair's case.   When Greg asked how Blair had sustained her injuries, Todd declared, \"It wasn't an accident, she was pushed!\"  Before Todd could expound on his statement, Starr and Cole rushed into the hospital.  Starr was anxious to learn of her mother's condition and how the accident had occurred.   Dorian gave Todd a stern look, and Todd simply stated that Blair's condition was unknown.\n\n\nNora told Bo that Matthew was determined to find a surgeon to perform his surgery.  Nora reminded Bo that Matthew's victory in court had awarded him the opportunity to hire a doctor of his choice. Concerned that their son would settle for an incompetent doctor, Bo suggested that they convince Greg to perform the surgery.  Nora related that she didn't want Matthew to have the surgery at all, but Bo stated, \"Better the surgery is performed by a devil that we know!\"  Matthew's parents headed to Llanview Hospital to speak with Greg.\n\n\nRachel was stunned to learn from Destiny that Matthew was being examined by a surgeon.  As Destiny explained Matthew's determination to have his surgery performed at any cost, Nora and Bo approached.  Upon learning that Nora and Bo planned to request that Greg reconsider his decision, Rachel informed them that Greg was determined not to operate on anyone.\n\n\nWhile Nora, Bo, and Rachel worried about Matthew's meeting with the unknown surgeon, Matthew approached and chastised his family members for undermining his decision.  Relating that Dr. Nance had examined him, Matthew announced that he could have his surgery performed the next day.\n\n\nAs Starr, Cole, Dorian, and Todd waited on word of Blair's condition, Starr questioned whether Todd was present during Blair's accident.  Todd stated that Blair was with T\u00e9a, but didn't divulge his suspicions to Starr.  Everyone breathed a sigh of relief when Greg announced that Blair was a lucky woman.  Although Blair had a concussion, she hadn't suffered any internal injuries.  Greg was certain that she would make a full recovery.   Dorian was angered when Greg informed Todd that Blair had asked to see him.  As Todd entered her hospital room, Blair opened her eyes.  Todd gave her a loving smile.\n\n\nT\u00e9a rushed into the waiting area of the hospital and was pleased to learn from Starr that Blair would make a full recovery.  A look of panic crossed T\u00e9a's face when Starr mentioned that Todd was with Blair.  Meanwhile, Blair looked into Todd's eyes and moaned, \"I've got something to tell you!\"\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Brody and Jessica told Roxy that Jared was in police custody.  Roxy couldn't believe that Jared would have any involvement in the stalking of Jessica and Natalie.  After Jessica and Brody explained their suspicions regarding Jared, Roxy worried about Natalie's state of mind.  Jessica consoled Roxy and promised to help Natalie deal with the situation.\n\n \n\n\n",
