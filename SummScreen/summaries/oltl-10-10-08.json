    "soap_central": "\nFrom Soup To Nuts\n\n\nAt the hospital, the doctor explained to Adriana and Roxy that Rex didn't appear to have the will to fight. Adriana argued that the medication that Rex had been prescribed was preventing him from waking up. Fed up with Adriana's denial, Roxy lashed out at her daughter-in-law and blamed her for Rex's condition. Roxy told Adriana that Rex would pull through if Adriana would allow him to see Gigi and Shane. As Adriana and Roxy argued, Layla tried to calm the women. \n\n\nFrustrated, the doctor told Adriana that Rex's vital signs were seemingly perfect -- and that he should have regained consciousness. He further explained that it was necessary to get Rex to breathe on his own and that they intended to wean him off the ventilator. Afterward, if Rex didn't respond, the doctor informed Adriana and Roxy that they would need to consider placing him in a long-term care facility. A devastated Adriana gave her permission to take Rex off the ventilator. In a sarcastic tone, Roxy stated that she needed to contact Bo and Gigi and advise them off the situation. \n\n\nAfter the doctor made preparations to take Rex off of the ventilator, Adriana advised Roxy that Gigi would never step foot inside Rex's room. Roxy couldn't believe that Adriana would risk Rex's life because of her jealousy. Adriana insisted that she and Rex were happy before Gigi arrived in Llanview. She promised to have Gigi arrested if she ever tried to see Rex. After suggesting that Layla talk some sense into Adriana, Roxy placed a call to Bo. \n\n\nGigi paid Bo a visit at the police station. She pleaded with him to find a way to allow her to see Rex. With regret, Bo told Gigi that he couldn't interfere as long as Adriana refused Gigi access to Rex. He promised to try to convince Adriana to reverse her decision, but wasn't hopeful. Bo suggested that they hold onto hope that Rex would wake up. He reminded Gigi that if Rex regained consciousness and asked for her, Adriana would have to comply. \n\n\nConvinced that Adriana wasn't acting in Rex's best interest, Gigi insisted that Rex needed to hear her voice. Gigi argued that Adriana was trying to hold onto Rex. Noting that Adriana and Rex were in love before Rex reunited with Gigi, Bo appeared to have some compassion for Adriana. Refusing to feel sorry for her nemesis, Gigi reminded Bo that Adriana caused the chain of events that led to Rex' shooting by bringing Brody to Llanview. Upon mention of Brody, Bo informed Gigi that Brody had assaulted an officer and would be transferred to the VA hospital for a psychological evaluation due to his erratic behavior. As Bo comforted her, Gigi struggled to understand how her life had taken such a disastrous turn. \n\n\nBo received a call from Roxy. She requested that Bo come to the hospital immediately so that he could be present when the doctors removed the ventilator. When Bo stated that Gigi was with him, Roxy regretfully informed him that Adriana had threatened to have Gigi removed if she came to the hospital. Bo gave Gigi the news of Rex's condition and Adriana's threat against her. Stating that she needed to be present, Gigi couldn't believe that Adriana would risk Rex's health. Before heading to the hospital, Bo promised to give Gigi an update on Rex and asked her to remain at the station until he returned. Gigi asked Bo to tell Rex that she loved him. \n\n\nWaiting for Bo to return with news concerning Rex, a frustrated Gigi wandered around the station. As she poured herself a cup of water, she dropped the cup when she witnessed a shackled Brody being escorted by military officers. Screaming at Brody, Gigi demanded to know why he shot Rex. A delusional Brody stated that he was only following orders and apologized for his actions. A military officer informed Gigi that Brody was in a highly volatile state and she was only making matters worse. Feeling some compassion for Brody, Gigi asked the officers to take care of him. As he was escorted out of the station, Brody mumbled that he had carried out his mission. \n\n\nReminiscing about the happy times that she shared with Rex and Shane, Gigi wept. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Adriana asked to be present as Rex underwent the procedure to allow him to breathe on his own. She was allowed admittance, but was warned to remain out of the way. Seconds later, Bo arrived and Roxy thanked him for coming. When Roxy stated that Gigi should also be present, Layla defended her friend by claiming that Adriana cared for Rex. Roxy was certain that Adriana only cared about herself, and suggested that Gigi would have reacted differently had she been in Adriana's position. \n\n\nInside Rex's hospital room, Adriana watched as the doctors removed the ventilator. Rex immediately took a turn for the worse. The doctors explained that Rex wasn't breathing on his own and ordered Adriana to leave the room. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Adriana gave Roxy, Bo, and Layla the grim news about Rex. Upon learning that Rex had been placed back on the ventilator, Roxy broke down. Referring to Adriana as a \"selfish bitch,\" Roxy demanded that Adriana allow Rex to see the woman that he loved. A pained Adriana pleaded with Roxy to understand her side. Citing that she didn't want to take the chance that Rex would suffer a setback if he saw Gigi, Adriana was certain that Rex would recover with the aid of the doctors. Screaming, Roxy forced Adriana to look inside Rex's room. She told Adriana to look at what she had done to Rex. As Bo led Roxy away, Layla tried to comfort Adriana. \n\n\nDoubting her decision, Adriana asked Layla her opinion. Layla told her friend that she knew Adriana loved Rex and believed that she was doing the right thing. Adriana wondered if Roxy was right about her being a bitter woman. Unwilling to hurt her friend, Layla stated that no one could judge Adriana's decision. Expressing her fears to Layla, Adriana wondered if she and Rex were never meant to be together. \n\n\nThe doctor explained to everyone that Rex was in serious trouble. In order to recover, it was necessary that Rex regain consciousness. The doctor was concerned that Rex was still unconscious. He advised the family that they needed to figure out what was preventing Rex from waking up. The doctor said that Rex could still possibly wake up, but there was also a chance that if he did - he might not be the same person. Bo called Gigi and gave her the devastating news. \n\n\nOutside of Rodi's, Jared demanded that Leo, the carpenter, give him information on the room Tess had paid him to build for her. Warning Jared that Tess was a nutcase, Leo advised him to keep his distance from her. Admitting that he had built a soundproof room with glass walls in the basement of Llanfair, Leo denied having any knowledge of Tess's intentions. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tess arrived in time to find Tina, armed with a sledgehammer, preparing to rescue Natalie from her prison. Meanwhile, in the secret room, Natalie watched from her television monitor as Tina and Tess struggled over control of the sledgehammer. As Tina appeared to get the upper hand, Natalie feared for the safety of Tess's unborn child. \n\n\nWhen Tina let go of the sledgehammer, Tess nearly fell down. After tossing the sledgehammer out the back door, an angered Tess instructed Tina to never enter the basement again. Refusing to take orders from Tess, Tina reminded Tess that she would have to release Natalie eventually. Threatening to report her to the authorities, Tess warned Tina to never cross her again. Tess reminded her aunt that Carlo would kill Sarah and that Tina's life would become a living hell if she didn't keep quiet regarding Natalie's whereabouts. Disgusted with Tina, Tess stormed off to the safe with Tina following close behind. \n\n\nIn the library, Tess fumbled with the combination to the safe as Tina watched in horror. Stating that she was no longer concerned about the jewels, Tina suggested that Tess reveal her secret so that Tina could finally tell everyone that Tess had resurfaced and locked Natalie in the basement. Unmoved by Tina's threat, Tess was certain that no one would ever believe her loony aunt. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Jared stood outside of Llanfair and placed a call to Bo. Upon reaching his voicemail, Jared left a message informing Bo that he needed to update him on Natalie's disappearance. \n\n\nWhile Tess and Tina argued at the safe, they were both surprised when Jared entered the room and questioned what was taking place. From her room in the basement, Natalie begged Tina to tell Jared the truth. \n\n\nAs Tina tried to explain her side of the story, Jared lashed out at her and accused Tina of upsetting \"Jessica.\" Insisting that Jessica's life was in turmoil, Jared chastised Tina for making the situation more difficult by causing trouble for her. While Jared berated Tina, Tess snickered behind his back. When Tina tried to reason with Jared and wondered how he could forget about Natalie, Jared exclaimed that he was over Natalie. Tess consoled Jared and offered to prepare a meal for him. In order to get a moment alone with Jared, Tina tried to get rid of Tess, but she refused to leave Tina and Jared alone. Appearing to be disgusted by Natalie's betrayal, Jared offered to pour the drinks while Tess prepared a snack. Convinced that she had turned Jared against Natalie, Tess agreed to abide by Jared's wishes. Before heading to the kitchen, Tess discreetly warned Tina to keep quiet. \n\n\nAs Tess prepared a dip, she relished her accomplishments. Stating that she had Jared exactly where she wanted him, Tess removed a vial containing a powdered substance from her blouse. Tess sprinkled the substance in the dish she had prepared. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the library, Jared told Tina that he believed Jess was actually Tess and feared that she had done something awful to Natalie. Jared pleaded with Tina to help him find Natalie. With a renewed sense of hope, Natalie listened from the secret room. As Jared told Tina about his conversation with Leo, Tina blurted out that she was aware that Tess had resurfaced. Natalie begged Tina to tell Jared where she was being held captive. \n\n\nJared demanded that Tina tell him everything that she knew. Refusing to give Jared details, Tina claimed that she had only recently figured out that Tess was back. Upon learning that Jared knew about the secret room, Tina told Jared to meet her in the kitchen in five minutes. As they discussed searching for Natalie, Tess called out to Jared. Warning Jared that Tess was insane, Tina advised him to make up an excuse in order to make a break for the kitchen. Before he could get away, Tess appeared with her laced meal and questioned why Jared hadn't prepared their drinks. Claiming that he wanted to take a shower first, Jared excused himself. Alone with Tina, Tess demanded to know what had transpired between Tina and Jared during her absence. \n\n\nSuspicious of Tina's behavior, Tess wondered if she had told Jared about Natalie. Denying spilling the beans, Tina warned Tess that the truth would eventually come out. Tina told Tess that she needed to feed David Vickers. After issuing Tina one last warning, Tess dismissed her. Meanwhile, Natalie watched from the monitor as Jared tried to gain entrance to the locked basement. Desperate to be rescued, Natalie tried to kick the glass, but injured herself instead. \n\n\nJared tried to kick open the locked door, but Tina came to his aid. She picked the lock and gave Jared detailed information regarding Natalie's location. Jared told Tina to guard the basement door. Armed with a knife, Tina vowed to keep Tess away. Downstairs, Natalie prayed that Jared would find her before Tess figured out what was going on. As she stood guard, Tina asked God to help her fight off Tess. Looking up at the sky, Tina told God that she only wanted to protect Sarah and help Natalie. When she stated that she no longer cared about the Mendorran jewels, a familiar voice chimed in, \"But they matter to me!\" As Tina turned around, she saw Cain in possession of the sledgehammer that Tess had discarded. \n\n\nTess wondered what was keeping Jared and Tina. When she called upstairs to Jared and received no answer, Tess headed to the kitchen to check on Tina. Upon hearing the front door open, Tess turned to see who was there. A look of horror crossed her face, and she exclaimed, \"What are you doing here?\" \n\n\nIn the basement, Jared slid back the wall that concealed the secret room. A stunned Jared stared in disbelief when he discovered Natalie inside the glass room. A relieved Natalie smiled at him.\n\n\n",
