    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Viki's cottage, as Blair and Todd leaned in to kiss, T\u00e9a burst through the doors.  Blair explained that she had been trying to keep Todd talking, and that Todd had seemed completely out of his mind.  Blair then asked T\u00e9a if she had gotten the antibiotics.  When Todd joked that if they had one more, there would be enough for bridge, Blair pointed out that he was obviously out of his mind.\n\n\nT\u00e9a stressed that they needed to figure a way out of the mess that Todd had gotten them all into.  T\u00e9a then pulled out the antibiotics, and Blair gave one to Todd.  T\u00e9a informed Blair that Starr was fine, but that she was worried out of her mind over her father.  T\u00e9a also announced that Tomas was in jail and could not get out on bail.  When Blair wanted to know why not, T\u00e9a said that the courts normally would not release a man who had pleaded guilty to a murder charge on bail.\n\n\nBlair blamed herself, because she had asked Tomas to help Todd.  She then yelled at Todd, who only thought that Blair was cute when she was angry with him.  T\u00e9a believed that the mayor was keeping Starr in jail to try to flush Todd out.  Blair then screamed at Todd, because it was his fault that Starr was freezing in a jail cell.  When Blair started to leave to rescue Starr, T\u00e9a pleaded with Blair not to give Todd up, which would ruin her case.  As she left, Blair stated that if she did give Todd up, they would all be in jail.\n\n\nT\u00e9a asked Todd if Blair had really removed the bullet, and Todd revealed that she had removed it with Viki's melon ballers.  Todd asked T\u00e9a to fix the mess, but she was not sure that she could \"make it go away.\"  When Todd joked that he would turn himself in, T\u00e9a believed that it was not such a bad idea, because that would be the only chance to have the charges dropped against Starr and Tomas.  Todd stated that his one condition to turn himself in was if T\u00e9a could convince him that she believed him.\n\n\nTodd reminded T\u00e9a that the gun was at the bottom of the river, and that Jack would continue to lie.  T\u00e9a relented and said that she believed Todd, and that they needed to find out who had kill Victor, since Todd had not.  Todd laughed and commented that he would need a magnifying glass, a pipe, and a badge, so that he could play detective.  T\u00e9a handed Todd a glass of water.\n\n\nTodd noted that everyone kept trying to give him water and wondered if that was a requirement in some handbook entitled My Mother Shot Me for Dummies.  T\u00e9a said that she was sorry about Todd's mother -- not that Irene was dead, but that she had been Todd's mother.  Todd thanked T\u00e9a.  When T\u00e9a speculated who else could have killed Victor, Todd noted that they would need lots and lots of paper to make a really, really long list of people who had hated T\u00e9a's husband, and that T\u00e9a would be at the top of the list.\n\n\nUpset, T\u00e9a commented to Todd, \"Okay, if I'm supposed to give you a free pass, because your mother is a bitch, you do not get to badmouth my dead husband.  I loved him, okay?\"  Todd agreed that he should not have said that and pointed out that nobody liked Todd either.  T\u00e9a then remembered the last time that she had been at the cottage with Victor, and that was when Victor had gotten angry.  T\u00e9a claimed that she had always hated that side of him.  T\u00e9a then realized that Victor's over-the-top reaction to anything that threatened his kids had actually been Todd.\n\n\nT\u00e9a voiced that Irene had programmed that behavior into Victor.  T\u00e9a remembered that Victor had gotten angry over both of his daughters' sexuality and would have killed Cole and Nate if he had gotten the chance.  T\u00e9a also realized that Victor had turned Jack into a bully.  She believed that Victor had been so possessive and had gone to such extremes, because he had been afraid that the truth would be revealed.\n\n\nTodd remarked that he had heard that Jack had caused Gigi Morasco's death, and T\u00e9a explained what had happened the night that Gigi had been trapped in the basement.  T\u00e9a expressed that Victor had paid another kid's father to have his son take the rap for Jack.  As T\u00e9a sympathized over that poor family, she thought she knew who had killed Victor.  T\u00e9a remembered that there was someone else who had wanted Victor dead as much as Todd had -- Rex Balsom.\n\n\nIn the Llanview jail, when Starr demanded that Jack admit that he had lied to get Todd arrested, Jack said, \"So what if I did?  It's not like you can prove it.\"  When Starr claimed that Jack had just confessed, Jack denied it and maintained that Scarface had killed his dad.  Starr declared that she wanted Jack to tell the cops immediately that Todd was innocent.\n\n\nWhen Jack declared that he was leaving for his dad's office, Starr stopped him and said that she would tell the cops if Jack did not.  When Starr demanded to speak to the police commissioner, the cops refused to let her.  Starr informed Tomas, who was in another jail cell, that Jack had lied about seeing Todd kill Victor, but Jack still denied it.  Jack only wondered why Tomas had taken the rap of Irene's death for Todd.\n\n\nAfter Jack left, Starr asked Tomas about T\u00e9a, and he informed her that T\u00e9a had needed to be somewhere else after the arraignment.  Confused, Starr asked why Tomas had been arraigned, as Blair ran in and hugged Starr through the bars and informed her that Hope was all right.  Blair told Starr that Tomas was in jail because he had pleaded to the murder of Irene.\n\n\nBlair let Starr know that Todd was fine, and that Dorian had helped Blair remove Todd's bullet.  Starr claimed that Jack had lied, and that he had actually overheard Shaun telling Starr about Victor's last words on voicemail.  Starr proclaimed that Jack had admitted it and was proud of it.  Starr feared that her dad would never get to return home if Jack did not come clean.\n\n\nStarr begged Blair to try to get Jack to admit the truth, because she did not want Jack to go through life knowing that he had put his own father in jail.  Blair agreed that she would try, and she handed her wrap to Starr to help her stay warm, and Blair kissed her daughter.  Blair then sincerely apologized to Tomas for being in jail for a murder that he had not committed.  Tomas stated that it had not been Blair's fault and then joked that they would always have Paris.\n\n\nBlair pleaded with Tomas to change his plans, and to save himself for her.  Tomas asked Blair to find Jack, so that she could get him to admit the truth to save them all.  Once Blair left, Starr asked if Tomas would change his plea, because she believed that Tomas could help clear Todd.  Starr sadly noted that Jack had his real father, who could be put away for a long time due to Jack's lie.\n\n\nAt the cemetery, Rex held Gigi's message, \"Don't give up,\" and asked at her grave what it meant.  Madame Delfina yelled out hello at Rex and showed him a book.  Delfina related that she was at the site for a book club, because dead people liked to read, since they had a lot of time on their hands.  However, Delfina was not thrilled about the book list:  Death in Venice that week, Death on the Nile the previous week, and Death of a Salesman the week before that.\n\n\nWhen Delfina noticed that Rex looked depressed, she asked if she could help, and Rex showed her the note.  Delfina reached her arms out to the spiritual world and tried to page Gigi, but Gigi would not respond.  Delfina tried to reach her again and asked for a sign, and they both heard a loud bang.  The picture of Stacy and Kim was shown to be knocked off of the table by the bed of Kim's friend in the Kentucky hospital.  When Rex wondered if Gigi had answered, Delfina was not sure.\n\n\nWhen Delfina tried to reach Gigi one more time, she announced that she could not feel her.  Rex begged Delfina to send him back in time, so that he could stop Jack from killing Gigi.  Rex exclaimed that he was \"going crazy\" and pleaded with Delfina to make it happen.  However, Delfina reminded Rex that the porthole only opened up every 20 years, and that she could send him back in the year 2028.\n\n\nMadame Delfina claimed that she had to leave for the book club, and Rex felt that no one understood.  Rex sadly told Gigi's grave that he and Gigi had once had it all.  Rex told Gigi that he had never stopped loving her, and then he reflected back on some of their happier times together.  Rex sadly announced that he had \"to let [her] go.\"\n\n\nJack arrived at the cemetery to visit Victor's grave and apologized to his dad for messing up.  Jack insisted that Todd still had shot Victor though.  Delfina discovered Jack and insisted that Jack felt guilty.  Delfina claimed that Jack could vent his conscience at the cemetery, because dead men told no tales.  After Delfina walked off, Jack shouted that no one would make him change his story, just as Blair arrived and said, \"Jack.\"\n\n\nDelfina walked back up to Gigi's grave and asked Gigi for the story.  Delfina reminded Gigi that she could only join the book club through Delfina, and that they were not ready for Death Be Not Proud until the following week.  When Delfina still received no response from Gigi, she stormed off.\n\n\nIn Kentucky, Kim looked over her friend's hospital bills and noted that it was time for the two ditzy broads in Llanview to ante up.  When Kim realized that her phone call to Echo was being ignored, she declared that Echo would regret it.  Kim believed that Echo and Roxy were stalling, and that she would have to do something about it.  Kim kissed her friend's hand and left the room.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Roxy ran in and found Echo reading the front page of the Sun.  Roxy insisted that Rex had to give everything back to Clint, so that Rex would not get arrested.  Echo then noticed that Kim was calling and announced to Roxy that she would tell Kim nothing.  After Echo did not take the call, she announced that the cops already had their man, and that it was not Rex.  Echo showed Roxy the headline, \"Scarface Kills Again?\" with Todd's picture under it.\n\n\nEcho laughed and said, \"His own kid ratted him out, and then he escaped at gunpoint, felony number two.  Then he goes and kills his mother.  This guy's a three-time loser.  The cops aren't going to be looking at Rex for this.  Not when they have Todd Manning in their sights.\"  However, Roxy believed that they still had a lot to worry about.\n\n\nRoxy stated that John McBain did not think that Todd was guilty.  Roxy also noted that the cops would not need an excuse \"to go after Rex,\" because they knew he had hated Victor.  Roxy feared that once John had Rex's gun, all would be toast.  Roxy insisted that they had to get the gun back, before it was too late, when Kim barged in.\n\n\nKim asked if Rex had agreed to give everything back to Clint, and Roxy stalled and said that she needed more time.  Roxy insisted that Rex was on board, but that they just needed to \"scrunch\" those numbers a little bit.  Echo interrupted Roxy and handed Kim the forged document.  Echo announced that the paper transferred all assets back to Clint.  Echo claimed that all of the money and Buchanan Enterprises did not mean anything to Rex, and that he had just been sticking it to his daddy.\n\n\nWhen Kim questioned if the paper was for real, Echo pointed out that Kim was getting what she had wanted.  Echo then demanded the return of the gun.  As Kim handed the gun to her, she demanded that Rex start packing.  After Kim left the house, Echo revealed to Roxy that she had signed the document for Rex.  Roxy worried about Echo's forgery, but Echo claimed that she had gotten quite good at it.\n\n\nRoxy pointed out that Rex would know that he had not signed the paper, and that he would tell Kim.  However, Echo explained that once Kim finally knew the truth, the gun would be long gone.  Echo insisted that Rex would never know, just as Rex walked in.  Rex asked, \"Know what?\"\n\n\nBack in Kentucky, Kim ran into her friend's hospital room and screamed that Rex had finally returned everything to Clint.  Kim squealed that she would be able to get the money to pay for her friend's hospital bills, and that Stacy would be taken care of forever.  However, Kim insisted that Stacy would have better doctors to help her snap out of it.  Kim then noticed the broken picture of Stacy and Kim on the floor.\n\n\nKim inquired, \"Remember this photo, Stace?  You and me...way back when.  We look so different now, don't we?\"  Stacy lay in the hospital bed, looking remarkably like her sister, Gigi. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr figures out that Jack knew the perfect lie to tell the cops when he overheard the tape that Shaun played for her. She remains in jail with Tomas in the adjoining cell after he's taken the wrap for killing Irene so Todd doesn't have to. Meanwhile, Blair and Tea both somewhat reluctantly hide and take care of Todd, realizing that two people are in jail because of him and they could both be accessories to murder for their part in hiding him. But they realize that Jack is the reason for all of this. Had he not lied about Todd killing Victor, none of this would happen. Tea also reflects to Todd what he's already learned about Jack bullying Rex and Gigi's son, luring Shane to come to the house to get locked in the basement and Gigi going in his place to die from carbon monoxide poisoning while victor enabled Jack to get away with it. Rex keeps seeing and hearing Gigi and calls upon Delphina to help him. Meanwhile it appears that Kim has a secret regarding Gigi. Jack overhears Delphina telling him that the no good father and son responsible for killing Gigi will come clean. Jack overhears and is stunned. While alone with Todd, Tea concludes that she knows of one person who would have even more motive to kill Victor than he did. And that would be Rex Balsam.",
