He suggests she go home and get some sleep while he works but she doesn't trust him; she thinks he wants to screw her over. He knows everything about her, she learns, while she knows nothing about him, she retorts, except for the fact that he's obnoxious and an arrogant jerk. She decides that they'd better call a truce though since they have to work together. No more talk about the Buchanans or his fake resume, they must work for the good of the company and show each other respect. It's his turn to distrust her but suddenly he pulls her into a passionate kiss. She's furious and fires him! He reminds her of their contract, which she is breaking. He's lucky she's not pressing charges, she snarls, for sexual misconduct. He claims it's a joke and tries to apologize but Nat refuses to accept it. Jared has no choice but to bring up the fact that he can still call the ACPD on Jess but Nat isn't buying it. He'll keep holding that over her head and demanding more, she rationalizes. \n\n\nMichael finally reaches Marcie via cell phone and tells her to come home with Tommy. She's not coming home, she tells him. There's no us anymore after what he did to her. Michael insists that they still love each other and what he did was out of love. Marcie says she'll call back and hangs up. Todd demands that the FBI be called in but an annoyed Bo says they will have to wait to see if she returns. Todd is highly doubtful and wants a better plan. John is honest with Michael and acknowledges that he doesn't know if Marcie can avoid jail; it's in her own hands. She calls back a short time later with her decision but before she can say anything, Todd grabs the phone from Michael and yells and screams and curses her out, threatening her if she doesn't return with Tommy. She will never bring him back, she yells back. Bo attempts to calm down a crazed Todd but Manning goes off, vowing to find Marcie himself. Bo asks for a list of contacts and advises John not to pursue this case himself. She will be in more trouble if she crosses state lines, Michael hears. He doesn't think that his wife will ever get over this. He has nothing now. Marcie talks to Tommy, telling him she has to do what's best.  After driving for some time, she is happy to see that they've arrived in New Jersey. She eventually stops the car at a house and rings the doorbell, asking an unseen someone for help.\n\n\nClint and Nora wonder where Dorian is since she cancelled a date. Clint admits that he likes her a lot and that they've both changed. Nora admits that she always saw him back with Viki; Clint sees Nora with Bo. \"Touch\u00e9,\" she smiles. As Nora decides to make a decision about whether she and Matthew will continue to live there, her son enters the room and demands a say in the matter. He reminds her that they loved their old house because of the people in it and the memories they had. If they move into a new house, that will be starting over. They already have memories at Asa's house, a wise little boy says, and he would prefer to stay there. Just then, Renee walks through the room and hearing what Matthew has to say, supports his decision. The house would be empty without them, she says. Nora accepts the offer to remain at Asa's and Renee and Clint happily decide to throw a housewarming party. Renee especially wants to invite the nice young man, Jared, who reminds her of a young Asa. Clint wonders if she's trying to be a matchmaker. After she turns in, Nigel, who had been accompanying Matthew, speaks up. He has trouble putting his feelings for Jared into words and Clint helps out. \"A bootlicking kiss-up?\" Nigel agrees and both men emphatically deny that there's a resemblance between Jared and Asa. It's best if they keep an eye on him, it's decided. Bo arrives and fills everyone in on the custody hearing. When Nora hears that Marcie has run with Tommy, she excuses herself to get to work. Bo pulls Matthew into a big hug.\n\n\nStarr and Blair hear the truth about Langston's parents. Starr grabs her friend's hand as she talks, hesitatingly, about how she couldn't bear to tell anyone the truth, especially if it meant she would end up in foster care. When she gets up to go home, Dorian won't hear of it. Langston will stay with them, she tells a weakly smiling young woman, as she cries at the same time. Langston admits that she felt bad about lying to Starr and Marco but didn't know what would happen. Starr assures her friend that everything will be all right. They head up to bed and Starr suggests that Langston spend the night in her room. She just holds and comforts her devastated friend. Downstairs, Dorian wonders if she should call the authorities but her thoughts are put on hold when Todd walks in. He informs them that Marcie has kidnapped Tommy. \n\n\n",

Langston lets Blair and Starr know that she had been lying to them that her parents were dead and had been dead for a year and a half.

Todd insists that the FBI be called. Bo is reluctant to call them until he knows for sure that Marcie is not coming home with Tommy. Clint urges Nora to continue to live at Asa's mansion. Nora has second thoughts until Matthew walks in and tells her to consider him and what he wants. After talking to Matthew for a while, Nora agrees to continue to live at Asa's mansion. Renee suggests that they have a party to honor Nora and Matthew continuing to live there. All agree. Renee even suggests inviting Natalie and Jared Banks. At Buchanan Enterprises, Jared explains to Natalie about his life before Jessica framed him and he went to prison. Natalie offers her sympathies and suggests a truce. Jared agrees and they shake on it. Jared grabs Natalie and kisses her. Natalie pulls away and tells him that he is fired. She tells him that the kiss could be considered sexual harassment.
