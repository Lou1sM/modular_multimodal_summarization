    "soap_central": "\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a tried to figure who else would have wanted Victor dead. T\u00e9a suggested Rex, but Todd didn't think Rex was capable of killing anyone. As T\u00e9a talked about the situation with Gigi, Todd suddenly had a pang of pain, and begged for painkillers. T\u00e9a found some ibuprofen, and gave him another antibiotic as well. Continuing the conversation, she expressed her belief that, after Gigi had died, Rex was capable of murder.\n\n\nTodd attempted to throw the blanket off and get up, but T\u00e9a stopped him. He told her that he needed to get to Jack, because Rex would go after Jack as well if he believed that Jack had something to do with Gigi's death. T\u00e9a insisted that Rex wouldn't try to hurt Jack, because Shane was Jack's age. She added that Rex would have already gone after Jack if he were going to at all. Todd was still uneasy, so T\u00e9a promised to deal with it, as long as Todd stayed calm.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Cutter ate as Aubrey said that she still had four more hours of bartending. She walked away, and found Bo at the bar, reading the paper. Bo asked for Blair, but Aubrey revealed that Blair wasn't there. Aubrey apologized to Bo about what she had done to Joey, and promised that she was trying to live a better life. Bo was glad, and told Aubrey to ask Blair to call him.\n\n\nAubrey wondered if Bo needed any help otherwise, and Bo jokingly asked her where Todd was. Aubrey replied that she'd never even met Todd, and asked if he'd actually murdered two people. Bo only disclosed that Todd was a \"person of interest,\" because of lack of hard evidence. Aubrey remembered Cutter's promise of turning the gun in, and asked Bo if it was true that someone had turned a gun in to police. Bo told her that the police hadn't received any guns. Aubrey looked over at Cutter, who smiled and waved. Just then, Bo's phone rang, and he excused himself.\n\n\nAubrey walked over to Cutter with a glass of beer, and poured it on him. She demanded to know what Cutter had done with the gun, because Bo had just told her that no gun had been turned in to police. He swore that he'd turned the gun in, but Aubrey suspected him of \"stashing it for a rainy day.\" He promised that he'd turned it in, but Aubrey didn't believe him. She told him that their relationship was over, and that she never wanted to see him again. She wanted an honest and real relationship, so she told him to leave. He finally obliged, and she watched him walk out.\n\n\nBo answered his phone to T\u00e9a, who demanded that Bo find her husband's killer. She wondered if there were any more suspects, but Bo revealed that there weren't. T\u00e9a mentioned Rex as a possible suspect, but Bo insisted that there was no evidence pointing to Rex. She reminded him that no murder weapon had been found, but Bo said that he didn't think Rex carried a gun. She countered that Rex lived in the Buchanan mansion, which was probably full of guns. \"I know how much you Buchanan boys love your guns,\" she told him.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wanted surveillance on Rex, because she wanted all \"credible leads\" followed. She threatened to mention the close relationship of Bo and Rex in court if Bo continued to drag his feet. Bo wondered if she'd heard from Todd, but she cited the confidentiality laws. She hoped that Bo would be questioning Rex, and Bo hung up. Bo told himself that Rex had an alibi for the time of the murder. Aubrey appeared in front of Bo, clearly upset. She told the commissioner that she had information for him about the murder.\n\n\nTodd commended T\u00e9a on the way that she had handled Bo. She related that, even though she'd thought that Victor had been Todd, she'd loved him very much, and vowed not to rest until the real killer was behind bars. T\u00e9a didn't think Bo would tail Rex, but believed that Rex would be questioned. Todd told T\u00e9a to call Blair, and tell Blair to watch over Jack. She told him to only concentrate on getting better. If Rex were guilty, T\u00e9a promised to make him pay for the crime.\n\n\nRex arrived home, and found Roxy and Echo with their heads together. Rex wearily asked them to tell him what they were up to, as Echo hid the gun behind her back. They claimed to just be \"hanging out,\" but Rex didn't believe them. \"Living room, now,\" he said, and Roxy followed. Echo hid the gun in a large plant, and quickly followed the others into the living room.\n\n\nShane walked down the stairs, and found the gun in the plant. Shane took the gun out of the plastic bag it was in, and had a flashback. He remembered hitting Jack over the head with the gun, and pointing the gun at Jack's unconscious body. As Shane looked at the gun, he heard a gunshot in his head, and jumped. Moments later, Shane was gone with the gun.\n\n\nRex admitted to his mothers that he'd been at the cemetery, so he wasn't in the mood for their games. \"He knows,\" Roxy said. \"Roxy always cracks first,\" Rex observed. Covering, Echo told him that she and Roxy \"know\" that he killed Victor. Rex was dumbfounded, but Echo told him that they understood why he'd killed Victor. Rex swore that he'd never fired the gun, but Echo informed him that she'd checked the gun, and one bullet had been missing. \"Not by me!\" Rex exclaimed, as the women looked at him skeptically.\n\n\nRoxy promised that she and Echo would never \"rat\" Rex out. \"That's great, but there's nothing to rat out,\" he replied. He continued that it was nice of Roxy and Echo to want to cover up his crimes, but he hadn't done anything that merited a cover-up. Echo said she'd show him the gun, and led him to the plant in the foyer. She saw the bag, and nervously disclosed that the gun was gone.\n\n\nBlair found Jack at Victor's grave. She told him that she'd heard he'd had \"things to say\" about Todd. Jack called Starr crazy, but Blair said that Starr only hated injustice. Jack realized that Blair had never believed his story. Blair admitted it, but told him that she believed in him. She begged him not to \"shut down on me again\" like he had when Gigi had died.\n\n\nJack defiantly told his mother that Victor deserved justice. Blair agreed, but suggested that the wrong person was going to pay for the crime. She informed him that he could be helping the real killer get away with murder. Jack yelled that Victor had been Jack's father for eight years, but Blair reminded Jack that she'd been there for the previous eight years as well. She could tell that something had been bothering Jack, and begged him to talk to her.\n\n\nWhen Jack was silent, Blair told him that she'd always love him no matter what, and walked away. Talking to Victor's grave, Jack wondered who could have killed Victor if Todd hadn't. Just then, Shane appeared behind Jack, holding the gun.\n\n\nKim excitedly told Stacy about Rex finally giving everything back to Clint, and promised that Stacy would be \"taken care of forever.\" She saw the broken picture on the floor, and wondered what had happened to it. She marveled over how different she and Stacy looked compared to the picture, and looked down at the bed at Stacy, who looked exactly like Gigi.\n\n\nKim assured Stacy that she'd kept Rex from going to jail, only because she knew that Stacy cared about Rex. As she put lip gloss on Stacy's lips, she expressed how shocking it still was to see Stacy's new look. Kim recalled the first time she'd seen Stacy. She'd been dancing at the Spotted Pony when she'd caught a glimpse of who she'd thought was Gigi. She remembered Stacy wearing the boots that Kim had left for her at the lake that Stacy had presumably drowned in. Kim had scolded who she'd thought was Gigi, but the woman had insisted that she was Stacy.\n\n\nKim had told the woman to leave, but Stacy had talked about things that she had shared with Kim in the past. Kim had tearfully asked if the woman was actually Stacy, who related that she'd been searching for Kim for months. A customer had told Kim to dance for him unless she wanted him to get the manager of the place, but Stacy had offered her services. At that moment, Kim had known that the woman was actually Stacy. Kim had exclaimed that it was a miracle, but had wondered why Stacy looked like Gigi. \"How else am I going to take her life?\" Stacy had replied.\n\n\nKim had asked Stacy why she hadn't returned to Llanview. Stacy had replied that Kyle and Fish probably wouldn't have let her near Sierra, and that Rex and Gigi had been \"playing house\" like Stacy had never existed. Kim had marveled over Stacy's plastic surgery. Stacy raved about her South America-based surgeon, and related that she'd even seen Erica Kane in the office.\n\n\nKim recalled telling Stacy that she was better than Gigi. \"Except in the way that matters,\" Stacy had replied. Stacy had thought that if she looked like Gigi, Rex would love her, and she would be allowed to see her daughter. Kim had been skeptical, but Stacy had insisted that she was going to replace Gigi. Kim wished that she'd had time to talk Stacy out of her plan, because Stacy had ended up in the hospital. Kim wanted to get Rex's signed papers to Clint, but Cutter appeared in the doorway. \"You're not going anywhere,\" Cutter spat.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Kim reveals that Stacy is unconscious in the hospital bed after getting plastic surgery to look like Gigi. She is confident that her best friend will be getting better soon and further encouraged to know that Echo has persuaded Rex to give Clint back his money in exchange for Kim not turning the gun over to the cops and getting Rex charged with the murder of Victor Lord. Bo goes to Capricorn when Aubrey is working as a bartender and informs her, for the first time, that nobody has turned in the gun the Cutter promised he would turn in after finding it inside the porcupine so that he can't use it against Rex. At that point, she confronts Cutter telling him she will never trust him again knowing he is a scam artist and low life and she wants to work and come clean and lead an honorable life. Little does anybody know that the gun in question is at Rex's home. Echo and Roxy discover that somebody has fired a shot from it and assume it must be Rex who killed Victor Lord. But right when they are distracted, Shane takes the gun and goes to find Jack Manning to \"finish the job\".",
