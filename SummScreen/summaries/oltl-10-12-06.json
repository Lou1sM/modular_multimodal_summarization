Vincent threatened to knock the door down, so Rex finally put on a shirt and answered it. Vincent ordered Rex to step aside. Rex told Vincent to beat it. \"You can't stop me,\" he responded. Cristian crept up behind Vincent and said, \"Maybe he can't, but I can.\" Vincent told Cristian that he and Layla are the most important people in the world to him, but nobody was buying it. Vincent left. \n\n\nViki went to La Boulaie to find Dorian, but caught David strutting around in his underwear. He told her that he was living there now and suggested to Viki that he might \"let\" her offer him a job. Starr popped in and Viki asked why she wasn't in school. Starr said she's dropping out because of the \"Britney Squad.\" She explained how she and Langston went to a party and were offered drinks and drugs but that they said no. She recounted how a boy named Cole told the boys to back off and how Britney got jealous and had some guy to spill his beer all over her. Starr added that she called Britney a bitch, and Viki said she handled herself very well, \"Especially the bitch part. You nailed it. That's what she is.\" Starr said she is tired of fighting with people and wants to be a normal girl but that she never will be because of her parents. Viki told Starr she's a brilliant, unique young lady and should be proud of that. \n\n\nAntonio and Bree paid a visit to Nash at the Llanview winery. They found him lying passed out on the floor with empty beer bottles littered about. Antonio said he won't leave the baby with him given his hung-over condition. Nash said Antonio's objection has nothing to do with Brennan but is because he kissed Jessica the previous night. Antonio said he doesn't believe that Jessica kissed him and took off. Later, Vincent dropped by to check on his investment. He saw all the empty bottles and told Nash to make sure he doesn't regret investing.\n\n\nJessica visited Asa, who was at home day trading on the computer. She told him she's happy he's home. Asa asked if Natalie was doing okay, and Jessica admitted she was worried about her. Asa said, \"Natalie is a Buchanan. She'll get through this.\" Nigel came in and told Asa to tell Jessica about the picture. Jessica asked who was in the photo, and David walked into the room and said, \"My mother.\" Asa said the woman's name was Emma Bradley, and David said, yes, that's his mother. Asa asked Jessica to leave. David questioned Asa about the connection was between him and his mother. \"Your mother was one of the great loves of my life,\" Asa answered. David asked Asa if he was his father.\n\n\nCristian told Antonio about Vincent, and Antonio said he'd go arrest him. Cris said no, that he'd handle it. Jessica walked up and Antonio asked her if she kissed Nash. She said yes. Antonio asked Jessica if she had feelings for Nash.\n\n\nMichael, Eve and Marcie asked Natalie if she would be Tommy's godmother. She was taken aback, but honored and agreed to do it. They told Natalie that the same pastor who performed John's funeral would also do the christening, but she said that was okay. Then Marcie and Michael went to see Rex and asked him to be Tommy's godfather. Rex was shocked, but Marcie said that even though they fight, \"I know you can be kind and you can be loving.\" She said that the Killing Club experience kind of bonded them for life. Rex agreed and said he'd do it. \n\n\nNatalie told Eve that she's surprised Marcie would ask Rex to be the godfather given how they push each other's buttons. Eve pointed out that it sounds like they behave like a brother and sister. Natalie noted that it was true and that it isn't much different from her relationship with Rex. Everyone met at the church and Tommy was christened. Michael said that John was looking out for little Tommy. Everyone left except for Rex and Natalie. Rex observed that John should've been there. Natalie said at first that John was there, in her heart, but then said that no, he isn't there at all.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Antonio brings Bree to Nash's place and finds him passed out on the floor and the house messy. Nash seems to have forgotten that he was to spend the day with the baby that day. He will take the child but Antonio refuses to give the girl to him. \"You are hung over and not prepared for this.\" Nash isn't sure why Antonio is doing this to him, but then it suddenly comes to him that this is about he and Jessica kissing the night before. Antonio doesn't believe that there was any kiss between them, and even if there had been, Antonio isn't sure what the point it that Nash would be trying to make. Nash knows that after seeing the changes in Jessica lately, and her punching Claudia, it shouldn't be too hard to see what point Nash is trying to make. Rex and Adriana are with Layla at the apartment when Vincent comes banging on the door to get in. She doesn't want to see him. He will not go. Rex opens the door and Vincent tries to get in. Rex warns him that he can defend himself but Vincent isn't phased. Cristian shows up and tells that if Layla doesn't want to see him, then she won't see him. Vincent tries again to make Cristian see that he and Layla are the two most important people to him. Doesn't work. Vincent tells Layla from across the room that he loves her and when she wants him back, he will be waiting. Asa fires Nigel when he asks Jessica to get the secret out of Asa that he is hiding, about the picture. Asa tells her about the picture that he found on himself after passing out long ago. David walks in just as Jessica is asking about the picture. \"It is my mother isn't it?\" Jessica leaves so the men can talk alone. David tells that his mother's maiden name is Bradley, and both he and Spencer have that as a middle name. When Asa tells that the woman was one of the great loves of his life, David asks. \"Are you my father?\" Antonio and Cristian talk about Vincent and how they are going to watch him, and bring him in if he screws up, even a little bit. Antonio looks up and sees Jessica walking in the park. He asks her why she didn't mention that she had been kissing with Nash the night before. \"He kissed me. He was drunk and it didn't mean anything. Antonio has to wonder. She punches Claudia when she learns the woman slept with Nash, and now she keeps the secret of them sharing a kiss. \"Do you have feelings for Nash?\"",
