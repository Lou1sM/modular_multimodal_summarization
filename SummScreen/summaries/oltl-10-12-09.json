As Rachel and Destiny listened, Greg approached and overheard Matthew state that Greg had recommended Dr. Nance for the job. After confessing that he had referred Matthew to Dr. Nance, Greg assured Nora and Bo that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was an excellent surgeon. Nora questioned whether Dr. Nance was as capable a surgeon as Greg. Greg confessed that he possessed a better track record than Dr. Nance. Terrified about Matthew's fate, Nora begged Greg to reconsider and operate on Matthew. As Nora's eyes filled with tears, Greg said that he couldn't perform the surgery, and he walked away.\n\n\nAs a solemn Greg sat in Shaun's room and replayed his conversation with Nora in his head, Rachel entered the room and asked him to do her a favor. Reminding Greg that Matthew trusted him, Rachel asked Greg if he would assist Dr. Nance during Matthew's surgery. Stating that Greg was Matthew's only hope, Rachel insisted that she wanted Greg present during Matthew's surgery in case something went wrong.\n\n\nIn a hospital corridor, a devastated Nora collapsed into Bo's arms. The possible outcome of Matthew's upcoming surgery terrified Nora. Nora pleaded with Bo to figure out a way to save their son. Bo suggested that they support their son but later told Nora that he had a plan.\n\n\nIn the hall, Destiny offered to accompany Matthew to Seattle the next day. Matthew reminded Destiny that Shaun needed her, but Destiny replied, \"I love my brother, but I lo -- \" Bo and Nora approached and interrupted Destiny's statement. To Matthew's surprise, Nora and Bo related that they would no longer fight with him. While Matthew was pleased when his parents informed him that they would join him in Seattle for his surgery, Destiny appeared disappointed.\n\n\nInside Todd's house, Noelle babysat Jack, who was concerned about his mother's condition. As Noelle attempted to console Jack, Ross lurked around outside. Ross placed a call to Elijah, who advised him to leave Llanview at once. Disregarding Elijah's warning, Ross exclaimed, \"I need to know where T\u00e9a stashed my kid! If she won't tell me the truth, I have a good idea where I can find out!\"\n\n\nBack inside, Dorian phoned and informed Noelle that Blair would be fine. As Noelle assured Jack that his mother would make a full recovery, Ross sneaked inside the house. Unnoticed, Ross rushed upstairs. Moments later, Ross emerged downstairs with a briefcase that displayed the initials, \"TD.\" As Ross made a dash for the door, Noelle stopped him and questioned why he was on the premises and in possession of T\u00e9a's briefcase. Ross refused to return the briefcase, and a struggle ensued. Hearing the commotion, Jack intervened and hit Ross over the head, rendering him unconscious. After placing Ross in restraints, Noelle phoned the police.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Amelia and Nick held their breath when reporters asked David if he was aware of Dorian's secret life. Keeping his promise to Dorian, David lied and implied that Dorian had given him signals that she was possibly gay.\n\n\nAfterward, Fish and Kyle watched as Amelia and Nick thanked David for his participation in their plan. As Amelia and Nick declared that everyone deserved the right to be married under the law, Fish spoke up and questioned their motives. Reminding Fish that he was also gay, Amelia insisted that she was trying to create a fair world for gay individuals, including Fish. When Fish argued that it was wrong to lie about having feelings for someone, Nick questioned whether Fish had plans to reveal their secret to the world. Fish stated that he didn't intend to divulge what he had learned, but Amelia and Nick were skeptical. As Amelia and Nick continued to put pressure on Fish, he received a work-related phone call and excused himself.\n\n\nWhile waiting for the police to arrive, Jack told Noelle that his mother had been secretly hiding Ross in the cabana. Moments later, Fish arrived and carted Ross off to jail. Fish also took the briefcase to submit as evidence.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Amelia wondered if Fish would keep his promise and keep silent about her scheme. When Amelia and Nick pressured Kyle for insight into Fish's frame of mind, Kyle related that Fish would do what Fish thought was right. Adamant that she didn't want any problems from Fish, Amelia suggested that Kyle convince Fish to work with them. When Kyle resisted, Nick drew him close and asked, \"Don't you want the opportunity to marry the man you love?\"\n\n\nAt the police station, Ross refused to answer Fish's questions. As Fish placed T\u00e9a's briefcase into evidence, Fish stated, \"Whatever is in that briefcase must be very important to you.\" Ross replied, \"You have no idea!\" Later, Ross phoned Elijah and informed him that he had been arrested. Ross related that he hadn't found the evidence he had been looking for because the briefcase was locked. Observing the briefcase that sat on a nearby desk, Ross declared, \"Wherever T\u00e9a has my kid, the answer has to be in that briefcase.\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, T\u00e9a was relieved when Starr informed her that Blair had suffered minor injuries, but T\u00e9a panicked when she learned that Todd was speaking with Blair inside her hospital room. As T\u00e9a prepared to enter Blair's room, Dorian appeared and threatened to physically harm T\u00e9a if she took a step toward Blair's room. Starr was shocked when Dorian announced that T\u00e9a had pushed Blair out the window. T\u00e9a became emotional when Dorian defended Blair and stated that T\u00e9a was a terrible person because she had never experienced motherhood. Insisting that she hadn't caused Blair's injuries, T\u00e9a brushed past Dorian and stepped inside Blair's room.\n\n\nInside Blair's room, Blair told Todd that she had to tell him something about T\u00e9a. Blair struggled to tell Todd what was on her mind, but Todd continued to interrupt her. Determined to express her thoughts, Blair blurted out, \"T\u00e9a's lying! She told me something..!\" T\u00e9a entered the room and warned, \"Blair, don't say another word!\"\n\n\nAs Starr and Dorian rushed into the room, Blair stated that she remembered arguing with T\u00e9a, but couldn't recall what the argument had been about. Dorian related that Blair was apparently suffering from temporary memory loss, which was often the result of a concussion. Dorian said that Blair appeared to remember everything except what had taken place before T\u00e9a had pushed her out the window. As T\u00e9a breathed a sigh of relief, Dorian announced that memory loss was often short-lived. A frustrated Todd stepped toward T\u00e9a and asked, \"Relieved?\" Guiding T\u00e9a out of the room, Todd said that he wanted to have a word with her.\n\n\nBlair was aggravated that she couldn't remember T\u00e9a's secret. Urging Blair to forget about the argument, Dorian suggested that Blair stop worrying about Todd and T\u00e9a. Blair was convinced that the secret was something that Todd needed to know. Blair thought she had let Todd down by failing to remember.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Todd demanded to know what T\u00e9a was hiding.\n\n\n",
