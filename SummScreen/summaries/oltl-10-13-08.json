    "soap_central": "\nThe Dip Of Death\n\n\nSeveral rooms at Llanfair buzzed with activity. In the foyer, Tess searched for Jared and Tina, but was startled to learn that Viki had arrived home. Expressing her need to be with her family, Viki announced that she decided to cut her trip short. Pretending to be Jessica, Tess gave her mother a hug, but wasn't pleased by her surprise arrival. \n\n\nIn the kitchen, Cain, armed with a sledgehammer, demanded to know where Tina had hidden the Mendorran jewels. Holding a butcher knife, Tina was guarding the basement door and protecting Jared and Natalie from Tess. Claiming to have no knowledge of the jewels, Tina warned Cain not to enter the basement. When Cain ordered Tina to allow him entry, Tina blurted out that the jewels weren't in the basement. Convinced that Tina had the jewels hidden somewhere at Llanfair, Cain threatened Tina with the sledgehammer and insisted that she lead him to the jewels. Cain disarmed Tina and placed the knife on the counter. A defeated Tina led Cain to the safe. \n\n\nViki said that she wanted to help Jessica through the remaining months of her pregnancy, but also wanted to find out what had happened to Natalie. Upon Viki's mention of Natalie, Tess tried to convince Viki that Natalie's guilt had caused her to leave town, but Viki appeared suspicious. Citing that Natalie would never leave her pregnant sister or the man that she loved behind, Viki was certain that there was more to Natalie's disappearance. When Viki asked to see Natalie's hand-written letter and to speak with Jared, Tess made up an excuse and suggested that her mother head upstairs and rest. Viki agreed, but stated that she wanted to see Bree and insisted that her daughter accompany her upstairs. Cornered, a nervous Tess escorted Viki upstairs. \n\n\nAt the very moment Tess and Viki went upstairs, Tina and Cain entered the library. As a flustered Tina fumbled with the combination, Cain ordered Tina to open the safe. Claiming that Cain was making her nervous, Tina begged him to give her a moment to get herself together. Cain obliged and took a seat next to the table where Tess's \"laced\" dip sat. Waiting for Tina to open the safe, Cain tasted Tess's dip. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs in the basement, Jared discovered Natalie in the secret room. Jared attempted to hurl a chair through the glass, but Natalie warned him that Tess would hear the noise and convinced him that he would have to figure out the security code on the locked door. \n\n\nUnable to figure out Tess's security code, Jared told Natalie that he would go and find help. Fearing that something would happen to him and she would never be found, Natalie begged Jared to stay with her. Jared and Natalie finally came up with Tess's secret code, and the couple breathed a sigh of relief. Natalie tried to exit the room on her own, but was prevented from doing so due to her injured leg. Jared entered the room and placed Natalie in his arms. In tears, Natalie expressed her love for Jared and told him that Tess had forced her to write the Dear John letter. While Natalie continued to plead her case to him, Jared was only concerned with fleeing from Tess's torture chamber. Before Jared could step out of the room with Natalie, a devilish Tess appeared and locked them inside. \n\n\nNatalie and Jared demanded to know what Tess's plans were concerning them. Teasing Jared and Natalie about their predicament, Tess assured them that no one would ever find them. When Jared suggested that Tina knew where they were, Tess stated that Tina would never reveal their whereabouts. As Jared and Natalie cursed Tess and proclaimed their love for one another, a smiling Tess left them trapped in the basement. \n\n\nJared blamed himself for their problems, but Nat was thankful that they were together. Suggesting that they come up with a plan to escape, Natalie showed Jared the television monitor that Tess had set up. Turning on the monitor, they discovered Viki in the kitchen. Viki's suspicions were aroused when she found the knife on the counter. As Viki headed toward the basement door, Natalie and Jared shouted for her. \n\n\nMeanwhile, back in the library, Tina panicked when she realized that Tess was the only person who knew the combination to the safe. Turning to Cain, Tina told him that she couldn't open the safe. Rising to his feet, Cain gave Tina an intense look and fell over. A shocked Tina tried to aid Cain. \n\n\nAs Tina moaned and held onto Cain, Tess appeared and asked what had happened. Accusing Tess of killing Cain, Tina told her that he had eaten her \"laced\" dip.\" Bothered by the inconvenience, Tess suggested that Tina keep her voice down because Viki might hear her. Tina was surprised to learn that Viki was home. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Blair waited for Starr to arrive for her Lamaze class. Blair smiled as she daydreamed about her night of lovemaking with John. Starr arrived and interrupted her mother's happy thoughts. After teasing her mother about her relationship with John, the conversation turned to Starr's fear of giving birth and handing her child over to Marcie. Although she believed that she was doing the right thing by giving her child to Marcie, Starr felt guilty about her decision. Blair praised her daughter for making such a tough decision, and the two headed off to Lamaze class. \n\n\nInside, Starr was uncomfortable with the conversation of the anxious parents-to-be and continued to state her fears concerning the delivery. Reminding her daughter that Dr. Joplin had assured them that Starr and the baby would be fine, Blair managed to ease Starr's fear about any trouble with the pregnancy. After class, Blair stepped out of the room to inform Marcie of the baby's progress and left Starr alone. Feeling a severe pain, Starr clutched her stomach. Moments later, Blair appeared and found a distressed Starr. When Blair asked what was wrong, Starr replied, \"It's the baby!\" \n\n\nStaring at Todd and Keyes mug shots and an official document that contained information on Janet, John placed a phone call. Meanwhile, at Todd's home, Janet received a phone call from John. As John told Janet to meet him at the police station to discuss her past activities, Todd and Marty returned home. Hearing Todd's voice, John instructed Janet to keep quiet about their conversation. Making up an excuse, Janet headed off to meet with John. \n\n\nNoticing that Marty was in possession of a journal, Todd questioned what thoughts she had chosen not to share with him. Stating that she had secrets that she needed to jot down, Marty assured Todd that she still wanted to spend her life with him. As they discussed starting a new life together, Todd appeared troubled. When Marty questioned what was bothering him, Todd stated that he was a terrible person when he found Marty in Ramsey's apartment, but assured her that he had become a changed person. The conversation was interrupted by a knock on the door. Insisting that he wanted to give Marty some privacy so that she could write in her journal, Todd closed the doors to the living room and answered the door. \n\n\nAlone with her thoughts, Marty wrote about her feeling regarding Todd's marriage proposal. In her journal, Marty wrote that she once had feelings of obligation for Todd, but her feelings had turned to love for him. \n\n\nTodd wasn't pleased to find Dr. Joplin at his door. The doctor brought him a sonogram of Starr's baby and pleaded with him to reconsider his dastardly plan to steal the child. Todd was unmoved by her pleas. Stating that she believed that he actually loved Starr, Joplin urged him to do the right thing. \n\n\nAt the police station, John confronted Janet about the crimes she had committed years earlier in Llanview, under the name Lee Halprin. Denying John's accusations, Janet stated that she wasn't the person that John thought she was. Unconvinced by Janet's denial, John mentioned how she had obtained a nursing degree in her absence from Llanview and surmised that Ramsey had used his connections with the Bureau to suppress her past identity. John told Janet that Ramsey had sought Janet out to help him because he needed a nurse that would keep her mouth shut. \n\n\nWhen John threatened to contact a few Llanview residents who could identify her as Lee, Janet succumbed to his threats and admitted her true identity. Janet said that she had changed her life for the better and was no longer involved in a life of crime. Janet still refused to give John any information regarding Todd or Marty. Presenting Janet with a photo of Marty, John asked her if Marty was the woman that Janet was caring for at Todd's home. \n\n\n",
