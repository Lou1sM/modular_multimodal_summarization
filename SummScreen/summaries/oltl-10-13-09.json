    "soap_central": "\nWhy Blair Aired\n\n\nStacy went to see Rex at the carriage house to let him know that he had forgotten to pay the cable bill. Rex informed Stacy that the bill had not been overlooked. Stacy was furious; she demanded to know how he expected her to spend her time. Rex suggested that Stacy read a book or listen to music. Stacy blanched at the thought. She insisted that she needed her romantic comedies.\n\n\nStacy seized the opportunity to mention Gigi and Rex's recent encounter with Schuyler and Kim at the movies. Stacy repeatedly implied that Gigi had been jealous when she'd seen Schuyler with Kim. Rex was forced to defend Gigi, claiming that the problem had been Kim, not Schuyler being on a date. Stacy claimed that she thought that Schuyler and Kim would make a wonderful couple if Gigi managed to stay out of their business.\n\n\nRex had heard enough. He promised to pay the cable bill then informed Stacy that he wanted a paternity test as soon as possible. Stacy realized that she had pushed Rex too far. She assured him that she was eager to take the test to prove that he was the father; however, Stacy didn't want to endanger her baby. She refused to take the test if there were any risk to the child.\n\n\nSchuyler was working behind the bar when Gigi arrived for her shift at Rodi's. Gigi apologized for her conduct at the movie theater. She hadn't meant to spoil the ending of the movie for Schuyler. Schuyler admitted that her version of the ending had been more interesting than the movie's actual ending. Gigi admitted that she thought it had been weird how they had all ended up at the same movie. Schuyler questioned if it had been a coincidence.\n\n\nGigi seemed perplexed. She revealed that she and Rex had been talking about seeing the movie for a while. Schuyler admitted that Kim had suggested that Gigi had followed them because Gigi had been jealous. Gigi laughed off the suggestion. She made it clear that she didn't view Kim as any kind of threat; however, Gigi hoped that her behavior had not ruined Schuyler's date. Schuyler confessed that he doubted there would be a second date with Kim. Gigi pretended to be disappointed, but he saw through the lie\n\n\nMoments later, Kim approached them. She asked Gigi why she had left the movies, but before Gigi could respond, a customer called out. As soon as Gigi walked away, Schuyler demanded to know what Kim was up to. Kim claimed that she was trying to help Schuyler out because she could tell how much Gigi liked him. Kim encouraged Schuyler to go after Gigi.\n\n\nGigi suddenly appeared behind Kim. She was curious about what kind of bad advice Kim was offering Schuyler. Kim was unrepentant. She accused Gigi of following them to the movies then accused Gigi of being attracted to Schuyler. Gigi informed Kim that Rex had surprised her with the movie tickets and that she'd had no idea that Kim and Schuyler had been headed to the movies.\n\n\nKim insisted that the attraction between Gigi and Schuyler was noticeable to everyone, including Rex, who happened to approach them at that moment. Rex ignored Kim as he asked to speak to Gigi. After Gigi and Rex walked away, Schuyler told Kim that he hadn't appreciated her comments. Kim didn't show any remorse.\n\n\nRoss was at the Llanview Police Station, handcuffed to a chair. He spotted T\u00e9a's briefcase on a nearby desk just before Elijah arrived. Ross implored Elijah to help him steal the briefcase. Ross was confident that it contained information on where to find \"the kid.\" Elijah decided to work on Ross's release. He asked Ross who the arresting officer had been. Ross pointed to Oliver.\n\n\nElijah threatened Oliver with a lawsuit because he had failed to take Ross to the hospital to have his injuries treated. Oliver refused to allow pushy people to intimidate him. As Oliver ranted, he revealed details about his failed relationship with Kyle as well as T\u00e9a's strong-arm tactics following Blair's fall. Ross was stunned to hear that Blair had been injured. Ross insisted on being released immediately.\n\n\nWhen no one complied, Ross managed to break free from the chair then fled on foot. Oliver gave chase but was unable to apprehend Ross. When Oliver returned to the squad room, he issued an ATB on Ross and announced that he had a fairly good idea where Ross was headed. Moments later, Elijah found himself alone in the squad room with T\u00e9a's briefcase.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Dorian tried to give Blair some painkillers. Blair refused to take the medication because she wanted to have a clear head. Blair was certain that T\u00e9a was hiding something and that Blair had the information locked away in her head. John entered the room moments later. Dorian immediately insisted that John arrest T\u00e9a for pushing Blair out the window. John admitted that if Blair couldn't testify about what had happened, there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove that T\u00e9a had pushed Blair.\n\n\nDorian was outraged. She promised that things would be different when she was elected as mayor. John snickered that he had heard that congratulations were in order for Dorian. Dorian realized that John was referring to her engagement to Amelia. Blair was curious about what John was talking about, but Dorian cut him off before he could explain. Dorian pointedly told John that it wasn't the appropriate time to discuss the issue.\n\n\nJohn focused his attention on Blair. He told her that he was getting tired of visiting her in the hospital. He promised that he would look into the circumstances of her fall, and he left. Dorian commented that John had seemed just a tad too concerned for Blair. Blair sensed where her aunt was headed with the comment; she reminded Dorian that John was with Marty. Dorian wasn't quick to dismiss the possibility of more between John and Blair.\n\n\nBlair informed her aunt that the topic of John was off-limits. Dorian decided to question Blair about Todd, but Blair refused to discuss it. Blair insisted on finding a doctor who could help her recover her memories. Dorian warned Blair that there was a possibility that she might never remember. Before Blair could respond, Ross raced into the room. Ross quickly assured himself that Blair was all right before he collapsed into a chair. Blair noticed the handcuffs and questioned him about them.\n\n\nRoss evaded the question by asking Blair if T\u00e9a had pushed her out the window. Blair admitted that she didn't recall what had prompted the fall. Ross decided to question T\u00e9a about the incident but found Oliver blocking his path. Ross tried to escape, but Oliver was prepared. Oliver shot Ross with a Taser. Ross crumpled to the ground in a heap.\n\n\nTodd wanted answers from T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a agreed to tell Todd everything that she knew about Blair's fall. However, she found it irritating that everyone seemed to have forgotten that Blair had once done the same exact thing to T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a didn't understand why everyone was upset, since Blair had only sustained minor injuries. Todd didn't appreciate how T\u00e9a appeared to suggest that Blair had somehow deserved what had happened to her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd about the events leading up to Blair's fall, but she conveniently left out the details about Blair's discovery that T\u00e9a had given birth to Todd's child. Todd sensed T\u00e9a's deception. He accused T\u00e9a of intentionally shoving Blair out the window. Todd believed that T\u00e9a wanted Blair out of the way at any cost. T\u00e9a was hurt that Todd would have such a low opinion of her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a reminded Todd of how many times he had lied to her. Todd readily admitted that he had been less than honest; however, he had always been truthful about his feelings for her. Todd confided that two days prior, he wouldn't have believed that T\u00e9a was capable of pushing Blair out a window, but that had been before he had discovered her deception.\n\n\nT\u00e9a accused Todd of choosing Blair over her. Todd insisted that it wasn't that simple. He explained that when he had seen Blair land on the pool cover, he had been horrified by the thought that he was about to witness the death of the mother of his children. T\u00e9a realized that she was going to be the bad guy in the scenario regardless of what she said. Todd told T\u00e9a that he had been ready to move past her lie; that was why he had been at La Boulaie.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was hopeful; she reminded Todd that it wasn't too late for them to work things out. Todd disagreed because T\u00e9a had not been honest from the beginning. T\u00e9a suggested that they probably would have ended up in the same place no matter what had happened. T\u00e9a was certain that Todd would be with Blair. Todd wondered if that was what T\u00e9a wanted.\n\n\nT\u00e9a confessed that it didn't matter what she wanted because Todd clearly wanted Blair. T\u00e9a invited Todd to go see Blair. When Todd didn't move, T\u00e9a began yelling at him. As Todd walked to the door, T\u00e9a added, \"Don't stay with your wife.\" Todd stopped. He informed T\u00e9a that she had never been his wife, merely his ex-fianc\u00e9e. Todd gave T\u00e9a the opportunity to give him a reason to stay with her, but T\u00e9a was all out of answers.\n\n\nNatalie interrupted one of Marty's therapy sessions. Natalie claimed that she needed to discuss an urgent matter concerning John. Marty apologized to her patient, but made arrangements to accommodate Natalie. Once they were alone, Natalie told Marty about John's investigation into Jared's possible role in the stalker's murder. Natalie insisted that Jared was innocent and that John was unfairly targeting her husband.\n\n\nMarty understood the difficult position that Natalie was in, but she didn't feel comfortable asking John to drop his investigation against Jared. As Natalie prepared to leave, John walked in. Natalie bristled when she saw him and freely admitted that she had attempted to persuade Marty to intervene on her behalf. Natalie realized it had been a pointless request, since John stubbornly refused to accept when he was wrong.\n\n\nJohn explained that he had to follow the evidence. Natalie wondered if that included when the evidence led him down the wrong path. John clarified that if Jared were innocent, then eventually the evidence would prove that. Natalie remained convinced that John was out to railroad Jared. After Natalie left, John apologized to Marty for putting her in the awkward situation.\n\n\nMarty commented that it had appeared there were strong emotions between John and Natalie. John admitted that he had a history with Natalie, but he insisted that it didn't go beyond that. He locked the office door and joined Marty on the sofa to show her that he was all hers.\n\n\n",
