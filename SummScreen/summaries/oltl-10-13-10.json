When Clint informed Viki that he had heard what had happened, and that he was sorry, Viki ran into his arms.  Viki broke free and stated that she was worried about Todd, although she thanked Clint \"for the shoulder.\"  Clint said that he had just received a visit from \"a familiar face,\" and Viki frowned.\n\n\nViki expressed shock that Echo had returned to Llanview, and Clint and Viki discovered that they had each hired a private investigator to check on Echo.  Viki informed Clint that she had hired Rex, and Clint asked Viki to share any information that Rex turned up.  As Viki started to take a tray upstairs to Jessica, Clint volunteered to take it instead.\n\n\nIn her bed, Jessica read the headline, \"Clarke Causes Chaos,\" on her laptop, when Brody walked over and kissed her.  Jessica worried that her cousins were kidnapped, and Brody pleaded with Jessica not to worry.  Brody insisted that the police would find them and \"bring them home.\"  Brody said that the situation had made him realize just how good they had it.  \"The last night, when I was searching for Starr, Dani, and Hope, all I could think about was how lucky we are to be having a kid.  And even if Ford is the father, this baby is a part of you, Jessica, like Bree is a part of you.  And we both know how much I love her.  So, it's all good.\"  Brody and Jessica kissed.\n\n\nAfter Brody left Jessica's room, Clint and Viki arrived with the tray.  Jessica informed them that Brody might not be the father of her baby.  Jessica related the events of prom night, and Clint was furious that some scum had taken advantage of his daughter.  When Jessica revealed that Ford might be the father, Viki remarked that Jessica was not his first victim.  Jessica explained that Ford had not forced himself on her; however, Viki and Clint insisted that Jessica had not been in her right mind.  Jessica indicated that Ford did not want the baby, even if it was his.  Viki knew that Brody would love the baby, no matter what, as Clint stood up to leave.  Before Clint left, Viki begged him not to make matters worse.\n\n\nJessica suspected that Clint was headed straight to Ford.  Jessica then told Viki that she would be able to test the baby, and Viki encouraged her to have the test, so \"at least, you will know it, you can accept it, and you can move on.\"  Viki reminded Jessica that Brody would love the baby, just as Clint had loved Kevin, Joey, and Jessica.  Jessica smiled.\n\n\nAt the Sun, Kelly prepped the volunteers to \"man the phones\" for a hot line.  Rex entered the room, as Kelly begged the volunteers to ask for help, so that Dani, Starr, and Hope could return safely.  When Rex claimed that Kelly was handling the emergency \"like a champ,\" Kelly stated that she was doing what needed to be done.  Rex hugged Kelly.\n\n\nAs she wiped away her tears, Kelly said, \"That will teach you to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"  Rex replied, \"At least, no one's naked.\"  Kelly laughed and thanked Rex for his shoulder.  When Kelly wondered about Rex's visit, Rex requested to review her archives at the tabloid for his client.  Rex then informed Kelly that Viki was his client.  Rex told Kelly that his investigation was on Echo diSavoy.\n\n\nRex explained about Clint and Echo's past affair.  He added that Echo had believed that Clint had killed her mother.  Echo had wanted revenge, and when Clint \"got wind of it,\" he had tried to break things off.  Echo had then attempted to commit suicide, but Clint had tried to stop her.  However, Echo had been able to throw herself off of the bridge, and Clint had been blamed.  Rex pointed out that Echo had tried to fake her own death, and Kelly expressed sympathy for Clint.  However, Rex yelled that Clint deserved no sympathy.  Rex then covered that it was because Clint had cheated on Viki.\n\n\nKelly only hoped that Ms. diSavoy \"went away,\" because she sounded like trouble.  Rex pondered that Echo had promised to stay out of town, but that he had found a speeding ticket, which Echo had received less than a year later.  Rex then said that he needed to check on Viki and left.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Rex informed Viki that Echo had wanted everyone to believe that she was returning for the first time since Clint's trial.  However, Rex revealed that after her fling with Clint, Echo had returned less than a year after she had left.  Viki wondered why Echo had returned, and Rex indicated that it was his job to find that out.  Rex then ensured Viki that Echo would not hurt her again.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian expressed hope to Langston that one of her constituents would call the hot line with information regarding the kidnapping.  Langston informed her that she had put the news on MyFace, and she hoped that it would help.  When Langston offered to get Dorian coffee, Dorian refused and then requested that Langston eat breakfast.  The doorbell rang.\n\n\nDorian opened the door to a nosy reporter, who took a picture, as the flash blinded Dorian.  Dorian was outraged, but the reporter pointed out that she was indeed Echo.  Dorian called Echo a slut in French, as she reminisced on a past incident, when Echo had claimed that she had not meant to break Clint and Viki up.  Echo insisted that she was wounded by the insult, because she believed that she and Dorian had been friends.  Dorian declared that Echo was \"too smart a cookie\" to think that they were ever friends.\n\n\nAfter Dorian pointed out that she was the Llanview mayor, Echo handed Dorian the flyer.  Echo insisted that her heart went out to Dorian, and Dorian exclaimed, \"That would come in handy, if only you had a heart.  Thank you for your concern.\"  When Dorian tried to slam the door, Echo slyly caught it with her foot.\n\n\nAfter Dorian thanked the caller on the phone for rounding up volunteers, she discovered Echo in her house.  Echo claimed that she and Dorian had much in common, \"unless, of course, you've lost your desire to see Queen Victoria miserable.\"  Dorian insisted that she had \"nothing but respect for Viki.\"  Echo asked how Dorian's respect for Clint was since Dorian had once accused Clint of murdering Echo.  Dorian pointed out, \"Obviously, I was wrong, because here you are, still the same conniving schemer you always were.\"\n\n\nEcho observed that what Dorian had done to \"Chuckles\" was worse than anything that Echo had done and reminded her also that Dorian had once stolen Buchanan Enterprises from Clint.  Echo indicated that \"great minds\" thought alike, and Dorian exclaimed, \"The day my mind resembles yours, I'll check myself into a mental hospital.\"\n\n\nEcho squealed that David was \"yummy,\" even though he had left Dorian at the altar.  Dorian screamed and demanded to know the reason for Echo's visit.  When Dorian threatened to have Echo arrested, Echo explained that \"Chuckles\" was the reason she had returned to Llanview.  Dorian stressed that Charlie was devoted to Viki, and Echo insisted that she had really only wanted a job at the Banner.  Echo sneered that Viki had refused.  Echo then promised, \"And that was a mistake.\"\n\n\nDorian believed that Echo was delusional, but Echo insisted that she was just a good reporter.  She told Dorian that she could print a picture of a grief-stricken Dorian in the newspapers, and Dorian was outraged that Echo would exploit her grief.  Dorian yelled that Echo was a vulture and threw her out, as Echo snapped a picture of Dorian.\n\n\nAt Marty's, Hannah walked through the front door, and Marty expressed her relief to see the young woman.  Marty had feared that Eli \"had gotten to\" Hannah also.  Hannah related that she had been passing out flyers most of the night.  When Marty asked about the scratches on her neck, Hannah claimed that she had \"tripped into some bushes.\"\n\n\nMarty wanted to apply medication on the scratches, but Hannah refused and insisted that she was better off than Starr and Hope.  Marty insisted that Eli would not kill her grandchild, and they hugged.\n\n\nIn the Llanview Police Station, the reporters waited in the lobby for the commissioner's official statement regarding the kidnapping.  Bo announced that the police department was seeking Eli Clarke, as he held up a flyer with Eli's picture, and declared that Eli had last been spotted in Cherryville, Pennsylvania.  Bo reported that all three victims had been in the car at the time, and that John had given \"chase.\"  However, Bo related that he did not know the location of the vehicle or of the three girls at that time.\n\n\nJames and Nate watched, as Bo then thanked his assistant, Inez, who had organized the volunteers to distribute the flyers.  Bo hoped that Eli would reach out to Todd Manning to negotiate for the girls' release.  Cole walked into the station.\n\n\nOnce he spotted James, Cole grabbed him and yelled, \"You bastard!  Starr and Hope would be safe right now, if it weren't for you.\"  Cole believed that James was not satisfied that he had only drawn Starr into the mess, but that he had to put Hope in danger too.  James exclaimed that he was sorry, but Cole punched him anyway.  James punched Cole in return, and they scuffled on the floor.\n\n\nBo broke up the fight, but Cole and James continued to yell at each other.  Nate exclaimed that Cole should be yelling at him, not James.  Cole reminded Bo that James had a court order against him, which James had ignored, and Cole wanted Bo to lock James up.\n\n\nIn his office, Bo sympathized with Cole but stressed that Cole was blaming the wrong guy, because Eli was to blame.  Bo insisted that Cole return home.  Bo then declared that he would find Starr and Hope.\n\n\nAfter the fight, Inez walked with Ford, who insisted that James had only been trying to help his brother.  Bobby thanked Inez, because she had gotten him his job back.\n\n\nJames told Nate that he no longer cared about anything, and that included James's possible arrest, until Starr and Hope safely returned.  Later, Inez placed an icepack on James's face and wondered if Bo would put James in jail.  Bo walked out of his office and announced to James, \"You're free to go.\"  Inez thanked Bo, who felt that the brothers were punishing themselves enough.\n\n\nWhen Ford asked Brody about the baby, Brody declared that it had to stop, because Bobby was not supposed to care.  Ford held up a flyer and claimed that Hope had changed his mind.  \"A baby girl's missing.  That puts things in a whole new light.\"  However, Ford told Brody that he was not making a claim to the baby.  Brody stressed that Ford should put it out of his mind -- permanently.\n\n\nAfter Clint arrived at the police station, Bobby thanked Clint.  Ford insisted that he would never forget what Clint had done for him.  Clint slyly stated that there were some things that were never forgotten.\n\n\nLater, Clint saw Inez and told her that he knew why she had been unable to make their date at the restaurant.  When Inez tried to thank Clint for his favor to Bobby, he stated that Ford had already thanked him.  After Inez indicated that Bobby should think of some kind of repayment, Clint claimed that he would think of a way to repay Ford.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Jessica announced to Brody that she would have the paternity test, because she did not want to run from the truth.  Brody agreed.  \"You're right.  We need to know it, and if Ford's the father, I will make my peace with that, so I can start making this baby mine in every way that counts.\"  Jessica and Brody kissed.\n\n\nIn the lobby at La Boulaie, Langston opened the door to Markko.  When Markko expressed his sympathy and offered his help, Langston softly cried, \"Markko.\"  He took Langston in his arms.  Markko informed Langston that he would be visiting Cole and wanted Langston to accompany him.\n\n\nAs Langston walked down the stairs, Markko told her to be strong for Cole.  Ford walked up to the open front door and saw Langston and Markko embrace.  When Langston spotted Bobby, he told Langston that she was in good hands.  As Ford started to leave, Langston thanked him.\n\n\nLater, at Marty's, Hannah carried out tea for Marty, and Marty thanked her.  Hannah returned the thanks, because Marty had given her a home, even after Hannah had lied.  Hannah regretted that she had interfered with Cole and Starr and believed that she was the reason that Starr and Hope were missing.  When Marty asked how that could be, Hannah explained that Cole should have been with Starr and Hope, instead of her.  Marty insisted that Hannah had done nothing wrong, as Cole walked through the door.\n\n\nWhen Marty saw Cole's injured eye, Cole revealed that he had gotten into a fight with James over Starr.  However, Cole admitted that James had not been to blame, and that it was Eli, who had kidnapped Starr and Hope.  Cole felt helpless, because he knew that Eli did not care about Starr or Hope.  Marty indicated that she would rush to the police station for news and left.\n\n\nStill at the station, Nate told James that he would finally tell Dani that he loved her, although James claimed that Dani already knew.  When Nate insisted that James tell Starr, also, James exclaimed, \"Maybe...but if she gets out of this, I swear to God, I will stop trying to get her to love me back.\"\n\n\nIn Bo's office, Bo regretfully stated, \"Marty, I'm sorry.  I can't tell you where John is right now, because it's classified.  But I promise you, as soon as I find out anything, you and Cole will know it too.\"  Marty quietly said, \"Thank you,\" as Bo replied, \"Sure.\"  After Marty walked out, Bo answered the phone.  \"Talk to me, John.  Tell me something good.  You found them?  You found the girls?\"\n\n\nStill at Marty's, Cole noticed Hannah, who was near tears, and he asked if she were okay.  Hannah yelled that she would never be okay, and Cole asked if that was because of Starr.  Hannah cried to Cole, \"I can't stand it.  I can't let you suffer like this.  I have to tell you something.\"  Cole asked, \"Tell me what?\"  Hannah answered, \"What really happened to Starr and Hope.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Echo DiSavoy shows up at Dorian's door. She says she is in town to visit her old boyfriend, Chuckles - Charlie Banks. She tells Dorian that Viki refused to hire her at the Banner and that that was a mistake. Clint and Viki separately hire PIs to follow Echo. Rex asks Kelly for her help because the Sun has information from years before when Clint and Echo had an affair. Rex goes back to Llanfair and tells Viki that Echo returned t o Llanview after her fling with Charlie and was there a little less than a year after she left. Brody tells Ford not to ask about Jessica or the baby because he has no rights in the matter. Brody tells Jessica that he will love her baby even if Ford is the father. She tells him that she has decided to have the paternity test so she can know the truth. Jessica tells her parents that Brody might not be the baby's father. Clint demands to know who it is so she reluctantly names Robert Ford. Clint refuses to believe that Ford didn't take advantage of Jessica. Bo holds a press conference at the police station about the kidnapping of Dani, Starr, and Hope by Elijah Clark. James and Nate worry about Starr and Dani. Cole blames James for Starr and Hope's kidnapping. They get into a fight and then Cole tells Bo that James had Dani locked up in his apartment. Markko goes to see if Langston is ok. She is surprised that he is being nice to her after everything she did to him. He tells her that their friends need their help and that nothing else matters. Ford also shows up to check on Langston but when he sees that Markko is there, he leaves. Marty wonders where Hannah was all night and how she got scratches on her neck. Hannah says she fell into bushes while handing out fliers about the missing girls. She thinks it's her fault that the girls were kidnapped. Hannah tells Cole that she has to tell him what happened to Starr and Hope. Someone on the telephone tells Bo that they found the girls.",
