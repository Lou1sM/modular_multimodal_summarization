They attempted to make noise on the walls of the soundproofed room. Viki seemed hesitant as she faced the cupboard, and returned again and again to the wall, as if realizing she was missing something, but finally dismissed her feelings as jet lag and left the basement. Natalie was distraught, but Jared assured her that Tina would tell Viki the truth. As they held each other, Jared told Natalie that he'd never believed Tess's lies, and Natalie was confident that she could make it through their ordeal if he was there--even if they were stuck in the secret room forever. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, Tina mourned Cain's apparent demise before realizing that Tess could not possibly have planned for his arrival, after all, \"you certainly didn't know about his love of dip!\" \"Doesn't everybody love dip?\" Tess replied innocently. As it dawned on Tina that Tess had planned to use the poisoned dip against her, Tess told her not to worry; Cain was still breathing, and the dip merely contained a strong sedative. Tina begged Tess to help her hide Cain from prying eyes. The two co-conspirators threatened to turn on each other and spill their dirty secrets, but Tina warned that Tess would be unable to keep Jared and Natalie hidden from Viki without Tina's cooperation. Tess said that Tina's plan to free Natalie with Jared's help had failed, and that she had imprisoned both of them. \n\n\nAs the two women continued to bicker, Viki returned to the foyer and heard raised voices. When she entered the drawing room she found an empty room, with the doors to the terrace open. Meanwhile, outside, Tina and Tess stashed the unconscious Cain behind the patio. Tess rushed in to greet Viki, with Tina close on her heels. Viki was shocked to see her sister again. Tina told Viki that she had decided to stay at Llanfair to care for her wayward nieces and see to Sarah, who was searching for Cristian. Tess kept trying to get Viki to retire for the evening, but Viki shrugged off her fussing and decided to try the chips and dip. As she raised a chip to her mouth, Tina screamed, \"Step away from the dip!\" When Viki asked Tina why she couldn't eat the food, Tina mumbled that it was \"poisoned\"--and Tess covered by claiming the dip had gone sour. When the conversation turned to Natalie's sudden departure, Viki was unwilling to accept Tess's version of events, and decided she needed to call Jared. \n\n\nDown in the basement, Jared and Natalie were overjoyed to realize Jared still had his cell phone, just as Viki made her phone call upstairs. Jared answered Viki's call, and frantically tried to spill the beans to her about Tess and his imprisonment. Unfortunately, the cell reception in the underground chamber garbled and distorted his message, and Viki only caught a few words amidst static before the call dropped. As Jared attempted to call again, he and Natalie were confronted by Tess, who had dashed downstairs, and ordered them to hand over the phone or risk another attempt on Viki's life. Furious, Jared slid his cell phone through the access port. Tess pocketed it, and left Jared and Natalie in despair. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, Viki gave up on trying to reach Jared for the evening, but was touched by Tina's devotion to her search for Natalie. Tina admitted that she had come to care deeply for Natalie during her stay at Llanfair. Viki marveled that Tina might have changed, after all, and hugged her sister, who guiltily mumbled, \"I hope so.\" Meanwhile, on the terrace, Cain stirred. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Blair talked Starr through her breathing exercises as her contractions began. Marcie arrived, and provided moral support. Starr told her mother she wasn't ready for the baby to be born, but Marcie reassured her that everything would be fine, as Blair put in a call to Dr. Joplin. \n\n\nAt Todd's place, Marty continued to write in her diary, reflecting on how unreal her \"perfect day\" with Todd had seemed. As she wondered about the \"familiarity\" of the flowers they had picked in their meadow, she suddenly sneezed, realizing she was allergic to them. \n\n\nAs Marty continued to loudly sneeze, Todd argued with Dr. Joplin in the main hall. Joplin asked who the woman in the other room was, and Todd called her \"my partner.\" Joplin harangued Todd about his plans for his grandchild, and asked how he would continue on after making Starr believe her baby was dead. She asked him how his partner would go along with it. \"She doesn't have any idea what you're capable of, does she?\" Joplin asked. She told Todd that when Marty learned what he'd done to his daughter to get the child, he'd lose not only her but his entire family. \"I don't lose,\" Todd replied coldly. \"I make other people lose.\" \n\n\nJust then, Dr. Joplin took an emergency call from Blair, and told her she'd be at the hospital soon. When Todd asked if it was Starr going into labor, Dr. Joplin said maybe, and told him he had to decide--if his daughter gave birth that evening, would he make it the worst night of her life? After she left, Todd told Marty he had to go to the hospital to see to Starr in case she had the baby. Marty urged Todd to go be with his daughter. Alone again, she wrote in her diary about Todd, and her growing feelings for him, and how mothering a child felt right to her. Marty admitted to herself that she was unsure about their leaving Llanview when the baby was born, as she felt sure she would be leaving something behind. \n\n\nAt the police station, Janet, a.k.a. Lee Halpern, continued to stonewall John, and claimed she had never seen Marty Saybrooke in her life. John told her to reconsider, and warned her that he would find the people she had scammed with her business pursuits and con games and bring them down upon her head. Janet was fearful but refused to give in, and told John that \"everyone\" who lived with Todd Manning was there because they chose to be. \"Everyone?\" John asked, curious. John laid out the facts about Marty and Todd to Janet; he told her she had a son who missed her, and that if Marty was living with Todd, then she was living with the man who had raped her. Janet was clearly horrified by John's words, but tried to dismiss them as lies and manipulation. John asked if she would care about a woman in grave danger. \"Oh, I would,\" Janet said coolly. \"If I knew one. Which I don't. Are we done?\" John dismissed Janet, \"for now,\" and let her leave. On her way out of the station, Janet nearly collapsed, shaken by what she'd heard. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Dr. Joplin arrived and began to examine Starr as Blair and Marcie looked on, and Todd watched from outside the exam room. Soon, Joplin determined that Starr's labor pains were only a false alarm, and said that though they would have to move up her due date, Starr and her baby would be fine. As Dr. Joplin left to run some tests, Starr thanked her for her care and support. \n\n\nFeeling guilty, Joplin exited the exam room and briefed Todd on Starr's status. Disgusted, she told Todd that Starr was already a more responsible and loving parent than he was, and warned him again to rethink his scheme. After Todd left, Joplin returned to the women and told Starr that everything would be fine, and as she walked out, she swore to herself that she would deliver a healthy baby to Starr. \n\n\nBack at Todd's, Janet returned home and lied to Marty about where she'd been. Fearful, she began to question Marty about whether she felt happy or safe with Todd, but before she could get far, Todd returned. He assured his roommates that Starr's baby was fine, but said the delivery date was not far away and they needed to be ready to leave Llanview. Todd and Marty asked Janet to come with them, but she told them she had a headache and would talk about it later. \n\n\nAs Janet beat a hasty retreat upstairs, Todd and Marty wondered about her demeanor. Marty expressed concern for Starr, as well, and asked if perhaps they could stay in Llanview and raise the child with her. Todd refused to talk about it that night. \n\n\nAs Todd and Marty discussed baby names, Marcie, Blair, and Starr did the same at the hospital. Meanwhile, at the police station, John stared at Marty's photo. As Todd wandered around the house, Janet watched him from her hiding place on the stairs. Todd handed Marty a copy of Starr's sonogram, but his own eyes were drawn to a framed picture of Starr as a young child. And in the secret room at Llanfair, Jared and Natalie lay on the couch and comforted each other in their prison. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, Tess promised to tell Viki if she heard back from Jared, and urged her to go to bed. Viki finally agreed to go upstairs, and said goodnight to Tess and Tina. Once she was gone, the two women hurried out onto the terrace to move Cain, only to find that he was once again missing. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Right when Dr. Joplin informs Todd she refuses to go through with his \"plan\" to have Starr believing that her baby died so that he and his \"friend\" can raise it, she gets a call to get to the hospital as it looks as though Starr is having contractions. She goes to meet with Starr, Blair and Marcie and informs them that Starr might be giving birth sooner than expected. They are all confident and appreciative of her. And, at that point, she knows she is not about to help Todd. Marty still believes what Todd has told her; that Starr has chosen to let him raise her baby. John interrogates Janet the nurse and informs her that he knows that Todd Manning is hiding Marty Saybrooke in his home. He just needs to prove it. At that point, Janet does not know what to do in regard to John's \"suspicion\" and the fact that Todd and Marty are, in fact, together in the house and ready to move away. Tess makes certain that Viki never finds out what she has done to Natalie or Jared. And she \"motivates\" Tina not to tell her.",
