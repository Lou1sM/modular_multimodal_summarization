The psychic noted that the caller ID on the phone had indicated that Jessica had called without leaving a message. Jessica retorted that she had called to give Delphina a piece of her mind, pointing out that Delphina's insistence that Nash was back from the grave with a message was wrong. The man had turned out to be a stalker, not Nash.\n\n\nWhen Brody entered the room, Delphina advised him to stay close to Jessica, to look around him and especially behind him. Brody was skeptical until Delphina mentioned his sister, Nadine, hiding his baby bottles when they had been children. The person who had killed Wayne Landers was going to kill again, Delphina informed them.\n\n\nKim continued to pester Schuyler at Rodi's, insisting that Gigi had strong feelings for him. He denied it, as Stacy arrived and wanted to know what their conversation was about. Hearing Kim fill in her girlfriend, it suddenly dawned on Schuyler that the two women had set him up.\n\n\nSchuyler was angry when he realized that the reason Kim had asked him on a date was really about Stacy's pursuit of Rex. He accused Stacy of using him and urged her to get over Rex because Rex didn't want her. He was angry at himself because Gigi had warned him about Kim, but he had felt good when Kim had asked him out. Stacy thought he should reconsider before he missed his chance with Gigi.\n\n\nSchuyler declared that it wasn't a game, and he had thought he could move on if he had gone out with Kim. His feelings for Gigi didn't matter, he added, since she didn't care for him. Adamantly, Kim and Stacy voiced their beliefs that Gigi had feelings for Schuyler. They recommended that he \"seal the deal\" by going out with Kim again.\n\n\nWhen Schuyler advised them to find someone else, Stacy wanted to know what had happened to the \"bad boy\" she had known. He reminded her that he had been on drugs then and ha been a different person. He told Stacy once again that Rex would never want her. The women advised Schuyler to let them know when he was ready to make a move.\n\n\nOutside the bar, Rex asked Gigi for some honesty. He wanted to know if Gigi was jealous that Schuyler had been out on a date with Kim. She confessed that she was jealous, but she insisted that she didn't want to be with Schuyler. She felt that Schuyler had been through enough trouble in his life, and she didn't want to see him in a relationship with the wrong person. Rex pointed out that someone could only be jealous if they had feelings for someone and that protecting a friend wouldn't cause jealousy.\n\n\nIrritated, Gigi proclaimed that she didn't want a lecture. She reminded Rex of how jealous she had been when Rex had been with Stacy. Indicating that it wasn't the same thing, Rex asked Gigi point-blank if she had feelings for Schuyler. \"Yes,\" she replied.\n\n\nQuickly recovering, she said no, and she didn't know. Rex continued to press her for answers. Gigi decided that she didn't know why she had feelings for Schuyler, while Rex continued to insist that he had no feelings for Stacy. He thought they had a problem if Gigi had a \"thing\" for another guy.\n\n\nGigi revealed that Stacy's pregnancy was on her mind around the clock; she was unable to get over it, and the thought of it made her sick. She felt that Schuyler helped to calm her down, and she needed him, though she wasn't sure why. Rex thought that he should leave Gigi until she was able to sort things out. Worried about upsetting Shane again, Gigi insisted that she only wanted Rex, and she believed they'd be able to work things out if they stayed together. She believed in him and loved him. They hugged and agreed to try to work it out, though the look on Rex's face was one of doubt.\n\n\nAt the police station, Viki, Charlie, and Natalie were happy to learn that Jared had been released from police custody, until they learned that he was still considered a suspect. Jared explained that the police were still looking for evidence to connect him to the stalker's death. Nearby, Elijah spoke to Ross on the phone, urging his client to turn himself in. At Ross' request, Elijah agreed to figure out a way to get into T\u00e9a's briefcase, which was being held for evidence. Ross was sure that there was information inside about the location of his child.\n\n\nIn Blair's room at the hospital, Oliver held on to his prisoner, but Ross attempted to escape again, prompting Oliver to use his Taser for the second time. Ross assured Blair that he was fine and merely had scrambled brains, much like hers. Amelia and David arrived looking for Dorian but waited until the police matter was finished.\n\n\nAs soon as Oliver and Ross were gone, Dorian introduced Amelia and Blair. David let it slip that Amelia and Dorian were engaged, causing Blair to call him an idiot. Amelia defended him and admitted that it was true. She and Dorian were getting married. As Dorian began to explain that she needed an edge in order to win the mayoral election, Viki arrived. Dorian concluded her explanation, admitting to her niece that she had realized she was gay and was in love with Amelia.\n\n\nGrinning, Viki disclosed that she was there to visit Blair, but she thought that Amelia and Dorian made a \"lovely couple.\" She extended her congratulations. Dorian stumbled over her words and indicated that it was very difficult for gays to \"come out\" to their family members. She left Viki and Blair alone to visit. Blair told Viki about her memory loss. She knew there was something that was going to have a big impact on Todd, if she could only remember. Viki felt certain that Blair's memory would return.\n\n\nViki ran into Amelia, David, and Dorian as they had a quick strategy meeting in the hospital hallway. Tongue in cheek, Viki assured Dorian that she would perform the wedding ceremony after she won the mayoral election. Dorian responded that Viki would lose. Dorian began to speak of the great passion involved, as she headed into Blair's room. Once inside, she ordered her niece to get better, preferring not to answer Blair's questions about Dorian's sudden change in sexual orientation . Blair's desire was to remember what she had to tell Todd. \"Maybe you'll dream about it,\" Dorian suggested.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at Todd's house to retrieve her belongings, but Todd insisted that he would send them to her. Jack asked T\u00e9a if she had pushed his mom out the window. T\u00e9a responded that while she disliked Blair, she would never do anything to hurt her. The fall had been an accident, she stressed. She added that she loved Jack and would never lie to him. Jack admitted that he believed her and also wanted to know if she would still be his stepmother.\n\n\nT\u00e9a changed the subject and advised the boy to go to bed. Resisting, Jack headed upstairs after Todd gave him the same order. Wondering where they stood, T\u00e9a accused Todd of not making things easy. She told him that he had a habit of not forgiving, of holding onto things, and of not empathizing. She indicated that if things were over between them, there was no reason to tell him anything else. She assured him that her only motive for any of her actions was her desire to protect herself.\n\n\nT\u00e9a marched upstairs, insisting that she would reclaim her possessions herself. Much to her dismay, her briefcase was missing. Frantically, she ran back downstairs and demanded to know where it was. Overhearing, Jack explained that the man hidden in the cabana had shown up at the house to take it. The police had taken the briefcase along with the man.\n\n\nOliver returned Ross to the station and listed the charges pending against him. As Ross hovered with his attorney, he and Elijah tried to devise a plan for getting into T\u00e9a's briefcase. As Oliver began to question Ross, T\u00e9a raced into the police station, looking for her briefcase. She revealed Ross's real last name after Oliver addressed Ross with the fake name he had been given. She added that Ross had a long list of previous charges against him, including kidnapping.\n\n\nElijah jumped up, yelling that T\u00e9a also had a less than perfect past. Ross stopped the lawyer, advising him that Ross was afraid T\u00e9a would change the location of his child again. After indicating that she preferred not to press charges against Ross for the theft of the briefcase, T\u00e9a was permitted to take it with her. Oliver was satisfied that there were plenty of other pending charges against Ross and ordered him to be taken to a cell. Ross reminded Elijah to think about getting into T\u00e9a's briefcase.\n\n\nDelphina explained that she had no idea who would be killed and that her vision showed Nash's death, a clear vision, and then Jared. Just then, Natalie, Jared, and Charlie returned home. \"What's going on here?\" Natalie wanted to know. As Delphina headed to the door, she leaned over to Jared. \"Tell your wife,\" she whispered.\n\n\nCharlie advised Jared that he'd never stopped believing in his son. Charlie headed upstairs. Brody and Jessica thought it was time to check on Bree, and they left Natalie and Jared alone. Brody acknowledged that he didn't believe the psychic, though he joked that \"messages are coming.\"\n\n\nNatalie reminded her husband that he had admitted previously that he had been lying. She wanted him to finish what he had to say. Jared confessed that he had indeed been lying and that he had known Wayne Landers in prison. \"I've been working with him,\" he added.\n\n\nJack confessed to Todd that he was unable to sleep, having repeatedly seen the news footage of his mother falling from the window. Todd assured his son that Blair would be fine. Jack wondered if Todd would end up being with Blair or T\u00e9a. Todd felt that the only thing they needed to concern themselves with was Blair's health and seeing that she was taken care of.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Madame Delphina visits Jessica and tells her and Brody that she keeps having visions of Nash's death followed by images of Jared. She delivers a message from Nash to Brody telling him to look both ways and especially behind him. She says the person who killed Wayne Landers will kill again. Jared is released from police custody because they don't have enough evidence to charge him with murder. When they go home, he admits to Natalie that he lied about Wayne Landers. He tells her he did know him from prison and they were working together. Kim and Stacy encourage Schuyler to go after Gigi.

He tells Stacy that even if Gigi has feelings for him, Rex will never want Stacy and he wants no part of their plan. Rex and Gigi hash it out behind Rodi's.
