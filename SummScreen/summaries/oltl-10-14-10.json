Nora wondered why, and Natalie told Nora that, when she had talked to Greg, Greg had said T\u00e9a's name. Nora wasn't surprised. When Natalie tried to tell her what else Greg had said about T\u00e9a, Bo emerged from his office and informed the women that John had found Starr's car. He asked Natalie to work the scene, and she left. Bo looked at Natalie's computer and wondered why Natalie had been reading the obituary. Nora explained what Natalie had told her, but reasoned that it was probably not be important.\n\n\nLater, Bo and Nora were sharing a meal in Bo's office when Nora handed him some paperwork. They were open warrants for Bo so he could search wherever he wanted to in the county for the missing girls. In exchange, Nora wanted Eli \"in leg irons.\" Nora explained that she prayed T\u00e9a wouldn't sign up to defend Eli, but then she remembered that T\u00e9a was gone. The two raved about T\u00e9a and shared their disbelief that she was dead. They realized how lucky they were and shared a kiss.\n\n\nDani woke up in a warehouse and walked around, visibly upset. She found a door and tried to open it, but Eli stopped her before she could. On the other side of the door, T\u00e9a woke up and wondered what was happening to her. Dani demanded to know where Eli had taken her. Eli explained that they were in an abandoned warehouse with thick walls in a \"forgotten corner\" of the state. He ordered her to sit down, and pushed her into a chair when she wouldn't. He tied her to the chair as Dani threatened that Starr would lead the cops to them.\n\n\nBlair told Todd that her mother had the boys with her in the mountains. Todd said that Blair should be with them, but she refused to go anywhere. In the living room of Todd's house, the FBI had tables set up, tapping the phones in case Eli called. Blair thought that there might be something wrong, since Eli hadn't called yet. Todd hoped Eli was dead. The two went through different scenarios until Todd said that the longer Eli waited to call, the more money he thought he would get. Just then, the phone rang. Everyone put headphones on to listen to the call. Todd answered the phone to Eli.\n\n\nJohn and Theo spotted a car that looked like Starr's and confirmed it by the license plate. Natalie arrived, and the three examined the car. John picked up a bracelet that belonged to Starr just as his phone rang. \"I'm on my way,\" he said into the phone, and explained to Natalie that Eli had finally made contact. John left, and Natalie and Theo continued bagging bloody bandages for evidence. They decided to check the trunk as well.\n\n\nTodd demanded for Eli to put the girls on the phone. Eli told Todd that he wouldn't talk to Starr until Eli could talk to Blair. After arguing with Eli, Todd gave the phone to Blair. As Blair mouthed off at Eli, John entered and warned her to \"be cool.\" On the other end of the line, Eli covered the phone and ordered Dani to tell Blair that she was all right. She did, but she also told them that Starr and Hope had gotten away.\n\n\nEli immediately took the phone away from her and told her that he had warned her. While this was happening, T\u00e9a pushed a chair to a high window. As she attempted to reach the window, she fell off the chair. Dani heard the sound and asked what it was. Eli dragged Dani's chair far away from the door and told her to pay no attention to it. Then, Dani told Blair what Eli had instructed her to say: Starr and Hope were in the next room; she just couldn't see them.\n\n\nTodd got on the phone, and Dani apologized for not believing Todd when he'd said he hadn't killed Ross. Eli got back on the phone and demanded fifty million dollars from Todd if he wanted his girls back. He hung up and the FBI agent told Blair, Todd, and John that they hadn't been able to trace the call. Blair yelled at them and finally asked Todd why Eli wouldn't put Starr on the phone. John reminded Blair that the girls were worth more to Eli if they were alive. He told Blair that he had found Starr's car, and he handed Starr's bracelet to Blair.\n\n\nNatalie and Theo determined that the trunk was too clean. Natalie found a hair and bagged it for evidence. Theo explained to Natalie that he must have just missed Eli at the Cherryvale clinic. They talked about the patient Greg had there, and Natalie informed Theo that Greg had told her that T\u00e9a was alive. The two agreed that something wasn't right and speculated about why Greg would have a patient at Cherryvale. Natalie asked Theo if he thought it could be T\u00e9a. They both thought it was crazy, but left to check it out anyway.\n\n\nAt the Cherryvale clinic, an orderly told Natalie and Theo that the employees weren't supposed to talk to anyone after the incidents of the previous night. Natalie asked about Greg's patient and the orderly informed her that the nurse had quit with no explanation that morning and had taken all of the patient's files with her. The orderly left. As Natalie turned to leave, Theo told her not to do anything stupid.\n\n\nNatalie entered Todd's house and got stares from John, Todd, and Blair. She mumbled that Bo had sent her to get something and went into the living room. Blair tearfully explained the significance of Starr's bracelet. John promised that he would return the girls safe. He reminded Blair of when the drug dealers had kidnapped Starr. She was smart and would know what to do.\n\n\nTodd entered the living room and asked what Natalie was doing carrying the urn with T\u00e9a's ashes.\n\n\nT\u00e9a lay on the floor, praying for help. She got onto her knees and leaned on the bed. She knew she wasn't the most devout person, but prayed to God -- if not for herself, then for Todd and Dani -- to help her find her way home. On the other side of the wall, Dani yelled at Eli to let her see Starr. T\u00e9a was shocked to hear Dani's voice. Eli covered Dani's mouth and ran to T\u00e9a's room. \"Daniela's here. I just heard her voice!\" she said.\n\n\nStarr woke up in a strange room, saying Cole's name. Starr knocked on the locked door in the room, but no one answered. She looked through a box of books and found one with Hannah's name written on the inside. Starr flashed back to the night before and remembered Hannah finding her and Hope in the Cherryvale clinic. Starr gave Hope some food and assured her that they would get home soon.\n\n\nStarr looked around the room and found a window, but it was too high to reach. She remembered more from the night before and knew she shouldn't have trusted Hannah. She remembered that Hannah had said she couldn't find Cole. However, when Starr tried to leave the hospital room, Hannah wouldn't let her leave. Starr had eventually realized that Hannah had never tried to find Cole at all.\n\n\nStarr promised her daughter that everything would be all right. She played with Hope and remembered the night before when Hannah had told Starr that things would be different if Starr weren't in the picture. The two had argued, and Hannah had put a toy frog of Hope's into her purse. As Starr went to exit the hospital room, Hannah had grabbed something and hit Starr over the head. Everything had gone black.\n\n\nCole begged Hannah to tell him what she knew about Starr.  There was a knock on the door, and Cole answered it to Langston and Markko. They wondered if there was any news, but then asked if they were interrupting anything when they spotted Hannah. Hannah told Cole that she thought everything would work out. Hannah went into the kitchen to get everyone drinks and listened to the three talk about how \"creepy\" it was that Hannah was there.\n\n\nHannah reentered the room and told Langston and Markko that she understood why they didn't trust her, but she was glad to have Cole as a friend. Hannah announced that she had to go to an appointment. Cole said he would walk her, since it wasn't safe. Hannah grabbed her purse and a toy frog fell out. When Cole and Hannah were gone, Langston and Markko agreed that they didn't trust Hannah. Just then, Langston found the toy frog on the floor.\n\n\nCole arrived at the police station and asked Bo if there was any news. Bo informed Cole about the ransom demand, and added that Dani said Starr wasn't with her. When Cole asked where Starr was, Bo replied that they didn't know. Cole didn't like the sound of that.\n\n\nStarr put Hope in the crib and promised that she would find a way out. She walked around the room and found a baseball bat. She warned Hope to cover her ears and prepared to swing at the door. Before she could, the door opened and Hannah appeared.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eli has kidnapped Dani and Tea and has them in separate rooms in an old abandoned warehouse whether neither is aware that he has taken the other. He calls Todd and Blair and can confirm that Dani is alive. But he has known how to prevent the cops from tracing the call to know where they are. And Dani tells them that she doesn't know where Starr and Hope are. She assumes that they've escaped. But everybody is worried that they are nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, we see Starr awakening on the floor of an unfamiliar house and baby Hope with her. She hasn't a clue where she is but finds out it's Hannah's parents' home. She then recalls that the last thing she remembered before being knocked out was Hannah coming to find her and preventing her from leaving the hospital with her baby because Hannah resents the fact that people care about Starr and that Starr is with Cole. Hannah returns to Marty's home and neither Marty nor Cole suspect anything about her. Langston and Markko come by and both admit that they do not trust Hannah although they are not aware of what she did to Starr. Starr finds a heavy instrument and is ready to bust her way out of the place and escape. But Hannah appears with a gun to prevent her. Dani is stuck in the place where Eli has taken her. She knows that \"somebody\" is in the other room and assumes it's Starr and Hope. Tea still does not suspect Eli but is still too weak to escape and cannot reach Todd or Dani by phone.",
