T\u00e9a advised Dani that she was at home, but was leaving the house and heading over to the police station. Dani glanced around and ran to the door, but she didn't see any signs of her mother. Dani was confused, but she headed out the door. As she left the house, Nate arrived and held out a brightly decorated gift bag.\n\n\nIt was Dani's birthday, and Nate wanted to give her a gift, even though they were no longer together. Nate was mortified when Dani began to cry. \"That's not the reaction I was looking for,\" Nate declared. He waited helplessly until Dani began to compose herself. They each apologized to the other, but Dani assured Nate that it wasn't his fault.\n\n\nEveryone in Dani's family had forgotten about her birthday with all of the excitement and catastrophes, Dani explained. Her mother had also lied to her that morning about where she was. \"I think she's with my real father, Todd,\" Dani guessed. Dani was scared. Nate assured her that T\u00e9a was the smartest woman he knew, and if she had lied, it had been for a good reason. T\u00e9a had probably wanted to protect Dani.\n\n\nNate had hoped the gift would help Dani feel better for a little while. She opened it up, and she was confused. It was a DVD of the original Manchurian Candidate. Nate recalled how they'd had a disagreement over the remake, because Dani had liked that one so much, and he'd promised to watch the original with her. Awkwardly, Dani announced that she remembered, though it was obvious that she really didn't.\n\n\nDani decided to take a mental health day and skip school. She planned to watch the film that Nate had given her. Nate said goodbye and made his way to the door. Dani stopped him before he left, and she asked him to stick around and watch the movie with her.\n\n\nNate grinned. He hoped she was sure, because he was aware that he wasn't her favorite person. Dani agreed that he wasn't, but she wondered who else would be able to explain why the original film was the better one.\n\n\nTodd asked T\u00e9a why she had lied about her location to Dani, and T\u00e9a shouted that she hadn't wanted to make yet another daughter an accessory to Todd's offenses. \"There's been a development with Jack,\" T\u00e9a added. She informed Todd that Rex had been let go as well. Todd wanted an explanation. \"Basically, Starr caught Jack in a lie,\" T\u00e9a revealed.\n\n\nT\u00e9a explained that Jack had admitted to Starr that he'd really heard the details of Victor's murder via Shaun's description of a voicemail, but then had denied saying that. T\u00e9a noted that Blair had tried to get Jack to tell the truth, without any success. Todd was bitter and assumed that Blair hadn't tried very hard. T\u00e9a assured him that Blair had taken a great risk to hide and protect Todd.\n\n\nT\u00e9a advised Todd not to lose hope, though he admitted that he felt like he was in jail again due to being confined at the cabin.\n\n\nBlair arrived at the police station and demanded to know what Bo was going to do about Shane holding Jack at gunpoint. Bo explained that Shane had merely wanted Jack to confess that he'd killed Gigi, but Shane had actually been the one to confess. Blair was puzzled.\n\n\nBo divulged that Shane had confessed that he'd been the one to hit Jack over the head with a gun the night of the murder, but he would have been too scared to commit a murder. Instead, Shane had been worried, and he had dropped Jack off at the hospital. The police had checked the gun in question, and it had not been the murder weapon.\n\n\n\"That's good news for Todd, right?\" Blair asked. Bo agreed that it was, since it turned out that Todd hadn't been the one to strike Jack. Bo thought it would be even better if Todd weren't a fugitive and hiding someplace that only Todd's trusted friends knew about. \"What are you getting at, Bo?\" Blair inquired.\n\n\nBo assured her that he was merely speculating on Todd's whereabouts. Blair asked what would happen to Tomas and Starr. Bo advised her that Tomas had confessed to Irene's murder, but he was hopeful that Starr could be arraigned quickly. The only problem was that the mayor was behind Starr's imprisonment. Blair was adamant that Starr not be used as bait to entice Todd to turn himself in.\n\n\nBo thought that one of Todd's trusted friends could help both Starr and Tomas. They could convince Todd to turn himself in as the mayor wanted. Bo suggested that Blair use one of the phones in the squad room to call \"anyone about anything.\" Blair stepped away and made a quick call to T\u00e9a on her cell phone instead.\n\n\nT\u00e9a was eager to hear that Rex had been arraigned. \"Not even close,\" Blair admitted. She filled T\u00e9a in and, after the phone call, headed back to Bo's office. Bo informed Blair that Nora would arrange for Starr's arraignment as soon as possible. Blair smiled. She asked what Bo planned to do about Shane and whether there would be any charges against him.\n\n\nBo revealed that there wouldn't be any charges filed against Shane. Blair was angry, and she accused Bo of sticking together with his friends and family members. Bo suggested that Blair think long and hard before she decided to press charges against Shane. Jack would also have charges pressed against him for making false statements and obstructing justice. \"Is that what you want?\" Bo asked.\n\n\nJack should forget about Shane and recant his statement about Todd, Bo suggested. It would all be attributed to the fact that the teen had been confused after getting hit on the head. He'd made a mistake. Bo declared that there would be no consequences, and he thought that Blair would want to protect her son. He understood that more than Blair knew, Bo said as he looked down at an old photo of his son, Drew.\n\n\nTodd wanted an update as soon as T\u00e9a got off the phone. She told him that Shane had pointed a gun at Jack. Todd was crazed to hear that, and he asked if the gun had been the murder weapon. T\u00e9a advised him that ballistics had checked the gun and cleared both Shane and Rex. The gun had not been used in the murder. The good news was that Shane had admitted to attacking Jack the night of the murder, and the police no longer believed Jack's story.\n\n\nTodd wondered if the charges against him had been dropped, but T\u00e9a pointed out that there was no murder weapon, and Todd had had a motive. He was also a fugitive. T\u00e9a added that the mayor had been pursuing a maximum charge against Starr unless Todd turned himself in. Todd was ready to go, but T\u00e9a wanted some guarantees first.\n\n\nTodd was appreciative of T\u00e9a's help, but she made it clear that she was helping Victor and not Todd. She refused to let Todd leave and be railroaded. They needed to find the real killer, and T\u00e9a apologized to Victor for not having located the one who had killed him. Todd promised that he was there for T\u00e9a, and he would stay at the cabin. She left for the police station.\n\n\nAfter T\u00e9a was gone, Todd picked up a photo that he found on the floor. It was a picture of T\u00e9a and Victor. Todd felt that Victor was torturing them, and he wondered who had killed his brother. Todd thought that because they'd been twins, he should have had some kind of connection to his brother.\n\n\nEcho had a tray full of pumpkin muffins and coffee for Rex. She admitted that she'd baked them herself in order to make up for doubting him. She couldn't believe that she and Roxy had messed things up. Rex was only grateful that his mothers had tried to protect him. He wondered why the women hadn't just gotten rid of the gun in question.\n\n\n\"It's complicated,\" Echo replied. \"Okay, try me,\" Rex persisted. Echo sighed. It was a long story, but she guessed she should start at the beginning. Before she could say anything, Shane interrupted them. He was upset that he'd overslept, but Rex assured his son that he could skip school for the day. Rex asked Echo to give him and Shane some privacy so that he could talk to his son.\n\n\nRex was aware that Shane had been upset and scared, and he'd had lots of rage. There was no need for Shane to apologize for what he'd done. Shane had been in possession of the gun and he'd been alone, but Rex wished that Shane could have talked to him. Shane acknowledged that everything had been crazy, but he hadn't been able to talk to his father about it. He'd believed that Rex had been the one who had killed Victor.\n\n\nShane explained that he'd known that Jack was lying about Todd hitting him over the head, so Shane was aware that someone else had committed the murder. Shane had put the gun away and gone to bed, but then later, he'd seen Rex return home, all muddy and wet. He'd thought that Rex had been lying when he had stated that he'd been to Gigi's grave.\n\n\nFurthermore, Rex had always talked about getting even with Victor and Jack, Shane added. Shane hadn't been able to go through with killing anyone, and he had assumed that Rex had murdered Victor. He apologized to his father, and Rex hugged him. Rex recognized that they'd been distant ever since Gigi's death.\n\n\nRex was aware that he'd been consumed with revenge, but he assured his son that they would have each other's backs. Shane wondered if he were going to get into trouble for what he'd done to Jack. \"We'll face it together,\" Rex promised. He would also listen to Shane without judgment whenever Shane wanted to talk.\n\n\nRex knew he couldn't fix everything, though, and he admitted that he had been chasing a ghost. That would have to stop, too, he said as he looked down at the caf\u00e9 check where the waitress had written \"Don't Give Up.\" Rex was determined that he and Shane wouldn't give up on each other. He was certain that was what Gigi had meant. They would never forget Gigi, but they had to let her go.\n\n\nIn Anchorage, Kentucky, Kim talked to a comatose Stacy and explained that she'd had to give the signed papers to Cutter. Kim was sorry, because she had wanted to see Clint's expression when he received the papers, all tied with a bow, that returned all of his belongings to him. Somehow, her brother always got what he wanted, Kim proclaimed. She and Stacy would still receive half of the money for Stacy's hospital bills though.\n\n\nNear the hospital, Cutter was astonished when he found Rama at the Spotted Pony. Rama demanded to know where the real Aubrey was. Cutter replied that he hadn't seen her in years, but Rama knew otherwise. She had received the truth from the fake Aubrey, Rama revealed. Rama wanted the money that Aubrey had stolen from her, and she threatened to go to the Anchorage police if Cutter didn't speak up.\n\n\nRama flashed back to the past incident in the Spotted Pony. She recalled trying to track down Aubrey in order to get her money, when she'd seen Cutter leaning over a dead body. She wondered if Cutter had changed his mind and remembered where Aubrey might be. \"Maybe I do know where Kim is,\" Cutter replied. He couldn't tell Rama, though, and he couldn't help out.\n\n\nRama reminded him that she had proof from the night of Cutter's crime, and she thought he should reconsider. Cutter accused Rama of bluffing, because she'd threatened him in the past. She'd never called the police, and she never would. Another flashback revealed that Cutter had stopped Rama from calling the police in the past.\n\n\nOn the night of the crime, Cutter had mentioned that the idea of being found in a bar with a dead body wouldn't go over well with Rama's fianc\u00e9 and future in-laws. Rama had agreed, but she'd taken a picture with her cell phone and run off. She still had the photo, and this time she would go to the police. Her family would applaud her for doing the right thing, and the police would be happy to have the murder solved.\n\n\nCutter was adamant that Kim was broke, and she couldn't very well redo all of her plastic surgery. He grabbed Rama, and she cried out. The bartender wondered if she were okay, and Rama assured him that she was. Cutter advised Rama that she couldn't threaten him forever. \"Whatcha gonna do, kill me?\" Rama wondered. Cutter assured her that he wouldn't kill her. He had another plan, and it was one that would solve many problems.\n\n\nKim hoped that Cutter would do the right thing, though she knew she had reason to doubt him. He'd gotten her in trouble before. Kim was aware that Stacy had doubts about Cutter too. Kim flashed back to her previous life as a grifter. Cutter would drug the men in the Spotted Pony, while Kim cozied up to them. Then they would rob the men.\n\n\nOne night, a man had died because Cutter had put too much of the drug in the man's drink. Kim admitted that she had trusted Cutter \"within reason,\" but she'd had no choice. She had needed to go along with him. Suddenly, she briefly expressed doubt that it was actually Stacy lying in the bed, and she wondered if it might really be Gigi. Kim shook it off. She was certain it was Stacy.\n\n\nKim received a phone call. It was Echo, and she was calling about the document. Echo wanted it returned. Kim reminded her that they'd had an agreement, but Echo informed her that Rex's gun had not been the murder weapon. \"The deal is off,\" Echo pronounced.  \"Buyer beware,\" Kim stated. They'd had a deal.\n\n\nEcho informed Kim that Rex was innocent of Victor's murder, and Echo vowed to track Kim down and take the papers forcefully. Kim was happy to reveal that she no longer had the papers, and that she'd given them to someone else. She wasn't scared of Echo either. Kim abruptly ended the call.\n\n\nKim turned to Stacy and admitted that Stacy had been right. Rex hadn't killed anyone. Kim swore that Stacy would be finished with Rex once Stacy was up and about. Kim was thrilled that she and Stacy would be on \"Easy Street\" soon enough.\n\n\nEcho phoned Roxy and advised her that someone else had possession of the documents, but she didn't know who it was.\n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at the police station. She advised Bo that Todd was ready to turn himself in, but she wanted something in return.\n\n\nKim went to the Spotted Pony and saw Rama. \"Is that really you, Aubrey?\" Rama inquired. \"I'm here to settle an old score,\" Rama asserted.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the unconscious patient wiggled her toes and opened her eyes.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After finding out, for the first time, that Shane knocked out Jack and either he or Rex could have killed him, Tea and Blair both hope the cops have exonerated Todd for the murder but Bo tells them there is still have no other suspect. Echo then remembers she has not yet told Rex she had to sign away everything back to Clint for Kim in exchange for the gun. She now realizes that Rex's gun was not used to kill Victor in the first place and she and Roxy have falsely assumed he did it. Kim no longer has a valid claim to get Rex to sign over Clint's money, yet she realizes it's too late since she's already signed it away by forging Rex's signature. At the private hospital, Cutter reminds Kim that he knows she may be responsible for the death of Gigi, so he is able to prevent her from giving Clint back his money. Rama finds Cutter and reminds him she knows he's responsible for killing a customer along with Kim years ago at the Spotted Pony. She threatens to go to the police if he does not tell her where to find his sister. The \"new\" Stacy opens her eyes in the hospital bed.",
