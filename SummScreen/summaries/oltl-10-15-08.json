Cris had been dreaming of Sarah, so he was surprised when he opened his eyes and found Vanessa hovering over him. Cris pulled away and asked Vanessa why she had awakened him. Vanessa explained that the storm had passed. She was eager to move on before Ray caught up with them. Vanessa was convinced that Ray would kill them because he had vowed to during his trial. Before she went to wake Lola, Vanessa thanked Cris for helping them. Once Vanessa was gone, Cris went to test the phones. He was furious when he realized that the phones worked. \n\n\nTalia woke up to find Antonio looking out of his apartment window, sipping on a cup of coffee. Concerned, she asked him if he was okay. Antonio told Talia that he couldn't sleep. When he closed his eyes, he had visions of Cris being tortured by Carlo. Talia wondered if Antonio blamed her for her father's actions. \n\n\nA knock at the door heralded Sarah's arrival. Sarah was distraught after she had a dream of finding Cris dead. Talia reassured her friend that Cris would return home safe and sound. Antonio went to shower while the girls headed to the kitchen and prepared breakfast. When Sarah's cell phone rang, Sarah checked the caller ID. She grumbled when she saw that it was an unknown caller and started to put the phone away. Luckily, Talia insisted that Sarah answer the call. It was Cris. The connection was weak and heavy with static but, before the call was disconnected, Cris was able to let Sarah know that he was in Colombia. \n\n\nVanessa walked into the room and found Cris on the phone. She accused Cris of breaking their agreement. Cris countered, claiming that Vanessa had lied to him about the phones being out of order. Vanessa defended herself. She told him that when she had tried to use the phones earlier, they had not been working; obviously they had been repaired. Vanessa then asked Cris whom he had called. Cris told her that he had talked to Sarah briefly, but he wasn't certain that she had heard him when he had told her that he was in Colombia. Vanessa seemed nervous and reminded Cris that no one could know that she was in Colombia. Vanessa worried that Ray would track her down if he knew that they were in the country. \n\n\nBack in Llanview, Antonio made arrangements to head to Colombia to search for his brother. \n\n\nRay Montez showed up at the Buchanan mansion to talk to Clint. Ray was angry that he had been forced to spend the night in jail. Clint wasn't very sympathetic as he apologized for inconveniencing Ray. Ray didn't seem interested in hearing Clint's excuses. He demanded to be paid, per their agreement, so that he could return to Colombia and attend to pressing personal business. Clint informed Ray that there had been a change of plans. Dorian had not taken the bait, and refused to sign over the company in exchange for Langston. As a result, it appeared that Ray would have to leave with Langston. \n\n\nRay was livid at the news but Clint quickly calmed him. He reminded Ray that Dorian loved Langston and would not allow Ray to leave town with the young girl. Clint was certain that Dorian would relent and give in to Clint's demands at the last moment. Ray wasn't convinced, but seemed to have little choice but to go along with Clint. Nora walked in as Clint and Ray finalized their plans. Ray left to inform Dorian that he intended to leave town later that evening, with Langston. \n\n\nNora was disgusted by the partnership between Clint and Ray. As soon as Ray left, Nora turned on Clint and demanded to know if he wanted to live his life as he had been in recent months. Clint was unrepentant and accused Nora of being jealous. He claimed that she was angry because she had found Dallas on the sofa, wearing Clint's bathrobe. Nora was momentarily speechless. She defended herself, insisting that her concern over Clint's behavior stemmed from the responsibility of having two minors in her charge: Matthew and Cole. \n\n\nThe argument escalated and both admitted that they were tired of the constant fighting. Clint said that he owed it to Asa to restore the company to the family. He truly believed that Dorian was bluffing and wouldn't let Langston leave with Ray. Nora felt that Clint couldn't guarantee Langston's safety and admitted that she could no longer deal with what Clint was doing. She asked Clint why they bothered to pretend that they were still together. \n\n\nMarkko walked into Dorian's living room and asked her what she had planned to keep Ray from taking Langston to Colombia. Dorian was evasive about her plans but she reassured Markko that she had a team of lawyers working to keep Langston in Llanview. As the two talked about Langston, they buried the last of their animosity. Each seemed to recognize how much the other loved Langston. Langston walked in and was pleased by the scene that greeted her. She was happy that Dorian and Markko had reached an accord. \n\n\nRay's arrival brought the warm moment to an end. He informed Langston that he intended to return to Colombia that very evening. He gave Langston a few hours to pack and then left. Dorian was clearly rattled. While the teens shared a touching goodbye, Dorian took the cordless phone and walked out to the patio. She called Jackie and reminded him of their agreement, and then instructed him to complete their business transaction by the end of the evening. \n\n\nGigi was frustrated when she failed to get an update on Rex's condition from the hospital. As she tried to focus on putting her laundry away, Shane came downstairs and announced that he wanted to visit his father. Gigi was touched that Shane wanted to see Rex. Shane corrected his mother; he had been referring to Brody. Gigi explained that Brody had been sent to a psychiatric facility for an evaluation, in part because of his experiences in Iraq. Shane understood and asked if he could write Brody a letter. Gigi told Shane that he could but she couldn't say for certain that Brody would be able to read it immediately. \n\n\nEventually, Shane asked about Rex. He wanted to know if Rex knew that Shane had been told the truth about Rex being his father before he had lapsed into a coma. Gigi had to tell Shane that there hadn't been time to tell Rex. As they talked, Gigi was struck by an idea. She realized that as Rex's son, Shane was a family member and therefore could visit Rex. She turned to Shane and asked her son if he wanted to visit Rex. Shane seemed hesitant to agree, but Gigi pointed out that she didn't want Shane to have any regrets if the worst happened and Rex died. However, Gigi said, if Shane didn't want to spend time with Rex, she would not pressure him. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Adriana sat at Rex's bedside and promised to stay with him until he opened his eyes. She vowed that she would not give up on Rex. \n\n\nIn the hallway, Roxy walked up with a tray of coffee and found Bo standing outside of Rex's room. Roxy was annoyed that Adriana had swept back into Rex's life and taken over. Adriana walked up during Roxy's tirade. Roxy handed Adriana a coffee and the bickering continued. Bo distracted the ladies by asking Adriana if Rex had made any provisions for a situation like the one that he was in. Would Rex want to remain on artificial life support indefinitely? Adriana admitted that they had intended to see a lawyer after their honeymoon but that they had never gotten around to it. \n\n\nRoxy said that if Rex had put Roxy in charge, then Gigi would be permitted to visit her son. Adriana didn't appreciate Roxy bringing up Gigi's name. The argument became heated when Adriana cut Roxy off and insisted that she, Adriana, was Rex's family, not Gigi and not Shane. Bo decided to share his opinion on the matter. He reminded Adriana that Rex had asked her for a divorce, told Gigi that he loved her and wanted to raise his son, Shane, with Gigi. Adriana was furious and refused to consider allowing Gigi to visit. Roxy was equally angry and threatened to hire an attorney so that she could have a say in Rex's treatment. \n\n\nAfter Roxy walked off, Bo made another attempt to talk to Adriana but she was too defensive. Bo was taken aback when Adriana said that she had permitted Bo and Roxy to see Rex, implying that she didn't have to. Bo told Adriana that she was Rex's wife, not his jailor. He then pointed out that they stood in the Buchanan wing of the hospital and he could pull strings that would allow Gigi to visit with Rex regardless of Adriana's wishes. \n\n\nLater, as Adriana looked into Rex's room, she began to cry. A few minutes later, Gigi and Shane walked up. Gigi cut Adriana off and told her that Shane was Rex's son and therefore family. Since Gigi was Shane's legal guardian, she had a right to go into Rex's room with Shane. Before Gigi could follow through with her threat, Adriana informed Gigi that she was too late, \"he's gone.\" \n\n\n",
