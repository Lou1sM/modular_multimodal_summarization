    "soap_central": "\n Say It Ain't So, Bo \n\n\nVisiting Greg in his Palace Hotel residence, Rachel thanked him profusely for agreeing to observe during Matthew's surgery in Seattle. Greg reminded her that there were no guarantees and that the outcome of the surgery might be worse than what Matthew had already endured. Matthew might even die. He asked if Rachel was prepared for that.\n\n\nRachel wondered how someone could prepare for death but admitted that she was most concerned about Bo, since he had already lost one son. She thought that Matthew understood the risks involved, feeling as though her brother had become much wiser since the day of the accident. Greg declared that he kept his heart and feelings out of his surgeries because it was much easier that way. Rachel asked how it was working for him.\n\n\nRachel explained that it was impossible not to get involved and ignore one's feelings. She stated that the further one tried to suppress their feelings, the stronger the feelings would become. \"Is that how it is for you?\" Greg asked, as he drew closer. As the words took on a different meaning and a moment of awkwardness overcame the couple, Rachel snapped out of it and announced that she needed to call her mother.\n\n\nMatthew, Bo, and Nora were waiting for takeoff to Seattle aboard the family's private jet. They agreed that there were no hard feelings following their dispute over Matthew's surgery. Bo advised his son that he would hold him to that declaration. The pilot announced that the flight would take approximately seven hours, advising a perplexed Matthew that it was due to lots of headwinds they would be encountering. Nora urged her son to take a nap. Just then, Destiny arrived with a gift for Matthew, a new pair of sneakers. She advised him that they were for his first steps after the surgery. She promised to be there to see his first jump shot.\n\n\nLeaving the teens alone, Nora broke down. She wasn't sure she'd be able to handle things, she advised Bo, but she thanked him for being brave. He responded that he had no plans of looking back. They made their way back to Matthew and Destiny.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody asked Jessica to move in with him, since there was a killer around, and Jessica was the presumed target. Jessica found it unnecessary, pointing out that she had a daughter and needed to stay at home to love and support her family. Brody vowed to keep Jessica in his sight at all times until the case was solved and Jared was cleared. Jessica defended Jared as Brody looked at her doubtfully.\n\n\nBrody reiterated that there was a killer around, and Jessica was in danger. He shot down her argument that her father had ordered more security around Llanfair. He reminded her that both the killer and stalker had gotten on and off the grounds and past security, and he suggested that perhaps it was an inside job. He pleaded with Jessica to allow him to take care of her. Relenting, Jessica pointed to her suitcase in the closet. She needed to pack.\n\n\nBrody grabbed the suitcase and noted that it was heavy. Jessica gasped as the suitcase was opened. It was packed with clothing that had belonged to Tess and Bess. A panic-stricken Jessica related that she had donated all of those clothes to a clothing drive at St. Ann's, but she was worried that Tess or Bess had returned. Brody reassured her that she was fully integrated and reminded her that he had been with her constantly. He also felt that he would have noticed the signs. It was his opinion that someone had planted the clothing to frame her. He called John and asked that the detective get to Llanfair as soon as he could.\n\n\nNatalie was stunned to hear Jared admit to lying about his relationship with Wayne Landers. \"Were you behind all of this?\" she asked her husband. She promised to \"have [his] back\" as he replied that he didn't want to lose her. She assured him he wouldn't, but she wanted answers. He told her it was complicated but said nothing more as Natalie continued to clobber him with questions.\n\n\nJared finally admitted that he had told Landers to beat him up and had given him a security pass to get in and out of Buchanan Enterprises. Natalie asked if he had killed Landers, also. As he remained speechless, Jared received a text message. \"Don't talk,\" it said. As he advised Natalie that it was a wrong number, the phone went off again.\n\n\nNatalie attempted to grab the phone out of Jared's hand but was unsuccessful. \"Buchanan Lodge now,\" the text read. Jared advised his wife that he had to leave. An insistent Natalie wanted to go with him, but he told her it was dangerous, and she needed to stay home. He promised to explain later.\n\n\nMarty and John enjoyed a meal at Rodi's, though John was extremely quiet. After Marty did her best to get him to talk, he finally acknowledged that he was preoccupied with work. He admitted that he believed that Jared had been lying since \"day one,\" but played down Marty's praises of his detective skills. He felt that his personal feelings often got in the way.\n\n\nJohn felt that a red flag was raised when things were personal, and he insisted that he wasn't always right. Marty noted that John had been right about her and had saved her. John revealed that he suspected someone else was in charge of the situation involving Jared. After receiving a phone call, John disclosed that Brody had summoned him to Llanfair.\n\n\nRachel called Nora with the good news that Greg was willing to sit in on Matthew's surgery. A speechless Nora was less than thrilled with the news. She advised her daughter that they were already in the jet and ready to leave momentarily. She apologized that there was no time for Rachel to get to the plane before takeoff, but said she would explain later. She asked Rachel to trust her. Rachel was floored, due to both her mother's disappointing reaction and the fact that the family was leaving without her. The scheduled departure time had originally been set for later in the day.\n\n\nRachel sadly told Greg that their presence wasn't required. She was confused and figured it was because she was the \"family screw-up,\" no matter what she did to try to change her past. Declaring that Rachel was not about what she did in the past but what she did in the present, Greg advised her to look at the good in herself. She was a beautiful person inside and out, he added, and he wished that she could see herself the way he saw her. He felt that he had let her down and that he should have kept himself together. Rachel saw him as being brave and added that no one blamed him for Shaun's surgery except himself. She felt that he should see himself the way she saw him. They looked at each other and began to kiss.\n\n\nHearing yelling, Brody and Jessica ran downstairs and found Natalie alone. Brody inquired as to whether Natalie thought Jared would know something about the clothes packed away in Jessica's closet. Natalie was sure that Jared was not involved in securing the clothes from St. Ann's and repacking them, as he hardly had any time to do all of that. John arrived, and Brody revealed the contents of the suitcase to him. \"What's going on, Natalie?\" John inquired. She began to cry. He wondered where Jared might be, but Natalie retorted that she was not going to fight with John.\n\n\n\"I love Jared,\" Natalie said softly. John asked her to allow him to help Jared and her. Natalie divulged that Jared had confessed.\n\n\nDestiny made her way to Shaun's hospital room and read out loud to him. She told him about the gift she had given to Matthew and how Nora had looked like she'd wanted to cry. She admitted that she couldn't see a life for herself in the future if Mathew was gone. Finally, she begged her brother to return and help her.\n\n\nConfiding to her unconscious brother that she should have told Matthew how she felt about him, Destiny mentioned how much Rachel cared for Shaun. \"Des,\" Shaun muttered weakly. An ecstatic Destiny was thrilled to see her brother awaken.\n\n\nBo was curious about Rachel's call, and Nora advised him that her daughter had persuaded Greg to be in on Matthew's surgery. Sarcastically, she berated herself for lacking Rachel's skills at persuasion. She felt that Greg was emotionally unstable, anyway, and wouldn't be able to do anything in the operating room. Bo assured her that the right decision had been made. Matthew, pulling ear buds out of his ears, wanted to know what was going on. He had a list of people who needed to be called after his surgery.\n\n\nBo advised his son that they were not flying to Seattle. Matthew was puzzled, reminding his parents that his surgery was scheduled for first thing in the morning. \"No, it's not,\" Bo replied.\n\n\nLetting himself into the Buchanan lodge, Jared turned and looked at someone, startled. \"You?\" he asked.\n\n\n",

Bo and Nora are outwardly supportive of their son by are secretly terribly worried. Rachel then calls to inform them that she and Greg will accompany them as Greg has agreed to stand in with the other doctor. Hearing that, Nora panics and won't let them come with her and Bo and Matthew. At that point, Bo announces that they have to cancel their flight to Seattle. All the evidence in the murder investigation and the stalking at B.E. points to Jared. Brody and John are convinced that he is involved. And he's made it clear to Natalie that he has been lying about many things.",
