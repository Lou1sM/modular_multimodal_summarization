    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, Cole told Marty that he feared for Starr and Hope's safety, because Eli had contacted Todd for ransom.  Marty insisted that Cole return home for rest, but Cole refused.  Marty stressed that nobody could have predicted what Eli would do, which was why everyone had thought that Eli would \"go after Hannah.\"  Cole related to his mother that \"ever since Starr and Hope went missing, Hannah has been great.\"  Cole declared that once Starr returned home, he would do everything he could to fix things with Starr.  Marty wished that there were some way that she could help Cole, but then she had an idea.\n\n\nAt the Manning Estate, as the evidence technician monitored the phone calls, Todd discovered Natalie with T\u00e9a's urn and screamed that T\u00e9a only wanted to rest in peace.  Natalie exclaimed that T\u00e9a was not resting in peace, and Blair agreed that T\u00e9a would be unable to rest in peace with Dani missing.  Todd grabbed the urn from Natalie and ran up the stairs.\n\n\nBlair apologized to Natalie and explained that Todd was afraid that he would lose Dani.  John walked up to them and declared that they would not be losing anyone.  After Blair left to check on Todd, John confronted Natalie and inquired about what she had really been doing.\n\n\nLater, Blair reminded Todd that Eli had wanted the 50 million dollars in ransom, therefore, Eli would have to return Dani, Starr, and Hope safely.  John demanded that Todd not attempt to handle Eli, but Todd revealed that he would give Eli anything, even if it meant that Todd ended up being \"broke and homeless.\"\n\n\nJohn maintained that Todd should not take any action until the Federal Bureau of Investigation had instructed Todd on how to handle the ransom drop-off.  Blair insisted that she would make sure of that.  John told Blair and Todd that he would be in touch.  John then escorted Natalie, who walked down the stairs, out of the mansion.  Outside, Natalie revealed that she had been trying to find evidence that would prove that T\u00e9a was alive.\n\n\nMarty and Cole arrived at the mansion, and Cole announced that Eli had not confirmed that Starr and Hope had been with him.  Cole requested that he and his mother wait with Blair and Todd until they heard.  Todd announced that he would give John just \"one more opportunity to find my girls, and then all bets are off.\"  Cole offered to sell his car and to cash in his bonds to help with the ransom, and Todd joked and asked if Cole would rob his piggy bank too.  The phone rang, and the evidence technician monitored it.\n\n\nMarty and Blair agreed that they had all been Eli's victims.  Blair related that she and T\u00e9a had been mortal enemies, until Blair had discovered that T\u00e9a had been dying.  Blair sadly laughed that T\u00e9a and Blair had become friends, after Blair had learned of T\u00e9a's diagnosis.  Marty believed that even though Blair and Marty could bond over their mutual granddaughter's kidnapping, they would never be friends.\n\n\nThe evidence technician indicated that he could hear no background noise during Eli's call.  Cole yelled, \"Then try it again.  There's no way we're gonna let Starr down.\"\n\n\nNatalie and John returned to the police station, and Natalie updated John on Greg's female patient at the Cherryville Clinic.  John remembered that Todd had stated that he had received a phone call from an unknown number, and Todd had claimed that \"it was T\u00e9a's voice on the phone.  He thought that he was going crazy.\"  Natalie simply stated, \"Maybe not.\"\n\n\nNatalie pondered why Greg had told everyone that T\u00e9a was dead, if T\u00e9a was still alive.  An officer handed records from the St. Kitts hospice to John, and John stated that the records revealed that Greg had personally transported T\u00e9a's body to the crematorium.  John realized that Greg had taken advantage of T\u00e9a's weakened condition, yet Natalie wondered how Eli had manipulated Greg into doing that.\n\n\nJohn told Natalie that a team would do \"a full sweep\" of the room at Cherryville.  Natalie revealed that she had evidence in her purse, which she had swiped from John's \"FBI buddies,\" and that she hoped to find at least one bone fragment to test.  When John questioned what Natalie would use to test against, Natalie yanked out a bag of items taken from T\u00e9a's bathroom.  Natalie announced, \"I dropped the ashes and hair samples off at the lab for analysis.\"  John speculated, \"If they confirm what we suspect, those remains aren't T\u00e9a's.\"  Natalie guessed, \"And she's alive.\"  Then John pondered, \"The question is...where is she now?\"\n\n\nStarr was attempting to break down the door of the room, where she was held captive, just as Hannah opened it.  Starr insisted that she had to leave, or that she would \"take the bat and split your head open.\"  Hannah quietly said, \"I don't think so\" and pointed a gun at Starr.\n\n\nAfter Starr asked where Hannah had retrieved the gun, Hannah revealed that it had belonged to her father.  Starr then realized that they were in Hannah's parents' house.  Hannah claimed that the room was where she had stayed, while her parents had ignored her, and that her parents were touring Europe.  When Starr told Hannah that she was sorry, Hannah stated, \"Well, you should be, because right now, they're not back.  It's only me, you, your little girl, and I have no intention of being ignored anymore.\"\n\n\nHannah declared that once Hope and Starr were \"out of the way,\" Hannah could make things happen with Cole.  When Starr expressed shock, Hannah explained that she would be available to help Cole with his grief.  \"And I'll be there for him.  A shoulder to cry on, a hand to hold, when the pain gets to be too much.  And eventually, a warm bed, so he can move on.\"\n\n\nStarr claimed that Cole, Marty, and John would continue to search for Starr and Hope, but Hannah reminded Starr that everyone thought that Starr and Hope were with Eli.  Starr maintained that Cole would never stop looking for her, but Hannah said that Cole had a connection with Hannah, just as Starr had a connection with James.  Starr insisted that Cole only had a connection with Hannah due to her lies, and that Hannah had manipulated Cole and Starr's relationship, which had caused a connection between Starr and James.\n\n\nHannah jerked James's bullet necklace off of Starr's neck and cried that the necklace proved that Starr and James still had a connection.  Hannah demanded that Starr should stop pretending, and she then claimed that Starr could not stay away from James, even if she tried.  When Hannah asked Starr why she continued to deny it, Starr agreed that the truth was that she loved James.\n\n\nStarr maintained that she could no longer hurt Cole, and that she realized that Cole belonged to Hannah.  When Starr insisted that she would break up with Cole, Hannah revealed that she still could not let Starr leave, as she continued to point the gun at Starr.  However, Starr believed that Hannah could not shoot Starr or Hope.  Hannah agreed with Starr but then said that she would not have to, because she could just leave them locked in the room.  When Starr asked for how long, Hannah replied, \"Just long enough for Cole to forget about you and fall in love with me.\"  Hannah flew out the door.\n\n\nAfter Hannah left, Starr cried to Hope, \"Don't worry, Hope.  I know Hannah was wrong when she said no one would find us.  There are too many people who care about us.  Someone will find us.  Someone will find us.\"\n\n\nAt Starr's apartment, Langston showed Markko Hope's frog, as they heard a knock on the door.  James asked to see Cole and stated that Cole had blamed him for what had happened to Starr and Hope.  However, James wanted to remind Cole that he and Cole were on the same side.  James wanted to ask for Cole's help, so that they could both find Starr, Hope, and Dani.\n\n\nJames told Langston and Markko that he and Cole had a vested interest in the girls' safe return home, when Markko's phone rang.  Markko announced that he had to leave to pick up his dad's prescription drugs.  Langston and Markko hugged goodbye.  Once Markko left, Langston voiced to James, \"You're trying to look the hero to Starr.  That way, when she gets home, she'll choose you over Cole.\"  However, James claimed that he \"just wanted Starr back, safe and sound.\"\n\n\nJames asked if Langston, as Starr's best friend, believed that Starr was happy. Langston insisted that Starr loved Cole.  James reminded Langston that she knew how it felt to care about two people at the same time.  He then wondered why Bobby and Langston had not gotten back together.  Langston evaded the issue and claimed that when Starr returned home, she would not need any more complications.  James insisted that he cared too much about Starr to hurt her.\n\n\nJames then requested that Langston tell Cole that he had stopped by.  As James left the apartment, he ran into Hannah, and the bullet necklace flew out of her purse.  James exclaimed, \"What are you doing with this?\"\n\n\nIn the hospital, Destiny told her parents that Greg had opened his eyes, so she believed that he had to be better.  After Mrs. Evans sent Destiny to get something to eat, she told her husband that Greg would do anything to protect Shaun and Destiny.  Mr. Evans then wondered how Eli Clarke had found out what they had done.\n\n\nMrs. Evans believed that the secret was no longer worth keeping and said, \"I think it's time we got everything out in the open.\"  Mr. Evans was uncertain, because he feared what the secret would do to Shaun.  However, Mrs. Evans felt that Destiny deserved to learn the truth, just as Destiny reentered the room.  Destiny asked, \"The truth about what?\"\n\n\nMr. Evans covered and said that Greg's condition was very serious, which caused Destiny to fear that Greg would die.  Destiny cried that Greg was always a superhero to her and balled, \"And superheroes don't die.\"  Mrs. Evans tried to comfort Destiny, but Destiny ran and threw her arms around Greg.  \"He can't leave me.  He can't leave me.\"\n\n\nMrs. Evans reminded Destiny that no one had said that Greg would die.  Destiny admitted that since it was almost her birthday, Greg would not want to miss it.  Mrs. Evans believed that Destiny's birthday would give Greg the will to live.  Destiny hoped that Greg would regain that will, since he had lost it when T\u00e9a had died \"on his watch.\"\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a was held captive in a locked room, she told Eli that she had heard Dani's voice, and that Dani had called out for Starr.  Eli claimed that T\u00e9a was confused, because she missed her daughter.  T\u00e9a thanked Eli for removing her from the hospital but then wondered where they were.  T\u00e9a questioned why Eli had stated that Todd had shot Eli.\n\n\nT\u00e9a remembered that she had been in a hospice in the Caribbean, because she had learned that she would die.  She then reflected that Greg had informed her that she would not die, while she was in the Cherryville Clinic.  T\u00e9a wondered why the staff at the clinic had not let her use the phone.  Eli remarked that Greg had not done what he was supposed to do.  When T\u00e9a questioned what that was, Eli stated, \"Kill you.\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a insisted that she was not dying and claimed that she just wanted \"to get to her daughter.\"  At the same time, Dani struggled in the next room, as she tried to free herself from the ropes that tied her to the chair.  T\u00e9a begged Eli for a phone, so that she could call Dani and Todd, because she wanted to let them know where she was.  Eli responded, \"Sorry, T\u00e9a.  I'm afraid you're not going anywhere.\"  T\u00e9a asked, \"Why not?\"  Eli replied, \"Because you're a dead woman.\"\n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a pointed out that she was still alive, Eli reminded her that everyone else believed that she had died months before.  After T\u00e9a cried and asked why Eli had stated that Greg was supposed to have killed her, Eli claimed that her death had been the plan, and that Greg had given T\u00e9a the diagnosis that Eli had wanted.  \"T\u00e9a, I thought that you were smarter than that.  There was never any brain tumor in there.  You don't get it.  You were never sick at all.\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a still claimed that she had been getting sicker by the day, and that Greg had been giving her treatments.  Eli revealed that Greg's treatments had actually been making her sicker.  T\u00e9a then realized that Eli had blackmailed Greg and asked Eli why.  \"Financial independence.  Your death was supposed to secure that for me, but everything happens for a reason.  It's turned out just fine, because you may be more valuable to me alive.\"\n\n\nAfter Eli revealed that the only ones who knew that T\u00e9a had not died were T\u00e9a, Eli, and Greg, T\u00e9a begged Eli to let her see her family.  Eli gave an evil laugh and pulled T\u00e9a away from the door.\n\n\nAfter Eli left the room, he laughed at Dani in the adjoining room and jeered, \"I'll be back.  I've always wanted to say that.\"  Once Eli was gone, Dani escaped from her bindings and ran to the door of the next room in an attempt to rescue Starr.  Dani yelled out, \"Okay, okay, Starr.  I'm going to try something that I learned from Ross.  God, my mom would kill me, if she knew I know how to break into places.\"\n\n\nDestiny left Greg's room to call Darren with an update on Greg's condition.  Mr. Evans escorted his wife out of the room, as a mysterious, masked hospital attendant glanced at a file.  The police officer who guarded Greg's room received a phone call and remarked, \"That guy's not going anywhere.\"  After the officer left to take the call, the mysterious attendant entered the room and pulled down his mask.  Eli glared down at Greg in his hospital bed.\n\n\nDani found a hook and a steel bar and pounded on the door to supposedly help Starr.  \"One...Two...Three,\" and the door sprung open.  Dani found her mother gagged and bound by ropes to a chair.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Tea awakens and still assumes that Eli can be trusted. But he informs her for the first time that he wanted Greg to kill her. She tries to get out and to find a way to call Todd and Dani. Meanwhile Dani is trapped in the other room of the abandoned warehouse where Eli has taken both of them, gagged and bound to a chair. But she manages to cut the ropes and free herself in the end and gets to the other side of the door assuming that Starr and Hope are there. But she is shocked to discover her mother whom she believed all this while was dead. Greg is still unconscious and doctors tells his family there's no guarantee that he will make it. But Destiny does not accept that. Hannah has Starr and baby Hope trapped inside her parents' home and makes it clear that she wants to keep Starr away from Cole long enough so that he will forget her and fall in love with Hannah instead. And she tells Starr she knows she is in love with James so Starr needs to admit it and set Cole free. Natalie believes that Tea is still alive although she cannot prove it. But she manages to get DNA evidence from Todd's home. Yet the cops cannot find where Eli has taken Dani and Tea nor do they know where to find Starr and baby Hope. Langston and Markko are waiting to hear about Starr and both admit they do not trust Hannah. Yet nobody figures out that she has taken Starr and baby Hope until James discovers that she has his bullet necklace that Starr previously had.",
