Both rushed to La Boulaie upon learning the news. Meanwhile, Markko helped Langston with her luggage and tried to put a positive spin on things. Langston was not receptive to the pep talk. Markko explained that he was trying to make things easier for Langston because he didn't want her to see how much he hurt over the idea of being separated from her. Langston appreciated Markko's attempt to help her cope with the devastating news of her impending departure. She confessed that she was somewhat disappointed with Dorian. Langston had believed Dorian would follow through on her promise to block Ray from taking Langston out of the country. \n\n\nStarr and Cole joined Langston and Markko in the foyer. Langston was worried because Starr was quite upset. Langston didn't want her situation to harm the baby, and asked Starr to calm down for the baby's sake. \n\n\nOn the back patio, Dorian urged Jackie by phone to follow through with their arrangements because Langston's time had run out. Jackie assured Dorian that Ray would be dead by the end of the day. After ending her call with Jackie, Dorian returned to the living room where she found Blair and Addie making a farewell banner for Langston. They wanted Langston to know how much she meant to them and to remember that they considered her a part of the family. When Dorian didn't seem overly upset over the idea of Langston leaving, Blair and Addie were convinced that Dorian was in denial. \n\n\nThe trio took their banner out into the foyer to surprise Langston. Langston was stunned when Dorian announced that she would not miss Langston. She soon understood what Dorian meant when Dorian explained that Langston would always be in their hearts. As a farewell gift, Blair handed Langston a one-way ticket to Llanview. She told Langston that if she ever felt in danger and needed to leave Colombia, she was to use the ticket and return home. Langston was touched by the generous offer. \n\n\nSensing that Langston wanted some time alone with Markko, Starr suggested leaving the lovebirds alone for a few minutes. When she had Markko to herself, Langston told him that she had decided to break things off with him. Markko refused to consider it. He told Langston that he loved her and would wait until they could be together. Markko also gave Langston a key to his home. It was all he had to offer, but he told her that she could use it as a safe haven whenever she needed one. \n\n\nRay prepared to knock on the front door to the Buchanan mansion when a man, dressed in a cable repairman's uniform, pulled out what appeared to be a garrotte and jumped Ray. Ray sensed the attack and braced himself. As Nigel opened the front door, the men tumbled inside as they engaged in a life or death struggle. Ray managed to gain the upper hand and demanded to know who had sent the assassin. The man pretended innocence, claiming that he was a repairman sent to fix a cable problem. Nigel took control of the situation and quickly ushered Ray away. \n\n\nIn the living room, Nora and Clint argued over Clint's decision to use Langston as a bargaining chip to control Dorian. Clint countered that Nora threw Todd under the bus 20 years earlier. Nora couldn't believe that Clint could compare the two incidents. She reminded Clint that Todd had been a guilty man while Langston was an innocent child. Nigel's knock and announcement of Ray Montez didn't lessen the tension. Ray made it clear that he intended to leave town with Langston that evening, but that his business with Clint was not concluded. Clint agreed with Ray, which fueled Nora's rage. \n\n\nAs soon as Ray departed, Nora and Clint's argument continued. Clint insisted that Dorian would come to her senses at the last moment and capitulate to Clint's wishes. Nora didn't agree and tried to get Nigel's opinion on the matter. Unfortunately, Nora and Clint didn't give Nigel any specifics about what they were arguing about, so he was confused by the entire exchange. Nigel made his excuses and left the living room before anyone could stop him. \n\n\nIn the hallway, Nigel found the \"repairman\" waiting. When Nigel pointed out that he had not called the cable company with a complaint, the man suggested that perhaps he was at the wrong address, then left. A few moments later, Jackie called his hit man and told him that the killing needed to be carried out as soon as possible. Jackie was clear; Ray could not leave Llanview. \n\n\nIn the living room, Nora and Clint continued to argue bitterly until Clint suddenly switched tactics, pulled Nora into his arms. and kissed her. Nora asked Clint if the kiss had been intended to make her feel better about the situation with Langston. Clint promised Nora that everything would be over soon. He was certain it would all work out to everyone's satisfaction. \n\n\nRay returned to La Boulaie to pick Langston up for her flight to Colombia. Starr was angry because Ray had arrived earlier than scheduled. Blair offered to drive Langston to the airport after their farewell party, but Ray refused to consider it. While everyone talked, Dorian slipped away and called Jackie. He promised her that the hit would be carried out soon. He advised Dorian to keep her eyes open, which alarmed her. Dorian didn't want Starr or Langston to witness Ray's murder. Unfortunately, that was something that Jackie couldn't guarantee. \n\n\nJared and Natalie remained sealed in the secret room in the basement. Their monitors were turned off so they were unaware of what was going on in Llanfair. However, Jared assured Natalie, Bo was a good cop and he would follow up on Jared's suspicions. \n\n\nTina let her dog, David Vickers, loose in the backyard. She had hoped her pooch would track down Cain Rogan, who had mysteriously disappeared. Tess walked up and before long the two women were talking about Natalie and Jared. Tina warned Tess that she couldn't keep them locked up indefinitely; eventually Viki would learn the truth. Tess didn't care about Natalie and Jared's fate, nor how it would affect Viki. \n\n\nBo went to Llanfair to talk to Viki. He found her in the kitchen. He carefully broached the subject of Tess returning by telling Viki about his recent visit with Jared, and some questionable observations that John McBain had observed since Nash's death. Viki seemed resistant to the idea that Tess could have returned. She was convinced that Jessica had been fully integrated and was doing well in therapy. Bo remained skeptical even when Viki pointed out that if Jessica had been behaving oddly, Tina would have noticed it. Bo pointed out that Tina had never \"encountered\" Tess, but that Jared had. \n\n\nViki's certainty turned to doubt when Bo shared some other concerns including the fact that only Jessica has had contact with Natalie since Natalie disappeared. If Tess had returned and Natalie realized it, it could explain why Natalie had gone missing and cut off all contact with everyone. \n\n\nUnbeknownst to either, Tess was nearby and overheard the entire exchange between Bo and Viki. \n\n\nBo and Viki decided to find Tina and question her about Jessica. They found her in the living room. Not surprisingly, Tina was evasive and managed to make a quick escape. She was waylaid when a delivery person showed up at the front door with an envelope for \"Her Highness.\" Tina took the envelope and opened it. Inside she found a picture of her dog, David Vickers, with a recent edition of the newspaper held beneath his furry little face. \n\n\nTess gathered up Bree and a diaper bag. As Tess walked through Llanfair's kitchen, she told Bree to say goodbye. Tess had decided to run away to Napa Valley with the baby. \n\n\nAdriana explained to Gigi that Rex's condition was unchanged but that he had been moved to another facility so that Gigi and Shane could not see him. Gigi was angry and reminded Adriana that she didn't have a right to keep Shane from his father. Adriana didn't think that Shane seemed very interested in seeing Rex, so she didn't view it as a hardship. Gigi asked Shane to step away, but he refused. Shane was worried that Adriana would strike his mother again. The two ladies bickered awhile longer until Adriana went too far. She said that she didn't think Rex would benefit from visiting with Shane after the way that Shane had hurt him. When Gigi asked Shane to give her a moment alone with Adriana, Shane listened and walked away. As soon as he was out of sight, Gigi punched Adriana in the face. As Adriana picked herself up off of the floor, Gigi informed her that they were even. \n\n\nGigi and Shane then decided to leave. However, Gigi stopped long enough to warn Adriana that she would not give up. Adriana would lose when it came to Rex. \n\n\n",
