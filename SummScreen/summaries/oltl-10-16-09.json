Matthew's parents related that they had canceled his surgical procedure with Dr. Nance. When Matthew questioned what his parents were up to, Bo and Nora announced that they were relocating Matthew to a place where he couldn't enforce the judge's ruling. Upon learning that his parents were sending him to a new school in London in an attempt to prevent him from having the surgery, Matthew flew into a rage.\n\n\nInside Shaun's hospital room, Destiny was overjoyed when her brother awoke from his unconscious state. A confused Shaun asked to see his parents, Greg, and Rachel. Before rushing off to locate the family, Destiny told Shaun that Rachel would be thrilled to learn that he was awake.\n\n\nInside Greg's room at the Palace Hotel, Greg and Rachel shared a passionate kiss. As they prepared to make love, Greg received a call from Destiny, informing him that Shaun had regained consciousness. A relieved Greg told Rachel the news, and she responded by giving him a hug. Greg offered to drive Rachel to the hospital to see Shaun, but she hastily related that she would drive herself to the hospital. When Greg commented that they would have to eventually discuss what had taken place between them moments earlier, Rachel agreed but reminded Greg that Shaun was their first priority.\n\n\nOnce his parents arrived, Shaun was surprised to learn that he had been in a coma for over a month. Shaun smiled when his mother informed him that Rachel had visited him several times. When Greg entered the room, Shaun thanked his brother for saving his life. Meanwhile, Rachel watched the family through Shaun's hospital room window. Unable to face Shaun, Rachel rushed off.\n\n\nAfter witnessing Rachel leave, Destiny managed to catch up to her. Informing Rachel that Shaun had asked for her, Destiny suggested that Rachel pay her boyfriend a visit. When Rachel entered the room, Shaun was delighted to see her, but Greg appeared uncomfortable. Rachel told Shaun never to frighten her again. Thrilled by her presence, Shaun declared, \"I'm not going anywhere. I promised the woman I love that I was taking her on a date!\"\n\n\nInside her room at the Palace Hotel, T\u00e9a prepared to make a call, but a knock on the door interrupted her thoughts. T\u00e9a was annoyed when she discovered Elijah standing in her doorway, wearing only a towel. Claiming that he had locked himself out of his room, Elijah asked to use her phone to call hotel security. A look of disgust crossed T\u00e9a's face as Elijah began to flirt with her. Aware of Elijah's intentions, T\u00e9a immediately retrieved her briefcase and locked it safely inside a desk drawer. When T\u00e9a stated that she had thwarted Elijah's plans of stealing her briefcase for Ross, Elijah stated that Ross only wanted to see his child.\n\n\nT\u00e9a made it clear that Ross had given up his parental rights after their divorce, but Elijah reminded T\u00e9a that she was still married to Ross. T\u00e9a announced that she had plans to travel to Tahiti and finalize her divorce. After suggesting that T\u00e9a have a heart and allow Ross to see his child, Elijah commented that T\u00e9a had given her heart to Todd, who had stomped all over it. T\u00e9a's face dropped when Elijah stated that Todd was probably romancing another woman that very moment.\n\n\nInside Blair's hospital room, Blair awoke after having a nightmare about her argument with T\u00e9a. Blair was pleasantly surprised when she discovered Todd at her bedside. Doting over her, Todd promised to do everything within his power to help her recover. Moments later, Jack surprised Blair with a visit. Blair appeared happy as she spent time with Jack and Todd.\n\n\nLater, Blair questioned Todd about his relationship with T\u00e9a. Acknowledging that T\u00e9a had lied to him, Todd stated that he wished that he had taken Blair's advice concerning T\u00e9a. When Blair expressed regret that she couldn't remember what she and T\u00e9a had been arguing about, Todd urged her to forget the altercation. Blair was convinced that the basis of the argument would affect Todd's life dramatically. Appearing torn about his feelings for T\u00e9a, a sullen Todd remarked, \"Well, T\u00e9a won't ever tell me!\"\n\n\nAs Todd and Blair shared a special moment together, they decided to work together in rearing their children. Blair thanked Todd for rushing to her rescue. Promising to help Blair on her road to recovery, Todd stated that he wanted to grant Blair her wish. Touched by Todd's compassion, Blair asked Todd what he had planned for her. As Marty appeared in the doorway, Todd stated, \"Here she is now!\" Blair wasn't pleased by Marty's arrival.\n\n\nBack at the Palace Hotel, Elijah tried his best to convince T\u00e9a to tell him where she had hidden her child. Unable to get any answers from T\u00e9a, Elijah argued that he could locate someone who might be privy to the whereabouts of T\u00e9a's child. Relating that he and T\u00e9a shared the same practice of helping their clients, Elijah commented that they both were willing to use every trick in the book to win for their clients. Showing no fear, T\u00e9a gave Elijah a devilish look and exclaimed, \"Yeah, but my tricks always work!\" Stealing his towel, T\u00e9a pushed a naked Elijah out of her hotel room.\n\n\nAfterward, T\u00e9a opened the mysterious briefcase and removed its contents. Inside were a picture and a brochure. After staring lovingly at the photo, T\u00e9a made a phone call. Once T\u00e9a made contact, she smiled and said, \"Hi, honey, its mom! Whatcha doing?\" T\u00e9a held a brochure entitled, \"The International Warwick Academy.\"\n\n\nBack on the Buchanan jet, Matthew was livid after learning that his parents had betrayed him. Matthew told his parents that he hated them and accused them of kidnapping him. Presenting Matthew with evidence of Dr. Nance's past work, Nora informed her son that Dr. Nance had only performed the operation twice, and both efforts had yielded minimal results.\n\n\nWhen an angered Matthew demanded to know where he would be living in London, Nora explained that Matthew would attend a boarding school. Nora handed Matthew a brochure of his new school, which read, \"The International Warwick Academy.\" Afterward, Nora pulled Bo to the side and questioned exactly what they had done to their son. Meanwhile, Matthew glared at the brochure.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan lodge, Jared raced into the cabin. Jared stared at an unknown person and screamed, \"You! It was you that brought me here?\"\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica and Brody were shocked when Natalie revealed to John that Jared had admitted working with the dead stalker, Wayne Landers. Showing sympathy toward Natalie, John asked her for the details of Jared's confession. Jessica was horrified to learn that Jared was responsible for the stalking episodes. Brody insisted that there was a third co-conspirator. Defending her husband, Natalie was adamant that Jared was being used as a pawn and that the real killer had threatened Jared in some way. \n\n\nUpon learning that Jared had disappeared after receiving several text messages, John wondered if Natalie knew of his whereabouts, but she insisted that he hadn't given her any information. John instructed Brody to await further instruction at the police station, and Jessica left to advise Viki and Charlie of the situation.\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at the cabin, a frantic Jared continued to yell at an unknown person. Jared argued, \"I've already confessed everything to Natalie! It's over!\"\n\n\nAs John continued to pressure Natalie for information on Jared, Natalie received a phone call from the company that provided security at the Buchanan lodge. The security company informed Natalie that someone had tripped the alarm at the lodge. Upon receiving the news, Natalie reminded John that the stalker had been observed for the first time at the lodge. Adamant that the stalker was at the lodge, Natalie announced that she was headed to the lodge to search for Jared. Although John tried to stop her, Natalie raced off to locate her husband. Realizing that trouble was brewing, John followed close behind.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan lodge, a panicked Natalie rushed into the cabin. Consumed with fear, Natalie lost her balance and fell to the floor. Standing to her feet, Natalie discovered blood on her hands and let out a blood-curdling scream.\n\n\n",
