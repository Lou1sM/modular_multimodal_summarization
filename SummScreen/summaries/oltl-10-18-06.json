He also mentions the underhanded way in which he obtained Hugh's signature for his contract to get Spencer's presumed Buchanan inheritance. He's quite happy that he appears to be the one with the upper hand for a change. Dorian adamantly advises him to lay low until Spencer is convicted and then he can try to get his money. He makes fun of her real and honest persona; she retorts that he'd better listen to her.\n\n\nEvangeline stops by Nora's office to wish her well at Spencer's hearing. Nora is feeling quite insecure and is sure she will throw the whole thing, freeing Spencer. She's insistent that he not go unpunished. Vange gives her a pep talk and tells her how common her feelings are. Nora invites her to be second chair but Evangeline declines, accepting a consulting position instead. \n\n\nThe Buchanan men meet up to hit some golf balls. Bo and Kevin poke fun at Clint, citing Dorian's unending pursuit of him and how she'll never give up. Clint insists that she was only an attraction for the moment and that they're through. He certainly couldn't be with her when she hasn't even shown any remorse for what she did to Adriana.\n\n\nAfter Blair happily sends Jack off to school, Todd confronts her with the absurdity of the situation. She calls it a normal transition but he insists that he's only putting up with her being there for Jack, so that he won't think his dad is a monster. He doesn't want her there and it won't work, he insists yet again as she leans over to kiss him. He calls her crazy and compares her to Margaret who also wouldn't listen to what he was saying. Blair of course, denies being anything like their former nemesis. They agree to head to Spencer's hearing together but first Todd calls Evangeline to give her advance warning, for when she sees them together. We're not together, Todd informs her.\n\n\nNat pays Spencer a visit to blame him for what happened to John. The tables are quickly turned when a vehement Spencer accuses her of being angry with him because John devoted more of his attention to Spencer than to her. If Nat is tortured it's her own fault that John is dead, he continues. John was very aloof, not loving and he only became happy when he thought he had the man responsible for his father's death. Natalie only had leftover crumbs of attention from him because she wasn't woman enough to keep him happy. John probably would have taken his ring back eventually and gone back to Evangeline who is way more of a woman than Natalie, he snarls. She knows John never loved her, even if she does have a ring. John was incapable of loving anyone but himself and was really an emotional cripple. Natalie is speechless and insulted and voices her sympathy that poor Spencer is so miserable. Did his father make him that way, she wonders. When he mentions that his father will pay, Natalie is confused. Isn't your father dead? Spencer is certain that he will not be found guilty.\n\n\nWhen Michael and Marcie meet at the courthouse to finalize their adoption of Tommy, they learn that he was previously adopted. Michael figures it was probably a teen mother and reassures Marcie when she's concerned over not being able to learn of Tommy's medical history. He's a doctor and he'll look out for their son, Michael consoles her. Shortly after, the courtroom begins to fill as people arrive for Spencer's hearing. When Spencer arrives he comments on how cute Tommy is which piques Marcie's curiosity. His lawyer warns him not to look smug. When the judge orders Spencer to stand to hear the charges against him, Spencer remains seated. After being warned of contempt, he does stand up but it's only to make a speech. The judge and lawyer both try to get him to stop but he doesn't. His lawyer threatens to quit. He announces that he couldn't stand because Spencer Truman is not his real name. Asa Buchanan is his father and he's a Buchanan boy!\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Blair plays 'Happy Family' by making Jack's lunch and seeing him off to school. She promises him that they will be having a big family dinner that night. After Jack is gone, she turns and finds Todd behind her. \"What the hell are you doing?\" He tells her that no matter what she does, this arrangement will never be real. He is only going along with this for the children but he assures Blair that nothing will change his mind about her. She moves closer to him now and even though he orders her not to touch him she kisses him. He hates the feeling he gets around Blair now. She reminds him of someone else. There was another woman who he used to tell to back off and she never got it either. He finds Blair crazier than Margaret. Natalie goes to see Spencer to tell him that she wishes that he had died instead of John. She shows him her ring and calls herself John's fiancee, but Spencer feels he knows better. He asks Natalie if John ever actually told her that he loved her, or if that ring that she waves now has taken on a much bigger meaning that it has. He will not go to jail for the rest of his life so that she and everyone else can have a scapegoat for all the problems in Llanview. He can't believe that any man in his right mind would take Natalie over Evangeline. Natalie is crushed by his words. He found her relationship to John dysfunctional. He was aloof and obsessed with finding his father's killer. \"You gave and gave and gave Natalie and all you got were a few crumbs in return. You just weren't woman enough.\" She can't believe how evil his is. She wonders aloud if he got this from his father. \"My father will regret the day that he was born!\" Natalie finds that totally strange to say. \"Spencer, your father is dead.\" Nora is having some trouble with the case. She doesn't think that she is going to be able to handle it. Evangeline agrees to help her with it. Michael and Marcie finalize their adoption but are told that there is information missing from the file to do with Tommy's biological parents. Still it will not affect the adoption. Todd calls Evangeline to let her know that he is driving Blair to court but that it means nothing. Todd drives Blair to the courthouse, but he makes it clear that he is just giving her a drive and they are not a couple. When they arrive, Todd sees Evangeline and leaves a displeased Blair with Michael and Marcie to see her. Spencer doesn't rise when the judge told to do so. \"That wasn't my name that you called out your honor. My father is Asa Buchanan!\" Kevin, Bo and Clint are together and they show little emotion at Spencer's announcement.",
