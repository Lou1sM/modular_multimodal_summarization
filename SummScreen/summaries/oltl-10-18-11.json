    "tvmega_recap": "At the station, after both Vimal and Shaun have tipped John off about the gun used to kill Victor being the same type Brody uses, John becomes suspicious of Brody and believes he's hiding something. Natalie runs the test on the gun to find out that Brody is not a suspect in Victor's murder investigation. But John still knows that Brody is hiding \"something\" and asks what Brody's confrontation with Victor was all about and how Brody felt Victor had \"threatened his family\". Brody has an answer but John knows he's lying and withholding something when Brody knows he must never tell a living soul that Liam is John's and not his. The mayor is putting pressure on Bo and Nora to convict Todd although they know they don't have a case against him with only circumstantial evidence. However, when Todd is alone in the cabin and burning up with fever, he \"sees\" Irene who convinces him that he did in fact shoot Victor. He then \"remembers\" going to Victor's home in the rain and blowing him away because Victor took his life. When T\u00e9a returns, Todd is stunned and does not know what to tell her. She tells him they must get to the station where he will turn himself in and Bo and Nora will be forced to drop the charges. They do that but Todd is living with the terrible secret. Rex talks to Aubrey at Capricorn about how he used to be not unlike her and Cutter but has changed his life around with Bo Buchanan as an inspiration. IN Kentucky, Cutter watches over the Gigi look-alike whom Kim has told him is Stacy, who is alone in her hospital room and unconscious. She awakens and reveals she does not remember anything or who she is. After Jessica has seen the document that confirms that John instead of Brody is Liam's father, she does not know what to do. Although tempted to use it to break Natalie and Brody up, when she goes to find Brody, he tells her how his life has been given back to him now that Liam is his, how devastated he was to find out that Ryder was Robert Ford's and not his, and how truly sorry he is for what he and Natalie did to her. And she finds she cannot do that to her sister and former fianc\u00e9. She also wonders how the document could have gotten into Tina's possession and what Tina might be scheming to do with it, although Tina is not aware of it and only cares about her dog returning. Jessica then finds the only person she can confide in regarding this whole thing is Robert Ford."
