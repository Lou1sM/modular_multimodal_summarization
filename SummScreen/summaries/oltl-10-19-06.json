(Scroll down for more on that.) Vincent popped in and Layla asked Vincent if he drugged Cris. Vincent remained silent. \"Go and redeem yourself somewhere else. We're through,\" Layla snapped. \n\n\nRex got some information about the whereabouts of Todd Jr. A source admitted to having seen a baby near Spencer and learned that Spencer dropped the baby off to someone in a car. \"Gotcha, Spencer, you smug bastard,\" Rex smiled. Rex went to the penthouse to update Todd on the hunt for Todd Jr. Todd told Rex though he had done more bad things than good, he (meaning Todd) thought he was a good father and wanted to be a good dad to Todd Jr. Blair let Todd know that she wanted to help him. \n\n\nVincent hoped that Nash's current problems wouldn't prevent him from making his first loan payment. \n\n\nAntonio told Jessica about Nash's little fight with Cris. Jessica was horrified and wondered what Nash was thinking. Antonio explained that Nash was in a tailspin \u2014 sort of like the one Antonio went into when he learned he was a Santi. Jessica asked Antonio for help planning the wedding. He said anything as long as she said 'I do' to him. Nash knocked at the door and thanked them for putting his daughter first. He asked Jessica to tell Bree about Tess when Bree would understand it. Jessica said she could only do that with Nash's help. Nash headed out but then Antonio asked Nash to be part of the wedding. Jessica's eyes almost popped out of her head. \n\n\nSpencer told the Buchanan men all about Asa's affair with Emma Bradley, his mother. The entire courtroom was riveted and horrified at the same time. Bo brought up the suggestion of a DNA test. The Buchanans got their dander up. Blair stormed out and declared that Spencer would never get near her kids again. Todd chuckled at the whole thing. Bo said Spencer would not be joining them for Thanksgiving, or any other holiday for that matter. The arguing continued until the judge was announced and everyone had to come to order. The judge said that the defendant's parentage has no bearing on this case and added that this was not a circus. The judge ruled that there was enough evidence for Spencer to stand trial for the murder of Thomas McBain. Evangeline was elated but Nora didn't think she'd be ready to do the full trial. She almost lost her bearings while in front of the judge. \n\n\nDorian asked David to move out of her personal space because she wanted to focus on Clint in the courtroom. Kevin was going to head over to Grandpa's to see what he knew about Spencer's claims. \n\n\nDorian's planned rendezvous with Clint was about to hit a big bump in the road: Adriana told the manager at Capricorn that Dorian wouldn't be able to make it. Viki also got an invite to Capricorn. Clint showed up early, as did Viki. Before Dorian could leave her house, Adriana locked her in the closet. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The judge orders counsel into chambers. Todd feels that Spencer being a Buchanan is just another reason to hate him. Bo wants proof but Spencer will not hand that to him on a silver platter. He tells how Asa had an affair with Emma and that was how he came to be. Blair thinks that this is sick and she stomps out of the room. Rex begs Adriana not to go through with this plan to get back at Dorian, but she is determined to make her mother pay. She promises not to take things too far. After Rex leaves, Adriana sees that Layla is in the living room still staring at the flowers that Vincent sent. She feels bad for her friend. \"Oh don't pretend. I know that your boyfriend is trying to get dirt on mine!\" Adriana is shocked by Layla's outburst. Layla says that it isn't fair that Adriana gets a second chance at love with Rex, while she doesn't. Adriana is surprised by what she hears in the girl's voice. \"Love? You are in love with Vincent?\" Rex catches up with a source in the park. Mick had some dirty dealings with Spencer but it was too much for him to handle. \"They guy liked kids. There was this baby I seen him with once.\" Mick tells how he did a job for Truman where he took this Cochrane chick to the airport. Later, Mick wanted to make a few bucks and hit Spencer up for some work. When he arrived at Spencer's place, he saw the man coming out with a baby. He got in a car for a few minutes and then got out alone. The car drove off with the baby. Nash comes to Antonio and Jessica to thank them properly for being so cool about everything lately. He can get over Tess but he needs Jessica to do something for him first. Mick can't remember the car that Spencer was sitting in the night the baby was taken away but he runs to get a friend who may recollect. Rex turns and finds Marcie walking in the park with Tommy. He is happy of the child's adoption and hopes that he will be able to get another little guy back where he belongs. Rex is surprised to find Blair at Todd's place when he arrives to give him news. Blair eavesdrops from the stairs and hears about Todd trying to find his baby. Adriana tells the manager at Dorian's getaway that she will not be coming. Clint shows up and is seated. Viki arrives thinking that she is about to meet whoever wants to take over her paper. She becomes the other guest for the romantic evening to her surprise. She and Clint stare at each other confused. Dorian is dressed for her date and when she heads into the closet for the finishing touch, a hand pushes her in and closes the door. It is Adriana and she smiles knowing that she has ruined her mother's night with Clint.",
