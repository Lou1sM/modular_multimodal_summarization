    "soap_central": "\nThe Born Identity\n\n\nInside Blair's hospital room, Blair was visibly upset when Todd informed her that he had asked Marty to hypnotize Blair, in hopes of Blair recalling the lapse in memory she was experiencing.  After a brief hesitation, Blair thanked Todd for his help and agreed to allow Marty to hypnotize her.  Todd exited the room, and Marty set out to help Blair remember her argument with  T\u00e9a.\n\n\nExplaining that she would place Blair in a state of relaxed concentration, Marty was certain that Blair would remember every detail of her argument with T\u00e9a.   Once Blair was under hypnosis, Marty asked Blair to recall everything that had taken place prior to her fall.   Immediately, Blair remembered her altercation with T\u00e9a.  A look of horror crossed Blair's face when she realized that T\u00e9a had admitted that she had a child.   When Blair awoke, she stared at Marty in disbelief and remarked, \"T\u00e9a has a child with Todd.\"\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, T\u00e9a spoke to her child over the phone.  T\u00e9a promised to visit her child at boarding school during Parent's Weekend, but hesitated when the child asked for her father to accompany T\u00e9a.  As a nervous T\u00e9a attempted to deflect her child's questions, Carlotta arrived and interrupted the phone conversation.  Promising to see her child soon, T\u00e9a quickly ended the call.\n\n\nRelieved to see a friendly face, T\u00e9a broke down and told Carlotta of her recent troubles.  Attempting to console T\u00e9a, Carlotta questioned if T\u00e9a was in love with two men, Todd and her husband.  With tears in her eyes, T\u00e9a responded, \"Only one!\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, Todd sat in the hall outside of Blair's room.  Twirling his wedding band, a frustrated Todd leaped to his feet and rushed off.\n\n\nBack inside T\u00e9a's room at the Palace Hotel, Carlotta continued to question what was troubling T\u00e9a.  Struggling to keep her composure, T\u00e9a blurted out,\"Things would be different if Todd knew the truth!\"  As Carlotta pressed T\u00e9a for answers, Todd arrived and interrupted the conversation.\n\n\nAlone with T\u00e9a, Todd handed her his wedding band, but she refused to accept it.   Referring to their marriage as meaningless, Todd stated that it was senseless for him and T\u00e9a to wear wedding bands.   Angered by Todd's actions, T\u00e9a challenged Todd to admit that he no longer loved her.  When Todd didn't deny his feelings for her, T\u00e9a insisted that Todd loved her as much as she loved him.  Refusing to admit his love for her, Todd handed T\u00e9a his wedding band and exited her apartment.   A devastated T\u00e9a stared at the photo of her child and wept.  Meanwhile, Todd stood outside her door and appeared conflicted.\n\n\nUpon hearing Blair's startling revelation, Marty suggested that Blair inform Todd, and offered to locate him.    To Marty's surprise, Blair declared, \"No, I'm not telling Todd a damn thing!\"  Reminding Marty that their session was confidential, Blair demanded that Marty remain quiet about her discovery.   Blair feared that Todd might reunite with T\u00e9a if Blair told him about the child.   Blair warned, \"If you repeat one word, you'll never practice medicine again!\"   Before Marty could respond, Todd entered Blair's room and asked if Blair had remembered anything.   When Blair informed Todd that the hypnosis hadn't worked, Marty stormed out of the room.\n\n\nAfter making Blair comfortable in her hospital bed, Todd made himself comfortable on the couch.  Todd expressed his regret that the hypnosis had been unsuccessful.  With a sly smile Blair remarked, \"I guess I'll just have to live without those memories forever!\"\n\n\nAt the jail, Elijah told Ross that he had been unsuccessful at retrieving T\u00e9a's briefcase.  Elijah told Ross that he wasn't any closer to finding Ross's child.   Stating that he hadn't been in his child's life, Ross questioned whether he should stop fighting T\u00e9a for the right to be involved with his child.   Revealing that Ross was his brother, Elijah insisted that he would never allow Ross to make such a decision.   Maintaining that Ross had a legal right to his child, Elijah vowed to help his brother.\n\n\nAs Ross began to discuss Blair, Elijah realized that Ross had strong feelings for Blair, and urged his brother to pursue her.  Recalling his past episodes with Blair, Ross stated that Blair was strong and unlike any other woman he had ever met.  Although he acknowledged that a spark existed between him and Blair, Ross doubted that he stood a chance with Blair because he felt she still loved Todd.  Elijah hoped that Ross was correct about Blair having feelings for Ross.  Elijah stated that Blair's soft spot for Ross might be the only chance he had of beating the criminal charges he faced.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Layla dropped in on Cristian, who was working in the kitchen.   Looking around the kitchen, Layla recalled the night that she and Cristian were locked inside the freezer.  As they laughed about that night, Layla stated, \"We've come a long way!\"  Layla turned to leave, but Cristian asked her to stay and help him cook.  After asking her to taste his new creation, Cristian kissed Layla.\n\n\nLayla responded to Cristian's kiss, but suddenly pulled away.   Initially, Cristian apologized, but quickly retracted his statement.  Cristian admitted that he had wanted to kiss Layla for quite some time.   To Cristian's surprise, Layla admitted that she had also wanted to experience the kiss, but insisted that they could never share another intimate moment again.   Layla informed Cristian that she feared a relationship with him would be a betrayal to Evangeline.  Acknowledging his love for Evangeline, Cristian told Layla that her sister would want them to be happy.  Layla refused to believe that Evangeline would want them to become involved romantically, and rushed out of the diner.\n\n\nAt the police station, Jessica and Brody told Viki and Charlie about Jared's involvement in the stalking of Jessica.  Charlie refused to believe that Jared would cause Jessica any harm, but Brody revealed that Jared had confessed to Natalie.  Charlie and Viki phoned both Jared and Natalie but were unable to make contact.  Viki grew alarmed when Jessica told her about Madame Delphina's prediction that someone else would die.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at the Buchanan Lodge, after hearing Natalie's screams, John rushed into the cabin and discovered Natalie kneeling over a dead body.    Gasping, Natalie informed John that Pamela Stewart, Asa's ex-wife, was the victim.  As John stepped away to call for help, Natalie stood over Pamela's body and exclaimed, \"Jared, where are you?\"   When John returned, Natalie stated that Jared would never murder anyone.  Before John could respond, Clint entered the cabin.  Natalie and Jared updated Clint on what had taken place.\n\n\nIn the Llanview Police Station, after receiving a call from John, Brody informed everyone that John and Natalie had discovered Pamela Stewart's dead body at the lodge.   A panicked Jessica exclaimed, \"Oh, my God, Delphina was right!\"\n\n\nBack at the lodge, Clint reminded John that Pamela had foiled Jared's plan of passing himself off as Asa's son.  John stated that Pamela had ties to both Buchanan Enterprises and Jared.  Natalie begged John not to condemn Jared without knowing all the facts.   Presenting the evidence team with the murder weapon, John told them that Pamela was bludgeoned to death -- in the same manner that Wayne Landers was murdered, before Jared found him.\n\n\nAfter Clint, Natalie, and the evidence team left, John noticed a wallet on the couch.  It belonged to Jared.\n\n\n",
