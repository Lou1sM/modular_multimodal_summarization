    "soap_central": "\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian was on the phone, trying to reassure Blair about the missing girls, when she heard a knock at the door. \"Oh it's you,\" she said to the person on the other side of the door. It was Viki, and she wanted to help Dorian through her ordeal. Dorian didn't want Viki's help and didn't appreciate Viki's look of \"concern and pity.\" Dorian noted that Echo was back in town, and sarcastically, she asked Viki for permission to look at Viki with the same expression of \"concern and pity.\"\n\n\nDorian described Echo's visit to La Boulaie and her attempt to put Dorian's family on display with their grief. Echo had wanted to take photos of them and had suggested that those photos would provide leads to the girls' whereabouts. Viki asked whether Echo had offered bargain prices, and Dorian called Echo a vulture. Viki revealed that Echo needed money and had stopped at Llanfair first. Dorian told Viki how she had threatened to have Echo arrested after Echo pushed her way into La Boulaie. Viki thought that Dorian and Echo had been great friends at one time.\n\n\nDorian took exception to that remark and remembered how everyone had welcomed Echo the first time she'd arrived in town many years in the past. When Echo had gone after Clint, he was the one who'd betrayed Viki, she indicated. Viki recalled how happy Dorian had been when that happened. They discussed the turn of events that had led to Clint being arrested for pushing Echo to her death. Dorian insisted that she had told the truth because she was sure she had seen that happen. It appeared that Echo was after Charlie this time, Dorian added. \"Watch out, Viki,\" she cautioned.\n\n\nViki admitted that Echo and Charlie had engaged in an affair previously. Dorian was surprised and announced that Echo would have to answer to Dorian if she made any trouble. Viki confessed that she had hired Rex to do some investigative work on Echo. They had already learned that Echo had returned to Llanview less than a year after her trial, when she had not been permitted to be there. Dorian recalled that Echo had sworn she hadn't been to Llanview since the trial. Viki emphasized that Echo had lied.\n\n\nThe women wondered why Echo had returned again, and Dorian was certain it was to cause trouble between Viki and Charlie. Viki knew that wouldn't be possible. The talk turned to the missing girls, and the women commiserated with each other. Viki was sorry that Dorian was alone during such a tough time, but Dorian was indignant. She yelled that she wasn't alone. Viki ordered her to stop being brave, but Dorian ushered Viki out of the house. Dorian promised to call Viki if she heard anything about the girls. Viki urged her to call if she needed anything.\n\n\nBrody was at Llanfair, getting ready for work. He advised Charlie that Eli had been seen at the hospital and had tried to kill Greg. \"Don't be a hero,\" Charlie warned him. Charlie had lost his own son when Jared had resorted to risk-taking. Brody assured the older man that he would do his job but not take any unnecessary risks.\n\n\nCharlie sadly told Brody how much he missed Jared, and Brody stated that he missed him too. He missed being able to talk to Jared, especially with all that had been going on recently. Charlie proclaimed that he would have \"throttled\" Ford for what he had done to Jessica. He sympathized with Brody's misfortune and offered his ear if Brody wanted to talk to him instead. Brody took Charlie up on the offer, and they briefly spoke about Ford. Brody was sick of the subject, though, and wanted to put it to rest. He advised Charlie that he and Jessica would be getting the paternity test. Charlie knew that Brody would be fine, even if the baby turned out to be Ford's.\n\n\nRex found Gigi sitting at the diner and working on a sketch for her art class. He had been investigating Echo and had learned that she had skipped out on her motel bill. The couple was interrupted when Cristian arrived and asked to see Gigi's homework. He was anxiously waiting for Layla to fly in from Paris. Just then, Rex announced that a potential lead in his case had just walked into the diner. He excused himself from the table. Gigi asked Cristian if he had any clue as to why Rex was being hostile towards Clint.\n\n\nRex wandered over to Clint's table, and Clint asked how everyone was. Rex stated that Gigi was enjoying her new job, and Clint remarked how he was happy to help her to stay in school. He loved it when everyone was able to work together, he added. \"Who cares if it happens at gunpoint,\" Rex replied sarcastically. Clint wondered if Rex were speaking about himself or David Vickers. Rex noted that neither of them had been given a choice, though Clint reminded Rex that Rex could have gone to Kelly and given her the information on David. Rex disagreed, since that would have meant Gigi dropping out of school.\n\n\nClint thought it was Rex's job to protect Gigi, the same way that Clint was protecting Dorian with news of David. The truth just wouldn't help in either of those instances, he said. Rex asked if Clint had told himself the same thing years earlier when he'd cheated on Viki with Echo. Clint noted that he'd only had two words to say and they were, \"Stacy Morasco.\" He refused to say anything else about Echo or his relationship with her.\n\n\nRex continued to ask questions, and he made it known that Echo had returned to Llanview less than a year after she had made a deal at her trial to never return. He asked Clint why she had returned. Clint didn't care, but Rex asked whether Clint had seen her at the time. \"Who wants to know?\" Clint asked him. Rex stated that Viki had hired him to check up on Echo. Clint laughed.\n\n\nRex announced that he'd discovered that Echo had received a speeding ticket during that previous return to town. \"Don't quit your day job,\" Clint advised him. Annoyed, Rex stated that it was his day job. Clint assured Rex that he had his own people keeping an eye open, and Echo was the least of his problems.\n\n\nGigi showed Cristian her sketch and explained what it meant. The sketch revolved around the half of a heart pendant, and she explained what had happened when she and Rex had been on the search for Rex's parents in New Mexico. Cristian wanted to see Gigi focus on herself and not on Rex. Gigi insisted that the sketch was actually about herself. She told him how she had gone on the trip with Rex even though they had broken up. After the trip, they'd ended up back together, and the half of a heart symbolized the trip and their relationship.\n\n\nCristian received a call and learned that Layla would not be returning to Llanview. She had too much work. Gigi persuaded Cristian to go to Paris instead, and she would be able to follow his lesson plans for his class.\n\n\nRoxy took Echo up to Echo's new room in the Angel Square Hotel and babbled about the hotel's perks. Echo maintained that she wanted to keep a \"low profile.\" Roxy asked her for the deposit, but Echo changed the subject. She suddenly exclaimed how perfect Roxy's bone structure was and asked whether she had ever been a model. She wanted to take Roxy's picture, and handed Roxy a business card. The card stated that Echo had been all over the world. Echo noted that she had previously worked at the Banner and knew both Viki and Dorian well. She had even recently taken Dorian's family portrait, she bragged.\n\n\nThey discussed the cost of the photo, and Echo suggested that Roxy use the photos for her business. She refused to show the photos of Dorian's family, citing an \"exclusive deal.\" She had a photo of Chuckles though, she said. She handed Roxy the photo of Viki and Charlie. Roxy was amused that Echo had called Viki by the name of Chuckles, but Echo clarified that it was her nickname for Charlie. She explained that Charlie had helped her after she'd broken up with Clint. Roxy couldn't believe that Echo had been in affairs with both men. Echo made it clear that her relationship with Charlie had occurred long before he had married Viki.\n\n\nRoxy mentioned that Viki and Charlie had their own problems and had almost broken up. Echo's eyes lit up at the news. Roxy explained that it had revolved around Charlie's son, and Echo was surprised again. She never knew that Charlie had a son, and she pressed Roxy for information. Roxy explained that he had been killed. Echo wondered if Charlie had known he'd had a son when he had been with Echo. Roxy noted that Charlie had experienced a problem with the bottle in the past, and that had probably distorted things. Roxy headed to the door and again asked Echo for a deposit for the room.\n\n\nEcho suggested that she take photos of Roxy in lieu of payment, and while the cost of the photos would be much greater, she'd call it even. It would help Roxy's business. Roxy was sure the two of them would be good friends, and Echo agreed that they already were. Echo looked at the photo of Viki and Charlie again. She'd had no idea that Charlie had lost a child. Once she was alone, Echo put a jewelry box away in a dresser drawer. She looked at the photo again and covered up Viki's face.\n\n\nJames pondered the fact that Eli hadn't allowed Todd to talk to Starr on the phone, and he wondered why Eli hadn't tried to prove that he had all three of the girls with him. James was concerned, and he thought that Hannah might be involved. He told Ford about Hannah's possession of James's necklace, and her excuse for why she had it. Ford thought that the idea that Hannah could have kidnapped Starr was crazy, but James insisted that he didn't believe Hannah's story about the necklace. It was just a feeling he had, James told his brother.\n\n\nFord, still hurting from the assault, advised James to drop his pursuit of Hannah. He suggested that James go to the cops instead, though the boys concurred that neither of them would be welcome at the police station. James agreed he only had a hunch and needed more evidence, but he couldn't talk to Hannah himself. They had argued when he'd last seen her. He thought it would be a good idea if Ford were to speak to her. Ford refused. \"I messed her up,\" he said. He didn't think it would be fair to her.\n\n\nJames begged his brother to go in case it turned out that Hannah was involved in Starr's kidnapping. Suddenly, Ford changed his mind. James was perplexed, but Ford explained that he couldn't take the look on James's face. It was the same look that James had when Ford had left him behind with their dad. Ford couldn't let his brother down again. James hoped that Ford would be able to find something out.\n\n\nJames said that Hannah had been quite intense about Cole and being with him, but Ford reminded him that Hannah had been the same way with Ford. James pointed out that Starr hadn't been seen in the getaway car, and while it was presumed that she'd been in the back seat, he thought that Hannah was in on it with Eli.\n\n\nStarr and Hope waited for help after Starr tossed the baseball with the note through the window. To Starr's dismay, Hannah arrived with the baseball in her possession. The boy across the street had picked it up, but she had convinced him that it was just a game. Starr tried to convince Hannah that they could have a problem if the boy went to his mother, but Hannah stated that she was more concerned with Starr's nosy boyfriend. Starr was happy to hear that Cole was worried, but Hannah said that she meant James.\n\n\nHannah needed Starr to cooperate or things wouldn't end well, she told her prisoner. Hobbling around on her bad ankle, Starr strongly demanded that she and Hope be allowed to leave. The little girl needed diapers and other necessities. Hannah leaned over and took Hope out of the playpen. She would see to it that Hope was taken care of, since Starr was complaining. \n\n\nStarr pleaded with Hannah not to take Hope away from her. She promised that she wouldn't do anything to try to escape. Starr wasn't sure what Hannah had planned for Hope, but she thought that it wasn't a good idea for Hannah to take the girl. Starr wondered how Hannah would explain the baby's presence.\n\n\nHannah thought about it for a second and handed Hope back to Starr. She would have to figure it out. She knew that Cole loved his daughter. First Starr complained about her daughter, and then she wanted her back, Hannah grumbled. After Hannah left, Starr spoke to Hope. She called Hannah crazy. \"What was she going to do with you?\" she asked her little girl. She thought maybe James would find them. No, she was certain that James would find them, she corrected herself.\n\n\nRoxy saw Rex when she arrived at the diner and told him about her impending photo shoot. A photographer was doing promo shots for her, she boasted. She gave him Echo's name, and Rex was very interested. He asked if Echo were in her room, but Roxy kept talking. He repeated the question several times and finally took off for the hotel.\n\n\nHannah returned to Marty's house. She looked at the baseball and decided that Cole would \"strike out\" in his search for any leads on Starr and Hope. Suddenly there was a knock at the door. She was surprised to see Ford. \"Looks like it's just you and me,\" he said.\n\n\nRex carried a bunch of towels and stood outside of Echo's room. He knocked on her door, and when there was no answer, let himself in. He began to search through the drawers and found the hidden box. He looked through it and was dumbfounded when he saw what it contained. He pulled out a necklace with half of a heart pendant.\n\n\nEcho showed up at Llanfair and saw Charlie. She was sorry about his son, she told him. She'd had no idea he'd had a grown son. She had something to talk to him about.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "James knows that Hannah is keeping a secret, very obsessed about Cole and might be the reason why she was not with Elijah Clark when he called Todd Manning and let him talk to Dani but not to Starr. He also finds it odd that Hannah got a hold of the bullet on the chain of his that was last in Starr's possession. He asks Robert if he believes that Hannah might have kidnapped Starr and baby Hope. Robert tells his brother anything is possible knowing Hannah. James is determined to get to the bottom of this but knows that Hannah won't tell him anything, knowing that he will get her in trouble if she has hurt Starr. But, he concludes, Robert might be able to get some answers out of Hannah if he goes to talk to her. Robert finally agrees to help his brother find this out and goes to visit Hannah when she returns to Marty's home. Starr and Hope are still stuck in Hannah's parents' empty home unable to get out or let anybody know where they are. Viki and Dorian talk about both of their history with Echo DiSavoy and they seem to want to help each protect each other from Echo. Meanwhile, Rex is investigating Echo for Viki and finds out that she is renting a room at Roxy's hotel. He goes to Angel Square and finds Echo's secret box that she has kept for many years. He notices how familiar it looks to him, opens it, and sees the very necklace chain that his unidentified biological mother left with him when he was born. After talking to Roxy and finding out about Charlie's son Jared's recent death, Echo goes to talk to Charlie to offer her condolences and tells him there's something very important she needs to tell him.",
