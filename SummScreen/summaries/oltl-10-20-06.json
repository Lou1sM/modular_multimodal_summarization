Asa was upstairs resting but Nigel clued them in to the fact that Emma Bradley was one of the great loves of Asa's life. Bo, Kevin, Kelly and Paige recalled all the crazy events that had happened on New Year's Eve, the night that Spencer left a photo of Emma in Asa's cabin. And they wondered if Spencer might indeed be a Buchanan. \n\n\nTodd paid Spencer a visit. He made it clear that he wasn't interested in his confession but was eager to know more about Spencer's vendetta against the Buchanans. \"Where's Mummy? Mummified?\" Todd said with glee. Todd also asked \"Where's my kid?\" Blair butt in and let Spencer know that they had moved back in together in the penthouse. Todd played along and the two pretended to be very connected. Spencer repeated that he didn't think the prosecution had a leg to stand on and he'd be out of jail soon. \"We'll see,\" Todd said. Todd pointed out that Spencer had some real serious father issues. \n\n\nEvangeline ran into Claudia at Rodi's. After a few niceties, Claudia asked how Cris was after the Nash altercation. Rex asked for a few minutes with Cris. He gave him the update on the conversation he'd had with Ted. Rex thought it would be hard to get Ted to go on the record. Antonio offered to help Cris find proof that the fight was rigged. Claudia was surprised to learn that Antonio left Nash alone with Jessica and the baby. Antonio told Claudia he wasn't concerned at all and that in fact had asked Nash to be in the wedding party, something Claudia thought was a bit odd. \n\n\nNeither Nash nor Jessica could believe Antonio's suggestion that Nash be in the wedding party. Nash said, \"it would just be too weird.\" Jessica didn't know what to say. Antonio added that as he's Bree's father, then he's part of this family. Nash and Jessica still thought it was weird, but Jessica eventually went along with it. Nash apologized for having kissed her at Rodi's and promised that it wouldn't happen again. Jessica apologized for having punched Claudia. Nash thought they should cut Claudia a little slack. Jessica waxed poetic about how wonderful Antonio is and Nash responded, \"You really like the dude.\" \n\n\nViki and Clint were both confused to be at Capricorn for a private party. \"Something's fishy going on here,\" Clint said. They wondered who might have set this up, but then decided to enjoy their delicious free meal. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Dorian tried to break out of the locked closet. She thought David was behind it, but we all know it was Adriana. Dorian had a meltdown behind the door, while Adriana stood outside with the key in hand. Adriana had a moment of charity and let Dorian out of the closet. Adriana then confessed to having locked her mother in the closet deliberately. Dorian asked Adriana how she could be so cruel. \"I learned everything about being cruel from you,\" she said. Dorian tried to say it was a mistake, the whole stalking charade. Adriana stormed out, \"I'm never going to forgive you for what you did.\" Dorian looked in the mirror. \"Oh my God, I can't possibly meet Clint looking like this,\" she said, and she ran up the stairs. She had to return to get her purse. Rex though Adriana was being a bit harsh to her mother. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The Buchanans are back at the house and Paige has come over as requested. Nigel goes to get Asa to have him tell if Spencer could possibly be his son. They have to be careful how they proceed with their query into Spencer's past as that could compromise the murder investigation. Todd has gone to the jailhouse. Todd tells her to get out. He knows that there is a rule that only one person can see a prisoner at a time and that is how he gets Blair escorted out of there. He asks Spencer if it is really true that he is Asa's son. \"Where is your mother? Did you off the old cow too? Is she mummified? By the way, where is my kid?\" Blair comes in while Todd is in there. She tells Spencer that she has moved back into the mansion with Todd and her kids. When she asks Todd to confirm that, he comes over to her and she and Todd kiss and nibble on each other's lips right up close to the bars so that Truman can see. He isn't unaffected, feeling that Blair is just doing this because she still wants him as much as he wants her. He promises to show her how much he loves her when he gets out. Adriana stands by and listens as her mother screams in terror over being locked in the closet. Dorian really has a meltdown inside. She cries and screams and claws at the tiny lit space under the door. She even thinks that David is doing this but he doesn't answer her screams. Adriana hears that her mother is getting really terrified and finally she lets her out of the closet. The sight of Adriana brings relief to Dorian's face. They go to the stairs and Dorian falls to the ground. \"I was here the whole time mom. I was the one who locked you in the closet!\" Dorian can' believe this. What she did was a mistake but Adriana knows about Dorian's upbringing and this was an intentional act to hurt her. Adriana says she refuses to feel guilty about this and she runs out. Antonio pushes and finally Nash agrees to be a part of the wedding for Bree's sake. Jessica worries about it though as she knows that the whole time, Nash is going to be thinking that this should have been his wedding with Tess. Claudia is the club when Antonio comes in to pick up his order. \"Wow that's a lot of food.\" Antonio tells he is having Nash over for dinner. \"And you left him with Jessica?\" After she learns that Nash is going to be in the wedding, she orders the best vodka the club has with rocks Todd wants to know where his kid is. He toys with the idea of hiring someone to get in the jail and beat Spencer to pieces. \"I promise you, if you beat these charges and get out, I will kill you.\" Blair tells Spencer that she will kill him if Todd doesn't.",
