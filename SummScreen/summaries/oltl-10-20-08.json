Gigi pleaded with her friend to help her find out where Adriana had taken Rex. Marcie said that she didn't have any access to Rex's medical records, but noticed Michael approaching and believed he could provide them with some information. As Marcie listened, Gigi begged Mike to tell her where Adriana had moved Rex. Gigi told Mike that Rex would want to see her and Shane if he were able to communicate. Initially Mike refused to give Gigi any information on Rex's whereabouts, but had a change of heart when Gigi questioned how he would react to losing the love of his life. Staring at Marcie, Mike gave Gigi clues to Rex's location. After Mike explained that patients in Rex's condition were generally moved closer to home, Gigi quickly surmised that Adriana had taken Rex to La Boulaie. \n\n\nJohn and Blair arrived in time to see chaos erupt at Llanview Airport. When Dorian noticed the hit man draw his gun, she screamed and directed John's attention to the hired killer. The gunman pointed his weapon at Ray, but John fired a shot at him and the assassin's gun fell to the ground. Spotting the weapon, Vanessa picked up the gun and shot Ray. Everyone watched in horror as a badly wounded Ray fell to the floor. As Talia ran to Ray's aid, Antonio placed Vanessa under arrest for the shooting, and John subdued the gunman. While everyone appeared shaken by the act of violence, Blair and John both noticed Dorian's calm demeanor. Standing over Ray's body, Dorian asked the officers if he were dead. \n\n\nLangston wanted to check on her uncle, but Markko advised her to keep her distance. Langston, Markko, Starr, and Cole tried to make sense of the situation. Surprised that Ray didn't tell her that he was married, Langston wondered why his wife would try to kill him. When her friends showed little remorse over Ray's shooting, Langston reminded them that he was her uncle and didn't deserve to be shot. While they waited for an ambulance to arrive, Talia tried her best to stop Ray's bleeding, but worried that he might not pull through. Upon hearing Talia's statement, Vanessa remarked that she was glad. Talia warned Vanessa that she might be charged with murder if the ambulance didn't arrive in time. \n\n\nShocked by Vanessa's reaction to Ray, Cris asked her what had made her do such a thing. Stating that she feared Ray might hurt Lola, Vanessa did not look upset. John questioned the hit man, but he refused to speak to John without his lawyer being present. After the gunman had been taken into custody, John approached Vanessa and demanded answers. Defending Vanessa, Cris told John that Vanessa was running away from Ray and had obviously gone into shock after spotting him at the airport. Neither, Antonio or John appeared sympathetic towards Vanessa's ordeal. Realizing that she would be separated from Lola, Vanessa asked Cris to take care of the child. Cris promised to look after Lola while Vanessa was in custody. When Antonio told Vanessa that she would be transported to the police station, Lola begged to come along. Antonio agreed to take Lola to the police station with him, and Cris and Sarah followed. When the ambulance arrived, Talia accompanied Ray to the hospital. \n\n\nAfter checking on the teens, Blair told them to stay put while she spoke with Dorian. Blair questioned what role Dorian had in the shooting. Appearing at ease, Dorian denied any involvement. Dorian evaded Blair's questioning, and insisted on checking on Langston. Expressing her sympathy over Langston witnessing the horrible event, Dorian suggested that they head home. John approached and informed Dorian that he wanted to question her at the police station. Showing little concern, Dorian told Langston that Ray was obviously an unfit guardian and promised to regain custody of Langston in the morning. Dorian asked Blair to take Langston and Starr to La Boulaie while she answered John's questions at the police station. Blair, Starr, and Cole left. Langston and Markko decided to head home on their own. When Markko announced that the nightmare was finally over, Langston disagreed. Confiding in Markko, Langston told him that she feared that Dorian expected the gunman to show up at the airport. Insisting that she needed to see Dorian, Langston asked Markko to take her to the police station to check on her foster mother. Markko obliged. \n\n\nAt the police station, Antonio told Cris about his suspicions concerning Vanessa. Convinced that Vanessa knew that Montez was in Llanview, Antonio believed that she had tricked Cris into bring her to town to find him. Certain that Vanessa and Lola were terrified of Ray, Cris refused to believe that Vanessa would come to Llanview in search of him. When Antonio informed Vanessa that she would remain in custody until her arraignment, Lola expressed her fears to her stepmother. Lola worried that they would face troubles because they were alone in a strange country. Vanessa assured Lola that they would be fine. As Antonio escorted Vanessa to her cell, Cris promised Lola that he would take care of her and everything would be resolved. \n\n\nLangston and Markko arrived at the police station. Introducing herself to Lola, Langston told the young girl that they were cousins. \n\n\nIn John's office, John questioned Dorian about what she had witnessed at the airport. Dorian was vague and provided John with limited information. During the questioning, John was interrupted by an officer who had brought him information regarding the gunman. After viewing the information, John asked Dorian if she was aware that the gunman was a contract killer, and questioned how far Dorian would go to keep Langston. When Dorian continued to deny any involvement in Ray's shooting, John threatened to bring in Jackie McNaughton for questioning. Certain that Jackie would not expose their relationship, Dorian didn't appear worried. Dorian exploded when John informed her that she would be held until he had the opportunity to question Jackie. \n\n\nRelaxing at home, Todd and Marty pondered possible names for Starr's unborn child. Marty stunned Todd when she suggested the name Patrick. Before he could respond, Janet entered the room and suggested the name Cole. When Marty explained that the name Cole bothered Todd, Janet insisted on knowing why. Annoyed with Janet, Todd asked her to join him in another room and offered to explain his reasons. \n\n\nAlone with Janet, Todd questioned what she was up to. Showing him information that she had obtained from the Internet, Janet condemned Todd for keeping Marty in the dark about Cole. Appalled that Todd would keep Marty estranged from her son and allow him to believe that she was dead, Janet informed Todd that she also knew about the rape. When Janet told Todd that he was hurting Marty because she was falling in love with him, Todd stated that he was falling in love with her, as well, and saw nothing wrong with what he has doing. Todd tried to convince Janet that he was a changed man, but Janet continued to express her disgust with Todd. Fed up with Janet's sudden moral conscience, Todd reminded her of her stint as Ramsey's employee. When Janet tried to defend her actions, Todd shocked her when he revealed that he was aware that she was actually Lee Halprin. Handing Janet a check, Todd advised her to keep quiet or else he would reveal her identity to her past victims. A cornered Janet reluctantly accepted Todd's check and agreed to remain silent. \n\n\nTodd resumed his conversation with Marty. Concerned about Todd's state of mind after being reminded of the name Cole, Marty promised him that no child of hers would ever be named \"Cole.\" Todd seemed satisfied with Marty's declaration. \n\n\nLater, a troubled Janet had flashbacks of her conversation with John. She remembered John's warning that Todd had hurt Marty in the past and John's pleas for Janet to help an innocent woman escape Todd's clutches. Trembling, Janet placed a call to John. When John answered, Janet panicked and hung up the phone. \n\n\nStarr and Cole stood outside of La Boulaie. Starr thanked Cole for protecting her and Langston at the airport. When Cole revealed to Starr the panic he felt for her and the baby, Starr told him about the contractions she had experienced and informed him that the baby might come earlier than expected. An emotional Cole thanked Starr for keeping him updated on the baby's progress. Starr told him that he was still the baby's father and had a right to all information regarding the child. When Cole expressed his displeasure over returning to the Buchanan Mansion and encountering Clint, Starr suggested that he stay with his friends at La Boulaie. \n\n\nBlair returned to La Boulaie and discovered Adriana, a staff of nurses, and an unconscious Rex camped out in the living room. Blair appeared to have some compassion for Adriana's situation, but wondered if her cousin had taken Rex out of the hospital primarily out of revenge for Gigi. Blair reminded Adriana that if Rex ever recovered, he would want to be with Gigi. Upset with Blair's statements, Adriana insisted on being left alone with her husband. Alone with Rex, Adriana pleaded with him to come back to her and promised him that no one would ever come between them again. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Gigi attempted to get more information out of Mike, but was interrupted when Ray was rushed into the hospital. As Mike worked on Ray, Talia asked if he would be okay. Mike didn't have an answer for her. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Gigi panicked after learning Rex was at La Boulaie. She feared that she would never see him again because she could never gain access to the mansion. Marcie asked Gigi how badly she wanted to see Rex. Gigi said that she would do anything to see him again. Marcie came up with a plan that would get Gigi inside of La Boulaie. Marcie explained her scheme to Gigi. Reminding Marcie that she was in the process of adopting Starr's baby, Gigi worried that Marcie's plan might cause a problem. Marcie was convinced that they could carry out the plan without any problem. Stating that Marcie's plan was crazy, Gigi believed that it just might work.\n\n\n",
