Destiny hoped that Matthew would be walking the next time that she saw him.  As Rachel approached, she overheard Destiny.  When Destiny ended the call, Rachel asked how Matthew was.  Destiny admitted that she hadn't spoken to Matthew since he had left for Seattle.  Rachel and Destiny's conversation turned to Shaun.  Rachel smiled nervously when Destiny confessed that Shaun hadn't stopped talking about Rachel.\n\n\nIn Shaun's room, Greg checked his brother's vitals while their parents hovered nearby.  Shaun was eager to be discharged, so that he could spend time with Rachel.  Mr. and Mrs. Evans confided that Rachel seemed to have eyes only for Shaun.  Greg took exception to his family's observations about Rachel; he reminded everyone that Rachel and Shaun were not exactly engaged.  Shaun was surprised by Greg's comment.\n\n\nRachel and Destiny entered the room just as Shaun wondered if he had competition for Rachel's affection.  Destiny immediately eased Shaun's concerns by claiming that Rachel was only interested in Shaun.  Rachel smiled, but didn't respond.  Moments later, Rachel noted that Shaun appeared to have plenty of visitors, so she excused herself.  As Greg prepared to follow Rachel, Shaun requested that his brother ask Rachel to return.\n\n\nIn the hallway, Greg tried to talk to Rachel about what had happened between them.  Rachel had a flashback of her heated encounter with Greg in the hotel room, but she didn't want to talk about it.  Rachel was relieved when Mrs. Evans stepped out of Shaun's room to ask Greg for a moment of his time.  Before Greg could object, Rachel quickly excused herself and then walked away.\n\n\nGreg was shocked when his mother suddenly slapped him across the face and then ordered him to leave Shaun's girlfriend alone.  Greg told his mother that he couldn't help the way that he felt about Rachel.  Mrs. Evans countered that Greg could control how he acted on those feelings.  She made it clear that she expected Greg to stay away from Rachel.\n\n\nRachel walked up just in time to hear Greg ask his mother what if Rachel didn't want him to stay away from her.  Rachel ignored the question as she asked if everything was okay.  Mrs. Evans assured Rachel that they were fine and then invited Rachel to visit with Shaun.  After Rachel entered Shaun's room, Greg asked his mother if she had noticed Rachel's reaction.\n\n\nGreg revealed that Rachel had intended to break off her relationship with Shaun the night that Shaun had been shot.  Mrs. Evans suggested that Shaun might have changed Rachel's mind.  However, it didn't matter to her because Greg could not be with the woman that his brother was in love with.\n\n\nIn Shaun's room, Destiny warned her brother to stop pressuring Rachel.  Destiny pointed out that Shaun was rushing things by talking about how much he loved Rachel.  Destiny feared that it might push Rachel away.  Mr. Evans agreed with Destiny.  Moments later, Rachel entered the room.  Mr. Evans took the opportunity to show Shaun the medal that the city had awarded Shaun for his bravery and self-sacrifice during Starr and Hope's rescue.\n\n\nWhen Mrs. Evans returned to Shaun's room, she noticed Destiny huddled in a corner on the phone.  Destiny revealed that she had called the hospital to check on Matthew.  Destiny had been informed that Matthew's surgery had been canceled.  Destiny was worried because she had not been able to reach Matthew.  Rachel appeared equally concerned about her family.\n\n\nNora knocked on Kevin's front door, while Matthew grumbled that his parents had kidnapped him, in order to circumvent his decision to have spinal surgery.  Nora and Bo didn't apologize for their tactics.  Moments later, Kevin greeted his family.  As Kevin ushered them into the house, he explained that Joey and Cord were in Beijing on business.  Meanwhile, Kelly had taken Zane to preschool.  Matthew remained sullen when he realized that Kevin was aware of Nora and Bo's deception.\n\n\nLater, Matthew tried to call the United States, but didn't know how to make an overseas phone call.  Nora snatched the phone away from Matthew as she explained that he wouldn't be allowed to make any calls until she could trust him.  Matthew couldn't believe his mother had the gall to talk to him about trust, given her betrayal.  When Matthew threatened to tell Kevin about Nora and Bo's kiss, Nora accused Matthew of acting out of spite.  By comparison, she was motivated by concern.\n\n\nKevin and Bo returned from a walk a short time later.  Kevin admitted that it had been difficult for him to see Matthew in a wheelchair.  However, Kevin offered to talk to Matthew on Bo's behalf.  Bo appreciated Kevin's support.  Kevin wanted to help in any way that he could because he didn't want Bo and Matthew to have the same strained relationship that Kevin had with Duke.\n\n\nWhen Kevin and Bo entered the living room, Nora announced that Matthew had something to say.  Matthew hesitated a moment and then apologized for his surly attitude when they had first arrived.  Kevin accepted the apology and then offered to take Matthew out for dinner.  Matthew declined the invitation, but he suggested that Kevin ask Bo and Nora to join him, since they seemed to enjoy each other's company more than they did their son's.\n\n\nLater, Kevin sought Matthew out for a private chat.  Neither realized that Bo lurked nearby, listening. When Kevin explained that Bo was afraid of losing Matthew, Matthew revealed that it was too late.  Bo was losing Matthew by blocking the surgery.\n\n\nViki found Charlie at the Buchanan lodge.  Charlie was desperate to find a clue that might help him to locate Jared.  Viki promised that she would use the Banner to help Jared if it were necessary.  Charlie felt terrible that Jared's trouble had affected Viki's campaign.  Viki assured her husband that everything would work out.  As they left the lodge, reporters besieged them.   One of the reporters wondered if Viki would use the mayor's office to impede the murder investigation.\n\n\nCharlie insisted that his son had not murdered anyone.  Viki reminded the reporter that people were considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, Natalie and Clint waited for word on Jared.  Natalie wanted John to search for evidence that Jared had been framed, but John refused to discuss the case with Natalie. John explained that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to update her about the investigation because she was the suspect's wife.   Natalie was upset, so Clint guided her away from John, in order to calm her down.\n\n\nOliver approached John to volunteer his help.  John appreciated Oliver's offer, but he insisted that Oliver had to turn in his gun and badge.  John explained that Oliver was on temporary leave because of the lawsuit that Elijah had filed on Ross's behalf.  Oliver couldn't believe that an officer who had recently received a medal of commendation would be suspended over a false allegation.   Oliver was concerned that an Internal Affairs investigation would delve into his personal life, including his sexuality.\n\n\nJohn didn't think that Oliver's personal life would be an issue, but he promised that he had Oliver's back.  Later, as Oliver prepared to leave the station, a fellow officer mentioned that the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 was hosting a charity dinner for the homeless.  Oliver decided to head to the diner to volunteer his services.\n\n\nNora called Clint to let him know that she had arrived in England.  Clint was disappointed when Nora admitted that she wasn't certain how long she would be away from home.  A short time after Clint ended his call with Nora, Viki and Charlie arrived at the police station.   Everyone was stunned when John suggested that Jared might have killed Pamela out of revenge.\n\n\nJohn reminded Natalie and her family that Jared had turned up in Llanview to exact revenge.  Natalie insisted that all of that was ancient history; Jared had married Natalie and built a life with her.  Natalie wondered what reason Jared would have for destroying all of that.  Meanwhile, Charlie argued that Jared had cared about Pamela.  John pointed out that it wouldn't have been the first time that Jared had hurt someone that he had claimed to love.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Amelia and Nick discussed what they intended to do next.  Amelia was eager to begin phase two of their plans.  As he approached the table, Kyle overheard Amelia.  When he asked what phase two was, Amelia responded, \"You are.\"  Amelia left it to Nick to explain her cryptic comments.  After Amelia departed, Nick told Kyle that they intended to invite other gay couples to join Dorian and Amelia for a mass wedding.\n\n\nKyle was surprised when Nick expressed his desire to \"get hitched.\"  Kyle reminded Nick that they'd only been dating for a short time.  Nick questioned if Kyle believed in the right for gay couples to get married.  Kyle clarified that he did, but that he also believed that people should marry for the right reasons.  Nick was curious if Kyle would have objected if Oliver had proposed marriage to him.\n\n\nKyle made it clear that he was committed to Nick, not Oliver.  Nick beamed with joy.  Nick realized that the marriage ceremony would be symbolic; however, he thought that it was an important stance for them to take, so that they would have the option to get married in the future.  Kyle relented, prompting Nick to get down on bended knee, in order to officially propose.  Kyle agreed to marry Nick just as Oliver entered the diner.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian sifted through various samples of wedding invitations when David entered the parlor.  David griped that it was humiliating for him to explain that his ex-wife suddenly preferred women to men.  Dorian was unmoved by David's plight; she insisted that she would marry Amelia.  Langston and Starr entered in time to object to Dorian's wedding plans.  Langston and Starr refused to allow Dorian to perpetrate a fraud on the public in order to garner votes.\n\n\nDorian insisted that she was a lesbian, but Langston and Starr saw through her lies.  Langston threatened to reveal the truth to the media if Dorian didn't drop her pretense.  David agreed that it wasn't really necessary for Dorian to continue her lie, because Viki's campaign was in jeopardy thanks to the two murder charges that Jared was facing.  Dorian appeared to waver just as Amelia walked in.  Amelia warned that Dorian would be seen as a liar and a quitter if she called off the wedding.  Amelia assured Dorian that Viki would win the election.\n\n\nTo Langston and Starr's disappointment, Dorian resolved to go through with the wedding.  Amelia took the opportunity to suggest that they invite other gay couples to get married alongside of them.  To everyone's surprise, Dorian readily agreed.   Langston was disappointed by Dorian's decision.  Dorian wanted Langston's support, but Langston refused.  After Langston walked out, Dorian confidently assured Amelia and David that Langston would change her mind.\n\n\nDavid informed Dorian that he refused to allow her to go through with the marriage.\n\n\n",
