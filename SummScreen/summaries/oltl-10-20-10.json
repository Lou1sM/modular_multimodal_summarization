She noticed that Gigi had sketched the broken heart necklace that had belonged to Rex's mysterious parents, Rick and Lili.  Gigi said she had done it from memory, because the original necklace was gone for good.  Viki applauded Gigi for going back to school and following her dreams, but Gigi promised to still make time for Viki and her friends.\n\n\nAs Viki picked up her food and left the cafe, she passed Cristian at the lunch counter, where he wrapped up a bittersweet international call with Layla.  Layla was unable to make it back to Llanview on short notice, but a crestfallen Cris promised her they would be reunited soon.  He hung up just in time to greet Markko.  Markko told Cris that his father was recovering from his surgery, and Cris asked if that meant Markko would be heading back to California.  Markko said he would stick around Llanview to support Cole until Starr and Hope were found.\n\n\nCristian asked Markko if Cole and the girls were his only reason for staying in town, and wondered if he might be staying to reconnect with Langston.  Markko said that he still had mixed feelings for Langston, but they weren't reuniting.  He revealed that he was seeing Karen the pizza girl, who he had driven to California with.  He told Cristian that he and Langston had too much baggage between them, and added that a long-distance relationship divided between Llanview and California could never work out.  Cristian's face fell as Markko went on and on about the futility of a long-distance romance.\n\n\nGigi sidled up to the two and urgently told Markko to pipe down, but the damage was done and Cris shuffled off to the lunch counter, dejected.  Gigi informed Markko that Cristian and Layla were separated by a continent and attempting to make things work.  Markko was mortified by his social blunder, while Cris brooded alone at the counter.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Charlie told Echo she was visiting at a bad time, as he wasn't thinking of himself or Jared, but rather focusing on Starr and Hope.  Echo begged to differ, and said she knew he thought of Jared every day.  She told Charlie she understood his loss, and believed she could help ease his pain.  She assured him she didn't want to draw him back to the bottle; instead, she had something important to tell him.\n\n\nEcho grew emotional as she struggled to find the words to tell Charlie her secret.  \"How bad could it be?\" Charlie asked.  Echo said it wasn't bad -- well, some of it was bad, but she had to get it out, even if she knew Viki would be angry.  As she retreated into the drawing room, Charlie pushed Echo to vent her conscience.  Echo began to tell Charlie her story, but before she could find the words, Viki walked into the room with a simple message for her adversary: \"Get out of my house.\"\n\n\nViki ordered Echo out of her home for the second time in as many weeks.  Echo begged for a moment to tell Charlie her story, but Viki wasn't having it.  \"I'm sorry, Charlie,\" Echo mumbled tearfully. \"Sorrier than you know.\"  She hurried out of Llanfair with Viki on her heels.\n\n\nViki was furious that Echo was continually invading their lives.  Charlie attempted to calm her nerves, and said that Echo seemed to have something important to tell him.  \"Oh, that's Echo's game,\" Viki scoffed, and said that Echo had given Clint the same mysterious routine to get him into bed and take revenge on him for her mother.  \"She has an agenda and you are at the top of her list,\" Viki proclaimed.\n\n\nViki told Charlie that Rex was still searching for information on Echo, but had already turned up evidence of one lie: Echo had returned to Llanview not long after she had promised to leave forever.  Charlie suggested that Echo's speeding ticket was due only by her passing through town, but Viki suspected something more sinister.  Charlie reminded Viki that Echo hadn't caused any trouble in Llanview during her brief return, and said that Echo's dirty deeds were years past.  \"Echoes have a way of repeating themselves,\" Viki warned.  Charlie suggested they drop the subject, and focus on something present in their lives -- their love for each other.  With that, he kissed her and led her upstairs to bed.\n\n\nAt Roxy's, Rex searched Echo's apartment and was stunned to find one-half of his parents' broken-heart necklace.  \"What's Echo DiSavoy doing with it?\" he wondered aloud.  Remembering that he had left Lili's half of the necklace at her gravesite in New Mexico, he wondered if Echo's half had belonged to his unknown father.  He quickly snapped a photo of the necklace and began replacing items to erase signs of his intrusion, but was caught red-handed when Echo returned unexpectedly.\n\n\nEcho demanded to know what Rex was doing in her room, and Rex bluffed that he was cleaning the wrong room by mistake.  \"It's Rex, right?\" Echo asked, believing him to be a friend of Clint's.  Rex said he was no friend of Clint's, only Roxy's son who helped out around the hotel.  When Echo noted no resemblance between Rex and Roxy, he admitted he wasn't Roxy's biological child.  Echo snapped that it sounded like a lovely tale, but she wanted him out, and swiftly showed him the door.\n\n\nOnce Rex left, Echo rushed to her dresser, reopening the drawer Rex had just closed, and clutched the mysterious box she hid amongst her belongings.\n\n\nRex raced to the Buenos Dias, where he showed Gigi his new picture of the necklace.  He told her he had found it in Echo's hotel room, and was sure it was the other half of Lili's broken-heart necklace.  \"Echo knew my father,\" he mused. \"Maybe she still does.\"  Gigi wondered if Rick had given Echo his half of the necklace, and Rex said he hadn't asked Echo about it because he didn't expect a truthful answer.  Instead, he was going back to New Mexico to see if anyone who knew Rick and Lili recognized Echo's picture.\n\n\nGigi told Rex to be careful, and not get his hopes up for answers in the Southwest.  Rex said that if he came up empty, he would return to town and confront Echo directly, with Lili's half of the necklace.  \"You'll end up finding your father after all,\" Gigi assured him.\n\n\nAt the lunch counter, Markko apologized to Cristian for his insensitive remarks.  He was sure Cris and Layla would stand the test of time and distance, unlike himself and Langston.  He was concerned that Langston hadn't called him with news about Starr's disappearance, and feared they had no leads.\n\n\nAt the O'Connor house, Starr and Hope remained Hannah's prisoners in her darkened attic.  Starr comforted Hope and set her down in the abandoned crib, musing aloud about how she hoped that James would tell Cole about Hannah before Hannah could get to Cole.  As she worried about all the possibilities, she lay down under her jacket and began to doze off.\n\n\nSoon, Starr began to dream of Cole and Hannah together, with Cole believing Starr had died.  As Hannah comforted Cole with a kiss, Starr tossed and turned in the real world.  She called out to Cole, insisting she was alive, and Cole pulled away from Hannah's embrace.  But soon, he began to rage about James, and Hannah told him Starr hadn't loved him the way she did.  Cole and Hannah kissed again and sank onto the couch, as Starr rushed into the room.  She screamed to Cole that she wasn't dead, but right beside him.\n\n\nAs Starr's pleas to Cole fell on deaf ears, James walked up behind her.  \"I see you, Starr,\" he murmured, holding her in his arms.  He pulled her away from Cole and Hannah, just as Cole told Hannah he couldn't give up on Starr.  Advancing on Starr, Cole told her how much he loved her.  Starr found herself caught between James and Cole's declarations of love, and put her hands to her ears, trapped.\n\n\nStarr awoke with a start, alone with Hope in the attic.  Hearing Hope's cries, Starr rushed to the baby's side and cradled her, singing her a lullaby.\n\n\nAs Starr sang, across town another scene played out.  At the Angel Square Hotel, Echo retrieved her half of the broken-heart necklace, and put it around her neck, fighting tears.\n\n\nCole arrived at James's apartment, ready to apologize for his behavior at the police station.  He knew it wasn't James's fault Starr and Hope were missing, and said Eli was the only one to blame.  James wasn't so sure, and asked Cole if Hannah might be a consideration.  Cole said Hannah had been Eli's victim, but had changed and become a different person.  \"Yeah, I think so too,\" James said, skeptical.\n\n\nCole told James that they both cared about Starr, and needed to put aside their differences and work together to save her.  James agreed and said they needed to make a plan, but before he could go further, Cole noticed the bullet necklace on the kitchen counter.  James apologized for Cole having found it at his and Starr's apartment, and was surprised when Cole didn't understand.  Remembering Hannah's explanation about the necklace, James was floored when Cole said he had thought Starr had the necklace last.  Realizing Hannah had lied, James stayed mum as Cole concluded that Starr had left the necklace with him.\n\n\nJames claimed he had no ideas on how to find Starr, and Cole admitted to drawing a blank as well.  He thanked James for giving it a shot and prepared to leave, but James stopped him and told him that Eli hadn't killed Starr or Hope.  \"You sound pretty sure,\" Cole muttered as he walked out the door. \"Hope you're right.\"\n\n\nAt Marty's house, Ford greeted Hannah and questioned her about the baseball in her hand.  Before she could speak, Ford was surprised to see Langston walk up to the front door and ask him what he was doing there.  Thinking fast, Ford feigned interest in getting another chance with Hannah.  Both girls were shocked as Ford told Hannah that Langston had led him astray, and that he hadn't known how good he'd had it with the lovely Ms. O'Connor.  Langston listened in outrage as Ford suggested to Hannah that the two of them give it another shot, as they were unattached and available.\n\n\nBefore Hannah could speak, Marty called.  While Hannah took the call in the other room, Ford turned to face the disgusted Langston.  Ford quickly told her he hadn't meant a word, and that there was no time to explain; he needed her to leave and give him time alone with Hannah.  Ford begged Langston to trust him, and said he was doing it for Starr and Hope.  He asked her to go to James and question his brother, and Langston agreed, admitting that she did trust him.\n\n\nAs Hannah returned to the room, Ford and Langston faked a loud argument, concluding as Langston stormed out of the house.  Ford resumed his hard sell with Hannah, and said that Eli would never have ruined their lives if they had known what they had together.  Hannah told Ford that they couldn't happen again because of Cole, but Ford reminded her that Cole wasn't available.  \"We have a very special relationship,\" Hannah insisted, and Ford told her that Cole was tied to Starr forever, just as Langston had been to Markko -- as long as Starr was in the picture, Hannah could never have Cole.  \"What if she wasn't?\" Hannah asked, turning cold.\n\n\nFord played dumb, and told Hannah that Eli would be apprehended, and Starr would be rescued, therefore Hannah could never have a chance with Cole.  \"Wanna bet?\" Hannah snapped.  Just then, Cole arrived, and Hannah flung herself into his arms.  Cole was disquieted to see Ford on the scene, and Ford quickly left.\n\n\nCole asked Hannah why Ford had stopped by, and Hannah laughed as she recounted Ford's reunion proposal.  She was glad he had tried, as it proved she was over him.  \"I'm holding out for the right guy,\" she declared. \"Like you told me.\"  Cole couldn't get over Starr's disappearance, and Hannah reassured him that Starr was still alive -- \"I'm sure of it.\"  Hannah said she had a good feeling that everything would work out the way it was supposed to.\n\n\nLangston headed to the Ford brothers' apartment and got filled in by James on Ford's attempt to catch Hannah in the act.  She and James compared notes on their recent encounters with Hannah, and Langston concluded that they had to tell Cole about their suspicions.  James convinced her to wait, as he feared Cole would lose it and confront Hannah, which could put Starr in danger.  Ford returned to the apartment and updated the duo on his conversation with Hannah, who he said hadn't seemed surprised that there was no news on Starr.  \"Hannah knows exactly where Starr is,\" he proclaimed.\n\n\nIn her attic prison, Starr put Hope back to bed in her crib.  \"Cole, please find us,\" she whispered. \"James, someone...help us.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr and Hope are trapped in a dark house. Starr hopes Hannah doesn't get to Cole before James's tells him his suspicions about Hannah. Starr dreams about Cole being with Hannah after Hannah kills her. Cole apologizes to James for going off on him in the police station and says he realizes the only person responsible for Starr and Hope being missing is Eli Clark. James isn't so sure that's true. Cole suggests that they work together in spite of not liking each other. James thinks that's a good idea. Cole wonders how James got his necklace back. Ford asks Hannah if they can give their relationship another chance. Hearing that, Langston says Ford is still the same dog he has always been. When Hannah leaves the room, Ford tells Langston that he didn't mean anything that she heard, that there is no time to explain, and that he needs Langston to leave him alone with Hannah. He tells her to go see James, so she goes to Ford's apartment and asks James what's going on. Hannah tells Ford that she won't give him another chance because she wants Cole. Ford tells her that she doesn't have a chance with Cole because of Starr. She asks him what if Starr weren't in the picture. Cole arrives so Ford leaves. Ford goes back to his apartment and tells Langston and James that Hannah wants Starr out of the way, so she can have Cole. He says Hannah didn't ask Cole about Starr and he is sure that that is because she already knows where Starr is. Markko runs into Cris as Cris is ending a phone call with Layla. Cris wonders if Markko is going back to CA when his father is out of hospital. Markko says he is going to stay in Llanview for Cole and Starr, but that he isn't getting back together with Langston. He says long distance relationships never work. He later recants after Gigi tells him that Cris is in a long distance relationship because Layla lives in Paris now. Viki is impressed with Gigi's artistic talent when she sees Gigi's drawing of Rex's mother's half-heart necklace. While looking through Echo's hotel room, Rex wonders why she has the other half-heart necklace that had belonged to his father. Echo goes to see Charlie at Llanfair and says she has something important to tell him but Viki throws her out before she can say it. Viki tells Charlie that Echo has an agenda. Charlie asks her if Rex has found out anything about Echo's agenda. Echo returns to her room while Rex is still there. He picks up a stack of towels that he brought with him and tells her that his mother owns the motel and he is helping her out. She says he doesn't look like Roxy. He suggests that he might look like his father but doesn't know because he never met him. After Rex leaves, Echo puts on the necklace and cries. Rex goes to Rodi's and shows Gigi the picture of the necklace. He says he is going back to New Mexico and will show Echo's picture around.",
