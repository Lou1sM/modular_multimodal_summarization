And right then, he gets a call from Cutter who now has the \"document\" allegedly signed by Rex giving Clint back everything, which Kim previously had but no longer has control over since she's in jail. He tells Clint that he can help him get back everything that Rex has taken in exchange for a percentage of it. Clint is curious to find out about the document and goes to discuss it with Rex. He is surprised to learn that his son no longer wants to fight for control of Clint's money and doesn't even care where the document comes from. he declares that his desire for money and power after Gigi died made him turn his back on his son so he no longer wants or needs it. Clint is surprised and willing to let Rex and Shane stay at his home although he no longer has to. And Cutter is now \"down and out\" with neither Rex nor Clint to help him with his blackmail geared toward the other. The mayor threatens to fire Bo if he does not do things her way, but he is not afraid knowing that doing that could hurt her election. Tom\u00e1s holds firm on taking the rap for Todd although Blair is very upset that he would throw his life away and end any chance they could have together. Yet, feeling responsible for what happened to Todd for the last 8 years, he believes that it's the \"right thing to do.\""
