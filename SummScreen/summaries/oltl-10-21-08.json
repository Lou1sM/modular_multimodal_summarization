    "soap_central": "\nMissing Persons\n\n\nAt the police station, Langston and Markko greeted Lola, and Langston introduced herself to Lola as her cousin. Langston reassured Lola that Ray would be all right, but Lola said, \"I hope not.\" She told the teens that her father was a murderer who had killed her mother, and said that Vanessa was all she had in the world. \"He can rot in hell for all I care!\" Lola cried. She was despondent to learn that Vanessa would not be released that night, and feared she had nowhere to go. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Marcie and Gigi rushed past Charlie and headed up to Marcie's apartment to plot how to get into La Boulaie. Preoccupied, Charlie continued speaking to someone on the phone, telling them he'd try anything to get Viki back. Just then, Roxy stormed in, furious about Adriana having moved Rex from the hospital without alerting any of his friends or family. She raged to Charlie about Adriana's inconsiderate behavior, but grew melancholy as she reflected on her own parenting history, concluding that she deserved the heartache for how she'd raised-or failed to raise-her son. Gigi and Marcie returned to the lobby just in time to refute Roxy's argument; Gigi told Roxy and Charlie that they'd all made mistakes, especially herself, but that they could not stand around feeling sorry for themselves while Rex was missing. Instead, Gigi said, \"I'm gonna do something.\" She opened her coat, revealing a makeshift nurse's uniform. Marcie explained to Charlie and Roxy that they were going to send Gigi in to La Boulaie posing as one of Rex's private nurses, while Marcie ran interference. Roxy and Charlie cast a dubious eye upon Gigi's attire, and Roxy told her plainly that her disguise sucked. As Roxy ran her hands over Gigi's hair, she told her that all she needed to \"complete the look\" was \"the Foxy Roxy touch.\" \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki and Bo were surprised by \"Jessica\" and Bree's sudden disappearing act. Bo was convinced that Tess was indeed at large, and that she was also responsible for Jared and Natalie going missing. He told Viki that if one of them found mother and child, they had to separate Bree from Tess as quickly as possible. Viki didn't want to believe that Tess was out, but realized there were few other conclusions. Viki suggested asking Tina if she'd seen Tess, and asked Bo to give Tina credit for having grown up over the years; she believed Tina had the family's best interests at heart. Suddenly, Bo was called away to the police station regarding the Montez case. Before he left, Bo asked Viki to give Charlie a call, as well, in case he had a lead on Jared. \n\n\nIn the study, Tina texted back and forth furiously with Cain, who taunted her with pictures of \"Princess David Vickers\" blindfolded, or held over a pot of water. Cain demanded Tina retrieve the crown jewels, and threatened to send little \"DV\" to meet \"Davy Jones -- and I don't mean the Monkee.\" Anxious, Tina struggled to get the wall safe open, just in time for Viki to walk in and ask her what she was up to. Tina covered, saying that her beloved dog had been \"dognapped\"--while neglecting to mention Cain--and claimed she was looking for a weapon. Viki suggested that the dog was merely lost somewhere on the property, and asked Tina if she'd seen Jessica, or perhaps Tess. Tina said she hadn't seen her lately, and fluffed off Viki's questions about Jessica's strange behavior. She apologized, saying she was preoccupied with finding her beloved pooch, and as she hurried off to search for Cain and David Vickers, she promised to help Viki as soon as she returned. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr convinced Cole to spend the night at her house as just a friend. As they entered the house, they went over the day's events, and expressed their relief that Langston had not had to go away to Colombia. Starr said she hoped Ray either went back to prison, or worse, was left a vegetable so he could not take custody of his niece. \n\n\nIn the drawing room, Adriana sat at Rex's bedside, thumbing through old scrapbooks and their wedding album, retelling their past to her comatose husband. Adriana swore to Rex that they would be happy again, and that when he awoke they would start over as husband and wife, with nothing and no one coming between them. She said a solemn prayer, begging God to bring Rex back to her. Just then, she heard the teens' voices in the hallway, and overheard Starr's insensitive comment about Ray becoming a vegetable. Adriana threw the drawing room doors open, snapping, \"Do you mind?\" \n\n\nStarr and Cole were shocked to see that Adriana was back, and that she had installed Rex's hospital care in the drawing room. They gave her their condolences on Rex's condition, but Starr was confused; she asked Adriana if she and Rex were still separated and about to be divorced, and wondered why Rex was not still at the hospital. Adriana snapped that she was still Rex's wife and had to come to his aid at his time of need, and said that they couldn't do anything more for him at the hospital. Starr asked if Dorian was okay with Rex's arrangements, and Adriana said Dorian didn't know, and she didn't care if her mother approved. She said she was striking her own path as a Cramer, and wouldn't end up Dorian's \"project\" like Langston. She asked the teens to watch over Rex while she made security arrangements with Shaun, and suggested they read something soothing to the sleeping man. In the corridor, she put pressure on Shaun, warning him that no one but medical staff or family should be allowed into the house. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Roxy rushed off to join Marcie and Gigi as they prepared to head for La Boulaie. Charlie complimented Roxy on her new disguise for Gigi, and wished the ladies good luck. Roxy gave Charlie a peck on the cheek, and told him she hoped he heard from Jared soon; she said Jared was lucky to have such a great dad. After she'd left, a worried Charlie put in a call to Jared, saying he missed him. \n\n\nAt the police station, Bo arrived and met with Cristian and Sarah in his office. Cristian explained Lola's situation to him; he admitted that she had entered the country illegally, but said Lola had no other place to go, and pleaded with Bo not to put her into foster care that night. Sarah chimed in, saying Cristian was only trying to honor a promise to Lola and Vanessa. Bo reluctantly agreed, and said Cristian could be Lola's guardian for 24 hours while the Montez situation continued to play out. Cristian got ready to take an overjoyed Lola home with him, and thanked Sarah for her support; Sarah said that without Lola and Vanessa, Cristian might never have made it home to her. Lola said her goodbyes to Langston and Markko, and left with Cris and Sarah. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in Bo's office, Bo listened to a voicemail from Gigi in which she explained that Adriana had moved Rex from the hospital, and then carefully promised to do the exact opposite of everything she was doing to find their \"Balsom.\" \n\n\nOutside La Boulaie, Marcie, Roxy, and Gigi hurried to the front door as Roxy slipped a pair of glasses onto Gigi's face to go along with her new blonde wig. \"It works for Clark Kent, it'll work for you,\" Roxy promised her. Roxy rushed off as Marcie and Gigi approached the door. While Gigi hid behind a pillar, Marcie rang the bell and was greeted by Adriana, who asked what she was doing there. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd and Marty were going over baby names when the doorbell rang. When Todd answered the door, he found Tess and Bree on his front step. \"We're moving in!\" Tess declared. She said Viki was on to her, but Todd expressed utter disinterest and prepared to call Viki himself. \"Give us a room or I'm gonna give Marty a history lesson,\" Tess ordered. With that, Marty hobbled into the main hall and greeted \"Jessica\" and her daughter. Marty and Tess exchanged notes, and Marty let it slip that she and Todd were preparing for the baby's arrival. \"The baby?\" Tess asked, initially assuming that Todd had gotten Marty pregnant. Marty explained that they were \"adopting\" Starr's baby, which left Tess even more shocked. As Tess deftly taunted Todd about his plans, Marty helped Bree into the living room. Todd dragged Tess outside and warned her to keep her mouth shut. Tess said she'd only stay quiet if he allowed her and Bree to stay there on her terms, and to prove her point, she began screaming into the night that Marty Saybrooke was alive and well and living at Todd Manning's house. Todd gagged her, and Tess finally agreed to keep mum--as long as they had a deal. As Tess re-entered the house, Todd ran smack into Tina, who rushed up saying she needed to speak to him. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr and Cole struggled to find appropriate reading material for Rex, then finally settled on some of the children's books and poems Starr was reading to their unborn child. Cole reflected on the things his parents had read to him, and said that while Patrick had wanted to teach him about Yeats, Marty had preferred to read him lots of Lewis Carroll. As he recited his favorite childhood poem, \"Jabberwocky,\" to Starr, Marty was doing the same for young Bree. As Marty spoke the words to the little girl, she flashed back to a forgotten memory, of herself reading \"Jabberwocky\" to an infant Cole, holding him close to her and calling him \"my beautiful boy.\" Reeling, Marty struggled to understand what the new memory meant. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki prepared to leave and speak to Charlie, but when she opened her door, she found him standing there, looking for her. \n\n\n",

But she cannot recall who it was, when she was with the baby, nor that it was her own son. At the police station, Cristian urges Bo not to let Vanessa get in trouble for what she did to Ray Montez. And he and Sarah offer to let her and Lola stay at their home.",
