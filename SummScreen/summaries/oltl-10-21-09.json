Todd told the boy he had to attend classes regardless of Blair's condition.  Jack wasn't fooled, and accused Todd of wanting to be alone with Blair so he could hook up, as T\u00e9a was out of the picture.  \"Half-Naked is totally out of your life and you hate being single!\"  Todd told Jack to watch his mouth, and said there was nothing going on between him and Blair.\n\n\nWhen Todd and Jack entered Blair's room, they found an empty bed.  Jack worried that she might have wandered off in a daze due to her memory loss, but Todd explained that Blair had only lost one key memory from the day she'd fought with T\u00e9a.  Todd told Jack to wait for him while he tracked Blair down.  As soon as he left, Jack hopped onto Blair's hospital bed to scarf down her leftover box of candy.\n\n\nAt the police station, Ross was pacing the length of his prison cell when a guard alerted him to a \"hot\" lady visitor, who he instantly assumed was Blair.  He was dismayed when T\u00e9a sauntered up to the bars.  T\u00e9a gloated about Ross's imprisonment, and informed him that Elijah's seduction attempt hadn't worked.  Holding up her briefcase, T\u00e9a told him he'd never locate their child.  She opened the case to reveal stacks upon stacks of cash, and offered to make it worth Ross's while to sign over his rights and stay away for good.\n\n\nAngry, Ross told T\u00e9a he didn't want her money; all he wanted was access to his kid.  T\u00e9a glossed over Ross's parental rights and said she wanted a clean break.  Ross questioned why her new life with Todd could only happen at the expense of his fatherhood.  He said he would soon be out of jail, and was not going to give up his claim to the child.  Needling T\u00e9a, he reminded her that Todd didn't want her anymore, and said that nothing could change the fact that she had bore Ross's child, instead of Todd's, after the time on the island.\n\n\nT\u00e9a pleaded with him to reconsider her terms, and asked him to get Elijah to back off.  Ross said he couldn't call Elijah off, as they were more than just attorney/client, they were also brothers.  T\u00e9a was stunned by the revelation.  Ross asked her what would happen if Todd took her back, but learned she had another man's child.  \"You worry about Blair,\" T\u00e9a purred, walking out. \"I'll worry about Todd.\"\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Marty had an unexpected visitor in her office: Blair.  Tossing off rules and regulations, Blair reminded Marty of her obligation to patient confidentiality, warning her not to spill the beans about T\u00e9a's big secret.  Marty told Blair that the secret would inevitably be revealed, and asked if Blair was really willing to keep Todd's child from him.  She said that if Blair  really cared for her ex, she'd tell him the truth.\n\n\nBlair assured Marty she was only waiting for \"the perfect moment\" to bust T\u00e9a, but the good doctor wasn't so sure, especially after Blair mentioned that the child would bond Todd and T\u00e9a forever.  She pushed Blair to commit to telling Todd.  Annoyed, Blair ordered her to \"keep my secret safe,\" or she'd pay with her medical license.  Just then, Todd walked into the office, asking what secret Blair was keeping.\n\n\nThinking fast, Blair covered to Todd, claiming that she'd had another hypnosis session.  She said she still couldn't remember what had happened with T\u00e9a.  Todd reassured her that the memories would return in time.  Escorting her into the hallway, Todd told Blair that he and Jack were both picking her up; he admitted they were hoping to forget about T\u00e9a's betrayal by spending time with her instead.  As she watched Todd and Blair walk off, Marty rolled her eyes in exasperation.\n\n\nBack at Blair's room, Jack was confronted by Elijah.  Elijah inquired where his mother was and Jack seized upon an angle, asking what the information was worth to him.  Unamused by the extortion attempt, Elijah realized he was dealing with Todd's son and threatened to have him sent to Juvenile Hall for assaulting Ross.  Jack said that Ross had been trespassing in his father's home, and said Elijah's threats didn't scare him: \"I'll just call security and say you were trying to kiss me!\"\n\n\nTodd and Blair returned to the room just in time to defuse the argument.  As Jack stormed off, Elijah asked Blair for her help in getting the kidnapping charges against Ross dropped.  Blair grew concerned and asked him if Ross was recovering from his injuries.  Todd was jealous to hear that Blair and Ross had developed a cordial relationship, and wanted to know how they had become so chummy.  Brushing off his questions, Blair told Elijah she'd agree to drop the charges.\n\n\nAs Elijah turned to leave, Todd gave him a warning: \"Tell Ross to stick to my other ex-wife.\"  Elijah laughed, and said that he had nothing to worry about, noting that to his eyes, Todd and Blair looked like a happy family again.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Shane picked at his breakfast listlessly, reluctant to get ready for \"Volunteer Day\" at the Buenos Dias Cafe.  Rex attempted to psych him up for the day's events, but all Shane had on his mind was his parents' troubled relationship.  He asked Rex to fix things with Gigi.  Rex agreed to try, and sent the boy upstairs as the doorbell rang.\n\n\nRex answered the door to find Roxy, who said she was there to take Shane to Volunteer Day.  Rex icily replied that it was his job, and asked his estranged mom who'd told her she could stop by.  \"I did,\" Gigi said, walking into the living room.  Taking Rex aside, she reminded him that he'd said Roxy could still be in Shane's life, even though he wasn't speaking to her.  She told him that letting Roxy take Shane gave them time to talk.\n\n\nDescending the stairs, Shane was overjoyed to see his grandmother, who ushered him out the door.  Alone at last, Gigi and Rex agonized over the realization that Shane could sense their strife.  Gigi said she had an idea about how to heal their broken relationship.  Rex agreed to try anything.  Gigi wanted them to go to couples therapy, courtesy of Marty Saybrooke.\n\n\nRex was uptight about the idea of going to counseling, but admitted he couldn't think of another way to sort out their differences; rehashing the past only led them to more accusations and recriminations.  Rex remembered when they had been a \"perfect\" couple, and asked Gigi what had happened.  Gigi said the only way to understand was to schedule an appointment with Marty.  Gigi made the call and spoke to Marty, who informed her that she had an opening in her schedule that evening.  Swallowing his pride, Rex agreed to go to the appointment.\n\n\nAfter hanging up with Gigi, Marty examined her case file on Blair.  Frustrated, she put it away.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias, Kyle's \"yes\" to Nick's marriage proposal led to wild applause from the other patrons, all except Oliver.  Oliver stumbled over to the couple and asked what was going on.  Gushing, Nick explained that he'd just proposed, and said that he and Kyle were to be \"wed\" as part of a symbolic \"group wedding\" of Llanview's gay and lesbian couples.  Anxious, Kyle said it was more of a political statement than anything, but Nick said the vows would be one hundred percent real to him.  After taking a phone call from Amelia, Nick informed Kyle and Oliver that the mass nuptials were all set for the next day.\n\n\nOliver was stunned to realize Kyle was getting married in the morning.  Nick asked Kyle to join him at the Llanview Gay and Lesbian Alliance headquarters for campaign work, but Kyle begged off for his medical studies.  \"Good thing absence makes the heart grow fonder,\" Nick quipped, and turned to leave, then walked back and gave Kyle a passionate kiss goodbye, right in front of a crestfallen Fish.\n\n\nAt the lunch counter, Roxy caught Shane staring goggle-eyed at the male-on-male kiss.  Roxy began to fumble through an explanation of the birds and the bees, but Shane said he understood that Kyle and Nick were gay, he simply wished his parents still kissed like that.  Roxy grumbled about Stacy's schemes and her surprise pregnancy, but told Shane that if Rex and Gigi had been able to get through his leukemia, they could face anything given time.  She raced him into the kitchen for the beginning of the \"Volunteer Day\" meeting.\n\n\nOliver sat down beside Kyle, still struggling to process Kyle's engagement; he couldn't believe Kyle would be part of a \"show marriage.\"  Kyle defended his choice, and said that he was participating in the wedding ceremony on behalf of gay and lesbian civil rights.  He said it was a more valid pretense than having to pretend he'd never loved his old roommate.\n\n\nOliver asked him if the wedding was really only a political statement, and pushed him to admit he didn't truly love Nick.  Kyle hedged and said he didn't know.  Heartbroken, Oliver said that even if the ceremony was \"in name only,\" the idea of marriage was a real commitment; it meant there was no hope for them anymore.  Kyle bitterly said he'd given up on the idea of a \"them\" long ago.  Upset, Oliver walked out.\n\n\nRoxy dashed out of the kitchen and over to the table, and asked Kyle if he'd been hoping to make Oliver jealous by kissing Nick.  Kyle said that Nick was the man he was going to marry, and explained the LGLA mass wedding ceremony to her.  Dismayed, Roxy asked him why he wasn't marrying the man he loved.  Kyle scoffed and said he'd been over Oliver for a long time, and the wedding would only be symbolic.  Roxy took his words in stride, but still wasn't convinced: \"Are you sure you're marrying the right man?\"\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, David confronted Dorian about her marriage to Amelia, and told her he couldn't let her take her vows.  Dorian laughed him off, and said the wedding would merely be an important gesture on behalf of civil rights.  He said it didn't matter, because she wasn't marrying for love.  Dorian was stunned by his sudden attack of sentimentality.  \"I'm all for love when there's no possibility of monetary gain,\" he replied.\n\n\nDavid told Dorian that Amelia was using her, but Dorian countered that they were both using each other for political gain and the greater good.  He asked her what would happen to her \"marriage\" if she fell in love with a man.  Dorian asked if David meant himself, and reminded him that they were divorced.  They'd tried to make a go of their relationship several times, and failed over and over.  \"And you ruined it,\" she snapped.\n\n\nDavid pleaded ignorance, but Dorian laced into him for abandoning her, first at the altar on Spencer's orders, then that same year, when he'd pursued his showbiz dreams in Hollywood courtesy of \"Have-A-Seat.\"  She said that both times, she'd genuinely fallen for him, only to have her heart trampled on.  David reminded her that she'd moved on quickly with Ray Montez, and told her that even when he'd gone to California, he'd been unable to get her out of his mind.  He said he hadn't returned to Llanview for his reality show, but for the woman he wanted to live in that reality with.  Dorian was struck by his declaration of love, but didn't want to let her guard down.\n\n\nDrawing close, David told Dorian he knew she'd always need a man's warmth and touch.  Dorian struggled to pull away, and insisted that her wedding to Amelia needed her focus.  Yet, unable to resist, she buried her head in David's chest, then kissed him passionately.  Just as their romantic clinch intensified, Dorian tore herself away and asked David point-blank: \"Do you love me?\"\n\n\nBefore David could answer, the phone rang; he told her not to take the call, but Dorian reminded him that she was running a political campaign.  As Dorian chatted with Amelia, David grew sullen.  Dorian hung up and informed him that Amelia had arranged media coverage for the gay and lesbian nuptials, then asked him to finish his sentence.  \"Don't let anyone talk you out of wearing white,\" David said coldly. \"You look sexy in white.\"  He walked out, leaving Dorian jilted and alone.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, Elijah approached Ross's cell and gave him the good news about Blair dropping the charges against him.  Ross asked if Blair was okay, and mused that she was hot for him.  Elijah wasn't so sure, and suggested that Blair might only have been using him to make Todd jealous.  He told Ross that Todd had been at the hospital with Blair.\n\n\nAt the hospital, T\u00e9a entered Blair's room, only to be informed by the nurse that her \"husband\" had taken her home.  Infuriated, T\u00e9a swept some knick-knacks off a tray.  \"He's not her husband,\" she snarled as she stalked out, \"he's mine.\"\n\n\nTodd and Blair returned to La Boulaie to find the house empty.  Todd asked her if she needed anything, but Blair said she was fine.  He turned to leave, but Blair stopped him, asking him not to go. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian and David admit to each other that they loved each other when they got married. They kiss and start to make out. Dorian asks him to tell her if he still loves her. Before he has a chance to answer, Dorian answers the phone to Amelia. When she hangs up and asks David what he was going to say to her, he tells her good luck with her marriage to Amelia and he leaves. Kyle accepts Nick's marriage proposal. Oliver wonders if their marriage is a political statement or if Kyle really loves Nick. Kyle admits that he doesn't know if he loves Nick, but it is complicated. Oliver asks if that means there is no hope for the two of them. Kyle tells him he gave up a long time ago. After Oliver leaves, Roxy wants to know if Kyle is using that other guy to make Fish jealous. Kyle tells her he is marrying Nick. She asks if he is sure that he is marrying the right man. Gigi suggests couples therapy for her and Rex to work through their issues. She makes an appointment with Marty Saybrooke. Blair warns Marty not to reveal to Todd that she remembers Tea telling her that she has a child. Ross refuses Tea's offer of money in exchange for his signature on a document that releases his rights to their child. Ross reminds her that she had sex with him, not Todd on that island so the child is his. Tea tells him to have Elijah stop looking for the child.
