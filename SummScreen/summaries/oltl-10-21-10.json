    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the warehouse, Dani and T\u00e9a were both tied up. Dani told her mom about a recurring dream she had in which T\u00e9a had made an appearance. She said that she would be happy, then wake up and remember that her mother was gone. She had liked the dream because it had allowed her to be with her mother for \"ten more seconds.\" Dani related that, since the two were together, she didn't care what happened. T\u00e9a assured her that Todd was doing everything he could to get Dani back.\n\n\nEli entered with a newspaper and sandwiches. Dani demanded to know what had happened to Starr and Hope. Eli ignored the question and tried to feed one of the sandwiches to Dani. She took a bite and spit it back at Eli, who became angry. He began to slam things and assured the two that he wanted things to be over, too, as soon as he got his money.\n\n\nT\u00e9a begged Eli to let Dani go because Dani would tell Todd that T\u00e9a was there. Then, Eli could get his money. Eli didn't like the idea. He showed the newspaper to his hostages. The headline was about Shaun saving Greg from Eli. \"I don't think so,\" he said. Dani demanded to know how Eli had forced Greg to go along with Eli's plan. He claimed to be good at making people understand their priorities. Dani began to ask more questions about Greg, but Eli said he had things to do, and that he had \"made Todd sweat long enough.\"\n\n\nAt Todd's, the FBI agent told Todd that, if Eli called again, Todd should keep him on the phone. Blair entered, suspicious of two briefcases that Todd was carrying. She said he couldn't give Eli money. Eli could take the money and run, and they'd never see the girls again. Blair wanted the girls back first. Todd wondered why Eli hadn't yet called.\n\n\nLater, Blair was on the phone with Addie and said that she would let her mother know when it was safe for Addie and the boys to return to Llanview. She hung up and regretted that the boys were missing so much school. Todd suggested that she fly out and tutor them, but Blair refused to leave until the girls were back and, even then, would never let them out of her sight. Just then, the phone rang and Todd picked it up.\n\n\nJohn looked at a map of the area and filled a cop in on where John had found Starr's car. The cop left and Natalie entered with a file. Natalie informed John that they had gotten lucky, and the lab had been able to figure out that the ashes in the urn were not T\u00e9a's. They both agreed that they thought T\u00e9a was Greg's patient at the Cherryvale clinic, and that Eli probably had her. They also agreed that they would have to prove that T\u00e9a was alive before they told Todd because Todd would probably \"screw things up.\"\n\n\nJohn asked if Natalie was up to the job, but Natalie said that she would only be looking at security tape, and tracking down the nurse from Cherryvale. John promised Natalie that, when things calmed down, he would find a place for \"the three of us,\" and make a life for them. John's phone rang, and he answered it. He told the person on the other end that he was on his way and hung up. He informed Natalie that Eli had made contact.\n\n\nTodd demanded that Eli put Starr on the phone, but Eli said Todd would just have to take Eli's word that Starr was all right. Todd vowed not to give Eli a dime until he could talk to Starr, but Eli said that he was running the show. As Todd offered to pay the money, John entered the house. Looking at the gagged girls, Eli asked to speak to John. John took the phone from Todd. Eli told John to meet him at the old industrial park on Route 22. He also needed a helicopter with a pilot to take him wherever he wanted to go.\n\n\nTodd told Eli that if the girls weren't in perfect shape when he got them back, he would hunt Eli down. As an afterthought, Eli also said that he needed Blair. Todd refused, but Eli said Todd wouldn't get his girls back if Eli didn't get Blair. Blair grabbed the phone and said she would be there as long as Eli gave the girls back. Eli said to meet him in an hour and hung up.\n\n\nTodd refused to let Blair go, but she said it was the only way to get the girls back. \"What if he wants to take you in the helicopter?\" Todd asked. Blair said it was her choice and that she was trying to get the kids back. They argued more until Todd demanded that John arrest Blair. John agreed with Blair, saying that they needed to make Eli think he was getting what he wanted, \"just in case.\"\n\n\nEli took the gags off the girls, and T\u00e9a begged Eli to leave Blair out of it and let Dani go home. Dani insisted to know what Eli's plans for them were. Eli ignored the question and asked if they were ready to go. Dani asked where they were going. As he untied the girls, Eli said that \"the gang\" would be there soon, and that it was \"showtime.\"\n\n\nIn Greg's hospital room, Shaun told Vivian that he wanted to be at Destiny's birthday party, but he was afraid to leave Greg. Vivian assured Shaun that Greg would be all right, and Shaun left. Vivian went to check Greg's pulse and noticed it was weak, even though it shouldn't have been. The machines in the room began to beep wildly, and Vivian ran to get help. Vivian tried to revive Greg with the help of a nurse, and eventually did.\n\n\nVivian concluded that there was something in Greg's intravenous bag that wasn't supposed to be there. She ordered the nurse to take the bag to the toxicology department and put a rush on it. Greg woke up and asked what had happened. She told him that Eli had tried to poison him and that she was going to call Greg's family, who were out celebrating Destiny's birthday. Greg was surprised to learn that it was already Destiny's birthday. Vivian turned to leave so she could call his family, but Greg grabbed her arm and said, \"Not yet.\"\n\n\nVivian told Greg that she had promised she would call his family as soon as he woke up. However, Greg wanted to talk to the police first. Later, Natalie entered with a cop. Greg said he had asked for John, but Natalie informed him that John was out \"apprehending\" Eli. Vivian asked Greg if he was sure he wanted to answer questions, but Greg wanted to talk to the cops alone. Vivian left on the condition that Natalie promised to leave after five minutes.\n\n\nNatalie asked Greg if he remembered saying anything to her about T\u00e9a a couple of days before. She needed him to confirm that what he had said was true. Greg confirmed it, saying that T\u00e9a was alive. Greg explained Eli's entire plan. He told Natalie about how Eli had gotten Ross custody of Dani in order to get rich, but Greg hadn't known how that would work. He went on about how Eli had forced Greg to tell T\u00e9a she was dying, and eventually kill her, because of damaging information Eli had on Greg.\n\n\nGreg couldn't kill T\u00e9a, so he had lied to everyone about T\u00e9a being dead and snuck her to the clinic in Cherryvale. He had gotten ashes from the morgue. He wanted Eli's reign of terror to stop, and related that his family needed to know the truth. He wanted to make things right at Cherryvale with T\u00e9a. However, Natalie informed a shocked Greg that T\u00e9a and her nurse had vanished from Cherryvale, and that Eli was back. Natalie hoped Greg's secret was \"worth it,\" but he claimed to just be protecting his family. Natalie said they'd have to arrest him and left the room to call it in. The cop read a miserable-looking Greg his rights.\n\n\nAt the Buenos D\u00edas, Mr. and Mrs. Evans told a depressed Destiny to start opening gifts, but she didn't feel right celebrating without Greg. Matthew entered with a gift, and Destiny asked if he had heard anything about Dani. He hadn't, and Destiny didn't feel right celebrating when Dani, Starr, and Hope were still missing. Shaun entered with a gift, and Destiny asked him about Greg. Shaun assured her that Vivian was there, so Greg would be fine.\n\n\nLater, Destiny looked at the lit candles on her cake and wanted two wishes -- one for Greg, and one for Dani, Starr, and Hope. She blew all the candles out and Nate entered, to Matthew's chagrin. Matthew blamed Nate for Dani's kidnapping. Destiny couldn't believe that Dani's own uncle would kidnap her and hold her for fifty million dollars. Nate informed her that Eli had also killed Ross. Destiny couldn't believe that her brother would ever get involved with someone like that. She related that, if Greg had been involved with Eli, he had been forced. Shaun gave his parents a suspicious look when they abruptly changed the subject to the party.\n\n\nLater, a more cheerful Destiny wore a \"World's Best Little Sis\" t-shirt and began to open her gifts. Darren got her a music player with all of \"our songs\" on it, and apologized that he couldn't get her a better one, a \"Pulse.\" She loved it, and continued with Matthew's gift. It was a Pulse, and a disappointed Darren told her she could return his gift. She told them how she would use both music players, but Mr. Evans said that she couldn't accept such an expensive gift. Matthew assured them that he had just gotten a bonus from Clint. Mr. Evans related to his wife that Clint had \"more dollars than sense.\"\n\n\nNate gave Destiny a gift and she opened the box to find a pair of earrings that she had seen while shopping with Dani. Nate said that Dani had told him about the earrings and said that the gift was from the two of them. Destiny hugged Nate and said that Dani would be all right. Mrs. Evans gave Destiny her last gift -- a touching card from Greg. They all expressed their worry for Greg.\n\n\nNate had to go, but promised to call if he heard anything about Dani. He left, and Matthew glared after him. Matthew decided to follow Nate outside, and Nate asked what Matthew's problem was. \"You,\" Matthew replied. Matthew claimed that Nate had stolen Dani and was trying to steal Matthew's best friend too. As the two began to get in each other's faces, Darren appeared and pulled them apart. Matthew claimed that Nate had started it, but Nate related that he was going to end it. Nate left, and Darren told Matthew to \"get a grip.\" Matthew walked away.\n\n\nAs Destiny and her mother wrapped the remainder of the cake up, Destiny said that she wanted to cry every time she looked at Greg's card. Just then, Shaun's phone rang, and it was Vivian. She told Shaun that Greg was awake. Shaun told his family, and they rejoiced. However, Vivian told Shaun that they needed to get to the hospital immediately because there was a problem.\n\n\nThe Evans family entered Greg's hospital room, and Greg apologized for missing Destiny's party. Destiny told Greg that, since he was awake, he could tell the cops that he'd had nothing to do with Eli. \"But I did,\" Greg said. A horrified Destiny knew that Eli had forced him, but Greg said that he'd had a choice. He could have either helped Eli or had his secret revealed. \"What does he have on you?\" Shaun asked.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the meeting place with Todd, Blair, and some backup. John promised to get the girls back.\n\n\nNatalie entered Todd's empty house, yelling that she had news about T\u00e9a.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eli holds Tea and Dani hostage. Dani is rejoicing that her mom is back but furious with Eli and afraid of what he might do. Back in Llanview, Destiny celebrates her 17th birthday with her family and friends but tells her parents that she'd like to postpone it until Dani is back safe and Greg is out of the hospital. Meanwhile, Greg regains consciousness when everybody least expects it. Everyone is happy. But Natalie goes to ask him if he helped Eli with his plans and if he's responsible for what happened to Tea. He admits that he is and the reason he did what Eli wanted is because Eli was holding a \"secret\" over his head. The cops tell him as soon as he's released from the hospital, they will have to place him under arrest. Destiny, Shaun and his parents demand to know what is going on. He hesitates to tell them. Eli calls Todd and Blair again and tells them if they ever want to see Dani, Starr or Hope, he needs not only Todd's money but for Blair to come to see him. Todd and John both tell Blair there's no way they will let her near Eli, but she fears they are running out of options, and she will do it in order to save the girls.",
