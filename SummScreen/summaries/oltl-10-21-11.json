    "tvmega_recap": "In court, after Tom\u00e1s has confessed to murdering Irene and Todd has not attempted to stop him, Blair asks her ex-husband if he can live with himself letting an innocent man throw his life away for a crime he did not commit. Todd tells her that Tom\u00e1s and Irene took his life from him so he has a clear conscience with letting this happen. But when he's in the bathroom looking in the mirror, he again sees the ghost of Irene who tells him she wants him to let Tom\u00e1s take the rap and not listen to anybody else. At that point, Todd goes into the courtroom and tells the judge that although she's sentenced Tom\u00e1s to 20 years in prison and it's her final ruling, he murdered Irene. Then remembering shooting Victor, Todd admits that's not all he did. Aubrey wants to live the honorable life and help Rex plan a Halloween party. Cutter is in Kentucky ready to let Stacy/Gigi believe that she is the love of Rex's life so that Rex believes he's gotten her back in exchange for the money Cutter wants and needs the only way he knows how to obtain it."
