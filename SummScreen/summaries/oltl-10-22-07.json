    "tvmega_recap": "Nash and Jessica are wondering how they can get Jared out of their home, their company and their lives. He goes to Capricorn and gets into a friendly conversation with Sara. They take an instant liking for each other and they kiss. Both Natalie and Cristian watch and reveal they might be jealous. They warn Sara that she should beware of Jared. She tells them she respects the fact that Jared is unafraid to go out and make things happen for himself without being dependent upon nepotism, the way both Natalie and Cristian apparently are. Marcie is on the run with Tommy. A cop stops her. She wonders what he wants and what will happen. But after a long line of questioning, he seems to buy that she is Penny with her son Aaron and just tells her she needs to get some rest for the night and should check into a motel. John, Michael and Todd are all wondering what they need to do in order to find Marcie and Tommy. Viki has surprisingly been working as a waitress in a Texas truck stop for the last two months. We see how it happened. She randomly booked a flight to Tulsa, wound up going to the restaurant to eat and getting into a conversation with a waitress and her manager. And she concluded that maybe she needs a change in her life. So when she overhears that they are short-handed and worried about the success of their business, she concludes that they should give her a chance to contribute and help them. And she gets the job as a waitress.",
