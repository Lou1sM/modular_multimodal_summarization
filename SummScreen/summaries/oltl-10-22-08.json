    "soap_central": "\nDie? No. Might?\n\n\nJared and Natalie remained locked in the secret room without a link to the outside world. Jared checked Natalie's foot after she complained about the swelling and pain. He confirmed that it was swollen. He was forced to improvise and made a bandage to help relieve some of discomfort. Unfortunately, it didn't help Natalie to deal with their circumstances. She began to worry that they might never be found. To distract Natalie from being overwhelmed with their plight, Jared asked her to imagine a cool breeze, fire pit, and setting sun. \n\n\nNatalie closed her eyes and saw them in Texas at the Buchanan Ranch. They were in the same spot where Jared had first told Natalie that he loved her. Jared envisioned them in the same place. As the lovebirds talked about their feelings and kissed, Natalie seemed to relax. When Jared asked Natalie to dance, they slowly swayed to the strains of Rie Sinclair's \"Believe Me.\" When the romantic interlude ended, Natalie and Jared snuggled together on the sofa. Jared promised Natalie that one day they would return to Texas and gaze up at the stars. \n\n\nCharlie was surprised when he went to Llanfair to see Jared, and Viki opened the door. Viki was pleased by the unexpected visit, but for another reason. She was worried about Natalie and Jared's disappearance and had planned to talk to Charlie about it. Viki had hoped that Charlie had heard from Jared. When Charlie confessed that he had not, Viki told Charlie about the last phone call that she had received from his son. Charlie only became concerned when Viki revealed that Bo was also worried. At the mention of the police commissioner's name, Charlie realized that something serious might have happened to his son. \n\n\nCharlie's worries were not eased as Viki went on to share her suspicions with him; Tess had returned. Viki was also anxious because Tess had  gone missing and she had taken Bree with her. Viki felt sick at the idea of Bree in Tess's hands. Charlie tried to calm Viki and suggested that they search Jared's room. Charlie hoped that Jared might have left behind a clue as to his whereabouts. Unfortunately their search revealed nothing except that neither of their children had taken any luggage when they had left. Convinced that Tess was behind the mysterious disappearances, Charlie vowed to Viki that they would find their missing children. \n\n\nTina turned up on Todd's doorstep and asked him for help. She wanted to know if he had seen Jessica. Todd claimed that he had not and tried to send Tina away, but Tina proved to be quite persistent. She told her brother that she needed to get into Viki's safe, claiming that it was a matter of life or death. Todd wasn't impressed with Tina's pleas, nor did he seem concerned that her dog's life hung in the balance. Todd ordered Tina to leave and when she didn't, Todd forced her out his door. His only advice was to blow up Viki's safe. \n\n\nIn Todd's living room, Tess kept Marty occupied while Todd attended to Tina. Tess seemed intrigued when Marty admitted that she had recalled reading the story, \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll, to a little boy. Once Tess gleaned what information she could from Marty, she tried to leave the living room. Tess drew up short when she opened the door and heard the commotion between Todd and Tina as Todd forced Tina out of his home. Marty heard the ruckus as well, but before she could investigate, Tess convinced Marty that it was John McBain. Tess advised Marty to stay put and trust Todd to handle matters with John. \n\n\nWhen Todd returned to the living room, he found that Marty was quite agitated over the idea of John McBain entering the house. Todd quickly calmed Marty's fears by lying. He told her that it had been someone looking for a donation, not John. Before Tess breezed out of the living room, she seemed to take pleasure in letting Todd know that Marty had recalled something from her past. \n\n\nAs soon as Tess was gone, Todd questioned Marty about her recently returned memories. She said that she had a vivid recollection of reading to a little boy that she had loved dearly, a boy that she continued to love even though she had no idea who he was. Todd brushed it off as a random memory of a friend's child, but Marty wasn't convinced. She remained troubled. Eventually she excused herself and went to bed. \n\n\nIn the hallway, Tess bumped into Todd and let him know that she had helped herself to a few things in the nursery. Tess wondered how Todd intended to get his hands on Starr's baby. \n\n\nTina returned to Llanfair with a big designer bag clutched to her side. She slipped into the living room, pulled out a picture of her dog, David Vickers, and promised him that mommy would help him. Tina then reached into her bag and pulled out two sticks of dynamite. \n\n\nIn Bo's office, at the Llanview police station, John and Bo talked about Tess and Todd. Bo found it odd that Natalie had not gone to visit her brother, Rex, who remained in critical condition. John agreed that it was out of character for Natalie not to visit her brother or to call anyone for updates on Rex. Bo mentioned a few other things that had concerned him about Jessica's behavior, including John's comments, weeks ago, that Jessica had seemed different. Bo reminded John of everything that Jessica had endured in the previous few months, and wondered aloud if it might be possible that Tess had returned. \n\n\nJohn didn't dispute Bo's theory. He believed that it explained why Jessica had covered for Todd when John had searched Todd's home for the mystery woman. As they discussed the possibility of Jessica's alter ego having returned, John suggested that they investigate Todd's place again. Bo was reluctant. He realized that John's heart was in the right place, but he didn't think using Tess as an excuse would justify the search. However, Bo realized that John's determination to find that mystery woman indicated there was more to the story than John was revealing. John clammed up and said little beyond that he couldn't tell Bo anything until he had more evidence. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Adriana saw through Marcie's ploy and refused to give her any indication of where Rex was. She didn't believe that Marcie was there to visit Starr but rather to help Gigi in some way. Adriana tried to convince Marcie that Rex was in another location by pretending that she had been about to leave the house to visit her estranged husband. Marcie didn't try to stop Adriana but she did remind her that she was there to see Starr. Adriana lied and said that Starr was not at home. Marcie found it curious that Starr would be out so late at night. \n\n\nMeanwhile, a disguised Gigi, crept around the back of La Boulaie and tried to slip in through the living room doors. When she saw Starr and Cole inside the room with Rex, Gigi sent a text message to Marcie asking her for help. \n\n\nWhen Marcie received the text message that Starr was inside, Marcie decided to call Adriana's bluff and called Starr on her cell phone. Starr was confused about why Adriana would lie. She walked out of the living room and confronted her cousin. Adriana justified her behavior, claiming that she was trying to keep Marcie's friend, Gigi, away from Rex. \n\n\nAt the same time, on the back porch, Shaun found Gigi lurking. She claimed that she was one of the nurses assigned to Rex's case and that she had slipped out for a cigarette break. Shaun didn't recognize Gigi, however, he believed her story and after a few minutes, continued on his way, checking the grounds. \n\n\nInside the mansion, Marcie managed to distract Adriana and talked her into going upstairs for some much-needed relaxation time. Marcie sent Gigi a text message advising Gigi that the front door would be clear to enter through. Gigi made her way to the front of the house where Starr and Cole were saying goodbye. When Starr offered to walk Cole to his car, Gigi waited until they were out of eyesight and then quickly entered La Boulaie. She was just about to walk into the living room when Adriana spotted Gigi from the top of the stairs. Adriana demanded to know who she was. Gigi kept her back to Adriana so that all Adriana saw was a blond woman in a white uniform.\n\n\n",
