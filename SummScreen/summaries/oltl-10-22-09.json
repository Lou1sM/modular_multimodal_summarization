Stacy advised him that it was a band Gigi had loved as a teenager and she thought that Schuyler would be able to \"bag her\" by taking Gigi to the show. Pointing out that it sounded as though he were bagging a deer, Schuyler declined the tickets.\n\n\nKim and Stacy sat at a table with the newspaper and Kim declared that it was time to find a new career and job. She was looking for a rich divorc\u00e9e, she advised her friend. She was running out of money.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi was ready to leave for work at Rodi's. She was thrilled that she and Rex were able to get an appointment with Marty for some couples counseling and was sure it would help them. Distracted, Rex muttered a couple of brief words whenever Gigi paused, but he was less than pleased. Gigi, hopeful that he was saving up on his chatter for their appointment, headed out the door.\n\n\nSoon after, Natalie arrived and showed Rex the Sun  with Jared's photograph prominently displayed on the front cover, along with all of the gory headlines regarding his alleged crimes. She wanted Rex to help find her husband before the police did, since he knew Jared better than the cops. She was afraid of what the cops would do if they found him first, she exclaimed. She mentioned that John was \"out for blood\" regarding Jared. Rex wondered if she thought that Jared had committed the murders he was accused of.\n\n\nMomentarily silent, Natalie admitted that she only knew what Jared had told her. She felt that he no longer made sense and he had confessed to working with Wayne Landers. She told Rex all that had happened to date involving the stalker. She was familiar with all that Jared had done in the past, but she also knew what he was capable of not doing, she emphasized. Natalie insisted to her brother that her husband was not a murderer, and he had to have a good reason if he did kill someone. She observed that it was necessary to trust someone if you loved them.\n\n\nIn London, both Bo and Nora made calls back to Llanview. Nora explained her actions to Rachel, apologizing for not letting her know about the change of plans. Bo pursued the latest updates on Jared's whereabouts and learned that Shaun had awakened. He advised Nora that his decision regarding Matthew's surgery did not change, even with Greg coming through successfully on the surgery he performed on Shaun. He wondered if they should allow Matthew to talk to Destiny, since she would jump on the chance to tell Matthew the news.\n\n\nKevin encountered Matthew as he tried to sneak out the front door. Matthew asked his  cousin for help and pointed out that his parents had taken away his cell phone. He was not able to stay in touch with his friend, Destiny, who had probably left him many messages. Kevin agreed to speak to Bo and Nora about the phone, but advised Matthew that it wasn't good for him to be leaving the house. They headed into the study and caught the end of the conversation between Bo and Nora.\n\n\nLying, Bo confessed that they had been talking about Matthew's new school. He agreed to give his son a new phone that he would be able to use there. Bo advised Matthew that they were getting ready to take him to the school. Strongly and sarcastically, Matthew declared that he would not be going.\n\n\nMatthew accused his parents of breaking the law when it suited them, but Bo insisted that as parents, he and Nora had the right to choose a school for their son. Kevin tried to smooth things over and offered to drive Matthew to the school; Matthew was firm in his decision that his parents not join them. Nora was upset at the prospect of leaving her son, and cried that she wanted to quit her job and stay in London.\n\n\nBo hugged her and explained that it was necessary for them to return to their jobs and Llanview. He felt that it wouldn't make things better for them to stay, and that Matthew would only stay focused on the surgery. Their son would make new friends and his fighting with his parents would stop. He realized that the Buchanans always picked \"stupid fights.\" He would tell Matthew about Shaun at a better time. Nora was shattered that her son hated her so much. Bo knew that Matthew wouldn't stay angry forever.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Rachel ran into each other at the hospital. Having been friends for so long, they each recognized that the other was preoccupied with an uncomfortable situation. T\u00e9a expressed how happy she was to hear about Shaun, but wondered about Rachel breaking up with him and Rachel's relationship with Greg. Rachel refused to confide in her former best friend, even though T\u00e9a promised that everything would remain confidential. Matthew's trial was over, she added, and she had no need to expose any secrets.\n\n\nGiving in, Rachel admitted to having grown closer to Greg after Shaun's shooting. When T\u00e9a pursued the meaning of \"closer,\" Rachel assured her that T\u00e9a knew what it meant. She elaborated on Shaun's parents, who considered her and Shaun married, and how she could not bring herself to tell Shaun her true feelings. It just wasn't the right time, she felt. T\u00e9a advised her that there would never be a perfect time and she needed to tell Shaun the truth as soon as she could.\n\n\nIt was T\u00e9a's turn to talk, and she explained how she thought she had been divorced when she married Todd. She was expecting Todd to hate her for the rest of her life, and it seemed apparent that Blair had made it her mission in life to destroy T\u00e9a. Rachel reassured her, feeling that there wasn't any damage left to be done since everything was in the open. T\u00e9a felt otherwise and, upon feeling pressure from Rachel to let it out, she admitted that she had been lying about their child.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Todd stressed that he would not talk to Blair about T\u00e9a. While Blair insisted that she had merely been trying to save him some pain with her exploits, Todd thought that Blair had been behind his predicament with T\u00e9a. Todd thought that Blair had something to do with T\u00e9a's divorce papers, since T\u00e9a had sworn she had filed them. Calling T\u00e9a a \"lying skank,\" Blair insisted that the secret marriage and non-ending of it had been all T\u00e9a's doing.\n\n\nStarr arrived with Hope and filled her parents in on her day. She wondered if Blair had regained her memory yet and Blair quickly assured her that she hadn't. Blair maintained that she had no plans of making herself crazy over it. The talk turned to Dorian and Amelia. Todd suggested that Dorian would strike out with women the same as she did with men. They all agreed that they knew the women's marriage was a stunt. Starr left her parents alone with Hope as she needed to take care of her daughter's meal.\n\n\nTodd believed that marriage was a joke, and he wondered if Blair even knew anyone who had been happily married for five years. She was unable to think of any names. Todd suggested that the children were the best results of any marriage. The worst time for him was when he was kept from his children, he reminded Blair. Just as Blair admitted to having something to tell Todd, Starr returned. She was amazed to see her parents and her daughter painting such a cozy, normal family portrait without any yelling and drama. Todd noted that it was good that he didn't have any children with T\u00e9a or she'd be in his life forever. Starr grabbed Hope and left her parents alone.\n\n\nTodd reminded Blair that she had been about to tell him something but she assured him it wasn't a big deal. She repeated what she knew about T\u00e9a and Ross and their divorce papers. She thought that T\u00e9a should have known where the divorce stood. Mulling over what Blair said, Todd insisted that there was still a piece of the puzzle missing. Blair wished she could remember. Suddenly feeling light-headed, she asked Todd to help her to her bedroom.\n\n\nGigi arrived at Rodi's and bubbled over with the good feeling she had about working things out with Rex. She was telling Schuyler the news when she spied the concert tickets on the bar. She shrieked that she had tried to buy concert tickets herself to no avail. Schuyler admitted that he had received the tickets from Kim as a gift and handed them to Gigi. He thought that she should attend with Rex, since he had no one to go with anyway.\n\n\nRealizing that the concert was for that evening, Gigi explained that she would be unable to attend, as she and Rex had the appointment with the counselor. She knew that guys hated counseling, she acknowledged, and Rex was really being good about it. She thought that the counseling session might even help her deal with Stacy. Chuckling, Schuyler doubted that would happen.\n\n\nKim studied the photos of the Buchanan family in the newspaper as, one by one, Stacy shot down her friend's wishes to pursue each of them. Clint was newly married to the district attorney, Stacy pointed out. Kevin and Joey resided in London, and Jared was accused of murder. Kim was disappointed that Matthew was too young.\n\n\nRex agreed to help Natalie but insisted that he didn't want to interfere in the police investigation. Natalie handed him a matchbook that she had found in her bedroom. Rex informed her that the location on the matchbook was hours from Llanview and he was unable to pursue the lead until the next day, due to previous plans. Crying, Natalie pleaded with him to help her. She sobbed that everything was closing in on her and Jared was desperate. Rex admitted that he couldn't tell Gigi anything, since she worked for John. If he withheld evidence in a double murder investigation, he didn't want Gigi to know anything or get involved.\n\n\nCalling Gigi, Rex expressed regret that he would not be able to attend the counseling session with her. He had to go out of town for some work, but couldn't tell her much. It was huge, and dangerous, he confided, and really important. Hanging up, Gigi wondered if it was more important than the two of them. Natalie was grateful to Rex and wondered what she'd do without him.\n\n\nA worried Gigi shared Rex's phone call with Schuyler and wondered why Rex would take the job if it was dangerous. Surprisingly, Schuyler defended Rex. Gigi felt sorry for herself, realizing that she had no evening plans, but would stay home and worry about Rex. Schuyler suggested they go to the concert together.\n\n\nKim,  after learning of Bo's qualities from Stacy, decided that he would be her new conquest.\n\n\nArriving at his new school, Matthew was unpleasant to the headmistress and threw some Harry Potter trivia her way. He wondered if he'd be able to try out for the Quidditch team. He was surprised when she replied that he needed to pass his spells and potions class. Kevin promised to work on the cell phone problem, and the headmistress led Matthew to his room in order to meet his new roommate. Introducing him to Thomas, the boy snarled that his name was Tom, not Thomas. He was not happy to meet Matthew.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Nora and Bo have a plan to get Matthew involved in a boarding school and hopefully convince him that his life can be ok without the surgery. Rachel informs her mother that Shaun has regained consciousness. But Nora knows she better not tell that to Matthew because he could convince Greg to do the surgery. Meanwhile, Tea reveals to Rachel that she has a secret she's keeping from Todd and it involves their son. Matthew meets a school mate. And he may be Todd and Tea's son. Natalie persuades Rex to help her find Jared while he's on the run before the cops do. And it just happens to conflict with the couples' therapy session that Gigi wants to have with Rex. When he cancels on her and Schuyler has two tickets to a concert they both want to see, Schuyler and Gigi conclude that instead of missing out, they should attend the concert together.",
