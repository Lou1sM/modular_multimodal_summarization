John promised to protect Janet from Todd if she cooperated with his investigation. Seconds later, John received a call from Blair. In a seductive tone, Blair told John that she was in her bedroom sipping wine and asked what he was doing. After a long sigh, John stared across the room at Marty's photo and replied, \"Not a thing!\" \n\n\nAs Blair attempted to carry on small talk with John, the conversation was interrupted when Cole dropped by. John asked Blair if he could call her back and quickly hung up. Revealing to John that he was experiencing painful memories concerning his mother's death, Cole informed John that he wanted to celebrate Marty's life by constructing a memory site, in her honor, on the Internet. Cole asked John to post his thoughts about Marty on the site. Although uncomfortable revealing his innermost thoughts, John agreed to post a few words. Mentioning his visit with Starr, Cole told John that he was doing his best to be supportive of Starr's decision to give their child to Marcie, but he said that he didn't know how he would feel after the adoption. John offered Cole his support. After saying goodbye, Cole stood outside John's door and held a picture of his mother. On the other side of the door, John stared at a photo of Marty. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Starr and Blair had a loving mother-daughter conversation in Blair's bedroom. When Blair inquired about Starr's relationship with Cole, Starr informed her mother that she and Cole were making an attempt to rebuild their friendship. She told her mother that they hadn't made any plans to resume their relationship. Starr and Blair discussed the pregnancy. Starr confided in her mother that she was concerned that she no longer had a relationship with her father and that her child would never know Cole. Starr hoped that Todd was making an attempt to change his life. Blair told Starr that she didn't think Todd was capable of changing. Defending her father, Starr believed that her father had always wanted to change. Stating that Todd had always wanted a family more than anything, Starr thought it was sad the way he always destroyed the lives of his loved ones. \n\n\nAt Todd's residence, Todd watched as Marty placed Bree in her crib. Explaining that Jessica had left Bree in her care, Marty wondered where Jessica had gone. While looking down at Bree, Marty had another vision of a young boy. After telling Todd about her recurring memory of the young boy, Marty asked Todd if she had ever had a child. With a panicked look, Todd assured Marty that she never gave birth to a child and suggested that she was having memories of someone else's child. Believing Todd's lies, Marty convinced herself that a woman could never forget the birth of her own child and remarked that perhaps she would one day have a baby of her own. When Marty asked Todd about the birth of his children, she was surprised to learn that he hadn't been present during the births of both Jack and Sam. Realizing that Todd was consumed with guilt, Marty reminded him that they would soon take custody of Starr's unborn child. Stating that she and Todd would raise the child in a positive environment, Marty was certain that once the child was born that Todd would no longer feel guilt. Todd didn't appear convinced. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina stood on the patio and did her best to set off the explosives that she had secured to the safe that contained the Mendorran jewels. Meanwhile, Tess headed toward the safe with the intention of retrieving the jewels for her own purposes. Upon noticing the dynamite secured to the safe, Tess went in search of Tina. Unable to ignite her homemade bomb, Tina struggled to figure out what had gone wrong. Holding the sticks of dynamite in her hands, Tess informed Tina that she had defused the devise. \n\n\nPleading with Tess to hand over the jewels, Tina informed her niece that David Vickers was being held hostage and would only be returned in exchange for the jewels. While Tina's attention was diverted, Tess placed the sticks of dynamite in her purse. When Tess ridiculed Tina and refused to turn over the jewels, Tina threatened to expose Tess's dirty deeds to Viki. Unmoved by Tina's threats, Tess mocked Tina and began opening the safe. As Tess unlocked the safe, Tina approached Tess from behind with a fireplace poker. Without turning around, Tess warned Tina that she would be condemned for attacking a pregnant woman, and continued to unlock the safe. While a saddened Tina witnessed Tess remove the jewels from the safe, she begged her niece to reconsider. Informing Tina of her plans to flee with Bree, Tess said that she needed to cash the jewels in so that she could support herself on the run. Before leaving, Tess placed a small gem in Tina's hand and suggested that she make do with what she had. Alone, Tina vowed to save Natalie and Jared after she retrieved David Vickers from Cain. \n\n\nTess returned to Todd's home and peeked in on a sleeping Bree. Displaying the gems, Tess told her daughter that she had a present for her. Next, Tess opened her purse and removed the sticks of dynamite. She announced that she had plans to take care of Natalie and Jared and intended to surprise them the next day. \n\n\nViki and Charlie paid Roxy a visit at the Angel Square Hotel. When Charlie inquired if Jared had left a message for him, Roxy became suspicious and asked about Natalie. Viki and Charlie informed Roxy that Natalie, Jared, and Jessica were missing. Viki also revealed that Jessica might be ill. A worried Roxy suggested that they light candles for Rex, Natalie, Jessica, and Jared. The parents lit candles and prayed for their children's safety and health. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Rex opened his eyes after Gigi begged him to return to her and Shane. Out in the foyer, as Marcie listened, Adriana scolded Mike about leaving Rex alone and attempted to enter the living room. Citing that he needed to examine Rex further, Mike asked Adriana to give him and the nurse a few more moments alone with Rex. Upon entering the living room, Mike was amazed to find Rex with his eyes opened. After examining Rex, Mike happily announced to Gigi that Rex was awake and his vitals were good. Mike told Gigi that he was obligated to tell Adriana about Rex's recovery, but Gigi begged Mike to allow her a few more moments alone with Rex. Mike complied. Alone with Marcie, Adriana revealed that she would do anything to bring Rex back. When Marcie questioned if Adriana really meant what she had said, Adriana assured her that she did. \n\n\nJoining Marcie and Adriana in the foyer, Mike told Adriana and Marcie that Rex's condition had improved, but continued to make up excuses in an attempt to keep Adriana from interrupting Gigi and Rex. Back in the living room, Gigi beamed with joy when Rex told her that she was the most beautiful sight that he had ever seen. Revealing that she had a very short time to spend with him, Gigi gave Rex a quick update of what had taken place. Gigi told Rex that Brody had lost touch with reality and fired a gun on Llantano Mountain. Upon learning that he had shielded Gigi and Shane from Brody's bullet, Rex inquired about Shane's condition. Gigi happily announced to Rex that Shane was aware that Rex was his father. Rex listened as Gigi told him about Adriana's desperate attempt to keep them apart. After detailing his dream about fighting to get back to his family, Rex told Gigi that he knew that she would bring him back. \n\n\nThrilled by news of Rex's recovery, Adriana was fed up with Mike's excuses and demanded to see Rex. As Mike protested, Adriana entered the living room. To her horror, Adriana witnessed Gigi give Rex a kiss. Unnoticed, Adriana observed Gigi and Rex from behind a hospital curtain. With tears in her eyes, Adriana listened as the two expressed their love for each other. When Rex mentioned that he had returned to be with his family, a despondent Adriana attempted to leave the room but bumped into the hospital curtain - alerting Rex and Gigi to her presence. \n\n\nAlone in the foyer, Mike and Marcie expressed their joy over Rex's recovery. Marcie thanked Mike for intervening and helping Gigi reunite with Rex. Deep in thought, Mike remarked that no matter how much two people loved each other that sometimes the obstacles were too large to overcome. \n\n\nIn the living room, as Rex and Gigi stared at Adriana, an uncomfortable silence filled the room. Breaking the silence, Gigi attempted to speak, but Adriana told her to shut up because she had something to say. After remarking to Gigi that she didn't like her and believed that she and Rex would still be together if Gigi had never entered their lives, Adriana then turned her attention to Rex. Admitting that she had destroyed her relationship with Rex due to her inability to trust him, Adriana told Rex that she loved him but promised herself that she would do the right thing. As Gigi watched, Adriana kissed Rex and told him that she was letting him go. Tears streaming down her face, Adriana left the room. Returning to Rex's side, Gigi gave him a loving kiss. \n\n\n",
