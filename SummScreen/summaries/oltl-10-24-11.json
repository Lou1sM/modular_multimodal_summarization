However, Todd is haunted by Irene's ghost reminding him he murdered her as well as his brother and she wants to enable him to get away with it. So he rushes into the courtroom and admits to the judge that Tomas is innocent and taking the rap for him. Tomas reluctantly admits that that is true. the judge then lets them both go and is angry with Nora for wasting the court's time with two suspects to prosecute that the judge does not want to prosecute. It seems everybody doubts that Todd killed Victor except for Nora who reveals she has personal reasons for wanting to nail Todd. After Cutter gets back form the Kentucky hospital where he sees the Gigi lookalike with amnesia, he goes to find Rex and tells him he can \"get Gigi back\" in exchange for Rex signing Clint's wealth over to Cutter instead of to Clint. Rex then physically attacks Cutter. Bo goes to intervene. Yet. in Kentucky, the Gigi lookalike is online researching the history of Gigi and of Stacy."
