Marty demanded to be let through to help look for Starr and Hope, and she threatened to start asking questions about Brody's extreme interest in Natalie's baby. Marty had overheard the conversation between Natalie and Brody, and it seemed almost as though Brody was the baby's father, Marty yelled.\n\n\nChaos suddenly ensued as Eli detonated the explosives he'd set around the building. There was shattering glass, fire, and smoke all around as the warehouse began to cave in. Cole went to pieces, and he shouted that Hope and Starr were inside. He made a quick run into the building without anyone spotting him. He frantically called out for Starr in the darkness as the ceiling continued to fall, and he dodged the sparks that flashed nearby. Suddenly, a part of the ceiling plunged on top of him, and he was stuck underneath it.\n\n\n Todd and Dani were close to the building, and they were knocked to the ground. Todd awakened and found Dani lying close to him. She was unconscious. There was commotion everywhere.\n\n\nJohn wrestled Eli to the floor of the van, put him in handcuffs, and read Eli his rights. The cops took Eli away. John wanted to go into the warehouse to look for Blair, but Bo stopped him. John informed Bo that T\u00e9a was alive, and there was a possibility that she was in the warehouse also. Brody took over the watch on Eli, and he demanded to know where T\u00e9a was. Brody advised his prisoner that Greg had regained consciousness. He also threatened to make Eli's life miserable. Eli had nothing to say regarding T\u00e9a.\n\n\nCole began to move, but he realized he was unable to get himself out from under the collapsed ceiling. John entered the building and called out for Starr and Blair. Weakly, Cole tried to yell John's name. Eventually, John found Cole under the debris and did his best to move it off of Cole. The younger man wanted John to forget about him and continue the search for Starr and Hope. John refused to leave Cole until he was able to set Cole free, but he promised to find the girls. Finally, Cole was out from under the rubble.\n\n\nStill standing outside the barriers, Natalie obtained the latest information via walkie-talkie and related it to Marty. It appeared that the girls were still inside the warehouse. Marty began to panic, and Natalie attempted to calm her down. Natalie finally agreed that Marty could get closer to the warehouse to see what was happening. Todd managed to carry Dani to the barriers for medical aid.\n\n\nTodd asked Natalie to call John and order him to go into the building to continue the search for all the girls. Natalie placed a call to Brody on the walkie-talkie, but Brody was evasive. He told her that John was \"managing the situation.\" Natalie was able to read into the statement, and she knew that John had gone into the building. Brody admitted that was true, but he wanted Natalie to stay calm because she and her baby had to remain safe.\n\n\nThe emergency medical technicians examined a still unresponsive Dani, but Todd leaned over his daughter and grabbed her hand. He called her Daniela and joked that he couldn't say it as well as T\u00e9a. He asked Dani to squeeze his hand if she were able to hear him, and she did. He told her that he wanted to return to the building to look for Starr and Hope.\n\n\nTodd stopped Marty from leaving, and they had some words. Marty wanted to look for Cole but Todd wanted Marty to look after Dani. He promised to get word back to Marty, and she relented. Todd added that no one knew what had happened to Blair either. After he left, Dani moved her lips. \"Mom,\" she mouthed.\n\n\nBo kept busy with his men and the firemen, and he noted that the smoke was getting thicker. He wasn't sure who was still inside, he confessed to one of the firefighters. He thought that there might be several people in the warehouse. Brody continued to manhandle Eli and peppered him with questions about T\u00e9a. Eli refused to talk, but he yelled again that if he couldn't have his wife, then Todd couldn't have his. Brody demanded that Eli explain himself, but Eli invoked the Fifth Amendment and vowed to stay silent.\n\n\nBrody continued to rough Eli up. \"If T\u00e9a turns out to be in that warehouse,\" Brody began to threaten. Eli interrupted and finished the sentence. \"She'll be dead again,\" he declared. Eli thought it convenient that T\u00e9a had already had a funeral. He suggested that Brody concern himself with who wasn't in the warehouse. Brody didn't understand Eli's cryptic statement.\n\n\nJohn helped Cole out of the building, but Cole was beside himself when he learned that there had still been no sign of Starr and Hope. Brody advised John that there had been no word on T\u00e9a, and John was determined to go back into the warehouse. Todd returned from the safe area and demanded that he be allowed to go inside with John. The firefighters attempted to hold John and Todd back, but they were unsuccessful.\n\n\nNatalie related the news that Cole was safe, and a relieved Marty asked for a walkie-talkie so that she might talk to her son. Natalie remained by Dani's side. Dani was able to talk, and she asked what had happened. She wanted to know where her mom was, and she grew hysterical. Natalie calmed her down and disclosed that she knew that T\u00e9a was still alive. Dani revealed that T\u00e9a had been in the warehouse.\n\n\nAt the hospital, the Evans family grew flustered and out of control after Greg made his announcement. \"Destiny, I'm your father,\" he told the teenage girl. Everyone began to holler as Destiny broke into tears. Mrs. Evans attempted to comfort Destiny and assured her she was still their daughter. Mr. Evans clarified, \"We're your grandparents.\" Shaun declared that he hadn't known anything as Destiny realized he was no longer her brother but her uncle.\n\n\nGreg revealed that he had just started medical school when a girl he'd been seeing had turned out to be pregnant. Mrs. Evans helped with the story, as she added that she'd been a social worker, and had planned on placing the newborn little girl with another family. After she and her husband had seen the little girl, they'd decided to keep her. Mr. Evans interjected that they'd always wanted a little girl. Destiny tearfully made it clear that her father had been planning to give her to strangers, and she'd just learned that she'd been lied to for her entire life.\n\n\n\"We are still a family,\" Mrs. Evans announced. \"You're not supposed to lie to the people you love,\" Destiny responded as she continued to cry. Shaun began to shout at his parents and his brother for what they'd done to Destiny and him. Greg insisted that he'd only done what he'd thought was best. Destiny asked about her real mother. She deserved to know who her mother was, Destiny demanded.\n\n\nReluctantly, Greg stated that she had been a girl from the neighborhood, but she'd moved on. Shaun was angry, and he asked why his brother had taken orders from a murderer. Quietly, Greg spoke up. There was more to the story, he said. The girl had not been his girlfriend, but Shaun's girlfriend. It was the woman whom Shaun had been in love with. \"Charlene,\" Shaun stated in a flat and emotionless voice. Greg reminded Shaun that Shaun had been in prison at the time, and Greg and Charlene had been working on Shaun's appeal. It had all happened out of nowhere, Greg continued, and it never should have happened.\n\n\nMrs. Evans maintained that Destiny was a gift, but Destiny sobbed that her mother didn't want her. Greg pronounced that he hadn't wanted to hurt Shaun, and Charlene had never stopped loving Shaun. Greg just hadn't been thinking, and he had been wrong. Shaun was livid, and he accused Greg of taking something from him just as he always had. Shaun darted over to his brother's bedside and began to close his hands around Greg's throat. Everyone began to shout as Shaun continued to choke his brother. Finally, Mr. Evans managed to pull Shaun away from Greg.\n\n\nThe family was falling apart as they continued to shout at each other. Destiny wanted more information from Greg, but Mr. Evans repeated that Charlene had run off. Greg spoke up and announced that it was time for the truth. He had been trying to protect Shaun, but the truth was that Charlene was dead. A sobbing Destiny ran out of the room as everyone else stood there, speechless.\n\n\nAt Marty's house, Hannah accused James of spying on her. She advised him that Cole and Marty had gone to the warehouse to help locate Starr and Hope so they could take them home. James wondered if Hannah really believed that was actually going to happen. Hannah insisted that everyone wanted Starr and Hope to arrive home safely, and she told James that the mother and daughter were in the abandoned warehouse. James wanted to head over there, and he invited Hannah to join him. Hannah was positive that the cops would prevent them from getting close, and she thought it would be better to remain at the house to wait for Marty and Cole.\n\n\nJames didn't believe Hannah, but he proclaimed that she was probably right. Much to Hannah's dismay, he agreed to wait with her after all. Hannah quickly assured him that she didn't need a babysitter, and she pushed for James to go to the site. He refused and disclosed that he didn't really believe that Hope and Starr were at the warehouse. Hannah asked where he thought they might be, and James advised Hannah that he was certain that Hannah already knew. Hannah insisted that Eli had them, but James wondered why Starr hadn't been given the phone during the call that Todd had received.\n\n\nJames believed that Hannah was \"fighting for Starr\" in order to get a clear shot at Cole, and furthermore, he knew that Hannah's story about finding the bullet necklace wasn't true. Hannah disagreed, but James stated that he had spoken with Cole about it, and James was certain that Hannah had taken the necklace from around Starr's neck. Hannah had done it because she was obviously obsessed with Cole, James concluded. Hannah called James's opinion insane. \"Exactly,\" James answered. That was why Hannah had a full-time shrink, he pronounced.\n\n\n\"Give it up, Hannah. Game over,\" James said. Hannah noted that Starr liked to play games too. She grabbed her purse and reached inside. She grabbed the gun, but she put it down and picked up the baseball instead. She handed it to James, and he looked it over. She told him to figure out where she had obtained it, and she pronounced that it was a good thing she'd found it first.\n\n\nJames grabbed her arms. \"Take your hands off of me or else you'll never see either one of them again,\" Hannah threatened gruffly. James backed away anxiously. He only wanted to know where they were, he pleaded with Hannah. Hannah was annoyed. She just knew that James would ruin everything and try to save Starr. She announced that Starr didn't deserve Cole, and Cole belonged to Hannah.\n\n\nLocked in Hannah's attic, Starr comforted Hope and lamented how much she missed Hope's daddy. Starr decided that a new plan was in order because she wanted to be ready for Hannah when Hannah returned. \"Sorry, Hannah, you lose,\" Starr exclaimed.\n\n\nAt the diner, Gigi helped Cristian look at artwork for a slide show for class. They talked about some of the art, and Gigi admitted how difficult it had been for her to sketch a nude male model. Cristian stressed that one had to look at the model as an object, and he wouldn't think of it as more than a bowl of fruit. He denied that he would be flustered if he'd had to look at a nude female model. Gigi urged Cristian to phone Layla, and he took her advice. Sadly, he was unable to reach Layla, citing an \"all circuits are busy\" problem.\n\n\nGigi assured him that being apart from Layla would get easier. Cristian pointed out that Gigi had done it, but Gigi reminded him that she and Rex were a different story. She'd had no contact with Rex over the years. Cristian worried that his situation could turn out the same, but Gigi was positive that things would work out. She explained that it was complicated at first, but it would all begin to make sense. Soon enough, a beautiful woman would be there, waiting for him, she added. He just had to give it time.\n\n\nCristian and Gigi completed the project. Cristian thought that Gigi was lucky. She had waited and had both Rex and Shane in her life. Gigi pointed out that Cristian had Layla. Cristian knew that things would work out.\n\n\nShaun insisted that he be the one to go after Destiny. His parents repeated that they hadn't known about Charlene, and Greg swore he had been trying to protect his brother. Shaun thought that Greg had really tried to protect \"his own sorry ass\" instead. He ran into the hallway after Destiny and wrapped his arms around her. Greg told his parents that Eli had wanted to reveal what had happened to Charlene. \"I killed her,\" Greg confessed.\n\n\nJohn and Todd forced their way inside the building and began to search for those who were still missing. Suddenly, there was a loud crashing in the dark. It was so loud that everyone on the outside heard it. Brody cuffed Eli to the police car and began to run for the warehouse. All the help on the site did the same. Cole was left alone. He picked up an evidence bag that had been left behind and began to rummage through it. He found a gun in a plastic bag and, wordlessly, walked up to Eli and shot him.\n\n\nStarr finished setting up her trap and pulled a large, heavy box up to the ceiling on a pulley. When the door opened, she dropped it on the person who walked through it. James's red shirt was underneath the box.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cops and paramedics and all interested parties find the warehouse where Eli has been holding Tea and Dani. Blair manages to escape with Tea. Eli activates the bomb. Dani rushes in to save her mother and gets injured, but nobody has died. Cole rushes in hoping to find Starr and Hope but scrap metal falls on him. Outside Marty's home, James corners Hannah and tells her he bets she knows where Star and Hope are and it's not at the place where Eli has kept the others. He knows that it was she who kidnapped them. Knowing he can't prove it, she smirks. But he's determined to save them although he still hasn't a clue where they are. Greg confesses for the first time to Destiny and Shaun, that he is not Destiny's brother. He's her father. She demands to know who her biological mom was. He admits that it was Shaun's old girlfriend, Charlene, who promised to wait for him while he was in prison many years ago. And he has deeper and darker secrets about that.",
