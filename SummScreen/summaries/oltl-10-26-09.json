Acknowledging that he was in love with Kyle, Fish informed Cris that Fish's relationship with Kyle was doomed because Kyle had agreed to marry Nick.  Cristian related that gay marriages were illegal in the state of Pennsylvania, but Fish explained that Kyle had agreed to marry Nick in an attempt to make a political statement.  Convinced that Kyle was still in love with Fish, Cristian expressed his thoughts on the matter.  Reminding Fish that he had hurt Kyle in the past, Cristian was certain that Kyle wanted to make Fish pay and fight for Kyle's love.\n\n\nKyle didn't appear pleased when Nick arrived at his apartment, carrying a garment bag that contained the tuxedo that Nick expected Kyle to wear at the wedding ceremony.  Upon realizing that Kyle had mixed feelings about their pending nuptials, Nick questioned if Kyle still had feelings for Fish.  Insisting that Fish was aware of Kyle's upcoming wedding to Nick, Kyle attempted to reassure Nick that Kyle no longer desired Fish.  Kyle was surprised when Nick asked him not to go ahead with the wedding if he was having second thoughts.  Nick told his lover that he didn't want Kyle to resent him later.  Kyle thanked Nick for being understanding, and agreed to marry Nick as planned.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica panicked when she heard the mysterious phone call.  A voice that sounded very much like Nash stated, \"Baby, it's me, Nash!  Please help me, I'm so cold Jessica!\"  Upon hearing Jessica's screams, Viki and Charlie rushed to her aid.  Viki and Charlie were both stunned when Jessica claimed that she had received a call from Nash.  Charlie tried to learn the identity of the caller, but the caller identification read, \"Caller Unknown.\"  Viki immediately contacted John McBain.\n\n\nWhen John arrived at Llanfair, he questioned Jessica about the strange call.  Although she admitted that there had been some interference in the phone call, Jessica was convinced that the voice on the other end had belonged to Nash.  Jessica, Viki, and Charlie were startled when John informed them that he had placed a wire tap on their calls.  Relating that their personal calls would remain private, John stated that he wanted to perform a voice analysis of the call.  John told the family that he would need a documented sample of Nash's voice in order to complete a voice comparison.  Jessica presented John with a taped message that Nash had left for her a few days before his death.   John accepted the tape from Jessica and placed a call to Fish.\n\n\nBack at the apartment, Fish wondered if Cristian had admitted his true feelings to Layla.  After confessing that he had kissed Layla, Cristian explained that Layla didn't want to pursue a relationship with him because she feared that it would mean that she had betrayed Evangeline.  Relating that Layla wouldn't become involved with him unless she received her sister's blessings, Cristian sadly revealed that scenario would never take place because Evangeline was in a coma.  While the friends agreed that their situations were similar, Fish received a call from John, requesting his assistance at Llanfair.\n\n\nOnce Fish had left, Layla returned to the apartment and appeared uncomfortable once she learned that Fish had left moments earlier.  When Cristian explained Fish's dilemma involving Kyle, Layla expressed her concern for their roommate.  While Christian insisted that Fish had waited too long to admit his feelings for Kyle, Layla wondered if the relationship wasn't meant to be.  Moving closer to Layla, Cristian stated, \"Maybe I  shouldn't have never taken no for an answer, and risk regretting it for the rest of my life!\"  Ignoring Cristian's comment, Layla stated that she felt bad  for Fish and Kyle.  Cristian replied, \"Yeah, but I feel worse for you and me!\"\n\n\nWhen Fish arrived at Llanfair, John gave him a quick update on the mysterious phone call, and asked Fish to perform a voice comparison.  Reminding John that he was on administrative leave, Fish questioned why John had sought out his help.  John insisted that Fish was the only person he trusted to perform the job.  After Fish explained how to retrieve the test results, John instructed him to leave at once.  Before leaving, Fish asked John to do everything within his power to conclude the investigation against Fish.  John promised to help his friend.  Relating that he missed his job, Fish told John that police work was his life.   John replied, \"Don't let it be!\"\n\n\nSeconds later, the result of the voice comparison was completed.  Observing the computer monitor, Jessica, Viki, and Charlie were stunned when the results concluded that Nash's voice and the voice of the caller were an identical match.  Jessica and Viki asked John for an explanation, but he had none.\n\n\nKyle tried to study, but couldn't take his eyes off the tuxedo that Nick had given him.  Kyle began to have flashbacks of past conversations with Fish.  Kyle recalled how Fish had proclaimed his love for him.  A knock on the door interrupted Kyle's thoughts.   Kyle was surprised to find Fish on his doorstep.\n\n\nT\u00e9a stormed into La Boulaie and called out to Blair.  As she headed upstairs to locate Blair, T\u00e9a's cell phone rang.  It was Danielle.\n\n\nInside Matthew's dorm room at the International Warwick Academy, Matthew inquired about Danielle.  Tom advised Matthew to watch himself around Danielle and referred to her as a \"b itch.\"  Matthew appeared intrigued by his new schoolmate, Danielle.\n\n\nMeanwhile, out in the hall, Danielle phoned T\u00e9a.  Describing how terrible the boys were at her school, Danielle begged her mother to allow her to return home.  Urging her daughter to give the boarding school a chance, T\u00e9a told Danielle that she couldn't grant Danielle's request to return home.  At that moment, Ross entered La Boulaie and demanded to know who T\u00e9a was talking to.   \n\n\nUpon hearing Ross's voice, Danielle asked to speak to her father.  Lying to her daughter, T\u00e9a insisted that Danielle had mistaken the television for Ross's voice, and quickly ended the call.  Realizing that T\u00e9a had been speaking with Danielle, Ross attempted to grab the phone.  After an intense struggle, T\u00e9a retrieved her phone and deleted the address book.  Heading upstairs, T\u00e9a warned Ross to stay away from Danielle.\n\n\nIn Blair's upstairs bedroom, Blair attempted to seduce Todd.  Blair pulled Todd on the bed and the two shared a passionate kiss. When Todd pulled away, Blair questioned if Todd was still in love with T\u00e9a.  Todd told Blair that he thought he had changed due to T\u00e9a's influence.  Hurt by Blair's revelation that T\u00e9a had teamed up with Ross to steal Todd's fortune, Todd admitted that he couldn't believe that T\u00e9a had plotted against him.  \n\n\nTodd wondered if Blair was certain about her claims against T\u00e9a.  With a devilish smile, Blair assured Todd that T\u00e9a and Ross were running a scam on Todd.   Ignoring Blair's advances, a confused Todd insisted that he needed to slow down and stop making drastic moves.  Drawing Todd close, Blair pouted. \"I understand how you feel, but I just don't want to be alone tonight!\"  Todd responded by giving Blair a passionate kiss.\n\n\nAs Todd and Blair prepared to make love, T\u00e9a barged into the bedroom.  A horrified T\u00e9a chastised Todd for falling for Blair's tricks once again.  As Blair and T\u00e9a began to argue, Todd suggested that T\u00e9a leave, but she continued to criticize his predictable behavior.   Fed up with T\u00e9a, Todd revealed that he had learned of T\u00e9a's plan.  Todd announced that Blair had remembered that T\u00e9a and Ross had planned a scheme to steal from him.  As T\u00e9a  stared at Todd and Blair in disbelief, Blair claimed that T\u00e9a had admitted to plotting against Todd before T\u00e9a pushed Blair out of the window.  \n\n\nA startled Ross entered the bedroom and spotted Blair in a compromising position with Todd.  In disgust Ross exclaimed, \"You're back with that loser?\"  Realizing that Todd didn't know about Danielle, a relieved T\u00e9a  tried to convince Ross to leave with her, but Todd cornered him and questioned Ross's plot against him.  Upon learning that Blair had lied to Todd, Ross played along and, to T\u00e9a's relief, didn't mention Danielle.  After criticizing Todd and Blair's sick relationship, T\u00e9a and Ross exited the bedroom.\n\n\nAlone with Blair, Todd admitted that he hadn't believed Blair's claims until T\u00e9a failed to deny the accusation.  Reminding Todd that T\u00e9a had married him for money in the past, Blair insisted that T\u00e9a was up to her old tricks.  With a look of regret, Todd declared, \"She didn't deserve my love!\"  A devilish smirk crossed Blair's face.\n\n\nDownstairs, Ross pointed out that he had kept T\u00e9a's secret from Todd, and demanded that T\u00e9a allow Ross to see his daughter.  Walking away, T\u00e9a advised Ross to stop looking for Danielle.\n\n\nAt the International Warwick Academy, Matthew located Danielle and apologized for using her cell phone.  A distraught Danielle confided in Matthew that she hated her parents.  When a curious Matthew questioned what had caused Danielle to distrust her parents, he was surprised to learn that she had been tricked into attending boarding school, just as he had.  While Danielle expressed her anger that her mother was keeping her away from her father, Matthew related that his parents had shipped him out of the country, in an attempt to prevent him from having surgery.\n\n\nThe teens compared stories and soon learned that their circumstances were similar.  Although she was upset by her mother's betrayal, Danielle admitted that her mother was a great lawyer and could probably help Matthew.   When Matthew referred to himself as a cripple, Danielle quickly corrected him, and insisted that Matthew's disability didn't make him any less of a person.  Touched by her kind words, Matthew asked if he would see her around.  Walking away, Danielle gave Matthew a friendly smile and replied, Where am I gonna go?\"\n\n\n",
