    "soap_central": "\n\nCole aimed at and shot Eli, who was handcuffed to a police car. \"That was for killing Starr,\" Cole told the murderer. \"And this is for Hope,\" Cole stated as he shot Eli again. He dropped the gun.\n\n\nJust then, Marty arrived and glimpsed Eli slumped against the car. She went over to check the body and saw that he was dead. She wanted an explanation from Cole, but he cried and was barely able to talk. He told her that no one had survived the explosion if they were inside the warehouse. Eli had murdered Starr and Hope, and Cole had found Eli alone and unguarded at the police car.\n\n\nMarty ordered Cole to leave. She advised him that Eli had been handcuffed and defenseless, and Cole had killed Eli in cold blood. Cole had a record, and he would be put away forever. Cole didn't care what happened to him, but Marty cried out that she couldn't lose him. Cole didn't want to leave, since Starr and Hope weren't around any longer. Marty just wanted him to run. \"Do it for me,\" she urged. She would meet up with him eventually.\n\n\nDani was hysterical as she waited on a stretcher for an ambulance. She stammered and tripped over her words as she told Natalie that T\u00e9a was in the destroyed warehouse. Natalie was certain that John would be able to rescue anyone who had remained in the building. He would never leave the site without everyone, she declared. She had her hands full as Dani climbed off of the stretcher and refused to be still. Dani advised Natalie that Starr and Hope had not been in the building, but she had no idea where they might be. Dani wanted Natalie to go to the warehouse, but Natalie refused to leave Dani by herself.\n\n\nDani was happy when Nate showed up, and he was thrilled to find his girlfriend. Dani urged Natalie to find out what had happened at the warehouse. Nate would stay with her, Dani promised. Natalie agreed to go against orders, since people's lives were at stake. Nate apologized to Dani for trying to hide her from Ross. She might have ended up in Tahiti, but at least she would have been safe, he said solemnly. Dani didn't think so, since Eli had concocted a plot involving her custody.\n\n\nNate was also sorry that Ross had died, and Dani began to cry. She had loved him, but there was a miracle. She told Nate that her mother was alive. \"Now she needs another miracle,\" Dani said. Nate was shocked to hear about T\u00e9a, and he couldn't wait to see Destiny's face. Dani expected it to be the same look that she herself had had when she'd realized that Starr and Hope were gone. She could only pray that they had gotten away safely.\n\n\nCole turned and left, and Marty picked up the gun that Cole had dropped. Natalie walked over right at that very moment. \"I shot him.\" Marty uttered. Natalie saw that Eli was dead. She turned to Marty. \"You did this,\" Natalie stated. She held out a plastic bag so that Marty could drop the gun inside for evidence.\n\n\nMarty explained that she had found Eli alone and without any guards. She recalled all that Eli had done, including killing her granddaughter. She could have sat and waited for justice, Marty ranted, but Eli would have probably gotten off on a technicality. Quietly, Natalie advised her that Eli hadn't killed Starr and Hope because Dani had reported that they hadn't been in the warehouse. Astonished, Marty wanted to run off to find Cole, but she had no idea where he might have gone.\n\n\nInside the warehouse, T\u00e9a opened her eyes after the explosion and saw Blair lying nearby. The last thing T\u00e9a remembered was Blair taking off T\u00e9a's bindings. Both women were okay as they tried to figure out where they were. T\u00e9a commented that she wanted her money back if they were in heaven. Blair assured her they weren't in heaven, and she wanted T\u00e9a to be optimistic. T\u00e9a recalled being trapped with Blair in the KAD fraternity house. Blair assured T\u00e9a that Dani really needed her mother.\n\n\nT\u00e9a began to call for help, but Blair thought the building was too insecure. She wanted T\u00e9a to stop shouting. T\u00e9a was certain that someone would find them. Blair admitted that she had sneaked into the building while she'd waited in the van for Eli. No one knew that she was in there.\n\n\n\"So it's just you and me, huh?\" T\u00e9a asked. She told Blair that she didn't have a brain tumor. She explained how Eli had managed to have Greg make T\u00e9a sick and die for custody of Dani and the money. Blair advised her that Eli had changed T\u00e9a's will, and Blair and Todd had tried to fight it.\n\n\nThe women couldn't figure out why Greg had been involved, but T\u00e9a knew she was alive thanks to Greg's guilty conscience. Blair divulged that Todd had been a wreck, but he had been there for Dani. He had been \"falling apart inside\" all along, she added. He had even thought he'd heard T\u00e9a's voice in a phone call, Blair admitted. T\u00e9a revealed that he had, and she explained the phone call and the nurse who had taken the phone away. She had known everything would be okay after she'd heard Todd's voice, and she would love to hear it again, T\u00e9a concluded.\n\n\nThe women were unable to determine where they were, but Blair began to move pieces of cement and the ceiling. She apologized for getting Eli mixed up in their lives. T\u00e9a was sorry to hear about Blair's wedding fiasco in Tahiti. Dani had told her all about it. Blair admitted that Todd had been dependable through all the turmoil. \"I must have been gone longer than I thought,\" T\u00e9a proclaimed.\n\n\nBo, Brody, and the fire chief discussed the explosion and the people who might still be inside the building. Bo was unable to confirm that Starr and Hope were among them. He was only certain that Todd and John had been inside, and he refused to \"write off\" anyone else. He realized that Blair was unaccounted for also. As they stood there, parts of the ceiling fell down on them. Brody verified that Eli was cuffed to the police cruiser. He had news for Bo also. It was possible that T\u00e9a was also in the warehouse, as she hadn't really died. \"At least when we thought she did,\" he added.\n\n\nBrody told a shocked Bo about Eli's plot and what had possibly happened at Cherryvale. The two men agreed to separate to look for survivors. Bo suddenly bent over and picked up John's badge. Brody assumed that John was dead, but Bo didn't want to hear it. Brody ranted about Eli and wondered how the monster could have killed a child.\n\n\nSitting in the dark, Todd called out for John, but he didn't get an answer. As the emergency lights flickered, Todd walked around and finally found John lying unconscious on the ground. Todd realized they were trapped and looked upward as if to heaven. He asked T\u00e9a what he should do, and he wasn't happy with the answer. He walked over to John and leaned down to give him CPR. \"At least no one has to know, right?\" Todd muttered. \"Don't even think about it, Manning,\" John growled as he opened his eyes.\n\n\nTodd promised that he only wanted John's help to locate Starr, Hope, and Blair. \"Oh, yeah, so you try to make out with me?\" John asked. John realized that his shoulder had been dislocated, and he wanted Todd's aid in popping it back into place. Todd was reluctant, but John ordered him to do it. He gave Todd directions, and Todd did as he was told. With a quick yank, the deed was done. John screamed in agony. Blair and T\u00e9a heard the scream, but they assumed it was an animal.\n\n\nStarr rigged up her trap in Hannah's attic, where she and Hope were imprisoned. When the door opened, she dropped a heavy box on the person who walked in. Unfortunately, it was James. \"That is no way to greet your boyfriend,\" Hannah exclaimed as she walked in behind James. She laughed as she pointed her gun at Starr. James had wanted to follow Hannah and \"play hero,\" Hannah told Starr. Starr was positive that Cole would be able to figure things out, too, but Hannah didn't think so. Cole and Marty had run off to the warehouse for the ransom exchange, she informed Starr.\n\n\nHannah had wanted to kill James earlier, but she thought he and Starr should have a final reunion. Starr pleaded for Hannah to let them go, and she promised never to tell anyone what Hannah had done. Hannah didn't believe her, but she promised that she had a \"perfect plan.\" She left the attic to get things ready. \"You bitch,\" Starr yelled at Hannah after she left. She turned to James and managed to wake him up. \"Hey, Twinkle,\" James murmured. He assured Starr he was fine.\n\n\nStarr pointed to Hope and told James how she'd tried to do the best she could to take care of her daughter. She'd thought that no one would ever find them, she told James tearfully. James gave her a hug then walked around the attic. He wanted to find a way out. Starr assured him that she had already tried everything possible. She still couldn't believe that James had found them.\n\n\nJames explained that he'd never bought Hannah's story about finding the bullet necklace, though he hadn't let on at first. \"Did you tell Cole?\" Starr asked. James stated that he'd needed to know for sure before he said anything, and Cole had been extremely distraught.\n\n\nThey discussed how crazy Hannah was. James knew that Hannah wouldn't be able to get between Starr and Cole. Starr couldn't believe that James had risked his life for her and Hope, but James assured her that he owed her after the last time. James firmly believed they'd win against Hannah. He suddenly noticed that Starr was hobbling around, and she told him about her attempt to toss the baseball through the window. James thought it had been a good idea, even if it hadn't worked.\n\n\nJames advised Hope to sit down, and he removed his shirt. He began to rip it, and he wrapped Starr's ankle. Starr was sorry for knocking him out upon his arrival, and James teased that she'd really been trying to kill him. Just then, Hannah returned and said, \"I was right, you two belong together. Just like me and Cole.\" She ordered Starr to get up. \"Get the kid ready. Time for us to go,\" she told the couple. She wouldn't tell them where they were going.\n\n\nCole returned to his apartment and picked up one of Starr's jackets. He held it up to his face and began to cry. Slowly, he sank to the floor. He grabbed a photo of his girls and played the recording on it. Starr's voice rang out, \"Happy Father's Day, daddy.\" He continued to cry.\n\n\nThe fire chief ordered Bo and Brody to leave the premises. Adamantly, Bo announced that without bodies, he refused to declare that anyone was dead. Brody found Natalie and Marty with Eli's body. He was enraged to find Eli dead. Natalie revealed that Marty had been the one to shoot Eli, and before Brody was able to yell, Natalie handed him the plastic-wrapped gun.\n\n\nNatalie wondered whether John had been found, and reluctantly, Brody explained that John and Todd had gone into the building to look for Starr and Hope. There had been another explosion. Natalie took off for the warehouse. \"You really did this?\" Brody asked Marty. \"I did,\" she replied. She told him to do his job. Brody advised Marty that she \"did the whole world a favor.\" He read Marty her rights and cuffed her.\n\n\nBlair and T\u00e9a agreed that they'd gotten away from psycho killers in the past, and it was time for them to work together. They slowly began to remove the concrete and chunks of building in their way. \"I pray we find what we're looking for on the other side,\" T\u00e9a uttered.\n\n\nJohn believed that he and Todd had fallen through the floor and were in an access tunnel. They began to dig their way out. They appeared to be on the other side of a wall from the two women.\n\n\nDani demanded that Nate help her to remove the neck brace she wore. She refused to lose her mom again, and she couldn't just sit there and wait.\n\n\nNatalie found Bo and demanded to be told where she could find John. Bo held her back as she tried to run for the building. He thought that John and Todd had been deep within the building when it exploded. There was a weak foundation, and it was dangerous. He handed over John's badge.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After the explosion when Eli is ready to be taken into custody, but Cole is still unable to find Starr and Hope and believes Eli has killed them, he takes Eli's gun and shoots him. Marty comes by to see what her son has done and reminds him that he will get charged with murder and go in prison for life for having done that when Eli is unarmed and since Cole already has a record. Cole is sullen and tells his mom he doesn't care about his life if Starr and Hope are gone. Meanwhile, James finds Starr and Hope but Hannah finds them and pulls a gun on them. But, she reconsiders knowing that if they are together, she might be able to have Cole and so she might not want to kill them. Blair finds Tea and they attempt to get out of the warehouse but aren't sure how they're going to do it. Todd and John are also trapped. And at the end, Todd comes face to face with Tea for the first time, having believed up until now that she's dead.",
