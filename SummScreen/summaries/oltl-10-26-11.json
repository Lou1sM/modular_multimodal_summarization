He says his options are limited since Victor Junior gave his assets to their Mother, Irene. Viki reminds him that Irene is now dead too. Tina enters and suggests that as Irene and Victor's first-born, everything should now come to her. Viki says she won't take sides and that they need to leave it to the lawyers and let the judge decide. Todd decides that he wants everything back, not just the money but his kids and Blair too. She reminds him that when he disappeared 8 years ago, he and Blair were already divorced. Tomas goes to visit Blair, who slams the door in his face. Eventually she opens it. He tells her that he wants to move forward with her, but he needs to know where she and Todd stand. She tells him that she and Todd share children. They kiss to seal the deal. Cutter goes to Llanfair looking for Stacy. Tina says she had been there and thought she was Gigi Morasco and lived there. Stacy goes to Gigi's gravesite and verifies Tina's claim that Gigi is dead, which makes her wonder who she is and who is in the grave. Jack sees the Gigi look alike when he visits Victor, Junior's grave. He tells her she is dead, he is sorry, and it was an accident. Then he runs home and worries Blair, who observes that he looks as if he has seen a ghost. Cutter finds Stacy and explains to her that she isn't Gigi, Gigi is dead, and she is Gigi's sister, Stacy. He tells her she looks like Gigi because she had plastic surgery so she could steal Gigi's life and more specifically, her fianc\u00e9. Stacy isn't impressed with who Cutter says she is. Rex wants to spend Halloween at Gigi's grave. Shane wants to skip Halloween because it won't be the same without Gigi. Rex suggests that Aubrey join them at the party and dress as the third musketeer in Gigi's place. The three agree. Rex and Shane decide to go to Gigi's grave together before they go to the party."
