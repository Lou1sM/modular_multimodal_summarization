When Sarah remarked how pleased she was with Cris's decision to care for Lola, Cris responded by giving her a kiss. A worried Lola interrupted the couple and expressed her desire to speak with Vanessa. Concerned for Vanessa's well-being, Lola pleaded with Cris to take her to the jail. Cris explained that Vanessa couldn't receive visitors, but encouraged Lola to write her stepmother a letter and promised to deliver it to Vanessa personally. As Lola prepared her letter for Vanessa, Sarah wondered how Cris planned to carry out his promise. Cris stated that he needed a drink. \n\n\nAt the jail, Dorian and Vanessa became acquainted. When Vanessa inquired why Dorian was so fascinated by her, Dorian applauded her for shooting Ray. Explaining that Ray was a terrible person who would have harmed her stepdaughter, Vanessa was adamant that she did what was necessary. Dorian believed that she and Vanessa were very similar - they would both do anything to protect their loved ones. \n\n\nAfter pretending to be intoxicated and punching a police officer, Cris was arrested and placed in a cell adjacent to Vanessa. Announcing that he needed to see her, Cris presented Vanessa with Lola's letter. Once Vanessa had read Lola's letter, she thanked Cris for his help, but warned him to refrain from helping her before he got into serious trouble. Reminding Vanessa that she had helped him escape from prison, Cris refused to give up on her. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Antonio and Talia checked on Ray's progress, but his condition remained critical. Antonio told Talia that Ray had a lot of questions to answer. He believed that Clint had some explaining to do, as well. \n\n\nClint paid Nora a visit at her office. After informing Clint that she had received a call from the Colombian consulate, Nora related to Clint that the Colombian government had claimed that Montez, a convicted felon, had escaped from prison. To Nora's surprise, Clint stated that he was to blame for the events that had transpired and felt responsible for placing Langston's life in danger. Admitting that he had behaved like Asa, Clint acknowledged that Nora had warned him of the consequences, but he had refused to listen to her pleas. Clint insisted that he would make things right, and left the office. Moments later, Nora placed a call and stated, \"I need to see a prisoner!\" \n\n\nBack at the jail, Mel appeared, dressed as a guard, and told Dorian that her presence was required elsewhere. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Markko did his best to assure Langston that the worst was behind them. He was confident that Ray was officially out of their lives and that Langston would remain in Dorian's care. Skeptical that her problem was resolved, Langston reminded Markko that Ray was still alive and expressed her uncertainty about the future. Determined to ease Langston's worries, Markko insisted that they get the answers that they sought. Hand in hand, the two left La Boulaie in a hurry. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the living room, Adriana listened unnoticed as Gigi and Bo visited with Rex. When Rex asked to go home, Gigi informed him that an ambulance was en route and he would be leaving La Boulaie soon. On that note, Adriana spoke up and shared her thoughts. To everyone's surprise, Adriana appeared pleasant and wished Rex a speedy recovery. Rex asked Gigi and Bo to give him a few moments alone with Adriana. Gigi and Bo complied and relocated to the foyer. \n\n\nWorried that Adriana might cause problems, Gigi told Bo that she wanted Rex to have a relationship with Shane. Bo assured Gigi that Rex wanted the same thing. \n\n\nRex thanked Adriana for returning to Llanview to care for him. When Adriana reminded Rex that she had also kept him from Gigi and Shane, Rex defended her actions. Stating that she was doing what she felt was right, Rex told Adriana that he understood that she was only trying to protect him. After a long sigh, Adriana asked Rex for a divorce. Feeling compassion for her, Rex tried to stop Adriana from continuing but she felt the need to express herself. Adriana wondered if she had stayed in Llanview and fought for Rex, if things would have turned out differently. Sadly, Rex assured her that his feelings for Gigi would have remained the same. \n\n\nAppearing to have come to terms with the end of their relationship, Adriana advised Rex that he would be hearing from her attorney. Attempting to ease the tension, Rex continued to thank Adriana for all she had done for him, but Adriana wanted to make a clean break. As Rex mentioned the good times that they once shared, Gigi entered and announced that the ambulance had arrived. Adriana remained hospitable and left the room. Following Adriana out into the foyer, Gigi thanked her for allowing her to stay overnight with Rex and stepping out of the way. Declaring that she did it for Rex, Adriana told Gigi that she was giving Rex a divorce and warned her to treat him right. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Rex told Bo that Adriana had asked for a divorce. Rex admitted to feeling guilt, but also believed that the divorce was necessary. Certain that he could focus on being a father to Shane, Rex asked Bo for help. Although he believed that he still needed help in the area of fatherhood himself, Bo agreed to assist Rex. \n\n\nBefore leaving La Boulaie, Gigi and Bo watched as Rex said goodbye to Adriana. When Rex asked if Adriana planned to return to Paris, she gave a vague answer. Rex wished her a happy life, and she wished him the same. \n\n\nMarkko and Langston arrived at the hospital and attempted to enter Ray's room, but Antonio and Talia prevented them from doing so. Relating that Ray wasn't doing well, Talia suggested that Markko and Langston leave the hospital. Langston wondered if Ray's declining condition meant that he was no longer her guardian. Advising her that the situation was far from over, Talia suggested that Langston hire an attorney and request that the judge reverse his decision, but stated that she was free of Ray for the moment. Clint appeared and declared, \"That's the way it should be!\" \n\n\nLashing out at Clint, Langston rehashed his past actions that had turned her entire life upside down. Clint tried to make amends with Langston, but she refused to listen. Expressing her fear of being sent away with Ray if he recovered, Langston chastised Clint about how his desire for revenge would result in her being forced to go to Colombia with Ray. Promising Langston that she would remain with Dorian, Clint explained that Ray would be sent to a Colombian prison if he survived. Upon learning that Ray was still in critical condition, Clint begged for Langston's forgiveness, and left the hospital. \n\n\nStanding outside of Nora's office, Dorian questioned why Mel had brought her there. Opening the door, Nora asked for a moment alone with Dorian. Before leaving, Mel whispered into Dorian's ear, \"If I were you, I'd play ball!\" Nora invited Dorian into her office and offered her a seat. \n\n\nPlacing a stack of papers in front of Dorian, Nora informed Dorian that the DA's office had a long list of possible charges that could possibly be filed against her. Nora revealed that she was aware that Dorian had hired a hit man to shoot Ray and also had knowledge of Dorian's meetings with Jackie McNaughton. Showing no fear, Dorian denied any involvement. Unmoved by Dorian's confident demeanor, Nora told Dorian that the hired shooter was ready to cut a deal and warned Dorian that she could easily be charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Realizing that Nora had an angle, Dorian questioned what type of deal Nora wanted to negotiate. Insisting that she wanted things to return to normal, Nora offered to drop the charges if Dorian agreed to return Buchanan Enterprises to Clint. Angered by Nora's ultimatum, Dorian placed blame upon Clint and questioned Nora's ethics. Unwilling to argue with Dorian, Nora gave her ten minutes alone to ponder her decision. \n\n\nWhen Ray regained consciousness, Antonio and Talia entered his room to question him. Ray asked to see Lola, but Antonio told him that the child was afraid of him because he had killed her mother. Groggy, Ray stated that he didn't kill Lola's mother. He insisted that Vanessa lied and set him up. \n\n\nMel entered the room and sat guard. When Dorian asked Mel what she should do, Mel warned Dorian about how lonely a life in prison would be. Mel's words appeared to have an effect on Dorian. When Nora returned, she asked Dorian if they had a deal. \n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, upon learning that Ray had regained consciousness, Langston was adamant about visiting her uncle. Markko tried to convince her to stay away from Ray and reminded her that Dorian was her family. To Langston's surprise, Dorian entered the room and the two embraced. Dorian assured Langston that their ordeal with Ray was over. After declaring that nothing would prevent her from coming home to her girls, Dorian was shocked to see Adriana walk downstairs carrying her suitcase. \n\n\nClint returned to the office and told Nora of his meeting with Langston. Realizing that Langston's words had made an impact on Clint, Nora handed him a folder and informed him that he owned B.E. again.\n\n\n",
