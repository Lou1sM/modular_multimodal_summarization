When the girls told Cole and Markko that Dorian expected all of them to attend the wedding, Markko objected.  Markko explained that he refused to risk alienating his father, in order to support Dorian's stunt to win votes.  Langston insisted that Dorian believed in the right for gay people to get married.\n\n\nCole agreed with Markko.  According to Cole, Dorian was using the situation for personal gain, not to fight for civil rights.  Starr and Langston were determined to attend the wedding, despite Cole and Markko's decision to skip the momentous occasion.  Disappointed, Starr and Langston decided to leave, but only made it as far as the hallway before Cole and Markko persuaded them to return to the apartment.  Later, the four friends ate pizza, played cards, and laughed as they enjoyed their time together.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Layla confessed that she felt as if she were taking over the life that Evangeline couldn't have.  Cris argued that they had to move forward with their lives.  Layla was curious what would happen if Evangeline woke up and wanted to work things out with Cris.  Layla wondered if perhaps Cris owed it to Evangeline to try.  Cris accused Layla of being afraid to take a chance with him.\n\n\nLayla denied that she was using Evangeline as an excuse to hide from what she was feeling for Cris.  Layla explained that she couldn't give up the hope that one day Evangeline would wake up.  Cris insisted that he wanted to be with Layla.  He didn't think that Evangeline would object to their relationship.  However, Layla argued that he couldn't know that for certain.\n\n\nLater, as Cris lit a match, he had a fantasy of Layla entering the living room to confess that she was afraid of the past repeating itself.  Cris promised Layla that he would never hurt her.  Cris returned to reality when Layla approached him to reveal that she had decided to move out.  Cris didn't want Layla to feel pressured to move in with her mother, so he offered to move out.  Layla objected, but Cris insisted that it was easier for him to move than it was for Layla to move.\n\n\nAs Cris packed, Layla fantasized about Cris returning to the living room to announce that he had changed his mind; he wanted to work things out with her.  Reality intruded when Cris approached her with a check for rent in one hand and his packed bags in the other hand.  After Cris left, Layla broke down in tears.\n\n\nOliver went to Kyle's apartment to talk to him about their relationship.  When Oliver spotted Kyle's tuxedo, he asked if Kyle truly intended to marry Nick.  Kyle was curious why he should cancel the commitment ceremony.  Oliver confessed that he loved Kyle and that he wanted to explore a relationship with him.  Kyle explained that he wanted more than Oliver was prepared to offer.\n\n\nOliver felt as if Kyle were trying to turn it into a contest between him and Nick.  Kyle clarified that he wasn't; he was just in a different place than Oliver was.  Kyle explained that he needed someone who didn't mind holding hands in public.  Kyle was comfortable with his sexuality and he was ready to settle down with someone who wasn't afraid to let more than a few close friends know that he was involved.\n\n\nOliver was hurt, but assured Kyle that he was happy for Kyle if Nick fulfilled Kyle.  Shortly afterwards Oliver left.  As soon as the door closed, Oliver's eyes filled with tears.  A short time later, Oliver arrived home.  When he saw a teary-eyed Layla, he opened his arms to offer her comfort.\n\n\nIn his apartment, Kyle tried to focus on his books, to no avail.  He appeared preoccupied and restless as he walked around and then stared off into the space.\n\n\nGigi and Schuyler arrived at the carriage house after the concert.  Gigi was curious why Schuyler had agreed to attend the concert with her.  Schuyler admitted that he had hoped to get her mind off of her problems for a while.  Gigi confessed that it had worked; she hadn't thought about Rex or his decision to skip out on their first couples therapy session for hours.\n\n\nGigi and Schuyler then discussed Kim and Stacy's obvious attempt to throw them together.  Gigi and Schuyler confidently agreed that it had been a wasted effort.  After Gigi fetched them each a bottle of beer, Schuyler and Gigi began talking about music.  Eventually, they settled on the sofa to share a set of headphones while they listened to music.  Schuyler was smiling at Gigi when the phone rang.  It was Rex.\n\n\nGigi was furious when Rex told her that he was working on a case and wouldn't be able to make it home.  Gigi realized that the case most likely involved something illegal, since Rex refused to share any details.  Angry, Gigi disconnected the call.  Schuyler decided to leave.  After Schuyler walked out, Gigi slipped the headphones back on and then lit a lighter.\n\n\nAs she stared at the flame, Gigi had a fantasy of Rex arriving home and then apologizing for letting her down.  In the fantasy, Rex promised to attend a therapy session with her on the following day.  Gigi was unaware that while she daydreamed about Rex, he was trying to call her.  The music drowned out the sound of the phone, so eventually Rex ended the call without leaving a message.\n\n\nWhen Schuyler arrived home, he discovered that his power was out.  As he lit a candle, he had a fantasy about Gigi entering his apartment and then kissing him.\n\n\nRex questioned a janitor at an out-of-town motel.  The janitor did not recognize the picture of Jared, but suggested that Rex question the maids.  The janitor explained that he had just started his shift.\n\n\nNatalie sat in a motel room waiting for Jared to call her.  When the phone rang, Natalie jumped.  She hoped that it was Jared, but it wasn't.  Natalie was disappointed to hear John's voice on the other end.  John wanted to know where Natalie was.  Natalie refused to tell him.  When Rex entered the room, Natalie quickly disconnected the call.\n\n\nRex was curious who had been on the phone.  Natalie explained that John had called, but she had refused to reveal where she was.  Rex wondered if Natalie was prepared to go on the run with Jared once they tracked down her husband.  Rex wanted to know what Natalie planned to do if Jared was actually guilty of the murders.\n\n\nRex pleaded with his sister to reconsider her decision; he urged her to convince Jared to turn himself in.  Natalie insisted that it was impossible because John had already made up his mind that Jared was guilty.  Natalie didn't care what she had to give up as long as she was with Jared.\n\n\nLater, as Natalie lit a match, she had a fantasy of Jared knocking on the motel room door.  Jared was thrilled that Natalie had figured out the clue that he had left behind at the lodge.  She snapped back to reality when Rex knocked on the door.  He had forgotten the key.  While Natalie went to the bathroom to change her clothes, Rex called Gigi.\n\n\nLater, Rex fantasized that Gigi had joined him in the motel room.  Gigi promised that they would get through their rough patch and be stronger for it.  Gigi was determined that Stacy would not destroy what Gigi and Rex had built.  Rex returned to reality when Natalie entered the bedroom with a lit match.\n\n\nNatalie realized that the match was a poor substitute for a birthday candle, but she invited Rex to make a wish, anyway.  Rex made his wish and then blew out the match.  Shortly afterwards, Rex settled on the sofa for the night.  In bed, Natalie pulled a picture of Jared out from beneath the pillow and then looked at it.\n\n\nJohn sat in his office, frustrated because Natalie had ended the call.  Marty entered moments later.  She immediately sensed that John was troubled.  John admitted that he was frustrated because he suspected that Natalie had found something; however, she wasn't willing to share the information with him.\n\n\nJohn suspected that the people Jared was involved with were dangerous and that the situation was out of Jared's control.  Marty understood that John was concerned that Jared's associates might harm Natalie.  John confirmed that was worried for Natalie's safety, which was why he was determined to find Jared before Natalie did.\n\n\nMoments later, Marty received a phone call.  While she stepped away to take the call, John checked to see if his tech people had been able to zero in on Natalie's location.  He was irritated when he was told that Natalie's whereabouts remained a mystery.  As John tried to search his mind for clues, he had a fantasy of Natalie perched on the edge of his desk.  In the fantasy, Natalie offered to help John find Jared and then handed John a matchbook.\n\n\nWhen Marty returned to John's office, she found him lost in his thoughts.  John's fantasy evaporated when Marty called out John's name.  Marty decided that John needed to focus on his work, so she offered to leave.  Shortly after Marty's departure, John received word that Natalie had disabled the GPS device in her cell phone.  John suspected that Natalie had intentionally sabotaged the phone.\n\n\nBefore long, John had another fantasy of Natalie.  As Natalie flirted with John, she revealed that he had been so focused on Jared's wallet, that he had missed another important clue at the lodge.  According to Natalie, the clue might lead John to Jared.  Natalie offered to help John by handing him a matchbook.  As the fantasy disappeared, so did the matchbook in John's hand.\n\n\nThis episode featured the song, \"Come Home,\" by OneRepublic.\n\n\n",
