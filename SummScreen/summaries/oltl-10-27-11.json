    "tvmega_recap": "John's brother Michael and sister in law Marcie come to town and they both seem to know that he is not over Natalie and something is \"not right\" about the fact that she is marrying Brody after having his baby. Marcie goes to see Rex ready to offer support to him and Shane after the loss of Gigi. But when she sees that Aubrey is becoming friends with Rex and she remembers who Aubrey is, she lectures Rex on not wanting him to get mixed up with her. John recalls with Michael that Brody had some sort of \"issue\" involving being afraid he'd \"lose\" Liam. But they cannot figure out what that would be. Rick Powers, the porn producers \"works on\" Starr. Although Dani convinces her not to accept his terms involving breaking up with James and make Hope less important, she somehow believes she needs Rick in order to achieve her dream as a vocalist. Rick calls Robert Ford, James and Nate and tells the three of them he can help them make money with Robert being a producer, Nate \"starring\" with Starr instead of James and he will pay James more money than he's ever seen to \"make himself scarce\". Cutter has \"amnesia-stricken\" Stacy staying with him at The Minute Man, hoping she will regain her memory as Stacy and be able to make Rex believe she's Gigi since she looks exactly like her. He needs to find a way to get his hands on Clint's money and believes he knows of a plan but he needs to play it just right."
