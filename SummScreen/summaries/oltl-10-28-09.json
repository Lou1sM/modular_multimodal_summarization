    "soap_central": "\n\"For Whom The Bellman Tolls\"\n\n\nViki arrived at La Boulaie, where she was greeted by David in his ubiquitous towel.  David assumed that, given her recent family strife, she wanted to join him for a round of naked tai chi: \"If now isn't the time for sexual healing, I don't know when is!\"  Viki told him he was out of luck and she was there to see Dorian.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Dorian tore into her personal shopper for getting her the wrong pair of shoes for her walk down the aisle.  As the young woman rushed away, Viki entered, informing Dorian that she was pulling out of their final debate due to her family crises with Jared, Natalie, and Charlie.  Dorian mocked her for what she assumed was merely a sympathy ploy, and told her that she couldn't take the heat.  Dorian promised Viki that soon, she would be the first gay, partnered mayor of Llanview.\n\n\nNoticing David lurking on the periphery, Dorian ordered him to put on some clothes.  \"Clothes make me look fat!\" David complained.  After he walked out, Dorian attempted to goad Viki into staying in the debate by calling her a weak quitter.  Viki said she'd already sent out her announcement, and that her family came first.  As the personal shopper reentered with another pair of shoes, Viki wished Dorian good luck on her wedding day, even if she wasn't sure whether Dorian was the bride or the groom.\n\n\nMeeting David in the foyer, Viki asked him why he'd stuck around for Dorian's latest scheme.  David admitted that he'd hoped she wouldn't go through with the wedding to Amelia.  He cracked a series of jokes, but Viki saw through his facade to the heartache beneath, and urged him to tell Dorian how he really felt.  Hoping to change the subject, David asked her about her family troubles.  Viki explained that Jared was on the run and Jessica was being stalked, and Viki was glad her daughter had Brody at her side.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Dorian examined her new pair of bridal shoes and declared them satisfactory.  She told her personal shopper she couldn't wait to put them on and marry Amelia in front of friends, family, and all the state media outlets.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Viki pushed David to pour out his heart to Dorian, and gave him a hug.  Dorian walked in just in time to see her nemesis in her ex's arms.  As Viki took her leave, Dorian asked David what he was doing with his arms around another woman.  \"What do you care?\" David asked.\n\n\nDorian played off her jealousy and said it didn't matter what Viki did with anyone, as her forfeiting the debate would cost her the election.  David asked if that meant she would call off the wedding to Amelia.  Dorian said she couldn't abandon her gay and lesbian constituency, quoting Spider-Man's motto of \"with great power comes great responsibility.\"  David asked her what her marriage would mean for the people she truly loved.\n\n\nAt the carriage house, Gigi and Shane prepared the Halloween candy stash.  Shane asked her when Rex would return home, but Gigi said she didn't know, as his father was busy with a case.\n\n\nAs Shane performed an errand, Gigi answered the door to John, who was looking for Rex.  Gigi explained that Rex was out of town on a job, and she didn't know where.  Noticing Gigi's \"Hale-Bopp\" ticket stub, John asked if Rex had left after the concert.  Gigi awkwardly told him that she'd gone to the concert with someone else, and quietly revealed that she and Rex had been having problems.\n\n\nShane returned to the living room and greeted John.  As Gigi took the boy aside to help in the kitchen, John examined Rex's papers on the nearby desk, and took down Rex's credit card number.  When Gigi returned, John thanked her for her help and told her she and Rex were doing a good job with Shane.  Walking outside, he placed a phone call to a colleague and asked to run a trace on a credit card.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Schuyler walked out of his apartment and Roxy immediately confronted him.  Roxy said she was swamped at the Hair Haven in preparation for the mass wedding, and begged him to take the Balsom family's Halloween costumes over to Rex and Gigi's place.  Without skipping a beat, Schuyler  agreed.\n\n\nAt the Lakeside Inn, Natalie continued to puzzle over the book of matches found at the Buchanan lodge.  Rex returned to their hotel room with bad news: No one on the day shift staff had seen Jared.  Natalie couldn't understand how Jared could've gotten the matchbook from the Lakeside if he'd never been to the inn.  Despairing, she told Rex she feared she was losing her husband for good.  Rex suggested that perhaps Jared really was guilty and they should return to Llanview, but Natalie refused and said she had to find Jared before John did.\n\n\nRex called Gigi and told her he wouldn't be home for another few days.  He apologized for not being able to tell her the details, and said he loved her.  Still annoyed, Gigi took his platitudes without emotion.\n\n\nAfter hanging up, Rex told Natalie they had to review their situation; they were breaking the law by interfering in a police investigation, and though John was looking for them, they had no leads on Jared's whereabouts.  Just then, a bellhop wandered in with new information.  He told the siblings that he'd seen Jared check in, evading the police, and said he'd quickly checked out again, but not before borrowing the bellhop's computer.  Natalie asked if they could use it as well.\n\n\nThe bellhop lent Rex his laptop, and Rex scanned the recent browsing history.  He found a map of an area in California's Napa Valley, where Nash's original vineyard was located.  Natalie and Rex raced off in pursuit, thanking the bellhop for his help.\n\n\nSchuyler arrived at the carriage house with Rex, Gigi, and Shane's Halloween costumes.  Gigi thanked him for his help, but Shane said Schuyler couldn't leave; they needed a third person for their costumed trio in order to win the local costume contest, and Rex was out of town.  Schuyler and Gigi were uncomfortable with the idea, but Shane wouldn't take no for an answer.  Suiting up as \"Batman, Robin, and Catwoman,\" the three prepared to wow the contest judges.  At Shane's insistence, they took a picture together.\n\n\nBack at the hotel, Amelia, Nick, and Kyle prepared for the mass wedding ceremony.  Amelia wished that she had a true life partner at her side like the two men, but the nervous Kyle shrugged it off and said the wedding was for the cause of equal rights.  Nick insisted it was more than a symbolic ceremony, but the beginning of something bigger.  Kyle asked what else the wedding would mean, but Nick distracted him by pointing out a missing button on his dress shirt.  Kyle exited to seek help for his fashion emergency.\n\n\nAfter Kyle left, Amelia cornered Nick and said she knew he hadn't told his fianc\u00e9 \"everything,\" including his hopes and dreams for their future as a married couple.  Anxious, Nick assured her that their hopes and dreams could wait until after they'd said their vows.  Amelia told him that she was ready to put \"phase three\" of her master plan into effect.\n\n\nOut in the corridor, Kyle found Roxy on the phone arguing with her staff at the hair salon.  She asked him if he was really going through with his wedding plans, and Kyle said he was, and asked her to attend and support him.  Roxy refused to go to a wedding where she knew Kyle would be marrying the wrong man, and accused him of having a last fling with Oliver, the man he really wanted, the day before.  Kyle said that nothing had happened with him and Oliver, and they were over for good.\n\n\nFrom faraway Michigan, Brody called Jessica at Llanfair.  He asked how things were, and Jessica reluctantly told him about her call from \"Nash.\"  Freaking out, Brody wanted to go home, but Jessica insisted that everything was fine and John was on the case.  They said their goodbyes as John arrived at Jessica's door.\n\n\nGoing inside the Lovett family home, Brody told his sister, Nadine, that he had to leave, and her money problems could wait.  Nadine begged him to stay, and said she needed his help staving off foreclosure on her house.  Brody balked at the idea of staying a week for a court hearing, but Nadine grew emotional.  She apologized for not having been there for him during his breakdown, and said she knew she had no right to ask for his help.  Softening, Brody promised to help her as much as he could for the day, then leave to check on Jessica and return before the court date.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, John informed Jessica that Rex and Natalie had split town in search of Jared, and he'd lost track of all three.  Jessica couldn't fathom how Wayne Landers, Pamela Stuart, and her stalking were all connected, but John knew that the common denominator was either something, or someone.  He said it was unlikely that Jared had placed the call as \"Nash\" while on the run from the law, and asked Jessica if she knew of anyone else who could've been so close to her and Nash as to know the intimate details of their personal life.  Jessica couldn't think of anyone.\n\n\nJohn got a call back from his colleague, and told Jessica he'd tracked Rex's credit card to a gas station out of town.  For her own safety he didn't say where, but told her he was going after Natalie and Rex.  John told her to be careful, and reminded her that Nash had not made that phone call.\n\n\nJessica called Brody back and told him that John was on Rex and Natalie's trail.  Brody was worried by the thought of Jessica all alone, and said he'd return home that day.  Hearing his words, Nadine snapped a pencil in half.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Nick said his goodbyes to Kyle as they prepared for their nuptials.  Working to sew a button back onto his shirt, Kyle looked anxious and fearful.\n\n\nAmelia arrived at La Boulaie to interrupt Dorian and David's romantic standoff.  As David headed upstairs, Dorian took Amelia into the drawing room, scoffing at David's newfound romantic notions of marrying for love.  She didn't understand why David was making such a fuss, since, after all, her wedding to Amelia would only be symbolic.  \"What if it doesn't have to be?\" Amelia asked her.\n\n\nJohn arrived at the Lakeside Inn in search of Rex and Natalie, but found only the helpful bellhop.  However, he wasn't so helpful a second time; when John showed him pictures of his quarry, the bellhop lied that Natalie and Rex were heading back to Llanview, and said he'd never seen Jared in his life.\n\n\nViki returned to Llanfair, ready to comfort the frazzled Jessica.  Jess said she was okay, and urged her mother to tend to Charlie.  As Viki left the kitchen, Jessica got another phone call from \"Nash.\"  As she listened in horror,  \"Nash\" told her he needed her to go to the Napa vineyard, and to tell no one.\n\n\nBrody prepared to leave Michigan, and promised Nadine he'd return as soon as he knew Jessica was safe.  Nadine insisted he stay for a cup of coffee, and surreptitiously slipped something into the drink behind her brother's back.  After Brody downed the coffee, he grew disoriented and collapsed to the ground, unconscious.  Nadine made a call to a mysterious superior, saying she'd hated to use the \"emergency plan\" to keep Brody away from Jessica but had no choice.  \"She's all yours,\" she told the person on the other end of the line. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "John stops by Gigi's place looking for Rex, but he tells her Rex is on a case and she doesn't know where he is. John sees something on Rex's desk and surmises that Rex and Natalie are looking for Natalie on their own. He calls the station and asks for a trace on Rex's credit card activity. Rex and Natalie are at the hotel named on the matchbook that Natalie had found. They have asked most of the staff if they had seen Jared. One man says Jared was there and decided not to stay when he saw police cars. He tells them the man used his computer. Natalie and Rex look at the browser history and find that Jared was mapping a route to Napa, CA. When John arrives at the motel listed on Rexes credit card history and shows the man a picture of Rex and Natalie the man says he saw them and they said they were headed for a place called Llanview. When he shows a picture of Jared to the man, he says he has never seen him. Brody is at his sister's house in Michigan where she tells her that the emergency is that her house is being foreclosed on. He agrees to go with her to the hearing next week but sees no reason to stay in Michigan the whole time. He tells her he is going back to Pennsylvania today. She spikes his coffee. When he has passed out she calls someone and tells them that Brody will not be going anywhere near Jessica. Jessica receives another call from \"Nash,\" saying he needs her help and that she needs to come to the vineyard in Napa and tell no one. Roxy asks Schuyler to deliver Rex, Shane, and Gigi's Halloween costumes to them. Shane convinces Schuyler to go to the party in Rex's place wearing Rex's costume. Shane insists upon a photograph of the three of them in costume. Viki goes to La Boulaie to advise Dorian that she will not participate in tonight's debate. On her way out, she encourages David to tell Dorian how he feels. Dorian tells Amelia that David has suddenly decided that marriage should be between two people who love each other.
