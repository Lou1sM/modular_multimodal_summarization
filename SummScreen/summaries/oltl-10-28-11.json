    "tvmega_recap": "Rex and Shane host a Halloween party but somehow \"know\" that Gigi is not far away. Cutter convinces \"amnesiac\" Stacy/Gigi look-alike to go to the party with him hoping to jog her memory as Stacy but making sure that Rex cannot recognize her (looking exactly like Gigi). Natalie suspects nothing of Brody and the two of them and Liam attend Rex's party. Tina finds a bridal gown and Cord a bridal tux to wear to the party which gives both Viki and Clint some concern. Although Viki previously had plans to go, she finds she needs to stay home to help Clint with the children. It appears they are getting closer."
