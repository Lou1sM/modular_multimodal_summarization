Fish had good and bad news about his confiscated laptop. He told John that he had filed a complaint and the police department had returned the laptop. Unfortunately the hard drive had been removed. John was frustrated, because it meant that he couldn't confirm that Marty had been the woman in the picture taken outside of Ramsey's penthouse minutes after the ex-police commissioner had been murdered. In his ire, John revealed enough for Fish to realize that John had his suspicions about whom the woman in the photo was. Fish pushed for answers until John told him that the woman might be someone that John had been involved with. That was enough information for Fish to insist on helping John investigate the case. John was hesitant to involve the young police officer, but eventually Fish prevailed. John filled him in on where he stood with the investigation, including his attempt to convince Janet to cooperate. However, John kept Marty's name out of it. He continued to refer to her as \"the woman.\" The two men sat down and tried to figure out how Todd had fit into the scheme of things. \n\n\nIn the nursery of Todd's mansion, Janet listened to a voicemail message left by John. He urged to reconsider working with him to expose Todd's nefarious deeds. Janet quickly disconnected the call when she saw Marty walk into the room. Marty immediately picked up on Janet's anxiety and asked her if everything was okay. Janet tried to brush it off but Marty sensed that the phone call had disturbed Janet. She asked Janet who had been on the phone. Janet lied and told Marty that it had been a phone solicitor. Marty seemed to accept the lie easily but it made her realize how little she knew about Janet's life. Janet said little beyond that she had a daughter whom she had to leave behind. Marty felt bad for her companion, but Janet reassured her that she had accepted what had happened long ago. Janet did what she had to for her daughter's sake. \n\n\nThe conversation took a turn when Marty admitted that she had recently experienced flashes of memory about a child. When Marty suggested that perhaps they had been memories of a friend's child, Janet asked, \"What if it isn't?\" Marty clearly had conflicting feelings about the possibility, but in the end she chose to believe Todd's lie that she didn't have any children. As the two talked, it appeared that Janet tried to determine whether or not Marty was happy. Unknowingly, Marty convinced Janet that Todd was the right man for her and that Marty looked forward to a life with him. When Janet stepped out of the room, she erased John's voicemail message. \n\n\nDownstairs, Viki was questioning Todd. She wanted to know if he had seen Jessica. Naturally, Todd lied and claimed that he had not seen his niece. Unfortunately for Todd, Viki didn't believe him. She told Todd about her suspicions that Tess had returned. She also told him that they believe that she had been around since John had served Todd with a search warrant. She went on to tell him that they suspected Tess of helping Todd that day. Viki wasn't convinced by his act of shock and surprise. Viki proved to be tenacious and sharp. When she spotted a stuffed animal nearby, she picked it up and turned to Todd. She held up the toy and identified it as something that had belonged to Bree. Todd didn't deny it. However, he claimed that it had been left behind weeks earlier during John's search. Viki smugly informed Todd that she had bought the toy in Africa and had given it to Bree two days before. Todd was forced to admit that Jessica had spent the night, but insisted that she had left in the morning. Todd also said that he had no idea where she had gone. \n\n\nViki pleaded with Todd to cooperate. She told him that she was beside herself with worry since Natalie's disappearance and was desperate to find Jessica. Todd was sympathetic, but not enough to help Viki find her daughters. While he went to fetch Viki a glass of water, Viki walked into the living room to wait for him. As she sat on the sofa, she noticed something tucked between the cushions. Viki pulled it out and discovered that it was a baby monitor. When she turned it on, Viki heard Bree crying. Recognizing her granddaughter's cry, Viki stood up and went upstairs to search for Bree. Todd walked into the room a few minutes later. He picked the baby monitor up and heard Marty trying to sooth a fussy Bree. When he seemed to realize that Viki heard Bree crying, Todd went to find Viki. \n\n\nNora went to Cole's room to check on him. He was having difficulty with an essay for a college entrance exam. He told her that the topic had to be about someone who had influenced his life the most. When he confessed that he didn't know how to write about the baby, Nora was filled with regret. She apologized for not always being there for him when he had needed her. Cole was understanding and let Nora know that he didn't resent her in any way. The mood turned somber as they talked about Marty and the upcoming one-year anniversary of her death. When Nora reminisced about how her friendship with Marty had blossomed over the years, Cole saw similarities to his relationship with Starr. Nora was delighted to hear that Cole and Starr had worked through their problems and were friends again. Cole agreed. Eventually the conversation returned to the subject of Marty. Cole told Nora that he continued to harbor resentment that his mother had been cheated out her life just as she had found love with John. He confided to Nora that he had not seen Marty that happy since before his father had died. After Nora left, Cole returned to his laptop and began writing his essay, which he titled: A letter to my mom. \n\n\nLangston went to Starr's bedroom to tell her that she would be staying in Llanview. Ray had recovered from the shooting and had been transported back to prison in Colombia to serve out his sentence for a murder conviction. Starr was thrilled that her best friend would continue to live at La Boulaie. Langston experienced a moment of panic when she realized that Starr had been preparing to leave, but Starr quickly calmed her fears. Starr explained that she had been getting ready to go to the hospital to have the baby, not a home for unwed mothers. They spent some time visiting and talking about Cole and the baby before Langston returned to her room to unpack her suitcases. \n\n\nTess offered Jared and Natalie a delicious meal, but neither showed any interest in eating. Tess took a bite of the food to show them that it was not poisoned, but they weren't tempted. Natalie demanded that Tess release them. When that failed to yield results, she talked about Nash. She told Tess that Nash's death had not been murder and that the baby, Bree, and Nash did not belong to Tess. They belonged to Jessica. The accusation struck a nerve, and Tess's temper flared. The women volleyed insults and threats at each other until Tess had reached her limit. When she once again suggested that they eat their meal, Natalie and Jared questioned her about it. They wondered why she kept insisting that they eat. Tess seemed happy to enlighten them. She told them that it was their last meal and then sauntered over toward the case in which she had stored the bomb. Natalie and Jared appeared concerned and asked what was in the case. Tess pulled out the bomb and let them know that she intended to blow them up.\n\n\n",
