    "soap_central": "\n A Date with Destiny \n\n\nAt the Llanview Halloween event, a costumed Gigi, Schuyler, and Shane arrived at the same time as Blair, Todd, Jack, and Sam. When the mistress of ceremonies advised them that none of them would win the prize for the scariest costume, Blair muttered that she should have dressed as T\u00e9a.\n\n\nAs the party progressed, there were two teams left to win the grand prize for best costumes. The Mannings strolled down the stage, dressed as the Fantastic Four. Gigi, Schuyler, and Shane followed, appearing as Catwoman, Batman, and Robin. An awkward few moments ensued when Blair and Todd were announced as a married couple, as were Gigi and Schuyler. The top trophy went to Gigi, Schuyler, and Shane, who couldn't wait to tell Rex how great Schuyler had been. Todd admitted that he was having fun with Blair and his kids. Blair challenged him to a competition to bob for apples.\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, T\u00e9a quickly pulled Rachel into her room and slammed the door, worried that Ross would see them. T\u00e9a admitted that Ross was agitated due to his inability to locate his missing daughter. Rachel wondered if T\u00e9a was afraid of Ross, and T\u00e9a disclosed that Ross infrequently  had a mean temper and that she had been subjected to some abuse. Rachel picked up the phone, suggesting that the police be called right away. T\u00e9a quietly rejected the idea, citing her ultimate need to prevent Ross from kidnapping his daughter. She was afraid that would be the end result, but with charges still pending against him, he would be removed from the picture soon enough, she thought.\n\n\nT\u00e9a disclosed that she had found Todd in bed with Blair again and she had learned that Blair had lied about a scam, accusing T\u00e9a and Ross of plotting against Todd. She wasn't sure why she hadn't told Todd the truth, she admitted, balking at Rachel's suggestion that T\u00e9a try to win Todd back. T\u00e9a  said she wouldn't be able to win him back and she didn't think she wanted to. She wasn't sure if she wanted things to change since, regretfully, she didn't believe she and Todd were good for each other, even if she did love him. Rachel thought that T\u00e9a should continue to pursue Todd.\n\n\nIn a nearby room, Elijah advised an out of control Ross that T\u00e9a was \"holding most of the cards,\" but he had successfully located Dani via T\u00e9a's phone records. Ross learned that his daughter was in London, apparently at a boarding school, since there were calls to an administrative office there. He wanted to leave for London immediately and demanded that Elijah accompany him.\n\n\nRefusing, Elijah was surprised when Ross started to show his temper and push him around. He explained that he couldn't allow Ross to leave the country with charges still pending against him, so he would go alone. Angrily, Ross pulled a punch and knocked his brother out. Searching the pockets of an unconscious Elijah, Ross pulled a credit card from Elijah's wallet. He promised that Elijah could return the punch at a later time.\n\n\nIn London, Tom and Matthew were surprised when  Daniellei showed up at their dormitory door. Announcing that she wanted to see Matthew, Dani ordered Tom to leave the room. She was angry when she spotted a care package from her mother sitting on Tom's bed. Claiming that it had been in his mailbox by mistake, Tom left the room. Dani explained that her mother sent packages to assuage her own guilt in leaving her daughter at the school. Matthew and Dani shared tales of their parents.\n\n\nDani recalled the message that Destiny had left for Matthew on her phone and she handed it to him. He was pleased to hear Destiny's voice, though Dani suggested that Destiny sounded worried. He recalled that Destiny had no idea what had happened to him. He explained that Destiny had stood by him for a long time and had purchased him the sneakers that he'd probably never get to wear. He explained that nothing ever stopped Destiny from getting what she wanted. Dani urged him to \"call in the cavalry.\"\n\n\nAt Kevin's house, in a call back to Llanview, Bo learned that protesters were expected at the site of the gay marriage ceremony. He ordered additional security. Nora was worried about Matthew making friends at school but Bo assured her that their son was fine. Even though the headmistress had advised them not to visit Matthew until he was acclimated, Bo and Nora decided to visit him, anyway, and headed for the door.\n\n\nJust as Matthew prepared to call Destiny in Llanview, the headmistress entered the room.  She sternly advised Dani that she had been instructed to stay out of the boys' wing, especially since she had reported the boys for misbehavior previously. She ordered the teen back to her own quarters and happily advised Matthew that he had visitors. Bo and Nora stood in the doorway.\n\n\nThey cheerfully exclaimed how much they had missed him, but they were disappointed to hear that Matthew still hated his new school. Nora pointed out that Matthew had hated school in Llanview, also, but Matthew assured her it was different. When asked if he had made any friends, Matthew replied that it was none of their business. Hearing that his parents loved him and wanted him to be happy, Matthew snarled that if they didn't plan on taking him home for surgery, they could leave. He assured them that was the second best thing that could happen for him. They handed him a phone, advising him that he would be able to phone whoever he wanted to. Disappointed, they retreated.\n\n\nDani, eavesdropping in the hallway, reentered the room after Matthew's parents left. \"That was intense,\" she admitted. Matthew cited the fact that his parents had all the power. Dani noted that he would be able to call Destiny but he offered her the phone first, suggesting she call her father. Dialing the number in Tahiti from memory, Dani was taken aback when she heard that it had been disconnected. She shrugged it off and suggested that Matthew call his lawyer, since it didn't appear that his parents were acting legally. He managed to reach T\u00e9a and told her that he was in trouble.\n\n\nShaun eagerly signed his hospital release forms as his father and Greg wondered where Destiny had gone. Greg informed Shaun of a follow-up appointment but Shaun was more concerned about his long-delayed date with Rachel. He pointed out that she had been waiting as long as he had been. A visibly upset Greg turned away as Shaun left the room to dress. Mr. Evans wondered if his son was okay and if he had given up on Rachel.\n\n\nMuch to Greg's surprise, his father noted that he had learned of Greg's feelings for Rachel from his wife but he didn't agree with her assessment of the situation. He thought that Greg should be with Rachel if they desired one another. He felt that there was no way to avoid Shaun's heart from being broken and his mother would have to learn she couldn't protect him his entire life. He believed that she would also have to learn to stop living Greg's life. It was all entirely up to Rachel, he concluded.\n\n\nDestiny arrived at La Boulaie and announced that \"we have to save Matthew.\" David apologized, but explained that he needed to stay behind as head of Dorian's public relations. He thought he should be around for when everyone figured out that Dorian was pulling a scam. Destiny insisted that Matthew was being held a prisoner and it was up to David to help him. He was annoyed that Destiny managed to make him feel guilty as she informed him that she had a passport and had scraped all of her money together to buy them airplane tickets.\n\n\nSlipping, Destiny admitted to loving Matthew, and David wondered if Matthew knew. Destiny assured David that even if she confessed, Matthew would never hear her. David empathized, explaining that it was the story of his life. He reluctantly agreed to escort Destiny to London.\n\n\nIn the study, Amelia advised Dorian that their cause would attain a great victory if Dorian was to legalize all of the gay marriages once she was elected. Noting that Dorian looked concerned, she added that Dorian could issue marriage licenses, but still be free to love David.\n\n\nA curious Dorian wanted an explanation, since she couldn't afford to be \"outted.\" Amelia explained that Dorian would be able to make arrangements and plans to see David on the sly, since she didn't want Dorian to sacrifice her own life in order to meet Amelia's objectives. Dorian asked Amelia if she wanted to cancel the wedding, but Amelia replied by asking Dorian,\" Do you?\" Just then, David wandered into the room and Amelia left. Dorian asked David for advice, wondering how he would feel if all of the symbolically performed marriages were to be made legal.\n\n\nDavid pointed out that Dorian and Amelia would be \"wife and wife,\" but he couldn't see how people could be married without genuine love. He concluded that the decision was hers. Dorian resolved that she couldn't disappoint and had made a promise to the people. David announced that he was quitting and that politics had never been his thing. He was heading to London to help someone be with the person she loved, he revealed to an astonished Dorian. She would always have a spot on her staff for him, Dorian assured him, and he'd always be welcome at La Boulaie. \"Even after you're Mrs. Amelia Bennett?\" David asked. \"I still need you,\" Dorian replied. \"Not enough,\" David said as he walked away.\n\n\nArriving at the hospital, Destiny informed her father that she had been hiding in the morgue, a quiet place to do her homework. She reminded her dad that she had a school trip to Washington the next day. Perplexed, Mr. Evans was unable to recall the trip, though Destiny reminded him that he had signed the permission slip quite some time ago. She claimed that her mom knew about the trip. Mr. Evans handed her some spending money in case of an emergency. Shaun returned to his room, dressed up for his night on the town with Rachel.\n\n\nRachel arrived and was surprised to see that Shaun was decked out. He asked her out on a date for that evening. Greg looked on, unhappily.\n\n\nBo and Nora returned to their London residence, upset over Matthew's behavior. Bo vowed that he wouldn't apologize for keeping his son from making stupid decisions. He threw his filled goblet at the wall and Nora followed suit. Picking up additional pieces from the bar, they tossed them at the wall, glass flying everywhere. Nora noted how wonderful she felt and suddenly, she and Bo flew into each other's arms, kissing fervently.\n\n\nDestiny returned to La Boulaie to wait for David. Dorian slowly descended the stairs in her bridal attire. Realizing that she was wearing the outfit that she had worn to their own disastrous wedding, David assured her that she was breathtaking. Dorian asked him to remain for the wedding, as she wanted him to be the one to give her away. \"I think I already gave you away,\" David replied. \"I have a date with Destiny  and apparently so do you,\" he stated poignantly. A disbelieving and distressed Dorian watched him go.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew is getting to know T\u00e9a's (and Todd's) daughter, Dani while at the boarding school. She \"suggests\" that maybe he calls her excellent lawyer mom to help him with the fact that his parents have violated a court order. Yet she has no clue that he's already been her mom's client nor does he know that she is Tea's daughter. Dorian still wants to pull of the scam wedding to Amelia. But not many people want to help her. And Destiny persuades David to go with her to London to find Matthew instead of staying in Llanview to help Dorian. There's a Halloween party and costume contest where Shane, Gigi and Schuyler compete with Todd, Blair and Jack for the best costume.",
