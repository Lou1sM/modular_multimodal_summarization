    "tvmega_recap": "Bo tells the others that Spencer has offered to help save Kelly's baby. Dorian balks at that idea. Bo will go and talk to the man and see if this is just a way to escape, or use this to get an immunity deal. Dorian feels that Kelly should be told about this and she goes into the hospital room to do just that. Natalie meets up with Cristian and she is furious. \"It's Vincent!\" Vincent arrives at the hospital and Evangeline tells how Hugh is trying to tell her something. He was saying, \"It's me,\" but she doesn't understand why he would be telling her that. Vincent and she go to the man and they can't hear him saying anything that they can understand. Evangeline starts leaving so she won't have to be in the same room with Vincent longer than she has to. He tells her that she doesn't have to leave on his account. He didn't mean to hurt Layla and that is the same thing that he told Natalie. Evangeline is disbelieving when Vincent says that he will make things right for Cristian and she storms off. When alone with Hugh, Vincent sits and tells the man that he really screwed up and now all the beautiful ladies are running off from him. \"Layla dumped me, Evangeline hates me and now Natalie she is probably running all over town telling that I set Cristian up. She kissed me you know.\" Vincent sees when Hugh's hand moves to the side of the bed and clenches. Vincent goes on to say that he didn't take advantage or anything, but there was definitely chemistry between them. \"Hey I didn't kiss her she kissed me.\" He leaves and tells his friend not to worry as he doesn't plan on moving up on Natalie. Natalie tells Cristian that Vincent confessed that he was the one who set the man up. Cristian wants her to come with him to the station but Natalie will not go. She says that she will do this the next day maybe. Cristian is suspicious of her protecting the guy over him. \"Is something going on with you two?\" She can't believe he is asking her that. \"John just died!\" Exactly, and that is why Cristian knows that Vincent would be right there to take advantage of someone in that position. She says that Vincent is trying to change and she wants to give him a chance like people did for her when she first came to town. \"I hope that there isn't anything between the both of you because tomorrow you and I are going to the station to make a report about Vincent setting me up!\" Kevin tells Spencer to take his offer to help Kelly and go to hell. He and Kelly decide on the C-section. The doctor gets the baby. \"It is a boy!\" the doctor says. Kevin and Kelly are thrilled, but it is too quiet. \"Is something wrong with my baby?\"",
