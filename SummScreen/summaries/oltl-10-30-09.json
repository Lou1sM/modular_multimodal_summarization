Bo and Nora relieved their frustration by shattering their wine glasses against the wall. Afterward, they shared an impulsive kiss.  As Bo and Nora kissed passionately, Kevin entered the room and demanded to know what was going on.  Bo and Nora stood speechless.\n\n\nBo and Nora were relieved when they realized that Kevin hadn't noticed their embrace, instead Kevin had observed the broken crystal that covered the living room floor.  Detailing their hostile visit with Matthew, Bo and Nora explained that they were upset and had decided to blow off a little steam.\n\n\nWhen Kevin left the room, Bo and Nora expressed their guilt.  Bo suggested that he and Nora discuss their feelings for one another, but Nora insisted that there was nothing to talk about.  Claiming their emotions were high at the time, Nora was adamant that they had merely experienced a crazy, impulsive moment.  Bo demanded that they deal with the strong emotions that they shared for each other once and for all.  Nora insisted that she loved Clint, but Bo questioned why they continued to share such intimate moments together, if she truly loved his brother.  Nora refused to acknowledge that a problem existed between them.  She was stunned when Bo declared his love for her.\n\n\nRoxy was surprised to find Gigi and Shane with Schuyler at the Llanview Halloween event.  Explaining that Rex had left town on business, Gigi related that Shane had invited Schuyler to accompany them to the party, in Rex's place.  Displaying their costumes, Gigi and Shane informed Roxy that they had won the grand prize for best costume.\n\n\nWhen Roxy announced that she had plans to attend the mass gay marriage ceremony, Shane begged his mother to allow him to tag along, insisting that he didn't want to miss such a historic event.  Although Gigi expressed concern about the protesters who were in attendance, she allowed Shane to accompany Roxy to the event.\n\n\nNearby, Todd and Blair bobbed for apples.  Noticing that Todd was distracted, Blair questioned if he was thinking about T\u00e9a.  Blair quickly reminded Todd of T\u00e9a's betrayal, and suggested that he forget about her.  When Jack and Sam approached their parents, Todd remarked, \"At least I have my kids!\"  Remembering T\u00e9a's revelation that she and Todd shared a child, Blair chimed in, \"And T\u00e9a's got Ross!\"  Blair suggested that Todd and the boys accompany her to Dorian's wedding ceremony.  When Todd and the boys declined, Blair asked Todd if they would see each other later.  Todd stated that it was a safe bet.  Blair smiled as she headed off to Dorian's wedding ceremony.\n\n\nInside Matthew's dorm room in London, as Danielle sat nearby, Matthew phoned T\u00e9a and explained that his parent's had kidnapped him and transported him to England.  Stunned, T\u00e9a demanded to know exactly where in England Matthew was residing.  As Matthew attempted to reveal his location to T\u00e9a, Elijah pounded on T\u00e9a's hotel room door.  Covering the phone, T\u00e9a yelled and told Elijah to go away.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Danielle wondered what was going on.  A confused Matthew told his friend that his lawyer was arguing with someone.  Matthew assured Danielle that his lawyer was the best and could help him.  Thinking about her own situation, Danielle wondered if Matthew's lawyer could help her win a case against her mother, for false imprisonment.\n\n\nBack inside her Palace Hotel room, T\u00e9a hung up on Matthew and rushed to open the door when Elijah claimed to know where T\u00e9a was hiding Danielle.  Initially, T\u00e9a denied having any knowledge of the International Warwick Academy, but panicked when she learned that Ross had stolen Elijah's credit card and was headed to London to find Danielle.\n\n\nAfter placing a call, Elijah confirmed that Ross had used his credit card to purchase a plane ticket to London.    Relating that Ross had knocked him out cold, Elijah acknowledged that his brother had always had a temper, and admitted that their relationship had been strained due to Ross's rage.  Enraged, T\u00e9a informed Elijah that Ross's temper was the reason that she had hid Danielle from him.  T\u00e9a revealed that Ross had threatened to run off with Danielle.  Elijah didn't believe Ross was capable of such a thing, but T\u00e9a stated that Ross was capable of anything.  Realizing that Ross was dangerous, Elijah offered to help T\u00e9a locate his brother.  Ignoring  Elijah's admission of guilt, T\u00e9a made reservations for a flight to London.  Elijah insisted on going with her.\n\n\nAt the London boarding school, Matthew was upset after T\u00e9a abruptly ended their call.  While Matthew expressed the anger he harbored for his parents, Danielle criticized her own mother's actions.  Although she berated her mother, Danielle told Matthew that her dad was the best.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ross sat on a plane headed for London.  Posing as Elijah, Ross told the flight attendant that he would soon be reunited with his daughter.\n\n\nDestiny and David sat a few rows away from Ross on the plane.  While an anxious Destiny anticipated her reunion with Matthew, David pined over Dorian.   Destiny expressed her regret that David wouldn't be in attendance at Dorian's wedding.  Hurt, David exclaimed, \"Dorian has made her choice, and apparently it isn't me!\"  At Destiny's urging, David re-lived past moments from his wild relationship with Dorian.  \n\n\nWhen Destiny asked if David had ever told Dorian that he loved her, David replied, \"I never got the chance!\"  Continuing to reminisce about his past life with Dorian, David stated that he and Dorian were soul mates.  With a grin, Destiny related that she and Matthew were also soul mates.  Destiny vowed to tell Matthew that she loved him when she saw him.\n\n\nBack in London, Matthew attempted to phone Destiny, but received her voicemail.  Danielle pointed out that Destiny appeared to be a good friend to Matthew.  With a loving smile, Matthew stated that Destiny was the best and that he missed her.  Unable to reach Destiny or T\u00e9a, panic set in and Matthew worried that he wouldn't be able to contact anyone who could help him.  Danielle suggested that Matthew calm down, but he informed her that if he didn't have his surgery performed immediately, the possibility existed that he would never walk again.  Realizing that time was of the essence, Danielle revealed that she had an idea.\n\n\nWhile Dorian introduced her fianc\u00e9e, Amelia, to Andrew, a large number of angry protesters gathered nearby on the lawn of La Boulaie.  A pleased Amelia thanked Andrew for agreeing to officiate.  Once Amelia left them alone, Dorian asked Andrew if Cassie had mentioned her thoughts on Dorian's fianc\u00e9e.  Giving Dorian a knowing look, Andrew stated that although Cassie believed in the cause, Cassie didn't believe that Dorian loved Amelia or that Dorian was a lesbian.    Before Dorian could respond, she noticed Starr and Langston.  Dorian thanked the girls for attending the ceremony.  The teens told Dorian that they didn't agree with her methods but supported the cause.\n\n\nA few feet away, Oliver observed Nick and an extremely nervous Kyle prepare to say their vows.   Straightening Kyle's tie, Nick kidded his fianc\u00e9  and questioned whether Oliver might show up and disrupt their wedding ceremony.  Annoyed, Kyle insisted that Oliver wouldn't interfere in their plans.\n\n\nWhen Nick stepped away, Oliver approached and offered Kyle his congratulations.   Kyle was surprised to see Oliver in attendance.  Explaining that he had been reinstated on the job, Oliver pointed to the barricades that separated the large crowd of angry protesters from the invited guests, and stated that he had received orders to provide security.  Acknowledging that the marriage wouldn't be legal, Oliver questioned if Kyle and Nick planned to live together after the ceremony.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nick and Amelia discussed the big announcement.  Moments later, Amelia approached Dorian.  Handing Dorian a microphone, Amelia informed Dorian that the time had come to reveal their plans to the crowd.   As the angry protesters shouted insults at the gay participants, Dorian shocked the entire crowd when she announced that her first official act as mayor would be to issue every gay couple in attendance with a wedding license.\n\n\nDorian's words sent Kyle into a state of shock.   Kyle panicked at the thought that his marriage to Nick would be legal.  Nick emerged and expressed delight over Dorian's announcement.  When Kyle asked if Dorian could actually make the marriages legal, Nick informed his fianc\u00e9 that she would have the power to do so immediately after she won the election.  While Kyle questioned what had taken place, Oliver rushed off to control some of the rowdy protesters.  Aware of Kyle's nervous state, Nick reminded Kyle of his promise that they would take their relationship one step at a time, if Kyle desired to do so.\n\n\nWhile Oliver attempted to control the hostile protesters,, Cristian arrived to support his friend.  Cristian explained that he wanted to stand by his friend's side as Oliver watched Kyle marry Nick.  Oliver was more concerned with learning why Cristian had decided to move out of the apartment.  Before Cristian could explain, Layla approached and stated that she wanted to offer her support to Oliver.   Suggesting that the ex-roommates discuss their own personal issues, Oliver excused himself and headed off to maintain peace.  Meanwhile, Layla and Cristian appeared uncomfortable together.\n\n\nNearby, Starr and Langston were thrilled when Cole and Markko arrived at the event.  The boys stated that they wanted to the support the cause, as well as their girlfriends.   Markko noticed that Cole's tie was crooked.  When Markko straightened Cole's tie, a friend of Markko's parents spotted the boys standing close to one another.  Misinterpreting the situation, the nosy friend accused Markko of being gay and spoke negatively about gay marriages.  Unnerved by Mrs. Burns's  comment, Markko pulled Cole close and the two boys claimed to be in love.  As the horrified women chastised the boys, Starr and Langston joined in and proclaimed their love for each other, as well.\n\n\nDorian stood alone and had flashbacks of the happy times she had shared with David.  Observing Dorian's quiet demeanor, Amelia questioned if Dorian was thinking about David.  When Amelia asked why David hadn't arrived, Dorian replied, \"David has a date with Destiny, and so do I!\"  Unconvinced, Amelia suggested that Dorian come clean about her feelings for David.  After a brief hesitation, Dorian asked, \"David who?\"  Alone again, Dorian continued to think about David.\n\n\nWhen Roxy and Shane arrived at the ceremony, Roxy immediately spotted Kyle, who was sitting alone in a depressed state.  Roxy handed him a lucky rabbit's foot.  She related that she had given it to Adriana on the day she married Rex.  Stating that the marriage was a disaster, Roxy smiled and declared that Rex had ended up with the woman he truly loved.\n\n\nAs Gigi and Schuyler entered Rodi's, Schuyler opened his mail.  Upon noticing a letter from Llanview Medical School, he grew nervous and begged Gigi to open the letter for him.  When Gigi informed Schuyler that he had been admitted to medical school, he pulled her close and gave her a passionate kiss.  Immediately Schuyler pulled away and apologized, but he was surprised when Gigi didn't appear upset.   Acknowledging that she didn't reject the kiss, Gigi admitted that she had developed feelings for Schuyler.  While Gigi expressed guilt over having feelings for him, Schuyler wondered how they would deal with the situation, but Gigi had no idea.\n\n\nBack at the wedding ceremony, Oliver was stunned when Mrs. Burns suggested that she knew he would rather be on the other side of the barricades with the protesters, rather than hanging around the \"perverts.\"  Oliver became unnerved when a fellow officer approached the protesters and agreed with their stance on gay marriages.  As everyone listened, Oliver screamed, \"What's wrong with you people?  What are you afraid of?  Are you afraid of me? I'm one of those perverts, I'm gay!  I can't wait for the day that I can marry the person I love!\"  Kyle stared at his ex-lover in amazement.  When Oliver announced that he was proud to be gay, the gay couples and wedding guests applauded him.\n\n\nKyle stared at Oliver with a newfound respect.  Meanwhile, Nick listened as Andrew referred to Oliver as a courageous man.  Nick appeared bothered by Oliver's declaration.  Elated, Starr and Langston approached Dorian and commented on Oliver's brave actions.  In a grim tone, Dorian remarked, \"He was inspirational.  It takes a lot of courage to come out and say what you really feel!\"\n\n\nLater, Dorian perked up when Blair arrived.   Surrounded by Blair, Langston, and Starr, Dorian announced, \"Now, I can accomplish anything, including changing the status quo!\"  Afterward, Langston confronted Dorian and asked what was bothering her.  Dorian admitted, \"I still love David! I still love the man I made leave town!\"  Amelia interrupted and told Dorian that it was time to start the ceremony.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Destiny questioned what David intended to do about his feelings for Dorian.  With a look of regret, David moaned, \"It's too late!  She's probably already Mrs. Amelia Bennett by now!\"\n\n\nBack at the wedding ceremony, Kyle and Oliver sat close and discussed Oliver's spontaneous announcement.   Although pleased, Kyle couldn't believe that Oliver had made such a public admission.  A confident Oliver replied, \"I did it and I meant it!\"    As Oliver expressed his feelings to Kyle, Nick interrupted the discussion.  In a nervous tone, Nick muttered, \"Come on Kyle!  It's time to get married!\"\n\n\nAs Elijah listened, T\u00e9a phoned the boarding school and requested that someone watch Danielle closely throughout the night.  T\u00e9a related that she would arrive at the school the next morning.   Elijah promised T\u00e9a that Danielle would be okay.   T\u00e9a tried to convince herself that Danielle would be safe that night.\n\n\nOn the plane, Ross stared at a photo of Danielle and said, \"Hold on baby!  Daddy's coming!\"\n\n\nAt the boarding school, Matthew was surprised when Danielle announced, \"We're breaking out of this hell hole!\"\n\n \n\n\n",
