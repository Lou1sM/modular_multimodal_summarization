Cole denied that he was experiencing difficulties, but Starr revealed that she had read his email. Confessing that he wished that he had never sent her the email, Cole apologized for involving Starr in his troubles. Touching his hand, Starr told him that they were friends and she wouldn't allow him to be alone. \n\n\nCole and Starr discussed his choice of colleges. Stating that he was skeptical about attending the same college as his mother had, Cole was adamant about standing on his own. Cole said that he no longer wanted to waste time feeling sorry for himself. He wanted to appreciate the time that he had spent with Marty. Cole's spirits appeared to be lifted. He told Starr that he believed that he was ready to say goodbye to his mother. After thanking Starr for coming to his aid, Cole stood at his mother's crypt and said goodbye to her. With her hand on her stomach, Starr announced to Cole that she was in labor. \n\n\nIn an upstairs bedroom at Todd's residence, Marty envisioned the little boy that she had imagined previously. Feeling a connection to the child, Marty picked him up and sang to him. Fascinated by the child, Marty continued to question why she felt such a strong bond with the little boy. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Todd tried to convince Viki to leave. Stating that she intended to wait for Tess to return to pick up Bree, Viki refused to leave. When Viki questioned why Todd wanted her to leave, Todd told Viki that Bree's presence reminded him of his own children and informed Viki of the restraining order that Blair had placed against him, barring him from his children. Realizing that Viki wasn't buying his sob story, Todd tried to make her feel guilty, and criticized Viki for leaving her children during such a critical time. As Todd continued to ramble, Viki asked if he had met someone special. Without revealing much, Todd admitted to having someone special in his life, who understood him. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina placed a call to someone. She informed the person that she would meet him and bring the payment. Examining the gem, Tina announced that she was willing to give up her precious jewels in order to save the lives of David Vickers, Natalie, and Jared. As Tina exclaimed that she planned to do the right thing and be a hero, Charlie entered the kitchen and interrupted her thoughts. \n\n\nConvinced that Charlie was an accomplice of Cain's, Tina announced that she hadn't missed the deadline and threatened to clobber him with a rolling pin. Upon learning Charlie's identity, Tina greeted him. Charlie asked Tina if she had seen either Viki or Jessica, but Tina stated that she hadn't. Once Charlie revealed that Viki had mentioned Tina to Charlie, Tina asked Charlie for some details regarding his relationship with her sister. Realizing that Charlie still had feelings for Viki, Tina advised him to win her back. When Charlie vowed to mend his relationship with Viki and mentioned his need to find Jared, Tina quickly excused herself and took off to meet up with her contact. \n\n\nWhile Viki attempted to obtain more information from Todd, Charlie phoned her and interrupted their conversation. Viki insisted on staying at Todd's home and waiting for Tess to return, but Charlie suggested that she bring Bree back to Llanfair. Todd was relieved when Viki hung up and announced that she was leaving. Todd rushed Viki and Bree out of the house. Before leaving, Viki warned Todd to be careful if Tess returned, and reminded him that Tess was carrying Jessica's baby. \n\n\nAfter sending Viki home, Todd went upstairs to check on Marty. Meanwhile, Marty smiled lovingly at the child in the crib and continued to sing to him. Todd entered the room and questioned what Marty was doing. A startled Marty looked in the crib, but the child was no longer there. Claiming that she was checking on Bree, Marty asked Todd where the child was. When Todd announced that Viki had taken Bree home, Marty was angry. She told Todd that Jessica had left Bree in their care and insisted that she would be upset if someone had taken her child without telling her. \n\n\nConvinced that Marty was keeping secrets, Todd mentioned that he heard her singing. Marty admitted that she wasn't singing to Bree, and stated that she was singing to the son that she never had. Divulging her vision of the little boy, Marty told Todd that she believed that her mind was trying to reveal something to her. Marty said that she believed that the little boy meant something profound to her and she needed to discover exactly what. Todd reminded Marty that they had decided not to look into the past, but Marty insisted that she needed to understand what the little boy's significance was. Declaring that she couldn't leave the child behind, Marty asked Todd if he understood how something could haunt someone, and the need to do everything in one's power to put it to rest. Todd agreed that he had. Todd feared that Marty's search could change everything. Marty demanded to know if Todd was withholding important information from her past. \n\n\nEscorting Marty downstairs, Todd told her that he had something to show her. Todd handed Marty a photograph of Starr and Cole. \n\n\nIn the basement of Llanfair, Natalie and Jared watched as Tess was overcome with stomach pains. Natalie and Jared pleaded with Tess to allow them to help her, but Tess claimed to be fine and refused their help. Reminding them that she had set the timer and the explosives would soon ignite, Tess mocked Natalie and Jared's precious last moments on earth. \n\n\nFearing for the unborn child, Natalie begged Tess to phone the doctor. Clutching her stomach in pain, Tess remarked that she intended to carry through with her plot to take care of Natalie and Jared. To Tess's surprise, Natalie insisted that she was very similar to Todd. Natalie told Tess that she was selfish and would put her child's life in danger in an attempt to get revenge - just as Todd would. \n\n\nAs Tess's pains appeared to grow worse, a concerned Jared called out to her. Consumed with guilt and pain, Tess apologized to her unborn child and stated that she couldn't lose her baby. Struggling to reach the combination lock to the glass room, Tess warned Natalie not double-cross her. A worried Natalie shook her head in compliance, and Tess began to fumble with the combination lock. As Tess struggled to open the lock, Natalie and Jared promised to take her directly to a hospital once they were released. Relieved that she was moments away from being freed from her prison, Natalie told Tess that Nash would be proud of her. Immediately, Tess removed her hand from the lock and glared at Natalie. Standing to her feet, Tess declared that Nash would want her to seek revenge against the persons responsible for his death. \n\n\nViki returned to Llanfair and put Bree to bed. Viki and Charlie discussed their missing children. Expressing her frustration, Viki told Charlie about Todd's claim that he hadn't seen Tess. Viki said that she didn't believe her brother, and felt that he was trying to get rid of her. Although she believed that Todd was covering for Tess, she was certain that Todd would never allow Tess to harm her. Viki was surprised when Charlie mentioned that he had met Tina. Charlie told Viki that Tina appeared to be worried about something. Viki feared that Tina had gotten herself into trouble. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, Tina approached a man, who was sitting on a park bench. Referring to the man as \"Smitty,\" Tina asked him for the product. Presenting her with a case of sparkling gems, Smitty warned her that the fake jewels would never stand up to close scrutiny. Handing him a check, Tina announced that she only needed to fool someone long enough to ensure that her niece was placed where she belonged - in a padded cell. \n\n\nAs Viki worried about her girls, Charlie studied her and wondered if she still had feelings for him. Diverting his questioning, Viki changed the subject and expressed her concern over the return of Tess. Admitting that she was in no condition to confront Tess alone, Viki asked Charlie to stay with her. Charlie said that he had no intention of leaving Viki alone with Tess. Warning Charlie that the situation could turn ugly, Viki advised Charlie that Tess might need to be restrained. Charlie promised Viki that he would never let anything happen to Viki or her girls. They both headed upstairs. \n\n\nBack downstairs, Natalie and Jared pleaded with Tess to release them, but she refused. Insisting that she could take care of herself, Tess slid back the secret wall, hiding the presence of Natalie and Jared, and left the basement. Terrified that the bomb could go off at any time, Natalie expressed her fears to Jared. Convinced that they had time, Jared reminded Nat that Tina knew of their whereabouts and would rescue them. Jared begged Natalie not to give up, but Natalie was adamant that they needed to say their goodbyes to one another. \n\n\nTess struggled upstairs. She told the baby that she needed to get Bree and they all needed to escape before the house blew up. As Tess headed towards the door, Charlie appeared. \n\n\nAt the park, Tina encountered Cain, who was in possession of David Vickers.\n\n\n",
