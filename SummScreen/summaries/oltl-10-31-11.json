    "tvmega_recap": "At Rex and Shane's party, many things are going on with many different people. Tina wants Cord to be Brody's best man and herself as Natalie's maid of honor although they have not agreed. Cord is suspicious that this is a \"scheme\" on her part to get back with him, but he admits that he may want to get back with her. Gigi/Stacy and Cutter attend although \"uninvited\" and wearing disguises. Nobody recognizes her, but Aubrey reveals Cutter. Rex and Shane are getting along with Aubrey but Natalie is suspicious of her. Roxy wants Rex to be Brody's best man and argues with Tina. Clint and Viki stay home. He sees that the mysterious envelope addressed to him has disappeared from her living room table. Somehow it's made its way to Rex's home in the hay barn where Cutter discovers it. Todd is getting closer to Blair and to Sam until Irene \"haunts\" him reminding him that once they find out he murdered Victor, they will hate him. Jessica, Robert Ford, and Bree attend the party but have to leave early. Jessica and Robert are growing closer as are Viki and Clint."
