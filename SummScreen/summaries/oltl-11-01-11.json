She tells him she is committed to showing him she's a better person and is there for him and Viki and not just in it for the money or schemes anymore. Cutter is plotting his plan to prevent Kim from contacting Clint. Clint however, knows something is \"not right\" and Kim has not disappeared on him after attempting to use him for his money then finding out he's not rich, as Nigel suggests. And he knows there is something \"signficant\" about Kim's friend in the private Kentucky hospital. Meanwhile, Cutter works on Gigi/Stacy who demands he tells her the truth. he tells her that she is Stacy, a con artist just as capable of wrong doing as he is. She is in love with Rex. He wants her to be with the man she loves and she needs to trust him. Viki can see that Todd intends to get Blair back although he has the deep dark secret where Irene's ghost has convinced him that he killed Victor. Starr tells Blair something similar about her mom getting back with her dad. But she's not certain whether to move forward with Tomas or get back with Todd. Rex somehow knows there is something significant about the unidentified woman with the mask who crashed his Halloween party with Cutter. And he goes to find her after Cutter has left. Little does he know who she is (or who she looks exactly like)."
