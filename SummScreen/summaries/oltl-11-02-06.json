    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Principal Wexler's office, Todd and Blair bantered about her high school past. Blair said she had gotten suspended in school and been a bad girl. The two thought they should be blamed for all the problems Starr was having in school. Brittany's parents showed up and called the Mannings \"white trash.\" Ouch. Todd said they could \"kiss my ass\" at the exact moment that Brittany and Starr entered the office. Brittany said she only meant it as a joke. Todd wanted Brittany expelled. Principal Wexler couldn't do that but did give her two months' detention. Brittany apologized but when they left the room Brittany said to Starr: \"You are so dead.\" Back in Marcie's classroom, Brittany read her essay on rapists and concluded that they should be castrated. Todd overheard that and Blair had to restrain him. \n\n\nIn the gym, Gabe reminded Cole that the fate of the football team was dependent on him. The coach said he could get some stuff (could that be steroids?). Starr wondered what he said to Cole. Cole changed the subject and asked if Starr would be at his football game. \n\n\nLayla was wondering why Natalie was visiting Vincent in jail. (This was after Vincent made reference to that dockside kiss.) Vincent tried to explain that confessing was the right thing to do. Vincent was brought in for his arraignment and Cris, Natalie and Layla were in the courtroom. Evangeline refused to offer a plea bargain. Vincent's attorney said Vincent had nothing to do with the lacing of the other fighter's gloves. Ted showed up and took the blame for the tainted gloves. Vincent's attorney put the plea bargain back on the table. Evangeline conferred with Cris and they decided to take the deal, on the agreement that Vincent would make a full confession to the boxing commission. Vincent thanked Layla for coming. She reminded him that this didn't change things between them. \n\n\nAsa grabbed Spencer's DNA results (still in a closed envelope) and said again Spencer wasn't his son. David and Viki placed bets. Clint demanded that Spencer get his results. Asa dropped them. Spencer picked up the envelope, opened it and learned that he was NOT a Buchanan. Asa was elated and Spencer was dumbstruck. \"He was not worthy of being a Buchanan,\" Asa crowed. Spencer accused the Buchanans of cheating. Spencer lost it and grabbed Viki in a headlock, to the horror of the Buchanan men. Bo pulled a gun. Viki assured the men that Spencer wouldn't hurt her. Spencer continued to claim the Buchanans had doctored the result. \"You can't get kicked out of a family you never belonged to.\" Asa made things worse by accusing Spencer and David's mother of being a whore. \"My mother was a hooker,\" David quipped. David got Spencer to release Viki and Bo arrested him. Bo took Spencer away. David asked Asa why his mother would have lied to Asa. Asa proceeded to bash David's mother and David left. Viki and Clint told Asa they thought he had been a bit harsh with David. \"That was his mother you were talking about,\" Viki said. Clint asked Asa if he had been in love with Spencer's mother. Asa explained that he had never seen Emma again and took a swig of bourbon. Bo asked Spencer how it felt to be Spencer Truman. \"What a waste,\" Bo said. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "The tests show that Spencer isn't Asa's son. Spencer will not believe the test. Todd and Blair are at the school to talk to the principal about what happened Halloween night. They get into a big argument with Britney's parents and Principal Wexler sees they are not good role models for their children. The girls say they will try to get along better, and Britney is given 2 months detention. \"You are so dead!\" the girl spits when they are out of earshot of the adults. In the class, Britney reads her essay. \"It must be hard to know someone who is a rapist.\" Todd and Blair have come to the door and hear Britney talking about Starr's father and pretending it is an assignment. Todd wants to go in there but Blair holds him back. \"We have to let her fight her own battles.\" The coach pressures Cole as he works out on the weight machines. \"We have to win this game.\" His friend comes over and offers to get him some 'stuff' to get high performance out of him. \"What stuff was that guy offering to get for you?\" Cole looks up and Starr is there. She withdraws her question knowing that wasn't any of her business. He sees she is sad and she tells how she just had a rough time in English class. Spencer freaks out and can't believe that his mother lied to him about Asa. Spencer grabs Viki who is standing nearby and threatens to choke the life out of her, or snap her neck. David ends up being the one who saves the day when he points out that Viki is one of the good guys and she isn't a Buchanan. Bo gets the crazy bastard under control and he is returned to his cell. \"So how does it feel being a not-a- Buchanan-Truman after plotting and scheming and pretending all these years?\" Bo slams the cell door shut. David found out in the hula-ba-loo that his mother was a hooker and is fascinated by that fact. Asa confirms that and said that the woman was crazy. David can't understand though why she would lie about getting pregnant by Asa. Asa says that the woman might have been going through withdrawals at the time of her death. \"You know the DT's. She was crazy on her death bed.\" Asa said he had a brief affair with the woman and never saw her again. Evangeline plays the case hard, with no chance for a deal. She warns that if Vincent doesn't just go to jail now, he will only get a longer sentence after a trial. Ted shows up and takes the wrap for Vincent. Evangeline knows that he is only doing that as he would rather have Vincent as a friend than an enemy. Vincent ends up with a suspended sentence, and community service and he also has to give the commission a statement to clear Cris's name.",
