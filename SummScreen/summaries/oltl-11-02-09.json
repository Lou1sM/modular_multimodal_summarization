As Dorian admitted to Langston that she was still in love with David, Amelia approached and told Dorian that the ceremony was about to begin.  With a look of regret, Dorian handed her phone to Langston and suggested that the teen hold onto the phone just in case.  Realizing that Dorian was hoping to receive a call from David, Langton placed a call to him.   Unable to reach David, Langston left David a voicemail, informing him that Dorian was still in love with him.  Langston urged David to stop the wedding before he lost Dorian to a woman.\n\n\nDestiny and David arrived at the Buchanan Compound in London.  While Destiny hid in the bushes, David knocked on the door and was stunned to discover a butler, who resembled Nigel.  Upon learning that the butler was actually Nigel's cousin, Neville, David attempted to gain entry into the compound.  Instead, Neville insisted that he had never heard of David, and refused him entry.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside, Nora was speechless when Bo confessed that he was still in love with her.  Bo believed that Nora was in love with him, as well.  Admitting that she still loved Bo, Nora reminded him of the pain he had caused her when he refused to forgive her for her indiscretion with Sam.   Conflicted, Nora told Bo that she also loved Clint and questioned why Bo had decided to proclaim his love for her after she had married his brother.  Bo continued to point out that he and Nora seemed to be drawn to one another.  With tears in her eyes, Nora stated that she had never stopped loving Bo.  Nora and Bo shared a passionate kiss.\n\n\nMeanwhile, outside, Destiny distracted Neville, and David raced into the house to search for Matthew.  David entered the living room and was startled to find Bo and Nora in an embrace.  Afterward, Destiny and Neville stormed into the room.  Pleading with Bo and Nora to allow her to see Matthew, Destiny stated that she wanted to be certain that he was all right.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Todd paid Viki a visit.  Todd wondered if Viki was prepared for election night, but Viki could only think of the turmoil her family was experiencing.  After Todd placed a few calls to assist her campaign, Viki questioned him about his relationship with T\u00e9a.   Todd informed Viki that T\u00e9a had planned to steal from him, but Viki was unconvinced and urged him to find out the truth about T\u00e9a's secret.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Elijah sat on a plane headed for London.  T\u00e9a explained that she had kept Danielle away from Ross because he had threatened to run off with the teen.   When Elijah reminded T\u00e9a that Ross had a right to see his own child, T\u00e9a informed Elijah that Todd was actually Danielle's father, not Ross.  T\u00e9a related that she had only recently discovered the truth about Danielle's paternity, but Elijah was convinced that Ross would kill T\u00e9a once he learned that Danielle wasn't his child.  Revealing that a paternity test confirmed that Todd was Danielle's father, T\u00e9a related that Danielle acted very much like Todd's daughter.\n\n\nElijah asked if Todd knew about Danielle.  After relating that Todd didn't have a clue that he had another child, T\u00e9a admitted that she hoped Todd would be thrilled once he learned about Danielle.  T\u00e9a confessed to Elijah that she had never stopped loving Todd.\n\n\nInside Matthew's dorm room in London, Danielle suggested that they plan an escape, but Matthew reminded her that he was confined to a wheelchair.  Certain that the school was wheelchair accessible, Danielle insisted that she wanted to fly to Tahiti and find her father.   Danielle told Matthew that her mother had plotted to keep her away from her father.  Danielle was convinced that her father was searching for her.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Ross attempted to locate Danielle.  As he searched the halls, Ross mumbled, \"Daddy's coming for you and I'm not leaving without you!\"  Moments later, the headmistress cornered Ross and demanded that he leave the campus at once.  When Ross identified himself as Danielle's father, the headmistress informed him that he wasn't allowed to visit Danielle.   Ross refused to leave, and the headmistress called security.\n\n\nAs the security guard escorted Ross off the premises, Ross began screaming Danielle's name.  Inside Matthew's room, Danielle heard the commotion and was certain that the voice she had heard belonged to her father.  Danielle rushed out into the hall, but saw no one.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Rachel told Nigel that she was nervous about her date with Shaun, and related that it would be their last.  Meanwhile, Shaun stood outside the door, anxious to begin his date with Rachel.\n\n\nGreg answered his door at the Palace Hotel and was stunned to find Vivian.  Once inside, Vivian attempted to seduce Greg, but soon realized that he wasn't interested.   Vivian wondered if Greg's mood was connected to the feelings he had for Rachel.  Greg insisted that he could never have a relationship with Rachel because his brother had met her first.  Greg related that he had promised his mother that he wouldn't hurt Shaun by romancing Rachel.  Vivian stated that Rachel had feelings for Greg, not Shaun.  Vivian pointed out that it wasn't fair for Greg to hurt Rachel by denying his feelings for her.\n\n\nRachel tried to gently break off her relationship with Shaun, but he continued to tell her how much he cared for her.  When Rachel referred to him as a friend, Shaun questioned if Rachel had feelings for his brother, Greg.  Rachel tried to convince Shaun that her feelings for him weren't related to Greg.  Shaun was devastated.\n\n\nShaun thanked Rachel for being honest about her feelings.  Rachel suggested that they remain friends, but Shaun wasn't sure that he could grant her that wish.  Walking away, Shaun exclaimed, \"I hope you get what you are looking for.  Whoever he is, he had better treat you right, or I'll make him sorry!\"\n\n\nBack at the wedding, as Oliver expressed his feelings to Kyle, Nick approached and advised Kyle it was time.   Oliver appeared sad as Kyle walked off with Nick.  After Oliver quieted down the protesters, Andrew began to officiate.   As he held hands with Nick, an emotional Kyle stared at Oliver.  Meanwhile, a nervous Dorian continued to scan the crowd -- looking for someone.\n\n\nNoticing that Kyle appeared distracted, Nick stated, \"Let's take it one step at a time.  I love you!\"  Nick's words caused Kyle to shiver.  Instantly, a panicked Kyle screamed out \"I can't do this!'  Privately, Kyle told Nick that he couldn't go along with the ceremony because he didn't love Nick.  Looking back at Oliver, Kyle explained, \"I want to marry the man that I love one day.   I just hope it isn't too late!\"\n\n\nAs Nick watched, Kyle approached Oliver and apologized for denying his feelings for him.  Admitting that he had always loved Oliver, Kyle asked if they could start over.  A devastated Nick ran off.  Roxy suggested that Kyle and Oliver get married.  Kyle understood when Oliver decided to put off the wedding and settle for a first date.\n\n\nObserving Dorian's nervous state, Amelia offered her the chance to back out of the ceremony.  After a brief hesitation, Dorian announced that she would go along with the ceremony.\n\n\nBack in London, David and Destiny continued to beg Nora and Bo to reveal Matthew's location.  David received voicemail.  A look of panic crossed David's face as he listened to Langston's plea that he return home and stop Dorian's wedding to Amelia.  Racing into the living room, Neville stated that Nigel had called and suggested that the Buchanans watch Dorian's wedding ceremony, which was televised on the international channel.\n\n\nAs Andrew asked that all loving couples honor the love they felt for that special person, Llanview residents thought about their own relationships.  Greg and Rachel thought about one another.  Bo and Nora shared a nervous glance.  T\u00e9a was consumed with memories of Todd.  Destiny wondered where Matthew was that very moment.\n\n\nWhen Andrew asked Dorian to kiss her bride, Dorian hesitated for a moment, but gave Amelia a kiss on the lips.  Upon witnessing Dorian's display of affection for Amelia, a shocked David dropped his cell phone.\n\n\nObserving Oliver and Kyle share a kiss, Mrs. Burns began shouting negative remarks at the couple.  Defending her friends, Roxy suggested that Mrs. Burns relax and gave the woman a kiss on the lips.\n\n\n",
