She'd had the same bad dream while she was away, and had always expected to see Todd there. He promised that he would never leave her again. Dani and Starr walked into the room, and the family had a happy reunion. Starr heard what Greg had done to T\u00e9a, and how Todd had happened to find T\u00e9a after the warehouse explosion.\n\n\nTodd also told Starr that Cole had killed Eli, and he was probably in custody at that very moment. Starr acted surprised and reported that she didn't have any knowledge of Cole's act. T\u00e9a offered to recommend a good lawyer. \"It's too late for that,\" Starr muttered. Her statement confused the others, and she claimed that she had meant that a lawyer wouldn't be able to help Cole, since there had been so many charges leveled at him. Todd asked T\u00e9a to represent Cole, but she hardly felt she was in a position to do that. She had some advice for Starr though. \"Don't do anything stupid. Play by the rules,\" T\u00e9a advised.\n\n\nDani was certain that things would all work out for Starr, just the way they had for the entire family. T\u00e9a was ready to go home, but she hadn't been officially released yet. She had to wait for the paperwork to be completed. Todd moaned about that, and Dani assumed he'd have something to say. Todd turned to Starr and said, \"We're the Mannings. We play by our own rules. Am I right, Starr?\"\n\n\nStarr had to check on news of Cole, but she thought she finally believed in miracles after hugging T\u00e9a and seeing what had happened with her. She remembered the family photo she had picked up at Cherryvale and handed it to Dani. She thought Dani had dropped it. T\u00e9a disclosed that it was her photo, and it had been by her bedside. Dani couldn't believe that she had been in that room only moments after T\u00e9a had left.\n\n\nViki paid a visit to Clint, because she wanted to know if he had any information on the reason why Echo had shown up in Llanview. She advised him that Rex had obtained some personal details from his investigation. Clint laid his book aside, and rose to fix himself a drink. Viki told Clint about Rex and his half-heart necklace, and the fact that Echo had possessed the other half. Clint suggested that the necklace might have changed hands many times over the years, and the possibility existed that Echo wasn't even the original owner. Viki didn't buy that theory given Echo's reaction to the fact that Rex had the other half.\n\n\nClint tried to defend Echo, but Viki considered Echo to be a \"manipulator.\" She was certain that Echo was back in Llanview for a ghastly reason, and she thought it had to do with Rex's real parents. Clint revealed that his own investigation hadn't turned up anything, and he thought that Viki should put it all aside. She admitted that Charlie had felt the same way as Clint, but Charlie had a \"fondness\" for Echo. They had argued about it several times, and Charlie had been upset with Viki's investigation, she admitted. Viki was still certain that Echo was there to cause trouble between Viki and Charlie. Clint pointed out that it appeared there had already been trouble with all of the arguing.\n\n\nViki agreed, since she and Charlie had been fighting since Echo's arrival. She couldn't help it, but she was afraid that Echo was there to destroy another of Viki's marriages. Charlie had insisted he wasn't Clint, though, Viki stated awkwardly. Clint wasn't offended, and he concurred that Charlie loved Viki. \"So did you,\" Viki challenged Clint. \"I loved you Viki, and you know that,\" Clint replied. He was still sorry for what he had done. Echo had been a mistake. \"I'd still be paying for it if I hadn't done what I did,\" Clint said cryptically. \"What did you do?\" Viki asked him.\n\n\nClint meant that he'd begged for Viki's forgiveness, and they'd been able to put Echo behind them. He thought that Viki was stronger than Echo, and he felt that Viki should just push Echo out of her thoughts. He thought that they'd be better served if they thought about their daughters and new grandchildren. \"Love conquers all,\" Viki quoted. That made her think about the love letters that Rex had, and she mentioned how familiar one letter had sounded when Rex had read it out loud. Clint made certain to keep his copy of  The Love Letters of Rick and Lili from Viki's view.\n\n\nViki thought that the letter Rex had read out loud was very romantic, but she still couldn't place it. She knew it was something she'd heard before. She left the Buchanan mansion and headed for home. Clint picked up his book after she had gone. The half-heart necklace was laying underneath it.\n\n\nStill at Llanfair, Rex re-read a portion of one of the letters that Rick had sent to Lili. Gigi hoped that Rex had managed to learn more about his parents after meeting with Echo. Rex noted that he had been shocked when he saw Echo's reaction after she heard that he had possession of the other half of the necklace. She had acted strangely after the necklace discussion, and after she heard a portion of Rick's letter to Lili. Echo had to have a connection to Rex's parents, Rex believed, and in fact she'd also lied about returning to Llanview after her trial. She had received a speeding ticket at that time, Rex explained.\n\n\nSuddenly, it dawned on him that it had been around the time that he was born. He thought Echo might have a connection to his mother and not his father as he had previously thought. Maybe she had been with his mother during the delivery, Rex suggested. He had shown her photo around in New Mexico, though, and no one had recognized Echo. He and Gigi wondered about Rex's father, and Gigi pondered that Rex might even have siblings. Cristian arrived with an announcement. He had an offer of a lifetime for Gigi.\n\n\nHe had applied to be a guest artist at a conference in Paris, and he was amazed to learn that he had been chosen. He wanted Gigi to accompany him, and he was leaving the next day. He had been able to include Gigi thanks to the grant he'd received for his college class, and he wanted her to help him out. She could set things up, do some odd jobs and run \"interference\" so that he could see Layla. \n\n\nGigi was unable to talk, but Rex thought it was a fantastic opportunity, and he wanted Gigi to go. Gigi didn't think she could be ready so quickly, and she didn't have a passport. Cristian had the information so that she could obtain an expedited passport, and Rex believed that Gigi could be ready in no time. He said that he and Roxy would look after Shane. Cristian admitted that he wouldn't be able to go if Gigi wasn't able to go with him.\n\n\nGigi groaned and accused Cristian of emotionally blackmailing her. Finally, Rex succeeded in persuading her to take advantage of the free trip.\n\n\nWhile Echo sat in her room at the Angel Square Hotel and looked at photos of Rex online, she didn't hear a knock at her door. Roxy walked in and demanded to know why Echo was looking at Rex's photos. Echo revealed that she was merely investigating Rex because Viki had hired him to investigate Echo. Rex even admitted he had broken into Echo's room. Roxy declared that Rex had a key and could have been delivering towels. There was no need to call the police, since the commissioner was Rex's best friend, Roxy added. Echo agreed that Rex had claimed to be in the wrong room, but he had gone through her things, even though she had nothing to hide.\n\n\nRoxy explained that Rex's job paid well, and he needed money with his girlfriend in college and a young son to take care of. Echo's eyes lit up, and she asked about Rex's child. Roxy pulled out a photo of Rex and Shane, and she asked about the glamour shots that Echo had offered to take. Echo agreed that it was a good time for a photo shoot, and Roxy went off to change her clothes. Echo smiled as she picked up the photo that Roxy had left behind.\n\n\nA nervous Roxy returned in a new outfit. She had a bottle of alcohol to calm her down, since she'd never modeled for a professional before, she informed Echo. The photographer wanted Roxy to remain sober so that she could focus. Echo suggested that Roxy relax and talk about what was important in her life. Roxy perked up and thought that was a great idea. She mentioned the strip poker night she planned on having at her hair salon. Echo recommended that Roxy talk about her family instead, and Roxy agreed that she could do that all of the time.\n\n\nShe told Echo how much Rex loved Gigi, and that he had been married to Dorian's daughter previously. She revealed that Rex had also been a ladies' man prior to his marriage. As Roxy spoke, she changed her poses, and Echo snapped photos of her. Echo informed Roxy that she was aware that Roxy wasn't Rex's biological mother, and Roxy quickly stopped posing. She wondered how Echo knew about that. Echo calmly stated that it had been cited during conversation regarding Rex's search for his real parents.\n\n\nRoxy accepted Echo's response and related details on how Rex's search had led to Santa Fe. She loved Rex as if he were her own, Roxy declared. She wondered if Echo had any children. Echo explained that it would have been too difficult to raise children with her international style of living. She asked about Rex as a child, and Roxy revealed that she hadn't raised Rex. It was complicated, but she had not been with him until he was a teen. He had been a con artist and \"gold-digger,\" she stated.  \"If you didn't know Rex and me weren't blood-related, you'd think he had traits just like his mother,\" Roxy chattered.\n\n\nThe women continued to talk about Rex as Echo asked questions, and Roxy willingly answered them. Roxy revealed that Rex's parents had been Indians. Echo corrected her and advised her that they'd been Native Americans, though she didn't think it made much sense. Rex didn't look like a Native American, Echo noted. Roxy didn't understand that, but the letters that Rex possessed only proved that his parents were exactly who they thought.\n\n\nMarty slapped Natalie and promised that she'd make Natalie pay for ruining her family. She shouted that she'd begged Natalie for help, \"woman to woman and mother to mother.\" Cole had snapped after thinking his family was dead. She asked if Natalie were happy that Cole might be going to jail for the rest of his life. \"You selfish little whore,\" Marty hissed at Natalie. She accused Natalie of being jealous when Marty was with John and about to have his baby. Natalie had hoped the baby would disappear, and she got her wish.\n\n\nMarty was about to lose Cole. \"Your day will come,\" she threatened Natalie. She added that a baby produced both happiness and heartbreak, and she hoped that Natalie's heart broke someday, because Marty would be there to laugh.\n\n\nJohn had his men search Cole's apartment for any signs of Cole, while John questioned James on Cole's whereabouts. James insisted that he hadn't seen Cole, but Starr had gone to see her family. John accused James of lying and reminded him that he was supposed to be at the police station to make a statement. James had thought he should visit Starr instead, since she'd probably needed a friend, James replied.\n\n\nJohn asked whether James was being a friend to Starr just like he was a friend to Dani when he had hidden her from Ross. James agreed that adventure hadn't gone \"according to plan,\" and an angry John advised James that he shouldn't be taking matters into his own hands. James pointed out that if he hadn't, then Starr would probably be dead. \"Oh, and you'd risk everything for Starr. Is that it?\" John asked him. The cops finished their search of the apartment, and one announced that Cole had definitely been there. The clothes he had worn when he'd shot Eli were on the floor. John told James to consider starting his story over.\n\n\nJohn returned to the station with James in tow, though James still maintained that he didn't know where Cole had gone. John accused him of covering for Cole, but James denied it. Actually, he'd be happy when Cole was \"out of the picture,\" James revealed. He wanted Starr for himself. \"That may be the first true thing that's come out of your mouth,\" John retorted. Marty was happy to hear that Cole had gotten away.\n\n\nJohn still wanted James's story, though James insisted that it wasn't a story. John warned the young man that he'd charge him with obstruction of justice and as an accomplice to murder. John advised Marty that he had men posted at her house in case Cole showed up. Marty hoped her son wouldn't appear, though John thought it would be for the best if Cole turned himself in. Marty charged John with no longer caring about Cole, but John disagreed. \"You have a funny way of showing it,\" she retorted.\n\n\nJohn walked over to Natalie and asked how she was doing. He couldn't help but notice that she appeared upset. Natalie informed him that Marty had said some \"pretty brutal things\" to her. She knew that Marty was only trying to cope, but Marty had blamed Natalie for turning over the evidence that would place blame squarely on Cole. John reminded Natalie that she had been doing her job. Natalie figured it would be debatable if Cole weren't found. John turned and stared at James.\n\n\nJohn advised Marty that she should leave, and he would call her if they had any word on Cole. Marty hoped that Cole had ended up in a place where he'd never be found. Next, John sat down with James. \"What do you say we cut the crap,\" he proposed. He knew that James thought he was helping Starr out, but he was making things worse. He shouldn't want to see her hurt, John stated. Starr could get into trouble if she was found to be helping Cole. He wanted James to tell the truth, or Starr could be in danger.\n\n\nJohn told Natalie to go home and get some rest. \"I'm really glad you're alive,\" she told him. \"So am I,\" he replied. They shared a kiss, and Natalie left. \"Hey anything to tell me?\" he called out to James. When there was no answer, John determined that he would put James in lock-up for the night. Suddenly, James spoke up. He knew where Cole was.\n\n\nViki returned to Llanfair and began to read through Rex's letters. She suddenly realized where she had seen the writing, and she began to search through her bookshelves. Finally, she found what she was looking for. It was her own copy of The Love Letters of Rick and Lili.\n\n\nRoxy left the photo session to don a new outfit, but Echo thought they should end the photography for the night. She thought a model should stay \"fresh.\" Roxy remembered to pick up her photo of Rex and Shane before she left Echo's room.\n\n\nClint put his book away and received a phone call from Echo. She wanted to see him right away. It was urgent.\n\n\nTodd helped T\u00e9a as they finally left the hospital. On the way out, they ran into Greg, who was in handcuffs. Some police officers were ushering him through the corridor.\n\n\nCole was sitting in his room at the Minute Man Motel when there was a knock on his door. He opened it slowly. \"I was so afraid you wouldn't come,\" he said to his visitor. \"Of course I came,\" Starr replied.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Tea, Todd and Dani are happily together. Starr is elated that they are all ok. But she's worried about Cole. John knows that both she and James are covering for him. Marty is very protective of her son and rips into Natalie after finding out that she won't cover for Cole when all the evidence points at him for shooting and killing Eli. James refuses to tell John what he knows about Cole's whereabouts. But at the end, he breaks down and admits that he knows where Cole is. Starr goes to see Cole where he is hiding and tells nobody. Viki seems to know that Echo has some sort of secret about Rex's birth and the half heart necklace that his bio mom left with him after he was born. Clint seems to know her secret and tells Viki she need not be threatened by Echo. Echo photographs Roxy and indicates she is very interested in Rex and wants Roxy to tell her about Rex's childhood and history. Roxy suspects nothing. But Viki finds something very familiar about the love letter that Rex shared with her that his bio dad wrote to his bio mom. Clint knows something about it also. And Echo obviously has a very profound \"connection\" and interest in Rex.",
