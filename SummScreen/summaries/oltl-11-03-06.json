When Viki and Clint have to leave to put the finishing touches on the evening they have planned for Jessica and Antonio, Dorian makes a snide comment to Kelly about her taking over where Viki and Clint left off since she has cleared her calendar and nothing comes before Kelly and her baby. After unsuccessfully trying to get Kelly to get some rest, Kevin decides that the best thing for Dorian to do would be to leave. Dorian wonders if Kelly is going to let Kevin just send her away like that.

Todd vows that he will make the jurors see the truth about Spencer one way or another.

When Cris wonders what's up, Evangeline shares with him her fear that Todd will get the trial changed to a different location because of his relentless crusade against Spencer in his newspaper. Cris tries to get her mind off of it by reminding her how lucky they are to have found each other and lucky Antonio and Jessica are that after everything they are finally getting married.

Spencer defends his mother and the lie she told on her death bed but David is not as forgiving and tries to figure why his mother would use Spencer from the grave to exact revenge on Asa. Spencer tries to remind his brother that Asa ruined their mother's life but David counters with Asa didn't force their mother to become a prostitute. David tries to get Spencer to see that his whole failed revenge scheme was based on a lie but even he can't quite put his finger around why their mother would lie especially on her death bed. Spencer can't see how their mother's favorite son could so easily turn his back on her. David suggests that his mother treated him better because she saw how Spencer and his dad treated him so badly. Secretly they both wonder about Eve's motivations when she told Spencer that Asa got her pregnant and then abandoned her. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Antonio is getting ready for his wedding the next day. He isn't' having a bachelor party and finds himself over at Nash's place working on a project. He lets Nash know that he is aware of the deal that the man has with Vincent for a loan. He offers to pay off the loan so that Nash will owe Antonio instead. He is doing it for Bree's benefit. Nash accepts the deal. Cris isn't comfortable with the man who was in love with Jessica's alter attending the wedding. Antonio isn't worried at all. Dorian isn't happy that Kevin and Kelly seem to be leaning to naming the baby Buchanan. Kevin and Kelly want that as it would make Duke happy and that is his father's name. David goes to see Spencer. David is mystified over why their mother would lie about her son belonging to Asa. Spencer still talks of the woman as if she were a saint, but David sees that Spencer was just used to bring out their mother's revenge. Evangeline freaks out on Todd and Blair for their radical articles. They think she is overreacting. She tells that if there are too many attacks on Spencer the trial will be moved somewhere else where the citizens may not be as interested in seeing justice done as the people of Llanview would be. Todd compliments Evangeline assuring her that all she has to do is bat those brown eyes to win this case. Blair is strangely quiet. Blair comes to Evangeline later and starts about Todd flirting with her. \"Oh Blair, you know that he only does that to get a rise out of you.\" Blair feels that Todd does it because he is slowly getting through to Evangeline and she knows it. Rex gives Todd the bad news. The lawyer that may have had information on Todd's baby is dead. They would probably try to go to court to get the man's records searched, but the man died in a tornado and it damaged the building that he was in, as well as the business records that were stored there. David finds Spencer's priorities screwed up. He is in jail, with nothing to look forward to, and he will never get out of jail. \"If you get out of prison Spencer it will be because you were executed!\" Spencer can see that his brother obviously doesn't know him very well if he believes that there is no way for the man to get out of there.",
