Presenting Keys with a picture of Marty, John demanded that Keys implicate Todd and provide him with answers to Marty's whereabouts. John informed Keys that he was aware that Keys had removed Marty from Ramsey's apartment on the night of the murder, and relocated her to Todd's residence. John threatened to have Keys charged with kidnapping unless he cooperated. Unshaken by John's threats, Keys denied any involvement. \n\n\nFed up with Keys's lack of cooperation, John choked Keys and threatened to drown him in the pool. Fearing for his life, Keys blurted out that Marty was residing at Todd's residence. Certain that Todd was holding Marty against her will, John asked Keys about Marty's state of mind and health. To his surprise, Keys reported that Marty had apparently been involved in an accident, but appeared to enjoy being cared for by Todd. When John ordered Keys to return to Llanview and divulge Marty's whereabouts to the judge, Keys realized that John's interest in Marty was of a personal nature. \n\n\nMarty appeared dumbfounded when Todd showed her a picture of Starr and Cole. Unaware of the identity of the teens in the picture, Marty questioned who they were and why Todd felt the need to show her the photo. Todd revealed to Marty that Starr and Cole were the teens in the picture. Remembering Todd's claims that Cole had attacked Starr, Marty wondered why Todd would keep the picture. \n\n\nAfter having a flashback of Marty's revelation that she had visions of a little boy, Todd shocked Marty when he told her that Cole wasn't a bad kid. Todd admitted that he had overreacted when he found Starr and Cole together. Marty was surprised when Todd told her that she was responsible for his change of heart towards Cole. Confiding in Marty, Todd recalled how Cole refused to be intimidated by him and how Cole had stood by Starr. Todd said that he realized that Cole truly loved Starr. Marty believed that Starr and Cole should have the opportunity to one day be involved in their child's life, but Todd quickly reminded her that they needed to leave town with the baby before John discovered them. Although moved by Todd's revelation, Marty still wondered why he showed her the photo after she asked him if he had knowledge of a child from her past. Before Todd could answer, his cell phone rang. \n\n\nCole rushed Starr to the emergency room after she began having contractions. As the contractions grew worse, a terrified Cole screamed for help. \n\n\nInside the examination room, Mike told Starr that she was experiencing mild contractions and related that he had contacted Dr. Joplin, who would be able to give an accurate time of the baby's expected arrival. Mike showed little reaction when Cole told him that Blair and Marcie were en route to the hospital. \n\n\nLeft alone, Cole offered to stay with Starr until Blair and Marcie arrived. Starr thanked Cole and remarked that she felt better having him there. As Starr and Cole bonded, Blair and Marcie arrived. When Dr. Joplin entered the room to exam Starr, Cole stepped out into the waiting room. After the examination, Dr. Joplin told Starr and Blair that she would be in labor for a while and insisted on admitting her to the hospital. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the waiting area, Cole confided in Mike that he was concerned that the baby wouldn't have a father. Cole wondered if Todd might interfere in Marcie's adoption of the child. \n\n\nMarcie and Mike discussed the arrival of Starr's baby. Marcie pleaded with Mike to reconsider his decision about helping her raise the child. Bringing Marcie back to reality, Mike reminded her that Todd would never allow the adoption to proceed. Marcie argued that Todd had come to terms with Starr's decision and was certain that he wouldn't cause any problems. A saddened Mike informed Marcie that he wasn't willing to deal with the loss of another child and experience the wrath of Todd again. \n\n\nAs Starr slept, Cole gave Starr a loving kiss. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Charlie discovered an obviously troubled Tess in the kitchen. Pretending to be Jessica, Tess revealed to Charlie that she wasn't feeling well. When Charlie inquired about Tess's health, she told him that she had been experiencing blackouts and feared that her condition was associated with her alter. Charlie informed Tess that Viki was upstairs and insisted on getting her for Tess. As Charlie turned to head upstairs, Tess clobbered him with a frying pan, knocking him unconscious. After whacking Charlie, Tess began experiencing painful contractions and fell to the floor. Realizing that she needed to escape before Viki came downstairs, Tess stumbled out of the house, declaring that she had no desire to be blown to pieces when her bomb exploded. \n\n\nMoments later, Viki came downstairs and nearly panicked when she discovered Charlie sprawled out on the kitchen floor. When Charlie regained consciousness, he told Viki that Jessica had been there--and that she was actually Tess. Although alarmed that Tess had attacked Charlie, Viki was relieved to learn that Charlie hadn't revealed that Bree was upstairs and not at Todd's. \n\n\nBelieving that Bree was still with Todd, Tess drove in the direction of Todd's house. Refusing to believe that the baby was on the way, Tess remarked that she would pick up Bree and they would all relocate far away from Llanview. She laughed to herself as she thought about everyone at Llanfair being blown away in the explosion. \n\n\nTess placed a call to Todd and informed him that she was on her way to pick up Bree. Before Todd could tell her that Bree was with Viki, Tess experienced another painful contraction and insisted that Todd keep Bree for a while. After Tess hung up, she exclaimed that she hadn't experienced the same painful contractions when she was pregnant with Bree. \n\n\nMarty continued to question Todd, but his cell phone rang again. Dr. Joplin phoned to tell him that the baby was on the way and pleaded with Todd to change his mind about stealing Starr's baby. Todd refused to listen and informed Joplin that he would send Janet to assist in the delivery. Afterwards, Todd made up an excuse about his decision to show Marty the picture. He had good news for Marty - they would soon be parents. Marty was thrilled. \n\n\nViki phoned Todd and inquired about Tess. Todd informed Viki that Tess had called and asked him to keep Bree before he could explain that Viki had already taken the child back to Llanfair. Todd warned Viki that Tess didn't sound well. Viki wondered where Tess could have gone. \n\n\nTess arrived at the cottage she once shared with Nash. Reassuring herself that Bree was safe with Todd, Tess was unconcerned about the potential victims at Llanfair. She told her unborn child that they would wait for Nash to come home. Calling out to her dead husband, Tess appeared shock to find the cottage in a state of disrepair. Begging Nash to help her, a distressed Tess experienced another contraction and fell over in pain. \n\n\nAt Angel Square Park, Tina tossed the box of \"fake\" jewels at Cain and rushed toward the dog carrier, containing David Vickers. As Cain examined the jewels, Tina examined the dog and realized that he was an imposter. Demanding to know where David Vickers was, Tina lashed out at Cain for deceiving her. After admitting that the dog was a fake, Cain referred to him as Cord. Cain told Tina that he resented her feelings for David Vickers and believed that she cared more for the dog than she did for him. \n\n\nAccusing her of lying about the jewels and attempting to poison him, Cain told Tina that he cared for her until she called him Cord on that fateful night in Mendorra. Attempting to deceive Cain, Tina apologized for hurting him and expressed her love for him. Informing Tina that he was aware of her tricks, Cain threatened to hurt Tina and run off with the jewels. Explaining that several people were depending on her, Tina pleaded with Cain to take her to David Vickers. Appearing to regret the threat he had made, Cain told Tina that he could never hurt her and agreed to reunite her with the dog. Smiling to herself, Tina was certain that Cain wouldn't harm her. As they walked off, Cain advised Tina that if the jewels weren't real - she would be in a great deal of trouble.\n\n\n",
