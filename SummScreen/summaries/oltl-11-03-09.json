Langston and Starr stood next to Markko and Cole.  Starr confessed that she was relieved that she couldn't vote; she didn't think that she could chose between her aunts.  Langston announced that she wouldn't hesitate to vote for her mother.  Langston grew concerned when she noticed that Markko and Cole remained silent.\n\n\nWhen Langston tried to confirm that Markko intended to vote for Dorian, Markko reminded Langston that Viki had opened her home to him when he had needed a place to live.  Langston argued that it wasn't sufficient reason for Markko to vote for Viki.  Before Markko could respond, Dorian approached them.  Dorian was eager to know how her wedding had played out with the younger voters on the Internet.\n\n\nStarr took the opportunity to apologize to Dorian for giving her a difficult time about the wedding.  Starr conceded that it had been a beautiful ceremony and she was glad that she had attended the wedding.  Langston smiled as she handed Dorian a newspaper and then added, \"If I didn't know better, I'd think that you two were a real couple.\"  Dorian glanced down to see a picture on the front page of her kissing Amelia.\n\n\nLater, Langston remained upset because Markko was tight-lipped about whom he intended to vote for.  The tension mounted when Ernesto and Aurelia Rivera approached their son.  When Ernesto commented that he had seen Markko on television during the mass wedding ceremony, Langston defiantly announced that they had all attended Dorian's wedding because they supported the cause.\n\n\nDorian greeted the Riveras and then introduced Amelia.  Dorian made a point of clarifying that Amelia was her partner.  Ernesto and Aurelia politely nodded their heads before Aurelia asked if Amelia and Dorian were, \"Mrs. and Mrs.\"  Dorian started to explain that the marriage had been symbolic, but Amelia rushed to clarify that Dorian's first act as mayor would be to make the marriages legal.\n\n\nThe Riveras appeared uncomfortable with the direction of the conversation, so they decided to cast their votes.  After the Riveras walked away, Dorian asked to have a private word with Markko. Dorian realized that Markko loved his parents.  She credited the Riveras with raising a fine son, but she referred to their conservative views as \"idiosyncrasies.\"  Dorian was confident that Markko was capable of thinking for himself.   Markko turned to Langston as he confirmed that he was an \"independent\" thinker.\n\n\nLangston refused to back down; she continued to pressure Markko to vote for Dorian.  When Langston failed to sway Markko, she threatened to break up with him if he didn't vote for Dorian.  Markko was stunned.  Later, Markko didn't hesitate to cast his vote.  He appeared pleased as he left the booth.  Langston immediately pounced, demanding to know whom he had voted for.  Markko made it clear that his vote was none of her business.\n\n\nAmelia approached Nick as he sat on a bench, reading the newspaper.  Amelia tried to offer Nick words of comfort.  She suggested that perhaps Kyle wasn't ready to get married.  Nick looked up at Amelia with a look of disbelief as he asked, \"You think?\"  Amelia ignored the question to congratulate Nick on all he had accomplished for their cause.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Kyle and Oliver were surprised that they had spent the entire night on the rooftop, talking.  Kyle tensed when Oliver announced that they needed to discuss their future.  Oliver was worried because he had no idea how to be in a relationship.  Kyle relaxed as he teasingly explained that relationships were very complicated.  Kyle advised Oliver to start with the first step: going on a date with Kyle.\n\n\nOliver smiled as he accepted Kyle's invitation to dinner.  However, Oliver remained troubled.  Oliver was concerned that he would somehow disappoint Kyle.  Kyle didn't share Oliver's fears.  Kyle explained that they had wanted the relationship for too long to take it for granted.  Kyle suggested that as long as they were honest and talked things through, they would be able to make it work.\n\n\nOliver visibly relaxed, prompting Kyle to suggest that they grab a bite to eat.  Before Oliver and Kyle left the rooftop, they exchanged declarations of love and then kissed.\n\n\nLater, Kyle and Oliver bumped into Nick while they were on their way to the diner for breakfast.  Oliver stepped away while Kyle talked to Nick.  Kyle apologized for hurting Nick; he promised that it had never been his intention.  Nick appreciated Kyle's honesty, but it was clear that Nick didn't find any comfort in knowing that Kyle hadn't meant to break his heart.  He wished Kyle and Oliver well and then walked away.\n\n\nGigi went to Angel Square to vote.  As she made her way to the voting poll, she passed Schuyler.  Gigi stopped in front of him, but didn't say anything.  Schuyler reminded Gigi that he was the guy that she had feelings for.  When Gigi remained silent, Schuyler admitted that when they had discussed how they would deal with the situation between them, he hadn't figured that she would opt to bury her head in the sand.\n\n\nGigi regretted telling Schuyler about her conflicted feelings.  Gigi reminded Schuyler that she and Rex had gone through hell to be together, so she intended to make her relationship with Rex work.  Gigi argued that Schuyler would be too busy with medical school anyway.  Schuyler informed Gigi that being busy wouldn't make his feelings go away.  Frustrated, Gigi demanded to know if Schuyler expected her to run away with him.\n\n\nAfter Schuyler walked away, Noelle approached Gigi.  Noelle wanted to know whom Gigi intended to vote for, but Gigi was too preoccupied to discuss the election.  Gigi wondered, \"What if the love of my life isn't really the love of my life?\"  To Noelle's surprise, Gigi revealed that she had kissed Schuyler.  Noelle understood that Gigi might have some unresolved issues about Rex and Stacy, but she advised her friend not to act rashly.  Noelle warned Gigi that if she continued to \"stir up\" things with Schuyler, she might lose Rex.\n\n\nIn the voting booth, Gigi looked at the ballot.  However, rather than Dorian and Viki's names, she saw Schuyler and Rex's names.  Gigi was too lost in her thoughts to realize that her cell phone was vibrating.  Later, Gigi bumped into Marty.  She apologized for canceling their first appointment, but promised to reschedule when Rex returned to town.  Marty suggested that Gigi could get a jump-start on things by making an appointment for herself. \n\n\nStarr was surprised when she spotted Schuyler at Angel Square.  Schuyler was delighted to see Starr.  They talked about Hope and then Schuyler told Starr about his plans to return to medical school.  Starr was happy for Schuyler.  After they parted, Starr joined Cole.  When she realized that Cole had seen her with Schuyler, she assured him that he didn't have anything to worry about.  Starr promised that Cole was the only one for her.\n\n\nJohn tried to question the  clerk at the motel that Rex and Natalie had tracked Jared to.  The clerk claimed that he had told John everything, but John didn't believe him.  When the clerk pointed out that John was out of his jurisdiction, John smiled and then called out to someone.  Moments later, a local police officer appeared.\n\n\nJohn informed the police officer that the clerk had a criminal history that made him a likely suspect in the recent rash of robberies in town.  The clerk denied that he had been involved in the crimes, but the police officer and John ignored him.  John hoped that a few days in jail would jog the clerk's memory.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Viki, Charlie, and Clint discussed the troubles that their children faced.  Viki was concerned because Jessica had left to help Brody; meanwhile, Natalie had gone in search of Jared.  Clint assured Charlie that he thought of Jared like a son.  Charlie appreciated Clint's support.\n\n\nA short time later, John checked in with Viki, Charlie, and Clint.  John was disappointed when he realized that no one had heard from Natalie.  John confessed that he suspected that Natalie was intentionally avoiding him.  Charlie insisted that his son was not a killer, so he understood Natalie's reluctance to trust John.  John decided to leave, but he asked that they notify him if they heard from Natalie.\n\n\nAfter John left, Viki and Charlie went to Angel Square.  Viki left an urgent message on Natalie's voicemail for her daughter to return her call.  As Viki disconnected the call, a reporter approached her.  When Dorian saw Viki with the reporter, she decided to force Viki to share the limelight.  Dorian approached Viki and then made a show of making peace with her rival before shaking hands.\n\n\nRex and Natalie arrived at the vineyard in Napa Valley.  They searched the cottage, but found it empty.  However, moments later, they heard a noise.  Rex and Natalie ducked out of sight long enough for someone to cross their path.  Rex managed to capture the intruder before the person could escape.  It was Jessica.\n\n\nJessica explained that Nash had directed her to the cottage.  Natalie poked around while Jessica told them about the events that had led to her arrival in Napa Valley.  To Jessica and Rex's surprise, Natalie informed them that the cottage had not been abandoned.  Natalie lifted a coffee pot as proof; it was warm.\n\n\nRex was frustrated when he realized that Jessica hadn't told anyone about her plans to travel to Napa Valley.  Rex pointed out that, for all intents and purposes, no one knew where Natalie and Jessica were.  Moments later, Rex's phone rang.  It was his aunt, Corrine.  Corrine revealed that she was dying of cancer.  According to Corrine, she only had a few days to put her affairs in order.  Corrine wanted to see Rex, so that she could tell him about his father.\n\n\nAfter Rex ended the call, he told Natalie and Jessica about his aunt's plight.  Natalie urged Rex to honor his aunt's wishes, since Corrine had practically raised Rex.  Rex was reluctant to leave Natalie and Jessica alone.  Natalie assured Rex that she would contact the police.  Rex called Gigi to let her know about his change of plans.\n\n\nRex continued to stall at the cottage until Natalie called John to arrange for the Napa Valley police to search the vineyard.  After Rex left, Natalie revealed that she had merely pretended to place a call to John.  Natalie didn't have any intention of involving John or the police while Jared had two murder charges hanging over his head.\n\n\nIn Niles, Michigan, Brody discovered that he had been tied to a chair.  When his sister Nadine entered the living room, Brody accused her of drugging his coffee.  Brody demanded to be released, but Nadine ignored him.  She taped up his mouth and then, with Corrine's help, moved him to the next room.\n\n\nCorrine and Nadine returned to the living room to finalize their plans for Rex.  Nadine drugged the coffee, while Corrine settled on the sofa and then proceeded to play the part of a dying cancer-stricken patient.  When Rex arrived, Corrine introduced Nadine as a friend who was nursing Corrine through the final stages of her terminal illness.\n\n\nJohn met up with Marty in Angel Square.  She immediately sensed that John was troubled.  John admitted that he was concerned because he hadn't been able to locate Natalie or Rex.  John was stunned when Marty announced that she might be able to help him.  According to Marty, Rex had called Gigi to let him know that he was headed to Michigan to see his aunt.\n\n\nJohn found it strange that Brody and Rex had gone to Michigan.  He suspected that someone was trying to isolate Jessica and Natalie.\n\n\nIn Napa Valley, Jessica and Natalie sat in the cottage.  They were unaware that someone lurked outside, watching them.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Everybody awaits the outcome of Viki's and Dorian's election results. Meanwhile, Dorian knows she is not over David and that it's a lie to have married Amelia. Nick is similarly depressed to know that Kyle has left him at the altar because he really loves Oliver Fish. Rex gets an urgent phone call from his aunt in Michigan who tells him she is dying and desperately needs his help, so he rushes to her side. John realizes it's a bit odd that it happened right after Brody got a call about a family emergency for his sister in Michigan. It appears that Rex's aunt and Brody's sister are working together. Brody is bound and gagged, and they are ready to drug Rex.",
