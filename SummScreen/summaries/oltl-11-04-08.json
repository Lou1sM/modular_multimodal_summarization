    "soap_central": "\nUnder Lock and Keys:\n\n\nAt the hospital, Addie was on hand when Starr woke up from a nightmare. She told Addie that she had a dream that she had given birth to a little girl but that after the delivery the baby had disappeared. In the dream, Starr worried that she had done something horribly wrong to cause her baby to vanish. Addie calmed Starr by reminding her that it had been nothing more than a dream. Starr tried to shake off the disturbing images but she remained anxious about the baby. She wondered how she would find the strength when the time came for her to give up her baby. The subject eventually turned to Todd. Starr wondered if her father had truly changed. Starr thought that the Todd she had known for most of her life would never have given up on keeping the baby away from Marcie. \n\n\nJanet intercepted Dr. Joplin before she entered Starr's room. When Janet revealed that Todd had sent her, Dr. Joplin bristled. She let Janet know that she was an unwilling participant in Todd's plan to steal Starr's baby. Janet reminded Dr. Joplin that Starr always intended to give her baby away to a loving family. As far as Janet was concerned, nothing had changed except who would be raising the child. Janet was able to live with their deception because she knew that the baby would be loved and well cared for in its new home. \n\n\nAt his home, Todd surprised Marty with several shopping bags filled with new clothes. Marty was impressed that Todd had correctly guessed her size. She was also touched when she learned that Todd had used flattering terms to describe her to the sales clerk so that she could help him find the best fashion style for Marty. Todd's gifts didn't stop at clothes. He opened his laptop and showed Marty the home he had purchased for them in New Mexico. Marty was thrilled and asked Todd what had prompted him to buy a house in New Mexico. Without going into detail, Todd let Marty know that his childhood had been difficult because of Peter Manning. To escape the hardships of his life, Todd would read a book called Great Escapes. Todd derived a sense of peace when he looked at the pictures of New Mexico. \n\n\nLater, Todd received an unexpected call from Starr. She told him that she was in the hospital, preparing to give birth. Todd urged Starr to take full advantage of the medications that were available to her. Ironically, he did not want Starr to suffer any pain. As the two talked, Starr told her father that she loved him and was hopeful that, with time, they would be able to repair their broken relationship. Before they ended the call, Todd expressed his deep affection for Starr and told her that everything he had done had been out of love. \n\n\nJanet called Todd from the hospital to let him know that her credentials had passed muster and she had been cleared to help Dr. Joplin during Starr's delivery. \n\n\nJohn and Blair ran into each other at the courthouse. While Keyshawn waited nearby, John spoke to Blair. Without revealing specifics, John warned Blair that Todd was in serious trouble. Blair wanted to asked questions but didn't have the time to pursue it because she was late for Vanessa's bail hearing. Before Blair dashed off, John told Blair that he cared deeply for her. \n\n\nWhen Blair joined Dorian and the kids in the courtroom, Vanessa's hearing was underway. The judge seemed reluctant to grant Vanessa bail until Cris stood up and spoke on her behalf. When he asked the judge to release Vanessa into his custody, Nora didn't object. The judge agreed to a $25,000.00 bond and ordered Vanessa to relinquish her passports so that she couldn't flee the country. Sarah tried to hide her displeasure over the idea of Vanessa and Lola moving into Cris's loft. \n\n\nJohn brought Keyshawn before a judge in the hopes of persuading the judge to issue John another search warrant for Todd's house. When Keyshawn revealed that Todd had Marty Saybrook hidden at his house, the judge failed to give John the response he expected. Instead of issuing a search warrant, the judge told John that Keyshawn's testimony was not sufficient evidence to justify the court order. John was furious and threatened to take matters into his own hands if the judge refused to help a woman who had been kidnapped by a man convicted of raping her. Things quickly escalated and a bailiff was forced to restrain John when he tried to walk out of the courtroom. \n\n\nGigi and Shane talked while Rex visited with Brody. Gigi was proud of her son for putting the needs of someone else ahead of his own. Shane turned that around on Gigi and asked her, \"Isn't that what Brody did?\" Meanwhile, Rex and Brody made peace with each other and reached an understanding. Before Rex left, Brody extended an olive branch by telling Rex that Shane loved hot dogs. When Rex joined Gigi and Shane in the waiting area, Shane was eager to visit with Brody. Gigi went with Shane to Brody's room but left after Brody reassured her that the MPs watched him closely. \n\n\nGigi rejoined Rex while Shane spent time with Brody. Rex expressed his disappointment over Shane's continued rejection. Gigi was sympathetic and suggested that Rex and Shane just needed time to work things out. She was confident that Shane would eventually let go of his anger and allow Rex into his heart. \n\n\nShane insisted that he considered Brody his father, not Rex. Brody seemed touched by the sentiment but tried to help Shane move forward. He asked Shane to fetch him a box in his nightstand. When Shane opened the box, he found it lined with various commendations from the United States government. Brody pinned the Silver Star, given for valor, to Shane's jacket and told him that he was the bravest kid that Brody knew. Brody then asked Shane to think of him as a good friend, not a father. Shane was overcome with emotion and gave Brody a tight hug before he left. In the hallway, as Rex prepared to leave, Shane asked Rex to wait. \n\n\nAntonio questioned Ray before a federal marshal arrived to return Ray to a prison in Colombia. Ray insisted that he did not murder his wife, but Antonio wasn't convinced. He couldn't understand why Lola would testify and lie about such a heinous crime if her father was innocent. Ray said that Lola had been confused after the tragic loss of her mother and Vanessa had taken advantage of it. Ray went on to claim that Vanessa had brainwashed Lola so that she believed Vanessa's version of events. Ray went on to say that Vanessa was diabolical and vindictive. He warned Antonio that no man was safe around Vanessa, including Cris. Later, before Ray was carted off to the airport, Ray made another attempt to get through to Antonio. He said that if anything happened to Lola, her blood would be on Antonio's hands.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd and Marty are getting ready to run away together after they \"adopt\" Starr's baby. Marty still suspects nothing from Todd. John persuades Todd's former bodyguard to confess to the judge that he helped Todd move Marty from Ramsey's old house to Todd's new house. And he demands that he gets another search warrant. But the judge tells him no way. He has no proof that Marty could be alive and no grounds for the search warrant. John then tantrums and gets physically removed from the courtroom. Vanessa has her arraignment hearing. Cristian tells the judge that he will let her stay with him and protests that she is not a threat nor a flight risk. But Ray Montez protests to Antonio that Vanessa is lying with all that she says about him. Rex goes to talk to Brody privately and thanks him for taking care of Shane. Brody is willing to make peace with the fact that Rex is Shane's father and the man Gigi loves. But Shane cannot part with Brody nor accept that he is not his dad. When Starr is alone in her hospital room, she calls Todd and admits to her father that she loves him. At that point, Todd may be having second thoughts. Janet and Dr. Joplin are also wondering whether they should go through with Todd's plan when Starr's baby is born.",
