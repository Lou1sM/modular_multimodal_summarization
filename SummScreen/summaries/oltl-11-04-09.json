Yelling into the phone, he ordered an underling to get him the mayoral poll results so he could find out who won.  A private investigator entered and handed him a dossier on T\u00e9a, but had no information on who she had traveled to London with.  Todd ordered the P.I. to follow her; he said he needed to know everything about T\u00e9a's alleged con against him, and wondered if the man flying with her was Ross.\n\n\nBlair entered the office just in time to hear Ross's name mentioned, and immediately began to denounce her former partner in crime, calling him trash.  Todd explained that Ross had skipped town, and Blair claimed she was pleased.  As the P.I. left, Blair told Todd they needed to celebrate \"his child.\"\n\n\nTodd was confused until Blair revealed that Starr and Cole had asked her to plan a party for Hope's birthday.  Todd was reticent to get involved, but Blair encouraged him to take a more active role in his family's affairs.  She knocked over the dossier on Todd's desk, and picked up the photos of T\u00e9a that scattered on the floor.  Irate, she asked him if he was still chasing T\u00e9a.\n\n\nTodd admitted that he found T\u00e9a's confession of her plans to con him suspicious, and wanted to know why she'd headed for London.  He figured that she'd only come clean in order to hide a much bigger secret.  Eager to change the subject, Blair told him to let T\u00e9a go, and suggested he focus on his children and grandchild rather than his sad love life.  Todd agreed to take part in the festivities for Hope, and Blair comforted him, reassuring him that he would be okay.\n\n\nAfter Blair left, Todd called his P.I., who said he was stuck at the airport.  Todd commanded him to take the company jet and get to London at all costs.\n\n\nAt the Warwick Academy in London, Tom, Danielle, and Matthew continued strategizing their  \"great escape.\"  Tom and Danielle were at odds over key details, which interrupted Matthew's call to Rachel.  Matthew told them to be quiet as he spoke to his sister.\n\n\nOn the phone in Angel Square, Rachel apologized to Matthew for his parents' deception, and said she was ready to visit.  Matthew told her to wait a while, and asked her about Shaun's condition.  As he spoke, Rachel noticed Greg entering the park.\n\n\nAt the other end of the line, Tom and Danielle continued to argue.  Tom warned Danielle that many had attempted to escape Warwick and failed.  Danielle said she and Matthew had true motivation: freedom and mobility.  Exasperated by their interruptions, Matthew yelled at them to shut up.  Hearing the commotion, Rachel told Matthew she'd call him back when he wasn't so busy.\n\n\nHanging up back in Llanview, Rachel greeted Greg.  She explained the circumstances of Matthew's unexpected trans-continental move, and said Bo and Nora had gone beyond the pale to protect him from himself.  Greg was surprised by the Buchanans' actions, and reminded Rachel that the longer Matthew's operation was put off, the worse it would be for him.  \"Like us,\" she said wistfully.\n\n\nRachel told Greg that she'd broken up with Shaun, but said she'd lied to him and hadn't told him about her feelings for his brother.  Greg suggested they tell him together, but Rachel said there was nothing to tell; she wasn't ready to pursue a romance.  She said she needed time to think.  Greg agreed, and kissed Rachel to \"start the clock.\"  Just then, Shaun walked into the park, spotting them.\n\n\nSeething, Shaun confronted the lovers.  He told Rachel she could've told him the truth, and slammed Greg for betraying him for a woman.  \"How long have you been playing me, brother?\" he snarled, getting in Greg's face.\n\n\nRachel said no one was playing him, but Shaun didn't believe her.  He asked if they'd been together since Greg hit town, and said he knew his brother's routine; Greg used and abused people, then tossed them aside, just like Destiny and the rest of the family.  He said Greg would abandon Rachel, as well.  Rachel wanted to apologize, but Shaun told her to save her self-serving apology.  He warned them to leave him alone, and stalked out.\n\n\nNot far away, Kim met Stacy on a park bench and handed her a sonogram photo of someone else's baby, one which would match the date of conception for a child fathered by Rex.  Kim credited \"lonely people\" at the hospital lab with aiding her scheme, and told Stacy to give Rex the photo in case he asked after the baby.  She joked that unless the baby was born with a craving for Liza Minnelli, no one would ever know that Stacy's child was actually Oliver's.\n\n\nStacy thanked Kim for her help in bagging Rex, but noticed her friend's loneliness.  Kim bemoaned being single in Llanview, and said her plan to grab a rich Buchanan had hit a snag, as Bo was in London with his ex-wife and \"crippled son.\"   She said she'd been at the Palace bar and heard gossip about Bo and Nora's long history, and concluded she didn't stand a chance with the lone eligible family member in town, who apparently still had eyes for his ex.\n\n\nStacy told Kim to cheer up and take aim at Clint instead.  She reminded Kim that with Bo and Nora out of town and getting cozy again, Clint was all alone at the mansion, rich and lovelorn.  Comparing and contrasting the brothers, Stacy explained that Clint was richer than Bo, as well as closer at hand.  As Bo and Nora hit the sheets, Kim could be the next Mrs. Clint Buchanan.  Delighted with the idea, Kim embraced Stacy.\n\n\nIn London, Destiny wandered the Buchanan compound, searching for a place to charge her cellphone so she could call Matthew.  Neville suggested she use the landline; before she could do so, however, Neville answered the ringing phone himself.  As the butler walked down the hall, David entered the foyer and asked Destiny if she'd been able to get in touch with her beloved yet.  Destiny begged him to keep his voice down, and said she hoped to convince Bo and Nora to take her to see Matthew at his new school.  David told her to let Bo and Nora be, as they had their own issues to work out.\n\n\nDown the hall, Neville spoke to Nigel in Llanview.  Neville complained about David's boorish behavior, and Nigel warned his cousin to keep an eye on the scheming new heir.  He asked Neville to connect a call from Clint to Nora.\n\n\nNora walked into the drawing room to find Bo working on his laptop.  Bo  leapt to his feet, pleased to see she'd returned, but Nora said she'd needed to get away and think.  She admitted that she had been avoiding him.  Bo asked her why, prompting a surprise entrance from David, who said he knew the reason: if Nora were alone with Bo, \"[she'd] jump your bones!\"\n\n\nBo and Nora were infuriated by David's endless meddling and eavesdropping, but David didn't sympathize.  \"If I knocked, I wouldn't walk in on anything good,\" he reasoned.  He urged the star-crossed lovers not to hide from each other; they'd spent years burying their feelings, and if they kept running away, they could end up \"old and alone.\"  Bo told David that their lives were none of his business, but before the argument could continue, Neville arrived with the phone. It was Clint, calling for Nora.  David told her to put it off, but Nora took the call.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Destiny asked Neville if she could use the phone to call Matthew, but Neville apologized and said Nora was using the line.  Destiny wasn't worried, as she figured Matthew wouldn't be leaving London in the near future.\n\n\nAs Nora spoke with Clint, David and Bo bickered about the situation.  Bo ordered him to stay out of it, but David insisted that Bo and Nora belonged together.  Bo asked what that would mean for Clint.  David said that Clint or no Clint, they shouldn't end up like him and Dorian, unable to get past their differences and all the obstacles in their way.  Bo asked why he cared, and David said he wanted to see his \"Daddy\" happy with Nora, who he called \"Big Mama.\"\n\n\nAt the other side of the room, Nora spoke with Clint.  When she told him that Matthew was still angry with her, Clint suggested that he could head to London to provide reinforcement.  Nora said that Jessica and Natalie needed him, but Clint said that she needed him, too; he wanted them to work things out together, as a family.  Nora insisted he was needed at home and hastily said her goodbyes, promising that she wouldn't be gone much longer.\n\n\nAfter Nora hung up, Clint put down the phone and stared at one of their wedding photos.  Turning to Nigel, he said to fuel the family jet; he was flying to London.\n\n\nAfter Nora finished her call, David led Destiny into the drawing room to face the adults.  Destiny made her case to Bo and Nora, pleading with them to let her see Matthew.  To her surprise, Bo and Nora readily agreed, and said she could give Matthew the good news about Shaun's recovery, as there was still time for Greg to help their son; they just didn't want Matthew to hate them anymore.  Bo asked Destiny to keep looking out for Matthew, and to tell him to call home if he needed them.  Bo said Neville would drive her to the Warwick Academy.\n\n\nAfter Destiny left the room, David asked Bo and Nora why they weren't go ing along.  Bo said they still had things to discuss.  Catching the hint, David leered at them: \"Don't do anything I would do!\"  Bo asked if David would take his own advice about Dorian, but David doubted it; he didn't think he and Dorian could make it work, unlike Bo and Nora.\n\n\nMeeting Destiny in the foyer, David told her he was ready to go.  Destiny asked him to stay behind, explaining that she wanted to confess her feelings to Matthew without an audience.  David applauded her courage, pleased to hear that someone was \"going for it.\"\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Nora told Bo she'd asked Clint to stay in Llanview.  She asked him if his feelings had changed overnight, but Bo said no; he was still in love with her.  \"And I'm still in love with you, Bo Buchanan,\" Nora enthused.  But she was still married to Clint, Bo reminded her, and asked what that meant.  Growing melancholy, Nora said that meant she was going back to Llanview, and he was staying in London.\n\n\nAt the Warwick Academy, T\u00e9a and Elijah were escorted into the  headmistress' office.  The headmistress explained that she had had Ross thrown off the property, and showed them a photo the security team had taken in order to identify him if he tried to return.  T\u00e9a warned her that Ross would get ugly in order to see Danielle.  The h eadmistress explained that Danielle hadn't been alerted to his presence, and would remain safe.  She left the office to retrieve Danielle.\n\n\nAlone, Elijah confronted T\u00e9a, asking her if she was ready to see her wayward daughter.  Quickly removing Todd's wedding ring, T\u00e9a told him she was.\n\n\nIn the boys' dormitory, Tom, Danielle, and Matthew were still going over their master plan.  Tom said he was set to provide the distraction they would need to escape, complete with a rotten egg stink bomb, but remained unconvinced that they could pull it off.  Danielle said the plan would work; she couldn't stay there, and she didn't want to go back to her mother, who she said barely knew her.  Just then, the headmistress burst in, having guessed correctly that Danielle would be there.  The old woman ushered Danielle out of the room for \"a serious talk about her future.\"\n\n\nAs the headmistress walked Danielle back to her office, the young girl hoped to find Ross waiting for her, but was dismayed to find T\u00e9a and Elijah.  T\u00e9a wanted a hug, but Danielle wasn't interested; she demanded Ross, her father.  She asked if Elijah was T\u00e9a's new boyfriend.  T\u00e9a said Elijah was her uncle, and explained that it was time for her to pack her things; she was moving to a new school.\n\n\nDanielle exploded at the thought of having to pack up and move once again; T\u00e9a attempted to calm her by calling her \"Daniela,\" but the teen insisted her name was \"Dani.\"  She wanted to go home, but T\u00e9a said she wasn't safe there or at Warwick.  Seeing through T\u00e9a's anxiety, Danielle realized that her mother was hiding her from Ross, and asked if he'd been there, after all.  Dashing past T\u00e9a, she discovered Ross's picture on the headmistress's desk.\n\n\nEnraged, Danielle demanded to know why T\u00e9a was keeping her from her father, and asked if it had to do with what he'd always claimed, that T\u00e9a loved someone else.  She asked if it was Elijah.  T\u00e9a attempted to shut down the discussion, ordering Danielle to pack her things immediately, but Danielle drowned T\u00e9a out. She screamed and fled the room.\n\n\nIn the boys' dorm, Matthew and Tom worried about Danielle.  Tom was convinced that the headmistress was onto them and said Danielle wouldn't be going anywhere, leaving Matthew out of luck.  Matthew was convinced Danielle would return for him.  He turned out to be right as Danielle flew back into the room, snarling that \"my mother the bitch\" wanted to take her away, but she wasn't going anywhere with anyone, except Matthew; they were leaving together.\n\n\nImpressed by Danielle's courage, Tom handed her a wad of cash and wished them luck as he left to prepare his stink bomb.  After Danielle packed her things, Matthew thanked her for returning.  Danielle told Matthew they were in it together, her to find her father, and Matthew to walk again.  As she opened the door so they could make good their escape, she found Destiny standing there.\n\n\nIn the headmistress' office, T\u00e9a wondered what was taking Danielle so long.  Elijah recommended she give her daughter space, given that she'd turned Danielle's world upside-down once again in order to keep the girl from the father she loved.  T\u00e9a shrugged him off, insisting that Danielle would adjust.  Elijah asked how well Danielle would adjust when she learned that her father wasn't Ross, but Todd.  \n\n\n",
