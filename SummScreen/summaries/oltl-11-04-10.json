    "soap_central": "\n\nIn bed, T\u00e9a asked if she was dreaming. \"I hope not,\" Todd replied. She was starting to feel like herself again. T\u00e9a brought up the fact that Todd had married her because she was dying. Since she was \"here to stay,\" she told Todd that if he wanted to reconsider being married to her, she would understand. Todd asked her if the drugs had fried her brain. Todd told her to stop thinking, but T\u00e9a wanted to know what to do instead. He had an idea, but had to show her instead of telling her. They shared a smiling kiss.\n\n\n\"Some wedding night,\" Todd said. T\u00e9a reminded him that they'd already had one, but Todd asked why they couldn't have another one. Todd wanted another wedding -- a big one. T\u00e9a was confused as to why Todd was so cheerful, but Todd informed her that he was happy. He wanted to celebrate by having a combined wedding and \"T\u00e9a's alive\" party.\n\n\nDani opened the front door of Todd's to Nate. He held a box full of flowers and cards that people had left by her locker at school. He told her there was no amount of cards that could tell her how much he had missed her. Dani and Nate agreed about how thankful they were to James for finding Starr. \"He has a sixth sense when it comes to Starr,\" Dani said. Nate told Dani that the Manning daughters were \"irresistible.\"\n\n\nDani told Nate about how her parents had a handwritten \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on their bedroom door. She was glad her mother was home, but she didn't want to think about it. Nate related that he didn't have to, since his parents had split up before he was born.\n\n\nAs Dani and Nate shared a kiss, Todd and T\u00e9a walked downstairs. Since Todd wasn't immediately mean to Nate, Dani asked if Todd was all right. Todd said he was very happy and that they were going to throw a party. Todd then told T\u00e9a and Nate to leave because he needed a minute alone with his daughter. When T\u00e9a asked why, Todd said it was none of their business.\n\n\nT\u00e9a and Nate stood outside the living room and wondered what was going on. Behind the closed doors of the living room, Todd asked Dani, \"What do you say?\" Dani wasn't sure about what Todd was asking her to do. Todd said he understood if Dani didn't want to make her mother happy. That got to Dani and she agreed, which pleased Todd.\n\n\nJohn tried to coax the baby to kick. Natalie explained that the baby didn't do anything on command, just like John. John left to take a shower, and Natalie begged for the baby to be John's.\n\n\nJess woke up in Brody's arms and asked why he wasn't already at the station. He claimed to be on bed rest with the mother of his child. Jess told him that they could finally have the paternity test that day. Brody promised that everything would be all right. His phone rang, and he answered it to Natalie. Brody acted like he was talking to someone from the station, so Natalie said she would call back. Before she hung up, she told Brody he was right about the fact that she needed to find out who the father of her baby was.\n\n\nJohn entered and asked Natalie whom she was talking to. Covering, she explained the situation with Jess and Brody to John. He said that was probably the reason why Brody had been edgy lately. Clearly alluding to herself, as well, Natalie explained that Jess's night with Ford had been a \"one-night thing,\" and a huge mistake. She hoped Jess's baby was Brody's. She asked John what he would do if he were in the same situation.\n\n\nJohn said he would \"rip Ford's head off.\" Natalie related that Brody had tried to. As John told her that Brody would see Ford's face every time he looked at the child, Natalie became glum. John asked if her sudden mood change was about Jess and Brody, or something else. As she said it was just the hormones, the baby kicked. John put his hand to her stomach, happy. He left to go to work.\n\n\nEcho was on the phone with Clint as she held the necklace. She said she needed to see him about something important. Clint claimed to be busy and hung up.\n\n\nEcho opened her door to Viki. Viki handed Echo a book, Love Letters of Rick and Lili, and walked in. Viki said she knew that Echo had copied letters out of the book to make them look like they were Rex's parents' letters. Echo didn't know what Viki was talking about, but Viki informed her that Rex had read one of the letters to her, and she had recognized it from the book. She also knew that the book had taken place in New Mexico, which was where Echo had gone after her affair with Clint.\n\n\nEcho wondered why she would want to fool someone she didn't know, but Viki related that, if she knew the answer, she wouldn't be asking. Echo wanted to know why Viki was accusing her of scheming; she ordered Viki to leave. Viki acquiesced, but warned Echo that she wouldn't let Echo hurt Rex. Echo promised that she would never hurt Rex and slammed the door behind Viki. \"We'll see,\" Viki said.\n\n\nOutside of John's room, Natalie looked at Brody's DNA results. Viki walked by, and a surprised Natalie dropped the paper. Viki bent down to get it for Natalie and asked what it was. Natalie said it was something for the police department and that she had to go. Viki asked if something was wrong, but Natalie just said she was in a hurry and left.\n\n\nAt the station, Clint watched as Inez talked to Bo. Rex appeared and asked if Clint was spying on Bo. Clint was there for Inez and said that he was tired of Rex butting into his business. Rex said he was there for Bo. Rex asked Clint if he was trying to replace Kim with Inez, then added that if Inez was smart, she should run screaming like Kim had. Clint told Rex to watch what he said because Clint could make sure that Gigi couldn't afford college. In return, Rex said he could tell Bo what Clint had done with David.\n\n\nBo told Inez he had to talk to her about James. She was proud of James for saving Starr, but asked what he'd done. Bo informed Inez of James's lies about Cole's whereabouts. He wanted Inez to talk to him. She said she would because she didn't want another son in trouble. She confided in Bo about Ford's beating. Bo continued and told her that they couldn't let it go, and that they would arrest James. She understood, thanked Bo, and left.\n\n\nBo's phone rang, and he answered it to Detective Price. He asked if the detective had any information about Cole.\n\n\nAs Inez walked away, Clint asked her if he could take her to lunch. She said she had something to take care of, and left. Rex appeared suddenly and mocked Clint by telling the \"old man\" that Inez had blown him off. Rex knocked on Bo's door and asked if Bo was busy. Already off the phone, Bo told Rex that he always had time for Rex. Rex confided that the mystery of who his parents were had resurfaced.\n\n\nClint answered his phone to Echo and told her that, if she didn't stop harassing him, he would get his number changed. She related that she knew where he lived anyway. She would keep \"hounding\" him unless he met with her. Later, Clint knocked on Echo's door. She answered, and he asked what she wanted to talk to him about. \"My son,\" she replied.\n\n\nJames entered Ford's hospital room as Ford read the front page of the paper with James's and Starr's pictures and the headline of \"Buried Alive!\" Ford was happy to see that James was all right and asked if Starr had run into James's arms. James explained that Starr loved Cole, and that he hadn't saved her just so he could have her. He didn't expect anything in return and was just glad that Starr was all right.\n\n\nJames explained to Ford how he was helping cover for Cole. Ford was upset with James, asking if he would stop trying to help Starr when he was in a jail cell right next to Cole. James was protecting a killer, but James threw it right back at Ford for protecting the person who had beaten him up. Ford said that he had deserved it, but James related it to the beatings their father had given them. Ford said it wasn't the same, but James said no one deserved to get hurt like that.\n\n\nFord told James that he would reveal who had beaten him up if James didn't say or do anything to anyone. As Ford was about to tell James, Inez walked into the room. She had talked to Ford's doctor, who said that Ford was well enough to go home that day. Inez told James that she was also worried about him, and passed on what Bo had told her. She begged him to cooperate with the cops so he wouldn't end up in jail like his father.\n\n\nAs Ford changed, James left, and Inez made the bed. Ford thanked her for talking to James about going to the cops. They were both worried about him. Inez related that she was worried about Ford and who had beaten him up. He told her to leave it alone. She left, wanting to see if she could speed up Ford's release.\n\n\nIn the motel room, Cole told Starr that the night before was the last night they were going to spend together because Cole was going to turn himself in. Upset, Starr said they could get Hope and run away from Llanview. Cole didn't want to make Starr and Hope live that way. He related that the cops would always be looking for him. \"What if the cops were surrounding the place right now?\" he asked as there was a loud knock on the door.\n\n\nStarr ordered Cole to go out the back window as the door opened. A maid entered and apologized for thinking that no one was in the room; she left. Cole asked Starr if she wanted to live her life like that, terrified every time someone was at the door. She said she did, as long as it was with him. She urged him to say yes, and they began to make love.\n\n\nLater, Starr described to Cole how their life could be in a country town and a city. Cole described how their life could be in a small town. Starr needed to take a shower, then they could get Hope and leave. She went into the bathroom and Cole's phone rang. He answered it to James, who wanted to warn Cole that he had to tell the cops the truth. He was giving Cole a head start to leave the motel.\n\n\nLater, Starr got out of the shower and talked to Cole from the bathroom about how she thought they should travel separately. When she got no response, she walked out of the bathroom to find a note in Cole's place. In the note, Cole said he knew that Starr couldn't be away from her family and that he wanted her and Hope to be happy, free, and safe. He needed to pay for his crime. He told her to watch their daughter grow up to be \"beautiful and good\" like Starr, and that he loved her. Starr began to sob.\n\n\nJess and Brody walked through the hospital. As she told him that she had a good feeling about the day, Ford walked out of his hospital room right in front of the couple.\n\n\nJohn talked to a cop about information on Cole. James entered the station and John asked if he was going to cooperate. A little later, as John was putting handcuffs on James, Cole walked in.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Robert is recovering in the hospital, he urges James to know that he could be in serious trouble for refusing to tell the cops where Cole is when he knows where to find him. He's aiding and abetting a fugitive. And he asks his brother why he would put himself though so much of a risk if he can't \"get the girl\" and accepts Starr going back to Cole. Bo warns Inez of the same. She goes to warn James. And Robert expresses appreciation to her for caring about James. Yet he won't tell anybody who assaulted him. Meanwhile, Starr is ready to go on the run with Cole. But he tells her that that is no life for her and for baby Hope. So he decides to turn himself in. Meanwhile, both Viki and Rex are suspicious of Echo and know that she knows some secret about Rex's birth. She makes it clear that she knows of Rex and tells Clint he needs to know about \"her son\".",
