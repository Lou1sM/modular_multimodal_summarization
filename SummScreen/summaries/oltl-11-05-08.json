Her happiness slowly turned to confusion when Todd's attitude seemed to change before her eyes. He began talking about what a wonderful person Marty was and how she deserved a better man than Todd. When Todd advised Marty to stop feeling what he saw written in her eyes, Marty was taken aback. She told him that she did not have the ability to turn off her feelings even if she were inclined to do so. Todd became almost desperate to push Marty away. He walked to the front door, opened it, and demanded that Marty leave. Marty was stunned. She reminded Todd that they were about to start a life together with a new baby, but it seemed to have little impact on Todd. He refused to be swayed, so Marty took matters into her own hands. She walked to the front door and deliberately closed it. She then turned to Todd and told him that she had just learned how to walk but was unable to run in heels. She also told Todd that she was in love with him. Todd's walls crumbled and he returned the declaration of love. \n\n\nAs Rex prepared to leave the hospital, Shane asked to speak to him. Gigi made herself scarce so that Rex and Shane could have some privacy. Once they were alone, Rex began apologizing to Shane for the mistakes that he had made in the past. Shane reminded Rex that he did not know he had a son. Rex accepted that he had not known about the pregnancy, but he expressed remorse for leaving Gigi without a word. Rex went on to admit that, at the time, he would not have made a good father. Rex said that he went through a selfish period when he did things that he was not proud of. Rex understood why Shane had strong feelings for Brody; he was the kind of father a son would be honored to have. As the two talked, the tension between them appeared to ease. Rex told Shane that he loved him and wanted the opportunity to be his father. Before they parted, Rex offered to take Shane for hot dogs once Rex was on his feet again. \n\n\nBrody was surprised when Gigi walked into his room. He wondered why she had bothered with the visit, given the events that had unfolded on Llantano Mountain. Gigi explained that she understood Brody had not been in his right mind at the time of Rex's shooting. She wanted Brody to know that she did not hate him nor did she hold the tragedy against him. Brody appreciated Gigi's support, but apologized for what he had put Gigi and Shane through. He understood that he could not take everything he had done to Shane and Gigi back, but he was sorry for the pain he had caused them. Gigi admitted that she had been angry with Brody because he had falsified DNA results. However, she knew that Brody had been motivated by love for Shane, nothing else. Gigi thanked Brody for all the times that he had been a source of strength and support for her over the years and promised him that she would return that kindness by not deserting him in his time of need. \n\n\nTina and Cain waited in a hotel room for David Vickers, the dog, to be delivered. Tina was relieved when Cain's accomplice, Neil Silver, arrived with her precious pooch. Her joy soon turned to anxiety when Cain told her that his partner was a jeweler whom Cain had recruited to look over the jewels before the exchange with Tina's pet was made. Tina pretended to be offended by Cain's mistrust. She snatched up a bauble and presented it to Neil for inspection. He confirmed that the ring was authentic and the gem mounted in it was about 10-carats. Tina's victory was short-lived when Cain announced that he intended for Neil to inspect each of the crown jewels to verify that they weren't paste. \n\n\nTina's temper exploded. She admitted that the jewels weren't real and then began ranting about how tired she was of being everyone's pawn. Neil and Cain listened to Tina's tirade as she walked over to her dog and made her intentions clear; she would leave with David Vickers. Before Tina could carry out her threat, she realized that David Vickers was whimpering. Stunned, she turned to Cain and asked what he had done to her darling dog. Cain professed his innocence but Tina did not believe him. She handed David Vickers to Neil as she advanced on Cain, accusing him of making her dog fat. Neil studied the dog while Tina blistered Cain's ears with another diatribe. Her outburst came to a screeching halt when Neil announced that he knew what was wrong with David Vickers. According to Neil, David Vickers was about to have puppies. Tina was confused by the news, so Cain was forced to clarify, \"David Vickers is a bitch.\" \n\n\nJared and Natalie remained trapped in the secret room with a ticking time bomb. When Natalie appeared resigned to their fate, Jared tried to give her hope, to no avail. To distract themselves from their impending doom, they began to talk about their feelings. As the lovebirds cuddled and kissed, relishing their last moments in each other's arms, they began to make love. \n\n\nIn Llanfair's kitchen, Viki tried to comfort a fussy Bree. Unfortunately, Bree seemed to sense Viki's distress, and kept crying. When Clint entered through the kitchen door, Viki decided to put their granddaughter down for a nap. Meanwhile, Clint waited until Viki returned to the kitchen. When she rejoined Clint, a few minutes later, the two talked about their missing daughters. Each expressed deep regrets for not having realized Natalie was in trouble. A call from Bo, confirming that Natalie's car had been tampered with, only added to their worry. Each felt responsible for Tess running amok for months. \n\n\nTess woke up in the cottage she had once shared with Nash. When she saw an open bottle of wine and half-filled glass, Tess worried that she was not alone. Her fears were confirmed when she heard a noise and turned to find Niki Smith standing nearby. Tess was furious when she saw Viki's alter ego. She demanded to know what Niki wanted from her and was shocked when Niki began apologizing for leaving Tess in seedy bars when she was a small child. Tess was livid at the reminder of the past atrocities that she was forced to endure. She asked Niki what kind of person would put a child in such dangerous situations as Niki did with Tess. Niki's response was to ask, \"The same kind who would kill her own sister?\" \n\n\nNiki's reminder of her own crimes did not amuse Tess. Niki refused to cower under Tess's wrath. She was determined to help Tess and suggested that they return to the cellar together. Niki wanted Tess to release Natalie and Jared so that she could put Niki in the secret room and blow her up. Tess was speechless. When Niki held out her hand to Tess, Tess briefly hesitated before she took Niki's hand. Niki promised Tess that she would not let her down.\n\n\n",
