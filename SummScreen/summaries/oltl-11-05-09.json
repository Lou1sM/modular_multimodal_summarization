She was equally surprised to see his bags packed. \"Are you going somewhere?\" she asked. As Matthew began to explain that he was \"busting out,\" Danielle urged him to hurry because they didn't have much time left to escape. Destiny advised Matthew that Shaun had awakened and she was insistent that Matthew return to Llanview so that Greg could perform Matthew's surgery.\n\n\nA disappointed Matthew realized that his parents had known about Shaun and had never told him. He also wasn't sure that Greg would be on board with performing his surgery. He advised Destiny that he already had a firm commitment from the doctor in Seattle, which was where he and Danielle were heading. After his surgery, they planned on traveling to Tahiti so that Danielle could locate her father, he continued. Just then, Tom returned to the room and asked if everyone had heard his diversionary explosion.\n\n\nDownstairs in the headmistress's office, T\u00e9a expressed her concern to Elijah about successfully getting Danielle out of the school. She was not planning on disclosing that Todd was her daughter's real father, but she was afraid she'd never see Danielle again if Ross got to the girl first. She was planning on offering Danielle several choices for her next move. T\u00e9a was also nervous, realizing that she hadn't seen all of the security that the headmistress had assured her was present.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a grew more anxious waiting for Danielle, she began to yell at the headmistress, and demanded that the woman find out what was taking her daughter so long to pack. She also wanted the security people around and alerted. Elijah reassured T\u00e9a and attempted to calm her down. When the headmistress returned, she apologetically reported that Danielle was nowhere to be found, but the headmistress was sure the girl was around somewhere. She also advised T\u00e9a to remain calm. T\u00e9a and Elijah agreed to join the search as T\u00e9a blamed herself for all that had gone wrong. She was remorseful that she had remained with Ross for so long. She asked Elijah to call in the local authorities to aid in the search.\n\n\nElijah was certain that Danielle was a runaway and not with Ross. T\u00e9a was frantic, wondering if she had lost her daughter forever.\n\n\nThe headmistress walked into Matthew's room and was surprised to see Tom, who emerged from the shower without any clothes on. He grabbed a towel. Matthew advised the woman that Danielle had stopped by to say goodbye, but he had no idea where she might be. The headmistress poked her head into the bathroom for a look and advised the boys that security was on the way. Once she was gone, Tom pulled the covers down from his bed, revealing both Danielle and Destiny.\n\n\nDanielle and Matthew needed to leave, and Matthew invited Destiny to accompany them. She refused, thinking that it would be too difficult for her to leave her family members. Matthew promised to return to Llanview wearing his new sneakers, after his surgery. Calling out that she had something important to tell him, Destiny was interrupted when Danielle insisted that they hurry. \"Good luck,\" Destiny uttered.\n\n\nOver at the Buchanan compound, Nora and Bo declared their love for each other. Nora decided that she needed to return to Llanview after she ended her discussion on the phone with Clint. She realized that she had been living in a cocoon in London, but Clint had said all of the right things and had hit her with a dose of reality. She was a married woman. \"Is it too late for us?\" Bo wondered, as they each voiced their regrets at not stopping Nora's marriage to Clint.\n\n\nThe two began to reminisce about their own wedding to each other long before, and how they thought they'd be growing old with each other. Bo still wanted that to happen, while Nora was afraid that something would happen to derail things. Assuring her that \"stuff happens,\" Bo announced that he was willing to take a chance. \"Will you leave Clint and try again with me?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"Wow,\" Bo exclaimed. He couldn't believe he had asked Nora to leave Clint. He was sure that it would tear the family apart and Clint already had a lot on his plate, with the disappearance of Jared and problems with Jessica and Natalie. Exclaiming, \"our timing sucks,\" Nora was appeased when Bo assured her that there was no right time. \"What are we doing, Red?\" he asked her. He would get along if she chose to go back to Clint, he assured her. The two agreed, though, that they couldn't imagine their lives without each other. Disclosing that Bo was all she ever wanted, Nora stated that she wouldn't fight her love any longer. She hated herself for not thinking things through before the wedding, but she planned on telling Clint she would be leaving him.\n\n\nNora realized she had no clue what she would say to Clint. She decided she was a terrible person. The couple embraced and Nora decided she would return to Llanview right away to get it over with. Bo wanted to go with her since he was worried that there would be major consequences. He vowed to keep his distance and then show up so that Clint could take his shots. He thought it was okay for them to leave Matthew in London since he was in a safe place.\n\n\nGigi arrived at Rodi's and quietly tried to locate her paycheck, hoping to avoid Schuyler, who was working nearby. Unfortunately, her plans were waylaid when she had to wait around for the check. She awkwardly advised Schuyler that she had plans to get home and watch some television with both Shane and Rex out of the house. She admitted to almost crossing the line with Schuyler, but said she couldn't allow it to be more. She was going to make arrangements to fly to Michigan to help Rex with his sick aunt, she added.\n\n\nIn Michigan, Rex passed out after drinking the tea his aunt had offered him. \"The hard part's over,\" Nadine assured Corrine as they attempted to bind Rex up in rope. As Corrine muttered that she felt bad about lying to her nephew, Nadine reminded her that they had their instructions and they needed to keep Rex away from Natalie. An unconscious Brody, tied to a chair close by, was awakening  and beginning to struggle with his own bindings. Just then, the women panicked, when the front doorbell rang. It was John.\n\n\nAnswering the door, Nadine assured John that her brother had returned to Llanview, when the detective asked to see Brody. John was confused, noting that Brody had insisted   that he'd be there. John forced his way past Nadine into the house, pretending to realize that Brody was playing a game and tricking John with his whereabouts.\n\n\nAt the vineyard in Napa, Jessica and Natalie began to argue. Jessica didn't think it was right that Rex had left, and she wanted to call John. She felt that she and Natalie were \"sitting ducks.\" Natalie disagreed, still sure that Jared was going to show up. As someone watched them through a window, Jessica gave in. She still planned on calling John, but promised just to ask about Brody; she would not divulge their location.\n\n\nAs John stood talking to Nadine, his phone began to ring. In the other room, Rex's phone also began to ring. John suggested that Nadine answer the phone, since it could be Brody, but she quickly said, \"He doesn't have that number,\" and told John to answer his own. Becoming suspicious, John answered his own call. It was Jessica, who was inquiring about Brody. John advised her that he had no information on Brody but was still actively looking for him. Jessica was evasive when John asked where she was. She hung up abruptly.\n\n\n In the other room, a struggling Corrine managed to locate Rex's phone in his pocket and answered in a whisper. It was Gigi, who indicated that she wanted to fly out to Michigan to help Rex take care of his aunt. Corrine urgently stated that she didn't need Gigi's help and did not want her to show up. She she advised Gigi  that Rex deserved some space.. Corrine disconnected the call and hung up.\n\n\nNadine attempted to get rid of John and he dared her to call the cops. As Corrine continued to struggle with an unconscious Rex, Brody was doing his best to get John's attention. Suddenly, he managed to tip his chair over and crash to the floor. Nadine assured John that it was just her huge cat. She denied knowing Corrine when John asked about her, and she had nothing but nasty things to say about Gigi. John handed her his card and advised her to let him know if she heard from Brody.\n\n\nAfter he was gone, Nadine went back to help Corrine. She was shocked to find Brody, out of his ropes, with his arms locked around Corrine. Gasping, she turned and dashed for the front door. Pulling it open, she ran into a smiling John. He pushed her back into the house.\n\n\nJessica was upset to learn that there was no news about Brody. She started to think about Bree and realized that she not only missed her daughter, but Chloe, too. It was her former baby's first birthday. She began to cry that she was a lousy mother who did horrible things, and had found herself she   chasing after Nash's ghost. She called home to speak to Bree and then advised Natalie that she would be returning to Llanview. \"Do you really think Jared's a killer?\" Natalie asked her, but Jessica did not respond.\n\n\nJust then Natalie received a text message: \" Meet me outside. Don't tell Jessica.\" She headed outside for some fresh air. A short while later, Jessica clutched her keys and went outside looking for her sister. Suddenly, Jared grabbed her and gestured to her to remain quiet.\n\n\nAdvising Schuyler that her plans had changed and that she would not be going to Michigan, Gigi also told him that she couldn't run to him every time she had a problem. Stacy arrived looking for Rex, and learned that he was away. Stacy was disappointed, as she pulled a copy of \"her\" ultrasound from her purse. She had wanted to show it to Rex. Schuyler grabbed the picture as Gigi asked if Stacy was ready for the paternity test. Stacy reminded her that it would be done after the baby's birth but it was time for Gigi to \"deal\" with the existence of the baby and learn how to share.\n\n\nAs Schuyler flashed back to the night he was tricked into bed with Stacy, Gigi admitted that Rex had never seen a sonogram before. Stacy acknowledged that she had other copies in case anything happened before Rex saw it. Once Stacy was gone, Gigi headed behind the bar and started pouring and drinking shots. \"Gigi, stop it,\" Schuyler ordered, to no avail. He thought she should talk to him, and advised her she would only feel numb after the drinking. Gigi admitted that she didn't want to feel anything, especially her feelings for Schuyler.\n\n\nA wasted Gigi headed to the jukebox to play a favorite song. As she tripped and began to fall, Schuyler caught her. She asked him to take her home.\n\n\n",
