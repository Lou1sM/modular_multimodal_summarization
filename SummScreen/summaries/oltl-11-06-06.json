    "tvmega_recap": "Antonio tries to call Nash but doesn't get an answer. Clint and Cris offer to head out there to see what is up with the man who is reported to be upset over something. When they get to Nash's place, he has a fire going, and there is beer everywhere. Antonio soon figures it out. They made a bachelor party for him, even though he said he didn't want one. They all get a beer and sit by the fire to enjoy some male bonding. There are a few moments of awkward silence and the Cris speaks. \"Are we bonding yet?\" Jessica, Viki and Natalie sit and have a few drinks. Roxy heard there was a party for the ladies and she shows up but it disappointed to hear there are going to be no strippers. They decide to have some Cosmos, but Jessica has an inkling for something with Vodka in it. \"Vodka?\" Viki comments. \"Isn't that something that Tess would drink?\" David goes to see Hugh and Paige takes that time to go and get something to eat. When alone with Hugh David starts talking to the man, apologizing for making him sign the document that he had with him. He tells that the document isn't any good anyway. He tells Hugh that he is lucky that he lived as John was in the same accident and died. Hugh has a bad reaction to the news and manages to say, \"No! No!\" David finds this very strange and just stares at the man. Adriana and Blair also attend the party with gifts and its drinks all around. Roxy's gift is so scandalous that Jessica is afraid to take it out of the box. At the bachelor party, Antonio wonders if they can get pizzas out there at that time of night. \"Well then my timing is good then.\" Todd is in the doorway with goodies in paper bags. Rex apologizes knowing that the reason that Todd is there is because he let on where the party was. David takes Hugh's rambling to mean that the man doesn't feel like himself and nothing more. He understands and promises to bring some cannolis the next time that he returns. When alone in the room again, Hugh makes a statement. \"I'm not Hugh!\" Kevin and Kelly talk and decide that the only way to have a family is to move out of Llanview. Jessica is worried about how the wedding is going to affect Natalie but Natalie says that she will be fine. \"John would want it that way!\" Lemon Drop Shots are brought to the table for Jessica but she doesn't drink them and has champagne instead. After the party is over, everyone leaves. Jessica is at the table alone. She grabs a Lemon Drop Shot and tosses it back when no one is listening. \"See Tess? I told you. This is going to be my wedding!\" At the bachelor party, all toast to 'love'. Everyone's happy but Nash over this",
