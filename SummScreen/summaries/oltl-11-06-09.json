When Jessica accused Jared of stalking her, Jared claimed that Wayne Landers had been the culprit.  Jessica attempted to escape Jared's grasp, but he pulled her closer and exclaimed, \"I can't let you do that!\"\n\n\nJared begged Jessica to allow him to explain, but Jessica was convinced that Jared had harmed Natalie.  Upon learning that both Natalie and Jessica had been lured to Napa, Jared panicked and insisted that he hadn't spoken to Natalie since leaving Llanview.   Jared was desperate to locate Natalie.  A frightened Jessica attempted to phone the police, but Jared tossed her phone away and screamed, \"If the police come anywhere near here, Natalie could die!\"   Convinced that Jared had plans to kill both her and Natalie, Jessica pushed Jared to the ground, knocking him unconscious.  Jessica raced off to find help.\n\n\nViki placed flowers at Chloe's gravesite.  While Viki sat at her granddaughter's grave, Marcie approached and revealed that she was seven months pregnant.  After relating that she and Michael were happy in Seattle, Marcie commented that she had returned to Llanview to vote for Viki and visit Chloe's grave.   Viki was pleased to learn of Marcie and Michael's good fortune and thanked her for thinking of Chloe on what would have been the child's first birthday.\n\n\nAfter updating Marcie on the past several months of Hope's life, Viki discussed the trouble that Jared faced and the strange phone calls that Jessica had received.  Viki believed that John would return  Jared home safely.  She was convinced that Jared hadn't committed a crime against her daughters.  Marcie said goodbye to Viki and related that she had one more stop to make before returning to Seattle.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, The Crammers, Mannings, and Saybrookes gathered for Hope's first birthday and to watch the election results.  Upon learning that it was a tight race, Dorian was adamant that she would prevail.  Alone with Amelia, Dorian vowed to keep her promise to legalize gay marriages once she became mayor.  Amelia thanked Dorian for helping the cause.\n\n\nLangston pleaded with Markko to reveal who he had voted for, but Markko refused.   Succumbing to pressure by Langston, Markko finally announced that he had voted for Dorian.  Langston was thrilled that her boyfriend had voted for her mother.\n\n\nAcross the room, Marty observed Blair and Todd playing with Hope.  As Todd held his granddaughter, Blair remembered the moment that T\u00e9a had admitted to giving birth to Todd's child.  Once Todd had walked away with Hope, Marty approached and questioned how Blair could keep Todd away from his child.  An angered Blair blamed T\u00e9a for keeping child's Todd a secret, but Marty reminded Blair that she could reveal the truth to Todd.\n\n\nBlair demanded that Marty mind her own business, and a heated argument ensued between the two women.   Todd interrupted the altercation and wondered what had taken place.  A horrified Blair listened as Marty announced, \"I have something to tell you, it's about your child!\"  To Blair's relief, Marty didn't reveal Blair's secret, instead, she warned Todd not to interfere in Starr and Cole's relationship.\n\n\nNearby, Cole and Starr discussed that awful night that they thought Hope had died.  Urging Starr to forget the past, Cole reminded her that they were a family.\n\n\nLater, Markko told Cole that he had lied to Langston about voting for Dorian.  Markko feared that Langston might learn the truth -- he had voted for Viki.  When Cole assured Markko that his secret was safe, Markko grew confident and proclaimed, \"It's not like my one vote would decide anything!\"  However, a look of panic crossed Markko's face when he heard a news commentator declare that the election would be a close one.\n\n\nStarr was delighted when Marcie arrived at La Boulaie.  Presenting Hope to Marcie, Starr told Marcie that she would always play a part in Hope's life.  When Todd rudely announced that he was leaving, Blair asked him to stay and watch the election returns, but Todd insisted that he didn't care about the election.   Once Todd left, Blair and Marty resumed their argument.  Marty warned Blair that Todd would never forgive her once he learned that she had withheld information regarding his child.  Blair replied, \"It doesn't matter, because he'll never find out the truth!\"\n\n\nOutside of La Boulaie, Todd placed a call to his private investigator and demanded that he find out what T\u00e9a was doing in London.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, a drunken Gigi sulked as she studied Stacy's sonogram.  Gigi begged Schuyler to drive her home.  Upon learning that Shane was at the cottage with Noelle and Moe, Schuyler related that he didn't want Shane to see his mother in such a condition and encouraged her to seek refuge inside John's office, but Gigi insisted upon going home with Schuyler.   Schuyler warned Gigi that Rex would be upset if he learned that she was with Schuyler.  Near tears, Gigi mumbled, \"He doesn't care! He has important stuff on his mind!\"\n\n\nOnce inside Schuyler's apartment, Gigi asked for more alcohol, but Schuyler refused to accommodate her.  Pulling Schuyler close, Gigi planted a kiss on him.  Unwilling to take advantage of a drunken Gigi, Schuyler pulled away.   When Gigi admitted that she was consumed with thoughts of a pregnant Stacy, Schuyler defended Rex's actions for leaving, but Gigi told him that Corrine had told her that Rex had said he needed a break from Gigi.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Michigan, a drugged Rex began to stir.   At that moment, Brody managed to untie himself from the ropes, and grabbed Corrine.  A few feet away, Nadine attempted to escape, but John prevented her from doing so.  Upon realizing that Corrine and Nadine had drugged Rex and Brody , John demanded to know what the two women were up to.\n\n\nBoth women related that an unknown male had called and instructed them to keep Rex away from Natalie, and Brody separated from Jessica.  While Nadine claimed that the man had offered her money, Corrine stated that the caller hadn't offered her money.  Instead, the caller had frightened Corrine enough to lure her favorite nephew into a trap.   Nadine revealed that half the money had been deposited into her bank account -- she was told that the remaining funds would be deposited provided that she kept Brody in Michigan for the entire week.\n\n\nBrody guessed that the mystery caller was watching Nadine's house, but John was convinced that the unidentified person had an accomplice. Pulling out photos of Jared and Nash, John asked Nadine and Corrine if they had ever seen either of the two men.  The women claimed that they hadn't encountered Jared or Nash.  Realizing that a connection existed between the sinister plot and someone pretending to be Nash, Brody was anxious to find Jessica.  At that moment, Rex regained consciousness and revealed that Jessica and Natalie were in Napa, at Nash's old vineyard.\n\n\nAfter retrieving his phone from Nadine, Brody noticed that Jessica had phoned several times but hadn't left a message.  Brody grew suspicious when he phoned Jessica and received her voicemail.  Brody related that Jessica never turned off her phone because she feared that she might miss an important call concerning Bree.   Rex explained how he, Jessica, and Natalie were lured into traveling to Napa.  Rex was stunned to learn that Natalie had never phoned John.  Anxious to explain his whereabouts to Gigi, Rex placed a call to her.\n\n\nA drunken Gigi looked at her phone and flew into a rage when she noticed that Rex hadn't phoned.  As Schuyler tried to calm her down, the phone vibrated, but Gigi didn't notice that Rex was calling.  Stating that Schuyler always provided a shoulder for her to cry on, Gigi began to remove her blouse.\n\n\nUnable to reach either Jessica or Natalie by phone, John announced that he and Brody were traveling to Napa.  As Brody exited her home, Nadine apologized for her actions, but a disappointed Brody insisted that he thought things had changed between him and his sister.\n\n\nAs the police led her away, Corrine begged Rex not to press charges.  When Rex ignored her pleas, Corrine promised to reveal the identity of his father.\n\n\nBack in Napa, as Jared regained consciousness inside the shed, Jessica tried to start the car, but the engine was dead.  Noticing a lit cabin a short distance away, Jessica ran toward the cabin.\n\n\nJared began to search for Jessica.   Hearing Jared's voice, Jessica continued to head for the lit cabin.  Upon entering the cabin, Jessica locked the door and called out for help.  As she continued to look around, Jessica noticed someone with blond hair sitting in a chair toward the back of the cabin.  Rushing toward the unknown person, Jessica asked, \"Nash, baby!  Is that you?\"\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Viki walked toward Nash's gravesite and was shocked to discover that someone had dug it  up.   Nash's grave was empty.\n\n \n\n\n",
