He had a flashback to kissing Tess and tossed a beer bottle at the wall. \"How can I let this wedding happen?\" he asked himself. Natalie came by and said she was there to make sure Nash doesn't do anything to ruin her wedding day. Vincent came by as she was leaving. Nash gave Vincent a check for the money he borrowed, plus interest. Vincent asked where Nash got the money, but Nash told him not to worry about it. Natalie ridiculed Vincent for being a shady loan shark. Vincent countered that she should think more of him now that he's confessed to setting up Cristian. When Natalie refused to cut him any slack, he told her it was a mistake for him to ever have listened to anything she had to say to him. \n\n\nOnce alone, Nash saw a vision of Tess sitting on the floor wearing black leather thigh-highs. She told him he was giving up too easy. Nash said he fought hard to get her back, but it just didn't work out. The Tess vision told Nash he has to figure out how to find her inside of Jessica. \"Go to the wedding and stop it and give us a fighting chance,\" the vision told him before vanishing.\n\n\nClint dropped by Llanfair as Jessica was getting ready for the wedding. Jessica told her father that she isn't sure Antonio knows what he's getting into marrying her because she's not \"low-maintenance.\" Clint replied that Antonio has stuck it out this far so he must know how lucky he is to have her. Later, Viki talked to Jessica about Tess. She told Jessica that she's integrated and needn't worry. Jessica pointed out how Niki spoiled one of her weddings, but Viki said she was not integrated on the day Niki came out and ruined her nups to Joe. Natalie and Adriana came in. Viki gave Jessica antique earrings as something old. Adriana pointed out that Jessica's dress was the something new, and then handed her a blue garter. Adriana said she made it herself and that she's thinking about making lingerie. Natalie gave Jessica a pearl hair clip that she said John gave to her as the something borrowed. Jessica put on her dress, but then removed the veil and the lace covering her cleavage. \"That looks better,\" she said. Although the difference was extremely subtle, Natalie responded, \"You look exactly like Tess.\" Jessica objected to the comparison, but Natalie pointed out that if she and Adriana saw the similarity, Nash would also see it. \n\n\nKevin gave Kelly a photo of Duke so Zane could have a photo of his father to inspire him. Dorian came by the hospital to see how Zane and Kelly were doing. Kelly said she's fine and that they're waiting to see how Zane does. Kevin excused himself and went to the wedding. Dorian said to Kelly that it seems she and Kevin are getting along well. Kelly said yes, that Kevin has been great in being there for her and Zane.\n\n\nKevin came by Llanfair and talked to Clint about Kelly. He said that there's too much going on in Llanview for he and Kelly to really make another go of things. Clint suggested they go to London for a fresh start. Viki walked in and Kevin and Clint told her about the plan. Viki said she's glad to see Kevin and Kelly happy even though she'd miss them if they move. Dorian barged in and said she was there for the wedding. Viki told Dorian she wasn't invited. Dorian retorted that she was there on behalf of Kelly, who was invited, but then Kelly walked in. Viki said Dorian could stay, and Clint added that it'd be no stranger than Antonio asking Nash to be there. Dorian walked into the church and sat down. Adriana saw her mother and shared a few terse words with her. She ran back to Rex, who told her to just let it go.\n\n\nCristian talked to Antonio about how nice it was that Antonio was finally marrying Jessica. Antonio told Cris that if Nash screws up his wedding that he'll \"kill him in front of everyone right then and there.\" Nash arrived at the church and said hi to Antonio, but then got flustered a bit and ran out. Meanwhile, back at Llanfair, Jessica slapped some bright red lipstick on and instructed Natalie to go ahead to the church so she could have a minute for herself. After Natalie left, Nash walked in.\n\n\nA nurse read an article about the wedding to \"Hugh\". When she got to the bridesmaids' names, the patient got worked up at the mention of Natalie's name. \"Natalie... Natalie,\" he grunted. Later, Vincent came by to talk to \"Hugh.\" He explained how he confessed to setting up Cristian because Natalie got under his skin. \"Eventually, she's got to move on,\" he said. \"Hugh\" got riled again. \"No!\" he grunted. The nurse came in to check on \"Hugh.\" Vincent was surprised when she mentioned the patient's \"nice blue eyes.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian reads the announcement of the Vega wedding in the paper and when she reads about Clint walking Jessica down the aisle, she rips out the article and rips it to shreds. She heads to the hospital and finds Kevin and Kelly there where the baby's room is. Kevin takes this time to head out to the wedding. Dorian will stay with Kelly, and the baby. Dorian notices a closeness between the two that wasn't there before. Kelly tells how Kevin has been amazing. A lot of mistakes were made in the past but Kelly made a lot of those mistakes too, and wants that all in the past now. Jessica is a body of nerves. Adriana tries to help her get ready. Jessica wonders where Natalie is and how she is doing that morning. Nash is at his house cleaning up after the bachelor party the night before. He thinks about Tess and smashes a glass at the wall. \"I have to stop this wedding!\" Natalie wakes and tells John that she will make him proud and that she will be representing the both of them at the wedding that day. She takes her ring off and puts it on the table. She goes to Nash's place where he is cleaning up and tells him that if he does anything to screw up the wedding she will light a match to the vineyard and Nash. \"Actually if you don't show up, that will be fine too.\" When she turns to leave, she trips and falls into the arms of none other than Vincent Jones. She demands to know what he is doing there. Nash promptly gives the man the money that he borrowed with interest, telling that their business dealings are over. Vincent isn't pleased and wants to know where the money to pay him off came from. Nash will not tell him that. Natalie gets in Vincent's face about this. She didn't realize how enterprising he was. He is annoyed by her being a smart-mouth and he tells her that he is beginning to think that his mistake was listening to her in the first place. He goes to Hugh and tells him how he confessed to setting Cris up and was dealt with. He says that he lost business because of his confession of his crime and that is all because of Natalie. He let her get to him one day. He knows that Natalie hurts now but that one-day she will be over John. \"No,\" Hugh whimpers. \"Something just isn't right!\" Natalie and Adriana look back and forth at each other nervously trying to understand what the problem is. Jessica rips out a piece in the bodice, creating more cleavage, and she gets rid of the veil. \"There! That's better!\" Natalie tells her that she looks exactly like Tess now. Natalie and Adriana head off ahead to the church. Nash enters the change room when Jessica is alone and they just stare at each other.",
