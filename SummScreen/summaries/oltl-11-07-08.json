Staring intently at the picture, John declared, \"Sit tight! I'm coming for you!\" \n\n\nA determined John opened numerous gun cases and examined several weapons. Dissatisfied with the caliber of weapons he had recovered, John continued to search for the right gun. Upon finding a large handgun, John appeared pleased. John loaded the weapon and left a message on Michael's voicemail. Warning Michael that the police would question him concerning John's whereabouts, John instructed Michael to tell the truth and asked him not to cover for him. John told Michael that he had some business to take care of and soon the case would be over. \n\n\nJohn phoned Blair, but received her voicemail. He inquired about Starr and apologized for being abrupt with Blair at the courthouse. John said he hoped that he got the chance to make things up to her. \n\n\nJohn armed himself with a knife and several revolvers. He left a message on Bo's voicemail. Apologizing to Bo, John insisted that he tried to work within the parameters of the law but was forced to take matters into his own hands. John placed his badge on the table and exited the room. \n\n\nAfter making love, an invigorated Marty snuggled next to Todd. He responded by giving her a passionate kiss and related that there was no place on earth he would rather be. As Marty happily reminded him that their lives would be changed once they became parents to Starr's baby, Todd appeared bothered. To Marty's surprise, Todd leaped out of bed and claimed that he needed to check on Starr. When Marty questioned why he felt the need to leave that moment, Todd stated that he didn't want anything to ruin what had taken place between them. Insisting that nothing could hurt their relationship, Marty told Todd that she loved him. Holding her hand, Todd declared his love for Marty and maintained that the business that he needed to tend to was because of her. Marty asked Todd to return to her once he had completed his business. He promised that he would, and headed off to the hospital. \n\n\nAfter Todd left, Marty wrote in her journal. Smiling to herself, Marty documented that she and Todd had declared their love for one another. Marty wrote that she was lucky to have him in her life, and so was their child. \n\n\nIn the delivery room, Starr suggested that Marcie hold the baby. When Blair asked Dr. Joplin to see the baby, Dr. Joplin and Janet exchanged nervous glances. Informing Blair, Starr, and Marcie that the baby was experiencing difficulties and needed to be rushed to the neo-natal intensive care unit, Dr. Joplin discreetly instructed Janet to take the baby to her examination room. As Blair and Marcie questioned what was wrong with the child, Starr demanded to know where Dr. Joplin was taking her baby. Convinced that her baby was healthy, Starr stated that she had heard the child cry. After the doctor advised everyone to allow her time to treat the baby, Dr. Joplin and Janet quickly exited the delivery room. Marcie approached Dr. Joplin and insisted upon escorting Dr. Joplin to the intensive care unit with the baby. Eventually, Dr. Joplin convinced Marcie to encourage Starr while Dr. Dr. Joplin cared for the baby. Marcie agreed, and Janet headed to the examination room with Starr's child. \n\n\nWhile Starr agonized over the unknown condition of her child, Blair comforted her daughter. Reassuring Starr that the baby would be fine, Blair reminded her daughter that Marcie was checking on the baby and wouldn't allow anything to happen to the child. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Marcie wandered through the halls, waiting for answers. She turned around and stood face-to-face with Todd. When Todd inquired about Starr, a nervous Marcie told him that Starr had given birth to a baby girl, but the baby had been rushed to the intensive care unit. \n\n\nAt the cottage, a frail Tess wondered why her baby wasn't crying. She slowly looked around and observed the room in shambles and a blood-stained sheet lying beside her. Suddenly, Tess appeared calm and began examining her surroundings. Moments later, Jessica surfaced with a new personality. The new alter ego wrapped the lifeless baby in a sheet. Apologizing to the dead child, Jessica's new personality stated that the baby wasn't supposed to die. She told the child that her suffering was over. The new alter ego insisted that everyone would be looking for them and that she needed to fix things. As she cleaned the cottage, Jessica's alter ego was determined to make things right. \n\n\nDressed in drab clothing that Tess would never wear, the new alter ego took off her earrings and donned a pair of horn-rimmed glasses. Appearing quite calm, the alter ego remarked, \"Jess was too fragile. Tess was too high-strung, but I'm Bess and I was made for situations like this!\" Picking up the dead child, Bess stated, \"There's no need to cry over spilt milk! I have to take away the pain, and replace it with a purpose!\" \n\n\nAt Cain's apartment, Tina and Cain made love. Afterward, they discussed their feelings for each other. As they shared a tender moment, Tina glanced over at David Vickers and \"her\" litter of puppies. Commenting on how she had saved the dog, Tina's thoughts suddenly turned to Natalie and Jared locked in the basement. Tina asked Cain to look after the dogs and rushed off to save Natalie and Jared. \n\n\nIn the basement of Llanfair, Natalie and Jared dressed after making love in the secret room. Certain that their lives were soon to end, Natalie wondered when the bomb would explode. As the bomb continued to tick, Jared pleaded with Natalie to have hope. Convinced that Tess didn't actually want to kill them, Jared reminded Natalie that Tess's main objective was to make them suffer. Jared believed that the bomb wasn't real. Natalie wanted to hope for the best, but she was doubtful. Jared insisted that Bo, Viki, or Charlie would find them before it was too late. Natalie wondered if Tina would have a heart and rescue them. As she thought about Jessica's unborn baby, Natalie continued to worry. \n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Charlie tended to Bree. Charlie was startled when Viki rushed in and told him that Tess had locked Natalie and Jared in the basement. Explaining that Tess had copied Viki's behavior, Viki told Charlie the story about her alter ego, Jean, and the time when Jean had locked Dorian in a secret room in the basement of Llanfair. Viki told Charlie that Jean had the need to create order out of chaos. When she discovered the basement door locked and then realized that Tess had changed the lock, Viki's suspicions were confirmed, and she was certain that Tess had built a secret room. \n\n\nAs Charlie tried to break the door down, Viki panicked when she realized that the tools were in the basement. Moments later, Tina appeared and Viki asked her if Tess had construction work done in the basement. Without admitting her knowledge of Tess's actions or Natalie and Jared's whereabouts, Tina offered to pick the lock. Once the door was unlocked, Viki grabbed Bree and they all flew down the basement stairs. \n\n\nOnce in the basement, Viki and Charlie had no clue where the secret room could be. When Charlie asked Viki for details about the room that Jean had built, Viki remembered that the room was hidden by a sliding panel. As Bree cried, Tina insisted that she saw scuff marks near the secret panel and suggested that Charlie search the area. Charlie slid the wall back and Viki was speechless when they discovered Natalie and Jared in the secret room. Afraid for Bree's safety, Natalie screamed for Viki to leave the house at once, but Viki couldn't hear her pleas because the Michaelmicrophone was turned off. While Viki and Charlie struggled to hear Natalie and Jared, Tina turned on the Michaelmicrophone. Viki and Charlie were stunned when Jared screamed that there was a bomb in the room. \n\n\nHanding Bree to Tina, Viki ordered her to leave Llanfair and alert Bo to send the bomb squad. Natalie and Jared begged Viki and Charlie to leave, also, but they refused to leave without their children. Warning Charlie and Viki that the bomb had been ticking for hours, Jared insisted that they leave. Charlie picked up the timer to examine how much time was remaining. When Jared and Natalie asked how much time was left, Viki placed her hand over her mouth and gasped. Holding the timer, Charlie told Jared and Natalie that they had exactly ten minutes left. \n\n\nBack at the cottage, Bess remembered the conversation that Tess had overheard between Todd and Janet, in which Todd instructed Janet to take Starr's baby to Dr. Dr. Joplin's office immediately following the delivery. In a decisive tone, Bess remarked, \"Most of the legwork was done thanks to Tess, and Uncle Todd did the rest!\" \n\n\nAs Starr continued to worry about her baby, Blair assured her that the baby was healthy. \n\n\nImpersonating Jessica, Bess phoned the hospital and asked if her cousin, Starr, had given birth to her baby. With the dead child in her arms, Bess said the bad memories that had taken place in the cottage would be replaced with good ones. Insisting that the timing couldn't be more perfect, Bess left the cottage with the dead child. \n\n\nWhile Marcie blamed herself for the situation, Todd surprised her with kind words and suggested that she check on Starr and Blair. Todd told Marcie to tell them to trust the doctor to do the right thing. He told Marcie that things would work out. Marcie entered the delivery room and told Starr and Blair that she had received a pep talk from an unexpected source - Todd. Meanwhile, Todd ran into Dr. Dr. Joplin in the hall. Smiling from ear to ear, Todd instructed her to give the child back. Claiming that he wanted to do the right thing, Todd credited someone special with helping him see the light. \n\n\nBack at Todd's home, Marty finished her last journal entry and prepared to go to bed. As she slipped into bed, she smiled as she thought about Todd returning home to her. At that very moment, John hurled himself through Marty's bedroom window. John called out to her, but Marty was in shock.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Right after Viki has been \"visited\" by her alter ego, Jean, she realizes that Tess is merely following her mother's footsteps.
