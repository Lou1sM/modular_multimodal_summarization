    "tvmega_recap": "Neela persuades Jack to hide her telling him her brother wants to force her to be a teenage bride to somebody she doesn't want to marry and ruin her life. He tells her that he has similar issues with being controlled by his family. It looks like the two of them might start a connection. Tea is spooked and afraid to find out she is pregnant by Victor and confides in Blair. Tomas admits that Todd is still a suspect in the murder, and it seems a bit fishy that he doesn't want to turn in the gun that Louie recovered if it can clear Todd. Todd finds out that maybe Louie is the only person he can trust as he admits that he believes he may very well have murdered Victor yet \"something\" made him do it. Louie shares with Todd how being a Viet Nam soldier had a similar effect on him. Jessica goes to tell Natalie what she's discovered from the \"missing\" paternity test. At first Natalie is courteous to her sister who has \"visited\" her before her wedding, but as soon as Jessica informs her that she saw a document that says Brody is not Liam's father, yet has no proof that the document even exists, Natalie furiously accuses Jessica of lying and only wanting to hurt her. Natalie wants nothing to do with Jessica ever again."
