    "soap_central": "\n\nVincent was upset that the doctor wouldn't believe him about Hugh having brown eyes, not blue like the nurse said. He began yelling about how he went to college with the guy and knew darn well the color of his eyes (how many street thug criminals went to college???). The doctor told him to calm down or leave, but Vincent would not be denied. \"You trying to tell me that a car accident is changing the color of a man's eyes?\" Vincent asked. The doctor seemed uninterested in Vincent's point and said they need to let \"Hugh\" rest. \n\n\nAntonio noticed that neither Jessica nor Nash were at the church yet. Cristian asked Antonio how his nerves were. Antonio said he was a little nervous. Cristian told Antonio that he and Jessica already got through the hard part and now have only happiness before them.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Nash asked Jessica not to marry Antonio. He told her that even though she is integrated, she is now a new person with a new heart and that she isn't ready to get married yet. He began yelling about how Antonio doesn't love the beautiful, exciting part of her that is Tess. \"You're integrated,\" he said, \"which means you're a new person, and until you and Antonio understand that, this wedding is doomed to fail before you even get to the altar.\" Jessica refused to rethink anything. Nash said he can't promise he'll keep his mouth shut when the clergyman asks if anyone objects to the marriage. Jessica walked up to Nash and went in like she was going to kiss him. Nash got all into it, but then Jessica just whispered, \"Go to hell.\" Nash shrugged and said, \"That's exactly what Tess would say,\" and then left.\n\n\nClaudia sat at the bar drinking with Blair. She commented on how they were the only two people in town not at the wedding. Blair said she wasn't going because Todd didn't want her to. After they were both good and sauced, Blair suggested they go crash the wedding. Claudia liked the idea. Claudia and Blair got to the wedding and realized that Jessica wasn't at the church yet. Claudia barged into Antonio's dressing room and asked where Nash was. Antonio noticed she was drunk and pointed out that she's blown a year of sobriety. Claudia dismissed the comment and asked Antonio if he's worried that Jessica and Nash were not there yet. He said he was not. \n\n\nA drunken Blair stumbled around the church, knocking things over. Todd noticed her and promised that if she embarrassed him in front of his niece that he would throw her out.\n\n\nDorian saw David at the church and wondered why he was there. David asked Dorian how she got invited, and Dorian explained that Viki invited her. David commented on how \"bizarro wedding\" that was.\n\n\nAntonio asked Cristian if Jessica arrived yet and got upset when Cristian said no. A moment later, Rex came in and told the boys that Jessica just pulled up to the church. Antonio gathered his composure and went out to get married.\n\n\nClint caught Nash on his way into the church. He asked what was going on between him and Jessica, and Nash just said that he should ask Jessica.\n\n\nVincent went to the church and asked Evangeline if she remembered how \"Hugh\" was acting strange. She said yes, but that she chalked it up to heavy medication. Before he could explain any more, Jaime walked down the aisle with the flowers and the ceremony started. Nash popped in just as the organist began playing \"Here Comes the Bride.\" He took his place at the altar and Antonio asked, \"What the hell is going on?\" Before Nash could say anything, Jessica appeared with Clint, set to walk down the aisle. Clint asked her if she was ready. She did not answer him. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "\"What are you doing there?\" Nash ignores her question and simply tells Jessica not to marry Antonio. She gets angry. She knows what this is about and she hates this because she never led him on. He tells her that she is a new person and she has a new heart and she is ignoring that. He just wants her to listen to it. Antonio is nervous. \"Is she hear yet?\" Clint and Kevin have come in and they know that time is running out but instead of saying 'no', they simply say that Jessica is on her way. Rex worries about Natalie and where she could be. He is relieved to see that she is holding up well. Everyone is getting concerned about Jessica not showing up and no one has seen them. Claudia and Blair are at the bar getting sauced and they share their problems with men. \"Hey you want to go crash a wedding?\" a drunken Blair suggests. Claudia loves that idea. They head out. The bridesmaids are talking about Jessica not showing up yet and Adriana thinks that this might have something to do with Nash not being around either. \"They let him get to her?\" The drunkards have arrived and they stare at the bridesmaids who stare right back. Claudia heads to Antonio upset that he managed to let Nash and Jessica get together. Antonio isn't worried about that. In fact he is more worried about her having given up her sobriety after being on the wagon for so long. Blair is at the back of the church and she spills everything out of her purse onto the floor. Everyone stares at her as she picks up her change, etc in a very unladylike manner. \"If you embarrass me or my niece today Blair, I will throw you out of here myself.\" Todd is standing over her and he isn't pleased. She takes a seat at the back of the church all alone. Nash does his best to make Jessica see that she shouldn't marry Antonio that day. She doesn't want to be a cop's wife and he knows it. She says that he doesn't know everything that he thinks that he does about she, about Antonio She tells him to go to hell. Vincent shows up to the wedding and asks Evangeline to come and talk to him for a minute. She leaves Cris and Vincent starts the conversation about how they couldn't understand why Hugh would get agitated at different times when they were visiting. He doesn't get to finish what he is saying as the wedding is about to start. The Flower Girl and bridesmaids do the walk and then it is time for the bride to come up, but when the door opens, Nash is there. The crowd grumbles. He rushes to his place at the front. The music starts again, and this time when the door opens, Clint is there with Jessica. \"Are you okay with this honey?\"",
