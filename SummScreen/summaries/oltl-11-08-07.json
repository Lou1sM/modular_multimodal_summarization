He also suggests that his brother do something besides work. Cris mentions that he stopped painting when Sarah was around and proceeds to complain about her a little too much. An amused Antonio asks if he misses her and urges his brother to go for it when he admits to it. It's too late, he's already turned her down, Cris confesses. He just wasn't ready yet but she's seeing Jared now. Who he doesn't like by the way, he continues. And he's a good judge of character. Antonio begins to wonder if Jared might be a threat to Jess but Cris easily convinces him that she's no longer his worry. He turns the tables and asks Antonio about his own love life which causes the cop to leave abruptly. Before leaving, Antonio urges Cris to tell Sarah how he feels; Cris leaves her an awkward phone message to give him a call.\n\n\nIn Texas, the family begins to head down to breakfast. Jared finds Nat's bedroom door ajar and hearing noises, walks in. She's in bed with Chuck and he's quickly angered. He and the couple exchange insults. Once he heads out, slamming the door, Chuck asks Nat for the real story, as she thanks him for doing her this favor. She wants Jared put in his place, Nat tells him, since he claims to know what she thinks and wants. Chuck offers to help out any time. A missing Sarah shows up, having taken a walk around the grounds. Jared finally shows up too, as does Nat with Chuck, gushing about her best night ever. The comments are full of double meaning which has Clint's head spinning. He wonders what's going on, while Jess and Nash have a good idea. Chuck offers to take Nat riding and Jared asks Sarah to head outside. Unfortunately, Matthew and Renee invite themselves along. Later, Beaver Calhoun, Asa's attorney, arrives for the reading of the will. He mentions that Asa had a different way of looking at things. He tells Chuck that there's something in the will for him and family members in London are getting a reading as well. \n\n\nEveryone in Louisiana has a great night's sleep but things are happening. Marcie needs to leave to protect Celia and Wendell, who try to give her some money. She refuses it and gives Celia a bracelet that Michael gave to her. They have the name and address of another person who will help her. Todd thinks it's a good day to find his son and Marty and John are not sorry that they spent the night together. Blair notices that Marty apparently had a really good night. John learns that the house where Marcie might have been staying was destroyed in the hurricane. He also finds out that his car is ready and insists on picking it up rather than having it delivered, after he hears Celia call to her dog, \"Lady.\" He recalls Wendall stating that the dog's name was Penny. Lee Ramsey shows up looking for Marcie and threatens Wendall with jail. When John arrives to get his car, his knock is answered by Lee. \"Too late, John,\" he says. \n\n\nBo pays a visit to Lindsay, with a huge bouquet of flowers in hand. It means a lot to her that he's there. She learns, after a phone call from Matthew, that the rest of the family is in Texas for the reading of Asa's will. After Lindsay is pretty persistent, Bo admits that he just didn't want to be there, having had issues with Asa before his death. He didn't want to be jerked around for a last time, he says. Plus the last time he left, Lindsay ended up at St. Anne's. She really hopes he didn't stay in Llanview for her. He is where he wants to be, he responds. She requests that Matthew visit her when he gets home, if he's not upset by it. She's feeling lonely there; Bo promises to come back again soon. She tells him what a good man he is. \n\n\n",
