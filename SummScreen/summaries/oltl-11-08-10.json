    "soap_central": "\n\nDani walked into her parents' bedroom as they lay naked in bed, and she ran out screaming. She wanted to know what had happened to their \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, and she complained that she had been scarred for life. Once T\u00e9a and Todd were dressed, Dani returned. She had their party invitations and an envelope from Echo.\n\n\nT\u00e9a opened the large envelope and found photos of the family taken at the hospital after the explosion. Todd and T\u00e9a gushed over how lovely the photos were, while Dani thought the couple had done enough of that for one day. T\u00e9a considered postponing their party because of Cole and Starr, but Todd argued that they'd never celebrate if they waited for everyone to be available. T\u00e9a thought she should go to the police station with an offer to help Cole. The couple was ready to hand out their invitations, and they invited Dani to accompany them. Dani was still ill over the scene she had walked in on in the bedroom, and she vowed that she would never forget it.\n\n\nThe Cramer women congregated at La Boulaie. They were all in agreement that Eli's death at Cole's hand was a good thing, and they wanted to support Starr in her time of need. Dorian announced that it was time for an official family meeting, and she wanted to talk about Langston, who appeared to be spending time with Robert Ford again. Kelly and Blair began to give Langston a hard time, but Langston stood her ground. She informed them that Bobby had been coughing up blood, and she had seen it as her duty to get him to the hospital. Dorian replied that Langston had stayed there with him entirely too long.\n\n\nLangston asked if they would have just wanted her to kick him out at the curb. \"Yeah,\" Blair and Kelly chimed in. Langston informed them that Bobby had been beaten up, though Kelly asked whether a jealous husband had committed the act. Langston tried to convince her family members that Bobby had been trying to change, but everyone gave her a difficult time. Langston pointed out that none of them were \"love experts,\" as she reminded them all of their most recent love lives. She advised Kelly that the man Kelly had her set her sights on was taken.\n\n\nKelly exclaimed that there was nothing going on between her and Rex. An astonished Langston noted that she had been talking about Todd. It was time for Dorian and the others to turn on Kelly, but Kelly didn't want to discuss anything. She claimed that her remark had been a \"slip of the tongue.\" Dorian advised her that there was no such thing as an accidental remark.\n\n\nThe Ford brothers were speechless when they saw their father standing at their front door. Eddie told them they were a \"sight for sore eyes,\" and he declared that he had arrived in peace. He thought there was a lot to catch up on. Bobby advised Eddie that he wasn't welcome, and while Eddie understood, he walked into the apartment anyway.\n\n\nJames wondered why Eddie wasn't in jail, and Eddie explained that the charges against him had been dropped. He exclaimed that the American justice system was a great thing, especially when one knew their way around it. Bobby wondered what Eddie wanted, as he continued to tell his father to leave. Eddie remarked that James knew why his dad had appeared. \"What part of 'get the hell out of here' don't you understand?\" Bobby yelled.\n\n\nEddie reminded his son that he was trying to be nice, and he couldn't allow Bobby to talk to him like that. Bobby noted that James didn't have to listen to Eddie any longer, and he was annoyed when Eddie referred to James as \"buddy boy.\" Eddie pointed out that he had never liked the name either, but James's mother had given it to him. He jabbed Bobby with his elbow, and Bobby began to cough as he grabbed his side.\n\n\nEddie demanded that James return his money, though Bobby quickly informed him that the money had been spent on hospital bills. Eddie was certain that wasn't his problem, and he continued to demand his money. He criticized Bobby for leaving James at home when he had set out for fame and fortune in Hollywood. Bobby continued to order his father out of the apartment. Suddenly, Eddie pushed Bobby, and Bobby began to cough, and he grabbed his side again. Momentarily sympathetic, Eddie realized that his son was hurt.\n\n\nEddie turned back to James. He tried to remind his son of all the nice things he had done for James, and yet James had taken his money. James recalled the beatings and threats, but Eddie noted that there had been ball games and fishing trips. James didn't remember any fishing trips. Eddie agreed that there hadn't been any fishing trips, but he'd had his hands full when \"that bitch of a mother\" had walked out. James quickly assured his father that he and Bobby had heard the other side of the story.\n\n\nEddie recollected that Inez had always been a liar, and he asked why James was protecting her. \"Stay the hell away from her,\" James yelled. Eddie grabbed him and threatened, \"I need you to watch your mouth with me or else.\" Bobby suggested that his father be a \"tough guy\" on his own \"turf.\" James lived with Bobby, and Bobby looked out for James.\n\n\nEddie noted that people would be looking for James and the money, and his son could be in trouble for grand larceny. Just because Eddie was free, didn't meant that James would be. \"You wouldn't do that,\" James stated. \"Yes I would. In a heartbeat,\" Eddie replied. He wanted an \"attitude adjustment,\" and he planned on staying. He went out into the hallway to grab his bags.\n\n\nInez found Bo and Nora inside of Bo's office and handed them a plate of home-baked cookies. They were for Bo, who had given James some advice when he was in trouble, Inez explained. Nora was less than thrilled, but she kept a smile on her face. Inez chattered on, informing the couple that her son was going to college and would be able to do something with his life, especially since his father wasn't around. Bo had given James guidance, something he had never received from his own father, she added.\n\n\nAs Nora and Bo munched on cookies, the Manning family arrived. Nora and T\u00e9a hugged each other as Todd silently watched Inez brush crumbs from the front of Bo's shirt. T\u00e9a asked about Cole's case because she wanted to represent him, and Nora couldn't believe that T\u00e9a would want to get back to work so quickly. Todd pointed out that it was difficult to argue with someone who had returned from the dead. Inez was happy to see Dani, and Bo introduced T\u00e9a to Inez. The women began to speak to each other in Spanish, and even Todd chimed in with a \"por favor.\"\n\n\nTodd announced that they were having a delayed \"wedding reception slash welcome back to the land of the living\" party, and they had an invitation for the Buchanans. \"What the hell happened to you in that tunnel?\" Bo asked Todd who was smiling and joking along with everyone else. Todd thought he would try to keep it up. T\u00e9a also invited Inez and handed her an invitation. T\u00e9a hoped that Nora would take it easy until T\u00e9a could get back up to speed in the courtroom. Todd pulled Nora aside and said, \"Bo's assistant really knows her way around a desk.\" He told her to make sure that Inez had a date for the party.\n\n\nAfter the Mannings left, Inez stated that she had only been invited because she'd been standing there, and T\u00e9a had been polite. She wouldn't know anyone at the party anyway, she added. Bo wondered how long it'd been since Inez had been at a party. He told her that she'd be with Nora and Bo. Nora suggested that Inez find a date, and she thought that Clint might fit the bill. Bo wondered if Nora were playing matchmaker. Bo and Nora practiced their dancing in Bo's office as Inez watched them through the office window.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki and Charlie continued their discussion about Rex and Echo. Viki thought that the timing fit for Echo to be Rex's mother, since Echo had the necklace. She was particularly curious at Echo's comment that she would never hurt Rex, especially since Echo didn't know the young man. In fact, Rex had broken into Echo's room, Viki recalled. Charlie thought Viki was stretching, and he asked his wife who she thought the father might be. Viki thought that it was Clint, but she couldn't imagine why Echo had never told Clint the truth. Echo could have blackmailed him for lots of money, she pondered.\n\n\nViki suddenly remembered that Echo had been looking for Charlie when she first arrived in town. \"What are you saying?\" Charlie asked her. Vigorously, the couple discussed the possibility that it might be Charlie who was Rex's father. Charlie wondered why Viki was so persistent, but Viki pointed out that Charlie had spent a lot of his drinking time with Echo. It was also the same period of time when Rex had been born. Suddenly, Viki asked exactly how much time Charlie had spent with Echo. She wondered what the odds were that Rex could be his son, and she asked how often Charlie had slept with Echo.\n\n\nCharlie began to say that Echo had been \"pretty hot,\" at the time, though Viki cut his description short. She didn't want to hear about the drunken sex. Just then, the Mannings walked through the front door. \"Don't keep us in suspense,\" Todd told his sister. He began to tease her, and T\u00e9a apologized for showing up so abruptly. Viki was thrilled to see T\u00e9a and hugged her sister-in-law. Dani handed Viki an invitation, as T\u00e9a explained that it was a delayed wedding reception. The family wanted to share their love and happiness.\n\n\nTodd informed his sister that T\u00e9a planned to take Cole's case, though T\u00e9a agreed that the party had bad timing. Viki thought that the happiness was doing wonders for Todd. \"Don't lose it,\" she urged him. Todd thought that Viki might want to take her own advice, because he would hate to see her and Charlie split up. The Mannings left, and Viki and Charlie resumed their conversation. Viki had known that Echo would be a sore subject between them.\n\n\nCharlie denied Viki's charge and made it clear that they were just having an argument. He wanted Viki to walk away, but Viki thought that Charlie should find out if he were Rex's father. Charlie admitted that he was still in pain from losing his son, and he would be grateful to have another chance. He didn't want to get his hopes up.\n\n\nIn Echo's Angel Square hotel room, Clint declared that he had done all he could to prevent Rex from finding out that Clint was his father. Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, and Rex called out. Clint demanded that Echo ignore him, but she opened the door. \"You guys reliving old times?\" Rex asked as he entered the room. Echo quickly assured Rex that it wasn't what it looked like. Rex replied that he was certain that Echo could do better than Clint. Rex informed Echo that he felt as if he'd been played, because he thought that Echo had all the answers he'd been looking for.\n\n\nRex wanted Clint to leave, but Clint refused. Rex turned to Echo and began to ask her questions about his father and the necklace. Clint jumped in and gruffly advised Rex that Echo had already told him everything she knew. He ordered Rex to leave, but Rex asked about his parents. Rex declared that he had a right to know, and Echo agreed with him. Clint reminded the others that Rex had broken into Echo's room. Just then, the Mannings arrived, and T\u00e9a thanked Echo for the photos and handed her an invitation. She asked Echo to take photos at the party.\n\n\nEcho made a big deal out of checking her calendar, and she murmured that she usually didn't even get out of bed for less than ten thousand dollars. Todd joked that he had that amount in his pocket, and Echo agreed to take the photographs. Echo pointed out that Rex deserved an invitation, since he was the one who had exposed Eli. T\u00e9a agreed, and she handed one to Rex before she departed with her family.\n\n\nRex wondered why Echo had done that, and she explained that she'd have a chance to talk to him undisturbed at the party. She'd take a break, and she would look for Rex, she confirmed. Rex repeated that he wanted answers. He left, and Clint inquired why Echo hadn't told Rex the truth at that moment. She maintained that she had noticed \"bad blood\" between Clint and Rex, and she was afraid that Rex would go after Clint after Rex learned the truth.\n\n\nClint knew that nothing good would develop, and he wanted Echo to keep quiet. Echo couldn't understand why Clint hated his own son. Clint clarified that Rex was a \"gold-digging piece of trash,\" and Rex was just like his mother. Echo declared that she would attend the party, and she would say whatever she wanted to say. Clint couldn't do a \"damn thing\" about it, she advised him. Just then, Clint received a phone call from Inez, who invited Clint to the party. He accepted. He warned Echo that he'd be watching her.\n\n\nThe next stop for the Mannings was the Ford residence. James introduced his father as a friend, and Todd maintained that \"a friend of yours is a friend of mine.\" James asked about Starr, and Todd assured him that she would get better in time. James received his invitation, and the Mannings headed out. Eddie wondered if James were ashamed of him, since he noticed that there were fancy friends and parties in James's life. \"I'm your father,\" he yelled. He thought he might be able to get used to his new surroundings.\n\n\nViki thought that Charlie should pursue the truth about Rex. Just then, Rex walked in. He announced that he had gone to see Echo. Viki told the young man that there was something he needed to know. She handed him the book of love letters, and Rex was crushed. He wondered who his parents were, as Viki and Charlie looked at each other. Rex informed them that Echo would be taking photos at the party, and he planned on obtaining the truth from her if it were the last thing he ever did.\n\n\nKelly told everyone to \"chill out,\" because the last thing she had was a crush on Todd. Just then, the Mannings arrived, and the Cramers were thrilled to see them. Dani handed them the invitation, and she told them all to \"bring dates.\" Later, the women sat around bemoaning the fact that they had to look for escorts. Langston pointed out that she was the only one in the family who even had a chance of finding a date. Dorian quickly told her daughter to forget it, and she adjourned the meeting. Dorian assured her girls that they didn't need any men to be happy.\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a returned home. They had each noticed that no one else seemed as happy as they were.\n\n\nA montage showed everyone looking at their invitations thoughtfully. Bo and Nora continued to dance, and Echo picked up her necklace. Rex left Llanfair.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd, Tea and Dani are inviting everybody they know to their celebration party. Todd is happy and wants everybody to attend the reception that he and Tea never got to have. Viki admits to Charlie that she is very suspicious of Echo and the scam she is pulling with Rex. She realizes although the thought of it is not something she wants, that evidence appears that Echo is Rex's bio mom. She knows it's possible that Clint could be Rex's dad. Yet, it's also possible that Charlie could be. She tells Charlie that he needs to find out. But he admits that losing his son after being reunited after all these years has devastated him. And he doesn't want to go through with getting his hopes up that Rex could be his son, only to find out he is not. Clint confirms to Echo that he knows he's Rex's biological father but has spent Rex's entire making sure Rex and the rest of the world never finds out since he's disgraced that he got a gold digging piece of trash like her pregnant with a gold digging piece of trash like Rex. Rex goes to confront Echo while Clint is talking to her. He still has no clue that they are his biological parents as they do not dare tell him. But Clint seems to \"defend\" Echo to her \"son\" and tells Rex he needs to stop harassing the lady or he will escort him out of her home. Blair, Kelly and Dorian are ready to attend Todd's party but know none of them have dates. yet they \"suspect\" that Langston might consider bringing Robert Ford as her date, since they are getting along better. Langston protests that she had to do something after Robert got assaulted, although to this day, nobody has a clue who had him assaulted. Right then, out of the blue, Robert and James' long lost father comes to see them. They are surprised that he's out of prison. He reminds them that James owes him 50 grand. Everybody is very worried that Cole will be charged with murder and don't' want it to happen knowing that he rid the world of Elijah Clark and had good reason to do what he did when he believed that Elijah murdered Starr and Hope.",
