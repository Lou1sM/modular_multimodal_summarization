Vimal and Rama try to find her and get a call from Vimal and Neela's father who wonders why his daughter has not returned and why he can't talk to her. Rama goes to find her and she reveals that she has met a boy she really likes named Jack Manning. Rama remembers who Jack is and is concerned. Jack is still hell bent on making Todd pay for taking his father's company and his life and for getting away with murder. Tomas also wants to find out if Todd killed Victor and seems a bit biased to believe he did so that Tomas can have a future with Blair. Tea reveals to Viki that she is pregnant by Victor. Viki is delighted. Clint finds out that Viki has secretly gotten Tea to petition the court to let Clint attend Natalie's wedding and that she's worried she's gotten his hopes up for nothing when Tea tells her the request was denied."
