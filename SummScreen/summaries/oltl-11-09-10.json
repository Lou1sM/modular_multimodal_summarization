Rex revealed that his parents were not Rick and Lili as they had believed, and he was attempting to obtain more information from Echo.\n\n\nCristian surprised Layla, who was thrilled to see her fianc\u00e9. Layla and Cristian admitted that they hated being apart from each other. Adriana was there, too, and she made a phone call to Kelly to tell her about the new lover she had. It was the same man that Kelly and David had found Adriana with the last time they'd been in Paris. Once finished with her phone call, Adriana wandered over to Layla and Cristian. She praised Layla's work, but then she spotted Gigi, and she walked over to Gigi's table. She proceeded to order Gigi's food in French, and she suggested that Gigi might want to eat and dress like a Parisian.\n\n\nAdriana sat down with Gigi, and she bragged that it was thanks to her that Gigi and Rex were back together. They'd had a \"moment\" when she had returned to Llanview the last time, she related. Gigi wanted clarity on the \"moment,\" and Adriana admitted that she and Rex had shared a little kiss. She'd told Rex to fight for Gigi, but she didn't understand the \"celibacy\" issue that was occurring in Rex and Gigi's relationship. She started to talk about how great Rex was in bed. Gigi was appalled, and she wondered how Adriana knew. Rex had told her all about it, Adriana revealed.\n\n\nGigi was in shock, but Adriana maintained that she was friends with Rex. They talked all of the time, or corresponded by email, Adriana revealed. Adriana received a business call, and the women's conversation ended. Adriana made her way over to Cristian and Layla, who were busy making plans to spend time together. Adriana was sorry, but the couple would have to end their reunion. She and Layla had to get back to work.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Kelly was surprised when Dorian walked into the house with a muscular man. Dorian introduced Wyatt as Kelly's new friend, one who would provide a massage and otherwise help her to \"de-stress.\" Dorian referred to Wyatt as a \"bodyworker.\"  He also happened to be single, Dorian added, and he would \"wipe\" Rex out of Kelly's head.\n\n\nKelly pulled Dorian into another room and tore into her. She wanted to know \"what the hell\" Dorian was doing. Dorian accused her of \"sniffing\" around Rex, and she didn't like it. Kelly denied the accusation and stressed that she and Rex had a purely professional relationship. Dorian also noted that Kelly had an attraction to Todd, and Kelly had been repeatedly attracted to \"bounders.\" The women called each other out on not being able to get a date, even though Kelly pointed out that Dorian had recently stated that men weren't necessary.\n\n\nDorian advised Kelly that Kelly's \"chakras\" were blocked, and she needed Wyatt's help to release her from her years of a loveless relationship with Kevin, and a terrible second relationship with the Englishman. \"Pearls to swine,\" Dorian muttered. Kelly agreed with her aunt, but she was mortified in the next few seconds. Dorian wondered how long it'd been since Kelly had sex. Dorian thought it had probably been \"eons ago.\" She urged Kelly to take Wyatt to the Mannings' party. Kelly was horrified and couldn't consider taking a \"rented date.\"\n\n\nDorian called out to Wyatt and suggested that Blair might want to use his services instead, and she would check upstairs with her niece. Kelly insisted that she didn't need or want a massage. Wyatt thought that Kelly could get any guy she wanted, and he leaned over to gently massage her shoulders. Kelly was putty in his hands, and she succumbed to the massage. After a while, she consented to a full body massage, but midway through, she dashed from the massage table. She assured Wyatt that he was \"very talented.\"\n\n\nNora and T\u00e9a joked that they were actually happy to see each other when they met in the courtroom prior to Cole's hearing. T\u00e9a was thrilled to be able to take over Cole's case, and she planned to try every trick she could think of to get him off. Cole had done her a favor when he killed Eli, and the least she could do was to help him in return, T\u00e9a stated. Starr assured Cole that she didn't think he'd get any jail time, and she thought that T\u00e9a's remark indicated that Cole would be going home. T\u00e9a quickly clarified that she hadn't said that.\n\n\nJohn arrived, and Marty followed shortly after. Marty was snippy towards John, and she asked him where Natalie was with her evidence. John replied that Natalie was ill, and Marty recalled that she had seen Natalie at the hospital. Natalie had been at the hospital to pick up vitamins, John informed Marty. \"Oh, is that what she told you?\" Marty asked gruffly. John was confused, but Marty made it clear that vitamins were not the reason that Natalie had been at the hospital. \"How do you know so much about it?\" John inquired. Just then, the courtroom was called to order.\n\n\nCole pleaded guilty, though T\u00e9a stood and asked for a \"motion to dismiss.\" She called Cole's act a moment of passion, one that had occurred after he thought his daughter and the mother of his daughter had been killed after being kidnapped. The perpetrator had been a known multiple murderer, T\u00e9a continued. She cited the fact that even the district attorney and the lead detective in the case agreed that Cole had gotten rid of a \"scourge\" on society. The judge reminded T\u00e9a that he had Cole's guilty plea, along with his confession, and the evidence that Natalie had presented.\n\n\nThe judge didn't want to hear anything else that T\u00e9a or Nora had to say in Cole's defense. He noted that it was Cole's third felony offense, even though Nora added that Cole wasn't a threat to society. She stated that Eli had been the actual threat. She wanted the judge to try to put himself in Cole's shoes, and the judge agreed to consider everything, though he was against vigilante justice.\n\n\nAfter the judge left to ponder his decision, Marty advised John that he seemed distracted and more concerned with Natalie than the hearing. John informed Marty that Natalie hadn't had an appointment at the hospital. Marty didn't understand why Natalie hadn't mentioned her visit to the hospital, but Marty had seen her there. John demanded to understand why Marty was playing games, though he knew she was angry at Natalie. Someone else would have presented the evidence if Natalie hadn't, he advised Marty. The judge returned with his ruling, but Marty quickly suggested that John call his girlfriend and ask her about her hospital visit.\n\n\nThe judge announced that he had taken everything into account, but under the circumstances, he couldn't condone what Cole had done. Eli had been in custody and handcuffed when Cole shot him. Proceeding, he stated that Cole had already had two felony offenses, and one of those had also been \"in the heat of the moment\" when he'd attacked Todd for assaulting Cole's mother. T\u00e9a jumped up to comment on the fact that Eli had actually committed the crime. The judge reminded her that Eli wasn't on trial. He continued that Cole had a history of violence, and while he wasn't giving him a suspended sentence, he would give him the minimum of ten years in Statesville Prison.\n\n\nThe judge gave Cole some time to get his affairs together, and T\u00e9a promised her client that she'd file an appeal. Nora was sorry, and Marty blamed John and Natalie for her son's fate. She informed John that Natalie had an amniocentesis to test the baby's DNA, and he should see how she was feeling. John didn't try to hide his shock.\n\n\nNatalie and Jessica spent the day watching movies, as Jessica recuperated from her amniocentesis. She believed that Natalie had taken the day off out of sympathy and was just keeping her company. Jessica was nervous about the results of her paternity test, and so was Natalie. Jessica wondered why Natalie was reading over the post-test instructions, and Natalie quickly advised her that it was to keep her informed on how to take care of Jessica. Natalie admitted that she hadn't minded taking a \"mental health\" day, especially in the wake of Cole's hearing.\n\n\nNatalie confessed that Marty had held Natalie responsible for Cole's arrest, and Marty had vowed to get back at Natalie in some way. Jessica thought it was possible that Marty was angry from things that had happened in the past, but Natalie agreed that while that was true, it was also about Eli's murder. The sisters agreed that Natalie had only been doing her job when she handed in the evidence results. Natalie revealed that Marty had slapped her, and Jessica was shocked. She assured Natalie that Marty would never stoop to revenge, and she didn't think her sister should worry.\n\n\nJessica was sure that Marty would realize that Natalie was only doing her job. Marty just wasn't thinking clearly due to Cole's predicament. Jessica didn't understand how Marty would expect Natalie to lie to everyone. Natalie was ready for another movie, but Jessica declined. She wanted to take a nap, since the only time she didn't think about the paternity test was when she was unconscious. She was worried what would happen if Ford, not Brody, turned out to be the baby's father.\n\n\nJessica felt special giving Brody his first child, and she knew that Natalie felt the same about John's baby. The sisters hugged each other. Jessica thought Natalie was the best sister.\n\n\nBrody sat in the steam room at Serenity Springs and held his head in his hands as he worried about the paternity test results. Rex joined him and revealed that Natalie had disclosed the mess about the baby. Brody was stunned. \"What do you know?\" he asked. Rex stated that he was aware that Ford might be the father of Jessica's baby. Brody heaved a sigh of relief and explained that he was trying to get his mind off of the test results, but he was worried about it.\n\n\nHe asked how Rex and Gigi were getting along, and Rex replied that things were slow. \"Painfully, painfully slow,\" he added. They were both afraid of forging ahead in their relationships, but Rex admitted it was killing him. Brody couldn't believe that Gigi and Rex hadn't had any sex, though Rex was quick to admit that there had been a lot going on in their lives. They hadn't trusted each other when they'd first gotten back together. They had also each slept with others when they'd been apart. Rex remarked that sleeping with his girlfriend's sister had been the \"eighth deadly sin,\" and he still couldn't believe he'd done it.\n\n\nHe and Gigi were busy having dates and fun, Rex explained. They didn't want to mess things up, but the lack of sex had affected his brain. Brody asked how long it had been since Rex had gone without. Rex went on and on about how Stacy had been the biggest mistake of his life. His second had been not using protection when he'd slept with Stacy. He figured that Brody knew about that due to the possibility of Ford being the father of Jessica's baby. Rex realized that the men didn't have the same problems, but he was certain that he and Brody would get through it all with their girlfriends. Brody departed.\n\n\nRex received a phone call from an angry Gigi. \"Did you tell Adriana that we haven't had sex yet?\" she yelled at him. Rex stuttered and took his time answering her question. \"Did you or didn't you?\" Gigi demanded. Rex denied it, and then said it had been a misunderstanding. He might have mentioned it. Gigi wondered why Rex had been talking to his ex-wife. Rex tried to explain that they were friends, and Adriana had encouraged him to get back together with Gigi. Adriana had asked about the sex in a \"good way,\" he stuttered. An irate Gigi ended the call abruptly, but Rex was distracted when Kelly entered the steam room.\n\n\nBrody returned to Llanfair and saw Natalie, who explained that Jessica believed that Natalie was just being nice and keeping her company for the day. Natalie thought of herself as just a \"miserable liar who should curl up in a ball of shame and die.\" Just then, John arrived. He had a question for Natalie. \"Did you have an amniocentesis?\" he asked his girlfriend.\n\n\n\"I tried,\" Wyatt told Dorian as he prepared to leave the house. Dorian suggested that he work on her instead, because she had lower back problems. They headed upstairs.\n\n\nNora and T\u00e9a tried to reassure a crying Marty, who told herself that she had to be strong for her son. They had to say goodbye. T\u00e9a promised that she would get Cole out of prison on appeal.\n\n\nStarr and Cole arrived at La Boulaie so that Cole could say goodbye to Hope. He had something else to talk about, he said. \"Starr, I'm breaking up with you.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cole's trial is underway with everybody wanting to prevent him from getting sent up the river for shooting Eli but knowing the reality that nobody can help him. Tea represents him and Nora does not argue much, that Mr. Thornhart had reason to believe that Mr. Clark kept Mr. Thornhart's infant daughter and her mother captive and blew them up in a building. The judge takes that into consideration but tells them that he has to uphold that this is Cole's 3rd felony. He's been let off the hook, put on parole and probation before, yet has not reformed himself. So he has to rule that he goes to prison. Yet, he tells the court, he will offer the lightest sentence he's allowed to give him which is 10 years in Statesville. Everybody is distraught with that outcome. When Starr and Cole returns to Dorian's, he announces to her that he is breaking up with her. Dorian is \"afraid\" of Kelly being interested in both Rex and Todd, both of whom Dorian does not want any Cramer woman interested in. So she invites a hot man who is a massage therapist to meet Kelly. Yet Kelly is not interested in what Dorian wants from her. Meanwhile, Gigi goes to Paris with Cristian. Adriana knows how to make Gigi feel insecure about herself, her lifestyle of modest means, unfamiliarity with the rich and aristocratic surroundings in Paris. And Adriana informs Gigi that Rex has informed her that he and Gigi are not currently having sex. She has to add, to Gigi, that when she herself was with Rex, they had great sex. Right when Rex is in the sauna, talking to Brody and admitting that he and Gigi have had many barriers and trust issues throughout their relationship, she calls him and furiously demands to know if he told Adriana that they do not have sex. She is furious that he would do that. Right then, when Rex is alone in the sauna and discouraged, Kelly enters.",
