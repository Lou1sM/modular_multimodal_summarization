John's assistant, Nadia tells Natalie about John's departure from Llanview. Natalie immediately goes to the station. Vimal goes to John to report his sister, Neela, missing after possibly seeing her on the docks with a boy. John tells Vimal he doesn't work for LPD anymore. Vimal wonders if his losing Neela is his karma for withholding the truth about Liam from John. Rama finds Neela, safe. Neela tells her that Jack Manning is the boy of her dreams and that she simply cannot go through with the arranged marriage to Rajiv back home in India. She begs Rama to convince Vimal to let her stay in America. Rama tells her that she had romantic dreams when she was a young girl, too, but she ultimately came to love her arranged husband with all her heart. Rama calls Vimal, tells him she found Neela, and asks him to meet them at the Sun. Brody overhears Vimal telling Rama that he intends to tell John the truth about his son. He follows Vimal to the Sun and puts a doorstop under the door so they cannot get out. Jack goes to the Sun, tells everyone to take the rest of the day off, and pours gasoline in front of Victor's office door, not knowing that Rama and Vimal are in there. David Vickers informs Todd that he doesn't have a shot with Blair. Jack vows never to let Todd have his father's newspaper. Tomas cracks the safe at the Sun. He and Blair each wonder what the other is doing there. Todd wonders the same thing when he arrives. He throws him out of his office and then discovers his safe is open. He gets the gun, mutters that they will see who takes down who puts it in his pocket and goes to La Boulaie, where he sees Blair kissing Tomas."
