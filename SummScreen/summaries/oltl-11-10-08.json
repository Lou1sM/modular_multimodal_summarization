    "soap_central": "\nThe Bess Is Yet to Come\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Viki and Charlie tried desperately to free Natalie and Jared from the explosives in the secret room. Natalie and Jared pleaded with their parents to escape and save themselves, but Viki and Charlie refused to leave their children. After failing to convince Viki to leave the mansion, Charlie was determined to defuse the bomb that Tess had set. Natalie apologized to Viki for the trouble she had caused, but Viki blamed herself. While mother and daughter expressed their love for one another, Charlie and Jared attempted to remove the drawer that contained the bomb.\n\n\nFinally, Charlie removed the bomb from the drawer. To everyone's horror, the timer on the bomb revealed that only fifteen seconds remained before it would explode. Realizing that he needed to act fast, Charlie picked up the bomb and ran out of the basement. As Viki, Jared, and Natalie called out to him, they panicked when they heard the bomb explode upstairs.\n\n\nWhile Jared tried to remain calm, Natalie attempted to comfort him. Viki ran upstairs to search for Charlie. When she didn't see any sign of him, Viki placed her head in her hands and cried. Seconds later, Viki was elated when Charlie surfaced. After sharing a loving embrace, Viki and Charlie returned downstairs to give Jared and Natalie the good news.\n\n\nJared was overjoyed when he saw Charlie. While Jared and Natalie waited patiently, the bomb squad tried, with little success, to free them from the secret room. An officer remarked that whoever had built the room had known exactly what they were doing. An emotional Viki continued to blame herself for not realizing sooner that Natalie and Jared had been trapped in the basement. Viki promised to make things up to them, but Natalie begged her mother to find Tess.\n\n\nSuddenly, Viki remembered the combination that Jean Rudolph had used many years before. Viki surprised everyone when she broke the code and freed Natalie and Jared. In tears, Natalie and Jared hugged their parents. After the joyful reunion, Natalie remembered the condition that Tess was in. She told Viki that they needed to find her right away because the baby was in trouble.\n\n\nDriving to the hospital, an emotionless Bess was intent on maintaining order. As the dead child lay on the passenger seat, Bess exclaimed, \"I'm going to turn a negative into a positive!\"\n\n\nInside Starr's hospital room, Blair was appalled to learn that Marcie had encountered Todd at the hospital. Both Blair and Starr were surprised to learn that Todd had been courteous toward Marcie. Starr shocked her mother when she admitted to calling Todd and informing him that she had gone into labor. Although Blair understood Starr's need to reconnect with her father, Blair was convinced that Todd hadn't changed.\n\n\nAs Blair and Marcie attempted to comfort her, Starr couldn't help but worry about the health of her baby girl. After Blair and Marcie convinced her that her child was fine, Starr asked Marcie what name she planned to give her new daughter. Marcie thanked Starr for giving her the opportunity to love another child and insisted that Starr had given her a renewed sense of hope. Starr and Blair were pleased when Marcie declared that she had decided to name the child Hope. Starr asked Blair if Todd could see the child. Blair promised to consider Starr's request but insisted that they deal with the baby's health issues first.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Todd told Dr. Joplin that he had changed his mind about stealing Starr's baby. After Dr. Joplin assured him that Starr had given birth to a healthy baby girl, Todd instructed the doctor to hand the child over to Marcie. Dr. Joplin inquired whether or not Todd would keep her secret regarding her son's past. Todd related that he was a changed man and had no intention on revealing her secret.\n\n\nInside Dr. Joplin's examination room, a teary-eyed Janet apologized to baby Hope. She told the child that her mother loved her but promised that her new parents would love her as well.\n\n\nAs Janet continued to express her grief over baby Hope being taken away from her mother, Bess entered Dr. Joplin's interoffice and listened to Janet's confession. Bess heard Todd and Dr. Joplin approaching the office and hid in a closet. Showing no emotion, Bess listened as Todd and Dr. Joplin discussed returning the baby to Starr. Todd wanted the doctor to take the child to Starr immediately, but Dr. Joplin told Todd that she had told Starr that the baby was expressing difficulties and had been taken to the intensive care unit.\n\n\nDr. Joplin explained to Todd that she couldn't return the child too soon because it would have taken a reasonable amount of time for the baby to be released from the ICU. Leaving Hope in the examination room, Janet stepped out into the interoffice to speak with Todd and the doctor. Bess continued to listen from inside the closet as Janet informed Todd and the doctor that Starr's baby girl was healthy. With a cold stare, Bess whispered, \"A baby girl! Perfect!\"\n\n\nDr. Joplin left Todd and Janet alone in the interoffice and checked on the baby. Explaining that he had decided to return the child to Starr, Todd told Janet that he and Marty would still be leaving town. Expressing her concern for Marty, Janet wondered how Marty would accept the fact that she wouldn't get the opportunity to raise the child. Todd believed that one day, he and Marty might possibly have a child of their own.\n\n\nJanet convinced herself that Todd and Marty could one day have their own child. Dr. Joplin interrupted their conversation and reported that she had run a series of test on Starr's baby, and the child was in perfect health. The doctor left the office to give Starr, Blair, and Marcie the good news. \n\n\nBefore exiting the office, Todd offered Janet a generous severance package and told her that he would no longer need her services. A surprised Janet followed Todd out into the hall. With the dead child in her arms, Bess entered the office and stared blankly at a smiling baby Hope. As Todd and Janet spoke out in the hall, Bess quickly dressed the dead child in baby Hope's clothing. After removing Hope from her incubator, Bess placed the dead child in the apparatus and waited for the opportunity to flee the scene. \n\n\nStarr, Blair, and Marcie were elated when Dr. Joplin told them that Hope was healthy. Starr wanted to see the child right away, but the doctor told her that it would take a while to check her out of the ICU.\n\n\nBack out in the hall, Janet was pleased with Todd's change of heart and wondered if he wanted the opportunity to see his grandchild. Remembering the bad influence he had been on his own children, Todd related to Janet that he felt it was best if he didn't meet his granddaughter. Janet wondered if Todd could live without ever seeing the child. He stated that he could because he had a new life -- a better life.\n\n\nRevealing to Janet that he was a changed man, Todd said that he was starting life over with a clean slate and insisted that he didn't have to look over his shoulder expecting something terrible to surface in his life. Free of guilt, Todd walked away, and Janet followed behind him. Janet told Todd goodbye and asked him to take care of Marty.\n\n\nBess quietly exited the office with baby Hope in her arms.\n\n\nStarr, Blair, and Marcie rejoiced when Dr. Joplin left to take Starr her baby. Marcie left to call her family with the good news. Realizing that Starr was emotional, Blair wondered if Starr was experiencing sadness because she was giving her child up. In tears, Starr admitted that she was sad but was also happy that she had created a new life. Marcie returned and thanked Starr for blessing her with a child. A jubilant Marcie expressed her desire to finally hold her baby girl.\n\n\nDr. Joplin and Janet returned to the office to retrieve Hope but were horrified by their findings. Noticing that the child in the incubator had a strange color, Dr. Joplin and Janet were distraught to discover that the baby was dead.\n\n\nWhile Marty eagerly waited for Todd to return home, she was terrified when John hurled himself through her bedroom window. In shock, Marty told John that Todd had tried desperately to keep him away from her. Upon hearing Todd's name, John removed a revolver from his jacket and insisted that Marty leave the home with him at once. Todd's bodyguard entered the room and pointed his gun at John. John immediately fired at the guard, who dropped his weapon and ran off. After chasing the guard out of the house, John returned to Marty's room and was shocked when she pointed the gunman's weapon at him.\n\n\nDemanding that John drop his weapon, Marty revealed to John that Todd had told her all about him. When John attempted to approach her, Marty fired a shot at him. In disbelief, John listened as Marty accused him of wanting to kill her. Marty told John that she knew that he had left her to die after the accident. John tried his best to explain the circumstances of the accident to Marty, but she refused to believe him and continued to express her faith in Todd.\n\n\nJohn was horrified when Marty credited both Ramsey and Todd with protecting her and restoring her health. Marty flew into a rage when John continued to speak negatively of Ramsey and Todd. John told Marty that he cared for her and begged her to leave with him. Realizing that Marty had lost her memory, John told her that Todd was manipulating her.\n\n\nMarty continued to defend Todd and was unwilling to listen to John's pleas. Still holding John at gunpoint, Marty refused to leave and stated that she was at home. John was sickened as Marty related that Todd loved her. As Todd entered the room, a frustrated, John blurted out that Todd had raped Marty. While Todd stood motionless, Marty was in shock.\n\n\n",
