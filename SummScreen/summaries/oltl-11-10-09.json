    "soap_central": "\nBack From The Dead\n\n\nMatt and Danielle were on a plane bound for Seattle.  As they chatted, Danielle suggested that Destiny was Matthew's soul mate.  Matthew chuckled; he was curious if guys had soul mates.  Danielle believed that everyone had a soul mate; she pointed to Matthew's parents as a perfect example.  Matthew confessed that he wished he could see Bo and Nora's expressions when they learned that he had left the school.\n\n\nMatthew suspected that Bo and Nora would do everything in their power to stop his surgery.  Danielle advised Matthew to call his attorney when he reached Seattle.  Matthew rejected the idea because his lawyer had not returned his last call.  Matthew grumbled, \"Some shark T\u00e9a Delgado turned out to be.\"  Danielle was gobsmacked at the mention of her mother's name.  Matthew was equally shocked when Danielle revealed that T\u00e9a was her mother.\n\n\nIn London, Bo and Nora prepared to depart for the United States.  They intended to drop by the Warwick Academy to let Matthew know that they would return in a few days.  David entered the foyer moments later.  David wished them well when he realized that Bo and Nora intended to tell Clint about their relationship.  David offered Bo advice about how to break the news to Clint.  To everyone's surprise, Clint entered the foyer.\n\n\nNora was relieved when it appeared that Clint hadn't overheard David's comments.  She greeted her husband and then asked him what he was doing in London.  Nora wondered if Jared had been found.  Clint explained that he had wanted to surprise his wife with a visit.  Clint was confident that someone would call him as soon as they had any new information about Jared.  Moments later, Nora, Clint, and Bo went to the parlor.\n\n\nClint was eager to get a drink, but Nora seemed determined to talk to him.  Clint became suspicious when Bo offered to stay while Nora talked to Clint.  However, before Clint could question Bo and Nora about their odd behavior, Neville announced that the headmistress of Matthew's school was on the phone.  Bo instructed Neville to put the call on speakerphone.  Bo and Nora were stunned when the headmistress informed them that Matthew was missing.\n\n\nWhen Destiny returned to the mansion, David asked her how her meeting with Matthew had gone.  Destiny confessed that she hadn't told Matthew that she loved him because Matthew had met a new friend.  David understood Destiny's dejection when Destiny clarified that Matthew's new friend was a girl.  Destiny decided that it was best for her and David to return home, since it appeared that Matthew no longer needed their help.  Destiny was surprised when David revealed that he had decided to remain in London.\n\n\nLater, David offered Destiny some money before she left for the airport.  Destiny admitted that she was going to miss David.  David seemed touched by Destiny's words.  After Destiny left, Bo and Nora approached David.  They were desperate to know if he had seen Matthew or if Destiny had returned from the school.  David claimed he had not seen either teen.\n\n\nAfter Nora, Bo, and Clint left, Neville found David lounging in the parlor.  To Neville's horror, David informed the butler that he had decided to stay in London.  Neville was further dismayed when he learned that David was a Buchanan.  On the other hand, David was delighted to discover that Neville had impressive connections to the royal family.  David was certain that his relationship with Neville was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n\n\nAt the Warwick Academy, T\u00e9a was livid over Danielle's disappearance.  T\u00e9a was certain that Ross had taken her daughter, but Elijah pointed out that there wasn't any evidence to support T\u00e9a's theory.  T\u00e9a turned her wrath on the headmistress.  T\u00e9a promised all manner of retribution if anything happened to Danielle as a result of the headmistress's neglect.  Moments later, a student entered the room with a snapshot of some surveillance footage.\n\n\nTo T\u00e9a's surprise, the headmistress announced that the cameras had captured an unknown young black girl on the premises.  T\u00e9a snatched the picture out of the headmistress's hands.  As T\u00e9a and Elijah studied the picture, they realized that they were looking at Destiny.  When Matthew's name was mentioned, the headmistress revealed that he was a new student and Danielle's new friend.  A quick check of Matthew's room confirmed that Matthew was also missing.\n\n\nA short time later, Bo, Nora, and Clint arrived at the Warwick Academy.  Bo and Nora demanded to know how the school had managed to lose a boy in a wheelchair.  The headmistress ushered the Buchanans to her office where T\u00e9a and Elijah were waiting.  Nora immediately suspected that T\u00e9a was involved in Matthew's disappearance.  Nora and T\u00e9a traded heated words and then Nora threatened to prosecute anyone who had helped Matthew, including the student who had left the school with him.  T\u00e9a warned Nora that no one messed with \"my daughter.\"\n\n\nLayla went to the diner to talk to Cris about their relationship.  Layla confessed that she had a million reasons not to get involved with Cris.  She was worried about Evangeline's reaction if her sister emerged from the coma, and she had reservations about how badly Cris had bungled things with Sarah.  Layla was also leery about her own history of failed relationships.  According to Layla, she was doing much better without a man in her life.  However, despite all of the reasons not to explore her feelings for Cris, Layla worried that she might miss out on something wonderful if she held back.\n\n\nAfter Layla poured her heart out to Cris, she waited for his response.  Cris hesitated for a moment before he walked up to Layla and then kissed her passionately.\n\n\nOliver arrived home from his assignment at Nash's grave to find Kyle waiting.  Oliver was embarrassed because he was covered with dirt, but he was touched that Kyle had stuck around.  At Kyle's urging, Oliver showered and then returned to the living room.  As Kyle handed Oliver's shirt to him, he suggested that they stay in for the evening.  Oliver seemed nervous; he asked Kyle what they would do.\n\n\nKyle assured Oliver that they didn't have to do anything that Oliver wasn't comfortable with.  Kyle simply wanted to spend some time with Oliver.  Oliver admitted that he didn't want to disappoint Kyle.  Oliver explained that he hadn't been intimate with another man since his college days when he had been with Kyle.  Oliver and Kyle's kiss ended abruptly when the door suddenly crashed open as Layla and Cris stumbled through the doors, locked in a heated kiss.\n\n\nLayla and Cris jumped apart when they realized that they weren't alone.  Layla apologized to Oliver; she thought that Oliver and Kyle had gone out on a date.  Oliver explained that he had been called in to work and that he had gotten dirty.  Cris and Layla teased Oliver about showering alone while Kyle tried to hide his smile at Oliver's embarrassment.\n\n\nAfter Layla and Cris disappeared in to the next room, Kyle and Oliver laughed and then decided that they would wait before they were intimate.  They wanted their \"first\" time to be special.  Later, Kyle and Oliver were watching \"Christina Comes Home For Christmas\" when Layla and Cris joined them in the living room.  Layla was delighted to see that her favorite movie was on, so she and Cris sat down to watch the movie with Kyle and Oliver.\n\n\nBrody and John were on a flight headed to Napa Valley.  John explained that Mitch Laurence was the only link that could tie all of the recent events together.  Brody had never heard of Mitch Laurence, so John revealed that Mitch had been a cult leader and a rapist.  Brody was stunned to discover that Mitch was also Jessica's biological father.  John revealed that Jessica and Natalie were fraternal twins with different fathers.  Brody's shock turned to confusion when John added that Mitch had been killed five years earlier.\n\n\nRex stared in disbelief at the birth certificate that Corrine handed to him.  Rex didn't want to believe that Mitch Laurence was his biological father, but Corrine insisted that it was true.  Corrine reminded Rex that Roxy and Walter had been mixed up with Mitch during the time that Rex had been conceived.  Rex wondered if Roxy had been raped.  Corrine didn't think it mattered.  She pointed out that Mitch could be eerily persuasive when he set his mind to something.\n\n\nRex surmised that Roxy had known that Mitch had been alive because she had been able to harvest his stem cells while he'd been in a nursing home.   He realized that Mitch had been the secret that Roxy had been hiding.\n\n\nAt the vineyard in Napa Valley, Jessica stared at Mitch Laurence in horror.  Instinctively, Jared used his body in an attempt to shield Natalie from Mitch.  Natalie jerked away from Jared and then reached for a weapon.  While Mitch rambled on and quoted the B ible, Natalie launched herself at Mitch.  Within moments, Mitch overpowered Natalie and then he disarmed her.  Once he had gained the upper hand, Mitch used Natalie as a means to control Jessica and Jared.\n\n\nJessica demanded to know how Mitch had survived being bludgeoned by her with a lead pipe. Mitch responded, \"Funny you should ask.  I had come to realize that, well, Llanview was no longer open to my teachings, so I made a few arrangements and let you and the police believe that I had perished.\"   Mitch explained that afterwards, he had \"resurrected\" himself in more \"hospitable surroundings.\"\n\n\nMitch regretted that he had allowed Jessica to believe that she had dishonored her father; however, he had returned, so he hoped that the healing process could begin.  Jessica was outraged that Mitch had dug up Nash's body, in order to lure her to Napa Valley.  Mitch regretted going to such extremes.  He promised to give Nash a proper burial, which was more than he intended to give Jared.  Natalie warned Mitch to leave Jared alone.  According to Natalie, Jared had nothing to do with what was going on.\n\n\nMitch disagreed; he claimed that Jared had been doing exactly as he had been instructed since \"day one.\"  Jared appeared uncomfortable as Mitch dared Jared to reveal the truth to Natalie and Jessica.  Jared insisted that he had not known that Mitch had been behind everything that had happened.  Mitch hinted that Jared had been motivated by a desire to protect Charlie. \n\n\n",
