He informed her that she had walked into the men's sauna by mistake, but when Kelly attempted to leave, she found the door stuck.  Rex offered to help her force the door, but Kelly feared another \"close encounter\" between them, and ordered him to stay away.  When she shoved him away, Rex fell to the floor as his towel slipped off his hips.  Gawking at Rex \"in the altogether,\" Kelly rushed to help him and found herself slipping as well, as her own towel went flying.\n\n\nMortified, Rex and Kelly scrambled to grab their towels and regain some sliver of dignity.  Once half-dressed, Rex managed to force the door open.  Before leaving, Kelly apologized to Rex for her impulsiveness and said she was having a bad day.  Rex sympathized, and Kelly found herself sitting down beside him as Rex recounted his long-distance quarrel with Gigi.  Kelly was amused to hear that Rex had been foolish enough to tell Adriana all about his and Gigi's lackluster sex life.\n\n\n\"I'm screwed, aren't I?\" Rex moaned.  \"Apparently not!\" Kelly quipped.  She said Gigi would need time to forgive his blunder, but consoled him and said that it had been even longer since she'd had a roll in the hay.  She explained that Dorian had hired \"a masseur\" for her, then admitted, \"alright, yeah, he was totally a hooker,\" and said that Rex didn't deserve to suffer the same celibate fate.  She encouraged him to call Gigi back and apologize, but warned him not to do it while they were alone together, barely clad, in the steam room.\n\n\nAs Kelly prepared to leave, she mentioned that she was heading to the Manning party that evening.  Rex asked if she was going alone, and offered to go on her arm, not as a date, but as an \"escort.\"  \"What's Gigi gonna think?\" Kelly asked.  \"She's in Paris, royally ticked,\" Rex said as he sighed. \"I'm the last thing on her mind right now.\"  With that, Rex and Kelly walked out of the sauna and headed for their respective locker rooms.\n\n\nIn Paris, Adriana informed Cristian that she had to take Layla off his hands, and explained that they were needed in Milan to assist with their boss's new men's wear line.  Cristian was put out when he learned that the \"fashion emergency\" would require Layla to leave for a week, nullifying their dinner plans atop the Eiffel Tower.  Adriana told Layla that their boss, Steffen, had asked for her personally.  Conflicted, Layla told Adriana to give her and Cris a moment alone.\n\n\nTurning to Cristian, Layla explained that if she didn't go to Milan, Steffen would fire her, and she would have gone to France for nothing. \"This is my shot,\" she sighed. \"Do you want me to miss it?\"  Cristian told Layla he wanted her to have everything, but he needed to know that he had a place in her future.\n\n\nAcross the restaurant, Gigi drowned her sorrows in wine and bitched to a non-English speaking waiter all about her troubles with Rex and Adriana.  The waiter told Gigi over and over that he did not \"parler Anglais,\" but as he walked away from the table, he muttered to himself in French, \"That relationship is doomed!\"  Adriana returned to the table, and Gigi asked her if she was screwing with Cristian and Layla's romance just as she had screwed with Gigi and Rex's.  Adriana responded by needling Gigi about her empty sex life, and warned her that the Balsoms were in for a \"long, cold winter.\"   Fed up, Gigi apologized to Adriana for it \"not being my turn,\" and punched her a second time.\n\n\nCristian and Layla raced over to break up Gigi and Adriana's catfight; as Cristian hurried Gigi back to the table, Adriana confronted Layla about the Milan trip.  She said that Layla could go to Milan and visit Cristian in Llanview afterward, but Layla was tempted to stay in Paris with Cristian for the night.  She asked Adriana what she could tell Steffen.  \"The truth,\" Adriana snapped. \"Your boyfriend doesn't understand your career.\"  Adriana warned Layla that her career in Paris would be over, and cracked that she could always go back to Llanview and enjoy the uniform fabrics at the police station.\n\n\nAs Adriana prepared to leave, Cristian returned to Layla's side.  His face fell as he realized she intended to go to Milan.  Layla asked him to accompany her, but Cris said he had to attend the Paris conference.  Layla countered that Steffen expected her in Milan as well, and promised to head back to Llanview when the fashion show was over.  As Adriana told Layla to hurry up, Layla kissed Cris and promised to make it up to him.  Meanwhile, Adriana fired a parting shot at the inebriated Gigi: \"Tell Rex I said...never mind, I'll tell him myself.\"\n\n\nWith Layla and Adriana gone, Cristian sank into a chair beside Gigi.  Gigi wanted more wine, but Cristian suggested they get it somewhere else -- at the restaurant atop the Eiffel Tower, where he still had reservations, which didn't have to go to waste, Layla or no Layla.  As Gigi and Cristian left the restaurant, their waiter looked on.  \"Poor Rex,\" he clucked in French. \"That relationship is doomed.\"\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Nate and Inez were heading out of the Buenos Dias.  Nate was surprised to hear his mom was attending the Mannings' party, as well, and was pleased that she had Clint as a date.  Nate agreed to accompany her to Ford and James's apartment to drop off some food.\n\n\nAt the Ford brothers' apartment, a morose James picked at his cereal as Ford cleaned up Eddie's empty beer bottles.  Both boys were desperate to be rid of their lunatic father, but couldn't figure out how to replace the fifty thousand dollars James had stolen.  Eddie sauntered into the kitchen, looking for breakfast, and suggested the Ford men head to the zoo together or find some other \"family bonding\" activity in order to reconnect.  When neither of his sons expressed much enthusiasm for this idea, Eddie called them ungrateful.  James and Ford quaked with fear as Eddie grabbed James's cereal bowl and cackled that they were \"family\" once again.\n\n\nHung over, Eddie rushed to the bathroom to vomit.  Alone again, a terrified James begged Ford to think of a way to get rid of their \"very bad dad,\" and Ford reassured him that they weren't small children who Eddie could terrorize anymore.  Answering a knock at the door, Ford and James were horrified to see Inez and Nate making their special delivery.  Ford pleaded with them to leave immediately, but weren't able to send their long-lost relations away before Eddie returned to the living room and spotted his estranged wife.  \"Bobby, where's your manners?\" Eddie drawled. \"Ask the whore in.\"\n\n\nInez rushed into the apartment and demanded to know what Eddie was doing in Llanview.  Eddie explained his release, and said he was in town to reunite the family.  When he mistook Nate for her lover and accused Inez of \"robbing the cradle,\" Inez slapped him and informed him that Nate was their youngest child.  \"'Nathaniel?'\" Eddie scowled. \"Inez, you name your boys wuss names!\"\n\n\nEddie refused to believe that Nate was his flesh and blood, but Inez insisted she had been too terrified to cheat on him.  Eddie excoriated Inez for leaving him alone with two small boys, and Inez said she regretted running away, but James and Ford didn't have to take his abuse anymore, and she ordered her elder sons to leave with her and Nate.  She warned Eddie not to try to stop her, or he would regret it.\n\n\nBefore the situation could escalate, Ford hurried Inez and his brothers out into the corridor.  He explained that unless he bent to his father's will, Eddie would call the Ohio authorities and have James arrested.  Inez wanted to talk to Bo and the police, but James and Ford urged her to stay away and let them handle Eddie.  Inez refused, and said that when Eddie went after her boys, he went after her.  \"And this time,\" she vowed, \"he'll realize he bit off more than he can chew.\"\n\n\nAt Llanfair, John demanded to know if Natalie had undergone an amniocentesis test without his knowledge.  Natalie hemmed and hawed, but John explained that Marty had told him about it.  Infuriated, Natalie complained about Marty's harassment.  \"Shut up and answer the question!\" John yelled. \"Did you have the test?\"  \"Yes,\" Natalie replied.\n\n\nJohn was outraged that Natalie had undergone a risky procedure without discussing it with him, and asked how she could have done it.  When Brody stepped in and asked John to calm down, McBain warned him to mind his own business.  Brody said Natalie would be his family soon, as well, but Natalie asked him to check on Jessica and leave her and John to their private conversation.\n\n\nWith Brody gone, John told Natalie he was at a loss.  He didn't understand how she could have undergone such a risky and invasive test without speaking to him first, and told her she was being deceptive.  Emotional, Natalie said she never wanted to lie to him, and said she had wanted to protect him, and that she didn't want him to worry.  \"About what?\"  John asked.  \"The results,\" Natalie said softly.\n\n\nWhen John questioned her about her need for an amnio, Natalie covered and said that she had only taken the test in order to make sure the baby was all right.  She said she knew John feared losing another child, and she wanted to be safe.  Softening, John told her they needed to be partners in important decisions about the pregnancy, and he hugged her.  Natalie told him they would have the results soon.  John told her he had to pick up Marty and deliver Cole to Statesville Prison, and kissed his nervous beloved goodbye.\n\n\nAfter John left, Brody returned to the drawing room and asked Natalie if she was okay.  Natalie said she had explained away her amnio, but her anxiety would remain until she knew for certain that John was her baby's father.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Cole told Starr he was going to prison for ten years, and that they couldn't be together -- \"it's over.\"  He didn't want her and Hope to visit a bleak environment like Statesville, and he wouldn't see them if they did.  As Starr protested, Cole told her that she was eighteen and had her whole life ahead of her, and could move on someday.  He needed to know she would be okay, that she would move on and be happy \n\n\n",
