    "tvmega_recap": "Brody goes to talk to Jessica after Natalie informed him of the \"insane stunt\" Jessica pulled attempting to get them to believe that Liam is John's instead of Brody's. He knows how to convince her that he hasn't a clue what she is talking about, confident that Natalie doesn't buy it for a minute and knowing she has no proof. But she urges him to get Liam tested just so he knows. She returns to Robert Ford who consoles her and seems to be the only person she can confide in. Robert, James, Nate, Starr and Dani are all getting \"needled\" by Rick to have Starr and Nate do a sleazy porn flick called Jail Bait. Although all 5 of them are opposed to it, he reminds them that he owns the contract and without the money that the porn flick will bring in, they won't be able to do the songs that Starr wants to record. Jack sets fire to The Sun building and tells all employees they can have the day off before he does it. Little does he know, however, that Vimal and Rama are trapped inside the room. Before it's too late, he and Neela go to save them. Todd is haunted by Irene's ghost while Blair is ready to sleep with Tomas and Todd's afraid she will forget all about him."
