    "soap_central": "\nDarkness on the Edge of Town\n\n\nIn Dr. Joplin's office, Dr. Joplin and Janet stared down at the dead infant -- actually Jessica's stillborn daughter -- with horror. Dr. Joplin couldn't understand how Starr's child had died after appearing to be fine; she blamed Janet, whom she'd left the baby with. Janet insisted that she had only left Baby Hope alone for a minute to speak to Todd and that he'd been nowhere near the little girl. Dr. Joplin castigated herself for not checking the baby's vitals properly and agonized over having to tell Starr and Marcie. She told a tearful Janet to leave and let her take care of the rest.\n\n\nIn Starr's hospital room, Starr, Blair, and Marcie remained blissfully unaware, jubilant about the birth of \"Hope.\" They wondered what was keeping Dr. Joplin from returning with the baby, and Marcie fretted about the baby's health as well as the sudden reappearance of Todd in the hospital corridors. She explained to Starr and Blair that Todd had seemed different, friendly, and said he had presented as though he were \"at peace with himself.\" Starr chimed in that Todd had also sounded different to her on the phone. Blair was skeptical, but hoped Todd's change of heart was real.\n\n\nIn the waiting area, Cole and Langston worried about Starr and the baby. Dorian arrived on the scene, also wanting answers. When Michael approached Starr's room, the three of them buttonholed him for answers, and Michael promised that Dr. Joplin would return soon. Cole decided to go looking for Dr. Joplin, leaving Langston and Dorian alone to brood.\n\n\nLangston told Dorian that she and Starr had been waiting for the baby together for months and that while she had comforted her friend, Starr had been her rock throughout the crisis with Ray as well. Dorian admired the strength and togetherness of Langston, Starr, and their friends and hoped they'd always be close. Langston vowed to be there for Starr once Marcie adopted Hope.\n\n\nBess returned to the vineyard cottage, holding baby Hope in her arms. She soothed the child and began to lay out her rationale for her actions. Bess told Hope that though Starr would be pained by her loss, Todd would still be a danger to the baby as her grandfather, and though he wanted her, Jessica needed her and would be a better parent for her. She lamented Tess's miscarriage and said that her fellow alter had bitten off more than she could chew, whereas Bess's duty was simple: protect Jessica. \"You give her hope,\" Bess said. \n\n\nBess realized that Starr and others would suffer but said that all \"we\" cared about was Jessica's happiness. She hoped Jared and Natalie would survive Tess's foolhardy plans and knew that no matter what, the grief and guilt would cripple Jessica, which was why Hope would be needed to keep her busy and help her recover. She said that Viki would realize she was at the cottage and prepared to get ready for her arrival.\n\n\nAs she let her hair down and removed her glasses, Bess held Hope close to her and told her that the only ones who would know she wasn't Jessica's baby were the two of them, and they weren't telling. \"No more chaos,\" she sighed, lying back against an armchair and closing her eyes. \n\n\nIn the basement of Llanfair, Viki, Charlie, Jared, and Natalie stood outside the secret room as the police bomb squad continued surveying the area. Natalie and Jared told their parents how Tess had almost freed them before experiencing major abdominal pains, and Viki was alarmed to realize Tess had gone into labor. Natalie told Viki they had to find Jessica and save her and the baby.\n\n\nBo and Clint arrived on the scene, and the foursome recounted their ordeal for the Buchanan brothers. Clint embraced Natalie, who tried to apologize for all the trouble she and Jared had caused. Clint told his daughter it was he who needed to apologize for his vindictive and selfish behavior toward her, regarding Buchanan Enterprises. He told Jared and Natalie that he'd gotten the company back from Dorian, but all that really mattered to him was Natalie's love and safety. \n\n\nBo began checking hospitals for reports of Tess, while Viki and Charlie explained how Tina had helped them locate the secret room. Viki vocalized her gratitude for her wayward sister, but Natalie and Jared chose to remain mum about Tina's involvement. Natalie told Viki that the mention of Nash was what had set Tess off again, and Viki deduced that the only place Tess could have escaped to for refuge was Nash and Jessica's cottage. Viki and Clint rushed off to the vineyard, but before she left, Viki hugged Charlie, thanking him for saving her daughters' lives. \n\n\nBo gave Jared and Natalie a once-over, and told them to go to the police station in the morning to give statements. He congratulated Charlie on his heroic efforts with the bomb then exited with the rest of his squad. Natalie told Charlie she could see how Viki still looked at him, and Charlie admitted that things were \"better\" between him and Viki. Natalie said that Charlie was good for her mother, and hoped they found their way back to each other.] \n\n\nCharlie told Natalie that Jared had never given up on her. Sharing a private moment with his son, Charlie hugged Jared and exulted in their \"second chance\" at rebuilding their family. After Charlie was gone, Natalie and Jared kissed passionately and resolved to \"get the hell out of here\" as quickly as possible, leaving the secret room empty behind them. \n\n\nIn Starr's hospital room, Michael entered to check on the young mother, and Marcie asked him to stay and wait to meet Hope. Michael told Marcie and the Cramers that he'd find Dr. Joplin for them, but before he could leave, Dr. Joplin entered, ashen-faced. She broke the news to Blair, Starr, and Marcie that the baby had died, and the women were shocked and heartbroken. Michael and Marcie wanted to know how it was possible, and Dr. Joplin mumbled that the little girl had \"arrested.\"\n\n\nBlair turned on Dr. Joplin, angry and demanding answers, but the doctor had none to give. Marcie asked to see \"Hope,\" and Dr. Joplin said she'd take her to the child. Sobbing, Starr choked out an apology to Marcie. Marcie wept and hugged the teenager, saying she was very grateful to Starr for the opportunity. \n\n\nMichael left with Marcie and Dr. Joplin to see to \"Hope,\" while a despondent Blair struggled to comfort her hysterical daughter. Starr couldn't understand how she'd had a perfect, healthy pregnancy for nine months, only to have it end in nothing. Blair told Starr that it wasn't her fault or anyone else's and begged her not to blame herself. Starr asked Blair to break the news to Dorian and Langston but told her to send Cole in to see her so she could tell him herself. Blair agreed and cried as she told Starr how proud she was of her. She exited, leaving Starr alone and devastated. \n\n\nDr. Joplin took Michael and Marcie to her office and allowed them to enter alone to see the baby. After the McBains went inside, Dr. Joplin collapsed against the doorframe, sobbing in anguish. In the office, the bereaved Marcie was face-to-face with \"Baby Hope.\" \n\n\nCole returned to Dorian and Langston in the waiting area just in time for Blair to arrive. Her face grim, Blair asked Cole to go see to Starr. After the boy left, she managed to tell Dorian and Langston that Starr's baby was \"gone.\" \"It was a girl,\" Blair whispered. Langston burst into tears, and Dorian held her. \n\n\nCole raced into Starr's room. Taking one look in her eyes, he embraced her, while the shattered Starr tried to find the words to tell him what had happened to their daughter. \n\n\nAt the vineyard cottage, Jessica opened her eyes and awoke, surprised to find a newborn child cradled in her arms. Confused, she asked the baby if she belonged to her. Just then, Viki and Clint entered and were shocked to see Jessica lying there. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, Todd walked in on Marty holding John at gunpoint, just as John told her that Todd was her rapist. Marty was disbelieving of John's claim, but John insisted he was telling her the truth. He told Marty that Todd had been filling her head with lies and had capitalized on her injuries and memory loss to press his own advantage. John pulled one of his guns, but Marty threatened to shoot him if he tried to hurt Todd.\n\n\nJohn agreed to put down his weapon but warned Marty, \"You have no idea who you're protecting.\" He related the story of the gang rape and said that Todd had been the ringleader. Marty said she'd seen the men's faces. \"Did you see the names?\" John asked. He told her Todd had undergone plastic surgery to change his appearance, but Marty scoffed at him and said that Todd had warned her about John's lies and manipulation of the law. She refused to believe what he was telling her about \"the man that I love.\" \n\n\nJohn was disgusted by what Todd had done to Marty's mind, but Todd reassured Marty that their feelings for each other were totally \"real.\" Todd tried to get Marty to hand him the gun, calling her \"sweetie.\" Marty refused, saying that John would shoot him, and she'd have to kill him first. John said she wouldn't shoot him and added that she was too good for it, because she was \"a wonderful mother.\" Marty did a double-take and asked, \"What?\" \"You son of a bitch,\" John muttered, \"you didn't tell her.\" John explained to Marty that she had a son. \n\n\nMarty didn't want to believe what John was saying, but his words hit home with her own feelings and fragmented memories, and she began to spiral out of control. She looked to Todd, begging him to tell her it wasn't true and that John was lying. John pushed Todd to tell her the truth. \"Tell me he's lying!\" Marty cried, growing hysterical.\n\n\nTodd was at a loss for words. \"I didn't know that I was going to fall in love with you,\" he mumbled, \"I didn't know that.\" He admitted it was true; she had a son. Stunned and angry, Marty ripped herself away from his comforting arms and cast her eyes back and forth between John and Todd, the gun still in her hand, unsure of her next move.\n\n\n",
