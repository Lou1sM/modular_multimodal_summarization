    "soap_central": "\nSing Along With Mitch\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Charlie entered the bedroom he shared with Viki just as Viki wrapped up a phone call from John, who relayed to her the news of Jessica and Natalie heading for Napa.  Viki feared that her daughters were in grave danger.  She recounted to Charlie the abductions of Rex and Brody in Michigan, and how they were tricked to leave the women unprotected.  Charlie panicked, fearing that Jared really was responsible for the stalking and Nash's grave-robbing, but Viki refused to believe it.  Charlie couldn't get over the thought that perhaps his years of alcoholism had irreparably scarred his son.\n\n\nViki told Charlie that Jared wasn't responsible for what had happened, and that John believed something much larger was at work.  She urged Charlie not to blame himself, and said she would never turn his back on him regardless of what Jared had or had not done; they were married for better or worse.\n\n\nAt the Warwick School in London, Bo, Nora, and Clint were floored to hear T\u00e9a's confession about Danielle.  Nora asked T\u00e9a if Matthew knew Danielle was her daughter, but T\u00e9a blew her off, growing evasive and nasty as she tossed off veiled jibes at Bo and Nora's \"close relationship.\"  Nora blamed T\u00e9a for the mess, fearing that if the kids were together, Matthew could also be in danger from Ross.  She asked why T\u00e9a   hadn't told anyone in Llanview about Ross, Danielle, and her \"double life,\" but T\u00e9a couldn't find an answer.\n\n\nElijah returned to the  headmistress' office after questioning Tom, and discovering Matthew and Danielle's escape plan.  The respective parents were stunned to realize their children had conspired together, and dismayed when Elijah revealed that Tom had given Matthew cash in order to eliminate a credit card trail.  T\u00e9a said she didn't need it, pegging the kids as young lovers who had flown to Danielle's former home of Tahiti; she called Matthew and Danielle \"young and impulsive,\" then tossed another jab at Bo and Nora's own \"impulses.\"  Nora and T\u00e9a fell into a  slanging match over their parenting failures, as Clint entered the fray, curious about why T\u00e9a was needling his wife about Bo.  Before T\u00e9a could tell all, Bo stepped in with his own theory: Matthew was headed to Seattle, so he could get his surgery and walk again.\n\n\nWhile Bo began to investigate, Elijah cornered T\u00e9a and suggested he call Ross, in order to determine whether or not Danielle was with him.  T\u00e9a resisted, and said she had to be the one to call her ex-husband.\n\n\nIn Seattle, Matthew and Danielle arrived at the hospital where he'd been scheduled to have his operation.  Matthew congratulated Danielle on getting them to their destination, and said she was resourceful just like her mother, a comparison the girl detested.  The teens had Dr. Nance, Matthew's surgeon, paged, then Danielle reviewed the game plan.  They'd would get Matthew his operation, then head for  Hawaii to find Ross.\n\n\nDanielle feared that their elders could track them down, but Matthew wasn't so sure, and explained that there was no love lost between their parents.  He theorized that T\u00e9a and Nora's personal issues could buy them some time, and recounted how T\u00e9a had used Bo and Nora's forbidden love to win points in court.\n\n\nDr. Nance arrived in the reception area, surprised to see Matthew.  Matthew explained that his parents had lied and canceled his operation without his consent, and said he was desperate to go under the knife.  Just then, Bo called the hospital's front desk, asking for Dr. Nance.  Matthew begged the doctor not to reveal his location, as his parents were standing in the way of his health.\n\n\nOn the phone with Bo, Dr. Nance claimed he hadn't heard from Matthew.  Disappointed, Bo told him goodbye.\n\n\nMatthew thanked Dr. Nance for covering for him, and Dr. Nance replied that he didn't appreciate being lied to about a patient.  As Nance left to check his schedule, Matthew was unable to contain his joy, amazed that he would soon be able to walk again.  He told Danielle it was all thanks to her, and that she had the same determined streak as her mother.  Danielle was upset to realize that T\u00e9a hadn't told anyone in Llanview that she had a daughter.\n\n\nDr. Nance returned and told Matthew he had an immediate opening in his schedule, and was ready to perform the operation.  \"Let's do it!\" Matthew replied.\n\n\nBack in London, Bo and Nora were stymied; if Matthew wasn't in Seattle, Nora wondered where he was.  Growing emotional, Nora found refuge in Bo's arms, much to Clint's chagrin as he hung up from his own troubling phone call to Viki.  Bo and Nora pulled away from one another as Clint explained what Viki had told him about Jessica and Natalie being lured to Napa.\n\n\nClint apologized to Nora and told her he had to rush back to the  States to help his daughters.  Bo insisted Clint take the company jet, and assured his brother that he and Nora would find their own way home.  Bo watched as Clint embraced Nora and told her he loved her, then departed.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Charlie continued to fear for Jared and the girls' safety.  Viki told Charlie that Clint was on his way back, and there was no point in their sitting around doing nothing.  She suggested they head to Napa, and Charlie agreed.\n\n\nAt Todd's, Todd and Jack suffered through a frightening horror movie.  As Jack averted his eyes, he asked Todd to change channels to Blair's favorite, the Llanview holiday classic Christina Comes Home For Christmas.  Todd was reluctant, but Jack pressed the issue of Blair, and insisted she belonged there so they could be a family again.\n\n\nWhen the doorbell rang, Jack listened in as Todd met with his private investigator.  The  P.I. told Todd he had a man in London who had tracked T\u00e9a and Elijah to the Warwick School, but had been unable to obtain information as to what she was doing there.  Todd wondered where Ross was, and if he was also at Warwick.  He urged the investigator to stay on the case.\n\n\nAfter the P.I. left, Jack cornered his father and asked if he was going to London to find T\u00e9a, who he thought loved him, after all.  Todd told Jack to mind his own business, but the boy wouldn't let up.  Jack reminded Todd of his parents' close encounter on Halloween, and said that while T\u00e9a was nice, she wasn't Blair, and she'd hurt Todd with her lie about Ross.  Jack asked why Todd wouldn't simply reunite with Blair, or at least, if he still wanted T\u00e9a, stop stringing Blair along.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair sat in her bedroom, shedding tears at Christina Comes Home For Christmas.  Suddenly, Ross burst in.  Ross told Blair he had a score to settle, and asked her why she'd fed Todd a line about him running a scam with T\u00e9a.  Blair was surprised to see Ross still in Llanview, and asked if he'd reunited with T\u00e9a.  Ross vehemently denied wanting anything to do with his ex, and said Blair was his only friend in town.\n\n\nAs Blair feigned surprise, Ross explained that he and T\u00e9a had a daughter, and he was being kept from his child on T\u00e9a's whim.  He told Blair about his failed excursion to England, and said he hadn't wanted to do anything crazy or frighten Danielle.  He'd flown back to Llanview to get Blair's aid.\n\n\nBefore the conversation could go further, T\u00e9a called Ross from London, ready to question him about her daughter's whereabouts.  T\u00e9a asked her ex if Danielle was with him.  Confused, Ross said no.  He demanded to know if Danielle was missing, but T\u00e9a hung up on him, infuriating Ross.\n\n\nTurning back to Blair, Ross pleaded with her to help him.  Blair was hesitant to get involved, but he reminded her that there was still something between them.  Grabbing Blair, Ross said she was all he had left, and kissed her.\n\n\nBlair pulled away from Ross, claiming there was nothing between them; they'd helped each other, and it was over.  Unwilling to reveal her own scheming about Danielle or the girl's true paternity, she cryptically suggested Ross let both T\u00e9a and Danielle go and return to Tahiti.  Ross flew into a rage and accused her of using him to get to Todd, just as T\u00e9a had.  Blair claimed that Ross losing Danielle was \"for the best,\" but Ross couldn't believe it.  \"She's my daughter!\" he cried. \"Danielle brings out the best in me.\"\n\n\nAs Ross's fury grew, Blair demanded he leave.  She dashed for the phone, but Ross ripped it out of the wall and threw it across the room.  He backed her against the bed, and said everyone else had gotten what they wanted; \"now it's time for Ross Rayburn to get what he wants!\"  Just then, Todd rushed in, tackling Ross to the ground.\n\n\nAt the Warwick School, T\u00e9a was beside herself after her conversation with Ross.  She teared up, unable to think where Danielle could be if not in Seattle or with her father.  She excoriated herself for poor parenting, but Elijah comforted her.  Elijah told her she could start over with Danielle, beginning by giving her the truth about Todd.\n\n\nNearby, Bo and Nora attempted to regroup.  Nora couldn't believe what she was dealing with; Matthew was missing, Clint's daughters were in danger, and meanwhile, she was in love with Bo.  Bo embraced her, and told her to hold on to his love until the turmoil passed.  He got a phone call from airline security, which confirmed that Matthew and Danielle had boarded a flight to Seattle.  The concerned parents resolved to hurry back to the States.\n\n\nJohn and Brody arrived at Nash's old vineyard in Napa, concerned by the lack of police backup they'd called for.  Searching the grounds, they found  the barn Jessica and Jared had gone through, and discovered the local police bound and drugged.  John concluded that Mitch was responsible.  Brody spotted lights shining near the greenhouse, and he and John began to sneak through the darkness.\n\n\nInside the greenhouse, Mitch brandished his gun at his prisoners, holding forth with his dark gospel.  He called Jared a \"pretender\" who wanted to take his \"wife\" and daughter from him, and assured Jessica and Natalie that he had big plans for \"my girls.\"  Natalie told Mitch he was delusional and had no followers anymore, but Mitch begged to differ; he explained that his cult had reconstituted itself into a commune on the vineyard grounds, lacking only his loving family.  Jared called Mitch insane, and reminded him that neither Natalie nor Jessica wanted anything to do with him.  Cocking his gun, Mitch said that would be remedied once Jared was dead.\n\n\nNatalie leaped in front of Jared, and told Mitch that if he shot her husband, he'd have to shoot her, too.  Jared apologized to the sisters for dragging them into his nightmare, and said he'd had no idea Mitch was behind things.  Jessica stood in front of him with Natalie, blocking Mitch's aim, and told Jared he wasn't to blame, it was all Mitch.  But Mitch disagreed, and suggested that neither Jared nor his father was innocent.  \"You shut up about my father!\" Jared shouted, lunging forward.\n\n\nMitch needled Jared, urging him to tell Natalie the whole truth about his deep, dark secret.  Natalie told Mitch that no matter what he said, nothing could change how she felt for Jared.  Mitch said that Jared was lying to her, lying to keep Charlie out of prison.  As John and Brody crept towards the greenhouse entrance, Mitch told Natalie the truth: \"Your drunk of a father-in-law is a murderer.\"  Jessica and Natalie didn't want to believe it, but Jared told them it was true.\n\n\nJared explained that he'd discovered weeks before that Wayne Landers was the stalker and had wanted to turn him in, but Landers had used the information about Charlie's past against him, blackmailing him to keep silent.  Landers had claimed to only be after the Buchanan fortune, so Jared had attempted to protect the family, hoping to handle his old cellmate on his own; he agreed to stage his own assault at Buchanan Enterprises in order to give Landers access to family finances.  He had hoped Landers would go away after being paid off, then found him dead; he'd planned to tell Natalie everything, but then had been called away to the Buchanan lodge.  There, he found Pamela Stuart.  Jared had initially thought Pamela was behind everything, but Pamela explained that she'd also been called there by an anonymous text message; then, the lights had gone out, and when they turned on again, Pamela was dead, and Jared was knocked out.\n\n\nJared realized that Mitch had killed Pamela, then taken him prisoner and dragged him to Napa.  \"He used you to get to us,\" Jessica mumbled.  Overcome, Jared begged Natalie for forgiveness.  \"Of course I forgive you,\" Natalie said, \"but not if you die here!\"\n\n\nJared said she couldn't protect him from Mitch's wrath, and Mitch encouraged Natalie to listen to him.  Staring into Jared's eyes, Natalie said she was listening, to his heart, which was full of love, something Mitch would never understand.  She hugged Jared, who spotted John through the greenhouse windows, creeping up behind Mitch.  John signaled to Jared to maneuver Mitch away from the women.\n\n\nAs Brody crept around the back of the greenhouse and John advanced on the front, Jared began to wind Mitch up, flaunting Natalie's love for him.  He taunted Mitch about how much his \"girls\" hated him, and how they'd turn his followers against him and destroy him.  Breaking away from Jessica and Natalie's protective circle, Jared got Mitch to move away from the sisters, and told him he'd never have the family he craved.  Mitch lost his temper, lunging at Jared, and John leaped out from behind the door, pointing his gun at Mitch, who promptly grabbed Natalie as a human shield.\n\n\nMitch warned John that Natalie was \"only\" his wife, and therefore dispensable, but John told him he had nowhere to go.  Out of options, Mitch relented, releasing Natalie.  As Natalie and Jared embraced, John ordered Mitch to back away and put down his weapon.  Mitch backed up and knelt down to let go of the gun, but as he did so, John turned to check on Natalie and Jared.  With John's back turned, Mitch raised his gun and fired. \n\n\n",
