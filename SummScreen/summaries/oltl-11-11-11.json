    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie's wedding preparation is underway. But right when she's talking to Tina about her confrontation with Jessica and the \"vicious fabrication\" her sister has gotten that Liam is John's and not Brody's, and Tina's agreeing with Natalie that that is absurd, the dog tries fervently to \"interrupt them\". They only hear barking. But we hear the dog speaking in English that they need to know it's true that John is Liam's father. And when she remembers she hid the document that can prove it, she runs up after it. Tina discovers she's lost and knows she cannot attend the wedding to be Natalie's maid of honor, until she finds her dog. Natalie somehow knows it's \"important\" and graciously lets her aunt stay behind while she goes to get married. Yet she is obviously having her doubts. John is ready to leave for Seattle although everybody who knows him is concerned and believes he's \"running\" from his feelings for Natalie. Clint gets to attend and walk his daughter down the aisle after he's gotten help from Dorian. Bo and Nora are happily together,, getting along with Clint but missing Matthew. Shaun wants to marry Vivian but she has issues with marriage revealing to him that her parents are unhappily married although he wants her to say yes to him soon."
