    "soap_central": "\nI Wish That I Had Jessie's Girl:\n\n\nIn Dr. Joplin's office, Marcie picked up the baby girl that she believed was Hope. While Michael stood quietly nearby, Marcie spoke from her heart as she expressed her sorrow over losing a daughter she'd never had the opportunity to say \"hello\" to. After Marcie returned the tiny infant to the bassinet, Michael helped Marcie out of the office. In an effort to ease Marcie's heartache, Michael told Marcie that nothing could have been done to prevent the baby from dying. Marcie didn't appear to find much comfort in knowing her daughter could not have been saved. \n\n\nIn her hospital room, Starr had the grim task of telling Cole that their little girl had died. Cole was devastated by the news and asked Starr if the baby had been stillborn. Starr told him that their child had appeared healthy at birth but had died shortly afterwards. Cole comforted Starr as she wept over the loss of their baby. Later, the teens decided to go to Dr. Joplin's office to say goodbye to their daughter. Both were overcome with grief when they saw her still form in the bassinet. They held each other tightly as they tried to find the strength to accept the tragic loss. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie and Jared enjoyed their newfound freedom. They ran outside to breathe in the fresh air then returned to the kitchen. Natalie was furious that Tina had helped Tess, but her concern for Jessica overshadowed it. \n\n\nAt Cain's apartment, Tina watched the television with deep apprehension as the local news gave an update about the explosion at Llanfair. While Bree played nearby, Tina learned that no one had been hurt in the blast and that there had been minimal damage to Viki's home. Despite the good news, Tina was upset. She realized that her family might not be quick to forgive her for helping Tess kidnap and nearly kill Natalie and Jared.\n\n\nCain was sympathetic and invited Tina to run away with him. Although tempted, Tina declined the offer. She was prepared to face the consequences of her actions. For Sarah's sake, Tina decided to stay in Llanview. A short time later, Tina returned to Llanfair. As she stood in the kitchen, Natalie and Jared walked in. Neither looked pleased to see Tina. \n\n\nAt the vineyard's cottage, Viki and Clint walked in and found Jessica holding a baby. Jessica was disoriented and confused. Initially she had no idea where the baby was from nor how they had ended up in the cottage. Viki assumed the child was Jessica's. She gently told Jessica that Tess had reemerged as the dominant alter ego and had wrecked havoc for several months. Viki theorized that Tess had given birth before Jessica had returned to them. Jessica was stunned by the news and asked Viki how long Tess had been in control. Viki reluctantly told her daughter that Tess had appeared in July. \n\n\nJessica had a difficult time accepting that she had been \"gone\" for several months. She was also stunned to discover some of the awful things that Tess had done. While Viki tried to help Jessica accept all that had happened because of Tess, Clint called Natalie. Natalie was delighted to learn that Jessica had been found and that Natalie had a new niece. Natalie was also happy to feel as if she were a part of the family again. After Clint ended the call, Jessica and the baby were transported to the hospital via ambulance. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Viki ran into Marcie and Michael. Sensing that something was terribly wrong, Viki asked Marcie what happened. Viki was shocked when they told her that Starr's baby had died shortly after her birth. Marcie had noticed the baby that Viki had entered with and asked her whom the baby had belonged to. It was Marcie's turn to be surprised when Viki told her that Jessica had given birth to a little baby girl. \n\n\nIn Marty's bedroom, Todd was forced to face the music as Marty held him at gunpoint and demanded the truth from him. Todd was visibly uncomfortable as Marty waved the gun around, but he confessed to all of his lies and deceptions. Marty appeared overwhelmed at times. When Todd admitted that he knew about her son, Cole, and had deliberately misled Marty, she became furious. She felt that it was the ultimate betrayal. Todd explained that he had initially seen Marty as a tool to get back at those who had hurt him, but he had changed his mind after he'd fallen in love with her. \n\n\nJohn remained mostly quiet and listened as Marty confronted Todd. When Marty began talking about the baby and their intention to raise Starr's child, John spoke up. Appalled that Todd had lied about Starr's baby, John forced Todd to tell Marty that Cole was the father of Starr's child. Marty couldn't believe the lengths to which Todd had gone in order to manipulate her. Todd agreed that he had no excuse for the things that he had done to Marty and apologized profusely. He kept telling her that he loved her and that she had inspired him to be a better person, but it had little impact on Marty. \n\n\nMarty soon realized that if Todd had lied about everything else, then he might have also lied about John. John confirmed Marty's suspicions when he told her his version of events preceding the explosion that had left her with catastrophic injuries. \n\n\nSensing that Marty's hold on her control was tenuous at best, John tried to convince Marty to give him the gun. Marty ignored John's repeated requests for the gun and turned to Todd. Her disgust turned to rage when she asked Todd about the rape. Marty could only stare at Todd with horror as he admitted that he had been the ringleader of the gang that had raped her.\n\n\n",
