    "soap_central": "\n The Greenhouse Effect \n\n\nInside the greenhouse in Napa, John aimed his gun at Mitch and ordered him to put his weapon on the ground. Lowering himself gradually to the floor, Mitch fired the gun  instead, shooting Jared in the chest. Brody and John quickly tackled Mitch as Jared slumped to the ground. John handcuffed Mitch to a post and, racing over to Jared, Brody took off his jacket and began to apply pressure to Jared's wound.\n\n\nNatalie urged her husband to stay with them as they waited for an ambulance and the local police. Jessica offered to return to the area closest to the house to wait for the ambulance, so that she could direct them to the greenhouse. \"And I have risen again,\" shouted Mitch, declaring that he was Natalie's husband. Calling him a monster, Natalie began to have a shouting match with the ranting and raving Mitch. John, having heard enough, walked over to Mitch and knocked him out with one swift punch. \"Just don't leave me,\" Natalie begged Jared.\n\n\nCharlie and Viki arrived at the vineyard in Napa and found the unconscious policemen. Stooping to the ground, Charlie picked up Jessica's cell phone. They were frantic and didn't know where to turn. As they pondered their next move, Jessica ran towards them and, out of breath, filled them in on the events in the greenhouse. Charlie took off in that direction and Jessica remained to wait for the ambulance.\n\n\nShe advised a clearly disbelieving Viki that Mitch was in the greenhouse and was the person behind all that had happened. She avoided telling her mother the reason behind Mitch's blackmailing of Jared at first, but at Viki's insistence, Jessica admitted that apparently, Charlie was a murderer. While Viki was incredulous, Jessica admitted that Jared thought it was the truth. When the ambulance arrived, Jessica directed the driver to the greenhouse and then she and Viki took off on foot behind it.\n\n\nBack in the greenhouse,  Natalie continued to apply pressure to Jared's wound. He began to mutter her name. Charlie arrived and when Jared saw him, he told his dad, \"I did it for you.\" Charlie was clearly confused as John assured an awakened Mitch that he would love prison. When Viki arrived at the greenhouse, her eyes landed on Mitch. \n\n\n\"Hello Viki, so nice to see you again,\" Mitch said in his spine-chilling manner. \"You belong in hell,\" Viki responded to him. As Jared was picked up and loaded into the ambulance, Mitch began to wave. \"Bye, bye, Jared,\" he called. Natalie climbed on board the ambulance with Jared, reassuring him that he would recover.\n\n\nOn the airplane headed for Seattle, Nora and Bo hoped they arrived in time to stop their son from having his surgery. Bo suspected that it was possible that Dr. Nance had lied about not seeing Matthew at the hospital. Nora thought that if she were superstitious, she would believe it was fate stepping in to halt her disclosure of her newly found relationship with Bo to Clint.\n\n\nElsewhere on the airplane, T\u00e9a and Elijah bickered about T\u00e9a hiding Danielle's true background from her unsuspecting father, Todd, while keeping her from Ross, the father she already knew. She noted that there were plenty of reasons to keep a father from his daughter. Elijah berated T\u00e9a for keeping so many secrets that seemingly only benefited her. He felt that she should introduce Danielle to Todd. T\u00e9a was afraid that Todd would only believe whatever Blair told him, like he did when he heard about the money scam Ross and T\u00e9a were allegedly conducting.\n\n\nElijah pointed out that T\u00e9a was not a shark in her private life like she was in her professional one. T\u00e9a replied that while she was never afraid of a fight, Todd was a war and a losing battle to boot. Elijah urged her to fight for Todd, not with him. He was concerned about T\u00e9a, though she was immediately suspicious. She had been stabbed in the back one too many times, she explained to him.\n\n\nLoathe to take Elijah's advice, T\u00e9a informed him that Blair had already won.\n\n\nAt the hospital in Seattle, Matthew was getting edgy as he waited for Dr. Nance at the nurses' station. Danielle assured him that it was probably due to lots of paperwork, but she would be around waiting for him after the surgery. A disappointed Matthew longed for his own family to be there. As if on cue, Dr. Nance returned, citing the vast amount of paperwork that still had to be completed. Matthew took the papers, and he and Danielle moved out of the way to finish them off.\n\n\nMarcie McBain walked off of the elevator and greeted her husband, Michael, who was employed at the hospital. They talked about her trip to Llanview, but were interrupted when Michael received a call from Bo. Michael agreed to do his best to stall Matthew's surgery until Bo and Nora arrived from the airport. When Dr. Nance advised Matthew that it was time to be prepped, the boy turned and spotted the McBains. Marcie and Michael did their best to linger and make small talk, but Dr. Nance advised Matthew that it was time to go. Suddenly, Marcie grabbed her stomach and fell forward, announcing that she was in labor.\n\n\nMichael convinced Nance that his help was needed, and they escorted Marcie to a nearby examination room. An unhappy Matthew gave his consent, noting that he had waited so long for the surgery that another few minutes wouldn't matter. A short time later, Marcie and the doctors emerged, with Marcie confessing that she had been in false labor. Dr. Nance headed towards surgery with Matthew and Danielle. Marcie apologized to Michael, admitting that she couldn't carry through with the lie after there was talk of fetal monitors being hooked up.\n\n\nAs Matthew was about to be prepared for surgery, Danielle took his lucky sneakers and advised him she'd be waiting. Marcie doubled over in pain and told her shocked husband that she was really in labor.\n\n\nBack in Llanview, Destiny arrived at Todd's house looking for Shaun. She grudgingly admitted that she had been in London, not in Washington, DC, as everyone had presumed. Upon questioning from Shaun, she confessed to taking money from her savings, and she assured him that David had accompanied her and looked out for her, which did nothing to soothe Shaun's uneasiness. She explained that she had encountered Matthew, but a friend at his new school was helping him to escape to Seattle. She wanted Shaun to speak to Greg and ask him to perform Matthew's surgery, since Greg would be far superior to Dr. Nance. Greg had saved Shaun's life, she reminded her brother.\n\n\nDeclaring that he would never be speaking to Greg again, a sneering Shaun shocked Destiny with his bitterness and anger. She suggested that maybe Rachel could help, but Shaun hastily shot her down, advising her that \"Rachel is what happened between us.\" Destiny, shocked, listened as her brother gruffly stated that Rachel was never his woman and that his coma was a result of Greg's doing, so that Greg could have Rachel for himself. It was possible that Rachel was in on it, too, he added. Destiny disputed his remark, believing that neither Rachel nor Greg would ever be in on something so callous.\n\n\nShaun urged his little sister to speak to Greg herself, because he would not be going with her. Destiny walked out, exclaiming that Shaun could stay behind and feel sorry for himself.\n\n\nRachel paid a visit to Greg at the Palace Hotel, but it was only to say goodbye, as she divulged that she could not be with him and she was leaving. He was unable to talk her out of it as she explained that her home was in Chicago, and that she had merely arrived in Llanview to help with Matthew, who was no longer there. She mostly appreciated Greg's helping her to find her true self, and she wanted to let him know.\n\n\nGreg did his best to get Rachel to change her mind, but she insisted that she would not hurt Shaun and didn't want to get between the brothers. Greg felt strongly that his family would survive Rachel's choice, as worse things had happened over the years. He was sure that he would be able to talk to Shaun, as well. He leaned forward to kiss her, as Destiny showed up at the door. \"So it's true,\" she pronounced. Before Greg and Rachel could talk, Destiny admitted that she had no time to be angry, because she was there to help Matthew.\n\n\nShe made her plea to Greg to head to Seattle to perform Matthew's surgery, but Greg refused. He was not planning on operating and was certain that Dr. Nance would be fine. He wouldn't be able to trust himself, he advised his sister. \"Do it for me,\" a booming voice called from the door, as Shaun walked in. \"You owe me.\"\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Todd grabbed and threw Ross to the floor, as Ross appeared to go after Blair in her bedroom. Todd wondered why Ross was there, and tried to get information from Ross on T\u00e9a's activities in London with Elijah. As Ross began to enlighten Todd, a nervous Blair, still trying to hide the truth from both men, began to weave a story about T\u00e9a dating Elijah and pulling a scam on both Ross and Todd.   Todd received a phone call and stepped out of the room, which interrupted Blair's ploy.\n\n\nBlair assured Ross that she was on his side and would help him to locate his daughter. She thought that if Todd found out about T\u00e9a's daughter, he would feel sorry for T\u00e9a and help to keep Danielle away from Ross. She thought that they couldn't let that happen, and she, like Ross, didn't want Todd and T\u00e9a to be together. Todd learned that T\u00e9a and Elijah were headed to Seattle. Todd headed back into Blair's bedroom and she pretended to be kicking Ross out. Ross retorted that he had heard what she said. Todd asked Blair to take their kids back a few days early, as he had to head out of town.\n\n\nBlair did her best to prevent Todd from leaving town and reminded him that T\u00e9a had moved on to another man. He admitted that he didn't believe any of the stories about Ross and T\u00e9a scamming him for money or anything else he had heard about T\u00e9a recently. He wanted the truth, and was heading to Seattle. Blair finally succeeded when she advised him that T\u00e9a didn't need him, but his children and family did. Todd agreed to stay put.\n\n\n",
