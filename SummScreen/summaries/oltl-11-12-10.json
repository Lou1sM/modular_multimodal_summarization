Starr began to rip off their clothes and begged James to make love to her.  James pleaded with Starr to slow down and related that they should just talk.  Starr informed James that Cole had wanted for Starr to be with James.\n\n\nJames insisted that Starr was not ready to be together with him, and that she did not want to just start something new.  But Starr claimed that Cole had asked her to forget about Cole and to be with James.  James stressed that he wanted Starr, but not when her heart was broken over Cole.\n\n\nStarr then yelled that she wanted no part of James, and that she just wanted her life back with Cole and with her friends, Langston and Markko.  Starr screamed to know if James could give that to her.  Starr then demanded that James get out, because she exclaimed that she never wanted to see him again.  When Starr continued to cry and plead with James to leave, James hugged her.\n\n\nStarr apologized to James.  She realized that James had been good to her, and that she was actually sad about the fact that Hope had lost her father.  Starr cried, \"It's over,\" and claimed that she did not blame Cole about what had happened.  However, Starr remembered that Cole had stolen a gun and had shot Eli Clarke.  She yelled, \"Why?  Why would he do that?  He ruined his life, and now I have to raise Hope on my own without him -- for what?\"  Starr declared that she was very angry and threw the photo album of her family across the room.\n\n\nStarr blared, \"I can't even hate him, because I love him.\"  Starr considered that Cole could be a totally different person, once he was released from prison.  Starr recognized that she was still angry that Cole had shot Eli Clarke, and that she was alone.  James simply stated, \"Hey, you're not alone.\"\n\n\nAt Todd and T\u00e9a's celebration, Marty told Natalie and John that she had found a way to cope with Cole's loss.  Marty announced to John, \"You're girlfriend is a liar.\"  Natalie insisted that John and Natalie just say goodnight, but John wanted to know why Marty thought that Natalie was a liar.  Marty revealed that she had proof, held out an envelope, and stated, \"Well, it turns out, she's only honest, when it suits her.\"\n\n\nNatalie demanded to know how Marty had retrieved her medical records, and Marty stated that they had probably fallen on her desk accidentally.  Marty insisted that John review the record, however, John refused to even look at the form.  John begged Marty to \"let your anger at Natalie go\" and insisted that the evidence had actually sent Cole to prison.\n\n\nMarty exclaimed that John did not deserve Natalie's lies.  When Marty stated that she cared about John, he replied that he cared about Marty also.  John felt that Marty had lost a lot in such a short period of time, and that had caused her anger.  When John asked Marty if she was okay, Marty insisted that she was always okay and turned to leave.  Natalie grabbed Marty's arm and demanded that Marty stay out of her personal files.  Marty left, and Natalie told John that she was exhausted.  Natalie and John agreed to \"go home.\"\n\n\nAt the apartment, John insisted that Natalie \"let it go.\"  When Natalie feared that Marty had ruined the night, John commented, \"Who says it's ruined?  Hmm?\"  They laughed, and as John drew Natalie into his arms, he insisted, \"Nobody's spoiling what we've got.\"\n\n\nAs Marty sat in a chair at her place, she voiced, \"Natalie obviously doesn't know who the father of her baby is.  How could she cheat on John?  Well, he'll know the truth soon enough.\"  Marty picked up Cole's photo and declared, \"She took you away from me.  So, it's only fair that she loses John.\"\n\n\nAlso at the party, Dorian announced that Langston wanted nothing to do with Bobby Ford, however, Langston declared that Dorian's statement was not true.  Langston demanded that Dorian not speak for her, but Dorian reminded Langston that she had made a vow to the Cramer women that she was over Ford.  Dorian also insisted that Langston be with Starr during Cole and Starr's crisis.\n\n\nDorian then proclaimed that Ford did not have relationships; he had conquests.  Bobby insisted that Dorian back off and let Langston speak for herself.  Dorian warned, \"Young man, you have no idea with whom you are dealing.\"\n\n\nFord maintained that Dorian should \"back off,\" and Dorian exclaimed that she would protect Langston with her life.  Dorian then threatened Ford to have her security guards \"break that terrific jaw of yours with one punch.\"  Langston believed that Dorian was the one who had gotten someone to beat Ford up.  Bobby revealed that Dorian had not been the one, when a waiter walked by and called Mayor Lord aside.\n\n\nLangston declared that she still had feeling for Ford, and Bobby asked Langston if they could start over.  Langston responded, \"I don't know, Ford.\"  Langston realized that Dorian had been right, and that Langston and Ford had hurt each other.  Langston also knew that she wanted a relationship.  Ford revealed that he had never been in a real relationship, but that he would rethink things for Langston.  Bobby kissed Langston on the forehead and said, \"See you soon,\" before he walked away.\n\n\nIn a Paris, France, restaurant, after they drank champagne, Gigi and Cristian kissed.  A waiter walked by and accidentally knocked Gigi out of Cristian's arms.  When Gigi questioned what the kiss had been about, Cristian and Gigi both agreed that the champagne had caused the kiss.  Cristian asked, \"What do you say we go back to my room, rip off all our clothes, and have wild French sex?\"\n\n\nCristian whined that Layla had dumped him for \"some Milanese male models\" and thought that the Paris room should not \"go to waste.\"  Gigi agreed and believed that their use of the room would serve Rex right.  Gigi felt that if Rex could sleep with Kelly, then Gigi could sleep with Cristian.  Cristian drunkenly agreed that it would serve Layla right, also, since Layla had her Maltese -- or rather Milanese models.  Cristian asked Gigi again if she wanted to \"do it.\"\n\n\nGigi swore that Cristian was \"ten times handsomer than any Milanese male model.\"  But Gigi also believed that Cristian was in love with Layla.  After Cristian admitted that he missed Layla, Gigi stated that she had to say no to his proposal.  Cristian insisted that Rex was a very lucky guy and thanked Gigi for stopping him from doing something stupid.\n\n\nOutside of Todd and T\u00e9a's party, Kelly pulled herself out of Rex's arms and yelled, \"What the hell was that?\"  When Rex reminded Kelly that she had kissed him, Kelly noted that Rex had not tried to stop her.  Rex felt that the kiss had been an impulse and then questioned where Echo was.\n\n\nRex regretted that he had kissed Kelly and wondered if Gigi was after a French guy because she was mad at him.  Rex speculated, \"I can see her now, sitting on the lap of some champagne-swilling, beret-sporting, frog-eating French guy in a caf\u00e9 on the French Bank.\"  Kelly corrected Rex and told him that the caf\u00e9 would actually be on the Left Bank.  Kelly then doubted that Gigi would do that.  However, Rex declared that Gigi could be stubborn, and that she might do it just to get back at him.\n\n\nWhen Rex and Kelly discussed their kiss, Rex stressed, \"You've got an awesome career.  You've got a smokin' body -- in or out of a towel.\"  However, Rex thought that Kelly was lonely, because she had \"no guy,\" which also made her \"drifty.\"  After Kelly agreed that she was \"drifty,\" Rex told her that a relationship would happen, once she figured out what she wanted.\n\n\nKelly realized that Rex was \"a pretty terrific guy\" and regretted that he was already taken.  When Kelly suggested that they call it a night, Rex told Kelly that he would help her find her perfect man.  Kelly sadly informed Rex that she had already found him, and that he had been her first love, Joey Buchanan.\n\n\nKelly described her past relationship with Joey.  Kelly had once had a crush on David Vickers, who had been rather good-looking at the time, and had decided to throw herself at Joey to make David jealous.  Kelly's idea had been \"to get rid of\" her virginity, but Joey had refused, because he had been in an affair with Dorian.  Kelly declared that her life had gone south when Joey had left town.\n\n\nWhen Rex suggested that Kelly try again with Joey, Kelly believed that too much had happened, since she had been with Joey's brother.  Rex still thought that Kelly should try again, and Kelly stated that she would think about it.  Rex indicated that he should leave, and Kelly wished him luck with Gigi.\n\n\nIn the Paris hotel lobby, Gigi asked if Cristian thought she was sexy, and Cristian insisted that Gigi was very sexy.  Cristian pointed out that Rex knew it too.  As Gigi lay on the sofa in the lobby, Cristian called Layla and left a message.  \"Hey, it's me.  I wish you were here.  I wish you had picked up.  I wanted to say this to you and not to your voicemail.  I love you, Layla, and I'm really sorry about the fight.  I really am.\"  Gigi then dialed Rex's number.\n\n\nInside, at the celebration, Bo and Nora danced, and Bo apologized to Nora.  Bo explained that Inez had asked for Bo to talk to her ex-husband, Eddie.  Nora then spotted the District Attorney and slyly hinted that she might have to show the handsome new D.A. how to work the copy machine.  However, Bo insisted that he be the one to show Nora the toner.  They laughed, as Bo swung her around in his arms on the dance floor.\n\n\nClint told Inez that he was sorry that he had been away for so long, and that he regretted that he had missed Dani's song.  After Inez asked, Clint remarked that everything was under control.\n\n\nInez updated Clint on the situation with her ex-husband, Eddie, and informed Bo that she did not want Eddie anywhere near her children.  When Clint expressed his desire to take care of Inez's ex, Bo wondered if Clint would \"go after the guy with a shotgun.\"  Inez stressed that she wanted Bo to handle Eddie and announced that she needed to call it a night.  As Inez left, Nora walked up and stated, \"Oh, now, now boys.  Play nice.  There's plenty of Inez to go around.\"\n\n\nAlso, at the party, Viki and Charlie demanded that Echo tell them who Rex's parents were.  Viki exclaimed that she suspected that she already knew the answer.  Echo lifted up her camera and claimed that she was just at the party to work.  Echo said, \"Smile,\" as she took Viki's picture.\n\n\nAfter Echo walked away, Viki yelled at Charlie that Echo had refused to answer her question, and that Echo had promised Rex that she would tell him about his parents.  Charlie then pointed out that Echo had promised Rex, not Viki and Charlie.  Viki cried that she wanted Charlie to talk to Echo, because \"far too many people are affected by this.\"\n\n\nCharlie confronted Echo with Viki's suspicion that Echo and Charlie were Rex Balsom's parents.  Viki revealed that she knew that Echo had been around Llanview at the time of Rex's birth.  Charlie asked Echo to admit that Rex Balsom was her son.  When Echo stated that she had pictures to take, Viki refused to let Echo leave.  Echo demanded that Viki release her arm.  As Bo and Clint walked up to them, Viki announced to Bo that Echo knew who Rex's parents were.  When Bo pondered if that was true, Clint insisted that they \"leave the poor woman alone.\"\n\n\nWhen Viki claimed, \"We have the right to know,\" Clint asked, \"Viki, what's this to you?\"  Viki explained, \"Charlie is my husband.\"  Clint wondered, \"And what's Charlie got to do with Rex Balsom?\"  Bo yelled, \"That's what I'd like to know.\"  Echo turned and screamed, \"All right.  You're right, Viki.  I am Rex Balsom's mother,\" just as Rex walked by and then glared at Echo. \n\n\n",
