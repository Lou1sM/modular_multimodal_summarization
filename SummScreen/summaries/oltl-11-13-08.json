    "soap_central": "\n Getting Mad vs. Getting Even \n\n\nCristian received custody of Vanessa and Lola, but it created new problems for Sarah. Unable to make love on the small daybed within possible earshot of the women, she reluctantly decided to head to her own apartment, alone. Regretfully, Cristian explained that he couldn't go with her, having been entrusted with the women's supervision. He wondered what had happened to Sarah's sense of adventure, but she informed him that she needed to draw the line somewhere. He promised to make it up to her. \n\n\nLater, Cristian was awakened when Vanessa arrived downstairs, allegedly in search of a glass of water. She noted that Sarah was gone and hoped she wasn't the reason. Cristian assured her she wasn't. Vanessa promised to rectify her legal situation as soon as she could. Cristian called Sarah but reached her voicemail. He said goodnight and promised that their circumstances would be better before too long. He told her he loved her. Vanessa remained on the stairs, unseen but listening. \n\n\nThere was a flurry of activity at the police station as Talia and Antonio attempted to locate information on Vanessa while Bo and Nora met to discuss the family situation at Llanfair. Nora was firm in her conviction that she needed to book Jessica on attempted murder, though she felt sure that they would never go to trial. They agreed that Jessica needed help. \n\n\nFinished with their conversation, Bo routinely checked his phone messages. \"What the hell's this,\" he growled after listening to a cryptic one from John. Nora rapidly filled him in on John's exploits, which had landed him in a jail cell, being held on contempt. Bo noted the time of the call, suggesting that John could hardly be in jail. Nora thought that perhaps it was John's one phone call. \n\n\nAntonio and Talia had little success on their search, learning that trial files were sealed in Colombia. Bo asked Antonio to check on John in his cell. To everyone's surprise, Antonio returned, not with John, but with the cop who had been on duty. The officer described how John had rigged his own hanging, only to escape, leaving him bound in the cell. He mentioned how crazy John had been, saying that \"she couldn't wait\" after a suggestion that he follow the rules. John had told him that Marty was alive, and he needed to save her. \n\n\nJessica was routinely restrained in her hospital bed, but she advised her hesitant mother that she preferred it that way in case Tess were to return. Jessica found it difficult to understand why Tess had even shown up, since she had been integrated successfully. The last thing she remembered was attending her husband's funeral and screaming at Natalie. Viki explained that it was understandable for Tess to return after Nash had died. Jessica suggested that she should apologize to Natalie and could see by her parents' reaction that something was wrong. Clint and Viki merely told her that Natalie was safe, and Jessica should focus on herself and her daughters instead.\n\n\nJessica learned that her baby was perfect. Learning that Tina was back in town, Jessica offered to reserve judgment on her aunt. Viki gave her daughter a pep talk and agreed her new battle would not be easy. \"It's like Nash died all over again,\" Jessica cried.\n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Blair and Dorian agreed that Starr needed her family, while Blair was worried about Cole. Even if the boy had Nora and John to go to, she knew that John had some unknown problem of his own involving Todd. When she learned that Todd had been to the hospital, Dorian exploded. She found it more than a coincidence that Starr's baby had died mysteriously after Todd had shown up. \n\n\nAn angry Blair was positive that Todd would never hurt a member of his family, even as Dorian mentioned Starr's falling down the steps when Todd had chased her. She also mentioned that there had been no firm reasons given for the baby's death. Blair ordered her aunt out and suggested that Dorian could hate Todd all she wanted but not around her. \n\n\nCalming down, Blair and Dorian turned the conversation back to Starr's baby. Blair couldn't understand how the baby could be gone when she had been so strong at birth. Dorian promised to get answers. Encountering Viki on her way out, Dorian received Viki's heartfelt expression of sympathy and learned of the explosion at Llanfair. Viki informed her that Jessica's baby had been born and that Jared and Natalie had been located, actually thanks to something that Dorian herself had said in their previous conversation. Viki conceded that she owed Dorian and had no doubts that Dorian would attempt to collect on it. Dorian concurred. \n\n\nJessica had a nightmare, dreaming that Niki had delivered her stillborn baby. Clint, sitting nearby, calmed his daughter down. He assured her that it was only a dream. Dorian looked for Dr. Joplin and explanations. Blair listened to John's message and unsuccessfully tried to reach him on the phone. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Tina was thrilled to learn that Natalie and Jared were in good health. \"I'll bet,\" Jared sarcastically replied. Natalie informed her aunt that she and Jared wanted to celebrate their release from their prison and that Tina's presence was hampering them. Tina wondered if Viki knew about her part in the imprisonment and her non-disclosure of Jessica's problems. Natalie advised her that Viki didn't know yet but that she would. \n\n\nAs Jared and Natalie continued to berate Tina for her nonactions in all that had occurred, Tina weakly fought back. \"I did all I could,\" she sputtered. A dumbfounded Jared couldn't believe the spin that Tina was putting on it, especially when she noted that it was actually she who had saved the couple by leading Charlie and Viki to them. It was duly noted that while Tina was Viki's sister, she was Todd's sister, as well. \n\n\nA whining Tina acknowledged that she had been a victim, too, and Tess had blackmailed her. She had other issues like David Vickers being kidnapped, but had returned as soon as she could, she continued. Her prime motive for her actions had been to protect her daughter, Sarah. Tina offered to do anything she could to make it up to Natalie and Jared. Natalie had the perfect suggestion for her aunt. She wanted Tina to leave town right away and expected her to be gone by the time Natalie was finished with her bath. As Tina deliberated her next move, Viki returned home. \n\n\nAs Marty gasped for air and tried to steady herself, Todd not only admitted to having raped her but to being the ringleader of the others and hurting her the most. Turning the tables, Todd insisted that she could have found out everything earlier. He reminded her of how he had asked her to leave and how she could have read the names on the computer. He felt that a part of him had always wanted her to know the truth, but he insisted that she made him a new man, something that his new face couldn't even do. John remained silent as the confrontation continued. \n\n\nInsisting that even Marty had seen him change, Todd suggested that it was a \"weird twist of fate\" that they were together. John quickly piped up that it was a kidnapping. Ignoring John, Todd admitted again that he had planned to use Marty at first, but he was no longer the man that had raped her. He had changed because of her, and she let him be good to her. He added that every time she smiled, it took away some of the pain he had carried with him. He could be different because she could love him or care about him, and their night together wouldn't have happened otherwise, he persisted. \n\n\nMarty's response indicated otherwise, as she told Todd he was living in a fantasy world and that he had used her. \"You raped me all over again,\" she seethed. Finally, a perplexed and then enraged John, having heard enough, grabbed Todd and began to beat him, punching and kicking him mercilessly. He pulled his gun on Todd once the man was unable to get up.\n\n\nTodd urged John to pull the trigger. John had other ideas, noting that he was taking Todd to the police station to be charged with kidnapping, unlawful restraint, and rape. \"It's over,\" John told him. \"No, it's not,\" Marty responded, training her gun on Todd.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd reveals all to Marty. John is furious to find out what Todd did. And he beats him to a bloody pulp. Dorian tells Blair she is determined to find out what happened to Starr's baby as it makes no sense that she would die. Jessica gets taken to the hospital and Viki and Clint are not certain whether to tell her all that Tess did. Natalie and Jared confront Tina for her aiding and abetting Tess in almost killing them. And Natalie tells her aunt she won't tell Viki about it if and only if Tina leaves town and never comes back. Meanwhile, Vanessa Montez is staying at Cristian's apartment. Tina concludes that there is not enough room for privacy and she has to go home. It looks like Vanessa might use that as an \"opportunity\" to be alone with Cristian.",
