Shane was elated to see Rex and quickly gave his father an update on the exciting events that had taken place in Llanview, during Rex's absence.   Rex was thrilled to be reunited with his son, but became agitated when he learned that Schuyler had accompanied Shane and Gigi to the Halloween party, in Rex's place.\n\n\nInside Schuyler's apartment, Gigi awoke with a splitting headache.   Realizing that she had fallen asleep in Schuyler's bed, Gigi panicked when she remembered that she had tried to seduce Schuyler during her drunken stupor the previous night.  After informing her that he had been a perfect gentleman and that nothing sexual had taken place between them, Schuyler related that he had phoned Noelle and made up an excuse to cover Gigi's absence.  Gigi thanked Schuyler for being a good friend and headed home.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Roxy observed Gigi, whose hair and clothing were disheveled, exiting Schuyler's apartment.   Enraged, Roxy accused Schuyler of plotting to steal Gigi away from Rex.  Schuyler made several attempts to convince Roxy that he and Gigi were only friends, but Roxy refused to believe that Schuyler wasn't attracted to Gigi.  Fed up with Roxy's accusations, Schuyler demanded that she leave his apartment.\n\n\nRex was anxious to speak with Gigi, but was alarmed when he discovered that she wasn't at home and that Noelle was taking care of Shane.  Attempting to cover for Gigi, Noelle lied and stated that Gigi had left home that morning to handle a situation that had occurred at the bar.  As a suspicious Rex questioned Noelle concerning Gigi's whereabouts, Gigi entered the cottage.\n\n\nAlone with Rex, Gigi explained that she wasn't feeling well and asked for a few moments to compose herself.   When Gigi informed Rex that Corrine had told her that Rex left town because he wanted some space, Rex stated that Corrine had lied to Gigi, just as she had lied to him.  Gigi asked Rex for answers.  Overjoyed to see Gigi, Rex promised that he would tell her everything that had taken place in Michigan, but insisted that he had some business to attend to first.\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Rex confronted a clueless Roxy and demanded to speak with her.  Roxy told Rex that she had something important to tell him, but she nearly fell over when Rex announced that he was aware that Mitch Laurence was his father.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Gigi phoned Schuyler and thanked him for his help.  Gigi wasn't pleased when Schuyler informed her that Roxy had spotted her leaving his room.\n\n\nInside the g reenhouse in Napa, a disgusted John listened to Mitch's ramblings, while awaiting the arrival of the Napa authorities.    Quoting Psalm 23, a handcuffed Mitch stated that he was reciting a prayer for the dying.  John advised Mitch that he would have more trouble to face if Jared died, but Mitch claimed that he had merely defended himself from a killer.  Mitch charged that Jared had held him captive and made Mitch watch as Jared bludgeoned Pamela Stewart to death.    Stating that he had tried to save Pamela from Jared, Mitch insisted that Jared was a killer, just like his father.   When John questioned what Mitch knew about Charlie's past, Mitch responded with a sly smile.\n\n\nJohn informed Mitch that he would be transported to Llanview to face charges involving Pamela's death.  Upon learning that John intended to also have past charges against Mitch reinstated, a confident Mitch assured John that he didn't have a case against Mitch.   With a devilish smile, Mitch exclaimed, \"I'm excited to return to Llanview! There are people there I can't wait to see!\"\n\n\nMeanwhile, in a Napa hospital, Jessica, Viki, Charlie, and Brody rushed into the emergency room and discovered Natalie screaming as she held onto Jared's bloodied body.   Before prepping Jared for surgery, the doctors allowed Natalie a moment with him.   As Jared struggled to speak, Natalie assured Jared that he would be fine.  Jared asked to speak with Charlie.\n\n\nCharlie questioned why Mitch Laurence would want to hurt Jared.   Jessica watched as Viki pulled Charlie to the side.  Charlie was puzzled when Viki informed him that Mitch had blackmailed Jared into helping him by threatening to expose Charlie as a murderer.   When Charlie denied hurting anyone, Viki assured her husband that she believed in his innocence, but insisted that it was important to learn what had caused Jared to believe Mitch's claims.  Natalie interrupted the conversation and informed Charlie that Jared had requested to see him.\n\n\nCharlie entered Jared's hospital room and told his son that he loved him.  Holding Jared's hand, Charlie questioned why Jared would believe Mitch's accusation.  To Charlie's horror, Jared stated that Charlie had murdered Jared's stepfather when Jared was a child.  Charlie admitted that he had hated Jared's stepfather but was adamant that he hadn't committed any crime against the man.\n\n\nJared related that many years before, a drunken Charlie had showed up on their doorstep and became involved in an altercation with Jared's stepfather.  After receiving a blow to the head from Charlie, the man  hit his head and later died.  Jared stated that Charlie never knew what had happened.  Jared's mother and Pamela had lied to the police and the crime had been ruled an accident.  \n\n\nCharlie questioned why Jared had never mentioned that fateful night.  Reminding Charlie that they had become close, Jared stated that Charlie was doing well, and that Jared didn't want to risk Charlie's recovery by telling him about the past.   Charlie was horrified.  Jared also related that during his time in prison, he was consumed with hatred for Charlie and had told another prison inmate, Wayne Landers, about the crime.  Landers had threatened to use the information against Charlie unless Jared did his bidding.\n\n\nIn the waiting area, Viki was alarmed when Charlie exited Jared's room.  As Natalie returned to be by Jared's bedside, Charlie told Viki what Jared had revealed to him.  Insisting that he didn't remember the incident, Charlie was devastated at the thought that he had killed someone.  He blamed himself for nearly causing his son's death, as well.  Viki tried to console her husband.\n\n\nBack inside Jared's room, Jared apologized to Natalie.  Jared regretted that he hadn't told Natalie the truth.  Holding him close, Natalie stated, \"Just promise me that you will tell me everything next time!\"  Gasping for breath, Jared, murmured, \"I don't think there's going to be a next time.\"  Instantly, Jared lost consciousness and his heart began to fail.\n\n\nInside a Seattle hospital, Bo and Nora demanded that the hospital administrator stop Matthew's surgery.  The hospital administrator advised Matthew's parents that they had no legal right to stop the surgery, and reminded Bo and Nora that a court order existed that granted Matthew the right to have the surgery performed.   Glaring at T\u00e9a , Nora insisted that she held T\u00e9a responsible.\n\n\nMeanwhile, T\u00e9a chastised Danielle about running away from the boarding school.   Blaming her mother for keeping her away from her father, Danielle stated that T\u00e9a no longer controlled her life.   Danielle related that she intended to travel to Tahiti to see her father, after Matthew recovered from his surgery.  Citing Matthew's relationship with his parents, Danielle warned her mother that she would lose Danielle the same way.\n\n\nUnable to reason with Danielle, T\u00e9a approached Nora and apologized for helping Matthew obtain the court order.  T\u00e9a stated that she would pray for Matthew and offered Nora her friendship.  Nora refused to accept T\u00e9a's apology and questioned her parenting skills.  Reminding T\u00e9a that her daughter was alive and well, Nora stated that she didn't know what the future held for Matthew because of T\u00e9a's interference.  A guilty T\u00e9a admitted that she was to blame, and walked away.\n\n\nElijah approached Danielle and demanded that the teen listen to him.  A defiant Danielle listened as   Elijah related that T\u00e9a was simply trying to protect Danielle from Ross.\n\n\nT\u00e9a advised her daughter to give the Matthew's parents a few moments alone as they awaited word on Matthew's surgery.  Mother and daughter relocated to another section of the hospital.\n\n\nNearby, in the maternity ward, Michael stood by Marcie's side as she went into labor.  Experiencing painful contractions, Marcie insisted that she wasn't ready to give birth and begged the doctor to stop the labor.  Michael and Marcie's doctor told Marcie that she would be fine and that the baby was on the way.\n\n\nLater, Marcie and Michael beamed with joy as they held their baby boy.  Declaring that he was an angel, Marcie decided to name her son Gabriel.\n\n\nAs John continued to listen to Mitch's claims that Jared was a murderer, he received a phone call from Michael.  Upon learning about the birth of his nephew, John promised to visit his family in Seattle, but insisted that he had a job to complete first.  John gave Mitch a hateful look.\n\n\nBack at the hospital in Seattle, Dr. Nance approached Bo and Nora and advised them that he had some bad news. \n\n\nInside the emergency room in the Napa Hospital, Natalie and Charlie panicked when the doctor informed the family that they had discovered that the bullet was lodged in Jared's heart.  Jared was dead. \n\n\n",
