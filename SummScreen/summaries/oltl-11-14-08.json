While Jared was excited to have escaped with their lives, Natalie was thankful that Jessica was safe, Tina planned to leave town, and Viki would never learn the truth about her sister's part in Tess's plot. Natalie prayed that Jessica would forgive them for Nash's death. Amazed at Natalie's love for her sister, Jared gave her a loving kiss, and the two made love. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Viki, who had returned home to check on Natalie and Bree, encountered Tina. Viki informed Tina that Jessica had given birth and had been temporarily committed to the psychiatric ward. After Viki thanked Tina for being present during the family crisis, Tina startled her with news that she intended to leave town that night. Reminding Tina that Sarah needed her, Viki begged her sister to reconsider and remain at Llanfair. As Viki insisted that she was thrilled with having Tina back and thanked her for picking the lock and helping save Natalie and Jared, Tina shocked Viki when she blurted out that she had helped Tess trap Natalie and Jared in the basement and had done nothing to alert anyone. \n\n\nAmazed that Tina would join forces with Tess, Viki blamed her for allowing Natalie and Jared to remain in the basement and nearly meet their demise. Unwilling to accept responsibility for her actions, Tina insisted that Tess had blackmailed her with threats of Carlo killing Sarah if Tina didn't cooperate with her. A disgusted Viki told her sister that she thought that Tina had finally changed and had done something selfless for once. Viki wondered if Tina had intended on leaving town without ever revealing the truth. Hoping to change Viki's opinion of her, Tina announced that Natalie had requested that she leave town without any mention of her actions and stated that she felt that Viki needed to know the truth. Lashing out at her sister, Viki demanded that Tina leave Llanfair and never return. \n\n\nIn Starr's hospital room, Blair tried her best to console Starr and Cole as the teens grieved the loss of their child. Cole asked Blair if baby Hope could be buried next to his mother's grave. Starr insisted that Marcie be included in the discussion. After Cole left to locate Marcie, Starr told Blair that she needed to speak with Todd and tell him about the baby. Stating that Todd would only make matters worse, Blair discouraged Starr from phoning her father but soon gave in. \n\n\nMichael approached Marcie outside the maternity ward, gazing at  Brennan through the window. As Marcie admired Jessica's beautiful baby, Mike suggested that she leave. Realizing that Mike feared she might kidnap the child, Marcie assured him that she wasn't capable of committing such an act again. A worried Mike expressed that he was concerned about Marcie. Cole interrupted the discussion and told Marcie that Starr wanted to speak with her. \n\n\nAlone with Mike, Cole admitted to having a difficult time accepting the death of his child. Stating that he needed time to accept the tragedy, Cole didn't want to explain what had happened to everyone. He was certain that Todd would fault him for the child's death. With a sigh of relief, Cole admitted to being grateful that he didn't have to explain the baby's death to his mother. \n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, Bo, Nora, Antonio, and Talia were alarmed to learn that John had mentioned that Marty was alive and residing at Todd's home. Although Antonio, Talia, and Nora feared that John had possibly lost touch with reality, Bo believed that John's suspicions might be correct. \n\n\nAfter placing several calls, Nora discovered that a witness had gone before the judge and had identified Marty as the woman living in Todd's home. Upon learning that the witness had placed Marty at Todd's home, Bo began to doubt that Marty might be alive and that Todd was capable of hurting her again. Bo believed that Todd would never consider harming Marty after his past violent acts against her and felt that Marty would fight for her life if Todd ever attempted to harm her.\n\n\nBo suggested that if Marty was actually alive, perhaps Todd wasn't holding her against her will. Reminding Bo that Todd had held hostages in the past, Nora believed that Marty might be unable to fight Todd off due to the injuries she'd suffered as a result of her accident. \n\n\nWhile Marty held a bloody Todd at gunpoint, John tried to convince Marty to phone the police and leave with him. Refusing to be the victim, Marty declared, \"It's not over until I say so!\" As John continued to plead with Marty to put down the gun, Marty took great pleasure in terrorizing Todd. John told her that she would regret her actions and could get her life back if she did the right thing. Marty continued to contemplate ways to kill Todd and get away with it.\n\n\nWhen John announced that he was calling the police, Marty stated that Todd would get away with his crimes, just as he had done in the past. As John convinced Marty to allow him to contact the authorities, a badly beaten Todd spoke up and begged Marty to kill him because he deserved it. Marty continued to point the weapon at him. \n\n\nStarr phoned Todd but received no answer. Attempting to soothe Starr, Blair turned on the radio. A special news bulletin announced that John had escaped from jail. After Starr encouraged her mother to go to the police station and check on John, Marcie paid Starr a visit. A guilt-ridden Starr apologized to Marcie for losing the baby. Thanking Starr for allowing her to participate in the development and delivery of her child, Marcie promised Starr that she would find a way to recover from the loss.\n\n\nWhen Starr noticed a case that Marcie was holding, Marcie told her that it contained a locket. Marcie said that she had planned to place a lock of the baby's hair inside and give it to Starr. Marcie had wanted Starr to always be close to the baby. The two shared an embrace. \n\n\nBack at Todd's home, Marty still wanted to kill Todd for deceiving her. As Todd's cell phone rang, Marty teased him about being a victim and being unable to receive help. John told Marty that she wasn't a killer, but Marty sadly stated that she wasn't sure of whom she was. Trembling, Marty continued to point the weapon at Todd and asked John to tell her what he knew about her. John told Marty that she was a wonderful person.\n\n\nMarty wanted to know why John wanted to spare Todd's life. John said that he didn't care about Todd and was only concerned about the impact it would have on her. When Marty replied that she wasn't worth saving, John reminded her that she had a son to consider. The mention of her son sent Marty in a rage. Marty was livid that Todd had lied about her child's existence.\n\n\nJohn pleaded with Marty to think about her future and asked her to withdraw the weapon. Insisting that Todd would win if she killed him, John begged Marty not to allow Todd to take anything else from her. In tears, Marty dropped the gun and ran downstairs. As Todd lay helpless on the floor, John ran after Marty. \n\n\nAs John helped Marty down the stairs, Antonio, Talia, and a team of officers entered the home with their weapons drawn. Antonio expressed his surprise at discovering Marty, but she looked dazed and confused. John explained that Marty had lost her memory, and sent Antonio upstairs to read Todd his Miranda Rights. Suggesting that Marty needed to go to the hospital for a checkup, John offered to accompany her, but Talia told him that he was under arrest. \n\n\nUpstairs, Antonio discovered that Todd had suffered serious injuries. After requesting that an ambulance transport Todd to the hospital, Antonio asked Todd who had beaten him. In a weak voice, Todd replied, \"I did!\" \n\n\nSeeking information about John, Blair showed up at the police station. When Bo refused to give Blair any information, she related that she had information that he could possibly use. Stating that John had informed her that he was working on a case concerning Todd, Blair didn't think it was possible that Todd could have committed a crime more dastardly than he had already. \n\n\nStarr opened Marcie's locket and cried when she thought about her baby. \n\n\nHand in hand, Marcie and Mike left the hospital. \n\n\nA sadden Tina packed her bags and left Llanfair. In disgust, Viki watched her leave. After, Viki broke down in tears as she thought about her sister. \n\n\nA bloodied Todd was transported to the hospital. \n\n\nLeaving the station, Blair encountered a handcuffed John being led into Bo's office. \n\n\nAs Marty and Talia entered the hospital, Cole walked around the corner. Cole and Marty stood face-to-face. While a look of shock crossed Cole's face, Marty gave him a blank stare.\n\n\n",
