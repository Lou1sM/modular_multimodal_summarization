And she brings it to Natalie who is shocked and devastated. Brody is very worried that this will mean he will lose Liam so he urges everybody to believe the document must be fake. But they realize that Victor must have known about it and that is why Brody threatened to kill him. Natalie then realizes that Marty switched the DNA results to break up Natalie and John, confessed that to her shrink and Brody heard the tape recording and erased it in order to lie about Liam being his. Meanwhile Jessica stays home and goes to talk to Robert Ford about the situation. They grow closer. He doesn't want her to leave and kisses her. And the two of them wonder if they should remain friends or become more than that to each other. Natalie rushes to find John before it's too late. Rex comes with her. Not far away Gigi/Stacy is there with Cutter attempting to catch a flight to a far away place to get the surgery because she does not want to \"scam\" Rex and Shane into believing she's Gigi when she's not."
