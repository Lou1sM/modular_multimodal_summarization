He tells her she's lucky just to be with him, considering he alone won the football game.  As Langston searches for her friend, she runs into Gabe, nursing his wounds after a fight with the star football player. He alludes to the fact that Cole is uptight and raging but refuses to provide any more details.  Starr finally manages to get out of the bedroom and away from Cole. Britney suggests that both Starr and Cole are on drugs and after seeing Starr's ripped shirt and the disarray in the bedroom, forms a new plan. She calls 9-1-1 and pretending to be Starr, pleads for help, stating that Cole is high and attacked her.  When the cops show up and ask for her, Starr pulls Langston aside to hide. They remove Cole from the party.\n\n\nDavid discloses that he's leaving Llanview, when Clint comes across him at the pier. He announces that he's handing Dorian off to him. Clint, in turn, finds it hard to believe that he would ever be with Dorian and Asa would prefer that he not. He's certainly too old to be taking orders from his father though. The men have an actual decent conversation, with David lamenting the fact that he didn't have a family like the Buchanans. Perhaps he would have turned out differently, he expresses. Clint makes it known that the family is very grateful to David for going against Spencer. David feels that they have more in common than they thought.\n\n\nWhen Rex arrives at his place with Adriana, he finds the door unlocked. Pushing her aside, he sneaks inside, only to have a blanket dropped on him. Wrestling it off, he finds Roxy, who thought he was a burglar. She had a key and was thirsty, the liquor store was closed, and so she found her way to his place. Rex makes a multitude of attempts to get her to leave, but is thwarted at every turn. The three end up playing a game that Roxy finds in the closet, but when some of the playing becomes heated (it's a game of ethics and morals), it's time for the fun and games to be over. He finally gets his mother to leave and he and Adriana have a game of their own.\n\n\nTodd admits to Evangeline that he knew of Vincent's plan about an hour prior to the fight. Evangeline is astonished to hear that her so-called friend did nothing and did not come to her. It's even worse when he admits to betting against Cris and no amount of apologizing will get Evangeline to forgive him. Cris hears the conversation and comes over to join in, which annoys Todd. They are curious as to how much money Todd made, but when he claims to have forgotten, their anger is only increased. The money was so important that he went against his friendship and Cris' life, reputation and career, but now he doesn't know how much money he made? Evangeline reminds him of the hell she went through for him and the risks she took. She informs Todd that they are not friends and never were. She's actually saddened. Todd, on the other hand, doesn't understand why Evangeline is angry. When she stalks out, Cris speaks to Todd alone. He knows why Todd never mentioned it; it's because he's in love with Evangeline. He's also been using Evangeline to get to Blair. Todd denies everything and in return, accuses Cris of being afraid to lose Evangeline to him. Cris assures him that Evangeline will get over it all. They accuse each other of being deluded. Todd has gone too far this time, Cris warns him. If Evangeline did have any feelings before, rest assured, they're gone now. Later, Todd tries to call Evangeline but she won't answer his call. He also calls to check on Starr and she lies and mentions that she's at Langston's house. She had a great time at the party, she continues.\n\n\nNat is totally disbelieving when she finally allows Vincent to continue, when she hears him say that John is alive. He's actually in Hugh's bed, he answers to her question. It's not Hugh who is there. He tells her about the different eye colors, how the patient said, \"My name is John,\" and how he grabbed his arm when he mentioned kissing Nat. Sure, it could be another John, he responds to her further questioning. She describes how John was identified; by tattoo (but Hugh also had one) and the St. Jude's medal in his hand (which Vincent can't explain). Also, his badge was lying nearby. She needs to see him for herself and they take off for the hospital. Once there, Vincent tries to stop Nat from charging in, but she does, and the bed is empty. Bo and Paige are there and wonder why she's so upset. They mention that Hugh has been taken to surgery for a risky skin graft operation. She asks to speak to Bo alone, outside of the hospital, but he's hesitant to leave Paige alone. The surgery is dangerous and if something happens, they need to be there. Nat is ready to charge into the operating room, to demand a DNA test or to tell them that she has a warrant. She's frantic, but Vincent tries to make her see how none of that would be possible. What if he dies on the operating table? Vincent states what may be the obvious; that Hugh is buried in John's grave. Suddenly, Natalie asks to be driven to her car. He leaves her and she heads for the cemetery, where she begins to dig up the gravesite!\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Cole tears the room apart as Starr watching terrified. \"What is wrong with you?\" Turns out that he can't deal with the fact that she doesn't want to go to bed with him. \"You stuck up little \" She breaks away from him and runs to the door. He suddenly snaps out of it and runs after her. \"Please Starr, give me another chance.\" She looks up into his eyes terrified. Chris is at the bar and hears Todd admit that he knew that Cris was going down. \"I made a bet against him.\" Evangeline is mortified at Todd doing this when he knows what Chris means to her. \"I guess that we know what kind of person we are dealing with.\" Todd says that Chris never did anything for him so what does it matter? It mattes to Evangeline. He didn't care about what would make her happy. \"What if I did that to Blair?\" Todd tells Evangeline that she was the one who said that to be a friend was to be honest. She says they are not friends and never were. Natalie is trying to wrap her head around the idea that John could be alive. What Vincent says makes sense but she has to see for herself. She and Vincent go to the hospital but the body isn't there. Bo and Paige come in, telling that Hugh has gone for surgery. Natalie panics but then relaxes when she learns that the surgery is for skin graphing. Natalie is about to tell her uncle and Paige what Vincent has told her but he cuts her off. Paige thanks her for coming and showing her support. \"Actually, that isn't the only reason why I am here.\" Cole is out of his mind. Gabe manages to get him to settle down and go to the other end of the room. Starr's shirt if ripped but she assures Langston that it was all an accident. Britney sees the party getting out of control and has an idea on how she can kill two birds with one stone. She calls the police and tells them that there is a football player at the party named 'Cole', who is out of control. \"What? My name? I'm Starr Manning.\" The cops arrive and ask for Cole and Starr. Starr and Langston take off trying to find a way out of there but they are trapped. They hide under some furniture. Starr's phone rings. \"It's my dad!\" She talks to him in a whisper, telling him that she has to be quiet cause she is staying at a friend's place and the parents are sleeping. \"Yeah, I have fun at the party\" Natalie starts telling Paige what Vincent said, but then realizes that she can't do that to Paige. She asks her uncle to leave the hospital with her for a while but Bo wants to stay with Natalie. She runs off now, not sure what to do. She tells Vincent that she has to do something on her own. She goes to John's grave and determinedly starts digging him up!",
