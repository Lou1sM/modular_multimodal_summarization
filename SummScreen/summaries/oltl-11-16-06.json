    "soap_central": "\n\nIt was a full house at Asa's when Kevin and Kelly showed up. Kevin announced he was moving to London today. Asa observed that Kevin and Kelly were getting back together. Asa said there was no way in hell anyone was leaving today. Didn't Kevin want to see Spencer get what he deserves? Kevin promised to say goodbye to Renee before he left for London. Viki started to cry and didn't want him to go. Kevin said he couldn't have gotten through the last few years without her. Asa toasted Kevin and Kelly and little Z. \n\n\nRex found himself surrounded by babies. He thought he had a lead on Todd's son while Michael and Marcie hired him to get the 911 on their adopted one. They had a copy of his birth certificate but there were no names on it. Todd barged in and reminded Rex that he worked for him. Rex said he had to follow a lead for Todd before he could find out about little Tommy's birth parents. Rex's phone rang; it was Ms. Herman, who had been the secretary to the lawyer who had handled the adoption of Todd's son. \n\n\nEvangeline told Todd they were no longer friends. She threatened to have him arrested for impeding a police investigation. All Todd wanted was for Evangeline to forgive him. Evangeline was working on Spencer's trial. Todd said he wouldn't miss sitting in the courtroom and Evangeline begged him not to. \"Butt out,\" she said. \n\n\nSpencer wondered why he was still handcuffed in the court room. Spencer's lawyer didn't want David to testify, but David, who happened to stroll in at the time, said he wouldn't miss that opportunity for the world. Spencer reminded David that he owes him and suggested that he have a slight lapse in memory. David told Spencer that it was just cold that Spencer fooled with Thomas McBain's stitches. So not only did Spencer shoot Thomas but he made sure he didn't survive the surgery. Spencer offered David money, but Spencer's attorney butt in. Nora showed up and asked Evangeline if she was ready for this. Nora was going to be second chair. Spencer's trial began. \n\n\nVincent tried to stop Natalie from digging out the coffin. Vincent reminded her that if John was alive, that meant Hugh was dead and he wondered how would that affect Paige. Natalie began beating herself up about not knowing if the man in the bandages was John. Natalie wondered why she didn't have that connection with him anymore. \"I wasn't there for him,\" she said. Vincent tried to make her feel better. \"I need to know now,\" she cried. Vincent promised her she'd know the truth about John soon enough. Vincent wished he had waited for some more information before telling Natalie about his theory regarding John. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie has been digging all night. It is morning now and she still digs. \"What do you think you are doing?\" She turns to find Vincent standing behind her. He will not let her do this. She feels she has to do it until she finds out if her man is really dead or not. Vincent points out that if John is alive then she is digging up his friend and he just can't allow that. \"You can wait until the surgery is over to find out what you want to know! Kevin and Kelly come to visit the family at Asa's house and they tell that Kevin will be leaving for London that day. The company isn't doing well in London, so Kevin figures that he should get out there sooner. Asa understand him having to go but won't allow anyone to leave that day. Natalie isn't concerned about what she will find when she opens the coffin. She took Forensics and knows what is in there, and what to do with it. Vincent still tries to talk her out of this but she insists. She waves her shovel at him, threatening to hurt him if he doesn't back off. He offers his neck for her to lop off but also reminds her that John wouldn't approve. She isn't so sure of that. She can't wait! Vincent thinks that she is acting crazy. \"You think this is crazy? Just give me one more day of living like this and then you will see how crazy I can be.\" The family fights and fights but at the end it is accepted that Kevin has to make a move to save the branch of the family business in London. Spencer is uncomfortable. His case depends on evidence that is 25 years old which is good but then there is the gun and David's testimony. When alone with David in the courtroom before court starts, David tells how he is leaving town but only after he has put the final nail in Spencer's coffin. He intends to finish this off for John who should be there. Spencer seems afraid of what might happen in court. The really damning thing for him is David's testimony. \"Look, you owe me. Just tell them that you don't remember what happened that night.\" David will not perjure himself for his brother anymore. Spencer offers David enough money to enjoy a rich life five lifetimes more than he could ever imagine. David walks out. Natalie needs to do this but she starts calming down. \"I promise you Natalie, by the end of the day, we will know if John is alive or not!\" He suggests they go to Bo and get him to help them figure this out. She picks up her shovel and they walk off together. Michael and Marcie go to Rex and ask him to find out about Tommy's parents for his medical records. Rex accepts the case. Asa raises a glass. \"To Kevin, Kelly and Little Zane! Godspeed! To the family. God Bless!\"",
