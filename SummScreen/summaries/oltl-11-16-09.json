Roxy continued to deny having any knowledge of Mitch Laurence until Rex presented her with the birth certificate that Corrine had given him.  Refusing to reveal Rex's father's true identity, Roxy simply stated that Mitch had been dead for years.   Rex wondered why Roxy had claimed to kill Mitch.  Blurting out that she had disconnected Mitch's life support machine at the clinic, Roxy told Rex that Mitch was dead, and suggested that Rex forget about the evil man.\n\n\nPleading with Roxy to understand his position, Rex said that he couldn't drop the issue because Jessica was his sister.   Rex questioned how Mitch had impregnated her -- he wondered if she had been raped.  Rex threatened to enlist Jessica's help, but Roxy remained silent.  Unable to obtain answers from his mother, a frustrated Rex exited the hotel.  A helpless Roxy watched as her angry son stormed off.\n\n\nInside the greenhouse in Napa, Mitch congratulated John on the new addition to his family.  Watching John closely, Mitch exclaimed, \"When I'm cleared, I can't wait to be a hands-on father!\"\n\n\nJohn told Mitch that he would be prosecuted for the murders of Wayne Landers and Pamela Stewart, but Mitch was convinced that John had no evidence to support his claim.  John was appalled when Mitch stated that John was responsible for the murders.  Mitch stated that had John kept an open mind and remained detached from the case, Jared wouldn't have been shot.  Mitch insisted that John had wanted to believe that Jared was the culprit.  Mitch said that Natalie would never forgive John for Jared's death, and that John would never forgive himself.\n\n\nInside the Napa hospital, Natalie cried as the doctors informed the family that Jared was dead.  Clint, Viki, Jessica, and Brody tried to console her, but Natalie continued to scream that it was a mistake.  The doctor advised the family to say their goodbyes.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie was devastated as he observed Jared's body through the window.  Viki promised to stand by her husband's side.  While Viki comforted Charlie, Brody asked Clint to stay with Jessica while Brody placed a call to John.\n\n\nAfter relating the news to John, Brody spoke with Jessica.  Apologizing for not telling Brody that Mitch was her biological father, Jessica related that she thought Mitch was dead and that she had tried to forget about the monster.  Stating that Clint was her father, Jessica announced that Mitch Laurence would never be a part of her or Bree's lives.  Realizing that Brody had to help John with Mitch's relocation to Llanview, Jessica begged him to be careful.  Promising to return to Jessica safely, Brody admitted that he worried about John being alone with Mitch.\n\n\nUpon receiving the news from Brody about Jared's death, John informed Mitch that Mitch was responsible for yet another murder.  Mitch was confident that he wouldn't stand trial for any of the murders.  Attempting to cause John grief, a handcuffed Mitch stated that John was supposed to stop bad things from happening to good people.  John became unnerved when Mitch announced, \"You let me kill the man that Natalie loved!\"  \n\n\nAs Mitch spoke, John continued to fumble with his revolver.  Mitch related that John was known to take on the pain of helpless victims and his friends who had been wronged.  Mitch stated that John became consumed with guilt when he was unable to help a victim.  When Mitch began to rant about John causing Cai tlin's death, John became enraged and pulled his weapon on Mitch.  As John placed his gun in Mitch's back, Brody rushed into the greenhouse and screamed, \"Don't do it, John!  He's not worth it!\"\n\n\nInside Jared's hospital room, Charlie said goodbye to his son.  Alone with his son, Charlie blamed himself for causing Jared's death.    Holding Jared's hand, Charlie exclaimed, \"You died trying to protect me.   I killed you.  I failed you your whole life and I'm not going to fail you again!  If I killed that man, then I guess I'm capable of killing again!\"  Giving Jared a kiss on the forehead, Charlie told his son that he loved him. Walking toward the door, Charlie took one last look at Jared and vowed, \"I promise you that Mitch Laurence will pay for this!\"\n\n\nWhen Charlie emerged from Jared's room, Viki tried to comfort him, but Charlie rushed off to the men's room.  Later, Clint told Viki that Charlie wasn't in the men's room.  Nearby, Jessica held Natalie and appeared concerned when she observed Viki rush off.\n\n\nBack at the greenhouse, Brody convinced John not to shot Mitch.  Once John released his grip on Mitch, the rambling conman apologized to Brody for Jared's accident.  Mitch insisted that a daughter needed to have a relationship with her father, and asked Brody to allow him some time with Jessica once Mitch's ordeal was over.  At that moment, Charlie entered the greenhouse and yelled, \"What about my son?\"\n\n\nCharlie grabbed Mitch by the throat and began cho king him.  John and Brody tried to stop Charlie, but Charlie was a man on a mission.  Viki rushed into the greenhouse and was stunned when she witnessed Charlie's violent state.\n\n\nDorian, Amelia, Langston, Starr, Cole, and Markko awaited the election results at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.   As Amelia received a call from the election committee, Cole warned Markko that he had better pray that the election wasn't determined by one vote.   Everyone was stunned when Amelia announced that Viki had one the election by one vote.  Dorian demanded a recount, but Amelia related that the committee had already conducted three recounts, and that was all that the law required.   Dorian fumed when Amelia stated that the fight was over.\n\n\nLangston tried to convince Dorian that she had made history by taking a stand on gay rights, but Dorian vowed to locate the person that had betrayed her.   Dorian was adamant that she had conducted an accurate poll and was certain that she had the necessary votes to beat Viki.  A nervous Markko shook in the corner as Dorian declared, \"Some rat fink that promised me his vote, voted for Viki instead!  I'm going to find that flip-flopper and he will pay!\"\n\n\nDestiny and Shaun sat in another corner of the caf\u00e9.   Holding her cell phone close, Destiny wondered if Greg had managed to make it to the hospital in time to help Matthew.   The discussion turned to Destiny sneaking off to London with David Vickers.  Destiny believed that David truly cared about Matthew, but Shaun was convinced that David didn't care about anyone but himself.  Looking across the room at Dorian, Destiny stated that David cared about Dorian.  When Destiny told Shaun that some people were meant to be together, an emotional Shaun replied, \"I used to feel that way!\"  Realizing that her brother was consumed with thoughts of Greg and Rachel, Destiny expressed her sorrow that they had betrayed Shaun.\n\n\nMoments later, Dorian approached Shaun and Destiny and began ranting about her defeat.  To Dorian's surprise, Destiny informed Dorian that David still had feelings for her.  When Destiny suggested that Dorian phone David, Dorian made up an excuse and rushed off.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Markko admitted to Cole that he felt guilty about lying to Langston about his vote.   Cole suggested that Markko tell Langston the truth.  Alone with Langston, Markko admitted that he had voted for Viki, instead of Dorian.  Langston appeared disturbed by Markko's confession.\n\n\nNearby, Dorian informed Amelia that David was in London pining over Dorian.  A curious Amelia wondered if Dorian had plans to travel to London.\n\n\nAt the Seattle hospital, Nora and Bo were stunned when Dr. Nance announced that Matthew had survived the surgery, but things hadn't gone as well as expected.   Relating that he was unable to get a good visual, Dr. Nance stated that he didn't want to risk more damage to Matthew's spine, and suggested that Bo and Nora convince their son that life in a wheelchair was better than no life at all.    Dr. Nance apologized, but an enraged Bo physically attacked the doctor and blamed him for giving Matthew false hopes.\n\n\nAs Bo tried to choke Dr. Nance, Greg and Rachel arrived at the hospital.  After prying Bo's hands from Dr. Nance's throat, Greg received an overview of Matthew's operation.  Upon learning that Matthew was still on the operating table, Greg was convinced that he could complete the surgery.  Rachel looked on, as Nora and Bo begged Greg to help Matthew.   Racing to scrub up, Greg promised to do his best.\n\n\nIn the waiting area, Rachel explained how Destiny and Shaun had convinced Greg to operate on Matthew.  While Bo hoped that Greg wasn't too late, Rachel begged Bo to give Greg a chance.   Later, Greg emerged from the operating room with good news.  Explaining that the damage to Matthew's spinal cord hadn't been too severe, Greg related that he had been able to remove the scar tissue.  If the nerves regenerated the way they should, there was a great possibility that Matthew would walk again.  Acknowledging that Llanview Hospital had an excellent physical therapy department, Greg said that he was optimistic about Matthew's recovery.\n\n\nAfter Bo and Nora left to be by Matthew's side, Rachel thanked Greg for performing Matthew's surgery.  Admitting that he had been nervous about performing the surgery, Greg stated that he regained his confidence once he stepped foot in the operating room.  Greg said that he was thankful for Rachel and Destiny encouraging him to help Matthew, but Greg insisted that Shaun had been instrumental in Greg actually getting on the plane.\n\n\nBo and Nora smiled when their son opened his eyes.   They told him that the operation had been a success and that Greg had performed the surgery.  Matthew was pleased that his parents were by his side.   After Bo and Nora's visit with Matthew, Greg and Rachel suggested that Bo and Nora check into a nearby hotel and get some rest.  Rachel and Greg promised to phone them if there was any news.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Destiny received a call from Greg.  When she asked about Matthew's condition, Greg sent her a picture of Matthew sleeping in the recovery room.  Destiny smiled as she studied the photo of her friend.\n\n\nBack at the Napa hospital, Natalie entered Jared's room.  Stroking Jared's face, Natalie reminisced about that day in Texas when they had proclaimed their love for each other.  In tears, Natalie cried, \"I never told you, but I made a wish that I would die before you!\"\n\n\nAfter escorting Nora to her room at the hotel, Bo announced that he would be down the hall in his own room if Nora needed him.  Noticing Bo's nervousness, Nora told him that Matthew would be fine.   Displaying a loving smile, Bo asked Nora to dance with him.   As they held each other close, Bo and Nora shared a passionate kiss.  Unbeknownst to them both, Nora's cell phone rang nearby.   The caller was Clint.\n\n\nJessica watched as Clint placed a call to Nora.  Jessica wondered why Clint didn't leave a voicemail message.  Clint said that he refused to report Jared's passing and Mitch's resurrection in a voicemail.\n\n\nLater, Clint and Jessica comforted Natalie as the nurses wheeled Jared's body away.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dr. Nance disappoints Bo and Nora by admitting that the surgery he promised to do was too complicated for him and so he gave up as not to cause further damage for Matthew. At that point, Bo is furious knowing that he made a promise to Matthew that he could not make good on. But right then, Greg comes in and saves the day. They all wait and are somewhat worried. But Greg tells them he thinks he has successfully accomplished getting Matthew to walk again. He calls Destiny and acknowledges that he wouldn't have been encouraged to do it without the encouragement of his sister and his brother. Back in Llanview, Dorian has lost the election to Viki by only one vote and demands to know who the \"traitor\" is. It's Markko although he doesn't dare admit it to Langston much less to Dorian. Jared has died in surgery after Mitch Laurence shot him. Natalie and Charlie are distraught. John is ready to kill Mitch. Brody rushes to stop him. But when Charlie gets there and is ready to kill the man who killed his son, nobody attempts to prevent it. Rex demands that Roxy tells him if Mitch Laurence is his father, how Mitch got her pregnant and why she lied to him.",
