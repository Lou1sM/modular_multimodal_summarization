Ms. Herman arrived, and Rex and Adriana pretended to be pregnant and hoped that she would give them the name of someone who might want their baby. Adriana offered to give her 20 percent in return for Nevin's (Ms. Herman's late boss) records. Ms. Herman didn't remember them, but Rex covered. Ms. Herman asked Adriana all sort of questions and then stabbed Adriana's stomach with a fork. \"You are no more pregnant than I am. This meeting is over,\" she said as she left the table. Rex tried to explain what he really was up to. Rex threatened to turn in Ms. Herman for selling babies. She let Rex read Nevin's files. Rex realized that Marcie and Michael were raising Todd's baby. \n\n\nAn uneasy Starr came home and didn't want to answer any of Blair's questions.

Then Detective Bauer arrived to talk to Starr about what happened last night. Todd and Blair realized that Starr had been at a private party. Starr denied that she had called the police. The detective told them that Cole may be arrested. Todd asked Starr if Cole hurt her. Starr had to go to the police station to make a statement. While there, Todd forbade Starr to see Cole again. Todd and Blair learned that Todd had been on drugs. The detective asked Starr to tell her exactly what happened.

    "tvmega_recap": "The trial starts and Evangeline tells the story of how Spencer killed Thomas McBain. Rex needs Adriana to help with the meeting that he has with the lawyer's secretary. He has to get the records on Todd's kid to find him and so he will need Adriana to pretend that she is pregnant. Starr arrives home and Blair is suspicious since she is wearing strange clothes. \"My clothes got dirty, so I had to put these on.\" Blair is thrilled to hear that Todd caught the garter, but her smile fades when she hears that Evangeline caught the bouquet. She looks in Starr's bag and finds the shirt the girl was wearing the night before. It is ripped. Starr is angry that her mother was looking through her things. She said that she ripped the shirt herself. \"That is the style now.\" Detective Bauer arrives and tells there was an incident the night before. She is looking for Starr Manning. Starr is taken to the station where she tells that Cole was fine at first but then got violent. She says that he didn't hurt her and that her shirt got ripped by accident. Detective Bauer says there may be charges where Cole is concerned. She suspects drugs. The judge calls a recess. Evangeline is uneasy. Nora feels that Evangeline has made a wonderful start, and so does Chris. Evangeline can't help feeling that something is going to go horribly wrong. During the recess, David goes to his brother and asks him just how much money he was offering for silence. Spencer writes a cheque and hands it to David. Rex and Adriana pretend she is pregnant to get the secretary for Mr. Nivens to tell where his records are. They pretend they had a deal with Nivens to sell their baby. It is only when Rex offers the woman 20% of their payment for giving up their kid that Herman tells that she has the password and can access the files on any computer in the world. She thinks that she recognizes Adriana and finally it comes to her that the girl is a model. \"Really? When did you stop modeling? Did you get the 6 month Phy-Oxy test?\" Adriana says that she did and that is when Ms. Herman jabs Adriana in the stomach knowing now that it is fake. She tries to leave, but Rex threatens to tell the cops about her selling babies on the black market. She gives her password up to Rex to keep from getting found out. Rex hits the computer and sees that a huge amount of money was given to Mr. Nivens, and that the name of the parents are Joanne and Frederick Scott! Scott is the same name that the parents of Michael and Marcie's baby had. \"Oh no! Michael and Marcie have Todd's kid!\" Bo tells Nat that someone tried to dig up John's grave. \"It was me! John's alive!\"",
