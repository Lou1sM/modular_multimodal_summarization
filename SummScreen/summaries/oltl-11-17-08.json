    "soap_central": "\nCradle of Hope\n\n\nAt the police station, John, who had been placed under arrest, encountered Blair. As John related that a series of incidents had transpired that would affect many lives, Nora entered the room. Both Blair and Nora were shocked to learn that Marty was alive and had been living at Todd's residence. John explained that Marty had no memory of her life before the accident and had been living at Todd's of her own free will. John revealed that Marty knew about the rape, but had no knowledge that Todd was one of the culprits, until John told her. While Blair asked for more answers, Nora rushed off to the hospital to visit Marty. \n\n\nJohn continued to give Blair the details regarding Todd's latest misdeed. He told her that Marty and Todd had confessed their love for each other and that they had slept together. Blair was horrified to learn that Todd could be capable of taking advantage of a vulnerable Marty. John informed Blair that he had arrived just in time - Todd had planned to run off with Marty and Starr's baby. As she listened to the shocking news, Blair vowed to make Todd pay. After learning that Starr's baby had died, John comforted Blair. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Cole couldn't believe his eyes when he witnessed Marty standing before him. Unsure whether or not he was imagining her presence, Cole asked Marty if she was real or a mirage. With a blank stare, Marty told him that she was actually alive. Cole embraced his mother, but noticed the bewildered look on her face. Sensing that something was wrong, Cole asked Marty if she was aware of whom he actually was. Talia related that it was uncertain of what actually happened to Marty and that she was in need of a full medical exam. Realizing that Cole was pained by her lack of emotion, Marty told him that she had suffered memory loss and only had a faint image of a little boy. Marty began to hum the lullaby that she remembered singing to the toddler, and Cole joined in. Both mother and son were overjoyed to realize that Marty had a memory from the past. While Marty tried her best to reassure Cole that she loved him, Cole was grateful that his mother was alive. The nurse interrupted to inform Marty that the doctor was ready to examine her. Cole told Marty how much he loved her and she told him that she was aware of his feelings towards her. \n\n\nDown the hall, Todd was rushed into the emergency room. As the doctors worked frantically to save his life, Todd mumbled, \"Let me die!\" Appalled that someone would beat Todd nearly to death, the doctor wondered what Todd had done to deserve such treatment. Antonio stated that Todd had held a woman captive and then raped her. When the doctor questioned Antonio's presence, Antonio said that he was an officer and had been assigned to guard Todd. \n\n\nAlone in his hospital room, Todd dreamt of Marty. In his dream, Todd told Marty that he was a changed man because of her. He told her that Starr had changed her mind about giving him her child and wanted Marcie to have the baby. Todd envisioned him and Marty discussing the idea of starting their own family, and Marty was delighted by the thought. He later dreamt of the night they made love and Marty pondered the idea of being pregnant by Todd. \n\n\nIn the maternity ward, Starr phoned Todd to inform him of the baby's death, but received his voicemail. She left her father a message begging him to call her because she had news about the baby. Later, Langston paid Starr a visit. In desperate need of a friend, Starr thanked her for coming and the two grieved for baby Hope together. Langston told Starr that Dr. Joplin had given her a lock of the baby's hair. Showing Langston the locket that Marcie had given her, Starr placed the lock of hair inside the trinket. Langston helped Starr place the locket around her neck. \n\n\nNora found Cole standing outside of Marty's examination room. Unable to contain himself, a joyful Cole told her that he had seen his mother. Realizing that Nora knew more than she was revealing, Cole insisted on knowing where his mother had been. Stating that she didn't know all the details, Nora told Cole that John found Marty at Todd's home. A confused Cole demanded to know why his mother was with Todd. Reminding Cole to be thankful that his mother was alive and well, Nora vowed to see to it that Todd paid for his crimes. Cole's attitude suddenly changed, and he suggested that Nora check on his mother. \n\n\nWhen Nora walked into the examination room, she was surprised by the reception she received from Marty. Remembering the picture she had seen of Nora, Marty acknowledged her. In a vicious tone, Marty said, \"You're Nora Gannon. You defended the man who raped me!\" With Talia's help, Nora convinced Marty that they had become close friends over the years. Nora informed Marty that she had defended Todd, but later made every effort to put him behind bars after learning of his guilt. Nora promised Marty that Todd would never hurt her again. After advising Marty that she was the district attorney, Nora began questioning Marty about her encounter with Todd. Nora wanted to know if Todd had inappropriately touched Marty in any way. Upon remembering that she had sex with Todd, Marty flew into a rage. In tears, Marty cried out that she had sex with Todd willingly. As Marty blamed herself for having terrible judgment, Nora attempted to calm her, and assured Marty that she wasn't responsible. In a panic, Marty revealed that she didn't use protection when she slept with Todd. Horrified, Nora asked Marty if she thought she could be pregnant. \n\n\nWhile Antonio and Talia spoke outside of Todd's hospital room, Cole observed an officer standing guard. As he walked past Todd's room, Cole observed a badly beaten Todd asleep. \n\n\nAs Todd continued to have pleasant memories of a life with Marty, Cole interrupted his dreams. Ripping the pillow from under Todd's head, an angered Cole demanded, \"Wake up!\" A dazed Todd opened his eyes. \n\n\nAt the Angel Square hotel, Mike escorted Marcie back to her apartment. To their surprise, they discovered the living room filled with baby items that had been sent by Marcie's relatives. A sadden Marcie announced to Mike that her family hadn't been told of Hope's passing. Fearing Marcie might suffer a meltdown, Mike quickly put away the gifts. Marcie made an effort to remain strong, but when they entered the bedroom and observed several other items that were meant for Hope's homecoming, both Marcie and Mike were overcome with emotion. Feeling guilty, Marcie accepted responsibility for wanting to raise Hope, and told Mike that he didn't deserve to suffer the loss of the child with her. Mike was adamant about standing by Marcie. Stating that her loss was his loss, Mike told Marcie that he loved her and would never walk out on her again.\n\n\n",
