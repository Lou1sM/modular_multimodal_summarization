    "soap_central": "\n Hold the Phone! \n\n\nWhen Rex returned home after his visit with Roxy, Gigi knew that something was bothering him as soon as she saw his face. She admitted that she had something to tell him as he told her he had learned some news from Roxy. Gigi deferred to Rex, who confessed that he had learned about his real father. \"He's the scum of the earth,\" he told her, filling her in on what he knew about Mitch Laurence.\n\n\n\"He's a fake, twisted preacher,\" Rex exclaimed. He presented the birth certificate and money clip that he had obtained from his Aunt Corrine. Gigi advised him that even if the man was a rapist and murderer, Mitch was only his biological father. She was shocked to learn that Mitch was also Jessica's father and that made her Rex's sister and therefore Shane's aunt. Rex explained that Jessica never let on about Mitch and she considered Clint to be her father.\n\n\nGigi assured Rex that he was the same man he always was, though he was beginning to think he was his father's son. He recalled some of the awful things he had done in the past and thought that he was just like his father. Gigi pulled Stacy's sonogram out and handed it to Rex. She noted that while the baby had some of both Stacy and Mitch, it was perfect. She stressed that children were not their parents.\n\n\nRemembering that Gigi hadn't been feeling well, Rex realized that she had been looking at the sonogram. He apologized for his thoughtlessness. He recalled that she had wanted to tell him something, but Gigi assured him that it wasn't important. She wanted him to remember that he was a great dad. They expressed their love for each other.\n\n\nCharlie did his best to try to choke Mitch to death in the Napa greenhouse, but Brody and John finally pulled him away. \"You killed my boy,\" Charlie accused the deranged evangelist. \"Would it help if I said I'm sorry?\" Mitch replied. Continuing, Mitch noted that everyone was probably surprised at his contrition. He added that Jared had been killed in the \"climax of a struggle\" and that Jared had threatened him. He accused Charlie of murdering Jared's stepfather and pointed out that children often take after their parents.\n\n\nCharlie and Mitch began a screaming match, and Charlie threatened to kill Mitch if he ever found him alone. Mitch demanded that Charlie be arrested. \"For what?\" John asked him. As Viki stood quietly, Mitch turned his attention to her. He asked why she was ignoring him. Sarcastically, she remarked that she had preferred it when Mitch was dead.\n\n\nShe told him he was a \"sadistic, evil excuse for a human being.\" Mitch disagreed, complaining that compared to Charlie, he was \"righteousness itself.\"\n\n\nAs he began to rant and rave, Viki walked to him and slapped his face. She advised him to never utter her husband's name again. She returned to Charlie and urged him not to listen to anything that Mitch said. Convinced that Jared's death was his fault, Charlie reminded her that he had indeed killed someone and didn't even remember it. Viki begged him to stop and assured him they would face it together.\n\n\nThe local police department arrived, and an officer advised John that Mitch would remain in Napa, as his crimes were committed there. As John objected, the officer pulled a court order from his pocket.\n\n\nAt the hospital in Seattle, Clint spoke to Jessica on the phone and she assured him that Natalie was settled into a hotel for the night. He advised her that he was making the arrangements to transport Jared's body home.\n\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, Danielle unsuccessfully tried to find out about Matthew's condition from a nurse. T\u00e9a assured her daughter that they would be able to find out what was happening. T\u00e9a spotted Rachel, and introduced Rachel and Danielle to each other. T\u00e9a knew that Rachel would have news about Matthew. Rachel assured the teen that Matthew was doing well and he would be happy to see her. Danielle asked an astonished Rachel why T\u00e9a had kept her daughter a secret. Rachel covered up nicely, explaining that she had known about Danielle's existence but T\u00e9a had been afraid that Danielle's father would take her away from T\u00e9a. \n\n\nAccepting Rachel's explanation, Danielle left the women so that she could sit with Matthew. T\u00e9a admitted that she hadn't spoken to Todd yet about his daughter. \"I suck at being a mother,\" she confessed to Rachel. She knew that Todd would eventually find out about Danielle. \n\n\nNora and Bo shared a passionate kiss in Nora's Seattle hotel room, falling onto the bed and removing their jackets. Bo pulled away abruptly. He needed to head to his own room for some sleep, he advised his ex-wife. Nora agreed that they shouldn't be cheating on Clint.\n\n\nLater, they shared a pizza and agreed they were both glad they didn't get carried away. Nora decided that she would tell Clint about Bo after things settled down with Jessica and Natalie. She called Rachel at the hospital to check on Matthew. Her daughter assured her that Matthew was fine and urged her to get some sleep. After hanging up, Nora noticed that she had missed a call from Clint.\n\n\nNora returned her husband's call and gave him the good news about Matthew. She asked if Jared had been located and heard the details of what had happened in Napa. She learned that Jared was dead. \"I love you,\" Clint said, needing to tend to Jared's affairs. \"You too,\" Nora replied. Crying, she told Bo the news. All they could do was hold each other.\n\n\nBlair arrived at Rodi's with Todd, thanking him for protecting her from Ross. She had fond thoughts of Rodi's since she and Todd had originally gotten together there. Todd snidely remarked that it had been before John was the owner. Ross sat at the bar, hidden behind a newspaper. Todd seemed eager to leave, but Blair complained of being scared of Ross finding her. Todd wondered if she was actually afraid of Ross or if she was really trying to stop Todd from going to Seattle.\n\n\nTodd checked with his private investigator and learned that T\u00e9a had been located in Seattle. As Todd spoke on the phone, Ross grabbed Blair and pulled her aside. He wanted to know where his daughter was, reminding her that they had a deal. He wanted to take his daughter away and then Todd and Blair could be together, he emphasized. Giving in, Blair advised him that his daughter was in Seattle and she had heard the details via Todd's private investigator. Suddenly, she gasped and told Ross about a new idea of hers. She thought he should tell T\u00e9a that Todd was living with Blair and their children.\n\n\nRoxy was surprised to see Schuyler working at Rodi's. He wanted to know if she had spoken to Rex about seeing Gigi emerge from Schuyler's hotel room. Roxy admitted that she was upset at something she had relayed to Rex. As the pair spoke animatedly, Kim and Stacy approached the bar. From the pieces of conversation they heard, they deduced that Gigi had spent the night with Schuyler. Stacy couldn't wait to expose the fact that her slutty sister had cheated on Rex.\n\n\nKim thought it would be a bad move to tell Gigi. \"Cogitation, meditation, plan,\" she stated in explanation. In response to Stacy's confusion, Kim clarified that she had obtained the motto from the website of Buchanan Enterprises and Clint had been the author of it. She was formalizing her plan to sink her claws into Clint, since Nora had no time for her new husband.\n\n\nAs it turned out, Buchanan Enterprises was looking for an executive administrative assistant and her name was written all over it, Kim told Stacy enthusiastically. She admitted that while she couldn't type, she was able to text and it was the same thing. She also fudged her resume, she admitted. The men that she had danced for would give her good recommendations or she'd tell their wives about them. She would come up with a plan on the best way to let Rex know about Gigi and Schuyler.\n\n\nRoxy  continued to talk about the awful thing that she had to tell Rex. \"At least the bastard is dead,\" she mumbled to Schuyler. It took him a moment until he realized that Roxy wasn't talking about Rex. She gruffly told him to stay away from Gigi as Rex would be needing his wife more than ever.\n\n\nWalking out of Matthew's room, Danielle spotted her mother's belongings left alone on the sofa. Searching for T\u00e9a's cell phone, Danielle finally grabbed it and searched for her father's phone number. Unable to locate the deleted number, she was surprised when the phone rang. \"Who the hell is this?\" Todd griped, when Danielle answered. She asked the same question in response, but was startled when T\u00e9a grabbed the phone from her hand.\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd it was no one when he asked her who had answered the phone. She revealed that she was in Seattle visiting Matthew, and she learned from Todd that Ross was back in Llanview causing trouble. He denied hating her and admitted that he didn't believe what he had learned about T\u00e9a and Ross taking part in a scam. He wanted to know the real reason behind T\u00e9a not confessing that she was married to Ross. T\u00e9a admitted she had made a mess and needed to clean it up.\n\n\n\"We have a...,\" T\u00e9a began, before being interrupted because Blair grabbed Todd's phone out of his hand. Blair, yelling at T\u00e9a, told her to stay away from Todd. She made it clear that Todd had his children to take care of. T\u00e9a hung up the phone and refused to answer it when a disgruntled Todd tried to call her back. Blair advised Todd that she was trying to protect him from T\u00e9a, who had nothing better to do than call Todd. He quickly advised her that he had been the one to call T\u00e9a.\n\n\n\"Who was that jerk?\" Danielle asked her mother. She wanted to know if Todd was the reason that T\u00e9a and Ross had split up. T\u00e9a assured her daughter that Todd was only a client. Relieved, Danielle told her mother she would hate for T\u00e9a  to be associated with someone \"so gross.\"\n\n\nLater, as T\u00e9a and Rachel chatted, T\u00e9a conveyed that she had sensed that Todd was ready to forgive her. She had planned on telling Todd the truth, but Blair had grabbed the phone.\n\n\nBack at Rodi's, Blair reminded Todd that he was supposed to be forgetting his troubles. When a song that she liked began to play on the jukebox, she asked Todd to dance with her. As Todd looked at her, he suddenly saw T\u00e9a instead, and agreed to dance. As he refocused and T\u00e9a turned into Blair once again, he looked thoughtful.\n\n\nDuring the montage, T\u00e9a and Danielle shared a mother and daughter moment, as Bo and Nora hugged. Rex and Gigi grabbed hands and headed for the stairs, and Clint watched the orderlies change the sheets on the bed that Jared had lain in. Mitch was taken away from the greenhouse. He smirked at John, but barely looked at Charlie and Viki.\n\n\n",
