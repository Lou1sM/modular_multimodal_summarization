    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Todd and T\u00e9a awoke well after noon, still recovering from their \"back from the dead\" party.  T\u00e9a hurried to answer the door and found Shaun there with a present from him and Vivian.  He explained that Greg's sentencing was later in the day, and T\u00e9a said she wanted to be there.  \"No way in hell,\" Todd replied.  He warned T\u00e9a not to relive what Greg and Eli had done to her, but T\u00e9a was determined to see justice served.\n\n\nShaun promised that Greg would pay for his crimes, and apologized to T\u00e9a for his unwitting role in the sordid affair.  T\u00e9a assured him it wasn't his fault.  After Shaun left, Todd reminded T\u00e9a that they were on their honeymoon, and asked her not to waste a second of her life on Greg Evans.\n\n\nT\u00e9a felt a migraine coming on and Todd fetched her some aspirin, then phoned room service to order lunch.  As T\u00e9a dropped two pills into the palm of her hand, however, she was galvanized by memories of her ordeal, and her trembling hand dropped the aspirin on the ground.  She attempted to shrug it off, but Todd pushed her to admit that the pills reminded her of Greg and Eli's attempt to slowly poison her.  Overcome, she collapsed into Todd's arms.\n\n\nAt the police station, Bo stepped over the remains of the smashed houseplant and asked the guilty-looking Inez and Nora what he had just walked in on.  The ladies claimed it was a simple accident, and Inez quickly cleaned up the plant as Nora hurried out of Bo's office.  Bo attempted to get her to talk to him, but Nora told him she was late for Greg's hearing and rushed out of the station.\n\n\nBo returned to his office as Inez dumped the remains of the plant into a wastebasket.  He told Inez he had paid Eddie a visit, and would have her ex-husband shadowed by uniformed officers.  Bashful, Inez asked Bo to leave it at that and not help her further; she could handle her family's problems on her own.  Sensing tension, Bo asked Inez if she and Nora had engaged in an altercation.\n\n\nInez said that she and Nora had gone through a \"misunderstanding,\" but that it had been straightened out, and that she had indeed been asking too much of Bo.  When Bo pressed for details, Inez confessed that Nora had accused her of having a crush on him.  Bo laughed and said that Eddie had accused him of being infatuated with Inez.  Just then, an officer arrived with a package for Inez.  It was a present from Clint: the other half of the broken heart necklace.  Inez seemed loath to accept the \"extravagant\" gift, but Bo told her it was a sign that Clint really liked her.\n\n\nIn a neighboring hallway, Brody and Natalie shared a collective freak-out over Marty's visit to Llanfair.  Natalie attempted to assuage Brody's fears, as she wasn't sure Marty suspected anything about her baby's paternity, but admitted that Marty had been dropping a lot of hints about Natalie's amniocentesis.  Worried, Brody rushed off to Llanfair.\n\n\nAfter Brody left, Natalie ran into Vivian, who was on her way to the courthouse.  Vivian promised that Natalie's test results would be back soon, and Natalie offhandedly commented on the hospital filing errors that could have led to Marty receiving Natalie's paperwork.  Confused, Vivian said such a thing could never happen, but quickly realized that Marty had lied to her about being in her office the night before.  Natalie was upset to realize Marty had stolen her paperwork outright.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, Richard and Phylicia arrived for Greg's sentencing hearing.  Greg immediately asked about Destiny, but the Evans elders said Destiny wasn't speaking to them.\n\n\nJust then, Destiny entered the courtroom.  Richard and Phylicia clucked over the girl, and Phylicia asked Destiny if her brother was taking care of her.  \"You mean Uncle Shaun?\" Destiny snarked.  She corrected her grandparents, reminding them that Greg was her real father, and said she was only there to see that he got what he deserved.  She rejected Phylicia's embrace, and said she couldn't trust her family anymore.\n\n\nGreg broke his silence, and pleaded with Destiny not to blame Richard and Phylicia for his actions.  He told her they were her true parents, who loved her as much as he did.  \"You have no right to love me,\" Destiny said coldly.  She asked \"Grandma\" to stop pretending things were as they had always been and give her the truth about her life.  Phylicia declared that she and Richard had spent day and night loving Destiny as their own, so much so that they had forgotten how their grandchild had entered their lives -- she swore that Destiny would always be their little girl, and begged the teen to return home and give them another chance.\n\n\nDestiny pulled away from Phylicia, and demanded to know the truth about her mother, Charlene, and how Charlene had died.  \"Tell her,\" Shaun ordered Greg as he entered the courtroom, \"She deserves to know.\"  Greg recounted the story of Charlene's accident to Destiny, and admitted that he and Charlene had fought over whether or not to have their baby.  Destiny was horrified to hear that Greg had hidden Charlene's body, and the girl fled the courtroom with Phylicia on her heels.\n\n\nPhylicia caught up with Destiny in the corridor.  Heartbroken, Destiny asked to see her mother's grave.  \"I want to see my mother,\" she sobbed. \"You're Greg's mother, go be with him!\"  With that, she ran out of the courthouse.\n\n\nBack in the courtroom, the sentencing hearing got underway as Phylicia and the rest of the Evans family took their seats.  Nora submitted a plea agreement for Greg as a cooperating witness, offering him six years in Statesville Prison with a possibility for parole in four years.  Entering the courtroom as the agreement was read, Todd was outraged, and asked Nora, \"You kidding me?\"  The judge silenced Todd and agreed to the plea bargain, sentencing Greg to six years.  As Greg was hauled away, he shared a moment with his parents, while Todd slapped his back and told Greg to \"enjoy your stay\" behind bars.\n\n\nAs the courtroom cleared, Richard and Phylicia thanked Nora for her help.  After the Evanses had left, Todd confronted Nora, asking her how she could sleep at night, knowing that Greg had gotten a lesser sentence than Cole, who had rid the world of Eli Clarke.\n\n\nBack at the Palace, T\u00e9a was recovering from her panic attack when she heard a knock at the door.  Answering it, she greeted Destiny, who asked T\u00e9a for her legal expertise.  \"I want to divorce my parents,\" Destiny declared.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Marty told Jessica that something had happened with Brody, and she had a right to know the truth.  She explained that she was being investigated regarding the Hannah O'Connor case, and all her patient records were being seized.  Marty didn't want Brody's therapy records ending up in the wrong hands, and explained that she was violating ethics guidelines and handing Brody's file over to Jessica for safekeeping.  As Jessica reeled at the news that Brody was Marty's patient, Marty flashed back to her session with Brody, and his talk of secrets he couldn't bear to keep.\n\n\nBrody burst into the drawing room and confronted Marty.  As Jessica explained the situation, Brody railed at Marty for violating his patient confidentiality.  Jessica insisted that Marty only wanted to help, but Brody didn't like the gleam in Marty's eye.  Brody admitted he had needed to talk to someone about Jessica and Ford, but said he didn't appreciate Marty infringing on his privacy.  Marty played innocent, and said she was only looking out for his best interests.\n\n\nJessica told Marty they appreciated her help, but it wasn't necessary -- \"I don't think we have any more secrets left!\"  When Jessica mentioned the relief she would feel upon receiving her paternity results, Marty knowingly noted that Natalie had undergone an amniocentesis as well.  \"She didn't want to worry you or John,\" Marty said with a smirk, staring at Brody, \"but now it's all out there.\"   Jessica was bemused to be left out of the loop about Natalie's baby plans, while Brody and Marty shared an uneasy gaze.  Marty gave Jessica and Brody her best wishes and walked out of Llanfair.\n\n\nAs Marty was leaving the grounds, she ran into Natalie at the front door.  \"You spiteful bitch,\" Natalie hissed.  She told Marty she knew about the theft of her amnio records, but Marty played dumb.  Natalie said she was sorry for how Marty and Cole had suffered, but offered her nemesis a warning.  \"You've crossed the line, Marty,\" Natalie declared, \"and I will make sure you're stopped.\"\n\n\nAt Buchanan Enterprises, Dorian pried open Clint's desk, but before she could examine it, an alarm began to blare.  Dorian attempted to flee, only to find the office door sealed.  As she howled for help, her prayers were answered by the sudden arrival of Matthew, decked out in junior business attire.  Dorian pleaded her innocence and warned Matthew that there was an intruder somewhere in the building, but Matthew primly informed her that the alarm was only for Clint's offices, meaning that Dorian was the intruder.\n\n\nDorian claimed that she had met with Clint, but left her earring behind and had only returned to retrieve it.  Matthew wasn't falling for her ruse -- he told Dorian the alarm was keyed to Clint's desk, and only activated in case someone attempted to force the lock.  He refused to let Dorian leave, and asked her if she was planning another corporate takeover of the company.  Dorian condescended to the boy, calling him a \"precocious young man\" ready to follow in Bo's footsteps.  Matthew informed her that he wouldn't be a cop -- he was going to succeed \"Uncle Clint\" and run the family empire.  \"And you used to be such a sweet child,\" Dorian said with a sigh.\n\n\nDorian offered Matthew a wad of bills for his silence, and Matthew correctly deduced that she didn't want Clint to know about her return visit.  As Matthew pocketed the money, Dorian made good her escape, but not before Matthew insisted she return the desk key.  \"Have a good day, May or Lord,\" he said sweetly.  With Dorian gone, Matthew pondered Clint's desk.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Clint hid his smirk as Rex told the assembled adults he didn't want to know who his parents were.  Rex said he had gotten along fine without his biological parents, and wondered if the truth shouldn't stay buried.  Viki and Charlie pleaded with Rex to go through with the test, and Echo added that she wanted her son back.\n\n\nRex begged to differ, reminding Echo that she had dumped him at the hospital as a foundling, and then forged letters to throw him off her trail.  \"That wasn't -- \" Echo began -- then, glancing at Clint, she said she had been scared, but wanted to make up for her mistakes.  Charlie added that he wanted to catch up on being Rex's dad, if he indeed was the father.  As the DNA tech pressed Rex for an answer, Clint offered to take Rex aside and \"talk sense\" into him on Viki's behalf.  Over Rex's protests, Clint hauled him into the neighboring corridor.\n\n\nAs Rex began to harangue Clint, Clint ordered the young gumshoe to shut up, and called him a spineless piece of garbage.  \"You think I wanna be your father?\" he asked. \"I don't want to take this test any more than you do.\"  He accused Rex of looking for a payday as a Buchanan, and called Rex a miserable punk who would never be a part of his family.  Rex assured Clint he wanted no part of the Buchanan name, beyond potentially being Natalie's brother and Bo's nephew -- he would rather have \"the prince of darkness\" be his father than Clint.\n\n\nRex trashed Clint for imprisoning David, his own nephew, in Morocco.  \"It's not a real nephew,\" Clint snapped. \"It's David Vickers!\"  He added that Rex could have defied his blackmail and exposed him.  \"I protected my family,\" Rex muttered.  \"So did I,\" Clint replied.  \"Don't,\" Rex snapped. \"I am nothing like you.\"\n\n\nIn the waiting area, Viki, Charlie, and Echo waited on Rex and Clint.  Viki assailed Echo for her duplicitous behavior, and said she didn't deserve Rex for a son.  Charlie took Viki aside and asked her to take it easy on Echo, but Viki refused to forget what Echo had done to her so many years before.  Charlie reminded Viki that he had a dark past, as well, but people had given him a second chance; the least he could do was give Echo the same.\n\n\nIn the adjoining corridor, Clint offered Rex a solution to their stalemate: they would return to the waiting area and pretend Clint had begged him to take the test, only for Rex to decline.  Rex agreed, but when the duo returned to the waiting area, Rex declared that Clint had convinced him to take the test after all: \"Let's do it!\"\n\n\nAs the party filed into the DNA lab, an infuriated Clint cornered Rex, calling him a snake.  \"Why'd you do it?\" he whispered.  \"To see that look on your face,\" Rex shot back.  Gritting his teeth, Clint stepped up to the technician's desk for his DNA cheek swab, only to be admonished to not \"bite the swab.\"\n\n\nAs Clint stormed off, Echo followed him into the waiting area and gloated that soon everyone would know Rex was his son, and there was nothing Clint could do about it.  \"I guess not,\" Clint murmured, and left.\n\n\nEcho returned to the DNA lab as Viki told Charlie she was leaving, claiming that the DNA results were none of her business, and exited over her husband's protests.\n\n\nClint returned to his office at B.E. and found Matthew waiting for him.  Matthew explained that he had caught Dorian attempting to break into Clint's desk.  She hadn't seen what was inside, but Matthew had.  Matthew held up the other half of the broken heart necklace, and asked Clint if it was what Dorian had been looking for.\n\n\nViki returned to Llanfair, but was dismayed to find Dorian hot on her heels.  Dorian explained that they had a pressing matter to discuss: Clint.\n\n\nAt the DNA lab, Charlie and Echo shared a moment of joy at the thought of Rex being their long-lost son.  Meanwhile, Rex stepped up to the desk and gave the DNA technician his cheek swab.  He warned Echo that his feelings for her were the same regardless of the results and left.\n\n\nAs the technician took the DNA samples into the lab, he answered a phone call from Marty.  Marty introduced herself as Natalie Banks, and asked when her paternity test results would be in.\n\n\nIn the drawing room at Llanfair, Brody returned from putting Jessica back to bed and examined Marty's case file with Natalie.  They were petrified when they noticed Marty had highlighted notations about Brody's secrets and lies, and deduced that Marty wanted them to know she knew their secret.  \"The only question is, what is she gonna do next?\" Natalie wondered. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Shaun takes a gift to Todd & Tea. He tells them that Greg pled guilty to all the charges and that he will be sentenced today.

Dorian sets off the alarm in Clint's office while looking for the half-heart necklace. Matthew comes and turns off the alarm. She gives him a wad of cash for his silence. Matt takes the money and tells Clint anyway. Matthew takes the necklace out of his pocket and asks Clint if it is what Dorian was looking for.
