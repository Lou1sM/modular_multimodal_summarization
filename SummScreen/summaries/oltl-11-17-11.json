    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica and Robert Ford have spent the night together and have no regrets although they are not certain what to tell others or where they will go from there. At the airport, Natalie rushes to stop John from leaving for Seattle. Rex accompanies her and runs into Brody completely unaware that he intends to kidnap baby Liam. Cutter and Gigi/Stacy are not far away ready to board a flight for her to have \"reverse\" plastic surgery so that she no longer looks like Gigi if she is really Stacy. Rex has a \"premonition\" that she's not far away when he again sees the words: \"Don't Give Up\". And then minutes later he comes face to face with whom he believes is the real Gigi. Aubrey then knows she needs to find a way to help Rex, knowing that only she can unravel the mystery about what Cutter knows in regards to the Gigi look-alike whom Rex has seen. So she goes with Rex to find Gigi."
