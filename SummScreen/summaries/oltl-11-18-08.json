Blair couldn't believe the number of shocking events that had come down on them all at once. John regretted not getting to Marty sooner, even though Blair told him not to blame himself. He urged her to focus on Starr, and not let Todd's latest crimes preoccupy her. Blair admitted that she had never been Marty's biggest fan, but said she could sympathize with her rage upon learning the truth. She reflected on how Todd had been haunted by what he had done to Marty for years, and told John she couldn't understand why he would choose to repeat the rape and put both himself and Marty through it again. \"Some people never change,\" John replied. Blair asked if that was the answer, or whether Todd had managed to convince himself that he was actually in love with Marty. John told Blair that Marty didn't remember anyone, including Cole, and Blair expressed her sympathies for the boy, while dreading having to give Starr another shock with the news about Todd. As John was taken away for booking, he and Blair bid one another goodbye. \"Take care of yourself,\" John said. \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Clint arrived at Jessica's room with a bouquet of roses to cheer her up. She asked about the children, and Clint told her that both of her daughters were doing fine, and that the new baby was beautiful. Clint wanted to get her restraints removed, but Jessica told him to leave them on. \"I'm dangerous,\" she reminded him. Clint tried to make the distinction between Jessica and Tess, and said she was not responsible and would be getting help, but Jessica wasn't having it. She told her father she did bear responsibility for Tess's actions, and insisted Clint tell her what Tess had done in the months she had been on the loose. After a lot of pushing, Clint grudgingly recounted Tess's murderous exploits to the horrified Jessica. \"What have I done?\" she cried. \n\n\nAt Rex's apartment, Roxy and Gigi surprised Rex with Natalie and Jared's return. Rex hugged his sister, and the Balsom siblings compared notes about their ordeals with Brody and Tess. Natalie was surprised to hear that Rex and Adriana had divorced, and was curious about the circumstances that led to Rex's shooting. Rex said that both Brody and Jessica were \"sad, sick people\" who were getting help, and that he was grateful to be together with the love of his life. Roxy spilled the beans to Natalie that \"Rex is a daddy,\" and Rex explained to Natalie and Jared that Shane was his son. Natalie was shocked and delighted, but Rex said that they would be taking the father-son process slowly. The conversation turned back to Jessica, as Rex asked Natalie and Jared how they would relate to Jess after all that had happened. Natalie said she didn't know; she felt cheated of justice because she had despised Tess, but loved Jessica just as much, and they were not one and the same. She admitted she wasn't sure that things would ever be the same again between the two sisters. \n\n\nAs Jared and Natalie prepared to leave the Balsom household, Natalie got a call from Clint, who told her that he was with Jessica, and had filled her in on what Tess had done. Clint told Natalie that Jessica was asking for them. \n\n\nAt the veterans' hospital, Brody got another visit from Wes. Wes was pleased to see that Brody was coherent and in better spirits, and Brody said the doctors had lowered his medication dosage. He told Wes that Gigi and Rex had visited and brought Shane, and that he had appreciated their kindness. Wes informed Brody that he'd contacted Brody's sister, Nadine, but Brody was unruffled to hear that his sibling still wanted nothing to do with him. Wes encouraged Brody to keep working with the Veterans Affairs psychiatrists in order to get a lighter sentence for the shooting, but Brody said there was no point; he was going to prison, and that was that. Brody told Wes that the word had gotten out that the VA department was looking to cut him loose, uninterested in his stateside \"civilian trauma.\" \"I did this to myself,\" Brody insisted, and said he was ready to take the maximum punishment. Wes urged him to fight for his freedom. \n\n\nBack at Llanview Hospital, Cole stared the wounded Todd down as he held the pillow over his head, ready to smother him. Cole railed at Todd about what Todd had to done to his mother, but all Todd could say was, \"I saved her.\" He claimed he had never meant to hurt Marty again. \"Nobody cares what you meant,\" Cole hissed, and said that all that mattered was what Todd had actually done. He asked Todd for one good reason he should live, but Todd said he had nothing left to live for. \"I was trying to make it up to her,\" he croaked, and implied that Marty could have learned the whole truth at any time. Cole laughed in his face, and said that Todd had trapped a crippled woman in his home and brainwashed her. \"She didn't want to leave,\" Todd whispered. \"She wanted everything that happened between us.\" Cole grew frightened as the unthinkable dawned on him, and he asked if Todd had slept with Cole's mother. Todd turned to face Cole, and mumbled, \"Yeah.\" \n\n\nHorrified, Cole dropped the pillow and began to pace around Todd's hospital room. \"It wasn't how you think,\" Todd protested feebly, but Cole rejected Todd's point of view. As he saw it, Todd found a way to make the amnesiac Marty owe him, and then he collected. He became furious again as he realized that Marty had been in Todd's house when Cole had come to see him regarding the baby's adoption. When he told Todd that Starr's baby was dead, Todd refused to believe it. \"It's true, Todd,\" Blair said as she walked in. \"Starr's baby is dead. God, I wish it was you.\" Cole said he blamed Todd for Starr's loss as well. Unable to deal with the situation any longer, he fled, leaving Blair to confront her ex-husband. \n\n\nIn the exam room, Marty sat on the floor with Nora, shell-shocked. In a broken, dazed voice, she admitted that she and Todd had not used protection when they'd gone to bed together. \"I thought I wanted to have his baby,\" she mumbled. Nora told her not to blame herself for being taken in, and said that Todd was a master manipulator. Marty said she'd learned everything she knew about herself from him, and that it had all turned out to be lies. She called herself a fool, and when Nora said she wasn't, Marty said she was a victim, and that was worse. \"Marty Saybrooke, you are nobody's fool and you are nobody's victim,\" Nora declared. She explained that Marty had been vulnerable, and Todd had taken advantage, nothing more. She asked Marty if she wanted the morning after pill to prevent pregnancy, and Marty agreed. When Nora left to get the doctor, Marty curled up into a ball, trying to shut out the world. \n\n\nNora returned with a doctor to administer the morning after pill, and Marty found herself lost in thought. She flashed back to her long talks with Todd, and how she had hoped for a baby of their own. Then, she remembered Todd's admission of rape. Without hesitation, Marty quickly downed both of the necessary pills. \n\n\nAfter the doctor left, Marty and Nora spoke about Cole and children. Nora told Marty that she knew both of her children, even if she couldn't remember them. \"No, I only know Todd,\" Marty muttered. Nora assured Marty that \"you're still you,\" and that remembering would take time. Marty couldn't get over the fact that she had prayed for a child with Todd, but had actually had her own son, and she didn't know a thing about him. \n\n\nIn Todd's room, Todd asked Blair about Starr, but Blair didn't think he deserved to know. \"She's my daughter and I love her,\" Todd mumbled. \"As much as you love Marty Saybrooke?\" Blair shot back. Disgusted, Blair asked Todd if he'd really believed he could erase the past and absolve himself by making an amnesia patient fall in love with him. She said that first, Todd had stolen Marty's youth and then, he had spent years trying to ingratiate himself to her ever since. \"I thought we could be happy,\" Todd moaned. Blair scoffed at the implication that there was anything innocent or noble about Todd's \"love\" for Marty. She said she never thought that he could shock her again, but that he had outdone himself once more. Growing emotional, she spoke about their relationship. \"So long, I believed in the man that I thought you could be,\" Blair whispered. She said she'd thought that she had seen inside of him and their love was real, but his crime against Marty had made her realize that inside of Todd, there was nothing but a cold, black heart. As Blair stormed out, she told Todd that it would have been better for everyone, especially Marty, if John had beaten him to death. \n\n\nIn the exam room, Nora returned to Marty's side and told her that she was cleared to go home with Nora. Nora told Marty that Cole lived with her, as well, and that being around truthful, loving friends and family would help her memory return. Marty seemed pleased by the prospect, but was still thunderstruck by all that had happened with Todd. \"I thought I loved him,\" she muttered. As Cole entered, Marty stayed at the other side of the room, distant, struggling with her thoughts. Nora gave Cole the good news, and Cole told Marty that no one would ever hurt her again. \n\n\nAt Rex's, Gigi prepared breakfast, but Wes Grainger knocked at the door and interrupted her. Wes introduced himself, and told Gigi and Rex that Brody needed their help. \n\n\nAt the veterans' hospital, Brody stared at a picture of himself with Shane, then sadly put it in a drawer and shut it away. \n\n\nWhile being escorted to the cellblock, John wrangled a buddy's phone and called Nora to check on Marty. Nora told him that they were taking her back to the Buchanan mansion with Cole, and John asked her to \"take care of them.\" \n\n\nAt the hospital, Clint opened Jessica's door to admit Jared and Natalie, who shared an awkward moment with her sister. \n\n\nIn a hospital corridor, Nora wheeled Marty through the halls on their way to the exit. Just then, an elevator opened, and Todd was wheeled out, coming face-to-face with Marty. \n\n\n",
