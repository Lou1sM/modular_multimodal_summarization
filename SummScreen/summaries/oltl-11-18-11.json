Although he doesn't want to get her involved, she is confident she can help him to find out what is going on and how it might relate to Cutter. When Cutter and \"Gigi/Stacy\" arrive at the plastic surgery clinic in South America, they observe a woman furious with how Dr. Fascinella ruined her face with plastic surgery. She's Alex Olanov, ex-wife of David Vickers. Cutter observes her and can see that she is his long lost mother who abandoned him and his sister when they were children, took his father's money and ran off. She at first does not believe him, but he convinces her it's true and informs her for the first time that his father blew his brains out because of what she did. Gigi/Stacy seems to be developing \"trust\" for Cutter. John and Natalie are brainstorming about where Brody could have taken Liam. He arrives at his family's home in Niles, MI and runs into his sister, Nadine. He remembers she's supposed to be in jail, but she's recently been released early for good behavior. She welcomes her brother and the baby but realizes he has kidnapped him and doesn't want to get herself in trouble hiding him from the cops. Although she lies to the police that she has not seen her brother, she urges Brody to leave immediately. Todd works with Agent Baker and his \"henchmen\" to find Tomas Delgado and make him go away. They find Tomas' friend Claude to \"motivate\" him to tell them where to find Tomas. Tomas is with Tea promising to be there for his sister and her baby. Yet we don't know what could happen if Baker and his men make him disappear."
