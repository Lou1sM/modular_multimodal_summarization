As they approached the elevator, the doors opened and Todd was wheeled off. He was escorted by a nurse and a police guard. As the trio neared Marty, she stood up. When Todd came to a stop in front of her, Marty vented her fury. Todd had difficulty maintaining eye contact while Marty angrily told him that she had taken something to ensure that there wouldn't be any lingering effects of their sexual encounter. To clarify, she told him that she ended any potential pregnancies. Todd said little beyond apologizing as Marty berated him. Marty wasn't interested in his apologizes. She told him that she hoped that his regret ate him alive and killed him. \n\n\nNora spoke up when Todd reminded Marty that he had given her an out when he had invited her to leave. Nora was disgusted that Todd had the nerve to suggest that Marty had free will when her head had been filled with lies. Marty was equally outraged and reminded Todd of the worst of his lies; telling her that she didn't have children. She told Todd that she had met her son earlier and vowed to make sure that Todd spent the rest of his life suffering for what he had done to her. When Marty mentioned Todd's plans for Starr's baby, Todd dropped the bombshell that the baby had died. Marty and Nora were stunned. Their disbelief turned to anger when Todd suggested that the baby's death had been God's punishment for his transgressions. He went on to profess his profound regret over the things he had done. \n\n\nNora was disgusted. She asked Todd how he had the nerve to believe that his contrition would somehow make amends for the horrible things that he had done. She also wanted to know how he could have the gall to put it all on God when he was the one responsible for plotting the ruination of so many lives. When Nora was through blasting Todd, Marty spoke up again. She told Todd that she wanted nothing to do with him then walked away. Before the elevator doors closed on Nora and Marty, Todd turned and told Marty that he was sorry. Neither woman responded. After the doors closed, the nurse and guard stepped forward and wheeled Todd away. \n\n\nBlair went to Starr's hospital room and found her out of bed. When she joined Starr on the sofa, she noticed the locket that Starr was wearing. Starr explained that Marcie had given it to her and she'd been advised to put something personal of her daughter's in it to help with the grief that she was feeling. Starr confided that the necklace held a lock of Hope's hair. Blair gently changed the subject to Todd and tried to break the news about Todd's recent wrongdoings to Starr. Starr was shocked when she learned that Marty was alive. She also worried about how Cole would react to the news. As the two talked, Starr began asking questions about Marty's return to Llanview. Those questions forced Blair to reveal Todd's role in Marty's recent tribulations. Starr was hurt that her father had been able to convince her and others that he had turned a new leaf. Blair was sympathetic and pointed out that she believed that Todd had been sincere in his acceptance of Starr's decisions concerning the baby. Unfortunately, it gave Starr little comfort when Blair went on to tell Starr that Todd had, at one point, planned to kidnap Starr's baby. \n\n\nDorian cornered Dr. Joplin in a hospital corridor and demanded answers about the death of Starr's baby. She informed Dr. Joplin that she had spoken to hospital personnel in the NICU and discovered that the baby had never been taken there. Dorian wanted to know where Dr. Joplin had taken the baby when she had left Starr's room. Dr. Joplin appeared nervous, but she stuck to her story. She told Dorian that she had suspected that the baby suffered from heart problems and she had acted accordingly. Dr. Joplin insisted that she had taken the baby to NICU. She suggested that perhaps the people Dorian had spoken to had only told Dorian what she had wanted to hear. Dr. Joplin then concluded that the baby's passing had been God's will. Dorian was far from satisfied. She warned Dr. Joplin that she intended to investigate the 45-minute window during which the baby was missing. When she discovered what happened, Dorian would then determine if the baby's demise had been an act of God or malpractice. After Dorian marched away, Dr. Joplin sat down in a nearby seat and dropped her head into her hands. \n\n\nAt Rex's place, Wes talked to Rex and Gigi about Brody. He wanted Rex to help Brody with the criminal charges that he faced. Wes explained that Brody's sister refused to return Wes's calls and Brody didn't have the funds to hire an adequate attorney to help deal with the legal ramifications that he faced. Wes wanted Rex to drop the charges against Brody. Rex was sympathetic but didn't feel that he could do much to help Brody. He reminded Wes that the D.A., not him, had filed the charges. It wasn't up to Rex whether or not the charges were dropped. Wes pointed out that without Rex's cooperation, the D.A. might have a difficult time prosecuting the case. Rex agreed and took Shane's feelings into consideration. He realized Shane would not want Brody to be sent to jail. For Shane's sake, Rex decided to do what he could to help Brody avoid jail. Wes was appreciative, and left. \n\n\nJessica's grasp on reality was tentative as Tess, trapped behind a mental cage, screamed for release. Tess wanted to see her baby. Jessica seemed somewhat aware of the struggle going on in her mind but she focused on Natalie when her sister and Jared arrived for a visit. Jared didn't appear happy to be in Jessica's room, but said little as Natalie approached Jessica. Jessica explained that she had asked to see them after she had learned from Clint the details of Natalie's imprisonment. Jessica felt that she couldn't ask for forgiveness until she extended the same courtesy. Jessica went on to express her shame over what Natalie and Jared had to endure at Tess's hands. \n\n\nNatalie was more understanding than Jared was. When Tess explained that Nash's loss continued to be a raw wound that felt as if it had just happened, Jared asked what the point of the visit was if she still felt the intense pain of losing her husband. Natalie however was more compassionate. She understood what Jessica had meant because she realized that she and her sister had not resolved anything. It had been Tess who had falsely offered forgiveness, not Jessica. When Natalie asked to speak to Jessica alone, Jared appeared torn between relief and reluctance. He hesitated until Natalie assured him that she would be okay alone with her sister. \n\n\nAfter Jared stepped out of the room, Natalie and Jessica spoke from their hearts. Jessica asked Natalie to look after her children. Natalie happily agreed but assured Jessica that she would soon return home to her daughters. Jessica wasn't so certain. She reminded Natalie that it was doubtful Tess had taken good care of Bree. Jessica worried that Bree would fear her mother because she was too young to understand that she was not Tess. Jessica also worried that her newborn could have problems because of poor prenatal care and a birth that Jessica did not remember. Natalie felt terrible for her sister and tried to offer her hope. She promised to help Jessica through the difficult journey ahead. Jessica appreciated Natalie's faith but admitted that she couldn't foresee a happy ending for herself. \n\n\nMeanwhile, inside Jessica's head, Tess continued banging on the cage she was imprisoned in while she demanded to be released. She was frantic to see the baby. Tess worried that something awful had happened to the baby because she never heard her cry after her birth. Bess calmly walked up to the cage and told Tess to relax. She insisted that the baby was fine but Tess wasn't convinced. She reminded Bess that she never went \"out\" so she would have no way of knowing how the baby fared. Bess disagreed. She reminded Tess that she was responsible for order and was fully aware of what went on \"outside\" and \"inside\" Jessica's head. Tess was not pacified and began threatening Bess in an effort to force her compliance. She warned Bess that if she did not release Tess, Tess would do everything in her power to ensure that she and Jessica would not integrate. Bess reluctantly capitulated and released Tess. However, before Tess left, Bess told her that her freedom was temporary. Bess only intended for Tess to be \"out\" long enough to see that the baby was safe and sound. \n\n\nMoments later, Bess walked out of the cage and closed the door behind her. As she walked away, Jessica was seen lying unconscious on the floor. She was wearing her hospital gown.\n\n\n",
