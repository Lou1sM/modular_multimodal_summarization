    "tvmega_recap": "Vii goes to see Clint after considering that Dorian may be onto something about his keeping a secret involving Rex's paternity and helping to scam Rex. But he knows how to sound as though he is not lying about anything and could not possibly have gotten Echo pregnant with Rex all those years ago. And he gives her the necklace telling her he has no use for it. When Viki leaves his office however, Clint reveals that he has hired a guy to duplicate the one-of- a-kind necklace so that Viki and others would not suspect him of knowing something he's hiding or of scamming Rex. He also persuades the guy to break into the DNA lab to alter the DNA results so that it appears that Charlie, instead of himself, is Rex's biological father. Right then, we see Natalie getting her DNA results in an envelope, as do Jessica and Brody, as does Rex. Yet the results are not revealed. Marty has still apparently not revealed to John that Natalie could be pregnant by Brody. And it appears that she knows she needs to wait for the results before she'll have any credibility in revealing the secret to John that Natalie slept with Brody. Meanwhile, Todd gets Starr to sign some papers regarding baby Hope. Yet she does not have a chance to read what they are about. And he goes to Marty's home to give her a court order that prevents her from any rights regarding baby Hope. Rex and Gigi are back sleeping together and admit that they have waited too long. Langston and Robert go to Capricorn together and Blair makes it clear she disapproves and wants to prove to Langston that Robert cannot be faithful. Langston tells Robert that things are good between them. But she's not going to have sex with him again.",
