As the officer informed Marty that she'd had Cole take a drug test, Marty protested but was reminded that her son faced a list of charges, and the drug test was necessary. Cole left with the officer to get the results of his test, leaving Marty, Todd, Blair, and Starr alone in the room.\n\n\nBlair wondered if that was part of Marty's plan to get back at Todd by going after Starr. Marty insisted that she had not known that Starr attended the same school as Cole. She told them that after Patrick had died, she'd decided to move back to Llanview and had checked to see if Starr was attending but had been told that she was not registered there. When Todd wondered how much Cole knew about the past, Marty informed them that she had not told Cole and begged them to allow her to tell her son about their history.\n\n\nCole stepped back into the room and was told in front of his mother that steroids had been found in his system. A disappointed Marty escorted Cole out but not before he tried to apologize to Starr for his behavior. After finding out from Cole that his assault against Starr had been in the form of name-calling and destroying a bedroom, Marty revealed that she was the woman who Todd Manning had raped when they had been in college.\n\n\nBack at the penthouse, Blair kept Starr from running off into her room so that they could talk about the evening's events. Starr pulled away from Blair to ask Todd if he had raped Marty. Todd admitted that he had indeed raped Marty. Starr told her mother that if Todd could admit what he had done, then she should also be allowed to do so.\n\n\nWhen Blair tried to calm Starr down, Starr told them that she wanted to be alone. She also told them that being in the same room with the woman her father had raped and knowing that she was Cole's mother made everything worse. After Starr ran upstairs, a distraught Todd wondered about the damage he had done.\n\n\nRex was torn as to what he should do, since he had found out that Michael and Marcie's adopted son, Tommy, was Todd's biological child. Adriana tried to help Rex figure out what to do. While they both agreed that Michael and Marcie were great parents and would be devastated to find out the news of Tommy's parentage, Adriana felt that Todd had a right to know who his son was.\n\n\nRex agreed and wondered if Todd would give up, knowing that his son was being raised in a loving home, but he knew that Todd would never relinquish custody to Marcie and Michael. Rex decided that only he and Adriana should ever know the truth, but Adriana disagreed, saying that the truth was too big to keep even if the truth might cause pain to those involved. Michael and Marcie arrived with Tommy and asked Rex for an update on his search for Tommy's parents.\n\n\nDorian had a hard time getting used to the idea that Kelly had decided to move to London with Kevin and the baby. She reached out to Clint as a friend, and he told her that Kelly was the happiest she had been in months. Dorian wondered how Kelly and Kevin could really be happy after Kelly had had a baby with Duke. Clint reminded her that although Kelly had gotten pregnant after spending one night with Duke, it was Kevin who she had truly had the baby with. Since Kevin had gotten past the betrayal and anger from what had happened, he was there for Kelly and Zane and wanted to be a family with them.\n\n\nDorian agreed that although she was not happy about the situation, she knew that she had to let Kelly go and find her happiness, even if it was with Kevin and out of Llanview. When a glowing Kelly walked out of Zane's hospital room, Dorian said that she was more confident than Dorian had seen her in months and that although Dorian might have seemed harsh at times, all she had ever wanted was to protect the woman she thought of as her daughter. Kelly was happy that Dorian had accepted her decision, and they share a tearful goodbye.\n\n\nNatalie and Vincent pulled Bo aside during the recess from Spencer's arraignment to tell him that Hugh had brown eyes, but the man who was lying in his hospital bed had blue eyes -- and they believed that John was the man who had survived the fiery crash. Bo had a hard time processing what they were saying, and when Paige overheard them discussing John surviving the accident, he pulled her away. Bo explained that Natalie was having a hard time dealing with the loss of John and that she shouldn't worry about what Natalie had said.\n\n\nPaige told Bo that she believed that Vincent was a good man and that Bo shouldn't worry about their friendship, since she had seen a side of him after observing him by Hugh's bedside day after day. John told Natalie that he didn't have the heart to tell Paige that she might have lost her son after just finding him. He assured Natalie that once he had all the facts, he would tell Paige the truth. Natalie vowed to find out the truth for herself and headed straight to the hospital.\n\n\nAs Evangeline and Spencer's lawyer geared up for the battle ahead, Evangeline wondered if David was ready to testify against Spencer. After getting the go-ahead from David, Evangeline vowed to win the case for John.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "\"You set this up Marty! You were just biding your time!\" Blair makes a move to whack the woman but Detective Bauer is there to see that doesn't happen. Todd is suspicious of Cole's involvement with his daughter. He thinks that Cole knew who Starr was before he started trying to date her. He becomes confused saying that he has no idea what Todd is taking talking about. \"Who are you people? How are you connected?\" The detective tells that there has been a tox screen done on Cole and the results are ready. He leaves and Marty starts explaining how she enrolled Cole in school the year before and at that time Starr wasn't there. She had no idea that Starr was there now. Blair doesn't believe her. She feels that the woman is the same liar that she was when she accused Todd of rape all those years ago. Marty says that her husband died and she felt disconnected and wanted to come home. Blair isn't buying and even tries to take a swing at the woman at one point. Dorian overhears Kelly talking to Clint about moving to London and that is how she is notified. She takes it badly at first but then Clint makes her realize that she has to let Kelly go if that will make her happy. Dorian does her best to accept what's going to happen. Evangeline preps David for his turn on the stand. He says that he is fine and has been ready for this his whole life. Bo thinks that Natalie is losing her mind when she says that John is alive but when Vincent comes and helps to explain things, Bo sees that there might be something to what the kids are saying. He can't tell Paige anything yet. She just got her son back and can't lose him again. The test shows that Cole has been on steroids. The owners of the house aren't pressing charges if Cole does restitution. The only thing to clear up is what exactly was done to Starr at the party. Cole apologizes to Starr and he and his mother leave. He explains about the pressure at school to win games and how it prompted him to take the steroids. \"Now tell me how you know those people.\" Marty tells that when she was in college, she met Todd and something terrible happened, that was very bad. She doesn't have to spell it out. Cole gets it easily enough. Starr asks her mother why she hates Marty. Blair doesn't want to get into that. \"Dad did you rape her?\" Todd admits that he did. \"Why are you always in such denial mom?\" Rex and Adriana are on different sides of the fence. He wants to keep Tommy's secret, and Adriana thinks that Rex needs to tell all he knows to his clients. They turn and Michael and Marcie are behind them with Tommy asking about their case.",
