    "soap_central": "\n A Lie Of The Mind \n\n\nMarty arrived home with Nora, and stood by awkwardly while Nora expressed her sympathy to Cole over the death of his baby. Finally, an uncomfortable Marty spoke up, voicing her sorrow as well. Cole could only see the miracle of his mother's return. When Nora received a call to report to work, Cole fearlessly sat with Marty, trying to help her piece together her past. Marty was happy that Nora had been there for Cole, but was curious as to how he could make a baby with Starr, knowing what he did about Todd's past. He explained that he and Starr had been going out together for quite some time before that and that Marty herself had approved of their relationship. \n\n\nMarty asked about Cole's father and was handed a photo album. She learned that she'd had a husband. Cole filled her in on Patrick Thornhart and how both Patrick and Marty had been teachers. She looked at her wedding portrait and heard how they had traveled to California to get away from some people who had caused Patrick some trouble. She was curious to learn that Patrick had been Irish and that her accident had taken place in that country. She was surprised to hear that John had taken care of Cole after the accident, and wondered what role John had played in her own life. \n\n\nDorian advised Blair that she was going to get answers regarding Starr's baby. Blair took offense to Dorian's reading the Intruder with its headline, \"Bizarre Love Nest,\" that featured pictures of Todd and Marty. Dorian suggested that Blair really needed to yell and be angry. Refusing, citing her children nearby, Blair tossed a vase instead, hoping that her aunt was happy. Dorian thought that a less expensive coffee mug would have been better, but said it was a start. Blair felt angry that her priority should have been comforting Starr, but instead she was dealing with the revelations involving Todd. How sick was it, she wondered, that Todd had fallen in love with Marty? Dorian not only agreed, but felt that Todd was sick and capable of doing anything. \n\n\nWhen Blair revealed Todd's plan to steal Starr's baby, Dorian could only exclaim, \"I could kill him.\" \"Yeah, well take a number,\" Blair replied. Blair admitted to feeling sorry for Marty, pointing out that the woman had lost everything. This brought Dorian much pride for her niece, reminding Blair how the women used to have a toxic relationship, much like the one between Blair and Todd. She wondered, though, if Marty and Blair would be fighting over John in the future. \n\n\nThrilled to see her daughter out of bed, even though she was in a straitjacket, Viki greeted her enthusiastically. \"Do I look like Jessie to you?\" Tess snarled at her. Demanding to see her baby, Tess was less than thrilled when Viki made it known that she preferred to discuss it with Jessica, even though she was glad that Tess was no longer hiding. She accused Tess of hurting Jessica. The women began to argue, with Tess not letting up on her demands to see her baby. She promised that she would allow Jessica to return afterwards. Viki was sure that Jessica would fight, but Tess thought that was highly unlikely, considering that Jessica was locked up. Tess informed Viki that the baby was hers, not Jessica's. \n\n\nThe women began to argue over who was worse, Tess or Jessica. While Tess had committed awful deeds, Jessica ignored them, Tess pointed out. She wondered if Jessica was actually part of her, rather than the other way around. \n\n\nMeanwhile, a caged Jessica met Bess who called herself \"a friend.\" She asked that Jessica do as she said, even as Jessica insisted that she be let out. Bess explained that she gave her word to Tess because Jessica's eyes were always closed to everything. She always stopped short and only went so far in her actions. Bess was surprised that Jessica's eyes were opened this time. She wanted Jessica to go along with her so that it would be easier for everyone. She informed Jessica that she would take care of her for her own good, same as always. \n\n\n\"What else have you done?\" Jessica inquired. Bess quietly replied that whatever she had done had been for Jessica's good. She added that whatever Jessica didn't know wouldn't hurt her. Furthermore, any help that Tess had provided had been incidental, while she, Bess, always stepped in if necessary. Jessica learned that Bess was the gatekeeper and wondered if there were any more alters. Instead of answering her question, Bess told her to get some rest, and that she was monitoring the situation and would take over if she had to. \n\n\nTess needed to see the baby, since she was the only one who knew her, Bess stated. Jessica accused Bess of not being able to control Tess. She also thought that the alters were supposed to help, her but it didn't seem like that was happening. Tess would do or say anything to remain in control. Bess thought Jessica made a good point. She decided to set Jessica free. \n\n\nWhen the baby arrived, Tess went crazy. \"I warned you, no games,\" she screamed at Viki. She insisted that the baby wasn't hers and that someone had stolen her child. As she continued to scream and hurl accusations, Viki slapped her. Suddenly, Jessica reappeared. She informed her mother that she had met another alter. \n\n\nTess ended back in the locked cage, with Bess assuring her that because she had caused trouble, the experiment would not be repeated. Tess insisted that they had brought her the wrong kid. There was no mix-up, Bess replied. She told Tess to get some rest. \n\n\nMichael paid John a visit and wondered why his brother was still locked up when he had saved Marty's life. John mentioned the variety of additional charges that he was facing. Michael sadly told him of all of the gifts that awaited Marcie after Starr's baby was born. He was in pain because Marcie was in pain. John assured him that he wasn't alone. Michael enlightened his brother with the same response; that he wasn't alone in his situation, and he felt it was all political. John was just sorry that he hadn't made his moves sooner. Michael pleaded with John not to shoot his mouth off. John was only concerned that Marty receive help. He was worried about her, since it took so long for her to recover from her long-ago rape. \n\n\nBo went over the statement of Officer Webster, who insisted that he had found John on the ground in his cell and the next thing he knew, he was down on the ground himself, with John gone. According to Antonio, the cop was sticking to that story. Bo was sorry that he couldn't change anything himself, but felt that John would have to pay for being a rogue cop. Antonio was hopeful that perhaps Marty could help out, though Bo was loathe to have a victim make such a move. The mayor arrived looking for John, and demanded John be brought up, so that he could take his badge. \n\n\nComplaining that John had made a mockery of them, the mayor insisted that John would pay. Bo reminded him of his last wrong moves, when he clamped down, concerning Lee Ramsey. Nora informed him that she didn't answer to him and it was up to her as to whether she prosecuted John or not. The mayor was informed further that the citizens of Llanview were probably not on his side. \n\n\nIn the outer office, a reporter stopped John and referred to him as a superhero. A modest John stated that he was just doing his job, while Bo commented in a whisper to Nora that John was Batman. John revealed that he had been asking for warrants, but probably couldn't get them because Todd had donated money. Michael broke in, announcing that elected officials had blocked the rescue attempt  Annoyed, the mayor stepped up and irritably pronounced that John had broken the law and he would not allow him to get away with it. \n\n\nAs the reporter began to question the mayor, the mayor suddenly, and quite eerily, changed his tune. He caused applause to break out when he abruptly stated that no charges would be filed. John would be put on administrative leave for a month and his records would reflect his insubordination, but he showed some dynamic police work, the mayor beamed. John's bravery did the city proud, he concluded. He offered to pin John's badge back on. Michael leaned in to say how grateful John was. \"Take your badge, take your job and shove it,\" John growled.\n\n\n",
