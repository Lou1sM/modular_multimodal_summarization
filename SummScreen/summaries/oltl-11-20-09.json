    "soap_central": "\nWho's your Daddy?\n\n\nInside John's apartment, Natalie vowed to return to Napa and cause harm to Mitch Laurence.   Insisting that Natalie needed to focus on her family and find a way to say goodbye to Jared, John pleaded with Natalie not to allow Mitch to ruin her life.\n\n\nInside his cell at a jail in Napa, Mitch smiled as he spied the gun inside a guard's holster.  Mitch asked the guard for a Bible.  Sliding the Bible through the bars, the guard suggested that Mitch pray for a miracle.  With a sly grin, Mitch replied, \"Friend, that's exactly what I'm going to do.\"\n\n\nAfterward, Mitch read passages from the Bible and occasionally called out, \"Father, take me out of this prison so I can praise your name!\"\n\n\nAt the cottage, Rex answered the phone but the caller hung up after hearing Rex's voice.  Unbeknownst to Rex, the caller was Schuyler.  Later, Gigi listened as Rex expressed resentment over learning that Mitch Laurence was his birth father.  Gigi reminded Rex that things could be worse -- he could be romantically involved with Stacy.  Gigi's words caused Rex to shudder as he thought about raising a child with Stacy.   Apologizing for allowing Corrine to lead him on a wild goose chase and causing him to abandon Gigi, Rex promised that he would never leave her again.  Recalling that he had promised to check on Natalie, Rex phoned John to get an update on the situation in Napa.\n\n\nRex was shocked when John informed him that Jared had been murdered, and that Natalie was in a terrible state.  Gigi insisted that Rex rush over to John's apartment and offer Natalie his support.  Once Rex had left the cottage, Schuyler appeared on Gigi's doorstep, and announced that he had waited for Rex to leave.   A guilty Gigi asked Schuyler to leave, but Schuyler informed her that Stacy and Kim had overheard Roxy state that Gigi had stayed overnight in Schuyler's apartment.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Kim helped Stacy affix padding to Stacy's flat stomach.  Kim related that she had stolen the padding from a maternity ward.  She was convinced that the enhancement would help trick Rex into believing that Stacy was farther along in her pregnancy.  As the ladies finally managed to properly place the padding inside Stacy's clothing, Roxy barged into the loft and demanded to know why Stacy had summoned Roxy.\n\n\nA cocky Stacy said that she had a job for Roxy .  Stacy instructed Roxy to tell Rex that she had spotted Gigi leaving Schuyler's apartment.  Stacy threatened to reveal the identity of Roxy's mystery donor, unless Roxy carried out Stacy's orders.   With a smirk, Roxy related that Rex had learned the identity of the donor and advised Stacy that she no longer had anything to hold over Roxy's head.   Insisting that Schuyler and Gigi's relationship was innocent, Roxy glared at Stacy and stated, \"Rex will never let a scammer like you raise his child. You remind him too much of his mother.\"\n\n\nBack at the cottage,   Gigi panicked upon learning that Stacy and Kim were aware of the night she had spent inside Schuyler's apartment.  Gigi was certain that Stacy and Kim would tell Rex about their discovery.   Gigi regretted that she hadn't been honest with Rex.  Instantly, Gigi began to feel guilty about focusing on her own problems and expressed concern over Jared.    As Rex attempted to comfort Gigi, Roxy entered the cottage and attacked him.   Roxy accused Schuyler of chasing after Gigi.  After calming Roxy, Schuyler stated that he had warned Gigi about Stacy and Kim.    A frustrated Roxy announced, \"They're not wasting any time!\"\n\n\nRoxy pleaded with Gigi to tell Rex the truth before Stacy interfered.  Gigi promised to tell Rex the truth once he returned from his visit with Natalie.  Realizing that Roxy was unaware of Jared's death, Gigi told Roxy that Rex had gone to John's apartment to be by Natalie's side.   When Roxy learned that Natalie was in trouble and that Rex might encounter Stacy at the hotel, Roxy raced off to find her children.\n\n\nAfterward, Schuyler urged Gigi to avoid telling Rex about their night together.  Consumed with guilt, Gigi thought she should confess the truth to Rex before Stacy caused a problem.  Reminding Gigi that they hadn't done anything wrong, Schuyler believed that he could convince Stacy to keep quiet.  Once Schuyler had left, Gigi stared at a photo of her and Rex during happier times.\n\n\nBack at John's apartment, Natalie thanked John for being a good friend and promised not to travel to Napa to avenge Jared's death.    As Natalie discussed making arrangements for Jared, Rex arrived and Natalie cried in her brother's arms.  While Rex consoled Natalie, John left the siblings alone.\n\n\nRex listened as Natalie detailed the events that had led to Jared's murder.  Rex was shocked to learn that Mitch Laurence was alive and had killed Jared.  Rex reminded Natalie that Mitch was dead.  Relating that Mitch had lured both her  and Jessica to Napa, Natalie informed Rex that Mitch was alive and well.    A look of horror crossed Roxy's face as she entered the apartment and heard Natalie's announcement.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy and Kim devised a plan.  The friends decided to plant a pair of Gigi's underwear inside Schuyler's apartment and lead Rex to the evidence.    Stacy was certain that Schuyler would realize that they were the culprits.  As the women continued to discuss possible strategies, Kim helped Stacy, who was having a difficult time, remove her padding.  At that moment, Schuyler burst into the loft and discovered Stacy's secret -- a padded stomach.\n\n\n Back at the jail in Napa, the guard announced that Mitch had a visitor.  Standing to his feet, Mitch greeted his visitor.  Smiling at the unknown person, Mitch boasted to the guard that God had heard and answered his prayer.\n\n\nAt the Seattle hospital, Todd encountered Danielle outside of Matthew's room.  Unaware of the other person's identity, both Todd and Danielle rubbed each other the wrong way, and began hurling insults at one another.  Meanwhile, Rachel stepped away and placed a call to T\u00e9a.  Upon receiving T\u00e9a's voicemail, a panicked Rachel whispered into the phone, \"T\u00e9a please call me back, Todd is talking to his daughter right now!\"\n\n\nTodd was convinced that Rachel and Greg were hiding something from him, and he was determined to gain entry into Matthew's room.  Danielle warned Todd to step away from the door, but Todd smirked and informed the teen that she didn't know who she was talking to.   As Rachel and Greg tried to lure Todd away from the door, Todd and Danielle continued to argue like archenemies.  Rachel tried to separate the two, but Todd refused to leave the hospital until he uncovered T\u00e9a's secret.\n\n\nFed up with Todd's antics, Danielle demanded to know her mother's whereabouts.   Todd listened as Rachel promised to locate Danielle's mother.   As Rachel ushered Todd from Matthew's door, Danielle asked Greg about Todd.   Danielle confided in Greg that Todd frightened her.  When Greg announced that he was going to call security to remove Todd from the premises, Todd stated, \"Call security and find out where T\u00e9a is!\"  Danielle demanded to know why Todd was looking for her mother.  Todd was stunned when Danielle related that T\u00e9a was his mother.\n\n\nA shocked Todd asked, \"Are you saying my T\u00e9a is your mother?  If T\u00e9a is your mom, who's your dad?\"    As Danielle stared at Todd in disbelief, Rachel did her best to usher Todd away.  Todd continued to badger Danielle, and began to demand her date of birth.  When Todd remarked that T\u00e9a was his wife, Danielle informed Todd that T\u00e9a was married to her father.  An aggravated Todd demanded to know the name of Danielle's father.  Danielle proudly announced that her father was Ross Rayburn.\n\n\nInside T\u00e9a's hotel room in Seattle, T\u00e9a presented Ross with the DNA test that listed Todd as Danielle's father.    Tears streamed down Ross's face as T\u00e9a declared, \"You're not Danielle's father, Todd is!\"  Meanwhile, T\u00e9a's cell phone rang.  Convinced that the document was a forgery, Ross informed T\u00e9a that he wouldn't allow her to keep him from his daughter.  When T\u00e9a offered to provide Ross the opportunity to conduct his own DNA test, Ross demanded to know the location of his daughter.   T\u00e9a feared that Ross might harm Danielle once he realized that she was Todd's daughter.   Realizing that it would be difficult to convince Ross of the truth, T\u00e9a informed Ross that Danielle was with a friend, and agreed to phone the friend and make arrangements to conduct another paternity test.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a attempted to phone Rachel, she noticed that she had a voicemail.  Retrieving her voicemail, T\u00e9a panicked when she heard Rachel's message concerning Todd and Danielle.  Realizing that something was wrong, Ross snatched T\u00e9a's phone.  A look of horror crossed his face as he listened to Rachel's message.  Convinced that Todd was feeding Danielle lies about him, Ross ordered T\u00e9a to take him to Danielle.   Insisting that he was taking his daughter back to Tahiti, Ross told T\u00e9a that she was welcome to tag along.  As a frantic Ross began to pack Danielle's clothes, T\u00e9a attempted to calm him and offered to allow him visitation.  Refusing to lose his daughter, Ross warned T\u00e9a that she would be sorry.\n\n\nTodd threatened to tell Danielle awful things about Ross unless Rachel revealed T\u00e9a's whereabouts.   Promising not to harm  T\u00e9a , Todd insisted that he just wanted to talk to T\u00e9a.  Rachel informed Todd that he could locate T\u00e9a at the hotel across the street.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside T\u00e9a's hotel room, T\u00e9a attempted to escape from the room, but Ross forced her back inside.  As a terrified T\u00e9a screamed, Ross viciously beat her.\n\n\n",
