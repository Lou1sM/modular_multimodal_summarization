Viki was stunned and worried not only about Natalie but about Paige, who had just found her son, and about Spencer, who could become capable of anything should he find out his son was dead.\n\n\nDavid took the stand in his brother's trial after being sworn in with his other right hand. Evangeline took him back to the night of Thomas McBain's shooting. David revisited that night for the judge and jury. He identified the gun that had been in his possession that night, and the twin gun that his father had given Spencer. Evangeline showed the ballistics report that showed that the gun David had fired couldn't have killed Thomas McBain, since it had been loaded with blanks. She went on to show that the bullet that had entered McBain had been fired from the twin gun that belonged to Spencer.\n\n\nOn cross-examination, Spencer's lawyer tried to discredit David by showing that he was a liar, had multiple arrests under his belt, and was only testifying against Spencer because he wouldn't make David his power of attorney. Evangeline returned and had David identify a photo of Spencer and their father holding the twin guns.\n\n\nCole was shocked by the news that his mother was the woman Todd had raped and wondered why Todd was not still in prison. Marty explained that Todd had proven that he could be a better person and that he was truly remorseful for what he had done. Cole wondered if his mother truly believed that Todd had changed. Although Marty confessed that she believed that Todd was capable of hurting people in other ways, she did not believe that he would rape another woman.\n\n\nCole asked Marty if she had truly forgiven Todd for what he had done to her. Marty told Cole that in order to move on with her life, marry the man she loved, and have his child, she had needed to forgive Todd. Marty believed that it was only through forgiveness that she and Todd had been able to move on. Marty also believed that Cole needed to seek the same thing from Starr in order for them to start healing.\n\n\nBlair tried to get Todd to talk to Starr about what was happening with their family and Marty Saybrooke's. Blair believed that Todd had repented for the sins of his past and that Starr loved him and respected him as her hero and always would, even if Todd couldn't see that. Todd wasn't in the mood to get things off his chest, which caused an infuriated Blair to kick him out. As Todd was leaving, Starr walked downstairs and wondered if her father was really leaving.\n\n\nWhen Blair was called away to testify against Spencer, Todd tried to strike up a conversation with Starr. At first, Starr pulled away, but then she confessed that although she was not afraid of her father, there were times when he appeared to be somewhere else that could be troubling. She assured Todd that Cole had not raped her but that he had frightened her when he had been somewhere else.\n\n\nAfter talking with Starr, Todd decided to do what he needed to do to protect his daughter. He went down to the high school and demanded that Cole be expelled from school. When the principal did not agree with Todd on how things should be handled, Todd issued a threat, but Marty interrupted and warned Todd that if he went after her family, she would go after his.\n\n\nSeeing how happy Tommy had made Michael and Marcie weighed on Rex's soul as he struggled with whether he should tell them the truth about what he had discovered. When Rex wondered about the real reason Michael and Marcie wanted to find out about Tommy's parents, they told him they were not so much worried about his parents wanting him back as they were concerned about his family history, especially medically. Marcie went on about how she couldn't believe how the courts could take away children from parents who loved them and give them back to biological parents who had initially given them up for some reason but had changed their minds.\n\n\nWhen Michael and Marcie wondered if Rex had found Tommy's parents, Rex lied and said that he had yet to uncover the names. Adriana wondered why Rex hadn't told them, and Rex told her that he felt he was caught in a bad situation. He felt that taking the baby away from Michael and Marcie or Todd was going to be a disaster. Marcie returned to tell Rex that she was happy to finally see the soft side that Jen had always boasted about and how grateful she was that Tommy had such a good person looking out for him as his godfather.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd is not happy. He sees that he has greatly hurt his family by the actions from the past and he feels that he should move away from them to save them. Blair disagrees with his way of thinking. She knows that the kids will suffer without their father and she promises to set out to prove that. \"John!\" Natalie has arrived at the hospital again but the bandaged man isn't in his room again. Viki walks up to Natalie. She got a call from Bo that Natalie might go there. Natalie starts explaining that she didn't believe that John was alive at first but now she does. Viki listens to her plead her case and decides that she believes her daughter. She does want Natalie to remember though that there are other people that will be hurt if this is true. Natalie realizes that and is sad to think that Paige may be hurt in all this. \"Get a load of that Evangeline eh?\" David chats Spencer up, trying to make him nervous about the trial. \"I never lose,\" Spencer spits. \"Yeah? Well Blair is off at home with Todd enjoying eternal bliss. What was that you were saying about never losing?\" David gets on the stand and gives his testimony. He tells the story of how Thomas came to his injury in the alley, and he positively ID's the guns that his father had given both he and Spencer. Todd feels terrible and wants to move out. Blair tries her best to convince Todd that he is looking at things all wrong. Finally, she gives up and opens the front door. \"Fine! Get out! I have two kids to raise and I have to get to it!\" Todd starts walking to the door. \"Dad!\" Starr has come down and he stops walking. Blair forgets that she has to give her testimony today and she leaves. Todd and Starr will stay home and talk about things. Mr. Casey gets his turn to ask David questions. He brings up David selling a baby, his being incarcerated 4 times, his pretending that he was related to Dorian's family and offering to work for the defense if Spencer would sign over his Power of Attorney. David did all those things but Evangeline is still happy with the outcome. \"Casey missed a whole closet full of your offenses.\" Marcie guesses that Rex has found out the info that she and Michael want but Rex says nothing. Adriana isn't pleased that he is keeping the secret. Todd tells Starr that they have to have a talk but right now he has something to do. Todd goes to the high school and tells the principal to expel Cole. She can't do that without information. \"You do it or you will find your face on the front page of my paper tomorrow.\" The woman is stunned. \"Over my dead body.\" Marty is standing behind him. \"You come after my son, and I come after you!\"",
