Todd threatened to kill Cole, and the pair was off to the fights, with threats and reminders of the past. Marty assured Todd that Cole had been affected by the steroids but was really a good boy and would never do drugs again. He wondered how she could be so sure when she hadn't noticed him taking them in the first place. She said she'd been in a nightmare after the death of her husband, and she remembered what had happened with Todd every day of her life.\n\n\nTodd apologized for every day that had gone by and for all the days of the future, but he wouldn't let Cole off the hook. When the principal stated that she alone could not make the decision to expel the boy, Todd announced that he was pulling Starr out of the school. She was in danger there and could no longer attend.\n\n\nCole showed up at the penthouse to apologize to Starr face-to-face; she finally relented and opened the door to let him in. He felt that he owed her more than just an \"I'm sorry\" but didn't know how to say it. He'd felt like he was a spectator, watching the entire thing from above, but hadn't known how to stop it. He was really not that guy -- it was the drugs. He knew he had also said some very mean things, but he'd felt pressured to be the big football star, which also meant that he would have sex after the game. He'd wanted to be the big hero and make his mom happy. He knew it was all wrong.\n\n\nStarr felt as though she, too, should apologize for what her father had done to his mother. Cole was unhappy that he'd found out about that and sorry that he'd made Starr feel even a little of what his own mother had to have been feeling. As the two tried to express their feelings, Todd returned home, saw Cole, and went crazy, roughly grabbing him away from Starr. She tried to stop him, but he was beyond angry and tossed the boy out.\n\n\nStarr couldn't believe Todd was treating Cole so badly after what he himself had done. He couldn't change things that had happened in the past and had to protect her in the present, he responded. He forbade her to see Cole anymore and, in fact, had pulled her out of the school. She was inconsolable, especially since he was the one who had raped someone.\n\n\nBlair was sworn in to testify at Spencer's trial, after arriving late, having forgotten about it, and she began to recount how they had met and how he had pursued her. She fainted, though, and the trial halted. Michael helped her, and upon questioning, he learned that she felt that her brain tumor had returned. He suggested she go into the hospital for some tests. She wouldn't allow him to call Todd because she didn't want him to know.\n\n\nSpencer's attorney was pretty happy and wouldn't even care if she dropped dead, he said. An incensed Spencer grabbed him, hurting him, and advised that he would always love Blair. Another witness was called instead, and Blair would be recalled at a later time. The attorney stepped out and was late returning, which caused the judge to grow angry.\n\n\nRex and Adriana were at Rodi's and debated on how he should handle what he'd learned and who to tell, if indeed he did. They decided to head back to his place to talk about it but ran into Roxy on the way out. He was short with her, though Adriana apologized for him, citing that he was under a lot of pressure. She noted that \"it's hard to figure out what to do when you're a Balsom.\"\n\n\nNash appeared with Brennan, and he and Roxy had a chat. She mentioned that she'd seen how he looked when Jessica was around, and she knew he loved her. He denied ever having any feelings for her; it was Tess he was in love with. She told him it was time to move on.\n\n\nPuerto Rico was the destination for the honeymooners. Jessica had a slight problem when a man, who at first glance appeared to be Nash, distracted her.\n\n\nAdriana tried to play a game with Rex, based on the morals game they'd played previously with Roxy. Maybe he could convince Todd to let the McBains keep the baby.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr goes to the stand. She starts answering Evangeline's questions but then something is wrong. Her head falls forward as if too heavy. She soon looks totally lethargic. She gets up from her seat and walks before the judge where she faints. Michael rushes forward and gets her conscious again. Spencer tries to get to her but the guards hold him back. Michael wants to call Todd but Blair will not let him. Roxy finds Nash in the restaurant with Brennan sharing a snack at their table. He acts like things are great, but Roxy tells him that she has been watching him and she knows that he has the hots for Jessica. Cole comes to see Starr and eventually she lets him in. He apologizes again for what he did. He knows that the steroids had a lot to do with it but he knows that can't be used as an excuse. Cole is at the school with Marty and he tells her that in spite of what he did to her all those years ago that will not make him go easy on Cole. He will kill the boy if he comes near Starr again. The principal returns to see if things are okay between the two, and again Todd asks her to kick that kid out of school. She can't do it without totally reviewing all that has gone on. Todd knows that will take 6 months. He can see that his daughter isn't safe in that school and decides he's pulling her out. Todd goes home and sees Cole in his house with his daughter. He shouts at the kid and takes giant steps over to Cole. He grabs him and tosses him into a chair, telling him that if he ever comes near Starr again, he will be killed. Cole jumps to his feet and they are nose to nose while Starr shouts at her father to stop! Todd throws the kid out and turns to his daughter telling her that this isn't negotiable. She will not be seeing that kid again. When he tells her that he has pulled her from the school, she gets hysterical and runs to her room. Antonio and Jessica are in Puerto Rico and they go to a restaurant where they kiss and gaze at each other. Jessica sees a man coming into their area over Antonio's shoulder and when she sees the man's face, for a split second she thinks that she is looking at Nash. Nash has the baby all to himself and he takes her out to a restaurant for snacks from a plate. Roxy crashes that party and makes herself at home with a bottle of 2004 wine. It was a very good year! Nash teaches her how to savor wine and while she is swirling it, he is reminded of the time when he taught Tess the very same thing. Blair thinks that her tumor is acting up like it did so long ago and doesn't want Todd to know about it. Michael isn't sure that is what is wrong with her but he offers to examine her when she has the time.",
