It was a court order, and Todd advised Marty that she was to stay away from Hope. \"You brought this all on yourself,\" he told her. He walked inside and told a distressed Marty that she had nearly gotten Starr and Hope killed due to her vouching for Hannah. Marty tried to argue and admitted that while she'd made a bad call, she'd thought she could help Hannah. Todd didn't want to hear it. He hoped that Marty would lose her license, because she had emotional issues. Marty exploded and reminded Todd that she had emotional issues after all that Todd had done to her, and after all that she had lost.\n\n\nMarty could hardly control her rage, as she accused Todd of having bad timing. Her son was in prison, she'd lost the baby she'd really wanted, and he wanted to keep her from her granddaughter. Todd claimed that he only wanted what was best, but Marty refused to allow him to get away with it. A lot had happened to her since college, and she'd learned how to fight back, Marty informed him. Todd was hardly sorry, and he told her she'd have to \"deal with it.\" He called her dangerous and toxic, just like her son. Marty didn't think that Starr would accept Todd's move, but he revealed that Starr's signature was on the paper. He gloated as Marty stormed out.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Brody and Jessica were ready to look at the results of the DNA test. Brody promised to marry and love Jessica \"no matter what happens.\" He wouldn't allow Bobby to get between them, and he considered the baby to be his and Jessica's. They slowly looked at the first page, and they discovered that the baby was healthy. Jessica was hesitant and stopped to ask Brody if they should look at the baby's sex. She wanted to be surprised and make it into a true happy ending. Brody was fine with that, and Jessica proceeded to look at the paternity test results.\n\n\n\"Oh my God,\" she uttered. They looked at the results and were ecstatic to see that Brody was the baby's father. They laughed and cried. They were ready to be happy.\n\n\nNatalie was at the hospital and ready to look at her test results, but she was interrupted when John called out to her. \"What are you doing in the genetics lab?\" he wanted to know. He had seen her headed in that direction. He was there to talk to a witness in a case. Suddenly, he saw the papers in Natalie's hand and inquired if she had the test results. He grasped her hand and looked for himself, but he was confused. \"What does this mean?\" he asked.\n\n\nNatalie read the page quickly and advised him that their baby was perfect. John heaved a sigh of relief and exclaimed that all their worry had been for nothing. He wanted to look at the rest of the report, but Natalie kept him at bay. She didn't want him to read the report if he didn't want to know the baby's sex, she maintained. The information was at the end. John thought that he might want to find out, but Natalie felt that they shouldn't jinx things. She wanted to save the suspense until the baby was born, and John consented.\n\n\nHe divulged that he was happy, even if she couldn't tell. Natalie joked that she was used to \"translating\" John's manner. Just then, John received a phone call from Todd. John advised Natalie that Marty had received a court order, and he would have to leave to stop her from getting into trouble. He couldn't remember ever being as happy as he was. The couple hugged, and John left. Natalie turned her attention back to the test results.\n\n\nThe employee at Buchanan Enterprises who had agreed to perform some tasks for Clint, rushed into Clint's office and began to shout that he was sorry about the lab. The chair swiveled around, and the man was surprised to see that it was Matthew who was sitting there. The excited employee wanted to see Clint, but Matthew advised him that Clint wasn't around. He tried to persuade the employee to give him the information instead, but the man refused. Matthew thought it had been interesting to find a key card for Llanview Hospital in the envelope that Matthew had been asked to deliver to Clint, and he wanted to know what the employee was doing with it.\n\n\nRex, Clint, Viki, Charlie, and Echo gathered at Rex's place to learn the results of the DNA test. Rex pulled the first page from the envelope and announced that Echo was his mother. \"Congratulations,\" Clint said as he fiddled with his cell phone and sent text messages. Echo stated that the news was anything but news to her, and she was happy that everyone else knew the truth. She wondered how Rex felt about it, and he was quick to point out that she'd tried to ruin Viki and Clint's marriage and had abandoned Rex as a baby. He asked how he was supposed to feel after that.\n\n\nEcho agreed that it was all complicated, but Charlie noted that at least Rex knew for certain. Viki was curious as to what Echo had been doing in the years since she'd abandoned Rex, but Echo would only say that it was nothing she was proud of. Echo wanted to get to know Rex and be a part of his life if that were possible, and Rex approved. He would never think of her as his mother, though, he added. Sarcastically, Viki declared that she didn't think Echo would be so presumptuous. Some DNA wasn't the same as actually being a mother, Viki continued.\n\n\nClint sat quietly on the sofa and recalled the conversation he'd had with his employee to alter the DNA test. He jumped up and announced that the rest of the information would have to wait, since he had an urgent meeting to attend. Rex refused to stop, and Viki thought that Clint was trying to stall the disclosure of the identity of Rex's father. Both Viki and Echo were anxious to hear the news. \"And the winner is,\" Rex said as he pulled the sheet of paper from the envelope.\n\n\nHe read it quickly and announced that Charlie was his father. Clint was visibly relieved as Rex congratulated his newly identified parents. Viki looked skeptical as Clint was ready to leave. He advised Rex that their relationship with each other wouldn't have to change. Viki demanded that Clint wait for her, and she cornered him out in the hallway. \"What just happened in there?\" she asked him.\n\n\nClint reminded her that Rex wasn't his son, and she and Dorian had been wrong about their perception. Furthermore, Echo's plan had been spoiled, she was out of his life, and she wouldn't get any Buchanan money. He was only sorry that Echo would be \"smack dab in the middle\" of Viki's life.\n\n\nBack inside, Charlie expressed his gratitude that he was Rex's father, and he thought of it as a gift. Viki and Echo looked at each other wordlessly. Charlie thought it was a good opportunity for everyone to form \"new bonds.\" Viki thought it was better not to push Rex if he weren't ready for it. Rex agreed that he would try to get used to the idea of his parents, and Charlie asked him for a hug. Affectionately, Echo rubbed Charlie's back, while Viki stood by and shook her head.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Langston was amused to see Bobby's reaction after she'd informed him that they wouldn't be having any sex. He was speechless. Finally, he pronounced that while he loved how unpredictable she was, they'd had sex already. Langston pointed out that sex had been the only thing their relationship had been based on, and she wanted him to get to know all about her. Bobby agreed that he wanted a real relationship, something he'd never had before, but he wasn't certain on how to go about it. Langston added that she wanted him to accept her for other reasons besides sex. Bobby gulped and asked if Langston had meant for them to never have sex again. \"Would that be a problem?\" she asked sweetly.\n\n\nBobby asked if it were even physically possible, and he wondered how it would all work. Langston explained that plenty of people conformed to that decision, but it didn't mean that they would abstain forever. She continued to be amused at Bobby's response to her decision. She thought that they could test it out for six months. She revealed that she'd gotten the idea from Rex and Gigi, and it had worked for them. \"Remind me to thank Rex and Gigi,\" Bobby quipped.\n\n\nHe wondered if \"no touching\" would be next, but Langston stood her ground. She felt they'd be able to prove \"we're for real this time\" to members of her family. Bobby complained that he didn't have to prove anything, but Langston wanted proof for herself as well. He kept repeating six months, but Langston thought he was lucky that it wasn't ten years, which was the time that Starr and Cole would be apart.\n\n\nNatalie returned home and found an excited Brody and Jessica. They told her the news about the paternity test, and Natalie was thrilled for her sister. Jessica left to take care of something, and Brody inquired about Natalie's test results. She told him that John was her baby's father. \"We all lucked out,\" Brody exclaimed. They began to talk about how the stress and worry had all been for nothing.\n\n\nLangston and Bobby were interrupted when Bobby received a phone call. It was Jessica, and she informed him that the baby wasn't his. She told him he was \"off the hook.\" \"I'm happy for you,\" Bobby told her, though obviously he was disappointed. He told Langston about the call, and she thought it was great news, but she looked at his face. \"Isn't it?\" she asked. Bobby concurred that it was good news, but he admitted that he wanted to be a father someday. He'd never thought about it until the incident with Jessica had arisen.\n\n\nHe was worried that he'd be a father like his own, but Langston assured him he could be a good dad. He agreed she was right, and he added that he was ready to consent to Langston's terms. He thought she was worth it.\n\n\nMarty arrived and began to bang loudly on the door, calling out to Starr. John arrived right behind her, and she asked if he were there to arrest her. He calmly explained that she couldn't be there because of the court order. He added that Todd wanted Marty to cause trouble, and Todd had done his best to provoke her. John thought it best if Marty left. He promised to continue to be her friend, and he would make sure she got home.\n\n\nJessica ended her phone call and returned to the study. She overheard Brody and Natalie discussing their stress, and she expressed her sorrow over the fact that everyone else had been under pressure because of her. They agreed they would celebrate the good news after Jessica rested for a while. When she was alone, Natalie looked at her report again.\n\n\nClint returned to his office and dismissed Matthew. Incensed, Clint turned to his employee and demanded to know why the man hadn't called him. The man began to jabber about how stressed he'd been, and due to his headache, he had taken a pill. He had taken the wrong pill and fallen asleep. As he continued to talk non-stop, Clint grabbed the man's lapels. He ordered the employee to tell him what had happened at the lab.\n\n\nThe man revealed that someone had found him there as he had worked quickly to do what Clint had asked. It was a doctor who had walked in. He didn't think the doctor knew he didn't belong there, and she had merely wanted to use the computer. It had been Marty. Clint had to keep the man on track as he continued to digress. The man assured Clint that he'd made sure that Charlie was in the computer as Rex's father.\n\n\nClint asked about the other job, and the man noted how he'd pulled up the names in the computer and found Clint's daughter's name. He flashed back to the names and how he'd stopped at Natalie's name.  He told his boss that he'd fixed Clint's daughter's results too. He had changed the father's name to read Brody Lovett. Clint was happy.\n\n\nJohn and Marty returned to Marty's house, and they found that Todd was still sitting inside. He thanked John for \"upholding the law.\" He turned to Marty and threatened her with jail time if she disobeyed the court order, and then he left. Marty was grateful to John for helping her out, because she felt like a burden. John reminded her that they'd already had that discussion. She asked about Natalie's test results, and John informed her that the baby was fine. Marty was glad to hear it.\n\n\nJohn only hoped he'd be a good father, but he assumed that he and Natalie would \"figure it out.\" Marty replied that he should \"just trust Natalie.\" John looked at her strangely, and advised Marty to let things \"cool down,\" and they would work out. He said goodbye. After he left, Marty removed Natalie's test results from under the sofa. It was a copy of the paper that Natalie had. It stated that there had been a DNA match, and it was Brody Lovett.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Clint's \"contact\" returns to Clint's office appearing as though he's afraid of something and that he ran into a \"problem\" in his attempt to alter Rex's DNA test and the other test Clint asked him to alter of Clint's daughter. But Clint is not there and the guy only runs into Matthew who questions him and he cannot answer Matthew's questions. He tells Matthew that he has private business with Clint. But Matthew can see that he has Clint's key card to enter Llanview Hospital and wonders what is up with that. When Clint returns, the guy confirms that he successfully altered the DNA to prove that Charlie Banks is Rex Balsam's father. He also noticed that when he went in to see the results of \"Clint's daughters\" test, he did in fact notice that \"the other guy\" was the father. But he \"fixed\" it so that it would appear that Brody Lovett is the father. Yet we do not hear him reveal which of Clint's daughters was pregnant by somebody other than Brody. Nor does he reveal which \"other guy\" it was. Back at the house, Jessica and Brody are joyously relieved to see the results revealing that he, instead of Robert Ford is the father of her baby. But Natalie secretly sees the results of her test that say that Brody is the father of her baby. And we do not know which \"revelation\" of Brody's paternity is accurate and which was falsified. Rex finds out that Echo and Charlie are his two biological parents and it's a bit overwhelming for him. Viki still kind of suspects Clint. Jessica calls Robert Ford to reveal that he is \"off the hook\" assuming he will be happy and relieved to find out that he is not the father of her baby. But while with Langston, Robert reveals that this paternity question made him consider some day becoming a father. He also tells her if she wants to go for a long time without having sex, he can do that although he's not used to it. Meanwhile, Todd delivers a court order to Marty that he got Starr to (probably unknowingly) sign to prevent Marty from having rights to baby Hope. He tells her that due to her negligence in letting Hannah O'Connor go free, Starr and Hope could have been killed by Hannah. At that point, she is furious and irrational and not thinking about consequences of her actions. And she's ready to tell John that Natalie is pregnant with Brody's baby, after she's found that out for herself.",
