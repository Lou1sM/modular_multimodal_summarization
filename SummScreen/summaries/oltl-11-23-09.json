Schuyler was convinced that Stacy wasn't pregnant, but a nervous Kim blurted out that Stacy had suffered a miscarriage.   Upon learning that Stacy had lost Rex's child, Schuyler accused Stacy of conning an unsuspecting man into fathering a child, which she had planned to pass off as Rex's.\n\n\nSchuyler was certain that Stacy wanted to trick Rex into believing that she was further along in her pregnancy than she actually was.  Heading toward the door, Schuyler informed Stacy that he was going to tell Rex and Gigi the truth about Stacy's pregnancy.  Cornered, Stacy exposed her bare stomach to Schuyler and announced that Schuyler was the father of her baby.\n\n\nA stunned Schuyler listened as Stacy related that she had drugged him the night they had spent together.  Schuyler reminded Stacy that she had assured him that they never had sex.   Stacy and Kim stated that Stacy wanted Rex's child, not Schuyler's.  As Schuyler panicked at the thought of fathering Stacy's child, Kim suggested that he forget about his one-night stand with Stacy.\n\n\nInside John's room at the Angel Square Hotel, Roxy entered the room as Natalie revealed to Rex that Mitch Laurence was alive and had murdered Jared.  Upon hearing the news of a Mitch sighting, Roxy fainted.  After Roxy regained consciousness, Rex questioned how Mitch could still be alive if Roxy's claims of killing Mitch were true.  Natalie demanded to know the secret that Rex and Roxy were withholding regarding Mitch.   As a helpless Roxy listened, Rex related that Mitch was his father.\n\n\nNatalie wondered if Mitch had raped Roxy years earlier, but Roxy wouldn't reveal the details of how Mitch had fathered Rex.  Upon learning that Roxy had been aware that Mitch had been alive for months, Natalie blamed Roxy for contributing to Jared's death.  Natalie believed that Jared would still be alive if Roxy had been honest with everyone.   A tearful Roxy claimed that she had only wanted to protect everyone from the evil Mitch Laurence.    Rex said that everyone connected to Mitch would have to pay the price for Roxy's mistakes.\n\n\nWhen Rex learned that Mitch was being held in a Napa jail, Rex attempted to phone the facility, but a frantic Roxy stopped him.  Roxy panicked when Rex announced that he wanted to meet his father, and begged Natalie to convince Rex that meeting with Mitch was a bad idea.  A concerned Natalie agreed that Rex should stay as far away from Mitch as possible, but Rex reminded Natalie of the desire she had to meet her family years before .\n\n\nNatalie pleaded with Rex not to reveal his identity to Mitch.   Warning Rex of Mitch's evil nature, Natalie was certain that Mitch would eventually hurt Rex, Shane, and Rex's unborn child.    Insisting that he wanted to speak with Natalie alone, Rex instructed Roxy to leave.  In tears, Roxy proclaimed her love for her children and apologized for the pain she had caused.   Out in the hall, Roxy fell to the floor and wept uncontrollably.\n\n\nBack inside the room, Natalie warned, \"Once you tell Mitch that you're his son, there's no turning back!\"  Natalie begged Rex to speak with Jessica before he paid a visit to Mitch.   Natalie believed that Jessica could give him insight on the horrors that existed as an offspring of Mitch Laurence.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica worried about Natalie's state of mind and expressed the guilt she felt over the pain Mitch had caused her family.  Brody promised Jessica that they would help Natalie deal with her grief.  Brody tried to get Jessica to discuss her feelings, but Jessica shut down and claimed that she didn't want to think about Mitch.   Brody related that he was also in pain, but insisted that they would take care of each other.\n\n\nInside the Napa jail, Mitch spoke to his unknown visitor.  After thanking the visitor for showing up, Mitch stated, \"You have your instructions!  Carry them out to the letter.  My family's future depends on it!\"  Retrieving a pen and pad, Mitch related that he had one more task to complete.   In a letter that he constructed to Jessica, Mitch wrote \"You disobeyed the commandment to honor your father, but with my guidance you will learn contrition.\"  After stating that he looked forward to meeting his granddaughter, Mitch signed the letter \"Dad.\"  Mitch instructed his follower to mail the letter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Brody and Jessica showered.  As Brody pampered Jessica in the shower, she stood motionless.  Afterward, Brody and Jessica went to bed.  Jessica appeared worried as Brody kissed her goodnight.\n\n\nAt the Seattle hospital, Rachel told Todd that T\u00e9a was staying at the hotel across the street.  Nearby, Greg tried to calm Danielle, who was upset to learn that Todd was searching for her mother.  Once Danielle learned that Todd was headed to T\u00e9a's hotel room, Danielle attempted to follow him, but Rachel prevented her from doing so.  Danielle questioned Rachel about Todd, but Rachel only informed the teen that Todd and T\u00e9a had a past.  Convinced that Todd was a threat to her mother, Danielle broke away from Rachel, and ran off to protect her mother from Todd.\n\n\nMeanwhile at the hotel, Ross fought with T\u00e9a.   After an intense struggle, T\u00e9a lay unconscious on her hotel room floor.  Todd stormed into the room and discovered Ross kneeling over an unconscious T\u00e9a.  After pulling Ross away from T\u00e9a, Todd struck Ross, and helped T\u00e9a regain consciousness.\n\n\nUpon regaining consciousness, T\u00e9a screamed for Todd to leave her alone.  As Ross lay injured in the corner, Todd asked, \"Do you two have a kid together?\"   Ross quickly announced that they did indeed have a daughter together.   Placing the paternity test results in her pocket, T\u00e9a appeared nervous.\n\n\nNoticing T\u00e9a's nervous behavior, Todd questioned why T\u00e9a didn't think he could deal with the fact that she had a child.   Commenting on Todd's jealousy issues, T\u00e9a reminded Todd of his actions after being told that Jack was Max's son.   A suspicious Todd wondered why T\u00e9a continued to lie to him once their marriage had ended.  When T\u00e9a refused to answer, Todd exclaimed, \"I think you're scared!  You thought I was going to take her because she's mine.  Is she my daughter?\"  Before T\u00e9a could answer, Danielle rushed into the room.  Spotting her father, an elated Danielle fell into Ross's arms.\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a listened as Ross and Danielle discussed their separation.  Ross insisted that T\u00e9a had kept Danielle hidden from him.  Danielle related that T\u00e9a had tried to convince her that Ross was a terrible person.   In a calm tone, Todd  asked T\u00e9a, \"Do you care to tell her or should I?\"  Danielle demanded that Todd stay out of her family's business, but Todd insisted that Danielle leave with her mother immediately.\n\n\n Informing Danielle that Todd was a dangerous man, Ross instructed Danielle never to listen to Todd.  As the teen stared in disbelief, Ross asked Danielle if he had ever lied to her in the past.  Danielle acknowledged that Ross had always been truthful with her.  T\u00e9a pleaded with her daughter to ignore Ross's requests, but Ross insisted that his main priority was to take Danielle somewhere safe.  Todd stated that Ross wasn't leaving the hotel with Danielle.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Greg told Rachel that Matthew was doing fine.  Although Matthew hadn't felt any sensation in his legs, Greg insisted that Matthew was progressing as Greg expected.  When Greg wondered here Danielle had gone, Rachel responded, \"She's with her parents!\"\n\n\nBack at the hotel, Ross announced that he was leaving with Danielle.  Staring at Ross, Todd declared \"If you try and take her, it will be the last step you take!\"  Glaring at Todd, Danielle instructed, \"Leave my dad alone!\"  Todd replied, \"Ross isn't your dad!\"\n\n\n",
