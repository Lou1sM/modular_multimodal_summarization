    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the Buenos Dias, Matthew told his parents that he was going to go to Buchanan Enterprises later. Bo asked Matthew if he should work on his paper instead, but Matthew knew that Bo didn't like Matthew working for Clint. Suddenly, Matthew spilled some of his food and excused himself to get cleaned up. Nora said that, as long as Matthew's schoolwork wasn't suffering, she didn't see a problem. However, Bo thought Matthew should spend more time with his friends.\n\n\nIn front of the Buenos Dias, Rex told Charlie and Echo that he wasn't sure if he could stay. Echo assured him that it wouldn't be a long lunch, and she just wanted to spend a few minutes with him and Charlie. The three entered the diner and immediately encountered Bo and Nora. Bo asked if the DNA results were back yet. Rex gestured to Echo and Charlie and said, \"Meet the parents.\" Bo asked if it felt good to have the truth, and Charlie replied that he hoped Echo forgave him and Rex for their doubts about her.\n\n\nHaving a moment alone, Bo asked Rex if he was all right with everything. Rex said that things were still processing, and asked Bo if Echo was as bad as everyone kept saying. Bo had a flashback from years before, when he had yelled at Echo about how much suffering she had caused. He told Rex that maybe Echo had changed more than everyone thought, and that Charlie was a good guy to be Rex's father.\n\n\nMatthew eavesdropped as Bo asked Rex why he had been unhappy with Clint lately. Rex thought about Matthew catching him in Clint's office at B.E. and said that he and Clint \"rub each other the wrong way.\" Rex and Clint were both happy that Clint had turned out to not be Rex's father.\n\n\nClint asked what  Vimal had done with the DNA test of Clint's daughter. Vimal said that that Clint was right -- \"the wrong man\" was the father of Clint's daughter's baby. Walking out of the office, he said that he had used the same process to change the result of Rex's DNA test. Clint asked how he had handled the doctor, Marty, that caught him in the DNA lab. Vimal said he had acted like he worked there and the doctor didn't ask him any questions. He told Clint that the father of his daughter's baby was, according to the tests, Brody Lovett.\n\n\nBrody entered and asked why he had just heard his name. Clint explained that he was bragging to Vimal about his soon-to-be son-in-law because he was happy about Brody and Jess. Brody said that Clint would be thrilled with the news he was about to bring his soon-to-be father-in-law about the baby. Vimal awkwardly congratulated Brody and began to walk away, dropping the hospital key card in the process. He picked it up before Brody could see it, and left.\n\n\nIn Clint's office, Brody told Clint that Jessica's baby was Brody's. Clint was very happy and told Brody that he was like a son to him, \"something that gold-digging Rex Balsom will never be.\"\n\n\nEcho told Rex that she couldn't wait to meet Gigi and Shane. Rex said that there was a lot he had to explain to Shane before that happened. As the waitress delivered the check, Echo handed her a credit card. After a couple minutes, the waitress returned the card, saying it had been declined. Charlie ended up paying with cash, much to Echo's embarrassment.\n\n\nJohn answered a knock on his door to Roxy, who had a pile of clean towels. She entered John's room and asked about the baby. \"Perfect,\" he said. John and Roxy both had a bottle of beer and toasted to John and Natalie's baby. Roxy asked John if he had plans to propose to Natalie, but John said he and Natalie were taking things one step at a time.\n\n\nRoxy told John that she took some credit for him and Natalie being back together because she was the one who had told Natalie to write the letter to John. She also gave Brody some credit because, if Natalie hadn't stopped to say goodbye to Brody on her way to the airport, John might not have gotten there in time to stop her from leaving. \"Here's to Brody!\" Roxy toasted.\n\n\nJohn explained to Roxy that everything was all right with Marty. She had accepted that John and Natalie were together, and wished them well. \"For being such a smart guy, you sure are a dummy about women,\" Roxy replied. She said that Marty was used to having everything, and at that moment, she didn't have anything. Before leaving, she warned John that, next time Marty had a dirty trick up her sleeve, she wouldn't \"wimp out,\" and John would have to pay for it.\n\n\nVimal entered the diner and stared Matthew down, and Matthew stared right back. He thought back to Clint asking Vimal about the hospital key card. Matthew got up and asked Vimal about the key card. Vimal said that he had made it for Clint, and that if Matthew was smart, he'd forget all about it.\n\n\nNatalie looked at her paternity test results and got upset. Gigi entered and asked Natalie if Viki needed any help with Thanksgiving preparations. She noticed that Natalie looked upset and asked why. Natalie revealed that she had received her amniocentesis results, and she was happy to report that John was the father. Gigi said that Natalie should be happy, so she wondered why Natalie was crying. Natalie claimed that the long wait for the results had made her emotional. Gigi asked to see the paper with the results, but Natalie refused.\n\n\nGigi said that Natalie could tell her anything. Natalie handed Gigi the paper and admitted to lying about John being her baby's father. She told Gigi about running into John at the hospital and not letting him see the papers. She also admitted to lying to Brody. She said that no one could live with the secret because it would upset so many people. Then Gigi asked if Natalie could live with it. Gigi suggested that the truth might be easier, and asked if Natalie was sure that John couldn't handle it.\n\n\nGigi went on to rationalize Natalie's decision to sleep with Brody, but Natalie knew John would feel betrayed and would leave her. Gigi promised to back Natalie up no matter what she decided. She promised to keep Natalie's secret until the day she died. They shook on it when Brody entered, wanting to know what was going on.\n\n\nNatalie lied that she had told Gigi about Brody and Jessica's child. Gigi left as Brody again told Natalie how happy he was that her baby was John's. He left, and Natalie looked at the results paper. She threw it into the lit fireplace. As she watched it burn, her phone rang. She answered it to John, who wanted to see her.\n\n\nViki visited Dorian at La Boulaie to tell her of Rex's paternity results. Dorian didn't believe Viki and asked about the half-heart necklace. Viki informed Dorian that Clint had reasonable explanations for everything, but Dorian said that something being reasonable didn't make it legitimate. Dorian asked where the new family was, and Viki told her that they were at lunch. They had invited her, but she had declined. Dorian told her declining the invitation was a mistake.\n\n\nViki vowed that she wouldn't be jealous because no one was going to separate her and Charlie. Dorian imagined that, when Rex wasn't thrilled about his birth parents' identities, Echo would surely cry on Charlie's shoulder. Dorian related that, if she didn't find out Clint's secret soon, Echo would destroy Viki's home next. Dorian vowed to find out Echo's secret by becoming her new best friend and regaining her trust. Then, Echo would tell her everything. Viki trusted Charlie to \"set Echo straight.\" Dorian was just trying to help, but Viki did not want her help.\n\n\nRoxy entered the diner as Rex, Echo, and Charlie were leaving. Roxy asked what the connection between the three of them was. Rex broke the news to her about his newfound birth parents and led her outside. He explained that Rick and Lily were just a scam. He promised Roxy that nothing was going to change between the two of them. Very upset, Roxy ran back into the diner.\n\n\nRoxy immediately saw Echo and said that she'd had Roxy fooled while getting information about Rex. Roxy demanded the money for Echo's room, but Echo didn't have it. She thought the photos were enough to cover the money. As Charlie watched, Roxy ordered Echo to pack up and get out of her hotel.\n\n\nAt B.E., a suspicious Matthew asked Clint where he had needed to go for the DNA test. When Clint answered that he had gone to the genetics lab at Llanview Hospital, Matthew had more questions. He asked how accurate the results were and if they could ever be wrong. Clint didn't think so. He related that he had gotten a lucky break because he was a lucky guy.\n\n\nRex reentered the diner and asked Bo how he could ever forgive his parents. Bo said that Charlie was a good guy. Rex didn't think he needed a dad at his age, but Bo related that he'd always need a dad. \"Isn't that what I have you for?\" Rex asked, and left. Nora asked Bo if he was thinking about Asa. Bo said that Asa wasn't an easy man to get along with, but Bo missed him every day.\n\n\nLater, Gigi met Rex at the diner. She asked about the DNA results. Rex informed a surprised Gigi that his parents were Echo and Charlie.\n\n\nNatalie arrived at John's and saw the beer sitting out. John explained to her about Roxy's toast, and that Roxy had warned John about Marty and her \"dirty tricks.\" John reassured a worried Natalie that Marty regretted how she had treated John and Natalie, and that she was trying to let it go. \"I hope so,\" said Natalie.\n\n\nBrody went into the living room of Llanfair to get something out of a drawer. On his way out of the room, he poked at the blazing fire.\n\n\nDorian called Roxy at the hotel and asked to speak to Echo. Roxy told Dorian that Echo no longer lived there.\n\n\nCharlie returned to Llanfair and Viki asked how the \"family reunion\" had been. Charlie knew that there had been a lot of tension since Echo had arrived in town, but he was happy that Rex was his son. Viki agreed, but related that Echo was probably happy about Charlie being Rex's father as well. Charlie promised that Echo wouldn't threaten their relationship. Just then, the doorbell rang, and Charlie answered it to Echo with suitcases in tow. She told Charlie she was homeless and had nowhere else to go.\n\n\nMarty looked at a copy of Natalie's DNA test results and said that she would never feel sorry for Natalie. Talking to a picture of Cole, she wondered how John would \"take the news.\" He would have to get the news first, and Natalie was lying to John, so Marty said it was up to her. It was time for John to get a \"very special gift.\"\n\n\nMarty took out gift-wrapping supplies and imagined giving John the gift. In her daydream, Marty smiled as John opened the gift with Natalie and took out the results of Natalie's test. A very upset John asked Natalie how she could had done that to him and to her own sister. He called her a liar and kicked her out of his apartment, never wanting to see her or \"the kid\" ever again. He thanked Marty for telling him before it was too late as Natalie tried to explain. He slammed the door in her face.\n\n\nMarty finished wrapping the box and admired her handiwork. \"Christmas comes early this year!\" she said happily as she ran out of her house. Later, Marty arrived in front of John's place. Just as she was about to knock on the door, her phone rang. The person on the other end told her that her son had been involved in a fight. She said she would be right there and ran out.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Clint's contact, Vimal, returns to Clint and confirms that he did what he asked and altered the DNA to appear as though Charlie and not Clint is Rex Balsam's father. He also successfully \"fixed\" the paternity test of \"Clint's daughter\" (although he does not say which daughter). He informs Clint that he found out \"the other guy\" (although he does not say which \"other guy\") is the father of Clint's daughter's baby. But he \"fixed\" it so that Brody Lovett appears to be the father. Brody and Jessica are happily rejoicing the news that he's her baby's father. Natalie is similarly not ok with the results naming Brody and not John as her baby's father. We still don't know which is an accurate DNA test and which was altered by Vimal. Natalie confides in Gigi but does not want anyone else to know about the test results that name Brody as her baby's father. She is afraid it will ruin Brody's, Jessica's and John's lives. She's also afraid that John will leave her. Marty is alone and ready to surprise John and Natalie with a \"special Christmas gift\". She wraps a package for them and plans to bring it to them as their \"first baby gift\". When John opens it, he will see the papers that reveal that Natalie is a liar and a coward, and he throws her and the baby out of her home. Marty goes to John's home with her \"gift-wrapped present\" and is ready to knock on John's door, when she gets a call from the prison that informs her that Cole has been assaulted. And at that point, she puts aside her \"plans\" and rushes to be there for her son. Meanwhile, Dorian warns Viki that Echo wants to take Charlie from her. Roxy finds out that Echo is Rex's bio mom and has lied to Rex and scammed her into believing they were friends only so she could get information about Rex. She throws Echo out of her hotel. Dorian warns Viki that Echo will want to cry on Charlie's shoulder about the problems involving \"their son\". Viki tells Dorian she is not going to worry. When Echo has no place to go and no money, she rushes to Charlie. Matthew suspects that his uncle is up to something secretive and suspicious involving the paternity test of Rex Balsam. He overhears Clint, Bo, and Nora discussing it and remembers Vimal taking Clint's key card to the Llanview Hospital genetics lab. Matthew is ready to put two and two together about his uncle's scam involving Rex's DNA test.",
