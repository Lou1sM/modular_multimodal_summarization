Brody insisted on taking responsibility for shooting Rex, and was determined to accept his fate. While Brody continued to blame himself for losing control on that fateful night, Gigi reminded Brody that he had suffered a mental breakdown; she believed it would be unfair for him to be sent to prison. After pleading with Brody to reconsider, Gigi handed him the check that he had given her for Shane's education. After advising Brody to use the check to cover his legal expenses, Gigi begged him to allow her and Rex to help him for Shane's sake. Gigi stated that she wanted Shane to have happy memories of Brody. \n\n\nAt the police station, Rex asked Bo to help him keep Brody from going to prison. As Bo listened intently, Rex maintained that Brody was in need of help and not punishment. \n\n\nDown the hall, Blair asked Nora if the news about John resigning was true. Upon learning that John had actually resigned, Blair was surprised by John's decision to quit. Stating that she supported John's decision to resign after the treatment he received from the department, Nora reminded Blair of the opposition that John received from the mayor in his quest to rescue Marty. Nora related that Todd had influenced the mayor and judge's decisions to prevent John from carrying out his police duties and saving Marty. Citing that the system had failed Marty, Nora understood John's anger against the mayor and the department. Cringing, Nora stated that what Todd had done to Marty and Cole was unforgivable. Shaking her head in disgust, Blair agreed. When Blair indirectly asked if John had visited Marty at the Buchanan Mansion, Nora informed her that she had no idea of John's whereabouts. \n\n\nUpon entering Bo's office, Nora joined in on the discussion between Bo and Rex. After Rex pleaded his case and asked for leniency for Brody, Nora advised him that she had to prosecute Brody because he was facing several other charges. Bo urged Nora to consider offering Brody a plea and allowing Rex to testify on his behalf. Although Nora agreed that a statement from Rex would lighten Brody's sentence, she maintained that he would never be exonerated and would still be sent to prison. Bo reminded Nora of the terrible injustice that Marty had endured and insisted that they come up with a solution to help Brody. \n\n\nAfter pulling a few strings, Nora negotiated a deal that would prevent Brody from going to prison. Nora informed Rex and Bo that if Brody voluntarily committed himself into St. Ann's as a mental patient, he would be a free man after the institution deemed that he was in good mental health. Rex made arrangements to accompany Nora to the VA hospital to present Brody with the deal. With a look of approval, Bo told Rex that he was proud of Rex's decision to help Brody. Rex credited Bo with helping him do the right thing. \n\n\nAs Gigi and Rex looked on, Nora explained the proposition to Brody and offered him the paperwork necessary to commit himself into St. Ann's. Brody insisted that he was guilty, and was adamant about serving time for his crime. After Nora informed Brody that he would be sent to prison for a long time if he refused the deal, Brody accepted the paperwork and thanked Nora and Rex for their help. Afterward, Brody signed the papers and agreed to commit himself into St. Ann's. As Brody walked toward his room, Gigi handed him a letter from Shane. Alone in his room, Brody opened Shane's letter. The letter contained a picture that depicted Brody as a superhero. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, John paid Marty a visit. John listened as Marty told him how Todd had manipulated her into fearing John. John was surprised when Marty revealed that she had dreamt about him often while she was living with Todd. Marty related that she had begun to look forward to her dreams of John and never once feared him in her dreams. As she remembered Todd's lies, Marty blamed herself for being manipulated by him. Marty expressed her inability to be a real mother to Cole and her regret that her only memories consisted of her time with Todd. John did his best to convince Marty that she was an innocent victim and that Todd was solely responsible for the terrible injustice that she had suffered. After remembering that she had confessed her love to Todd and then slept with him, Marty cried and said that she was disgusted with herself. John reached out to comfort her, but Marty pulled away. John vowed to make Todd pay for hurting her. \n\n\nRecalling the picture of her and John that Todd and Ramsey had used to calm her nerves, Marty told John that she had no idea of what Todd had done with the photo. Instantly, John pulled a picture from his wallet. To Marty's surprise, the picture revealed her and John during happier times. Marty apologized for feeling sorry for herself and not thanking John for his help. As she thanked him, Marty caressed John's face. John responded by placing his hand on top of hers. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Cole dropped by to visit Starr. Cole related to Starr that he had tried to jog his mother's memory, but failed. When he blamed himself for placing unnecessary pressure on his mother to remember her past, Starr tried to console him. With great sadness, Cole told Starr that he didn't feel like Marty was his mother. After reminding Cole that he was fortunate to have his mother back in his life, Starr revealed that Todd had planned to run off with Marty and baby Hope. Although outraged by Todd's scheme, Cole sensed Starr's guilt and assured her that she didn't need to apologize for her father. Cole noticed the locket that contained a lock of Hope's hair. When Starr opened the locket, Cole looked sad as he realized that Hope had the same hair color as his mother. As they comforted one another, Starr and Cole promised to never forget baby Hope. \n\n\nMeanwhile, downstairs, Blair returned home and told Dorian that she believed that John was with Marty. When Blair declared that she had decided to give up on her relationship with John, Dorian begged her to reconsider. Dorian suggested that Blair continue to build a relationship with John, and reminded her that Marty had no memory of John-- only of her short time with Todd. Blair was certain that John had the ability to make Marty forget about Todd because he had helped her do the same. \n\n\nLater, Marty sat alone and looked through a photo album. She focused her attention on the picture that John had given her. \n\n\nAlone, a sadden Blair stared out the window and thought about John reuniting with Marty. Seconds later, she opened the door and found John standing there. Without saying a word, the two embraced. \n\n\nAt Antonio's loft, Talia and Antonio made s'mores and shared a special night with Jamie. Later, after Jamie had gone to sleep, Antonio romanced Talia. \n\n\n",
