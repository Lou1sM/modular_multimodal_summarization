    "soap_central": "\n Congratulations, It's a Girl \n\n\n\n\nAt the police station, Bo received a visit from Rex, who revealed that Mitch Laurence was his father. Bo, thinking that it was a bad joke at first, tried to find holes in Rex's disclosure, but Rex assured him that it Roxy had confirmed it. A sullen Rex admitted that the truth explained his life and Roxy's actions in the past. He had hoped his father would turn out to be someone like Bo, Rex finished. Bo assured him that he was nothing like Mitch Laurence and in fact was a good father. Rex praised Bo in return, calling him a good teacher.\n\n\nBo promised that Mitch would not be able to get near Rex and his family, but Rex thought that he might want to see Mitch. Bo quickly shot the idea down, mentioning the fact that Mitch was \"pure evil\" and not Rex's father in any real sense. He thought that Mitch would try to get into Rex's head and go after his family. He thought it possible that Rex could get into Mitch's head as well. It was entirely too dangerous. He wanted Rex's promise that he would not go to see Mitch. He gave Rex a bear hug.\n\n\nOliver told off a fellow police officer who began to speak when Oliver told him that his boyfriend had delivered his dinner. When Oliver finally finished, the officer noted that he had only wanted to tell Oliver that there was soda in the break room. As Kyle stood by chuckling, Oliver apologized. The officer advised Oliver that not everyone was a jerk in their beliefs regarding Oliver's announcement that he was gay. Kyle pointed out that Oliver had referred to him as his boyfriend. He was pleased. The men shared a kiss when no one was looking.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, a panicked Viki ran downstairs to Clint when she discovered that Natalie was missing. He calmly reassured her that Natalie was safely ensconced with John and that Jessica had returned home with Brody. Viki's first thought was to head to John's place to retrieve Natalie but Clint advised her that the press was camped out in front of the house. He added that Viki had won the mayoral election while she had been gone. He congratulated her but she was adamant that she wanted to make a statement to the congregated press.\n\n\nAt the front door, Viki was bombarded with questions from the assembled reporters. Clint quieted them down and Viki proceeded to speak. She informed them that the police had learned that Jared did not kill Pamela or Wayne and that Mitch had been the one to commit all of the murders. Mitch was being held for the deaths. She added that Jessica considered Clint to be her father and that Mitch had no place in their lives. She jokingly reminded everyone of the mayoral election.\n\n\nShe was grateful to be elected and both honored and humbled that she had won, she continued. Even though she had high hopes during the election, she would, regretfully, not be able to serve. Her family had been going through some terrible times and it would be unfair to both them and the public for her to continue. She concluded that the city charter had provisions for a scenario such as the one that had occurred. Clint was sorry that she wouldn't take office. He knew of one person who would be happy.\n\n\nMarkko was still feeling regretful that he had been the one to cost Dorian the mayoral election, while Langston reassured him that thousands of people had cast their votes for Viki. He couldn't have been solely responsible for Dorian's loss, she consoled him.\n\n\nDorian continued on her mission of trying to locate the one person who had sabotaged her election. She ended up at the Buenos D\u00edas caf\u00e9 and put Moe, Noelle and Carlotta into a line. Dorian wanted to know who everyone had voted for and why. She called it her post-election analysis. Carlotta accused her of just looking for someone to place the blame on for losing the election. She urged Dorian to \"live with it\" because it was over and she had lost. She herself had voted for Viki, Carlotta admitted, after seeing how Dorian had run her household. Moe took exception to Dorian's quizzing, noting that it was unconstitutional. Noelle suggested that Dorian count her blessings.\n\n\nA gloomy Gigi sat with Shane at the counter and waited to hear some news from Schuyler. Noelle, noting Gigi's demeanor, had Moe call Shane into the kitchen. Noelle did her best to cheer Gigi up, acknowledging that everyone had bad days like Gigi had when she had been drunk. She wanted to know if Gigi had feelings for Schuyler. Instead of answering, Gigi recapped the night she spent with Schuyler because she had too much to drink. Noelle asked the question again. He was a good friend and a big help to her, she emphasized. He was off talking to Stacy to try to get her to keep her mouth shut about seeing them together, she added. She had planned on telling Rex the truth but he had just learned that Mitch was his father. She would tell him eventually, she swore. Noelle understood that it was a bad time.\n\n\nSchuyler, paying a visit to Kim and Stacy, was stunned to learn that he was the father of Stacy's child. He wanted to know the reason that he should keep quiet. Kim pulled an uncertain Stacy aside when Schuyler received a call from Gigi and assured her that they needed to blame Schuyler for leverage. He wanted Gigi and would most likely do anything to have her, Kim explained. Schuyler told Gigi that he was negotiating with Stacy. He told the women that he had a conscience and would not be able to keep the news to himself. Kim did her best to embellish her plan, pointing out that Schuyler would end up with Gigi if he did what Kim wanted him to do.\n\n\nSchuyler insisted that as the baby's father he had parental rights and wanted to be involved in raising his baby. As Kim continued to press for Schuyler to keep the news secret, he asked if she thought he was stupid.  He asked if he was supposed to keep quiet for their benefit. Suddenly he had a thought. What if the baby looked like him, he wondered. The young women assured him that he and Rex had a resemblance to each other. He wondered about Rex's request for a paternity test after the baby's birth.\n\n\nKim told him not to worry. \"We got that,\" she told him. He advised the women that they had hurt Gigi when they had shoved the sonogram in her face and that was the reason she had become drunk. As Stacy declared her love for Rex yet again, Schuyler reminded her yet again that Rex would never love her. Stacy recognized that Schuyler hated Rex and this was the chance for everyone to get the person they wanted, she pleaded. She would have Rex and he could have Gigi, as long as he remained quiet about the baby's real paternity. Schuyler insisted that while had had lied when he was on drugs, he wasn't that same guy any longer.\n\n\nAs a persistent Stacy and Kim tried their best to get Schuyler to go along with their plan, he asked how he knew for sure that the baby was his. They assured him it was. He had one condition, he countered. He wanted their assurance that they would not tell Rex about the night that Gigi stayed with him, even if it would help their cause. He admitted to feeling dirty.\n\n\nIn Seattle, Danielle heard Todd announce that he was her father but she ignored him, announcing that she had a dad and they were leaving together. T\u00e9a wanted to tell Danielle the truth and tried to stop her daughter. Danielle refused to listen when T\u00e9a showed off her bruised neck and emphasized how violent Ross was. Danielle was certain that it was Todd who had caused the bruising, not Ross.\n\n\nRoss took Danielle's misunderstanding and ran with it, explaining that he had saved T\u00e9a from Todd. He reminded her of how fatherly he had been during her childhood and how he had looked after her. T\u00e9a drew Danielle's attention to Ross's face, pointing out that she had scratched him when he had tried to strangle her.\n\n\nDanielle began to back away from Ross when she finally realized that T\u00e9a was speaking some truth. Uncomfortably, she looked at his hands on her shoulders and removed them. A flustered Ross started to make excuses for his actions, stressing that he was desperate to keep his daughter and merely wanted to make a point. Danielle grabbed her phone and called the police. Ross apologized for losing control but assured his daughter he would never hurt her.\n\n\nWhen the local police officers arrived, Danielle told them that her mother was trying to kidnap her with Todd. Todd pointed out the bruises on T\u00e9a's neck that were there as a result of Ross attempting to strangle her. The policemen advised all of the adults that they would be needed at the police station for further questioning. They would have to put Danielle into protective custody. As T\u00e9a voiced her opposition the officers placed Ross in handcuffs. \"She is mine, right?\" Todd asked T\u00e9a. She pulled the DNA results from her pocket and handed them to him. \"Congratulations, it's a girl,\" she responded. The officers returned and put Todd into handcuffs next. Danielle was unsuccessful in stopping them from taking her father.\n\n\nDorian returned to La Boulaie in a huff and Markko tried to confess his sin. Langston managed to jump in and interrupt before Markko was able to speak up. Dorian admitted that she felt as though she had let people down by losing and wouldn't be able to fulfill her campaign promises. Markko tried again and this time he managed to tell Dorian the truth; that he had voted for Viki instead of her. It was his fault that she lost, he said somberly.\n\n\nAs an angry Dorian began to blame Markko for her loss, Langston jumped up to aid him, noting that he wasn't the only person to have voted for Viki. She reminded Dorian that the person she loved was in London and she should focus on her personal life. Perhaps the fact that she had lost the election by one vote was a sign. Amelia walked into the kitchen and agreed with Langston. She thought that Dorian should follow her heart and be free to love who she chose, just like she preached. Dorian was loathe to abandon their cause but Amelia promised that they would keep on fighting. She knew that Dorian loved David.\n\n\nDorian extended her apologies to Markko, admitting that she had been looking for someone to blame. She adored both David and London and decided that she would pack. As she headed for the door, Amelia received a phone call and told Dorian to wait. Dorian was shocked to hear that Viki had vacated her office and would not serve. \"It's not over,\" Amelia advised her.\n\n\nAs Gigi waited for Schuyler's call, Rex arrived at the caf\u00e9. She directed him to the kitchen to see Shane. \"Mission accomplished,\" Schuyler told her when he called. Wondering what it cost him, Gigi was relieved to hear Schuyler assure her that she was safe. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian is determined to find out who voted against her when Viki beat her by only 1 vote in the election. When Markko admits that he voted for Viki, at first she is furious. But Langston and Markko convince her to forget about the election and to be with David in London. Meanwhile, Viki announces that she cannot serve as mayor because of all she has going on with her family, regarding the death of Jared and Mitch Laurence and all. Rex talks to Bo about finding out that Mitch is his bio dad. Stacy and Kim persuade Schuyler not to tell Gigi that he might be the father of Stacy's baby, realizing that it could ruin his \"chances\" with Gigi. Gigi admits to Noelle that she may have feelings for Schuyler.",
