Neville was disappointed that they weren't having dinner at home because Nigel had told Neville all about Thanksgiving. It was a time for peace, harmony, forgiveness, and love. Neville also informed Kevin and Kelly that Joey had called, and was on his way home.\n\n\nKelly was glad that Joey hadn't heard her messages and decided that she needed to change her clothes. She confessed to Kevin that she had never really gotten over Joey. A disappointed-looking Kevin wasn't surprised and related that a person never really got over their first love. Neville announced that dinner was ready, but Kelly said that they should wait for Joey. Neville apologized for not being clear. Joey wasn't going to London; he was going to Llanview.\n\n\nJames and Ford entered their apartment after the town-wide marathon for charity. Eddie entered and asked where his money was, and where his sons were taking him for Thanksgiving dinner. Later, James made sure that it was all right for him to be at the Cramers' for dinner. Ford said it was fine as Eddie asked if he was invited too. Ford told Eddie that he was staying at the apartment. As the two left, James suggested that Eddie go to the diner. \"By myself?\" Eddie asked the empty apartment, then stated, \"Unacceptable.\" He followed his sons out the door.\n\n\nNatalie was decorating as Brody entered Llanfair, out of breath from the marathon. He asked Natalie why she was upset because she should be thrilled that John was the father of Natalie's baby. He decided that he knew why she wasn't happy and left to check on Jess and Bree, both of whom had colds.\n\n\nLater, Natalie was on the phone with John and told him to say hello to Michael and Marcie for her. Brody entered as Natalie hung up, and she told him that John had said hello. Natalie explained that she had just been tired earlier, but Brody knew that she felt guilty because he did as well. As Natalie thought about the results of her test, Brody said that it was like their one-night stand never happened.\n\n\nCristian took Blair wine and a bouquet of flowers that were originally meant for Layla. He thanked Blair for inviting him to dinner because otherwise, he would've been all alone. He also gave her Eli's box. Blair was angry that Cristian didn't throw the box out like she had asked, but Cristian thought that Blair needed to deal with it.\n\n\nViki opened the front door of Llanfair to Dorian, who told her they'd won. She informed Viki that Roxy had kicked Echo out for not paying for her room. Dorian thought that they'd seen the last of Echo. Just then, Echo entered in a bathrobe, asking when dinner was. She said she was going to \"pretty up\" and went up the stairs. Viki told a shocked Dorian that she was angry that Echo was there. Dorian was sure she could help.\n\n\nDorian had a strong hunch that there was something going on with Clint and Echo. As Dorian said she needed to find out about Rex, Rex entered with Gigi and Shane. \"What about me?\" he asked. Dorian wished everyone a happy Thanksgiving and left. Shane told Viki that he was happy to have Charlie as his grandfather. Viki agreed as Echo appeared at the top of the stairs. Viki introduced Echo to Gigi and Shane and told them she was staying with Viki and Charlie for a couple days.\n\n\nStarr was on the phone as she entered La Boulaie. When Langston entered, Starr asked her why James wanted to know what to bring for Thanksgiving dinner. Langston informed Starr that she had invited Ford, and Ford wanted to take James along. Langston assured an angry Starr that James knew that he and Starr were just friends. \"Unless you're still into him,\" Langston added.\n\n\nStarr denied it, and related that he had only been making her feel better when he was over a couple nights before. Langston said that Cole was in jail, but Starr couldn't stop living. Starr thought that Marty would want to see Hope for Thanksgiving, so she was going to leave. Starr stopped and asked Langston when she and Ford had become close enough for him to be at a family dinner. Langston caught Starr up to speed on how they were just getting to know each other, and how Langston had gotten Ford to agree to no sex for six months.\n\n\nStarr didn't think six months was bad, since she'd have to wait ten years to be with Cole again. As Langston wondered if Starr had been listening, there was a knock on the door. Starr told Langston to get the door because Starr was going to Marty's. Langston opened the door to James and Ford. \"One hundred seventy-nine days left,\" Ford announced, and kissed Langston. Starr tried to hurry up the stairs unnoticed, but James stopped her.\n\n\nStarr told James she needed space. Blair entered and asked what Ford was doing there. Langston said that they were dating and they'd both changed. Just then, Dorian entered, followed by Eddie, who had told her that he'd been invited. Ford told Eddie he had to go. \"This is your father?\" Dorian asked. Starr summarized all the harm the man had caused to his boys. Eddie asked what Starr knew about raising kids, to which Blair replied that Starr had a daughter.\n\n\nFord asked whether Eddie was going to leave, or if they had to throw him out. James tried to push Eddie out, but Eddie returned with a punch to James's face. Ford attacked Eddie and pinned him against a wall. Cristian and Ford each had one of Eddie's arms while Dorian called the police.\n\n\nInez and Nate arrived at Clint's. Nigel led Nate into the adjacent room to play on the Z-Box. Clint had hoped Inez would wear the necklace Clint had given her, but she told him it was too extravagant for her to accept. Bo, Nora, and Matthew entered. Matthew saw Inez and hoped Nate wasn't there. Inez wanted to warm up the tart she had made, so Bo took her to the kitchen.\n\n\nClint hoped that everyone could be nice to his guests. Matthew asked if it had been necessary to invite Nate. Quoting Asa, Clint said that one had to keep their friends close and their enemies closer. Matthew left to play on the Z-Box and Clint told Nora that she should take a page out of Asa's book as well. Clint asked her if she was worried about Bo and Inez.\n\n\nNora said there was nothing going on. Clint said he was relieved and told her about the jewelry he had given Inez. He didn't think the reason was right. He said he didn't want history to repeat itself with a woman leaving him for his brother. Bo and Inez entered laughing and joking, not thrilling Clint or Nora.\n\n\nIn the adjacent room, Nate and Nigel played each other on the Z-Box. Matthew entered and wasn't happy to see it. He told Nigel to get him some nachos and then took the controller from him. Nigel asked \"Mr. Salinger\" if he wanted something, as well, but Nate didn't and told Nigel to call him Nate. Nigel left and Nate chastised Matthew for treating Nigel like a slave. Matthew told Nate not to change things for Nigel. They started to argue and Nate grabbed Matthew as the adults rushed into the room.\n\n\nInez scolded her son, but Clint assured her that \"boys will be boys.\" Nate was tired of Matthew setting him up to look like a \"jerk.\" Nate told Inez that he had turned Dani's invitation down in order to spend Thanksgiving with his mother, but he couldn't stay. He left, and Bo asked if Inez wanted him to speak with Nate. Inez said Nate should be with Dani anyway.\n\n\nDani was happy to open her front door to Destiny, and asked her to stay for dinner. Destiny said she would, but she also wanted to talk to T\u00e9a about divorcing Destiny from her parents. Dani said she would talk to her mother about taking the case, but urged Destiny to give it some time and think about it. There was a knock on the door, and Dani was happy to find Nate on the other side.\n\n\nNatalie told Rex that Charlie was a great guy, even though it would have been great if they were really related. Rex didn't know how to feel about his newfound parents. He was glad that Natalie's baby knew its parents because it made life easier for everyone.\n\n\nBo left to answer his ringing phone. Clint told Matthew that he had driven Nate right into Dani's arms. Matthew wondered how to keep his enemies close. Clint looked at Nora and said that there were many ways, and he'd be happy to teach Matthew. \"Not by example,\" Matthew said. He cited the fact that Clint hated Rex and kept him as far away as possible.\n\n\nShane told Brody that he was going to make a great dad. Shane said that, since Charlie was Shane's grandfather and Brody was marrying Jessica, they would be \"kind of related.\" Brody's phone rang, and it was Bo.\n\n\nBo returned and said he'd be back soon because somebody had violently crashed the mayor's Thanksgiving dinner. He told Inez that the man was her ex, but that it would earn him a one-way ticket out of town. Clint talked to Nora about his paranoia: ever since Nora left him, he hasn't trusted anyone. Nora assured him that Inez didn't a have crush on Bo, because she had asked Inez. Clint asked if Nora believed her. Then, Inez announced that Bo had texted her that he had arrived at La Boulaie.\n\n\nEcho told Gigi that Rex had talked a lot about her. She recognized Gigi as a waitress from Rodi's, and was surprised to learn that Gigi was in school. Gigi explained that having a child in high school delayed education. Echo clarified that Gigi had never told Rex about Shane. \"Just like you never told Charlie?\" Gigi replied.\n\n\nCharlie told Viki about how Echo's credit card had been declined at lunch the previous day. Viki wondered why it was their problem. Charlie said that they had room in Llanfair. Viki was surprised at Charlie's suggestion that Echo move in.\n\n\nDorian demanded that Bo arrest Eddie for trespassing, and for punching his son. Brody handcuffed Eddie. Eddie vowed that James would pay for him getting arrested, in addition to what James already owed him. As Bo and Brody led Eddie out the front, James walked outside through the side door. Starr left to talk to him. Ford told Langston that he would never forgive himself for leaving James with Eddie. Dorian assured Ford that she still didn't like him, but regretted that he had been forced to go through what he had with Eddie.\n\n\nStarr asked James why he hadn't told Bo what his father had done to him. James said that his father had all the power and would never let him go. He related that he was useless, and that his father had called him useless when he was younger. He said he had been stupid to think stealing his father's money and running would get him away from Eddie. Starr promised him that he wasn't useless and he wasn't alone because he had his family and Starr as well. They hugged and went back inside the house.\n\n\nCristian told Blair that he would throw Eli's box away if she wanted him to. Blair decided to keep it. Dorian began her Thanksgiving toast. She was thankful for the Native Americans teaching the pilgrims to reach out to one another and showing them how to provide for each other. \"Who's hungry?\" she asked excitedly.\n\n\nBo returned and Clint began his toast. He said that it had been a tough year, but they had gotten through it. Nigel announced that dinner was ready. Inez said that she should check on her sons, but Clint stopped her and asked for the real reason why she couldn't accept the necklace. She said it made her feel like he wanted to take the relationship to the next level, and she wasn't ready to sleep with him. She was relieved to hear him say that he didn't want to sleep with her. However, he wanted her to sleep with Bo.\n\n\nBrody returned, and Viki began her toast. She was thankful for all of her family members and said that she always had room for those who had nowhere else to go. Later, Viki stood in the living room alone, looking outside. Someone came in the front door and said, \"Happy Thanksgiving, mom!\" Viki was very happy to see Joey standing in front of her.\n\n\nT\u00e9a held a piece of paper out to Todd and asked him to explain it. He asked where she had gotten it, and she revealed that the court had thought she would be interested in her husband's activities. T\u00e9a asked if Starr had knowingly signed the paper that barred Marty from seeing Hope. When he didn't answer, T\u00e9a threatened to call Starr and ask for herself. Todd confessed that Starr had thought she was signing a paper about Hope's trust fund.\n\n\nT\u00e9a angrily told Todd he was a liar and a cheat. She compared his actions to what Eli had done when he helped give Ross custody of Dani. She asked if he really thought Marty was a threat to Hope. Todd rehashed Marty's defense of Hannah, who had ended up almost killing Starr and Hope. T\u00e9a warned Todd that he was going to drive Starr and Hope out of their lives, and Dani would be next. As the kids entered the room, Todd said that he just wished \"that idiot Nate\" was out of Dani's life.\n\n\nDani asked if he was going to make her and Nate's lives miserable like he had done for Starr and Cole. Destiny told them that Darren's mother was a good cook and that they could all go over there instead. T\u00e9a told Todd to apologize, or she would call Starr and tell her what Todd was up to. Todd apologized for being a possessive father. \"And an insensitive jackass,\" Dani added.\n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd not to make her regret returning from the dead and insisted he apologize to Nate. He apologized and told Nate not to take everything he said so seriously. Nate said he would remember that and accepted the apology, as did Dani. Before eating, T\u00e9a told everyone to hold hands. She spoke in Spanish and then said that she was so grateful to be there that she had to say it in two languages. She had never thought she would see another Thanksgiving and was very happy to be there with everyone.\n\n\n",
