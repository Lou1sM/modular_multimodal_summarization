Sarah was not in a celebratory mood because she was upset about Cris's living arrangements with Vanessa. Sarah suspected that her rival had an agenda when it came to Cris. Layla was sympathetic and tried to be supportive. When Sarah announced that Cris had invited Vanessa and Lola to join them for Thanksgiving dinner, Layla promised to keep Cris busy in the kitchen. They were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was Tina. After Sarah introduced her mother to her roommate, Layla excused herself. Tina told Sarah that she had decided to leave town. Sarah was upset and demanded to know what had prompted the sudden move. Tina was evasive. All she would say was that Sarah that she would learn the truth soon enough and be grateful that Tina had left. Sarah's anger turned to heartbreak when her mother gave her one of David Vickers' puppies. Tina also confided that the good that Sarah saw in Tina was a result of Sarah's influence on her mother's life. Sarah wanted to know where Tina intended to go, but Tina didn't know. She only knew that she had to go on her journey without Cord or Cain. \n\n\nAfter Tina left, Layla returned to the living room and offered her friend a shoulder to cry on. Layla suggested that Sarah pick up some puppy food for their new houseguest and, while she was out, visit Cris. Layla thought Cris would be able to help Sarah deal with the disappointment of her mother's departure better than she could. \n\n\nVanessa went downstairs, wearing nothing but a negligee, and found Cris making his temporary bed. She smiled brightly and wished Cris a happy Thanksgiving. After he returned the greeting, she asked him how he had slept. As Cris busied himself picking up the living room, he jokingly said that he'd had a nightmare about his mother. Vanessa began apologizing for taking over his bedroom, but Cris said that he was fine with it. Vanessa turned the topic to Sarah when she asked Cris how his girlfriend felt about his houseguests. Before Cris could answer her, Lola walked downstairs and wished them both a happy Thanksgiving. Cris smiled and invited Vanessa and Lola to join him at Sarah's for Thanksgiving dinner. They readily accepted. However, the plans changed when Langston invited Lola to spend Thanksgiving with her at LaBoulaie. Vanessa gave Lola permission to go and, before long, Lola had left the loft. \n\n\nAfter Lola's departure, Nora stopped by to talk to Vanessa. She seemed a bit surprised to find Vanessa standing in Cris's living room wearing a nightie, but didn't comment on the woman's attire. Nora had news for Vanessa. She told her that the charges against Vanessa had been dropped so that the U.S. government could deport her to Colombia, where she would face other criminal charges. After Nora left, Vanessa began sobbing. She insisted that she couldn't return to Colombia. Cris tried to comfort Vanessa by telling her that he would find a way to help her. When that failed to ease Vanessa's concern, Cris reached for her and pulled her into his arms to offer her a hug. Sarah walked in moments later and stopped short when she saw Vanessa, scantily clad, in Cris's arms. Vanessa looked up and saw Sarah, but didn't step out of Cris's embrace. \n\n\nNora accompanied Brody to St. Anne's, where he was committed for psychiatric counseling. As Brody settled in, he received visitors. Wes, Rex, and Gigi wanted to spend time with Brody before access to him was restricted. Nora explained what Brody would face in the coming months and then excused herself. When Rex and Brody were left alone in the visitor's lounge, the two men talked about friendship. Brody admitted to Rex that he would be proud to serve alongside Rex. Rex was flattered, and surprised Brody with the news that Shane had accompanied them to St. Anne's. Brody was shocked when he turned around and saw Shane standing in the doorway with Gigi. Brody worried that he had put Shane through too much, but Rex and Gigi didn't agree. They felt that Shane needed the visit as much as Brody did. \n\n\nBrody and Shane sat down to play a game of chess while Gigi and Rex stood nearby watching for a few minutes. Shane was eager to share the details of his Thanksgiving play with Brody. While the two laughed and talked about it, Brody relaxed. The moment was ruined when Brody leaned across the table to tousle Shane's hair. As he looked up, Brody saw an image of the boy whom he had killed. He was standing just behind Shane. Brody tensed up and sat back. Shane appeared to notice the change in Brody, but didn't realize the reason for it. While Shane repeatedly called out to Brody, Wes walked into the room. He picked up on the change in Brody immediately and distracted Shane by talking about Brody's act of heroics during the war. Wes then suggested that Shane find his mother. As soon as Shane was out of hearing range, Wes turned to his friend and talked to him about the flashback. Brody admitted that he needed help, but he was a concerned that he might be beyond help. Wes assured his friend that the therapy would work. Later, before everyone left, Shane called out to Brody and saluted him. \n\n\nViki, Clint, and Natalie visited Jessica in the hospital before she was discharged and transferred to St. Anne's. Jessica wanted to sign her own commitment papers, but she had been strapped to a chair and did not have use of her hands. Viki decided to loosen the restraints so that Jessica could sign the papers. Jessica was anxious that Tess might act up, but Viki assured her that her family could handle Tess. After Jessica signed the papers, she went into the bathroom and changed out of her hospital gown and into street clothes. When she rejoined her family, Viki advised Jessica to say goodbye to her daughters before she left for St. Anne. \n\n\nJessica had a touching reunion with her children. She cried and spoke from her heart, promising Bree that she would get better and return home soon. After she handed Bree over to a nurse, Jessica held her infant. As the family gathered together and gushed over whom the baby resembled, Jessica announced that she had chosen a name for her new daughter. Jessica decided to name her Chloe. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the hallway, Tina walked to Jessica's room and stopped outside the window. She took in the touching family scene and turned away, clearly upset. After she left the hospital, Tina made her way to Victor Lord's crypt. Inside, David Vickers, Tina's pooch, was waiting. Tina turned to look at Victor's tomb. She told her father that she hoped he was cold where he was because he deserved it for the way he had hurt Viki. Tina went on to tell him that no one could hurt Viki more than he had. Tina swore that she would not end up like Victor, sad and lonely. Tina pointed to the heaven and vowed, \"As God is my witness, I'm going to change.\" Tina gathered David Vickers and prepared to leave. Before she stepped out of the crypt, Tina reminisced about her brief time in Llanview with Sarah. She then said goodbye to the town, but promised to return. \n\n\nWith her family accompanying her, Jessica checked into St. Anne's. \n\n\nToday's episode featured the song \"I've Never Been To Me\" by Charlene.\n\n\n",
