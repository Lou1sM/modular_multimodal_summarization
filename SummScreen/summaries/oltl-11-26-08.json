    "soap_central": "\nOne Flew Over the Turkey's Nest\n\n\nIn Blair's bedroom at La Boulaie, John and Blair played cards and talked. John explained why he had decided to leave the police force. He said that he became disillusioned with the law and he needed to leave on his own terms. John felt that too many people had put their own agenda ahead of the victims. Blair understood that John referred to Marty's situation and his frustration over the roadblocks that he had faced. Later, John told Blair that he had reached out to her because he had needed her. Blair was happy that he had called her and she shared some of what she had learned from life-hold on tight to what was important. She gave him a soft kiss on the cheek and wished John a happy Thanksgiving before he left. \n\n\nSarah was stunned when she found a barely dressed Vanessa in Cris's arms. Vanessa didn't seem overly concerned about Sarah's obvious ire. Meanwhile, Cris appeared completely oblivious to Sarah's scorn. Instead, he innocently explained why Vanessa was troubled. Sarah failed to understand why Vanessa was upset about not facing attempted murder charges and having to return to her home country. Vanessa bristled and said that she was afraid that Ray would come after her and Lola. Sarah didn't see how that was possible since he was locked up in jail. When Sarah wondered if Vanessa had another reason for wanting to remain in Llanview, Vanessa made herself scarce and went to change. \n\n\nIt finally dawned on Cris that Sarah was annoyed and the reason was Vanessa. He unwisely accused Sarah of being jealous, which she immediately denied. She said she was angry, and accused Cris and Vanessa of living in an R-rated dream world. Sarah went on to tell Cris that since their return from Colombia, she had spent precious little time with Cris. Sarah resented that the reason was Vanessa. Cris explained that he was merely returning the favor and helping Vanessa out of a difficult situation. Sarah pointed out that Vanessa hadn't done anything heroic for Cris; she had just bribed a guard to help him escape. \n\n\nCris switched tactics and reminded Sarah that he had once helped her out when she had problems with Hunter. It was the wrong comparison to make. Sarah quickly reminded Cris that they had ended up involved because of the incident. She also told Cris that she might not be a half naked woman under siege from Immigration but she did have problems, too. Cris realized that Sarah was troubled about something other than Vanessa and tried to talk to her about it, but it was too late. Sarah told him about Tina's decision to leave town and then suggested he save his sympathy for his nightie-wearing houseguest. To drive home her point, Sarah stormed out of the apartment. \n\n\nRex accompanied Gigi and Shane back to their place. Shane was sullen and turned down Rex's offer to toss the football in the yard. After Shane went to his room, Charlie stopped by, looking for Viki. When he learned that neither Gigi nor Rex had seen Viki, he chatted for a few minutes, and left. Rex picked up on a secret that they were keeping, but Gigi refused to elaborate. She wanted to focus on Rex and Shane's relationship. Rex admitted that he felt as if he didn't measure up compared to Brody. Rex could see that Shane worshipped Brody and viewed him as a hero. Gigi grew annoyed and pointed out that Brody had plenty of faults. She also reminded Rex that Brody wasn't Shane's father. She was certain that in time, Rex and Shane would build a father/son relationship. To jump-start them, Gigi devised a plan. She invited Shane downstairs to watch the Thanksgiving Day Parade on television. Shane grumbled at the idea until Rex announced that he was headed to the Buchanans' for dinner, football on television, and games. Shane begged Gigi to let him go, but she reminded him that it was up to Rex to invite him. Shane turned to Rex and asked him if he could go with him. When Rex agreed to take him, Shane smiled. He quickly snatched up his football before he raced out the door. Rex followed closely behind his son with a broad smile on his face. \n\n\nBrody had difficulty settling in at St. Anne's. Luckily, Jessica came to Brody's rescue and intervened on his behalf with a fellow patient. Brody thanked her, but Jessica didn't seem interested in his gratitude. She explained that he was in a mental institution and needed to keep that in mind when he dealt with the residents of St. Anne's. Brody seemed surprised that Jessica was a patient. Jessica bristled and told him that appearances were deceiving; she was as loony as they came. Jessica immediately regretted her harsh words, and apologized. She explained that she was touchy, then changed the subject and asked Brody why he was at the sanitarium. Brody told her about his PTSD and breakdown. When Jessica showed little reaction, he asked her why she had been admitted. Jessica told him all the ugly details of Tess's recent exploits. Brody was taken aback, clearly shocked. \n\n\nAs Brody walked away, Jessica followed him. She told him that she hadn't meant to scare him. Her intention had been to illustrate that the patients at St. Anne's had serious issues. Brody acknowledged that he was not the most damaged patient at the facility and the two began talking about their upcoming therapy sessions. Later, the patients sat down for a Thanksgiving dinner. Brody was asked to say grace. He stumbled briefly, but then spoke from his heart about his hopes for healing. \n\n\nViki went to Victor's mausoleum with a crowbar. She was furious and intent on destroying every inch of her father's crypt. The things she had done that had contributed to Jessica's mental illness tormented her. More than that, though, Viki was filled with rage over the abuse that Victor had inflicted on her and his other children. As Viki roared with anger and wept with sorrow, she began ripping the plaque from his tomb. As she yelled out what an evil bastard Victor had been, a noise alerted her that she was not alone. To Viki's horror, Charlie stood in the doorway. Rather than leave, he stepped into the mausoleum and tried to help Viki. Initially she rebuffed his efforts as she told him the ugly details of her life. \n\n\nShe told him that when she was seven years old, her father, Victor, had raped her for the first time. He continued to rape her through the years. Viki had been so traumatized by the molestation that her mind had split and she had created alter egos to deal with the abuse. One of those alter egos had taken a very young Jessica to a bar where one of the patrons had raped the child. The cycle continued, and Jessica eventually developed her own alter egos. Charlie was speechless and reached out for Viki. At first, she pulled away, however, Charlie was persistent and the second time he put his arms around Viki, she didn't resist him. As she calmed down, Viki explained that there had been a time that the monument to her father had represented how far they had all come. Unfortunately that was no longer true. \n\n\nCharlie understood, and offered to tear down the crypt for Viki. Viki appreciated Charlie's willingness to help but she told him that taking down the building wouldn't change anything. Charlie disagreed. He said that, at the very least, it would change the landscape. Charlie went on to tell Viki that he did not see her as a victim. In his eyes, Viki was a survivor, like himself. Charlie said that they would have bad days, but it was what they did in the present that counted. Charlie then professed his love for Viki and assured her that his love was everlasting. The words were a balm to Viki's heart and she allowed Charlie to lead her out of the crypt. \n\n\nViki was confused when Charlie took her to Carlotta's diner. Her bewilderment turned to shock when they stepped inside the newly renovated diner. It was an exact replica of the Bon Jour Caf\u00e9 in Paris, Texas. Viki turned to Charlie and asked him, \"What is this?\" Charlie replied, \"It's home.\" Viki covered her mouth and this time, the tears in her eyes sprang from joy.\n\n\n",
