Smelling a rat, Nash wonders if Jessica and Antonio asked Clint to keep an eye on him while they were gone. Clint confesses that he was asked to check up on him every now and then but sees that Brennan is in good hands with her father. When Clint wonders how Nash is doing, Nash assures him that he has no intentions of messing things up between Antonio and Jessica. Clint suggests that Nash have a \"funeral\" for Tess so that he can move on with his life. Nash decides that Clint is right and asks him to watch Brennan for a few while he takes a bottle of wine and heads to the pier where he writes a note to Tess and then throws it into the water symbolizing his new beginning.\n\n\nStarr and Todd go toe to toe regarding Todd's decision to pull Starr out of her high school to keep her away from Cole. Starr reminds Todd that what he did to Marty is much worse than what Cole did to her. Todd agrees and says that although there is no forgiveness for what he has done, there should also be no forgiveness for what Cole did to Starr. Starr also points out the fact that no matter what Todd has done, Blair always manages to forgive him and see the best in him. She accuses them of not wanting her to have a boyfriend who gets her or a best friend like Langston. Todd feels that moving Starr to a private school will ensure that she is safe from Cole. Starr runs upstairs leaving Blair and Todd behind to discuss how Todd should have stood back and let Blair handle the situation with Starr. While talking with Todd, Blair collapses in his arms. Todd insists on taking her to the hospital but Blair doesn't think that is necessary. When Todd makes her promise to go to the hospital the next time it happens, Blair wonders if there will be a next time.\n\n\nWhile Nash is saying goodbye to Tess, Jessica and Antonio enjoy a frisky encounter while waiting for their room to be ready. Jessica channels her inner Tess and seduces Antonio in the empty lounge. When Jessica is ready to go again, Antonio suggests that they wait for their room to be ready so that he can catch his breath. Jessica agrees and then reaches into her bag to find a little makeup to freshen up and pulls out a cigarette which makes Antonio frown. Jessica tells Antonio that she hasn't used that purse in a while since her Tess days. After being told that their room is ready Jessica makes a playful and seductive wager with Antonio about who will get to their room first.\n\n\nBo and Paige enjoy dinner and drinks while Paige goes on and on about how grateful she is that Hugh is alive. She also shares with Bo her gratitude that Natalie has been a frequent visitor lately. Paige wonders if she would be able to do the same thing if John were in that bed instead of Hugh. Bo listens but is unable to tell Paige that John may truly be the man in the bed and not Hugh. Paige thanks Bo for talking her into finding her son and how happy she is that she will be able to see and talk to Hugh tomorrow. Bo tries to get Paige to not get her hopes up too much but his pleas fall on deaf ears as Paige maps out her future with Hugh.\n\n\nMichael tries to keep Natalie calm as they wait for the skin graft surgery to be completed so they can find out if John or Hugh survived the crash. When the attending nurse walks by, Natalie shows her a picture of Hugh and of John and asks her to show her which of the two men came out of the surgery. The nurse tells Natalie that she has no idea since she has not seen the man without bandages. Natalie gets upset and Michael has to calm her down while explaining to the nurse that the man in the bed could be his brother and Natalie's fianc\u00e9.

After scrubbing up, Michael and Natalie wait with bated breath as the bandages are removed revealing John's face.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd tells Blair about how he came home and found Starr with Cole in the house. He also tells that he has taken Starr out of the school. They call Starr to come down. She does and is angry that her father is being so hard on the boy when he did something much worse to the boy's mother. Todd is furious that Starr is even starting to forgive the boy for what he did and orders her never to see the kid again. Starr tells Todd that he thinks that he is the only one who can make mistakes and get away with them. Bo tells Clint about what Natalie has been saying about John. Bo will not tell Paige anything about this until he knows more. He is investigating even as they speak. Paige arrives and has champagne. She is thrilled. The prognosis for her son's recovery is good and she will finally get a chance to be a mother to Hugh. She says that the very next day, she will get to see Hugh open his eyes and talk with her. Bo tells her not to get her hopes up. Todd isn't happy with the way that Starr's spoken to him and he starts heading to the stairs, but never makes it. Blair collapses before him and he has to give her all his attention. He holds her as she is falling, and seeming to go unconscious. She refuses to go to the hospital, so he gets her tea and aspirins for her head. Michael is not happy with Natalie when she continues about John being in the bed instead of Hugh. He thinks that she is losing it. She tells that the man in the bed has blue eyes, while Hugh has brown. This makes Michael listen somewhat. It is when she brings up Vincent's involvement as Hugh's friend that Michael starts listening. He doesn't like Vincent but it isn't just Natalie saying this. Michael turns to the window and looks in at the man on the bed inside. \"John is that you?\" Michael will work with Natalie to find out what is going on but he warns her to be respectful and let him take the lead. Natalie asks a nurse who comes out of the room to bring her the man with the soccer team in the room. When she gets that picture, Natalie and Michael wait for another nurse to come by. They ask her to look at a picture of John and Hugh and tell who was having the skin graphing done that day. The woman says that she has no idea since she didn't see the patient without his bandages. She has an idea on how she can help though. She tells that if Michael and Natalie scrub up and put on masks and gowns, they can come in and watch as the bandages are being changed. They go for the deal and hover impatiently while the bandages are taken off. When the final strip of fabric is removed, Natalie and Michael are frozen in time. \"It's him!\"",
