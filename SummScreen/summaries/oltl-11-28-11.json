Natalie finds out from her mom that Todd is devastated after Blair has decided she wants to be with Tomas instead of him. And she puts two and two together remarking to Viki that it's very coincidental that Tomas goes missing right after Todd reveals his unwillingness to let Blair move on with Tomas. Todd seems riddled with guilt. But it seems he has successfully implemented his plan to make Tomas disappear and possibly get charged with the murder of Victor when John finds the gun in question right in Tomas' dresser drawer. Matthew goes into cardiac arrest. Bo and Nora are both afraid he's gone. But the doctors rush in to revive him. And surprisingly, he awakens and appears to be ok. Destiny is with her family who argue amongst themselves about whether Vivian should marry Shaun. She somehow knows she has to go and see Matthew so she meets Bo and Nora right when Matthew opens his eyes. Yet, something they all forget is that he is unaware that she has been pregnant by him since he went into his coma."
