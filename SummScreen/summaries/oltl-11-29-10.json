She was ready to place another call when a pleasant and pretty young woman stopped her. The young woman had already been advised to turn off her phone, and she wanted to give Kelly a heads-up. The woman took her seat next to Kelly.\n\n\nThe women chatted during the flight, and Kelly made it known that the people of Llanview were great. She was going home to a \"special guy.\" She revealed that they'd had several chances together already, but they'd been young. Her man had even had an affair with her aunt, Kelly confessed, but Kelly had married him later. They divorced, and Kelly had fallen for her ex's brother. Kelly had married and divorced him, too, and she'd messed things up. Suddenly, she had second thoughts. What she was doing was utterly stupid. \"What am I thinking?\" she asked the young woman.\n\n\nKelly grew distraught as she second-guessed her actions. She began to breathe into a brown paper bag. She mentioned that she hadn't been together in \"that way\" with the man in a very long time. She was afraid he'd think she was crazy. The young woman thought that Kelly should take the chance. She'd done the same herself, and she'd had no regrets. She thought that the man would fall back in love with Kelly.\n\n\nJoey surprised his mother when he walked through the front door at Llanfair. He revealed that his airplane ticket was open-ended for the return trip to London, and Viki was thrilled. After exchanging their hellos, a tired Joey announced that he wanted to take his luggage upstairs to his bedroom. Reluctantly, Viki told her son that his bedroom was not available due to an old friend of Clint's who was staying with them. Unfortunately, the carriage house was not available either, because Rex, Gigi, and Shane lived there.\n\n\nJoey was perturbed that none of Viki's guests were paying for their living quarters, although Viki explained that she was thrilled to have Rex and his family there. Joey joked that he'd obviously left his mother alone for too long. She questioned him on his latest exploits, and he advised her that he'd been traveling. He changed the subject quickly when Viki asked if he had a special person in his life. He was anxious to see everyone, and he seemed surprised when Viki mentioned that Kelly was in Llanview.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, the young people were still upset that Eddie had punched James in the face. Bobby wanted to take his brother to the hospital, but James assured Bobby that his ears weren't ringing. He usually had trouble hearing after his father beat him, James muttered. Starr and Langston stood close, ill at ease, and when Dani and Nate stopped by to say hello, the couple observed that they had walked in on something unpleasant. James didn't want to discuss it, but Starr proclaimed that Eddie had hit James.\n\n\nNate was horrified, but James told him what had happened was \"no big deal.\" His father had arrived, James had asked him to leave, and Eddie had just gotten physical. It was obvious that the others didn't agree, and Bobby noted that his father had gone to jail. Bobby advised Nate to stay out of Eddie's way and to never cross him. Nate was worried about his mother, and he left with Dani. Starr was adamant that James hold ice up to his bruised face. Suddenly, the phone rang. Starr learned that Cole had been in a fight at Statesville, and she had to leave in a hurry.\n\n\nOutside, Bobby and Langston each told the other to keep an eye out for James. Bobby was beside himself, to hear that his brother had maintained that he wasn't injured because his ears weren't ringing. He hated himself for leaving his brother with their father. He had to leave, though, because he had something to do. Starr rushed out, as well, on her way to the prison.\n\n\nAt the police station, Bo reached his breaking point with a miserable Eddie, as the ex-con threatened to sue the police department for his arrest. \"Now you can add wrongful adhesive to your list,\" Bo told the man as he taped Eddie's mouth shut with duct tape. Nora walked in with a file and proceeded to read out the list of Eddie's prior arrests. \"What a charmer. How can Inez resist you?\" Nora stated. Bo removed the tape from Eddie's mouth, and the man made sexist remarks towards Nora, especially after he learned of her identity. Bo was ready to step in to stop Eddie, but Nora assured her husband that she was able to handle it.\n\n\nEddie was surprised that Nora wasn't a hag with the way Bo had been chasing Inez, Eddie announced. Nora mentioned Eddie's assault on James, and she noted that there had been several witnesses. Eddie was surprised to learn that James hadn't pressed charges. Nora noted that Eddie had probably been beating James for years, but Eddie told her it was only a \"speculation\" on her part. He and his son had merely had a disagreement.\n\n\nIt hadn't been an assault, and Eddie felt that James needed to have some sense knocked into him. \"And you think you're the guy for the job?\" Nora asked sarcastically. Eddie noted that he had never stopped being a dad. Bo and Nora exchanged disgusted glances, and Nora called into the station for someone to remove the \"gentleman\" from Bo's office. Eddie was amused. \"You're a good time,\" he told her. Eddie mentioned that he knew that Bo had been busy with Inez, and Bo was ready to attack him. Eddie told Nora to call him, since he knew he wouldn't remain in jail for very long. He'd treat Nora right, Eddie maintained. \"I can just imagine,\" Nora replied dryly.\n\n\nEddie figured that Nora was able to see how things were headed with Bo and Inez. He pointed out that his ex-wife was good at playing the victim. A police officer arrived to escort Eddie to the courthouse. \"See you later,\" Eddie said in farewell to Nora. \"Not a chance,\" she muttered. While Bo and Nora talked about Eddie's charms after he left, Nora noted that Eddie had made a good point in his description of Inez. Bo was irate. He couldn't believe that Nora had accepted what Eddie had said. Nora pointed out that Eddie had been married to Inez, and he knew her.\n\n\nShe indicated that they'd never heard about anything in Inez's life except for the bad things that had happened to her. Bo assumed that there were plenty of good incidents, as well, but Nora stressed that Eddie had been right. Inez always played the victim. Bo promised that he would make sure to find something to keep Eddie in jail in the event that James wouldn't testify against him. Nora was distressed and mentioned that wasn't really Bo's job as police commissioner. Bo felt that he had to do that, since Inez was his assistant. Nora wondered if he'd feel the same if Inez wasn't working for him.\n\n\nBo was adamant that Inez didn't have a crush on him, and even if it were true, he wondered why it bothered Nora so much. Nora was certain that Inez wanted Bo, and Inez wanted to break up his marriage. Bo disagreed and laughed, but Nora thought it was a serious issue. Bo noted that he'd heard about the plant incident in his office, but he'd had to drag it out of Inez, because Nora had refused to tell him anything at all. Nora was annoyed. She thought that their lives had grown consumed with everything Inez. All she ever heard about was Inez and her sons and her ex. \"What do you want me to do? Fire her?\" Bo asked.\n\n\n\"Say, there's an idea,\" Nora replied. Bo refused to fire his assistant, and he didn't think the situation was the way that Nora said it was. Nora felt that Inez had made Bo into her personal \"savior.\" Nora thought that Bo wanted to be everyone's hero, and he'd made it his job. While she liked that about him, Nora thought that he had a \"blind spot,\" and people took advantage of him.\n\n\nInez couldn't believe what she'd heard. Clint wanted her to sleep with Bo. \"Are you joking?\" she asked in disbelief. Clint explained that Bo had ruined Clint's marriage, and Clint wanted help to \"return the favor.\" Inez reminded Clint that he had told her that Bo and Nora were meant to be together. Clint clarified that he'd meant \"once upon a time.\" Too much had happened since then, he told her, as he gave her a brief rundown on Bo and Nora's history. Inez asked if Clint wanted revenge. \"It's a start,\" he replied. Inez was disappointed that all of Clint's attention to her had been only due to his plan.\n\n\nClint insisted that his interest in Inez had truly been from his heart, but Inez emphasized that there had obviously been a string attached. Clint thought the two of them could do business together, but Inez was repulsed that the business was to ruin Bo's life. \"It's time for payback,\" Clint told her. Inez was appalled and advised Clint that she wouldn't take part in his \"sick game.\" Clint responded that he was merely giving her permission to do what she wanted to anyway. He would make sure that Inez would have Bo.\n\n\nInez insisted that she wasn't interested in Bo several times. Even Nora had accused her of that, but it had been a misunderstanding, she explained. She only cared for her sons. She didn't want anything bad to happen to her sons, Clint suggested menacingly. She ordered him to leave her sons out of it. Clint continued, though, and asked if she were sure about that. He was certain that she didn't want all of the good things that had happened for her sons to just disappear. \"You'd take it away?\" Inez asked incredulously.\n\n\nClint just wanted Inez to work with him. He would be able to help Nate too. He thought that she must be tired of struggling, and he'd be able to make it either difficult or easy for her and her sons. \"Did you just threaten my family?\" Inez asked. Clint denied that he had. He would just take back all of the favors he'd doled out to them. It would be like going back in time, he told her. She could return to her life without hope. He reminded her of the state that her sons had been in before he'd helped them.\n\n\nClint suggested that James could return to work for his father. Inez noted that Eddie was in jail, but Clint reminded her that Eddie had gotten out previously. He doubted that Eddie would remain behind bars. Inez responded that she could never break up Nora and Bo, but Clint reported that the marriage was already falling apart. Nora had betrayed Bo in the past, and Bo hadn't forgotten it. Bo would try to settle his old score, and Clint was certain that Inez could benefit from that. \"It's the way of the world,\" he claimed. Inez was doubtful that Bo would try to steal Clint's girlfriend, and she was concerned that whatever Clint had been up to had been an act.\n\n\nClint wanted Inez to report to Bo that she and Clint had broken up. Inez refused and retorted that she planned on telling Bo everything that Clint had ordered her to do. She declined Clint's offer. Clint thought she'd regret it. \"I regret knowing you,\" she shouted as she stormed out.\n\n\nWhile Natalie waited at the airport for John to return, she occupied her time and looked at the flight information posted on the walls. She did a double take when she envisioned the signs providing personal information meant only for her eyes. The signs stated that John would leave her when he learned about the baby. \"He'll get his own baby,\" one sign read. Suddenly, he appeared behind her, and he held a baby in his arms. Before Natalie was able to react, the baby's mother caught up to John. An attendant was pushing her in a wheelchair. The mom thanked John for his help. \"He'll make a great dad,\" the woman told Natalie.\n\n\nJohn showed Natalie the stuffed bear that he'd received as a gift from Michael. The bear was wearing a shirt that said, \"MY DADDY'S ON THE LPD.\" Natalie looked up at the wall, and the flight information changed. It said, \"John's a cop, not a daddy.\" Another read, \"But Brody's both.\" John looked at Natalie and remarked that she suddenly looked ill. He made her sit down and told her that he planned on calling her doctor. Natalie assured him that she was feeling better. She'd been stressed the last time she'd felt ill, and this time was merely \"turkey coma.\" John declared that he'd missed her.\n\n\nNate and Dani arrived at Nate's apartment. He was embarrassed that it was small and messy inside, and he asked Dani to wait outside. She reminded him that he'd seen her untidy bedroom. She didn't care about such things, she told him. Her home in Tahiti had been a shack. They went inside, but Inez wasn't there. Nate wanted to leave his mother a note and then leave, but Dani wanted to remain and watch a movie. She preferred to stay there rather than returning home to be with her dad, she noted.\n\n\nNate was also ashamed of his father, but Dani reminded him that her father was Todd Manning. They sat down and prepared to watch a film. Nate assured Dani that she'd enjoy the movie with captions.\n\n\nNatalie and John arrived at Llanfair, and an ecstatic Natalie flew into Joey's arms when she spotted him. The group made small talk about Natalie's baby. \"Did I miss the wedding?\" Joey asked facetiously. \"Nice, nice,\" Natalie muttered, while Viki tried to quiet her son. Joey thought that John needed to \"make an honest woman\" out of Natalie. John announced that Natalie was the \"most honest woman I know,\" though Joey wondered if John had ever played pool with his sister.\n\n\nJoey had to leave. Natalie apologized for her brother's statement, but John thought they should talk about getting married. Natalie insisted that she wasn't interested, and she wasn't in a hurry. She hoped that John didn't feel obligated to say something because of Joey's comment. She handed him the Thanksgiving wishbone, they each made a wish, and they snapped it in half. Natalie won.\n\n\nKelly's plane landed, and before the girls parted ways, they introduced themselves. Kelly offered Aubrey a ride, but she announced that she was meeting her boyfriend. Her own relationship was still new, since she and her man had been doing some traveling when they met. Kelly thanked her for listening.\n\n\nClint spoke to someone on the phone and told them to \"make it happen.\" He was surprised when he turned and found Bobby standing in the room. Bobby was glaring at him. \"I need your help,\" Bobby said.\n\n\nInez went to the police station and saw her ex-husband. She told Eddie that she hoped he'd rot in jail for what he'd done to their son. She informed him that their sons had a safe home with her whenever they wanted. Eddie was surprised that Bo had fallen for the \"Mama Bear\" act. Inez called Eddie a pig, and she suggested that he wouldn't know a decent man or relationship. He picked up on Inez's mention of a relationship, but she ordered him to stop talking. He told her she should make her move, since Nora was \"wound up\" about Inez.\n\n\nBo and Nora sat in his office. Bo promised that no one would make \"chumps\" out of either of them. \"Unless you let 'em,\" he added. Nora stormed out to \"personally\" take care of Eddie's arraignment. \"Now we can all rescue Inez,\" she muttered. After Nora went by, Inez knocked on Bo's office door. \"I have to tell you something,\" she said.\n\n\nViki opened the front door when Kelly returned. \"Is Joey here?\" Kelly asked as she hurriedly walked inside. Viki informed Kelly that she had just missed him. He'd been there, but he had gone out.\n\n\nAt the airport, Joey found Aubrey waiting for him. The couple shared a long kiss.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Kelly is returning form London ready to reunite with Joey. After Joey surprises his mom by returning to her home in Llanview, Viki assumes that her son might have plans with Kelly. Kelly talks to a female passenger on the way back. And we see that Joey is going to meet this young woman instead of Kelly and he appears to have a romantic relationship with him. Bo and the cops take Eddie Ford to the station where she shoots off his mouth, tells BO that he knows that Inez wants him and is manipulating Bo into being her hero. He tells Nora that all they know about Inez is what she is telling them. And Nora admits to Bo that regardless of who Eddie is, he might have a a point that they do not know the whole story about Inez and she has indeed made herself the focus of Bo's attention and inclination to be her protector. Nora admits that she is very untrusting of Inez and believes that BO needs to wake up and she's not in a good mood. After James has been assaulted by his father but refuses to press charges, Robert tells his brother and tells Langston that he won't sit idly by and let his brother be a victim again and he must take drastic action even if James refuses. Meanwhile, Clint reveals to Inez that he wants to continue to \"help\" her and her sons. But he could take everything he's given away from them if she does not cooperate with him make her effort to break up Bo and Nora. She tells Clint she does not want to break up Bo and Nora and won't cooperate with Clint's threats. But Bo and Nora are having problems without her help as they speak.",
