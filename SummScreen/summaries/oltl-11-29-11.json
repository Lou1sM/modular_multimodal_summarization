    "tvmega_recap": "Matthew finally awakens after being in a coma for 6 months and seems as good as new and remembering everything. Yet his parents and Destiny all wonder how to tell him that she is pregnant with his baby. Natalie tells her mom that she wouldn't be surprised if John got back with Blair after he's gone to help her find Tomas. She also remarks that it seems obvious that it's Todd who made Tomas disappear so that Tomas could not \"have\" Blair Natalie has no plans to get back with John although others, including him, believe it's not over between them. Starr, James, Dani, and Nate find out Rick has been taken to the hospital with injuries and are afraid he could press charges against them for \"threatening\" to assault him although they know they never touched him. They discover he's completely covered in bandages in a hospital bed although it looks very fake. He threatens to arrest them and own all of their wealth although they kind of know he's bluffing. And there's still the unanswered question of who shot Victor Lord Jr."
