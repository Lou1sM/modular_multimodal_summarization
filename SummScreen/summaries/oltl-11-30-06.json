    "tvmega_recap": "Bo goes to see Spencer who has been sitting in jail and stewing in his juices over Blair's testimony in court. Spencer covers well, telling Bo that he is going to get out and that his only regret is that John will not be around to see it. Bo says that John just might. He tells the man's alive. Spencer couldn't care less, and doesn't understand why Bo thinks that this matters to him. Bo tells that this matters because another man was misidentified. Spencer is suddenly quiet. \"The man in John's grave is Hugh \" Spencer is quiet at first but then he gets angry and thinks that this is a cop trick. He thinks that Bo wants something from him and he asks what that is. Bo tells that he wouldn't play a trick like this. He too had to bury a son once and wouldn't want to see someone else go through that. Besides, he wouldn't hurt Paige that way. John talks with Michael and Natalie and is filled in on how Hugh was the one who died. He hears about Tommy being in the family now and how it looks like Spencer is finally going to get his. John has something that he wants to talk to Natalie about, but they are interrupted and he doesn't get it out. He says that it is about how he feels. Natalie calls Cristian and tells him to let Evangeline know that John is alive. She is thrilled. Later she has a private moment with John and he tells her that he wanted to say something to her before but then he had the accident. He tells her that he loves her. He wanted to have this conversation some other way but he is just glad to have a second chance. He hopes they don't screw things up this time. It couldn't get screwed up as far as she is concerned. He came back to her and nothing could be more perfect. Blair is supposed to be going to the doctor but when Kelly comes to get her, she tells that she is going to be helping Todd get his baby back. Kelly isn't happy that Blair has played this trick on her but she agrees to help. They go to see Todd. Kelly thanks Spencer for helping her have her baby. She shows him pictures and he smiles like a proud uncle at the sight of the little tyke. Blair knows that he must still have a part of him, that cares about people. He admit that he has that. \"Well then why don't you tell me where Todd's baby is?\" Rex has come into the area, but hides when he hears Spencer talking to Kelly and Blair. He listens to Spencer's answer about where Todd's baby is. He tells that Hugh is dead. Kelly gets immediately upset. She had no idea and starts to cry. Spencer shouts that if he can't have his baby, then neither will Todd. \"You tell that filthy rapist that his baby is gone! Just like Hugh is gone! Just like you are gone!\""
