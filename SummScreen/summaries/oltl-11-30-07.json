After hearing the unbelievable news, Bo questions whether Jared knew about the contents of Asa's letter.  Clint is also suspicious of the circumstances surrounding Jared's involvement with the family.   Nigel appears uncomfortable as Clint and Bo express their displeasure with the news; he assures them that the letter is authentic and never left his person after receipt from Asa's attorney.  Clint and Bo suggest several possible explanations, including Jared being in cahoots with Asa to deceive them.  Nigel attempts to convince them that he believes the contents of the letter to be true; Bo and Clint are unconvinced.  They suggest that if the information is true, that perhaps it should remain secret.  Nigel reminds the Buchanan men that his loyalties still lie with Asa and that he wanted that information revealed at the right time.  Clint believes that they should find out as much as they can about Jared before revealing any information to him and questions Bo whether or not if he wants to know all about Jared's past.  Bo tells Clint that he believes they can find out what they need to know by watching Jared's reaction when told about Asa's letter.
