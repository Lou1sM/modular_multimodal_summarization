    "soap_central": "\nThe Sons Also Rise\n\n\nAt the Buchanan compound in London, Kevin received a phone call from Clint.  Kevin related that he, Kelly, and Zane all had the flu and wouldn't be able to attend Jared's funeral in Llanview.  Kevin was thankful that Nora would be present to comfort his father, but Clint explained that Nora and Bo were visiting Matthew, who had successfully undergone surgery in a Seattle hospital.  Clint was certain that Nora and Bo would return home in time to attend Jared's funeral services.  Before hanging up with Kevin, Clint sighed, \"At least something good happened!\"\n\n\nIn the living room of the Buchanan compound, David studied an Internet article that detailed Dorian's rise to  mayor of Llanview, by default.  Observing David's interest in Dorian, Neville questioned David about his true feelings for Dorian.  David insisted that he and Dorian were soul mates.  As Neville quizzed David about Dorian, David inadvertently blurted out that Bo and Nora were also soul mates.  Unbeknownst to David and Neville, Kevin stood in the doorway and listened quietly to their conversation.\n\n\nConfessing that Bo and Nora had shared a kiss, David told Neville that David had promised Bo that he would never reveal the secret to anyone.  After convincing Neville to keep quiet, David was startled when Kevin emerged and asked to speak with David privately.   Alone with David, Kevin demanded to know if Nora and Bo were having an affair.  David tied to evade Kevin's questioning, but confessed after Kevin threatened to physically harm him.\n\n\nAs David explained that Matthew had witnessed the kiss between Nora and Bo, Neville held a glass to the door and eavesdropped on the conversation.  Kevin stated that he had noticed that something was going on between Nora and Bo, but he had ignored the signs.  David wondered if Kevin intended to tell Clint about the kiss.  A conflicted Kevin stated that Clint deserved to know the truth.  David urged him to reconsider.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy told Kim that Stacy had dreamed that Rex realized that he wasn't the father of her baby.   Reminding Stacy that Schuyler was the only person who knew that Rex hadn't fathered Stacy's child, Kim was convinced that it was in Schuyler's best interest to keep Stacy's secret.\n\n\nDisplaying a flattering outfit, Kim announced that she had a job interview with Clint Buchanan.  With a sly grin, Kim stated that she was interviewing for the position of his executive secretary, but planned to make a romantic connection with Clint as soon as possible.  When Stacy informed her that Clint wouldn't be in a pleasant mood because of Jared's funeral service, a confident Kim revealed that she had a plan.   Kim believed that they would both finally get what they wanted.  Deep in thought, Stacy replied, \"Yeah, if Schuyler doesn't blab that Rex isn't the baby's father!\"\n\n\nAt the cottage, Rex and Gigi told Shane that his grandfather was an evil man named Mitch Laurence.  Shane couldn't believe that anyone on earth was more despicable than his Aunt Stacy, but Rex informed his son that Mitch made Stacy look like a saint.  After explaining that Mitch was a sick individual, Rex told Shane that Mitch was incarcerated, and advised Shane to inform Rex if Mitch attempted to contact him.   Feeling his father's pain, Shane stated that Rex deserved a great father just like he had.   \n\n\nSmiling at Shane and Gigi, Rex remarked that he was lucky to have them in his life.   Gigi asked if Rex had plans to visit Jessica and reveal that they were siblings.   Rex informed Gigi that he planned to meet with Jessica after he paid Stacy a visit.    When Gigi wondered why Rex wanted to speak with Stacy, Rex replied, \"She's having Mitch Laurence's grandchild.  I have to protect them, too!\"\n\n\nOnce Rex had left, Schuyler arrived at the cottage and announced that he had something to tell Rex.   As Gigi stepped away to prepare a cup of coffee for her guest, Schuyler had a daydream in which he told Gigi that Rex hadn't fathered Stacy's child, Schuyler had.   In Schuyler's daydream, Rex returned home after Schuyler's announcement, and an irate Gigi accused Schuyler of betraying her and kicked him out of the house.\n\n\nGigi returned with Schuyler's cup of coffee and asked him what he wanted to discuss with Rex.   Schuyler quickly composed himself and claimed that he wanted to offer Rex his condolences regarding the loss of Jared.  When Shane wandered downstairs, Schuyler excused himself and left the cottage.   Confessing that he had researched Mitch Laurence's profile online, Shane told his mother that Mitch was a terrible human being.   Promising her son that Mitch would never hurt him, Gigi commented, \"Your dad needs us now and we can't give him anything else to worry about.\"\n\n\nAs Stacy and Kim continued to discuss their scheme, Rex knocked on the door.  Before Kim answered the door, Stacy made certain that her padding was affixed to her stomach.   Once Rex entered the loft, Kim raced off to meet with Clint.  Startled by Stacy's growing belly, Rex declared, \"We need to talk about the man whose blood is running through your veins!\"    Rex's statement sent shock waves through Stacy.\n\n\nPresenting her with a picture of Mitch, Rex told Stacy that Mitch was his father and gave her a quick history lesson about Mitch.  Warning Stacy that Mitch was dangerous, Rex cautioned her that Mitch might take an interest in her if he ever learned that they were expecting a child.  Stacy appeared terrified, but Rex promised to protect her and the baby.  Stacy smiled and thanked Rex for showing concern for her and the baby.    \n\n\nRex urged Stacy to study the picture and to memorize Mitch's face.  Before leaving, Rex warned,\"You never want to run into him in person!\"   Afterward, Stacy kissed the photo of Mitch and thanked him for causing Rex to show concern for her and the baby.  Staring intently at the photo, a gleeful, Stacy exclaimed, \"I'm starting to like you already!\"\n\n\nKim arrived at the Buchanan mansion and encountered Nigel at the front door.   When Nigel refused her entry, Kim spotted Clint and barged inside the mansion.  After introducing herself to Clint, Kim claimed to have known Jared intimately.  A curious Clint agreed to speak with her.  \n\n\nAt that moment, Nigel received a call from a nervous Neville, who desperately sought advice from his cousin.   Neville stated that he had a problem.  Stating that two members of the Buchanan clan were involved in his dilemma, Neville wondered which Buchanan heir he owed his loyalty to.   Nigel advised Neville that since Asa's death, Clint was the head of the family.  A relieved Neville responded, \"That's all I need to know!'\n\n\nInside the living room, Kim attempted to work her scam on Clint.  Insisting that she had considered Jared a great guy, Kim lied and told Clint that Jared had hired her for the executive secretary position at Buchanan Enterprises.  Claiming that Jared had promised to call her with a start date, Kim stated that she had grown concerned when he didn't contact her.   Once she had learned of his death, Kim stated that she wanted to offer her condolences and inquire about the job that Jared had promised her.\n\n\nA confused Clint informed Kim that he wasn't aware of her status with the company, and suggested that she resubmit her resume.  Kim gave Clint a sob story about resigning from her old job after Jared had promised to hire her at B. E.   Feeling guilty about Kim's circumstances, Clint phoned Kevin to inquire if he had any knowledge concerning Jared's decision to hire Kim.\n\n\nBack in London, as Kevin continued to argue with David, Kevin's cell phone rang.  Kevin appeared nervous when he realized that Clint was the caller.  As David listened intently to Kevin's conversation, Clint asked Kevin if he knew of Jared's new hire.  Reminding Clint that the position in question reported directly to Clint, Kevin suggested that Clint fill the position himself.   After receiving pressure from David, Kevin told Clint that he loved him and ended the call.  Afterward, Kevin said that he didn't have the nerve to break Clint's heart -- at least not during a family crisis.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Neville exited the compound with his luggage.  Standing outside the door, Neville exclaimed, \"Thank you cousin Nigel, now I know what I must do!  I must go to Llanview and tell Master Clint that Bo and Nora have betrayed him!\"\n\n\nAfter hanging up with Kevin, Clint informed an elated Kim that she was hired.\n\n\nLater, Kim returned home and told Stacy that Clint had hired her at B.E.   Detailing Rex's visit to Kim, Stacy was overjoyed that Rex had shown concern for her and the baby.  Pleased that her luck was changing, Stacy remarked, \"I have nothing to worry about.  As long as Schuyler keeps his mouth  shut, Gigi will be out of the picture in no time!\"\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Jessica was horrified after receiving Mitch's letter.  She stated that she wished Mitch was dead.  As Brody phoned the commissioner of the Napa jail to report Mitch's actions, he informed Jessica that it was only a letter and that Mitch couldn't hurt her.  While Brody spoke to the Napa authorities, Jessica attempted to burn Mitch's letter, but hesitated.  Informing Jessica that the letter was evidence, Brody prevented her from burning the letter.\n\n\nJessica stated that she wanted to read the letter, but Brody advised her not to.  Jessica insisted that she didn't want to be a victim any longer, and together she and Brody read Mitch's letter.   Jessica shuddered when she read Mitch's words, \"I look forward to visiting you and meeting my granddaughter.\"  Before heading to the station to turn the evidence over to John, Brody promised Jessica that he would never allow Mitch to hurt her again.  Jessica was visibly shaken.\n\n\nMoments later, Rex arrived at Llanfair and asked to speak with Jessica about Mitch Laurence.   Jessica explained that she had no desire to discuss Mitch.  She was stunned when Rex informed her that Mitch was also his father.\n\n\nInside Matthew's hospital room, Destiny was elated when Matthew showed her that he had movement in his legs.   When Matthew stated that he was glad to have a good friend by his side, Destiny inquired about Danielle.   Destiny reminded Matthew of the promise that he had made to help Danielle find her father.   Destiny appeared pleased when Matthew related that Danielle's mother had forced her to move to Puerto Rico.  Matthew said that he wouldn't have the opportunity to help his friend.    \n\n\nMeanwhile, Danielle rushed off the elevator and raced toward Matthew's room.   While Destiny assured Matthew that things would soon be back to normal, Danielle rushed inside the room and begged Matthew to help her.   When Destiny questioned why Danielle wasn't in Puerto Rico, Danielle related that her parents had been jailed and that she had spent the night in Child Protective Services.  Announcing that she had broken out of the facility, Danielle pleaded with Matthew to help her evade T\u00e9a and the law.   Referring to Danielle as a fugitive, Destiny stated that Matthew was recovering and couldn't hide a fugitive.   Matthew insisted that Danielle wasn't a fugitive, and said that he wanted to help his friend.\n\n\nAfter Matthew agreed to help Danielle, Destiny was appalled when Danielle suggested that Destiny stand out in the hall and act as a lookout.   Although bothered by Danielle's request, Destiny agreed.   Danielle apologized for upsetting Destiny, but Matthew assured her that Destiny would get over it.  Danielle asked Matthew if he truly wanted to become involved in her situation.   Smiling, Matthew stated that he would still be in a wheelchair if Danielle hadn't helped him.    Danielle squealed with delight when Matthew wiggled his foot.   As Destiny stood outside the door and performed her lookout duties, she frowned as she overheard Matthew and Danielle's conversation.\n\n\nDanielle acknowledged that her life was a disaster.   Danielle was convinced that Todd and T\u00e9a were setting Ross up, but she had an unsettling feeling concerning Ross's guilt.    Admitting that it was possible that Ross was lying and might have actually tried to harm her mother, Danielle stated, \"Do I really know who my father is?\"\n\n\nT\u00e9a, Todd, and Ross sat in separate cells inside a Seattle jail.  Stating that her daughter had been placed in Child Protective Services, T\u00e9a pleaded with the guard to allow her to check on Danielle.  Teasing T\u00e9a, Ross remarked that she no longer had control over his daughter.   A frustrated T\u00e9a tried to convince Ross that the DNA test proved that Todd was Danielle's father.  Meanwhile, Todd sat silently in his cell and stared at the DNA results.\n\n\nContinuing to taunt T\u00e9a, Ross announced that he intended to run off with Danielle.  Ross insisted that T\u00e9a and Todd would never raise his daughter.   While T\u00e9a argued with Ross, Todd sat in silence.  Moments later, Elijah entered the holding room.  Assuming that Elijah was representing him, Ross instructed Elijah to get him released immediately.   To Ross's surprise, Elijah announced that he was working for T\u00e9a and Todd.  Ross couldn't believe that his brother would betray him, but Elijah informed Ross that he hadn't forgotten that Ross had knocked him out cold and stolen his wallet.\n\n\nAs Ross seethed with anger, Elijah told T\u00e9a that Danielle was safe in Child Protective Services.  T\u00e9a told Elijah that Ross had been badgering her all night and that Todd was aware that Danielle was his daughter.  Pointing out that Todd hadn't uttered a word the entire night, T\u00e9a admitted that Todd's strange behavior scared her. \n\n\nRoss was outraged when Elijah related that he knew his brother had battered T\u00e9a, and Elijah offered to help both T\u00e9a and Todd with their legal troubles.  Todd remained silent.  Elijah was certain that the authorities would never allow Ross anywhere near Danielle.  T\u00e9a's only concern was that Danielle was safe.\n\n\nWhen Ross was allowed to leave his cell to meet with his public defender, Ross told T\u00e9a that he planned to run off with Danielle the second he was released.  Once Elijah left to check on the charges against T\u00e9a and Todd, T\u00e9a sighed,\"All right, Todd, Ross is gone.  We're alone now, talk to me!\"  Todd calmly replied, \"I hate you more than anyone I've ever hated in my entire life!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Rex knows he needs to tell many people that Mitch Laurence is his father. First he tells Shane who is worried to know that his grandfather is an evil man. Then he informs Jessica for the first time that Mitch is his father and he is her half brother. Then he goes to warn Stacy, assuming that she is still pregnant with his child (and not that it's probably Schuyler's), that his father and \"their baby's\" grandfather could endanger her or the baby. At that point, she knows she better never let Rex find out that the baby is not his. At the same time, Schuyler is ready to tell Gigi that he knows that Stacy is not pregnant with Rex's child and it might very well be his (Schuyler's) child. But he is afraid that it will make her hate him, for Rex to know he has no more ties with Stacy and for Rex and Gigi to get back together. And he realizes he better not tell her. Matthew expresses his gratitude to Dani for helping him to get the surgery so that he can walk when his own parents wanted to prevent it. So he's ready to help her escape from her own parents even though Destiny does not want him to see Dani ever again. Tea, Todd and Ross are all in jail and wondering what they will do now that it's been discovered that Todd is the father of Tea's daughter, whom he's never before knew existed.",
