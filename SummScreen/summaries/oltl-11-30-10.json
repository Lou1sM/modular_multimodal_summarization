    "soap_central": "\n\nKelly and Viki were chatting at Llanfair when Rex, Echo, and Charlie walked in through the French doors in the study. Kelly and Echo were introduced, and Viki exclaimed \"We're just one big family.\" \"That's great,\" Kelly replied, not too enthusiastically. Viki announced that Joey had returned home. \n\n\nKelly wanted to leave, and Rex hurriedly offered to see her to the front door. Echo voiced how wonderful it was that a woman and man could be friends when the man was attached to another woman. Viki rolled her eyes as Echo suggested that they learn from the younger folks' example. Viki agreed that it had been an evening full of education.\n\n\nViki announced that Echo was in Joey's bedroom, and she'd have to leave. Charlie suggested that a smaller room might suffice, but Viki confessed that her house was quite crowded, and there really wasn't any room for Echo. Charlie quietly stated that it was his house, too, and he'd been the one to invite Echo to stay with them. He couldn't very well uninvite her, he added. Viki suggested that Echo use Rex's loft, but Charlie revealed that Rex hadn't renewed his lease, since he'd moved in with Gigi.\n\n\nEcho stated that she'd move out, but Charlie refused to put his son's mother out on the street. Viki reluctantly agreed to allow Echo to stay for another night. \"Or as long as you need to,\" Charlie said. Viki looked at Charlie and grew angry, and asked, \"Are you serious?\" She grumbled that she'd never agreed to an \"open-ended\" visit, or even more than one night. Charlie promised that it wouldn't be for long, and they could figure out some other alternative. He asked Viki to do it for him, not Echo. He joked that he'd seen a naked David Vickers, so she owed him.\n\n\nViki consented, and Echo gave her a huge hug. With their arms wrapped around each other, Viki growled into Echo's ear, \"You cross me, lady, I will make your life a living hell.\" Echo pulled away abruptly after she heard Viki's tone. Viki smiled again innocently and voiced how happy she was that things had worked out. Charlie smiled as the two women seemed to be getting along.\n\n\nOut in the foyer, Kelly advised Rex that Joey had turned up in Llanview, and Rex was amazed that she had been able to get Joey to fly home. Kelly admitted that she'd had nothing to do with it, and she hadn't seen him yet. Kelly was only happy that Joey had never heard the drunken calls that she'd made to him. It was purely a coincidence that Joey was there. Rex thought it was possible that Joey had been thinking of Kelly.\n\n\nKelly really didn't know what Joey had been thinking, but she noted that Kevin hadn't been surprised when she'd expressed her feelings for Joey. Kevin had also told her that Joey hadn't been seeing anyone. Rex urged Kelly to call Joey, but she refused. She'd made enough calls to him. Rex persisted though. \"Haven't you put your heart on hold long enough? What do you have to lose?\" He handed her the phone.\n\n\nInez visited Bo in his office at the police station and advised him that she had something to tell him about Clint. Suddenly, Nora walked through the door. She couldn't believe her eyes and demanded to be told why Inez was back in Bo's office, without even any cookies. She thought they'd said goodbye to Inez earlier. Smiling as she spoke, Nora asked, \"Exactly what are you offering my husband this time?\" Inez wanted to explain, but Bo advised her they'd continue the conversation after he had a word with his wife.\n\n\nNora didn't want to linger. She was only there to make them aware that the charges against Eddie hadn't stuck. He had been released after claiming that his strike against his son had been a mistake. The judge agreed to let him out on a misdemeanor. Nora was sorry, but Inez was distressed. Inez was afraid that Eddie would go after James again. She wondered how her ex-husband always managed to \"slip through the cracks.\" The trio walked out into the lobby of the station and encountered Eddie standing there with his attorney.\n\n\n\"I'm sorry, did I interrupt your threesome?\" Eddie inquired with a sneer. Inez told him he was disgusting and the same bully who had thrown her out on the street. \"Do you believe this bitch?\" Eddie responded. He began to rant about how Inez had been the one who'd left him. The two began to exchange words, but Bo ordered Inez to stop. \"He's not worth it,\" Bo told her. Eddie had to sign for his belongings, and he turned to leave. \"I have to go collect what's mine,\" he said ominously. Nora wondered how Eddie had paid for his attorney, a well-known and expensive one. Bo frowned.\n\n\nEddie stopped to thank Bo for his hospitality, but Bo declared that he expected to see Eddie return. \"Don't even think about tailing him,\" the attorney warned. Bo wondered why he would even consider that. The attorney cited the actions and threats that Bo had already made against Eddie. He proclaimed that he was already able to make a case of harassment. \"Really? Try it,\" Nora pronounced, quiet until then. Eddie laughed and told Nora she was feisty.\n\n\nEddie asked Bo which woman was better \"in the sack.\" Eddie started to get specific about Inez's bedroom behavior, but suddenly Bo yelled. He ordered Eddie out of the station. Eddie told Inez she was still beautiful when she was angry. After Eddie had gone, Bo checked on the women. Nora advised him she was okay, though she shuddered. Inez was shaken, and Bo invited her to wait for him in his office.\n\n\nBobby paid a visit to Clint to ask him for some help. Clint couldn't believe what he heard, especially after Bobby had taken advantage of Clint's daughter Jessica. Bobby reminded Clint that he had paid for his mistake, though Clint gruffly advised Bobby that he'd still be paying if it had turned out that Jessica's baby was Bobby's. He ordered Bobby to stay away from Jessica, but he was curious about the help that Bobby wanted.\n\n\nBobby confessed that he needed $50,000. It was for his father, and it was the money that James had taken from Eddie. Bobby wanted to give Eddie the money in order to get him out of town. Bobby would tell the cops that Clint had arranged to have Bobby beaten if Clint felt that he didn't want to provide the aid. Clint wondered if Bobby were threatening him. \"Call it what you want,\" Bobby replied. Clint reminded Bobby that he was a respected citizen, a \"pillar of the community,\" and his own brother was the police commissioner. Bobby knew that Clint's brother was a man of integrity.\n\n\nClint spelled out all that Bobby had done to get himself in trouble while he'd been in Llanview. He wondered who would even believe Bobby's story. Bobby knew that his mother, the woman that Clint had been dating, would believe her son. Clint replied that all he had to do was \"snap my finger,\" and things would change for the Ford brothers. He advised Bobby to run to his mother and tell her his news.\n\n\nBobby accused Clint of using people to get what he wanted, and though Clint advised Bobby that Bobby was the same way, Bobby revealed that he had changed. Clint was just like Eddie, Bobby uttered. He made his way to the door, but Clint stopped him. He would give Bobby the money for Inez's sake. He handed Bobby the money and told him to be careful with it. Bobby thought it strange that Clint had that much money in the house, but Clint declared that he never knew when an emergency would arise.\n\n\n Clint told Bobby that it would be the last business transaction between the two of them. He also advised the younger man that he was not to mention the incident that had landed him in the hospital. Bobby thanked Clint and left. \"No, Ford, thank you,\" Clint stated as he picked up the necklace that Inez had refused to accept.\n\n\nTodd arrived at La Boulaie, looking for Starr, but James answered the door and revealed that Starr had gone to Statesville because Cole had been in a fight. James was aware that Todd didn't like Cole, and he advised Todd that his brother Nate was a \"good kid.\" Todd replied that there weren't any guys good enough for his daughters. He reminded James that Nate had dragged Dani into a bad situation. James remembered, but he added that it had been because of James in the first place. Todd agreed that the brothers were idiots. He thought that James was a \"wuss\" too. James had to admit that Todd was right, especially since he couldn't even stand up to his own father.\n\n\nTodd realized that James's bruised face was courtesy of James's father. James told Todd that it was okay to laugh at him, but Todd didn't think it was funny. He knew all about bruises that sons received at the hands of their fathers. He realized that the guest at Bobby's place had been James's father, and he understood why James hadn't introduced him.  James revealed that he'd tried to get away from his father.\n\n\nTodd recalled that James had stood up to Bull and risked his life to save Starr and Hope. He advised James that Eddie would be out of jail soon, and he would be angry. Todd had been familiar with a kid who'd had an adoptive father who had  \"roughed\" the boy up, Todd shared. It made the father feel big. It \"screwed\" with a kid's head, not just his face. It made a kid feel like he'd deserved it and wasn't worthy of love and respect.\n\n\nJames exclaimed that it sounded like his own life, and he thought that Nate had been lucky to be raised away from Eddie. Todd thought that Eddie was a lowlife when he'd met him, Todd admitted, but not a killer. James wondered how the kid in Todd's story had gotten away from the father. Todd related that the father had died. He would have killed the dad himself if he hadn't died, Todd muttered. \"I'd had enough by then.\" James grew quiet and thoughtful.\n\n\nDani and Nate watched a foreign film at Nate's place, though Dani was completely bored with it. Nate noticed and slowly put his arm around her. They began to kiss until something on the movie caught their attention. They turned to watch a sex scene, and Nate was annoyed that he hadn't remembered it was in the film. Dani couldn't believe the film was only rated \"R.\" Awkwardly, Dani jumped up to turn the television off, and Nate suggested that they talk about sex instead.\n\n\n\"We're getting closer,\" Nate said, and he thought they should talk about \"stuff.\" Dani admitted that she'd almost had sex with Matthew after she'd been upset to learn that Todd was her father. Nate noted that she'd mentioned it to him before, and he'd also heard about it from Matthew. Dani was not surprised to hear that. She explained that Matthew had been the one to stop it, but it had all been happening for the wrong reasons, and it was the wrong boy. \"Have you done it?\" she asked Nate.\n\n\nHe admitted he had, but only once. It had been a girl from his old school. Dani asked what it had been like, and Nate admitted that he'd thought it would be better if it had been with a girl he actually cared about. Dani wondered if Nate had ever thought about having sex with her. \"Only every minute of every day,\" he informed her. Nate wondered if Dani ever thought about the two of them having sex, and she began to stutter. She finally admitted yes, but Nate assured her he was fine.\n\n\nDani confessed that it was a big step, and she had a lot going on in her life. Nate understood that she wasn't ready, but Dani wondered if they had a problem, because she knew that he was. Nate promised that he didn't want to make her uncomfortable, and he didn't see it as a problem. They agreed to get back to the movie, and Nate assured her he'd fast forward through the \"naked parts.\" He offered to go out for some popcorn after he couldn't find any in the apartment.\n\n\nJoey was thrilled to meet Aubrey at the airport when she arrived from London. They shared a long kiss, and Aubrey mentioned that the flight had been a fast one. Her seatmate had been a very interesting young woman, and she wondered if Joey knew her. Joey laughed and told her that people in Llanview didn't know everyone else, but Aubrey shrugged. She assumed that all the gorgeous girls knew all the handsome men, she told him.\n\n\nJoey was intrigued, but he turned his attention to his girlfriend. He couldn't wait for his family and friends to meet Aubrey, the new woman in his life. She explained that she was a mess, and she didn't think Llanfair should be her first stop. She wanted to go to the hotel and take a shower, she told him. While Joey stated that there were showers at Llanfair, Aubrey felt that a hotel would be more appropriate. She reminded him that they had discussed it. Joey admitted that he hadn't told his family about her yet, so the hotel was probably a good idea.\n\n\nThe couple headed to the Palace, and as soon as they got into Aubrey's room, they began to kiss. Before long, the couple removed their clothing and made love. Joey's phone began to ring, but they ignored it. The phone fell to the floor. Later, he looked at the phone and noticed the call had been from Llanfair. He assumed it was his mother, and he was pleased that he hadn't answered it. He realized it was too late for Aubrey to meet his family.\n\n\nHe hated to leave because they'd been together almost every night since they'd first met. Aubrey couldn't believe how Joey was a part of her life. They took turns describing how they'd known each other for a month, since their meeting when Joey was out taking pictures.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Kelly tried to call Joey, but she received his voicemail. She refused to leave a message, and she decided that she'd just leave him a note instead. She asked Rex how he felt about his newly discovered parents. Rex admitted that he still couldn't get past the fact that Echo had dumped him in a hospital. He understood, though, that desperate people did desperate things. \n\n\nRex confessed that Echo and Shane were really getting along well together. Rex had also been staring at Charlie, looking for signs of the same mannerisms that he had, but he hadn't seen any. He explained how he'd seen signs of himself in Shane before he'd been aware that the boy was his own son.\n\n\nKelly thought that perhaps Rex was looking at things differently, especially since he already knew Charlie. She told him to look on the bright side. It was a great thing that Clint wasn't his father instead, she added. Echo, Viki, and Charlie walked into the foyer. Echo announced that she was staying thanks to Viki.  \"For a little while anyway,\" Echo clarified. Charlie accompanied Echo upstairs to help her change rooms, and Viki went off to look for her maid, Lois. Kelly and Rex remained, and Kelly confided that she would tell Joey about her feelings.\n\n\nRex left, and Kelly began to scribble her note to Joey. Just then, Joey returned home and spotted Kelly. They smiled at each other happily.\n\n\nAubrey called someone on the phone from her Palace Hotel room. \"Hey, it's me. Guess where I am,\" she said.\n\n\nInez called Clint from Bo's office. She asked if he had hired Eddie's lawyer to make a point. Clint feigned ignorance and asked if she'd told Bo about Clint's plan. She revealed that she hadn't, but she still planned to tell him. \"I don't think so,\" he replied. He revealed that he'd just given Bobby $50,000 to enable him to get rid of his father, because Bobby had been worried about James. Clint reminded Inez that he was able to get things done, and one could be either his best friend or his worst enemy. He assumed she'd pick friend, since she loved her sons. Inez abruptly said goodbye and hung up.\n\n\nNora was apologetic about Eddie's release, but Bo joked that he was glad that Nora hadn't accused Inez of setting Eddie free so that she could get Bo's sympathy. Nora felt that Inez would \"milk the situation\" anyway. Sharply, she asked if Bo planned to camp out at Bobby's apartment to keep an eye on the boys. Just then, one of Bo's officers stopped by to advise his boss that a unit had been parked at the Ford apartment. Nora laughed.\n\n\nBo assured Nora that if Inez had a crush on him, he wouldn't act on it. Inez was dating Clint anyway, he told his wife. He returned to his office and confronted Inez. She had been about to tell him something earlier. She announced that she and Clint had broken up.\n\n\nBobby stopped at La Boualie as Todd was leaving. As he reached the door, Todd turned to James and advised him, \"You're not good enough for my daughter either.\" Bobby told his brother that he had a way to get rid of Eddie for good.\n\n\nEddie walked through Nate's apartment door and spotted Dani alone. He whistled at her.\n\n\nEddie's attorney went to Clint's house to receive his payment. He confided that Eddie had believed the attorney had been hired through an \"Ohio connection.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Joey has returned home and given no indication to anyone he knows that he's seeing anybody, Kelly and all of the others assume that he will want to see her and possibly rekindle their previous romance. Unknown to everyone, however, Joey goes to meet Aubrey at the airport. They make out and get a room. He wants to take her to meet his family at Llanfair, but Aubrey knows that it may not be the right time to do that, right after she's met and spoken to Kelly. Yet she does not reveal to Joey anything about that. Joey admits that he has not told anybody about her, but he's obviously head over heels about her. It appears Kelly will get a rude awakening since she has no clue about Joey and Aubrey. Nora announces to Bo and Inez that Eddie got out of jail and the judge dropped the charges. He gets released and has a very expensive lawyer with him whom Nora knows. She wonders how Eddie is able to afford this lawyer. Robert goes to see if Clint will be \"motivated\" to give him the $50,000 that he and James need in order to pay off their father and get him out of town and out of their lives. At first Clint says no way, but he realizes that he wants Robert and Inez to think he's doing it for her. So he gives Robert the money. Little does Robert know, however, that Clint is threatening Inez with taking away Robert's job and taking away James' grant if she does not help him by sleeping with Bo so that he breaks up with Nora. James goes to talk to Todd to tell him he has to cut Nate some slack. When he finds out that James' father abused him, Todd reveals that he understands what that is like. Dani and Nate are together. When she is alone, and Eddie is on the loose, he finds her.",
