    "tvmega_recap": "Destiny reveals to Matthew that he is the father of her child after Nora's attempt to conceal the pregnancy. Matthew is furious that Nora coerced Destiny into becoming a parent when that was not the choice she was going to make. Nora says she would not have been in the position to make the decision if Matt and Destiny had not had unprotected sex without considering the consequences. Destiny tells Matthew that it is ok if he doesn't want to be involved in the child's life. He says he doesn't know what to think about the dad thing yet, but he knows he still cares about her. Clint rejoices that Matthew has awakened. He almost kisses Viki. Todd tells Viki that he thinks Tomas killed Victor. She wonders why he so badly wants Tomas to be the murderer. John tells Tea and Blair that the gun they found in Tomas's room is the murder weapon, but it isn't Tomas's gun; it is Dorian's. Todd wonders if John suspects that Tomas killed Victor. Todd provides a ready shoulder for Blair to lean on. Roxy accidentally tells Natalie that John still loves her. Natalie is angry that Roxy and Rex sat on that information for months without telling her. Natalie concludes that it doesn't matter because John would have mentioned it unless he hasn't forgiven her for lying about Liam. Natalie goes to the police station and tells John she doesn't want to pursue a romantic relationship with him."
