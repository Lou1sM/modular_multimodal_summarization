    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie is there when John opens his eyes the next morning. She thought that his mother would have been there already. Natalie leaves the room to call her. Vincent is walking to the room and bumps into Natalie. She thanks him for what he did and for bringing John home to her. They hug. John watches them hugging from his bed. Spencer is put on the stand and he gets extremely angry when his very own lawyer seems to be asking him questions that are going to torpedo his case. He brings up the reason that Spencer came to town and how the man who he thought was his father really wasn't all these years. He goes over how it was his mother, on her deathbed who made Spencer promise to find Asa and make him pay for discarding her the way that he did. \"Now Mr. Truman Didn't she turn out to be a lying whore?\" Spencer flies out of his seat and tries to get to the man to punish him for talking about his mother this way. The guards hold him but then something unexpected happens. Spencer starts pointing at Blair when he sees her staring at him and he starts talking to her as if she were his mother. \"It's all your fault. It's all your fault ma. DID YOU KILL MY SON TOO?\" The crowd becomes quiet. Todd doesn't buy it and neither do Nora, nor Evangeline. The judge calls a recess and Spencer is taken out. When court resumes a couple of hours later, Spencer has composed himself and he calmly sits beside his counsel. His head lolls around like a toy dog in a car window, and he just can't seem to get his eyes off the ceiling. Mark moves to have his client declared unfit. \"I call my next witness Marty Saybrooke!\" All turn to and see Marty walking in. Vincent bumps into Natalie in front of John's room.

Natalie tells Vincent later that she can't tell if John remembers that he was going to propose to her. Michael talks to John now and asks him if he remembers wanting to propose, and if he still wants to do that",
