    "soap_central": "\n\"Buenos Dias!\"\t\n\n\nViki entered Carlotta's diner at Charlie's request, and was amazed to find that the Angel Square Diner had been transformed into a replica of the Bonjour Caf\u00e9. After informing Viki that the diner was the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, he maintained that he had built the diner for her. Charlie stated that Carlotta had agreed to the changes after he explained the history of the Bonjour Caf\u00e9. Looking around the newly constructed diner, Viki exclaimed that she had many things to be thankful for. Charlie told Viki that he hoped that the new diner would open up possibilities for her, just as the Bonjour Caf\u00e9 once had. Forgetting her troubles, Viki reminisced about the happy times she shared with her friends from the Bonjour Caf\u00e9. When Charlie directed Viki's attention towards the door, she was pleasantly surprised to see Moe, Noelle, and Gigi enter the diner. As Viki greeted her old friends, they happily announced that Charlie was solely responsible for the reunion. In tears, Viki thanked Charlie and gave him a loving hug. \n\n\nWhile Moe prepared a Thanksgiving Day feast, Noelle told Viki that she and Moe were engaged. When Viki related that Moe was a perfect match for Noelle, her friend reminded her that Charlie was a good man who truly loved Viki. Viki silently watched Charlie as he joked with Moe in the kitchen. Later, Charlie announced that he wasn't giving up on Viki and asked her for another chance. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian had a chef prepare a gourmet dinner, but everyone was disappointed to learn that the Thanksgiving dinner didn't include a turkey or the other traditional side dishes. After insulting Langston's cousin, Lola, Dorian continued to fuss over the exotic dishes that were on the dinner menu. Sensing that Dorian was dealing with the recent family tragedies in her own way, Langston and Addie urged her to take it easy. Admitting that she felt terrible over the family's troubles, Dorian continued to compensate by fussing over the special meal. Along with Langston and Addie, Starr and Blair begged Dorian not to turn Thanksgiving Day into a fiasco. \n\n\nDorian answered the door and was startled to find her old friend Mel standing there. Dressed as a delivery person, Mel told Dorian that she was being impossible. Mel suggested that Dorian help her family endure their loss by simply enjoying their company. To everyone's surprise, Dorian returned and expressed her love for each individual member of her family. When Markko mentioned that Carlotta had hired him back at the diner, Dorian announced that she would place a call to see if the diner was open for Thanksgiving. \n\n\nAt Cris's loft, Vanessa wondered if she and Lola should leave town before they caused Cristian any further problems with Sarah. \n\n\nReturning to her apartment, Sarah bolted through the door and expressed her frustration over Vanessa staying at Cris's loft. After Talia and Antonio questioned Sarah about her terrible mood, she related the incident in which she found Cris comforting a half-dressed Vanessa. Admitting that Cris hadn't acted improperly, she asked Antonio why his brother was such a caring individual. Moments later, Cris called and apologized. Upon accepting Cris's apology, Sarah informed him that his entire family was present, and asked him to join them for dinner at the apartment. Realizing that his houseguest couldn't be left alone, Sarah told him to bring Vanessa, who the judge had ordered to remain in Cris's custody. \n\n\nAfterwards, Sarah hung up and expressed her displeasure over the fact that Vanessa would be accompanying Cris. When Sarah announced that she hoped that Vanessa would soon be deported back to Colombia, Talia told her friend about Ray Montez's allegation against Vanessa. After swearing Sarah to secrecy, Talia informed her that Ray had stated that he didn't kill Lola's mother and that Vanessa framed him and manipulated Lola into confirming her story. Talia believed that it was possible that Vanessa had shot Ray for the sole purpose of keeping him from exposing the truth. As she listened to Talia's news, Sarah's rage toward Vanessa intensified. \n\n\nCarlotta, Jamie, Layla, Antonio, Talia, Cris, and Vanessa ate Thanksgiving dinner together. An angered Sarah listened as Vanessa credited Cris for protecting her and Lola from the murderous Ray Montez. Unable to contain herself, Sarah blurted out the information that she had learned from Talia. Instantly, tempers flared. Vanessa and Sarah lashed out at each other, Antonio blamed Talia for revealing official police information, and Sarah verbally attacked Cris after he insisted that she'd had a few too many cocktails. Fed up with the conflict, Carlotta reminded everyone that Thanksgiving was a day of thanks, and she refused to tolerate the arguing. After calming everyone down, Carlotta suggested that they join the party that Charlie was throwing at the diner. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Matthew entertained Bo, Rex, Roxy, and Shane with a story about Grandpa Asa. After hearing stories about Matthew's grandfather, Shane wondered who his grandfather was. When Rex gave Roxy a knowing look, a look of panic crossed her face. \n\n\nOut in the foyer, Cole encountered Nora, who was waiting for the caterer to arrive with Thanksgiving dinner. After Nora explained that Marty wished to spend Thanksgiving alone upstairs, Cole blamed himself. Concerned that he would ruin everyone's holiday, Cole insisted upon leaving, but Clint asked him to stay. After apologizing for his past actions, Clint commended Cole on being a responsible and caring young man. Nora and Clint were both pleased when Cole agreed to stay for dinner. \n\n\nClint, Cole, Nora, and Renee joined Bo, Matthew, Roxy, and Shane in the living room. As Bo made a toast, Natalie and Jared surprised everyone when they entered the room. While Natalie listened, Jared apologized for the trouble he had caused the family and assured them that he had true feelings for Natalie. Jared made a special plea for forgiveness to Renee. Before Renee could respond, Natalie told her family that she loved Jared and would only stay if he were allowed to. Embracing Natalie, Renee told her that the family wanted to spend the holiday with her. Renee politely informed Jared that he could join the family for dinner. \n\n\nAs everyone anticipated Thanksgiving dinner, Nora entered the room and announced that the caterer had lost control of the van. Everyone groaned when they learned that the van had landed in Asa's moat, along with Thanksgiving dinner. \n\n\nEveryone began pouring into the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 for Thanksgiving dinner. When Shane noticed Moe and Noelle, he happily greeted them. Gigi smiled as she watched Shane introduce Moe and Noelle to his dad. Later, Viki stared around the room and watched the activity at the caf\u00e9. The Buchanans, Vegas, Cramers, Balsoms, Bankses, McBains, and several others enjoyed Moe's Thanksgiving Day feast.\n\n\n",
