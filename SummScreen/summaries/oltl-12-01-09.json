    "soap_central": "\n Missing Children \n\n\nNatalie sat in the church alone, prior to Jared's memorial service. She pleaded with God to bring Jared back to her, the same as he had done with both Cristian and John. She was not happy to see Roxy arrive. Natalie called Roxy a liar and a terrible mother. Roxy insisted that Natalie needed her and she wanted to take care of Natalie. She reminded her daughter of the many times Natalie had taken care of her while growing up. She wanted to return the favor.\n\n\nNatalie advised her mother that people had gotten hurt because of her when she didn't let people know about Mitch. Roxy insisted that she had pulled the plug on Mitch's equipment and thought he was dead. She vowed to stay by Natalie's side, because she loved both Natalie and Jared.\n\n\nAt the police station, Brody handed John the letter that Jessica had received from Mitch. As John read parts of the letter out loud, Brody promised that he would kill Mitch if the man got anywhere near the family. They were perplexed as to how the letter was sent,  since Mitch was to have been prohibited from any kind of contact. They decided they needed to stop him, and John made a call to the Napa police.\n\n\nAfter a quick discussion on the phone, John admitted that the police had given him the \"brush-off.\" They wondered if Mitch was paying someone off.\n\n\nBo and Nora returned to Llanview and headed to the station first. Turning towards her former husband, Nora sadly advised him that she would not be able to consider leaving Clint while the family was in turmoil. Bo understood and told her he loved her. As they leaned their heads together to share a kiss, Marty walked in. \"Am I interrupting something?\" she inquired. They pulled away and Bo announced that they had good news. They enthusiastically told Marty about Matthew having feeling in his legs. A thrilled Marty rushed off to phone Cole with the news.\n\n\nBo found Brody and John in John's office and heard about the letter to Jessica. John made a call to the head of the California Corrections Department and learned that they would look into the incident and stop whatever was going on at the prison. Bo shook his head in amazement, noting that Mitch didn't know when to stop.\n\n\n\"You're my sister, after all,\" Rex told a shocked, rather abrupt and perplexed Jessica at Llanfair. She ordered him to stop playing around with her. He explained that he had just learned that Mitch was his father, too. Jessica told him that while Mitch was technically her father, she considered Clint her father in every way that was important. Jessica appeared distant and Rex told her he understood her reaction to him. He recalled how he had tried to scam her family when he had first arrived in Llanview, and pretended he was Jessica's brother. He was sorry for his timing and noted that he was his father's son.\n\n\nAs Rex apologized for disturbing her and headed to the door, Jessica told him that she had received a letter from Mitch,  which caused Rex to stop in his tracks.  They were angry that Mitch had been able to get in touch with Jessica. She wished that Rex didn't have to go through what she already had, but she knew what it was like to be Mitch's biological child.\n\n\nCalling out to Viki in their bedroom and receiving no answer, Charlie retrieved a bottle of vodka from his pocket. Suddenly, Viki walked in and asked her husband if he was okay. Charlie quickly put the bottle back into his pocket. Viki assured her husband that having experienced the death of a child, she knew that it hurt and that he probably wanted to be alone. She just wanted him to realize that she'd be close by if he wanted her for anything, even if he didn't want to talk. She urged him to get ready for the funeral service and he headed to their bathroom. He retrieved the bottle of vodka from his pocket again.\n\n\nUncapping the bottle and looking at himself in the mirror, Charlie had second thoughts and started to pour the liquid into the sink. He thought again before the liquid escaped and recapped the bottle. After he was dressed for the service, Viki advised him that it was time to leave for the church. Charlie dashed back into the bathroom and put the bottle into his jacket pocket.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint and Nigel chatted about Jared. Clint couldn't believe how much of an impression Jared had made after starting out in town as a conman. Nigel advised him that Renee was too upset to attend the funeral service. Clint expressed how much he missed Bo and Nora, and how he couldn't wait for them to return from Seattle. He admitted that he had been jealous of the pair traveling and spending time together, but he had been petty. Nigel pointed out that Clint couldn't have been petty after flying the couple to Seattle to spend Thanksgiving with their son. Clint was originally worried about the strain to his marriage but he realized that he and Nora had a strong one.\n\n\nNora returned home to an exuberant Clint who was on cloud nine when he saw her. He gave her a deep kiss and told her how great it was to have his wife home.\n\n\nIn their jail cells in Seattle, T\u00e9a and Todd finally had words about their past and their daughter. Todd advised T\u00e9a that he hated her more than he had ever hated anyone, because she had kept their daughter from him. T\u00e9a repeated that she had never known that Danielle was Todd's daughter. She reminded him of how he had abandoned her on the island previously and the only reason she had survived was because of Ross. She had blocked Todd from her mind, she cried, after he had made love to her once and then left her. She had buried her feelings and dreams of him, she stressed.\n\n\nHe was gone from her mind when she first learned she was pregnant, T\u00e9a continued. She thought the baby, who filled her life with new meaning, was Ross's. Todd wished he had known Danielle as she was growing up. T\u00e9a swore on her soul that she was not aware that Todd was the father. She explained that as Danielle grew older, the girl began to remind her mother of Todd in many ways, and T\u00e9a  also realized that she had never gotten over Todd. She had to find him. Todd demanded to know why she hadn't told him about their daughter even after they had fallen in love and he had married her.\n\n\nAgain, T\u00e9a told him that she hadn't known and, in addition, he wasn't recognized as a father of the year. She recounted all of his past transgressions involving his children. She thought that she hadn't wanted to believe that Danielle was Todd's. Raising her voice, T\u00e9a reminded Todd of all of the times she had fought for and stood up for him, won his freedom, and even taken the blame for him. She fell in love with him again, even with his poor character. She had ordered the DNA test not very long before, she pointed out again. Todd felt that he wouldn't have attempted suicide if he had been told about his daughter. This caused T\u00e9a to laugh, reminding him that he already had a daughter in Starr, and that hadn't stopped him.\n\n\nShe'd had every intention of telling him about Danielle, T\u00e9a declared. She reminded him of h his attempted suicide and the fraternity incident when she'd almost died because of his actions. She hadn't wanted to take the secret to her grave and had started to tell Blair about Danielle but then they had passed out. She did acknowledge that Todd was the love of her life, T\u00e9a told him.\n\n\nTodd reminded her that he had taken care of her after she was hurt, but T\u00e9a retorted that she had been physically damaged and not in a good place. Then she had found him in bed with Blair. Screaming, Todd wanted T\u00e9a to admit that she was punishing him. He asked why she hadn't told him after his marriage proposal, since he had loved her and deserved the truth. T\u00e9a admitted that she had made a mistake then and wanted his forgiveness. She denied trying to punish him.\n\n\n\"Forgive you. No,\" Todd snapped. He would never forgive her, he continued. He accused her again of punishing him. T\u00e9a pleaded with him, explaining that she had wanted to know that he loved her for herself, not because of their daughter. Hollering loudly, Todd declared that he had loved her. T\u00e9a responded that she only wanted to have one perfect night together like they did on their wedding night,  one where they didn't have to worry about anything else.\n\n\nAfter that night, she went outside and saw the check made out to Ross, she continued. She knew that Ross might be around somewhere and she went to find him. Then Blair got to Todd before T\u00e9a returned and could talk to him. She reminded him that he wouldn't listen to her. Then she'd found him in bed with Blair again. T\u00e9a accused Todd of believing everything that Blair said to him. She noted that Blair would do whatever it took to get Todd back, especially after she lost John to Marty. Blair had been lying through her teeth, T\u00e9a shouted, about the scam she had accused T\u00e9a and Ross of committing.\n\n\nAs T\u00e9a continued her rant about Blair, she argued with Todd about the way events had actually occurred, like when Blair went through the window. T\u00e9a assured Todd that Blair had learned about Danielle then, the women had struggled because Blair had wanted to rush and tell Todd the news and then she had accidentally fallen. Todd refused to believe that Blair had been aware of Danielle. T\u00e9a laughed. Continuing her version of the story, T\u00e9a agreed that Blair had memory loss after the fall but she had eventually recalled everything. She changed her mind and decided that it wasn't a good move to tell Todd about Danielle, because she was scared that Todd would run back to T\u00e9a.\n\n\nA quieter and thoughtful-looking Todd uttered that Blair should have known better. He would never have run back to T\u00e9a, but he was determined to locate Danielle and be her father. He wanted T\u00e9a to go to hell, he articulated. The smile she had begun to allow was quickly gone from her face.\n\n\nMarty gave John the good news about Matthew. As they departed for the church, she said that they couldn't have heard the news on a better day.\n\n\nAs the casket was wheeled in, Natalie placed her hands lovingly on top of it and cried. She hoped it was all a mistake. Family and friends arrived at the church, and they gathered around to comfort her. Clint admitted that the funeral was harder on him than he thought it would be. Bo assured him he was there for his brother. \"I can always count on you, Bo,\" Clint responded.\n\n\nThe service began and Jessica walked to the front to give the eulogy. Inconspicuously, Charlie patted his bottle. Jessica observed that when she had lost her husband, she had lashed out at people in pain and anger. She had particularly lashed out at Jared, she said. Natalie's love for Jared had never wavered and that was something that Jared had been missing throughout his life. She concluded that no one would be able to take away the spirit that both Natalie and Jared had, not even Mitch. She promised Jared that he could rest in peace, because Natalie was in good hands. During the service, John received a call and left his seat to take it.\n\n\nIt appeared that the news was dismal and shocking. John told the unknown party, \"I don't care how it happened.\" John walked towards Bo and whispered into the police commissioner's ear. Bo rose and the men began to walk towards the back of the church. As the service continued, the casket slowly began to open. Natalie began to smile slightly at first, as the rest of the mourners looked on, horrified. The police officers stopped and turned around. Natalie's grin disappeared. The casket popped open and Mitch Laurence emerged!\n\n \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd tells Tea that he will never forgive her for not telling him about his daughter. But she protests that he abandoned her. Ross was there for her and for Dani. Plus given Todd's negative track record with his own family, she did not want for Dani to find out that the likes of him was her father. Bo and Nora don't know how to tell Clint that they are together and she is going to end it with Clint. Everybody gets ready to attend Jared's funeral. But it looks like somebody has escaped custody. Mitch surprises everybody by popping out of Jared's casket.",
