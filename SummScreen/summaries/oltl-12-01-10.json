    "soap_central": "\n\nIn Joey's suite at the Palace Hotel, Aubrey gabbed on her phone to an unseen friend.  She told her phantom caller that Joey had gotten them a great suite, and she thought she would like it in Llanview.  As she combed her hair in the mirror, she said that no one knew she was there except her friend, \"and some girl I met on the plane.\"  She promised to check back in after she met Joey's family.\n\n\nAubrey's call was interrupted by a knock at the door.  Answering it, she was greeted by a waiter bearing room service and a card from Joey, who said he missed her already.  Aubrey was touched by the gesture.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Joey and Kelly embraced upon seeing each other again.  Joey asked what she was doing there, and Kelly blurted out that she was visiting Llanfair to see him.  She explained that she had gone to London, as well, to see Zane, but admitted that Zane hadn't been the only reason for her trip.  \"I went to London for you,\" she revealed.  \"Me?\" Joey asked, confused.\n\n\nJoey apologized for being out of the country when Kelly had arrived in London, but pressed her for details about her trip, as she seemed to be holding back.  Nervous and shaken, Kelly said she needed a drink, and Joey poured her a tall martini full of olives.  As Kelly sipped the martini, Joey answered his phone; it was Aubrey, calling to thank him for room service.  Before Joey could begin a conversation, Kelly began choking on her olives.  Joey abruptly hung up on Aubrey and rushed to Kelly's side, performing the Heimlich maneuver until Kelly hacked up the lethal olive.\n\n\n\"You saved my life,\" Kelly mumbled, recovering.  She admitted she hated olives, but had been nervous seeing Joey again.  \"Why?\" he asked, clueless.  As Kelly began to explain herself, Joey's phone rang again.  As Joey answered the phone to in the foyer, Kelly began to rehearse declarations of love under her breath.  Noticing Joey's camera, she toyed with it in her hands.\n\n\nIn the foyer, Joey flirted with Aubrey on the phone as she promised to save him some strawberries and chocolate for when he returned to the suite.  Smitten, Joey hung up and rushed back to Kelly in the drawing room, and told her he had to go because \"something came up.\"  He asked Kelly if she still wanted to tell him her big secret, but Kelly said it could wait.  Joey said he had something important to tell her, as well, and suggested lunch at the Palace the following afternoon.  Kelly agreed, and Joey bid her goodbye with a peck on the cheek.\n\n\nAs Kelly left Llanfair, she was ecstatic at the thought of reuniting with Joey.  \"Is this really happening?\" she asked herself.\n\n\nBack in the drawing room, Joey picked up his camera and admired Aubrey's racy photo.\n\n\nAt the police station, Inez told Bo she had broken up with Clint, and said the relationship hadn't been working.  Feeling awkward, Bo asked if the breakup had involved him in any way.  \"Yes, it did,\" Inez began, \"but not in the way that you think.\"  Bo was baffled by Inez's cryptic tone, but before he could question her further, Inez said goodbye and walked out of his office.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Nora confronted Clint.  She told him she and Bo were fighting, and claimed it was all Clint's fault for making her as paranoid about her relationship as he was.  Clint feigned innocence, and said he had only mentioned Inez's interest in Bo because he was hoping to safeguard Bo and Nora's marriage.  As Nora complained about Inez taking advantage of Bo's \"white knight\" complex, Clint smirked behind her back.\n\n\nClint and Nora's conversation was interrupted when Inez called Clint from the station.  She informed him that she had told Bo they had broken up, but that she would not go ahead with his indecent proposal.  She told him he was despicable, and said she never wanted to see him again.\n\n\nDismayed, Clint hung up, then turned and confessed to Nora that he and Inez had broken up earlier; he claimed he hadn't wanted to tell Nora because he feared what it would mean for her and Bo.  Clint admitted that Inez had made a lot of excuses for dumping him, but said he felt sure it had to do with her unresolved feelings for Bo.  Infuriated, Nora stormed out as Clint gloated over his latest triumph.\n\n\nNora headed to Bo's office, and was unsurprised to find that Inez had already relayed the news of her breakup with Clint.  Nora snapped that Inez had run to her husband once again, and added that Clint had warned her that Inez wanted the wrong brother.  Bo said that wasn't the case, and recounted Inez's mealy-mouthed explanation -- \"she said it was yes and no.\"  \"Now what the hell does that mean?\" Nora asked, frustrated.\n\n\nBo said he hadn't understood Inez's explanation, but told Nora that if she trusted him, she would know it didn't matter what feelings Inez had for him, since he would never stray from his marriage.  \"I trust you,\" Nora said. \"I don't trust Inez.\"  She insisted that Inez was trying to get Bo into bed.  \"I'm not gonna sleep with her, damn it!\" Bo cried, fed up. \"I'm not the one that cheats!\"\n\n\nNora was stunned by Bo throwing the memory of Sam Rappaport and her infidelity back in her face.  Bo profusely apologized for his outburst, but said Nora's neuroses were driving him up the wall.  \"No, I get it,\" Nora muttered, upset. \"It's my fault.  It's always going to be my fault.  You've forgiven me, you're just never going to be able to forget.\"  Bo pleaded with Nora to stay and work things out, and said he hadn't meant to say what he had.  \"But you did,\" Nora replied softly, pulling away from his arms and walking out of the station.\n\n\nAt the Salingers' apartment, Danielle found herself face-to-face with a lascivious Eddie Ford.  He called Nate a lucky guy, and closed the apartment door as he advanced on Dani, joking that Nate was likely to get a lot luckier with her soon.  As Dani recoiled, Nate burst in and ordered Eddie to leave her alone.  Eddie taunted the teens with sexual innuendo about their cozy night together, and Nate ordered his lecherous father to shut up and get out.  Eddie said he was there to see Inez, and as he began to prowl around the apartment, Nate convinced the reluctant Dani to leave.\n\n\nNate headed into the kitchen to confront Eddie.  He demanded to know his father's intentions towards Inez, but Eddie was more focused on the prospect of Nate taking Dani's virginity.  \"For a little girl, she's got quite a pair!\" the elder Ford cackled.  Disgusted, Nate punched Eddie.  Eddie was impressed with his son's right hook, but warned the boy that he had just made a bad mistake.\n\n\nAt the Manning house, Todd and T\u00e9a were worried about Starr's visit to Statesville Prison to see Cole, who had gotten into a prison brawl.  T\u00e9a was sympathetic to the boy, while Todd remained characteristically unconcerned and said Cole had always been out of control.  He added that James was a young man who had good reason to be a loose cannon after being raised by Eddie Ford.  T\u00e9a couldn't believe Todd was expressing empathy for a guy who had taken an interest in Starr.  \"What's wrong with you?\" she teased.\n\n\n\"I'm not going soft on these horndogs lusting after my daughter,\" Todd insisted, but said that he understood James's pain given his own history with Peter Manning.  He reminded T\u00e9a that they had met Eddie at the Ford brothers' apartment, and explained that Eddie had assaulted James on Thanksgiving.  He said that James had covered for Eddie and felt ashamed, just as Todd had with Peter, and admitted it had all reminded him too much of himself.\n\n\nT\u00e9a wanted to work with Nora to build a case against Eddie and protect James from future abuse, but Todd wasn't convinced the legal system could stop Eddie, who had already beaten the rap several times.  He said he knew Eddie's type, and that Ford Sr. would soon be out on the prowl for fresh blood.  T\u00e9a was glad Todd had been there to counsel James.  \"What am I, a social worker?\" Todd cracked. \"It was not a bonding moment.  I don't bond.\"  He had only told James the honest truth -- Eddie had to be gotten rid of.\n\n\nA frazzled Danielle rushed into the house, eager to hurry upstairs, but Todd and T\u00e9a stopped her in the foyer.  Noticing her distress, they pushed her to recount her run-in with Eddie at Nate's place, and Dani admitted that Eddie had made inappropriate advances.  Turning cold, Todd stormed out of the house.\n\n\nWith Todd gone, T\u00e9a took Dani into the living room and asked her about her evening with Nate prior to Eddie's unexpected arrival.  T\u00e9a knew there was more to Nate and Dani's innocent \"movie night\" than Dani had wanted to say in front of Todd.  Dani admitted that she and Nate had discussed having sex, and that Nate wasn't a virgin.  She said that she felt like an inexperienced kid, but T\u00e9a told the girl that having sex was a huge step that couldn't be rushed just because one partner had more mileage.\n\n\nDani said that she trusted Nate with her feelings and her body, and that she had admired how he had protected her in front of Eddie.  She admitted she felt close enough to him to be physically intimate with Nate in the future.  T\u00e9a was calm and understanding, but asked Dani to be careful and not hurry.  Dani thanked T\u00e9a for her support, and mother and daughter hugged.\n\n\nAt the Salingers', Inez walked in on the confrontation between Eddie and Nate.  Eddie mocked Inez's friendship with Bo, and encouraged her to have him arrested again; he said he had friends in higher places than the police commissioner, and that his visit was only a warning to get Bo to back off.  He told his ex-wife that he would do as he pleased.  \"Tell your little girlfriend that when she's ready to supersize, she knows where to find me,\" Eddie drawled, leering at Nate.  With that, he sauntered out of the apartment.\n\n\nTodd met Eddie in the hallway, and introduced himself.  He coolly told Eddie he knew that Eddie was an abuser.  \"My Dad was like you,\" Todd remarked.  \"He's dead now.  And you will be, too, if you ever talk to my kid again.\"  Eddie pleaded ignorance and told Todd to leave him alone, but Todd warned him that if he wanted to \"stay out of the wood chipper,\" he would stay away from Danielle.\n\n\nIn the Salingers' apartment, Nate put ice on his bruised fist.  He couldn't believe how disgusting Eddie was, and expressed his doubts that the police could contain his father.  \"He can do whatever he wants,\" Nate said with a sigh.  \"No, he can't,\" Inez replied.  She told Nate that she was going out.  When Nate asked where, Inez said she was going to make sure that Eddie couldn't hurt them anymore.\n\n\nAt Statesville Prison, Starr and Blair awaited their visiting hour with Cole in the wake of his recent prison brawl.  Blair downplayed the incident, but Starr was terrified that Cole could be permanently scarred by his assault.  She berated herself for worrying about others while Cole was suffering in prison, and admitted that she felt guilty for getting closer to James in Cole's absence.  When Blair asked if Starr perhaps felt more than friendship for James, Starr said she couldn't let herself \"go there\" -- she had promised Cole she would be faithful to him.\n\n\nAs Starr explained how she had been there for James after Eddie crashed the Cramer Thanksgiving, Blair said that Starr's response to James's ordeal was natural.  Starr had a big heart, and as she grew and changed without Cole -- finished school, raised Hope, and made a career -- she would have to share her life with new friends, and more.  Starr insisted that she couldn't give her heart away to anyone other than Cole, and that caring for James felt like a betrayal of their love.  As the guard arrived to take Starr to see Cole, Starr hugged Blair and swore that Cole was the only person she wanted to be there for.\n\n\nAt the Ford brothers' apartment, Ford informed James that he had found the money to pay Eddie off, and told his little brother not to worry about who their benefactor was.  He said that it was his responsibility to care for James, and swore that Eddie would never lay a hand on them again.  His hopes were dashed when a police officer arrived to watch the apartment, and informed the brothers that Eddie had been released from police custody.\n\n\nJames was terrified, but Ford insisted that they would pay Eddie what they owed him and send him out of Llanview for good.  James didn't buy it -- he was sure Todd was right, and that the only way to be freed from the cycle of abuse was for Eddie to be six feet under.  \"And trust me,\" James growled, \"that thought has definitely crossed my mind.\"\n\n\nGuilt-ridden, Ford said he hadn't realized how much of an animal Eddie had become until he had watched their father attack James, and asked what had happened to their old man since he had left home.  James recounted how as a child, he had watched Eddie's abuse grow worse along with his father's alcoholism.  When he had sometimes found Eddie passed out in bed, he had fantasized about setting fire to the mattress with one of his father's cigars -- but James had never acted on his feelings, because he knew he would've been left alone.  Ford was struck by his little brother's confession\n\n\nEddie returned home with a cheery \"Hey, girls!  What's up?\"  Ford handed over the cash Eddie was owed and asked him to skip town, but Eddie said he wasn't ready to leave Llanview just yet.  James grew emotional as he begged their father to go away and leave them alone, but Eddie cracked they could \"hash it out\" in the morning and strolled off to his bedroom.  Ford comforted the frightened James, and admitted it might take more than money to get rid of Eddie.  He promised to banish their father forever, and said he owed James that much.\n\n\nTodd returned to the Manning house as T\u00e9a and Dani concluded their \"girl talk.\"  Dani took a call from Nate in the foyer, and asked her boyfriend if he was all right.  Nate said he was fine, but told Dani that he needed her to know one thing: \"I'd kill my father before I ever let him touch you again.\"\n\n\nInez arrived at the Buchanan mansion and faced Clint.  She told him she would accept his offer and seduce Bo, on one condition: \"You make Eddie disappear.\"\n\n\nAt the Mannings', Todd and T\u00e9a shared a private conference in the living room.  T\u00e9a asked Todd if he had threatened Eddie's life to protect Danielle.  \"Yeah,\" Todd said coldly. \"Something like that.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "A young blonde woman named Aubrey arrives in Llanview. She tells her friend that she is there to meet her gentleman friend's family.

She confides to Blair that she is worried about Cole but he is worried about James Ford too, but that she is afraid to feel too much compassion for him because she is concerned that it will lead to something more. She says she feels that she would be betraying Cole. Blair tells her that it is alright for her to care about people. Todd tells Tea that when he saw James covering for his father after he gave him a black eye, it reminded him of his own behavior with his abusive father when he was younger. Tea says she is going to talk to Nora about bringing charges against Eddie. Todd says the police won't be able to keep Eddie in jail for long and that he knows Eddie will look for fresh blood to prey on when he is out of jail.

Tea tells Dani that she is still young, but she is intelligent and that she is confident that Dani will ask herself the right questions to make an informed decision. Todd gets his coat and leaves without a word. Todd finds Eddie in the hallway outside Inez's apartment and introduces himself.
