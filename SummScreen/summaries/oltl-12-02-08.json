Nora brought in a breakfast tray a few minutes later and offered Marty a glass of orange juice. Marty was still disturbed by the dream and talked to Nora about it. Nora quickly sprang to Marty's defense when Marty began beating herself up for believing all of Todd's lies. Nora didn't think Marty had anything to be ashamed of because Marty's love for Todd had been pure. Marty wasn't comforted by the observation, which prompted Nora to suggest therapy. Marty dismissed the idea immediately. She didn't think a therapist could help Marty deal with the ugly truth that she missed her rapist. Nora empathized and told Marty about her disastrous marriage to Daniel Colson. \n\n\nMarty was stunned to learn that Nora's ex-husband had been a homosexual with political aspirations that drove him to hide his sexuality. As Marty listened, Nora revealed that Daniel had gone to unimaginable dark lengths to keep his secrets and in the end had landed in jail for his efforts. When Nora finished her sad tale, Marty asked her when the pain had stopped. Nora told her that with time it would fade, like a scar. She pointed out that Marty was not in love with the real Todd but rather with a lie that Todd had created. Nora went on to tell Marty that what had truly helped Nora deal with Daniel's betrayal was being a mother to Matthew. Marty didn't think that was an option for her, given her extensive memory loss. Nora disagreed and, after a brief pep talk, offered to take Marty out for lunch at the new Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, followed by a shopping spree for new clothes. \n\n\nTodd was surprised when the guard announced that he had a visitor. A few minutes later, Starr was shown into Todd's room. Todd's joy at seeing his daughter was quickly eclipsed by tension when Starr asked him if he had truly intended to kidnap her baby. Instead of answering, Todd told Starr that he was deeply sorry for the loss that she had suffered. Starr wasn't moved by Todd's condolences. She repeated her question and demanded an answer. She felt that, at the very least, her father owed her the truth. Todd reluctantly confessed that he had indeed planned on taking Starr's daughter and raising it with Marty. Despite having known the truth when she asked the question, Starr seemed shocked to hear her father admit to his nefarious deeds. Todd, however, was quick to justify his actions and defend himself with the argument that he had changed his mind about taking Hope at the last minute. Starr was unimpressed and accused Todd of lying. She felt that Todd's reasons for taking the baby had nothing to do with anyone but Todd. Starr went on to condemn her father for what he had done to Marty. She was disgusted that he had never disclosed to Marty that he was her rapist. Todd insisted that his love for Marty had changed him. He said Marty's love for him changed his mind about taking Starr's baby. Starr remained unmoved by her father's declarations of love. She told him that he didn't know the meaning of the word love and then walked out of his room. \n\n\nLater, Todd looked into the mirror while Starr and Marty's voices rang through his head. Marty accused him of raping her all over again while Starr repeatedly asked him why he had plotted to take her baby from her. The guard interrupted the tumultuous thoughts by announcing another visitor. \n\n\nRoxy found John at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9 and immediately began grilling him about whom he would choose: Blair or Marty. John was tight-lipped and refused to discuss his personal life with Roxy. Roxy wasn't deterred and continued hammering away at him, but John proved to be stubborn. Eventually he reminded her of her hair salon and managed to shoo Roxy away. John was about to call Blair on his cell phone when Nora and Marty walked into the diner. \n\n\nBlair was looking for Starr, but found Dorian instead. Dorian was busy in La Boulaie's kitchen bagging up the untouched gourmet Thanksgiving dinner that the family had abandoned. She intended to donate it to a shelter. Blair was stunned when Dorian informed her that Starr had gone to school with Langston. Blair felt that Starr needed more time to deal with the birth and death of her infant daughter. Dorian disagreed and insisted that what Starr needed were answers about the cause of death of her child. Blair said that Starr had too much on her plate to deal with and warned Dorian to drop the matter. Dorian switched gears by telling Blair that she knew John had recently spent the night in Blair's bed. \n\n\nBlair made it clear that she and John had slept in her bed, not had sex. Afterwards they had talked and played cards. Blair felt that John had turned to her because he needed time to be still and think. Dorian was skeptical, but didn't pursue it. Instead, Dorian focused on Blair's relationship with John. Dorian worried that John would use Blair as his fallback plan if things didn't work out with Marty. Blair appreciated her aunt's concern but reassured Dorian that she was perfectly capable of looking out for herself. They were soon interrupted by a phone call from Dr. Joplin advising her that the baby's autopsy results were back. \n\n\nMarcie asked Michael for a ride to the hospital. Marcie wanted to see Dr. Joplin to ask her about Hope's passing. Michael worried that learning how the baby had died would be too hard on Marcie. Marcie explained that she had given up everything for Hope, including Michael. Marcie needed to know, for her peace of mind, what had taken Hope. The issue became moot minutes later when Dr. Joplin called to let Marcie know that she had the baby's autopsy results. \n\n\nDr. Joplin was in the process of filling out an NICU Admissions Form for Starr's baby when a knock at her door interrupted it. It was the coroner with autopsy results for baby Hope. Dr. Joplin was distraught when she learned that the baby could have been saved with a simple blood transfusion. Bob told Dr. Joplin that she should have caught the condition but went on to say that NICU shared the blame because they should have, as well. Dr. Joplin admitted that she had been under tremendous stress and was overworked. Bob was sympathetic, but pointed out that she should have asked for help if she felt overwhelmed. After he left, Dr. Joplin opened up her laptop and brought up the NICU admissions form. \n\n\nMarcie, Michael, Dorian, and Blair were gathered in Dr. Joplin's waiting room when Starr walked in and announced that she had paid her father a visit. Blair was upset but Starr explained that it was something that she had needed to do. Their conversation was cut short when Dr. Joplin opened her door and invited everyone into her office. Dorian immediately began making threats about investigating the cause of baby Hope's death but Dr. Joplin interrupted her mid-tirade with an announcement. She informed everyone that the autopsy results were in. Everyone was startled when Dr. Joplin took full responsibility for the baby's death. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr goes to confront her father for what he did. He admits that he was ready to steal her baby and run away with Marty to raise the baby. Marty motivated him to be a better man, and he fell in love with her. Marty admits to Nora that she still feels herself in love with Todd and unable to remember him as her rapist. Nora shares with Marty that she felt similarly betrayed by loving Daniel Colson. Dr. Joplin calls Marcie, Michael, Dorian, Blair and Starr to her office after getting the autopsy report on Starr's baby. It looks like she failed to see something she was completely incapable of seeing. She admits to them that she blames herself for the baby's death.",
