Rex asked about Kelly's encounter with Joey the night before. She hadn't told Joey of her feelings, but she was more sure than ever about how she felt about him. She informed Rex that she was meeting Joey at the Palace for lunch, and she needed to be calm. Rex told Kelly that he had actually shown up at the Sun to look for work. Kelly told him to wait for Todd and then asked how she looked.\n\n\nAubrey told Joey on the phone that she was nervous to meet his parents. He said that they would love her. She asked him if it was a good idea to keep her a surprise to them. Joey related that they just wanted him to be happy, and that they weren't judgmental.\n\n\nViki opened the door of Llanfair to Nora, who wanted to talk to Viki about Inez. Nora believed that Bo's secretary was trying to destroy Bo and Nora's marriage. Not meaning to only talk about herself, Nora asked if Charlie was excited about having Rex as his son. Viki said that Charlie was happy, but she believed that Echo was trying to destroy Viki and Charlie's marriage.\n\n\nNora couldn't believe that Echo hadn't learned her lesson after trying to steal Clint from Viki. Viki asked about Inez, and Nora told her that Inez had broken up with Clint because she wanted Bo. Nora was horrified at how she was talking about Inez, but she thought the woman was causing trouble for her and Bo. She began to tell Viki about how she and Bo had argued the night before, but Joey entered and interrupted.\n\n\nJoey was happy to see Nora and apologized for missing her wedding. She asked if he had missed it in protest, but Joey denied it. He was sorry for his father, but he believed that Bo and Nora were meant to be together. Joey told his mother to take Charlie to lunch at the Palace because he had something huge to tell them. He left, and Nora continued telling Viki about Bo, saying that he wasn't the cheater of the two of them.\n\n\nViki couldn't believe that Bo would throw the affair with Sam in Nora's face, and assured Nora that Bo had just been angry. Nora had slept in her office the night before and hadn't been taking Bo's calls. She didn't know what to say to him, and decided that she couldn't forgive Bo if he couldn't forgive her. Viki thought that the couple needed to talk, and related that Nora was lucky that Inez wasn't living with them.\n\n\nNora was shocked to learn that Charlie had asked Echo to move into Llanfair. Viki mocked Charlie, saying that Echo was broke and had nowhere to go, she was the mother of his son, and they had so much room. Charlie had told her to have compassion and, if she showed the least bit of suspicion, she was seen as the bad guy. Both women hated the way they were acting, but knew they were right. Nora asked how they were supposed to fight back.\n\n\nViki didn't know how to handle Echo, but Nora warned Viki not to let Echo manipulate the couple into having the same fight Nora and Bo did. Nora said she would talk to Bo if Viki talked to Charlie. Viki was excited to have lunch with \"no Echo.\" Nora left and sat outside of Llanfair.\n\n\nStarr arrived at the Sun and found Todd. She divulged that Cole had told her about the restraining order Todd had put in against Marty. Starr was angry that Todd had tricked her into signing it, even though he seemed pleased with himself. He admitted to taking advantage of her distraction over Cole. Starr reminded him that Hope was her daughter, and she was going to get the order lifted. Todd warned her that Marty was dangerous.\n\n\nStarr related that Marty had made a mistake, and that Hannah had fooled Cole as well. Todd said that Starr would've died if it weren't for James, and that Marty had \nprobably really wanted Hannah to go after Starr. Starr thought that Todd was just trying to wipe every trace of Cole out of her life, but she wasn't going to let him do it. Todd told Starr that she would regret it, and she left.\n\n\nTodd went into his office and found Rex. Since Todd's own private investigator had \"gone AWOL,\" he needed Rex's help to dig up dirt on Marty. Rex wondered why, and Todd replied that he was trying to convince Starr that Marty was a threat. Rex reminded Todd that he still had to pay if Rex didn't find anything. \"Then find something,\" Todd replied. Todd also needed Rex's help to keep an eye on \"a new perv in town,\" Eddie Ford.\n\n\nEddie arrived at Clint's and told him that the limo was a nice touch. However, if Clint was anything like Bo, Eddie wasn't interested in doing business. Clint assured Eddie that he was nothing like Bo, and said that Eddie would change his mind once he saw what Clint had for him. Clint walked over to a table with a briefcase on it, opened the case, and pointed a gun at Eddie. Eddie asked if Clint was going to shoot him.\n\n\nClint turned the briefcase around, showing Eddie piles of cash. Clint said the money would be Eddie's if he agreed to a few terms. Clint needed a favor.  Eddie asked if he was supposed to kill someone. Suddenly, Bo entered the house, yelling for Clint. Clint went into the foyer and said he wasn't in the mood for company. The two went into the living room with Eddie and the briefcase nowhere in sight.\n\n\nBo said that Inez told him about the breakup. Clint corrected Bo and said that Inez had broken up with him. Bo asked if Clint had meant it when he'd said that Inez liked Bo. Clint said he'd meant it, but Bo said he was happily married, and there would never be an \"Inez and me.\" Bo confessed that he had spent the previous night trying to convince Nora that he loved her, but had ended up saying something stupid. Clint thought that they could get past the crush.\n\n\nBo hoped that Clint didn't blame him for Inez breaking up with Clint. Clint assured Bo that he had taken worse. Bo offered help if Clint needed anything, and Bo left. Eddie emerged from hiding.\n\n\nAs Bo walked out of the living room, Joey entered the house, happy to see his uncle. Joey told Bo that he had just seen Nora looking upset. Bo left, and Joey entered the living room. Joey invited his father to lunch at the Palace because he had something important to talk about, and they had a lot of catching up to do. He told Clint to bring his girlfriend, but Clint admitted that the relationship hadn't worked out. Joey was sorry for Clint's recent troubles with women, but Clint told Joey not to worry and said goodbye to his son.\n\n\nClint returned to Eddie and said that Eddie would get his money after he did what he needed to do. Clint asked if they had an understanding, which Eddie agreed to. Clint gave Eddie the gun, and Eddie left. Talking to a picture of Asa, Clint said that he was doing everything he needed to do in order to protect the family.\n\n\nJames opened the apartment door to Inez. Ford asked Inez what she was doing there. She wanted to make sure her sons were all right. James said that Eddie had been gone when James woke up, so the three wondered where he could have gone. Even though Eddie had rubbed it in their faces that he wasn't going anywhere, Ford wondered if Eddie would even return.\n\n\nJames left to get dressed, and Inez asked Ford if something had happened. Ford said he had paid Eddie the fifty thousand dollars Eddie was owed. Ford wondered what was going on as Inez thought about when she had asked Clint to make Eddie disappear. Inez hoped something convinced Eddie to stay out of their lives. Ford admitted that he had gone to Clint for the money because he had needed to do something. Clint was the only one he could think of to ask for help. Inez confessed that she and Clint had broken up because Clint was \"as bad as your father.\"\n\n\nFord warned his mother to stay away from Clint, and asked why they had broken up. He asked if Clint had hurt her, but she denied it. She blurted out that she didn't know what to do. James returned and asked if anyone wanted to go to breakfast. Inez and Ford took a rain check, so James went himself. Inez told Ford to call if Eddie returned. Ford asked her what she had been planning to say before, but she said it wasn't important, and that she was just doing what she needed to for James. She left a confused Ford.\n\n\nAt the diner, John assured Marty that he had gotten Cole moved to a safer wing of Statesville after his fight. He wished he could do something about the restraining order. Marty thought back to when she had wrapped Natalie's DNA test results as she took out the box. She wanted to show her gratitude to John. She could tell he was going to be a wonderful father by the way he took care of Cole. As he started to open the gift, she hoped she hadn't gone overboard, but believed it was something he needed.\n\n\nStarr entered the diner and saw Marty. She assured Marty that Todd had tricked her into signing the paper. John, wanting to give them time to talk, went outside to make a few calls. Marty told Starr that she would take responsibility for her actions if Starr would for her own. Starr was confused about what Marty was referring to. Marty yelled that Cole never would have turned to Hannah if Starr hadn't been \"running around\" with James.\n\n\nStarr denied the accusation, saying that she broke off her friendship with James the minute she found out that it bothered Cole. Marty said that Starr falling in love with James had started Cole's downward spiral. \"Speak of the devil,\" Marty spat as James entered. James asked if everything was all right. \"I'm done here,\" Starr said angrily, and stormed out of the diner. James followed her out and asked what had happened. She explained that Marty blamed Cole's problems on Starr apparently falling in love with James.\n\n\nStarr went on to say that Marty was being irrational, and that Starr had thought Todd was being paranoid by telling her to stay away from Marty. As the two left, Marty glared at them through the window.\n\n\nJohn returned and asked Marty how things had gone with Starr. \"Not great,\" she said. John assured her that, in time, Starr would get the restraining order lifted. Marty was grateful to John for talking her down, and said that was another reason for him to open his gift.\n\n\nInez arrived at Clint's and demanded to know what he had done to Eddie. Clint was just doing what she had asked -- making sure that Eddie didn't hurt her sons. He urged her not to worry because James was safe. Clint related that she could hold up her end of their bargain. Inez said she couldn't sleep with Bo. \"Can't or won't?\" Clint asked. She explained that Bo would never cheat on Nora. However, Clint said that Nora wouldn't be a problem.\n\n\nBo arrived outside the diner and decided it was time for him and Nora to talk. He took out his phone and dialed her number. Sitting outside Llanfair, Nora heard her phone ring and dug in her purse for it. As she was about to answer it, a gloved hand grabbed her.\n\n\nAt the bar at the Palace, Aubrey's phone rang. She told the person on the other end that she couldn't talk because Joey would be there soon. Kelly entered and recognized Aubrey. She tapped Aubrey on the shoulder. Happy to see Kelly, Aubrey hung up the phone and told Kelly to stick around if she wanted to see Aubrey \"die of anxiety.\" Aubrey was nervous to meet her boyfriend's parents for the first time.\n\n\nAubrey asked how things had gone with Kelly and her ex, but Kelly said she hadn't told him anything. She was supposed to meet him at the Palace because he had news for her. Aubrey related that she would love to meet the man. Aubrey said that Kelly was very \"put together\" and gorgeous. Kelly laughed, but Aubrey asked if Kelly would help her pick out something to wear. Kelly agreed and, as the two took sips of their coffees, Joey entered the restaurant at the Palace.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Dorian ordered drinks because she would need them to get through a meeting with Echo. Echo entered and sat down at the table. She was surprised about Dorian's invitation. Dorian said that she wanted to start over and be friends. She owed Echo an apology; Echo agreed. Echo said that all of their trouble had been \"eons ago.\"\n\n\nEcho admitted that she liked Charlie, and Dorian said it was a pity that he was happily married. Dorian asked if Echo had moved into Llanfair to be closer to Charlie. Echo said she had moved in because she was \"financially challenged.\" Dorian offered for Echo to move into La Boulaie. Echo thanked Dorian, but declined because she liked being \"steps away\" from her family.\n\n\nDorian toasted to Echo giving Charlie the greatest gift, especially since the baby could have easily been Clint's. A tipsy Echo said that she hated the thought of hurting Charlie. Dorian related that it had taken courage to tell the truth about Rex, and that Clint had probably been devastated that Rex wasn't his. Echo laughed and slurred that Clint was ecstatic, and would have done anything to make sure that Rex wasn't his son.\n\n\nDorian asked what Clint could have done because Echo herself had announced that Charlie was Rex's father. Echo confessed that she hadn't wanted to announce it. Echo laughed about the expression that had been on Clint's face when Viki had demanded a DNA test. Dorian wondered why Clint had been so angry. She wondered if it was possible that Clint was Rex's father and not Charlie.\n\n\n",
