She didn't think it was appropriate for him to be setting caged mice free, especially since they were headed to the school salad bar. An arrogant Jack scoffed that everyone believed a low paid school worker over him. Blair was dismayed that Jack was beginning to sound more like Todd every day. Jack was annoyed that his father was gone and had even missed their Thanksgiving.\n\n\nBlair explained that Todd had gone to Seattle to settle some issues with T\u00e9a. Jack wondered why his father would do that after T\u00e9a had taken his money. Blair reluctantly admitted that she was the reason that Todd and T\u00e9a had broken up and that T\u00e9a had not really done what she was accused of. She admitted to loving Todd but told her son that Todd and T\u00e9a needed to sort things out.\n\n\nA phone call interrupted Blair and Jack, and Blair learned that Todd had been arrested for attempted kidnapping. She informed Jack that she would be leaving for Seattle to help Todd out.\n\n\nDorian was prepared to end her swearing-in ceremony by granting marriage licenses to all of the couples who took part in the same-sex ceremony she had led previously. As she was about to put pen to paper, the attorney general, Jack Gallagher, ascended the stairs and announced that he was shutting her down. He told her there would be no approval of gay marriages in Harrisburg.\n\n\nDorian was sure it was a mistake, positive that the official wouldn't want to set off a demonstration. She vowed that she wouldn't go quietly, even when Gallagher accused her of violating Pennsylvania law. As Dorian defiantly insisted that she would file her certificate, the attorney general informed her that she would go to jail and she would wish that Viki was the mayor instead.\n\n\nAs Dorian and the attorney general began to debate the issue, the crowd began to chant. Dorian, defying the order, signed her marriage license certificate. Chuckling, she announced that she needed a mayor to sign it next. Threatening her with arrest, the attorney general urged her not to make a scene. He pointed to a uniformed Oliver standing nearby. \n\n\nMimicking the man, Dorian produced her mayoral stamp and slammed it onto the certificate emphatically. She announced that there was an official and first legal same sex marriage in Llanview. She waved her certificate. Gallagher ordered Oliver to arrest her. \"What if I don't?\" Oliver responded.\n\n\nGallagher walked towards Oliver and told him to arrest Dorian. Oliver refused, acknowledging that some laws needed to be broken. He praised Dorian for trying to set things right. He ripped off his badge and extended it towards the attorney general. Dorian advised Oliver to keep the badge and asked him to arrest her instead. She promised to go proudly and asked for Oliver to handcuff her. She refused to allow him to lose his job, she told him.\n\n\nAs Oliver began to argue with Dorian, Amelia stepped up and urged him to listen to the mayor, because Dorian knew what she was doing. Dorian assured Langston and Starr that she would be fine and would get lots of attention. She insisted that they attend the local concert later in the day like they had planned. She made sure that Markko continued his filming of her. Dorian was certain that jail would be the safest place in town.\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a continued to exchange words from their jail cells in Seattle. Todd, vowing to take Danielle away from T\u00e9a, also threatened to change the teen's name. Elijah arrived and broke the news that Danielle was missing from the protective custody services. A panicked T\u00e9a worried that Ross had taken her, since he had been missing from his cell for quite a while. She thought he had been released. As her alarm escalated, Ross was returned to his cell and wondered why T\u00e9a was so upset. She reluctantly told him about Danielle running away.\n\n\nAs the guard unlocked Ross's cell, Ross grabbed the guard's gun and pushed the officer down. He urged Todd to grab the guard's radio and accompany him. Todd handed him the radio but refused to leave his cell. As Ross waved the gun around, pointing at Todd, then T\u00e9a, he demanded that Todd admit that Danielle belonged to Ross. He wanted to know that he was the father that counted. Todd refused, and dared Ross to shoot him because he was the real dad, not Ross. Giving up, Ross turned and fled, and Todd and T\u00e9a yelled for the guards.\n\n\nDanielle, making her way safely to Matthew's hospital room, wanted Matthew to help her devise a plan for escape. Destiny, annoyed that Danielle had returned to Matthew's life, was friendly towards the girl, though anyone who knew her could see through to her true feelings. She was dismayed when Danielle asked her to stand guard outside of Matthew's room again. Just as she opened the door to head to the hallway, Destiny gasped. Rachel and Greg had just emerged from the elevator and were sharing a kiss in front of Matthew's room.\n\n\n\"Hey guys, you just lost your escape route,\" Destiny announced as she turned and headed back into the hospital room. She and Matthew were sitting quietly when Rachel and Greg arrived. Rachel received a phone call from Elijah shortly after, and learned that Danielle was missing. Relaying the information, she wondered if either Matthew or Destiny had seen her. Both of the teens shook their heads as Danielle lay motionless under the bed.\n\n\nRachel was forceful in her exclamation that Danielle needed to be located. She explained that Ross had injured T\u00e9a and it was uncertain what he might do next. She didn't know if Daneille might be in danger. As she continued to stress the importance of locating Danielle, Destiny gave a little push on the button on the side of the hospital bed. Yelling, Danielle scrambled out as the bed began to move.\n\n\nRachel was flabbergasted that Matthew had lied to her about not seeing Danielle, and Greg was also perturbed at Destiny. Destiny admitted to pushing the button on the bed and said she wanted her brother to let her off the hook. Matthew and Danielle were peeved at Destiny's act but Destiny defended herself. She didn't want Danielle to be in danger.\n\n\nAs darkness fell, Viki found Natalie still sitting next to Jared's coffin. Natalie acknowledged that she couldn't walk away by herself and didn't want to be alone. The women reminisced about the previous Christmas and the gifts that Natalie and Jared had exchanged. Natalie had the framed photo of the ranch that she had given Jared, sitting by the gravesite. They laughed about Jared's gift of socks to Natalie and the ring he had eventually given her.\n\n\nWhile she knew it was difficult, Viki asked that Natalie try to put Mitch out of her mind. A distraught Natalie didn't think that it was possible, given the evil deeds that Mitch had committed. Not only had he killed Jared but he had physically removed Jared's body from his coffin. She wondered if he had just dumped Jared's body on the floor. Raging, she confessed that she just wanted to strangle Mitch.\n\n\nViki knew that everyone wanted to pay Mitch back but she thought that if he knew someone wanted to get even with him, he would take control of their life. She wanted Natalie to move on, despite Mitch. Natalie asked about Charlie, and Viki confided that Charlie needed some extra A.A. meetings, since he was feeling challenged. Natalie thought that something else was wrong. Viki informed her that Charlie had attempted to kill Mitch in Napa and had almost succeeded. He was struggling and felt responsible for Jared's death. Natalie understood Charlie's reactions and wondered how he would survive.\n\n\nViki decided that it was time for her to go inside, but Natalie was unable to leave Jared. Viki gently explained that Jared was not there, but was in Natalie's heart, her memories, in Texas, and even in the box with her ring and socks. The women departed the cemetery.\n\n\nMitch stopped his joyful gospel singing when Charlie approached the jail cell, but urged his brother to sing along. \"I'm not your brother,\" Charlie replied. Mitch wondered if Charlie was there to \"finish him off.\" Charlie assured Mitch that as long as Mitch remained in the jail cell, he would be safe. Charlie insisted that he was a different man from the one he used to be. Mitch thought otherwise, claiming that people didn't change. He pointed out that the funeral service had been beautiful from what he'd heard from within the coffin. He had wanted to share the moment, Mitch added. He denied killing Jared, repeating his previous claim that it had been Charlie who had done the killing.\n\n\nIt was apparent that Mitch only wanted to torment Charlie as he continued to taunt him. He noted that Jared had died years before, when Charlie had killed Jared's step-father. Charlie informed Mitch that he was crazy and twisted things around. Mitch wondered who Charlie was actually angry with.\n\n\nMitch explained that he was there to take care of his family and thought that Charlie should be looking after his own family instead of visiting Mitch. He knew that Charlie had lied to Viki and had told her he was headed to an A.A. meeting instead of the jail. Mitch wondered where Viki was, and Charlie informed him sarcastically that Viki had no need to see Mitch and that Mitch needed to stay away from her. \"I know, or you'll kill me,\" Mitch retorted.\n\n\nWhile Charlie claimed that he was there looking for answers, Mitch thought that Charlie really wanted to \"cut him down to size.\" He asked Charlie if he wanted to drink. Charlie replied with a resounding \"No!\" Mocking, Mitch responded that he would want a drink if he was in Charlie's shoes, feeling guilty like Charlie was because he hadn't been there for Jared. He added that Jared had no tools to make a useful life for himself because of Charlie. He ended up lying, cheating, and killing, just like Charlie.\n\n\nMitch called Charlie a drunk and told him it was the hand that God had dealt him. He said that nothing changed that. Charlie maintained that he was a recovered alcoholic. Mitch dug in further, relating that he had received the ugly story of Charlie's life and his role as a father from Pamela Stuart. \n\n\nThough Charlie assured him that he had made amends with Jared, Mitch attacked that as one of the steps of the twelve step program that addicts followed. He accused Charlie of having to convince himself that he was good enough to erase his past. \"All you can see is little Jared, the poor little boy you abandoned,\" Mitch taunted. He assured Charlie there was only one way to drown that sentiment out and he urged him to reach for the bottle hidden in his pocket. He wouldn't judge him.\n\n\nCharlie refused to give Mitch the satisfaction and demanded answers again, pointing out that the man had shot Jared for no reason. Mitch began to preach, stating that God had decided it was Jared's time and that it was because Charlie had gone looking for Jared in the first place. Charlie was selfish because Jared was doing fine until Charlie showed up. Charlie should have stayed in Texas, Mitch concluded.\n\n\nOnce Charlie had gone, Mitch resumed his singing. Oliver led Dorian in and the two chatted casually. Oliver was appreciative of Dorian's efforts. Suddenly, Mitch and Dorian saw each other. Mitch was quite pleased to see Dorian, who looked rather drawn. She informed her fellow prisoner that she was the mayor.\n\n\nAt the park, a group of anti-gay thugs accosted Nick and Amelia.\n\n\nCharlie headed to his son's gravesite and replayed the conversation with Mitch in his mind. Slowly, he withdrew the bottle of vodka from his pocket and after some deliberation, began to drink.\n\n\nAdditional prison guards arrived and they quickly initiated a search for Ross after learning that he had a gun. Elijah, who had returned to the cells with the guards, received a phone call from Rachel. Learning that Danielle was safely with her at the hospital, he relayed the information to a relieved T\u00e9a and Todd. Ross stood outside of Matthew's hospital room and listened to Rachel's end of the conversation.\n\n\n",
