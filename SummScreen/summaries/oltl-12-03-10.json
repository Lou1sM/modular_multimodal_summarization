Viki remarked that Nora had dropped by and then snarled, \"Echo's not here...thank goodness.\"  Charlie set down a toolbox and informed Viki that Echo wanted to clean up some of the tools to give to Shane for Christmas.  Charlie was excited that he would be able to work on a project with Shane.  Viki saw that Charlie was happy because he could spend time with his grandson.\n\n\nViki told Charlie that she would be able to accept Echo more, once Echo no longer lived in Llanfair.  Charlie thanked Viki, because she was \"so understanding.\"  When Charlie wondered about the mystery surrounding Joey's lunch, Viki suspected that Joey had a new love.  Charlie thanked Viki again due to all of the things that had happened, and Viki requested that they \"spend the rest of the day not thinking about things.\"  Viki and Charlie left to meet with Joey for lunch.\n\n\nSitting with Echo in the Palace restaurant, Dorian suspected that Charlie was not Rex's father, and that Clint was.  However, Joey interrupted them, before Echo could reply.  After Joey greeted Dorian, Echo realized that Joey was Viki's son, and that he was the reason that Echo had been forced to move to a smaller guest room at Llanfair.  Joey commented, \"So, you're the woman making my mom and Charlie miserable.\"\n\n\nEcho insisted to Joey that Viki was \"a fabulous woman.\"  When Joey informed Dorian that he was having lunch with his mom and dad, Dorian found it interesting that Clint and Viki would be arriving at the Palace.  Joey announced that he had to leave but reminded Echo that he would see her back at the house.\n\n\nAs a sloshed Echo sloppily remarked on how good-looking Joey was, Dorian pointed out, as she continued to pour Echo drinks, that Rex was nice-looking also.  Dorian reminded her that Echo had wanted Rex to get to know his father.  Echo recognized that Charlie was a kind man, who deserved to have a son.  Charlie and Viki entered the restaurant before Echo could continue.\n\n\nDorian announced that she knew that Charlie and Viki were meeting with Joey.  Viki immediately realized that Echo was drunk and tried to walk away, but Charlie insisted on taking Echo home.  Once Charlie helped Echo out, Viki blamed Dorian for getting Echo drunk.  However, Dorian insisted that she had done it to keep \"that harlot\" away from Viki's husband.  Viki sneered and said, \"What a great plan.  See how well it's working.\"\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint told Inez that Bo and Nora had fought, but Inez believed that they had probably already made up.  However, Clint had \"a feeling\" that Bo and Nora would not immediately get back together.  When Clint demanded that Inez live up to her end of the bargain, Inez wanted to know what had happened to Eddie.\n\n\nClint informed Inez that Eddie was \"taking care of some business,\" and that Eddie would then \"be gone.\"  Clint declared, \"I found a way to use Eddie's talents to help a lot of people.\"  When Clint tried to hand Inez money to buy \"something sexy,\" she slapped his hand away.  Clint exclaimed that Inez should comfort Bo, because Bo was \"having a very bad day.\"\n\n\nOutside, as Nora reached for her cell phone, Eddie placed a cloth over her mouth.  When Nora woke up, she found herself tied to a chair in a hotel room, as Eddie pointed a gun at her.  Nora wondered why Eddie was holding her and speculated that it has been because of Eddie's arrest.  However, Eddie claimed that he did not hold grudges and then said, \"Ask my boys.\"\n\n\nWhen Nora demanded that Eddie \"let her go immediately,\" Eddie taped her mouth shut.  Eddie then rushed out of the room to run an errand.  Nora tried to escape her binds and, when that failed, hopped her chair across the room.\n\n\nAfter Inez had left the Buchanan mansion, Eddie arrived and claimed to Clint that he had needed to shut Nora up but also insisted that he had not harmed her.  When Eddie requested his money, Clint exclaimed that Eddie would receive it, when the job was done.  Clint explained, \"In one hour, after I'm at the Palace, and I'm there in front of all these witnesses, who can testify that I had nothing to do with it....\"  Eddie finished with \"That's when I hit this button,\" as he lifted up a remote.\n\n\nBack at the Palace, Dorian announced to Viki that her plan had been to get Echo to confess that Charlie was not Rex's father.  Dorian spotted Clint, who had just walked in, before she could say anything else.  After Clint asked about Charlie, Dorian asked about Inez.  Clint revealed that he and Inez had broken up.  Once Clint left, Viki begged Dorian to \"leave this thing with Charlie and Echo alone.\"  Dorian insisted, \"Someday you're going to thank me,\" as she walked away from the table.\n\n\nWhen Charlie escorted Echo into Llanfair and voiced that Echo had a problem, Echo replied that she was not the alcoholic.  Echo immediately regretted her comment and apologized.  Charlie admitted that Echo's drinking had reminded him of unhappier times, when he had been miserable, but Echo only remembered that Charlie had been a happy drunk.\n\n\nWhen Charlie asked what Dorian had been \"up to,\" Echo claimed that Dorian and Echo had been drinking, because of Charlie.  Charlie cried, \"You're drinking because of me?\"  Echo stuttered, \"Uh...not like you made me do it.  It's just...I, you're just such a wonderful man, and I just...I feel....\"  Echo kissed Charlie, as Dorian peered in through the patio door window.\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Bo left Nora a message on her cell phone and stated that he had been an idiot to say what he had said and pleaded with Nora to call him back.  At a table in the caf\u00e9, Marty watched as John began to open the present that she had given him.  Bo walked up to the table and asked John and Marty if he was interrupting them.\n\n\nAfter Bo joined the table, he asked them about Cole.  John announced that he had moved Cole to another facility for Cole's safety.  Bo was amazed that John had the pull to move Cole and insisted the Cole was lucky to have John \"watching his back.\"  Once Bo had left the table, John reached for the gift.  Marty cried, \"Wait.\"\n\n\nMarty told John that Cole should be the one to give John a gift.  John pouted, \"Now I feel like this kid at Christmas, who's got all these presents under the tree, but he's not allowed to open any of them.\"  Marty insisted that John was a big boy, and that he could wait.  When John remarked that he could probably wait until Christmas, Marty commented, \"We'll see.\"\n\n\nAt another table in the caf\u00e9, Rex announced to Gigi that Todd had hired him to watch Marty.  Rex claimed that he had to find proof for Starr that Marty was \"a nuisance.\"  Gigi informed Rex that Shane was learning how to do research papers in school and remembered that the previous year, Rex and Gigi were very thankful that Shane was alive.  Gigi then mentioned that Marty had been acting strangely lately, and that Marty blamed Natalie, because Cole was in prison.  Rex reflected, \"Marty's a shrink.  If anybody should have a handle of things....\"\n\n\nRex informed Gigi that Todd had wanted Rex to check out Eddie Ford also.  Bo overheard the remark and asked to speak to Rex alone.  Bo revealed that Eddie had \"walked out of an assault charge.\"  Bo insisted that he also wanted Rex to find out about Eddie.  Bo claimed that he was curious about how Eddie could afford a hot-shot attorney, who had gotten him out of the assault charges.  Rex then returned to the table with Gigi.\n\n\nBo called the police station and asked if Nora had left any messages for him there.  When he was told that there were none, he hung up his phone.  Inez found Bo in the caf\u00e9.  Bo asked Inez if she had seen Nora at the office.  Inez reminded Bo that she had taken the morning off.\n\n\nAs John escorted Marty to the door of the caf\u00e9, Rex took Marty's glove from her coat pocket, when she walked by his table.  Rex then chased after Marty outside of the caf\u00e9 and yelled at her.  Marty dropped the gift that she had intended to give to John, and Rex picked it up.  Rex weighed the gift and stated, \"Hmm...it feels empty.  What've you got in here?\"\n\n\nMarty claimed that the gift was an early Christmas present, and Rex handed Marty her glove.  After Marty walked off, Rex told Gigi, who had followed him, that he found it suspicious, since the gift had felt empty.  Gigi wondered if Marty had something to hide.\n\n\nBo joined John at another table in the caf\u00e9 and asked if John had seen Nora.  Bo regretted to John that he had said something to Nora that had upset her.  John insisted that Bo \"let things cool off,\" so it would \"blow over.\"  John believed that it would take more than just one fight to tear Bo and Nora apart.  At another table, Inez listened to the conversation, as she pretended to powder her nose.\n\n\nAs Nora continued to hop her chair across the hotel room, Eddie swung open the door and declared, \"Sounds like you've got a spring in your step.\"  Eddie then cautioned Nora to speak in an inside voice and ripped the tape from her face.  When Nora screamed out in pain, Eddie insisted that it would hurt less, if it was done fast.  Nora insisted that she knew that Eddie needed something, and that she wanted to help him.\n\n\nWhen Nora asked why Eddie had taken her phone, Eddie told her to \"just wait.\"  After Nora claimed that Eddie would need a plan, because Bo would search for her, Eddie stated that he already had a plan.  Eddie revealed that Bo would no longer be looking for Nora.\n\n\nIn the caf\u00e9, John left the table to answer his phone, and Inez joined Bo.  Inez noticed that Bo looked upset and offered, \"You've been a really good friend to me.  Let me return the favor.\"  Bo received a text message from Nora's phone, \"I'm still furious over what you said last night.  I honestly don't know if I can ever forgive you.\"  Inez asked Bo if everything was okay.\n\n\nIn the Palace restaurant, Kelly and Aubrey discussed Aubrey's new love and decided to visit Aubrey's Palace hotel room, so that Aubrey could change clothes.  Once they were in her room, Kelly and Aubrey realized that they had both attended the same school in Paris.  Kelly cried out, \"Wow, what a small world.  I can't believe how much we have in common.\"\n\n\nAs Aubrey pranced in front of Kelly in a different gown, Kelly requested that Aubrey twirl in her dress.  After she gave Aubrey her approval, Kelly worried over her own appearance.  When Aubrey stated her belief that the guy was already into her, Kelly replied, \"Yeah, I think I felt something, you know, when he Heimliched me.  I don't know.  It might be putting too much stress into this lunch, but I just, I want to look my best.\"\n\n\nAubrey offered Kelly a dress, because Aubrey claimed that she was \"a sucker for a love story,\" and Kelly left the room to try it on.  Aubrey answered the knock on her door and found Joey, who thought she looked terrific.  Aubrey went to the bedroom and told Kelly to stay as along as she liked in the room to prepare.  Aubrey and Joey left for lunch.\n\n\nAt a Palace table, Clint regretted the way that he had treated Viki the last time Echo had lived in Llanview.  Clint insisted that Viki not let Echo hurt her again.  Joey walked into the restaurant with Aubrey and introduced her to his parents.\n\n\nClint asked, \"So, Joey, is this your new girlfriend?\"  Joey responded, \"No, Aubrey's not my girlfriend.\"\n\n\nStill in Aubrey's room, Kelly spritzed spray into her hair and munched on a strawberry.  Kelly picked up Aubrey's cell phone and read the text, \"I just left you in the room, but I miss you already.  Love J.\"  Kelly remarked, \"Hmm...one more thing we have in common.  Aubrey and I both love men, whose names begin with J.  All right, Joey, ready or not....\" Kelly snapped her fingers and finished, \"Here I come.\"\n\n\nJoey announced to Clint and Viki in the Palace, \"Mom, Dad, Aubrey is the woman that I'm going to marry.\" \n\n\n",
