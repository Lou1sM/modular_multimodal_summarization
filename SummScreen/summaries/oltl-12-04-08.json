Dorian gave her a pep talk, ordering her to \"Cramer up!\" and introduce herself to Marty. Finally getting up her courage, Blair walked over to the couple's table and did just that. After an uncomfortable but short silence, Marty directed a difficult question toward Blair, asking if they were really mortal enemies as Todd had suggested they were. As Blair acknowledged that they had experienced some ongoing problems, John quickly maintained that it was all lies. Blair added that their problems had all been due to Todd but that she was finally free of him. Marty hastily declared that she was not free, since she was in love with him. She stated that the affair between John and Blair, while Blair was still married, was also the cause of much angst. \n\n\nAs Marty demanded to know the truth, Blair attempted to explain that Todd had always only cared about himself and had lied to her many times, too. She pointed out their similarities with the man, reminding Marty that Blair had fallen in love with Todd, as well. With anger rising in her voice, Marty reminded Blair that Todd hadn't raped Blair as he had Marty. Dorian headed to the back of the diner to spend time with Moe, engaging in drowning her sorrows in good food. She invited him to a dinner party and was appalled to learn that he was heading back to Texas. She assured him that he was wasting his talents there. \n\n\nAs John tried to make himself invisible, Blair agreed that circumstances were not the same. She mentioned how she herself had been at Todd's place twice and how John had searched endlessly for Marty. Deciding it was time to end the conversation, Blair mentioned that she had to leave, and John asked if he could call her. Marty wasn't finished, though. She challenged Blair, suggesting that Blair really did still hate her and wasn't interested in her welfare at all. Marty felt that Blair only wanted to know what was going on between Marty and John, worried that her own relationship with John could be in jeopardy. Blair repeated that she and John had not had an affair while she was married to Todd. Dorian joined the group. Not one to mince words, she turned to John and asked, \"What is going on with you and Marty?\" \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Tess continued her session with Dr. Levin and insisted that Jessica was given the wrong baby. She recalled that when the baby was born, she looked exactly like Nash, but Jessica bailed and didn't see the baby. She wanted to know what happened to her real baby, because the one they had was not the right one. The doctor, not taking Tess seriously, felt that she missed Nash and was merely extending that to the newborn. As Tess carried on, she came close to the doctor, and, reaching into his pocket, lifted his keys. She bolted for the door, unlocked it, and ran into the hallway-right into a very confused Brody, who was more than perplexed when she flirted and asked him who he was. Reminding her that they had met previously, he listened to her whispered pleas for help. \"They took my kid. Do you have any idea what that feels like,\" she asked him. \n\n\nDr. Levin, with an orderly standing nearby, waited patiently for Tess to return to his office. As she told Brody she'd make it worth his while, the doctor asked to speak to Bess again. As everyone looked on, Bess returned and extended her apologies to Brody, while assuring the doctor that Jessica indeed had the correct baby. The doctor asked for Jessica to return and, when she did, she wondered why Brody was there. She was informed that both Tess and Bess had put in appearances and that Tess had insisted the baby Jessica had was not hers. Dr. Levin promised to get to the bottom of it. Finished with Jessica's session, Dr. Levin summoned Brody into his office for the young man's own scheduled appointment. Brody apologized for showing up early, but he had been anxious to get started so that he could leave St. Anne's as soon as possiible. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Viki embraced Starr and proudly pointed out her new granddaughter in the nursery. Starr explained the results of Hope's autopsy and how she thought the baby's death was her fault. Instead, she learned that it was the doctor's error. Nearby, Todd's guard took off after the gunshot, leaving his prisoner alone. Nora made her way in the direction of the sound and found herself at Dr. Joplin's office. She walked in and screamed for help. Dr. Joplin was dead of a gunshot wound to the head. \n\n\nReassuring her niece, Viki was tongue-tied when Starr suddenly asked why Todd always did what he did. She added that something was seriously wrong with her father, and wondered why he was still living while Hope was dead. While Starr vowed to say goodbye to her baby at the funeral, she strongly felt that it was Todd who needed to be buried instead, because he was bad. Viki didn't think Starr's thoughts were appropriate. As they talked, Todd dressed himself in his guard's absence, planning a quick escape from the hospital. In Dr. Joplin's office, Antonio wondered what Nora was doing there, as the doctor was pronounced dead. It was noted that Starr was Joplin's last appointment of the day and the baby's autopsy report was on the desk. He confirmed the results of the meeting with Michael. Nora mentioned that she had a meeting with Todd when she had heard the shot and changed direction. \n\n\nInsisting that she didn't want to be like Todd, Starr remembered how bad she was when she was young. Perhaps that was why Hope died, she stated adamantly. She wondered if she had been bad because she wanted her dad to love her. He had never loved anyone, especially her, she continued. Viki ordered her to stop, and insisted that Starr was wrong and that Todd loved her. She reminded Starr of how Todd had met his daughter in Viki's attic. She admitted that she couldn't answer Starr's questions regarding Todd's actions, but she knew that Starr would be able to go on, due to all of the love in her heart. As Todd pondered his next move, a staff person arrived at his room with magazines. He learned that Dr. Joplin had committed suicide. Antonio grew angrier when he learned that Todd had been left alone. \n\n\nSneaking out of his room, Todd didn't get very far before Antonio and Nora caught him. \"You going someplace?\" Nora asked him. Innocently, Todd indicated that he got dressed when he heard the shot. Nora cast doubts on his actions and indicated that he might have even been involved in the shooting. Noting that Todd had dressed himself was all that Nora needed to move him out of the hospital. As they left, they came face-to-face with Starr and Viki. Starr, holding baby Chloe and talking to her, quickly handed the baby back to her aunt and ran off. \n\n\nAs Rex, Gigi, and Shane arrived at the beauty salon for Shane's haircut, the boy steadfastly refused to pose for the family's Christmas card. Rex reluctantly agreed to cancel their photo session. Walking into the salon, he saw Roxy working on Noelle's hair. Mortified, Noelle was attempting to explain that the wild hair was not what she wanted. Roxy wanted Rex to give his opinion but he ably deflected. Outside, Shane tried to explain his reasons for not wanting the family to pose for their card. It had nothing to do with his feelings for Rex, he told his mom, but for Brody. He felt bad for Brody and didn't want him to see the card and think that Shane didn't care about him any longer. Gigi assured her son that it was okay to like both Rex and Brody, and that Brody knew how Shane felt about him. Gigi suggested that Shane use some of her photos and make his own card for Brody. Shane readily agreed and changed his mind on the Balsom family portrait, though he still refused the haircut. \n\n\nMoe arrived and asked if Noelle's hair was combed with an eggbeater. He announced that they were not returning to Texas.\n\n\n",
