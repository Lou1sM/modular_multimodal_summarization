After breathing a sigh of relief, T\u00e9a told Rachel that Ross had escaped from jail with a gun and was searching for Danielle.  Rachel promised to protect Danielle from Ross until T\u00e9a was released from jail.   Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone, an armed Ross stood outside of Matthew's hospital room and eavesdropped on Rachel's conversation with T\u00e9a.\n\n\nBack at the jail, while Elijah made every effort to have the charges against both T\u00e9a and Todd dropped, Todd lashed out at T\u00e9a.  Todd wondered if Ross was capable of harming Danielle, but T\u00e9a assured Todd that Ross loved the teen and would never hurt her.  Glaring at T\u00e9a, Todd reminded T\u00e9a that Ross tried to strangle her.\n\n\nMoments later, a guard appeared and related that Ross had been spotted near the hotel where T\u00e9a and Danielle had been staying.  Both T\u00e9a and Todd immediately realized that Ross knew that Danielle was across the street at the hospital with Matthew.\n\n\nAvoiding telling Danielle that Ross had escaped, Rachel announced that she and Greg would be standing guard outside of Matthew's room, and warned Danielle to stay put.  Outside the room, Rachel told Greg the news about Ross's escape with a loaded gun.  While Greg attempted to gather the details, Ross appeared and placed the gun into Rachel's back.  Ross threatened to kill Rachel if Greg interfered.    Back inside the room, Danielle criticized Destiny for exposing her whereabouts to Rachel.  Displaying no guilt, Destiny suggested that Danielle accept her fate.\n\n\nPushing Greg and Rachel away from Matthew's hospital room door,    Ross pointed the gun at them and declared that he wasn't leaving the hospital without his daughter.  Before Greg could make a move, Ross barged inside Matthew's room and locked the door.   Danielle, Matthew, and Destiny were stunned when Ross announced that he had escaped and wanted to take Danielle with him.   Ross told Danielle that he had escaped because it was the only way he could be reunited with her.   Although nervous about the lengths that Ross had taken to find her, Danielle appeared pleased to see him and gave Ross a hug.\n\n\nOut in the hall, while Rachel feared that Ross might harm Matthew or Destiny, Greg phoned the police and related the scene that had taken place.   Moments later, the police arrived, along with T\u00e9a, Todd, and Elijah.  While the authorities attempted to negotiate with Ross, T\u00e9a promised to allow Ross to visit with Danielle and stated that she knew  Ross would never hurt Danielle.  \n\n\nSeconds later, holding a gun to Destiny, Ross appeared and declared, \"I would never hurt Dani, but I don't give a damn about this kid!.\"  Pulling Danielle alongside him, too,  Ross guided both Destiny and Danielle to the elevator.  Greg watched helplessly as Ross held his sister at gunpoint.   Once inside the elevator, Ross pushed Destiny out and the elevator doors closed.\n\n\nWhen Rachel rushed inside Matthew's room to check on him, an upset Matthew blamed himself for being unable to help his friends.\n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, Starr, Cole, Langston, and Matthew awaited the arrival of the All-American Rejects, who were scheduled to perform at the club later that night.   Nearby, Stacy and Kim also waited for the concert to start.  Stacy panicked when she observed Oliver enter the club.  Stacy wasn't sure if she would be able to continue to hide the fact that Oliver was the father of her unborn child.  Directing Stacy's attention toward Oliver and Kyle, Kim stressed that the men made a cute couple, and reminded Stacy that Schuyler wouldn't reveal that she wasn't as far along in her pregnancy as everyone thought.   While Stacy continued to worry, Kim was thrilled about starting her first day of work at Buchanan Enterprises.  Kim couldn't wait to charm Clint.\n\n\nAt a nearby table, Oliver and Kyle kissed and expressed the excitement over finally having their first date.   The men embraced and proclaimed their love for each other.\n\n\nAt Rodi's, Shane enjoyed dinner with Rex and Gigi.  Shane wondered if Roxy would spend Christmas with the family, but Rex didn't respond.  Instead, Rex informed his son that Mitch Laurence was in Llanview.  Shane was noticeably upset to learn that his grandfather was in town, but Rex and Gigi assured Shane that Mitch was in jail and would never be released.\n\n\nWhile Rex and Gigi attempted to convince Shane that Mitch wouldn't cause them any harm, Schuyler approached the family.  Upon learning that Schuyler had showed up at the cottage to speak with him, Rex questioned the reason for the visit.  When Rex snapped at Schuyler, Gigi quickly related that Schuyler wanted to offer his condolences over the loss of Jared.  Realizing that Rex was annoyed by his presence, Schuyler rushed off.   Shane was pleased when Rex invited him to the concert at Ultraviolet.  Nearby, Schuyler watched sadly as Rex and Gigi kissed goodbye.\n\n\nGigi approached Schuyler and apologized for Rex's rude behavior.   After thanking him for convincing Stacy and Kim to remain quiet about their innocent night together, Gigi asked Schuyler exactly how he had managed it.  A nervous Schuyler responded, \"We made an agreement!\"\n\n\nWhen Shane and Rex arrived at Ultraviolet, Shane insulted Stacy and demanded that his father remove her from the club.  Pulling Shane aside, Rex reminded his son that Stacy would soon give birth to either Shane's brother or sister.  Suggesting that Shane's harsh words could effect the unborn child, Rex asked Shane to be polite to Stacy.  Concerned that his unborn sibling might have heard his harsh words, Shane approached Stacy.  Apologizing to the baby, Shane attempted to place his hands on Stacy's stomach, but she quickly pushed him away.  Stacy and Kim scolded Shane about touching a pregnant woman's stomach and shooed him off.  Afterward, the women discussed that Rex might also get the urge to feel the baby.  Stressing that she couldn't fool everyone with the padding forever, Stacy stated that they needed a plan.\n\n\nIn the Llanview jail, while Dorian was horrified to see Mitch, he was thrilled to have company.  As they sat in adjoining cells, Mitch revealed that he had knowledge of what had taken place in Dorian's life since they had last met.   Attempting to upset Dorian, Mitch made subtle threats regarding Blair, Starr, and Langston.  When Mitch reminded Dorian of his relationship with Cassie, an irate Dorian exploded and threaded to kill Mitch.\n\n\nAt Angel Square Park, Nick and Amelia were accosted by a group of anti-gay thugs.  While Nick pleaded with Amelia to retreat in the opposite direction, she lashed out at the men for their homophobic attitude.  Once Nick finally persuaded Amelia to walk away, the bigots agreed that they needed to teach Nick a lesson.\n\n\nLater, Nick and Amelia arrived at Rodi's for dinner.  As they discussed Dorian's support of their cause, the thugs from the park approached them and began taunting Nick and Amelia about their sexuality.  Observing the disturbance, Gigi stepped forward and ordered the men to leave the establishment.  When one the men attempted to strike Gigi, Schuyler pushed her out of the way.  \n\n\nAs Schuyler instructed the men to disperse, one of the men sucker punched Schuler and he fell to the floor.  Once the thugs had left, Gigi and Schuyler offered to call the police, but Nick and Amelia begged them not to.   Later, Gigi thanked Schuyler for protecting her from the street thugs.  Touched that he had taken a punch for her, Gigi tended to Schuyler's wounds.\n\n\nAfter finishing their meal, Nick offered to give Amelia a ride home, but she declined and related that she wanted to pay Dorian a visit at the jail.  Once Amelia had departed, Nick walked toward his car and the same group of antagonizers approached him again.\n\n\nWhile the All-American Rejects performed at Ultraviolet, a jealous Stacy watched Rex and Shane share a tender moment.  As Kyle and Oliver enjoyed the concert, a bloodied Nick lay motionless on the ground outside of Rodi's.\n\n \n\n\n",
