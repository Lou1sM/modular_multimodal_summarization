    "soap_central": "\nHasta La Vista, Bonjour\n\n\nCristian and Vanessa paid Nora a visit at the police station and asked for advice on how to prevent Vanessa from being deported. Preoccupied with ensuring that Todd was charged and processed quickly, Nora's only advice was to present a compelling argument stating why Vanessa needed asylum. Unable to provide them with much hope, Nora ended the conversation when she noticed a shackled Todd being escorted into the station. Cris promised Vanessa that he would fight to keep her and Lola from being deported. \n\n\nNora approached Todd and advised him of his rights. When Todd questioned Nora about Marty's physical and mental health, Nora responded by reminding Todd of the time Margaret held him captive and lied to him about his family. After Todd was processed, Nora accompanied him to his cell. A defeated Todd asked Nora if she was thrilled that he was finally behind bars. With a look of regret, Nora informed Todd that she took very little pleasure in his imprisonment because the circumstances had cost Marty and Cole dearly. A relentless Todd maintained that he loved Marty and that she would never testify against him. Fed up with Todd's behavior, Nora left him alone to his own devices. Todd mumbled to himself, \"She loves me!\" \n\n\nAt the diner, Marty accused Blair of seeking information about her because they both had been involved with John. As John looked on, Blair tried to convince Marty that she didn't harness any ill will against her, but Marty remained unconvinced and continued to berate Blair about her feelings for John. Dorian interrupted Marty's outburst, and questioned John about his intentions towards both Blair and Marty. Seizing the opportunity to gather information, Dorian inquired about Marty's feelings for John and wondered if she had any intentions of resuming their relationship. After learning of Dorian's identity, Marty lashed out at her and accused Dorian of seeking information out of concern for Blair. Humiliated, both John and Blair attempted to quiet Dorian, to no avail. While Dorian continued to harass her, Marty stood her ground and refused to be intimidated. \n\n\nIgnoring Blair's pleas to leave, Dorian asked if Marty had regained her memory. Unable to contain herself any longer, Marty exploded. Near tears, Marty stated that the only memories that she had were of Todd. Consumed with guilt, Marty said that she had fallen in love with Todd. She expressed her regret that feelings of Todd were all that she had left, and she declared revenge against him. Embarrassed, Blair dragged Dorian out of the diner. \n\n\nLangston, Markko, and Cole arrived at La Boulaie and were surprised to find a troubled Lola. As Addie listened, Lola informed the teens that she would be leaving Llanview because she and Vanessa were being deported. When Langston questioned if the government could deport Lola, Addie mentioned that the government was taking an active stand in regards to immigration. Langton wondered how Addie would have knowledge of immigration laws. To everyone's surprise, Addie announced that she had plans to run for mayor in the year 2010 and that immigration reform would be the centerpiece of her campaign. Langston, Markko, and Cole promised to stand by Lola and prevent the deportation. \n\n\nMoments later, Dorian and Blair arrived home. Cole overheard Blair scolding Dorian about her harassment of Marty. After demanding to know what Dorian had done to his mother, Cole ran off to check on her. Upon learning that Lola and Vanessa were facing deportation, Dorian insisted on assigning her team of lawyers to the case and assured the teens that Lola would remain in Llanview. Overjoyed by Dorian's act of kindness, the teens thanked her, and Lola left to inform Vanessa and Cris of the good news. Afterward, Blair accused Dorian of being controlling and pleaded with her to apologize to Marty. Insisting that she had acted in Blair's best interest, Dorian refused to apologize. \n\n\nAlone with John, Marty told him that she needed time to herself. John complied and left the diner without her. Marty sat alone in the diner and wept. Cole was stunned to find his mother in tears. When Cole offered to take her home, Marty insisted on visiting her grave. \n\n\nAt the cemetery, Marty found the letter that Cole had written to her on the anniversary of her apparent death. Marty was touched by Cole's words, but her thoughts soon turned to Todd. When Cole noticed that his mother had become distracted, he wondered why. Refusing to ruin the moment with memories of Todd, Marty changed the subject. Cole offered to give Marty time alone to read his letter. Alone, Marty read the letter but her thoughts again turned to Todd. Marty promised to make Todd suffer a fate worse than her own. \n\n\nNora retuned upstairs and discovered John attempting to retrieve information involving Todd. Advising John that Todd would be punished according to the law, Nora warned him to allow Todd his day in court. Expressing little faith in the justice system, John told Nora that Marty was having a difficult time adjusting to her new life as a result of her involvement with Todd. Convinced that Marty was deeply troubled, John vowed to make Todd pay for hurting her. Against her better judgment, Nora allowed John to visit Todd in lockup. \n\n\nWhile Cris consoled Vanessa and attempted to convince her that they would find a way to keep her in the country, Lola arrived with the good news. Although relieved that Dorian had offered her assistance, Cris reminded Vanessa that Dorian's lawyers would have to act quickly in order to prevent the deportation. \n\n\nTodd was surprised when John confronted him in lockup. When Todd continued to state that he loved Marty, John could barely contain himself. Revealing a note he claimed that Marty had written, John told Todd that she had committed suicide due to Todd's actions. Devastated, Todd listened as John recited Mary's \"suicide\" letter. John claimed that Marty blamed Todd for everything that had happened to her. Todd begged John for answers, but John ignored his request. Walking away, John dropped the letter within Todd's grasp. After recovering the letter, Todd was surprised by the words written on the note - \"Now you know how I felt.\" Screaming for John to come back, Todd wanted to know what the note really meant. \n\n\nWhen John returned from his visit with Todd, Nora asked if he felt any better. A sadden John revealed that he didn't. With a knowing look, Nora stated that she knew that seeking revenge against Todd would only make him feel worse in the end. \n\n\nAt Foxy Roxy's Hair Haven, Moe announced to Noelle that they were moving to Llanview and that he would work for Dorian. Noelle and Roxy listened as Moe related his vision of opening a chain of Bonjour Caf\u00e9 restaurants across the country. Noelle expressed her reservations concerning Moe's plan, but he was adamant about remaining in Llanview and working for Dorian. After much convincing, Noelle agreed to support Moe's dream and move to Llanview. \n\n\nWhile Todd sat alone in his cell and thought about Marty, a woman approached his cell. The woman was T\u00e9a Delgado. With a smirk T\u00e9a exclaimed, \"Another fine mess you've gotten yourself into!\"\n\n\n",
