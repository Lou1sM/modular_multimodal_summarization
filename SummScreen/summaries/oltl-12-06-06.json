He convinces Adriana that they will keep quiet forever. Evangeline, dressed for court just in case, collides with Marty and a hot cup of coffee. Her outfit ruined, she trades in for Cris' t-shirt to wear under her jacket. She blames Marty for bumping into her on purpose though Nora, who has witnessed the entire thing, realizes it was an accident. She apologizes for Evangeline. They talk about being in love and Nora assures her that she'll find love again. She wishes the doctor well. She also warns her about associating with Spencer, a dangerous man. They find it somewhat amusing that they always seem to end up on opposite sides. Adriana receives a call from someone who wants to invest in her company and she agrees to a meeting. \n\n\nDorian pays a visit to the Buchanan mansion to show her support regarding Spencer. If all goes well, Spencer will be found guilty. She tells Clint that she's working on changing so that she can make things up to Adriana. Viki arrives for the same reason; support. She doesn't want Spencer executed but merely found guilty and put away for life.\n\n\nBlair finds Todd sitting alone in the courtroom. He's been thinking about almost being put to death. She's still sorry for not believing in him and will always try to make it up. She starts today by bringing Jack with her. He's always loved Todd but was merely confused. He's been straightened out by his mom and is eager to work on his relationship with his dad. Todd is thrilled.\n\n\nJohn awakens from a dream of his father being killed; Natalie is still sitting there, with the ring on the table, calling out to her, though she denies it. The doctor shows up to take some tests and check John over. Cris and an overwhelmed Evangeline visit. The guys enjoy teasing over saving each other's lives. Later, the doctor mentions that John has come through the exam and the surgery with flying colors. Nat goes off to seek a remote even though John has been forbidden to watch TV or become stressed. The doctor returns and announces that the O.R. is being prepped for surgery. Not now, both Nat and John stress. He's waiting for news and no; he will not wait until after he's in recovery to hear anything. The doctor is extremely annoyed, having re-arranged his schedule. \n\n\nTommy and Michael pay a visit to Marcie at school. Starr lingers outside of the classroom and Cole is quick to follow. They overhear talk about Marty's testimony on Spencer's mental health and their worry over how it might affect the outcome of the trial. An angered Michael vows to take the law into his own hands though Marcie points out how crazy that is coming from him. Blair's health is another worry. The teens argue over Spencer and what Marty has said about him. Starr too mentions that she'll see that Spencer gets what's coming to him if he's not found guilty. Cole can hardly believe that she's talking revenge. He calls Marty to get her side of the story; Spencer is bad news and he's concerned about his mom without his dad being around. He's on her side when he hears that she's merely doing her job. He loves her and trusts her and understands that she's just doing her job. Starr hangs out with the McBains and mentions how Tommy looks just like Jack did when he was the same age.\n\n\nSpencer sits in his cell, thinking of delivering Margaret's baby. The tears roll down his cheeks. When Bo comes by, he gloats over the fact that the jury has made no attempt to clarify or go over any of the information heard at the trial. They're moving along so that means he'll be found guilty, he continues. No worries, replies Spencer. He always gets away with everything. When Marty visits, she comes upon a shocking sight. Writing in blood on the wall is Spencer. When he \"runs out of ink,\" he bangs his head to retrieve more blood from the cut on his head. He has words in his head, he tells her. Calling quickly for help, she has Spencer put into a strait jacket and his wounds tended to. Bo and Marty have words concerning Spencer's behavior.\n\n\nDorian arrives just as Adriana receives her phone call and wonders how the caller knew of her up and coming business. Feeling rather pleased with herself, Dorian wanders over to her daughter who immediately accuses her of spying. Dorian makes a comment about getting to the courthouse when the guilty verdict comes down on Spencer. It's nice when people are punished, Adriana retorts. She calls her Dorian, which angers her mother. She apologizes again for the mix-up at the bank, to which Adriana can only give a sarcastic laugh. You will call me mother again someday, Dorian vows, if only to herself.\n\n\nThe Llanview residents begin to receive mysterious phone calls, summoning them to the courthouse. As they begin to converge, everyone wonders what is going on. Todd almost shows he cares when Blair mentions she needs to get her CAT scan. She also can tell that Todd is up to something. Viki jumps into the seat quickly next to Clint, when Dorian stops to primp in her mirror first. Clint notes how too happy she is to make Dorian jealous. Cole tells Starr how difficult it is coming off of steroids cold turkey. She wants to cut class to hear the news, after she hears Michael get a phone call. Marcie hears her and forbids her from leaving. The jury is sent home for the night. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Later at court, Dorian sees Clint sitting with Viki and it doesn't take a genius for Dorian to see that the woman is jealous. She enjoys bringing that out of Dorian. Clint thought that Viki was above all that. She tells him that he overestimates her. Michael is surprised by the way that he feels. He is a doctor and yet, if Spencer gets off these charges, he thinks that he could choke the life out of the man if he gets the chance. Marcie knows that Michael couldn't ever be capable of a thing like that. Michael doesn't know what she thinks that. \"Spencer was a doctor and look at all the terrible things he did.\" Starr comes to see the baby. She thinks that Tommy's gorgeous and he reminds her of Jack as a baby. Michael gets news, along with other parties to go back to court. No one knows why. Todd and Blair get the news. Blair hopes that Marty hasn't done something to screw this up. Evangeline feels that maybe the jury is being brought in to get instruction of some sort. John and Natalie wait for news on the verdict. Natalie hopes that Spencer gets the death penalty for what he has done. The doctor wants to do another operation on Spencer since his condition is getting better everyday, but he doesn't want to be under when the verdict is read. He wants to know the second that there is something to know. Natalie tries to sneak the remote so they can watch the television and get any bulletins that may air. Adriana gets a call from someone who would like to invest in her company. She knows that company that wants to partner with her. It was featured in Craze. She sets up an appointment to discuss the details. Rex is comfortable in his decision not to tell who Tommy's real parents are. He feels that he is saving the child from years of therapy. He is sure that Starr and Jack are headed in that direction and if he can spare Tommy that fate, then he will do it. Adriana feels that Tommy should be with his siblings. \"Adriana, just because you are related to someone, doesn't mean that you have to live with them like Dorian?\" Adriana sees his point. Dorian sees Adriana and compliments her on her choice of nail color. She knows that one day the girl will be calling her 'mother' again. Spencer is brought into the courthouse and he is acting erratic as ever. Todd finds Spencer's crazy act pointless. He will make the man pay one way or the other. Blair wonders what is going on with Todd. She finds him acting out of character. The doctor is really annoyed that John is refusing the surgery that has been set up for him. Natalie begs the doctor to just hold off for a while, till the verdict comes in.",
