Nora pleaded with him to allow her to talk to her husband, so she could let Bo know that she was okay. Eddie disclosed that by the time things were over, Bo wouldn't care. Nora wondered if Eddie really had a plan in his \"pea head,\" and Eddie was angry at the insult. He advised her that the text Bo received would \"dampen his enthusiasm.\" Nora realized that Eddie had pretended to be her, and she wondered what Eddie had said in his text. Eddie agreed to read it out loud.\n\n\nHe pretended to be Nora and read it dramatically in a high-pitched voice. The message stated that she'd been furious with what Bo had said. As Eddie continued to read, Nora remarked that she wouldn't have written the way Eddie had. \"After all this time, we still have...\" Eddie read and shouted out. \"Wait for it!\" he interrupted himself excitedly. \"...Sam Rappaport between us.\" Nora was perplexed. She wondered how Eddie would have even known about Sam. \"I have my ways,\" Eddie said, then laughed in a sinister tone. He read the rest of the text slowly.\n\n\nThe rest of the message indicated that Nora would be going away for a few days. \"Did I capture your essence?\" Eddie asked. Nora couldn't understand why Eddie was trying to break up her marriage to Bo. \"You don't have a shot,\" she told Eddie. She was confused because only Bo and Viki had known about her argument with Bo. Suddenly, it dawned on her that Inez knew also, and she wondered if Inez had put Eddie up to the kidnapping. Eddie took offense. He wouldn't take orders from Inez, he grumbled.\n\n\nNora was certain that Eddie couldn't have planned everything himself, and she began to think about who might have wanted to see her split from Bo.\n\n\nNatalie found John sitting in a booth at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9. He was engrossed in a book, Know Your Child She did her best to reassure him that he'd make a great father. She also mentioned all of the presents they had received, and John disclosed that Marty had given him a gift, too, though she had promptly taken it back before he had a chance to open it. Natalie was perplexed, but John rationalized that perhaps Marty had gone overboard and had reconsidered giving them the gift.\n\n\nJohn noticed that Natalie was quiet, and he knew that something was wrong. Natalie just thought it was weird that Marty had given John a gift and then taken it away.\n\n\nAt a table nearby, Bo sat with Inez. He received a text message that said that Nora wouldn't be able to forgive him. \"My wife has lost her mind,\" he informed Inez. He had no clue as to where Nora might be, but he recognized that she was \"ticked off.\" He only wanted a chance to \"make things right.\" Inez blamed herself, and she got up from the table, assuming that Nora wouldn't appreciate it if she were aware that Inez had spent time with Bo. The police commissioner revealed that the fight with his wife had been about Inez.\n\n\nInez sat down again, and Bo explained that Nora believed that Bo was interested in Inez. He read aloud one of the text messages that he'd received from Nora. It asked if he had to sleep with someone else in order to \"even the score.\" Inez confessed that while she knew about the argument, the type that all married couples had, she hadn't realized it was so serious. Inez was sorry that she hadn't looked for a new job. Bo hadn't realized he'd hurt Nora so deeply, and he thought he should have \"nipped it in the bud.\"\n\n\nThe text message from Nora puzzled him, though. \"It's not her,\" he maintained. It wasn't Nora's way to pick a fight over the phone, nor to \"cut and run.\" He insisted, \"None of this is her.\" Inez was quiet, and she suggested that maybe it really wasn't Nora who had sent the text message. She proposed that maybe someone had found Nora's lost cell phone, but Bo knew that couldn't be true. \n\n\nBo didn't think anyone would have known about the argument. Inez thought that Nora had been pushed too far, and that was a just cause for her unexpected text. Bo decided that he would send Nora an unexpected reply.\n\n\nMarty returned home from the caf\u00e9 and put her key into the front door lock. She turned around, sensing that someone was watching her, but she didn't see anyone, and she entered the house. Rex peered from behind a bush after Marty had gone inside. Just then, he received a phone call from Kelly, who wanted Rex to know that she was ready to talk to Joey. Rex wished her luck and hurriedly explained that he was on a case. It wasn't a good time for a call.\n\n\nInside the house, Marty spoke out loud as if Cole were there. She told him that she couldn't give John the gift after all. She'd looked at his face and realized that he'd done way too much for them to hurt him. She couldn't take his baby from him. She tucked Natalie's paternity test results into a photo album that was sitting on the table. She turned and left the house again, and once she was gone, Rex managed to get inside.\n\n\nHe began to search, and even went through the trash basket. He spotted the wrappings from the gift meant for John. As Rex rummaged around, he received a phone call from Gigi, and he told her what he was up to. He was trying to figure out what a \"normal hiding place\" would be. He picked something out of the trash basket and looked around. \n\n\nWhen Rex spotted the photo album, he advised Gigi that he had to hang up. He held the photo mount that he had retrieved from the trash and began to thumb through the album. He found a folded piece of paper and opened it up. It was Natalie's paternity test results.\n\n\nDorian peered through the French door at Llanfair and watched in dismay as Charlie and Echo locked lips. After Dorian ran off, Charlie abruptly pulled away and ordered Echo to stop. He thought she should go to her bedroom. Echo felt that it had meant a lot to Charlie, and he had taken his time before ending the kiss. \"Anyone with eyes can see that,\" she said. He advised her that she'd had too much to drink, and he had been caught \"off-guard.\"\n\n\nHe insisted that he didn't share Echo's feelings, and while he cared for her, he only loved his wife. Echo was the mother of his son, and she'd always have a place in his life, but he was happily married. Echo thanked him for his honesty, and she thought that Viki was very lucky. She thought it best if she left Llanfair, but Charlie didn't want her to leave. He blamed the kiss on alcohol, though Echo didn't think it was entirely to blame. Charlie knew that the town had been against her, and he didn't fault her for reaching out to him. He forgave her.\n\n\nEcho was thrilled and pointed out how wonderful it was to have Rex and Shane so close and just across the yard. She wanted to get to know them. She was certain that Viki would toss her out when she heard about the kiss, and she was hopeful that Charlie wouldn't mention it to Viki. Echo painted a picture of what would happen if Viki found out about the kiss, and she thought that Viki might go into cardiac arrest. Charlie agreed that Viki wouldn't hear about the kiss as long as there was not a \"repeat performance.\"\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Joey introduced Aubrey to his parents and quickly got down on one knee. He proceeded to propose marriage to an astonished Aubrey, as Viki and Clint looked on and exchanged disappointed glances with each other. Aubrey was speechless, and Clint suggested that Aubrey needed some time to think about it. Viki noted that Aubrey had been taken by surprise.\n\n\nViki and Clint hadn't been aware that Joey was dating anyone, and Joey revealed that he'd only known Aubrey for a few weeks. Viki was concerned, and she indicated that Joey had taken the step too suddenly. Joey accused Viki of being cynical due to her problems with Charlie, and he was disappointed. He'd thought he could count on his parents. Clint was certain that issues with Charlie had nothing to do with Joey and Aubrey, and he felt that Joey had put Aubrey on the spot. Both Viki and Clint were disappointed with Joey's act, and Clint explained, \"This is not the first time that Joey's put the cart before the horse.\"\n\n\nJoey was annoyed with the reaction of both of his parents. He expressed how he'd wanted to share the moment with them, and turning to Aubrey, Joey explained that while both of his parents seemed cold-hearted, they weren't usually that way. Finally, Aubrey spoke up, and she told Joey that she couldn't accept his proposal. It was Joey's turn to be surprised, and Aubrey admitted that she agreed with Joey's parents. It was too soon, and they should enjoy life together first, as well as get to know family and friends. Aubrey suggested that Joey spend some time with his parents, and she walked away.\n\n\nOut by the bar, Kelly saw Dorian rushing by, and she stopped her aunt to find out what was going on. Dorian exclaimed that she was on a mission to save Viki. Kelly wanted details, and Dorian stated that it involved Charlie and sleazy Echo. Kelly thought that she detected happiness in Dorian's demeanor, but Dorian asked if Kelly would want to know if her own relationship were on the rocks. \"You would have to have one,\" Dorian noted drily. Kelly retorted that she could remind Dorian of Dorian's own recent history, but Kelly was prepared to win back her first love.\n\n\nDorian was surprised to learn that Kelly still had feelings for Joey, and Kelly admitted that she hadn't realized it herself. Dorian agreed that the young man was special, and she no longer had feelings towards him. He'd always have a place in her heart though. She gave Kelly her blessing, and pointed out that Joey was even single. \"Free as a bird like me,\" Kelly added happily.\n\n\nClint thought that Aubrey was smart, at least, but Joey was certain that he'd lost her. Viki was convinced that Aubrey was being thoughtful. Clint advised his son that his partner had to be thoroughly checked out before any marriage took place. Joey wanted to look for Aubrey, but his parents stopped him. Clint was angry, and he noted that he'd barely gotten Aubrey's name before Joey had gotten down on his knee. Clint didn't even know anything about the young woman. Joey revealed some insignificant information, like Aubrey's favorite color, and insisted that she was perfect for him. He knew plenty about her, more than Clint knew about Kim before he'd married her.\n\n\nClint took exception to Joey's comment. \"You don't know the first thing about Kimberly,\" he growled. Joey knew that he was happy with Aubrey, and that was enough for him. He thought that Clint should give him respect. Clint felt that Joey didn't deserve it and complained that it was the \"same old, same old,\" with Joey. \"All heart and to hell with the consequences,\" Clint concluded. Viki jumped in to stop the arguing. She didn't think it was fair to judge Joey, but she agreed that it had all happened too fast. Joey had caught Aubrey \"off-guard.\"\n\n\nClint added that it reminded him of Joey's failed marriages to Jen and Kelly. It was the same thing happening again, and Joey had just rushed in. He had to remind Joey that marriage was a \"sacred institution.\"  Dorian appeared just then. \"Oh what an admirable sentiment, she asserted. \"What a pity so many people don't share it with you.\" Clint advised Dorian that they were having a private conversation, and Dorian cheerily agreed that they were having a celebration due to the return of her favorite Buchanan.\n\n\nClint warned her not to get any ideas, but Dorian assured him that she and Joey were just friends. Anyway, she doubted he'd be \"on the market\" for too long. Dorian merely wanted to speak to Viki in private. She had seen something that was only for Viki to hear. Clint began to argue, but Joey walked away, thereby ending the Buchanan family argument.\n\n\nAubrey sat in the bar and ordered a champagne. Kelly showed up with a drink in her hand, and Aubrey revealed that her boyfriend's parents had shown up. She wasn't sure how it had worked out with them. Kelly admitted she hadn't had the nerve to speak to her own man yet, but Aubrey urged her to go ahead. They made a toast that they would both get their men. Aubrey wondered what Kelly's man looked like, since it was possible she had seen him around the Palace.\n\n\nKelly described him as \"tall, dark and handsome\" and someone who had a powerful family, but he was sweet. He also had blue eyes. Aubrey confessed that she'd only had eyes for her own guy, but she looked as though an idea had crossed her mind. After Kelly departed, Aubrey spoke to someone on the phone. She told them of Joey's proposal.\n\n\nDorian pulled Viki outside in the cold and explained that she had followed Charlie and Echo back to Llanfair. She took far too long to tell the story, and Viki implored her to get to the main point. Dorian had looked through the French door at Viki's house. \"There they were,\" Dorian stated. She had seen Charlie and Echo kissing.\n\n\nJoey and Clint sat at a table, and while Clint was hungry, Joey couldn't believe they could just sit there and eat as though nothing had happened. They began to have words again over Joey's \"stunt\" and Clint accused his son of embarrassing Aubrey. Joey fiddled with the engagement ring box and suggested that Aubrey was embarrassed for Joey. Kelly walked into the restaurant and saw Clint and Joey. As she walked over to them, Joey told his father that he intended to marry Aubrey, and he didn't care what Clint thought about it. Clint advised Joey that Joey was on his own to mess up his life with another marriage. Clint got up and left. Kelly sat down and opened her eyes wide as Joey sat and looked at the engagement ring.\n\n\nInez tried to stop Bo from sending his text message. She thought that Nora might misinterpret it. He sent it anyway.\n\n\nEddie told Nora to relax. He gently stroked her face and pointed out a line that he hadn't seen before. She told him he had committed a felony when he'd kidnapped her, and he would receive 25 years to life. Just then, her phone chimed its text message sound, and Eddie picked up the phone to read Bo's response. It said that she sounded like Matthew, Bo had already apologized, and they should be talking. He said that Nora was paranoid to blame things on Inez. Eddie noticed that Bo didn't say anything about love, and Eddie was sorry that Bo had thrown Nora to the wolves.\n\n\nNora emphasized that Eddie would be put away for a long time. He tied a scarf around her mouth and left the motel room.\n\n\nBo received another text from \"Nora.\" \"She wants me to sleep with you,\" he told Inez.\n\n\nMarty returned home.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eddie holds Nora captive and puts his plan into motion, apparently as Clint has instructed him. He sends Bo a text from her phone about how he is very petty to be holding her indiscretion with Sam Rappaport, that happened so many years ago, against her. He's sitting with Inez at Buenos Dias when he gets the text. And he concludes that Nora is being a coward to send texts instead of talking to him directly. He does not suspect that anybody has put her up to writing that although Inez is able to put two and two together to figure out it's Clint that is prompting Eddie to break them up. Charlie takes Echo home. She kisses him and tells him he means so much to her. But he tells her that he is happily married. Unknown to them, however, Dorian appears outside the window to see them kissing. Echo convinces Charlie not to tell Viki that another woman kissed him in their living room, reminding him that Viki has a heart condition and also that Viki will throw her out of the house when she has no job, no money, nowhere to go and is the mother of Charlie's son. At that point, he agrees not to tell Viki. But Dorian wastes no time to let Viki know what she saw. Meanwhile, Joey tells both of his parents that he is going to marry Aubrey even though he barely knows her and knows very little about her. They both tell him he's rushing in and will regret it. But he does not listen. Kelly still has the idea that Joey is single and available to her. Rex goes inside Marty's home while she's out and almost gives up on finding anything until he discovers that she has Natalie's Ob-Gyn report inside a photo album she has of Cole.",
