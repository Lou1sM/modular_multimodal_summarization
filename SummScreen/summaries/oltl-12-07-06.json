Spencer had a fit, yelling to the judge that he is completely sane, but seeming all the more insane from having the tantrum. The judge called Marty back to the stand to explain to the court what she saw in Spencer's cell. She explained the incident and concluded that in her professional opinion Spencer's sanity is rapidly declining and he is unfit to stand trial. Blair stood up to curse out Spencer and Marty a few times, but Todd sat calmly throughout the entire ordeal. The judge dismissed Marty and then ruled Spencer mentally unable to defend himself. \"I have no choice but to declare a mistrial,\" he said, sentencing Spencer to a mental health facility until he is deemed competent to stand trial. After court was adjourned, Nora pointed out to Evangeline and Cristian that Spencer didn't beat the case, just postponed it. She also said the facility will be no picnic for him and guessed that Spencer would beg the judge to let him out within a week.\n\n\nBlair told Todd she was going to the doctor. Todd asked Dorian to take Blair because he had something he had to tend to. Blair warned Todd to not do anything stupid as she and Dorian left. Spencer drooled and screamed as Todd antagonized him. The guards carried Spencer away. Todd left, went into a safe and pulled out a gun. \"All right, Spencer,\" he said to himself. \"Say hello to Mr. nine-millimeter.\"\n\n\nBlair told Dorian that Todd's calmness means he's up to something and worried that whatever it was would backfire.\n\n\nMarty met up with Cole. He asked his mother if she had merely convinced herself that Spencer was crazy because she really wanted to get revenge on Todd. Marty said after a lot of soul-searching she can honestly say that the past did not influence her decision.\n\n\nJohn told the plastic surgeon he would not go under for surgery until he hears the verdict at Spencer's trial. The doctor said he'd try to reschedule. Natalie flipped on the news and the two watched the update about he judge's ruling Spencer unfit to stand trial. Later, Bo caught Natalie alone outside of John's room and the two both worried about what the judge's decision would to do John.\n\n\nJessica took a break from holiday shopping to grab a cup of hot chocolate at Rodi's. Reg eyed her from the bar with a creepy smirk on his face. He walked over and asked Jessica if she's being careful to keep her \"other life\" from her husband. Jessica said she didn't know what he meant, and Reg answered, \"Sure you do \u2014 Tess.\" Reg alluded to a sexual past between them. Jessica got up to walk away but Reg blocked her and suggested they go get a room somewhere. He started touching Jessica but backed off when she threatened to call her husband, the cop. Reg went back to the bar and said to himself, \"Hard-to-get is my favorite game.\"\n\n\nAntonio was helping Nash at the winery when Jessica came by. Antonio noticed she was tense so he sent her off to get a massage. Just outside the winery door, Reg grabbed Jessica and dragged her off. She dropped her purse. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Spencer is angry that he has been deemed unfit and he starts getting to his feet. \"I am not crazy your honor! My attorney is the one who thinks that I am incapable.\" The judge decides that Marty Saybrooke should return to the stand and tell the court of her recent findings. Evangeline wants equal time for her doctor to see the defendant. Marty goes to the stand. \"Please remember Dr. Saybrooke that you are still under oath.\" Marty tells again how she finds that Spencer Truman is unfit for trial. He has a head wound and has been using the blood from it to write the words, 'mother', and 'Blair' on the walls. It's over. Viki sees that Todd is dealing with this too well and doesn't like the calmness that she sees. Jessica goes shopping and Reg the perv sees her but this time she is alone. He goes over to her suggesting that they sneak off for a lover's rendezvous. She isn't interested but he doesn't give up. When she threatens to call her cop-husband and commissioner-uncle for a game of, 'Who's the Prison Bitch?' Reg pretends to back off but when she leaves the bar, he follows her to Nash's vineyard. She stays for a short while, and then realizes she has to pick up the kids. She leaves Antonio and Nash to head out and outside the door, Reg is there to pounce on her. He clamps his hand over her mouth and drags her off. Her purse happens to drop before Nash's door though. Todd sends Blair to her appointment with Dorian and he goes off alone. He goes to a picture that he has on a wall. He removes the painting there and opens a safe behind it. He pulls a gun out and loads it. \"Well, Spencer Say hello to Mr. 9 millimeter.\" Dorian takes Blair to the hospital and she demands to know what is wrong. This Dr. Pembrook is a neurologist and Dorian knows that this visit could be serious. Blair says that this is just stress. Dorian says that if this is stress, then came from the men that Blair keeps ending up with. Blair says that the only person who could give her this much stress is Spencer. Marcie can barely calm Michael down. He doesn't think that he can go to John and give him this news. \"I just don't know!\" John has put off getting his surgery so that he can hear what is happening in court. He and Natalie get the remote and surf channels for information, but all they hear is that the jury has been called in again. When Bo comes to see Natalie at the hospital, he gives her the news and she gets upset. She thinks that this is going to be bad for John's future and recovery. Evangeline and Nora know that this verdict ruins everything. If Spencer is unfit for this trial, he will be unfit for all of them.",
