Ross claimed that he only resorted to desperate measures because T\u00e9a was determined to keep Danielle away from him.   A sympathetic Danielle expressed her love for Ross.\n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, while Starr, Cole, and Langston awaited another performance by the All \u2013 American Rejects, Markko couldn't stop thinking about the great film coverage he had taken of the band.  When Markko stepped away, Langston revealed that Markko had been preoccupied with his film projects and that she felt ignored.  After placing a call to the babysitter, Starr informed Langston that Blair had left town.  Displaying a knowing look, Langston told Starr that Blair was chasing after Todd yet again.\n\n\nIn Seattle, Blair parked her car on level four of the hospital parking garage.  As Blair exited her car, she was surprised to discover Ross standing nearby.   While a nervous Ross attempted to explain why he was in Seattle, Danielle quietly hid behind a wall.   \n\n\nOnce Blair spotted the teen, Ross introduced Danielle to Blair and emphasized that she was his daughter.    Blair explained that she had received a call from Todd's lawyer informing her that Todd and T\u00e9a had been arrested.   Upon phoning the jail, Blair learned that both Todd and T\u00e9a had been released and had rushed to the hospital.   Noticing Danielle and Ross's strange behavior, Blair questioned why T\u00e9a had changed her mind and allowed Ross to have contact with Danielle.  Claiming that T\u00e9a had asked him to take Danielle back to Llanview, Ross asked Blair to give them a ride to the airport in her rental car.  After agreeing to assist him, Blair reached inside her purse and stated that she wanted to phone Todd to inform him that she driving Ross to the airport.   As Blair turned around, she was stunned to discover Ross pointing a gun at her.   Ross demanded that Blair give him her car keys.\n\n\nTodd and T\u00e9a arrived on the third level of the parking garage.  Realizing that Ross and Danielle weren't there, Todd and T\u00e9a raced to the stairwell and headed for the fourth level.\n\n\nBack on level four of the parking garage, Blair agreed to hand over her keys, but only if Ross left without Danielle.  Declaring that he wasn't leaving without his daughter, Ross held Danielle close.  As Danielle cringed, Ross continued to point his weapon and exclaimed, \"Either give me the keys or you'll never see your daughter again!\"  Hearing the sound of police sirens, Danielle pleaded with Ross not to hurt Blair.\n\n\nAs Todd and T\u00e9a finally arrived on the forth level of the garage, they spotted Ross, Danielle, and Blair.  At that very moment, several squad cares also arrived on the scene.  Pushing Danielle and Blair behind him, Ross aimed his gun in the direction of Todd and T\u00e9a, and screamed, \"Come near me and she's dead!\"   Pulling T\u00e9a out of Ross's aim, Todd sheltered both T\u00e9a and himself behind a wall.\n\n\nThe police surrounded Ross and instructed him to drop his weapon.  Placing the gun to Blair's head, Ross retrieved her car keys and ordered Danielle to get in the car.    A terrified Danielle asked, \"Why are you doing this?\"    Calling out to Danielle, T\u00e9a pleaded with her daughter to ignore Ross's threats and asked Danielle to run toward her.  With tears streaming down her face, Danielle stood still.  Blair looked at the teen and urged, \"Go, to your mother!\"\n\n\nInsisting that he and Danielle could escape, Ross reminded Danielle that T\u00e9a would never allow him to see her again.  Ross begged Danielle to get in the car.  T\u00e9a let out a blood curdling scream as Danielle ran to the car and sat in the back seat.    After guiding Blair to the passenger seat, Ross took the wheel and sped off.\n\n\nAs Ross attempted to exit the garage, a squad car cut him off.   Placing the car in reverse, Ross drove the vehicle through the parking garage gate and took off. \n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, as the All - American Rejects performed Cole noticed that Langston was dancing with another guy, while Markko happily filmed the band.   Pointing out that Langston had found a dance partner, Cole took control of the camera, and Markko asked Langston to dance.   Later, Markko advised Langston to warn him if she ever felt neglected again.  Langston responded by giving him a kiss.  Starr and Cole discussed the joy they shared over having Hope as a child.  The young parents declared that Hope's life would be much happier than theirs had been.  Afterward, Starr and Cole decided to leave the club early to be with Hope.\n\n\nAt the apartment, Cristian informed Layla that he had a special night planned for them.   Over a glass of wine, Cristian related that he had prepared dinner.   Noticing that Layla was nervous, Cristian questioned what was wrong.   Layla admitted that she was nervous about dating again after several bad experiences.  Pulling her close, Cristian stated that he cared deeply for Layla.  Layla smiled as Cristian declared, \"You mean more to me than anyone else and I'll never hurt you!\"    Cristian's words caused Layla to soften and they shared a passionate kiss.  Afterward, Cristian and Layla made love.\n\n\nKyle and Oliver arrived at Kyle's apartment with plans to continue their first date.  Realizing that Oliver was extremely nervous, Kyle assured him that everything would be fine.  As Oliver relaxed, the two men kissed passionately.  \n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Marty stood out in the hall and spoke to John over the phone.  While Marty and John made dinner plans for the night, an injured Nick stumbled into the emergency room and collapsed.  In a panic, Marty hung up the phone and attended to Nick.   Once Nick related that he had been attacked by a group of men because he was gay, Marty phoned John and informed him that Nick had been the victim of a hate crime.  Marty also asked Nick if there was someone that he wanted her to call.\n\n\nBack inside Kyle's apartment, as Oliver and Kyle shared a special moment, both their cell phones rang.  Marty informed Nick that Kyle was hospitalized, and John gave Oliver the news.

Kyle rushed to be by Nick's side.  After Kyle had spent a few moments alone with Nick, John and Oliver questioned Nick about the assailants.  Nick explained that the three men had followed him to Rodi's and had later waited for him in the alley.  Upon hearing Nick's description of the men, Oliver realized that they were the same men who had caused a scene at the swearing in ceremony.  \n\n\nAfter locating the offenders, John and Oliver accompanied the men to the Llanview police station for processing.  Oliver became enraged when one of the men directed a gay slur at him.   Oliver attempted to hit the man, but John prevented his officer from assaulting the cuffed offender.   John instructed one of his men to place the loud mouthed criminal in the same cell with Mitch Laurence.  Noticing Oliver's emotional state, John assured Oliver that things would get better.   Expressing his anger over the actions of prejudiced individuals, Oliver related that he didn't think things would ever change. \n\n\nBack at the hospital, Marty happily related to Kyle that Nick hadn't suffered any head or internal injuries.  Alone with Nick, a heavily sedated Kyle apologized for ruining Kyle's big date.  Assuring Nick that Oliver understood, Kyle promised to remain by Nick's side.  A few moments later, Oliver arrived and announced that the men were in jail.  After thanking Oliver for his help, Kyle turned his attention back to Nick.  Oliver quietly left the room.  \n\n\nAs Kyle tenderly cared for his injured friend, Oliver watched the men through Nick's hospital window.\n\n\n",
