Things got worse when his pal joined in, offering, \"Two for one.\" A quick-thinking Jessica pretended to be Tess and tricked one into handing over his cell phone. She then called Antonio, who was conveniently hanging out with Nash. The guys were off to the rescue! One tried to attack Nash with a wooden beam, but Antonio punched him in the face before he could do any harm. Jess then bashed the other thug over the head with a bottle. \n\n\nNatalie kept vigil by a bandaged John's hospital bed as he awakened from surgery. They joked about how much she liked seeing him in bandages. The light mood was ruined when Vincent stopped by and Nat told him in private that their friendship needs to be \"on hold.\" Vincent replied that he understands, then told John he's there if John needs anything. \"We need to talk about Natalie,\" John stated, making it clear that he's back in the picture. \"Sorry, John, but I can't make any promises,\" Vincent said to himself.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Dorian urged an ill Blair to worry about herself and not Todd. Blair reminded her aunt that Todd's the mother of her children and that she and Todd used to be a team. Dorian understood her desire to have her family back, but insisted Blair see a doctor to find out what's wrong with her.\n\n\nRex was determined to keep the truth that the McBains adopted Todd's son and went to the hospital to snatch a particular file. Adriana told Michael she's sorry to hear the judge's ruling about Spencer. Dorian ran into them and informed Adriana that Blair is ill. Adriana temporarily dropped her feud with her mom to join in on supporting Blair. However, she turned down Dorian's offer to start planning for how they'll care for Jack and Starr's kids if Blair dies. Rex emerged from the records room with the file, but Dorian caught him in the act. Dorian delighted in having the upper hand. Adriana grudgingly thanked her for telling her about Blair. Blair, meanwhile, got the news that she's pregnant. Dorian wondered if the baby is Todd's or Spencer's.... Rex later called Michael and told him he got the file on Tommy's birth parents.\n\n\nBo entered his office and was surprised to see his son waiting with take-out for him. Bo was grateful for the chance to salvage his bad day and made a special toast. After, Matthew stated that Bo would be a lot happier if he were married. Matthew asked why he isn't marrying Paige. Bo explained that he wants to give Paige time to grieve over Hugh's death.\n\n\nStarr complained to Viki that her family can't catch a break and that her parents are never going to get together. Viki encouraged her to remain optimistic. Starr admitted to being confused over what to feel after meeting Todd's rape victim, Marty, in person. Viki said that Todd is still paying for the crime. Starr wasn't sure what to say to him, so Viki suggested she tell Todd she loves him.\n\n\nThe cop car carrying Spencer had to stop suddenly on the road, due to an unseen obstacle. Meanwhile, an armed Todd hid in the bushes. They were shocked when a bullet hit the window. When the cops emerged, a masked Todd tackled them to the ground and took over driving the van. \"I love to drive!\" Todd gleefully shouted out, as he sang a Christmas tune. Spencer wanted to know where they were going. \"You'll understand when we get there,\" Todd replied. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica is taken to a secret location and Reg tries to get it on with her but she fights him. Another arrives and Jessica runs to him thinking that he will save her from Reg. It turns out that the man is the man that Tess ripped off when she first met Nash. They are going to force her to have a threesome. She plays the game like Tess would and asks for a drink first. Reg runs to the car and gets a bottle of vodka that he was saving for just such an occasion. While he is gone, Jessica purposefully spills the other man's drink on his clothes to get his attention away from her. She then turns her back on him and sends Antonio a text message. 'Taino' Antonio knows this means that Jessica is in danger and he and Nash swing into action. They track her to the shed where Reg and his friend have let her stall enough. Nash and Antonio enter the building and knock the men out. Reg isn't completely out and so when Antonio's back is turned, he makes a swing at Antonio's head with a two by four. Jessica is there and whacks the psycho before he can harm even a hair on Antonio's head. \"I don't know about the both of you, but I really need a drink!\" she says. Vincent comes to the hospital. He notices Natalie ring is gone, and thinks this has to do with the kiss they shared. She isn't worried about that. She leaves the area and John calls to Vincent. \"I know that you have feeling for Natalie, but I am back now.\" Vincent leaves the room knowing that he might not be able to stay away from Natalie. The van transporting Spencer comes to a sudden stop. There must be something wrong with the road the guards check things out and try to start driving again. The window on the passenger side breaks and a masked man pushes a gun in the window at the guards ordering them to keep still. He overpowers them and drags them out of the van one by one and drops them face down and motionless on the ground. Spencer goes back to the van now and drags the cuffed Truman out of the vehicle and to his knees beside the two guards. This is when Spencer recognizes the masked man's voice. At this point, the masked man really doesn't care. \"Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! Jingle All The Way! Oh what it will be to make Spencer Truman pay!\" Todd is driving fast, with his head out the window, feeling the wind in his hair and singing the carol with his own brand of Christmas spirit blended in. He is happy and it shows by the maniacal smile on his face. Spencer struggles to get the hell out of the back seat, but Todd has him in there good. \"I don't hear you talking about you 'mommy' anymore.\" All Spencer does in response is chuckle like the sane Spencer Todd knows. \"Where are we going?\" Spencer asks. \" We are going to the scene of the crime \"",
