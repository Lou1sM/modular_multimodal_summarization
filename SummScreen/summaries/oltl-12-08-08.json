    "soap_central": "\nIf You Build It, She Will Come\n\n\nWhile T\u00e9a was amazed by Todd's new face, Todd wanted to know why she had come to visit him in prison. Reading excerpts from the daily paper, T\u00e9a questioned Todd about the statements he had made about being in love with Marty. When Todd expressed his love for Marty, T\u00e9a insisted that he was actually experiencing guilt over the rape - not love. With a look of sadness, T\u00e9a remarked that Todd's guilt had always prevented him from truly falling in love with anyone. Fed up with T\u00e9a's refusal to divulge the reason she had returned to Llanview, Todd demanded answers. After a long sigh, T\u00e9a stated that she once loved him and believed that she was the only one who could help him avoid prison. T\u00e9a was certain that she could battle Nora in court. She made certain to acknowledge that Todd's actions were despicable, but insisted that he was entitled to a defense. \n\n\nTodd wanted to know T\u00e9a's motives, but she wanted information concerning his relationship with Blair. After telling her about his latest marriage to Blair, Todd said that it was the worst mistake that he had made. A curious T\u00e9a continued to question Todd, but he had no desire to discuss his life. Todd was adamant that he didn't want any help from T\u00e9a. He insisted that he had hurt everyone that he ever loved-- his children and Marty. T\u00e9a was shocked when Todd revealed that he did what he did out of love for Marty and that she had changed him. Realizing that Todd had true feelings for Marty, T\u00e9a surmised that his love for Marty could be used as a defense at his trial. Refusing her services, Todd told T\u00e9a that his actions were inexcusable and he intended to pay for his crimes. Todd insisted that he had lost everything that mattered. Angered by Todd's refusal to fight, T\u00e9a accused him of giving up. T\u00e9a was certain that he would never be able to stand prison, and would soon realize that he needed her. Before leaving, a sarcastic T\u00e9a complimented him on his new face. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Marty thanked Cole for the letter he had written for her. While Cole was certain that Marty would soon regain her memory, Marty was doubtful. They both agreed that Todd would pay for what he had done to Marty. When Cole offered to help his mother in any way, she asked to borrow his laptop. Cole turned on the computer and was startled to learn of Dr. Joplin's suicide. He worried that the news would be troubling to Starr. Marty urged Cole to pay Starr a visit. Alone, Marty surfed the web. She confined her search to information regarding Todd and the rape. As she read about Todd's many crimes, she was plagued with memories of the time they shared together at his home. \n\n\nMarty printed out countless news articles related to Todd. A news clipping caught her attention - the marriage of Todd and T\u00e9a. Later, Marty studied a photo of Todd. She mumbled, \"I got what I need, now I can do what I have to do.\" \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr discovered Dorian in a terrible mood. Realizing that Dorian's mood was somehow connected to Blair, Starr asked what had taken place between the two. Dorian admitted to causing trouble between Blair and John, but quickly changed the subject. Dorian expressed an interest in how Starr was handling Hope's passing. After explaining that Viki had allowed her to hold baby Chloe, Starr admitted that it made her feel worse. When Starr blamed herself for Hope's death, Dorian vowed to make Dr. Joplin pay for causing the tragedy. Stating that she would sue Dr. Joplin for malpractice, Dorian placed a call to the hospital to begin the process. Upon learning that Dr. Joplin had committed suicide, Dorian related the information to Starr. Consumed with guilt, Starr insisted that her actions were to blame for everything that had transpired, including Dr. Joplin's death. \n\n\nStarr confided in Dorian that she had visited Todd at the hospital. She couldn't understand how her father could display caring qualities and then destroy lives with his horrible misdeeds. Dorian convinced her niece to see Todd for who he really was - a despicable human being. \n\n\nAs Dorian attempted to lift Starr's spirits, Cole arrived to lend his support. After Dorian updated Cole about Dr. Joplin's misdiagnosis of Hope, Starr explained that their blood types were incompatible and resulted in the creation of antibodies that attacked Hope's blood. When Starr compared herself to Todd, Cole assured her that she was nothing like her father. Cole consoled Starr and stated that bad things often happened for no reason. \n\n\nOn the rooftop of the Angel Square Hotel, Blair paid John a visit and apologized for the altercation that had taken place earlier at the cafe. Although John refused to blame Blair for Dorian's actions, Blair felt responsible and admitted that she feared Marty would come between them. As John made an attempt to respond, Blair interrupted him and insisted on parting as friends. To Blair's surprise, John made it clear that he didn't want to end their relationship. Revealing that he never realized the impact that seeing Marty would actually have on him, John stated that the woman he found at Todd's home wasn't the same woman he once knew. Stating that he wasn't making any promises, John declared that he wanted to be with Blair. As Blair stood speechless, John gave her a passionate kiss. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie watched as Viki cradled a sleeping Chloe. When Viki mentioned that Bree and Chloe would help Jessica get through her ordeal, Natalie wondered who would help Viki deal with her own issues. Viki believed that it was her responsibility to help Jessica, but Natalie begged her mother to tend to her own needs. Natalie was adamant that Charlie was the person to help Viki move on. Viki said that her life was too hectic and that she didn't want to burden Charlie with her problems. While Viki insisted that she was being fair towards Charlie, Natalie was certain that her mother feared moving on with her life. Natalie asked Viki when the last time she was happy had been. After hesitating, Viki smiled to herself and acknowledged that she was happy when she was involved with Charlie. \n\n\nMeanwhile, at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Jared questioned Charlie about his relationship with Viki. Charlie admitted that he loved Viki, but said it was up to her to decide whether or not their relationship would move forward. Charlie was pleasantly surprised when Moe and Noelle entered the caf\u00e9 and stated that they were moving to Llanview. When Moe announced that he would be working for Dorian, Charlie and Jared were shocked, but chose to keep their opinions to themselves. Noelle was delighted when Carlotta hired her to work at the caf\u00e9. As Noelle ran off to prepare for her new job, Moe headed off to La Boulaie to pay a visit to his new employer. Upon Moe's arrival, Dorian greeted him and welcomed him as her new chef. \n\n\nWhen Jared arrived at Llanfair and mentioned that Charlie was at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Viki asked Natalie and Jared to babysit Bree and Chloe while she ran an errand. Afterwards, Natalie and Jared were certain that their plan to reunite their parents was working. \n\n\nBack at the caf\u00e9, Viki approached Charlie. Charlie wondered why she was there. Viki stated that she was looking for him.\n\n\n",
