Choosing her words carefully, she stared at her boyfriend as she told both men that Rex couldn't ruin her important \"surprise.\"  Pressed for time, Brody bid the couple goodbye as he rushed off to the police station.\n\n\nAs Gigi hustled him into the foyer, Rex asked her why she had stopped him from talking to Brody.  He believed that Marty had falsified Natalie's paternity test results to name Brody as the baby's father, and wanted to inform Brody and Natalie of the \"deception.\"  Gigi said that they didn't need to hear it.  \"Why not?\" Rex asked, before a horrible thought occurred to him. \"Oh, my God...because it's true?\"\n\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, Kelly was caught between Joey and Aubrey's expectant gazes as she declared that she, like Joey, had made up her mind about her love life.  Joey seemed pleased to hear it, and asked Kelly whom she was involved with.  When Kelly haltingly explained that it was someone she had known a long time, and even been married to, Joey became confused.  \"Kelly, are you talking about me?\" he asked, as Aubrey stared daggers at Kelly.\n\n\n\"No, no, no!\" Kelly cried, forcing a laugh. \"Don't be absurd!\"  Joey was stunned to realize that Kelly meant that she had reunited with Kevin.  Kelly spun a yarn about how she and Kevin had reconnected in London and resumed their family life with Zane, and claimed she had gone back to the United Kingdom to tell Joey in person.  She said she had been worried about breaking the news, but felt better knowing that he had Aubrey.  Joey appeared unsettled, and wanted to call Kevin to ask him about the surprise reunion.\n\n\nRising from her seat, Kelly told Joey he couldn't call Kevin, because Kevin had wanted to speak to him personally, brother to brother.  Joey agreed to wait to speak to Kevin, but said he had to call Viki and inform her that Aubrey had accepted his proposal.  As Joey rushed off, Aubrey thanked Kelly for staying silent, and asked if Kelly thought anything would change if Joey knew the truth about her hidden passion.  \"Do you?\" Kelly shot back, looking Aubrey in the eye.\n\n\nWearing a saccharine smile, Aubrey told Kelly that she didn't think Kelly's feelings would've made a difference to her and Joey's engagement, and claimed she only wanted to spare Kelly the inevitable humiliation when Joey rejected his ex-wife.  She coyly suggested Kelly and Kevin give it another shot for real.\n\n\nJoey returned from the lobby and announced that Viki had given him and Aubrey her blessing.  Aubrey kissed him passionately as Kelly looked on, helpless.  Aubrey suggested that she and Joey head up to their suite, and Joey agreed.  He said goodbye to Kelly, who wore a plastic smile as she offered the couple her congratulations.  As soon as Joey and Aubrey were gone, Kelly fled to the patio and wept, alone.\n\n\nAt the police station, Natalie told John she had news he wouldn't like -- she was beginning her Lamaze classes.  \"Is that the thing that I, uh, I try to coach you to breathe while you scream about how much you hate me for getting you pregnant?\" John cracked.  He admitted it wasn't his idea of a good time, but promised to be there for Natalie and the baby through everything, even as she cursed at him like a drunken sailor during labor.  \"I'll be a lot worse than a drunken sailor,\" Natalie sighed. \"Bring it,\" John joked. \"No problem.  I'll be there, it's our baby, right?\"\n\n\nIn Bo's office, Inez entered and asked if he had heard from Nora since her \"text message.\"  Bo confirmed that Nora was maintaining radio silence.  Inez expressed her sympathy for her boss's plight by putting her hand over Bo's -- a gesture Matthew noticed as he walked into the office.  \"Am I interrupting something?\" he asked, staring at his father.\n\n\nAs Inez left the office, Matthew told Bo he didn't want to know the details of the \"innocent\" moment he had just witnessed, but needed Bo to sign his permission slip to skip his last period study hall in order to go to work at Buchanan Enterprises earlier in the afternoon.  Bo opined that Matthew was spending too much time at B.E., and reminded his son that his schoolwork needed to take precedence.  \"Where's Mom?\" Matthew asked with a sigh, \"I'll get her to sign.\"  \"I have no idea,\" Bo murmured sadly.\n\n\nAs Bo related the story of his and Nora's argument and Nora's subsequent disappearance, Matthew grew upset.  He couldn't believe Bo wasn't out searching for Nora, and accused Bo of spending more time cozying up with Inez.  \"Real nice, Dad,\" Matthew snapped, storming out of the office.\n\n\nMatthew brushed past Inez in the hallway, then ignored Brody and John's calls as he raced past them in the squad room.  Noticing Matthew's foul attitude, Brody told John they had their own children's teenage years to look forward to, but said he could handle it all compared to the nightmares he had suffered when he believed Ford could be the father of Jessica's baby.  \"You must be relieved by those paternity test results,\" John said, walking down the hall.  \"More than you'll ever know,\" Brody muttered to himself.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Gigi begged Rex not to make her answer any questions about Brody and Natalie, and asked him to get rid of his copy of the paternity test results.  Before Rex could inquire further, Natalie returned home, and Rex asked his sister point-blank: \"Is Brody the father of your baby?\"  \"You told him?\" Natalie cried, wheeling around to face Gigi.  \"Oh, my God,\" Rex moaned. \"It's true.\"\n\n\nGigi headed to work, leaving the Balsom siblings to talk things out.  As they walked into the drawing room, Natalie told Rex all about her drunken night with Brody, and called it a terrible mistake.  Rex hugged Natalie and told her he couldn't judge her -- he knew what it was like to act in a desperate moment when love seemed lost forever.  Natalie thought he was referring to his fling with Stacy, but instead Rex alluded to his kiss with Kelly without naming names.\n\n\nNatalie explained that neither Brody nor John knew the truth about the baby's paternity, and Rex swore that her secret was safe with him.  She asked how he had found out the truth if not from Gigi, and Rex told her that a separate case he was working on for Todd had unexpectedly led him to the information.  Showing Natalie his copy of the paternity results, he revealed that he had found the document in Marty's house.\n\n\nAt Rourke's Gym, Bobby Ford challenged his father to ten rounds in the boxing ring in order to get Eddie to leave Llanview for good.  Eddie laughed off the challenge, but Starr goaded him and called him a coward afraid to face his eldest son.  When Eddie turned on her, James stepped in between the two.  Eddie deflected his sons' repeated questions about why he was still in town, but after enough encouragement, he agreed to Ford's challenge and began working out in preparation.\n\n\n\"This is so caveman,\" Langston moaned, and called Ford's plan stupid -- she worried about his preexisting injuries, but Ford was sure the showdown would be easy as pie.  He wanted to face Eddie immediately, but Eddie insisted it could wait, and claimed he wanted a crowd.  He asked Ford to assemble an audience, and said he would be there.\n\n\nWith Eddie gone, Ford remained smugly confident about his chances in the ring while talking to the teens.  \"I work out everyday!\" he reasoned, and said he needed to beat Eddie in order to redeem himself for abandoning James.  As Starr and James moved away to call Inez, Langston begged Ford to find another way to get rid of his father.  Ford told Langston that violence was the only language Eddie understood, but Ford blithely admitted he had no prior boxing experience, not even in gym class.  \"Great,\" Langston mumbled.\n\n\nInez returned to Bo's office and asked him if he was okay after his argument with Matthew.  She said Matthew's rebelliousness was to be expected at his age, but Bo felt the change in Matthew was a direct result of Matthew's working with Clint.  Just then, Inez got a call from James, explaining that Eddie was still in town and would face Ford in the ring.  Upset, Inez told Bo, who resolved to head down to Rourke's personally.  After Bo left, Inez prepared to call Clint.\n\n\nAt Buchanan Enterprises, Clint was annoyed to find Vimal waiting in his office.  He said he didn't have time for Vimal, as he was busy squashing the latest \"gold digger\" attempting to infiltrate the family by marrying his son Joey.  \"I was instrumental in the squashing of Rex Balsom,\" Vimal chimed in.  Clint warned Vimal to forget his actions in the DNA lab, and Vimal asked if that meant he needed to forget about his changing Clint's daughter's test results as well.\n\n\nClint ordered Vimal to remain silent about everything he had done for the Buchanan family, and warned him that if anyone ever learned the truth about Rex or the baby, Clint would hold him personally responsible.  He ordered Vimal to get out, and as Vimal exited the office, Matthew entered.  Matthew informed his uncle that he hadn't been able to get Bo to sign his permission slip, and said that Nora was missing in action.  Clint feigned ignorance as Matthew told him about Bo and Nora's argument over Inez, and put on a show of insisting that Bo and Inez's \"moment\" at the station had to have been completely platonic.  Matthew remained unconvinced.\n\n\nJust then, Inez called Clint and informed him that since he had failed to banish Eddie from Llanview, she would not seduce Bo.  Clint ordered a dejected Matthew to get him coffee; after the boy left, he told Inez that all she needed to do was sleep with Bo by the next day, and Eddie would be gone with the morning's light.  Inez told him that seducing Bo in one evening would be impossible, and asked Clint if he had anything to do with Nora's disappearance and recent messages.  Clint said he had no idea what Inez was talking about, but reiterated that all she needed to do was sleep with Bo, and she would never worry about Eddie Ford again.  \"Inez, you'll have everything you ever wanted,\" Clint promised before hanging up, \"including my brother.\"\n\n\nBo arrived at Rourke's, and instantly surmised that Eddie had hit James again.  He told the assembled teens that he had heard that Eddie was still in town, and preparing to fight Ford in the ring.  He called Ford's plan dumb, and said Inez didn't like it either.  Ford thanked Bo for the concern, but said he had one chance to get \"this SOB\" out of his family's lives, and he was going to take it, no matter what happened.  Bo asked where Eddie was, and said he hoped to get Eddie out of town before the fight.\n\n\nIn another corner of the gym, James thanked Starr for sticking up for him, and admitted that when he had been fighting Eddie, he had wanted to kill him.  \"I don't blame you,\" Starr replied.  Across the room, Langston continued to fear for Ford's well-being, while Bo got off the phone with a patrolman.  He explained to the couple that his patrolman had checked for Eddie's car outside the Ford brothers' apartment building, but there was no sign of the vehicle.  \"Where is he?\" Ford wondered aloud.\n\n\nAt the Minute Man Motel, Nora struggled to get free of her bindings that kept her tied to the chair.  Flashing back to her conversation with Eddie, she again concluded that Inez had to be in cahoots with Eddie to split her and Bo up.  Spotting the television remote control on the floor, she managed to hop in the chair over to it, and clutched the remote with her feet.  Using her toes to turn the TV on, she began pressing down on the volume control with her foot until the room was blaring with the sound of loud cartoons.  When a neighboring guest began to complain and banged on the door, Nora struggled to scream for help through her gag.\n\n\nAt the police station, John asked Brody to head over to the Minute Man Motel to deal with the noise complaint.  Brody was annoyed by the motel's past superficial complaints, and suggested they ignore the call.\n\n\nEddie returned to the motel to find the TV on.  Furious, he turned it off.  \"Nice try, bitch,\" he snarled at Nora, but told her that no one in the fleabag motel would notice her escape attempt.  As he stripped off his jacket, he explained to Nora that he was training for a fight, and considered using her as a sparring partner.  Nora cowered, unable to move as Eddie jabbed at the air inches from her face.\n\n\nAs Eddie re-tied Nora's binds, he warned her that she would be punished for her disobedience.  Before he could follow through, Brody began pounding on the motel room door from outside.\n\n\nAt the police station, Inez left Bo's office, seemingly hysterical.  John noticed her cries and asked if he could help.  Inez said she couldn't speak to him, but needed professional help.  John gave her Marty's name.\n\n\nBack at Buchanan Enterprises, Matthew returned to Clint's office with his uncle's coffee.  Clint assured him that Nora would be back soon and would sign the boy's permission slip.  \"Or you could just get Vimal to fake it for me, right?\" Matthew quipped.  Clint froze as Matthew explained that he knew that Vimal had faked a hospital keycard and gotten into the DNA lab for Clint, and said that he and Clint were in things together.  Matthew told Clint that he knew the truth -- \"Charlie isn't Rex's dad.  You are.\" \n\n\n",
