    "tvmega_recap": "Roxy is devastated that Fraternity Row is cancelled and is bound and determined to get Natalie and John back together even if Natalie has given up. Although Bo is out of a job, he wants to work with John to get to the bottom of who killed Victor and what happened to Tomas Delgado. Todd is not giving up on Blair although she wants to move on and trust Tomas. Neela agrees to get Jack to confess to having Gigi killed by pretending to want to date him and keeping a concealed tape recorder in her purse. But he does not yet confess. Rex returns to Llanview knowing he's lied to his son although he still needs to get the answers that Kimberly has promised to give him about Stacy and Gigi in exchange for getting her sprung from jail. Cutter realizes that if he reveals to Gigi/Stacy that he knows she's the real Gigi and lied about it, then she will no longer be his friend, be angry at him and want to get back to Rex and Shane. So he keeps it a secret. She is trusting of him when he does not reveal that he's heard she is Gigi, not Stacy, and has never had any plastic surgery because this is her real face. But she knows she needs to stay in Paris, TX. He knows he better get them both out before somebody recognizes her and her memories of Gigi Morasco come back. But she wants to stay."
