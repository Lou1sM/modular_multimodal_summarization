When he told her that he wasn't sure about much in his life, Blair took that to mean that his interest in her had waned. John quickly cleared up any misconceptions by telling Blair that he wanted to be with her and then kissing her. The two stumbled into his bedroom and made love. Afterward, Blair began chatting about Christmas. Talk of Christmas led to Blair reminiscing about her favorite movie, Christina Comes Home for Christmas. She confided that she had fallen in love with the classic as a child growing up in the foster care system. Later, John and Blair curled up together in bed and watched the movie on television. \n\n\nCris and Vanessa arrived home after meeting with attorneys. Both were frustrated that they hadn't been able to resolve Vanessa's impending deportation. Vanessa worried about how she would break the news to Lola. Things took an unexpected turn for Cris when Vanessa began talking about how much he meant to her and then suddenly reached up and kissed him. The kissed continued until Cris pulled away. Vanessa immediately began apologizing. She explained that she had merely wanted to experience one kiss with him before she was sent back home. Cris told her that it was okay and tried to brush it off, but he appeared affected by the turn of events. \n\n\nTalia walked into the apartment and found Sarah busy typing away on her laptop. She immediately suspected Sarah of trying to dig up dirt on Vanessa. Sarah denied it and pointed out that she didn't need to do anything about Vanessa, because her rival would be returning to Colombia within days. They were sidetracked when Layla walked into the room to get second opinions about her ensemble. Layla had a blind date with a guy she described as a nerd. She looked forward to the evening because her date, Nelson, would not have an entourage dancing in attendance with him. The two planned to see a showing of the classic movie, Christina Comes Home for Christmas. Sarah, meanwhile, intended to go to Cris's place to watch the same movie on television. After her roommates left, Antonio joined Talia. They settled down on the sofa to watch the movie and ended up kissing as it played out. \n\n\nWhen Vanessa learned that Sarah and Cris had a date to watch the Christmas movie, she told them that it had been one of her favorites since childhood. Sarah wasn't moved to invite Vanessa to join them. Instead, Sarah reminded Vanessa that Cris had a television in his room and told her what channel she could find the movie on. Vanessa left, but eventually returned to the living room, dressed in a slinky nightie, on the pretense of needing water. Sarah was annoyed while Cris couldn't seem to take his eyes off of Vanessa as she walked through the room. Neither woman took notice of where Cris's attention was focused. Before she returned to her room, Vanessa stopped to watch Cris and Sarah snuggled up together on the couch as they watched the movie. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, while Carlotta and Jamie prepared to watch Christina Comes Home for Christmas, Viki told Charlie how touched she was by all that he had done for her since her return from Africa. She surprised him when she asked him if he was interested in reconciling with her. Charlie was stunned and asked her what had happened to change her mind. Viki admitted that she had realized that Charlie was a \"keeper.\" Charlie made his own confession. He told Viki that he couldn't get Viki out of his heart or head, and that was why he had chosen to model Carlotta's diner after the Bon Jour Caf\u00e9, where they had first met. \n\n\nThe two continued to talk and make peace with the past events that had led to their breakup. Viki realized that she had to learn to trust Charlie again because she had never stopped loving him. After Viki called to check on Natalie and the girls, the happy couple decided to go to Charlie's room at the Angel Square Hotel and reconnect as lovers. When they stepped outside, Charlie and Viki stopped to kiss as snow began to gently fall. \n\n\nAt  Llanfair, Natalie and Jared enjoyed a moment of peace and quiet while babysitting Jessica's children. Natalie was thrilled that the silence in the house was natural rather than a result of being locked in a soundproof room. Their quiet was soon interrupted by Bree and Chloe's cries. As the children acted up, the adults found themselves overwhelmed by the realities of parenthood. Bree ran around and threw toys while Chloe cried inconsolably. Natalie admitted that she was not prepared to be a parent. Jared agreed that he wasn't ready either. Eventually they managed to get the girls to sleep; however they were exhausted. They quickly took turns showering and changed their clothes. They were interrupted when Roxy called Natalie to remind her that Natalie's favorite movie, Christina Comes Home for Christmas, was on television. Natalie was touched that Roxy had remembered that the movie had a special place in Natalie's heart. She confided to Jared that, as a little girl, she would watch the movie alone until Roxy staggered home, drunk. Unfortunately Natalie and Jared were too worn out to watch the entire movie. They fell asleep before it was over. \n\n\nGigi, Rex, and Shane returned home after picking up their Christmas cards with the family portrait on the front. Shortly afterwards Roxy stopped by for a visit. When she learned that they had family Christmas cards made, Roxy was excited. She recalled wanting to pose with Rex and Natalie for similar cards when the children were young. However, she had changed her mind when Rex's father told her that pictures stole a person's soul. Roxy didn't want to risk it on the off chance it was true. Rex was surprised to learn that Walter Balsam had believed such a thing. When Roxy looked guilty, Rex realized that she had been referring to Rex's biological father rather than Walter. \n\n\nBefore Rex could ask questions, Roxy changed the subject and began rambling about whom she wanted to send Rex's family holiday cards to. When she mentioned sending one to Jessica at St. Anne's, Shane objected. He didn't want to risk Brody being hurt if he saw one of the cards. Roxy wasn't concerned about Brody's feelings, which seemed to upset Shane even more. Gigi and Rex quickly diffused the situation. While Gigi whisked Roxy out of the room, Rex stayed behind and handed Shane a picture of Shane with Brody. He explained that Gigi had found the photo and they had decided that Shane could have several Christmas cards made of it. Shane was touched by the offer and invited Rex to help him decide what the cards should read. A short time afterwards, as Roxy was leaving, Shane referred to her as \"grandma\" as he bade her farewell. Roxy appeared surprised and then smiled brightly. \n\n\nLater, Shane fell asleep on the sofa as he watched Christina Comes Home for Christmas. Gigi and Rex woke him up and sent him to his room. When they were alone, Gigi and Rex began kissing and then made love in front of the fireplace. \n\n\nAt St. Anne's, Jessica spotted Brody with a dinner tray and invited him to join her in a quiet corner of the common room. Both admitted that they weren't comfortable eating in the dinning room with the other patients. As they ate their dinner, Brody noticed a couple of pictures that Jessica had with her. Jessica showed him the pictures and explained that they were of her daughters. When Brody asked her if Chloe was a good baby, Jessica had to admit that she didn't know because she hadn't spent much time with her. She also confessed that had no memory of Chloe's birth. Brody was understanding and began talking about Shane. \n\n\nAs they opened up to each other, Jessica asked Brody what Tess had said to him when she had tried to leave the sanitarium. Brody was initially reluctant to tell her but Jessica explained that she needed to know for her own mental well-being. When he told her that Tess had promised to make it worth his while to help her and made a comment about his body, Jessica wasn't surprised. She explained that Tess was promiscuous, but made it clear that it didn't mean that Jessica was. Brody believed Jessica and was sympathetic. He realized how difficult it was for Jessica to struggle with her condition. \n\n\nJessica appreciated Brody's kind words but didn't feel he could truly understand what she had to endure. Brody disagreed and confided that he had visions of a young boy as a result of his disorder. Jessica seemed to see a kindred spirit in Brody. When they announced that a movie, Christina Comes Home for Christmas, was about to start, Brody and Jessica decided to watch it together. Before they joined the others, the two agreed to keep an eye on each other. Later, as they watched the movie, they sat close, smiled, and seemed to enjoy each other's company.\n\n\n",
