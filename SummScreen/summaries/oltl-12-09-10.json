    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Buchanan Enterprises, Matthew advised Clint that he knew the truth, and that Clint was Rex's father. Clint admitted it was true, but he wanted to deny his paternity based on the fact that Rex was a con man. He explained how Rex had arrived in town and had been after Jessica's money. The young man claimed to have changed, but Clint was certain that Rex was after the Buchanan family fortune. He reminded Matthew that Rex had broken into Clint's office, and Matthew had seen him. Matthew still didn't think he would be able to keep Rex's paternity a secret.\n\n\nClint figured that Rex didn't want him as a father, anyway, and he thought that the way it had worked out was better for both Rex and Charlie. Matthew pointed out that he was disappointed, because Rex could have been a family member -- a cousin for him and a nephew for Bo. Clint replied, \"Bo already treats Rex more like a son than...\" He stopped himself but Matthew finished the sentence for him. \"More like a son than me?\" Matthew asked.\n\n\nClint said that he hadn't said that, and he attempted to smooth things over. He thought that Matthew should sit and have a talk with his father, but Matthew assured Clint that things were fine. Clint explained that Bo had always had a \"soft spot\" for Rex. Clint thought it was because Rex was a private investigator, so that was close to being a cop, and Rex was probably around the same age that Bo's deceased son Drew would have been.\n\n\nMatthew retorted that it was all about Rex and Clint, but Clint insisted, \"There is no Rex and me.\" Clint thought it was more about Rex and the Buchanan fortune, and he was convinced that Rex would push everyone else out of the way with the Buchanan name and Bo backing him up. Clint could fight Rex, but there would be no guarantees. He supposed that one could be the smartest, best, most loyal person and still lose. He wondered if something like that had ever happened to Matthew. The young man acknowledged that it had. Clint didn't think they should risk things when Rex and Charlie could have the relationship they both deserved.\n\n\nMatthew realized that Asa would have made the same moves, and he figured that was why his father wasn't in the family business. He thought his father deserved to know what was going on. Clint noted that there were several reasons for Bo not being in the business, and he thought it was unfortunate that Matthew didn't receive the same respect from Bo. He tried to drop it, guessing that Matthew would want to pursue it. Clint stated that it was adult business, but then he relented. He warned Matthew that he wouldn't like it.\n\n\nClint explained that he had been dating Inez for a reason, and that was because she was a threat. She had been attracted to Bo, and Clint had done his best to keep her from turning her attention to his brother. He had failed, because she'd broken up with Clint. She was too distracted because of her attraction to Bo, but Bo wasn't innocent. He didn't discourage Inez. Matthew thought that his father was just nice, but Clint announced that Bo had been cheating on Matthew's mother. Bo had been having an affair with Inez.\n\n\nNatalie was distraught after Rex showed her a copy of the paternity test results that he'd found in Marty's house. She was certain that her life would be destroyed. They discussed the situation, and Rex revealed that he had been at Marty's house, looking for a gift that Marty had given to John and then taken back. Natalie believed that Marty had planned on showing John the paternity test results, and Rex had to agree that Natalie was probably right. Natalie swore that John and Brody couldn't find out about it, and she was going to have to make certain that Marty kept her mouth shut. Natalie insisted on going to see Marty alone. Rex was concerned, and he recommended that Natalie try to remain calm.\n\n\nAfter Natalie left, Rex was surprised when Charlie walked through the front door. Rex was apologetic, and he indicated that he had been with Natalie and then had remained behind to make some phone calls. Charlie advised him that excuses weren't necessary, and Rex was welcome at the house at any time. Rex admitted that things were still new, and Charlie was sorry. Rex reminded Charlie that it wasn't Charlie's fault, but Charlie was also sorry for the time they'd lost. Charlie admitted that it might have been better without him, anyway, because he hadn't done Jared much good. Charlie regretted that Rex had grown up thinking the wrong man was his father.\n\n\nCharlie could tell that Rex had something on his mind, and Rex divulged that he had received some news that wasn't too good. Charlie offered to help however he could. The talk turned to Echo, and Charlie confessed that Echo had acted out after drinking too much and was sleeping it off. Charlie was certain that Dorian had tried to get Echo drunk so that she could obtain information. He added that Echo was disturbed by what she had done to Rex when he was born, and though it wasn't much, she wanted to make it up to Rex. Rex responded that he didn't need a mother, and Charlie agreed that she had to earn it, because mere DNA was not enough. Charlie would be his dad forever though.\n\n\nRex had to leave to look after Shane, and Charlie offered to watch his grandson anytime. Rex revealed that Shane had been thinking about calling Charlie \"grandpa,\" and Charlie liked it. He was hopeful that Rex would call him \"dad\" one day.\n\n\nMarty sat in her office and tried to concentrate on the probationary letter from the hospital that she was reading. She crumpled it up in disgust, but she was saved when Inez walked through the door. Inez noted that John had referred her to Marty, and she needed help before she did something terrible to a very good man. She was unable to sleep because she had been so distraught. Marty promised to prescribe some medication, and she urged Inez to talk about her problem.\n\n\nInez spoke about the man whom she was very fond of, and how she would have never thought about committing a despicable act in the past, but her boys needed protection. The man was happily married, and she hated herself for possibly making a move to destroy his marriage. Inez then enlightened Marty on the troubles her sons had gone through, and how the man she had been dating had helped them out. He wanted her to ruin his friend's marriage in return.\n\n\nThen her ex-husband had arrived in town and had physically abused one of her sons. Inez's ex-boyfriend offered to get rid of Eddie, but again, in return, he insisted that she follow through with his demand. The man she had dated had looked respectful, but he was manipulative and powerful, she explained to Marty. Inez was about to explain further, but suddenly, Natalie burst through the door. \"You and me right now,\" Natalie yelled at Marty.\n\n\nMarty couldn't believe that Natalie had disturbed a session with a patient, but Inez got up to leave. Marty quickly wrote out a prescription for her, and she turned to Natalie who slammed the door behind Inez. \"I know exactly what you're up to you little bitch, and I will not let you ruin my life,\" Natalie shouted. Marty played dumb when Natalie handed her the test results, and she claimed she'd never seen them. Natalie informed her that it had been found in Marty's house, and Marty quickly accused Natalie of breaking in.\n\n\nNatalie replied that it had been someone else in the house, but she didn't think Marty had a leg to stand on. Marty had stolen Natalie's private medical records, which was a felony. Marty encouraged Natalie to call the cops, in particular John or Brody. Natalie strongly advised Marty to keep her mouth shut. She accused Marty of teasing John with the present, and wondered how Marty could hurt John with the news. Marty confessed that she had decided that she couldn't hurt him, and that was the reason she hadn't given him the gift.\n\n\nNatalie vowed to see to it that Marty lost her license, and she was sick of being held responsible for everything wrong in Marty's life. The women began to scream at each other, and suddenly, Natalie slapped Marty hard.\n\n\nBo spoke to Ford and James at Rourke's Gym about the fight that Ford planned to have with his father. Bo didn't like the idea, and neither did Inez, he advised the brothers. Ford was positive that Eddie would leave town once Ford had the opportunity to beat his dad in a fair fight. Starr and Langston stood nearby. The young women were not looking forward to the fight but Starr was happy to see Cristian walk in. \"Team Ford has a secret weapon,\" she announced.\n\n\nStarr disclosed that she had called Cristian, because he had been a professional fighter. She thought he'd be able to help Ford out and give him some tips. Cristian agreed that after he had seen what Eddie had done to James, he was more than willing to show Ford how to fight. Cristian was dismayed to learn that he didn't have much time.\n\n\nStarr couldn't look as the stripped-down men began to box, but her girlfriend had a different opinion. \"I can't stop,\" Langston said. James thought that he should be the one to learn, since he was the one Eddie had been after. James had also gotten some good punches in when he had boxed with his father before. Cristian believed that Ford would be better at it since he had more weight, and Ford probably didn't care if he hurt anyone. After learning that Eddie had belonged to a fight club, Cristian assumed that Eddie would be a dirty fighter.\n\n\nFord refused to accept James's offer and began to fight in earnest with Cristian. Ford fell to the floor as Cristian got an early punch to connect. \"This is never gonna work,\" James muttered. Langston was feeling hot again, and she decided that she needed some air.\n\n\nBrody banged on the door at the Minute Man Motel where Eddie was holding Nora hostage. Finally, Eddie emerged just as Brody threatened to break down the door. Brody asked why the room was registered to Elmer Fulton, and he made it known that the manager had complained about the extremely loud television. Eddie maintained that he just wanted to be alone, although Brody demanded to know who else was inside. A bound and gagged Nora did her best to call out, but it was to no avail.\n\n\nEddie tried to get rid of Brody quickly, and he alluded to the fact that he had a woman inside who liked to make noise. That was the reason for the loud television. Eddie smirked. He reminded Brody that they were all consenting adults, and Brody finally agreed to leave after advising Eddie to keep it down. After Brody left, Eddie hightailed it back inside. \"You are gonna pay for that stunt,\" he snarled at Nora. He removed Nora's gag and told her to go ahead and scream. \"What are you going to do with me, Eddie?\" she asked.\n\n\nNate was happy that Dani was visiting with him, especially after her encounter with his father. Dani assured him that she knew all about having a \"tough dad,\" although Nate was certain that Eddie was worse. He promised that he was not like his father at all, but Dani informed him that she was already well aware of that. Eddie would never understand the \"dumb virgin\" that she was. Nate hurriedly declared that he was in no rush, and he really cared about her. They decided to study, but when Dani opened her biology book, the chapter she had to work on was entitled \"Human Sexuality.\"\n\n\nBo showed up looking for Inez or Eddie, but Nate didn't know where either of them were. Bo disclosed that he was worried about the fight that Ford intended to have with Eddie, figuring that Eddie would leave town after losing. \"No he won't,\" Nate spoke out. \"That's what I said,\" Bo agreed. Bo's phone rang, and it was Brody, who let Bo know that he'd located Eddie. Brody was certain that Eddie was up to something, but he wasn't sure what it was. He thought it might be drugs. Bo ordered Brody to go to the gym and keep an \"unofficial eye\" on Eddie when he arrived.\n\n\nInez returned home with her filled prescription, and Bo advised her that Eddie was at the motel. Dani and Nate headed to the library. Bo explained that he'd sent Brody to the gym. He turned to leave, but Inez stopped him. She offered to make coffee and asked him to stay. Bo opted for a beer, and he revealed that things had been tough. He'd had his issue with Nora, and then Matthew had been giving him attitude. Suddenly, Inez piped up, \"I can't do this.\"\n\n\nBrody arrived at the gym in street clothes and revealed that he'd seen Eddie. He was there to make sure the fight didn't get out of hand. He looked on as Cristian and Ford continued to fight. Ford was definitely getting the raw end of the deal. James held himself responsible for the fix that everyone was in, but Starr assured him that if Eddie had been a \"real father,\" none of it would have happened at all.\n\n\nFord's lesson continued, and Brody jumped in to help. He fought with Cristian so that Ford could watch. Langston had returned and watched all of the men. \"This six month thing is not getting easier,\" she murmured to herself. Dani and Nate showed up, but James was against his younger brother being there. Starr thought it was a good idea, to show Ford support. James vowed to take care of his father if Ford lost the fight.\n\n\nEddie decided it was time for him and Nora to have some fun. He sent Bo another text message and pretended to be Nora. He informed Nora that he'd told Bo that Bo was free to enjoy Inez. Nora was certain that Bo wouldn't sleep with Inez, but Eddie believed that Bo would if he hadn't already done so. He stooped down to a seated Nora and suggested that they have some fun too. \"Let's give the neighbors something to talk about,\" he said.\n\n\nBo wondered what Inez was talking about, and she claimed she had been talking about the fight. She couldn't just sit there while the fight was going on. Bo thought it might push Eddie over the edge if he were to see Inez there. Inez went to the kitchen to retrieve the drinks, and just then, Bo received a text message that read, \"Did you sleep with her yet?\" Inez was giving herself a pep talk. She grabbed her new prescription medicine and shook out a pill. She read the label that noted the pill could cause disorientation or drowsiness if taken with alcohol.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Eddie keeps Nora hostage in the motel room. Bo has no clue what has happened but Brody finds Eddie in the motel. Yet, he does not have a search warrant to enter or find out what Eddie is doing. Meanwhile, Robert wants to challenge Eddie to a boxing match where if he (Robert) wins, then Eddie will leave town. James, Starr, Langston and Bo all warn him not to go through with this. But he asks what choice he has since nothing else will get Eddie to leave and the only language he understands is violence. Right then, Cristian appears and wants to show Robert some boxing lessons but proves that Robert is inexperienced and not likely to win a boxing match with anybody. Eddie sends Bo text from Nora's phone telling him she wants him to sleep with Inez. Inez remembers that Clint told her that the only way he will get rid of Eddie and enable her sons to have a bright future is if she sleeps with Bo. She goes to talk to Marty about the situation but does not reveal who these two men in questions (Bo and Clint) are. Natalie busts into Marty's office and tells her she knows what she's done. Marty asks Natalie if it's true that she slept with Brody and got pregnant by him and has not told John. Inez returns home and knows that she has to \"cozy up\" to Bo. Meanwhile, Matthew reveals to Clint that he knows that Rex is Clint's son and Clint wants to hide that. And he wants to know what Clint is implying about Bo and Inez. Bo then reveals to Matthew that Bo and Inez are sleeping together.",

The two of them decided that they would try to get back together, but they would have to wait until after Jared's wedding to find out if it was going to happen. The three of them agreed that they wanted to try to keep Rex's paternity a secret for the sake of the family.\n"
