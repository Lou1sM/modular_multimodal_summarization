    "tvdb": "Agent Baker comes to Todd disguised as a maintenance man saying they need to talk. Tomas contacts Blair via the internet and shocks her by saying at gunpoint that he killed Victor. Viki tells Clint that if Kim were to walk through that door he wouldn't give her a second though. Ta tells John that Tomas didn't kill Victor and believe that Calmar is the guilty one. Gigi tells Cutter that she can't leave the Bon Jour Cafe, cause it feels like she belongs here. Agent Baker tells Todd that Tomas will die if he doesn't convince Blair. Clint's ankle monitor goes off when he and Viki get into an argument. John makes Ta promise not to tell Blair that Todd is still a suspect. Rex kisses Kristine and asks her to spend Christmas with him and Shane. Kim surprises Clint when she arrives at Llanfair. Viki and Rex arrive in Texas unknown that Gigi is inside working. ",
    "tvmega_recap": "John and Tea both conclude that it makes perfect sense that Tomas is not guilty of anything, has been held captive by Todd and has been framed by Todd for the murder of Victor. But he warns her not to ruin their investigation by \"warning\" Blair because they know all too well about Blair's attachment to Todd. And sure enough, Tomas appears on Blair's webcam and convinces her that he's gone for good and has killed Tomas. She concludes that once again, she's been fooled and has fallen for a criminal. And Todd is \"right on cue\" to console her and get her to play into his scam. Rex declares that he does have feelings for Aubrey although he wants to take it slow after losing Gigi. And he gets ready to visit Paris, TX with Shane and Viki. Clint urges Viki not to leave without working out their \"issues\". But she walks out and doesn't care that in order to walk after her, his ankle bracelet has gone off. Meanwhile, Gigi/Stacy declares that she has feelings for Cutter, doesn't want him to leave town and convinces him to stay. Viki and Rex stand outside the Bon Jour Cafe and reminisce what the place has meant to them both and their memories of Gigi. Little do they know, however, that right inside is a woman who looks exactly like Gigi because she is. And when Clint is alone, out of nowhere, Kimberly appears at the door."
