    "soap_central": "\n Danielle in the Lion's Den\n\n\nAs Stacy waited at home for Rex to pick her up for her doctor's appointment, Rex and Jessica stood outside of Mitch's hospital room. The doctor advised them that Mitch needed blood transfusions from them in order to stay alive. The newly discovered brother and sister couldn't believe that fate had fallen into their hands. They took turns explaining that they weren't there to provide blood but to obtain blood for their own children, should the need arise in the future.\n\n\nUpon questioning from the doctor, it turned out that Rex had an incompatible blood type and Jessica was unable to donate due to her previous bout with hepatitis. A nurse arrived and advised the doctor that blood had been obtained from another source. Rex was happy that it wasn't his blood that would save Mitch's life. Jessica apologized to Rex for her reaction when he had first announced that he was her brother, and said she should have been more understanding.\n\n\nRex understood and realized that being Mitch's children wasn't a great connection to have. Jessica was thrilled that they would be aunt and uncle to each other's children and while she didn't care for Stacy, was happy to have another niece or nephew on the way. Rex vowed that their children would have nothing to do with Mitch.\n\n\nNevil left the Buchanan mansion on his way to the airport, but Kim pounced on him before he was able to leave the grounds. She began to make a pass at him but upon hearing Clint's voice as he strode up to the door, she pushed Nevil into the nearby bushes. Clint was surprised to see Kim, assuming she had returned to Buchanan Enterprises with the file he had sent her to obtain. Kim confessed to getting lost and offered to help him out with another errand instead. Clint turned her down, but asked if she had just seen Nigel. She replied that she hadn't and would see Clint at the office the following day.\n\n\nOnce Clint disappeared inside, Nevil made his way out of the shrubs. Kim confided that she couldn't let her boss see her fooling around with the help, but wanted Nevil to be aware that she was attracted to him. She invited him to her place, informing him that she would have to regale him with intimate details of the \"Sicilian Thunderbolt.\" A flattered Nevil followed willingly.\n\n\nInside the house, Nigel updated Clint on his schedule for the day. Clint commended his butler for always being there to tell him what was going on, as he made a quick phone call to Nora.\n\n\nKim and Nevil returned to Rex's loft, where Kim was surprised to see Stacy still at home. Stacy asked quietly about Nevil's horrid teeth and Kim enlightened her roommate that there were no dentists in England. She explained that Nigel wouldn't tell Clint about Bo and Nora, but Nevil would. As Stacy headed out for her doctor's appointment, Kim planted herself all over Nevil, who enjoyed the attention. Though noting that he didn't drink, he accepted the one that Kim made for him.\n\n\n\"American girls are so helpful,\" Nevil gushed at Kim, who praised Nevil heartily for showing up in the United States to tell Clint about Nora's cheating. Nevil assured her that he had to remain quiet, but Kim, opening her shirt, advised him that \"some things need to be out in the open.\"\n\n\nKim continued to lead Nevil on and the English butler grew more hot and bothered by the moment. Suddenly Kim stopped and pulled away. She confided that she was too upset about her boss, Clint, to continue. She pointed out that cheaters ruined things for everyone. She needed for Clint to learn the truth so that she could continue to \"rock\" Nevil's world. She wanted Nevil to be the one to tell Clint about Bo and Nora.\n\n\nNevil apologized, but clarified that he would not be able to meet her conditions. It was not his place to tell Clint. It was not proper. Only one person, Nigel, could be the one to expose the truth, he sighed. He wished he could be like Nigel, who set an example for those who served in the same profession. Removing his glasses, Kim soothed him, sure that he could be exactly like the man his cousin was.\n\n\nBo and Nora returned to Seattle with good news for Matthew. They had permission to take him back to Llanview. The teen was less than thrilled as he steadfastly told his parents he was not leaving until he was sure that Danielle was safe. He and T\u00e9a's daughter had become very close due to going through similar situations, he added. Matthew was adamant in his refusal to leave, even though Nora felt that there was nothing her son could do for Danielle. Stepping out into the hallway and finally giving in, Nora and Bo decided that they would stay in Seattle. Bo offered to check around for information, and left for the police station. He gave Nora a quick kiss.\n\n\nMatthew and Nora spoke about essentially what a small world it was and how Matthew and Danielle had met. Jokingly, Nora suggested that the teens had been talking about their crazy lawyer mothers as common ground but when Matthew looked away, she realized she had hit the nail on the head. \"Did you really hate me that much?\" Nora asked her son. Matthew stressed that he hated what his parents had done. Nora emphatically responded that she hadn't wanted to lose him. They agreed that the entire event with Matthew being paralyzed had been scary and they all went a little \"nuts.\"\n\n\nMatthew understood that the entire scenario caused his parents to kiss just as he and Danielle grew closer because of how they felt about their mothers. He knew that Bo and Nora had grown closer because of him. A call from Clint interrupted them.\n\n\nNora shared the good news about Matthew's legs with Clint and told him that she and Bo would not be returning right away because of what was happening with Danielle and Blair. Nigel stood by his boss and heard that Bo and Nora were remaining in Seattle together. Clint assured Nora that it was fine to stay in Seattle and that he was proud of Matthew. He loved her and was hoping that they would all return to Llanview soon.\n\n\nNora hung up the phone sadly. Matthew wondered if his mother was okay and she assured him that she was. Matthew apologized for getting between her and Clint in the past, but said he was feeling better about Clint. He moved his legs for Nora and she was thrilled.\n\n\nAt the Seattle police station, Todd harassed the cops for news of his missing daughter and T\u00e9a blamed herself for the predicament that Danielle and Blair found themselves in. Contrary to Todd's belief, T\u00e9a was concerned for Blair's safety and she knew that Blair would look out for Danielle. Todd began to ask T\u00e9a questions about their daughter. She admitted that Danielle was very much like Todd in that she was very complex. He wanted to know all about Danielle, and T\u00e9a grabbed her briefcase. She explained that Danielle's life story was inside.\n\n\nShe had taken everything from Tahiti that mattered, T\u00e9a confessed to Todd. She pulled out an old picture, a pink baby bracelet, an old report card and a childhood poem that Danielle had written about T\u00e9a. As she began to cry, Todd placed the bracelet on T\u00e9a's wrist and wrapped his arm around her to comfort her.\n\n\nThey were surprised to see Bo walk in. He explained that he and Nora were worried, too, and he was there for an update. Todd and T\u00e9a asked Bo to help on the investigation even though he didn't care for them. He agreed to check in with the chief of police. Alone with Todd again, T\u00e9a admitted that she took notice that Todd hadn't said anything about Danielle being his daughter. Todd admitted that he didn't want Danielle to be the last person to find out about him. Bo returned with the information that it seemed likely that Ross was headed to the Canadian border.\n\n\nOn the run with Blair and Danielle as captives, Ross made the decision to pull over to try to find another car to use. He knew that the police would be looking for Blair's rental car that he was driving. Blair advised him that he was out of control and urged him to turn himself in. Ross was intent on making his way to Canada with the women by his side.\n\n\nAs Blair fiddled around in her purse, Ross gave her a difficult time. He asked what Blair was doing, since he had already taken her phone. Blair declared that she had some snacks and handed one over to a very hungry Danielle. Blair preferred to wait for a decent meal, she told Ross disdainfully. Danielle insisted that her father was really a good guy who had been backed into a corner. Blair agreed that people did some crazy things when they were forced to.\n\n\nWith the women's help, Ross managed to hide the car off of the road. He insisted that his actions were the result of T\u00e9a's forcing him to do what was necessary to keep his daughter. Blair coldly stated that mothers protected their children no matter what. Danielle was curious as to how Blair knew T\u00e9a. Blair and Ross hesitatingly explained that Blair had been married to T\u00e9a's boyfriend.\n\n\nRoss asked Danielle to thumb a ride for them while he and Blair remained out of sight. He reminded his daughter of the success she had in Tahiti when they'd needed a ride. Blair was appalled that Ross had asked his daughter to hitchhike. Ross threatened to harm Blair if she informed Danielle that Ross wasn't her real father.\n\n\nBlair was certain that Todd already knew the situation, though Ross contended that he was not afraid of Todd. Blair suggested that he'd better hope that the police found him before Todd did. \"We both know how far Todd Manning will go to keep his children,\" she warned him.\n\n\nAs Danielle stood poised by the road with her thumb out, a car slowed down and stopped. A man emerged and wondered what Danielle was doing all alone in the secluded area. Suddenly, Ross and Blair materialized and Ross explained that they were victims of car trouble, having left their car down the road. He asked for a ride, noting that they didn't have a working phone. The man determined that a tow truck was the thing that was needed and he turned to retrieve his phone in his car. Ross sucker punched the man on the head from behind and knocked him out. The shocked women gasped.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, the doctor informed Rex and Jessica that the transfusion had worked and Mitch was being prepared for surgery. \"Don't work too hard, Doc,\" Rex mumbled. He and Jessica discussed Mitch's stabbing and they were confused that he had allegedly stabbed himself. Stacy arrived for her appointment and was surprised to see Rex. She scolded him for forgetting her doctor's appointment, annoyed because the baby needed him. She relented when she heard about Mitch. Rex suggested that Stacy go to the appointment herself, as he needed to call Gigi.\n\n\nStacy looked in on Mitch and told the unconscious man that she would call him dad after she and Rex were married. She was sure that he would be useful to her. She eyed the vials of blood sitting on the table by Mitch's side.\n\n\nShe was startled when Rex returned and pulled open the curtain. \"What are you doing here?\" he demanded to know. She responded that she had just been getting a look at Mitch, though Rex was perplexed. He reminded her that she had seen him before, when she had helped to take his blood. She apologized for that, she insisted. \"Did you?\" he asked. Stacy complained that it was different seeing Mitch this time. Last time he was merely a \"turnip in a bedspread.\" She smiled and told Rex they were in it together.\n\n\nStacy promised to reschedule her appointment and, eyeing Jessica, extended her sympathy for what had happened to Jessica's father. As Jessica and Rex stood at Mitch's bedside, he opened his eyes slightly. \"My children. I knew they'd come to me,\" he uttered. He began to quote scripture. He appeared confused to hear that he had tried to kill himself. Rex told him to try harder next time. Smiling broadly, Stacy left the premises, glancing down at the vial of blood in her hand.\n\n\nNigel confessed that he was worried about all that the family had been through of late. Clint advised his trusted servant that he couldn't get through it all without Nigel. The Englishman always did what was best for the Buchanan family.\n\n\nNora helped Matthew to exercise his legs and assured him that they would find Danielle with Bo on the case.\n\n\nBo asked many questions and learned that Blair's rental car had a portable GPS. Setting up some equipment, he did not receive any type of signal and determined that the GPS was not turned on. He would figure out what their next step would be.\n\n\nAgain, Blair told Ross that he was out of control and needed to turn himself in. Ross pushed the women towards the man's car, urging them to get in. Unobtrusively, Blair reached into her purse and turned on the portable GPS. Ross threatened her as she climbed into the car. At the police station, the equipment began to sound. Bo turned towards it and announced that they had a signal. He was able to pinpoint the location of  Blair, Danielle, and Ross.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo and Nora are ready to take Matthew home since he's ready to walk soon. But he is not going anywhere until he knows that Dani is ok. Bo goes to see if he can find where Ross had taken Dani and Blair. Todd and Tea are together, getting closer when they are both worried about their daughter and both grateful that Blair is there for her. At first, Bo can't find them. But Blair activates her GPS so that the cops can find the car they are in before Ross takes them over the Canadian border. Doctors ask Rex and Jessica if they can donate their blood for Mitch's transfusion because their \"father\" could die without it. They are not certain what to do. The doctors find the blood for Mitch. And right then, Stacy happens to be in the hospital ready for a check up but needs to falsify the paternity for Rex. So she takes a tube of blood for Mitch. Meanwhile, Kim attempts to get Neville to admit to Clint that Bo and Nora are messing around so that she can \"be there\" for Clint when he's in a vulnerable state of mind.",

Bo offered Nora a kiss and said he was essentially giving her a kiss, and she gave it back.\n"
