When Nora asked if Eddie would add rape to his list of charges, Eddie claimed that women wanted to pay him for sex, but that he would \"do\" Nora for free.  As he continued to undo Nora's buttons, Nora begged Eddie not to touch her and then spat in his face.\n\n\nIn Clint's office at Buchanan Enterprises, Clint told Matthew that Bo was having an affair with Inez, but Matthew refused to believe him.  When Clint insisted that Matthew forget about all of it, Matthew wondered how Clint could expect him to forget that his dad was having an affair.  Matthew insisted that Bo would never cheat on his mother.  Clint told Matthew that Bo might cheat if he had a good reason.  Matthew cried, \"Are you saying that my mom cheated on my dad?\"\n\n\nClint wondered why Nora would cheat on Bo, after everything they had been through together.  Matthew realized that Bo and Nora had fought some, but he believed that it was all part of being married.  When Matthew desired to know if Inez was even sleeping with Bo, Clint told Matthew to call his mother.\n\n\nBack at the hotel, Nora's phone beeped, which indicated an incoming text message.  Eddie yelled, as he picked it up.  Eddie declared to Nora that Inez would convince Bo to sleep with her.  Eddie again started to unbutton Nora's shirt, when Nora's phone rang.  Eddie screamed and placed the gag back on Nora.  He then answered the phone.\n\n\nWhen Matthew demanded that the man put his mom on the phone, Eddie claimed, \"She's tied up right now.\"  After Eddie hung up the phone, he announced to Nora that he had to leave for a boxing match, so that he could pommel \"the little punk.\"  Eddie then insisted that he would take care of Nora \"to the max\" upon his return.  As he walked out of the door, Eddie exclaimed, \"Sometimes it bites being a dad.\"\n\n\nBack in his office, Clint asked, \"Well?\"  Matthew revealed that \"some guy\" had answered the phone.   Clint insisted that Nora had made Bo \"ripe for the picking\" and said that he would not be surprised if Inez was with Bo at that moment.  When Matthew declared that he had to leave, Clint claimed that he would always be there for his nephew.\n\n\nIn Inez's living room, Bo looked at the text message supposedly from Nora, \"Did you sleep with her yet?\"  Inez checked the label on the pill bottle in her kitchen and then poured a beer in a glass.  After Inez remembered that Clint had promised to make Eddie disappear if she slept with Bo, she put the pill contents in the glass.\n\n\nAs he held up his beer to her wine, Bo toasted Inez, \"Bottom's up.\"  Shortly after, Bo yawned and loosened his tie.  He slurred that he \"never should have shot his mouth off about Sam,\" and that Nora had only wanted to give Bo a baby, after Drew had died.  Bo exclaimed that he loved Nora, and that their fighting was not them; he fell asleep on the sofa.\n\n\nAt the gym, as Cristian and Brody boxed, Bobby insisted that he owed the fight against Eddie to James.  However, James was concerned that Eddie would not play by the rules.  James feared that Eddie would not leave town, as he had promised, if Bobby won.  James voiced, \"He's not leaving town until he's ready.\"\n\n\nFord sparred with Brody to prepare for the fight, and Brody knocked Bobby down.  After Ford got back up, Brody then punched Bobby.  Cristian felt that they should \"take five.\"  James and Nate discussed Bobby's chances of winning, and Nate declared that they could even the odds and cheat.\n\n\nLangston ran to Ford and asked if he was okay.  When Langston admitted that she was scared that Bobby would get hurt, Ford laughed and stated that he was afraid of that also.  Langston begged Ford to \"walk away right now, and I will have sex with you.\"  Ford claimed that he would not be able to sleep with Langston for that reason, even though it was something that he really wanted to do.\n\n\nEddie pranced into the gym and cheered, \"Hello, Llanview.  Are you ready to rumble?  That's what I'm talking about.\"  Nate again explained to James that they should drug Eddie or use brass knuckles or mess with Eddie's gloves.  However, James was worried that they would \"go to jail for assault.\"  In another part of the gym, Eddie sent another text message to Bo's phone.\n\n\nIn her apartment, Inez read the message, \"Well, I don't want you either.  Not until you get Inez out of your system.  Just sleep with her already.  I don't want to hear from you until you do.\"  When Clint called Inez and asked her if she had \"gotten it done,\" Inez informed Clint that Bo was resting.  Inez asked if the messages to Bo had really been from Nora, but Clint denied knowing about the messages.\n\n\nAfter Inez hung up the phone and glanced at Bo still asleep on her couch, she cried out loud, \"I can't do this.\"  However, after she remembered Clint's threats, Inez woke Bo.  When Inez asked Bo to make love to her, he could only see Nora with his blurred vision.  Bo kissed Inez.  Matthew walked into Inez's apartment and found them kissing.\n\n\nBack in the gym, Eddie egged Ford on to start the fight.  As Eddie and Ford argued, James slipped a gun into his shorts pocket.  Eddie continued to boast and brag that he could handle all of them.  When Bobby asked Langston if she still wanted him to call off the fight, Langston screamed, \"If you don't put him in the ground, I will.\"\n\n\nAfter Nate insisted again that they mess with Eddie's gloves, James told him no.  Nate then declared that he would take care of it himself and stormed off.  James looked again at the gun that he had hidden in his pocket.\n\n\nClint called Eddie, and Eddie revealed that he had left Nora \"resting comfortably\" in the hotel room.  Clint demanded that Eddie return to the room and take Nora to Inez's apartment.  Clint explained, \"Something's going to happen, and it's crucial that she sees it.\"  Clint then declared that Eddie would not get \"paid one red cent until the job was done.\"\n\n\nEddie announced to the group at the gym that he would have to give Bobby a rain check, so Cristian left.  When Eddie insisted that he had someplace he needed to be, Ford called Eddie a coward, and James cried out that Eddie was all talk.  Eddie insisted that he and Bobby would fight \"tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.\"  When James called Eddie \"a chicken,\" Eddie pushed James away.  Bobby hit Eddie, and Eddie grabbed Bobby around the waist, as they scuffled.\n\n\nStill in his office, Clint poured a drink and looked at a framed photograph of himself and Bo.  Clint turned the picture facedown and walked away.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, Rex ran in and found John, who greeted him.  When John asked if Rex had seen Natalie, Rex revealed that he had been with Natalie.  Rex then evaded John's questions about where Natalie was.  When Rex declared that John almost looked happy, John agreed that he was.  Rex reminded John that Natalie was not perfect, and that she would make mistakes.  However, Rex also insisted that Natalie was afraid of failing John.\n\n\nJohn assured Rex that nothing Natalie did could ever change his feelings for her.  Rex announced that he had to track down Eddie Ford for a client, and John indicated that he could point Rex \"in the right direction.\"  John informed Rex that Eddie was \"holed up at the Minute Man hotel,\" and that Brody had checked it out and was on watch over Eddie.\n\n\nJohn recollected that Eddie had left his room and then commented that \"if a capable picklock was to come along and find his way inside, who knows what he might find.\"  John assured Rex that the security of the Minute Man was \"thin\" and asked Rex to be careful.  Rex thanked John and left.\n\n\nAt Marty's house, Natalie yelled at Marty and slapped her.  When Marty attempted to slap her back, Natalie grabbed her hand and yelled, \"Don't.  You slap me once, shame on you.  You slap me twice, I will kick your ass, Marty.\"\n\n\nMarty believed that Natalie only wanted an excuse to take her frustration out on Marty and insisted that Natalie would lose John.  Marty cried that she only wanted her son back, and that she did not want to hurt John.  However, Marty added that John deserved more than Natalie, and that Natalie deserved to lose everything -- just like Marty had.  Natalie threatened to have Marty fired and believed that Marty would be sent to prison.  Natalie exclaimed, \"If I go down, Marty, you're going down with me.\"\n\n\nMarty recognized that Natalie had the power to take away Marty's career but revealed that she no longer cared about her career, only her son.  Marty cried that she had seen Cole's hope turn to despair in the prison, and that everything she had loved about her son was gone.  Natalie said that she was sorry, but that Cole had murdered a man.\n\n\nNatalie claimed that her lie to John was not a crime, and that she did not deserve to be punished by Marty.  However, Marty speculated that she could wait to tell John the truth -- until the child was in kindergarten, or in a little league ballgame, or until Cole was released from prison, or never at all.  \"See, the whole good part is that you will never know.\"\n\n\nNatalie told Marty that she should have been a better mother to Cole, so that Marty would not have to get revenge.  Natalie claimed that Marty did not care if she hurt John, however, Marty reminded Natalie that it was Natalie who had hurt John.  Natalie wondered what would happen if Natalie revealed the truth to John, and then told him that Marty had been torturing her.  When Marty snapped, \"You don't have the guts,\" Natalie replied, \"We'll see.\"  Natalie grabbed her coat, and ran out the door.\n\n\nMarty looked at the picture of Cole and stated, \"I mean, honey, if I'm going to use this, I've...I've gotta do it when it's right.  You know, I want to destroy Natalie.  You know, I've got to do what's the best for me and the worst for her.\"\n\n\nNatalie walked through the Llanfair front door and spotted John's coat on the staircase.  After she thought again about Marty's threat, Natalie picked up the coat, held it to her face, and said, \"You deserve to know the truth, John.  About everything.  About Brody, the baby, and you, Marty.\"\n\n\nAs John poked the roaring fire in the fireplace, Natalie entered the living room.  John remarked, \"Hey, I didn't hear you come in.\"  When Natalie said, \"I need to talk to you,\" John insisted, \"I need to talk to you.\"  Natalie claimed, \"Me first,\" but John pleaded, \"No, you always go first.  Let me go first this time.\"  Natalie relented.  \"Okay, what's up?\"  John lowered himself to one knee and asked, \"Will you marry me?\" \n\n\n",
