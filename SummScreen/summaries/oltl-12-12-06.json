Nash listens as they all reminisce about the past Christmas times that they have shared together. Clint asks Nash if he would like to help him string the lights on the Christmas tree and Nash agrees. When Clint wonders if Nash would like to start on the top or the bottom of the tree, Nash tells him that since he has never decorated a tree he would follow Clint's lead. Jessica tells Nash that she remembers the conversations that Nash had with Tess regarding his growing up in foster homes and never really having any Christmas memories. Nash is grateful that Bree will be spending a loving and family oriented Christmas day. When Jessica wonders if Nash is going to have a tree, Nash tells her that the tree they have is enough for Bree so he has decided not to decorate for Christmas. \n\n\nTodd noses around trying to find out what Bo knows about Spencer's transport to Wingdale. When Bo begins to question Todd about Spencer's escape, Todd acts insulted. Marty also stops by and learns that Spencer has disappeared on the way to Wingdale. After Todd's departure, Bo questions Marty about her testimony which led to Spencer being hospitalized instead of going to prison. Marty feels that Spencer was not faking his illness and even if he was, all of the things he did to Todd show that he has some issues that he needs psychiatric help for. Bo asks Marty if she feels that Todd had anything to do with Spencer's disappearance and although Marty is hesitant to give any professional opinions about Todd, she does tell Bo that he should keep his eye on Todd.\n\n\nAs the water torture begins to affect Spencer, he hallucinates about Blair. In his first hallucination, Blair comes to rescue him as she proclaims her love for Spencer and her hatred for Todd. In the second hallucination, Blair laughs in Spencer's face for thinking that she would come to his rescue since she loathes him and is in love with Todd.

Kelly finds out that Blair is pregnant but unsure of the paternity of her baby. Kelly shares with them her good news that she is able to take Zane home and that since he has been cleared to travel, she is eager to leave as soon as possible to join Kevin in London. Dorian tries to talk Kelly out of going but Kelly asks her to be happy for her, Kevin, and Zane now that they have found each other again and have a real chance at happiness. Although Dorian doesn't agree she tells Kelly that she loves her and that if she feels that she can really be happy with Kevin then Dorian won't stand in her way. Kelly is grateful and takes Zane to visit the Buchanan's while Dorian comforts Blair who is distraught that she will have to wait a week to find out the results of the DNA test. Dorian eases Blair's mind somewhat by telling her that she pulled some favors so that Blair would have the results the next day. Back at home, Todd comes home while Blair and Dorian are chatting. He wonders about her doctor's visit and Blair tells him that the tumor has not returned but she is still waiting on the results of the test to find out what is going on with her.

John is furious but does a good job of not letting Natalie see how upset he is. John asks Cris to let Evangeline know that she did a good job and it's not her fault that Spencer is getting a light sentence. John sends Natalie on an errand to find him something to drink and she thanks Cris for being such a good friend to John. Cris reminds her that he is also her friend and that she shouldn't be going through this alone. While Natalie is in the hall with Cris, John calls Michael and tells him that he must get his surgeries pushed through as quickly as possible so that he can bring Spencer to justice himself. A seething Natalie walks in and informs John that he is not going after Spencer.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Spencer curses as he tries to free himself. He vows to kill Todd. His wrists are bloody from trying to damage the structure that holds him, and that water constantly dripping on his forehead is driving him crazy. \"I'm fine! I'm fine!\" he shouts to himself. Soon a bright light has flooded the room. \"You came. I am so glad to see you!\" It is Blair she wears a gold trenchcoat and when she takes it off, she has a skimpy, sexy dress on underneath. She swings her hips as she walks towards him and she undoes his cuffs, kissing him. \"I hate what Todd did to you.\" He is so glad that she hates Todd. They go to a corner in the storage room and fall to the floor to make love It has all been a dream. He has hallucinated the whole thing. No one is there and he is still tied up with duct tape. \"Blair?\" he calls out quietly. No one is there. Todd is at the police station and he is told that Spencer is missing. Todd fakes anger at that. Marty comes to the office and overhears Todd and Bo talking about Spencer. \"What happened to Spencer?\" She learns that he is missing. Bo is interested about why Todd has come there. He says that he came there to ask about what the hell went on in court. He leaves the office now to go. Marty follows him and asks if they can talk for a minute. \"We both have to live in this town, so we have to learn to co-exist.\" He orders her to stay away from him and to keep her kid away from his. Antonio and Bo are watching the two talk through the blinds and their Spidey sense tell them that Todd is all involved in this. They could pick him up as a person of interest, but they decide instead that they can learn more by leaving Todd alone and putting a trace on him. Marty returns to Bo's office, and Antonio looks like he smells something bad when he walks by her and leaves the room. \"I get that a lot,\" she explains. Bo thinks that she shouldn't be surprised. She has come to the station to tell Bo that she has applied for a job there as Profiler and with the way that people have been treating her, she thinks that it would be better if he just teared up her application. \"Are you sure you want me to do that?\" She is. She leaves the office and once alone, Bo gets out her application and reads. Spencer sees Blair again. This time she has a black leather coat on. \"Help me!\" She asks him why she should when she hates him. He reminds her that it is Todd that she hates. She denies it and he chokes her while she struggles It's all a dream, but still he calls for Blair while his hands are not balled up into red little fists. \"Come back Blair!\" he shouts angrily. \"Come back!\"",
