The girls promise Dorian they won't get involved if they do hear from him. Viki arrives at the door, and Dorian invites her in. The ladies catch up briefly, then Viki asks where Todd is. Dorian informs Viki that Todd and Blair are remarried. Starr gives her Aunt Viki a big hug. Viki asks how Cole is and where he is. Starr tells Viki that Cole shot Miles. Viki is horrified and comforts Starr, who is oddly together about the whole thing. The girls leave to go to a pretend assembly at school. Viki and Dorian sit down, and Dorian snottily brings Viki up to date on everything she missed while she was on her extended vacation. Viki says she's going to go back to Paris as soon as she can, and that Dorian's the one who put her on her new path. Viki says Dorian's words at Asa's funeral were a wake-up call. Dorian mentions she was in Paris, Texas, and Viki suppresses a grin. Viki tells Dorian that David filled her in on all of Dorian's recent adventures, including her embarrassing breakup with Clint. Dorian mentions a very handsome and charming man came to her rescue after being hit by the car. Dorian says that her cheating on Clint was actually Viki's fault, because when Viki cheated on Clint way back when, it meant that Clint now thinks all women are unstable and fickle. They toss French proverbs at each other. Dorian gets irritated and leaves, with Viki saying she'll just stay and wait for Todd. Gigi calls Viki on her cell phone, saying Charlie's in a bad way and he really needs her. \n\n\nMarcie, in a new wig and glasses and the waitress uniform, talks to Gigi as she prepares for her first shift at the Bon-Jour Caf\u00e9. Marcie's nearly hysterical about Michael having been arrested. Gigi tries to comfort her. They head over to the diner. They establish that Marcie is replacing Viki, who just quit, and that Moe is paying Marcie under the table. Marcie tries to call the babysitter to make sure Tommy's okay, but Gigi promises her they're fine. Marcie really starts to freak out over the fact that she's waitressing tables in the middle of Texas. Later, at the Caf\u00e9, Moe lectures Marcie on how to do her job. Marcie is going by the name of Sally Ann. Noelle and Gigi give her some support. Charlie shows up, clearly bombed, with a bottle of vodka in his hand. Gigi and Noelle deal with Charlie. When \"Sally Ann\" arrives with a cup of coffee, Charlie thinks he recognizes her. Marcie deflects him and Gigi helps. He tearfully shouts about sons and fathers and is grateful that Viki's not there to see him. Gigi helps him across the street to his room. Moe and Noelle agree that it's a good thing Viki wasn't there to see Charlie in his condition. Marcie and Noelle crash into each other and a bunch of food spills. \n\n\nTalia brings a handcuffed Michael to Bo's office. Michael doesn't want a lawyer; he wants to see John.

Bo snaps that it isn't Lee's jurisdiction. John arrives at the station to see Michael in handcuffs. Lee confronts John and orders him to tell Bo who shot Miles. John says he needs to talk to Michael.

John says Lee's telling lies. Lee busts a gasket, yelling at John. John tells Bo that he shot Miles. \n\n\nTalia runs into Antonio in the hallway and they compare cases. Antonio doesn't want to talk shop. He says they're not the way they used to be with each other. Talia says \"things change\". Antonio says then from now on, it will just be two cops on the job, and Talia says that works for her, and walks away. \n\n\nJohn is still trying to contact Cole. Natalie arrives and asks John who shot Miles. He tells her it was an accident and Natalie questions his story. She asks him directly if he shot Miles. John tries to deny it. Miles' doctor shows up and tells them that Miles pulled through with a collapsed lung. John gets a call from Michael. Natalie asks John again why all of a sudden Miles is so important to John, but again, he says nothing. He tells her to take care of herself and heads to the police station. Natalie gets permission to visit with Miles for a moment. Starr shows up outside Miles' room. Natalie leaves, and Starr sneaks in and asks Miles if he knows who did this to him, and he says that Cole shot him. \n\n\nLangston and Starr arrive at Langston's old house, where Cole has been hiding out. He had a rough night and couldn't sleep. No one's heard about Miles yet. Starr leaves but won't tell them where she's going. Cole and Langston bond over having both lost a parent. Cole tells Langston more about how Marty died, and how he remembers his mom. Langston says he's just like her, and this upsets him. He misses his mom. Langston tells him how her grief has subsided a bit. Cole says Marty would be so ashamed of him right now. Langston says he's a good person.
