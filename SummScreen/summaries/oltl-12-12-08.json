Realizing that Starr needed someone to listen to her and not offer advice, Dorian allowed Starr the opportunity to relate her feelings. Dorian listened as Starr discussed the loss of her child and her feelings towards Todd. Instead of judging Todd, Dorian kept quiet as Starr vented about her father. Starr told Dorian that she wanted Todd to pay for his crimes, but didn't want to turn into her mother. Starr related that Blair always forgave Todd no matter how much pain he caused her. Starr feared that she might do the same. When Starr expressed her concern that Blair might take Todd back eventually, Dorian was convinced that Blair had witnessed Todd at his worst. Dorian assured Starr that Blair was done with Todd. Dorian told Starr that she wasn't worried about her because Starr was stronger than both her parents. Dorian's words comforted Starr. \n\n\nWhen Cole arrived at the courthouse to attend Todd's arraignment, he encountered Nora, who was preparing her case against Todd. Nora suggested that Cole not attend the hearing and promised to bring Todd to justice. Cole was adamant that he wanted to be present when Todd was forced to pay for all the misery he had caused. Sensing that Cole was troubled, Nora asked him to share his feelings. Still feeling the pain of burying his infant daughter, Cole told Nora that aside from the memory loss, his mother was a different person. Cole feared that Todd had killed his mother's spirit. While Cole believed that Todd would never admit guilt, Nora was certain that she had convinced Todd to plead guilty. \n\n\nSarah paid Viki a visit at Llanfair. When Viki asked what was troubling her niece, Sarah said that she feared that she was losing Cristian to another woman. The conversation quickly turned to Sarah missing her mother. Assuring Sarah that her mother loved her, Viki admitted to playing a role in Tina's departure. Sarah was certain that her mother had done something terrible, and begged Viki to explain. Unwilling to give Sarah the horrible details of Tina's actions, Viki told her that Tina was often guilty of making wrong choices. In Tina's absence, Viki offered to be a mother figure to Sarah. In desperate need of someone to talk to, Sarah told Viki about Vanessa. Acknowledging that Vanessa did appear to have an interest in Cris, Vanessa suggested that Sarah trust him. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cris and Vanessa explained to T\u00e9a that Vanessa couldn't marry a U.S. citizen because she was already married to Ray Montez. After learning the details of Ray's shooting and the reason Vanessa feared being sent back to Colombia, T\u00e9a decided to place a few calls and find out if Vanessa was legally married to Ray. While waiting to receive word of Vanessa's marital status, T\u00e9a questioned whether Vanessa had actually set Ray up for the murder of his wife. When Vanessa denied framing Ray, T\u00e9a appeared to accept her explanation. T\u00e9a believed that the only way Vanessa could stay in the country was if she married a U.S. citizen. When Cris wondered if the act would be considered legal, T\u00e9a suggested that Vanessa marry someone that she loved. Cris and Vanessa shared a nervous glance. \n\n\nTo Vanessa's delight, T\u00e9a discovered that Vanessa's divorce had been finalized several weeks earlier. T\u00e9a suggested that Vanessa find a good man and get married right away. Later, Vanessa asked Cris if he believed it was a good idea for her to marry a citizen. Cris stated that he was in favor of anything that would keep Vanessa and Lola in the country. Cris asked Vanessa if she would consider marrying a citizen. Declaring that she was determined to fight to stay in the country, Vanessa asked Cris to marry her. \n\n\nTodd was upset when Blair brought Jack to visit him in jail. Insisting that she could no longer keep the truth from him, Blair demanded that Todd tell Jack the reason he was in jail. Todd struggled to explain the reason for his incarceration to Jack, but Jack wanted answers. Avoiding the vivid details, Todd admitted to hurting Marty in the past. He explained that he had lied to her about Cole's existence and didn't reveal his true identity to her. As Blair listened in disgust, Todd admitted that he had planned to run away with Marty and never tell anyone. \n\n\nAfter hearing his father's confession, Jack flew into a fit of rage. Jack couldn't believe that his father had considered leaving him. Expressing his love for his son, Todd told Jack that he had made wrong choices. After calming Jack down, Todd told his son to behave while he was away. When Jack asked how long Todd would be in jail, Blair interrupted. She explained that Todd would probably be away for a long time. Once Jack had been escorted into another room, Blair expressed her disgust with Todd. She told him that he was a terrible father. Ignoring Blair's tongue-lashing, Todd asked about Starr. Walking away, Blair told him that Starr had buried her child - the child that Todd had planned to steal. Moments later, a guard came to escort Todd to his arraignment. \n\n\nMarty stood alone at the church and vowed to seek revenge against Todd. She turned around and was surprised to find John standing there. When Marty wondered exactly how much John had overheard, he stated that he was concerned about her. Insisting that he didn't need to protect her, Marty asked if Blair was aware that he had come looking for Marty. John explained that Blair knew of his concern for Marty, but Marty continued to question John about his relationship with Blair. Uncomfortable with Marty's harshness, John offered to leave her alone. Realizing that she had lashed out at John, Marty apologized and blamed her behavior on her problems. When Marty stated that she had an appointment, John offered her a ride. Accepting his offer, Marty announced that she wanted to attend Todd's arraignment. \n\n\nWhen Blair and Jack returned home, Dorian and Starr questioned why Blair would take Jack to see Todd in jail. Blair was adamant that Jack needed to hear the truth from his father. Blair and Starr left to attend Todd's arraignment. \n\n\nIn the courthouse elevator, Marty thanked John for not discouraging her from going to the arraignment. She remarked that he and Todd were very different. John advised Marty not to get her hopes up, and insisted that Todd might use underhanded tactics to defend himself. Marty said that she was looking forward to the arraignment. When the elevator doors opened, reporters besieged Marty and John. As Cole appeared and attempted to help his mother, Todd was ushered down the hall. Marty and Todd stood face-to-face. Cole, John, and Nora asked Marty if she was certain that she wanted to attend the hearing. Marty announced that she wanted to see Todd's face when he entered a guilty plea. \n\n\nInside the courtroom, Todd stared at Marty. Stating that there was a particular charge that she wanted Marty's approval to submit against Todd, Nora asked Marty to go over the charge in private. Nora told Marty that she would only add the charge if Marty agreed to it. \n\n\nAs the hearing commenced, Blair and Starr entered the courtroom. \n\n\nAs Nora read the charges against Todd, he was stunned when she read the last charge - rape. Stunned, Todd stared across the room at Marty. Todd announced to the court that he didn't have a lawyer and was defending himself. When the judge asked him to enter the plea, Todd remembered Nora's deal for him - stating that he would actually plead guilty if he loved Marty the way he professed to. As he attempted to answer, T\u00e9a stormed into the courtroom and ordered him not to utter another word. \n\n\n",
