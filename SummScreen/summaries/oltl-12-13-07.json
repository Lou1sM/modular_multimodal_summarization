She thinks he's just feeling guilty for not tying up loose ends with Evangeline while Sarah complains to Layla that she can't go after Cris because he's still hung up on Evangeline plus he's her boss. \"He's just feeling guilty, \" Layla insists. They were broken up and so there was nothing between them any longer. As for him, he's unable to make a decision, Cris complains. Blair suggests he visit Evangeline and see how he feels. Responding to his protest that her mother won't allow him in, Blair reminds him that he doesn't usually play by the rules so he needs to find a way. He asks Layla to check her mother for permission. Vincent admits to thinking about the future and his work with Lindsay's gallery. Blair confesses that Todd is under her skin (like ringworm, Cris notes) and she always ends up back with him.\n\n\nViki finally gets to see her brother; she learns that he married Blair just to get his son back though she got something out of it too. She attempts to give him advice but he calls her a know it all. She comes home, doesn't know what's going on, and tries to give advice when she doesn't follow it herself, he complains. He admits that now he can't imagine his life without Blair but he's afraid of screwing things up. Viki confides that she's thinking of returning to Paris as her friend is having a problem. The world went on without her and things would still be the same whether she were there or not, Todd advises her.  If her friend, who he assumes is a guy, needs her, then she should go.

Viki disagrees; he has Blair and she can see that Todd is doing well. Later, Todd orders a flower arrangement for Marty, but he wants it sent anonymously.\n\n\nAt the police station, John denies Lee's interpretation of Miles' shooting and instead confesses to the crime himself! It was an accident, he claims. Lee can hardly believe it and the two men almost come to blows. He will be in big trouble for lying in yet another investigation, the FBI agent threatens. He heads to the hospital and Bo asks John to level with him. He's already lost everything, the former cop replies. Talia is short with Antonio when he wants to address their now awkward meetings. Talia finally loses her temper and calls him an arrogant, insensitive bastard, to which Antonio can only say \"now we're getting somewhere.\" She doesn't want to be his friend, he doesn't have feelings for her, he knew how she felt and still he led her on, she begins to yell. She looked like a jackass. Antonio claims to not have realized any of it, just feeling ill at ease himself and not knowing what to say. She thinks he could have thrown out a few hints as to what he was thinking after her ridiculous boyfriend story, she admonishes. He just needs to figure it all out, she orders, leaving. Antonio receives a call from his daughter about dinner; the little girl asks if Talia can come too. He tells her no. Talia fills out a request for reassignment form. \n\n\nStarr learns from a sedated Miles that Cole shot him.

Nat apologizes for accusing John of the shooting but he surprises her by saying she was right all along. A shocked Starr overhears. Nat thinks John is lying and tells him so when the other men go into Miles' room. He's protecting someone, isn't he? she asks. What would his motive have been? She doesn't buy it for a minute, even if it's to vindicate all of the awful things that Miles did. He and Marty must have really been in love. A heavily sedated Miles awakens enough to respond to Bo's questions. \n\n\nLangston and Cole are quick to hide when they hear voices. It's a realtor and a prospective buyer, come to look at her parents' house. The house is sterile looking, the realtor proclaims, but it's a steal. They note the love that must have been there. Cole realizes he will have to find someplace else to hide due to an open house the realty company will be having. Langston assures him that she and Starr and Markko will be there to help him. Langston is sad to think of all of her things, her only connections to her family, her memories, that will be gone soon. Cole can relate and they comfort each other. Cole thinks Langston's parents would be proud of her, as opposed to his own non-violent parents who would feel disrespected for his having killed someone. Starr returns with amazing news.
