He tried to make up an excuse, but the maid was certain that Rex was breaking in, and she threatened to call for the manager. Rex assured her that he would leave. Once she was gone, he returned to the room and began to pick at the lock again. Suddenly, his phone rang.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, John surprised Natalie and proposed, because he thought it just felt like the right time. He was stumped when Natalie ran out of the room, and as time passed, he grew disheartened. Out in the foyer, Natalie placed a phone call to Rex. He informed her that it was not a good time to talk, but Natalie insisted that he tell her what he had said to John earlier that day to make John propose. \"This is great news,\" Rex exclaimed. Natalie didn't think it was great; she was mystified at John's timing. \"You're making no sense,\" Rex advised his sister. Natalie was certain that Rex must have said something to John to make him want to propose.\n\n\nNatalie agreed that she wanted to marry John, but she was concerned about Marty. The doctor had consented to keep her mouth shut for the time being, but Natalie was certain that the marriage proposal would throw Marty over the edge. Rex urged Natalie to give John an answer. \"Be happy Natalie. Take a chance,\" Rex said before he hung up.\n\n\nNatalie finally returned to John, and he told her to take time with her answer. He suggested she check her sock drawer or help him check the antifreeze in the car. Natalie explained that she'd been in the bathroom, but John wasn't feeling too confident. She apologized and clarified that his proposal had been totally unexpected. \"It feels right to me,\" he said. It was about their baby and family. Natalie wanted to make sure that she'd heard him right.\n\n\nShe verified that he wanted to get married solely because they were having a baby. She noted that the baby would have plenty of family members around. \"You don't know me very well, do you?\" John asked. Those weren't the only reasons for the proposal. Natalie just didn't want him to feel obligated. \"I love you,\" John declared. \"Is that a problem?\" Natalie grabbed his hand. \"It's all perfect,\" she promised him.\n\n\nHe could see why it could be a problem, though, with her gun-toting father and her crazy brothers. He thought that he could \"take them on\" for Natalie. He could take a lot for her. Natalie began to weep, as John assured her she was worth it. He was worried though. She was crying, and she hadn't answered his question yet. \"Say yes,\" he implored her. Finally, she accepted, and he began to kiss her.\n\n\nMatthew arrived at Nate's apartment and found the front door open. He walked inside and gasped. Bo and Inez were sitting on the couch, and they were kissing. Matthew backed out into the hallway. \"It's true. Clint was right. They're cheating on each other,\" he said to himself. He was upset, and he leaned up against the wall. Slowly, he sank to the ground.\n\n\nAt Rourke's Gym, Eddie promised to return the following morning for the fight with Ford. James called his father a chicken, and Eddie pushed James aside. Ford slugged Eddie, and Eddie roared and barreled into Ford, who landed on the floor. Eddie jumped on top of Ford and began to slap at him, until Brody and Nate managed to break it up. Ford was in obvious pain. Unnoticed, James looked at the gun he had stolen from Eddie's bag earlier.\n\n\nFord stood up, but Eddie head-butted him, and Ford fell back to the floor, unconscious. Eddie claimed victory and announced he would not be leaving town. Dani, Langston, and Starr fussed over Ford as he lay still. Eddie yelled for Ford to get up, and Ford finally opened his eyes. The girls wanted Ford to go to the hospital, but he refused. Dani ran off to get some ice. Eddie pointed out that Ford had thrown a sucker-punch first.\n\n\nFord advised his father to stay away from James, but Eddie mocked James and noted that Ford had gone to \"Janie's\" rescue. James informed his father that he was no longer afraid of him, and he kept his hand securely planted on the gun that was hidden in his pocket.  Dani returned with the ice for Ford. Eddie gloated and announced, \"Well ladies, looks like my job is done here for now.\" He told them he had business to attend to elsewhere.\n\n\nDani stepped in front of Eddie and told him that he couldn't leave. \"What did you have in mind?\" he asked her. Nate rushed at his father and yelled at him to stay away from Dani. Brody held Nate back, and Eddie chuckled. He thought that Dani might have an \"offer\" for him. \n\n\nBrody ordered Eddie to leave, though all of the girls wanted Brody to arrest Eddie. Eddie reminded them that Ford had thrown the first punch, and Brody would have to arrest Ford as well. Brody agreed that was true. Eddie thought that perhaps he should press charges, but Brody advised him that while Eddie had defended himself, Eddie had also instigated the fight.\n\n\nBrody proclaimed that Eddie's attorney had already filed a couple of motions against the police department, and there could be a harassment suit. Off to the side, Brody whispered to Ford that if Eddie were arrested, it would be more difficult to track him after he was released. Ford understood. Brody urged Eddie to watch his step, and he suggested that Eddie leave town. Eddie insisted he had business there. James repeated that Eddie should leave, and Eddie wondered what James might do about it. \"Tempt me,\" James replied.\n\n\nStarr didn't like the way James was acting, and she pulled him away from Eddie. She thought that they should take Ford to the hospital, even though he didn't want to go. Eddie left finally, and Brody told everyone to stay away from Eddie. Nate reminded Brody that Eddie lived with James and Ford, but Brody thought that Eddie would remain in the motel room he had been using. James walked out to clear his head, and Starr warned him not to follow Eddie. \n\n\nLangston finally put her foot down and advised Ford that they would take him to the hospital. She pointed out that Ford had been kicked in the same spot where he'd been hurt previously. Ford was worried about Eddie, but Langston reminded him about the motel room. She joked that she had been willing to give up her \"no sex pledge\" for Ford, so she thought the least he could do for her was to have someone look at his ribs. Starr was scared for James.\n\n\nDani received a phone call, and she walked away from the group. It was Matthew. \"You're not the only one who cheats. Everyone cheats,\" Matthew said. He began to ramble, and Dani was confused. Matthew was in his car, and he began to cry that he was the only stupid one. He was angry at his father, and he had a message for Dani's boyfriend. Nate's mother was a \"whore and a bitch and a home wrecker.\" He hung up abruptly.\n\n\nNate found Dani, and he could see that something was wrong. She denied it. Nate asked about the phone call, and she admitted that she was \"freaked out.\" It had been from Matthew, and he'd said some crazy things about Inez. He'd called Inez some vicious names. Nate was livid. He wondered why Matthew would have anything to say about Inez. Dani confessed that it had been weird, and she'd never heard Matthew talk like that. She didn't think they had time to worry about Matthew though.\n\n\nNate vowed that he'd figure out how to get rid of Eddie. He couldn't even believe that Eddie was his father, after he'd wondered about him for so many years. \"Not in any way that counts,\" Dani reassured him. \"I want him gone,\" Eddie stated. He wished he could press a button and have Eddie disappear like an edit in a movie. \"Life doesn't work like that,\" Dani advised him. \"Maybe it does,\" Nate replied.\n\n\nThey joined the others. Starr admitted that she'd heard the conversation between James and Eddie, and she'd seen the look in James's eyes. She was worried, because James had seemed too calm. Ford thought that he'd better look for James, but Langston wouldn't hear of it. She and Starr helped Ford out of the gym. Dani wanted to know what Nate had meant by his own comment, but he wouldn't discuss it. He suggested that she go with the others, and he would remain behind to call his mother. He promised that things would be okay.\n\n\nInez got up from the couch and held out her hand to Bo. She wanted him to accompany her to the bedroom. \"I think there's a big misunderstanding,\" Bo said to Inez weakly. She apologized and maintained that she had been desperate. She sat back down. Bo shushed her and stated that she didn't have to explain. It was all his fault, because he shouldn't have mentioned Sam, he informed her.\n\n\nInez realized that Bo was still under the influence of the drug she had given him with his beer, and he thought she was Nora. She played along and agreed with him. She told him it was all over just as he wanted. Bo was happy that she'd returned to him, though he didn't understand why she'd left. He mentioned the text messages he'd received, and he apologized again. He loved her. Inez lay in his arms on the couch and began to cry. Bo comforted her. \"Your husband is right here,\" he said.\n\n\nShortly after, Bo slept on the couch. Inez looked down at him and said, \"Don't worry, Bo. You didn't betray your wife.\" Inez was concerned. She hadn't held up her end of the deal, and that meant that Clint wouldn't hold up his end. She didn't know how she would be able to get rid of Eddie.\n\n\nNate called Inez and explained that he and Dani had stopped at the gym. There had been a fight, though it hadn't been the official one, and Ford had gone to the hospital. He wondered if Eddie had always been the same way, but Inez didn't answer. She advised him not to worry and to stay away from Eddie. She hung up and looked around the room. She saw Bo's holstered gun draped across a chair.\n\n\nFinally, Rex picked the lock on the motel room door and walked inside. \"Holy!\" he sputtered and stopped. \"Nora!\" he called out. Nora whimpered in relief. Rex ripped off her gag and began to undo her bindings. Nora couldn't believe that she'd heard Rex stop for a phone call during his rescue mission. \n\n\nRex informed her that he hadn't known she was there. \"What are you doing here? A little B and E?\" Nora asked. Rex confessed that he was conducting an investigation for someone. She informed him that Eddie was behind her kidnapping, and she begged Rex to hurry and get her untied before Eddie returned, because Eddie had a gun.\n\n\nNora couldn't wait to see Eddie in court, and she began to lay out a list of charges that she'd cite him with. Her arms and legs were numb, and she was jumpy. Rex noticed that her jacket was unbuttoned, and he offered to help her to button it up. He got her a glass of water.\n\n\nNora demanded that Rex try to call Bo, but Rex only reached Bo's voicemail. Nora urged him to try Bo's work cell phone. She told him that Inez had wanted to break up Bo and Nora's marriage, and Rex thought that was crazy. Nora was worried that Inez might have been successful. She was certain that Inez and Eddie were working together, because Eddie was too stupid to have had the idea himself. Nora stood up shakily, and Rex tried to calm her down so they could walk to his car.\n\n\nShortly after, Rex and Nora were in the car, and Nora told him about the argument she'd had with Bo. She informed him of the phony texts that Bo would have thought he'd received from Nora. She begged Rex to go faster, but Rex reminded her that the roads were icy. Nora was panicked. She had to get to Bo. Rex gently asked her if she'd been raped. Nora shook her head, but she was convinced that she would have been, if Eddie hadn't been determined to keep an appointment first. She began to cry.\n\n\nMatthew continued to drive and cry. He flashed back to what he'd seen in Nate's apartment. He recalled his toast at his parents' wedding. His parents had lied to him. He wondered why they'd even gotten married when it meant nothing. He shouted out loud about his family, and he realized that Clint was the only person who ever told the truth. Matthew began to fiddle with his phone, and he stepped down harder on the gas pedal.\n\n\nNora was sure that Eddie couldn't destroy her marriage with the few texts he'd sent. She saw some old fries in the car and realized she was famished. Rex stopped her from grabbing the fries, but suddenly there was a car in their path. Then there was a crash.\n\n\n\"Honey, I'm home. Did you miss me?\" Eddie called out as he entered his motel room. The room was empty, and he looked around. He began to gather his things and looked in his bag for his gun. \"Where is it?\" he muttered. \"It's right here,\" James replied as he walked into the room with the gun pointed at his father. \"How'd you get in here, and what the hell are you doing with my gun?\" Eddie inquired. \"What does it look like?\" James retorted.\n\n\nBrody walked in on John and Natalie as they kissed. He turned to leave, but John stopped him. Brody told him about the fight at the gym and how he hoped that Eddie would leave town. John excitedly said that he and Natalie had some news, but Natalie cut John off. \"No we don't,\" she said. \"I think this might qualify as news,\" John argued with her. Natalie smiled and explained that they'd been planning a surprise engagement party for Brody and Jessica. She wanted Brody to pretend he hadn't heard anything. Brody agreed, and he left.\n\n\nJohn wondered why Natalie had lied and why she was keeping their own engagement a secret. Natalie thought that the engagement should just be for the two of them for a while. She knew as soon as they announced it publicly, everyone would want to share their ideas with them. She wanted it to be \"just ours.\" John accepted her rationalization without question.\n\n\nSeveral hours later, Eddie was lying on the floor of his motel room. He had a gunshot wound to the chest, and he appeared to be dead.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie has still not revealed her secret to John after he's proposed to her. She is very uneasy and asks Rex what she should do. Rex tries to encourage his sister, but she is clearly not sure, since John is still unaware that Brody could be the father of her baby. Rex is on this mission investigating Eddie for Todd Manning. He enters the motel room and is surprised to see Nora tied to a chair and she's equally surprised to see him. He unties her and drives her home. She informs him that Eddie attempted to break up her and Bo and she knows that Bo might be through with her and that Eddie almost raped her. Meanwhile, Inez has drugged Bo. He keeps seeing her as Nora and she knows she cannot go through with trying to get him into bed when he's clearly in love with his wife and drugged. Eddie assaults Robert at the gym and everybody wants him gone. Yet Brody tells everybody that the cops cannot do anything since Eddie's lawyer has filed charges. All they can do is leave Eddie alone and hope he leaves town on his own. James finds a gun and goes to find Eddie. Eddie returns to the motel room to find that Nora is not there and James finds him. Matthew is distraught after seeing his father in Inez's apartment kissing her. He drives in the storm believing that both of his parents are hypocrites and have betrayed him. He calls Nate and tells him his mother is a whore, a bitch and a home wrecker. It appears that he collides with Rex and Nora and there may be an accident. Eddie is on the floor after being shot.",
