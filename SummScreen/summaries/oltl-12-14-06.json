Claudia sobbed. Antonio assured Claudia that she wouldn't lose her job but encouraged her to go to AA meetings. She should sing but not hang out at the bar. Claudia left Llanfair, but not before she had a testy exchange with Jessica. Claudia accused Jessica of keeping Nash on a string in case her marriage didn't work out. Jessica said she was going to set Nash up with a nice woman, but that she wouldn't be Claudia. \n\n\nLayla told Rex that someone was trying to invest in their company. Layla was concerned that maybe Vincent was investing. Rex said it wasn't Vincent, but he thought he knew exactly who it was. \n\n\nDorian hoped that Adriana would stay for lunch with Kelly. Adriana was glad everything was working out for Kelly and Kevin. Dorian began lecturing Adriana about forgiveness. Adriana brought up the stalker. Dorian admitted to having made mistakes. Adriana accused Dorian of leaving her in Puerto Rico because she was a Santi, and she accused Dorian of not making sacrifices for her. Dorian repeated that she loved her. Adriana replied she couldn't love someone she didn't trust. Adriana said goodbye to Zane and then left. Layla thought it was a shame that Adriana was losing her mother. Layla said it was bad karma for Adriana to want to get back at her mother. \n\n\nDorian assured Rex that she wasn't giving up on Adriana. Rex found out that Dorian was giving money to Adriana's company. Rex decided not to tell Adriana this tidbit of information. \n\n\nEvangeline called Todd and asked him if he had anything to do with Spencer's disappearance. Todd lied but was grateful that Evangeline was talking to him again. Blair took the kids to Dorian's for lunch and left Todd. \"Don't read anything too dangerous,\" she said. Todd immediately called the governor's office. Moments later, Bo reported to Evangeline that the governor had called him to take the tail off of Todd. Bo wondered what Todd could be up to. \n\n\nSpencer continued to hallucinate that he was having a conversation with his mother. He relived the time when his mother divulged that Asa was his father. \"Make them all pay,\" she begged. Spencer, still undergoing the water torture, renewed his vow that he'd make every last Buchanan pay. Todd returned, gun in hand. \"Hi, Spence. Did you miss me?\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Layla calls Rex to come and see her. She wonders if this person who is interested in investing in Adriana's company is Vincent. Rex assures her that it isn't. Adriana is at Kelly's place with Dorian having a visit. Adriana hates it when her mother starts talking about forgiveness and leaves. Rex shows up and says that he has figured out that Dorian was the one who set up the 'investor' call to Adriana. Dorian admits it. She set up a holding company to enable her to donate money to companies. She isn't ashamed of it. Rex feels that her idea was to put Adriana in situation where when she figured out who was giving her the money, she would just forgive. Dorian admits it. She is desperate to have her daughter back. At the apartment, Layla and Adriana hit the sewing machines to crank out boxers for her company. Layla learned to sew in college, while Adriana learned from the nuns. Adriana starts telling of how things went with her mother at Kelly's place. Dorian is spewing love and she wishes that the woman would go back to fighting and arguing. Adriana can deal with that better. She hopes that Layla will not be going home to see her folks this Christmas so that they can work on more pieces and have a lot to show people. Then her mother will find out how wonderful her things are and she will finally see that she isn't needed. Layla tells Adriana to stop this. It is okay not to want to have anything to do with her mother but to plan to get back at her is just wrong. Rex arrives and asks how things went saying goodbye to Kelly at her place. \"You know, every time that I see my mother I realize how much I am glad to be rid of her.\" Jessica and Antonio are wrapping presents at Viki's place. Claudia shows up the same time that Nash does. She is there to drop off the previous nights receipts, and Nash is there to visit with Bree. Claudia is surprised that he can just come and go as he wants. She watches in awe as Nash and Jessica run upstairs to see the baby while Antonio remains in the living room. He can tell that she's been drinking. She promises to see her sponsor. Antonio is on a call and so Claudia leaves the room. She finds Jessica alone in the hall. Jessica is quick to tell the woman that Nash is off limits. Claudia finds it rich that Jessica wants to keep the man on a string while married to another. She threatens to tell Antonio. \"If that were true, why would I be setting him up?\" Claudia knows the only person that Nash is interested in is that nutty chick inside Jessica. Nash comes down and Jessica unveils her idea. \"It's time to get you dating, what kind of woman do you like?\"",

I'm not going to let you get away with anything, no matter how much you try to deny it.\" \"I don't know who you are,\" Spencer said.\n"
