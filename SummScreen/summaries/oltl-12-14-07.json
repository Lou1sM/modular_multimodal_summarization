After accepting his compliments, Sarah notices that Cris has other things on his mind and asks him about his conversation with Blair.  Sarah wants to know if it was regarding Evangeline; she believes they should discuss such matters if they are going to be friends.  Cris tells her he is not so sure if he is ready to become friends with her; he has too much to work out concerning his feelings for Evangeline.  He tells Sarah about breaking up with Evangeline because he could not handle her close relationship with Todd; he further blames himself for Evangeline being in his apartment the night of the fire.  Cris admits to Sarah that Blair asked him if Evangeline was the woman of his life and he is not certain.  He further stated that Blair suggests he find out so that he can move on with his life; the only way he can do that is if he sees her.  Cris tells Sarah that it is impossible for him to see Evangeline because her mother will not allow him to visit.  Sarah suggests that he finds a way to see Evangeline at all costs so that he can either wait for Evangeline's condition to improve or move on with his life.  \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Adriana visits Dorian and is surprised to find her mother walking with a cane and learning that she and Clint are no longer seeing each other.  Dorian evades all questioning concerning both matters and wants to know what is going on with her daughter.  Adriana tells her mother she has come seeking advice concerning Rex.  Adriana is infuriated when Dorian assumes she and Rex are having problems.  When told that Adriana wants help picking out a watch for Rex's Christmas gift, Dorian offers to purchase an expensive one for her; Adriana does not accept her offer because she is not interested in purchasing such an expensive gift.  Next, Dorian offers to purchase an expensive condo for she and Rex as a Christmas gift; Adriana becomes livid at this request.  She cannot understand why Dorian believes money is the answer to solving life's problems and reminds her mother that she and Clint are both millionaires and could not make their relationship work.  Dorian does not back down and tells her daughter that being poor does not help a relationship either.  Fed up with her mother's continuous criticizing of Rex and her life in general, Adriana lashes out at Dorian.  Before leaving La Boulaie, she warns her mother that if she keeps interfering in her relationship with Rex that she will lose her for good this time.  Adriana asks her mother if this is what she wants; a hurt Dorian replies it is not.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nash observes Rex fighting off creditors at an empty Ultraviolet.  Rex is not pleased when Nash suggests that he hire Antonio's new booker, who is bringing in a packed house with all the new acts she is booking.  Rex wants advice from Nash; how does he buy a Christmas gift worthy of Adriana.  Because she comes from a rich family, Rex is concerned about what Adriana, as well as Dorian may expect him to give her.  Due to the lack of business at Ultraviolet and very few clients in his P.I. business, Rex has very little money to spend for Christmas this year.   Jessica overhears the conversation and advises Rex that he should not consider money when presenting Adriana with her gift; he should give more of himself.  Nash listens on and as Jessica tells Rex what she admires about Nash is the fact that he loves her unconditionally.  She tells him how Nash proposed to her while she was sick in the hospital; it was the greatest gift he could have given her.  Rex immediately wonders if he should consider marriage.  Jessica tells him that she is not suggesting that he proposes to Adriana, just that he thinks more from the heart rather a financial aspect.   Both Nash and Jessica tell him it is important to let Adriana know just how much he cares about her because he may never get another chance.  \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Jared shows Nigel the gold cuff links that Rene has given him as an early Christmas present; Nigel informs him that they were once one of Asa's prized possessions. Jared smiles smugly and proclaims that Rene wishes him to have them, even if the DNA tests prove him not to be Asa's son.  Nigel is appalled that Jared would accept such a gift; Jared reminds him that they both know the test results will come back in his favor.  As Jared leaves the room, Nigel says to himself that he cannot allow this to continue.  While Clint is speaking on the phone with Cord about the terrible possibility of Jared being Asa's son, Nigel walks into the room and overhears the conversation.  He later reminds Clint that there could be worse possibilities, other than Jared being his brother.  He tells him, David Vickers could be his brother.  Clint immediately agrees that David Vickers being a Buchanan would be the absolute worse possibility; he then questions why Nigel would even suggest David being his brother.   Meanwhile, Rene is admiring how wonderful the cuff links look on Jared; they look so great on him that now she knows exactly what to buy him for Christmas.  Rene asks Jared to help her pick out Christmas gifts for the grandchildren; she informs him that Asa took great pleasure doing this every year.  Jared is pleased to oblige but wants to check on Natalie at the hospital; he is worried about her because her friend Miles was shot.  Rene advises him that he should allow Natalie to handle this on her own; she believes once the test results are revealed Natalie will not want much to do with him \u2013 at least not for a long while.  Jared appears a bit bothered by Rene's revelation.  Clint and Nigel continue to discuss how terrible life could be if David were a Buchanan heir.  Clint will never get over the fact that David attempted to extort money while Jessica was near death and then slept with Dorian at the family ranch.  As the discussion becomes more intensified, Rene and Jared enter the room.  Rene questions how Nigel could believe that David Vickers could be Asa's son.  She reminds him that Asa's relationship with David's mother was over long before David was born; she then asks Nigel if there is more information that he is not revealing to her.  Immediately, Jared interrupts the conversation; he states that Nigel is simply pointing out that he (Jared) being Asa's son, would be the lesser of two evils.  Clint agrees.  Rene asks to speak with Clint alone; she wants to know what he will do with all this anger once he finds out that Jared is actually his brother.  Clint tells Rene he is not ready to jump to conclusions but Rene believes Jared may be Asa's way of leaving her one last gift.  Later, Jared questions why Nigel would involve himself in such a conversation with Clint since the two of them have already made a deal.  Nigel tells Jared that he has agreed to let the family believe that Jared is the heir because he would be a better choice than David Vickers, but warns him that he will not allow Jared to hurt the family.  Jared tells Nigel he has no plans of hurting the family.  Nigel fears he will devastate Natalie and asks Jared if he is sure he really wants to deny his feelings towards her.  Frustrated, Jared says he didn't plan for this to happen, it just did.  Clint enters the room and informs Jared that Bo is on the way with the DNA results.  As Clint leaves the room, Nigel tells Jared he supposes it is too late, or is it?  Jared has no answer.\n\n\nAs Langston looks on, Cole tells Starr that he is going to turn himself in.  Starr tries to convince Cole to let John take responsibility for shooting Miles.    Cole tells Starr that Miles saw him fire the weapon and will inform the police, he has no other alternative than to tell the truth.  Starr believes that she may have gotten through to Miles and he may not admit the truth.  Cole does not like the idea of John taking the blame but Starr continues to protest.  As Langston attempts to offer advice, Starr rudely snaps at her; Cole asks Starr not to take her frustration out on Langston, who abruptly leaves the room after stating she will keep her opinions to herself.   Cole tells Starr that his mother always told him to take responsibility for his own actions and that he should have never picked up the gun in the first place.  Starr tells Cole that her father was in prison and she doesn't believe Cole will be able to handle it; she asks him to promise her that he will not turn himself in.  \n\n\nAs they stand outside of Miles' hospital room, an unconvinced Natalie questions John about his claim to have shot Miles.  Meanwhile, as Ramsey looks on, Bo asks a half conscious Miles if he knows who shot him.  Before Miles can answer, Roxy barges into the room and asks Miles who did this to him.  Roxy refuses to leave the room; John enters and tells Bo he tried to stop Roxy.  Ramsey suggests this was just an attempt for him to listen to Miles' statement.  Ramsey tells John to leave the room but Miles wants to talk to John.  Miles asks John how is Cole.  John tells Miles he hasn't seen Cole in awhile and has no idea.  Ramsey informs Miles that Cole shot him.  John rebukes Ramsey and leaves the room.  Meanwhile, Natalie has told Roxy about John's claims to have shot Miles.  As John approaches them, Roxy slaps John for hurting Miles and walks away in anger.  Natalie apologizes to John but remains unconvinced that John is the one who shot Miles; she tells him the story does not make sense.  John tells Natalie that he is to blame for Marty's death and he is trying to do what is right.  Natalie asks him is he confessing because he is trying to make things right.  Bo and Ramsey continue to question Miles about the shooting.  Bo tells Miles that Cole may be out of control as a result of losing his mother and may be in need of help; he asks Miles to tell him what really happened on the docks.  Miles thinks back and has visions of Cole shooting him; he then tells Bo and Ramsey he doesn't remember who shot him.  Both Bo and Ramsey stare at him unconvinced.  Ramsey tells Miles that he shouted out Cole's name before being shot.  Miles continues to state he has no memory of the shooting; he is surprised to learn that John confessed to shooting him.  Ramsey tells John that all they have is John's confession so he insists that John is arrested.  Bo and Ramsey approach John as Natalie listens on; Bo wants a statement from John.  John tells Bo that he and Ramsey were on the docks discussing what happened in Ireland.  John says Ramsey advised him to lie about the fact that he didn't follow procedure when he shot at the tires on the van, causing the accident that led to Marty's demise.  John tells Bo that he refused to go along with Ramsey's story and he (Ramsey) pulled out a gun.  As John attempted to fight Ramsey over the gun, Miles approached as the gun went off and was accidentally shot.  Ramsey denies John's charges and demands that Bo arrest John; Bo refuses and Ramsey storms off.  John thanks Bo.  Bo tells John not to thank him and says that his story does not add up.  Minutes later, Bo is handed a copy of the DNA results.  As Bo looks at the results, Natalie asks is Jared her uncle.  Bo tells Natalie that the results are a famly matter; he will call everyone and they will all meet at the mansion to discuss it.  Natalie looks distraught as Bo leaves.  Natalie goes into Miles room.  As Miles sleeps, Natalie apologizes for wanting to talk to him about her problems after the hell he has just endured.  She goes on to say that she has no idea how she will handle the fact that the man she has been fantasizing over may turn out to be her uncle.  \n\n\nJessica informs Nash that they must leave and head over to the mansion to hear the results of Jared's DNA test.  Before leaving, they remind Rex to put Adriana first because nothing else really matters; he must find a way to let her know he truly cares.  As Cole leaves to turn himself in, Starr begs him not to.  Cole kisses Starr passionately and tells her he loves her.  He then leaves as Starr frantically yells for him not to go.  Starr tells Langston that Cole is going to look like a killer when it was all an accident.  She is hurt that he wouldn't let her help him.  Langston tells Starr that Cole just needed to tell the truth.  Again Starr lashes out at Langston; Starr tells Langston she (Langston) doesn't know what it means to tell the truth.  Langston stares at her friend in disbelief.  Cole arrives at the hospital and encounters John. John inquires about where Cole has been all this time; he tells Cole he has been looking for him.  Cole says he has come to turn himself in.  John tells Cole he doesn't want to do this but Cole says he will and tells John that he cannot stop him from doing so.  Miles awakes to find Roxy in the room.  Roxy tells him she could not let anything happen to him without telling him how she really feels.  Rex visits Dorian and tells her that he wishes to propose to Adriana \u2013 he wants Dorian's blessing.  Cris goes to visit Evangeline.  As he approaches the door, he sees someone else's name on the wall.  He opens the door to find the room empty.  Cris asks a nurse where is Evangeline.  The nurse replies, \"She's gone\". After everyone arrives at the mansion, Bo reveals that the test results are a match \u2013 Jared is a Buchanan.  Rene is elated and hugs Jared as she exclaims she knew it all the time.  Nigel looks disapproving at Jared.   Natalie is devastated and runs off.   Moments later, Jared approaches Natalie.  She tells him she doesn't want to talk.  Jared says he doesn't either.  He grabs Natalie in an embrace and kisses her passionately.\n\n\n\n\n",
