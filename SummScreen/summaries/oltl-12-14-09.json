Realizing that Ross was holding Danielle and Blair hostage inside, Bo instructed Ross to release them at once.   While Danielle and Blair screamed for dear life, Ross stepped on the gas and drove in the direction of Todd, T\u00e9a, Bo, and Nora.  Bo pulled Nora and T\u00e9a to safety, but a determined Todd walked toward the moving vehicle.  Suddenly, the vehicle stopped.  Moments later, Ross put the car in reverse and parked.\n\n\nA few feet away, Bo rushed to Nora's side.  Pulling her close, Bo stated that he didn't know what he would've done if Nora had been injured.  Relieved that they had both escaped danger, Bo and Nora kissed.  Meanwhile, Todd advised T\u00e9a that he intended to get his daughter back\n\n\nRoss tried to comfort Danielle, and scolded Blair for pulling the emergency brake.  Blair insisted that she couldn't allow Ross to kill Todd, and urged Ross to focus on Danielle's emotional state.  Warning Ross that the police were stationed at both ends of the bridge, Blair  advised Ross that he was cornered.  With a sly grin, Ross exclaimed, \"I still got you Blair!\"\n\n\nWhile the Seattle police force took charge, Bo advised T\u00e9a and Todd not to interfere.  After Bo announced that sharpshooters were being stationed nearby, T\u00e9a begged Bo to allow her to negotiate with Ross, but Todd refused to place T\u00e9a in Ross's line of fire.   While Todd and T\u00e9a argued, a shot rang out.  As everyone took cover, Ross exited the vehicle.  With a gun to Blair's head, Ross instructed Todd to use his influence and provide Ross with an exit route.   Danielle and Blair begged Ross to give up, but he ignored both their pleas.\n\n\nFearing that Ross wouldn't hesitate to shoot someone, Bo pulled Nora and a screaming T\u00e9a aside, but Todd walked toward Ross.  Ignoring Ross's demands to keep his distance, Todd stopped just a few feet short of the armed man and suggested that Ross release Blair and take Todd.  Offering to help finance Ross's escape, Todd assured Ross that Todd could help him evade the authorities.\n\n\nTerrified that Ross would hurt someone, Danielle reminded him that he was a good person.  Danielle threatened to run away if Ross hurt either Blair or Todd.  As Ross attempted to converse with Danielle, Blair kicked him, and Todd tackled him to the ground.  While Blair ran to safety,  T\u00e9a screamed for Danielle to run, but the frightened teen stood motionless.   After an intense struggle, Todd gained control of the gun and pointed it at Ross.  Immediately, Ross hid behind Danielle.\n\n\nWhile maintaing a grip on Danielle, Ross stared down at the waters below.  Realizing that he was cornered, Ross tried to convince Danielle to jump in the river and swim to safety with him.   Before a panicked Danielle could respond, Todd shot Ross in the chest.   An injured Ross touched Danielle's face and declared, \"I love you!\"  Danielle screamed as Ross fell into the river.\n\n\nAt Llanfair, while Viki studied an article about Mitch Laurence, Charlie observed her from the balcony.  Before heading inside, Charlie took a drink from a liquor bottle that he had hidden inside his suit jacket.  As Charlie entered the house, Jessica rushed in and informed both Viki and Charlie that Mitch had attempted suicide at the jail.  Viki and Charlie both had their doubts that Mitch would want to commit suicide.  Upon learning that Natalie had witnessed Mitch's suicide attempt, Viki rushed off to locate Natalie at the jail\n\n\nOnce Viki had left, Jessica observed Charlie stumbling in the living room.  Jessica questioned whether Charlie had been drinking, but he adamantly denied taking a drink.  When Jessica insisted that she smelled liquor, Charlie admitted that he had slipped and had a drink.   Confessing that he had purchased the alcohol during the Thanksgiving holiday, Charlie maintained that he hadn't taken a drink until the night of Jared's funeral.  Charlie expressed the anger that had overcome him when Mitch stepped out of Jared's coffin.  Charlie further related the rage he had experienced after visiting Mitch in jail.\n\n\nClaiming that he didn't want to worry Viki, Charlie pleaded with Jessica to keep his secret.  Convinced that Viki would support him, Jessica urged Charlie to be honest with her mother.   Swearing that he was in control of the situation, Charlie placed a call to his sponsor and set up a meeting.  Jessica sighed as she watched Charlie leave the room.  Out in the hall, Charlie stared at his phone.\n\n\nAt the Llanview Police Station, Natalie stood in the room where she had stabbed Mitch, and stared at the puddle of blood that Mitch had left behind.   Outside the interview room, Brody asked John to allow him to question Natalie about Mitch's attempted suicide.  Stating that Natalie was in no condition to give a statement, John urged Brody to close his file on the incident and to allow the Internal Affairs Division to take over the case.   An aggravated Brody agreed to hold off on questioning Natalie.\n\n\nUpon entering the interview room, John suggested that he and Natalie get their stories straight, but Natalie admitted to stabbing Mitch, and questioned why John was covering for her.   John listened as Natalie recounted the events that had led up to her decision to stab Mitch.  Natalie told John that she had become enraged when she learned that the charges against Mitch had been dropped.   Recalling how she panicked upon realizing that she could never bear Jared's child because of Mitch, Natalie admitted that she had removed the letter opener from  Jared's desk and set out to stab Mitch with the weapon.  Informing Natalie that she could be charged with premeditated murder, John insisted that she corroborate his claim that Mitch had stabbed himself.\n\n\nNatalie feared that Mitch might wake up and reveal the truth.  John related that no one would ever accept Mitch's word over theirs, but Natalie had her doubts.  As John promised to protect Natalie, Viki entered the room and questioned why John felt the need to protect her daughter.   John claimed that he wanted to protect Natalie from the reporters who anxiously awaited her statement.  Viki declared that the world would be a better place if Mitch was dead, and prayed that his luck would soon run out.  Reminding the ladies that he had a meeting with Internal Affairs, John suggested that Viki escort Natalie home.\n\n\nLater, Brody approached John and announced, \"We both know the truth. Natalie stabbed Mitch!\"\n\n\nUpon returning home, Viki wondered where Charlie had gone.  Informing Viki that Charlie had gone to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, Jessica assured Viki that Charlie was handling things just fine.  Viki expressed concern over Charlie attending two meeting in one evening.  At that moment, Charlie stood on the balcony and took another drink.\n\n\nAt the cottage, Gigi was horrified when Rex suggested that they separate.  Frustrated that Gigi continued to seek comfort from Schuyler, Rex insisted that they break up, until Gigi realized what she wanted.  Rex suggested that Gigi move in with Noelle and Moe temporarily, while he remained at the cottage with Shane.  A confused Gigi agreed to Rex's terms.   Before leaving the cottage, Rex told Gigi that he would always love her.\n\n\nAt the counseling center, Rachel tried to convince Schuyler to reveal to Gigi and Rex that Schuyler was the father of Stacy's unborn child.  Rachel questioned how Schuyler could live with Rex raising Schuyler's child, but Schuyler wasn't sure that he could live without Gigi.  Concerned that Schuyler was developing another addiction, Rachel attempted to convince her friend that he didn't have a chance with Gigi unless he told her the truth.  Rachel also had doubts that Rex would give Gigi up without a fight.\n\n\nOutside of the Buchanan mansion, Kim and Stacy waited for Nevil to emerge from the house.  Kim was certain that Clint would end his marriage to Nora after Nevil informed him of her infidelity.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inside the mansion, Nevil, who was posing as Nigel, informed Clint that Nora and Bo were having an affair.  When Clint questioned how the butler would have knowledge that Bo and Nora had proclaimed their love for one another in London, Nevil related that David Vickers and Kevin also knew of the affair.  Admitting that he had suspected that Nora and Bo were growing closer, Clint acknowledged that he had ignored the signs.  A distraught Clint wondered why Nora hadn't told him about her feelings for Bo before their wedding.  Clint dismissed his butler for the night.\n\n\nKim was thrilled when Nevil reported that he had told Clint about Nora and Bo's affair.   Nevil feared that Bo and Nora would soon face Clint's wrath.  After expressing his regret over exposing the affair to Clint, Nevil suggested that he and Kim get to know each other better.  Insisting that Clint might fire Nevil if he ever learned of their scheme, Kim convinced Nevil to return to London.\n\n\nBack inside the mansion, Clint studied a wedding photo that included himself, Nora, and Bo.  Enraged, Clint violently hurled the picture across the room.\n\n\n",
