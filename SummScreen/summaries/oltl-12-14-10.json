The only thing she knew was that Rex had been investigating someone named Eddie Ford. Brody made a quick call to the hospital and assured her that Rex wasn't there.\n\n\nJessica admitted that she was surprised to hear about Joey's engagement after he had only known Aubrey for a month. \"Wow that's impulsive,\" she declared. Joey admitted that Kelly had been the only person to fully support him, and she had met his fianc\u00e9e on the airplane back from London. He knew that Kelly loved Aubrey. Jess recollected that Joey had been on one bad date after another, but she hadn't ever heard Aubrey's name. Joey admitted they'd been spending almost all of their time together since they'd met. He told Jessica about all of the things he loved about Aubrey, and the fact that both of them had learned from their mistakes.\n\n\nJoey confessed that he'd always have a special place in his heart for Kelly, but their relationship had been over a long time before. Jessica was disappointed, because Kelly had been a very special friend to her. She wanted to make sure that Joey didn't still have feelings for Kelly. She'd always secretly hoped that Kelly would be her sister-in-law again some day. Joey revealed that the secret wish would be reality, and he also knew that Jessica would like Aubrey too.\n\n\nJessica and Joey agreed that they were both stunned that Kevin and Kelly would be getting married again. Jessica pointed out that Kelly had never said anything about Kevin, but Joey reminded her that Kelly had recently flown to London to see Kevin. They'd worked it out, but it was a secret. Joey couldn't figure out why the engagement was a secret, but Jessica assumed that Kelly didn't want to jinx it. Joey pronounced that they couldn't tell anyone else, and they couldn't let Kevin be aware that they knew. Jessica stated that she didn't like secrets.\n\n\nAmidst the wreckage of the car crash, Rex awakened and looked around him. \"What the hell?\" he asked in a state of confusion.\n\n\nWhile Langston comforted Ford at the hospital, Starr rushed into the room. She was worried because she had been unable to locate James. She had just voiced her concern when James walked through the door. Starr ran over to him to hug him, and she asked where he had been. James revealed that he had just \"crashed\" after the events of the previous day. He was fine, he assured her. Ford let everyone know that his test results were good, and that he had stayed overnight at the hospital merely for observation. He was grateful to Langston for sticking with him all night.\n\n\nLangston revealed that she had been at Ford's apartment to retrieve some of his things, and the apartment had been empty. James's bed hadn't appeared to be slept in. James admitted he'd stayed out all night, because he had been afraid that his father would return to the apartment. He'd fibbed because he hadn't wanted Ford to feel bad for not being around to protect his brother. James had walked and spent time in his car, and he'd finally landed at the university library. Starr wondered how they'd ever get rid of Eddie after the disastrous fight.\n\n\nJames was glad that Ford had been in the hospital, because Ford would have gone after Eddie again. Ford agreed that he would do anything to keep Eddie from beating James. It wouldn't happen again, James assured the group. Starr wondered what James meant, but he clarified that he couldn't get beaten if Eddie weren't around. \n\n\nJames flashed back to the previous night, when he'd pointed a gun at Eddie. Starr admonished James sternly. She told him that he couldn't stay out all night and hide from his father. James responded, \"You're right. I can't. And I don't have to.\"\n\n\nStarr pressed James for the meaning of his statement, and she asked if Eddie had left town. \"It might just be wishful thinking, but I just have this feeling that he's gone,\" James answered. Starr wasn't satisfied with James's response. The doctor arrived and advised Ford that he could leave. Langston offered to help him dress, and Starr and James thought it was a good time to leave. Ford wondered if Langston still wanted to wait six months for sex, since he had just been at \"death's door.\" \"You were hardly at death's door,\" she replied. He mocked her, and she threatened to put him at \"death's door\" herself.\n\n\nFord quietly thanked Langston for standing by him after all of the craziness with his father. Langston chuckled. She had Dorian for a mother, and her best friend's father was Todd Manning. She said she was used to it. She suggested that maybe Eddie really had left. \"Maybe. All I know is that bastard will never hurt James again.\"\n\n\nJames wanted to go home to \"crash.\" \"I don't think so,\" Starr retorted. She shoved James into an empty room and slammed the door. She accused him of hiding something. James told her he was exhausted, but Starr wondered if James had paid a visit to his father the previous night.\n\n\nEddie lay dead on the motel room floor. \"You got what you deserve,\" said Nate as he stood over his father's body. He quickly packed up his bag and ran out of the room. He was out of breath and scared, and he began to run from the motel. Shortly after, the housekeeper knocked on the door, and receiving no answer, she let herself in. She spied the body on the floor and screamed.\n\n\nAs Bo buttoned up his shirt in Inez's bedroom, he walked into the living room. \"Inez? What the heck happened last night?\" he asked her. He recalled that he had been upset about Nora, the text messages, and the craziness that had surrounded his argument with his wife. He remembered having a beer, but he couldn't remember anything else until he'd found himself waking up. \"You were going through a lot last night,\" Inez replied. \"Inez, did we sleep together?\" Bo inquired.\n\n\nInez advised Bo that he'd had a lot to drink, though she privately recalled pouring many bottles of beer down the kitchen sink. She pointed to the empty bottles and noted that she'd only had one or two of them. She thought that perhaps he'd been drinking on an empty stomach, and that had caused his reaction. \"Did we have sex last night?\" Bo asked again. There was a knock at the door, and Inez rushed to open it. Nate was standing there, and he didn't have his key, he told his mother. He was curious about Bo's presence.\n\n\nBo maintained that he was there because Nate had been missing. Inez had been worried when Nate hadn't returned home the night before. Nate declared that he had called Inez twice and had told her he'd be late. He and Dani had fallen asleep while watching a movie, he'd forgot his key, and he hadn't wanted to wake his mother up. He'd hung out in the lobby all night, he insisted. Nate went to shower before going to school. Inez believed that Nate was hiding something, but Bo accused her of doing the same. He asked her again if they'd had sex, but this time the phone rang.\n\n\nInez looked at the phone and saw that it was Clint. She didn't answer it, but she affirmed that she and Bo had engaged in sex. Bo couldn't believe it. Inez flashed back to her reassuring Bo that he hadn't betrayed his wife, but she told him that she was sorry instead. Bo couldn't remember it at all. \"Then we can pretend it didn't happen,\" Inez suggested. \"I don't think it's gonna be that easy,\" Bo replied. Inez wished that she could take it back, but Bo felt that he should bear the brunt of the responsibility. They were both apologetic, and both felt accountable.\n\n\nNate rushed towards the door on his way to school, and Inez called out to him to stop. \"Something's wrong with you. What is it?\" she asked her son. Nate insisted he was fine, and he left. He took a deep breath once he was out in the hallway. Inez watched closely as Bo strapped on his gun holster. He walked to the door, and sadly told Inez that he was sorry he had hurt Nora. He would never have cheated on her. Inez hoped Bo and Nora found their way back to each other. She began to cry. He looked at his ring. \"I'm so sorry, Nora,\" he said.\n\n\nDorian found Kelly cracking egg after egg in the kitchen at La Boulaie. It appeared that Kelly was in a good mood, Dorian surmised. Blair walked in shortly after, but Kelly asked to speak to her aunt alone. Dorian proclaimed that the Cramer women didn't keep secrets from each other. Dorian assumed that Kelly was happy and in love, and she thought that Blair should experience some of Kelly's optimism. \"My last stroll down Lover's Lane ended in road kill,\" Blair reminded the others. \"Pay no attention to her,\" Dorian ordered Kelly.\n\n\nDorian explained that Kelly had never stopped loving Joey, and she had gone off to the Palace to tell him. She couldn't wait to hear the good news. \"He proposed,\" Kelly stated. Before she was able to say anything else, Dorian began to jump around with excitement. \"When's the wedding?\" Dorian asked. Kelly was quiet, and Dorian demanded that Blair extend her best wishes to her cousin. Blair commented that while Kelly had gotten together with her first love, Blair had been with a murderer. Blair began to sarcastically spell out the details. Kelly pointed out that the one thing in common with all of Blair's marriages was Blair herself.\n\n\nBlair thought that Kelly looked miserable, and finally Kelly told her family members, \"Joey didn't propose to me. He proposed to someone else.\" She explained how she'd met Joey and seen the ring box on the table. She'd thought it was for her. She liked Joey's fianc\u00e9, even though no one knew about her. Blair laughed. At least Kelly hadn't told Joey about her true feelings for him. Kelly revealed that she'd started to, but she'd stopped herself. She'd told him that she still cared for an ex-husband, and at that point, she'd seen only one way out. She had expressed her love for Kevin.\n\n\nDorian was worried. She pondered what would happen if Joey told Kevin the truth. Kelly was certain that Kevin wouldn't say anything. Blair found it amusing that Kelly thought it had been a good idea to say what she had. \"Well excuse me for having only a limited number of failed marriages to choose from. Not the 17 the two of you have racked up,\" Kelly retorted. Blair and Dorian began to disagree over the number of marriages they'd had, and Dorian was certain that Kelly had included the annulments. Kelly advised them that Kevin had promised not to say anything.\n\n\nBlair stated how brothers could be, and she mentioned Eli and Ross. Kelly assured her there was no comparison, and Kevin wasn't Eli. Blair reminded her that Kevin had slept with Blair when he'd been married to Kelly, and the women began to bicker. Dorian broke them apart. She knew that Kelly had deep feelings for Joey, and Dorian thought he had a right to know. Kelly reminded her that Joey had someone else to marry, and Dorian voiced her disapproval that Kelly hadn't spoken to Joey sooner.\n\n\nKelly admitted that she'd promised Aubrey she wouldn't tell Joey about her own feelings. \"You owe her nothing,\" Dorian stressed. \"I gave her my word,\" Kelly answered. \"Like that's ever stopped you before,\" Blair chimed in. Dorian yelled at Blair, and turned her attention back to Kelly. She thought that Kelly should divulge her feelings to Joey, and it wasn't too late. Kelly would have peace of mind, and she would recognize that she'd done all that she could.\n\n\nBlair thought that love was just a word for greeting cards, but Dorian thought that Kelly had \"nothing to lose and everything to gain.\" Later, Blair accused Dorian of \"sending Kelly down the gangplank,\" and she was afraid that Kelly would be heartbroken. She thought that Dorian was using Kelly in place of expressing her own feelings and love for someone. Dorian agreed that Blair was right; she was afraid of loving someone again. She wanted Kelly to be the \"courageous and strong-willed\" Cramer woman. Perhaps that would encourage Dorian to love again too. She also felt that Blair had better get over Eli or she would also never be able to trust or love anyone again.\n\n\nAs Gigi and Brody tried to figure out where Rex might be, Gigi's phone rang. It was Rex, and he informed Gigi that he'd crashed the car. He was having difficulty staying awake and talking, but he managed to tell her that he was somewhere off of Route 7. He recalled that he had been at the Minute. He stopped talking, but Brody was able to guess that it was the Minute Man Motel.\n\n\nBrody and Gigi located Rex, and Brody called for an ambulance. Brody noted that Rex's pulse was weak. Gigi spoke to Rex and told him to hang on after all they'd been through together. \"Stay here with me,\" she urged him. Rex managed to utter a couple of scattered words, but he was unable to manage an entire sentence. He said Nora's name, but it didn't mean anything to anyone standing there. The ambulance finally arrived, but Brody received a phone call, and he had to leave. Gigi was able to ride in the ambulance. A wedding band lay on the ground.\n\n\nJoey showed Jessica a photo of Aubrey, and Jessica asked if they'd set a wedding date. Hers was in February, so Joey would have to pick another month. Joey vowed that he'd be back from his honeymoon by February. Jessica provoked him by saying that it was okay if Joey had any unresolved feelings for Kelly, because Kelly was going to marry Kevin. Joey stated that he was marrying Aubrey. Jessica noted that Joey didn't deny that he had unresolved feelings, and she charged him with not wanting to talk about it. Just then, the doorbell rang, and it was Kelly.\n\n\nBrody got to the Minute Man Motel and found Eddie's body on the floor. The gunshot wound in Eddie's chest was bloody and stood out brightly in the darkened room.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Bo awakens in Inez's bedroom unaware of what happened the night before. He asks her if they had sex the previous night. She replies yes. He is not angry with her, not blaming her for anything and only blames himself for cheating on Nora. He tells her that he loves Nora and she encourages him to get back with her. She is not comfortable with what she just did. Nate returns to his and his mom's home after being away overnight. Inez knows that her son has a deep dark secret about something. Eddie has been shot dead in his motel room and nobody knows who did it. James has also been out all night and similarly evades the questions that Starr, Robert, and Langston ask him. James expresses to them however, that he has some sort of \"assurance\" that Eddie will never bother anybody ever again. Rex has been in an accident after his car crashed when he picked up Nora after finding her tied to a chair in Eddie's motel room. Yet Nora is not accounted for. It appears that Rex collided with Matthew who was also driving and nobody knows about that. Kelly reveals to both Dorian and to Blair that she thought that she was going to have a future with Joey but he told her he is marrying somebody else. Dorian encourages her niece to go after Joey. But Blair tells her that Kelly will only get her heart stomped on yet again. Jessica similarly tells Joey that he is rushing into marrying Aubrey too fast when he barely knows her and she believes that maybe he should get back with Kelly.",

She said she had used it to hurt Todd Manning.\n"
