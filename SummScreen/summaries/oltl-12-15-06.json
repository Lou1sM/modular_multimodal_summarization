Meanwhile, Jessica showed up at Layla's. \"You and I are going out,\" she grinned. She had a \"friend\" she wanted Layla to meet. Later, right as Nash was about to leave the club, Jessica arrived with Layla. Neither Nash or Layla seemed happy about the set-up. During the unbearably awkward dinner date between the four, Nash and Layla broke away from Antonio and Jessica. They two plotted to appear close and while they danced, Jessica appeared to be slightly bothered. \n\n\nNora and Marty had a heart-to-heart about Marty helping Spencer. Marty was hurt and defensive when Nora claimed she was trying to punish Todd because of all the hurt Patrick's death left her feeling. However, Nora assured Marty she was there for her if she ever needed to talk. Meanwhile, Starr lamented her Spencer/Marty troubles to Langston. Langston pointed out her problems were more with Cole, not his mother. She still didn't approve of Cole, but Starr was torn. When Cole arrived, Langston left. During a sweet conversation, Starr poignantly claimed, \"I forgive you, Cole. Start forgiving yourself.\" He was touched and thanked her before kissing her cheek. When Marty spotted the sign of affection, she went over to her son and told the pair it was a bad idea. Starr used the opportunity to question Marty's motives regarding Spencer and her dad. \n\n\nTodd continued to torture Spencer, and Spencer continued to refuse to give Todd any info about his son. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Blair had a nightmare that the baby she's carrying is Spencer's. She knew life with Todd would be over if that were the case. Dorian walked into her exam room and snapped her back to reality. When the doctor did arrive, she gave Blair the good news that Todd was the father. When Blair called Todd to tell him the news, it gave Spencer the opportunity he needed to escape. Before Blair told him the news, Spencer managed to pry himself free and knock Todd out. Spencer grabbed the phone and told Blair that in order to save Todd's life, she had to keep her mouth shut and bring him the cash at the warehouse. When Blair finally arrived, Todd and Spencer were fighting on the roof. She got involved and when Todd pushed Spencer away from him, Spencer fell off the roof \u2014 and took Blair with him. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Todd has his gun to the Spencer's chest, trying to convince him to tell where his boy is. Spencer will not do it. He doesn't care about the gun. \"Go to hell!\" is how he responds. He fiddles with the cuffs behind his back. Todd decides to go home and give Spencer time to think. \"Wait! I will tell you where your brat is.\" Spencer says that he wants to tell about the boy but is afraid that Todd will kill him afterwards. He wants Blair there to witness this. Todd laughs. He tells that Blair knows about this and told him to cut off some body parts. Spencer doesn't believe it. Todd gets a call and turns his back on Spencer. Spencer takes the time to work on his cuffs. \"Blair sends her love,\" Todd jokes. Spencer keeps working while Todd's back is to him. Blair is telling Todd on the phone that she has something to tell him. He wants to know now; she wants to tell this in person. \"Come on, tell me now. \" THWACK! Todd is hit over the head. \"I am pregnant,\" Blair says, but Todd is on the ground and the phone has flown out of his hand. He never gets the news. Spencer overpowers Todd and stands over him. He hits him a couple of times with a two by four and kicks him repeatedly. Blair hears scuffling and asks what is going on. Spencer picks up the phone, telling that she had better go and empty her account and bring the money to the warehouse, or Todd will be in trouble. He kicks Todd twice more to emphasize his point. Blair will do it. Meanwhile, Spencer holds Todd's gun over him and gloats. Todd manages to hurt the man from his position on the floor. Spencer bends to grab his leg in pain and while doing that, he drops the gun. Todd is regaining his strength and Spencer knows that this isn't good. He makes his way out the door, only to find that he is on a rooftop. When he turns, he finds that Todd is behind him. \"Where is my son?\" Spencer says that Margaret gave birth to little TJ and he felt that he had to make sure that the kid didn't turn out to be anything like his father. \"So I killed him! I killed him! I put him in a plastic bag!\" he shouts at Todd. Todd rushes him and they wrestle. Spencer gets control and manages to drag Todd to the edge of the rooftop in an effort to toss him over. \"Todd?\" Blair has arrived and she runs to the edge of the rooftop to help her man. Spencer proves to be a formidable opponent and he manages for a while to keep Todd and Blair at bay, but then Todd finds a surge of energy and makes one great push. The crazy bastard goes flying over the edge of the rooftop, and unfortunately, Blair goes over with him! \"Blair!\" Todd looks over the edge at the both of them.",
