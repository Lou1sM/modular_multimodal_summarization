    "soap_central": "\nHard of Hearing\n\n\nEveryone was stunned when T\u00e9a walked into the courtroom and ordered Todd not to enter a guilty plea. While Blair and Nora questioned why T\u00e9a was in Llanview, the judge asked her to identify herself. To everyone's surprise, T\u00e9a announced that she was representing Todd. As the courtroom erupted into a circus, Todd stated that he was defending himself and confessed that he was guilty of every charge - including rape. Outraged, T\u00e9a turned to Nora and accused her of railroading Todd. Citing that Marty shouldn't endure any further suffering, Nora urged the judge to accept Todd's guilty plea and to continue with the hearing. \n\n\nT\u00e9a was adamant that Todd had a right to consult with a lawyer before entering a plea. Ignoring T\u00e9a's demands, Todd told her to go away. Insisting that the judge was setting himself up for an appeal by denying Todd the right to speak with counsel, T\u00e9a insisted that he allow her a few moments alone with Todd. Fearing a legal battle with T\u00e9a, the judge ordered Todd to speak with her in one of the witness rooms and called a short recess. Although Todd protested, a guard ushered him away. Before meeting with Todd, T\u00e9a noticed Starr and complimented her. Blair interrupted the reunion and demanded that T\u00e9a stay away from her daughter. In a threatening tone, Blair reminded T\u00e9a of what happened the last time she tried to come between Blair and Starr - she fell through a window. Walking away, T\u00e9a remarked, \"\"Too bad for you, I survived!\" \n\n\nBlair warned Nora that T\u00e9a might convince Todd to allow her to represent him and withdraw his guilty plea. Although annoyed by T\u00e9a's sudden presence, Nora remained convinced that Todd didn't want to make Marty suffer through a trial and would accept the deal that she offered him. Meanwhile, John advised Marty that T\u00e9a might cause a problem. Worried that she might have to endure a trial, Marty asked John what they would do if T\u00e9a defended Todd. Glancing at Nora, John remarked, \"Plan B!\" Meanwhile, Starr updated Cole on T\u00e9a's history with her father. Cole was angered to learn that T\u00e9a might defend Todd and put his mother through the agony of a trial. As everyone contemplated Todd's next move, Blair continued to warn them all that T\u00e9a possessed the ability to make Todd do her bidding. Continuing to plead her case, Blair reminded John and Nora that T\u00e9a helped Todd take Starr away from her years earlier. Blair insisted that T\u00e9a would use every underhanded trick in the book to save Todd from prison. \n\n\nInside the witness room, T\u00e9a demanded to know why Todd was pleading guilty to rape. T\u00e9a was outraged when Todd announced that Nora had offered him a deal - plead guilty and receive a sentence of twenty-five years in prison. Suspicious of Nora's tactics, T\u00e9a asked Todd if he knew about the rape charge when Nora offered him the deal. Upon learning that the rape charge had never been discussed, T\u00e9a reminded Todd that rape was a capital offense and advised him that the judge might disregard his deal with Nora and give him life in prison. As T\u00e9a continued to plead with Todd to fight for his life, Todd begged her to leave him alone. \n\n\nTodd was adamant that he wanted to save Marty the hurt and embarrassment of a trial. When T\u00e9a questioned whether Todd truly believed that he had raped Marty, Todd stated that he made love to her. T\u00e9a suggested that Todd should plead innocent and make Marty understand that he loved her. T\u00e9a stated that if he pled guilty, Marty and his children would never know the truth. As Todd continued to remark that Marty had made him a better person, T\u00e9a told him that he deserved the opportunity to prove to the world that he was a different person. T\u00e9a asked Todd if he was willing to be branded a rapist a second time. \n\n\nCertain that T\u00e9a's motives were self-serving, Todd asked her why she wanted to help him after all the pain he had caused her. T\u00e9a said that she needed the publicity and money. As Todd appeared unconvinced, T\u00e9a gave him a look of concern and stated, \"I can't stand to see you give up. That's not the Todd I know and love!\" \n\n\nAs the arraignment convened, everyone watched as Todd and T\u00e9a returned to the courtroom. T\u00e9a announced that she would be representing Todd. When the judge asked Todd to enter his plea, everyone gasped as Todd pled not guilty. A look of disgust crossed Marty's face. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Vanessa begged Cristian to marry her so that she could remain in the country. A stunned Cris related that he couldn't marry her because Sarah would be devastated. Cris was certain that they would be able to convince the judge and immigration officials that Vanessa and Lola would be in grave danger if they were sent back to Colombia. Stating that she admired Cris's love for Sarah, Vanessa assured Cris that she understood his dilemma. Caressing his face, Vanessa thanked Cris for all that he had done, but expressed her concern that the immigration officials would never allow them to stay in the states. She suggested that they pick Lola up at the loft and head over to the hearing. \n\n\nMarkko joined Langston and Lola at Cristian's loft. Lola told Markko that she had considered running away to avoid deportation, but Langston convinced her to stay. In an attempt to calm Lola's nerves, Langston reassured her cousin that things would work out in her favor, but Lola continued to worry. \n\n\nAs Marrko and Langston offered Lola their support, Sarah arrived to see Cris. When she was told that Cris was expected back soon, Sarah decided to wait for him. Sarah listened as Langston tried to comfort her cousin. Moments later, Cris and Vanessa returned to the loft and told Lola to hope for the best at the hearing. When Lola asked if anything could be done to prevent the deportation, Vanessa mentioned T\u00e9a's suggestion that she marry a U.S. citizen. Instantly, Lola declared that Vanessa should marry Cris. Sarah was appalled and couldn't believe her ears. Sensing the tension, Vanessa reminded Lola that Cris was in love with Sarah. She then announced that Cris had already declined her request to get married. Vanessa insisted that Lola would have to accept the judge's decision. \n\n\nIn tears, a panicked Lola expressed her fear that Ray would kill them upon their return to Colombia. Sarah and Cris listened intently. Lashing out at Sarah, Lola accused her of not wanting Cris to marry Vanessa. Cris immediately defended Sarah and assured Lola that the decision was his and not Sarah's. Lola pleaded with Sarah to allow Cristian to marry Vanessa. With a look of guilt on her face, Sarah acknowledged that Vanessa did save Cris's life, and asked him if he wanted to marry Vanessa in order to keep her in the country. Conflicted, Cris stood speechless. \n\n\nAt St. Ann's, Brody and Jessica attended a group session to discuss their feelings. When the doctor asked Jessica to begin the discussion, she appeared hesitant. Attempting to give her time to sort her thoughts, Brody offered to go first. When another patient recalled that Brody had shot a man, Brody explained that he did it because he was haunted by his past. After stating that he acted out of fear because he believed that he would lose Shane, a nervous Brody told the group about the image of the small boy that haunted him. Recounting the tragic events that led up to him accidentally killing the small child, Brody struggled to tell the story. \n\n\nAs Brody described seeing the child's dead body, Jessica appeared disturbed by the vivid details of the child's death. She began hearing Tess's voice the night she gave birth to her own child. Jessica heard Tess exclaim, \"Baby, why aren't you crying!\" While giving his account, Brody had a vision of the little boy again. Realizing that Brody was having visions of the child, Jessica suggested that he end his story, but Brody was adamant that he needed to continue. When the doctor told Brody that everything was all right, Brody shouted in anger, \"Everything isn't all right. I took someone's child!\" A strange look came over Jessica's face. Tess was back. \n\n\nAfter the group session had ended, the doctor noticed Tess's strange demeanor and asked if she were feeling okay. Appearing uncomfortable, Tess gave the doctor an excuse for the sudden change in her behavior. Alone, Brody sensed that something had bothered \"Jessica.\" When he asked if something was wrong, Tess said that she needed to see her baby. \n\n\nAfter school, Rex escorted Shane to Rodi's. Sensing that Shane was troubled, Rex asked if he was thinking about Brody. Upon learning that Brody was on Shane's mind, Rex informed his son that he had personally taken Shane's Christmas card to St. Ann's and learned that Brody was making progress. Rex's news lifted Shane's spirits. When Gigi joined Rex and Shane, she noticed Shane's Christmas list and asked to view it. Upon observing an expensive video game system on Shane's list, Gigi told her son that they couldn't afford to buy him such an extravagant gift. With a look of concern, Rex listened as Shane said that he didn't intend for his mother to see the gift list and was only wishing for it. Refusing to argue with Shane, Gigi sent him into another room to finish his homework. \n\n\nWhen Rex told Gigi that he wanted to purchase the toy for Shane, she reminded him that he hadn't been able to work for several months and felt that he couldn't afford it. Stating that he wanted to please his son, Rex convinced Gigi that he had the necessary funds to purchase the gift for his son. \n\n\nRex attempted to purchase the toy online, but was surprised to discover that his credit card had been declined. Upon further investigation, Rex learned that he had no available credit. Later, Gigi approached Rex and thanked him for purchasing the game for Shane. As the family exited Rodi's, Shane complained about his mother looking at his Christmas list. He insisted that he never expected to receive the toy; he only wanted to dream about it. As Shane walked away, Gigi smiled at Rex and stated that Shane would be surprised on Christmas day. A look of sadness crossed Rex's face.\n\n\n",
