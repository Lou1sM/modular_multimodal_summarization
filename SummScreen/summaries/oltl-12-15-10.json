    "soap_central": "\n\nAt La Boulaie, Blair helped the maid, Helen, sort through the Cramers' laundry, and noticed a cheesy pair of men's boxers with \"sexy lips\" emblazoned on them.  When Helen informed her the boxers belonged to Jack, Blair bemoaned the fact that her son had turned into another \"oversexed man,\" and said all men were alike.  Helen asked if that meant they could get rid of Eli's mysterious box, and reminded Blair that her fianc\u00e9 had been a menace.  \"Don't you wonder why?\" Blair asked, feeling philosophical.  She said that Eli had been in possession everything -- good looks, a great job, \"me,\" and yet he had done terrible things, and no one understood his reasons.\n\n\nBlair was convinced the box might hold the answers to her questions about Eli's secret life, but Helen remained uninterested.  Grabbing her coat, Blair said she knew who she could ask.\n\n\nIn Joey and Aubrey's suite at the Palace Hotel, Aubrey was chatting on the phone with her unseen friend, dishing about Kelly, and how Aubrey had unwittingly befriended Joey's ex-wife.  She noted that God had a sick sense of humor, seating her on a flight to Llanview next to a woman admittedly still in love with her betrothed.  Aubrey told the mystery caller that Kelly had been presented with numerous chances to tell Joey she still carried a torch, but hadn't; instead, she had feigned a reunion with Kevin.  \"I know, crazy chick, right?\" Aubrey said, laughing as she did her nails. \"But hey, worked for me.\"  With that, she hung up.\n\n\nAubrey laid out a series of outfits on her bed, pondering the right \"look\" for her first visit to Llanfair.  Thinking out loud, she noted that Viki's family was one that didn't have time for fashion, only good deeds and philanthropy like \"saving the whales and ending poverty.\"  Aubrey realized she was making too big a deal out of her decision, and decided to approach Viki the same way she had first met Joey and fallen in love with him -- by being herself.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Gigi waited outside the emergency room for news on Rex's condition.  She called Charlie and informed him of the accident, then rushed into the exam room and begged the ER staff for news on her boyfriend.  The doctor told her Rex had only said one word: \"Nora.\"  Gigi confirmed that Nora was a friend of theirs, but before she could learn anything else, she was ejected from the room in order to let the medical team work.  As she returned to the hall, Charlie arrived.  Upon learning the details of Rex's accident, Charlie hugged the crying Gigi and promised her they wouldn't lose the man they both loved.\n\n\nKelly arrived at Llanfair for breakfast with Joey, but things didn't open well for the exes as they bumped their heads while attempting to peck each other's cheek.  As Joey ushered her into the drawing room, Kelly asked him if he had a minute to hear something she needed to tell him.\n\n\nAs Kelly and Joey entered the drawing room and closed the doors behind them, Echo crept into the foyer with a glass of orange juice.  Opening her purse, she filled the juice with a generous helping of tequila from her pocket flask, then swigged a little herself.  As Viki descended the stairs, Echo popped the flask back into her purse.  Viki was all smiles for Echo, and asked where she had been for the past day or so.  After playing nice and listening to Echo's various excuses, Viki dropped the act and said she knew Echo had been avoiding Viki after kissing Charlie.\n\n\nViki accused Echo of throwing herself at Charlie, and called the disgraced countess on her attempt to convince Charlie to lie about the kiss; it had only made Viki wonder what else Echo was lying about.  Echo offered a weak \"non-apology,\" and said she was sorry she had put Charlie in an awkward position with Viki.  Forcing a cold smile, Viki said she would give Echo one more chance to stay at Llanfair for Rex and Shane's sake, and added that if she had felt Charlie was at all susceptible to Echo's dubious charms, the countess would be packing her bags.  \"He felt very susceptible when we kissed,\" Echo murmured with a smirk.  \"Excuse me?\" Viki snapped, turning on her.\n\n\nBefore Echo and Viki could fight any more, Echo got a call from Charlie at the hospital, informing her of Rex's accident.  Though Charlie asked her to tell Viki the details, Echo immediately hung up and rushed out of Llanfair, with her only words to Viki being, \"Charlie needs me!\"  \"Charlie needs you like a hole in the head, Echo,\" Viki said with an exasperated sigh.  She sipped Echo's leftover glass of orange juice, then gagged at the copious amount of tequila in the drink.  Answering the doorbell, she found Aubrey waiting, decked out in a fur vest.\n\n\nEntering the foyer, Aubrey thanked Viki for blessing her and Joey's engagement, and said she had stopped by to get to know her future mother-in-law better.  Aubrey said she was excited to meet Viki and the Buchanans and build friendships.  Viki seemed open to the idea.\n\n\nMeanwhile, in the drawing room, Joey made tea with lemon and asked Kelly if she wanted coffee.  Kelly said she didn't need any more caffeine, as she was stressed enough and facing sleepless nights.  When Joey asked her why she was stressed, Kelly was struck dumb.  Thinking to herself, Kelly's inner monologue urged her to tell Joey the truth, throwing caution to the wind and risking rejection.  Before Kelly could open her mouth, however, she was blinded by a squirt of lemon juice in her eye.\n\n\nKelly lurched around blindly as Joey struggled to get a hold of her in order to examine her eye.  As Joey took her in his arms and began wiping the lemon juice out of her eye, Kelly was touched by their close proximity.  Just then, Viki and Aubrey entered the drawing room.  Joey quickly explained the awkward moment, and as he, Aubrey, and Viki began happily discussing the engagement, Kelly's inner monologue began castigating her.  She told herself that Joey was crazy about Aubrey, and she needed to leave the lovebirds alone.\n\n\nKelly prepared to leave, and Viki offered to drive her home, fearing her vision was impaired.  Joey reminded Kelly that she had said she needed to talk to him, and Kelly covered by claiming she would be standing by if Joey and Aubrey needed help planning the wedding.  \"Oh, Kelly, that's so sweet!\" Aubrey trilled. \"I'll keep that in mind.\"  Kelly hurried out of Llanfair, and Viki followed closely behind after telling Aubrey they could take a tour of the house another time.\n\n\nWith the others gone, Joey asked Aubrey if she still wanted a tour of Llanfair.  \"Or you could do to me what you were about to do to Kelly,\" Aubrey cracked, and told her husband-to-be that when she walked in, it had looked like he had been ready to kiss his ex-wife.  Aubrey said she was just teasing, but Joey was baffled and insisted that he and Kelly were just friends.  \"And what am I?\" Aubrey asked, pulling him in for a kiss.\n\n\nViki drove Kelly back to La Boulaie and helped her into the kitchen.  Kelly thanked Viki for her concern, but said her eye would recover from her close encounter with the lemon.  \"Is that all it was?\" Viki asked her. \"I know you have feelings for Joey.\"  Kelly played dumb, but Viki said it was all right, and invited Kelly to open her heart without fear of Joey learning the truth.  Kelly insisted she was fine, and reminded Viki that Joey was engaged to Aubrey.  She thanked Viki for the ride and exited the kitchen, leaving Viki to fret.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Echo arrived at the ER just in time for Rex to be wheeled into the elevator and taken to the Radiology department for X-rays, with Gigi accompanying him.  Hysterical, Echo collapsed into Charlie's arms.  She screamed at the staff for news on her son, and Charlie hustled her into the empty exam room where Rex had been worked on.  As Charlie picked up Rex's left-behind shoes, Echo grew teary.  She realized that she had abandoned Rex in the same ER over twenty years before, and hugged Charlie as she said she couldn't lose her son again.\n\n\nAs the long-lost parents waited for news on Rex, Charlie grew equally overcome when he realized he was in the same ER where Jared had died the year before.  He told Echo he had failed Jared for all of his elder son's life, and the night Jared had died, things had moved too fast.  \"I wasn't able to tell him I loved him before it was too late,\" Charlie mumbled.  He vowed to tell Rex how he felt, in case he lost his second son as well.\n\n\nCharlie and Echo grew impatient for news, and Charlie left the exam room to find a nurse.  Alone, Echo made a beeline for her purse and drank deep from her flask.  As she did so, Charlie returned unexpectedly, having forgotten his phone.  He froze as he caught Echo in the act of falling off the wagon.\n\n\nOver at the Minute Man Motel, Brody and a team of uniformed officers secured the crime scene and Eddie Ford's dead body.  When one of the officers asked Brody who could have murdered the man, Brody mused that Eddie had made plenty of enemies.\n\n\nAt the police station, John and Natalie ran into each other in the squad room while going about their morning duties.  \"Good morning, Mrs. McBain,\" John said playfully, and a flustered Natalie urged him to keep it down -- she wanted to tell her family about their engagement before it was public knowledge.  John was anxious to tell the world, but agreed to her terms.  Just then, he got a call from Brody, and told Natalie to saddle up for a homicide call.\n\n\nBo arrived in his office, preoccupied.  He stared at \"Nora's\" text message, which asked him if he had slept with Inez.  Guilt-ridden, he admitted to himself that he had done just that.  He called Nora and left a message, begging her to return home so they could talk without digital technology, face-to-face, and work things out.  \"I need to see you,\" he said. \"Come home.\"\n\n\nJohn entered the office and informed Bo of Eddie's murder.  He told Bo that he was headed down to the Minute Man Motel with Natalie on forensics detail, and Bo asked him to keep in touch.  After John left, Bo called Inez and left a message on her phone, asking her to call him regarding police business.  Then, he took a call from Gigi informing him of Rex's accident, and rushed to the hospital.\n\n\nJohn and Natalie arrived at the Minute Man Motel and began examining the crime scene and the corpse.  Natalie spotted contusions on Eddie's wrists, and John mentioned that he had heard about the Ford family boxing match at Rourke's Gym.  As Natalie began snapping pictures, Brody returned from canvassing the grounds.  He asked Natalie what she was doing there, and gave her the news about Rex, which he in turn had gotten from Gigi.  Natalie said she would finish the job at the scene, then head over to the hospital.\n\n\nBrody told John he hadn't turned up anything in his survey of the site, but noted John's sudden interest in Rex's condition.  John explained that Rex had been investigating Eddie Ford, and said he would clear things up later.  Just then, he paused, noticing a possible \"break\" in the case -- a cuff link, lying on the motel carpet.  He told Natalie and Brody that he didn't know how it had gotten there, but he knew who it belonged to.  John handed the cufflink to Natalie for forensic examination and left the motel after ordering Brody to get Natalie out as quickly as possible.\n\n\nAs Natalie continued to work, Brody managed the crime scene.  Returning to the room, he told her he had gotten another text message from Gigi confirming that Rex would be all right.  Natalie was pleased, but distracted as she discovered a long red hair on Eddie's body -- and the maid who had found the corpse wasn't a redhead.  Brody explained that he had met Eddie the night before while investigating a noise complaint, and Eddie had claimed to have female company.  Brody wondered if the red hair could belong to the same woman.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Starr confronted James in an exam room.  She wanted to know what had happened with James the night before, after he had left the gym, but James asked her to leave it alone.  Flashing back to his theft of Eddie's gun and then to his late-night encounter with his father at the Minute Man Motel, James admitted that he had gone to see Eddie, but refused to say what had happened between father and son.  Concerned, Starr asked him if Eddie had assaulted him again, and said that if so, they could get Eddie arrested and put away.  \"We cannot go to the cops!\" James snapped.\n\n\nStarr wanted answers, but James refused to discuss the previous evening further and rushed out of the exam room.  He ran into Bo in the hospital corridor. Bo broke the news to the duo that Eddie was dead.  Bo told the teens that Eddie had been killed sometime late the previous night or early that morning, and asked James if he knew where Inez was.  James didn't, and Bo explained that the police had only just started their investigation, but they knew that Eddie had definitely been murdered, shot by an assailant.  He gave James his condolences and headed down the hall to meet Gigi.\n\n\nJames and Starr returned to the exam room.  Starr told James she was sorry for his loss, but James wasn't.  \"I'm just glad it's finally over,\" he said softly.\n\n\nStarr was shocked by his attitude, but James said he didn't care how terrible that sounded; his father had possessed no redeeming qualities, and had only hurt people.  \"It's about time someone hurt him back,\" James muttered.  Starr was astonished by his words, and hesitantly asked James if he had killed Eddie.\n\n\nIn the hospital corridor, Gigi told Bo the good news: Rex only had a concussion, and was going to make a full recovery.  She said Rex could have visitors, but was still fairly disoriented.  After giving Bo a hug, she hurried off to file Rex's paperwork and speak to Echo and Charlie, but not before informing Bo that Rex's only words since the accident had been about Nora.\n\n\nBo met the wheelchair-bound Rex in the waiting area.  Rex struggled to speak about Nora, and Bo instantly assumed Rex was concerned about his martial strife.  He urged Rex to rest and heal, but before Bo could leave, Rex told him to wait.  He told Bo that it hadn't only been him in the car accident.  \"Nora,\" Rex mumbled, \"she was with me.\"\n\n\nAt the Manning household, Todd descended to the foyer, leaving a snide voice message for Rex.  He demanded news about Eddie Ford, and said they needed to deal with the situation quickly.  Listening in, T\u00e9a confronted Todd, asking him how he intended to deal with Eddie.  Covering, Todd said he had it all under control, and that if he needed a lawyer, his wife would be the first person he called.  \"Why would you?\" T\u00e9a asked, probing.\n\n\nTodd admitted that he had hired Rex to dig up dirt on Eddie, and T\u00e9a was relieved, as she had feared Todd had put a hit out on Ford Sr.  She asked him to tell her if he had done anything stupid or short-sighted.  \"Short-sighted?\" Todd cracked.  \"It will be if you lie to me,\" T\u00e9a warned.\n\n\nAs Todd and T\u00e9a moved in for a kiss, Blair interrupted as she barged into the living room with her mystery box.  The Mannings asked Blair if she was there bearing gifts, but Blair explained that Eli had left the box for her, and she needed T\u00e9a's help.  Nervous, she deliberated about her options, legal and otherwise, but T\u00e9a deduced that Blair didn't need a lawyer, only a friend.  \"You're asking T\u00e9a for advice?\" Todd joked. \"That's a first.\"\n\n\nBefore Todd's jibes could send Blair packing, T\u00e9a stopped her newfound BFF.  T\u00e9a said she was glad Blair had stopped by -- she felt they all needed closure on the Eli ordeal, and admitted she was still afraid to take aspirin after Eli and Greg's machinations.  Blair was on the fence about opening the box and a potential can of worms, but T\u00e9a warned Blair that if she didn't open it, she would always wonder what secrets Eli had left behind.  As the ladies began to bicker about which one of them would dare open the box, Todd stepped in and offered to bludgeon its lock with a hammer, ignoring Blair's key.\n\n\nAs Todd prepared to bash the box into submission, there was a knock at the door.  Striding into the foyer, he found John McBain on his doorstep and asked what the top cop wanted.  \"A murderer,\" John replied. \"You know one?\"\n\n\nBlair and T\u00e9a followed Todd into the foyer, and T\u00e9a asked John who had been murdered.  John explained that the victim was Eddie Ford, and T\u00e9a asked what that had to do with them.  \"Not you,\" John replied, \"him.\"  He told Todd, Blair, and T\u00e9a that he had found a man's cuff link at the crime scene -- with the initials \"T.M.\" \n\n\n",
