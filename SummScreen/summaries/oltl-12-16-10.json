    "soap_central": "\n\nAt Todd's house, John showed Todd, T\u00e9a, and Blair the cufflink found at the scene of Eddie's murder at the Minute Man Motel. John pointed out the initials \"T.M.\" on the cufflink. Todd claimed that he hadn't spent any time there, but John wanted to clarify that the cufflinks were Todd's. T\u00e9a assured Todd that he didn't have to answer any questions. As Todd's wife, T\u00e9a said she would have recognized the cufflinks if she had seen them before, but she hadn't. T\u00e9a asked if John was accusing Todd of murder.\n\n\nJohn asked where Todd had been the previous night. He answered that he'd been with T\u00e9a. T\u00e9a thought John was basing a lot of speculation on \"one cufflink.\" She also thought that John should concentrate on other suspects, whose names she had. T\u00e9a's initials were T.M., as were Tad Martin's and John's father, Thomas, so John had a \"flimsy basis\" for a murder accusation, T\u00e9a stated. John wanted to go upstairs to find the \"mate\" of the cufflink.\n\n\nT\u00e9a knew John couldn't search without a warrant. John said he had to check on Rex, anyway, because Rex had been investigating Eddie for Todd. John wondered why Todd would have someone investigated if Todd had no connection to that person. John left the house. Blair reminded Todd that she'd had the cufflinks made for Todd while they were married, and they were one-of-a-kind. Todd had forgotten about them. Blair and T\u00e9a sat Todd down and demanded to know what Todd was lying about.\n\n\nAt the hospital, Starr asked James what he had been doing in Eddie's room the night before. James claimed that it had just happened, and that the entire night was a blur. He told Starr about taking the gun from Eddie's duffel bag earlier that evening. He rationalized that someone like Eddie shouldn't have been carrying around a loaded gun. Starr asked James if he'd had a plan to \"take care\" of Eddie himself.\n\n\nJames said that he might have had a plan in the back of his head, but he hadn't been able to think straight. James told Starr about what Todd had said to James -- that the only thing that could get rid of an abuser was death. James told Starr to drop the subject because he only caused trouble in her life. \"Have you met my family?\" Starr asked him. She related that she owed him her life for saving her from Hannah, so the least she could do was listen to him.\n\n\nStarr again asked what had happened, and she told James that it would eat him alive if he didn't talk. James agreed that he needed to talk, but not to her. As he confessed that he needed to talk to the police, John appeared in the doorway and told James it was his lucky day.\n\n\nAt the hospital, a wheelchair-bound Rex disclosed to Bo that Rex had been transporting Nora home before the car accident happened. Rex divulged that Eddie had kidnapped her and tied her up in a room at the Minute Man Motel. Rex thought Nora was lucky to be alive. Rex informed Bo that she was there for \"a while,\" and all of the text messages \"Nora\" had sent to Bo were actually sent by Eddie.\n\n\nBo wanted to make sure that Nora had been in the car with Rex when they had crashed. Rex was fuzzy on the details, but he was sure that Nora had been in the passenger seat, even though he had woken up alone. Bo imagined the worst. He made sure Rex was okay and went to find Nora. Before he left, Rex assured Bo that Nora had gone through hell, but she had never given up on Bo.\n\n\nStill at La Boulaie, Viki called Charlie, but only got his voicemail. She wanted to know what was wrong, and she pleaded with him to call her. Dorian entered and told Viki that they should chat. Dorian asked what happened, and Viki told Dorian the story about Charlie and Echo's kiss. However, Viki knew it wouldn't happen again. Dorian wondered what Viki's message to Charlie had been about.\n\n\nViki told Dorian that Echo had gotten a call from Charlie saying that he needed to see Echo, but Viki didn't know why. She said she would know as soon as Charlie called her back. Dorian was surprised to learn that Echo was still living at Llanfair, but Viki assured her that Echo would be \"out in a heartbeat\" if anything else happened. Echo just wanted a relationship with Rex and Shane. Dorian countered that the only relationship Echo wanted was one with Charlie.\n\n\nViki related that she couldn't push Echo out of her house without looking like the villain. \"That's my job,\" Dorian told Viki. A confused Viki asked why it was so important to Dorian. Dorian admitted that she didn't want to see Charlie hurt Viki the way that David had hurt Dorian. Viki was surprised by Dorian's kindness, but Dorian told Viki not to get used to it. Viki thanked Dorian, and the two women shook hands. Dorian was ready to \"bring this bitch down.\"\n\n\nAt the hospital, Charlie told Echo that she had an alcohol problem. Echo claimed that she had panicked when Charlie called her about Rex, and she had grabbed the first \"crutch\" she could find. Charlie asked what she had panicked about the other day, but Echo blamed her drunkenness on Dorian. Charlie warned Echo that alcohol had caused Charlie to alienate Jared, and he didn't want to see the same thing happen to Echo with Rex.\n\n\nEcho understood that she had a second chance with Rex, so she intended to stay \"fully conscious.\" She claimed she could handle it, but Charlie told her she was dependent on alcohol. She said she could stop any time she wanted to. \"So why don't you?\" Charlie asked. He told her to do it for Shane and for Rex. \"For me?\" Rex asked from the doorway.\n\n\nCharlie began to make up a story about Echo donating blood, but Echo stopped him. She told Rex that Charlie thought she had a drinking problem. Rex caught sight of the flask and was surprised to learn that it was Echo's. Rex informed Echo that Shane already had one grandmother with a drinking problem, so he didn't need another one.\n\n\nIf Echo admitted that she had a problem, Charlie promised to help her through it. Echo said she was scared, but Charlie vowed to be there every step of the way. Rex agreed that he would be there for her as well. \"How could I refuse?\" Echo said.\n\n\nBo arrived at the site of the car crash. He told an officer that he needed access to the car that a tow truck was about to take away, because he had reason to believe that there had been another passenger in the car -- \"my wife.\" Bo opened the passenger side door of the car and found Nora's wedding ring on the floor. Bo asked an officer to call area hospitals and ask for Nora Buchanan, and he gave the officer a picture of Nora.\n\n\nBo wondered why Nora wasn't wearing her wedding ring. He also wondered why Eddie had pushed Bo toward Inez. Later, the officer told Bo that he hadn't found any trace of Nora. Bo thought to himself that he'd meant his vows when he married Nora, and he still did. As Bo thought that he would do anything if Nora would come back, he heard a crackling sound in the woods. He called out Nora's name, and Nora appeared. The two tightly embraced.\n\n\nInez listened to Bo's message on her answering machine about the police business he had to talk to her about. Clint entered to Inez's shock and told Inez that he'd known she could \"do it.\" She said that she'd only done it in order to keep her sons safe from Eddie. She said it was Clint's turn to hold up his end of the deal, but Clint informed her that someone had shot and killed Eddie the night before. Inez asked Clint if he had killed Eddie.\n\n\nClint said that he had only gone to see Eddie to \"complete a business transaction\" and to make sure Eddie left town. However, Eddie was being carried out in a body bag, and no one had been arrested for the murder yet. Inez clarified that Clint had nothing to do with it and told him that he hadn't held up his end of the deal. Inez admitted that she had lied about sleeping with Bo.\n\n\nClint promised that Nora would get the whole story anyway. Inez said that if she and Bo denied it, Nora would take Bo and Inez's word over Clint's. Inez told Clint that she had drugged Bo, but he had pushed her away because he didn't want to betray Nora. Clint grabbed her and told her that she had failed. However, she said that their deal was \"null and void.\" Clint warned Inez that she would have to let Bo think that Bo had slept with Inez \"if your son's life means anything to you.\"\n\n\nClint informed her that nothing in the world was free. He had helped James go to college and Ford to get his job back. She had to follow through with one last thing to pay her debt. If she didn't, Clint promised to tell the police that her son had been seen at the scene of the murder.\n\n\nAt school, Darren told Destiny that her parents loved her, but Destiny told him to stop calling her grandparents her \"parents.\" Darren reminded her that they had taken care of her for years and deserved a second chance. Destiny spotted an upset-looking Matthew and asked him if he was all right. Darren told Matthew that he should probably get to basketball practice.\n\n\nIn the gym, Nate threw the basketball he was holding. Dani walked up and asked him if he were trying to murder the ball. Nate told her that he needed to tell her something about the previous night. Just then, Matthew entered, and Nate demanded to know what was wrong with Matthew. Matthew claimed that he hadn't lied about anything he'd said. The two started to get physical, but Darren, Destiny, and Dani pulled them apart.\n\n\nDestiny asked what was going on. Matthew told her that Nate's mother was \"a whore, a bitch, and a home-wrecker\" because she was sleeping with Bo. Destiny couldn't believe it, but Matthew said he had seen it with his own eyes after someone had told him about it. Matthew wouldn't take back any of his words, but he didn't feel any better. He had been so angry after seeing his father that he had almost gotten into an accident.\n\n\nDani told Nate to forget about Matthew because he was different -- more bitter and angry. She said that Matthew only wanted to provoke Nate. Dani asked what Nate had wanted to tell her. She said she would help Nate if he had a plan to get Eddie out of town, but Nate told her that it was too late. Darren walked up to Dani and Nate with his computer and expressed his sympathy for Nate. He told the confused pair that Eddie had been shot and killed the night before.\n\n\nNate wasn't sorry that Eddie was dead. He thought that it was better for everyone. Dani told him it was normal to be numb and in shock. Nate hadn't even looked surprised. \"I wasn't,\" he told her.\n\n\nDestiny expressed her sympathy to Matthew. However, Darren walked over to them and told them the news about Nate's father. Destiny related that there was nothing worse than losing a father.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Eddie has been shot dead and nobody knows who did it, there's a lot of things going on. James sounds very evasive to Starr and all but admits that he may very well have done it. Nate sounds similarly evasive when Dani asks him. Matthew goes to basketball practice and informs Nate, Dani, Destiny and Daren that he saw his dad and Inez with his own two eyes and knows they are sleeping together. Clint informs Inez that Eddie has been killed and is out of her life. She asks if he killed Eddie. He tells her no. Somebody else apparently beat him to it. Hearing that, she concludes that since she no longer \"depends\" upon Clint to get rid of Eddie and he failed to come through on his end of the bargain, she does not have to do what he expects of her. And she admits to Clint that she did not sleep with Bo and lied to him that it happened after she drugged him. Now that Eddie is no longer an issue, she is not going to have Bo believing he cheated on Nora when he did not. But Clint tells her if she does not find a way to sleep with Bo and break up his marriage with Nora, Clint will tell the cops that her son was at the crime scene after his father got killed. Bo finally finds Nora. But we don't find out what happened and where she went after the crash in Rex's car. The cops suspect Todd of killing Eddie when they find his cuff link in the motel room. At first, Tea and Blair both defend Todd to John. But Blair admits that she is suspicious when she knows about Todd's cuff link and finds out that Todd did not tell anybody that he hired Rex to investigate Eddie. Charlie and Echo are both at the hospital after Rex has been admitted after the accident and he admits his concern for her drinking as does Rex. And they both promise to be there to help Echo with her sobriety. Meanwhile, Dorian warns Viki that she cannot trust Echo not to try to break up her marriage with Charlie. And she offers to \"Help\" Viki run Echo out of town before she gets her claws into Charlie.",
