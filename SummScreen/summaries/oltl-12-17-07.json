Upon receiving a vague answer from her, Rex informs Dorian that he plans to marry Adriana with or without her blessing.  Rex states that he is only asking Dorian out of respect; he feels her blessings would make life easier for all involved.   Still refusing to give Rex an answer, Dorian tells him she has a few questions.  Convinced that Dorian is attempting to talk him out of proposing, Rex prepares himself for the worse.  Dorian reminds Rex of his failed marriage and suggests that his lack of finances may not be a formula for success.  Realizing she is hitting a nerve, Dorian continues to grill Rex.  She goes on to insinuate that Rex cannot make ends meet due to Ultraviolet's declining business and the fact that his P.I. client base is nonexistent.  Dorian further implies that Rex has plans to obtain funds from Adriana's lingerie business.  Under extreme pressuring from Dorian, Rex continues to remain calm.  Dorian takes one last shot at Rex; she now wants to discuss sex.  A very uncomfortable Rex listens as Dorian reminds him of his sexual escapes involving Lindsay and informs him of the consequences if he were to ever cheat on Adriana.  Rex attempts to convince Dorian that he truly loves Adriana and would never do anything to hurt her.  Dorian tells Rex she has the perfect jeweler from whom he can purchase the engagement ring; she would like to know how much he intends to spend.  Rex politely informs Dorian that his finances are just fine and reminds her that she has yet to give him and Adriana her blessing.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Adriana and Sarah are having cocktails and drowning their sorrows.  Adriana is complaining about her mother's constant interfering. She tells Sarah of her entire history with Dorian, including the fact that she gave her away as a child, hired someone to stalk her and lost her inheritance.  She reveals that what bothers her most of all about her mother is the fact that she feels Rex is not an acceptable mate for her.  As Adriana bears her soul, she realizes that Sarah has problems of her own - and the problem is Cristian.  She questions Sarah about her relationship with Cris.  Sarah reveals she has feelings for him and explains that she suggested he visit Evangeline.  Adriana tells Sarah that she believes she gave Cris bad advice.  Sarah defends her decision by telling Adriana that Cris needs to see Vange in order to decide if he is ready to move on with his life.  She understands that Cris may realize that he is still in love with Evangeline, but nothing can ever become of their relationship as long as Cris is undecided about his true feelings.  As they discuss their problems, both women continue to drink.  Adriana tells Sarah that her mother was so distraught over the pregnancy scare she hates to think of Dorian's reaction if she and Rex were to ever get married.\n\n\nMeanwhile at the hospital where Evangeline has been staying, Cris is yelling at the nurse.  After hearing that Evangeline is gone, Cris demands to know what exactly does that mean; he fears Evangeline may have died.  Before the nurse can respond, Layla and Vincent enter the room and Layla explains to Cris that their mother has had Evangeline moved to a facility in Maryland.  An angry Cris wants to know why Layla did nothing to prevent this from happening and why she didn't let him know.  Layla is obviously upset and tries to explain to Cris that she only recently found out and is devastated herself.  After a shaken Layla leaves the room, Vincent explains that Layla was totally blindsided by the news; her mother didn't inform her because she knew Layla would object.  Cris confides to Vincent that he is hurt and fears he may never see Evangeline again.  \n\n\nAt Langston's home, Langston and Starr are involved in a heated argument concerning Cole.  Langston tells Starr that Cole needed to tell the truth.  Starr shouts at Langston and asks her who is she to say that Cole needs to tell the truth since she is incapable of doing so herself.  Langston is horrified as her friend reminds her of lying about the death of her parents for over a year.  Langston asks Starr where all her anger is coming from; she explains to Starr that she lied because she was afraid of the consequences - just as Cole is now.  Langston advises Starr that she must allow Cole to make his own decision.  Relentlessly, Starr tells Langston that she agreed with Cole's decision to turn himself into the police; Starr blames Langston for letting him go out for a walk on that fateful night.  Starr insists had she not let Cole leave, he would have never been able to shoot Miles.  Langston stares at her friend in disbelief; she tells Starr that Cole doesn't want to hide the way she did for so long and that is why he needed to tell the truth.  Extremely upset, Starr states she doesn't want to lose Cole and runs upstairs.    Starr later returns; her mood is the same.  Starr tells Langston she doesn't want Cole to be punished for something that was a mistake, especially since John is willing to take responsibility for the shooting.  As Langston continues to stress the fact that Cole is doing what is right, Starr again lashes out at her.  Starr tells Langston she doesn't know what is right for Cole and neither does he.  Langston opens up to Starr and explains the hurt she felt while concealing her parent's deaths.  Starr feels compassion for her friend; the two apologize to each other and once again there is peace.\n\n\nOutside of Miles' hospital room, Cole shouts as he tells John he is turning himself in and there is nothing John can do to stop him.  John grabs Cole's arm and tells him he isn't going anywhere.  John explains to Cole that he has already confessed to shooting Miles and suggests that he leaves things as they are.  John tells Cole that he was out of his mind with grief at the time of the shooting and was not himself.  John says he owes it to Marty to make sure Cole doesn't ruin his entire life over a mistake; he pleads with Cole to allow him to handle things his way.  Cole appears unmoved and says he needs to speak with Miles.  Meanwhile, Roxy is visiting Miles.  She tells him the minute she heard about the shooting, she knew she needed to be by his side because he means so much to her.  Roxy reveals to Miles that she has something important to tell him.  Roxy begins telling Miles a long- winded story about the night she married Max Holden while in a drunken stupor.  A confused and semi- sedated Miles asks Roxy is there a point to her story.  Just as Roxy is about to reveal her feelings to Miles, John and Cole enter the room.   Causing great discomfort to Miles, Roxy leaps on top of Miles and shields him with her body.  She accuses John of trying to shoot Miles again.  Miles convinces Roxy to allow him time to speak with Cole; she and John leave the two alone.  Once alone, Miles begins to tell Cole how sorry he is about Marty's death; he never meant to hurt either of them.  Angrily, Cole tells Miles that it was he who fired the gun and not John; he states that he realizes Miles knows the truth.  Miles tells Cole he understands his pain because he just lost his mother.  Cole says the loss of his mother doesn't make what he did right and apologizes to Miles. Miles does not feel Cole owes him an apology.  Cole tells Miles that John wants him to remain quiet and allow him to take the blame.  In a heartfelt voice, Miles tells Cole that John wasn't able to save Marty but is able to save him. Miles states that Marty would want John to protect Cole, just as he is trying to do.  In the waiting area, Roxy tackles John and frisks him; she's convinced he has a gun and the intention of hurting Miles.  An aggravated John fights her off and wonders what has gotten into her.  Roxy admits she has strong feelings for Miles and that is why she is so concerned for his safety.  John is shocked as Roxy admits to being in love with Miles Lawrence.  Minutes later, Cole approaches John.  John questions him about his conversation with Miles.  Cole tells John that Miles agree that he remains silent.  John continues to attempt to convince Cole to allow him to take the blame.  Cole wonders what will happen to John as a result.  John informs Cole that he has been in the system before and can handle it a lot better than he (Cole) can.  John pleads with Cole to allow him to honor Marty's memory, by placing him first.  Cole sadly agrees.\n\n\nOnce again, Roxy enters Miles' room and gets enough courage to tell him exactly how she feels.  Roxy admits to Miles that she is \"head over heels\" in love with him.   She looks down at him to get a response and discovers a sleeping Miles - who has not heard a word she has said.  \n\n\nOutside of the Buchanan Mansion, Jared has pulled Natalie into an embrace and begun passionately kissing her.  Angrily, Natalie pulls away from him and screams for him to stay away from her.  After hearing the DNA results, Natalie believes he is some sort of freak for kissing her.  As she continues to tell him to stay away from her, he refuses to leave her alone until she hears what he has to say.  Jared begins telling Natalie about the connection they shared.  Natalie says the connection existed because they were related and tells him to get over it as she pulls away from him.  As Jared grabs her arm, Nash appears and warns him to leave Natalie alone.  Jared informs Nash that his conversation with Natalie is none of his business.  With the encouragement of his wife, Nash is adamant that he has made it his business.   A frustrated Natalie and Jessica head over to Capricorn to tell Sarah the results of the DNA test.  Left alone with Jared, Nash informs him that he does not believe the coincidence of Jared being Asa's son; he is certain he is scamming the family.  Jared tells Nash it is not coincidence, it's destiny - after all he has been following Asa's life since he was a child.  Jared claims to have never expected to be a Buchanan.  Before leaving, Nash threatens bodily harm to Jared if he hurts Natalie anymore than he already has.  Jared caringly picks up a scarf that Natalie has dropped.  Jared enters the mansion and encounters Bo.  Bo informs him that Clint is phoning his sons with the news and Rene is planning a party to celebrate.  Bo tells Jared he does not trust him and will continue to investigate him.  Bo tells Jared that Rene has already lost a son as well as Asa; she cannot accept another loss.  He warns Jared that if he discovers he is not really a Buchanan he will regret it.  Jared insists he is not pulling a scam and offers his \"brother\" a truce; Bo is not amused.\n\n\nBack at Capricorn, Jessica and Natalie reveal the results of Jared's DNA test to a disgusted Sarah.  Natalie sits alone and begins drinking her sorrows away.  As Jared looks at Asa's portrait on the mantel, he looks sad as he holds Natalie's scarf.   Cris stares at a picture of Evangeline.  He looks down at his ringing cell phone and ignores Sarah's call.  Heartbroken, Cris curls up in Evangeline's empty hospital bed and cuddles her picture that he has placed beside him.   Adriana tries to comfort Sarah, who continues to sadly look down at her cell phone. Dorian gives Rex her blessing and tells him she was just trying to find out if he had thought the idea of marriage entirely through.  Unsure of Dorian's motives, Rex thanks her and gives her a halfhearted hug.  Before leaving, Rex tells Dorian he plans to spend the rest of his life making Adriana happy.  Later, Rex stares through a jewelry store window at a display of expensive diamond rings.  Sadly, he turns away.  Meanwhile, Dorian holds a picture of her and Clint and another of Rex and Adriana.  Dorian cuts both Clint and Rex out of the photos.  She tapes her and Adriana's pictures together and cuts up Clint and Rex's faces.  Cole arrives at Langston's home and is greeted by an elated Starr.  The two kiss as Langston smiles affectionately at them.  As Miles sleeps, Roxy lovingly paints his nails.  As Natalie continues to drink, John arrives at Capricorn.  Both are unaware of the others presence.  Natalie has had several shots and John has just begun.  Natalie observes him sitting at the bar and joins him.  As John pours Natalie a drink, she asks him if he is okay.  He sadly replies no.  Natalie states that neither is she.  Both continue to drink.\n\n\n",
