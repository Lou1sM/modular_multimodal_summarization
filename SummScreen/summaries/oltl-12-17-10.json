    "soap_central": "\n\nIn the school gym, Destiny and Darren were shocked that Eddie Ford was dead, and Matthew questioned who had killed Eddie.  Darren said that the cops did not have any suspects, \"but from what it sounds like, a lot of people had a good reason to hate the guy.\"\n\n\nIn another part of the gym, Nate admitted to Dani that he had not been surprised to learn of his dad's death.  Dani wondered why Nate had not mentioned to her that his dad had died, just as Destiny, Darren, and Matthew walked up to them.  Destiny offered her condolences.  Nate admitted that it was hard to feel sorry about someone that he had barely known.  Nate was also surprised that Eddie had not been murdered sooner.\n\n\nDani believed that Nate needed time to let his dad's death sink in, so Destiny asked Darren for a ride home.  After they walked off, Matthew expressed sympathy to Nate, but Nate yelled that Matt had just lied, because he had called Inez a whore.  Matthew responded to Dani, \"Yeah, cause she is a whore and a home wrecker.  His mom is sleeping with my dad.\"\n\n\nNate demanded that Matthew \"take it back,\" but Matthew refused and stormed off.  When Dani offered comfort to Nate, he insisted that he had to leave.\n\n\nDestiny realized that Eddie's death was probably tearing Nate up.  However, Darren was upset that Destiny was not concerned over her treatment of her own parents.  Darren abruptly left.  Matthew walked up to Destiny and said that Darren could not understand.  \"He has no idea what it's like for your parents to betray you.\"\n\n\nDestiny expressed that she was tired of being the one blamed for everything, and Matthew indicated that he could relate her feelings.  Matthew then stressed that he did not know what he would do without Destiny, and they hugged.\n\n\nAt Todd's mansion, Todd announced to T\u00e9a and Blair that he had found the other cufflink, and T\u00e9a wondered why Todd had lied to John.  Blair wanted to know what else Todd had lied about.  Blair pondered, \"Okay, maybe I'm just being a little too subtle here, so why don't we try this...did you kill Eddie Ford?\"\n\n\nTodd cried to Blair and T\u00e9a, \"Is this good cop, worst cop?\"  Todd then claimed that he had been nowhere near the crime scene and insisted that Eddie Ford had not been important enough to kill.  Blair reflected that Todd had not really had a motive.  Blair then spied the look that Todd and T\u00e9a gave each other and demanded to know what they were not telling her.\n\n\nBlair questioned if the look had to do with Starr, and Todd insisted that he had a rule to stay out of his kids' love lives.  Blair speculated that Eddie had been an abuser.  Blair then demanded that T\u00e9a tell her what the look had been about.  T\u00e9a's phone rang, before she had a chance to respond.\n\n\nIn the hospital, James told Starr that he did need to talk to someone, and that the someone would be the police.  James ran into John at the door.  John had overheard James's statement and offered for James to give a statement at the police station.\n\n\nOn the phone, Starr asked T\u00e9a to help James, and T\u00e9a left the mansion to act as James's lawyer.  After T\u00e9a ran out, Blair asked Todd again if he had killed Eddie Ford, and if so, why.  Todd replied, \"Read my lips, Blair.  I did not kill Eddie Ford.  But I would have if he hadn't followed my warning.\"  Blair asked, \"Warning about what?\"  Todd answered, \"About Dani.\"\n\n\nTodd revealed that he had warned Eddie to stay away from Dani.  Todd then pointed out that if he had wanted to kill Eddie, he would not have hired Rex to investigate him.  Blair claimed that Todd might have wanted Rex to get Eddie's routine, so he could plan Eddie's murder.  Todd agreed that would have been a good plan.  However, Todd declared that he had only wanted for Eddie to stay away from Dani.  Todd did believe that James was a hero for killing Eddie though.\n\n\nBlair then questioned why Todd's cufflink was at the crime scene, and Todd insisted that someone had tried to set him up.  Blair asked, \"Why would someone set you up, Todd?  I mean, who would want to see you go down for murder?\"  Todd responded, \"You want a list?\"  Blair acknowledged, \"Well, that's a good point\" and made Todd promise not to get arrested.  Blair then left without opening the box from Eli.\n\n\nAt the police station, T\u00e9a met James, Starr, and John.  Once they entered John's office, John asked, \"What do you know about your father's death?\"  James revealed that he had found a gun in his dad's duffel bag, and that he then had gone to the Minute Man Motel to kill his father.  Starr yelled that James had not killed his father, but John stopped her.  John asked James if he had killed Eddie.\n\n\nJames reflected that he had found his dad in the hotel room and had pointed the gun at him.  James remembered that he had ordered Eddie to leave town, so that Eddie could no longer torment his family.  James declared that he had pulled the trigger, but that he had not killed Eddie.  James claimed that he had shot a hole in the wall, because Eddie was \"not worth it.\"  James stated that he had demanded that Eddie leave town, before someone killed him.  James insisted that he had then left the hotel room.\n\n\nJohn asked, \"Where's the gun?\"  James believed that he had tossed it aside at the hotel.  Starr felt that someone else had found the gun and had shot Eddie.  John asked James if anyone had seen him at the hotel, and James said, \"No.\"  After John released James, he asked T\u00e9a how many clients she had in the case.  T\u00e9a snarled that she only had one, since Todd was not considered a suspect.\n\n\nStarr and James thanked T\u00e9a, as she walked out of John's office.  After T\u00e9a left, James apologized to Starr.  Starr had feared in John's office that James would admit that he had shot Eddie.  However, James stated that the thought of Starr had stopped him from pulling the trigger.  James had remembered in the office that Starr had lost Cole, because Cole had killed a horrible monster.  James insisted that he could not put Starr through that again.  James also remembered everything that Cole had lost due to Cole's impulsive action.\n\n\nT\u00e9a returned to the mansion and stated that she believed that James was innocent.  T\u00e9a claimed that someone else had entered Eddie's hotel room, after James had left.  T\u00e9a believed that someone else had killed Eddie.  Todd shook his head and blared, \"Don't look at me.\"  Todd walked out of the room.\n\n\nDani arrived at the mansion, and T\u00e9a greeted her.  T\u00e9a told Dani to relax for a while, before Dani did her homework.  Dani sat on the couch and remembered her conversation with Nate, when he had admitted that he had not been surprised to hear that Eddie was dead.\n\n\nAt Inez's apartment, Clint told Inez that her debt would be paid, if Inez kept the secret that Bo and Inez had actually not slept together.  Clint revealed that as long as Inez kept her secret, he would keep it secret that he had seen one of her sons at the crime scene.  When Inez demanded to know which son Clint had seen, Clint proclaimed, \"Who said it was just one of them?\"\n\n\nInez insisted that no one would believe Clint, because her sons had nothing to do with Eddie's death.  Inez then thought of a gun that had laid on her couch after Nate had returned home.  Inez screamed that Clint could not use her sons like that, and Clint yelled for Inez to keep her mouth shut and to let Bo continue to believe that they had slept together.\n\n\nWhen Nate walked in, Clint announced that he was leaving.  As Inez escorted Clint out, she regretted that she had ever helped Clint.  After Inez returned inside her apartment, she began to tell Nate about his dad.  However, Nate told her that he already knew about his dad's death.  Nate had a question of his own.  \"Is it true that you slept with Commissioner Buchanan?\"\n\n\nAt the accident site, Bo hoped for Nora to return to him, as Nora crawled out of the woods.  Bo and Nora hugged and kissed.  Nora told Bo that she had been very scared.  Nora added that she had tried to wake up Rex in the car after the accident.  However, Nora informed Bo that when Rex would not wake up, she had left to get help.  Yet, Nora could not remember where she had been after she left the car.\n\n\nNora exclaimed that Eddie Ford had held her hostage, and she begged Bo to \"get Eddie Ford.\"  Bo revealed to Nora that it had already been taken care of.\n\n\nAt the hospital, when Natalie walked into Rex's room, she found him attempting to put on his shirt.  Natalie helped Rex, and then they hugged.  Natalie was relieved to find Rex \"in one piece.\"  Rex only hoped that the same could be said about Nora.\n\n\nRex revealed that Nora had not been in the car when he had woken up.  Rex explained that Eddie Ford had kept Nora as a hostage at the Minute Man Motel, and that Eddie had been the one who had sent the text messages to Bo.  When Rex stressed that he had found Nora gagged and bound to a chair, Natalie realized that the red hair that she had found at the crime scene had been Nora's.  Natalie then wondered why Eddie had kidnapped Nora.  Rex explained that Nora had been convinced that Eddie had wanted to break up Bo and Nora.\n\n\nWhen Natalie reentered Rex's room, she announced that she had seen Bo and Nora in another hospital cubicle.  Rex was relieved and happy that Nora was okay.  Natalie cheered that Rex had rescued Nora, and that she was lucky to have Rex as a brother.\n\n\nRex asked about Natalie's response to John's marriage proposal, and Natalie exclaimed that she had said yes.  She pleaded with Rex not to tell anyone, because she did not want Marty to know.  Rex pointed out that Natalie could not keep it a secret forever.  However, Natalie was not yet prepared to tell John the truth about the baby, or to tell Marty about the marriage proposal.  \"Rex, it's just I'm so close to having everything that I want.\"\n\n\nIn another hospital room, as Nora lay in a bed, the nurse declared that Nora was \"dehydrated and a little shocky,\" so the doctor had treated her with fluids.  The nurse announced that Nora would then be able to return home.  When Bo asked Nora what she wanted, Nora replied, \"A cheeseburger.\"  Nora then insisted that she just wanted Bo to stay with her.\n\n\nStill shaken, Nora revealed that Eddie had touched her but had not raped her.  Nora remembered that was because Eddie had needed to leave.  Nora pleaded with Bo to \"lock him up for good.\"  Bo then announced that Eddie was dead.\n\n\nNora voiced that Eddie had been \"a despicable, vile, sadistic excuse for a human being,\" and that she had not sent the text messages to Bo.  After Bo nodded, Nora cried that she was upset, because she would never have just taken off.  When Bo said that he was sorry, Nora insisted that Bo had nothing to be sorry for.\n\n\nBo claimed that he had only wanted to talk to Nora and then wondered why Eddie would kidnap her.  Bo also questioned who had put Eddie up to it.  Nora believed that it was someone who had wanted Bo and Nora's marriage to fail.  Nora announced that Inez was on the top of that list.\n\n\nNora said, \"I don't want to fight about this, Bo.  I really don't, but I can't really think of anyone else but Inez who would want to get in the way of our marriage.  Who else would do this?  After all, Eddie was her ex-husband, and although he didn't admit it, he did hint that she was pulling the strings.  It doesn't matter that it was a stupid plan, and it failed, because they didn't know you like I know you.  Even when you're mad, it would take a lot more than a few texts to goad you into the arms of another woman.  That's why I love you so much.  I will always love you, always love you.  Hey, hey, what's going on?  Did I say something wrong?\"  Bo sadly stated, \"Red, there's something that I have to tell you.\"\n\n\nStill in his office at the police station, John wrote out a list of suspects on a sheet of paper:  Todd Manning, Robert Ford, Inez Salinger, Nate Salinger, and James Ford.  John crossed out the name, James Ford. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Bo is trying and failing to find Nora, she appears out of nowhere. She seems to be ok. but Bo urges her to go to the E.R. She reveals that Eddie \"violated\" her although he did not rape her. She urges Bo to put Eddie away. He tells her that it's no longer an issue because Eddie is dead. John tells James he needs to come down to the station to answer some qu3estions. James does not seem to be afraid of his questions and admits that he took the gun, went to Eddie's motel room, pulled the gun on him and pulled the trigger. Starr comes with him and calls Tea to represent him and they are both really worried about James incriminating himself. But he tells John that although he wanted to shoot Eddie dead, he realized he could not go through with it, ruin his life because of trash like Eddie, nor put Starr through what she's already had to go through with Cole going to prison for pulling the trigger on an evil person. John then concludes that he doubts that James did it. But he suspects Todd, Robert Ford, Inez and Nate. Tea also informs Todd she believes that James is innocent but is not so certain that Todd is innocent. Clint tells Inez that she needs to make Bo and Nora believe that he cheated on Nora with her or else both of her son's will be implicated for murder. After Matthew informs both Nate and Dani that he saw Inez with his dad, Nate asks his mom if it's true. Nora tells Bo that she knows that somebody was pulling Eddie's strings to send him the emails that she (Nora) wanted Bo to sleep with Inez. She knows of nobody besides of Inez who would put Eddie up to it. And she knows that Bo would never cheat on her. But, he realizes that he has to confess to her that that is not true.",
