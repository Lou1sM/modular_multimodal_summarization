Jessica tells Antonio that she has made a mistake. She thinks that with all of Nash's baggage he may hurt Layla. Antonio doesn't understand then why she set them up. Todd rushes down from the rooftop. Blair and Spencer lay motionless. Spencer hears Todd arrive and go to Blair who is a few feet away from him. \"You killed her,\" Spencer says. Todd ignores him and tends to Blair. Todd calls for an ambulance and gives them the location. Spencer can't move but he can see Todd when he turns his head. He blames Todd for what he has done. When Todd tries to move Blair, Spencer tells him not to. \"What do you care?\" Todd snaps. Spencer says that he loves Blair and would give his life for her. He asks Todd if he would do the same. The sirens of the ambulance are soon heard and Todd takes a nearby garbage bag and throws it in Spencer's direction. It lands perfectly and Spencer is hidden from view. Spencer falls into unconsciousness, so when the EMT attendants arrive, they don't see Spencer Truman and Todd doesn't let on that the crazy bastard is there. Blair is loaded into the ambulance and carted off to the hospital. At the hospital, Blair is brought in and Michael puts Todd in the hall so that he can assess Blair's situation. Bo has gotten a call that there was an accident and that Spencer might be involved. He heads to the warehouse with backup and with guns drawn they start searching the area thinking that Spencer might be inside. \"Hey commissioner!\" Bo comes running. They find an unconscious Spencer laying with the garbage. Bo checks for a pulse. Todd is in the emergency room when Spencer is brought in. He just looks down at the man, unmoved. \"Where's you find Spencer?\" Todd asks Bo when he sees the man walking up. Bo isn't sure what happened at the warehouse, but he knows that Todd is under arrest for kidnapping. He gets the brass cuffs out and waves them at Todd. Todd says that Bo can't do this now. Blair is fighting for her life. \"You will have to shoot me to get me away from here.\" Bo says that he can arrange that. Bo is firm about taking the man in, and so Todd puts his wrists out to get cuffed. The door to Blair's room flies open and Blair is pushed out on her gurney. \"We have to get her to OR right away!\" someone shouts. The gurney stops momentarily so that Todd can talk to Blair who is now awake. \"You'll be okay,\" he tells her. \"Oh Todd,\" Blair whimpers. \"What about the baby?\" Todd's face goes pale.
