    "soap_central": "\n I Can't Get No...\n\n\n\"I'm in. They don't suspect a thing,\" T\u00e9a whispered to someone on the phone while she waited for Todd's hearing to begin. \"Everything is going according to plan.\" Her conversation came to an abrupt end when Marty, who wanted to speak to her, interrupted. Marty advised the lawyer that she shouldn't be defending a psychopath, while T\u00e9a put the blame on Nora, because the district attorney had spoken to Todd alone. Marty couldn't believe that T\u00e9a would even represent a man who had done such awful things to her in the past. \"Every defendant deserves his day in court,\" T\u00e9a stated mechanically. It was a phrase she used often. She told Marty that she had merely visited Todd out of curiosity, having already been in Llanview. She stepped in when it was apparent that he needed help, she added. \n\n\nMarty explained that she didn't know Todd when she was with him and she was a prisoner who was told lies, but that T\u00e9a did know about Todd and was willing to stick with him anyway. T\u00e9a smiled that Todd was charming and she couldn't walk away. The women went back and forth and finally, T\u00e9a asked Marty if she was angry at her or jealous that Todd had been hers once before. Marty replied by giving T\u00e9a a resounding slap in the face. None too soon, Nora arrived and put the conflict to a halt. \n\n\nAntonio sat at the counter at the Buenos D\u00edas Caf\u00e9 and perused the daily newspaper, full of articles on Todd's case. He confidently told Carlotta that he knew why T\u00e9a had probably shown up in Llanview, and that it was to represent Todd. When Cris arrived and shared the news that he was getting married, Carlotta was thrilled. Her excitement changed to irritation after Cris added that Vanessa would be his bride. Antonio choked on his coffee and tried to get his brother to explain himself. \n\n\nClaiming to feel sorry for Sarah, Cris explained that he had fallen in love with Vanessa. Antonio failed to believe Cris and demanded to know the truth. Reluctant at first to talk to Antonio, Cris explained that Vanessa had received a death threat. He needed to see that she and Lola remained safe in Llanview. Antonio asked to see it so that he could have it checked out, but Cris advised him that he had given it to T\u00e9a. \n\n\nAt a nearby table, Rex placed his order for water, advising Noelle that he didn't have any money for anything else. He confessed to his plan of wanting to sell all of his possessions so that he would be able to buy the Z-Box video game system for Shane for Christmas. While he admitted he wanted to be thought of as a hero, he also felt that Shane had been through tough times and he wanted to cheer him up. Noelle described the past and the difficult Christmases that Gigi had with no money. She would give the money to Rex if she herself had any, she told him sadly. As Rex continued to look at his computer, he jumped up excitedly. Someone had purchased his flat screen television for $500 and he would be able to buy his gift. \n\n\nMeanwhile, Antonio advised Cris that he couldn't personally save the world, and would be committing fraud by marrying Vanessa. Cris insisted that he only cared about what was happening with the Montezes. Antonio wondered if Vanessa was also his type, as T\u00e9a had suggested previously. He continued that Cris was playing with fire and would go to jail. He was further convinced that Vanessa had an agenda and that Cris would lose Sarah, too. He asked if Vanessa had displayed how grateful she was. Cris mentioned the one kiss that he pulled away from. \n\n\nAntonio vowed to find out if the threat was legitimate and advised Cris again that what he was doing was illegal. He felt sure that it would also make him a target as well. He reminded Cris that Ray Montez had stated that Vanessa had set him up and she could be doing the same to Cris. Antonio and Cris decided that T\u00e9a would be dead if Carlotta learned that she was behind the marriage idea. Antonio urged Cris to think about his actions, seeing no upside to the choice he made. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Dorian tried, but failed, to dissuade Starr and Cole from going to Todd's hearing. She expressed her opinion that T\u00e9a was clever and ruthless and had a special bond with Todd and she was therefore leery of things going well. Starr thought that while T\u00e9a had been nice to her, she still didn't trust her. Dorian provided Cole with information on a neurologist for Marty. Moe, who Dorian insisted on calling Maurice, had the teens sit down to a cooked breakfast before they left. \n\n\nHaving her offer of a day of shopping turned down by Starr, Dorian asked Moe to go with her instead. The chef explained that he already had everything he needed. He asked her if she had a special fellow on her list and a teary-eyed Dorian told him about Mel, her deceased husband. She enlightened him on the plane crash and the fact that his body had never been found. \n\n\nIn his cell, a visitor awoke an unsuspecting Todd. Margaret begged him for a second chance, like Marty had given him. She pointed out that they had been lovers, too. Todd denied that and ordered her out of his head but she laughed that it was too late. She was in his head for good. Though she swore that she had changed, Todd growled that he would kill her if she wasn't dead already. When the guard yelled that it was time for court, Todd woke up with a jolt. \n\n\nAt the Hallowed Grounds, Sarah met up with Talia and Layla, and shared her news of the upcoming marriage of Cris and Vanessa. The women were appalled. In response to the report of the threat against Vanessa being a reason for her staying in the United States, Talia pointed out that the person who made the threat was already nearby. Sarah blamed T\u00e9a for the turn of events, and Layla suggested that the attorney \"had to go.\" Sarah was convinced that the real snake was Vanessa, indicating that her hugs and walking around half naked in the loft were what caused Cris to make his decision. The others nodded their heads in agreement. Sarah was convinced that she had to break up with Cris if he went through with it. Talia planned on checking out the death threat. \n\n\nRex despondently arrived at the coffee shop after learning that all of the video game systems were sold out at the mall. Layla gave him a tip after overhearing a conversation from some nearby customers. She advised him that she still hated him after he ditched Adriana. \n\n\nJohn and Blair met at Angel Square and discussed the reasons for T\u00e9a showing up when she did. Blair noted that T\u00e9a was a shark, worse than most other lawyers. When John suggested that Blair push her through a window, an embarrassed Blair quickly told him that the previous incident years earlier had been an accident. John grinned, declaring that he wouldn't stand near Blair and any windows. They made their way to Todd's hearing as Starr and Cole arrived. Todd walked in at the same time and made his way to the front, as Blair urged him not to stop to talk to anyone. He wondered what T\u00e9a had said to cause Marty to hit her. \n\n\nTodd's preliminary hearing got underway. T\u00e9a asked that all charges be dropped, citing lack of evidence by the Commonwealth. Nora advised the judge that she had an eyewitness, though T\u00e9a challenged that, suggesting that the witness wasn't credible. The women got into a war of words, with the annoyed judge finally asking that the eyewitness take the stand. Todd told T\u00e9a that he didn't want Marty to testify. He said that he also didn't trust T\u00e9a as a lawyer and would fire her on the spot if she hurt Marty. Nora suggested that Marty speak to the judge privately if it would make her feel more at ease. Marty agreed to take the stand and was sworn in. T\u00e9a asked Marty if she was in love with Todd. \n\n\nAs Rex followed his lead in Angel Square, he learned that the seller had just sold his last two games to the woman standing nearby. Turning around, Rex saw Dorian happily stowing her purchases in her shopping bag. \n\n\nAs Antonio ordered Cris not to blow it with Sarah, she walked through the door.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Dorian finds out from Mo that he values other things more than material wealth. Rex has a similar conversation with Noelle when he tells her how he is determined to find a very expensive Christmas gift for Shane to make up for the time they've lost. While Todd's trial is underway, Tea makes it clear that she will not allow her client to be railroaded nor denied a fair trial by the prosecution or the people that don't like him. After Antonio finds out that Cristian has married Vanessa in order to keep her safe from going back to Columbia, he tells his brother he could be in legal trouble as well as trusting a woman who may not be worthy of his trust.",
