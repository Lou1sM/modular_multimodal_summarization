    "soap_central": "\nThe Apparent Trap\n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Langston was thrilled to spend a few moments alone with Markko, but he couldn't forget the prediction that Madame Delphina had made - the Cramer women were in danger.   Certain that Madame Delphina's prediction was a result of her jealousy over Amelia marrying Dorian, Langston stated that she didn't have any fear.\n\n\nPresenting Mitch with a photo that had the faces of Blair, Starr, Addie, and Langston crossed out, an enraged Dorian accused Mitch of the dastardly deed and advised him to leave her family alone.  After denying any involvement, Mitch commented that although he was chained to the hospital bed, he had knowledge of the Cramer girls' whereabouts.  Dorian listened in horror as Mitch related that Blair was visiting T\u00e9a, Starr was at La Boulaie with Todd, and Langston was spending time with Markko at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.\n\n\nBlair paid T\u00e9a a visit at the Palace and apologized for the events that had led up to Ross's death.  Although Blair admitted her guilt, T\u00e9a refused to accept Blair's apology.  T\u00e9a insisted that Blair had a habit of using her own children to keep Todd in Blair's life.  Lashing out at Blair, T\u00e9a blamed her for spearheading Ross's violent episode.  T\u00e9a was convinced that Ross had learned of Danielle's whereabouts as a result of Blair's interference.  T\u00e9a maintained that Blair couldn't accept Todd being with another woman.\n\n\n Acknowledging that she was partially responsible, Blair advised T\u00e9a that T\u00e9a  also shared some of the guilt because T\u00e9a had lied to Todd for fifteen years about Danielle's existence.  Blair suggested that T\u00e9a work things out with Todd.  When T\u00e9a burst into tears and announced that Danielle would never forgive Todd for killing Ross, Blair responded by giving T\u00e9a a hug.  As T\u00e9a expressed concern over Todd and Danielle's relationship, Blair consoled her.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr noticed when Todd dropped the picture of Danielle that T\u00e9a had given him.  When Starr questioned the identity of the teen, Todd informed Starr that Danielle was T\u00e9a's daughter, but failed to mention that he was Danielle's father.  Once Starr inquired about Danielle's father, Todd related that Ross had lived with T\u00e9a and Danielle in Tahiti.  Starr was stunned to learn that Todd had killed Ross.  Explaining that Ross had kidnapped Danielle, Todd stated that he shot Ross in order to save Danielle's life.\n\n\nAn emotional Todd confided to Starr that Danielle hated him for killing Ross.  Starr tried to convince her father that he had acted in Danielle's best interest, and reminded Todd that he had three children who loved him very much.  When Starr offered to dispose of the photo, Todd abruptly blurted out, \"No, it's mine!\"  Claiming that the photo belonged to T\u00e9a, Todd insisted that he wanted to return the item to her.\n\n\nQuestioning whether Todd had patched things up with T\u00e9a, Starr wondered if Todd and T\u00e9a would rekindle their relationship.  Insisting that too many secrets had been uncovere d, Todd was adamant that his relationship with T\u00e9a was over.\n\n\nNora was stunned when she returned home and discovered Clint in bed with Kim.  Showing no remorse, Clint introduced Kim as his new personal assistant.  In a sarcastic tone Clint stated, \"I would've informed you of the affair, but you were always running off somewhere with Bo!\"  As Nora stared at her husband in disbelief, Clint and Kim rudely asked Nora to leave the room while Kim dressed.  \n\n\nAfter Nora left the room, Clint thanked Kim for her help and promised her a raise.  Slipping into her dress, Kim reminded him that he could call on her anytime.    Out in the hall, Kim brushed past Nora and gave her a smug look.  Unable to believe what had transpired, Nora rushed back into the bedroom to confront Clint.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Bo left Nora a voicemail.  Stating that he missed her, Bo asked Nora to phone him after she informed Clint that Danielle would be residing at the mansion.  After phoning Nora, Bo received a call from the policeman who was standing guard outside of Mitch Laurence's hospital room.  Bo was concerned when the officer alerted him that the mayor was inside Mitch's room.\n\n\nBack at the mansion, Nora approached Clint and demanded to know what was going on.   Pleased by Nora's reaction, Clint lied about his relationship with Kim.  Relating that he had met Kim before his marriage to Nora, Clint claimed that he fell in love with Kim immediately, but had decided to marry Nora anyway.  Suddenly, Nora realized that Clint was aware of her feelings for Bo.\n\n\nAdmitting that he knew about Nora's love for Bo, Clint lashed out at Nora for not revealing her feelings for Bo before the wedding.   Stating that she didn't understand her feelings for Bo at the time, Nora maintained that she had brushed her doubts aside, and married Clint because she loved him.  An angered Clint demanded that Nora be honest.  Frustrated, Nora blurted out, \"Okay, I'm in love with your brother!\"  Pleading with Clint to hear her out, Nora insisted that she had attempted to tell Clint the truth several times, but a family crisis had always seemed to prevent her from doing so.\n\n\nWhen Clint accused Nora of having an affair with Bo, Nora maintained that they had never had sex, and had only shared a kiss.  As an enraged Clint continued to berate Nora, she chastised him for sleeping with Kim.  Clint informed Nora that he hadn't slept with Kim.  Clint admitted that he had staged the scene with Kim in an attempt to make Nora feel as gullible as he had.    Consumed with guilt, Nora advised Clint that she was moving out of the mansion.   Reminding Nora that Asa had left the house to her, Clint remarked, \"You repaid Asa by cheating on both his sons!\"\n\n\nDownstairs, a half-dressed Kim ran into Nigel, who advised her that he was aware of her tricks.  Heading out the door, Kim warned Nigel that she would have him replaced if he ever dared to step out of line with her again.  Moments later, Destiny arrived at the mansion looking for Matthew.  Nigel informed Destiny that Matthew was dining at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, but she rushed off before he could warn her that Danielle had accompanied Matthew.\n\n\nBack at the hospital, Dorian demanded to know what Mitch wanted from her.  Before Mitch could respond, Bo entered the room and questioned why Dorian had paid Mitch a visit.  Mitch gave Bo a knowing look and stated, \"I'm sure you have affairs of your own to attend to!\"  Unfazed by Mitch's comment, Bo advised the prisoner that he would eventually be transported back to jail.  A confident Mitch was adamant that he would be exonerated of all charges.  As Bo exited the room, he advised Dorian that he didn't want any interference from her involving Mitch's case.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Bo instructed his officer to shoot Mitch if he made a wrong move.  Bo became alarmed when Nigel phoned and advised Bo that trouble was brewing at the mansion.\n\n\nOnce Bo had left the room, Mitch told Dorian that he wanted to discuss the terms of their agreement.   Mitch ordered Dorian to use her influence as mayor to fire Bo.  Dorian was horrified when Mitch threatened, \"Either fire Bo or say goodbye to the Cramer girls!\"\n\n\nMatthew and Danielle shared a burger at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9.  While Danielle expressed grief over her father's death, Matthew tried to console her.   The grief-stricken teen insisted that no one cared that her father was dead, not even her mother.  Touched when Matthew offered to organize a memorial service for Ross,   Danielle responded by giving her friend a hug.  At that moment, Destiny entered the caf\u00e9 and observed the embrace.\n\n\nApproaching the table, Destiny asked Danielle if her crazy father was in jail.  Unable to control her anger, Danielle screamed, \"No, my father is dead!\"    Horrified, Destiny tried to apologize, but Danielle lashed out at her and blamed Destiny for Ross's death.   As Matthew sat helplessly, Danielle insisted that Destiny had caused the chain of events by exposing that Danielle was hiding in Matthew's hospital room.  Danielle was convinced that if no one had known of her whereabouts, Ross would still be alive.\n\n\nHearing the commotion, Langston and Markko rushed out of the kitchen and witnessed Danielle's outburst.   In tears, Destiny ran out of the room, and Langston chased after her.   Gathering her belongings, Danielle asked Matthew to apologize to Destiny for her behavior and headed for the door.  Matthew pleaded with her to stay, but Danielle insisted that she needed to be alone.  Matthew watched as his friend bolted out of the caf\u00e9.\n\n\nLater, Langston escorted Destiny back to the table.  Langston and Matthew assured Destiny that Danielle didn't really blame her for Ross's death.   Matthew told Destiny that people often said things that they didn't mean when they were hurting.  Afterward, Langston and Markko both insisted that there was something very familiar about Danielle's behavior.\n\n\nNearby, Kim sat at the counter and pictured herself as Mrs. Clint Buchanan.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Starr comforted her father, who still blamed himself for causing Danielle grief.  As Todd and Starr hugged, Danielle stared at them through the window.  In a bitter tone, Danielle vowed, \"Todd Manning, you destroyed my life, now I'm going to destroy yours!\"\n\n\nBack at the Buchanan mansion, Bo rushed into the house and discovered Nora weeping as she headed down the stairs with her suitcase.  When Bo questioned what had happened, Nora warned, \"He knows!\"  As Bo assured her that everything would be fine, Clint appeared.  Pointing a rifle at them, Clint declared, \"Guess again, little brother!\" \n\n\n",
