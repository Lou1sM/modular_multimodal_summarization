Marty takes Starr to the hospital where she sees her mother and a handcuffed Todd. Starr becomes even more distraught when she learns that her mother could be pregnant with Spencer Truman's baby. Cole tries to give Starr hope by reminding her that not only could the baby be Todd's but he or she may also be what her family needs to get back on track.\n\n\nBlair tells a stunned Todd that he is the father of her unborn child. Todd doesn't acknowledge her pregnancy until Blair reveals that she had her doctor run a DNA test that proved that Todd is the father. As Blair is prepped for surgery, Todd begs Bo to let him stay by Blair's side until he knows that she is going to be all right. Starr offers to watch over her father and promises Bo that Todd will not try to run. After Blair is wheeled into the OR, Todd stands by helplessly as he tells her to be strong and hold on. \n\n\nMarty takes issue with Michael when he volunteers to operate on a badly injured Spencer. When Michael wonders what Marty is concerned about, Marty reminds him that operating on the man who destroyed his family is a dire conflict of interest. Michael wonders if Marty is concerned that he will harm Spencer just as Spencer killed his father on an operating table. Marty tries to reason with Michael but he informs her that he is a professional and doesn't need her expert opinion about his situation. In the OR, Michael hesitates slightly over Spencer's body with a scapel in hand as he begins to operate on Spencer.\n\n\nJessica decides to take Bree out for a drive after Antonio is called into work. They run into Nash who is on way back to his room after his date with Layla. Jessica quizzes him about his night so much that Nash tells her he and Layla had such a god time that he asked her to marry him. Nash confesses that he was joking and although he and Layla have made plans to see each other again, he feels that Jessica had no right to interfere in his life. Jessica apologizes and Nash eases up a bit telling her that although her heart was in the right place, he doesn't need or want her pity. After dropping Nash off Jessica returns home and puts Bree down to bed. When Antonio calls to check up on them and to tell Jessica that he is going to be at the station a little while longer, Jessica lies and tells him that she was at home the whole time right where he left her.\n\n\nAdriana is furious when she discovers that her mother invested in her and Layla's new business venture. Layla tries to convince Adriana that whether they like it or not they could use the money that Dorian has put up. Adriana argues that Dorian only invested in the company as a way to control Adriana's life. Layla suggests that maybe Dorian is trying to make up for her mistakes. Adriana shares with Layla some of Dorian's dastardly deeds and informs her that they will have to find money somewhere else. Rex runs after Adriana while Layla calls Evangeline to tell her about her non-date fun with Nash. Evangeline shares with Layla the details of the encounter she and Cris had with Vincent Jones where Cris warned him to stay away from Natalie and then shared with him that Layla was out on a date. Layla wonders how the encounter ended and Evangeline tells her that Vincent took off when he was told that one of his warehouses on the docks was on fire.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Antonio and Jessica are making love, when the phone rings. Antonio hates to do it but he answers. Jessica goes to the window and sees Nash and Layla walking. They are smiling and familiar. They laugh and then hug. Antonio comes to Jessica at the window to tell that he has been called into work. Jessica ventures to the window again after Antonio leaves but the baby starts crying and so she tends to her. Jessica dresses the child and gets in the car to see the Christmas lights. She finds Nash walking and offers him a ride. He accepts and wonders what she is doing there. She tells that the baby wouldn't sleep. She asks about the date and learns that Nash and Layla hit it out of the park and will be seeing each other again. \"That's great,\" Jessica manages to say. Blair is wheeled off for her surgery. \"Is it mine or Truman's?\" Michael tells Todd that he has to do this surgery or Blair could possibly bleed out on the inside. He follows Blair's gurney out of the area. Bo starts walking to Todd again to cuff him. Todd tells the man that his family is on the line right now and he begs to be allowed to stay at the hospital. \"Blair's pregnant!\" Bo had no idea. Spencer is laying nearby on his stretcher and he overhears Todd talking to Bo. \"Blair's pregnant? Then we're gonna have a family,\" Spencer says. \"I got to tell Blair how happy I am that we are going to have a baby,\" Spencer smirks from his gurney. Todd's face turns lethal and it is a good thing that Bo is there to stand before him and stop him from taking the couple of steps over to the man to fix his wagon again. \"Dad! Dad!\" Starr shouts running in. \"Where's mom? Is she going to be alright?\" She looks up into her father's face frantic with worry. He isn't pleased to see Marty and her son there, but Bo explains that he left Starr with Marty when he got the emergency call and that there isn't anything to worry about. Starr overhears Spencer ranting about Blair having his baby and he turns to her father horrified that this could be true. Todd can't answer her. He doesn't know. Michael lets Todd go and see Blair but only for two minutes. Todd comes to Blair now. He touches her hand. \"We have to talk Todd. We have to talk about the baby,\" she tells him in a small voice. Starr is upset and so Cole sits with her and tells her that this might not be a bad thing. Maybe it will be something that brings your parents back together again. Todd goes in to see Blair before her surgery. She is weak but glad to see him. \"I have to talk to you. I did a DNA test. The baby is yours.\" Todd breathes a sigh of relief and Blair is wheeled away for surgery.",
