    "soap_central": "\n...and Rex Went Z, Z, Z All The Way Home\n\n\nInside the courtroom, T\u00e9a drilled Marty on the witness stand. T\u00e9a asked Marty if she was in love with Todd. Humiliated, Marty answered, \"I'm not in love with Todd Manning. Not anymore!\" Pleased by Marty's confession, T\u00e9a went for the jugular and asked Marty if was she in love with Todd on the night they had sex. While Nora argued that T\u00e9a had no basis for asking such a question during a preliminary hearing, T\u00e9a maintained that she needed to prove Marty's state of mind at the time of the alleged rape. To Nora's dismay, the judge allowed T\u00e9a to continue her direct questioning of Marty. Meanwhile, Todd looked uncomfortable as he watched Marty struggle on the stand. Blair, Starr, Cole, and John sat in the courtroom with looks of contempt, disgusted by T\u00e9a's treatment of Marty. John whispered to Blair, \"What do you think so far?\" Blair stated, \"I think she's evil.\" \n\n\nClaiming that she would prove that the charges against Todd were groundless, T\u00e9a continued to question Marty. When Marty attempted to deflect her questioning, the judge instructed Marty to answer. Again, T\u00e9a asked, \"Were you in love with Todd when you had sex with him?\" With a pained look, Marty answered truthfully, \"Yes.\" Nora argued that an amnesiac wasn't capable of giving consent. She maintained that Todd withheld important facts from Marty and made her dependent upon him. Nora insisted that Marty wouldn't have had sex with Todd had she known the facts surrounding his identity. When Nora maintained that Todd raped Marty by denying her the right to say no, T\u00e9a remarked, \"Was it considered rape when the District Attorney slept with her gay husband, Daniel Colston?\" Fed up with T\u00e9a's antics, Todd interrupted and demanded that the judge put an end to T\u00e9a's questioning of Marty. \n\n\nAs the judge called order in the court, Todd expressed his displeasure with T\u00e9a. Todd accused her of treating Marty harshly. He reminded her that she had been instructed not to treat mistreat Marty on the stand. Glaring at him, T\u00e9a ordered Todd to sit down and be quiet. T\u00e9a was adamant that she needed to force the truth out of Marty at the preliminary hearing. She explained that if the case went to trial, Marty would endure a more brutal form of questioning. Todd allowed T\u00e9a to continue her questioning. \n\n\nT\u00e9a asked Marty if she had access to the Internet while residing in Todd's home. When Marty acknowledged that she had researched her rape over the Internet, T\u00e9a questioned why she continued to stay with Todd upon learning that he had raped her. Marty explained that Todd had convinced her not to read the article in its entirety, therefore she had no idea that he was one of her rapists. Turning the tables on Nora, T\u00e9a maintained that Marty did what Todd asked because she loved him. Nora objected, but the judge allowed T\u00e9a to continue. \n\n\nT\u00e9a questioned Marty about the night that she consoled Todd after he had received a call from Starr at the hospital. T\u00e9a asked Marty if she had made an attempt to seduce Todd that night. A humiliated Marty admitted that she had hoped to make Todd feel better and that he had asked her to leave. T\u00e9a argued that Marty didn't leave when Todd asked her; instead she invited him to follow her upstairs. T\u00e9a forced Marty to admit that Todd didn't initiate sex with her right away. Marty acknowledged that Todd had said that he didn't want to hurt her. T\u00e9a asked Marty if they made love after Marty had told Todd that she loved him. Pleading with T\u00e9a to understand that she didn't know who Todd was at the time, Marty relented that she would have run out of the house screaming had she known the truth. She yelled that it was rape. T\u00e9a argued that Marty had sex with Todd because she loved him. When T\u00e9a urged Marty to admit that she wanted to have sex with Todd, Marty burst into tears. While Todd looked distraught, John and Cole sat helpless. \n\n\nCiting that the sex was consensual, T\u00e9a asked the judge to throw out the rape charge. Although Nora argued her case, the judge dismissed the rape charge. A look of shock crossed Marty's face. Cole exploded and threatened to kill Todd if the judge let Todd go. After John restrained Cole, the judge called a recess. \n\n\nOut in the hall, Cole tried to comfort his mother but Marty pulled away and told him that he couldn't fix the problem. John reminded Cole that his mother wasn't herself. Walking away, a pained Cole remarked, \"She never will be!\" Starr ran after him. When John suggested that he check on Marty, Blair stated that since Marty was in the ladies room, Blair would attempt to calm her down. \n\n\nInside the ladies room, Marty was consumed by thoughts of Todd. Blair offered Marty support. She told her that Todd was a difficult person to forget. Blair commended Marty on the progress that she had made, and stated that she hoped Marty didn't lose sight of that fact. \n\n\nBack inside the courtroom, Nora warned T\u00e9a to be careful. Reminding T\u00e9a that Todd had already punched her in the face in the past, Nora wondered what Todd would do to her if she lost the case. T\u00e9a appeared to ponder Nora's question. \n\n\nWhen the hearing commenced, T\u00e9a called to dismiss the counts of kidnapping and false imprisonment. T\u00e9a announced that she was calling John McBain to the stand. \n\n\nIn Angel Square Park, Rex approached Dorian and asked if he could purchase one of the two Z-Box video gaming systems that she had in her possession. When Rex begged Dorian to allow him to purchase one of the systems for Shane, Dorian outright refused. She told him that the two systems were gifts for Jack and Sam. Reminding Rex of the pain he had caused Adriana, Dorian declared that she had no sympathy concerning Rex's dilemma. Although Rex continued to plead his case to her, Dorian laughed and walked away. \n\n\nLater, Rex sat in a booth at the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9. He tried to make a deal over the phone to purchase the Z-Box, but his contact told him that the item couldn't be found anywhere. At a nearby booth, a woman and her young son were having lunch. Rex's attention was drawn to the little boy's newly purchased Z-Box. The woman asked a waitress to keep an eye on their packages while they went to the restroom. The waitress agreed and walked away. Rex couldn't keep his eyes off the gaming system. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, Markko waited for Langston to get dressed so that they could attend Vanessa and Cristian's wedding. To his surprise, Langston appeared wearing a beautiful dress. She informed Markko that she had purchased dresses for both Vanessa and Lola. Langston hoped that everything would go according to plan-Cristian would marry Vanessa and Lola would remain in Llanview. \n\n\nAt Cris's loft, Lola observed Vanessa staring at the wedding ring that Ray had given her. When Lola asked why Vanessa was still wearing Ray's ring, Vanessa stated that it was possible to hate someone and still love them at the same time. Upon reminding her stepdaughter that the ring once belonged to Lola's grandmother, Vanessa presented the ring to Lola. After accepting the ring, an excited Lola asked if Vanessa and Cris would have rings for their own wedding. Realizing that Lola was anticipating the wedding, Vanessa warned her that Cris might change his mind. Dismissing Vanessa's warning, Lola was certain that the ceremony would take place. \n\n\nMoments later, Langston and Markko arrived at the loft. Lola was delighted to receive her new dress. She assured Vanessa that the wedding would take place. Vanessa reminded Lola to thank Cris for everything he had done. She also acknowledged that they should be grateful to Sarah for being understanding. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Cris proclaimed his love for Sarah and pleaded with her to understand his reason for marrying Vanessa. A distraught Sarah told Cris that she loved him, but was unwilling to be the other woman. Sarah couldn't believe that Cris was willing to discard their relationship in order to keep Vanessa and Lola in the country. Recalling the threat that had been made against her life, Cris insisted that he was marrying Vanessa because he feared that she and Lola were in danger. When Sarah inquired how Cris marrying Vanessa would eliminate the danger, Cris announced that he planned to protect Vanessa and Lola. Cris's response left Sarah heartbroken. Near tears, Sarah stated, \"You made your decision Cristian, now I have to make mine.\" Realizing that Sarah couldn't accept his marriage to Vanessa, Cris walked away. \n\n\nIn the hall of the courthouse, Vanessa and Lola were pleased to find Cris waiting for them. Stating that she needed to fix her makeup, Vanessa excused herself and headed to the restroom. At that moment, Sarah appeared unnoticed in the hall. Upon spotting Vanessa, Sarah followed her into the restroom. Sarah approached a startled Vanessa. Sarah told Vanessa that she didn't trust her. Informing Vanessa that she loved Cris, Sarah announced that she wasn't going away. \n\n\nAs Cris prepared to marry Vanessa, he was stunned to witness Sarah enter the room. When the judge asked for two witnesses of legal age, Sarah sadly agreed. Cris approached Sarah, but she brushed past him and said, \"Let's get this over with before I change my mind.\" The judge asked if the witnesses were prepared to uphold and support the marriage. Glaring at Vanessa, Sarah declared, \"I'll be there.\" After Cris and Vanessa had recited their vows, an elated Lola exclaimed, \"Kiss the bride!\" A heartbroken Sarah watched as Cris kissed Vanessa.\n\n\n",
