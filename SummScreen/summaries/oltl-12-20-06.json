    "soap_central": "\n\nVincent wants to file a report with the police department; his building burned to the ground and Ted was inside, dead. It's arson and murder, plain and simple and he wants an investigation. He purchased the building to convert it to lofts and there was plenty of work done inside, without incident. He has no idea why Ted was there or what happened. Antonio is leery and Cris suggests that perhaps Vincent did it himself, for the insurance money. Vincent is angry at their reactions and tosses it back, accusing Cris of committing the crime. His insurance policy lapsed because he couldn't afford it; there is no insurance money to be collected. It will take awhile for the fire department to investigate the cause of fire, Antonio offers.\n\n\nJohn awakens to find Natalie sitting at his bedside. He admits he's in great pain but it'll be worth it to be able to get out of the hospital. No way, she replies. The skin grafts have to take first. This is the beginning of an argument, not only with Nat, but also with the nurse who comes by with medication. Natalie reads him the riot act and John finally relents, taking his pills. Vincent stops by, with the premise that he was looking for someone to talk to, that someone being Hugh in the past. He tells John about the fire and McBain realizes that his help is wanted. Vincent wants him to persuade Antonio to take him seriously and if the police don't do their work, he'll find out what happened by himself. In fact, he may get help from a certain redheaded forensics tech, he states, watching for a reaction from John. The detective actually has no problem with Vincent's asking Natalie for help because she knows how to read people, including him. They talk about their dads briefly and Vincent mentions how he had a father figure who used to take him around on his jobs across Llanview. John suggests the fire could have had to do with those activities. They agree they have something in common; they don't divulge much. Nat returns to the room and Vincent quickly leaves. He and John have more in common than he thinks, Vincent mutters. \n\n\nSpencer's surgery is not going very well and Michael wants to try an experimental drug that he and Spencer had been working on. The other doctor is quite reluctant, citing Michael's personal feelings towards the patient. Michael takes offense over his integrity being challenged and orders the nurse to get the vial. He administers the drug and Spencer's surgery is successful. Michael is sorry and would have been happy if he had failed. Out in the hallway friends and family are gathered to hear news of Blair and Spencer. Bo relents and allows Todd to stay when Marty intercedes on his behalf. Todd learns from Dorian that Blair is indeed pregnant with his child, and he and Starr head for the chapel. He tells Starr that he doesn't \"do prayer\" so she does double duty. She believes her father when he tells her he didn't push the others from the roof. A depressed Adriana (upset because her mother is trying to buy her back) arrives with Rex. Marty tells Cole that she thinks Todd could be capable of anything, including pushing Spencer and Blair from the rooftop. In Blair's operating room, doctors work to save the baby, who appears to be in distress, while Blair seems to be stabilized. Cole refuses to leave without making sure that Starr is ok. Todd is forbidden from the recovery room but whispers that he loves her and wants her to come back to him. He is forced to leave the hospital with the police but not before asking Rex and Adriana to keep Cole away from Starr. They do his bidding though Cole tells his mom that Starr needs him. \n\n\nWandering through Angel Square, Layla has a talk with Evangeline about Vincent after she mentions how everyone should have someone. She knows he's no good for her. Evangeline also encourages Cris who has taken a stab at painting again. \n\n\nJohn learns that not only did Spencer make it through surgery, but Michael was the one to save him. He is livid as Natalie tries to tell him that his brother took an oath. He is even more anxious to get out now.\n\n\nBo takes Todd back to his office. Manning is pretty upset, considering that he has Blair and the baby to worry about. Bo is not unfeeling but he wants the truth from Todd or he'll have to hold him over. They learn that Spencer will make it. Todd vows that it's over for Truman if either Blair or the baby dies. He'll make sure of it!\n\n\nSpencer finds Michael at his bedside and hears that he'll make a full recovery. Paige is happy to tell him that Blair's baby is not his. Dorian tells Marty that it's all her fault; Spencer should have been in jail. \n\n\nBlair pulls through. \"As for the baby...,\" the doctor says.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Michael's peers are worried that he shouldn't do this operation. They know that this could be a terrible mistake. Michael tells everyone that he will be fine. He wants the crazy bastard to live. Vincent has gone to the station to report the fire. Something is wrong. A man died in the fire. It was Ted. Vincent feels that this was deliberate and that a full investigation is needed. Cristian thinks that Vincent set this fire himself. He feels that this is an insurance scam for money. Trouble with that is Vincent hasn't got insurance on the building. Money was tight and he couldn't afford it. Antonio is skeptical and tells Vincent that he will call him if anything comes up. Vincent can see that he won't be getting any help from the cops. He leaves frustrated and drives around for a while, ending up at John's room. He tells the story of his troubles and tells that he only came there to talk. That was where he used to come to talk when he thought that he was talking to Hugh. John is willing to listen and at the end of it all, John sees that Vincent is really there to get some help with his case. \"I want you to get Vega and the boys in blue to start helping me If not I might get help from a certain little redheaded forensics expert.\" John knows that will never happen. He knows that Natalie knows better than to stay away from him. John asks Vincent some questions about his building but Vincent is pretty tightlipped. Vincent finds that John is that way when questioned about his family. He finds it interesting that they have this trait in common. \"That is all that we have in common,\" John assures him. Natalie returns and Vincent leaves. He watches Natalie talking to John through the window to the room and knows that they have more in common than just keeping things to themselves. Blair and Spencer go under the knife. Michael is warned over and over not to do the operation on Spencer, but he insists. He is a professional, and even Marty is strongly against this. Michael ignores everyone and does a splendid job. Spencer's life is saved. Michael wishes for the first time in his career that he hadn't been successful at an operation. \"What about my baby?\" Spencer asks when he comes to. Paige tells him that Blair is still being worked on and that just for the record, the baby isn't his. Dorian arrives and Todd walks up to her cuffed. \"Is it true that Blair got a DNA test and that the baby is mine?\" Dorian confirms that is true. Starr is thrilled and she and her father go to the chapel to pray. Blair's operation is over. The surgical staff have managed to save Blair's life for as for the baby",
