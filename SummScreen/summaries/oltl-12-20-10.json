She surmised that it was Natalie, calling again to ask Marty to keep her mouth shut. Just then, there was a knock at the door. \"How do you live with yourself?\" Todd inquired when Marty opened the door.\n\n\nHe asked why Marty had killed Eddie, and he was certain that she had made it appear as though Todd had committed the act. Marty thought that Todd was \"delusional.\" Todd accused her of breaking into his house and stealing his cufflink in order to frame him. Marty indicated that she'd read about the murder, and she believed that Todd had carried it out. She felt that Todd blamed Marty because he couldn't face the truth of his own undertaking, and he always blamed Marty for things that went wrong in his life.\n\n\nMarty suggested that Todd had acted out because Eddie had reminded Todd of his own childhood. Todd insisted that Marty had set him up, because she was vindictive. He reminded her that Starr hadn't even revoked the restraining order against Marty, and he knew how Marty's mind worked. Marty was never able to let things go, he emphasized. He vowed to continue to try to locate someone who was willing to talk about Marty.\n\n\nThe phone rang again, but Marty ignored it. \"Are you having me investigated?\" she asked Todd. She wondered if Todd were having her followed. He confessed that Rex had been investigating Marty, but Rex had \"botched\" things up. Marty realized that was how Natalie had learned about Marty's possession of the paternity test results.\n\n\nAt the police station, John and Detective Price joked about the mistletoe hanging from the ceiling in front of John's office door. They surmised that Natalie had hung it there. The detectives discussed the possible suspects in Eddie's murder, and other than Todd, they were all members of the Ford family.\n\n\nNatalie was unsuccessful in her attempts at reaching Marty on the phone, and she left multiple messages indicating that she had something to tell Marty. Natalie got to John's office as Detective Price emerged. She helped herself to a gingerbread man cookie, and John asked how long she planned to keep their engagement a secret. He spoke in a gingerbread man's high squeaky voice. Natalie thought it was fun to have a secret, but John suggested that they would have to tell everyone eventually.\n\n\nHe thought maybe they could even marry on their lunch break. Natalie stated that she had to stop people from interfering first. \"Who's gonna interfere?\" John asked. Natalie settled herself at John's desk, munching on her cookie and spied Todd's photograph on John's laptop. John ran down the list of suspects in Eddie's murder, and he informed her that Nate was dating Dani. \"There's your motive,\" Natalie guessed.\n\n\nNatalie wondered if Nora's kidnapping could also be a reason for Eddie's murder. John told her about James's statement, and he announced that he had work to do with the killer still on the loose. They moved towards the office door, but John stopped Natalie from going too far. He pointed to the mistletoe and leaned over to kiss her. \"Let me know when you want to tell your folks,\" he informed her as he walked away. Natalie wondered why Marty was ignoring her phone calls.\n\n\nNate had a question for his mother. He inquired whether Inez had slept with Bo. Matthew had told him it was true, and Matthew had seemed pretty certain about it. Nate had found it curious that Bo had been at their apartment early in the morning, and Inez's excuse for it had seemed \"lame.\" Nate had also spotted Bo's gun and holster hanging on the couch. Inez quickly changed the subject and informed her son that they had something else to talk about. She told him that Eddie was dead.\n\n\n\"Good,\" Nate replied. He couldn't begin to pretend that he was saddened with the news. Inez asked if Nate had visited Eddie's motel room. \"Mom, are you asking me if I killed him?\" Nate queried his mother. Inez promised that she'd never accuse her son of murder, but she'd known about the fight. She thought maybe Nate had gone to see Eddie or he had seen something.\n\n\nBo stayed with Nora in her hospital room. He informed her that he had something to tell her. Nora was scared as she looked at Bo's somber expression, but before Bo was able to say anything, Clint walked into the room with a get-well plant in his hand. Bo quickly updated his brother on the details regarding Nora's kidnapping and the subsequent car accident in Rex's car. Nora explained that Eddie had wanted to cause trouble in Bo and Nora's marriage, and Nora was certain that someone had put Eddie up to it. She believed it to be Inez, though Bo disagreed with her.\n\n\nClint wondered if Nora's kidnapping had anything to do with the murder, but Bo revealed that Rex had gotten Nora out of the room before the murder had occurred. The car crash had been related to an oncoming car. Clint wanted to pursue the reason for the kidnapping, and Nora thought the entire thing was \"bizarre.\" Eddie had even sent Bo text messages pretending to be Nora, she told Clint. She couldn't understand how Eddie had known that she and Bo had fought, Nora continued. Inez had been familiar with it, Nora concluded.\n\n\nBo insisted that Inez wasn't a criminal. Clint noted that people didn't always think about the law when they were doing things, and Clint knew that Inez had a \"thing\" for Bo. It wasn't a secret, and that had been the reason for Clint and Inez's breakup, Clint said. He didn't think a few texts would end a marriage. Clint was certain that Bo knew the texts hadn't been real, and he knew that Bo would never sleep with another woman or break his marriage vows. \"Right, Bo?\" Clint asked his brother.\n\n\nNora went off for some tests, and Clint asked Bo what was wrong. He could tell by Bo's behavior that something was bothering Bo. Bo responded that his wife had been kidnapped and could have been killed. Clint asked about the arguments and fights with Nora, and he prodded Bo to confide in him. Bo agreed that Clint had turned to Bo after Clint's affair with Echo, so it was Bo's turn to do the talking. \"I slept with Inez,\" Bo said. Clint appeared to be shocked.\n\n\nBo admitted that the text messages he'd received had \"messed me up.\" He'd gotten drunk and had sex with Inez, but he didn't remember anything. Clint suggested that Bo had blocked it out. Bo had been about to tell Nora the truth when Clint had walked in. It was the same advice he'd given to Clint years before. Clint insisted that his situation had been different. He'd had an affair, but Bo's was just a \"hookup\" as the kids called it. Nora would think it was a payback for Bo's comment about Sam, and he was certain it would hurt Bo's marriage. He thought that Bo should remain quiet on the subject.\n\n\nBo was proud of the fact that he was always honest, but Clint was against Bo saying anything. Nora would laugh that Bo couldn't even remember the sex, and then she'd shoot Bo, Clint exclaimed. He thought that Bo should just put it out of his mind and talk to Clint if he needed to. Clint left, but he lingered behind until Nora returned to the room. He watched the couple through the small window next to the door. Nora was ready to resume their conversation, and she asked Bo what he'd wanted to tell her earlier. It had \"sounded bad,\" she pronounced.\n\n\nBo took a deep breath and acknowledged that he'd been upset about the text messages, way more than he'd let on. He should have known they were fakes. Nora assured him that she'd never give up on their marriage, and she knew that he'd never sleep with Inez. \"Are we good?\" she asked her husband. \"We're great,\" he replied. They shared a kiss, while out in the hallway, Clint sneered. \"Keep lying to her, little brother. It's going to make it so much worse when she finally finds out.\"\n\n\nCharlie and Echo returned to Llanfair after their visit with Rex at the hospital. Echo appreciated that Charlie had challenged Echo on her drinking problem and his offer to help. As Viki descended the stairs, carrying a huge box of Christmas ornaments, she watched as Echo gave Charlie a big hug. Charlie spied his wife and quickly enlightened her about Rex's car accident and the hospital visit. He assured her that Rex would be fine. \"Why didn't you call me?\" Viki asked. Charlie explained that he'd asked Echo to tell Viki when he'd called to inform Echo of their son's accident.\n\n\nEcho tried to escape upstairs, but Viki stopped her. She was fuming, and she accused Echo of adding lying to her list of blunders. Viki had been standing there when Echo had received the call from Charlie about Rex's accident, but Echo hadn't said anything. Echo began to make excuses and claimed that she'd been unable to think at the time. Viki disagreed. Echo had made it sound like Charlie had been waiting for Echo to show up at a motel. \"Charlie needs me,\" Viki said dramatically, reminding Echo of what Echo had said.\n\n\nCharlie spoke up and maintained that it had all been his fault. There had been a miscommunication, he suggested. Viki noted that Echo had been drinking her breakfast, and it hadn't been orange juice. She had a child in the house and more on the way, and she was furious with Echo's behavior. Echo announced that Charlie knew about Echo's drinking problem. Charlie revealed that he planned on helping Echo get sober. Viki was extremely unhappy to hear the news. Echo explained that Charlie had caught her drinking at the hospital, and he'd made her see her problem.\n\n\nViki assumed that Echo would check into rehab, but Echo replied that she couldn't afford it. She also wanted to remain near her family. Viki gritted her teeth and noted that Echo didn't want to leave Chuckles. Echo just agreed that she should probably stop calling Charlie by the name of Chuckles, since that was the name they'd used when they were drinking. Viki demanded to speak to Charlie in private after she heard him say that he would be taking Echo to one of his Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\n\n\"She has a problem,\" Charlie said to his wife. Viki argued that Echo had many problems, including the fact that she wanted Charlie. While Charlie asserted that Echo wanted him when she was drunk, Viki was adamant that Echo would go after Charlie when she was sober, and she thought that Echo was manipulating him. Charlie agreed that was true, but that was what drunks did, along with lying and denying. He had to help Echo, he vowed, because that was what members of AA did. He would get Echo started and find her a sponsor. He'd keep an eye on her.\n\n\nViki was visibly upset, as Charlie continued that he wanted Echo to be a good mother and grandmother. \"I'm losing you,\" Viki uttered. Echo was in their home and their lives, and Charlie was about to take her to his own program when there were many others around. \"Trust me,\" Charlie told her.\n\n\nLangston helped Ford to remove his shirt after they returned to his place after his stay at the hospital, though he confessed that he didn't own any pajamas. Langston reminded him that she intended to wait until spring before she saw him without any clothing. He wondered if she trusted him yet, but before they could continue their discussion, Starr and James walked in. James admitted that he'd spoken to the cops about Eddie's murder.\n\n\nFord knew that James didn't have anything to do with the murder. \"How do you know?\" James asked his brother. \"You're not a killer, James,\" Ford replied. James confessed that he'd taken Eddie's gun, gone to Eddie's motel room, and pulled the gun on his father. Eddie had laughed, so James had shot the gun at the wall. He was happy to see that Eddie was finally scared, but James couldn't pull the trigger, because James would have lost his freedom and his life as he knew it. James had left the gun in the motel room when he'd left.\n\n\nJames was aware that Ford had always wanted to protect him, and he recalled that earlier, Ford had vowed that Eddie would never get near James again. Ford assured his brother that he had been in the emergency room all night. Langston looked at Ford strangely, but she didn't say anything. James agreed that they weren't the only people who wanted Eddie dead. After James and Starr left, Langston accused Ford of not being in the emergency room all night. She asked why he'd lied.\n\n\nShe had gone to his apartment to retrieve some of his things, and when she'd returned, Ford hadn't been in his room. Ford claimed he'd been out for tests, but Langston revealed that the nurses had no idea where Ford had gone. \"Did you kill your father?\" she asked. Langston made him aware that there would have to be a record of the tests, and the cops would be checking up. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door.\n\n\nIt was John, and he had some questions for Ford. He wanted to know where Ford had been between midnight and 6:00 a.m. Ford reminded John that Eddie had beaten him up, and Ford had been at the hospital all night. John wondered if there had been any witnesses, because the doctors and nurses were busy and might not recall Ford. Langston spoke up. She announced that she could vouch for Ford, as she'd been with him all night. She had taken him to the hospital, had waited, and then had taken Ford home.\n\n\nJohn advised Ford that he would check Ford's story with the hospital. He wondered if there were anything to add. Ford noted that his father was a \"nasty son of a bitch\" who had lots of enemies. After John was gone, Ford turned to Langston. \"Why did you lie for me?\" he asked her. She knew that he'd do anything to protect James, and she was ready to protect Ford, Langston explained. \"Did you kill your father?\" she asked him again.\n\n\nAs Inez and Nate talked, there was a knock at the door. It was Starr and James. They wanted to check to make sure that things were okay. Inez agreed that she wouldn't miss Eddie, and she was aware that no one else would either. The murder was still a shock, she confessed. Nate asked James if he'd heard of any leads, but there were none to divulge. James and Starr left. \"It wasn't James,\" Nate said to his mother. \"I know,\" she replied.\n\n\nNatalie turned up at Marty's house and ordered Todd to leave. She had to speak to Marty alone. \"I was here first,\" Todd complained. \"Get the hell out, Todd,\" Marty spoke up. She threatened to obtain a restraining order against him, and she suggested that he get a lawyer. Todd leaned over to whisper to Natalie. He remarked that Marty was over the edge, and he had no doubts that she'd resemble a homeless person in Angel Square soon. \"Now what do you want?\" Marty asked Natalie after Todd had gone.\n\n\nNatalie confided that she and John planned on getting married. Marty was surprised, but she asked why Natalie was there. Marty knew why, Natalie reminded the doctor. She and John were happy, and she didn't want Marty to talk to John and reveal that Natalie's baby wasn't his.\n\n\nInez placed a call to Clint. She advised him that James had been cleared of any wrongdoing, and she wondered what son of hers had been seen at the motel. She asked if it was Bobby, but Clint suggested that maybe it was Nate.\n\n\nJohn welcomed a stranger into his office. The man had been at the motel the night of the murder, but he didn't want his wife to be aware of it. He'd seen someone leaving Eddie's room, and he was ready to view the photographs on John's computer. He pointed to the photo as soon as he saw it and announced that it was the person he'd seen.\n\n\nLangston waited for Ford's answer, but Starr and James returned, and the conversation ended. James indicated that they'd gone to visit Nate and Inez, and he thought that they were behaving oddly. Starr thought they might have been hiding something about the murder.\n\n\nJohn showed up at Inez's place and announced he had questions. \"Shoot,\" Nate advised him. \"I mean sure,\" he added quickly. John asked what Nate had been doing at his father's murder scene.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "There's a police investigation underway for the murder of Eddie Ford. John doubts it could be James since his story checked out and he wasn't afraid to talk about what happened. But he does suspect Robert. Robert casts suspicion upon himself by admitting to James that he \"knows\" that James could not have done it. And he lies to James that he (himself) was in the hospital all night. Langston confirms that she knows that he snuck out and came back and did not tell anybody where he went.. But she lies for Robert when John questions him and asks if there are any witnesses who can confirm that he could not have been at the scene of the crime. Clint goes to see Nora and Bo when she's in the hospital and convinces Nora that he bets that Inez put Eddie up to kidnapping her and attempt to break up her marriage with Bo. Nobody suspects Clint when he tells them he knows that nobody could ever break up Bo and Nora's marriage and that he would never sleep with Inez. Privately, Bo confesses to Nora that he did sleep with Inez although he did not remember it. But Clint convinces his brother not to tell her, sounding like he want to help them both and keep them together. But he still has a vindictive trick up his sleeve. There is suspicion that Inez, Nate or Robert could have killed Eddie. Echo is \"working\" on Charlie when he convinces her that she has a drinking problem, needs to get sober and needs him to take her to AA meetings. Viki is furious and afraid that she will lose her husband.",
