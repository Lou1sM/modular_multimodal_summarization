Lindsay reminded him that he doesn't have the same control over his hand that he used to, but encouraged him not to quit. Cris wasn't sure how he's going to make a living. After, Cris encountered a young man walking around outside in the cold without a coat. He got the kid a coat then made a plan to help the less fortunate.\n\n\nNora and Evangeline dined out together at Capricorn. Vangie told her that she wants to do something special for Cris. Nora suggested she ask Cristian to marry her, but Evangeline didn't think it was the right time for that.... Vangie, Lindsay, Michael and Marcie later joined him in the Square to help Cris with his project ... which turned out to be them entertaining the crowd by singing holiday songs. Cris and Michael proudly looked on as Marcie and Evangeline performed a popular tune. Portrayers Renee Goldsberry (Evangeline) and Kathy Brier (Marcie) were obviously having a good time with this as they laughed and joked around.\n\n\nClaudia ran into Nash at the bar. Jessica, who'd been Christmas shopping, then spied them together and stopped by to say hello. She bristled when Claudia made a crack about Bree having \"two mommies and two daddies.\" After Jess left, Claudia admitted to Nash that she's jealous of Bree having people to love her and is feeling lonely during the holiday season since her dad died. Nash apologized to Jessica. Jess noted that she's eventually going to have to tell Bree the truth about herself. Claudia rolled her eyes when she saw the exes bond over baby pictures.\n\n\nVincent continued to rail against the police for not doing anything about the warehouse fire. Antonio dismissed him by explaining that it's Christmas and they're short-staffed, but Vince vowed to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\nBo and Clint paid Spencer a visit at the hospital. Clint told him that he's glad Truman isn't a Buchanan, while Bo warned him that he's \"through\".... Todd paced in the waiting room, hoping to hear something about Blair's condition. He called the board of directors and screamed at them for not giving him information. Marty overheard and chided him for being out of control. Todd explained that Blair just got out of surgery. He admitted that he'd been held by the cops over his encounter with Spencer, and blamed Marty for setting the whole incident into motion. He then called Cole a drug addict. He soon calmed down and said that with Spencer not having to stand trial, he now understands how Marty must've felt when he was pardoned for the rape. Paige then emerged and gave him the sad news that while Blair was in stable condition, she lost the baby. Todd was understandably devastated. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Jessica sees Claudia and Nash talking and goes over to see Nash. Jessica explains to Nash why she has more gifts. She went shopping to get Bree more things. She looked under the tree and didn't feel that there were enough presents there. \"Well, why shouldn't she get twice as many presents? I mean, she has two daddies and two mommies right?\" Nash and Jessica stare at Claudia silently, surprised by what she's said. \"What?\" Claudia asks. \"Did I say something wrong?\" Nash joins Jessica at a table in the restaurant and they talk about Bree. She gives him a copy of some photos of the child and she arranges to drop Bree off the next day for his visit with her. She and Antonio will be celebrating that night for Christmas and Jessica invites Nash to come but he is getting used to being alone and begs off. Spencer is back to his old self now that he has had his anesthetic wear off. He lays chained to a bed and hooked up to tubes. Clint and Bo come to see the crazy bastard and they tell him that it is finally over. He will never be free again. He can't hurt anyone anymore. That is the message that they have for Spencer from their father. Spencer doesn't care what Asa says. He will get out of the hospital and he will get out of prison and he will have his revenge. Bo warns Spencer that he had better not hurt anyone ever again. Bo vows to stop him himself. Vincent pushes Antonio and Officer Sahid to find out about his fire, and so the report from the fire department is sent over and the fire is found to have been deliberately set. Now Antonio can look into this. Vincent still thinks that his case will not get attention that it deserves. When asked for a list of enemies, Vincent calls out Antonio and Cristian's name to Officer Sahid who will be taking Vincent's statement. Todd is at the hospital with Marty in a private room at the hospital. He has been denied access to Blair and that angers him. Marty tells him that nothing sinister is going on. It is just the rules of the hospital. She assures him that he will be able to see her the next day or so. He tells Marty that she really screwed things up by telling everyone that Spencer was insane. She wonders if he has ever really taken responsibility for anything in his entire live. While they are talking, Paige comes to the room. She tells that Blair has made it through but the baby is gone. The placenta got dislodged due to the fall and the baby just didn't make it. It was a boy and he was 4 months old. Todd is sad at first but then he shakes it off. He didn't plan his kids. He realizes sadly that he has one kid lost or dead and one dead for sure.",
