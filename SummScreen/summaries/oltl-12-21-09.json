    "soap_central": "\nCabin Fever\n\n\nNoelle accompanied a confused Gigi to Viki's cabin at Llantano Mountain.  When Gigi maintained that she needed time alone to decide what she really wanted, Noelle chimed, \"You mean who you want, Rex or Schuyler!\"   Admitting that she had unresolved issues about Rex abandoning her when she was pregnant,  Gigi also revealed that she had been unable to accept the fact that Rex had slept with her sister.  Confiding that she was attracted to Schuyler, Gigi was certain that Schuyler would never betray her.   Before leaving Gigi alone at the cabin, Noelle insisted that Gigi knew deep down in her heart which man she really wanted.\n\n\nAt Rex's loft, Stacy left Schuyler a voicemail.  Stacy advised Schuyler that it would be in his best interest to follow Gigi to the cabin and romance her.  Later, an elated Kim returned home and gave Stacy a detailed account of her encounter with Clint.  Kim was convinced that the revelation that Nora was having an affair with Bo would cause Clint to file for an immediate divorce.   Meanwhile, Stacy hoped that Schuyler would pay Gigi a visit at the cabin, and that Rex would seek comfort from Stacy.\n\n\nKim was horrified when she discovered the blood sample that Stacy had carefully hidden inside the refrigerator.  Reminding Kim that she had retrieved the blood specimen from an unconscious Mitch Laurence, Stacy believed that the sample might prove valuable if  Rex demanded a blood test to determine the paternity of Stacy's baby.  However, Stacy hadn't decided how she would make the switch.\n\n\nSwearing Kim to secrecy, Stacy presented Kim with the extensive research that she had gathered about Mitch.  Stacy related that she might need Mitch's help in securing a permanent place in Rex's life.  Rubbing her stomach, Stacy declared, \"Rex is really a Laurence, I guess it's time you met your grandpa!\"\n\n\nAt the Angel Square Hotel, Schuyler encountered Rex, who was searching for Roxy.  Unable to locate his mother, an angry Rex lashed out at  Schuyler and blamed him for causing Gigi to question her true feelings.  While Schuyler chastised Rex for cheating on Gigi with Stacy, Rex maintained that Schuyler's constant interference had left Gigi in a state of confusion.  Rex was adamant that Gigi would realize that they were meant to be together, and she would return home to him and Shane.  Schuyler questioned whether Gigi would choose to remain with Rex.\n\n\nMeanwhile, upstairs, Roxy spotted Kyle and an injured Nick entering Kyle's apartment.  When Roxy witnessed Oliver carrying Nick's suitcase, Roxy pulled Kyle to the side and demanded to know what was going on.  Relating that Nick was still physically weak, Kyle told Roxy that  he had offered Nick a place to stay while he recuperated.   Roxy stated that Nick would cause problems between Kyle and Oliver, but Kyle maintained that he and Nick were friends.  Certain that Nick had an ulterior motive, Roxy warned Kyle to rid himself of Nick as soon as possible, or risk losing the love of his life.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Nick tried his best to remind Oliver that Nick and Kyle had been romantically involved.  Oliver appeared bothered by Nick's comments.  When Kyle returned, Oliver pointed out that there was one bed in Kyle's apartment and questioned where Nick would sleep.  Nick offered to leave, but Kyle assured Oliver that suitable sleeping arrangements would be made.  Noticing that Oliver was slightly irritated, Kyle asked him to step out in the hall so they could talk privately.\n\n\nOut in the hall, Oliver reminded Kyle that they had missed out on the opportunity to make love, and he worried that Nick's presence would make the wait even longer.   Kyle promised Oliver that they would find a way to be together.  As the two men shared a passionate kiss, a jealous Nick spied on them.\n\n\nRoxy intervened when she discovered Rex and Schuyler arguing downstairs.  Upon learning that Gigi had left town, Roxy blamed Schuyler for interfering in Rex and Gigi's relationship, and evicted him from the hotel.  Stating that she would send Schuyler his belongings, Roxy ordered Schuyler to leave.  Once Schuyler had left, Rex explained that he had asked Gigi to leave because she needed time to sort out her feelings.  Roxy was convinced that Gigi would realize that she and Rex were meant to be together.  When Rex contemplated contacting Gigi, Roxy suggested that he give her time to work things out.\n\n\nGigi was surprised when Schuyler arrived at the cabin.  Initially, Gigi told Schuyler that she wanted to be alone, but after a brief hesitation, she suggested that they finally discuss their feelings for each other. Schuyler gave her a detailed account of his confrontation with Rex,  and wondered if Gigi would reunite with Rex.  Admitting that she was conflicted about her feelings for Rex and Schuyler, Gigi informed him that Rex had suggested that they separate.  Suddenly, their eyes locked, and Gigi and Schuyler kissed.\n\n\nBack at the Angel Square Hotel, while Kyle and Oliver shared a tender moment in the hall, Roxy phoned Kyle.  Spotting Kyle's phone inside the room, Nick answered the call.  Assuming Nick was Kyle, Roxy stated that a room had become available and suggested that Kyle kick Nick out of his room.  Roxy hung up before Nick could respond.  When Kyle returned, Nick informed his friend that Roxy had phoned but failed to tell him the real reason for her call.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Clint held Nora and Bo at gunpoint, and berated them for their betrayal.   In tears, Nora told Clint that she loved him and that she never cheated on him.  Referring to her as a lying whore, Clint withdrew his weapon and reminded Bo of Nora's affair with Sam.  Clint stated that they would both get what they deserved.  As Bo and Nora attempted to leave, Clint asked for a moment alone with Bo.    Watching Nora exit the house, Clint told her that she had destroyed their family.\n\n\nAlone with Clint, Bo tried to apologize to his brother, but Clint responded by punching him in the face.  Recalling the past conversation in which he had admitted that Clint's relationship with Nora made him uncomfortable, Bo chastised Clint for pursuing his ex-wife.  Recalling how Asa had married several of Bo's past lovers, Bo insisted that Clint had inherited Asa's old habits.  As Bo headed toward the door, Clint declared, You're dead to me, I no longer have a brother!'\n\n\nNora waited for Bo outside of the mansion.  Nora expressed concern over Clint's state of mind, but Bo told her that the family had faced trials far worse.\n\n\nStaring at Asa's picture, Clint stated, \"It wasn't loaded, Pa!\"  Moments later, Clint received a call from Kim.  When Clint expressed his desire to leave the mansion, Kim suggested that he pay her a visit at the loft.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Mitch threatened to harm the Cramer women unless Dorian fired Bo as police commissioner.  Informing Mitch that she had no basis to fire Bo, Dorian related that she also had no one to replace him.  With a sly grin, Mitch insisted that he had someone special in mind.  When Dorian refused to accommodate Mitch, he warned her that she would be sorry if she failed to cooperate.  Exiting Mitch's room, Dorian instructed the guard outside his room to watch Mitch closely.\n\n\nLater, Stacy arrived inside Mitch's room and attempted to introduce herself.  Mitch interrupted her and exclaimed, \"I know who you are.  I've been expecting you!\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Clint confronts Bo and Nora about what he's discovered they have done behind his back and tells them both he never wants to see them again. Kim believes she has Clint right where she wants him. Stacy is delighted that Gigi has moved out of her place with Rex. Roxy kicks Schuyler out of Angel Square. He goes to see Gigi and kisses her. And we know what is bound to happen next. Mitch tells Dorian he needs her to fire Bo and he knows the perfect candidate for police commissioner of Llanview although he doesn't tell her who. She doesn't listen nor want to \"join forces\" with him. Stacy goes to see Mitch and he admits he knows who she is.",
