Dorian pleaded with Cris to talk to Adriana for him, but he was uncomfortable doing it. Carlotta invited Dorian to spend the holiday with them, but she turned her down. \n\n\nNash told baby Bree how he put together a special present for Jessica. Meanwhile, at Llanfair, Asa, Renee, Viki, Clint, Jessica and Antonio exchanged gifts. Viki was especially touched by Clint's present. Asa looked forward to having some bourbon. Roxy then arrived, wearing a Santa hat. Jessica then got a surprise gift from Nash: a locket. Jessica returned it to Nash and told him she can't accept it. He told her to open it and there was a picture of Bree inside. Antonio came by and made a toast. Viki and Clint smooched under the mistletoe. \n\n\nAt the hospital, Natalie, Marcie, Michael and Tommy gave John a Christmas party in his room. Marcie put her foot in her mouth when she asked to see the engagement ring that John had given Natalie...when he hadn't actually done so. Nat covered nicely by stating that her present was seeing John get well. The brothers wished their mom could be with them, but she was on another cruise. Michael admitted that he'd been one of the doctors to save Spencer's life. John understood that his brother was just doing his job. Michael confessed that he'd been tempted to \"slip up.\" John said he's planning to \"put an end\" to Spencer by going back to work and doing what he can to put Truman back in prison. Marcie worried that if Spencer gets the death penalty, Todd will never learn where his son is. \n\n\nNatalie joined her family at Llanfair. She then returned to the hospital and stopped by to see Spencer. He wondered if Nat was planning to kill him. She wasn't; she just wanted to taunt him a little. She and John then exchanged gifts. He gave her a date book with \"dinner at the Palace\" marked off. He hinted that would be when he proposes. \n\n\nCristian and Vangie celebrated in private. Evangeline began to panic when she thought he was going to propose. He then teased her by asking what she'd do if he did ask her to marry him. She gave him a thoughtful gift meant to appeal to the artist in him. He was very touched. \n\n\nViki urged Adriana to give Dorian a break on the holiday. Adriana took her advice and returned to Dorian's, where she and her mom embraced. \n\n\nAlso at the hospital, Paige paid Spencer a visit and told him she enjoys seeing him \"chained to the bed, helpless.\" Bo joined in and said that a lot of people want to see Truman dead. After they left, Spencer told himself that he's going to get out of his current situation. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Spencer didn't realize that Paige had gotten her license back and could practice medicine again. He still feels that she shouldn't be working on him. She doesn't think it makes a difference since everyone wants to kill him anyway. Bo has posted a guard at the door just in case anyone wants to kill him. Michael and Marcie come to see John and are surprised to see that Natalie isn't wearing the engagement ring. Michael sits with John who tells Natalie she should go and be with her family. She tells that she and Michael has a surprise. John is going to be transferred to Llanview hospital where Michael can look after him and John can be closer to home. Natalie does go to see her family and is surprised to see Roxy there. \"You were the one who invited me,\" Roxy says. Natalie forgot. Roxy knows that all that the girl has John on the brain and not much else. Natalie says his to a few people at the Christmas celebration at her house and then she is gone again. She goes to the Llanview hospital to see Spencer. At first the cop doesn't want to let her in the room but then he knows her uncle so he lets her through. Spencer immediately wants to know what she is doing there. \"Oh I just came to give John his Christmas present,\" she says grinning. Natalie tells that she has just there to see that he is as bad off as she thought. She can't wait to tell John that. Jessica finds an extra gift under the tree with her name on it. Viki watches as she opens it. It is a gold locket with a heart at the bottom. Jessica isn't as thrilled as Viki would expect and so she guesses correctly that the gift was from Nash and not Antonio. Jessica finds it to be too personal and heads out to Nash's vineyard where he is visiting with Bree. She tells him that she can't accept it, she says to him. She doesn't know what it means. He can see that she hasn't even opened it yet. she opens the heart and finds a picture of Bree inside. She gets it now and they laugh. Antonio arrives unexpectedly and is happy to find the two. John and Natalie exchange gifts. She gets him a jewelry piece it is the patron saint of lovers. Her gift will be dinner at the palace as soon as he can make it there. \"It won't be any old dinner either. I wish that I could kiss you now. I love you Natalie,\" he tells her. \"I love you John. \"Talia relieves the cop watching Spencer's door. She looks in the man's room and sees that he is asleep. She closes the door and goes back to her post. He isn't really sleeping and he Spencer talks to himself. \"Don't worry Spencer, Christmas will just be coming a little late this year Ain't that right Santa?\"",
