    "soap_central": "\n Rocking' Around the Crisis Train \n\n\nAs Natalie answered the door at Llanfair, she was surprised to see Jared. \"Hi Sparky,\" he said. Moments later, she refocused and saw Rex standing there, offering to spend time with her to comfort her as the holiday approached. Natalie cried as she recalled the same time the year before, when she and Jared were exhausted from caring for Chloe and Bree. She wished she was pregnant so that she could hold onto Jared, she confided to her brother, but there was no way she could be. Rex reminded her of her huge family who loved her.\n\n\nNatalie urged Rex to return home to spend time with Gigi, but he confessed that Gigi was not there. A worried Natalie asked if Gigi had left him. She felt responsible for consuming Rex's time when he helped her out when Jared was missing. Rex admitted that Gigi's taking off had been his idea and that he had suggested she take a \"breather\" because of her feelings about Schuyler. \"Have you lost your mind?\" Natalie asked her brother. She thought that Schuyler was just a crush and urged her brother to rush up to the cabin to see Gigi.\n\n\nTurning, Natalie spotted Jared again and assured her brother that she wanted to be alone with her memories.\n\n\nStacy arrived to visit Mitch at the hospital, and Mitch informed her that he had been waiting for her, though he assumed that she was terrified of him. He was counting on Stacy to be his ally and he offered to make a deal with her. He promised to make sure that Stacy and Rex would spend the rest of their lives together if he got what he wanted, he purred. He confessed to being familiar with all of Stacy's moves, as he had been watching her.\n\n\nHe made reference to Stacy's endeavor of obtaining additional blood from him, and Stacy recalled the nurse who had visited her and left behind the extra blood from Mitch for future need. Mitch laughed when Stacy advised him that he was creepy. He stated that Jessica had shown disloyalty to him and he had no interest in Rex or Stacy, but Rex's child would be a gift for him. He wanted to take Stacy's baby, his own flesh and blood, to his compound so that he could nurture and mold it from birth. In that way, his work would be continued, Mitch clarified.\n\n\nStacy asked about Shane, but Mitch assured her that his grandson was too old and had already been poisoned against him. He would make sure that Stacy shared her life with Rex. Stacy was confused, pointing out that Rex hated Mitch more than he hated her. She would have no hold on Rex if there were no baby, she pointed out. She asked where Mitch's guarantee was.\n\n\nOut in the hallway, Oliver wondered why Mitch's room was left unguarded and he berated the assigned cop for leaving his post. The officer admitted that he had walked the mayor to the elevator and assured Oliver that no one else was in the room besides Mitch. Oliver thought they couldn't be too sure. He ran into Mitch's room, and Stacy covered quickly, ordering Mitch to stay away from her and her baby. Oliver was confused as he ushered Stacy out of the room.\n\n\nOliver wanted to know if Mitch had threatened Stacy and he warned her to be careful. He was concerned because of her condition and didn't think she needed to be stressed in any way. He admitted to feeling connected to her because of the night they spent together and the fact that his life had turned around after that. He thought that if things had been different, it could have been his baby that she was carrying. Looking uncomfortable, Stacy rushed off.\n\n\nAs Schuyler and Gigi shared a kiss at Viki's cabin, Schuyler apologized for distracting Gigi from her mission to figure out what it was she needed and wanted. He admitted that he wanted to be with her very badly, but she was with Rex. He wouldn't help her to cheat on Rex. Gigi professed to still being confused.\n\n\nChanging the subject quickly, Schuyler grabbed an ax and suggested that they cut down a potential Christmas tree to decorate. They headed outdoors but returned shortly after. Schuyler admitted that he couldn't cut down a living tree, and the couple joked about his love for all things \"flora and fauna.\" Gigi was surprised that Schuyler could not hurt any animal or living thing and was determined to learn more secrets about him. Schuyler admitted that there were \"a few whoppers.\"\n\n\nGigi thought it was a good idea to play \"Truth or Dare,\" but Schuyler was unwilling. He thought that Gigi would run screaming to Rex if she heard any of his secrets. She responded that she already knew that he had loved Stacy previously, so she didn't feel that anything else would be as bad. Changing the subject again, Schuyler pointed across the room, sighting the perfect tree.\n\n\nClint, speaking to Kim on the telephone, declined her invitation to \"hang out\" at her place to forget about Nora and Bo. Nigel extended an offer to help out in some way, but Clint assured him that there was \"nothing to be done.\" Renee descended the stairs as Clint headed out the door. She was disappointed to learn from Nigel that Nora and Matthew wouldn't be around. She spied the shotgun and immediately figured out that Bo and Nora were back together. She couldn't believe the couple had cheated on Clint and she was adamant that Clint shouldn't be alone.\n\n\nNigel broke the news that Clint was more than likely with Kim, his new assistant, who had maneuvered her way into the Buchanans' lives. She was the one responsible for the news of Bo and Nora leaking out, Nigel assumed. Renee voiced her desire to slap the woman, declaring that she was quite familiar with the kind of woman Kim was. They wondered what they could do about the \"slut.\" Renee stated that \"love is a runaway train that waited for no one and nothing.\" She recalled that Asa always wanted Bo and Nora to be back together, but not at Clint's expense.\n\n\nChanging his mind, Clint arrived at Kim's place and related the events of the evening after Kim left his house. They shared a bottle of liquor as Clint confessed  that after confronting Nora and Bo, he wanted to \"blow their heads off.\" He agreed with his brother's assessment that he never should have married Nora. According to Kim, Nora was the one who had lost.\n\n\nHaving consumed a great quantity of the bottle, Clint admitted that he had Kim checked out and knew that her resume had been fictional. He knew that she had been a stripper in Las Vegas. At Kim's questioning, he divulged that he hadn't fired her because he thought that she might be useful. He enjoyed the time she had been in bed with him. He wanted to know if she had really interviewed with Jared and if Jared had really hired her.\n\n\nKim admitted that she had never seen nor spoken to Jared. Clint realized that Natalie had seen right through Kim when they first met, even in the midst of her misery. He wondered what else Kim had done and realized that the notation in Jared's calendar as well as the note left on his desk were both fakes. \"Why?\" he asked Kim, perplexed. \"To meet you,\" Kim replied. Just then, Stacy burst in, but seeing Clint and Kim, turned to head back out. Clint stopped her and announced that he was leaving.\n\n\nHe thanked Kim for all she had done and surprised her by acknowledging that he expected to see her back at the office. She expressed her sorrow again for what had happened with Bo and Nora but seemed less than ebullient that Clint wanted her to remain as his employee. Once Clint was gone, Stacy told her roommate that Mitch had promised her Rex.\n\n\nBo and Nora checked in at the Palace Hotel and discussed the events of the evening in Bo's room. They continued to pour drinks and down them quickly as they wondered how Clint could have already known about the two of them. Nora relived her experience of finding Kim in bed with Clint. She couldn't get over the hurt and anger that she saw in Clint's eyes. Nora admitted that she was scared to death when facing the shotgun that Clint had pointed at her and Bo. She knew that he had really wanted to shoot them when she looked into his eyes.\n\n\nShe had driven Clint to do what he did, Nora continued. She was in agreement with Clint that she had ruined the family. She wondered how they would all get past the hurt, though she and Bo saw eye to eye about not fighting their love for each other. Bo stated that he didn't regret falling in love with Nora.\n\n\nDespondently, Nora noted that she needed to find somewhere to live. She headed to the door, thinking it was best for her to stay in her own room. She needed to check on Danielle and Matthew, and advise T\u00e9a that Danielle was with her in the same hotel and not at the house. She wondered when things would get better.\n\n\nClint returned home and received an invitation from Renee to play a couple of hands of gin rummy. She announced that Nigel had silver to polish. The butler looked at her, puzzled, but Clint determined that Nigel and Renee could play. He advised the butler that he was getting the night off. Clint went upstairs.\n\n\nKim summarized her evening with Clint to Stacy and noted that he had quite a lot to drink. He had confessed to knowing all about her. She and Stacy wondered what the \"catch\" was with both Clint and Mitch. Kim warned her girlfriend not to trust Mitch.\n\n\nA cheerful Mitch whistled as Oliver entered his room to check on him. He advised the police officer that he was being rewarded by God for all of his trouble. Mitch rejoiced that he would never die and would live on. He was sorry that Oliver would never delight in any offspring and know the joy of having any children like he would, he prodded the cop.\n\n\nAs Schuyler and Gigi decorated their \"tree,\" which consisted of the coat rack with hangers as branches, a broken-hearted Rex arrived and looked into the window. Turning and gasping, Gigi ran to the window. She was excited to see that it was snowing.\n\n\nNatalie took a pregnancy test as Jared \"watched\" and asked for the results. He thought it was possible that the test would be positive, thinking that possibly they had \"slipped.\" Natalie looked at the test and sighed. \"Nope, we didn't slip.\" He assured her that she would always have her memories. She envisioned laying in his arms, then jumped up and looked outside. He blew a kiss goodbye to her.\n\n\n",
