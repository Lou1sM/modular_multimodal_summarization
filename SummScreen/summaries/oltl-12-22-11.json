    "tvdb": "Cutter makes a confession; Jack invites Todd to Christmas Eve with his family. ",
    "tvmega_recap": "Shane has pressured Neela to reveal to him that she has \"gotten the goods\" on Jack by telling her that his mom is dead because of Jack. She is very reluctant to give Jack up however since she seems to like him and he seems to be developing a conscience by confiding in her and admitting to her how remorseful he is for what happened to Gigi. But she gives him the tape recording of Jack confessing everything. Jack then surprises Todd by inviting him to spend Christmas at Blair's home where Blair, Starr, and even Jack welcome him. Tea, however, is hiding her rage over believing that Todd killed her husband and set her brother up and only shares with John what she knows. In Paris, TX, the professor (who looks just like Delphina) knows that both Rex and Gigi/Stacy need to know something about the night when Gigi \"allegedly\" died. So they find a television screen that reveals the night in question."
