    "soap_central": "\nStarr Witness\n\n\nThe courtroom was sent into an uproar when Starr made her accusation against Todd. T\u00e9a dismissed Starr's claims, saying that she was either lying or coached, but Nora pushed for the judge to hear her out. Starr insisted she was telling the truth, and that Todd had confessed his plans to her when she visited him in the hospital. \n\n\nAs Nora and T\u00e9a argued the matter at the judge's bench, Blair took Starr aside and asked why she hadn't revealed her visit to Todd. Blair pleaded with her not to take that kind of burden onto herself alone, and said that as Starr's mother, she needed to know the scope of Todd's misdeeds and how they affected his children. Blair said Starr didn't have to testify, but Starr was adamant: \"I have to testify,\" she said, glaring at Todd. \"So he pays.\" When Cole took a turn talking to Starr, Blair retreated to the gallery with John, where she worried about Starr's shaky condition, and raged against T\u00e9a. John told Blair he could understand why Starr wanted to speak up and make her father face justice. \n\n\nCole also prevailed upon Starr not to put herself through the strain of testifying, but Starr would not be swayed. She told him she wasn't doing it for him, or Marty, or even herself, but for Hope. Cole told her that he regretted his angry words before, and admitted that he could never bring himself to kill Todd; he told Starr he understood her complicated emotions regarding her father, and he knew she loved Todd. \"He doesn't love me,\" Starr replied. \"He just wants what he wants.\" Cole told Starr not to feel guilty if her testimony put Todd away. Starr told Cole that Todd was putting himself there, because of what he'd done. \n\n\nDespite T\u00e9a's stream of objections, the judge agreed to put Starr on the stand. Nora questioned Starr, who retold the story of her visit to Todd in the hospital, and how he'd confessed his plan to steal Hope and raise her with Marty. Starr told the court she couldn't believe that Todd would do such a thing to her, and that, as his daughter, she used to feel she was immune from his violence. \"You are my daughter,\" Todd interrupted, rising to his feet. \"Say it.\" As the judge ordered Todd to sit down, Starr coldly corrected him: \"I am not...Todd. Not anymore.\" \n\n\nInstead of cross-examining Starr, T\u00e9a asked the judge to dismiss Starr's entire testimony, labeling it hearsay from an angry \"adolescent\" trying to hijack the courtroom. Starr snapped that she was telling the truth, and T\u00e9a asked for corroboration. Todd warned T\u00e9a to leave Starr alone, grabbing her arm. Nora told the judge that Starr's testimony about Todd's plans came under the exception to the hearsay rule, and that it was backed up by Marty's own statement to the police; she also noted that Todd had conveniently been at Llanview Hospital on the night of Hope's birth. As Starr stepped down from the stand, Nora argued that the facts were enough to hold Todd on attempted kidnapping, and said she could find the necessary evidence and make a full case at trial. T\u00e9a said the case was slipshod at best, since the child in question \"no longer exists.\" \"Oh, sensitively put, Counselor,\" Nora sighed. The judge urged Nora to find the full evidence to support her case, and agreed to allow the charge of attempted kidnapping to go to trial. Nora asked for Todd to be held without bail, but after some wrangling, T\u00e9a was allowed to post Todd's bail herself, and the hearing was adjourned. \"You're welcome,\" T\u00e9a snarled at Todd as she left to pay his bail. \"Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.\" Todd, meanwhile, remained fixated on Marty. \n\n\nIn the gallery, Marty beat herself up about the outcome of the hearing, furious about how T\u00e9a twisted the facts. Nora begged her not to blame herself, and stayed optimistic, saying that because Marty and Starr stood up for themselves, Todd would be going to trial, after all. Marty took Cole aside and apologized to him again for her erratic behavior, but Cole, distant, shrugged her off. As T\u00e9a took Todd home, Starr and Cole puzzled over the case, wondering how Todd planned to pull off Hope's abduction without any help. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Jared paid a visit to Clint, and told him he needed something from him: His blessing for Natalie's hand in marriage. Clint was pleased to hear that Jared planned to propose to Natalie on Christmas morning, and was surprised Jared had made the gesture to him given their rocky history. Jared said that Clint's approval was important to Natalie, and that he never wanted her to have to choose between them. Clint said he didn't want that either, and was eternally grateful to Jared for helping Natalie through the ordeal with Tess. Jared told Clint he'd die for Natalie, and Clint happily agreed to give Jared his blessing. He just had one question: \"How are you going to support my daughter?\" Jared told Clint he'd planned to go back to work on the business end of Charlie's contracting firm, but Clint had a better idea, and asked Jared to come back to work at Buchanan Enterprises. Jared was shocked and delighted by the offer, and quickly agreed. As Jared hurried home to Llanfair, Clint congratulated Jared on his plan to pop the question. \n\n\nAs Jared left, Matthew stepped into the foyer, having misheard the conversation. He approached Clint in the drawing room and asked him when he was going to propose to his mother. Flustered, Clint told him he'd misunderstood, and that Jared was proposing to Natalie. Matthew asked if he and Nora would ever be married, and Clint asked Matthew if he'd be ready for such a change. \"Compared to my last stepfather, you're cake!\" Matthew replied enthusiastically. Meanwhile, in the foyer, Nora returned home with Marty, who was emotionally drained from the day in court and opted to retire to her room. \n\n\nAt Llanfair, Natalie was looking for Jared, but found Viki in the living room by the Christmas tree. Natalie told Viki she needed to hide Jared's present: a framed photo of the Buchanan ranch at sunset. As Natalie recounted how much the ranch meant for her and Jared, and how their memories had helped them through their time in the secret room, Viki was seized with guilt, blaming herself for Jessica's illness and Natalie's harsh upbringing. Natalie told Viki it wasn't her fault, and that it was Christmas, a time for joy and togetherness. As they fretted over Chloe and Bree and how Jared and Natalie had adapted to caring for the kids, Viki asked Natalie if she and Jared had any thoughts on their own children for the future. Natalie laughed and said they hadn't even talked about getting engaged. \n\n\nJared returned to the house and greeted the ladies, while Natalie hurried upstairs to check on Chloe. With a moment alone, Jared took Viki aside and told her he needed to ask her for her blessing to marry Natalie. Viki hugged Jared, overjoyed. \n\n\nAt Todd's house, T\u00e9a let herself and her client inside, breaking through the police tape. As Todd surveyed the darkened, lonely home, T\u00e9a urged him to get out and spend time around people during the holiday. Todd snapped that he wanted to be alone, and told her to forget about her bail money. T\u00e9a was disgusted with his attitude, and told him, \"You have changed. You're worse.\" She stormed off, leaving Todd alone to wander the house. As Todd drifted upstairs, he found himself in Marty's old room, where he discovered the electric piano. He played a few halting notes of \"Heart & Soul,\" but couldn't bring himself to finish it. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Cafe, Carlotta was outraged as Antonio tried to sell her on hosting an impromptu wedding reception for Cristian and Vanessa. Carlotta refused, calling Vanessa a \"bruja,\" but under pressure, relented to break out some of the leftover champagne from the grand opening. Sitting at the lunch counter, Talia got off the phone after comforting Sarah. Antonio was mortified to hear that Sarah had been forced to witness the wedding. Just then, Cristian and Vanessa arrived with Lola, sharing an awkward moment with the family. Antonio begged Talia and Carlotta to play along for the time being, but Vanessa's attempts to ingratiate herself to her new mother-in-law fell on deaf ears. \n\n\nAntonio pushed Cristian to show the death threat to the police, but Cristian wasn't sure how much good it would do, and said that prison walls would not keep someone like Ray Montez from seeking his revenge. Antonio and Talia spotted a stranger watching Vanessa and Lola from outside the caf\u00e9, and immediately apprehended him, only to realize the man was a wedding photographer Cristian had hired. Talia tore into Cristian for putting Sarah through the pain of watching him marry another woman, and asked him if he had a thing for Vanessa, after all. Cristian sputtered out a denial, but Talia wasn't convinced. She warned him that he could lose Sarah over his choices, and said that perhaps that was what he deserved. Antonio gave Cristian a piece of his mind, as well, but Cristian stood firm, insisting that the family would come around to understand why he had done what he did for the Montezes. Taking a break from the family strife, Cris and Vanessa began to fill each other in on the personal details of their lives, and Vanessa gave him a few salient points about her sleeping habits. She joked that he'd have to give up his side of the bed, because it was her preferred side to sleep on. \n\n\nT\u00e9a swooped in to the cafe full of praise and congratulations for \"Mr. and Mrs. Vega,\" but she was met with a frosty reception from Antonio and Carlotta, particularly after gloating about getting Todd out on bail. Antonio took T\u00e9a aside and asked her to hand over the death threat sent to Vanessa; when she did, Antonio asked her how she was sure it had come from Ray. T\u00e9a asked who else it could have come from, and then took a call on her cell phone. She headed outside, leaving Antonio to study the anonymous note. \n\n\nA variety of scenes unfolded across town: Clint, Nora, and Matthew lit the menorah at the Buchanan mansion. Back at Llanfair, Natalie snuck her gift to Jared under the tree, while hastily shaking his gifts to her, unaware that Jared and Viki were watching her with amusement. Blair took Starr home from the courthouse, while John accompanied Cole. Marty lay alone in her bedroom, surrounded by her raft of paperwork about Todd and his crimes. And at Todd's house, Todd found Marty's old nightgown, and buried his face into its fabric in sorrow. \n\n\nOutside the Buenos Dias, T\u00e9a took her phone call, assuring her \"client\" that everything was going according to plan: Vanessa had married Cristian. \"She's not going anywhere. There's plenty of time to prove she set you up.\" \n\n\nIn Colombia, Ray Montez was on the other end of the line, speaking from a pay phone in Plato Prison. \"Thank you, T\u00e9a,\" he said. \"Well done.\" \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Starr stands up in court and announces to the judge that Todd admitted to her that he was going to kidnap her baby. At that point, he tells the court that he wants to hear her testimony. Tea argues. But Nora is ready to prepare a case against Todd for kidnapping. Tea takes Todd to his empty apartment after getting the judge to grant him bail. He is very depressed to be alone in the empty house without Marty. Carlotta and Antonio tell Cristian that they seriously disapprove of his fake marriage to Vanessa. Tea reveals that she is in cahoots with Ray Montez and that by persuading Vanessa to marry Cristian, she can keep Vanessa in the US and prove that she set Ray up. Jared informs Clint and then informs Viki that he wants to marry Natalie. They both say yes although Natalie has no clue of his plans.",
