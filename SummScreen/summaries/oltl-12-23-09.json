    "soap_central": "\nMerry Christmas, Mr. Laurence\n\n\nBrody and Bree sat in the Llanfair solarium reading \"The Night Before Christmas\" together beneath the Christmas tree.  Jessica entered, touched to see her loved ones bonding, and Brody told her he had time enough before work to see his girls.  He presented Jessica with an early Christmas gift: a pearl necklace, pearls being Bree's birth stone.  Brody mentioned that the necklace left \"room for more,\" but grew flustered when Jessica slyly asked him to clarify his suggestion about her having more children.  Heading back to work, Brody kissed Jessica goodnight and said goodbye to Bree.\n\n\nAfter Brody left, Jessica sat down beside Bree and asked her if she liked Brody.  Bree nodded, and Jessica reflected that he was one of the good guys.\n\n\nAll across Llanview, family and friends exchanged gifts and holiday greetings: Viki's arrival at the mansion surprised a lonely Clint, and his ex gave him a hug, while Nora greeted Bo was  at the Palace with a stocking and a kiss, and Greg opened his hotel room door to find Destiny hiding behind her present.  Not far away, Elijah's arrival with a gift  interrupted T\u00e9a's attempts to write a letter to Danielle.  Alone in her room, Danielle trashed pages of the Sun featuring Todd's smiling face, but her spirits brightened when she found Matthew on her doorstep, Santa hat and all.  And at La Boulaie, the Cramer women decked the halls, while Blair answered the door to find Todd waiting, also bearing gifts.\n\n\nEven Mitch Laurence got a gift for Christmas.  At Llanview Hospital, a shifty-looking male nurse entered Mitch's room with a \"special dinner\" under a tray.  \"Merry Christmas, Mr. Laurence,\" the nurse said.  After he left, Mitch lifted the tray to find a cellphone with a bow pinned to it.\n\n\nBack at La Boulaie, Todd entered the foyer with gifts for Hope and Starr.  He was there to take Jack and Sam out for a night in the winter snow, but Blair realized he'd been hoping to find Danielle out as well.  She warned him not to push Danielle too hard for acceptance.  She headed upstairs to get the boys for Todd.\n\n\nIn the drawing room, Dorian and Addie decorated the tree as Addie rambled on about presents for Jack and Sam.  Dorian wasn't paying attention, however; her eyes were drawn to a family photo nestled in the tree's branches, identical to the defaced picture that had arrived at the house.  Staring at the photo, Dorian remembered her conversation with Mitch--and his ultimatum.\n\n\nDorian broke from her reverie as Addie noted that one of the packages under the tree was ticking.  Terrified that it could be a bomb, Dorian seized the package and tore the wrapping off to find a cuckoo clock.  At first the clock seemed innocent enough, until Dorian noticed the inscription on the wood: \"Time is running out.\"\n\n\nDetermined to find out who had bought the mysterious clock, Dorian called Blair, Langston, and Starr into the drawing room, but none of the Cramer women had any idea what she was talking about.  When her phone rang, Dorian answered it to hear Mitch taunting her on the other end.  \"I'm just cuckoo for Cramers!\" Mitch cackled.  Frightened, Dorian hung up.\n\n\nHoping to settle her nerves, Dorian sat down with \"her girls\" to take stock of the family.  She reminded them that Kelly, Cassie, and Adriana couldn't be with them for the holidays because Kelly was preoccupied with Kevin and Zane, while Cassie had a stomach ailment, and Adriana had injured her foot in a car accident.  Noting the odd \"calamities\" piling up, Dorian became increasingly anxious.  Langston wondered aloud if their streak of bad luck was what Madame Delphina had prophesied, while Dorian hid her fears.\n\n\nNot wanting to let on the source of her fear, Dorian cautioned her family that she had made many \"enemies\" in her new role as mayor of Llanview.  The girls laughed off Dorian's warnings, as she'd always had enemies.  Dorian was insistent that they be wary of impending \"danger,\" but her loved ones weren't buying it.\n\n\nAs the Cramers prepared to dip into a batch of Christmas eggnog, Addie handed Dorian the phone; she had another call.  It was Mitch once again, not yet done tormenting his ex-wife.  Mitch needled Dorian about Kelly, Cassie, and Adriana's absences, and implied that he could've been involved in Cassie and Adriana's misfortunes.  He warned Dorian to be careful about the eggnog: \"High cholesterol, it's a real killer.\"  Horrified, Dorian lunged over to the eggnog and flung it to the ground before any of the Cramers could drink it, while Mitch giggled and hung up.\n\n\nThe Cramers were shocked by Dorian's erratic behavior.  Dorian covered by claiming that she'd been on the phone with the grocer, who'd warned of a recall of bad eggs; she said she was going to have the eggnog tested for contaminants, and hurried out of the drawing room.  The girls were unsettled, and Langston asked Addie if Dorian seemed strange to her.  \"Dorian's always strange,\" Addie said as she shrugged.\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, an intoxicated Charlie lurked outside Mitch's room, and swigged from the flask in his coat pocket.  He attempted to enter while Mitch was on the phone with Dorian, but the guard refused to let him in despite Charlie's growing anger.  When he heard Mitch's laughter, Charlie snarled that Mitch was laughing at him. He lunged for the door and wrestled with the guard.  Just then, Brody arrived,  pulled Charlie off the officer, and calmed him down.  Brody instantly realized Charlie was drunk, and Charlie told him Viki didn't know he was drinking, or that he was there for vengeance.\n\n\nCharlie apologized to Brody for losing control, but Brody told him that the important thing was for him to get back on the wagon.  He said he'd take Charlie home, but Charlie didn't want Viki to see him in his drunken state.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Viki noted Clint's aloofness, and asked if he and Nora were still attending Christmas at Llanfair.  Knocking back liquor by the shot, Clint told Viki that Nora wouldn't be there, because he'd kicked her out for cheating on him with Bo.  Viki listened in shock as Clint recounted the sordid details of Bo and Nora's road back to love in the wake of Matthew's accident; he couldn't help but wonder, \"What part of Matthew's paralysis got [them] so damn horny?\"  He told Viki that his brother and his wife had played him for a fool for months, but he would make them pay.\n\n\nSuggesting that Bo and Nora had to feel guilty for hurting him, Viki attempted to reason with Clint,  but he didn't want to hear it; as far as Clint was concerned, they'd betrayed him.  \"You sound like your father,\" she told him.  Clint took the comparison to Asa as a compliment.  Viki asked him to return to Llanfair with her, but Clint refused to depress their children with his cuckolding.  He told her he didn't need her pity, and ordered Viki to go home.\n\n\nViki told Clint he could shut her out, but neither she nor Bo would let him destroy himself.  \"I have no brother,\" Clint seethed.  Heading out the door, Viki reminded him that Asa occasionally said that of his sons as well.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Bo and Nora exchanged gifts: a fishing trip package for him, and a ballroom dancing brochure for her, two of the couple's favorite things.  They embraced, but the romance cooled as they realized they had to tell Matthew and Danielle the reason for their new accommodations, and face the music with their friends and family about what they'd done to Clint.\n\n\nJust then, Rachel arrived.  \"So,\" she began, \"we're homeless!\"  Bo and Nora apologized for their exile from the mansion, but Rachel said she was happy they could finally be together.  The trio was ready to put a positive spin on the situation until a bellboy arrived with a mountain of bags: all of Nora, Matthew, and Rachel's belongings from the mansion, with a note from Clint to Bo that read, \"They're your problem now.\"\n\n\nAfter Rachel left, Bo and Nora continued to fear the depth of Clint's wrath.  Bo told Nora his brother was channeling Asa, but he was sure Clint would recover if they gave him time and space.  In the meantime, all they could do was be together, support each other, and care for Matthew.\n\n\nBack at Llanfair, Viki returned to the solarium and asked Jessica if Charlie had returned home from his \"AA meeting,\" and was disappointed to learn he was still out.  Turning to Bree, she told the little girl that she'd seen \"Grandpa\" Clint, who hadn't left any cookies or carrots out for Santa and his reindeer. She suggested that Bree and Jessica visit him.  \"He needs you.\"\n\n\nAt the mansion, Clint stared at the photographs of his wedding to Nora, and tossed them into the fireplace one by one.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Greg was delighted with the iTunes playlist Destiny had given him for Christmas.  He told his little sister that he was going to take Rachel with him to the family dinner, a course of action Destiny did not recommend; she reminded him that their mother still hated Rachel.  Greg shrugged off her concerns, but Destiny was convinced it would get ugly.  Rachel arrived as Destiny walked out, and wished the teen a merry Christmas.  \"Yeah, you hold onto that,\" Destiny quipped.\n\n\nGreg told Rachel he'd taken time off from the hospital to be with her, and explained that he wanted her to accompany him to the Evans family's Christmas dinner.  Rachel was as gun-shy about the idea as Destiny, but Greg insisted his mother could handle him making his own choices.  When she mentioned her rootless living situation, Greg suggested she move in with him until she found a permanent place.  Rachel was hesitant, but Greg told her he wanted to care for her and make her life easier; he was determined to make her put herself first for once.  When he asked her what she needed, Rachel responded by kissing him passionately.\n\n\nAt T\u00e9a's suite, T\u00e9a was surprised to see Elijah bearing gifts.  Elijah told her she'd never been his enemy, and presented her with a framed photo of Danielle and Ross.  He suggested she give it to Danielle in order to break the ice between them, but T\u00e9a was sure Danielle wouldn't see her.  Elijah told T\u00e9a he wasn't leaving town; his law firm in Philadelphia could run itself, and he was determined to put his brother's family back together, even if it had changed.\n\n\nAnswering a knock at the door, T\u00e9a found Todd outside with a gift of his own.  As Elijah left, Todd told T\u00e9a the gift was from Jack and Sam, who were waiting for him in the lobby.  He asked about Danielle, and if she was still staying at the Buchanan mansion.  After some hemming and hawing, T\u00e9a revealed that Danielle was staying in the Palace as well.  Enraged, Todd accused her of attempting to run away with their daughter once again.\n\n\nTodd rushed to the elevator to find Danielle, but T\u00e9a stopped him, and pleaded with him to hear her out.  She explained that Clint had thrown Nora out, which left Bo, Nora, Matthew, and, by extension, Danielle with no other place to go.  Todd told her that Danielle did have a place to go, once they told her the truth about her parents.  T\u00e9a insisted that it wasn't time yet; Ross was the only father she'd ever known, and she needed time and space to heal before she would listen to anything either of them had to say.\n\n\nTodd relented, accepting the wisdom of T\u00e9a's words.  Realizing she would be alone for the holidays, he grudgingly suggested she visit with Jack and Sam in the hotel lobby, and join the family for Christmas Eve at his place.  \"Even you shouldn't be alone on Christmas,\" Todd said with a grin.\n\n\nAt Danielle's suite, Danielle asked Matthew why they were stuck at the Palace so close in proximity to T\u00e9a, and suggested it was a ploy to make her forgive her mother.  Matthew wasn't sure of his parents' reasons but said it had nothing to do with T\u00e9a, although Danielle did need to learn to forgive.  He presented her with a makeshift Christmas gift: a map of Llanview and a bus pass, so she'd know how to get around on her own.  Danielle apologized for not having a gift to give him, but Matthew said all he wanted for Christmas was to be able to walk.  Wiggling his feet at her, he told her he was making progress.\n\n\nDanielle was pleased with Matthew's improvement, but teased him and told him she bet he could do better; she wanted him to try to stand up.  Matthew was reluctant, fearful of being humiliated and falling in front of her.  Danielle told him that if he fell, she'd just help him up.  As Danielle helped him rise from his wheelchair, Matthew told her not to let him go, but as the boy tottered on his feet, Danielle told him his own weight was supporting him, not her.  \"Oh, my God,\" Matthew breathed. \"I'm standing!\"\n\n\nAs Matthew teetered back and forth to keep his balance, Danielle encouraged him to walk towards her.  After several halting steps, Matthew dove into her arms, overjoyed.  Just then, Destiny walked in, stunned by the sight before her eyes.  \"Look, Des!\" Matthew exclaimed. \"No wheels!\"  Walking to his friend, he hugged her as well.\n\n\nStunned by his newfound mobility, Matthew couldn't wait to show his parents.  Swinging open the hotel door, Destiny suggested they show them immediately.  \"Let's take a walk!\"\n\n\nAt Llanview Hospital, Dorian confronted Mitch in his hospital room.  She told him what he already knew: the eggnog at La Boulaie had been laced with strychnine poison.  Mitch mocked her with an ersatz show of concern, and told her he was glad he could help keep her family safe.  Her face set in stone, Dorian tersely told Mitch she'd do as he asked; Bo would be fired by the new year.  \"Hallelujah,\" Mitch murmured.\n\n\nAfter Dorian left, Mitch basked in his triumph and hummed \"Joy To The World.\"  Grabbing the television remote, he turned it on, and the musical strains of \"Joy To The World\" echoed across Llanview.\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, a visit from Jessica and Bree  lifted Clint from his sorrow by, while at Llanfair, Brody and Charlie watched from the cold winter's night as Viki stood alone in the solarium, then turned out the lights.  At La Boulaie, Dorian returned home as Blair, Hope, Starr, and Addie opened presents, including Todd's gift to Hope, a dedicated wing at the hospital.  Langston comforted her mother with a hug, but Dorian's face remained frozen with fear.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Greg and Rachel tore each other's clothes off in the throes of lovemaking, while Todd and T\u00e9a ran into a furious Danielle in the halls.  Danielle tore past them and hurried into her hotel room; she slammed and locked the door behind her.\n\n\nBo and Nora opened their door to find Matthew standing there in his new basketball shoes, with Destiny by his side.  Stunned, they watched with joy as Matthew staggered over to them and fell into their family embrace.  Beaming with pride, Destiny watched the family reunion and placed her gift on the floor, then walked away into the night. \n\n\n",

Todd arrives at La Boulaie to pick up the boys with a gift for Hope. At Llanfair, Brody gives Bree a book to add to her collection. He gives Jessica a charm necklace with Bree's birthstone on it. He tells her it has room to add more birthstones if she decides to have more children. Starr, Langston, Dorian, and Addie are at La Boulaie celebrating Christmas. Starr and Langston want to wait for Cassie and Adriana, but Dorian informs them that Cassie is ill and Adriana broke her foot in an auto accident so they won't be coming. Addie brings Dorian a gift with no tag on it. Dorian observes that it is ticking and wants to get rid of it, but Addie insists on opening it. It's a cuckoo clock with a note on it that says, \"Time is running out.\" An orderly brings Mitch Laurence's dinner platter. When Mitch lifts the cover, he finds a cell phone on the plate. He calls Dorian and tells her it's too bad about Cassie and Adriana not being able to make it. He makes a comment about the eggnog so Dorian knocks it off the table before anyone can drink it. She goes to Mitch's hospital room and tells her that the eggnog had strychnine in it. He smugly tells her it is a good thing he was able to warn her before someone took out all of the Cramer at once. She tells him she will do whatever he wants and that she will fire Bo Buchanan before the New Year. Charlie goes to the hospital to confront Mitch, but Brody stops him. Brody reveals that he knows Charlie fell off the wagon and tells him to call his sponsor. Brody takes Charlie home and sneaks him in the back so that Viki won't see him in his condition.

Rachel tells Greg that she has to find a new place to live and he invites her to move in with him. Matthew stands and takes a few steps. Clint tells Viki that Nora and Bo have been having an affair. She invites him to spend Christmas at Llanfair, but he says no. Viki goes home and suggests that Jessica take Bree to see Clint and cheer him up. Todd brings T\u00e9a a gift from the boys. He asks about Dani and she reveals that she is staying with Bo and Nora here at the Palace. Todd thinks Tea orchestrated that to have Dani close to her so she can take Dani away from him again. She assures him that Dani wouldn't go anywhere with her right now. Todd decides that T\u00e9a shouldn't be alone on Christmas Eve, so he invites her to come home with him. Dani runs in to them when they are leaving. She pushes past them, runs into her room, and locks the door.",
