Rex notices a bruise on her arm and she tells him about her fight with Blair. He apologizes for missing the day. She asks if he got any leads and he tells her that he found a lead, but he didn't go to South America because he's broke and he wanted to give her a present. Rex opens his present, the watch Adriana bought him. He of course loves it. Then he gets her present, which is a Black and Decker Dustbuster, and she is not happy. Adriana gets dressed and gets ready to leave in a huff. Rex goads her into getting the engagement ring out of the Dustbuster, and she's shocked. Rex gets down on one knee and proposes to Adriana. \n\n\nVincent and Layla are having coffee with her mother, Lisa Williamson. Lisa grills Vincent about his work. The doorbell rings and it's Cristian at the door. Layla is furious that he didn't listen to her about waiting to come visit, and Cristian says he's not leaving until he sees Evangeline. He suggests sneaking in and Layla shouts at him that it's not possible. Lisa comes to the door and tells him that when she cleaned Evangeline's apartment after her accident, she threw away all the photos of Cris. Layla defends him. Lisa tells him he broke her daughter's heart and tells Cris he's the reason Evangeline is in a coma. Layla lets her mother have it, saying it's not Cristian's fault. Lisa angrily wants to know why, if Cristian loved Evangeline, he could not forgive her. Layla has had enough, and tells her mother to take back what she said to Cristian, or Layla will stop speaking to her. She tells Lisa she doesn't have all the facts, and she was raised to fight for what's right. That means that Cristian might be the one who can get through to her. Cristian says he's been praying for Evangeline, and he wants to tell her he's sorry. Lisa relents and lets Cristian talk to Evangeline. She makes him promise her that she won't regret it. \n\n\nDorian and Blair talk about Addie's antics since moving in to La Boulaie.

Viki says she's way out of practice for the morning after. Charlie says all the right things, and Viki seems to relax. They talk about Charlie's son, and compare notes. They've both hit a wall recently, says Viki, but that doesn't mean he should stop trying. Charlie recounts how important it was to him to find his son and make it right. Instead of wanting something from his son, he wants to apologize to him. He thanks Viki for being able to talk about it.

They are interrupted by a knock at the door. It's Jared. He spots Natalie inside the door, and tells John he's got one hell of a nerve for working the situation. Jared comes right in and Natalie tells him this is none of his business. John reminds him that uncles that get too familiar with their nieces end up in jail, or worse.
