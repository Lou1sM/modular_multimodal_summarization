Drawing close to him, Marty said that she loved him and wished him a merry Christmas. Todd responded and leaned in to kiss her, but was startled when he awoke to T\u00e9a shouting, \"Merry Christmas!\" Hoping to cheer him up, T\u00e9a presented Todd with a gift, but he demanded that she leave him alone. Admitting that T\u00e9a had interrupted his pleasant dream about Marty, Todd was in no mood to entertain T\u00e9a. Refusing to let Todd wallow in self- pity, T\u00e9a insisted that he get over Marty and move on with his life. Todd was adamant that his life had no purpose with Marty. \n\n\nWhen T\u00e9a refused to leave and asked if she could be of any help, Todd asked for her advice. He wondered if she thought that Marty could one day forgive him. Explaining that she wasn't an expert on Marty, T\u00e9a urged Todd to regain the confidence in himself that he once had and the ability to do anything. T\u00e9a pleaded with him to go back to being the man that he once was. When T\u00e9a asked Todd what he was willing to do in order to receive Marty's forgiveness. Todd replied, \"Anything!\" T\u00e9a suggested that Todd shower and make an attempt to get through the holidays. T\u00e9a reminded Todd that he did have three wonderful children. Feeling sorry for himself, Todd remarked that Starr no longer considered him as her father. Todd sadly related that he couldn't even purchase gifts for his children because his assets were frozen. T\u00e9a informed him she had used her authority as his power of attorney to purchase gifts for his children. To T\u00e9a's surprise, Todd gave her a pleasant thank you. After T\u00e9a had left, Todd took her advice and showered. \n\n\nAt the cottage, Rex showed up with Shane's Christmas gifts. Rex worried that Shane would be disappointed about not receiving the Z-Box gaming system and blamed Dorian for her selfishness. Bolting downstairs, Shane begged his parents to allow him to open his Christmas presents. Gigi watched as Rex attempted to distract Shane from opening his gifts. After Rex sent Shane upstairs to put on his pajamas, Gigi questioned how long Rex believed he could prevent Shane from learning that he hadn't received the Z-Box. Rex stated that he was hoping to keep Shane distracted in case one of his contacts came through at the last moment. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, the Cramer family gathered around as Dorian presented Jack and Sam with their Z-Box systems. While Jack was delighted, Sam preferred to play with his new Nerf football. Both Blair and Starr questioned why Dorian would purchase such an extravagant gift for Sam, but she insisted that she wanted the best for the boys. Moments later, the doorbell rang and Dorian excused herself to answer the door. Upon finding Mel at the door with several packages, Dorian exclaimed, \"All right, what did I do now?\" Mel handed Dorian the gifts and peeked inside the living room. Observing Jack and Sam, Mel commended Dorian on her choice of gifts for the boys and pointed out that Sam showed little interest in the toy. Heading out the door, Mel struck a nerve with Dorian when she mentioned a little boy that she knew would be heartbroken upon learning that he didn't receive a Z-Box for Christmas. \n\n\nDorian returned to the living room and informed Blair that Todd had purchased gifts for the children. Starr refused to open her gift, but insisted that the boys open theirs. Upon learning that Todd had sent him a gift, Jack said he wanted to discard it. After Blair convinced Jack to accept his father's gift, the family enjoyed Christmas together. As Blair and Dorian watched Starr and Langston help the boys open Todd's gifts, Addie remarked that the girls would help Jack and Sam become wonderful young men. Dorian remarked, \"That's what happens when you set a good example.\"\n\n\nAt Llanfair, as Jared revealed to a delighted Viki and Charlie exactly how he planned to propose to Natalie, Roxy barged into the study and surmised that Jared intended to propose. Everyone begged Roxy to lower her voice, but she continued to loudly inquire about the wedding. Overhearing the commotion, Natalie entered the room and wondered who was getting married. While Jared, Viki, and Charlie stood silent, Roxy suddenly announced that Charlie had proposed to Viki. Pleased by the news, Natalie had questions for the couple, but they quickly excused themselves. Out in the hall, Viki and Charlie chastised Roxy about interfering, and suggested that they leave in order to give Jared time alone with Natalie. \n\n\nAlone in the library, Jared presented Natalie with the Christmas gift that he had promised her-socks. Surprised that Jared had actually given her a box filled with socks, Natalie playfully emptied the box over his head. After declaring his love for her, Jared stunned Natalie when he got down on one knee and proposed. Thrilled, Natalie embraced Jared and happily accepted his marriage proposal. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Nora hugged Cole and wished him a merry Christmas. When Cole asked Nora if she had seen his mother, Nora told a disappointed Cole that Marty hadn't come downstairs all day. Later, Bo and Matthew joined Nora and Cole downstairs. As they discussed their holiday plans, everyone was pleasantly surprised when Marty entered the room. After introducing themselves to Marty, Bo and Matthew stated that they had plans to visit Rex and Shane and would return home later for Christmas dinner. Nora suggested that everyone exchange gifts. Cole was touched when Marty happily ran upstairs to retrieve his gift. Cole was pleased when his mother presented him with a book of poems. Hugging his mother, Cole told her that Todd could never take away the person that she really was. After sharing a special mother and son moment, Marty suggested that Cole pay Starr a visit. \n\n\nConsumed with guilt, Nora apologized to Marty for being unable to keep Todd in jail. Marty insisted that Nora had done her best. With a knowing look, Marty stated, \"Things have a way of working out with Todd.\" Presenting Marty with a journal as a Christmas gift, Nora encouraged her to write down her feelings. Sharing her own experiences with memory loss, Nora believed that it would help Marty put things in perspective and possibly even jog her memory. After Nora exited the room, Marty stared down at the journal. \n\n\nBack at the cottage, Shane wanted to open his gifts, but Rex continued to stall. After running out of excuses, Rex was forced to give into Shane's request. As Rex tried to explain that he wasn't able to purchase him a Z-Box, Bo and Matthew arrived with gifts and afforded Rex more time. Shane was adamant that he wanted to open the gifts under the tree, but Rex insisted that they open the gifts that Bo and Matthew had brought the family. Rex shared his feelings with Bo about being unable to provide Shane with the special gift he had hoped for. Bo reminded Rex that Shane would always remember the special moments that they had shared as father and son-not a gift. After accepting Bo and Matthew's gifts, Rex grew nervous when he overheard Shane tell Matthew that he was certain that he had received a Z-Box for Christmas. Shane's gift opening was further delayed when Roxy arrived with presents of her own. \n\n\nAfter Bo, Matthew, and Roxy had left, Rex and Gigi allowed Shane to open his gifts. As Shane opened each gift, he beamed with excitement with the possibility that the box might contain the Z-Box that he so desperately wanted. Once he realized that none of the boxes contained the video game, Shane was certain that it was a joke. Sadly, Rex and Gigi told their son that he hadn't received a Z-Box. Shane listened as Rex explained that he had tried to locate the toy but had been unsuccessful. To his surprise, Shane told him that he loved the other gifts and understood that Rex had done his best. Rex was touched when Shane referred to him as \"Dad.\" After sending Shane upstairs, Gigi reminded Rex that Shane had received the best present ever-he had spent Christmas with his family. Gigi gave Rex a kiss and walked away. Moments later, the doorbell rang. Rex was dumbfounded when he found Dorian standing on the doorstep. Handing him a gift-wrapped package, Dorian stated that it had been delivered to her home by mistake. Rex stood in disbelief as Dorian noted that a card was included in the package that had Shane's name on it. As Rex accepted the package, a stern Dorian warned, \"This doesn't change anything between us!\" \n\n\nAs Rex stared at the package in disbelief, Shane and Gigi returned downstairs. Shane noticed the box and made a mad dash for the package. After opening the gift and observing the Z-Box, Shane squealed with excitement. An amazed Gigi asked Rex what had happened. Rex replied, \"A Christmas miracle!\" \n\n\nA strange man trekked through the snow. Dressed in a robe, wearing sandals, and carrying a large stick, the strange man was headed toward Llanview. \n\n\nAt the Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Viki and Charlie discussed their excitement over their children's engagement. Holding Charlie's hand, Viki stated that many strange events had occurred in their lives lately and that she wouldn't be surprised by anything that took place in Llanview. Hearing a familiar voice, Viki and Charlie turned around and observed the strange man that had been traveling to Llanview. The man was dressed in a toga-he was David Vickers. At a loss for words, Viki simply stared at David. \n\n\nBo returned to the mansion and discovered Beaver Calhoun, a friend of Asa's. He stated that he had a message to deliver from Asa. \n\n\nCole visited Starr at La Boulaie and spent Christmas with the Cramers. \n\n\nGigi watched as Shane and Rex bonded over video games. \n\n\nAfter taking his shower, Todd returned to the room and was startled to find Marty sitting on the bed.\n\n\n",
