He was unable to reach Kelly, but he left her a message. He was annoyed at the photos of Nate and Eddie on the front page of the Sun and the headline that read, \"Bastard Kills Bastard?\"\n\n\nJohn finally made his way to the door of the class, but he continued to talk on the phone. Dr. Wright gently urged him to turn off his phone and join the class. John noted that he was the chief of detectives, but the doctor wondered if he intended to leave his phone on in the delivery room.\n\n\nThe pair joked about the phone situation, and John reluctantly entered the classroom. The doctor pulled Natalie aside and whispered that she was worried about Natalie's stress level, especially with Brody and Jessica in the same class. Natalie assured the doctor that she was fine, and she was certain that everyone would end up happy.\n\n\nDr. Wright engaged the class members in some ice-breaking activities, though John was pre-occupied. As the individuals all spoke about themselves, Natalie offered the opinion that John was mostly consumed with work. Dr. Wright asked everyone to visualize themselves in a peaceful spot.\n\n\nBrody confessed how excited he was, and Jessica did her best to calm him down. John whispered to Natalie about her own calm spot, and she was confused when his description was that of a jail cell. Natalie daydreamed about her delivery, and she was horrified to see that Brody was with her baby. It took all that the doctor and the others had to get John to participate in the breathing exercise.\n\n\nThe class was finally over. The girls admitted that they were more concerned with having their babies than with their wedding plans. Natalie confessed that she hadn't had time to even think about a wedding, but John announced that he had. He preferred to get married before the baby's arrival. Natalie suggested the spring, but John had other ideas. He wanted to get married right away.\n\n\nKelly helped Rex to lift weights at the gym, and she reminded him that she had hired him to check for dirt on Aubrey. Rex wanted Kelly to take a break for the holidays, and Kelly understood. She had admired the job Rex had done on locating David, and she was looking forward to what he might learn about Aubrey. Suddenly, Rex blurted out that he couldn't take the case. Kelly dropped the weights on Rex, and he struggled to get out from underneath. Kelly walked around and continued to talk non-stop about Rex's refusal. She didn't understand.\n\n\nRex noted that Eddie had ended up dead after Rex had investigated him, and he didn't think that Kelly wanted the same thing to happen to Aubrey. He wondered what Kelly was afraid of. Kelly insisted that she merely wanted to protect a friend, but Rex disagreed. He thought that Kelly loved Joey, and she was meddling in Joey's relationship, which was a mistake. From what he observed, Rex felt that Joey and Aubrey were in love, and he didn't think that Kelly should get in the way.\n\n\nKelly maintained that she had liked Aubrey until she had a strange feeling about her. Rex suggested that it was right after Joey had proposed to Aubrey. Kelly wondered how Rex would feel if he found something suspicious in Aubrey's hotel room, but Rex wondered how Kelly would feel if he found nothing. Finally, the two made a pact. If Rex didn't find any evidence, then Kelly would let go of both her vendetta and Joey. Rex agreed that if he found something, he would take Kelly's side.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Joey and Aubrey spent the morning in bed. Aubrey remarked that they had been \"holed up\" since Christmas, and she was eager to get outside. She suggested they head to the gym. Joey thought that was a great idea, and he thought they might stop at Llanfair afterwards. Aubrey mentioned that Joey's family didn't like her, and she was certain that Viki would get rid of Aubrey if Viki were given the chance.\n\n\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door. It was Viki, and she wanted to know why she hadn't heard from her scantily clad son and his fianc\u00e9e. Viki announced that she wanted to give the couple a dinner at Llanfair, and they could invite others to attend. \"I know. We can invite Kelly,\" Joey exclaimed. Viki wanted to have the dinner that evening, but Joey reminded her that it was New Year's Eve, and he had planned to take Aubrey out. Aubrey ran off to get dressed, and she encouraged Viki to stay to chat with Joey.\n\n\nJoey approved of his mother's effort, but she suggested that he might want to reconsider his invitation to Kelly. As Aubrey listened from the next room, Viki advised her son that Kelly adored him. Joey was surprised to hear that, and he thought that Viki was imagining it. He assured Viki that he and Kelly were \"way over,\" and Aubrey didn't feel threatened with Kelly's presence. He belonged to Aubrey, he added. Aubrey heaved a sigh of relief.\n\n\nAubrey received a phone call, and she angrily told the person on the other end that they weren't supposed to call. \"I'll take care of it,\" she stated firmly. Joey walked in, and Aubrey claimed that she was on the phone with the florist. She would handle the flowers, and Joey could head to the gym, she suggested. Joey asked if Aubrey liked Kelly. \"What's not to like?\" she replied.\n\n\nDestiny found Clint sitting on a bench and reading the Sun as she strolled through Angel Square Park. She stopped to chat, and she asked him to help clear Nate of his charges. Clint explained that it was beyond his control, even though Destiny assured him that Nate hadn't committed Eddie's murder. It had to have been \"one cold-hearted snake,\" Destiny added, and Nate wasn't like that. Clint agreed, but he argued that one could never be certain of what another person was really like.\n\n\nDestiny advised him that she was also worried about Matthew. He appeared to be under a lot of pressure from various activities at school. Privately, she recalled her conversation with Matthew and his condemnation of Bo and Inez. Clint was happy to hear that Destiny was there for Matthew. They were surprised when Inez appeared and walked towards them. She assured Destiny that Nate was okay and was with his attorney, T\u00e9a. Just then, Darren also showed up and announced that he had a surprise from his heart for Destiny.\n\n\nDestiny walked over to Darren, but she was taken aback when Mr. Evans appeared. Darren called it a \"mini-family reunion,\" and Destiny was angry. Mr. Evans pleaded with her to return home. He and his wife missed her, and they belonged together. He wanted Destiny to give them a chance.\n\n\nDestiny rudely insisted that her home wasn't with Mr. Evans, but he offered to give her more time to think about it. After he left, Destiny turned to Darren. Her boyfriend couldn't believe that she'd spoken to Mr. Evans the way she had. His mother would have slapped him if he had spoken like that. He was caught off-guard when Destiny slapped him instead. Darren believed that he'd had to step in to help. Destiny reminded him that her parents were really her grandparents.\n\n\nDarren sadly stated that Destiny always went to Matthew when she was upset, and he thought that maybe Matthew should be Destiny's boyfriend. She wasn't the same girl that he'd known. Darren realized that she was upset and angry, but she'd forgotten all that the Evanses had done for her over the years, and she wasn't being forgiving. He walked away as Destiny called out to him. She asked if Darren were breaking up with her, but he didn't reply.\n\n\nInez spoke to Clint and asked if he were stalking her. She didn't have time to play games, as she was too involved with her son's affairs. Inez claimed to know her son, and she knew that Nate hadn't killed Eddie. Clint felt that she was not a good judge of character, and Inez glared at him and agreed. He pointed out that she didn't think she'd be able to sleep with Bo, but she had. Inez quickly corrected him. She hadn't really slept with Bo at all. Clint didn't care, except for the fact that he wanted Bo and Nora to believe that Inez had indeed slept with Bo.\n\n\nInez couldn't wait until Bo learned that Clint had coerced Inez to do what she'd done. Actually, she had no reason to hide the truth from Bo any longer, since Eddie was dead, Inez continued. Clint suggested that either Nate or Inez would regret it. Inez wondered what the catch was, and Clint described how he would foot the bill for Nate's college. If things didn't work out, then Nate would be in jail. One could never tell when evidence might show up or disappear, Clint continued. He didn't want his plans ruined.\n\n\nInez couldn't believe that Clint would \"sink so low.\" Clint offered to pay for Nate's defense, and Inez had a choice to make. She had to decide between her son and Bo, and she had to make up her mind quickly, Clint ordered.\n\n\nMatthew and Bo accompanied Nora as she returned home from the hospital. Matthew continued to make rude comments towards Bo, but Nora ignored him. She was looking forward to getting back to work so that she could locate the driver who had run Rex's car off the road. She even had some leads, she pronounced. Matthew perked up as he recalled driving the car that his mother would be searching for. Nora explained that she had seen a glow in the other car as it had headed towards her and Rex. She believed that the glow was from a cell phone.\n\n\nNora was quite enthused as she described how they could check out the cell towers for calls in the area and then compare those people to the cars they drove. They'd be able to check the tire tracks in the area. Matthew was visibly disturbed and suggested that perhaps the driver hadn't even known that an accident had occurred. Both he and Bo felt that Nora's memory was fuzzy, and she hadn't really seen what she thought she had.\n\n\nBo replied that he'd do his best, but Matthew was quick to criticize his father. He noted that Bo didn't always do his best, and Bo hadn't even been aware that Nora had been kidnapped. Matthew asked what Bo had been doing during that time. Nora defended Bo. She contended that Eddie had most likely had help to carry out his plan. Matthew imagined that it might have been Nate, but Bo disagreed. Nora wanted to take a bath, and Matthew continued to get his digs in at his father when Bo offered to help Nora out.\n\n\nAfter Nora left the room, Bo turned to his son. He wanted to know what Matthew's problem was, because he was sick of Matthew's attitude. Matthew sneered and said that maybe Bo could replace him with another son in the same way that his mother had been replaced. He knew about Bo and Inez, because he had seen them together. His father was all over the woman when Matthew had gone up to Inez's apartment. He called Bo a hypocrite and a liar, and he stated that Bo didn't deserve the Buchanan name.\n\n\nNora walked into the room when she heard Matthew's raised voice. She demanded that Matthew apologize to Bo, but Matthew said he'd apologize after Bo did the same. Matthew glowered at his father and accused him of playing Nora \"like a fool.\" Nora demanded answers from her son, and he finally spoke up. \"Dad cheated on you with his assistant,\" Matthew announced. He grabbed his coat and stormed out the door.\n\n\nNora couldn't understand why Matthew had said what he did. She was shocked, and she noted that \"Mr. Hyde\" had returned. She was tired of Matthew's teenage attitude, and as she continued to rant, Bo remained silent. Nora observed that they had to do something with their son. \"Nora, it wasn't a lie. Matthew didn't make it up. It's true,\" Bo finally said quietly.\n\n\nKelly worked out at the gym and took her frustrations out on the punching bag. Joey arrived and asked why she was so \"hot and bothered.\"\n\n\nAubrey was annoyed with the party on the phone, but she finally ended the call. As soon as she left, Rex made his move and broke into her room.\n\n\nMatthew found Destiny sitting alone at the park. She told him everything was wrong, and he comforted her. \"Yeah, me too,\" he said.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "When Nora comes home form the hospital, she immediately informs Bo that she wants to find out who ran her and Rex off the road. They are not aware that it was Matthew, but he figures it out. Yet, he protests that his parents need to realize that the cops can't do much an shouldn't waste their time knowing how effective they are when a criminal like Eddie Ford kidnaps the D.A. yet the police commissioner is not even aware, much less able to do anything about it. And he asks his dad just what he was doing when his mom was tied up by Eddie. When Bo is alone with his son, he demands to know what his problem is. Matthew indicates that he knows that Bo was with Inez the night his mom got kidnapped. He saw it with his own two eyes. Nora overhears and demands to know how her son could allege such vicious things. But Bo admits that it's true. He did sleep with Inez. Brody, Jessica, Natalie and John are all at a Lamaze class together. But John is clearly distracted. Vivian takes Natalie aside and asks if she is ok given the secret she's keeping from John, that Brody is the father of her baby. Daren attempts to get Destiny to reconcile with her parents/grandparents and come home. But she refuses and it appears she does not appreciate Daren interfering in her family's business. Rex admits to Kelly that he is not about to investigate Aubrey for her because it will only lead to trouble. But there appears to be suspicion about the secret phone calls Aubrey has whenever she is alone.",
