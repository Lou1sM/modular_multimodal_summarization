Meanwhile, in Llanview, it looks like Jack is in trouble. John sends him to jail. T\u00e9a is ready to represent him but warns Blair it does not look good for her son. Todd then concludes that somebody must have set Jack up. Neela is alone and feeling guilty for tape recording Jack although Vimal and Rama encourage her not to blame herself and realize that Jack needs to pay for what he did. However, that might not be as easily done as they assume since Gigi is alive and well."
