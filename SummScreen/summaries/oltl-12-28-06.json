Adriana wished they didn't know the truth about Tommy.\n\n\nStarr sat by Blair's bedside in the hospital while Viki tried to comfort Todd. Starr panicked when she lost Jack. Meanwhile, Jack had found his way into Spencer's room and asked him if he had tried to kill \"my mom and dad.\" Spencer reminded Jack that he had promised not to hurt his mom. Jack didn't believe him and told Spencer off. Starr and the security guard found Jack and they took him out of Spencer's room. Jack returned to his mom. Blair explained what a new year's resolution was and suggested he make one, \"so next year will be better.\" Blair reminded her son that they had to be better than him. (Him being Spencer). Blair whispered that she was so sorry about everything.\n\n\nViki was horrified when Todd said he had killed two of his sons now. Viki reminded him not to give up on himself because Starr and Jack hadn't. Viki said that everything that is good in him is in them. Viki told Todd to stop vowing to go after Spencer. Starr assured her dad that the miscarriage was an accident. \"We can't lose everything because of Spencer Truman,\" she declared.\n\n\nStarr asked Bo not to arrest her father. Bo replied that he didn't want to but added that he couldn't just look the other way.\n\n\nPaige paid Bo a visit. He gave her a huge kiss. Paige asked if it was okay for her to visit Spencer. Bo said fine. Paige showed Spencer a piece of paper and hoped it wasn't true. It was a photo of Hugh's headstone. Paige reminded Spencer that he'd never be getting out of the hospital. Paige told Spencer she didn't have a son in life or in death and then stormed out. Paige returned to Bo's arms and said she just wanted her son back.\n\n\nJohn kept refusing to take his medication. Natalie played the tough nurse and reminded him to follow the doctors orders. John told her that he had already taken some pain killers. Natalie reminded him that he's not all that tough. John admitted he wanted to hurt Spencer. Marty overheard this as she was eavesdropping by his door. Natalie and John began arguing. John sent Natalie off to make plans for new years as he'd probably be out cold. Natalie left and saw Marty in the lobby, near John's room. \"Dr. Saybrooke, what are you doing here?\" Natalie told her off a bit and went off with the nurse. Marty returned to John's room. Marty explained she wasn't the staff shrink. John said his mood was \"generally pissed off.\" Marty then asked him about Spencer Truman. John wondered what Truman was to her. Marty apologized for asking him and left. Marty said she was not working for Truman and then left. She returned to find John's bed empty. \"Oh John,\" she said, \"What have you done.\"\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Natalie and John argue. John didn't take his sleeping medication the night before and she is getting frustrated. She guesses that he is doing all this to rush his release from the hospital so he can go after Spencer. He is quiet when she suggests that. She thought that he was all over this stuff and was going to live a different kind of life when he gets better, but instead, he is more focused than ever on getting to Truman and making him pay. That seems to be the most important thing. Marty is at the door listening secretly to their conversation. She moves away quickly when she senses that Natalie is coming to the door. Natalie sees Marty walking off and she calls to her. She wants to know what Marty was doing there. Marty doesn't get a chance to answer her question because Natalie sees the nurse come by and she asks about John's medication. When Natalie and the nurse are out of earshot, Marty goes into John's room. He isn't friendly and becomes curious of why Marty wants to know about Spencer. Soon Marty realizes that she is being insensitive to him and she leaves. Jack has gone off while unattended and has ended up in the crazy bastard's room. He asks Spencer if he did the things that his family has been saying he did. He says that he and Todd have a strange grownup relationship that Jack can't understand. Jack senses that he is being lied to and gets angry. Just then the door flies open and Starr comes in with the guard and they drag Jack out of there. \"I hate you!\" Jack shouts at Spencer. Todd is furious when he hears that Jack went to see Spencer. Starr tells how Jack shouted that he hated the man. Jack tells his mother that he wants the man dead. Blair tells him that they have to be better than that Better than Spencer. Starr goes to see Bo to keep her father out of jail but to knows that things are not going to be that easy. Spencer's guard taunts him for being a psycho. \"Just do your job and make sure that no one else gets in here,\" Spencer shouts. Paige is upset. Hugh's adoptive family sent her an email of the tombstone for Hugh's grave. Bo gives Paige permission to go and see Spencer to show it to him. She goes in there and Spencer is immediately saddened when he sees the picture. \"When I get the charges dropped and get out of here, I will go and see my son here \" Paige says that he was never a father and that she will not allow him to go anywhere near her son! She will stop him at any cost! Martin returns to John's room to talk to him again. She is sorry that she ran off the way that she did when they were talking earlier, but when she goes into John's room, he is gone.",
