Natalie was astonished and at a loss for words. John promised that they would have a big reception later. Natalie didn't think it would be possible, since they didn't have a marriage license, but Brody suggested that they might be able to obtain a license and a three-day waiver from a judge. John knew of a judge who might be able to help.\n\n\nNatalie pulled John aside for a talk. She didn't want him to feel pressured into marrying her in a \"shotgun wedding,\" but John assured her that he didn't feel that way. He believed that they'd have no other time to have a ceremony, in between all of the other family weddings, holidays, and work. He just wanted to have something \"small and easy.\" \"We'd better hurry,\" Natalie replied enthusiastically, and she pulled him into a kiss. Marty was out of sight and overheard the conversation.\n\n\nJohn asked Brody to be his best man, and Natalie requested that Jessica be her maid of honor. The guys went off to track down a license, though John stopped when he saw Marty near the elevator. He told her he had some news, and Marty responded that she had news for him as well. She disclosed that Cole had received the books that John had sent him, and that her son was doing well. John stated that he and Natalie were going to be married, but Marty answered that she'd already known that. John was confused.\n\n\nMarty clarified that she assumed the couple would be married. She looked up and saw Natalie observing from a window on the other side of the hallway. Marty congratulated John and gave him a hug. Once John was gone, Natalie made her way over to Marty. She questioned what Marty had said to John, but Marty assured her that she'd kept her promise. She hadn't said anything to John about the baby's paternity.\n\n\nJessica saw Natalie and Marty talking and wanted to make sure that things were okay. Marty declared that she had just been congratulating Natalie, and Natalie agreed and left. Jessica was aware that there had been tension between Marty and Natalie, and she was impressed that Marty had been so gracious towards Natalie. Jessica revealed that the wedding was planned for that night. \"Then there's not much time,\" Marty responded. Jessica added that she and Brody would be present at the ceremony.\n\n\nJessica wondered how Marty was doing, and Marty replied that she had been finding ways to cope with all that had been going on in her life. Jessica extended an offer to help at any time, and Marty agreed that she planned to take Jessica up on it.\n\n\nAlone later, Marty looked forward to seeing everyone together in one room at the wedding ceremony. She had kept her promise not to say anything to John, but she had been saving her announcement for Jessica.\n\n\nClint paid a visit to Viki at Llanfair to talk to her about Joey's relationship. He wanted to know how they could get rid of Aubrey, the gold digger, because Clint hadn't changed his opinion of her. He didn't want Joey's pockets to be emptied, and it was Clint's job to protect his family. Viki thought it was more like the family fortune that Clint wanted to protect, but Clint asked Viki to talk to Joey and try to convince Joey to break things off with Aubrey.\n\n\nViki advised her ex-husband that she wouldn't participate, and it was Joey's mistake to make. Clint explained that he was also concerned because Joey really didn't know Aubrey very well, but Viki thought that Clint would alienate Joey even more if he decided to pursue his plan to break the couple up. Viki noted that if two people were really in love, then a third person couldn't break them up, no matter how hard she tried.\n\n\nClint noticed Viki's tone and word usage, and he wondered if there were something he should be aware of. Viki grew agitated and complained about Echo, who had been in Viki's life ever since the paternity test showed that Charlie was Rex's father. She and Nora shared similar situations, Viki added. Clint wanted more information, but Viki explained that she couldn't betray Nora. Clint revealed that Bo had confided in him, and that set Viki off.\n\n\nShe couldn't believe the text messages that Bo had received, nor could she understand why Eddie had kidnapped Nora in the first place. Viki thought that Inez had been perfectly capable of originating the plan, just as Nora did, but Viki couldn't believe someone would go to so much trouble to break a couple up. Viki only hoped that Inez wouldn't get between Bo and Nora. Clint agreed, but Viki was under the impression that Clint still held a grudge against his brother. Clint maintained that time shouldn't be wasted with resentment.\n\n\nClint offered to get rid of Echo for Viki, but Viki didn't like what Clint had implied. Clint assured her it was just a figure of speech. Viki thanked him and explained that she had someone else looking into things for her. She refused to elaborate on it further. Clint apologized for the predicament that Viki found herself in, but Viki clarified that it wasn't Clint's fault that Charlie had turned out to be Rex's father.\n\n\nViki urged Clint not to worry about Joey. Natalie interrupted their conversation when she ran into the house. She announced that she was getting married that evening, and she hoped her parents understood. She would have some family there, as Brody and Jessica would be witnesses. Clint was able to understand John's position on a big wedding, but he was concerned that Natalie wasn't thrilled with the idea. Natalie promised that she was fine and happy, so Clint was happy too.\n\n\nLater, Viki presented Natalie with a pair of earrings that had belonged to Natalie's grandmother. Viki wanted Natalie to wear them at her wedding. Viki thought that Natalie had been distracted, and she was worried that Natalie was rushing into a wedding ceremony. Natalie denied it and assured her mother that she was okay. Viki ordered Natalie to take lots of photos. Jessica rushed in and urged her sister to get dressed. Brody arrived with the license, and John noted that the judge would perform the ceremony. \"There is nothing standing in our way of getting married tonight,\" John said to Natalie.\n\n\nDownstairs in the Palace lobby, Aubrey purchased a French magazine at the newsstand. She flipped through the pages as she strolled away and looked at one page in horror. There was something that she couldn't allow Joey to see. She returned to the newsstand and asked to purchase every copy of the magazine. The vendor gave her the magazines, but he told her that he had sold an additional copy to someone else.\n\n\nRex let himself into Aubrey's room at the Palace in order to search for something that Kelly could use against Aubrey. He found some photos of Aubrey in an envelope and managed to get into her laptop, but he didn't find anything of value. Suddenly, he heard Aubrey's key in the lock, and he managed to hide himself under the bed before she made it to the bedroom. He listened as she spoke to someone on the phone and mentioned that she had gotten rid of all of the copies of the magazine except for one.\n\n\nAubrey ended her call and headed to the shower. Rex had his chance to run from the room before she returned.\n\n\nJoey found Kelly at the gym when he arrived, and he saw that she appeared to be frustrated. He knew exactly why and told her it was because she missed Kevin. Kelly half-heartedly agreed. Joey mentioned that Aubrey was \"caught up in wedding plans,\" so he wondered if he might be able to work out with Kelly. They reminisced about how they used to find other things to do instead of exercising.\n\n\nJust then, Cristian stomped in, obviously angry and in a bad mood. He had a copy of a French magazine, and he explained that his fianc\u00e9e's photo was inside. She was plastered all over another guy who happened to be her boss. Kelly offered to interpret the French description, but she stopped short mid-stream, claiming that her French was a bit \"rusty.\"\n\n\nCristian wondered what else his fianc\u00e9e was hiding from him. Kelly made sure to look over at Joey. She suggested that perhaps the photo had been posed, but Cristian grumbled that Layla's hands were in the man's pants. Joey clarified that Layla's hands were in the man's pockets. He thought it might be a publicity stunt. Kelly thought otherwise. Cristian confided that he'd tried to call Layla numerous times, but he hadn't been able to reach her. Kelly made a point of referring to the fact that a fianc\u00e9e was hiding something.\n\n\nCristian finally managed to talk to Layla on the phone, though he shouted at her during the entire conversation. Kelly saw an opportunity to again mention the fianc\u00e9e who hid things, but Joey stressed that his relationship with Aubrey was entirely different. Kelly found it amazing that Joey and Aubrey knew so much about each other in so short a time.\n\n\nAs Cristian continued to yell on the phone, Joey helped Kelly to exercise. He got close to her and had his hands on her, but he pulled away abruptly. He stated that he had to leave, but he invited Kelly to join him and Aubrey at Capricorn later in the evening. \"Rex, please find something,\" Kelly muttered after Joey had gone.\n\n\nBo confessed to Nora that he had slept with Inez, and that Mathew hadn't made it up. Shocked, Nora's jaw dropped, but she remained silent. \"Say something Red,\" Bo urged her. \"I don't feel so good,\" Nora replied as she ran to the bathroom. Shortly after, she returned. She asked how long it had been going on, and Bo assured her that it hadn't been an affair. It had only happened once, and it had been the evening of Eddie Ford's murder.\n\n\nNora couldn't believe that Bo had conducted himself in such a manner, while she had been bound and gagged and had suffered through Eddie touching her. She wanted details, and she wondered how Bo could have done such a thing. Bo emphasized that he hadn't known that Nora was in trouble, and he had believed that she was angry at him, especially after he'd received the text messages. He hadn't thought they'd made any sense. Nora couldn't understand how one argument and some text messages would force Bo into bed with Inez.\n\n\nSuddenly, Nora had a thought. She presumed that it was all payback for her going to bed with Sam. Bo denied it, but Nora believed that Bo had wanted to hurt her. \"Congratulations, you did,\" she said. Nora began to cry, and she reminded Bo that she had requested that he fire Inez previously. She had felt like a fool thinking there was something between Inez and Bo, but it turned out that she had been right, she added. Inez had learned of private details, and she'd used those details to entice Bo to her bed.\n\n\nBo still refused to believe that Inez had been involved in the texts and kidnapping, even though Nora pointed out that it had involved Inez's ex-husband. Bo hung his head in shame. He had betrayed Nora and his marriage, and he wished that he could turn back the clock. He promised that it would never happen again. He loved Nora, and he would make it up to her. \"Can you forgive me?\" he asked.\n\n\nNora wasn't certain that she believed Bo, and she felt that he'd only confessed because he had been caught. Bo admitted that he should have told her sooner, but he hadn't wanted to hurt her. He knew that it wouldn't happen again, and he thought they could get past it. He swore that he had forgiven her about Sam, and he had gotten past that. Nora commented that it had taken Bo ten years to forgive her, and she wondered how long she should take to forgive him. She had a huge hole in her heart.\n\n\nNora asked Bo to leave. He expressed his sorrow again and told her he loved her. \"I'm not giving up on us,\" Bo said sadly. Nora began to cry harder after Bo was gone. Then she moped about the apartment, and dropped their wedding photo into the trash.\n\n\nRex arrived at the gym, and he advised Kelly that he hadn't been able to find anything that Kelly could use against Aubrey. He mentioned the quality photographs that Joey had taken of his girlfriend, and he updated Kelly on what had happened after Aubrey had returned to her room. Kelly thought that Rex should \"stay on it,\" especially after the phone call he'd overheard. Cristian walked by yelling into the phone sarcastically, \"Happy New Year to you too.\"  Kelly left, but not before taking Cristian's magazine with her.\n\n\nClint found Bo sitting in the Palace. Bo explained that Nora had learned about Bo sleeping with Inez, and Nora had kicked him out. Clint reminded Bo that he'd given him specific instructions not to say anything to Nora. Bo revealed that Matthew had seen him with Inez. Clint claimed to be sorry, and he invited Bo to stay at his house instead of at the Palace. Bo was reluctant, but Clint insisted. \"What are brothers for?\" Clint asked.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "After Bo admits to Nora that Matthew is correct in that he (Bo) slept with Inez, she is devastated. He tells her that he won't give up on her and he loves her. But she tells him that there are some serious trust issues regarding that because he did not tell her and she only found out because their son caught him in the act. Bo then believes he needs to move out o their home and stay at the hotel. But Clint sees his brother there and insists that he lets Clint take him in and let him stay at Clint's home. Bo and Nora both still suspect nothing of Clint yet both believe that somebody must have put Eddie up to kidnapping her. Clint goes to talk to Viki telling her he'd like her help in running Aubrey out of town because he believes she's a gold digger who is going to blind their son and take his family's money. But she wants no part of that. She also suspects nothing of Clint regarding what happened to Nora. John and Natalie decide they are going to get married today since John wants to make it official before the baby is born. Overhearing that, at the hospital, Marty appears calm but decides she is going to do something. She confirms that she promised Natalie, swearing on her son's life, that she would not tell John that Natalie is pregnant by Brody and lying to everybody about it. But, Marty decides she will tell Jessica. Rex agrees to attempt to find out some dirt about Aubrey for Kelly and overhears a secretive phone call. Aubrey discovers a picture in a magazine that she cannot ever let Joey see. Yet we have yet to find out what it is.",
