    "tvmega_recap": "Rick tells Starr he isn't accepting Todd's offer of cash in exchange for dropping the charges against her. He says he owns her and that he wants exploit the PR value of her family. She tells him the deal is off and she will call her dad's lawyers to take care of it. He tells her not to waste her time; the contract is airtight. He plays her the edited version of the \"Jailbait\" video, which is quite good, but Starr doesn't like it. Rick tells her it will be huge, she will be huge, he will be huge when she takes him to the top, and he won't consider settling. Shane is mildly surprised to see his mother come home, but isn't completely convinced it really is her. Once he believes the real Gigi standing in front of him, Shane tells Rex and Gigi that Jack is in jail because of evidence he and Neela procured. He wonders what to do about Jack now that he knows Gigi's lookalike sister Stacy died while trying to kill Gigi. Gigi says the right thing to do is tell the police that she is alive. While Shane goes out to warm up the car, Rex tells Gigi about Aubrey. She encourages him to go see Aubrey while she and Shane go to the police station. Rex calls Aubrey and asks her to come over. Neela visits Jack in jail and admits that she recorded their conversation when he confessed to killing Gigi because Shane asked her to. He reminds her that she said he could trust her. She says she didn't know him very well when Shane asked her to do it. He says she knew him when she needed help and he hid her to keep Vimal from shipping her back to India. He asks her how she could do this to him. He calls her a backstabbing bitch and orders her to leave. Crying, Neela tells Rama that Jack hates her now. She regrets helping Shane. Rama consoles her little sister-in law, telling her that if Jack goes to prison, it will be because of what he did, not what she did. At the police Station, Todd tells Blair that someone set up Jack but he will make everything right. Tea asks him if he intends to kill the person. Tea explains to Todd and Blair that Neela's tape contains a full confession in Jack's voice. She tells him that she may be able to knock it down to manslaughter since it was accidental, but that it may be hard to argue that there was no premeditation because of Jack's history of bullying Shane. Blair says he is just a boy that made a horrible mistake and wonders if he should have to pay with his life. John McBain interjects that Gigi Morasco paid with hers. John tells Tea that if anyone leans on Neela, he will hold her responsible. She suggests that he get Todd behind bars soon. Todd sees Rama and Neela outside the station and immediately begins harassing Neela. Tea advises Jack not to have any contact with Neela and not to say anything about her because she is going to try to prevent the tape from being admitted into evidence. The door opens. Jack and Tea are shocked to see Shane and Gigi in the doorway."
