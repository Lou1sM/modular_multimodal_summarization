John began strangling Spencer with the belt from his robe. Marty broke it up. John headed up the stairs vowing to get Spencer, no matter what. Marty told him she was Marty Saybrooke. John grabbed her, saying, \"You let Truman walk. Why didn't you tell me who you were? You are a quack.\" John collapsed on the stairs. Marty got John back to his room. Natalie arrived at John's room all dressed up with champagne and two flutes. \n\n\nThe Buchanans \u2014 Clint, Viki, Natalie, Antonio and Jessica \u2014 toasted the New Year. Natalie then headed to the hospital. Viki told Clint that she and Dorian had declared war over him. Clint asked Viki go on an adventure with him. They almost kissed but they were interrupted by Bree (via baby monitor). \n\n\nTodd apologized to Blair. She avoided looking at him. Todd admitted that he never stopped loving her. Todd talked about letting go of his anger and pain, but he couldn't let go of her. He remembered that two years ago he was with Margaret he heard Blair's voice on the television and that saved his life. He said he didn't deserve her forgiveness. Bo came in to question Blair about what exactly happened on the roof. Blair's comments took Todd off the hook. Todd returned and reminded Blair that they still have a great deal together \u2014 their kids, and each other. Todd brought in a bottle of champagne. \n\n\nAt Capricorn, Nash and Dorian saw a drunken Claudia in the corner. Adriana and Layla welcomed their dates, Rex and Nash, and were exited about the debut of their lingerie collection. Cris began taking pictures for another magazine (not Dorian's Craze). This upset Dorian a great deal. Dorian was upset that Craze couldn't cover the event, but then said, \"I couldn't be more proud.\" Layla was concerned that the photographers were only getting the bra straps. Jessica immediately took off her shirt and showed her sparkly, fringed bra, much to the delight of Antonio and Nash. Rex told Antonio that Nash had stepped up to the plate in Claudia's absence and that Claudia was home. Claudia wasn't there to sing, but Evangeline was and became a disco queen for a song. \n\n\nStarr ran into Langston in the school gym. The two friends made up. Starr wasn't that interested in a party. Before the two could leave, Cole showed up. Quiet filled the gym. Cole told Starr that he felt bad about letting the team down. Starr gave Cole a pep talk and reminded him to forgive himself. The two held hands. \n\n\nWhen the clock struck midnight, everyone kissed someone...except Dorian. \n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Spencer is sleeping. He feels light on his face and wakes to find John in his doorway. \"You are not on my guest list,\" Spencer tells John. John comes deeper into the room and closes the door. John has some cloth and he wraps the fabric around and around his knuckles keeping the piece between the fists tight! \"Guard!\" Spencer shouts, but no one comes. He knows what this is. The boys in blue protect each other and this is part of that. Marty has come to John's room and finds that he isn't there. She asks a nurse where John is but she too has no idea where the man is. Marty is beginning to have a good idea though where John has run off to. Marty gets to Spencer's room in time to find John over Spencer choking the life out of him. Spencer struggles but John is too strong. Marty pulls John off the man and drags him out of the room. The guard comes in and Spencer starts telling how John just tried to kill him. \"What man?\" the guard asks smiling. He walks out. John goes to the stairwell and is trying to climb the stairs. Marty follows him and the door closes behind them. He wants to be left alone but Marty will not leave him. She feels that his behavior must be due to the mixture of drugs that he is taking. He orders to leave him alone and tries to make it up the stairs. He takes two steps and falls to the stairs in pain. He is in bad shape and passes out. When he wakes, he is back in his bed and Marty is standing over him. She tells him that he passed out and that she saw to it that he got back to bed. Todd is with Blair and he talks to her about how sorry he is for all the trouble that he has caused. Bo comes in with Paige and wants to talk to Blair alone. Blair insists that Todd be allowed to stay. She tells Bo that the accident wasn't Todd's fault and that the incident was just an accident. Bo has no choice but to lighten up on his charges. Todd will still be charged with not telling Spencer was hurt and at the scene, and kidnapping Todd pours his heart out not to Blair and asks her if she thinks that they will ever be a couple again. She smiles that that reassures him that everything is going to be okay. At UV, Claudia is supposed to be taking care of the bar, but she has gotten herself into the bottle instead. She calls her sponsor and is driven home. Adriana has her fashion show and Cristian takes pictures as they model at the club. There are guests lined up around the block to get in. Nash takes over with a little help from Rex and things run great! Evangeline sings and brings the crowd into 2007 with a little Boogie, oogie, oogie!",
