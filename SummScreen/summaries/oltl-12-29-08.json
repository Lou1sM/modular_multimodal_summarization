When Marty assured him that she wasn't an apparition, Todd said that she would never come to visit him unless she intended to kill him. Reminding him that she didn't kill him when she had the opportunity, Marty stated that she wasn't capable of killing Todd. A confused Todd asked Marty to stay while he left the room to change. Marty agreed. Under her breath, Marty remarked, \"I'm not going anywhere until I get what I came for.\" \n\n\nWhen Todd returned, Marty explained that she had come to retrieve her journal. Removing the journal that had been tucked under the mattress and taking a seat on the bed, Marty opened the book and read a few excerpts. Marty shared a passage from her journal:  \"I felt like a blank page in a book until I met Todd Manning.\" Todd apologized to Marty for the treatment she had received on the stand. Marty continued to read from her journal, but when she came to a blank page, Marty began stating words that didn't exist on the page. A troubled Todd listened as Marty described the excitement that she felt because she would soon be celebrating New Year's Eve with Todd. An upset Marty lashed out at Todd and insisted that it had all been a lie. Attempting to calm Marty, Todd pleaded with her to believe that he never lied about loving her. Rising to her feet, Marty maintained that Todd had lied to her and kept her away from her family and friends. \n\n\nWalking toward the door, Marty's attitude appeared to change somewhat. Marty led Todd to believe that she might still have feelings for him. Todd wondered if there was a chance that they could be together again and begged for a second chance. Unable to control her disgust any longer, Marty stormed out of the house. Todd was visibly shaken. \n\n\nLater, Todd received a phone call from Marty. Stating that she needed to see him, Marty apologized for her behavior and asked Todd to spend New Year's Eve with her. Todd quickly agreed to meet her. Citing that no one would understand, Marty asked Todd to keep their meeting a secret. Todd agreed. \n\n\nAt La Boulaie, an elated Dorian presented Langston with a certificate of adoption. Langston was delighted and remarked that no one could ever take her away from Dorian again. Dorian then announced that she had another surprise -- she had planned to take Langston on a shopping spree to New York City on New Year's Eve. Langston happily accepted Dorian's invitation and the two made plans for the upcoming trip. \n\n\nMeanwhile, in the kitchen, John surprised Blair with a long, passionate kiss. Blair was pleased to learn that John had come to wish her a belated Merry Christmas. When he presented Blair with plane tickets and announced that he wanted to take her on a fantastic getaway to a beach resort, John was surprised when Blair turned him down. Blair sadly stated that her family was experiencing a crisis and maintained that she couldn't leave town. Realizing that Blair needed to be with her children, John suggested that they save the plane tickets for a trip in the near future. \n\n\nAfter Blair agreed to postpone the trip, John expressed his pleasure and stated that he could go anytime because there wasn't anything holding him in Llanview anymore. Blair wondered if John was still worried about Marty. John admitted to feeling terrible about what had taken place at the hearing, but promised Blair that she was the woman that he had on his mind. Blair responded by giving John a passionate kiss. John asked her to go out with him on New Year's Eve. When Blair asked where they were going, John refused to tell her and stated that it was a surprise. \n\n\nAt The Buenos Dias Caf\u00e9, Viki, Charlie, Moe, and Noelle were flabbergasted to find David Vickers dressed in a robe and behaving rather strangely. To their surprise, David announced that he had transformed and had taken the name of David Vickeroshi. Everyone listened intently as David explained his spiritual awakening. After losing Addie and being banished from Llanview, David recalled how depressed he was to be left without a home, family, friends, or money. Shortly after departing Llanview, David had gone through a near-death experience on a plane ride. During the encounter, David met a gentle man. David was impressed with the strong spiritual presence of his new friend and accompanied him home. After learning the spiritual customs of the man and his followers, David realized that he could be happy living a meager life. \n\n\nBeing familiar with David's character, Viki was skeptical of his claim that he had changed. Assuring Viki that he no longer had any interest in financial gain, David stated that he wanted to live a simple life. When Viki questioned why David had returned to Llanview, David revealed that he needed to atone for the sins he had committed against Viki and Charlie. To Viki and Charlie's surprise, David confessed that he had remained silent concerning a crime that Dorian had committed. David admitted that Dorian had drugged Charlie with the date rape drug, gave him liquor, and held him captive in her bedroom. Enraged, Viki and Charlie stormed out of the caf\u00e9 and headed to La Boulaie to confront Dorian. David vowed to remain in Llanview until he admitted the truth to everyone that he had hurt in the past. \n\n\nBefore leaving the caf\u00e9, David stopped in the kitchen to say goodbye to Moe and Noelle. Afterward, Moe questioned just how generous David would be if he had something valuable to lose. \n\n\nAt the Buchanan Mansion, Bo, Clint, Nora, Renee, and Nigel listened as Asa's lawyer, Beaver Calhoun, played a videotaped message of Asa. Beaver told the family that Asa had prepared a tape for every possible outcome. In the video tape, a gruff Asa reminded the family of the deadline he had given them to raise the Buchanan Enterprise stock and the consequences that would occur if they didn't. Admonishing them for failing to rise to the challenge, Asa informed them that due to their disobedience, they had lost everything. While everyone appeared shocked and frightened, Bo laughed and showed no fear. \n\n\nContinuing to chastise his kin, Asa ordered Nora to move out of the mansion, advised Bo to start accepting a salary with the Llanview Police Department, and suggested that Clint rekindle his relationship with Viki, since she was loaded. Asa criticized his family for being incapable of handling the family business. He shocked everyone when he revealed that he was leaving his entire fortune to the son that he had never recognized -- David Vickers. Acknowledging that David was a conman and would spend the inheritance overnight, Asa challenged the Buchanans to outsmart and outwit David out of his endowment. \n\n\nWhen Bo suggested that the family prepare to pack, Clint assured him that the Buchanans weren't going anywhere. Determined to trick David out of the inheritance, Clint warned the family to remain silent concerning Asa's orders until he came up with a solution. Clint was certain that they would be able to keep David's paternity a secret because no one other than family members was aware of the information. To Clint's displeasure, Nigel pulled him aside and revealed that two other persons were privy to the revelation that David was Asa's illegitimate son - Max and Alex Olanov. Nigel assured Clint that Max would remain silent and mentioned that he had bribed Alex to keep quiet by giving her Asa's Island, St. Blazes. When Clint showed concern, Nigel told him that Alex was on the St. Blazes Island and that no one in the family would ever encounter her. Meanwhile, Bo was certain that David was nowhere in the vicinity of Llanview. He headed to the station to run a check on him. \n\n\nAt Ultraviolet, Gigi surprised Rex when she unveiled a poster board announcing that the Puddle of Mudd rock band would be performing a New Year's Eve bash at Ultraviolet. Gigi informed Rex that she had enlisted Sarah's help to schedule the group to perform. Pleased, Rex thanked Gigi for her help and the two happily planned for the special night. \n\n\nOutside the club, Markko and Cole stood in line to purchase tickets to see the Puddle of Mudd perform. Cole insisted that he didn't want to go out on New Year's Eve, but Markko pleaded with him to reconsider. Markko planned to invite Langston and wanted Cole and Starr to join them. When Markko suggested that Cole needed a little excitement in his life, Cole maintained that he had experienced enough excitement over the past year. Markko questioned Cole's relationship with Starr. Cole insisted that they were just friends, but Markko wondered how Cole would react if Starr became involved with someone else. \n\n\nWhen Markko phoned Langston and shared the news that he had purchased tickets for the concert, Dorian overheard Langston tell him that she couldn't go because she had already made plans. Afterward, Dorian instructed Langston to spend New Year's Eve with her friends, and assured her that they could go to New York after the holidays. Langston thanked Dorian and ran off to meet Markko. \n\n\nMoments later, Viki and Charlie arrived at La Boulaie and demanded answers from Dorian. When Viki accused Dorian of drugging Charlie and then supplying him with liquor, a smug Dorian denied any involvement and ordered them to leave her home. Before leaving, Viki warned Dorian that she would return with Bo. Showing no sign of nervousness, Dorian responded by slamming the door. \n\n\nAs Blair stood nearby, Dorian rushed into the kitchen and reached for her phone directory. When Blair inquired about what had upset her, a flustered Dorian stated that she needed to get in touch with her lawyer, and insisted that she wasn't going to jail. Stating that she wanted no involvement in Dorian's latest caper, Blair said Dorian was on her own and walked away. Dorian phoned a travel agency and requested a reservation on the next flight out of Llanview. Noticing the tickets that John had given Blair on the kitchen counter, Dorian came up with an idea. She would use Blair's tickets and travel to St. Blazes Island Resort. A short time later, Dorian had packed and was in possession of her passport. Exiting La Boulaie with the plane tickets in hand, Dorian called out to her driver. \n\n\nLangston showed up at Ultraviolet to meet Markko. She informed him that she would join him at the concert. After telling Markko of the adoption, Langston jokingly told Markko that he had better treat her right or else he would have to deal with her \"new Mama.\" A look of concern showed on Markko's face.\n\n\n",
    "tvmega_recap": "Asa's lawyer pays his family a surprise visit and shows them a video where Asa declares that Nora, Clint, Bo and Nigel have all failed to do what he expected of them for the inheritance he willed to them. So he is going to give it all to David Vickers. Hopefully, it will motivate them all to smarten up and correct their mistakes, he tells them. Dorian is ready to \"seal the deal\" to adopt Langston and makes plans to take her foster daughter to New York and celebrate New Year's. But, she accepts the fact that Langston wants to see Puddle of Mudd in concert at Ultraviolet with Markko and lets her go. David Vickers appears out of nowhere and confesses to Charlie and Viki that he happens to know that Dorian drugged Charlie and that is the reason why he wound up drunk in an alley a while ago and had no clue how it happened. At that point, Charlie and Viki go to confront Dorian and tell her they are going to report her to Bo. Blair finds her out aunt is in trouble and declares that she will wash her hands of Dorian's problems. At that point, when Dorian is alone, she books a flight to flee Llanview.
