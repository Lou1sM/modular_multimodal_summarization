    "soap_central": "\n What Are You Doing New Year's Eve? \n\n\nRoxy nabbed Schuyler as he left the Angel Square Hotel after retrieving some clothing from his room. She reminded him that she had kicked him out, and called him a home wrecker. She wanted him to stay away and advised him that she had given up his room to someone else. Schuyler was confused, noting that his room was the same as the way he left it. Gruffly, she asked him where he was going and told him he was a snake who cheated, lied, and stole to get what he wanted.\n\n\nDown the hall, Oliver was ready to hit the town with Kyle who reluctantly advised his boyfriend that he wouldn't be able to go out because he needed to stay behind to keep an eye on Nick. They headed into Kyle's room as an unhappy Oliver attempted to get Kyle to change his mind. He was sure that Nick would be fine. Nick lay in the bed with his ear buds in his ears, presumably listening to his music. Kyle was worried that Nick might need him. Oliver was suspicious and even more so when Roxy arrived and wanted to know why Nick was still there. She reminded Kyle that she had called him and told him about the freed up room for Nick.\n\n\nKyle denied receiving the phone call and imagined that Roxy had it wrong and was confused. After she left, Oliver suggested that someone else had answered Kyle's phone. Pulling the ear buds from his ears, Nick spoke up and denied that Roxy had called. Oliver thought that they should move Nick to the other room right away, and offered to start packing up his things. Nick groaned in pain as Kyle helped him from the bed. \"He's working you,\" Oliver insisted to Kyle who accused Oliver of acting like a cop since he always seemed suspicious of everyone.\n\n\nOliver also refused to believe that Amelia had turned down Nick's request for help and thought that Nick hadn't really called her. He thought that Nick was trying to win Kyle back. Oliver and Kyle began to argue until Kyle emphasized that he and Nick wouldn't have been together in the first place if Oliver hadn't been so afraid of \"coming out of the closet.\" Oliver left hurriedly, his feelings hurt.\n\n\nMatthew confronted Bo in their hotel room, and advised his father that he knew why they were staying at the Palace. The father and son had a heart-to-heart discussion about Bo and Nora being back together. Matthew felt bad for his uncle Clint, but Bo pointed out that Matthew had nothing to do with what had happened. Bo was thrilled that he, Matthew, and Nora would finally be together as a family. He was equally thrilled that Matthew was walking with the use of a cane. Matthew wondered what would happen to Danielle since she was in his family's care.\n\n\nDanielle arrived to pick up Matthew for the party at Ultraviolet. As she waited, she watched closely as Bo picked up his gun, hit the code on the hotel safe and placed the gun safely inside of it. As Bo headed out the door to the Mayor's Ball, Danielle admitted that suddenly she wasn't in the mood for a party. She urged Matthew to go without her and when they left the room, she left the door slightly ajar. She bid farewell to Matthew at the elevator and slipped back into the room. Entering the code on the safe, she successfully opened the door and removed Bo's gun.\n\n\nNora stopped by T\u00e9a's room to let her know that Matthew and Danielle were going to Ultraviolet for the evening. She assured T\u00e9a that Rex had promised to keep his eye on them. She felt that Danielle needed to be distracted. T\u00e9a admitted that she knew about Bo and Nora being together but assured Nora that she hadn't heard people talking about them. Nora declared that Dorian had persuaded her and Bo to attend the ball. and she was relieved that Clint wouldn't be there.\n\n\nT\u00e9a made sure that Nora was aware that she wasn't with Todd and that he had merely invited her to his house for the holiday. Upon further questioning from Nora, T\u00e9a disclosed that she still loved Todd. Nora pointed out that Danielle had been through a lot and she was afraid that Danielle would refuse to see her mother if T\u00e9a was with Todd.\n\n\nAt the Mayor's Ball, Dorian and Clint anxiously awaited  Nora and Bo's arrival. Clint was curious as to why Dorian wanted to fire Bo, but she was elusive. She couldn't believe they were both on the same side and solo for the evening. He greeted Kim with a kiss on the cheek when she arrived. Graciously, Clint introduced the two women to each other, and advised Dorian that Kim was his executive assistant. He advised Dorian that his hands were clean and that the reporters in attendance had been given \"pertinent information.\"\n\n\nStarr and Cole said goodbye to Blair as they headed out for a night at Ultraviolet. Blair was happy to stay home to babysit for her granddaughter and invited Todd to keep her company after he finished saying goodnight to Sam and Jack. She thought it would be fun to keep watch over Hope together. They spoke about Danielle, and Todd admitted that he would probably never tell the teen that he was her father since she hated him so much. Blair was curious about T\u00e9a spending Christmas with Todd and the boys. Shrugging, Todd disclosed that he felt bad  for T\u00e9a being alone. Blair wanted to know if Todd still loved T\u00e9a.\n\n\nHe reminded her that T\u00e9a had lied about their daughter, but she quickly asked him if he had ever lied. Blair acknowledged that she had done everything she could to win Todd back but she was finished. That was the reason that she had sent him to Seattle to see T\u00e9a. She again wondered about Todd's feelings for T\u00e9a. As Todd relented and admitted that he still loved T\u00e9a, Danielle showed up and watched from the patio doors, gun in hand.\n\n\n\n\nClarifying his statement, Todd stressed that he both loved and hated T\u00e9a. Offering some unsolicited advice, Blair advised him that he and T\u00e9a were both suffering and she urged him to forgive T\u00e9a and let things go. She thought that Danielle might start to heal if both Todd and T\u00e9a were able to do so. As she went upstairs to check on Hope, Blair urged Todd to visit T\u00e9a. Danielle burst through the patio doors with the gun pointed at Todd. She informed him that she wanted to kill him because he had killed her father.\n\n\nGigi nervously prepared for her evening with Schuyler at Viki's cabin. \"I can't do this,\" she blurted out as she blew out the candles she had lit. She turned on the light and hastily covered herself up with an oversized sweatshirt. She greeted Schuyler at the door with some hesitation. Shyly, he admitted that he had equipped himself with the ingredients for Gigi's drink of choice, food he had prepared, and a music mix of Gigi's favorite songs. He was confused by Gigi's demeanor, though, and thought she looked like she just wanted to watch the ball drop.\n\n\nGigi admitted that she had a confession and explained that she had lit \"millions\" of candles and was actually wearing a dress that was probably illegal in many states. She felt like a fraud because she had never been with anyone but Rex and she didn't know how to behave. Schuyler assured her that they would take it slowly. They shared a slow dance. Schuyler admitted that he didn't tell Gigi he was kicked out of the hotel because he didn't want Gigi to feel obligated to ask him to stay. She surprised him and asked him to spend the night with her.\n\n\nRex prepared Ultraviolet for the all-ages New Year's Eve party and advised his bartender that Gigi would not be there. Stacy arrived and shouted at Shaun and Destiny for bumping into her and spilling a drink. Shaun disclosed to his sist er that  Dorian had  hired him to watch over Starr and Langston without their knowing it.\n\n\nMarkko asked Langston why she had mentioned Ford at her mother's house previously. Langston promised Markko that he was her one true love and referred to Ford as simply a distraction. She was not unhappy when Ford turned up at the club. Cole and Starr spoke of the ups and downs they had shared during the year before and Cole promised that things would be better. They were ecstatic when they saw Matthew walk through the door on his own. Destiny was thrilled to see that he arrived alone. Starr hugged Matthew who cut Cole off when he started to mention the accident. Matthew assured his old friend it was just a memory as he gave him a hug.\n\n\nRex demanded to know what Stacy was doing at his club. He also asked about the paternity test because he had been excited to feel the baby kick. He wanted the truth and wanted to know if her baby was really his. Just then, Oliver arrived alone. Stacy swore that the baby was Rex's. \"I wish this was your baby,\" she whispered in Rex's direction as he walked away.\n\n\nDestiny chatted with Matthew and confessed that she had something to tell him. Gathering her courage, she told him that she loved him. Matthew's eyes widened in surprise.\n\n\nAfter Nora had gone, T\u00e9a was surprised to find Elijah on the other side of her door, dressed in a tuxedo and holding a bottle. He asked her to spend New Year's Eve with him and mentioned that he had an extra ticket to the mayor's ball. At first she declined but relented when Elijah assured her she'd have fun. He offered a toast for a good year.\n\n\nClint was happy to see Nora and Bo arrive. \"Let the good times roll,\" he muttered to Dorian who headed to the podium. She welcomed everyone to the ball and talked about the accountability and strong ethics that her office stood for. She stressed the importance of fairness and righteousness and pointed out that no one had more integrity than Bo and Nora as her police commissioner and district attorney. She called them up to the podium and cited their honesty and trustworthiness. One of the members of the press called out and asked about the rumors and suddenly, one by one, the reporters shouted out questions about the couple having an affair and living together. Clint smirked as the planted information was revealed.\n\n\nPretending to be surprised, Dorian turned to the accused couple. Awkwardly, Bo stressed that he and Nora had separate rooms while Nora admitted that she had left her husband. They denied having an affair. Someone handed Dorian the photo of the couple sharing a kiss on the night before Nora's wedding.\n\n\nNearby, Kim, acting on behalf of Clint, told a reporter that Clint was sorry but he had no control over the situation. He only wanted happiness for Bo and Nora. Out of the public eye, Nora and Bo agreed that Clint had set them up, though they wondered what was in it for Dorian. The mayor, appearing to be in shock, announced that she was a mayor of action. She made it clear that she had zero tolerance for anyone who would undermine her office's integrity. As she looked at the Cramer family photo with the crossed out faces, she fired Bo.\n\n\nKyle apologized to Nick for Oliver's behavior as Nick sat beside him and massaged the tension in Kyle's back. He leaned in and kissed Kyle soundly.\n\n\n",

Bo and Nora are happy about that and with each other but worried what Clint might be up to Meanwhile, Clint and Dorian work on their dastardly plan. They invite Bo and Nora to Dorian's mayoral ball and they secretly invite hecklers who reveal that Bo and Nora are secretly having an affair. And Dorian tells the crowd that she has no alternative except to fire them both. Dani stays at home, finds Bo's gun and goes after Todd. Gigi admits that she wants to be with Schuyler. Rex demands to know if Stacy is really having his baby. Fish tells Kyle that he wants Nick to move into the other empty room that Roxy offered him and urges Kyle to know that Nick is playing him because he wants Kyle. Kyle argues and reveals to Fish that maybe Nick is the person for him instead of Fish.",
