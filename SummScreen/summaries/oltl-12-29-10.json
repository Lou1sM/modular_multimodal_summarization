    "soap_central": "\n\nAt the Palace Hotel, New Year's Eve was drawing near, but Aubrey was once again on her phone, exchanging furtive words with her mystery caller.  She told the person on the other end that she hadn't been able to snatch up all the copies of Maintenant in town, and said someone in Llanview had to have it, but she was sure it was no one Joey knew.  She told the caller she was convinced Joey would never see it.\n\n\n\"See what?\" Joey asked, emerging from the bathroom in a towel.  Aubrey quickly hung up and told him she had been on the phone with her designer, and didn't want him to see her wedding dress before they got married.  Putting the moves on her fianc\u00e9, she suggested they spend New Year's Eve in bed, but was deflated when Joey told her he had plans for them to meet Kelly at Capricorn.  Joey insisted that he wanted to show his beautiful bride-to-be off to all of Llanview.\n\n\nBrody and John arrived at the courthouse to prepare for John and Natalie's shotgun wedding, undeterred despite their detour to stop a bank heist.  As always, John's mind was on his work and the Ford case, and he admitted that he wasn't sure what to think or do as his date at the altar approached.  Brody comforted the uncharacteristically nervous McBain, and told his lieutenant that everything would turn out great.  John was sure Brody was right, but said he couldn't help but think something would happen to take it all away.\n\n\nJohn reflected on how far Brody had traveled from being a rookie cop to his best man, standing up for him at his wedding.  Brody said they had gone a long way together, and soon would be in-laws and fathers.  Brody had always seen being a dad on the horizon, but John begged to differ.  \"I didn't know until I was one,\" he murmured. \"But I couldn't want it more.\"\n\n\nOver at Llanfair, Natalie was putting the finishing touches on her wedding attire in the drawing room as Jessica entered, confirming that Brody and John were at the courthouse.  The sisters embraced as Marty spied on them from the patio doors.  Jessica told Natalie not to be nervous -- after all, \"what could possibly go wrong?\"\n\n\nGigi and Rex arrived in their New Year's party dress, demanding to know if the wedding news they had heard from Viki and Charlie was true.  Natalie confirmed that she and John were tying the knot in a simple ceremony, and Gigi and Rex gave her their best wishes.  As Jessica headed upstairs, Natalie and the Balsoms spoke in hushed tones about the Marty situation.  Marty eavesdropped as Natalie told them she had to trust in Marty's promise not to tell John the truth about her baby's father.  Smirking, Marty muttered to herself that she hadn't said anything about not telling Jessica.\n\n\nAs Gigi moved to close the patio doors, Marty hid in the bushes.  Meanwhile, Rex congratulated Natalie on her wedding, and told her not to let her secret stop her from being happy and making a family with John.  The honorary siblings embraced, and Natalie ushered Gigi and Rex out of the house, promising them plenty of pictures.\n\n\nAs Gigi and Rex left, Jessica returned with a present for Natalie, a beautiful sapphire necklace, which Asa had given to Jessica for her sixteenth birthday.  Natalie was touched as Jessica explained that the necklace covered all Natalie's bridal bases -- it was old because it was from Asa, it was new to Natalie, it might someday be borrowed by Natalie's daughter if she were to have one, and it was blue.  Jess said that she had many gifts from Asa, but Natalie had not been able to grow up in the Buchanan fold, and Jessica had wanted to let Natalie know how grateful Jessica was to have such a wonderful sister.\n\n\nAt La Boulaie, a giddy Langston snapped multiple pictures of herself and Starr in \"2011\" party glasses, but nothing seemed to rouse Starr from her depression.  Starr urged Langston to spend the night out with Ford instead of babysitting her, but Langston was determined to be a good friend.  Starr said she had thought of calling James in order to give Langston and Ford time together, but admitted that she didn't trust herself to be alone with James.\n\n\nBefore Langston could question Starr about her feelings for James, Starr shifted the topic back to Ford.  Langston said that she was almost grateful to be away from him -- she feared the New Year's atmosphere would create irresistible sexual tension for her and Ford, and she refused to give in to the heat between them until she could be sure he wouldn't hurt her again.  Starr suggested Langston and Ford go for it, and reminded her friend that they had no idea when their happiness could be taken away.  She added that she hoped Danielle and Nate wouldn't have to suffer the way she and Cole had.\n\n\nOver at Capricorn, James was urging Bobby Ford to spend New Year's Eve with Langston instead of him, but Ford refused to abandon his little brother any more than Langston would abandon Starr.  He told James to cheer up and celebrate the idea of a 2011 sans Eddie Ford.  The brothers drank to the thought, but James remained morose, thinking of Nate locked away behind bars.  He wanted to see their kid brother, and thank Nate for ridding the world of Eddie.  \"God, you are one drag of a date,\" Ford muttered.\n\n\nAt the police station, Nate languished in his jail cell, staring at the Sun headline about his arrest.  His reverie was interrupted by the surprise arrival of Danielle.  Nate was upset, as he had told Dani he didn't want her to visit him, and said she should be spending her New Year's Eve at the party in Angel Square.  Dani said T\u00e9a had pulled some strings to get her in to see him, and told Nate that as long as he was in custody, she wanted to spend her holiday with him.\n\n\nNate warned Dani that he didn't want to discuss his arrest or the charges against him.  As he reminded her of the mountain of evidence that had been gathered to incriminate him in Eddie's murder, Dani noted that Nate had yet to admit his guilt.  \"Look me in the eyes and tell me what you did,\" she challenged him.  \"What we have here is a failure to communicate,\" Nate murmured, quoting Cool Hand Luke, and repeated his wish that Dani go and leave him to his lonely New Year's Eve.\n\n\nJust then, Starr and Langston arrived, bearing noisemakers and good cheer, having gained access to the cellblock courtesy of Dorian's handy mayoral intervention.  The girls told Nate and Dani that they were there to cheer them up, and Starr added that she knew what the young lovers were going through.  Suddenly, James and Ford arrived, and the six youngsters exchanged season's greetings as Starr and James shared a private glance.\n\n\nTaking Dani aside, Starr and Langston asked her about Nate's chances in court, but Dani had no clue what was in store for her beau.  Meanwhile, the Ford brothers commiserated by the prison bars.  James asked Nate how the lost gun had gotten back to the Salinger house, but Nate told the guys that T\u00e9a had ordered him not to discuss the case with anyone.  Bobby and James were eager to help Nate, but Nate said there was only one thing they could do for him -- take Dani to Angel Square.\n\n\nCalling to Starr, Nate reiterated his wish for Dani to make herself scarce, and asked Starr and the others to help the junior Ms. Manning have a fun New Year's Eve.  Dani was reluctant, and asked how Starr had handled losing Cole in a similar situation.  Starr said she had the support of family, friends, and sisters like Dani and Langston -- she understood why Nate didn't want Dani locked away with him for the night, just as Cole hadn't wanted her to stop her life when he had gone to Statesville.  \"He wants me to go on without him,\" Starr said softly, and said she knew Dani didn't want to, but said that her little sister had to do it for Nate, just as Starr had to do it for Cole.\n\n\nAt Capricorn, Blair was busy playing hostess, having dragged Kelly to the club in the hopes of giving her lovelorn cousin a rocking New Year's Eve.  She urged Kelly to make a New Year's resolution to stop moping over Joey.  \"If you got lemon in your eye,\" Blair counseled, \"then you better make some lemonade!\"  Just then, Cristian stormed over to the bar and snatched Blair's copy of Maintenant Magazine out of her hands, eager to show her the paparazzi picture of Layla and Steffen in Paris.  Cristian was crushed by what he believed was Layla's betrayal of their love, and didn't agree when Blair suggested there might be another explanation for the photo.\n\n\nAs Cristian stalked off across the club with Blair on his tail, Kelly took a look at the magazine.  Just then, Joey and Aubrey arrived.  Joey cracked a joke about Kelly wasting her New Year's Eve reading in the dark, while Aubrey went white at the sight of the infamous fashion magazine.\n\n\nMarty arrived at the other end of the bar and ordered a glass of Capricorn's most expensive champagne.  She told the bartender there was no need to run a tab, as she wouldn't be there long.\n\n\nGigi and Rex entered the club, taking judicious notice of Marty at the bar.  Gigi admitted that Marty had grown frightening since beginning of her campaign of terror against Natalie, while Rex kept one eye trained on his sister's nemesis.\n\n\nBack at the bar, Joey grabbed the fashion magazine, looking for the picture Cristian had shown him, but Aubrey quickly said she had no interest in the local gossip, and Joey relented, tossing the magazine onto the bar.  As Joey ordered drinks, Aubrey saw an opening and promptly faked a fainting spell, falling into his arms and snatching the magazine.  As Kelly and Joey worried over her, Aubrey played off her sudden faint, claiming she had caught a bug from the florist.  She insisted on going back to the Palace and sleeping it off, but urged the duo to stay and enjoy their New Year's Eve, while she crawled into bed with Maintenant.  Kelly asked to keep the magazine, but relented under Joey's request to let Aubrey have it.\n\n\nAs Joey escorted Aubrey out of the club, Rex walked over to Kelly and asked her what was up.  Kelly admitted that she was suspicious of Aubrey's sudden illness, and Rex asked her if she knew what Aubrey didn't want Joey to see.  Stumped, Kelly had no answer.\n\n\nJoey returned to Kelly's side, and made a confession -- Aubrey was indeed jealous of Kelly.  Kelly couldn't imagine why, and Joey agreed, noting that Kelly was with Kevin again.  Gazing at his ex-wife, Joey asked Kelly what Aubrey could possibly have to worry about.\n\n\nAt the other end of the club, Cristian told Blair his troubles.  He had wanted to head to Paris and talk things out with Layla, but she had informed him that she and Steffen were staying at a royal vineyard in the South of France, supposedly on business.  He didn't know if Layla and Steffen were having an affair, but he knew his lady love was being sucked into a whole new world that had nothing to do with him, or what he could give her.  He and Blair began to banter about their own employer/employee relationship, and how they kept things professional despite their romantic history -- while Layla might be with Steffen because of her ambition, Cristian and Blair had only been together out of desire.  Curbing Cristian's amorous thoughts, Blair warned him not to \"go kissin' on anybody\" until he figured things out with Layla.\n\n\nBack at the courthouse, Brody and John waited in an empty courtroom for the other half of the wedding party.  Brody got a call from Jessica confirming her and Natalie's arrival, but warned John not to see the bride before the wedding.  John laughed off the superstition, and told Brody that Natalie was probably arguing the point with Jessica as he spoke.  She was tempestuous and impulsive -- \"I wouldn't have her any other way.\"\n\n\nSure enough, Natalie and Jessica were arguing about the very same superstition nearby.  Natalie agreed to wait for the ceremony to see John, as Jessica headed into the courtroom and took a picture of Brody pinning a corsage to John's coat.  She told them Natalie would be there at any moment.\n\n\nJudge Runyeon arrived outside the courtroom and met Natalie, mistaking her for the maid of honor.  When he learned she was the bride, he hid his surprise at her delicate condition and said he hadn't known how beautiful John McBain's betrothed was.  He escorted Natalie into the courtroom on his arm, urging her to forget the silly wedding day superstitions.  Natalie and Judge Runyeon entered the courtroom just as Jessica took a photo of Brody and John.  As Natalie beamed at John, Jessica whispered to Brody that she wished Natalie hadn't tempted fate.\n\n\nJohn and Natalie took Judge Runyeon into the hall and thanked him for officiating at their ceremony.  The judge joked that John had always been a worthy opponent, and said he was relieved to get a call from a happy Lieutenant McBain.  He asked Natalie to see that John thought twice before calling him in the middle of the night to once again bend the rules, and Natalie said that soon John would be too busy with their baby.\n\n\nAs they returned to the courtroom, Natalie and John were stunned to see candles adorning the chamber, and Jessica told them that she and Brody had whipped up the best wedding possible on short notice.  Judge Runyeon warned the wedding party that they needed to hurry before one of the sisters' new children decided to be the first baby of 2011.  Taking the cue, John and Natalie joined hands as Judge Runyeon began the ceremony.\n\n\nBack at Capricorn, Cristian took the stage and welcomed the crowd to their New Year's Eve bash, then introduced Blair, who began to sing a romantic ballad.  As she sang, Cristian gazed mournfully at his phone.  Meanwhile, the teens frolicked in Angel Square as Danielle sat alone, thinking of Nate, who lay in his jail cell with a leftover noisemaker.  As Langston, Ford, James, and Starr continued to party, Danielle left Angel Square.  Aubrey returned to her hotel suite and opened up the fashion magazine, staring at the picture of herself in the arms of an attractive man, while at Capricorn, Joey handed Kelly a drink, and shared a smile with her as their fingers touched\n\n\nAs Blair finished her song, Marty downed the last of her champagne and stalked out of Capricorn.  Rex noticed the empty spot at the bar as Gigi told him that Natalie and John would be wed at any moment.  Just then, Kelly rushed over to the couple.  \"It was the magazine!\" she told Rex, realizing what Aubrey had been so eager to hide from Joey.  Before they could speak further, Gigi dragged Rex away to the stage to prepare for the countdown to the new year.\n\n\nAt the Palace, Aubrey tore the incriminating page out of Maintenant Magazine and hid it under a couch cushion.  Just then, there was a knock at the door.  Aubrey opened it to find the mystery man from the photo smiling at her.\n\n\nIn Angel Square, Ford took Langston in his arms.  He warned her that if they weren't going to have sex for months yet, he intended to make their New Year's kiss last.\n\n\nNearby, Starr and James bemoaned Dani's exit, but understood her need to be with Nate.  James told Starr he was glad she hadn't left, as well, and Starr smiled at him.\n\n\nNate was surprised when Dani returned to the cellblock to be by his side.  She told him she didn't care if he wanted her to leave, because she wanted to be there, with him.  Nate was struck by her devotion.\n\n\nAt the courthouse, John and Natalie exchanged vows as Brody and Jessica looked on.  John slipped a wedding band onto Natalie's finger as the countdown to 2011 began.\n\n\nIn Angel Square, Ford, Langston, James, and Starr rang in the New Year amidst the crowd as \"Auld Lang Syne\" began to play.  Ford and Langston kissed passionately, and across town, Nate and Danielle did the same, despite the prison bars that separated them.  At the Palace, Aubrey and her mystery man exchanged conspiratorial grins and dove onto the couch to make love.  At Capricorn, Kelly and Joey watched Gigi and Rex kiss and shared a tense hug instead, while Blair and Cris surprised each other with a wild smooch.  Back at Angel Square, Starr and James watched the fireworks cascade across the sky, and finally, tentatively kissed.\n\n\nBack at the courthouse, Natalie slipped a wedding band onto John's finger as the fireworks flashed in the sky.  As Judge Runyeon prepared to pronounce John and Natalie husband and wife, Marty raced into the courtroom.  \"Stop!\" she cried. \"Stop this wedding!\" \n\n\n",
