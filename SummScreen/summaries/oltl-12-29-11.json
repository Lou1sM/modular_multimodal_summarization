    "tvmega_recap": "Gigi and Shane go to the station to clarify that the murder charges for Jack will obviously be a bit different now that she's obviously not dead. Tea then tells John she is confident that the cops and prosecutors have nothing on Jack. But John tells her not to be so certain of that. Gigi then reveals herself alive and well to Viki, Natalie, Clint and all her friends. Todd is furious to find out that Neela set his son up to get charged with murder. And right then, he realizes that Tea must have been talking to John who's convinced her that he killed Victor and kidnapped Tomas. And that's why she's being hostile to him. Tea goes to inform Todd and Blair that Gigi is alive so obviously that is \"good news\" for Jack as he can't exactly get charged with murder. Cutter informs Kim when he calls her from jail that her best friend, Stacy, unfortunately died in the basement instead of Gigi. She is devastated until he tells her that he has a plan for both of them. They can take everything they are due from their long lost rich mother if she can bust him out of jail. Right then, Rex and Gigi decide they will waste no more time in getting married and arrange it right away."
