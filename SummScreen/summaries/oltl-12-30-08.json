    "soap_central": "\nShould Old Acquaintance Be Forgot\n\n\nAt the Buchanan mansion, Marty hid her \"Todd files\" beneath her bedsheets when Cole came to her door to say goodnight. Cole invited her to Ultra Violet to see Puddle Of Mudd, but Marty begged off, claiming she planned to stay in and go to bed early. After Cole left, she stripped off her bathrobe, revealing sexy black eveningwear. \n\n\nT\u00e9a arrived at Todd's, buzzed and carrying champagne. Surprised to see Todd in a tux, she asked him where he was headed. Todd snatched her champagne and told her he wasn't going to wallow in his misery, or spend New Year's Eve with her -- he had \"plans.\" T\u00e9a wanted to know what Todd was up to, but Todd kept mum. \n\n\nSuddenly, Marty called Todd, asking if they were still going to meet. Todd promised her he'd come to meet her, without letting on to T\u00e9a who he was speaking with. Marty pleaded with Todd not to tell anyone about their secret rendezvous, and said that her friends and family wouldn't understand. Todd told Marty it was their secret, but when he hung up, T\u00e9a had already figured the whole thing out. \n\n\nT\u00e9a told Todd he couldn't meet with Marty, and insisted it was a trap. She told Todd that Marty wanted to incriminate him and help Nora's case. Todd refused to listen to T\u00e9a's suspicions, and told her to stay out of it. \"This is way too easy,\" she said. \"She's using your feelings for her against you!\" T\u00e9a harangued Todd, trying to make him change his mind, but she was sidetracked when she got a call from Ray on her cell phone. Todd took the opportunity to dart out, leaving T\u00e9a behind to lock up. T\u00e9a screamed after him that she wouldn't be bailing him out again. \n\n\nOn the phone from Colombia, Ray wished T\u00e9a a happy new year, and asked her to get him out of Plato Prison and prove Vanessa's guilt as soon as possible. As she began locking up Todd's house, T\u00e9a reassured Ray that it was only a matter of time before Vanessa let her guard down, since she was \"safe\" and married to Cristian; she said she'd known Cris would help Vanessa, because that was the kind of man he was. She promised Ray that she would soon have what she needed to bust his ex-wife. Ray asked if she was uncomfortable using Cristian to unearth the truth, but T\u00e9a said her manipulations served a higher purpose: Ray's freedom. Ray was upset that they had faked a death threat, making Lola fear him even more; T\u00e9a told him Vanessa had already turned Lola against him, so one fake threat wouldn't have made a difference. As she left Todd's place, T\u00e9a promised Ray that his relationship with Lola was not a \"no-win situation.\" \n\n\nAt Sarah, Talia, and Layla's apartment, the roomies tried to cheer Sarah up, to no avail. Sarah told them she wouldn't be going to Ultra Violet with them, and despaired that she had no one to kiss on New Year's Eve. Just then, Cristian arrived, asking Sarah to accompany him to the club. He told her they could spend a few minutes with Vanessa, then find a secluded spot together to count the hours down. Sarah rebuked Cris, and said it was impossible; she didn't want to sneak off with him, and hated seeing him with his \"wife.\" She reminded him that if anyone from Immigration saw them canoodling, it would be over for Vanessa and Lola. Cristian insisted that he wanted to kiss Sarah at the stroke of midnight, but Sarah stonewalled, and Talia and Layla quickly dragged Cristian away to the club with them, calling him \"Mr. Montez.\" Sarah was left alone in the apartment, disheveled and crying. \n\n\nBlair arrived at Rodi's dressed to the nines, amidst a path of candles and soft music on the jukebox. She found John standing by the bar, dressed in her loud Hawaiian shirt and holding a bottle of wine. Blair asked John if he'd rented the whole bar out for them, but John told her far from it; \"I bought the place.\" Blair was thrown to hear that John had bought Renee out, and John explained that his father had frequented a bar just like Rodi's in Atlantic City for years, with good music and good whiskey. Blair wondered if John's new responsibilities and hers at Capricorn would allow them to make time for each other, and questioned whether or not he was really over being a cop. John said he'd make it as long as he made sure Rodi's stopped serving \"froufrou drinks.\" As they bantered, John invited Blair to make a friendly wager: If he still had Rodi's in six months, she'd come to his club and sing for him, and if he didn't, he'd come to Capricorn and sing for her. Blair accepted his bet, and then the lovers put a tune on the jukebox and began to slow dance. \n\n\nAt Ultra Violet, Gigi and Rex were delighted by the turnout for the Puddle Of Mudd performance, which was sure to help Rex keep the club. They greeted the lead singer, who complimented Gigi for being \"the brains of the operation.\" Rex couldn't help but agree as he swooped his ladylove into his arms. \n\n\nThe teens wandered into the club, sipping non-alcoholic drinks; Langston tried hard to keep the glum Starr's spirits up, and got face time with her BFF by sending Markko away to dance with Lola. As Markko impressed Lola with his \"freaky\" moves, Starr explained to her foster cousin that she wanted to be at home, but knew she'd just end up playing with her brothers there and that wouldn't be any better. Starr said she didn't want to bring Langston's evening down, but Langston begged her to wait for Cole to arrive. Sure enough, Cole showed up in the nick of time to brighten Starr's evening. Starr and Cole shared their sorrows and Cole fretted about his mother, but when he put in a call to the mansion, he was alarmed to learn that Marty was not asleep in her room, but out for the evening. Meanwhile, Langston dashed away to give Starr and Cole \"alone time,\" cutting in on Markko's dance with Lola and steering him away, leaving the young Ms. Montez scowling. \n\n\nCristian arrived at the club and met up with Vanessa, who was concerned to learn he'd paid a visit to Sarah. Vanessa reminded him that if Immigration and Custom Services (ICE) caught on to their sham of a marriage, she and Lola would be in danger. Cris told Vanessa he'd had to see Sarah, who was suffering terribly. Vanessa sympathized, and tenderly told Cristian that he and \"his Sarah\" would be reunited soon. \n\n\nTalia and Layla roamed UV in search of Layla's latest \"blind date,\" who was to be identified by his gaudy choice of beverage. Layla asked Talia to run interference if her date turned out to be a dud. The ladies ran into Antonio, who'd brought a guest from Cherryvale: Officer Fish. In an awkward moment, Fish was revealed to be Layla's date as he hefted a fizzy blue drink. \n\n\nWithout further ado, Rex and Gigi gathered in the center of Ultra Violet and introduced Puddle Of Mudd, who performed a raucous tune as the young people of Llanview cheered them on. Afterwards, Starr and Cole, preoccupied by their curiosity about Marty's whereabouts, made a quick exit. \n\n\nIn a sumptuous suite at the Palace Hotel, Marty examined the front page of the Banner detailing Todd's crimes, just as a knock came on her door. She quickly hid the paper and rose from her table, which was set with dinner for two, then turned on the stereo, which played \"Heart and Soul.\" Then, Marty opened her door, greeting Todd graciously. As Todd entered the suite, Marty told him they had a lot to talk about. She told him she couldn't get \"their song\" out of her head, \"among other things.\" Todd replied that because of her invitation, he also couldn't help but think of a new start. Marty admitted that she'd had several \"new starts,\" and Todd said that was reason enough for him to hope. They drank a toast, smiling lovingly at each other. \n\n\nTodd told Marty that T\u00e9a had believed Marty's invite to be a trap, and Marty urged him to search the room, then flirtatiously suggested he \"frisk [her.]\" Todd told her he trusted her, and knew that her residual feelings for him were difficult to admit. Marty allowed that she was unable to stop thinking of Todd. Todd told her that she'd been in the back of his mind for many years, keeping him from doing \"bad stuff\" sometimes. \"Not all the time,\" Marty said. Todd admitted he'd made many mistakes, but said his New Year's resolution was to put them right. He wasn't sure how he could do that, but Marty had an idea. \"Make me hate you,\" she said, her voice choked with emotion. She asked him to make her remember their twisted past together, and \"make me forget how I fell in love with you.\" As Todd tried to comfort her, Marty told him her emotions were complex; she'd meant what she'd said to him in the hospital, she hated him, but she hadn't been able to lie on the stand about how her feelings for him had developed over their months together. Marty tearfully claimed she was \"relieved\" when the judge had dropped the rape charges against him, \"'cause as much as I hate you, I love you more.\" Marty seemed to become hysterical as she confessed that she still loved Todd, but Todd felt he had all the answers. He asked her again to run away with him, \"pretend the past never happened.\" Marty told him they couldn't do that again, but Todd just smiled and said the plan had \"worked before.\" As Marty touched Todd's face, her hands went to his bandage, which she peeled off. She and Todd were both astonished to find that his scar had disappeared. \n\n\nMarty grew seemingly apprehensive about Todd's plans, and resisted her \"feelings.\" Todd told Marty that they could still have everything they'd wanted, and tried to caress her, but Marty shrank away, fleeing the room in tears. As Todd followed after her, he dropped the remote for the stereo, and \"Heart and Soul\" began to blare into the empty room. \n\n\nThe minutes ticked away as John and Blair slow-danced at Rodi's, and Starr and Cole returned to the Buchanan mansion to find Marty's room empty. When they pulled Marty's sheets back, they found her ream of files on Todd; both teens were disturbed by the sight. \n\n\nAt Ultra Violet, Rex and Gigi stood on the dais amongst the crowd as they began the final countdown to 2009. As the clock reached midnight, the young lovers of Llanview kissed, including Antonio and Talia, and Langston and Markko, whose public display drew a grimace from Lola. Fish motioned to try to kiss Layla, but instead she offered him a chaste toast. Cristian sidled up to Vanessa and gave her a kiss, but was unaware of who was watching. \n\n\nBack at the girls' apartment, Sarah watched the online \"webcast\" from Ultra Violet in tears as she saw Cristian and Vanessa kiss by the bar. Devastated, she moved to another window on her laptop, examining the ICE website and preparing to click on the link marked \"immigration fraud.\" \n\n\nOn the roof of the Palace, Todd followed Marty and asked her to give their \"love\" a second chance. Marty told him that what they'd had was not enough. As New Year's fireworks began to light up the sky across Llanview, Todd told Marty she'd \"changed him,\" and that it didn't matter how; what she'd done for him proved that their being together was not an impossible dream. Todd begged her to be with him, and Marty, seemingly overcome, said, \"Yes!\" \n\n\n",
