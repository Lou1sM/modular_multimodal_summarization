Amy divulges the fact that she was once in love as well. She told how she lost the guy because she didn't have faith in their love. She doesn't want the same thing to happen to Ian. \n\n\nWhen Ian admires Amy's independence, she told him about losing her sight in her teens, and how her other senses have sharpened to compensate for her loss. She wants to prove it to Ian by feeling his face. Using this technique, she claims she can tell that Ian has been hurt badly in the past and is still recovering. Wanting to give Ian a glimpse into her life, Amy ties a blindfold across Ian's eyes then asks him to walk around the room and try to find her. As he does this, Eve comes in interrupting their game.\n\n\nEve discovers how demanding her new job as chief resident can be when she finds it impossible to schedule time with Ian. She is overwhelmed with her new responsibilities and takes her frustration out on Karen. After venting, Eve manages to bring herself under control and apologizes to Karen.\n\n\nEve went in search of Chris Ramsey, and finds him drowning his sorrows at the Recovery Room bar. Eve picks up a glass and dumps the contents onto Chris's head saying, \"Party's over Ramsey, time to sober up!\" She went on to tell him what a great doctor he is and begs him to come back to work. Chris is too busy feeling sorry for himself to give the matter any serious thought. He turns the job offer down. Later, Chris relents and changes his mind. Eve welcomes him back.\n\n\nJamal brought  a distraught Valerie back to his apartment. He feels guilty about the state she is in and tries to comfort her by telling her again how Hope has a better life without them.

When she says she doesn't want to go on living, Jamal holds her and told her he will do whatever it takes to make things up to her. Valerie has an idea. She asks Jamal to make another baby with her.\n\n\nAt the park, Alison told Rafe she's sick of him acting like an angel all the time. She told him, \"Put away your damn halo!\" She dares him to say something shocking. When Rafe remains silent, Alison takes his journal knowing that will give her some insight into his true thoughts. Rafe lunges for the journal, twisting his ankle in the process. As he lies on the ground, Alison asks him to tell her what he wants more than anything in the world. \"To kiss you.\" Rafe whispers. \n\n\n",
