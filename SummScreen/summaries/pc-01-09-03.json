Lucy again blasts Kevin for his cold-hearted attitude toward Tess's 'accidental' fall into the water.  Lucy finally announces that, IF Kevin continues to refuse to return to the Hospital for further treatment, Lucy will leave him.  Kevin accuses Lucy of plotting all along to leave with Ian and calls Lucy an unfeeling, spiteful bitch.  As they argue, Lucy tearfully grabs her bags and walks out.\n\n\nAt Stephen's apartment, Elizabeth tries to convince Ian to continue drinking Stephen's water but Ian refuses, explaining that he can NOT keep his mind on his work or his son while he is dependent on Stephen's water.  Elizabeth finally scratches her wrist and urges Ian to let Elizabeth satisfy Ian's needs.\n\n\nAs Jack hurries through the Park, making wedding plans, he hears a woman scream and discovers Reese, with her foot wedged in the root of a fallen tree.  Jack works to free Reese and she then begs him to stay with her until her leg is strong enough for her to stand on it.\n\n\nIn the meantime, Tess is shocked to find Caleb at Jack's Place.  Tess told Caleb that she is marrying Jack that evening and that Caleb must leave.  However, Caleb announces that there will be NO wedding that evening and Caleb begs Tess to let him talk to Livvie, but Tess refuses.  Caleb told Tess that, if she would just let Caleb speak to Livvie for a few minutes, Caleb could make them into two separate individuals again and Tess could enjoy her happy life with Jack while Livvie would be free to reunite with Caleb.  But Tess insists that Caleb's love is NOT good for Livvie and that Livvie needs to stay hidden so she will  be protected from Caleb's way of life.  When Tess runs out of the house to get away from Caleb, he suddenly appears in front of her.  When Tess runs back inside the house to escape Caleb, Caleb appears in front of her inside the house.  Caleb warns Tess that, one day, Olivia's desire to be with Caleb will make Livvie too strong for Tess to continue to keep her hidden.  Caleb makes his guitar magically appear and begins to sing a new song for Livvie, called Surrender, calling Livvie to reappear to Caleb.  \n\n\nAfter Lucy walks out of the Light House, Kevin reassures himself that she will be back eventually because she has ALWAYS come back in the past.  But, in the meantime, Kevin told himself that guilt is too boring for Kevin to mess around with any longer.\n\n\nAt the same time that Elizabeth has almost succeeded in convincing Ian that no one will ever know if they satisfy each other's desires, Lucy arrives at Rafe's loft with her bags.  When Lucy sets her bags down, one of them hits Rafe's remote and Lucy suddenly sees Ian and Elizabeth kissing through Rafe's hidden cameras.\n\n\nAs Caleb strums his guitar and sings to Livvie, Tess suddenly touches Caleb's lips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
