So Lucy phones in a false fire alarm and Stephen's apartment sprinklers automatically turn on, cooling even Elizabeth's ardor!  Later, Lucy casually stops by the apartment and pretends that she just happened to be in the neighborhood when she saw the fire trucks and decided to see if everyone was OK.\n\n\nIn the Park, Reese accidentally calls Jack by his name and Jack suddenly recognizes her as a member of Caleb's band.  Even though Reese protests that she knows no one named Caleb and will NOT bite, Jack runs out of the Park, in a hurry to return home.\n\n\nMeanwhile, at Jack's River House, as Caleb prepares to sing a song to coax Livvie out from inside Tess, Tess touches Caleb's lips and Caleb suddenly realizes that he can NOT sing!  Tess told Caleb that, since his music IS a gift, Tess will NOT allow Caleb to use that gift for evil!  Tess also explains that, since she is ALL the good that was in Livvie, Tess will be able to use her concentration of goodness to protect Livvie from Caleb's evil desires and maybe even to help Caleb himself.  But Caleb scoffs at the notion that Tess could ever be strong enough to help him! \n\n\nWhen the Fire Fighters insist that they check out the roof of Stephen's apartment, Elizabeth went with them to show the Fire Fighters the access to the roof, leaving Lucy and Ian alone.  Ian told Lucy that he believes that Lucy was the one who called in the false alarm and, when Lucy admits that she DID feel it was imperative that she break up Elizabeth's party, Lucy prevails upon Ian to leave The Bat Cave with her.  When Elizabeth returns and discovers that Ian is gone, she flies into another rage but vows that she will eventually have Ian.\n\n\nBack at Jack's Place, Tess told Caleb that she can see a spark of light buried deep within his soul and she can help him if he will let her.  But Caleb insists that he has NO soul - so Tess is mistaken in what she sees.  Tess touches Caleb's heart and told Caleb that he DOES have a heart and that she can tell that he is capable of GREAT love.  As Caleb pulls away from Tess, Tess urges Caleb to listen to his heart.  When Jack suddenly arrives home, Caleb disappears with his candles and roses.  When Jack told Tess that the minister will arrive soon and they kiss, Caleb sadly watches them from the window.\n\n\nLucy takes Ian back to his loft and told him that she believes he was about to bite Elizabeth.  When Ian asks HOW Lucy knows all of that, Lucy passes it off as Slayer Instinct.  Lucy warns Ian that, IF he gives in to his cravings to bite someone, there will be NO turning back!  When Ian worries about hurting Lucy while Lucy insists on helping Ian, Lucy reminds Ian that he can NOT bite her because she is a slayer.  But Ian told Lucy that he believes that he could kill her in many ways.  When Ian asks what Lucy will tell Kevin, Lucy informs Ian that she has left Kevin.  Ian finally gives in to Lucy's demands that he drink some of Caleb's water from the blue bottle Lucy grabbed at Elizabeth's apartment.  But Ian can not help but ask out loud WHAT he has become.  \n\n\nBack at Jack's River House, the minister arrives and Jack and Tess pledge to love one another and are married in a brief ceremony.  After the ceremony, Jack and Tess go outside and wish upon a star.  Then they hit the sheets in front of the fireplace, to a song with the lyrics: \n\n\n\"Are these words enough\n\nTo describe the way I feel\n\nCan a silly crush\n\nTurn into something so real?\"\n\n\nCaleb returns to his Studio and finds Reese waiting for him. Caleb angrily orders Reese to put on the tracks for the new song and leave.  Reese does as she is ordered.  But, when the music starts, Caleb discovers that he can no longer sing a single note!  Caleb flies into a rage and begins trashing his Studio, then slumps down in a dejected heap in a corner.\n\n\nAs Jack and Tess hit the sheets at Jack's River House, Caleb has a vision of Tess coming to him in the Studio.  Caleb kisses Tess and asks her what she has done to him and then Caleb accuses Tess of having destroyed him.  But Tess informs Caleb that she has saved him.  Then she disappears.\n\n\n",
