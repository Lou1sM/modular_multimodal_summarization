Rafe reminds Alison that they need some clue to tell them what Caleb was doing and where he was before he came to Port Charles if they want to confirm that Caleb fabricated the circumstantial evidence that Rafe and Alison are siblings.  Alison is startled when she finds a police report about her father's death and wonders how Caleb came to have access to the report.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Jack and Tess wake up at the River House and celebrate their newly wedded bliss.  However, Jack is shocked when his new bride informs him that she had already told Caleb they were getting married.  When Jack asks WHY his wife did NOT tell him about their evil enemy's visit, Tess confesses that she did not want anything unpleasant to cast a shadow on the happiness of their wedding ceremony.  Jack again warns Tess that Caleb is dangerous - and dangerously obsessed with Tess!  Tess gently informs Jack that Caleb tried to sing to her to bring Livvie out, but she stopped him.  Jack reminds Tess that Livvie tried to stop Caleb and Livvie believed that she could change Caleb but Caleb turned Livvie into one of his undead groupies instead.  Jack vows to never let Caleb change Tess and begs Tess to promise to stay away from Caleb.  Tess finally promises her new husband that she will stay far away from their evil enemy.\n\n\nAt the same time, Kevin is unpleasantly surprised when he finds Caleb making himself at home in the living room of the Light House. Caleb guesses that Kevin believes that Livvie is dead but Caleb informs Kevin that Caleb knows WHERE Livvie is AND can get Livvie back with Kevin's help!    \n\n\nFrom Caleb's apartment, Alison reports to Rafe that the copy of the police report about Malcolm's death that Caleb has in his possession states that Elizabeth was the ONLY person the Police FOUND to question about Malcolm's death, but there was actually another person on board the yacht when Malcolm was swept overboard.  According to the report, there was a 'prince' on board the yacht but, after Malcolm's death, the 'prince' disappeared and police discovered later that the 'prince' was a fake.  Alison begins to wonder if Caleb might have been responsible for her father's death.  When Rafe suggests that the only way to know for sure would be to go to Capri, where Malcolm died, Alison insists that she must go along. When Rafe reminds Alison that they can NOT be seen together if they want Caleb to believe their ruse, Alison agrees that they should leave the United State separately and reunite in Europe.  Rafe and Alison are interrupted when Jack arrives to see Rafe and asks Rafe to teach Jack how to become a slayer.\n\n\nWhen Elizabeth arrives home, Alison announces that she is going on a trip to forget about her failed wedding, but Alison is shocked when Elizabeth declares that Elizabeth plans to travel with Alison.  Alison informs her mother that she is going to Capri to find some closure following her father's death and then also suggests that Alison's trip would give Elizabeth some time alone with her new husband. But, when Elizabeth expresses some disillusionment with her new husband, Alison suddenly changes her mind and invites her mother to go with her.  Elizabeth confides to Alison that Stephen has been obsessing over his long lost love - some girl named Olivia.  After Elizabeth agrees to accompany Alison on her trip, Alison wonders what she has done.   \n\n\nMeanwhile, at the Light House, Kevin is incredulous  when Caleb explains that Livvie IS inside Tess and went on to describe how Caleb created Tess by pulling all of the goodness out of Livvie.  Caleb told Kevin that he needs Kevin's help to recover Livvie as the woman they both knew and loved.  Caleb went on to tell Kevin that all Kevin will need to do is be a father to Tess.  Caleb confides to Kevin that Caleb needs Kevin to get friendly with Tess, get her to trust him as her father again,  and let her guard down.  Once Tess is vulnerable, Caleb will be able to separate Livvie from Tess and restore the Livvie that they both know and love.  When Kevin objects that his choices are either for his daughter to spend eternity with a vampire or be locked inside Tess for the rest of her life, Caleb reminds Kevin that, besides Kevin, the only person in Livvie's life who has ever loved Livvie unconditionally has been Caleb.  Later, Tess is shocked when Kevin arrives at Jack's River House to talk to her.\n\n\nAt Rafe's loft, Rafe informs Jack that FIRST, you have to be BORN a slayer and then you need to train for YEARS just to get the basics.  Rafe insists that being a slayer is not a job for ordinary people.  Jack admits that Caleb is obsessed with Tess and Jack is desperate to know the best way to protect Tess from her evil adversary.  Jack suddenly demonstrates that his former super-strength has returned and Rafe finally agrees to begin training Jack to defeat Caleb.  \n\n\nCaleb returns to his apartment as Elizabeth and Alison are getting ready to leave for Europe.  When Elizabeth announces that she will be going to Europe with Alison, Caleb appears unconcerned about where Elizabeth went or what she does.  Alison angrily asks him what is wrong with him but slips and calls him Caleb instead of Stephen.  Caleb immediately demands to know WHY Alison would call him Caleb.\n\n\n",
