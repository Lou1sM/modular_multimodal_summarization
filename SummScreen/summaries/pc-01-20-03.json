As they talk, there is a knock at Alison's door and, after Rafe slips out of sight, Alison opens the door to find a waiter, bringing room service.

    "tvdb": "Rafe gives Alison an impromptu honeymoon, minus any passion, when she sadly reflects on their lost honeymoon. Ian halts his passion with Lucy but says he'll fight his vampire urges because he knows she'll wait for him. After Kevin says Tess is nothing to him, Jack knocks him into a wall. Caleb's music awakens Livvie, who briefly reunites with Caleb until Tess emerges and says Caleb can't have Livvie. Caleb urges Livvie to return.

    "tvmega_recap": "Alison and Rafe's reunion in Capri is interrupted by room service for the wrong room. The order is really for a honeymooning couple on a different floor. To make Alison feel better, Rafe gives her a faux honeymoon dinner of fruit and whipped cream. They talk about the honeymoon that should have happened, but Rafe still won't reveal their destination. They're both hopeful that things will get back to normal tomorrow, because dreams really do come true. Back in Port Charles, Jack accuses Kevin of setting a trap for his own daughter. Kevin denies that Tess is even his daughter. Disgusted with his unfeeling attitude, Jack punches him out, and his vampire strength sends Kevin flying across the room. Afraid of hurting Lucy, Ian stops himself from making love to her. Now that he knows she'll wait for him, he has a reason to beat vampirism. He'll step up his research efforts, but in the meantime, he'll go ahead and drink the special water. In the woods, Caleb performs \"Surrender\" to draw out his Olivia, and it works. Their reunion is sweet until Tess manages to overpower Livvie. Caleb tries to reach her again, but the very protective Tess won't let him. Tess has a flashback of when they both fell into the river, almost drowned, and merged. Gasping for air, she collapses in Caleb's arms; she isn't breathing, and her heart isn't beating. Caleb tries to coax Olivia to wake up and breathe, but it's no use. Not reaching her, he calls out to Tess. Ian and Lucy run into each other again at the hospital. They're both trying to make off with some hospital supplies for Ian's research. An angry Kevin gets off the elevator and sees them together, which makes him angrier than ever. He tells Lucy that Jack hit him, and Jack tries to tell the others what Kevin did to provoke him. As they try to sort it out, Caleb gets off the elevator with an unconscious Tess. He asks for help, because he's afraid that she's dying.",
