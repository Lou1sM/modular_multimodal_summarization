Lucy asked Kevin if it really could\nbe Paige or someone pretending to be Paige. Kevin said it really was\nPaige. Eve and Chris talked about him getting his job back at GH. Eve\ntold Ian that Amy had moved out and Ian said that he was partly to blame\nbecause he had accused her of being an alien. Casey was upset about\nRafe. She went to see Amy and Paige and told them that there was another\none of them in Port Charles. At first Paige and Amy didn't believe\nCasey. Alison read Rafe's diary and learned that he left being an angel\nfor her. Rafe came back into the recovery room and got his diary back\nfrom Alison who said she hadn't read it.  Alison told Rafe that she\nwanted him to be happy here on earth and that they could still be\nfriends but Rafe said no because friends hang out and do things together\nand he felt that Jamal and she would have problems over it. Alison left\nthe Recovery Room and Rafe threw out his diary. Lucy told Kevin that\nPaige was really only 25 years old. Lucy then put it together that Amy\nand Paige both came to Port Charles on the same day. Lucy then told\nKevin that, when Paige shook Dr. Gordon's hand, there were samples of\nher skin left behind so he ran the tests anyway. Casey convinced Amy and\nPaige to go to the Recovery Room to see this other angel for themselves.\nThey decided to go just as a precaution. Chris and Ian and Eve joked\nabout what Ian thought about Amy. Eve asked Chris to take Amy out on a\ndate and said it was time that he moved on from Julie. Kevin thought\nthat Lucy was jealous of Paige because of the amount of time he was\nspending with her. Lucy assured Kevin that wasn't the case and told him\nto continue to do the portrait of  Paige. Alison went home to Jamal\nand a romantic setting. They kissed passionately but Alison was still\ntroubled by what she read in Rafe's diary. She told Jamal that she\nneeded a hot bath and then to lie down because she was tired. As Paige\nand Amy and Casey approached the Recovery Room, Amy sensed Rafe from\noutside while inside Rafe felt their presence as well. Chris tried to\nget Eve not to set up a date with Amy but decided he would at least try\nfor Eve's sake. Ian received an apology from Amy. \n\n\n",
    "tvdb": "After learning Paige can't be more than 25 years old, Lucy speculates to Kevin that she's an impostor, but he accuses her of being jealous.  She then contacts Victor with her suspicions.  Eve suggests to Ian and Chris that she fix up Amy with Chris.  Alison reads in Rafe's journal that he loves her, then she and Rafe decide they can't be friends.  Ali goes home to Jamal, but thinks of Rafe.  Paige and Amy are skeptical of Casey's claims that another one like them is in town.  They go to the Recovery Room and, after seeing Rafe, the women vow not to leave Earth before finishing what they came to do.",
