He wanted her to go see Kevin to do this. On the way to the airport, their car plunged down an embankment killing Will. Paige held on for a few weeks then she too died. Her husband's last wish was for her to carry on and put the past to rest so she could love him in death. \n\n\nWhen Paige is finished, Casey told her story. She says there was a boy that she liked. He invited her to a party at a crack house. Even though she had never done anything like it before, Casey went along. She tried a cocaine/heroin mixture just so he and his friends would like her. Her first experience with the drug killed her. Because of one mistake, her life ended. Now, she wants to get back what she had before she messed up... even if it's only for a little while.\n\n\nAmy's story is that she ran away and fell in love with a man. She thought he loved her, but as it turned out, he only wanted her money. One night, he shot her to get what he wanted. Now, Amy wants another chance to prove that she can make it on her own. She needs to show that she can be independent and make it on her own.\n\n\nLucy told Kevin about the accident that killed Paige's husband. However, Paige just seemed to disappear afterwards. Kevin thinks Paige must be suffering from survivor guilt, but Lucy still doesn't believe this explains her age-defying skin. They argue about what may or may not be Paige's hidden motivations for finding Kevin. Afterwards, Kevin and Lucy discover they just had their first argument as a married couple. They can't wait to get to the making up part, but first Lucy wants to check on Christina. While Kevin waits for Lucy to return, he is tempted to take a peek inside the purse Paige left behind. Inside he finds her passport. It is expired.\n\n\nIan is worried when Amy doesn't show up at the hospital. So worried, that he looks up her parents and leaves a message for them to call him back. A little while later, Ian gets a call from Amy's dad. He informs Ian that Amy disappeared and they haven't heard from her in over three years.\n\n\n",
